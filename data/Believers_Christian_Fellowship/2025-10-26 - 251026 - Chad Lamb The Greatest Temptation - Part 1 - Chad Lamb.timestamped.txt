[8:14] [music and singing]
[8:15] You are Jesus.
[8:20] Jesus, [singing]
[8:22] [music] you are Jesus,
[8:26] King of Kings, Lord of Lords. [music]
[8:30] I worship you. [singing]
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:36] What a privilege to come and worship
[8:38] him. Let's bow our heads together this
[8:41] morning. Dear Lord, it's such a
[8:44] privilege for us to be here this
[8:45] morning, God, that you would grant us an
[8:48] opportunity just to sing of your
[8:50] praises, to gather together like this
[8:53] and make our stand for you, Lord, to
[8:55] declare that we love you and we believe
[8:57] you and we want to worship you, Lord.
[9:00] For God, you said one time, Lord, to
[9:02] those who are trying to quiet the
[9:04] praises of your people that if they
[9:06] don't praise, the rocks [music] will cry
[9:08] out. But God, we're determined that
[9:10] you'll not have rocks cry out as long as
[9:12] we're here. We will cry out your
[9:14] praises. We will sing of your glory. We
[9:17] will testify of your greatness, Lord.
[9:20] For your word is true, and you ever
[9:22] remain faithful [music] to it, Lord. And
[9:23] you remain faithful to your people and
[9:25] to your promises. And we're here, Lord,
[9:27] to declare that every word is the truth.
[9:30] And we are here, Lord, to testify that
[9:33] you yet live. You are the resurrected
[9:35] Jesus Christ, every bit alive today as
[9:37] you've ever been and working and moving.
[9:40] And we love you for it, Lord. [music]
[9:42] And we count it a privilege to stand
[9:44] here and sing, God. Now, as we turn to
[9:48] your word, we ask that you would come on
[9:49] the scene, Lord, and that your spirit
[9:52] would operate through [music] a gift in
[9:53] a human body, Lord. We don't look to the
[9:55] body, but we look to you, Lord, who can
[9:58] operate through your mechanism. And
[10:00] we're here to hear from you, Lord. Would
[10:01] you come yourself and break the bread of
[10:03] life for us this morning? May you open
[10:06] our eyes. May we see you, Lord, as you
[10:08] as you feed us this morning upon your
[10:10] word. May that word, Lord, take root in
[10:13] our hearts and our souls. And may it
[10:15] bring forth a bountiful harvest for your
[10:17] glory. [music] For we're here, Lord, to
[10:19] manifest this word, not to just be
[10:21] hearers only, but doers, Lord, to make
[10:23] this word live as your spirit lives it
[10:26] through us. We love you and we ask for
[10:28] these things [music] in Jesus Christ's
[10:30] name.
[10:31] Amen.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Uh musicians, God bless
[10:36] you all. You can take your Bibles. Amen.
[10:38] I just want to welcome a couple visitors
[10:40] this morning. Uh Evangelist John Burns
[10:44] is here with his wife Miriam. God bless
[10:45] you. They're right back here. I met I
[10:48] met this brother yesterday. He popped in
[10:50] here to the church and as quite a
[10:52] testimony, shared it with me for a
[10:54] little over an hour. But he was pastor
[10:57] here of the of the old building, the old
[10:59] church in the 80s. And so I was quite
[11:01] astonished to meet him and and uh he
[11:04] said about seven years in the 80s he had
[11:07] quite a revival uh here in Lima and he
[11:10] pastored there and then he left. He went
[11:12] to Florida the church dissolved and
[11:14] right after that is when we bought it
[11:15] and it became our assembly here. So it
[11:18] was good to meet him. He's got quite a
[11:19] testimony of what the Lord's done with
[11:20] him since then and he's traveled over.
[11:23] So welcome. It's good to have you here
[11:25] with us. And it was really good for me
[11:26] to hear some more background, some
[11:27] history. Amen. and put some of the P
[11:30] puzzle pieces together for me. So, that
[11:33] was good. So, you're very welcome. Also,
[11:35] right in front of them is Brother Paul
[11:36] and Sister Susie Mass from Tennessee.
[11:38] It's good to have you guys with us once
[11:40] again. We always love it when you come
[11:41] up. Also, any other visitors, you're
[11:44] very, very welcome. We're glad that
[11:45] you're here to worship the Lord with us
[11:47] this morning. Amen.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. While we're standing, let's turn
[11:50] to the book of James. James chapter 1.
[11:57] James chapter 1
[12:02] and we're going to start with verse 13.
[12:11] James 1 and13. Let no man say when he is
[12:15] tempted, I am tempted of God. For God
[12:17] cannot be tempted with evil, neither
[12:19] tempteth he any man. But every man is
[12:22] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[12:24] lust and enticed. And when lust hath
[12:27] conceived, it bringeth forth sin. And
[12:30] sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth
[12:32] death.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me over to Genesis
[12:36] chapter 3. Now,
[12:40] Genesis chapter 3
[12:46] and verse 4. Genesis 3 and 4.
[12:53] And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye
[12:55] shall not surely die." He had asked her
[12:59] the question about that tree that the
[13:02] Lord had spoke that they were not to
[13:03] partake of. And he asked the question
[13:06] and and she gave the answer. And and he
[13:09] asked, "Did the servant said unto the
[13:11] woman, you shall not surely die." He
[13:13] begins now to contradict the word. She
[13:15] said, "We're not to touch it. Uh we're
[13:17] not to eat of it, neither shall you
[13:18] touch it, lest you die." But he begins
[13:20] to contradict the word. He says, "You
[13:21] shall not surely die. For God doesn't
[13:24] know that in the day that you eat
[13:25] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[13:27] and you shall be as gods, knowing good
[13:30] and evil." And when the woman saw that
[13:32] the tree was good for food, and that it
[13:34] was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to
[13:37] be desired to make one wise, she took of
[13:39] the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave
[13:41] also to her husband with her, and he did
[13:43] eat. And the eyes of them both were
[13:45] open, and they knew that they were
[13:47] naked, and they sowed figly. They sewed
[13:49] fig leaves together and made themselves
[13:52] aprons. Amen. God bless you as you take
[13:54] your seats and may the Lord bless the
[13:56] word and bless us as we look at his word
[13:58] and give us eyes to see
[14:01] &gt;&gt; and ears to hear.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:05] When we look at here in James, if you go
[14:07] ahead and bring up the PowerPoint for me
[14:09] uh for the overhead, I want to minister
[14:11] on the greatest temptation. Many of you
[14:13] know that I ministered up this uh
[14:15] message up in Edmonton. It's the first
[14:17] time I ever preached on it. And uh so
[14:20] some of you have heard this, but it will
[14:21] probably be a little bit different this
[14:23] morning. Uh because it always is. Amen.
[14:25] God's always expounding on the word, and
[14:27] we're always learning more and seeing
[14:29] more. But God began to deal deal with me
[14:31] on this subject about a week before I
[14:33] went up to Edmonton, maybe two weeks,
[14:35] and uh and I preached it up there. But
[14:37] it had such impact on me personally. It
[14:40] was something that uh God began to deal
[14:42] with me on and I I ended up uh uh it
[14:46] gave me such insight into myself and it
[14:50] it opened my eyes to to the greater need
[14:53] that I have. And so even though some of
[14:55] you archived it, some of you watched it.
[14:58] Amen. I just felt in my heart I want to
[15:00] share it with the whole congregation. I
[15:02] know everybody hasn't had a chance to
[15:03] listen. So I want to share it together.
[15:05] So stay with me. Pull on the word. Even
[15:07] if you heard it before, pull extra hard.
[15:08] Amen. especially if you liked it so your
[15:11] brothers and sisters can get their
[15:12] portion too. Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; But but when we talk about the greatest
[15:16] temptation, I found out that the
[15:18] greatest temptation for me is not
[15:19] necessarily the what I thought it would
[15:21] be.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we look in James, James
[15:24] says, "Let no man say when he is
[15:26] tempted, I'm tempted of God. For God
[15:28] cannot tempt be tempted with evil,
[15:30] neither tempteth he any man. But every
[15:32] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[15:35] his own lust and enticed."
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what's causing the temptation?
[15:40] You realize that there's many things
[15:42] that come in life. Amen. There's many
[15:44] opportunities that you have to do wrong.
[15:47] We're surrounded by opportunities to
[15:49] error.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; It's all over. Amen. Everywhere we go,
[15:52] there's sin. There's things that are
[15:54] contrary to the will of God and the
[15:56] desired nature of God. And we can fall
[15:58] into any kind of trap at any time. Amen.
[16:01] But but what is it, Amen, that keeps us
[16:04] from it? Or what is it that causes us to
[16:06] fall? Well, James gives us an insight
[16:09] and the insight is every man is tempted
[16:11] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[16:14] and enticed. So he finds out what causes
[16:16] me to fall. Amen. Is something that's
[16:19] inside of me that has a desire for
[16:21] something contrary than the word of God.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; And it there's some things that don't
[16:26] bother me at all. There's some things
[16:27] I'll never be tempted with. It's not an
[16:29] enticement to me because I don't have
[16:31] anything in me that's attracted to that.
[16:34] But when I fall, it's because there was
[16:35] something in me. me. There was a lust in
[16:37] me and I was enticed by that lust in me
[16:40] and I was drawn away.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; So, we can't blame anybody else for our
[16:47] failure. There's nobody else to blame.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; We can't pin it on anybody. You say,
[16:51] "Well, the crowd I was with, hey,
[16:53] listen, the crowd you were with was
[16:55] giving an opportunity for something you
[16:57] were lusting for to manifest."
[17:00] &gt;&gt; And lust is not just sexual. Lust is in
[17:03] any strong desire. Amen. Any desire that
[17:06] you have, that's a strong desire. I
[17:09] mean, you can lust for something to eat.
[17:11] You can lust for some material good of
[17:12] the world. You can lust for a car. You
[17:14] can lust for many things. So, don't just
[17:16] think sexual things here. Anything that
[17:19] you're craving with a strong crave.
[17:21] [clears throat]
[17:22] &gt;&gt; So, you say, "Well, my parents or my my
[17:24] coworker, but you can't blame anybody
[17:26] else." And James is saying, "Don't pin
[17:28] that on God either." AMEN. IT'S
[17:30] SOMETHING INSIDE of you that was
[17:32] attracted, that was enticed. there was a
[17:34] lust.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; So he says, "But every man is tempted
[17:37] when he has drawn away of his own lust
[17:38] and entice. Then when lust hath
[17:40] conceived, it bringeth forth sin. Sin
[17:42] when it is finished bringeth forth
[17:43] death." This is why the new birth is so
[17:46] important. Amen. Because our first birth
[17:48] was wrong. And we came with a sin nature
[17:50] that loved all of these things. So we
[17:52] must be born again to get a new nature,
[17:54] the life of Christ on the inside, the
[17:56] Holy Ghost living in us to change our
[17:59] desires. Cuz when your desires change,
[18:01] you're no longer tempted with the things
[18:03] you were tempted with.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Why is it THAT BEFORE YOU WOULD never be
[18:07] able to walk down a certain street?
[18:08] Amen. You were tempted whether it was
[18:10] alcohol or drugs or or sexual things or
[18:13] or perversion, but you were there was
[18:15] places you could not go because anytime
[18:17] you got near there, there was like a
[18:18] magnetic draw to you pulling you to it.
[18:21] But when God converted you and changed
[18:23] you and washed you up and delivered you
[18:25] from those spirits and filled you with
[18:26] his spirit, AMEN, THAT THING DOESN'T
[18:28] HAVE THE MAGNETIC pull on you that it
[18:30] once had.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the power of God to
[18:35] deliver us.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has to change
[18:40] change us at the core of who we are. We
[18:42] have to become a new creature in Christ
[18:44] Jesus.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we're no longer
[18:47] tempted.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. that we're
[18:50] constantly being tempted. Amen. But but
[18:54] the temptation to me starts to change.
[18:58] And we start to look at what becomes the
[19:00] most deceptive kind of temptation. And
[19:03] that's what I want to begin to look at.
[19:07] We know as we look at the word here that
[19:10] Eve was tempted.
[19:12] She had the word of the Lord. The word
[19:14] of the Lord that was given to her said,
[19:16] "Don't eat. Don't partake of this tree.
[19:20] Everything else is free to you to enjoy.
[19:23] But this is one thing that's off limits.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; And it seems as though she never really
[19:31] paid much attention to the tree. This is
[19:33] just reading through the scriptures
[19:34] because then the serpent, amen, begins
[19:37] who's anointed of the devil begins to
[19:40] entice her with questions and he says,
[19:42] "Did not the Lord does did the Lord say
[19:45] that if you eat that, you're not to eat
[19:47] of it?" and and she begins to say,
[19:48] "Well, he said this and he said that."
[19:50] And then the servant says, "But you'll
[19:52] not surely die."
[19:55] That's not exactly the way it's going to
[19:56] happen. Amen. But but God doth know that
[20:00] in the day you eat thereof, your eyes
[20:01] shall be open. Amen. You'll become as
[20:04] gods, knowing good and evil. Amen. And
[20:07] and he began to contradict the word, but
[20:09] he began to tell her, "Amen. It's not
[20:11] exactly like that, but the the the real
[20:13] thing is God's trying to keep you from
[20:15] something. There's something more that
[20:18] you can have and and it's a good thing.
[20:20] And and and if you if you have this,
[20:22] it'll be greater and you'll understand
[20:24] more.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. And then then it says in
[20:30] verse six,
[20:32] "And the woman saw that the tree was
[20:34] good for food."
[20:36] She hadn't seen that before.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; She had in the scripture reading, she
[20:41] hadn't seen that before. She knew she
[20:44] knew it was there. Amen. She was told
[20:46] not to to to partake of it. She left it
[20:48] alone until this enticing thought came
[20:50] along. And the serpent began to work on
[20:53] her reasoning and begin to get her to
[20:55] look at the tree in a different way.
[20:57] Amen. And begin to find out that if
[20:58] you'll partake of this, Amen. Your
[21:01] understanding will grow and you'll
[21:03] BECOME LIKE A GOD. AMEN. And this is
[21:06] what God knows and this is what God's
[21:08] preventing you from. And then she looked
[21:10] at the tree and it was good for food and
[21:13] it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[21:16] to be desired to make one wise. When she
[21:19] looked at those three things, there's
[21:21] nothing in the scripture that tells us
[21:22] that those three things are untrue.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[21:26] &gt;&gt; It may be every bit true that it was
[21:28] good for food, a tree to be desired, a a
[21:31] a
[21:34] pleasant to the eyes, and to be desired
[21:36] to make one wise. Amen. God didn't tell
[21:39] her not to partake of the tree because
[21:41] of those things. He told her not to
[21:43] partake of it. He had something else in
[21:45] mind. He knew where that would lead.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; But the devil got her to reason about
[21:50] it. And when her reasoning, she began to
[21:53] consider the commandment of the Lord in
[21:55] a different light. And when she
[21:57] considered it in a different light, she
[21:59] began TO SAY, "WELL, IT DOES look nice
[22:01] and it does look like it's good for food
[22:03] and and it will, you know, MAKE ONE
[22:05] WISE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT ANYHOW? And
[22:08] she partakes and gives to her husband
[22:09] and he partakes.
[22:12] And the Bible [clears throat] says this
[22:13] in in uh Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God
[22:16] said unto the woman, "What is this that
[22:18] thou has done?" And the woman said, "The
[22:20] serpent begoured me, and I did eat." The
[22:24] the word begiled means to be deceived.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; The woman WAS DECEIVED. SHE THOUGHT she
[22:30] was actually doing something good. When
[22:33] the reasoning powers kicked in and she
[22:35] began to look at the tree AND SEE ALL
[22:37] THE POSITIVE benefits of it and all the
[22:38] beauty and all the wisdom and all the
[22:40] things, she began to think, well, this
[22:42] is right anyways. This is the right
[22:44] thing to do. And she was deceived into
[22:47] falling.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; And in 1 Timothy 2:14, it said, "And
[22:51] Adam was not deceived, but the woman
[22:54] being deceived was in the
[22:55] transgression." Amen. Adam knew what he
[22:58] was doing. He did wrong intentionally to
[23:00] save his wife. But she didn't know she
[23:03] was doing wrong. Amen. She was deceived
[23:06] into doing wrong because she considered
[23:08] the tree which she should have never
[23:10] considered.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Here's what the prophet of God tells us.
[23:14] He says, "And that's what's the matter
[23:16] today. The sleeping virgin staying long
[23:18] enough to get part of the word, but not
[23:20] all of the word."
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; The deceived church stays long enough to
[23:23] get part of the word, but not all the
[23:24] word. And they were sincere and honest
[23:27] about it. Eve was deceived. She was
[23:29] deceived. Adam was not deceived. Adam
[23:32] knew exactly he was doing wrong. But his
[23:34] wife doing the things that she was doing
[23:36] persuaded him to partake of the
[23:37] forbidden. Why? He was a man. See, and
[23:39] it was so to him that he understood. He
[23:42] you understand. See, he knowed he was
[23:44] doing wrong. But Eve thought she was
[23:46] doing right.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; He says it this way in another message.
[23:51] Now, Satan, this deceiver spoke of in
[23:53] Matthew 24:24 with so much deceit. Now
[23:56] we find that by his gospel programs of
[23:59] knowledge, better education, higher
[24:01] ethics, civilization and so forth has
[24:04] bewitched the people that wants to serve
[24:05] God into believing his lie. Eve did not
[24:08] want to do that. But he showed her how
[24:10] it was more wisdom in it. She didn't
[24:13] know. She wanted to know. I want you to
[24:16] I want to highlight this. She wanted to
[24:19] know.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; She didn't understand. She wanted to
[24:23] understand.
[24:24] AND GOD TOLD HER NOT TO TRY TO
[24:26] UNDERSTAND. God didn't give her a word
[24:28] to understand. He gave her a commandment
[24:30] to keep her safe. AMEN. TO PROTECT her
[24:32] from this danger that was laying there.
[24:34] Amen. But she there was See, she was
[24:37] enticed when she was led away of her own
[24:40] lust.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T KNOW, BUT SHE WANTED TO KNOW.
[24:44] And we began to tell her, "There's more.
[24:46] Your eyes will open. You'll be like a
[24:48] God. You'll understand." And she began
[24:50] to consider. AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE
[24:52] WAS TALKING ABOUT, BUT SHE WANTED to
[24:54] know. He was working on a LUST THAT WAS
[24:56] INSIDE of her. Amen. And she wanted to
[24:58] understand.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he had to work on something
[25:03] that was inside of her.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; And 1 John 2:15-17 says, "Love not the
[25:10] world, neither the things that are in
[25:13] the world. If any man love the world,
[25:15] the love of the Father is not in him.
[25:17] [clears throat] For all that is in the
[25:19] world, the lust of the flesh, and the
[25:21] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
[25:24] is not of the Father, but is of the
[25:26] world.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; And the world passes away, and the lust
[25:29] thereof. But he that doeth the will of
[25:32] God abideth forever.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Who abides forever? He that does the
[25:37] will of God.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; What is the will of God? This is the
[25:41] will of God.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; He's given us his will when he gave us
[25:44] his word. This is his will. And he that
[25:47] doeth the will of God abideth forever.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. She left the will of God and took
[25:53] her own will.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she was deceived into it. She
[25:57] thought she was doing good. For all that
[26:00] is in the world is the lust of the
[26:02] flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
[26:05] pride of life.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was tempted with three things.
[26:09] That the tree was good for food,
[26:11] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
[26:14] desired to make one wise. She was tested
[26:17] with the things that are in the world.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; The lust of the flesh, the lust of the
[26:21] eyes, and the pride of life. Amen. And
[26:24] I've said this before, but I'll say it
[26:25] again. This is what's in the world.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; This is what's worldly.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; WE TRY NOT to be worldly. We don't want
[26:33] to be worldly. We're Christians. We're
[26:35] sanctified. We're set apart and
[26:36] separated from the world and to service
[26:38] unto the Lord. Amen. But what is the
[26:40] world? We call the world drinking,
[26:43] smoking, carousing, committing adultery,
[26:44] and all these other things. All the
[26:46] debauchery, murder, violence that's of
[26:48] the world. Listen, BY THE TIME YOU GET
[26:50] THERE, you're so far REMOVED FROM THE
[26:52] GOSPEL. AMEN. BUT WHAT STARTED down that
[26:55] path, the world, all that is in the
[26:57] world is the lust of the flesh, the lust
[26:59] of the eyes, and the pride of life. And
[27:01] I say this, you can be in the world and
[27:04] worldly and sit in your seat every
[27:06] Sunday and Wednesday.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE CHURCH TO BE
[27:10] IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN BE IN THE world
[27:12] and be in church. YOU CAN BE DRESSED
[27:14] RIGHT AND LOOK RIGHT AND ACT RIGHT AND
[27:16] DO RIGHT. BUT IF YOU'RE DEALING, AMEN,
[27:18] with the lust of the flesh, the lust of
[27:19] the eyes, and the pride of life, and
[27:21] you're giving over to those things, and
[27:23] you're and you're you're YIELDING TO
[27:25] THAT, THAT'S OF THE WORLD.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; I'LL ASK YOU THIS. THE Pharisees
[27:33] &gt;&gt; in the days that Jesus was on earth, the
[27:36] Pharisees, Amen. Who were they? WERE
[27:38] THEY GODLY or were they worldly?
[27:42] They didn't look worldly. They didn't
[27:44] act worldly. AMEN. THEY PUT ON a a
[27:46] pretense. THEY HAD A FACADE that they
[27:48] were godly. Amen. They were reverent.
[27:50] THEY WERE PIOUS. AMEN. THEY WENT TO
[27:52] CHURCH. They did everything that they
[27:54] were supposed to do. But Jesus could
[27:56] look through ALL OF THAT AND SAID THEIR
[27:58] HEARTS are corrupted.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; They were doing those things for the
[28:02] wrong reason. Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; And so when I looked at the greatest
[28:06] temptation, I began to say this. I'm
[28:08] just going to I wrote it down. So, I'll
[28:10] just read it this way.
[28:12] The greatest temptation for a child of
[28:14] God is not to do something evil, but to
[28:19] do something good for the wrong reasons.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Or to do something that's right, but not
[28:27] according to the word.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] Yes,
[28:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat that a couple more
[28:32] times throughout this because I believe
[28:33] it's so important
[28:35] &gt;&gt; because the greatest temptation to e,
[28:38] you know, the woman wasn't trying to do
[28:40] wrong. The woman wasn't seeking out
[28:43] wickedness,
[28:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:44] &gt;&gt; She was deceived into thinking that
[28:47] actually this was the right thing to do
[28:49] and this would bring about the promise
[28:50] of God to multiply and replenish the
[28:52] earth and this is the way to do it and
[28:54] this is wisdom and this is right and
[28:56] this is beauty and it'll be a blessing.
[28:58] Amen. She was deceived trying to do
[29:01] SOMETHING RIGHT BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE
[29:04] WORD.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And why did she do that? Because there
[29:08] WAS SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER THAT WANTED
[29:10] to know, that wanted to understand.
[29:13] There was a lust for knowledge in her.
[29:15] And he was telling her, "This is the way
[29:17] that you get it." And then she saw those
[29:19] three things that appealed to the world.
[29:20] The lust of the flesh, the lust of the
[29:22] eyes, the pride of life. AND SHE FELL
[29:24] for it.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Not trying to BE WICKED. SHE FELL FOR IT
[29:28] TRYING TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT,
[29:30] &gt;&gt; TRYING TO BRING ABOUT THE WORD, BUT SHE
[29:32] WAS TRYING TO PERFORM THE WORD AND BRING
[29:34] ABOUT THE PROMISE according to her will
[29:37] and not GOD'S WILL BECAUSE GOD'S will is
[29:39] his word.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; And his word said, "Don't partake."
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; So, I'll read that again. The greatest
[29:49] temptation for a child of God is not to
[29:52] do something evil, but to do something
[29:54] good for the wrong reason.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Or to do something right, but not
[30:02] according to the word.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; We're going to look through the
[30:05] scriptures and we're going to we're
[30:07] going to see this as we go.
[30:10] When when Adam and his wife fell,
[30:15] immediately they made fig leaves for
[30:17] themselves.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Fig leaves to cover their sin, to cover
[30:21] their nakedness, an apron of fig leaves
[30:24] to cover the affected area of sin
[30:26] because their sin was sexual in nature.
[30:30] And they covered their they covered
[30:31] their sin. And they they put on the fig
[30:35] leaves, which is a type of religion.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's what the Pharisees
[30:39] had put on to cover their lustful heart.
[30:41] Amen. They put on a cloak of religion.
[30:43] That's what man has always done. He's
[30:45] always put on a religion to try to hide
[30:47] his sin nature and try to be right.
[30:49] Amen. By by covering sin. Amen. You
[30:52] can't cover sin. It has to be atoned
[30:54] for.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so they put on the fig LEAVES
[31:01] AND NO DOUBT THEY WERE SOMEWHAT
[31:03] SATISFIED WITH their religion.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And their religion was
[31:07] somewhat satisfying because they were
[31:09] moving on. Amen. With their aprons of
[31:11] fig leaves covering their nakedness and
[31:13] and they were they were uh uh in
[31:16] fellowship until
[31:18] their religion worked until they heard
[31:21] the voice voice of the Lord
[31:24] &gt;&gt; walking in the cool of the evening. And
[31:26] when they heard his voice because his
[31:28] voice is his word. When they heard his
[31:30] voice, amen, they hid themselves for
[31:32] they realized they were naked. Amen.
[31:34] WHEN WHEN GOD SAYS, "ADAM, WHERE ARE
[31:36] THOU?" ADAM SAYS, "I hid myself BECAUSE
[31:38] I WAS NAKED." AMEN. TECHNICALLY, he
[31:41] wasn't naked. He was still wearing his
[31:42] fig leaf. But in the PRESENCE OF GOD,
[31:45] THAT RELIGION WAS NOTHING.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; He was bare. He was bare and laid BARE
[31:50] BEFORE GOD. AND FRIENDS, TODAY WE are
[31:52] laid bare before GOD. THE ONLY CLOAK for
[31:55] our sin is the blood OF JESUS CHRIST
[31:57] THAT WASHES it away. To be clothed IN
[32:00] THE WORD, COVERED IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
[32:02] IS THE only thing that will COVER US.
[32:03] RELIGION WON'T DO IT. THE VOICE OF GOD
[32:06] PIERCES THROUGH RELIGION and exposes
[32:08] nakedness.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want TO I WANT MY SINS TO BE
[32:15] WASHED AWAY BY THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[32:18] And I WANT TO BE CLOTHED IN his
[32:19] righteousness. I be shielded with his
[32:22] word, walking in his word.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Because the will of God abideth forever.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world passes away and all the
[32:31] lust, the lust of the flesh, the lust of
[32:33] the eyes, the pride of life, it all
[32:35] vanish.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; May he endureth the will of God abideth
[32:39] &gt;&gt; forever.
[32:41] Praise God. Isn't God good?
[32:45] &gt;&gt; So glad he's provided his word for us in
[32:47] this generation. He's restored the word.
[32:50] Amen. Was lost through the dark ages,
[32:51] but brought back through a prophetic
[32:53] ministry in the end time to bring us
[32:55] back to the truth of this Bible. Amen.
[32:57] So the bride can be clothed in his word.
[32:59] Amen.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Not religion, not fig leaves, not
[33:03] man-made ideas,
[33:05] &gt;&gt; but the puress of his word.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[33:10] Man, let's turn together to Matthew
[33:12] chapter 4.
[33:26] Matthew chapter 4.
[33:30] verse one.
[33:33] This is Jesus's temptation in the
[33:35] wilderness.
[33:38] Matthew chapter 4 verse one.
[33:43] [snorts] Just before chapter 4 is his
[33:45] baptism in Jordan where the Holy Spirit
[33:48] descends like a dove out of heaven and
[33:50] rest upon him. And then it says in verse
[33:53] uh chapter 4:1, "Then was Jesus led up
[33:55] of the spirit unto the wilderness to be
[33:57] tempted of the devil. And when he had
[33:59] fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he was
[34:01] afterward hungered." Jesus was hungry,
[34:06] &gt;&gt; very hungry,
[34:07] &gt;&gt; and when the tempter came to him, he
[34:10] said, "If thou be the son of God,
[34:11] command these stones to be made bread."
[34:14] But he answered and said, "Is it it is
[34:16] written, man shall not live by bread
[34:18] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[34:20] out of the mouth of God."
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Then the devil taketh him up into a holy
[34:25] city, and setth him on the pinnacle of
[34:27] the temple, and saith to him, "If thou
[34:29] be the son of God, cast thyself down,
[34:31] for it is written, he shall give his
[34:33] angels charge concerning thee, and in
[34:35] their hands they shall bear thee up,
[34:37] lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[34:38] against a stone." And Jesus said unto
[34:41] him, "It is written again, Thou shalt
[34:43] not tempt the Lord thy God." Again the
[34:45] devil taketh him up into an exceeding
[34:47] high mountain, and showeth him all the
[34:49] kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
[34:51] them, and saith unto him, All these
[34:54] things will I give thee, if thou wilt
[34:56] fall down, and worship me. Then said
[34:58] Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan,
[35:00] for it is written, Thou shalt worship
[35:02] the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
[35:05] thou serve. Amen.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Then the devil leaveth him, and behold,
[35:09] angels came and ministered unto him.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus now in the great temptation in the
[35:19] wilderness comes face to face with the
[35:21] devil. And the devil begins to lay
[35:23] temptation to temptation. And there's
[35:25] three temptations. And the three
[35:26] temptations correspond to the scriptures
[35:29] that we just read.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And then let's go back and and and look
[35:33] at 1 John 2. For all that is in the
[35:35] world is the lust of the flesh, the lust
[35:37] of the eyes, and the pride of life. And
[35:39] this is what Jesus contends with and
[35:41] overcomes in the wilderness. He was
[35:44] hungry. The lust of the flesh, he was
[35:46] hungry. And he and then he says, "If
[35:48] thou be the son of God,
[35:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[35:51] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, make these
[35:54] stones into bread." And then you you ask
[35:57] yourself, what what's wrong with that?
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; He is the son of God,
[36:03] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; He is the son of God and he was hungry
[36:06] and HE HAD ALL POWER TO DO IT. AMEN. And
[36:09] so you think he was being tempted,
[36:11] listen, he was being tempted not to do
[36:13] something evil because there's nothing
[36:15] evil about turning stones INTO BREAD. IN
[36:18] FACT, HE WAS BEING challenged to
[36:20] identify himself as the son OF GOD. WHAT
[36:23] WOULD BE WRONG WITH PROVING to Satan he
[36:24] was who he said he was? Yeah.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; You see, THE TEMPTATION WAS NOT TO do
[36:30] something evil, BUT THE TEMPTATION was
[36:32] to do something of his own will, not
[36:34] according to the will OF GOD. BECAUSE
[36:36] GOD NEVER TOLD HIM TO TURN THOSE stones
[36:40] &gt;&gt; into bread. For him to EXERCISE HIS OWN
[36:42] WILL, AMEN. WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING
[36:44] OUTSIDE the will of God.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; And so, it wasn't evil that Jesus was
[36:52] being tempted with. It was to do
[36:54] something good, but to do it for
[36:55] himself.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; To serve his own flesh.
[37:00] And then he was taken up on the on the
[37:02] pinnacle of the the temple and he was
[37:05] told in verse six, he said, "Cast
[37:08] thyself down, for it is written."
[37:11] [clears throat]
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Now he's quoting to him the scriptures.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you THINK THE DEVIL CAN'T quote
[37:17] the scriptures? The devil can quote the
[37:18] scriptures. He has it memorized.
[37:22] And listen, he said, "He shall give his
[37:24] angels charge concerning thee." Oh, I
[37:27] love this. And in their hands they shall
[37:30] bear thee up, lest at any time they dash
[37:31] thy foot against a stone. He's reading
[37:33] out of the book of Psalms. And the devil
[37:35] is quoting this scripture accurately.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; He's not twisting THE WORDS. HE'S NOT
[37:40] MANIPULATING the meaning. He's giving
[37:42] you an accurate, verbatim, word by word
[37:46] &gt;&gt; uh repeating of the scriptures. HE'S
[37:49] QUOTING THE SCRIPTURE ACCURATELY,
[37:52] &gt;&gt; but he's trying to get Jesus once again
[37:54] TO TAKE THE PRIDE OF LIFE TO PROVE WHO
[37:57] HE is
[37:58] &gt;&gt; because it he says, "Listen, if you're
[38:01] THE SON OF GOD, IT'S WRITTEN ABOUT THE
[38:02] SON OF GOD. HEY, HE'S NOT GOING TO DASH
[38:04] HIS FOOT AGAINST THE STONE. THE ANGELS
[38:06] HAVE CHARGE over him. Listen, cast
[38:08] yourself down and prove this scripture."
[38:12] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH PROVING THE WORD
[38:14] IS TRUE?
[38:18] HE WASN'T BEING ASKED, AMEN, TO DO
[38:20] SOMETHING WICKED. HE WASN'T DO asked him
[38:22] to do something evil. HE WAS BEING ASKED
[38:24] TO PROVE THE WORD.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Are we getting it?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; But that would have been to identify
[38:35] himself
[38:36] &gt;&gt; and to prove himself.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; God never told him to do that.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:44] And then he taketh him up on an
[38:46] exceeding high mountain. Mountains
[38:47] always type of a kingdom in the Bible.
[38:49] Shows him all the kingdoms of the world
[38:51] and the glory of them. And he saith unto
[38:53] him, "All these things will I give thee
[38:55] if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
[38:58] Listen, Jesus was the king of the world.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; He was to come into the kingdom, the
[39:03] throne of David, to rule and reign over
[39:06] all of the earth. And that's where he
[39:07] was going to come to bring a righteous
[39:09] reign according to the word of God. And
[39:12] what the devil was offering him was a
[39:14] shortcut to his destination.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Not to do evil, but to do good.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; You can be you can go ahead AND BECOME
[39:24] KING OF ALL THE WORLD, ALL THE EARTH,
[39:26] AND YOU CAN SET THE KINGDOM UP. YOU CAN
[39:28] GO TO THE THRONE of David. You can set
[39:30] it up in righteous rule. But he would
[39:33] have had to bypass the word because the
[39:35] word declared there had to be a lamb of
[39:37] God to pay the price for the sins of the
[39:39] world. He would have went WITHOUT
[39:40] REDEMPTION PRICE PAID. HE WOULD HAVE
[39:42] WENT OUTSIDE the will of God. HE WOULD
[39:44] HAVE GOT TO THE DESTINATION, BUT HE
[39:46] WOULDN'T HAVE COME THROUGH THE PATH OF
[39:48] THE word
[39:52] &gt;&gt; and offered him the pride of life. And
[39:54] Jesus overcame all three temptations
[39:56] that the woman failed by, that Eve
[39:58] failed by in the Garden of Eden. He
[40:00] overcame them in the wilderness.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; But it's also worth noting, how did he
[40:07] overcome them? Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; By the word.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, Brother Bam, tells
[40:13] us, he says he didn't use any OF HIS
[40:15] POWERS. HE HAD THEM ALL. HE DIDN'T USE
[40:17] ANY OF HIS GIFTS. HE HAD THEM ALL. He
[40:19] didn't use any of his great intellect.
[40:21] He didn't use any of that. What he
[40:23] simply used was, "Thus sayaeth the Lord.
[40:26] Thus sayeth the Lord, it is written. It
[40:28] is written." HE COMBED THE DEVIL NOT
[40:31] WITH WISDOM, NOT WITH REASONING. THIS IS
[40:33] WHERE EVE GOT INTO TROUBLE. SHE BEGAN TO
[40:36] REASON with him and consider what THE
[40:37] DEVIL WAS SAYING. JESUS NEVER CONSIDERED
[40:40] WHAT HE SAID. HE JUST WENT TO THE WORD.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; But the WORD SAYS THIS, BUT THE
[40:45] SCRIPTURE SAYS THIS, BUT THE LORD SAYS
[40:47] THIS.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; AND THE THE DEVIL WAS USING THE WORD,
[40:52] TOO. BUT JESUS KNEW THE PROPER
[40:54] APPLICATION OF THE WORD FOR HIS DAY AND
[40:56] SEASON. HE KNEW THE HOUR HE WAS LIVING,
[40:59] AND HE KNEW HIS PURPOSE UPON THE EARTH.
[41:00] AND HE KNEW WHAT SCRIPTURES APPLIED AND
[41:02] WHAT SCRIPTURES DIDN'T APPLY. AND THOSE
[41:04] SCRIPTURES WERE TRYING TO GET HIM TO
[41:06] PROVE HIMSELF. AND HE WASN'T THERE TO
[41:08] PROVE HIMSELF. HE WAS THERE TO MAGNIFY
[41:10] GOD. HE WAS THERE TO TESTIFY OF A LIVING
[41:13] GOD AND BE GOD ON the earth.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; He was there to show the father.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; So he wasn't there to prove himself. God
[41:24] would vindicate him and back him up.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we when we look at all of
[41:30] this, we begin to realize the great the
[41:34] great temptation
[41:36] is not to go to a bar and get drunk.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Because as we're serving the Lord, God
[41:42] has freed us from those things. God has
[41:43] delivered us from those. Those at one
[41:45] point were our temptations. And and if
[41:47] it's still your temptation, AMEN, CRY
[41:49] OUT TO GOD. HE'LL deliver you.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; HIS SPIRIT WILL WASH YOU. NEW BIRTH WILL
[41:53] MAKE YOU A NEW CREATURE until those
[41:55] desires just fade away. Right.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR FOR US WHO ARE SERVING THE LORD,
[42:00] THOSE who've been born again by his
[42:02] spirit. Amen. We're walking in this LIFE
[42:04] WITH A DESIRE TO serve God, being freed
[42:06] OF SO MANY THINGS, but it doesn't mean
[42:08] we're not going to be tempted. Jesus,
[42:10] after he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[42:12] at the river, was tempted of the devil.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; We're going to be tempted. AMEN. BUT WE
[42:16] GOT TO QUIT THINKING, "As long as I'm
[42:18] not drinking, as long as I'm not
[42:20] smoking, as long as I'm not doing drugs,
[42:22] as long as I'm not fornicating, as long
[42:23] as I'm not looking at pornography, I'M
[42:26] NOT SINNING. I'M NOT IN ERROR." AMEN.
[42:28] We're in danger every day of our lives.
[42:30] AMEN. BECAUSE THE WORLD IS ALL AROUND
[42:32] US. AMEN. Because the things that are in
[42:34] the world is the lust of the flesh, the
[42:36] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; We still have this old sticky cockleburn
[42:43] nature. Amen. that sometimes wants to
[42:45] prove itself,
[42:47] &gt;&gt; to serve itself, to magnify itself.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; We got to keep this body A BASE. LIKE
[42:53] PAUL SAID, I I beat my body. Keep it in
[42:56] subjection.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Men, we have to realize where
[43:01] temptation's coming and what it's for.
[43:05] Jesus wasn't being temp tempted with a
[43:07] woman.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; He wasn't being tempted with drugs.
[43:12] He was being tempted with the lust of
[43:15] the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the
[43:16] pride of life. Yes, sir.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And all of it had a religious tone.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; if thou be, it was all very religious
[43:28] and all around the word.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Eve was deceived. She
[43:36] saw part of the word. Moab was deceived.
[43:39] The sleeping virgin was deceived. The
[43:41] church is deceived. The denominations
[43:43] are deceived. See, stay with the word.
[43:46] That's the only way. Stay right with it.
[43:48] Don't move from any of it. Stay right
[43:50] with it. Go right on what God said do.
[43:52] No matter what anybody else says, keep
[43:55] God's line.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; In the Leodysian church age, he says, "A
[44:02] quick look at these scriptures which
[44:03] involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will
[44:05] bring out the truth of this
[44:06] proposition." In Matthew 4, wherein
[44:09] Jesus is tempted of the devil, he
[44:10] overcame the personal temptations of
[44:13] Satan by the word and by the word only.
[44:17] That's right.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And each of the three major trials that
[44:19] correspond exactly to the temptation of
[44:21] the garden Eden, the lust of the flesh,
[44:22] the lust of the eyes, the pride of life,
[44:24] Jesus overcame by the word. Eve fell to
[44:27] the personal temptation of Satan by
[44:29] failing to use the word.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[44:35] word. But Jesus overcame by the word.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And right now, let me say that this is
[44:40] the only way to be an overcomer. Also,
[44:43] it is the only way that you can know if
[44:45] you are overcoming because the word
[44:47] can't fail.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, this is so good. I love this so
[44:52] much. AMEN. WHAT WOULD IT taken for Eve
[44:55] to overcome in the Garden of Eden? All
[44:57] she would have to SAY IS, "GOD HATH
[44:59] SAID, don't touch. Don't take and eat OF
[45:01] THAT TREE." THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO DO.
[45:03] YEAH.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE POWER. SHE
[45:06] DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE SKILL. SHE DOESN'T
[45:07] HAVE TO HAVE WISDOM. She doesn't have to
[45:08] have might. She doesn't HAVE TO HAVE
[45:09] ANYTHING. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS REPEAT
[45:11] WHAT GOD SAID ABOUT WHAT THE serpent's
[45:14] speaking TO HER ABOUT. AND THAT'S IT.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; NOT ADD HER OWN THOUGHT. NOT ADD HER OWN
[45:18] OPINION. AMEN. NOT SAY IT IN HOSTILITY.
[45:21] AMEN. NOT NOT CAST THE DEVIL INTO
[45:23] OBLIVION. ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS JUST SAY
[45:26] WHAT GOD SAID. AND SHE would have had
[45:28] victory over that trial.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and she WOULD HAVE JUST STAYED
[45:31] WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF the tree that's
[45:33] in the midst of the garden.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Don't eat of it.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; SIMPLE.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL SHE HAS TO DO. AND WHEN JESUS
[45:41] RESISTED THE DEVIL WITH THE WORD, AMEN.
[45:43] When he resisted, THE DEVIL LEFT HIM.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE DEVIL CAN'T FIGHT THE
[45:50] WORD. THE DEVIL CAN OUTREASON YOU. HE
[45:52] CAN OUTTHINK YOU. HE CAN OUTWEIGHT YOU.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CANNOT FIGHT THE WORD OF GOD. THE
[45:58] WORD OF GOD IS ETERNAL. THE WORD OF GOD
[46:00] IS STEADFAST. IT'S A ROCK OF FOUNDATION
[46:02] THAT WE BUILD OUR HOUSE UPON. AND THE
[46:04] STORMS AND THE WAVES CANNOT BEAT it
[46:06] down.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Everything else is an idea, IS A
[46:10] THOUGHT, is reasoning of man.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And it will all crumble.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; But Jesus overcame by the word. Did he
[46:17] have power? Yes.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Did he had gifts? Yes.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he use any of those gifts?
[46:24] because he was demonstrating to you and
[46:26] I THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OVERCOME
[46:29] THE DEVIL IN EVERY TEMPTATION, in every
[46:32] trial, IN EVERY TACTIC OF THE ENEMY. ALL
[46:34] WE HAVE to do is say, "Thus sayeth the
[46:36] Lord, it is written."
[46:39] &gt;&gt; That's our defense, friends.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; That's the wall that we stay behind.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Is the word of God. John chapter 1 it
[46:48] says in the beginning was the word and
[46:51] the word was with God and the word was
[46:54] God.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God.
[46:57] All things were made by him and without
[46:59] him was not anything made that was made.
[47:01] In him was life and the life was the
[47:03] light of men. This is referring to Jesus
[47:05] Christ. In verse 14 it says, "And the
[47:07] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[47:09] And we beheld his glory, the glory of as
[47:11] of the only begotten of the father, full
[47:13] of grace and truth." Who is Jesus
[47:15] Christ? He is the word. He is the word
[47:17] that was made flesh.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we stick WITH THE WORD, WE
[47:20] STICK WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So what does it mean to leave the
[47:25] word?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; He is the word.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Let's look at this scripture. Matthew
[47:36] chapter 7 verse 21.
[47:40] Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[47:41] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
[47:43] heaven, but he that doeth the will of my
[47:46] father which is in heaven. Many will say
[47:49] to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we
[47:51] not prophesied in thy name? And in thy
[47:53] name have cast out devils, and in thy
[47:55] name done many wonderful works. And then
[47:58] will I profess unto them, I never knew
[48:00] you. Depart from me, ye that work
[48:04] iniquity.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You guys see this statement here?
[48:10] Ye that work iniquity.
[48:13] Why did he cast them out? Because of
[48:15] their iniquitous works.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, they've come to the white throne
[48:22] judgment. Nobody at the white throne
[48:23] judgment is lying.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody's standing in the presence of God
[48:27] and making things up.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Nobody's trying to pull the wool over
[48:34] Jesus Christ.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, he said, "Many will
[48:40] say to me that day, Lord, Lord, have we
[48:41] not prophesied in thy name?" Jesus never
[48:43] denied that they didn't do it.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; I believe they did.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz nobody's standing in the face of
[48:49] Jesus, Jud, supreme judge of heavens and
[48:51] earth, and lying to him.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And in thy name have cast out devils.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; I believe they did it.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; And in thy name done many wonderful
[49:01] works.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Many wonderful works. I believe they did
[49:05] it. Yeah.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't deny any of it. Neither did
[49:09] he judge them for that. Neither were
[49:10] they cast out for any of that.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "But depart from me, ye that
[49:17] work iniquity."
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Iniquity is when you know to do right
[49:22] and don't do it.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; WHY did Jesus say, "Depart from me. You
[49:29] you you that work iniquity." Iniquity
[49:32] was not prophesying in his name. was not
[49:34] casting out devils and was not the
[49:36] wonderful works.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; That was not the iniquity.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; The iniquity was something of the word
[49:42] of God they knew to do and didn't do it.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[49:48] &gt;&gt; they were iniquitous.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; They and they did miracles. They did
[49:54] signs and wonders. They did many
[49:56] wonders. And they prophesied in his
[49:58] name. And no doubt people were healed,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:02] And devils were cast out.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And maybe many people believed on the
[50:06] Lord through their works.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT JUDAS DID. JUDAS WENT OUT
[50:11] WHEN GOD commissioned them to go two by
[50:13] two. Judas went with them. AND THEY ALL
[50:15] COME BACK AND SAID, "THIS THE DEVILS
[50:17] WERE SUBJECT TO US. WE CAST OUT DEVILS
[50:18] and healed THE SICK AND AND AND AND
[50:20] Jesus says, "Oh, that's wonderful. BUT
[50:22] DON'T REJOICE THAT the devils ARE
[50:24] SUBJECT TO YOU. JOYCE rejoice that your
[50:25] names are written in heaven." But later,
[50:27] Judas would turn his back on Jesus, deny
[50:29] him, and sell him out. Yeah.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; He worked iniquity.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; HE DENIED THE WORD. HE DENIED THE LORD
[50:39] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BUT HE CAST OUT
[50:41] DEVILS AND HE HEALED THE SICK AND HE did
[50:43] many wonderful works.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; So listen friends, LET'S BRING THIS HOME
[50:49] TO US. AMEN. WE CAN DO ALL KINDS OF
[50:51] WONDERFUL THINGS. AMEN. BUT IF WE KNOW
[50:53] THE WORD SAYS DO SOMETHING AND WE DON'T
[50:55] DO IT, AMEN. THAT IS INIQUITY. AMEN.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be found in iniquity,
[51:01] but I want to be found in his word.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, what was the
[51:08] judgment for? Knowing to do right and
[51:11] not doing it.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Knowing the word and not obeying the
[51:14] word.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to 1st Samuel together.
[51:19] I want to look at this in 1st Samuel 15.
[51:26] We're going to look at the life of Saul,
[51:28] the first king of Israel.
[51:35] 1st Samuel 15 and 13.
[51:40] [snorts]
[51:42] 1st Samuel 15 and verse 13.
[51:46] And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said
[51:49] unto him, "Blessed be thou of the Lord.
[51:51] I have performed the commandment of the
[51:53] Lord. So there was a commandment given
[51:56] to Saul from Samuel from God to Samuel
[51:59] the prophet from the prophet to Saul the
[52:02] king. And that word was go and destroy
[52:05] the Amalachites. And the word was to
[52:07] utterly destroy the Amalachites.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Every man, woman, child, boy, girl,
[52:13] sheep, goat,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; chicken,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; everything.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Says spare nothing. And why? Because
[52:21] because the the scripture tells us when
[52:23] when God rescued his children out of
[52:25] Egypt and they were first come along the
[52:27] way. Amen. THEY WERE AMBUSHED AND
[52:29] ATTACKED BY THE Amalachites for no
[52:31] reason. And God DESTROYED THEM. BUT GOD
[52:34] MADE A PROMISE. I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT
[52:36] THE Amalachites did to my children along
[52:38] the way. IT WAS AN UNPROVOKED ATTACK for
[52:40] no reason whatsoever. And God promised
[52:42] he would wipe them off the map. Now it's
[52:44] time for God to KEEP HIS WORD. THAT WAS
[52:46] A prophecy through Moses. that word has
[52:48] to come to pass. Now, there's another
[52:50] prophet, amen, that's telling Saul, this
[52:52] is the time for the word of the Lord to
[52:54] come TO PASS. AND SAUL receives the word
[52:56] of the Lord from a prophet, rehearsing
[52:59] what another prophet, Moses said, God
[53:01] said.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; This is the word of the Lord. And the
[53:04] word OF THE LORD IS TO UTTERLY DESTROY
[53:06] THE AMALACHITES and leave nothing.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; And this is what Saul says.
[53:13] Saul says, Samuel came to Saul and Saul
[53:16] said unto him, "Blessed be thou of the
[53:18] Lord, I have performed the commandment
[53:20] of the Lord." And Samuel said, 'What
[53:23] meanest then this bleeding of the sheep
[53:25] in my ears, and the loing of the oxen
[53:28] which I hear? And Saul said, "They have
[53:32] brought them from," I love this. They
[53:36] &gt;&gt; He takes no responsibility.
[53:38] They have brought them from the
[53:39] Amalachites, for the people spared the
[53:41] best of the sheep out of the oxen to
[53:43] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God. And the
[53:45] rest we have utterly destroyed.
[53:48] Saul is standing here. Oh my goodness.
[53:51] He claims that he's obeyed the word, but
[53:53] the word was specific.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Utterly destroyed. Listen, 90% of
[53:58] obedience is not obedience.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; 95% OBEDIENCE IS not obedience. And here
[54:05] Saul saying, "I obeyed the commandment
[54:07] of the Lord." And what he did by his
[54:09] disobedience, listen, he broke the word
[54:12] because THERE WAS A PROPHECY come
[54:14] through Moses, a promise that he would
[54:15] destroy THE AMALACHITES. AND GOD ALWAYS
[54:18] WORKS through man. And God is using this
[54:20] man to perform the word. It's more than
[54:23] just his own choice. It's more than just
[54:25] him doing something, amen, OF HIS OWN
[54:28] THINKING. HE'S ACTUALLY BREAKING THE
[54:30] WORD. AMEN.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S ACTUALLY CAUSING THE THE WORD NOT
[54:34] TO COME TO FULFILLMENT. AMEN. AND THIS
[54:36] IS WHAT ANGERS THE LORD SO MUCH. AMEN.
[54:39] IS BECAUSE HE'S BREAKING THE WORD OF
[54:40] GOD.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; THIS ISN'T A SMALL MATTER. WELL, WE JUST
[54:44] SAVED WE JUST SAVED A little bit of this
[54:46] and WE JUST SAVED ONE MAN ALIVE, THE
[54:48] KING. WE JUST WE DIDN'T WE LISTEN, WE
[54:51] UTTERLY DESTROYED EVERYTHING, BUT WE
[54:52] JUST SAVED THESE little things. Listen,
[54:54] THOSE LITTLE THINGS WERE CONTRARY TO THE
[54:56] WORD OF GOD. AND GOD IS HIS WORD, AND
[54:58] YOU CANNOT BREAK THE WORD.
[55:01] AMEN.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And so he says they I love this.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; They This is like the Garden of Eden.
[55:09] Amen. He he asked Adam what happened.
[55:11] The wife thou gavest me.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, you just said she was bone of
[55:16] your bone and flesh of your flesh. SHE'S
[55:19] PART OF YOU. Don't don't give me that.
[55:23] He comes to the woman and she says WITH
[55:24] THE SERPENT BEG, IT'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY
[55:26] ELSE. NOBODY'S WILLING TO TAKE PERSONAL
[55:28] responsibility for their own actions.
[55:30] And here is here is SAUL SAYING THEY.
[55:32] AND I WOULD ASK SAUL, "WHO'S THE KING?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE ME THEY." IT'S LIKE A FATHER
[55:37] IN THE HOUSE. HIS HOUSE IS IN DISORDER.
[55:39] AND HE SAYS, "WELL, THEY LISTEN. YOU'RE
[55:41] THE DAD. GET YOUR HOME IN ORDER.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; They they they. AMEN. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE
[55:47] ALLOWED. SAUL ALLOWED IT."
[55:50] &gt;&gt; SO there's no blaming somebody else.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] So Saul in verse 15 says they have saved
[55:59] and listen they spared the best of the
[56:02] sheep and of the oxen and the rest to to
[56:05] sacrifice unto the Lord. They had a
[56:08] religious cloak
[56:10] &gt;&gt; for their own lust.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; This was a dangerous temptation.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; This was a very dangerous temptation.
[56:22] This was a great temptation.
[56:24] to do something that seemed right
[56:27] &gt;&gt; but for the wrong reasons.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with saving the best
[56:32] animals to sacrifice the Lord? We're
[56:34] going to worship. No, because God didn't
[56:37] tell you to do that.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; God told you to destroy them. You're
[56:40] you're exerting your own will for your
[56:42] own lust for your own reason and you're
[56:43] exerting your will over the will of God.
[56:45] That's wickedness.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't look wicked. It looks
[56:49] religious. But that religion was just a
[56:51] cloak for the lust of their own flesh.
[56:53] Yes, sir.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; We'll read this and find it out as we go
[56:55] on.
[56:57] He says verse 16, "And Samuel said unto
[56:59] Saul, stay." He's saying, "Hold still,
[57:03] and I will tell thee what the Lord has
[57:05] said to me this night." And he said unto
[57:07] him, "Say on." And Samuel said, "When
[57:10] thou was little in thine own sight, was
[57:12] thou not made the head of the tribes of
[57:13] Israel." And the Lord anointed thee king
[57:16] over Israel. And the Lord sent thee on a
[57:18] journey and said, "Go and utterly
[57:20] destroy the sinners, the Amalachites,
[57:21] and fight against them until they be
[57:23] consumed. Wherefore then did thou not
[57:26] obey the voice of the Lord, but did fly
[57:29] upon the spoil and did evil in the sight
[57:31] of the Lord?"
[57:33] &gt;&gt; God is cutting through his religious fig
[57:36] leaves
[57:37] &gt;&gt; and exposing his nakedness. You wanted
[57:40] the best of the sheep and the best.
[57:42] Don't give me that. You might have made
[57:44] a trivial token offering to the Lord,
[57:45] but you were trying to fly upon the
[57:47] spoil. The spoil is THE REWARD OF
[57:50] BATTLE, NOT FOR THE LORD, BUT FOR
[57:52] HIMSELF. AND God could see through his
[57:54] religious rhetoric.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And guess what, friends? IT DOESN'T
[57:57] MATTER HOW GOOD WE ARE AT repeating
[57:59] words and quoting the prophet and re
[58:00] reading scriptures. God can see through
[58:03] our religious rhetoric. If it's just
[58:05] rhetoric and not coming from the depths
[58:07] OF OUR SOUL, GOD KNOWS IT'S JUST A FIG
[58:09] leaf to him.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[58:17] &gt;&gt; He said
[58:19] ah
[58:22] he said wherefore verse 19 did thou obey
[58:24] the voice of the Lord but did fly upon
[58:26] the spoil and did evil in the sight of
[58:28] the Lord. And Saul said unto Samuel,
[58:30] "Yay, I have obeyed the voice of the
[58:33] Lord." He's trying to argue again.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I did what the word said. Yay, I obeyed
[58:39] the voice of the Lord.
[58:41] and have gone the way which the Lord
[58:43] sent me, and have brought Aag, the king
[58:46] of the of Amalecch, and have utterly
[58:48] destroyed the Amalachites. But the
[58:50] people took of the spoil. Who's the
[58:52] king?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Don't become a weakling.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; You were in charge. But the people took
[59:00] of the spoil sheep and oxen, the chief
[59:03] of the things which should have been
[59:04] utterly destroyed, to sacrifice
[59:06] [laughter] unto the Lord thy God in
[59:08] Gilgal. And Samuel said, "Hath the Lord
[59:10] as great delight in burnt offerings and
[59:13] sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of
[59:15] the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than
[59:19] sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
[59:21] of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of
[59:24] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[59:25] iniquity and idul. Because the Because
[59:29] thou hast rejected the word of the Lord,
[59:31] he hath also rejected thee from being
[59:34] king." Praise the Lord.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; WHY DID SAUL LOSE HIS POSITION? Because
[59:39] he left the word.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; HE REJECTED THE BIBLE. GOD SAID, "YOU
[59:44] REJECTED THE WORD."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS JUST MASSAGING THE
[59:48] WORD.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS JUST USING some
[59:51] reasoning, AND IN REASONING, WHY let all
[59:54] these wonderful uh wonderful beasts GO
[59:56] TO WASTE? WHY DON'T WE TAKE SOME AND
[59:58] SACRIFICE THEM TO THE LORD? AND NO
[1:00:00] DOUBT, SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT
[1:00:02] TO HIM. WHY DON'T WE SAVE THE BEST OF
[1:00:04] THE sheep and the best of the oxen?
[1:00:05] Amen. And he WOULD HAVE SAID, "OH,
[1:00:07] OKAY." BECAUSE HE SAID, "THEY said and
[1:00:08] and he gave him permission." BUT BUT BUT
[1:00:11] GOD SAID, "WHY DID YOU FLY UPON THE
[1:00:13] SPOIL? WHAT WAS IN YOUR LUSTFUL HEART?
[1:00:15] WHAT WERE YOU GREEDY FOR? WHY WERE YOU
[1:00:17] MAKING political moves with the people
[1:00:19] to APPEASE THEM? WHY WEREN'T YOU STAYING
[1:00:21] WITH MY WORD?"
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, wasn't it was the lust of
[1:00:24] the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
[1:00:26] PRIDE OF LIFE THAT GOT HIM. IT'S WHAT
[1:00:28] GOT EVERY ONE OF US. IT'S WHAT STILL
[1:00:30] GETS US. AMEN.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; It's the world and the things of the
[1:00:33] world. Amen. That got him. And he HAD A
[1:00:36] RELIGIOUS CLOAK AND HE WAS DOING THE
[1:00:37] WORD OF GOD. AND HE WAS IN THE SERVICE
[1:00:39] OF GOD AS THE KING OF GOD'S PEOPLE RIGHT
[1:00:41] IN THE MIDST OF THE CAMP OF GOD DOING
[1:00:43] WHAT GOD HAD ASKED HIM. BUT HE DID IT TO
[1:00:45] 95%. AND THERE WAS SOMETHING in him and
[1:00:48] something in the people that WOULD KEEP
[1:00:50] THEM FROM GOING ALL THE WAY WITH THE
[1:00:52] WORD. AND THAT IS WHEN THEY REJECTED THE
[1:00:54] LORD. And the Lord rejected him.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; SAID, "GOD, HELP ME. I DON'T WANT 95%. I
[1:01:00] WANT 100%. I WANT TO YIELD MYSELF
[1:01:03] ABSOLUTELY TO THIS WORD OF GOD. I DON'T
[1:01:05] WANT TO TWIST IT AND MASSAGE IT FOR MY
[1:01:07] OWN PURPOSE. I SAY, "GOD, HELP ME.
[1:01:09] EXPOSE ME TO ME."
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; EXPOSE THAT OLD NATURE THAT WANTS TO
[1:01:14] GRAB AND BRIDE AND THAT WANTS TO LOOK
[1:01:16] GOOD.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING US TO FAIL,
[1:01:21] FRIENDS, IS THAT DESIRE TO LOOK GOOD IN
[1:01:22] THE EYES OF OTHER PEOPLE. THAT DESIRE,
[1:01:24] THAT CRAVING TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.
[1:01:26] AMEN. THAT WE WANT. AMEN. IF IT'S
[1:01:28] CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD, LET THE
[1:01:30] CRAVING DIE.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Let it die.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me die to myself. This is
[1:01:39] why the Apostle Paul says, "I die
[1:01:42] daily."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Why did he have TO DIE DAILY? WHY DID HE
[1:01:46] HAVE TO KEEP UNDER his body to keep it
[1:01:48] in submission? That means to beat it
[1:01:50] bat, black and blue. Why did he have to
[1:01:51] do that? BECAUSE THE OLD STICKY COCKER
[1:01:53] NATURE, THE LUST of the flesh, the lust
[1:01:55] of the eyes, THE PRIDE OF LIFE. PAUL WAS
[1:01:57] CONTENDING WITH PAUL.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God help us to contend with
[1:02:04] ourselves.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; To keep the word of God.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I [snorts] want to look in contrast at
[1:02:13] David.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; From Saul to David.
[1:02:18] Acts 13:22 says, "And when he had
[1:02:21] removed him, he raised up unto them
[1:02:23] David to be their king, to whom also he
[1:02:25] gave testimony, and said, I have found
[1:02:27] David, the son of Jesse, a man after
[1:02:30] mine own heart, which shall fulfill all
[1:02:33] my will."
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; And in the book of Samuel,
[1:02:40] uh,
[1:02:42] when the book of Samuel, it stops here.
[1:02:45] He says, 'Ive found David, the son of
[1:02:47] Jesse, a man after my own heart.' But
[1:02:49] now when Stephen repeats this, when he's
[1:02:51] going to be stoned, he's in the
[1:02:52] Sanhedrin, and he's preaching to them
[1:02:54] the Bible, he adds this line, which
[1:02:58] shall fulfill all my will.
[1:03:02] What does it mean to be a man after
[1:03:03] God's own heart?
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; One that will fulfill his will.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:14] David was a man after God's own heart.
[1:03:15] Saul was not.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, Saul did many things God told
[1:03:21] him to do.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Saul had many victories. He led the army
[1:03:24] of the Lord into many battles and he won
[1:03:26] many victories and he did many things,
[1:03:29] but he didn't fully obey the word.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to raise up somebody
[1:03:34] after my own heart." What does it mean
[1:03:36] to be after God's own heart? To fulfill
[1:03:39] all his will.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; What is his will? His word is his will.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And listen, David wasn't a perfect human
[1:03:47] being.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; We all know of his sin with Basheba.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; We all know of his failure and his sin
[1:03:55] and the trying to cover it up and having
[1:03:58] Uzziah murdered and all the things that
[1:04:00] he did in that whole orchestra. So to
[1:04:03] me, when I look at this statement, I
[1:04:05] realize to be a man after God's own
[1:04:07] heart doesn't mean I have to be a
[1:04:08] perfect human being. because I'm not a
[1:04:11] perfect human being and it doesn't mean
[1:04:13] I'll never have failure in my life
[1:04:14] because I'm I will have failure in my
[1:04:16] life. I have failure constantly in my
[1:04:18] life. So to be a man after God's own
[1:04:21] heart doesn't mean I have to have
[1:04:23] perfect performance.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Because David didn't have perfect
[1:04:27] performance, but he was a man after
[1:04:28] God's own heart. But when David fell and
[1:04:31] the prophet came to him with the word of
[1:04:33] the Lord and gave him the story and
[1:04:35] says, "And you're the man." There was
[1:04:36] something in David that could say, "I
[1:04:38] have sinned before the Lord." He didn't
[1:04:40] say, "Well, Ba Sheba shouldn't have been
[1:04:42] on a rooftop and she should have pulled
[1:04:44] the curtains and if they would have just
[1:04:45] done WHAT I SAID." NO, THERE WAS NONE OF
[1:04:47] THAT.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART
[1:04:50] WHEN HE HAD FINALLY TO COME FACE TO FACE
[1:04:52] with the word AND THE WORD EXPOSED ALL
[1:04:54] OF HIS FIG LEAVES AND ALL OF HIS HIDING
[1:04:56] AND ALL OF HIS COMPROMISING. And when
[1:04:58] the word of the prophet family came to
[1:05:00] him and exposed HIM, HE SAID, "I HAVE
[1:05:02] SINNED BEFORE THE LORD. IT'S ME. I DID
[1:05:04] IT. I'M GUILTY. I'M WRONG.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And immediately the prophet said, "And
[1:05:10] God has forgiven you of your sins."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. HE DIDN'T LISTEN. GOD
[1:05:17] HAD FOUND A MAN AFTER HIS OWN HEART.
[1:05:19] WHAT IS A MAN AFTER his own heart? One
[1:05:21] that will do his will. What is his will?
[1:05:23] It's his word. Amen. To be after GOD'S
[1:05:25] OWN HEART. IS TO LOVE HIS word more than
[1:05:27] you love your feelings, MORE THAN YOU
[1:05:29] LOVE YOUR PLEASURES, MORE THAN YOU LOVE
[1:05:31] YOUR STATUS AND YOUR POSITION AND YOUR
[1:05:33] IMAGE. BUT TO LOVE GOD IS TO LOVE HIS
[1:05:36] WORD. TO LOVE HIS WORD IS TO love him.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT THAT SAUL DIDN'T LOVE HIM.
[1:05:42] SAUL LOVED HIMSELF MORE.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; THIS HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE ALL THROUGH
[1:05:45] THE BIBLE. IT WASN'T THAT THE PEOPLE
[1:05:47] DIDN'T LOVE GOD. IT'S THAT THEY LOVE
[1:05:49] THEMSELVES MORE. And they were willing
[1:05:50] to make THE WORD OF GOD FLEXIBLE FOR
[1:05:52] THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF MAKING THEMSELVES
[1:05:55] FLEXIBLE FOR THE WORD.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; BUT OH, PRAISE GOD. AMEN. THERE'S A
[1:05:59] STONE CUT OUT OF THE MOUNT WITHOUT
[1:06:01] HANDS, WHICH IS THE REVELATION OF JESUS
[1:06:03] CHRIST. And in THE END TIME, AMEN, IT'S
[1:06:05] GOING TO COME AND SMITE THE IMAGE. AMEN.
[1:06:07] THAT GENTILE WORLD POWER SYSTEM THAT'S
[1:06:09] MOVED TO THE RELIGION AND IT'S GOING TO
[1:06:11] SMITE IT AND IT'S GOING TO TURN INTO THE
[1:06:12] CHAFF OF WHEAT AND BLOW AWAY AND ALL
[1:06:15] THAT THIS STONE FALLS ON.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Which is the REVEALED WORD OF GOD. IT'LL
[1:06:20] DESTROY IT AND GRIND IT TO POWDER.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; But that HEADSTONE IS A CORNERSTONE. AND
[1:06:25] THE CORNERSTONE IS JESUS CHRIST, THE
[1:06:27] WORD OF GOD. AMEN. AND ALL OF US WHO
[1:06:30] FALL ON THAT STONE WILLINGLY LAY OUR
[1:06:32] LIVES DOWN AND FALL ON CHRIST WILL BE
[1:06:35] BROKEN TO PIECES. I WANT TO BE BROKEN TO
[1:06:38] PIECES. NOT DESTROYED BY THE WORD, BUT I
[1:06:40] WANT TO FALL ON THE WORD. AND I WANT TO
[1:06:42] BE BROKEN BY THE WORD so that the word
[1:06:44] can put me back together.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE BROKEN ON THE FOUNDATION
[1:06:49] STONE AND BUILT ON THAT FOUNDATION.
[1:06:51] BROKEN FROM WHAT I AM IN MY SIN NATURE.
[1:06:54] BROKEN FROM WHAT I AM AND MY MY HUMANITY
[1:06:56] BORN WRONG THROUGH TWO EARTHLY PARENTS
[1:06:58] BY SEXUAL DESIRE. I WANT THAT TO BE
[1:07:00] BROKEN. AND UPON THOSE BROKEN PIECES ON
[1:07:03] THE ROCK OF REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:07:06] ON THE WORD OF GOD, I WANT GOD TO BUILD
[1:07:08] THIS VESSEL BACK IN HIS IMAGE,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; ON THE FOUNDATION OF CHRIST, BUILT INTO
[1:07:13] THE IMAGE OF CHRIST. AND I WANT GOD TO
[1:07:15] CAP MY LOVE WITH HIS PERFECT LOVE.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; CAP MY LIFE WITH HIS CAPSTONE HIMSELF.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Resting on me.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't want to make the word
[1:07:25] flexible for me.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT EVERY DENOMINATION HAS DONE.
[1:07:29] THAT'S WHY THERE'S 40OME THOUSAND
[1:07:31] DENOMINATIONS. THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T
[1:07:33] LIKE THIS FIT. SO, I'LL FIND MY OWN FIT.
[1:07:35] I'LL FIND A FIT THAT FITS ME. STOP
[1:07:37] LOOKING FOR A FIT THAT FITS YOU.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; FIT THE WORD.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE DOING THE SAME THING WITH THE
[1:07:44] MESSAGE. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE
[1:07:46] MESSAGE PREACHER, THE MESSAGE CHURCH
[1:07:47] THAT'LL FIT THEM. STOP TRYING THE
[1:07:49] MESSAGE THAT FITS YOU. YOU FIT THE WORD.
[1:07:52] AMEN.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; AND IF IT SHAVES SOME OFF, LET IT FALL
[1:07:56] OFF.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M SO TIRED OF THIS IN MYSELF
[1:08:02] TRYING TO FIND A WAY. I DON'T WANT TO
[1:08:04] FIND A WAY. I DON'T WANT TO FIND WIGGLE
[1:08:06] ROOM OR WORKING ROOM. I WANT TO DIE TO
[1:08:08] MYSELF.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; That Christ can live in me.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How can Jesus Christ be
[1:08:18] manifest in this world if we're still uh
[1:08:21] serving the world
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; with the lust of the flesh, the lust of
[1:08:24] the eyes, and the pride of life?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He has no part in the world.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And he that loves the world and the
[1:08:32] things of the world
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; doesn't have the love of God.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; So, I need to hate those things.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I still find them all around me, but I
[1:08:41] don't love them.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not that I say, "Well, I
[1:08:44] never find uh lust of the flesh ever in
[1:08:46] me anymore." NO, I FIND IT ALL THE TIME.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT I say, "I've never found
[1:08:50] the pride of life lurking INSIDE OF ME."
[1:08:52] NO, I FIND IT ALL THE TIME. BUT I DON'T
[1:08:54] LOVE IT. I HATE IT. EVERY TIME IT'S
[1:08:57] EXPOSED TO ME, I HATE IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Because I have the love of God in my
[1:09:02] heart.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; So, I can't love the things of the
[1:09:05] world.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] Brother Bam says she the true bride so
[1:09:12] sold out to him that she uses no mind of
[1:09:14] her own. His mind of a course is his
[1:09:16] will and his will is his word.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; So simple. When I tell my children what
[1:09:22] I want him to do, they don't have to
[1:09:24] question what my will is.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; If I say, "Hey, can you please, you
[1:09:28] know, pick up the sticks and start a
[1:09:30] fire and burn them in the backyard?"
[1:09:31] They don't have to go out there and say,
[1:09:32] "I wonder what God's or dad's will is.
[1:09:38] I gave them my will.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; My will is my word.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, then they didn't
[1:09:44] do my will. If they found some other
[1:09:47] reason not to do it, they exerted their
[1:09:48] own will over my will.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; It's simple.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Let's keep looking at David. 1st Samuel
[1:09:57] 24.
[1:10:02] These next two passages of scripture is
[1:10:05] showing us the character that's inside
[1:10:07] David. We already established that
[1:10:09] David's not a perfect man and he doesn't
[1:10:11] have perfect performance,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but he is a man after God's own will.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He's a man after God's own heart that
[1:10:17] will do all his will.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] So David in 1st Samuel 24:3
[1:10:25] says, ' Then Saul took 3,000 chosen men
[1:10:27] out of the all Israel and went to seek
[1:10:29] David and his men upon the rocks of the
[1:10:31] wild goats and he came to the sheep
[1:10:33] coats. By the way, there was a cave and
[1:10:35] Saul went into cover his feet and David
[1:10:37] and his men remained in the side of the
[1:10:39] cave. Why were David and his men in the
[1:10:41] cave?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Because Saul was trying to kill David.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; SAUL WAS JEALOUS. HE WAS envious of
[1:10:47] David. And he had a bitter envy towards
[1:10:49] David because David's popularity amongst
[1:10:51] the people. Amen. So he was trying to
[1:10:53] kill him. He was chasing him from cave
[1:10:54] to cave to cave. SO SAUL WHO WAS A
[1:10:57] FATHER-IN-LAW TO DAVID. And David who
[1:10:58] had SERVED SAUL. SAUL NOW BEGINS to hate
[1:11:01] David and persecute David. And David's
[1:11:04] running away from Saul. And he runs into
[1:11:06] a cave in the side of the cave. And the
[1:11:08] cave that he's hiding in, Saul who's
[1:11:10] chasing him comes into the same cave.
[1:11:13] It's
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; a good story.
[1:11:18] And the men of David said unto him,
[1:11:20] "Behold the day of which the Lord said
[1:11:22] unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine
[1:11:25] enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest
[1:11:27] do to him, as it shall seem good unto
[1:11:29] thee." Then David arose and cut off the
[1:11:31] skirt of Saul's robe. I want you to stop
[1:11:34] for a minute. Don't read on, please.
[1:11:39] David's men tell him,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; "This is what God promised you."
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to become king. You're
[1:11:46] going to have victory over this. This is
[1:11:48] it. This is the fulfillment of that
[1:11:50] promise.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; See, listen. The temptation always has a
[1:11:54] religious tone.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; It has to to deceive the children of
[1:11:59] God. It has to be religious.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Has to do with the word.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And he he says David cut his skirt off
[1:12:09] of Saul wrote priv priv privately.
[1:12:12] Privy. And it came to pass after the
[1:12:14] word that David's heart afterward that
[1:12:17] David's heart smote him because he had
[1:12:19] cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto
[1:12:22] the men, "Lord forbid that I should do
[1:12:24] this thing unto my master, the Lord's
[1:12:25] anointed, to stretch forth my hand
[1:12:27] against him, seeing he is the anointed
[1:12:30] of the Lord." So David stayed his
[1:12:33] servants with his words and suffered
[1:12:34] them not to rise against Saul. But Saul
[1:12:37] rose up out of the cave and went on his
[1:12:39] way. And David also arose afterward and
[1:12:41] went out of the cave and cried after
[1:12:43] Saul, saying, "My Lord, the king." And
[1:12:45] when Saul looked behind him, David
[1:12:47] stooped with his face to the earth and
[1:12:49] bowed himself.
[1:12:51] My goodness, look at the humility of
[1:12:53] David. Listen, it wasn't David's love
[1:12:56] for Saul that smoteed his heart.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; It was his love for the Lord.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Because it was the Lord who chose Saul.
[1:13:06] It was the Lord who anointed Saul. It
[1:13:08] was Samuel who had poured anointing all
[1:13:10] over HIS HEAD. AT GOD'S BIDDING, GOD
[1:13:13] MADE HIS CHOICE and he was anointed. And
[1:13:15] that's what he means. God's anointed. He
[1:13:16] was anointed by THE PROPHET TO THE
[1:13:18] OFFICE OF KING. And David said, "How
[1:13:21] dare his heart smoked him because all HE
[1:13:23] DID WAS CUT OFF THE SKIRT." AMEN. LIKE
[1:13:25] HE didn't do anything real, really bad.
[1:13:29] BUT WHAT WAS HIS FRIENDS TELLING HIM?
[1:13:31] HIS FRIENDS were saying, "This is what
[1:13:33] God's been saying. This is the time.
[1:13:35] This is your deliverance. This is the
[1:13:36] promise." Amen. And they were trying to
[1:13:39] make it righteous for David to kill
[1:13:41] Saul.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; And David did a little disservice to
[1:13:46] him. And he went out and immediately
[1:13:49] listen, I don't know what DAVID'S
[1:13:52] AFFECTION TOWARDS SAUL WAS. IT WAS HIS
[1:13:54] FATHER-IN-LAW. HE'S MARRIED to his
[1:13:55] daughter. They had some relationship.
[1:13:57] But what smoteed him was that David
[1:13:59] loved the Lord.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart that
[1:14:03] do all his will. And if God willed that
[1:14:06] Saul was the king, who was David to take
[1:14:09] him out of his position?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; David loved the Lord more than he loved
[1:14:16] himself.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; This was a man who was being bitterly
[1:14:19] persecuted by Saul, chased away from his
[1:14:22] home, chased away from his wife, living
[1:14:24] in caves and dens and rocks and and
[1:14:26] running where the goat, it says, where
[1:14:27] the goats were.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Running and hiding from Saul all the
[1:14:31] time. Amen. This man's life was
[1:14:33] miserable because of Saul,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; but he would not touch the Lord's
[1:14:39] anointed
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; because that was the word of the Lord
[1:14:42] for that day.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go now down a couple chapters
[1:14:47] later to chapter 26 verse 7.
[1:14:52] This one, listen, this comes second. And
[1:14:55] I want you to watch. He's going to face
[1:14:57] this temptation again. This is the
[1:14:59] second time. and just watch. It's worse
[1:15:03] than the first.
[1:15:05] And in between these two times, there's
[1:15:07] a whole lot more chasing, a whole lot
[1:15:08] more threatening, a whole lot more
[1:15:10] misery.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Chapter 26:7.
[1:15:14] So David and Abashi came to the people
[1:15:18] by night. And behold, Saul lay sleeping
[1:15:21] within the trench, and his spear stuck
[1:15:22] in the ground at his bolster. But Abnner
[1:15:26] and the people lay round about him. Then
[1:15:28] said Abashi to David, God hath delivered
[1:15:31] thine enemy into thine hand this day.
[1:15:35] Now therefore, let me smite him,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I pray.
[1:15:41] Let me smite him, I pray thee, with the
[1:15:43] spear, even to the earth at once, and I
[1:15:45] will not smite him a second time.
[1:15:47] [laughter]
[1:15:49] I love this.
[1:15:51] Listen. They come in and they're all
[1:15:52] sleeping on the ground in this trench
[1:15:54] and and they sneak in and there's Saul
[1:15:57] with his spear stuck in the ground next
[1:15:58] to him and Abnner and his whole captain
[1:16:00] his host all around him and they're
[1:16:02] standing here and Abashai whispers in
[1:16:04] his ear. This is the Lord.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; This is your chance to be free. This
[1:16:10] look at God has delivered your enemy to
[1:16:12] you. Now I know you felt funny last
[1:16:14] time.
[1:16:16] So let me smite him.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And listen, I'll do IT ONCE AND QUICK.
[1:16:22] IT'LL BE OVER WITH. NO SUFFERING. YOU
[1:16:24] DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; This is what happens in our lives,
[1:16:30] friends.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; If you pass THE TEST ONCE, YOU MAY come
[1:16:35] around and find it again.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Only it's worse this time because David
[1:16:41] doesn't have to do the killing.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Saul doesn't have to suffer very long.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:49] Now, keep reading. It gets better.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Verse nine. And David said to Abashai,
[1:16:56] "Destroy him not. For who can stretch
[1:16:59] forth his hand against the Lord's
[1:17:00] anointed and be guiltless?"
[1:17:03] It wasn't that Saul wasn't guilty. And
[1:17:05] it's not that Saul wasn't worthy of
[1:17:07] death.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; David wasn't looking at Saul. He was
[1:17:12] looking at God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:14] He was not answering to Saul. He's
[1:17:16] answering to God.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; He was living a private life
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; in obedience to God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Verse 10, David said, "Furthermore, as
[1:17:27] the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite
[1:17:30] him. For his day shall come to die, or
[1:17:33] he shall descend into battle and perish.
[1:17:34] The Lord forbid that I should stretch
[1:17:36] forth my hand against the Lord's
[1:17:38] anointing. But I pray thee, take thou
[1:17:40] now the spear that is at his bolster,
[1:17:42] and the cruise of water, and let us go.
[1:17:45] And David took the spear and the cruise
[1:17:47] of water from Saul's bolster, and they
[1:17:48] got them away. And no man saw it, nor
[1:17:51] knew it, neither awaken, for they were
[1:17:53] all asleep, because a deep sleep from
[1:17:56] the Lord was fallen upon them.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; This was no ordinary sleep.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; There was an enchantment from God.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:08] He had he had sent down a sleeping
[1:18:11] spirit
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and there was a deep sleep. They would
[1:18:14] have never woke up. Listen,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; please listen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; God
[1:18:23] knocked him out cold.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; So that David could have kicked over the
[1:18:29] pale and tripped over Abnner's feet and
[1:18:32] fell on Saul
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; and he wouldn't have woke up.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God was testing David
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to see what kind of man David was.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And because God put him to sleep didn't
[1:18:46] reinforce what Abashai said.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, just because the circumstances
[1:18:52] seemingly work out, does not mean it's
[1:18:54] the will of God.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word of God and
[1:18:59] God still shows a sign or wonder, DON'T
[1:19:01] CHASE THE SIGN OR WONDER. STAY WITH THE
[1:19:02] WORD.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Don't chase emotion. DON'T CHASE
[1:19:07] FEELINGS. DON'T CHASE ALL THESE THINGS.
[1:19:08] YOU CAN PRAY AND PRAY AND PRAY AND PRAY
[1:19:10] YOURSELF INTO A FERVOR UNTIL YOU HAVE A
[1:19:13] DREAM.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER TOLD US THIS. YOU HAVE A DREAM
[1:19:16] BECAUSE YOUR DREAM IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS
[1:19:18] TRYING TO SORT OUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
[1:19:19] ABOUT ALL DAY. AND YOU'LL TAKE THE DREAM
[1:19:21] IS FROM THE LORD AND FOLLOW AFTER A
[1:19:23] DREAM AND LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; STAY WITH THE WORD.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; David had everything set UP AND LAID OUT
[1:19:30] FOR HIM. HE WAS ASLEEP, SPEAR STUCK IN
[1:19:32] THE GROUND BESIDE HIM. HE HAD THE THE
[1:19:34] RIGHT GUY ON HIS LEFT OF HIS LEFT SIDE
[1:19:36] WHISPERING in his ear.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. DEEP SLEEP.
[1:19:40] THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WAKE UP. YOU GOT
[1:19:41] ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. YOU GOT
[1:19:43] ABASHAI WHO'S GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU.
[1:19:44] HE'S GOING TO DO IT QUICKLY and clean.
[1:19:46] THE WHOLE THING'S OVER. EVERYTHING'S
[1:19:48] NICE, CLEAN, AND TIDY. AND GOD'S GOING
[1:19:49] TO MAKE SURE NOBODY'S GOING TO WAKE UP
[1:19:51] BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE
[1:19:53] OF DAVID.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; God may give you an opportunity.
[1:20:03] AND IT MAY WORK OUT SUPERNATURALLY.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Just to see what's inside of you.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word of God,
[1:20:18] leave it alone.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; I want to be like David, not like Saul.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; What do you think Saul would have done?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. WHAT DO YOU THINK SAUL would have
[1:20:26] done if he come up on a on a a a field
[1:20:29] and all David and his mighty men are
[1:20:31] asleep and you can kick the bucket and
[1:20:33] you can trip over Abashai's feet and you
[1:20:35] can fall on David. He never wakes up and
[1:20:37] his spear's laying there and and
[1:20:39] Abnner's off his left shoulder said the
[1:20:41] the Lord has delivered your enemy to
[1:20:42] you. What do you think Saul would have
[1:20:44] done?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; But listen at this stage David was also
[1:20:48] anointed of the Lord.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if HE WOULD HAVE KILLED DAVID,
[1:20:54] HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTRARY TO THE WORD
[1:20:56] of God. WHAT DO YOU THINK SAUL WOULD
[1:20:57] HAVE DONE? SAUL WAS CAUGHT UP IN PRIDE.
[1:20:59] THAT'S WHY HE HAD ENVY. SAUL WAS CAUGHT
[1:21:01] UP IN HIS POLITICAL SCHEMES TRYING TO
[1:21:03] HOLD ON TO POWER FOR HIS OWN PRIDE. HE
[1:21:05] WOULD HAVE SMOKED HIM CLEAN. ESPECIALLY
[1:21:07] IF ABNNER SAYS, "I DON'T EVEN YOU DON'T
[1:21:09] EVEN HAVE TO do it. I'll do it. Turn
[1:21:10] your back."
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That way you don't have to tell your
[1:21:13] daughter that's married to him that you
[1:21:14] did it. I'll do I'LL MAKE IT NICE,
[1:21:16] CLEAN, AND TIDY. I BELIEVE SAUL WOULD
[1:21:18] HAVE WENT FOR IT.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; YEAH. CUZ SAUL WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM
[1:21:20] WITH A JAVELIN MULTIPLE TIMES.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE SAUL. I WANT TO BE
[1:21:25] LIKE DAVID. I WANT TO BE A MAN AFTER
[1:21:27] GOD'S OWN HEART. I MAY MESS UP A
[1:21:29] THOUSAND TIMES, BUT WHEN I'M CONFRONTED
[1:21:31] WITH THE WORD, I WANT TO SAY, "I HAVE
[1:21:32] SIN. IT'S MY FAULT. I DID IT, AND I'M
[1:21:35] NOT HOLDING ANYBODY ELSE ACCOUNTABLE."
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T THINK JUST BECAUSE it worked
[1:21:44] out in an UNUSUAL WAY, THAT'S GOD GIVING
[1:21:47] you permission to leave his word. Yeah.
[1:21:49] Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; God might just be testing you to prove
[1:21:59] what's inside of you.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Brother said God loves to prove his
[1:22:02] children.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He loves to test him. He loved to test
[1:22:06] what was inside of Job.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew just what he was doing and
[1:22:12] he knew what Job could take. And he had
[1:22:14] confidence in Job. AND HE LOVED to test
[1:22:16] him to prove that Job's not going to
[1:22:18] fail me. He's not going to sin against
[1:22:19] me with his mouth. Amen. He's not going
[1:22:21] to forsake my word. He may get all kinds
[1:22:23] of confused. He may even say some things
[1:22:25] that he regrets saying, but he's not
[1:22:27] going to leave my word.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; God loves to test his children.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And God's going to prove what's inside
[1:22:36] of us.
[1:22:38] And listen, we're all going to get a
[1:22:40] chance.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; We'll all get a chance to prove what's
[1:22:43] in us.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; And we need to determine right now, I'm
[1:22:47] going to stay with this word if it kills
[1:22:49] me.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I
[1:22:54] serve him."
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, yet will I GIVE HIM
[1:22:58] MY LIFE. I'VE LOST MY CHILDREN. I'VE
[1:23:00] LOST EVERYTHING. I'VE LOST MY WEALTH.
[1:23:02] I'VE LOST PRESTIGE. I'VE LOST THE LUST
[1:23:05] OF THE FLESH. I'VE LOST THE THE LUST OF
[1:23:07] THE EYES. I'VE LOST THE PRIDE OF LIFE.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE JOB WAS. HE LOST IT ALL.
[1:23:12] HE LOST HIS MATERIAL GOODS. HE LOST THE
[1:23:14] DESIRE OF HIS HEART. HE LOST HIS
[1:23:16] CHILDREN. HE LOST HIS PRESTIGE AMONGST
[1:23:18] THE COMMUNITY.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And he says, AND HE EVEN LOST RESPECT
[1:23:24] WITH HIS WIFE.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; You can't hardly get any lower than Job
[1:23:29] was.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Though he slay me, yet
[1:23:32] will I serve him." Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Friends,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; in the message leadership,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; it says in Shreport last week, week
[1:23:42] before last, at a businessman's meeting,
[1:23:45] a breakfast there where several hundreds
[1:23:47] of people had gathered, I took two and a
[1:23:49] half hours to speak on doing God a
[1:23:51] service without it being God's will.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds strange, but we've got
[1:23:55] to channel ourselves into God's provided
[1:23:57] channel and God's way of doing it. No
[1:23:59] matter how much we think it's right,
[1:24:00] it's got to be according to the word of
[1:24:02] the Lord or it's in vain.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Cain worshiped, but it wasn't according
[1:24:06] to the word of the Lord.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; He the Pharisees worshiped but not
[1:24:10] according to the word of the Lord.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Brandham was
[1:24:15] preaching uh uh doing God a service
[1:24:18] without being his will, he went back
[1:24:19] into the Old Testament to the life of
[1:24:21] David, DAVID HAD A DESIRE TO BRING THE
[1:24:24] ARK of the covenant out of the enemy's
[1:24:25] camp and back into Israel. HE WANTED THE
[1:24:28] WORD BECAUSE WHAT WAS IN THAT ARK? IT
[1:24:30] REPRESENTED THE PRESENCE of God because
[1:24:31] in there was the ten commandments, God's
[1:24:33] original word to his people.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTED TO BRING THE WORD BACK.
[1:24:37] ALSO, THE BOOK OF ORDINANCE WAS THERE
[1:24:39] AND HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THE WORD BACK
[1:24:40] TO BRING THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO
[1:24:43] the camp.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That's a good thing.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; How many agree that's a good thing?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; David wanted to do a good thing.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; HIS DESIRE WAS RIGHT. AMEN. HIS TIMING
[1:24:53] WAS EVEN RIGHT. HE WAS IT WAS TIME TO DO
[1:24:55] IT. HE WANTED TO DO IT. HE WAS THE KING.
[1:24:58] EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But he didn't do it according to the
[1:25:02] word.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD COMMANDED THROUGH MOSES that
[1:25:07] the Levites will bear the ark on their
[1:25:09] shoulder. Amen. AND AND DAVID DECIDED
[1:25:12] WHEN CONSULTING WITH THE CAPTAINS OF
[1:25:14] thousands and the captains of hundreds,
[1:25:15] HE NEVER CONSULTED WITH THE PROPHET.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T CONSULT THE WORD. AND THEY ALL
[1:25:21] SAID, "YES, IT'S A GREAT IDEA. YES,
[1:25:23] LET'S DO IT." AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE
[1:25:24] LINES, THEY GOT AN IDEA. LET'S PUT IT ON
[1:25:26] AN OX CART.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Who was the last ones to put it on an ox
[1:25:34] cart? It was the Philistines.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Right.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; The Philistines put it on an ox cart.
[1:25:41] That's where that idea come from.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Not from the word of God, but from
[1:25:45] another church system.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So now he says, "LET'S JUST DO WHAT WE
[1:25:51] SAW LAST TIME. LAST TIME IT GOT HERE,
[1:25:52] how did IT GET HERE? IT GOT HERE ON AN
[1:25:54] OX CAR. LET'S PUT IT ON ANOTHER OX CAR.
[1:25:56] IT WORKED LAST TIME.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; THAT MAY WORK FOR THE PHILISTINES TO GET
[1:26:00] THE WORD OUT OF THE PHILISTINES CAMP AND
[1:26:02] BACK TO THE EDGE OF ISRAEL. BUT THAT'S
[1:26:04] NOT GOING TO WORK TO BRING THE WORD, THE
[1:26:05] PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THE CAMP, BACK
[1:26:07] INTO JERUSALEM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT
[1:26:09] WORD BY WORD, OBEDIENCE to the word. AND
[1:26:12] WHEN THEY PUT IT ON AN OX CART, AMEN,
[1:26:14] THE OX BEGAN TO STUMBLE. THE ARK BEGAN
[1:26:16] TO ROCK. AND ONE MAN PUT HIS HAND ON IT
[1:26:18] TO STEADY IT, AND HE WAS SMITTEN DEAD
[1:26:20] INSTANTLY. WHY? BECAUSE sin brings
[1:26:23] death.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS LETTING DAVID KNOW, YOU GOT THE
[1:26:27] RIGHT IDEA. YOU GOT THE RIGHT MOTIVE AND
[1:26:30] OBJECTIVE. AMEN. BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT
[1:26:32] ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, you and I CAN HAVE THE RIGHT
[1:26:36] IDEA, THE RIGHT DESIRE, THE RIGHT MOTIVE
[1:26:38] AND OBJECTIVE. BUT WE BETTER CONSULT
[1:26:40] WITH THE PROPHET FOR THIS DAY TO FIND
[1:26:42] OUT WHAT THE WORD FOR THIS DAY IS SO
[1:26:44] THAT WE DO IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE TO GET OFF THE WORD WILL BRING
[1:26:48] DEATH.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:50] AMEN.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Help us, God.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Stay with this word.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "And notice Cain, he
[1:27:00] didn't want no blood sacrifice."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; He came down and offered the fruit or
[1:27:04] the fields of beauty upon his altar.
[1:27:07] Very religious.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Done everything that just exactly like
[1:27:11] Abel done offered a sacrifice. FELL DOWN
[1:27:14] BEFORE GOD IN WORSHIP. Obedient in every
[1:27:16] way, but without the revelation of the
[1:27:18] word. And the word was from the
[1:27:20] beginning God's plan.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; But God revealed by revelation the very
[1:27:24] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[1:27:26] that it was right. Not religion, not an
[1:27:30] altar, not belonging to church, not
[1:27:32] making a sacrifice, not being sincere,
[1:27:34] but by the revelation of the word.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; By faith, Abel offered a MORE EXCELLENT
[1:27:40] SACRIF. FAITH IN WHAT?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; FAITH IN THE WORD. SOMETHING WAS
[1:27:44] REVEALED TO HIM. WHAT WAS REVEALED? IT
[1:27:46] WAS THE WORD OF GOD. GOD'S DESIRE FOR
[1:27:48] THE RIGHT KIND OF SACRIFICE. A BLOOD
[1:27:50] ATONEMENT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD
[1:27:52] WORK. HOW DID HE GET THAT REVELATION? IT
[1:27:54] WAS THE WORD OF GOD. IT'S WHAT GOD DID
[1:27:56] TO COVER THE SINS OF HIS CHILDREN when
[1:27:58] they fell in Eden. AND NOW THAT
[1:27:59] REVELATION CAME TO ABEL AND ABEL BY
[1:28:02] FAITH. FAITH IN WHAT? FAITH IN THE WORD.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Offered a more excellent sacrifice.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; THEN WHEN GOD TELLS CAIN IN HIS MERCY
[1:28:12] SAY, "LISTEN, if you'll just do like
[1:28:14] your brother does, won't want TO BE WELL
[1:28:15] WITH YOU." HE EVEN TOLD CAIN, "JUST
[1:28:17] REPEAT WHAT YOU SEEN YOUR brother do,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL ACCEPT YOU." BUT CAIN COULDN'T
[1:28:23] RECEIVE THE REVELATION OF THE WORD. HE
[1:28:25] THOUGHT HIS IDEA WAS BETTER.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; AND HIS IDEA WASN'T BAD.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And his idea wasn't evil.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And his desire wasn't wickedness.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; What was Cain trying to do? worship.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; He was trying to worship God.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; What did Cain want to do? He wanted to
[1:28:48] find acceptance with God.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship God.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He He wanted to find pleasure with God
[1:28:56] so God would find pleasure with him.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; He wanted to. And listen, Cain wasn't
[1:29:02] just trivial in what he did. Cain worked
[1:29:04] and labored to bring the fruits of the
[1:29:06] field.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. his work of his hands, the labor
[1:29:09] that he labored for, and he was bringing
[1:29:11] it to the Lord.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He wanted to worship the true God
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; at the appointed time
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; in the right place.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; But he didn't do it according to the
[1:29:22] word.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And his offering wasn't bad because
[1:29:26] first fruits will become a good
[1:29:28] offering.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; First fruits are a good offering, but
[1:29:31] you can't come to first fruits till you
[1:29:33] come through the blood,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; through atonement. Yeah.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; His works did him no good that he
[1:29:37] offered to God until he first had the
[1:29:39] atonement.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; So Cain's temptation was not to do
[1:29:44] something evil, but to do something
[1:29:46] good, but not according to the word.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; David's temptation was to do something
[1:29:53] good, but not according to the word.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; I hope we're finding
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; how dangerous this world is.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, our security doesn't come from
[1:30:04] coming to church. That's right.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Our security can't come from being with
[1:30:08] a good group of people or even hearing
[1:30:10] the truth. Our security has to come from
[1:30:12] the fact that we have a relationship
[1:30:14] with a heavenly father. And if I get out
[1:30:16] of line, he'll correct me with his word.
[1:30:17] He'll reveal his word to me. He won't
[1:30:19] let me go wrong. And I've got a desire
[1:30:21] in my heart to take his word. And when
[1:30:22] he exposes me, I say, "It's me, Lord.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I'm wrong. Yes sir.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He says here I spoke here in Shreport
[1:30:31] the other day on a national broadcast
[1:30:33] across the nation that trying to do God
[1:30:34] a service without it being his God's
[1:30:36] will. David tried to bring the ark of
[1:30:38] God back into the house. He was anointed
[1:30:41] king. Why he consulted his delegates his
[1:30:43] captains of thousands 1000 thousands and
[1:30:44] so forth. They said that's the word of
[1:30:46] the Lord. And he consulted the priests.
[1:30:48] That was wonderful. And they all got so
[1:30:49] inspired. They shouted. They done every
[1:30:51] religious act that was. And they was
[1:30:53] absolutely contrary to God's will
[1:30:55] because there was a prophet in the land
[1:30:57] by the name of Nathan and he wasn't even
[1:30:59] consulted about it. And we found out it
[1:31:02] didn't work though. They were sincere
[1:31:04] trying to do God a service. And you can
[1:31:07] be ever so sincere, but until we know
[1:31:09] what we're doing, you're fighting at the
[1:31:11] air. Come back into the word of God and
[1:31:13] get lined up and then go. Then you know
[1:31:16] like a soldier don't know what to do
[1:31:17] until he gets orders to do it. We must
[1:31:19] be Christian soldiers and get orders
[1:31:21] from the Bible for this hour now. Not
[1:31:24] the charge yesterday, the charge the day
[1:31:26] before, but the charge today. Which way
[1:31:28] we go? Find out the hour that we're
[1:31:30] living in.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In Matthew 16.
[1:31:37] Oh man, I'm going to black this out.
[1:31:40] Matthew 16 is a very famous chapter for
[1:31:42] us because in Matthew chapter 16, JESUS
[1:31:45] STARTS TO ASK, "WHO DO MEN SAY that I
[1:31:47] am?
[1:31:48] And they say, "Well, some says that are
[1:31:50] Elias. Some says they're Jeremiah. Some
[1:31:52] says this prophet or that." But he
[1:31:54] Jesus, listen, this is the most
[1:31:55] important question.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; But who do you say that I am?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And all OF A SUDDEN, PETER SPOKE UP BY
[1:32:04] INSPIRATION.
[1:32:05] He said, "Thou art Christ, the son of
[1:32:07] the living God."
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Blessed art thou Simon
[1:32:12] Barjonah, for flesh and blood have not
[1:32:13] revealed this thing to you, but my
[1:32:15] father which is heaven has revealed it
[1:32:17] to you. And upon this rock I'll build my
[1:32:19] church.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, Peter just got a direct
[1:32:25] revelation from heaven.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Of who Jesus Christ was. Not nobody
[1:32:29] taught it to him. Not nobody explained
[1:32:31] it to him. And not that he figured it
[1:32:33] out.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; But the father told him.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; And under inspiration, he knew you are
[1:32:39] the son of God. They are Christ, the son
[1:32:41] of the living God.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] And then right after that, Jesus starts
[1:32:48] to tell them,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; this is the next verse, friends.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; From that time forth began Jesus is
[1:32:55] showing to his disciples how that he
[1:32:57] must go into Jerusalem and suffer many
[1:32:59] things of the elders and chief priests
[1:33:00] and scribes and be killed and be raised
[1:33:03] again the third day.
[1:33:05] Then Peter, same person,
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; took him and began to rebuke him,
[1:33:10] saying, "Be it far from thee, Lord. This
[1:33:12] shall not be unto thee." But he turned
[1:33:14] and said unto Peter, "Get thee behind
[1:33:16] me, Satan. Thou [clears throat] art an
[1:33:18] offense to me, for thou savorest not the
[1:33:20] things that be of God, but those that be
[1:33:23] of men."
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe Peter loved the Lord?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; With all my heart, I believe Peter loved
[1:33:31] the Lord.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; But Peter just under inspiration
[1:33:35] declared that you're the Christ, the son
[1:33:37] of the living God. And that Christ, son
[1:33:39] of the living God, starts to bring the
[1:33:41] word for their age. Yeah.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; And starts to tell them by prophesying
[1:33:46] what's getting ready to happen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And he's telling them the same one he
[1:33:50] declares to be Christ, the son of the
[1:33:52] living God. Begins to show his disciples
[1:33:54] that he's got to go to Jerusalem and
[1:33:56] suffer many things of the elder and the
[1:33:58] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[1:33:59] and be raised again. Listen, what he's
[1:34:01] giving Peter is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; He's giving him the word, the word for
[1:34:05] the hour that they live, what's about to
[1:34:07] happen next. and Peter and his zeal and
[1:34:10] HIS LOVE FOR GOD AND HIS LOVE FOR
[1:34:13] HIMSELF.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; HE BEGINS TO TAKE Jesus and rebuke HIM
[1:34:18] AND SAY, "FAR BE IT FROM THEE FOR
[1:34:19] SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN TO THEE."
[1:34:21] AND Jesus sees through Peter and he sees
[1:34:25] the spirit that is anointing Peter AND
[1:34:27] HE SAYS, "SATAN, GET BEHIND ME."
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; PETER WASN'T SATAN. PETER WAS A MAN WITH
[1:34:33] A LOVE FOR GOD. BUT THERE WAS SOME LUST
[1:34:35] OR PRIDE OR SOMETHING IN PETER THAT THE
[1:34:37] DEVIL COULD WORK ON. PETER DIDN'T WANT
[1:34:39] THIS MINISTRY TO END. HE didn't want
[1:34:41] Jesus to go away. He didn't want these
[1:34:42] things to happen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; But if HE REALLY LOVED GOD, HE WOULD
[1:34:46] WANT WHATEVER GOD SAID. IF GOD SAYS
[1:34:48] YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, THAT'S WHAT WE
[1:34:49] WANT.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD. NOT
[1:34:52] THAT I WANT IT TO HAPPEN, BUT I WANT
[1:34:54] GOD'S WORD MORE THAN I WANT MY FEELINGS.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Get thee behind me, Satan.
[1:35:03] and thou are an offense to me.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; FOR THOU SAVOREST NOT THE THINGS THAT BE
[1:35:07] OF GOD. WHAT BE OF GOD? GOING INTO
[1:35:10] JERUSALEM, BEING EVILLY TREATED BY THE
[1:35:12] ELDERS, AND BEING KILLED, AND RAISED THE
[1:35:13] THIRD DAY. THAT'S OF GOD.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; AND PETER COULDN'T IMAGINE THIS BEING OF
[1:35:17] GOD.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY. WE'VE GOT A GREAT
[1:35:20] REVIVAL. I JUST FOUND OUT WHO YOU ARE.
[1:35:22] WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE KINGDOM,
[1:35:23] AND I'M GOING TO BE YOUR RIGHT-HAND MAN.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You think Peter wanted all that to come
[1:35:31] crashing down?
[1:35:33] No. So that's where the devil had
[1:35:35] entrance
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; to the pride of life,
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; to his human affections.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Thou savorst not the
[1:35:44] things that be of God." Because the
[1:35:46] things that be of God is the will of
[1:35:47] God.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; But you savor those that be of men,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh,
[1:35:55] pride of life. Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God
[1:36:01] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:36:04] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[1:36:06] the dividing aunderder of soul and
[1:36:08] spirit and of the joints and the
[1:36:10] marorrow, and is a discerner of the
[1:36:13] thoughts and intents of the heart."
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; What's discerning your heart?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; The word.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:25] How is the word discerning my heart?
[1:36:27] Listen, when the word comes,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; how you react to that word is discerning
[1:36:34] your heart.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; When the word of God comes forth and is
[1:36:40] vindicated and proved for this
[1:36:42] generation through a prophetic ministry,
[1:36:44] bringing out the truth of this scripture
[1:36:46] for the hour we're living.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And that word comes unto you. The way
[1:36:51] you handle that word proves what's
[1:36:53] inside of your heart.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; If the word of God through this prophet
[1:37:00] in the end time, if it strips you of
[1:37:04] your religious covering,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and you try to hold on to it,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; the word is discerning your heart.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; If this word, Amen. begins to expose,
[1:37:16] Amen. your religious rhetoric, but you
[1:37:18] want to keep the religious rhetoric and
[1:37:20] not come to the word. The word is
[1:37:22] discerning your heart.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, when this word comes to put you
[1:37:28] in your right position in place, but you
[1:37:31] want to keep the position you have and
[1:37:32] not forsake it for another position.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Then the word is discerning your heart.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you don't love God.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you're not sincere. And
[1:37:45] it doesn't mean you don't really want to
[1:37:46] serve God, but there's still something
[1:37:48] of self that's being mixed in.
[1:37:51] [clears throat]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what's got to die.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read a couple more
[1:37:56] scriptures as we wind down. He says here
[1:37:59] in Matthew 6, "Take heed that you do not
[1:38:01] your arms before men to be seen of them.
[1:38:04] Otherwise, you have no reward of your
[1:38:05] father which is in heaven. Therefore,
[1:38:07] when thou doest thine arms, do not sound
[1:38:09] a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites
[1:38:11] do in the synagogues and in the streets,
[1:38:13] that they may give have glory of men.
[1:38:15] Verily, I say unto you, they have their
[1:38:18] reward.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; That's not the reward I'm after.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; To be seen of men and acknowledge as a
[1:38:30] good person in the eye. That's not the
[1:38:32] reward I want.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be pleasing to my father.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to enter his gates. I want
[1:38:37] to be part of his kingdom. I want to bow
[1:38:39] at his feet.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I want to be rewarded with eternal life
[1:38:42] with my maker.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; But when thou doest thou alms, let not
[1:38:46] thy left hand know what thy right hand
[1:38:48] doeth, that thine arms may that thy arms
[1:38:50] may be in secret, and thy father which
[1:38:52] seeth in secret himself shall reward
[1:38:54] thee openly.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be
[1:38:59] as the hypocrites are. They love to pray
[1:39:01] standing in the synagogues and in the
[1:39:02] corners of the streets that they may be
[1:39:04] seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they
[1:39:06] have their reward.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; There it is again.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; But thou, when thou prayest, enter into
[1:39:13] thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy
[1:39:15] door, pray to the father which is in
[1:39:17] secret, and the father which seeth in
[1:39:19] secret shall reward thee openly.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's the reward I want.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again
[1:39:26] he says, "Woe unto you scribes and
[1:39:29] Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like
[1:39:32] whited supplicers, which indeed appear
[1:39:34] beautiful outward, but are within full
[1:39:36] of dead men's bones and of all
[1:39:37] uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly
[1:39:40] appear righteous unto men, but within
[1:39:42] you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
[1:39:46] Who's saying this to them? Jesus. Who's
[1:39:49] he saying it to? The most religious
[1:39:51] people in his day.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. the most religious to the tops of
[1:39:55] the religion AND THEY WERE PART OF THE
[1:39:56] TRUE RELIGION.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; They weren't false. He wasn't saying
[1:40:00] it's the Philistines and Canaanites AND
[1:40:02] EGYPTIANS. HE WAS TALKING TO JEWS WHO
[1:40:04] HAD the word of the Lord, who were
[1:40:05] oracles of God.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; And he's telling them, you you use this
[1:40:10] religion to look good on the outside.
[1:40:12] You stand and YOU GIVE BIG PRAYERS. YOU
[1:40:14] BLOW A TRUMPET. YOU GIVE ARMS. YOU
[1:40:16] BROADEN YOUR FELACTORIES. YOU YOU LOOK
[1:40:18] LIKE YOU'RE great men. You give great
[1:40:20] swelling words and speeches. But but THE
[1:40:22] SAME VOICE THAT WALKED in the garden of
[1:40:26] Eden that knew that that that that could
[1:40:28] see through the fig leaves of Adam was
[1:40:30] the same one walking amen in Judea that
[1:40:33] day who could see through the fig leaves
[1:40:35] of the Pharisees.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; They could see through the arms paying.
[1:40:39] They could SEE THROUGH THE LOUD PRAYERS.
[1:40:40] They could see through the broad
[1:40:42] garments and the
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; He could see through it all.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And he realized their heart was far from
[1:40:48] gone.
[1:40:50] They gave appearance. How did he know
[1:40:53] it? Because he was the word.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And they were rejecting the word but
[1:40:58] keeping their religion.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Who are they keeping it for? For
[1:41:03] themselves.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah says, "But oh Lord of hosts
[1:41:12] that judgeth righteously, that tryth the
[1:41:14] reigns and the heart."
[1:41:18] God's not judging your outward
[1:41:20] appearance.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; God wasn't judging the outside of the
[1:41:24] Pharisees. He was judging the inside.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; How did he know the inside was dirty?
[1:41:30] Because he was there, the word of God,
[1:41:32] the fulfillment of the prophecy. He was
[1:41:34] the word made flesh. He said, "You
[1:41:36] believe in Moses. If you believe in
[1:41:37] Moses, you'd believe in me. For Moses
[1:41:38] wrote of me,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and they denied him, claiming still to
[1:41:42] believe Moses."
[1:41:44] And he knew inside you're rotten
[1:41:47] because I'm giving you the word. I'm
[1:41:49] giving you the truth.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "You say your father's Abraham,
[1:41:54] your father's the devil. He's a liar.
[1:41:56] Was a liar from the beginning and to try
[1:41:57] to destroy the truth." Abraham, you say
[1:42:00] Abraham's your father. I'm a man who's
[1:42:02] told you the truth and you seek to
[1:42:03] destroy my life. This Abraham didn't do.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID ABRAHAM DO? ABRAHAM BELIEVED
[1:42:10] GOD.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED A LIVING GOD AND GOD
[1:42:13] GAVE HIM THE WORD FOR THE HOUR HE WAS
[1:42:14] LIVING, HE BELIEVED GOD.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; NOW, HERE IS GOD IN THE FORM OF JESUS
[1:42:19] CHRIST GIVING THE WORD FOR THEIR DAY.
[1:42:21] AND THEY DISBELIEVE the word. THEY
[1:42:23] DISBELIEVE GOD AND CLAIM TO BE CHILDREN
[1:42:25] OF ABRAHAM. HE SAID, "IF YOU WERE
[1:42:27] CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM, YOU WOULD LOVE ME
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I CAME FROM GOD." WHAT YOU'RE
[1:42:33] DOING IS NOT WHAT YOUR FATHER DOES.
[1:42:35] YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES. SO YOU
[1:42:37] HAVE A DIFFERENT FATHER. YOU'VE GOT THE
[1:42:39] SAME FATHER THAT'S ALWAYS RESISTED THE
[1:42:41] WORD. THE ONE WHO RESISTED IN NOAH'S
[1:42:43] DAY. THE ONE WHO RESISTED IN MOSES DAY.
[1:42:45] THE ONE WHO RESISTED IT IN JEREMIAH'S
[1:42:47] DAY. YOU'VE GOT THE SAME ANOINTING ON
[1:42:49] YOU TO RESIST THE LIVING WORD. SO YOUR
[1:42:52] FATHER IS THE SAME FATHER OF THOSE THAT
[1:42:53] RESISTED IN EVERY OTHER DAY. YOUR
[1:42:55] FATHER'S THE DEVIL.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE DOING? THE WORD OF GOD BEING
[1:42:59] MANIFEST IN THAT HOUR WAS DISCERNING THE
[1:43:01] HEARTS.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE FIND? RELIGIOUS LEADERS THAT
[1:43:06] WERE CORRUPT INSIDE, LOOK GOOD ON THE
[1:43:08] OUTSIDE, BUT HE FOUND A PROSTITUTE THAT
[1:43:10] WAS CORRUPT ON THE OUTSIDE THAT HAD
[1:43:12] SOMETHING DEEP WITHIN THAT WAS HUNGERING
[1:43:14] FOR A LIVING GOD,
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; FOR A REAL GOD, FOR THE TRUE GOD.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And when SHE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE
[1:43:21] SAME THING THE PHARISEES AND JOHN 8 CAME
[1:43:23] IN CONTACT WITH, SHE SAID, "WE KNOW
[1:43:25] MESSIAH WILL DO THESE THINGS.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW MESSIAH'S COMING, AND WHEN HE
[1:43:28] COMES, HE'LL DO THESE SAME THINGS." HE
[1:43:30] SAID, "I am he that speaketh to you."
[1:43:32] SHE DROPPED HER WATER POT. SHE DIDN'T GO
[1:43:34] READ.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; She didn't GO GET AN EDUCATION. SHE
[1:43:38] DIDN'T GO REASON. SHE RAN INTO THE CITY
[1:43:40] AND SAID, "COME SEE A MAN THAT TOLD ME
[1:43:42] ALL THINGS THAT I'VE EVER DONE IS NOT
[1:43:44] THIS TO CHRIST."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; She accepted it immediately.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T FIGHT IT. SHE DIDN'T RESIST
[1:43:51] IT. THEY WERE CLEAN ON THE OUTSIDE,
[1:43:53] DIRTY ON THE INSIDE. SHE WAS DIRTY ON
[1:43:55] THE OUTSIDE, BUT PURE ON THE INSIDE. IN
[1:43:58] HER SOUL, SHE HAD SOMETHING SHE COULD
[1:44:00] BELIEVE the word with. AMEN.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; AND IT TESTIFIED THAT SHE was righteous.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT HARLOT WOMAN COME along to
[1:44:12] WASH JESUS'S FEET, WHERE WAS JESUS? HE
[1:44:14] WAS IN SIMON'S HOUSE. THE PRIEST,
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; but the priest invited him, but didn't
[1:44:21] welcome him.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't wash his feet.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Didn't anoint him with oil. Didn't greet
[1:44:28] him with a kiss. They just let him sit
[1:44:30] in the corner with dirty feet.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; But there WAS A HARLOT WOMAN, A
[1:44:35] PROSTITUTE.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The devil says she if he knew what
[1:44:40] manner of woman this was. Another place
[1:44:42] it says her sins were many.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; If he knew what manner of woman this, he
[1:44:46] wouldn't let her wash his feet. She ran
[1:44:48] in THERE WITH AN ALABASTER BOX FULL OF
[1:44:50] OINTMENT AND BROKE IT ON HIS FEET. BEGIN
[1:44:52] TO WEEP UPON HIS FEET AND CRY AT HIS
[1:44:54] FEET. WHAT WAS IT? SOMETHING INSIDE OF
[1:44:57] HER WAS RECOGNIZING THIS IS GOD. THIS IS
[1:45:00] RIGHT. THIS IS THE WORD. THIS IS WHAT
[1:45:02] MOSES TOLD US. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN
[1:45:04] waiting for.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; AND AS SHE POURED HER LIFE OUT ON HIS
[1:45:08] FEET AND WEPT AND DRIED HIM WITH HER
[1:45:10] HAIR, WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN SHE DRIES
[1:45:12] HIS FEET WITH HER HAIR? His feet were
[1:45:13] corrupt from the streets.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; It was dirt AND DUST IN HIS SANDALS AND
[1:45:18] MANURE FROM THE ANIMALS. IT WAS ALL THAT
[1:45:20] FILTH AND CORRUPTION ON HIS FEET. AND IF
[1:45:23] THOSE FEET WERE REJECTED FEET BECAUSE
[1:45:25] SIMON SHOULD HAVE WASHED HIS FEET WHEN
[1:45:26] HE WELCOMED IN HIS HOME. BUT THOSE DIRTY
[1:45:28] FEET WERE A SIGN OF THE REJECTED WORD.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; The living WORD OF GOD REJECTED IN THAT
[1:45:34] DAY. BUT THAT WOMAN, SHE COULDN'T STAND
[1:45:37] TO SEE THE WORD REJECTED. SHE WENT AND
[1:45:39] POURED HER SOUL OUT AT HIS FEET AND SHE
[1:45:41] TOOK THE REJECTION UPON HER HEAD.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; SHE TOOK THAT HAIR, AMEN, THAT BEAUTIFUL
[1:45:48] LONG HAIR. AND SHE BEGAN TO WIPE THE
[1:45:50] MUCK AND THE MUD WHERE THE TEARS MIXED
[1:45:52] WITH THE DIRT AND THE MANURE. AND SHE
[1:45:54] TOOK HIS REJECTION, HIS SHAME, AND SHE
[1:45:57] PUT IT WHERE IN HER GLORY. FOR A WOMAN'S
[1:46:00] LONG HAIR IS HER GLORY. SHE TOOK SHE
[1:46:02] GAVE HER GLORY TO HIM AND TOOK HIS
[1:46:04] REPROACH UPON HER.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees looked at the outside
[1:46:13] of her and said, "How can you let that
[1:46:16] woman touch you?" And Simon, who was
[1:46:19] judging her, realized he was condemned
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; because he didn't receive the word.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Still had his position in church, still
[1:46:28] had respect among his colleagues, still
[1:46:30] had his wealth. He was utterly rejected.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; He looked at the woman and he said to
[1:46:39] Simon, "Simon, I have somewhat to say
[1:46:41] against thee.
[1:46:46] When I came here, you gave me no kiss.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't anoint me. My feet you did
[1:46:53] not wash.
[1:46:55] But this woman has not ceased to wash my
[1:46:58] feet with her tears and anoint them and
[1:47:00] kiss me.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; So, and I say to her, her sins which are
[1:47:07] many
[1:47:08] are all forgiven.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; she didn't do good deeds.
[1:47:16] She didn't have good church attendance.
[1:47:19] She may not even been dressed right.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; But what was it? Something in her
[1:47:25] recognized this was God.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Simon couldn't recognize it. She could
[1:47:30] recognize it. Something in her could
[1:47:33] serve this God. Something in her would
[1:47:35] give her life to this word.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; But Simon wanted to keep his pride of
[1:47:40] life, his lust of the flesh, his love of
[1:47:43] the eye. It wasn't that Simon I don't
[1:47:45] think Simon didn't love God.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Simon may have loved God, but Simon
[1:47:50] loved Simon more than Simon loved God.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Simon couldn't give up his prestige
[1:47:55] anymore than the the the rest of the
[1:47:58] ruling party there in Israel could give
[1:47:59] up their position. Mhm.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Listen, when it came time to get rid of
[1:48:05] Jesus, they they they started saying,
[1:48:07] the chief priests gathered together and
[1:48:09] the high priest was there and they began
[1:48:10] to say, "Listen, he's he listen, if we
[1:48:13] let this GO ON, EVERYBODY'S FALLING
[1:48:15] AFTER HIM. We're going to have the
[1:48:16] Romans come down here and take our
[1:48:18] nation and take our position."
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; What were they looking at? Natural
[1:48:24] natural natural things.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; We can't HAVE THIS REVIVAL. WE CAN'T
[1:48:29] HAVE THIS WORD. WE CAN'T HAVE THIS TRUTH
[1:48:32] INTERRUPTING OUR position
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; in our NATION AND WE'RE HIGH PRIEST AND
[1:48:37] WE LISTEN WE'VE GOT A RIGHT TO RULE AND
[1:48:39] WE'VE GOT A GOOD THING GOING WITH the
[1:48:40] Romans. They leave us alone and we still
[1:48:42] have position. We still HAVE PRESTIGE.
[1:48:44] WE STILL CAN MAKE OUR MONEY. We can
[1:48:45] STILL BE HELD IN HONOR AMONGST THE
[1:48:47] PEOPLE. BUT IF THIS IF THIS KEEPS GOING
[1:48:49] AND IT BECOMES A CLAMOR, THE ROMANS ARE
[1:48:51] going to come in here AND TAKE THIS ALL
[1:48:53] AWAY.
[1:48:54] And then the high PRIEST ROSE UP
[1:48:56] CAIAPHAS AND HE SAYS, "SHALL ONE MAN IS
[1:48:58] IT EXPEDIENT THAT ONE MAN SHALL DIE FOR
[1:49:00] THE NATION?" AMEN. AND THE THE BIBLE
[1:49:03] SAYS HE PROPHESIED. HE SAID THAT BECAUSE
[1:49:06] HE WAS the high priest that year.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sir.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE GAVE A PROPHECY AND IT WAS A TRUE
[1:49:12] PROPHECY.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; AND IT CAME TO PASS.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MOVED HIM TO SAY IT? HE WAS
[1:49:19] TRYING TO KEEP HIS position
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; in his honor.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; He was a right office the wrong person.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; God anointed him to speak a prophecy,
[1:49:32] but he himself was wicked and corrupt.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And didn't love the word of God. Amen.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; When they delivered Jesus,
[1:49:45] listen, after he says a statement like
[1:49:47] that, you know what that becomes? That
[1:49:50] becomes a religious cloak
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; for having a man murdered, not according
[1:49:54] to the law,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; They were acting completely contrary to
[1:50:00] the law of Moses. And here they are
[1:50:02] trying to uphold the law.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; What was their justification? They found
[1:50:06] a religious reason to kill him.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; They had a fig leaf covering to cover
[1:50:11] their true intention of their wicked
[1:50:13] heart.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't just God who could see
[1:50:16] through it. This time when they brought
[1:50:18] him to Pilot, Pilate could see through
[1:50:19] it.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz it said Pilate tried to release him
[1:50:23] because Pilate realized that for envy,
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; the chief priest had delivered him.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; What is that? Lust of the flesh, lust of
[1:50:34] the eyes, pride of life.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Hid behind a religious cloak.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Friends, what is the greatest
[1:50:41] temptation?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Not going to a house of prostitution.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, for children of God who are
[1:50:47] trying to serve God.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Not going out and getting drunk tonight.
[1:50:51] Not going out
[1:50:53] finding a bunch of drugs. That's not the
[1:50:55] greatest temptation.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; The greatest temptation is to do
[1:50:59] something that looks good, but for the
[1:51:00] wrong reasons.
[1:51:02] that I get something out of and I look
[1:51:04] good and my pride and my prestige and my
[1:51:07] lust and I get to keep.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; And I'll find a religious reason
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; to cover my own worldliness.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; What's worldliness? Lust of the flesh,
[1:51:17] lust of the eyes, pride of life.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Not dressing skimpy.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; That's a result.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; It's worldliness.
[1:51:28] So what is that fig leaf religion trying
[1:51:31] to cover
[1:51:33] with religion? What's it that's the
[1:51:35] temptation
[1:51:37] or in sincerity with a sincere heart
[1:51:40] wanting to actually do something for God
[1:51:43] but not doing it according to the word.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation you and I
[1:51:49] are going to face.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; What's the solution to the temptation?
[1:51:53] Paul told us, "I die daily."
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I die to my wants. I die to my dreams. I
[1:52:01] die to my ambitions. I die to my pride.
[1:52:03] I die to all of that and surrender to
[1:52:05] his word.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; And secondly, I want to walk in a
[1:52:08] relationship with him to where he can
[1:52:11] correct me.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; To where he can come like he did to
[1:52:15] David and said, "David, you got the
[1:52:17] right idea in bringing the ark back. You
[1:52:19] got the right motive, but you're doing
[1:52:20] it wrong."
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:23] And David would say, "Oh, God."
[1:52:26] He doesn't go back to everybody and
[1:52:28] says, "You know, I think um uh I had
[1:52:31] another idea."
[1:52:34] Trying to keep his pride and trying to
[1:52:36] look good. No, I believe David went back
[1:52:38] and says, "Guys, I got it all wrong.
[1:52:40] This is where we failed.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; We didn't keep the word." Amen. We had
[1:52:44] the right desire. We had sincerity. We
[1:52:46] we wanted to worship God. We wanted his
[1:52:48] presence among us, but we we failed to
[1:52:50] KEEP THE WORD. OH, LET'S COME BACK to
[1:52:52] the word. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK TO the
[1:52:53] word, look at the revival. Look at the
[1:52:55] jubilee. Look at the dancing. Look at
[1:52:56] the singing. LOOK AT THE SHOUTING. AS
[1:52:58] THE ARK CAME, THE WORD CAME ON THE
[1:53:01] SHOULDERS OF THE LEVITES MARCHING BACK
[1:53:02] INTO JERUSALEM, BRINGING THE WORD AND
[1:53:04] THE PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THEIR
[1:53:06] MIDST. AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD
[1:53:08] UNTIL HIS WIFE CALLED HIM A FOOL.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; HE WAS SO EXCITED. WHAT WAS EXCITING,
[1:53:14] DAVID? DAVID WAS SO THRILLED. AMEN.
[1:53:17] BECAUSE GOD HAD CORRECTED HIM AND GOD
[1:53:19] HAD TOLD HIM WHAT YOU DESIRE IS RIGHT,
[1:53:21] BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND
[1:53:23] NOW DAVID KNEW THE RIGHT WAY. AND DAVID
[1:53:25] COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIS JOY BECAUSE
[1:53:27] IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. IT'S GOING
[1:53:29] TO WORK THIS TIME. THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:53:31] IS COMING BACK AMONG US BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:53:33] DOING IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; EVERY FEW STEPS, SLAY OXEN. EVERY FEW
[1:53:39] STEPS, SLAY, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
[1:53:40] REJOICING. REJOICING. REJOICING. BECAUSE
[1:53:43] THE word's coming back.
[1:53:47] UNTIL HE DANCED BEFORE THE LORD WITH ALL
[1:53:49] HIS MIGHT AND DISROED HIS OUTER GARMENTS
[1:53:51] TILL HIS WIFE BEGAN TO MOCK HIM, WHICH
[1:53:53] WAS SAUL'S DAUGHTER.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HER DAD DID, PRIDE.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And she said, "IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT,
[1:54:01] COME WATCH ME TOMORROW."
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; LIKE, THAT'S NOT PRIDE, FRIENDS. THAT'S
[1:54:06] NOT ARROGANCE. THAT'S A MAN WHO KNOWS
[1:54:08] THAT WORD IS GOING TO COME BACK BECAUSE
[1:54:10] GOD GAVE ME THE WORD AND THAT WORD CAN'T
[1:54:12] FAIL. AND I KNOW EXACTLY NOW HOW TO
[1:54:15] ACCOMPLISH WHAT'S IN MY HEART.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HOW TO WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW WHAT
[1:54:19] HE WANTS. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE ABEL
[1:54:21] WAITING TO WORSHIP GOD? AMEN. AT THE
[1:54:23] GATE OF OF EDEN, NOT KNOWING WHAT GOD
[1:54:25] WANTS AND HOW TO WORSHIP HIM AND HOW TO
[1:54:26] PLEASE HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS JOY WHEN
[1:54:29] HE GOT THE REVELATION, GOD WANTS BLOOD.
[1:54:32] ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT DAWNED ON HIM. WHAT
[1:54:34] DID HE DO WHEN MY PARENTS FELL? WHAT WAS
[1:54:36] GOING ON THERE? WHY AM I IN THIS
[1:54:37] CONDITION? WHY ARE WE OUTSIDE OF THE
[1:54:39] GARDEN? ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE REALIZED HE
[1:54:41] WANTS BLOOD. COULD YOU IMAGINE HIS
[1:54:44] REJOICING AS HE WENT SKIPPING AND
[1:54:46] JUMPING AND RUNNING TO GO FIND A LAMB
[1:54:48] BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT WILL WORK. I
[1:54:50] KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS. I KNOW HOW TO
[1:54:52] PLEASE THE LORD. IT WILL WORK
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE it's according to the word.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO SAVE PEOPLE. WE TRY TO DO
[1:55:00] GREAT WORKS FOR GOD. WE TRY CAMPAIGNS.
[1:55:02] WE TRY ALL OF THIS AND IT WON'T WORK IF
[1:55:04] IT'S NOT DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; The word IS THE WAY. IT'S BEEN THE WAY
[1:55:09] FROM THE BEGINNING. WE'VE GOT TO COME
[1:55:11] BACK TO THE WORD AND PRAISE GOD, GOD HAS
[1:55:14] SENT BACK HIS WORD IN THIS DAY BY A
[1:55:17] VINDICATED PROPHET TO BRING US THE FULL
[1:55:19] TEACHING OF THE FATHERS OF FAITH.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; So that WE KNOW [screaming] IT WILL
[1:55:24] WORK.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; How do you know it's working?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Prophet God says that's the only way you
[1:55:30] know you can overcome
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; is by the word.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; So if we have the word, we know we'll
[1:55:35] overcome.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He also said, "This is the only way
[1:55:39] you'll know you are overcoming."
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Let's think about that statement for a
[1:55:45] minute.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; This is the only way you'll know you're
[1:55:48] overcoming.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; I thought I would know I was overcoming
[1:55:52] when everything was working out right.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That would be the obvious answer, but
[1:55:57] that's not what the prophet said.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; The only way you'll know you're
[1:56:02] overcoming
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; is by the word.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:06] So that means when I'm following the
[1:56:08] word and it doesn't look like I'm
[1:56:10] overcoming, I know I'm overcoming.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; When I'm following the word and
[1:56:15] everything's going wrong,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; contrary to my idea, opposite of what I
[1:56:20] was hoping would happen,
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; the only way I can know I'M OVERCOMING
[1:56:25] IS NOT BECAUSE I'M MAKING PROGRESS.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; The only way I KNOW I'M OVERCOMING IS
[1:56:29] I'M STAYING WITH THE WORD. AND THE WORD
[1:56:31] CAN'T FAIL. AND IF I STAY WITH THE WORD,
[1:56:33] I'M OVERCOMING BECAUSE THE WORD IS
[1:56:35] ETERNAL AND WILL NEVER FADE AWAY.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; I DON'T LOOK FOR RESULTS. I LOOK FOR THE
[1:56:42] WORD.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, [screaming] PHARISEES HAD
[1:56:44] RESULTS. THEY WERE PROILITIZING ALL OVER
[1:56:46] THE WORLD.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JUDAS HAD RESULTS. HE WAS
[1:56:50] CASTING OUT DEVILS AND HEALING THE SICK.
[1:56:52] I'M NOT LOOKING FOR RESULTS. I'M LOOKING
[1:56:53] AT THE WORD AND I'M TRYING TO STAY RIGHT
[1:56:55] WITH THE WORD BECAUSE IF I STAY WITH THE
[1:56:57] WORD, I can't fail.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz his word can't fail.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; That's true. And I know I'm overcoming
[1:57:02] when I face opposition, when everything
[1:57:04] goes haywire, WHEN IT GOES OPPOSITE to
[1:57:06] what I think is right. If I stay with
[1:57:08] the word, I know that I'm overcoming.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; But you BE LIKE, "BROTHER CHAD, YOU'RE
[1:57:13] YOU'RE MILES AWAY FROM YOUR OBJECTIVE,
[1:57:15] BUT I'M OVERCOMING."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't LOOK LIKE IT TO ME. IT
[1:57:18] DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME EITHER. BUT
[1:57:19] I'M NOT LOOKING AT RESULTS, AND I'M NOT
[1:57:21] LOOKING AT CONDITIONS. I'M LOOKING AT
[1:57:24] THE WORD.
[1:57:28] We overcome by the word.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with this scripture.
[1:57:37] Didn't get to finish, but maybe we will
[1:57:38] on Wednesday. 1 Peter 1:24.
[1:57:42] For all flesh is as grass.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; And all the glory of man is as the
[1:57:46] flower of grass.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; The grass witherth, and the flower
[1:57:50] thereof fallth away, but the word of the
[1:57:52] Lord endureth forever.
[1:57:54] And this is the word which by the gospel
[1:57:56] is preached unto you.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; What can I rest my salvation on? The
[1:58:01] word.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; What if I don't feel saved? It doesn't
[1:58:04] matter how I feel. I'm taking the word.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; What if I DON'T FEEL LIKE an overcomer?
[1:58:08] I'm taking the word. What if I DON'T
[1:58:10] FEEL LIKE I'M HEALED? I'M LOOKING AT THE
[1:58:12] PROMISE. I'M STANDING ON THE WORD. I'M
[1:58:13] OVERCOMING BY THE WORD, NOT MY FEELINGS,
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; not by WHAT I SEE. GOD LOVES TO PROVE
[1:58:19] HIS CHILDREN. HE'LL LET EVERYTHING GO
[1:58:21] RIGHT.
[1:58:23] because it's the wrong direction.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; HE'LL LET EVERYTHING GO PERFECT TO SEE
[1:58:30] if you'll leave the word
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; and go after what looks perfect or stay
[1:58:34] with the word even though that looks
[1:58:35] perfect.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; He'll put them to sleep.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He'll give you abashai to tell you he'll
[1:58:41] do it for you.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; It all work out perfect,
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; but it's not the word.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:51] So he can test you with everything being
[1:58:53] perfect, but not the word.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Then he can make everything go wrong,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; completely wrong, and look horrible
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and be painful. But it's the word
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; to see if you'll take the word.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; And God will test his children with
[1:59:10] both.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; He tested David. He tested Job with
[1:59:14] opposite tests.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:18] And he will, we can expect him to test
[1:59:20] us with both. [snorts]
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; I said that was the last thing, but
[1:59:26] maybe I was a little wrong.
[1:59:30] Brother Bam said, "We find now this evil
[1:59:32] age is to prove to Satan she is not like
[1:59:36] Eve,
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; that she is not that type of woman.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; And she will be tried by his word." And
[1:59:42] the bride as Adam's bride was tried by
[1:59:44] the word. And Adam's bride believed
[1:59:46] every bit of the word, all but confused
[1:59:47] on one promise that he's the same
[1:59:49] yesterday, today, and forever today.
[1:59:51] See, but failed on one promise under the
[1:59:53] temptation of the enemy face to face.
[1:59:55] And now the people that's called for his
[1:59:56] name, of course, is his bride. And she
[1:59:59] is to come in contact again by the same
[2:00:01] thing. Not by just denominational truth
[2:00:03] or something, but every word.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Eve had one commandment to keep, and she
[2:00:09] fell away from it by reasoning, by lust
[2:00:12] of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of
[2:00:13] life. Amen. Now, the fullness of the
[2:00:15] word has been restored to us. And how
[2:00:17] are WE GOING TO OVERCOME? Because the
[2:00:19] spirit of God is here to make sure.
[2:00:22] AMEN. BY HIS POWER, NOT BY MIGHT. AMEN.
[2:00:24] NOT BY STRENGTH, NOT BY MIGHT, BY POWER,
[2:00:27] BUT BY MY SPIRIT, sayeth the Lord. And
[2:00:29] the fullness of the word HAS BROUGHT THE
[2:00:31] FULLNESS OF HIS SPIRIT TO EMPOWER A
[2:00:33] BRIDE TO STAY WITH THE WORD.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; IF YOU STAY WITH THE WORD, THE WORD
[2:00:40] WON'T FAIL. The word is eternal. It will
[2:00:42] come to pass.
[2:00:43] If you leave the word, YOU WILL FAIL.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; SO, HOW do we overcome in this Satan's
[2:00:49] Eden, IN THE DARKEST HOUR IN LEODYSIA
[2:00:51] WHERE CHRIST IS ON THE OUTSIDE KNOCKING
[2:00:53] THE TR? HOW DO WE OVERCOME IN THAT? WE
[2:00:56] OVERCOME BY STAYING with the word that's
[2:00:58] been delivered to us.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Just stay with it. Just obey it. Just
[2:01:03] get under it. JUST PUT IT ON. JUST DON'T
[2:01:05] REASON IT. DON'T THINK about it. Just
[2:01:07] obey the word of God.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand together.
[2:01:12] Amen. Musicians, if you'll please come
[2:01:14] forward. I just want to encourage you
[2:01:16] friends. If you find in you, Amen.
[2:01:19] something, if I've triggered something
[2:01:21] in your thought while preaching, if God
[2:01:23] has come and brought a conviction in
[2:01:25] you, you find there's a little bit of
[2:01:26] lust for something and I'm making a
[2:01:28] religious cloak. There's a little bit of
[2:01:30] pride and I'm hiding behind a religious
[2:01:32] cloak. I PRAY THAT GOD will pierce
[2:01:35] through your fig leaves right now
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; and pierce through mine and yours and
[2:01:39] all of our re religious rhetoric and get
[2:01:42] DOWN TO OUR HEART AND SHOW US WHERE WE
[2:01:44] ARE SO WE CAN BE LIKE DAVID AND SAY,
[2:01:46] "GOD, it's me you were preaching to
[2:01:48] today. It's me. I've had TOO MUCH PRIDE.
[2:01:51] I'VE WANTED THIS JOB. I WANTED THIS
[2:01:53] POSITION. I WANTED THIS AND I was
[2:01:55] manipulating and moving and willing to
[2:01:57] COMPROMISE ON YOUR WORD TO HAVE WHAT I
[2:01:59] WANTED. BUT NOT ANYMORE. FROM this day
[2:02:01] forward, I'm going to take the word
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; and surrender myself. I encourage you as
[2:02:06] we bow our heads. Amen. Lift your hands
[2:02:08] to God and say, "God, it's me. I'm the
[2:02:11] one. I have sinned. I have missed the
[2:02:14] mark. BUT GOD, WOULD YOU COME AND
[2:02:16] EMPOWER ME BY your spirit to stay with
[2:02:18] this word?"
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Let's just lift OUR VOICES TO GOD. DON'T
[2:02:21] LET ME be the only one praying, friends.
[2:02:23] You pray, too. Amen. Oh, GOD IN HEAVEN,
[2:02:26] WE LIFT our hands to you, Lord. And we
[2:02:28] ask, God, that you would forgive us,
[2:02:30] God. We've been tempted AND WE'VE BEEN
[2:02:31] TRIED. WE FIND THE LUST OF THE FLESH,
[2:02:34] THE PRIDE OF LIFE. I MEAN, THE THE THE
[2:02:36] THE PRIDE OF LIFE AND the lust OF THE
[2:02:38] EYES. GOD, IT'S ALL AROUND US. AND THIS
[2:02:40] OLD NATURE IS TRYING TO DRAG US THE
[2:02:42] WRONG WAY. BUT OH GOD, YOU HAVE GIVEN US
[2:02:44] ANOTHER DOSE OF YOUR word this morning.
[2:02:46] YOU HAVE OPENED OUR EYES TO THE TACTICS
[2:02:48] OF THE ENEMY, TRYING TO DECEIVE US INTO
[2:02:51] SOMETHING LIKE HE DID THE FIRST WOMAN.
[2:02:53] BUT OH GOD, THIS CHURCH ISN'T GOING TO
[2:02:55] BE DECEIVED BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT YOUR
[2:02:56] WORD IN FULL LIGHT. YOU'VE BROUGHT IT TO
[2:02:59] DISPEL ALL THE LIES OF THE ENEMY. AND
[2:03:01] GOD, WE RECEIVE IT NOW IN Jesus Christ's
[2:03:04] name. God, let your power come and fill
[2:03:06] us. LET YOUR WORD COME TO MANIFESTATION
[2:03:08] IN OUR LIVES. MAY WE BECOME THE VERY
[2:03:10] VESSELS THAT make this word live.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; May we PUT THE WORD ON. MAY IT BE OUR
[2:03:15] GARMENT, OUR CLOTHING. MAY WE BE DRESSED
[2:03:17] IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. LORD, BY YOUR
[2:03:19] GRACE YOU'VE GIVEN US IN THIS HOUR. YOU
[2:03:21] HAVE GIVEN US WAS YOUR WORD NOT TO
[2:03:23] MANIPULATE, NOT TO PLAY WITH, NOT TO
[2:03:25] IGNORE, BUT YOU'VE GIVEN US YOUR WORD TO
[2:03:27] GET BEHIND. IT'S OUR SECURITY, OUR
[2:03:30] SAFETY. IT'S OUR GUARANTEE.
[2:03:33] And God, may we TAKE IT AS A GUARANTEE,
[2:03:36] a promise, A PROMISE OF RESULTS, A
[2:03:39] PROMISE of overcoming.
[2:03:41] Wean us away from senses AND BRING US
[2:03:44] BACK TO PURE FAITH in your word.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; GIVE US WHAT THAT WOMAN AT THE WELL HAD.
[2:03:48] FORGIVE US WHAT THE WOMAN WHO WASHED HER
[2:03:49] FEET HAD. SOMETHING INSIDE OF US THAT
[2:03:52] COULD RECOGNIZE the word and surrender
[2:03:53] completely to it. God, forgive us for
[2:03:57] our failures. Forgive us for doing
[2:03:59] wrong. God, help us to withstand this
[2:04:02] temptation in the end time. For God, you
[2:04:04] have given us everything we need. For
[2:04:06] you have given us the fullness of your
[2:04:09] word.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; May we take it may we take it above our
[2:04:13] reasoning. May we take it above our
[2:04:16] desires, our personal fleshly desires.
[2:04:19] [music] May we take it above our pride.
[2:04:22] May we make that word our king, our
[2:04:25] Lord, our headship, our savior, our
[2:04:28] lover, our bridegroom, our husband. It's
[2:04:31] you, Lord Jesus. You've come to us in
[2:04:33] the fullness of your word to unite with
[2:04:36] us to be our headship so you might guide
[2:04:39] us through this final stage of the
[2:04:40] journey. For you've washed us with the
[2:04:43] water of your word, so you could present
[2:04:45] to yourself a bride having no spot or
[2:04:48] wrinkle or blemish or any such thing.
[2:04:51] Let the word do the work in us, Lord.
[2:04:53] Let the word discern our hearts, Lord.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And when we come up in the balance and
[2:04:58] found lacking, Lord, may we just repent,
[2:05:00] Lord, and move back to your word, for
[2:05:03] that's where you want us to be. We love
[2:05:05] you. We ask your blessings over all that
[2:05:08] was said, over your children who have
[2:05:10] repentant hearts now. God, if there's
[2:05:12] anybody who hasn't experienced this
[2:05:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[2:05:16] quickening power to quicken them to
[2:05:18] life, that they have your power working
[2:05:21] on the inside to break them free from
[2:05:23] the lust that have bound them. I pray
[2:05:26] God that you would quicken them now.
[2:05:27] That that that Lord that they would
[2:05:29] reach out to you and they would open
[2:05:30] their heart and receive you, Lord. That
[2:05:33] you would fill them with your spirit.
[2:05:35] that you would transform them, that they
[2:05:36] would come forth as new creatures in
[2:05:38] Christ Jesus. God, for we know we have
[2:05:41] to be born again, God, our first birth
[2:05:44] is wrong. We must have another birth, a
[2:05:46] spiritual birth. And God, may you, may
[2:05:49] you grant it, Lord, according to the
[2:05:50] promise in your word, as we reach out to
[2:05:53] you. Fill us all fresh again with your
[2:05:56] spirit, with the power to overcome, to
[2:05:58] stay with the word, to surrender to it
[2:06:00] more and more. We love you, God. We ask
[2:06:03] for your blessings over all these things
[2:06:05] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless you all. Riley, my
[2:06:14] hope is built on nothing [singing]
