TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there is a vision given to us that you are part of that preview of that spotless lam's wife and i believe there is also a price that you need to pay it doesn't come cheap the the first coming of pr of christ didn't come cheap there was a price that had to be paid and that was the price of of of the life of the innocent lamb of god that had to be paid whatever god does it's not cheap god is not cheap because he is rich he's rich in in everything in the resources in everything so that's why when he came there wasn't a cheap visit amen he came down and it was expensive he had to pay the price that's why the second coming is is no different there is a prize that we need to pay as joseph did for the dream of the word the word was shown to him showed him his position and then he had to go through different things in life that brought him straight to the palace amen to his position praise the lord so people get offended brothers of joseph they got offended they didn't get offended by the word you know they all believed the word they believed abraham they believed isaac they believed jacob they believed all of these things so they believed the logos but when the logos started to pull pour itself out into an a vessel that's where the problem arose so it's not the logos that gets people offended is the keynotes it's the pouring out of god emptying of god into human flesh that's where the problem arises and and we can see that that when the word comes in flesh that's where problems start when the word was with god there was no problem when when uh you know god was in the beginning with his own thoughts that was not a problem the problem was when he started to come in flesh amen when he started to manifest himself when the word came into fruition that was the problem
