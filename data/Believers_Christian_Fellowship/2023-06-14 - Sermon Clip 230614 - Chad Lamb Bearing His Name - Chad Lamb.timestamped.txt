[0:00] Jesus looks at Peter and says Peter
[0:03] Satan has desired to Sifty like wheat
[0:06] he didn't say I prayed through the
[0:07] father so that you can bypass that trial
[0:09] no Peter needed to be sifted like wheat
[0:12] because Peter had way too much
[0:13] self-confidence
[0:14] way too much pride he was way too
[0:16] arrogant and he felt like he could do
[0:18] something
[0:19] and he displayed how self-confident he
[0:21] was when he drew his sword and tried to
[0:22] kill the servant of the high priest he
[0:24] was showing how proud and arrogant and
[0:26] how self-sufficient that he was amen and
[0:28] Jesus didn't say Satan has desired
[0:30] that's asking permission Satan has
[0:32] desire to Sifty like we he didn't tell
[0:34] him no he said go ahead but I've prayed
[0:36] for you that your faith failed not
[0:41] Peter needed to be sifted he needed to
[0:44] be humbled he needed to run out and weep
[0:46] on his face and cry and repent
[0:53] what do we need we need the same thing
[0:56] we need to be knocked off of our high
[0:58] horse like Paul was knocked off of his
[1:00] high horse
[1:01] we need to be smoked we need to be
[1:03] afflicted why because there's too much
[1:06] pride in the human race there's too much
[1:08] self-sufficiency too much arrogancy amen
[1:11] every time we start feeling like we got
[1:12] our act together we can figure this out
[1:14] we know what to do God will stick his
[1:16] foot out and trip you so you fall and
[1:18] bust your nose come up with a bloody
[1:20] nose and you realize I can't even walk
[1:22] unless he leads you
[1:25] and that busted nose is the best thing
[1:27] that ever happened to you or I
[1:31] oh my goodness this is hard this is real
[1:33] ain't
[1:35] Mr real people in a real world and it's
[1:37] really going to overcome by the grace of
[1:40] God by predestination not by human
[1:42] effort not by human willpower not by our
[1:45] brains and our will and all I I am so
[1:48] tired of an arrogant attitude in me
[1:51] I'm so tired of fighting with pride all
[1:54] the time I'm so sick of it amen I say
[1:57] God help me help me Lord to stay humble
[2:00] to stay nothing so that you can be
[2:02] something
[2:08] Peter goes from I'll never forsake you
[2:10] oh men oh men leave you alone I mean
[2:13] what's he saying is he showing his love
[2:15] for God no he's showing his arrogance he
[2:17] his pride in himself
[2:20] it looked religious it looked like love
[2:22] it was self-love on display
[2:29] to finally God has a broken man
[2:33] that will humble himself and that it
[2:36] will repent
[2:37] before Gone
[2:39] when he has a repentant broken man then
[2:42] he can fill that man with the Holy Ghost
[2:43] and he can take him out to the gate
[2:45] called beautiful and he can speak in the
[2:47] name of Jesus Christ and that man can go
[2:49] leaping and running and and then all can
[2:51] gather around and they begin they begin
[2:53] to praise uh they can begin to praise
[2:55] Peter and Peter will say why look you
[2:57] upon us as though we in our strength
[2:59] have healed this man we haven't done
[3:01] anything but in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:03] who you crucified this man as him it's
[3:05] not us it's Christ
[3:07] oh what did Peter need Peter needed to
[3:10] be sifted like wheat Peter needed to
[3:12] fall Peter needed to repent
[3:16] what do we need we need everything God
[3:19] has ordained for us
[3:21] so that we can come to perfection
