anyway uh just me being up here as a testimony about a year ago in April I uh clipped my index finger with a power saw and it cut the nerve and then to my index finger I could turn the prayer request in for that and uh so it healed up pretty quickly and I was able to return to normal use and I could do anything with it that I wanted to except play the guitar because putting pressure on a specific point like a guitar string was just undoable I picked up the guitar a couple times for the past year and uh still I was just just wasn't possible I just kind of waited on at the heel and just left it in prayer and it never did get to feel any better so about a week ago I thought well I'm going to figure out how to play this guitar with just three fingers and so I worked on it I re-tuned the guitar to different tunings and tried different chords and uh well the finger index finger just would not work so I was going to find a way to do it and I was going to sing a special with just three fingers and then Wednesday brother Noel Johnson was talking about a man he prayed for that had a crushed hand and I think no feeling in that finger when he said that my index finger started tingling I thought well my faith is not brother Noel or or in my prayers even you know I'd I'd given up Miss Lord if you want me to be able to use that finger then you're very capable and if not then we'll find another way to to get around and praise you anyway and so uh I went I don't know if I tried to play it after Wednesday but I think it was Friday I picked up the guitar and that index finger worked and I may have a dead string or two but it's still trying to learn its way around the guitar my fingers are still tender haven't played the guitar for I'm making excuses I never was any good when I could could so this is a testimony today to even stand here and be able to play the guitar and I just placed my life in God's hands uh he knows what's best and he knows what we need so we just rest in him so we'll try to play this in the key of G Steve it is your responsibility to cover all the dead strings there are walls made by man built by frail and human hands that an enemy can scale and get to you [Music] but there is one for which I long it makes all the other strong it's a wall of prayer surrounding me [Music] sometimes the wall of Grace sometimes a wall of Faith other times it's sweet mercies that I need but the one for which I long it makes all the other strong I need a wall of prayer surrounding me there are walls made by man built by frail and human hands that an enemy can scale and get to you but there is one protecting me from my greatest enemy it's a wall that Satan can't break through sometimes a wall of Grace sometimes a wall of Faith other times it's sweet mercies that I need but the one for which I long it makes all the other strong I need a wall of prayer surrounding me oh my brother when I'm weak would you stand instead for me and pray your Fortress around me strong that can't be moved and I promise you today when I bow my knees to pray I'll do my best to a wall a prayer for you sometimes a wall of Grace [Music] sometimes a wall of Faith other times it's sweet mercies that I need but the one for which I long it makes all the other strong I need a wall of prayer surrounding me sweeter of prayer Sweet Hour of Prayer hear that calls me from a world of care but the one for which I long it makes all the other strong I need a wall of prayer surrounding me I need a wall of prayer surrounding me amen I believe we can all say that this morning I need a wall of prayer surrounding me amen just singing that I let's sing that number 403 key of C when we all get to heaven amen is brother Chad prepares to come this morning maybe we could all just stand I just want to sing this a little different I was looking at this song this morning it says when we all get to heaven and that's so far away but let's sing that song this morning when we all get to Heavenly places because that's where we're promised to stand today Amen to bring it present tense amen when we all get to Heavenly places oh what a day I've rejoicing this will be all [Music] Sing and Shout the victory [Music] of the wondrous of all Jesus sing his mercy and his grace and he's prepared for us a place and when we [Music] kneel says oh what I did I rejoicing that oh see Jose Beyond your CG seems we will sing and shout victory Victory trusting serving every day oh but one glimpse of him in glory with the toil of Life [Music] rejoicing that will be oh and we all we'll sing and shout Victor sing that for us what a day victory amen are you glad you don't have to wait to go to Heavenly places amen but we've been caught up by the grace of God Amen let's bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you God for the joy that is in our hearts for the great grace that you've given to us Lord and we're so thankful that we can come together like this and sing your praises and rejoice in your goodness hear the testimonies Lord of your faithfulness to your word the promise you've kept Lord for our brother Ron oh what a tremendous testimony how thankful we are Lord that you continue to work and you continue to fulfill your word and you're still faithful to everything you've promised to do we're so grateful Lord God now as we look into your word we pray God that you would help us surrender our own thinking surrender ourselves Lord and allow you to come teach us your ways may you show us the path that you want us to walk and give us the faith to walk therein we love you Lord we ask that you would take preeminence among us as you come yourself and break the bread of life and feed us your waiting sheep Norm we love you and we thank you God ask your blessings over all we say and do in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you on while we're standing let's turn to the book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter 30. I just want to welcome all of our visitors I see that sister Naomi Lau has some family here and God bless you it's good to have you here and Rebecca hunting's God bless you it's good to see you pop in again so it's good to see some familiar faces any other visitors we have God bless you you're welcome I also want to um say happy Fourth of July amen so hopefully you get some time off work and some time with family and get to enjoy that this coming week amen I always appreciate a little more time with family and friends it's always good amen before we read I also want to say I appreciate the song specials that was a real blessing and the testimony brother Ron I appreciate you sharing that with us that was tremendous God keeps his word amen and he doesn't always do it the way we expect but he always does it amen and he has the privilege to do it in unexpected ways but it doesn't matter amen he still fulfills his word praise God man let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 19. for one scripture and then we'll allow you to be seated Deuteronomy 30 verse 19. I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days and thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give them may God bless you as you seated may the Lord bless us as we look into his word I also want to remind you that today is first Sunday of the month so we'll have our communion and feet Washing Service again this afternoon so we'll announce that again at the end of service amen we see here that Moses is laying out the lawn and he's setting before them he goes I'm setting before you life and death I'm setting before you uh two choices you can make amen and it's amazing that Moses says choose life amen choose life so that you can have these benefits choose life so you can remain in the land choose life so that you can love the Lord choose life amen but but it's it's always interesting to me how all through the Bible that God has never taken away this law of free moral agency and give the people an opportunity to choose amen and there's a whole if you read through the Bible there's a whole uh theme constantly running through the word of cause and effect choice and result amen decisions and the effects of those decisions amen and we can never get away from that in our own life we never get away from the scripture in anywhere amen because it's a principle that God laid out and through that principle he teaches us so many things so this morning I just want to take for a subject just the title decisions just decisions brother bear says in Satan's Eden he says Satan has succeeded in perverting and taking over this world and making it his kingdom that man was put on by free moral agency to choose for themselves what kind of Life they desired and that shows what's in your heart see you know what your actions speaks so loud it drowns your voice I love I love these to me I love these simple principles that are absolutely profound because you we've been put on free moral agency he says to choose for themselves what kind of Life they desire amen and the kind of choice we make brings results it has an effect so what we decide as an effect and so if I could say it this way amen our actions are a reflection of our decisions amen our decisions produce actions because once you decide something you must act upon the decision when I decide to do something then then after I make the decisions and my actions will follow my decision amen and so many times we we tried to we I guess for Me Maybe for me I I getting stuck in this sequence of indecision sometimes where I don't want to make a decision I don't know what decision to make and sometimes it's good to pause and not make a a rush decision sometimes you is I've seen people make snap decisions and regret those but I've also been in the place myself where I delay decision making and I kicked the can down the road and I'm hoping that all the actions take care of themselves and everything works out right so that I don't have to make a decision and that rarely works out amen every once in a while you see God come on the scene and all of a sudden give you a piece and now you know what to make and you make the decision and you move on but but sometimes I'm just trying to get it to work out without me having to make a decision because I'm uncertain of the decision or or I don't want to deal with the consequences of making the decision because decision brings action decision brings results as soon as I make a decision I'll act upon the decision I made and so I delay and I delay and I delay and I delay amen and for me many times that kicking the can down the road never works because all I do is make the situation more complicated and more people around me get frustrated and everybody's looking at me why won't you design amen until finally I get back into a corner and I make a decision and as soon as I make a decision action begins to follow and we find that God does that to us he puts us in a place where we have to make a decision because actions follow decisions amen but decisions are risky they're risky amen but we're never going to escape it in this lifetime because those decisions we make shows what's in our hearts in the brother realm says your actions as soon as he says that he says your actions speaks so loud it draws your voice so actions follow decisions and declare what's in your heart amen and the message testimony on the sea the prophet of God says so he didn't pay any attention his little face read but he was determined to see Jesus he's speaking of Zacchaeus Zacchaeus the tax collector the businessman who wants to see Jesus passing by says you see he wanted to get a look at him he didn't believe he was a prophet and if he wasn't a prophet he was going right down there and really tell him about it that's all going and saying well you're an imposter you ought to be in the city so he gets him on top of the garbage can and shinny's up the tree Amen brother says oh you don't use the word shinny do you he said that's Southern that means climb up the tree you know get your knees a hold of it well he called it shinny down here up the tree got up the tree and he got up there and he found where two limbs hit like this and he sat down right on both of them he says there that's where we all come where two ways meet yours and gods that's where you make your decision he said that's where Zacchaeus Was Zacchaeus was sitting on where two limbs go in two different directions and he was sitting right in the crook of that amen where where two ways meet amen your way in God's way and that's this place you have to make your decision amen he says it again in this message he said he raised up his leaf and he looked down said what's what's them oh that's supposed to be his disciples Rebecca told me about uh I'll wait just a minute then after a while he raised up the leaf again said now let's see if I'm covered up good and I'm sitting on two limbs that's where two ways meet and that's where a lot of people sit where yours in God's ways meet that's right got to make a decision from right there so many times when we're forced into a decision we have to make a decision amen it's a transition time and so many times amen we get in transition and I've said many times transitions are very tricky places because you're going to make a decision and that decision is going to determine how life is going to go amen and and and their their these transitions where you have to make a decision about work decisions about school a decision about who you'll marry decisions about what church you attend decisions about what you're going to do in certain situations these decisions carry with it great consequences because action will begin to follow decisions we get to a place of decision and now we have to determine what is God's way and what is my way amen and we and we we're given the privilege to choose we can choose brother bam said there's an unwritten law amongst us of choosing amen you can choose if whether you want an education or not what kind of job you want to work or or you can I mean you can choose to to to buy and to sell and to move and to do all these things God has given us the privilege to choose amen and God doesn't micromanage our choices because they have a cause and effect in our life that brings good results amen and brings education brings a teaching instruction in our lives where God has allowed us to make wrong decisions sometimes I wish God would micromanage my decisions and I wish that I would get a letter in the mail and that letter would say on this date do this and on that date do that God knows with all my heart that's what I want to do amen I want the letter amen but but then all of a sudden we take away the whole lesson that comes from having to wrestle it out make choices we have to weigh our own motives and objectives our own goals and Desires in life and we have to weigh them all against the word of God and then wait for the spirit of God to give us an unction and then move amen there's so much that we learn through decisions that God is not going to micromanage our decisions but he is going to allow us to to sweat it out to go through the process and sometimes make the wrong choice amen so that that we can come back around amen having gained some knowledge some understanding some character some perspective of ourselves I don't know about you but I've made some wrong choices and those wrong choices taught me a lot about me and I say what what was motivating me to make that choice and I can tell what was motivating me is whatever the situation was and I had to make a choice amen self got mixed in somewhere either self-preservation or self-promotion or our self-love or or whatever some some way self-mixed in amen and deluded my choice and I made a choice for self [Music] and those are the choices I'm most greatly regret because living for others is looking heaven in the face surrendering our life to Christ is the way to move forward amen but and so many times it you get into this situations it's hard to sort those things out and sometimes you don't really understand where your heart is until after you make the choice and and the sequence of events unfold and after they unfolded you come down the road a little bit you can look back and say I was wrong and then we can go and and when we go to those places then it could lock us up and we can get discouraged and never make another choice and I'm not doing that again or we can just take the lesson that God intended for us to get and say oh God help me never to take self again now me never when I get on the limb of two ways help me never go to the way of self help me go your way amen there's a story let's let's turn to Second Kings and just look at something for a minute I just want to look at several things in the Bible this morning and all of this is very very familiar to us but it's so it's so part of our life that we don't want to miss the instruction Kings seven and three Second Kings seven chapter seven and verse 3. said and there were four leprous men at the entering into the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die these these individuals were backed into a corner there was a severe famine in the land the syrians had cut off all the supplies amen they were starving out the city the lepers were sitting outside the city they said why sit we here till we die if we go in we die we stay here we die amen we go to the syrians we might die so let's take the might die option amen at least there's a chance it might only be five percent chance but let's take the five percent chance and we realize they got into a straight they got into a situation that they didn't want to be in nobody else wanted to be in but it was forcing them to make a move it was forcing them to make a decision and that decision actually produced life not just life and salvation for them but life and salvation for the entire city amen and God puts us in hard places sometimes but don't be afraid of the hard places amen because sometimes we come to Junctions and Crossroads and we get to where we can no longer delay we sat long enough if we sit any longer we die amen we die sometimes we get to the place if I sit any longer I'll die spiritually I've got to move if I sit here any longer amen my family will die if I sit in there any longer I will emotionally die if I sit here any longer I've got to make a move and I don't know which move to make amen but I've got to get moving amen and when you get moving then God begins to work out circumstances but when we sit we just sit and we sit and we sit until God puts us into a place where we've got to move amen they had when they moved out they had no guarantee this is another principle with God Amen so many times when we when we make a decision we don't know what the results are going to be for sure and I say that's most of the time we think that this is the right decision and we think for these reasons and and I believe I feel impressed of the Lord I've been in prayer about it it's according to the word I got all of these things but I just don't know and and sometimes I wish that I knew like I wish I knew if I did this if I said yes to this that it would work out because it's got potential not to work out amen I tell you these are all the things that keep me in indecision amen because I I I say God I've prayed this way before God you speak to people you showed dreams you can show me exactly what to do is that the truth he can show me but sometimes in showing me exactly what to do he defeats his own purpose and allowing me to have to make the decision and operate by free moral agency so I've been in the place praying and waiting and praying and crying and saying God you speak to other people I hear other people give testimony God come down and spoke to me show me the dream and I knew exactly what to do and it worked out perfect um sometimes in the testimony somebody gives they're just clipping the high parts they're not telling you they made the decision and it looked like it went wrong and then it finally worked out right and everything in the end worked out perfect because that's usually the way it goes usually you make this and say God you showed me this you spoke to my heart I believe it was you but everything's going backwards I made this choice and I thought we'd move on and we went back and it got worse and things didn't get better immediately got worse and then they got worse and then they got worse but then in the end it all worked out perfect some miraculous way so when we tell the testimony we say oh God spoke to my heart and he dropped it in here he said this and it worked out perfect let's be nice to each other and tell all the story amen Let's help one another and tell all the details the agony the prayers the self-doubt the questions amen praise God brother Ron could have given his testimony today in such a way that he would have been the spiritual superhero and we would all have been zeros but he told it real he believed he trusted God he committed to the Lord he didn't he didn't have hopes that in that service it was going to fix it they didn't he didn't know amen but God was faithful to his word anyways amen that's a wonderful testimony praise God a certain reality to life there's a certain a certain order to life that God set up and allowed amen and if we don't pay attention to that we don't honor it we're always looking for something else to work out amen and not working in the program God put us in so God put us in the program uh uh I I hope that I can say this to make sense amen I want to say it in a way that you understand what I'm saying but I don't want to I don't want to take away amen from the supernatural things of God God interjects himself in our life supernaturally over and over and over again to steer us to correct us to help us to rescue us but every day the sun still comes up and every day the sun still sets and every day you've got to eat food and every day you earn your bread by the sweat of your brow like the principles that are established that we've been placed into this Earth that we must operate by they're not going away that's the daily life and we understand the whole law of reaping and sowing God is not changing the whole law of reaping and sowing we are sowing and reaping you sow a seed to reap a harvest if you want to have food in the winter you must plant in the spring you must be diligent through the summer you must Gather in the Harvest God's not taking that away even though God can provide supernaturally is that right so when the children of Israel work out in the wilderness and they didn't have time to plant they did not have time to sow they didn't have time to cultivate amen God fed them but when they went into the land where somebody had already sowed seed and cultivated God stopped the manna from coming they ate the old corn of the land but the next year they had to plant they had to work with the principles because why amen the life that we live in is teaching us we're here for Education amen there's there's a law of gravity can God cause you to defy gravity absolutely he's done it before he can do it again he can stop the sun amen but he didn't stop the Sun every day he stopped the sun once because of a great time of need and something that God wanted to accomplish for his purpose we understand so that means in order to operate amen I can't I can't dawdle all day long on work I need to do amen and finally get to something I need to accomplish while there's still daylight and say God stop the Sun can he yes will he know because you wasted your time and you didn't want to operate within the boundaries that God places to operate in so that we could learn cause and effect we could learn action and reaction so the same thing with decisions we're not going to get away from it we're not going to get around it amen we have to make the decisions but there's a power that comes with making a decision because action begins to follow so we we're placing this God God can break the rules anytime he wants and he does he has for me he asks for you he will again but that doesn't mean we can live Unfaithful and untrue amen and and outside the realm that he placed us and expected God to come on the rescue every time he would be defeating the whole purpose of gravity amen where if you if you jump off of a tower you're going to fall and get hurt amen can God stop you absolutely can God prevent you from getting hurt absolutely but if you're if you're foolish enough to tempt God and to do of your own will gravity is going to take its effect and God's going to allow it he's going to allow your decision your actions to have the necessary consequences to learn that I can't violate all the principles of Nature and expect to live I can't violate all the principles around me and expect to flourish so how can I expect to violate the principles of the word of God and expect anything good to come out of it it all works together amen that's why we train our children that's why we put boundaries on our children and we teach them not to cross the boundaries and then we have his parents to put consequences on those boundaries why we're teaching them the the whole principle of life we're helping build them character they're learning cause and effect they're learning decisions action and consequences why so that they can learn to obey God that they can live in this world and that they can serve God because God's law works the same way so God is going to require that we make our choices and they will have the effect that they're going to have some good some bad amen but they're going to work and it's going to work together for our good amen brother brother I'm speaking here in the patriarch Abraham from 1964 and he's speaking of the three Hebrew children and the fiery furnace said they had to go in the fire when they did they was in the fire and the only thing that taken place this fiery test only unlocked the bands of their of their bands of their hands many times God lets us when we get all bound up with the world bound up he lets the fiery tests come upon us where we have to make a decision and when we do that the only thing the test can do when a real Seed of Abraham is standing at the crossroads of a decision and he makes his decision to serve God it can only cut the bands loose and make us free Satan might give you a disease he might give you one thing another how you know it's not God got you on a Crossroads to see what kind of decision you'll make amen so many things obstacles get worse things I mean you can get to situation your situation at work and get so miserable amen and if they change some personnel and they change some policy and all of a sudden your work situation can become so miserable you can't abide it anymore amen how do you know it's not God trying to bring you to another place amen you don't know amen these things God sometimes pushes us amen into a place where we come to a Crossroads where we have to make a decision amen and that decision is going to bring us into a whole another atmosphere a whole another level a whole another course of action amen if we had it our way well I shouldn't say R if I had it my way I'm sorry so many times I put my own opinion on you guys I'm sorry if I had it my way I want everything predictable and operate the same and I want to know what's going to happen and I want it all everything to be in tidy little spots and compartments and nothing out of order nothing random amen and then I would have security and I wouldn't worry and I also wouldn't pray as much and I wouldn't be dependent on God and I wouldn't search the scriptures and I wouldn't listen to the message for answers and so God will come to time jumble up our world amen and cause us to move into desperation amen and back us into a corner where I don't want to make this decision I don't want to make this decision I don't want to make this decision it's going to cause separation it's going to cause misunderstanding it's going to lead me into a place I'm not sure of the future I don't know what would happen next and God's moving us into a decision amen and that decision we we don't want to make but we keep moving and moving and moving until finally we're like the lepers at the gate I've got to do something I can't sit here and die I can't go here now I've only got one choice I got to start moving praise God I I say Stephen strue used to make the statement he said it to me once and I never forgot it he said you can't steer a parked car and the helm on the ship there's no good when it's at Port if you want God to lead you you got to get moving amen we got to do something we got to move and say Godly we can't just sit on our heels and say God lead me sometimes it makes a decision to get into action and get moving and as you're moving God can steer that ship but sometimes we sit there and say God you take the wheel and you steer and you're like well just push the pedal and what we'll do what we can do amen we got to have faith that God will lead us amen we have to Faith when we make a decision if we're honest-hearted in the decisions we make and we make it according to the word and what we feel is the word of God and we've done our best to judge our motives and John our objectives then if we're wrong we trust God to help us amen he still has a rod he still has a staff he's still a Shepherd who will guide us we have to trust him amen amen Jesus says unto his disciples in John 6 he says wherefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of the father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe in our sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus answered them have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is the devil Jesus I mean the situation here is getting bad the Ministerial Association just left the crowds were leaving things are said that are not easily understood the disciples themselves are in confusion amen and Jesus they they walk away and Jesus just turns to the 12 and says will you go also it's your choice you're free do you want to go and Peter doesn't understand what's happening he doesn't comprehend all that's going on around him all he sees is negative but he knows one thing amen we know that you're Christ the son of the Living God and you have the words of eternal life I don't understand all of this but I'm going to stay right here and Jesus already told him I've not chosen you not chosen me but I've chosen you amen it wasn't you see God has given us free moral agency and he's given us the right to make our decisions but there's certain decisions that no matter how much you make it won't have any effect if God didn't already decide amen you'll never be a Son of God if God hasn't already decided you're a Son of God and you'll never come to the Lord if he hasn't already drawn you amen but when he draws you he gives you the choice of whether or not you'll follow he comes to the disciples washing their Nets and he says hey come follow me they weren't forced they had a choice but they chose to drop their Nets and follow him amen but they could have never done that if he hadn't come to them first so we know certain things in our life are already ordained of God Amen will never come to them unless God had already decided it's not like our decisions will ever supersede his decisions even when we make wrong decisions they'll bring a correction to bring us back into his decision remember when brother Branham when he first met the Pentecostals and he got invitations all over and he went back and told his mother-in-law and his mother-in-law said absolutely refused and chastened him and said you'll not take my daughter and drag her from Pillar To Post and he heeded to to the to the not really advice but to the commands of his mother-in-law and because of that decision he lost his wife and he lost his baby is that right but it was God's will that he goes out to the people it was God's will that he launches out in the ministry amen but he made the wrong decision and he said so himself because of that but but that decision can never change God's decision God now brought a correction and brought a humility and he and he brought a son amen a Brokenness in the Sun that now wants nothing else to listen to no other voice no mother-in-law nobody else but only wants to follow the leading of God and so that wrong decision still works together for good but it can't ever change God's ultimate plan if you'll turn with me to the Book of Ruth I want to keep looking at some of these examples as we work our way through and pray that God will help us glean for our own lives when we go through these examples we don't go just to read stories read things from the past and we're trying to find instruction for the day we're living in now we're wanting to seek God we want answers we want God to show us in the lives of of what he's done in the past with his Saints we want him to tell us what he's doing with us now so he says in Ruth sorry I gotta find it here in Ruth chapter 1 verse 11. Ruth chapter 1 verse 11. and Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you tarry for them till they are grown would you stay for them from having from having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and they wept again and orpa kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for with or thou goest I will go and whether thou largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou dieth will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also of ought but death part me in thee part thee in me then she she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her here we have the story of of Naomi and her husband they went down into the land of Moab because of famine they moved into the land of Moab and their sons married moabitish women and and now the sons die and affliction comes and all the men are dead and now his husband and the two sons are dead and Naomi doesn't understand why this has all come to pass amen and it's all come to pass because God needs her to make a decision to go back to the Homeland amen but but she's not to go back alone but there's one more that needs to go with her but that other one's not going to be forced she's going to make her own choice because that's how God works amen because the holy spirit is a gentleman he doesn't Force anyone now the whole scene plays out they're coming out of the land and now Naomi's telling them there's no hope for you girls amen I cannot bear you another son Amen to replace the husbands you've lost if I had a husband today and I became pregnant today would you wait 18 19 20 years to have a no you go back to your Homeland and there was two women there and they each made a different choice they made a different decision and one decided to go back what was her what was her motive for going back self-preservation she Naomi already told her I'm destitute I'm desolate I have nothing I have nothing to offer you if you come with me you'll have nothing so she decided that's not the life I want I want something out of life so she goes back amen but Ruth was willing to give up her life amen she had a genuine love for Naomi that superseded her love for self and she began to make this decision I'll go with you don't make me leave you where you go all go where you live I'll live where you die I'll die your God will be my God your people my what did she say I'm not turning back I'm not going any other way she made a clean-cut decision when President preaches Amen on this he preaches the four phases of Ruth he preaches Ruth deciding Ruth working and all these things but she had to make a clear-cut decision and that decision brought a whole sequence of events in her life not one decision little did she know how could she at that time know that that decision she made would make her in the lineage of Christ one of the mothers of Christ she would bring forth Obed and oh better bring forth Jesse and Jesse would bring forth King David she was going to be a mother of the king line how could she know that she didn't know that she was just moved by her love for Naomi and she made a clear-cut decision she wasn't waffling she wasn't in between she wasn't saying I'll go along for a while and see how it pans out if she had decided that way she would have left when she was beating out her own barley in the field because it wasn't an easy way it wasn't an easy Road and I'm telling you I think so many times people follow this message wishy-washy amen and said I'm going to go along or I'll go to this church or I'll make this decision or I'll go along amen because we've seen when troubles come they vanish amen when things go south and when things go sour when churches fail when Ministries fail amen when it looks like amen the prophet's Ministries Family they all vanish away amen but I I want to make a clear-cut decision and say this is the truth this is Christ amen I'll live in this message I'll die in this message I'll die believing this message amen and as soon as she made that decision she already declared what she was going to do and she was never going to depart from Naomi and they go back into the land and it's not like all of a sudden they show up amen and they get housing and they get a stipend and they get a government support checking they go into the they return home desolate Naomi amen is too old to work in the fields now Ruth is going out and she's laboring to bring forth a morsel of bread so that they could survive day by day he goes out and she she's gleaning she's going behind the Reapers just finding little bits and she would gather lap fulls of those little bits and she would go herself and she would at the end of the day have to beat it out herself Amen to separate the shock and the hall from the seed and gather the seed into her apron and take just enough back for them to eat then the next day she would have to do the same and the next day she would do the same why was she doing this because action follows decision it wasn't a wishy-washy decision so therefore her action wasn't Meandering it wasn't wondering she was decided this was decided action amen and the action was following her decision orpa may have had it much better maybe in that days if there's some sort of mail carrier and they can write one another and and can you imagine uh Ruth getting a letter from orpa I'm so glad I turned back God has given me a good husband I have a nice house and he's the mayor of the city and we have this and oh by the way I bought a brand new sofa the other day I hope you can come see it yep and Ruth with the clear-cut decision is suffering and suffering praise God sometimes you make the right choice and all it brings is suffering still the right choice still the right choice it doesn't automatically instantly bring uh uh piles of lavishness and rewards and you think if I make the right choice if I make the choice for God and I make the right choice it'll be instantly no most the time that decision has to be tested to see what kind of decision that is is it a clear-cut decision are we going to waffle amen after the decision the test always comes the mayor says in the message Redeemer and Redemption from 1955 said that Ruth not so a type of the Bride when her mother-in-law said now Ruth you turned back she said as the Lord liveth I'll not leave you I'll go with you your people will be my people your God shall be my God and where you die I'll die where you're buried I'll be buried make you making making her choice that's where every man has to come to in life sometimes is make a decision you have to make a choice you had to make a choice whether you was going to have an education or you have to make a choice who's going to be your wife you had to there has to be decisions and choices made in life sometimes we live in such a way that we allow the world to make all our choices for us because we get caught into a stream of life and life has a certain movement to it amen you get up and you work and news happens and things change and you buy groceries and you cut grass and you and there's a certain you can get caught I'd say in the current or stream of life and that life can just kind of carry us along and we can let the culture and let life and let those around us kind of make the decisions for us and we're just kind of Meandering along with the stream and flow of life sometimes we need to stop and ask ourselves do I want to go the way this world is going is that the direction I want to go in if I don't want to go in that direction then I've got to make some decisions for myself and those decisions have to bring me sometimes very character to the culture going absolutely the opposite direction that doesn't always create ease of life and sometimes creates great difficulty amen but I I don't want to be one of those who lets life make decisions for me amen but I want to come by the word of God and my faith in God and I I want to exercise the free moral agencies he's given me and I want to choose the word I want to choose the way with the despised few don't want to just go along and and see what happens and then I'll make my decision you're going to find out nothing ever happens you always stay in this murky gray in between kind of a way constantly sitting on the limb where two ways meet the world and the word constantly finding ourselves in this position why because we never made a clear-cut decision that clear-cut decision brings consequences but it brings actions and those actions move us into a different place amen so we have there has to be decisions and choices made in life sometimes we have to ask ourselves what do I want out of life somebody's good just to stop for a minute and what do I want what do I want my life to be like too many of us we especially when we were young we never stopped to think of that we we never stopped when it come time to make choices about education they make choices about spouses brother bam says that the kind of wife you choose reflects what's in a man and what his goals are amen not just the one who will talk to you and the prettiest one in the group and and those sort of things amen but actually sit down and say what do I want what do I want my family to look like what do I want my home to be like what do I want my children to be like and stop for a minute and quit letting life make choices for us and start making choices based off what we know in the word praise God and not constantly kicking the can down the road I'll see what happens I'll see what happens I'll see what happens I'll see what happens 40 years from now you'll be wanting to see what happens just in the Natural Things amen and the natural things with natural people I mean so many people say I'm not going to worry about retirement when I get there I'll figure it out and they get there and they wish that they could go back 30 or 40 years and start making plans for retirement kicking that can down the road didn't do him any good amen so that's just in the natural but in the spiritual I don't want to wake up 20 years from now and say where have I been what have I done what have I done for the Lord what have I done for somebody else amen I've lived a selfish lives I've been wishy-washy I've been in between I've been a church member but not a bride don't want to be there I want to make decisions and say the decisions Ruth's made were the decisions that kept her making decisions when Ruth made the decision to follow Naomi it forced her to make the decision to work for her annoying me and that decision that caused her to work for Naomi had her light upon the field of Boaz and then Boaz says don't go into any other field stay here so she had that decision led to another decision that led to this decision to stay here and knowing me advisor don't go anywhere else you stay there so she decided to obey Naomi because she had already attached herself to Naomi one decision leads to the next to the next to the next until Naomi finally gives her some instruction one day and she decides to listen to Naomi and listening to Naomi she goes to the threshing floor at night amen she says what she's supposed to say amen and her decisions all along pushed Boaz into a decision foreign how did she get on the threshing floor it started way back when they were leaving Moab where are we today spiritually and how did we get there there were some decisions made way back and we find ourselves good if we find ourselves bad wherever we find ourselves where we want to be here where we don't want to be amen it wasn't just circumstances that happened it was decisions that we made have us where we are now we made decisions and those decisions caused us to make other decisions and cause us to make other decisions remember that I said I I was I said some time ago I don't remember but I said the difference between me and the drug addict and the drunk and the gutter is maybe three or four bad decisions because one decision will force you into another decision that'll force you into another decision amen and I say God Amen well I have the ability well I have a right mind well I'm standing in a place where I can't I want to choose the word above everything else I want to choose this word that you've restored in this day through a prophet and I want that to be my guide and I want this scripture that's come back and been restored to the church to be my absolute and I want to subject myself to that just as much as Ruth amen attached herself to Naomi I want to attach myself to this word which is Christ my husband the headship and say where you go I'll go what you say I'll do what you instruct I'll all obey I want to do it now while I have the ability to make the choice and then not see what happens and then choose I don't want to wait and see what happens I want to choose now because what I choose now will dictate what happens next and one choice leads to another choice and the decisions we make today will cause us to make other decisions later and if I made that decision amen and surrendered back to Christ a hundred percent then that's going to push me into another decision because that decision will bring me to another Junction where I have to separate from unbelief how did I get to this decision because I made the first decision I have to break relationships I'll have to move maybe I may have to move locations I may have to I may have to whatever I may have to cut Family Ties I may have to do different things how did I get here because I made that decision that decision will help me make this decision praise amen I don't want just to let life happen and figure it out I want to make my decision well God's given me the right to make my decision a whole lot of indecision has caused us to make irrational decisions and those quick decisions and irrational decisions have got us in trouble and that decision will lead to another decision and lead to another decision next thing you know you're so far away from where you ever wanted to be your life is in such a place you thought I would I never thought when I was a 16 17 year old young man or a 16 17 year old woman I never dreamed that I'd be here I never dreamed that I'd have a broken family I never dreamed that I would have this contention I never dreamed that I'd have these habits in my life I never dreamed that I'd have these vices I never dreamed then that I would be aware but I made choices then that are causing me to make choices now you young people you're in a golden spot you're in a beautiful spot amen but but you're moving beyond the age of accountability somewhere in 12 13 14 and you're moving to a place where God's holding you accountable for the decisions you make I tell you with all that's in me amen choose God choose Christ choose this word stick with the message amen with all that's in me make it your own choice not somebody else's choice not my choice make it your choice don't just wait and see what happens don't kick the can down the road make it your choice amen to many young people we've seen them they they delayed making that choice they were part of the church part of the message because their parents were part of the message they they believed intellectually they believed because they were taught to believe and but but when they got a little more freedom and they moved out from Mom and Dad's house they had never made a clear-cut decision and so when they when they moved to Mom and Dad's house they get married and one of the first things they do is buy a TV now that's not nowadays because everybody's got computers but way back when first thing to do is buy a TV and because now they can make their own choices but that choice leads to another choice and leads to another choice and and now we find the young people they'll marry one another they were believers they looked apart they acted the part they sang in church they said amen to the word but because they never made a clear-cut decision when they come to the age of accountability amen and they moved forward and just kept delaying a full commitment delaying a full commitment amen so many of them their lives are in ruin right now they have broken homes broken families don't believe the word are dealing with all kinds of consequences why because decisions lead to decisions and while you have the chance to make the decision don't delay don't wait and see what happened don't say I want to get married first and I want to try a few of these things first and I want to experience a little bit of Life first you don't want any of that because all of those choices will lead you to other choices every one of those decisions will cause you to have to make another decision but I say make the decision like Ruth made and make it fast and make it first and make it right out of the shoot and make it make a decided effort to say this is the way for me it's going to be everybody else can do what they want but I am taking the way of the word and just making that commitment and making that decision will cause you to make another decision it'll cause you when you come to the hour of Temptation because you will come to the hour of Temptation amen when you come to your own Junction where you're sitting at the fork of a tree amen and you can go the way of pleasure or you can go the way of the word because you already made a declaration that I'm going to go with the word that'll cause you to make another decision when you come to the crooks of the street but if you've never made that decision before and you come now and you're sitting where two ways meet your ways in God's way and you never gave up your life and gave it to Christ and you never made your decision for him in the word when you get to this place amen the world and the Temptations and the lust of the flesh amen they'll begin to move on you and you'll find yourself making another choice and then that decision it may seem so simple and so innocent but that decision will cause you to make another decision how many young women would love if they could get their virginity back they gave it away they gave it away to somebody they thought loved them they gave it away to somebody they thought amen but but it was all lust it was all for pleasure it was all taking the way of self versus The Way of the word and how many women suffer for that the rest of their life that would allowed to take it back I tell you it was because you didn't make a decision that you made a decision if you had made a decision and say I'm going with the word regardless of what anybody else says amen and then and then then I make another decision if I decide to give myself to Christ into the word now I'm not going to give mine affections to any boy that comes down the road but that boy is going to have to have the same desire and commitment that I have and if he's got the same desired commitment I have he's not going to play with my emotions and play with my body amen so lack of a decision here causes a wrong decision here but the right decision here will cause you to make the right decision when you come to the junction amen amen I mean this is practical this is where we get practical practical practical amen and sometimes maybe I'm too practical none of spiritual but I've been a pastor long enough that this is the way it is this is the way it actually is this is the reality of life we make choices we make decisions and God lets us do it amen will they work together for his glory absolutely will they bring correction will they bring lessons absolutely amen but will I have the opportunity and while you have the opportunity I encourage you to make the choice for the word and make your declaration and make your commitment and make it verbal and tell somebody else because the wishy-washy in between never making a clear-cut decision will cause you to make the wrong decision but when you begin to declare it to people this is what I want this is how I'm going to live this is the decision I make it'll help you make the next decision how many young men would love love to be able to take control back over their mind because they gave their mind over to lust by making decisions no just trapped and addictions and their mind takes in places they don't want to go because why because of decisions why didn't God stop me how many times have men and women cried God why didn't you stop me because he already gave you his word amen he didn't stop Israel when they decided to go into adultery because he already told him what would happen if they go into adult he already laid it out before them amen in Deuteronomy and Moses already said I've set before you life and death choose life and when they got to the place where they began to choose death God already gave them the privilege to make that choice he wasn't going to take it away and God is setting before us week after week sermon after sermon life and death and I say God help us to choose life help us to make a clear-cut choice and choose life not just come and listen and walk out listen and walk out listen and walk out but listen and choose listen and choose listen and choose decide I am going to surrender to the word amen we know in the in the Book of Genesis we know it's familiar I'm just going to skim through it in Genesis 13. we know there came a time a decision between Abraham and lot and Abraham had to move into the promise and there had to be a separation amen but lot was given the privilege of making his decision and Abraham said you go where you want you go to the right I'll go to the left you go to the left I'll go to the right and lot now was sitting at a junction where two ways meet and he had a decision to make where am I going to go and set up my camp and when he looked down at the plane of Sodom it was well watered like the garden of God like like Egypt and it was a great place for prosperity and it was a great place for wealth amen and he chose to pitch towards Sodom amen and I asked you was that a decision of self yes and that decision leads to more decisions and lot chose to pitch towards Sodom and lot he pitched his tent towards Sodom but later we find out he's in Sodom so just for a little personal gain just for a little Prosperity just for a little easier living and brother Brennan said it left it left Abraham up there in the rocky soil he got the he got the worst end of the deal he got the worst land amen but Abraham was blessed amen because he gave preference to law and lot chose wrong Abraham stayed and Abraham was blessed yeah so lot makes a choice for a little bit easier life a little bit easier way and that choice doesn't have him pitched or Sodom and that choice has him inside him and and that choice has him marry off his daughters to Sodom my men and Sodom and then when it in the end it has lost heart turned towards the ways of Sodom and then in the end when he gets rescued out of that because God's going to rescue him for Abraham say when God rescues him out of that he's lost some of his daughters and his brother-in-law he loses his wife and he's left with two daughters sometimes we say well if I make a mistake God will correct me God will correct you but what will you lose what effect will it have I mean what in the interim between making the wrong decision and trusting God Amen to get you back on track when you know you're doing wrong amen let me people I mean I remember as a child I had this mentality I was raised in the Pentecostal church I was raised believing the Bible I was raised with a certain understanding of right and wrong and I had this understanding amen that that if I'm a Child of God I can always repent and it'll be okay I had that head knowledge amen and that caused me to make compromises because I knew if I Repent God would forgive me and those compromises have had lifetime effects mentally you're ashamed of things you did things you said actions you took you can't say it's depend on God to fix everything for you he'll fix it all right if you're a child of God you'll be saved if you're a child of God you'll not be lost amen but what will you suffer what will we suffer because we choose self what will the ones around us suffer what will our children suffer and what will our friends and what will all around us suffer because of the decisions we make we need to be all in First Kings 18. What a Sad spot to spend Years Around the message and still not know if it's true or not or if it can be trusted or if it's subject for all of life First Kings 18. First Kings 18 verse 21. in First Kings 18 21 this is the Mount Carmel Showdown and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halchi between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bailed and follow him and the people who answered him not a word I think this is an amazing scripture Elijah comes up it wasn't that they weren't worshiping Jehovah he says why halt you between two opinions they were straddling the fence they were in the middle of the road amen if if God be God if Lord be God follow him if Baal be God follow him why are you mixing this thing together why are you in between why don't you make a clear-cut decision on one or the other this is where Elijah's bringing them Mount Carmel Showdown is bringing them to a clear-cut decision he says why halt you so the nation of Israel was halting between two opinions amen and that's exactly where the world was when the prophet showed up because they didn't understand what was wrong with all the denominationalism and the corruption of the word and changing the word and mixed man's ideas in with it he said why halt you between two opinions if the word is right trust the word if the church is right trust the church because that's where we were amen is the church writers the word right because the church has changed the word and it's mixed together they're using part of the word and dismissing part of it it become mixed why halt you between two opinions is the Bible writers the Bible wrong amen why halt you between two opinions when Peter said repent and be baptized and then in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was he right or was he wrong because you talk to people and say well Peter said this way Jesus said it this way I'll take what Jesus said well you understand that mentality when we go down that road then all of a sudden we've said Peter after being up in the upper room filled with the Holy Ghost which is supposed to lead and guide him into all truth immediately after that he will teach false Doctrine on the opening message of the inaugural message of the new church so what you've just done is you've just declared Peter amen Peter's not right here Jesus is right here and then the question is what else does Peter have wrong and if Paul's a woman hater and never been married and not really somebody we need to listen to on the subject of marriage and divorcing of women then what else did Paul have wrong all of a sudden amen the whole world is standing here between the church and the word amen and the question is why halt you between two opinions either the word is absolutely right or the church is absolutely right pick one and Elijah showed up in this day in this scenario in this scene and he's standing on on a Mount Zion Showdown and he's saying you pick it's the word or the church you can't have both [Applause] and we see that in the laodicean church age he says because you're neither Luke you're neither hot or cold but lukewarm I'll speed you out you're mixing you're in between God doesn't want in between he wants you red hot or ice cold declare where you're at make your decision and declare where you're at it's either right or it's wrong it's either true or it's false quit mixing [Music] and so that's the condition of the Legacy in church age mixing and that's what gets spewed out of his mouth praise God brother man says in the message spiritual Amnesia he says so sorry so so worry has no virtue in it at all but faith has all virtue believe now where he sometimes causes it and what do you mean by calls it he's saying spiritual Amnesia he said Amnesia and naturally said can be caused by over worry it can be caused by stress he starts talking about what can cause Amnesia and this is the message spiritually amnesia and he goes now he says and another thing that causes it among the people is getting between two opinions that'll cause amnesia and it gets you to a place where you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around eating everything but you still you can't identify yourself why this is amnesia and now he's talking about spiritual Amnesia and what can cause Amnesia you can get halt between two opinions and here the nation of Israel they were halt between two opinions and they were in spiritual Amnesia they forgot what Moses said they forgot what God had done they forgot all the Miracles and they'd forgotten who they were supposed to be they were supposed to be the Oracles of God they were supposed to be the display of God on the earth through working through a nation they were supposed to project the light of the Lord to the world they were supposed to be a light set on the hill projecting the very nature of God to the whole world and here they are in spiritual Amnesia forgetting who they really are amen confused and now they worshiping Baal and worshiping Jehovah and then the lines are blurred somewhere in between here just like in this day the bride has lost touch of who she is amen and we come in the laodice CNAs the prophet had to come Amen to break the spiritual Amnesia of the church because they didn't know if they were methodists they didn't know if they were Baptist they didn't know if there were Pentecostals they didn't know if all were okay they didn't know who they were and they didn't realize that they are the word and so he came not so he could halt between two opinions but so that we could make our decision amen and break spiritually Amnesia and come back to the word of God to be the word so being hot between hot between two if he's not making a clear-cut decision will bring spiritual Amnesia where you can't even clearly identify Who You Are we know that Elijah comes to Mount Carmel and he comes in obedience to the word of God and He does everything God says he pours the water on he lays the sacrifice he does it all the prophets of Baal they and the priests they tried and they couldn't get any fire to come down and all of a sudden fire comes down and licks up the water and the sacrifice and the stones and all and in First Kings 18 39 says and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God they knew then they weren't halt between two opinions anymore they saw who was God the same things happen to us friends God has showed himself and he showed who's gone they showed where God is and God is his word not just mixing this blending this denominational Church idea he's his word and through a prophet he showed us amen I say God help us to bow on our faces and say he the Lord he is gone and I will devote my whole life to him and nothing else amen and the message choosing of a bride brother says you have also a choice when you choose this church you can choose whether in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or the other church has their Creed and then there is the word of God you have a choice of you have to make the choice there's an unwritten law Among Us of choosing I believe it was Elijah one time up on Mount Carmel after The Showdown and a great hour of Crisis that we just about to come to right now perhaps it may be to you or I tonight that we make this Choice like the Mount Carmel experience frankly I think it's going on worldwide now but there will soon be a time where there you'll have to make a choice amen I don't I don't know what future holds but but remember so there's coming a time you have to make a choice and the choice you makes now will help you make the choice then the decision we make now will cause us to make another decision later man if we decide to stay with disbelief then we're going to make another decision later we decide to serve self we're going to make another decision later but if we like Ruth can make a decision I'm sacrificing all I am all I have all my life Ruth didn't say I'll go along with you and when I see that things are going to work out I'll go on Long further and if they don't work out I'm coming back see that's not going to work that's not going to work because when things got rough she would have just moseyed on back and how many times do we see people who make a commitment to serve Christ but when the first trial comes the first hardship comes they they wander back I said God help us I don't want to be that while I've Got My Mind straight while I know the word well I've got an opportunity I'm making my choice I'm making my decision brother man was had this experience and you'll remember where brother had preached the message and and a man by the name of Danny Henry comes up to him and he puts his arms around him and he begins to break out in tongues and he speaks French and there's three in the crowd that can speak French there's a woman from Louisiana there's Victor Ledoux and then there's an interpreter for the United Nations and they all give the same interpretation of what Danny Henry spoke in French and I'm going to read just a small portion and he says because thou has chosen this straighten their way the harder way you've done it at your own choosing but what a glorious decision you've made because it's my way brother Brennan wasn't forced to go God's way but he decided to go God's way and God spoke back to him and said what a glorious decision you have made because it is my way he went ahead and said then this in itself is that which will bring to pass and make and bring to pass the tremendous victory in love divine he's taking the tremendous victory in love divine in attaching it to brother branham's decision because this is a momentous decision there's a glorious decision you made because it is my way and this in itself will bring to pass the great victory in Divine love my look at what was weighing on that man's decision look at the power of that decision was unlocked by that decision look at what that decision led to another decision in bra it brought us to the place we are today friends we're standing here preaching In a Pulpit we're sitting saying Amen to the word because that man made a decision that he wasn't forced to make that he did himself and he made a full commitment and a full surrender amen he got stopped the first time he was going to go out by his mother-in-law amen he cowered under her pressure and he made the wrong decision amen but when that thing come full circle when he made a decision he made a decision for good and he never backed off of that decision he went and it kept him going and kept him going and kept him going and you and I are here benefactors of that decision amen what if he had chose the easier way what do you chose the way that caused less rejection less personal pain less hardship to his family what if you chose the way that that allowed him more popularity in an easier life we wouldn't be standing here God would oh we would because it was ordained of God but he would have to change the whole thing again see the decisions we make are not just for ourselves but they affect everyone around us they affect our wives our husbands our children or our loved ones they affect all those around us we've got to be got to be wise we've got to look into the word we've got to be led by the spirit we've got to be decisive about what we do I I've come to the place where I I don't want to be a meanderer in life I want to be decisive I don't want to let life happen to me but I want to decide how I'm going to react I want to decide what I what I believe and what I believe I want to season every decision don't want to just get tossed about by every circumstance but I want my decision to hold me through all the circumstances Ruth's decision held her through everything stay true to what she had chose but she decided I want to stay true but it's not just brother branham's decision that brings great victories in the word of God it's ours too because God is going to have a bride Christ will have a bride and she will be submissive of her own choosing he's looking for a submissive bride and you'll never be bride unless he first decided your bride but he's looking for one that'll decide that he's the head and he only and I'm not he is that no other man is he is and that they'll surrender completely to the headship because that's what this that's what the sleeping Saints are waiting for is for this bride to come into perfection in Revelations chapter 17 verse 14 he says these these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful another man begins to break this down in the fourth heel you're called by predestination you're chosen by election is that right you didn't have anything to do with that that was God but in the third attribute to these that are with him are faithful and that is what I want to look at brother Ben says in the fourth seal he says he's got wrote Life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death gathered his Earthbound delegates in Christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects Saints he's got death wrote on him Christ's got life wrote on him those with him are on white horses also and they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word brother remember said amen I like that called chosen before the foundation world and then faithful to the word by their choosing the first two parts of that you had nothing to do with you were called you were chosen that's by predestination and election but that third part is faithful and he said faithful by their own choosing I said oh God help me to be faithful by my truth if I get to choose that's what I want to choose if it's my decision to make that's what I decide help me God forgive me for my wrong decisions help me Amen brother Madam says uh all the way back in 1958 and Queen of Sheba says God don't always work on the easy Road the things that's at your hand you have to struggle to do the will of God sometimes God don't work on the easy Road you have to struggle to do the will of God Amen if you're going to do that then you've got to decide ahead of time this is the way I'm taking because it's not going to be the easy Road it's going to be a struggle many times but you have to decide ahead of time that's the way I'm going he says in the message faithful Abraham from 55 he says now God's elect people over in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and about the fifth verse Paul States the word predestinated us to the adoption of sons now that doesn't mean that God just puts you in a little Channel and runs you through and you can't help how you go when you would then you would be no reward but God gives you the free moral agency to make your choice but God will keep us believer we're called predestinated but that doesn't mean brother said you're shoved through a pipe pulled out the other end and everything's glorious no then there's no reward God will keep the believer absolutely but you've got choices to make I've got choices to make and then there's a statement that brother Bennett makes in Jehovah Jireh says you're never too old to God as long as you've got surrendered heart and a will to do the will of God you have to have a surrendered heart and a will to do the will of God I said oh God I want to have a will to do your will as long as you've got a surrendered heart and a will to do the will of God God always will receive you no matter how old you are how young you are what does it take a surrendered heart and a will to do the will of God oh praise God again he says in marriage of the lamb from 1962. I mean he says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got something to do too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself you have the decision for myself I have to make decision for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God amen turn with me to the Book of Joshua Book of Joshua chapter 24. Joshua 24. in verse 14. Joshua 24 and 14. Joshua speaks is now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord never seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods with your father serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord Joshua comes down and he poses a question to the people he put poses an opportunity to the whole congregation choose you this day who you'll serve you're going to serve the gods your father served if you want to serve the gods of the amorites and whose lands we go you can choose see they weren't forced you can choose to serve who you want to serve but he makes a clear-cut decision and he makes it verbal and he makes it vocal and he makes his claim he said but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord everybody else can do whatever they want amen everybody around us can do whatever they want but we meet may we have this kind of Revelation that says as for me and my house we will serve the Lord we will surrender to this word we will make our decision to stay with the message of the hour because God's word is true in every other man's word is a lie he says in remembering the Lord Brothers says I want to draw another little thing here it comes to my mind when Jesus was on trial and for nothing else but mockery sake he was sent from pilate to Heron from pilate didn't have to do that you know he tried to wash his hands of it but once on your hands you got to make your decision you can't push it on somebody else it's you as an individual he said when it came to pilate pilate did not want to condemn Jesus pilate knew something was fishy about this and they delivered him for envy and he didn't want this so when he finds out that he's of herod's jurisdiction that Galilean he sends him to Herod he wants Herod to make the decision because he doesn't want to make the decision and all this is human nature friends this is such human nature amen you want somebody else to make the decision so somebody else Bears the consequences for the decision sends him to Heron let her decide but Herod wouldn't choose Herod sent him back to Pilot because brother Branham said once he's on your hands he's on your hands you've got to make your decision God's not going to let us off so easy once it comes to our lap we've got to make our choice and I've seen already where people they'll come to a minister or come to a pastor and they want the pastor to make the choice for them so the pastor can bear the consequences for the choice [Music] and I say God help me never to fall into that trap I say hey wait a minute this is this is your decision to make not my decision I'll show you the word what I see in the word but I cannot make these decisions for you amen because this is in your life amen but that's what we do we want a mom or a dad we want a parent we want an elder we want an older brother we want to minister We Trust we want a pastor we want somebody else to make the decision for us because if it doesn't go well then we can just they told me they said brother so-and-so said sister so and said my dad said it's not my fault but don't be surprised when that thing comes right back around the circle again winds up in your lap again because we've got to make our own personal choice and personal stand for the word I like I liked the way Ruth did it and I like the way Joshua did it you do whatever you want but I'm publicly declaring as for me and my house will serve the Lord because I've got to make a clear-cut decision then if we go in Joshua 24 on down after Joshua declares this and he lays it before the people you come to verse 21 and the people send unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people you are witness against yourselves that ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses they said not just you we're not going to serve any other God we're going to serve the Lord and he says now you've become a witness against yourself what you declared and say we're the winner we're making a public statement as well as you it's not just you it's me too that we will serve the Lord so this is the first generation now that's entering into Canaan land so let's go to judges and let's look now into judges Judges chapter 2. Judges chapter 2 verse 6. in Joshua in judges 2 and verse 6 he said and when Joshua had let the people go the children of Israel when every man into his inheritance to possess the land and the people serve the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath Harry's in the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of the hill goash and also all that generation were gathered into their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and served Balaam they forsook the Lord God of their fathers which brought them out of the land of Egypt followed other gods of the Gods of the people that were around about them and bowed themselves into them and provoked the Lord to anger we see the we see a generation that came out of Egypt and that generation came out of Egypt they come to a decision and God put the question to them and they made their choice they made the decision Joshua made it and the elders made it but we find now as we move into a second generation now coming into the promised land now we have as long as Joshua who made his commitment was alive they served the Lord as long as the elders were alive they served the Lord but when Joshua and the elders begin to get gathered Amen to their fathers now all of a sudden There Rose up a generation and this generation didn't make that commitment that was made by their fathers and we're we're we're in a situation now where the prophet's been off the scene for a while and many of us have had the privilege of leaving Egypt and making our declaration many of you and many of me are me included we had our opportunity to leave Egypt and we come and say no as for me and my house I'm going to serve the Lord amen but all of us who've made those decisions we've had another generation come up and I want to speak to you young people now don't don't just let your mom and dad make a commitment don't let Mom and Dad make a declaration don't let Mom and Dad decide who they're going to serve you've been serving the lord under their commitment amen but God is gathering home all the elders and now I put the question to you today amen if you're beyond the age of accountability 13 and Beyond who will you serve amen will you serve yourself your flesh the world or where you serve Jesus Christ amen the word that's been restored in this day don't just say mom and dad and grandma and grandpa the church the pastor but now the questions coming down personally we all have to make a decision and the quicker you're able to make the decision the better the decisions you're going to make next amen don't let it be somebody else's don't let it be the church declaration don't let it be the elders declaration but let it be my personal declaration that I say as for me you may not have a house yet but as for me and this house I live in we will serve the Lord amen because when it comes to another generation who didn't make that declaration it began to mix again become right back like the denomination to begin to mix again I say this brother bear said this bride won't fail she's not going back that way there's going to come another generation that's going to come up and say I not my mom and dad I will serve the Lord not just my church I if the church fails I've already made my commitment and I'm a witness against myself today that I choose this message in this word praise God sometimes we just need to make the commitment quit waiting to see what will happen and hope it'll work out and someday no just say there's something in me now that knows that I've got a privilege to make a decision and the question's been put before me and I'm going to take my opportunity that I have today and say ask for me my will my desire is to do the will of the Lord my desire is to serve him all the days of my life where he is I am where he goes I go what he says I do amen the way he wants me to live I want to live I want to give everything else up and stick with this word amen if you don't make the decision life will begin to happen then you'll make quick decisions and those decisions will lead to other decisions but while we have the opportunity say God I'm surrendering my life to you what Ruth did to Naomi I'm doing to Christ I want to give all my life to you we've got a a privilege to exercise free moral agency I don't want to be haphazard with it or loose or flippant but I want to be sincere if God's given me the right to make a choice and I feel in my heart that he's chosen me then I'm deciding to follow him with all my heart with all my life see many of you have made hard choices to serve the Lord talk got a chance to talk to many of you through the years you've made hard choices hard separations you've moved across the country you've picked up families you've left jobs you've had lost relationships you've done all kinds of things to serve the Lord but oh you'll never regret it you who've made those decisions and and and left places and moved to other places and left behind jobs and struck out not knowing where you go do you have any regrets for putting the Lord first no I have no regrets amen I mean we've given up jobs we've given up businesses we've given up friendships we've given up familiar areas we've given up so many things and I can tell you I have no regrets amen the only regret I have is I didn't give up earlier and I didn't give up more I meant the biggest regret of my life is when I come to a junction that I took the choice for self that's the greatest regret I have but I have no regrets for taking God's way all of my regrets or decisions I made that had self-mixed in men say God and I decide you this word is true I have no other option I have no other option the message is the truth the prophet of God was the voice of Malachi 4 the seventh angel and He restored the word of God back to the bride and it's true and it's been Vindicated amen we have the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication I have no other option but to give my life completely to this there's no plan B there's no turning back it's either all right or all wrong I can't mix it with anything else I can't mix it with my ideas or even my emotional feelings about it I can't do any more mixing all I can do is say where this word leads I have to go amen where this word is I have to stay where this word says I have to obey I don't have an option amen that's the decision we have to make amen is not the next wave of doubt the next wave of failure the next ministers who fall away and churches are split you'll see more Spanish but oh I don't want to be like that I want to be the ones that said I'm sticking with this word amen if I wind up the only believer in the world sitting at home listening to a tape I can't leave this word amen God help us and we know we have no power to keep ourselves we have no power to do it ourselves amen but it takes a clear brother I said it takes a clear-cut decision for Christ and that's what I want to give when Eliezer when Eliezer came to Rebecca's house amen he was led by the angel of the Lord he was the servant of Abraham to go fetch a son for the for uh for fetch a bride for the promised son he's doing his commission he's doing his work and we know brother Brandon fulfilled this amen and he comes to Rebecca and supernaturally she Waters the camels and all that and he goes back to uh her he goes back to the family house and he begins to give them gifts and he begins to lay out the reason for his Aaron and he finally says don't delay me he wakes up in the morning don't delay me let me go and they say no stay 10 days Terry a little longer we don't want to part with our our sister he says no don't delay me and finally living says let's bring the damsel let's ask her amen she can make her own decision so they brought Rebecca and Rebecca Heyman was already moving under that anointing because by inspiration she watered the camel so she was already in the right line of inspiration and now they gave her the opportunity to make her decision and now eliezer's there her family's there everybody's there and the question is put to her will you go with this man and she says I will go amen all right where are you going you're leaving your family you're leaving your neighborhood you grew up you're leaving everything you're going with a man you just met yesterday going to marry a man you've never met in your life amen what are you doing she says I will go now oh praise God and that decision led to other decisions and other decisions and finally she became the matriarch in the line of Christ she became part of the promised word and she became a womb that the word was coming through oh praise God not say well we'll wait and see give me 10 days to think about it no this is the truth and I'm giving all myself to it right now this word is true Jesus never forced anybody in fact he gave him every opportunity to leave Moses comes and says choose life or death you choose Joshua comes and he says choose which God Shall Serve Jesus comes and says will you go also God he's not forcing us you don't have to come to church on Sunday you don't have to believe the message you don't have to line up to the word you don't have to surrender your will you don't have to he's given us the opportunity amen and and listen there's enough voices out there on the message you can find whichever one suits your own personal liking God's left it all out there why doesn't God shut this down why doesn't God shut this down in this false hey it's all going and it's all prospering so if you've got your own personal taste and personal desire you can find a you can find a flavor of the message to match what fulfills your own lusts or you can say forget it all I just want the word and the word only I just want to surrender to the word I'm tired of having my own way I just want it the way the prophet taught it I just want the truth I just want the restored word not myself anymore but him that's what I want say God granite will you go also Jesus says leave your nets and come follow me then he turns and walks away he doesn't stand and plead and beg he doesn't rationalize he doesn't he doesn't start offering Rewards [Music] now I see Peter you're taking a little bit of time to make your decision listen what if I throw in eternal life and what if I throw in you get to be the big man in the church no he says come follow me he turns and he walks away and now Peter's got to make his decision Hey listen this message is moving on regardless of what you think about it it's moving on this word's coming to the full manifestation of itself and it's going to take place in a body of Believers on this Earth and it's going to move on and it's going to go into place and this word is going to produce what it's called to produce amen it's moving on and I want to move with it amen I I want to move with it and I want to I want to be able to make my claim and my statement and said I'm going I'll leave all forsake everything and I'll go and that decision that I made years ago has led me to another decision and led me to another decision to another decision and it asked me where I am now sometimes my wife and I will reflect on where our lives would have been she was a college student loved college she was in her last year's school when we heard the message when we when we first heard the message like she was expecting Blake in if we would have went down that road she would have worked I would have worked we'd had two careers children would have been in daycares and babysitters we would have went to a nominal church we would have we would have lived a Halfway Christian Life been busy with the world the kids would have been in every Sports activity next director curricular activity they had had friends with all the world where would our lives be right now if it wasn't for this message we have families that are intact we have marriages that are prospering we have youth that are growing up and becoming Godly men and women we have youth that can act masculine and act feminine they've got young men that can take responsibility we've got ladies who are sensitive and thoughtful to each other to be where does that come from amen those were decisions that people had made and God Amen brought the word to pass in their lives they chose to go the word and the word worked and the word did all of this I don't regret once leaving everything for the message I don't regret the separations the heartaches they hurt I don't regret the rejections I don't regret it all because it it brought me to a greater life I feel like Ruth now amen I feel like I've come to a place where I've been restored I've been brought into the promise amen amen through the womb of my spirit is coming forth the the promised sign amen what did I do to earn it nothing amen what did I do to put myself here nothing all there was was something in me that said I believe this word is true and I'll stick with it amen and it brought me to a place that I could never dream of being before paper you've made similar decisions and similar results and what do we want to do now I want to keep going on I want to stick with my commitment I'm not changing my mind amen I'm not changing my mind when I made my the Declaration that I in my house we will serve the Lord I'm sticking with it still because I see what the word has done young people this is your hour this is your time many of us have made our decisions many of us have made our declarations many of us have had to get shaved down and shaved off and cut out now it's your turn what will you do what will you do with this Jesus called Christ will you wait and see how things go will you wait till after you're married will you wait till you finish school will you wait till you've enjoyed a few Pleasures in life will you wait till you've experienced a little bit of the world questions put to you what will you do with this Jesus called Christ I tell you if you can do what Ruth did and you can do what Rebecca did and you can do what the disciples did then you could spare yourself from a whole lot of heartaches poor choices and regrets I'm not I'm thankful for my life and I'm thankful where I'm at and everything's worked out perfect I don't want to change anything but if I could sit where you're sitting now and make the choice that's offered to you now I would do it in a flash of a second yeah if I could free my mind from images of the past it free my mind from regrets from the past and I could serve the Lord all the days of my life if I could change places with you I would do it in a fraction of a second because this is the only way worth going so I encourage you make your choice side for the word not just young people old people sometimes those of us middle age and Beyond sometimes we've been hanging around with little doubts and little questions and not a full commitment and waiting to see and feeling things out it's time to stop that it's time to stop that it's either true or it's not true it's either the word or it's not the word it's time to make a commitment make a full commitment and say I'm sticking with this word I'm following Christ with all my heart and all my life if it costs me my friends it cost me if it cost me family it costs me if it cost me it cost me that's my decision and let's all Stand Together amen let's bow our heads together musicians become whether John if you'll come please let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord thank you God that you've come by our way oh we look at the so many of your Saints in the scriptures they each had an opportunity they had an opportunity at some point Ruth and orpa had an opportunity they made different choices Lord Rahab had an opportunity she made her choice Rebecca had an opportunity Rachel had an opportunity Lord so many of your people had an opportunity Abraham had an opportunity Peter John Paul they each in their turn had their opportunity Lord and you never forced anyone but you invited them and God you're not forcing us today but you're inviting us to make our decision by the children of Israel had their opportunity those who entered the promised land had their opportunity Joshua and Caleb had their opportunity the other ten spies had theirs as well oh God I don't want my opportunity to pass me by but I want to say I surrender all I give my life to you Lord Wherever You Lead I'll follow whatever your word says I desire to obey help me in my commitment lord I can't keep myself I can't make anything come to pass but if you've given me the privilege to make a decision that's the decision I make I want the will to do your will help us Lord help each one of us Lord if there's those who've never made that commitment I pray that you'd stir their hearts now may they not be wishy-washy or on the fence but may they come to a clear-cut decision that if I get to decide this is what I choose bless our young people Lord You've sheltered them and you've watched over them and you blessed them so mightily I pray God that you'd help them in the hour of decision that they would choose you Above All Else they would surrender completely fully to you they would follow after this word that you've restored in this hour with all their lives and with all their hearts God may you keep them bless them encourage them we give ourselves to you and we ask God that you have your way with us for we surrender with all we know how we surrender to you we pray God that you would do with us what we never dreamed possible but we're incapable of would you take a life that surrendered and with a desire to serve and would you give us by your Holy Spirit the capacity and ability to live your word we can't do it but Lord we invite you to come and take full possession no we want you we want you Above All Else and Lord we're we're empty when it comes to ability to maintain your word to live it to display but God if your Holy Ghost will come inside you will take up residence within us and Quicken the life to see that's there then you can live through these yielded vessels your very word or may you accomplish that may it be accomplished today in the life of someone here they will surrender or make their commitment we love you God we ask for your blessings as we part we go when we come back for communion we let you watch over us and bring us back safely love your father and ask for your blessings in our lives help us Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and brother John I have decided to follow Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus Jesus I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no turning back and his whole world but give me Jesus oh take this whole world but give me Jesus oh take this but give me Jesus I won't turn back I won't turn back at the cross before me the World Behind Me the [Music] love for me the world Journey baby no turning back no none going with me still I will follow me still I will follow [Music] turning back no turning back amen God bless you amen I thank God that he came my way and he gave me an opportunity you read the Bible and you see all those opportunities I wish I had the opportunity Peter had I wish brother bear said he wished he had the opportunity the foot wash monkey had her he wished he had the opportunity the messenger had that came to Jesus that day who missed his opportunity he came and delivered a message to the master and brother bear said oh I wish I were him I would have fell at his feet and kissed his feet and told him how much I loved
