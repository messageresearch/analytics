TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen let's just take our bibles and turn to revelations chapter 20. we're going to continue on in the book of life i had mentioned that you might want to bring your church age book today we're going to read several patches out of the church age book and take a look at this subject of the book of life revelations chapter 20 and we will read at verse 11. revelations 2011 reads and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire let's just pray their heavenly father as we turn our attention to your word we just ask lord that you would open the pages of this word lord it's not the ability to read or to comprehend or understand that we're looking for lord we're looking for something much greater than that we pray lord that you would give us a revelation of what your word is really telling us in this hour and god i pray that you would use these lips lord and use this vessel for your glory and give us all ears to hear and our heart to receive all the truth that you have for us we ask your blessings over this service in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated now last time we talked about we started in the book of life we started with the sovereignty of god because we see in here there's a book called the book of life and at the white throne judgment all those whose names are on the book of life enter into eternal life but if your name is not found on the book of life then you're you go into the lake of fire so this is a really important book right i say this is the important book of all important books in all the bible because it determines eternal destination and so we wanted to find out if if this is an important book and whether my name is on there or not determines what my eternal destination is going to be then i must find out how to get my name on that book and last week we found out that you can't do anything to get your name on the book that if your name was ever on the book your name was put there on that book before the foundation of the world when the lamb and the mind of god was slain to redeem those who are on the book so nothing is being added to this book now there are names that can be removed from the book but we're going to talk about that next week this week we want to move from the sovereignty of god in the book of life and start talking about two parts and two resurrections because there's two parts to the book of life and for the gentiles there are two resurrections so we want to we want to look at those because those two parts have everything to do with the two resurrections all right just to back up for a minute i want to talk about the church age book because last time we talked about there there are some opinions about the church age book different ones have different opinions and feelings on it but really the opinion that matters most to me is brother banham's opinion of this book and so i read a couple quotes and i'll read a couple more the one that i had read last time was anointed ones at the end time in 1965. brother branham says now lee there comes your name on the book and see this is the subject that we're wanting to go into his name on the book and names taken off the book the book of life is the subject and brother branham's going to start talking about this subject he said you see you've got it fixed out and you that's not here and out in the hookups it's dr lee vale sitting here he is grammarizing this book of the seven church ages and the problem come up or the question about your name taken off the lamb's book of life see it's puzzled a lot of ministers but wait till you get the book which book this book but wait till you get the book you'll understand it if you just got any light in you see see that's brother branham's opinion of this book that is going to answer this question this question in particular is one that he said it's going to answer then in 1965 a man running from the presence of the lord he says and then the seven church ages has been finished is that right brother veil he's talking about the printing of the book and on print now and i know you'll want to get them because they answer a lot of questions that's been in your hearts all right that's what brother branham thought of this book and here's another one another brother in the church gave me after the service he emailed it to me i thought it was fantastic he said you all seen in my book it'll all be drawn out in the seven church ages so he's talking about the writing of this book you all see in this book and he said it will be all drawn out in the seven church ages which he told me which i stand by as a witness to god to be judged at the day of judgment for it it come from god not from my thinking all right that's pretty solid stance on this church age book so a lot of people may have opinions but this is the opinion that matters most to me and so i have no trouble learning from the church age book and what i told the the young people we had a youth meeting at the house friday we had a really nice time but i told him that this is what matters most to us the word of god but this came to shine light and highlight portions of the word of god that were laying there dormant to be exposed in this age to create in us a faith and understanding of faith that'll build a rapture so this is illuminating this this is the source the bible not this right and i told them a little a little analogy if you want to better absorb vitamin c then you need to eat vegetables with calcium in it like broccoli or whatever green vegetables with calcium and if you have calcium in your body you'll absorb vitamin c so what we want is vitamin c but to fully absorb vitamin c if we take a little broccoli with it amen get the calcium will fully absorb what's in the vitamin c and get the full benefit out of it amen all right now let's just go to our church age book and start with the two parts of the book of life we're going to go to page number 267 so if you've brought your book and want to turn to page 267 we'll start at the first paragraph and he says here page 267 paragraph one to begin with there is no basis for the claim that the lamb's book of life is not the same as the book of life the book of life might be called the lamb's book of life or christ's book of life or even thy book and book of liv of the living only names are written in it see in revelation 13 it says and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship the beast whose names were not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the from the foundation of the world and revelation 17 8 says the beast that thou saw was not was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is then in revelations 20 12-15 says and i saw the dead small and grace stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you can see that though there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in revelation it is called the lamb's book of life or the book of life so what is he saying he's saying that there's really just one book of life and the reason this is important is because when brother branham is ministering he he's making a distinction between two parts in the same book and i'll get to some quotes on that in a minute and we'll explain that but it's not really two books it's one record of book of life so all that will that will be in eternal life all that will be living beyond time is recorded in this book called book of life but it's it's got a diff two different parts to the book of life and he says that well first thing i wanna i wanna make note of here is he says it only has names recorded in that book all right it's just names it's not works because it says here that they were judged according to their works in revelations 20. if we go back up a little bit where it says revelations 20 12 to 15 it said i saw the dead smaller great stand before god and the books were opened so there's multiple books were open and we see this in daniel's vision of the ancient of days coming and there was books and another book right so there's there's multiple books that are open but then another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works so their works and the deeds and the things they've done were not recorded in the book of life they were in the other books the only thing in the book of life is names all right just names is in the book of life the other books are holding other things records of what was done deeds done and things like that are in the other books so we're clear on that moving forward okay brother branham says in 1965 works as faith expressed the baptists believe there are two separate books and in one way it is two separate books and another way it isn't two separate books that makes perfect sense to me what about you he said i'm body soul and spirit three separate people but it only makes me as one being so he's saying just like i'm one being but there's different parts to me the book of life also has two different parts can many people would think it's two different books but it's just two parts of the same book or like two chapters of the same book all right and so you know even in the torah the torah was one book the bible the old testament bible was one book but that book was made up of multiple scrolls that were rolled together right and that made up one book but you had a scroll for the book of isaiah and you had a scroll for the book of ezekiel and a scroll for the book of jeremiah and for the the writings of moses and all that but they were all rolled up together and made one torah or one bible which is one book and the book of life is one book but it has two sections all right there's only real one book of life like there was one germ of wheat that come up through the stalk and went through the tassel and out through the hosk and into the wheat all the way along there you say now that's wheat laying there it isn't the wheat it's the stalk but together it's the wheat see it's the wheat become because it's all one stalk but the wheat is what you're talking about the grain at the end of it the others was a carrier it must perish and that's the one one place it sounds like you can have your name taken off the book of life and the other place you can't do it so that's where it is it's all that great revelation there which was made known during the time of the seven seals why is it how some people can't believe it why is that how some people can't believe it this revelation that was under the seven seals is what answers the question of the two books and that's why i tell you that this church age book has the seven seals in it because it was edited and it was assembled after the seals were preached and brother branham could not have wrote this section about the lamb's book of life being two parts to one book until after the seals were opened all right all righty so he says in one place it sounds like you can have your name taken off the lamb's book of life that's one part and in another place it sounds like no matter what you can't have your name taken off the book of life both are true we're talking about two parts of the same book what's important is what revelation you have of which part you're on amen i don't know about you but if i found out there's a part to the book of life that no name can ever be taken off of no matter what you do past present future nothing can ever erase that name that that's the book that i'm really interested in amen that's the one i want to be part of he says in the invisible union of the bride of christ in 1965 god had to open up those seven seals not in a denomination i've always been against it but out of denomination he might take a bride not a denominational bride he couldn't do it it's against his own word he opened those seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days to the sons of god they brought that forth now before the people that they see it there you know you know to this undenominational bride oh my there is your two books one of them is the lamb's book of life your name on there is predestinated on there can't go because you can no more take that away than nothing because it was for ordained to be on there but the regular book of life see this is how brother brenham's talking about the two parts of the same book but we know that he says multiple times that there's really only one book but there's two parts right this is why this is one of the reasons why the church age book is so important because this is where he took his time not in preaching but took his time to read over the notes and to place things in the right order because sometimes when he's preaching he's bouncing from subject to subject and it's really hard to know what he's talking about because many times when brother branham is preaching he makes a designation between these two parts in the book of life and most of the time when he's talking about the record of the eternal life or that that record of the life of god coming forth where your name cannot be removed from the book when he's talking about that more often than not he's saying the lamb's book of life and then more often than not when he's talking about that portion of the book of life where your name can be removed from the book of life he calls it the book of life but not always sometimes he crosses them because when he's just preaching he's just preaching right and so you have to know the subject you have to know what he's talking about but to me the thing that settles it all is when he had his time to review what was written in the book of life and to edit it and to correct it and make it right he lays it out really plain so now when you're listening to the tapes you know what he's talking about right so this is he says there there is your two books now we know he doesn't believe there's two books he just told us he doesn't believe there's two books but when he's preaching he's talking about two books because he's talking about the two parts to the same book of life one of them is the lamb's book of life and that's the term that he uses more often than not and the other one he calls the regular book of life he said in the but in the regular book of life you can take that off at any time what does that take your name off can be taken off at any time see you don't repent it's off anyway because you're going to stand the judgment the bride don't even stand the judgment goes in the rapture so let's take another look back in our church age book at page 281. so well i think i got the wrong one i don't have it correct so i'll just have to read this to you the church age book you might find it thus if god has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride 282 okay yes 282 right in the middle i'm going right down to the middle you'll see some word and i italicized but i'm going just below that thank you brother bob thus if god has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life so here he's making it clear that it's a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names are placed in the record of the book of life but in the foreknowledge of god they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that do you accept that and i'll show you in the scripture how that's really really clear you can see in the scripture it's not clear until god opens your eyes and a an a prophet of god who knows the mind of god can dive into the mind of god and bring out things pertinent to the age and as soon as he says it you go back to the bible and it's all over the place but we would have never seen it on our own never now even here he's talking about the one book of life but he's giving it two different titles he's calling the lamb's book of life that portion where your name cannot no matter whatever at any time be removed from that portion then he's talking about the book of life where your name can be removed okay and he says hey god did that and we go back to the sovereignty of god and if god did that who are we to argue with what he did and say why did you do it that way who are we to say fair who are we to say not right who already say bad idea god right we just simply accept it and we trust the lord that he knows what he's doing because he's infinite in wisdom and he's infinite in knowledge and he's just and he's righteous and he's holy and none of that's going to change so we can't from our perspective look at a just righteous holy perfect god perfect in wisdom perfect and understanding perfect in knowledge and try to judge him better whether or not we think he's fair or right or doing things the way we would do it right we just must simply accept it right in the middle and if there are those whose names were never placed upon a record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the lord that we he should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live all right so we have these two sections which he typically calls the lamb's book of life the he also calls it the eternal record or that which came from god that which can never be removed from the book of life and then he's got this other portion that he typically calls the rest of the book of life or the regular part of the book of life he's got all kinds of names for it and your name can be removed off that and then there's a whole group of people that never ever had their name recorded on the book of life so you have names recorded in what he calls the eternal or the bride section of the book you have names recorded in the rest of the book and you have names that were never recorded in the book and if they were never recorded in the book they will never be recorded in the book they had no chance at eternal life they never will have a chance at eternal life and and that's for god to decide and we look at that and say how can he do that he happens to be god right he tells us the parable of the seed sower he said i saw in in the in the uh the seed the seed tour went out and he sowed some seeds and an enemy come along behind and he sowed some seeds and over the course of time it came up and there was tears and with the wheat right and they said what should we do should we pull out the the wheat he says no he says wait till the harvest time gather the tariffs first set them aside for the burning and then gather the wheat now what he's talking about there is serpent seed he's going right back to serpent seed that god was sowing his seed into the earth and he intended for adam and eve to bring forth a god race to bring forth a super race to bring forth christ but that satan got in through the serpent and interjected through adultery another seed line which became the tares and so because that the enemy that satan came down and worked through a vessel on earth and began a hybriding process that brought forth a mixed seed line how is god now responsible to save the tares it wasn't god who sowed the tares god did not sow the tares god is not responsible for the tares that's why god has the right to record names on a book and put some in a portion that will never be erased some in a portion knowing that there will be some that fall away from this book and be erased and some that never made it to the book right because god is not responsible for what satan has done and he's not responsible to accept what is not his amen that's why the revelation of serpent seed makes everything else makes sense amen that was the hardest revelation for me to get i mean it took me some time i labored and labored and labored but just as soon as god dropped that in my heart and i knew it it made the whole bible make perfect sense amen brother branham says in the invisible union of the bride of christ here it brings into view the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of the seven church ages here again he's pointing us back to the book of the seven church ages this book that was written and he's talking about this book right here he said here it brings in the view the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of the seven church ages so brother branham saying it's going to be a mystery to you it's a mysterious thing these two books are these two parts of the same book and but you're going to read it where in the book of the seven church ages the two books book of life said one says you can put your name on you never come off the other one says that you take his name out of the book of life all right let's go to john chapter 5 in our bibles saint john chapter 5. actually before we go to saint john chapter five i'm sorry if we can go to first thessalonians first first thessalonians chapter four first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope now we're talking about two parts to the book of life but i said we're going to talk about two parts and two resurrections we're going to talk about two resurrections today and this is really the dividing line there we know that there's two resurrections in the scriptures right there's more there's a lot of resurrection in the scriptures but for the gentiles there's two resurrections there's the resurrection that we're talking about here in 1st thessalonians when christ comes and gathers the elect to himself and the bride meets him in the air so we know we have that and we know that after that the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years and we'll get into that then after that there's what's called a general resurrection when all the dead come and stand before christ and the bride at the white throne judgment all right and so what separates those two resurrections how come some go now and some go later because we find at the white throne judgment there are theirs that those at the white throne judgment that are called righteous and that are given entrance into eternal life so if there's those that stand before the the white throne judgment of christ and they're standing there and he declares them righteous he separates them from the rest and he gives them entrance into eternal life they're allowed to come into eternal life then what's different between those and that group that's raptured the first time and doesn't go to white throne judgment that's the difference of the two two parts of the book that's what separates those two parts the one which is the the bride's book or the record of the eternal or what he calls most often lamb's book of life that is the one that takes the first resurrection the rest of the book will be judged when they come up in the general resurrection but that general resurrection isn't only for those that are declared righteous in that judgment the general resurrection is for all the dead the righteous and the unrighteous that's why we know that there's two separate it's easy to see two separate resurrections because the the dead in christ shall rise that's not those who are going to the lake of fire right the dead in christ shall rise then at the end of the thousand years though all the dead shall rise all right let's look at this in first thessalonians but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep this is a funny word and this is what we're going to pay attention to right now he says sleep it's just like jesus when when he was talking about lazarus after lazarus passed away he told the disciples lazarus our friend is asleep i said oh great you know he's resting he's going to get better and he he finally out of frustration jesus had said no he's dead okay you're not catching what i'm talking about but jesus is making you know jesus wasn't wasting words he's not out here just saying funny little things jesus wasn't a man who just spilt words all over the place he said what he meant he meant what he said he said lazarus our friend is asleep because he knew that there was something in lazarus that could be resurrected that could be called back lazarus wasn't part of the dead now it's funny that lazarus had died in his natural life lazarus was dead but yet jesus says he's asleep because you're going to go call him from the dead but yet there come a man one time to him he wanted to be a disciple and follow him and and jesus says come follow me and he says let me go first and dare bury the dead in my family like he had a relative who had died and jesus says let the dead bury the dead what how are dead people going to dig a grave to bury dead people unless he's talking about you which are dead yet where you while you live there are those who are dead yet while you live and he said let the dead bury the dead what is he talking about those who do not have representation in the book of life are already dead and jesus knew who they were let the dead bury the dead come and follow me lazarus has died no he's asleep see jesus is being very specific these are the little love secrets that's laying in the bible you know paul came in the new testament paul and peter and them there they have the old testament you know you have the writings of moses you have the law and you you have the prophets and you have all this and what was veiled in there it was veiled the mystery of how god was going to bring salvation through christ and bring it to the gentiles and it was laying in a mysterious form it was all written out it was all prophesied but it was laying in a mystery and as it happened they never recognized it but after that happened the apostles who had actually caught the mind of christ would look back and say this prophecy means this and this prophecy means this so the new testament is revealing the mystery that was laying in the old testament but while they were revealing the mystery of the old testament they were laying in the new testament a mystery for the end time right so there was an exodus and they were having a nexus they were having a passover lamb and they were putting blood on a door and they were having bitter waters uh uh uh out there they have a striking a rock to get water and they were having this problem with balaam and they were having all this that was really what was happening at the time it was a record of what was taking place but it was also a foreshadow of what to come so that in the bible could be laying a mystery so that the other end when the disciples got to this fulfillment of the mystery they could look back and say see it's been laying there all the time and the same exact thing has happened in our day the apostles were writing about what was really happening the great falling away paul going into prison the persecutions and the all the things that were happening at the time he was talking about that and at the time he was revealing what had happened before he was laying down what was happening now and he was hiding in there a mystery so that a prophet of god could come at the end time and go back and say see this is that and this is that and this is that so everything happens exactly the same way over and over and over again god is the same he says i changed not and that's what this prophetic ministry is it's the same thing that we saw happening in the new testament pointing back to the old it's the same thing happening now looking back at the new testament and looking back at the old testament and pulling out of there the mysteries that were laying there the love secrets for the bride right amen so this is one of those love secrets he sleeps rather concerning them which are asleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus what do they do in jesus sleep in jesus he's not talking about lazy people right those also that sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep they are not dead they are asleep why is it that they are not dead because if you possess within your vessel the seed gene of eternal life you can not die that's the portion of the book called the lamb's book of life that's the portion of the book called the record of the bride that's that portion and that portion doesn't die that portion sleeps hallelujah 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first see he calls him dead but he calls him a specific kind of dead dead in christ if you're dead in christ you're only asleep hallelujah then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord that's very important that we know that we'll ever be with the lord who is the only group that will ever be with the lord his bride we'll never leave aside never leave his presence but will serve him and minister to him throughout eternity the bride are the ones who dwell in the city when new jerusalem comes down everyone else dwells outside of the city everyone at the white throne judgment who's given entrance into the kingdom entrance into everlasting life they are outside the city bringing their glory and honor into the city but the only ones who dwell in the city are the bride of jesus christ the lamb and the 144 thousand okay so there's distinctions there's distinctions then 18 says wherefore comfort one another with these words i don't know about you but i'm comforted right now amen let's go now let's go to john 5. saint john chapter 5. excuse me saint john chapter 5. and we'll read verse 24. verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath important word very important word you might want to underline that those that were able to to hear jesus's word now when jesus was speaking was he speaking audibly he was speaking the crowds of thousands of people at a time did they hear his word right he's not talking about natural hearing because many heard and rejected but he's talking about somebody who heard and knew what he was talking about heard and believed heard and perceived heard and received the word that's the hearing that he's talking about he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is past from death unto life this is why he says you're asleep because if you hear his word believing on him that sent him then you have hath you already have it now you're going to get it not at some future date will you receive it see that's the difference between those who come in the first resurrection and the second resurrection the first resurrection are those that sleep that are dead in christ and all that are dead in christ when he returns will rise if you're not dead in christ if you're not asleep you stay in the ground until the thousand years are up and then come for the general resurrection because you hath not life how do we know that keep your place in saint john and let's go back to revelations 20. revelations 20 verse 11. don't lose john because we're going back and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them verse 12 and i saw the dead the sleeping the dead in christ who did he see the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead not the sleeping not the dead in christ not the sleeping saints but the dead but the dead were judged out of those books which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the sleeping the dead in christ the sleeping saints no the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works see if you have life everlasting if you have life everlasting you will come up in the first resurrection because he says you shall not come into condemnation now that word condemnation in the greek is crisis increases is used 48 times in the new testament and out of 48 times that it's used 41 times its interpreted judgment you shall not come into the judgment why because you have life already there's nothing to judge you have been washed by the blood of the lamb you have eternal life dwelling inside all your sins have been remitted by that by calvary there is nothing left to judge on you you cannot be judged because god cannot judge through blood if there's blood there's no judgment right and so those that have received that have received his word and believed on him that sent him half life half everlasting life all right and shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life that's why he says they're asleep amen if you're not asleep you're dead all right back to john john 5. he says and let's read 24 again just to stay in context verily verily i say unto you that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death and to life first resurrection 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that here shall live what he's talking about is not the second resurrection in this verse he's talking about those that become born again he's talking about becoming born again then we go down and skip down to verse 28 marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice now stop right there when christ comes the first time and there's a there's a rapture of the saints right and the dead in christ shall rise the dead in christ shall rise those that are asleep shall rise and meet him in the air at that time do all that are in the graves hear his voice no this is this is talking about the second resurrection when he's this verse 28 he's no longer talking about the first resurrection he's talking about the second resurrection when all the dead come up out of the graves marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation that's the second resurrection because in the second resurrection of white throne judgment you have those on the right hand and those in the left hand and those that are given entrance into the eternal life and those that are cast into the lake of fire verse 28 and verse 29 is speaking of the second resurrection are we clear on that see how once once god exposes it through the mouthpiece of a prophet you can go to the word you see it over and over and over and over and over again amen all right let's go to john 6. just turn over to the next chapter john 6 43. john chapter 6 verse 43 reads jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day and i want to ask you what raise up in the last days he talking about okay he this is not talking about the general resurrection where those that are declared righteous go into eternal life and those that are unrighteous go into eternal damnation what he's saying here is i will raise him up he is speaking of the first resurrection for those that are in christ those that have everlasting life those that have passed from death unto life right those that shall not come into the judgment that's what he's speaking of when he says i shall raise him up at the last day right because we know everybody's going to be raised up in the last day right you can be the most vile wicked person that's ever walked the face of the earth hate god spit in his face curse and blaspheme every day of your life and guess what you're going to get resurrected is that true every one that ever lived on the earth whether you had your name in the book of life or you never had your name in the book of life or you had your name in the book of life and it was removed it doesn't matter everyone before the white throne judgment at the end of the millennium everyone will be resurrected so when jesus is saying i will raise him up he is not talking about general resurrection he can only be talking about the resurrection of the dead in christ this is so important because how do i become in christ because it says everyone all the dead in christ so you have to be in christ and so if i'm not in christ i'm not taking part of that first resurrection when we know first corinthians tells us by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and you have to get into christ in this life through the new birth through the baptism of the holy ghost you have to get into christ that way when you go to the grave and are sleeping you're considered dead in christ because you were in christ and if you were ever in christ with your dead in christ living in christ any time you're in christ it means because you were in christ before the foundation of the world means your name was recorded in the section of book of life that's called the bride's book or the eternal portion that part that can never ever never be removed and all of them will come into christ by the new birth that's who he's talking about here verse 45 it is written in the prophet prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life they receive the new birth they're born again they're in christ if they die they sleep or they're dead in christ those are the ones that already have everlasting life that when christ comes back to gather his bride they will resurrect we which are alive and remain our bodies will be changed we will go to meet him in the air and forever be with our lord that's that section of the book of life that section that can never be removed amen they want to read one more passage in john 6. let's go to verse 53 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live for ever that's those who are in christ that's those if they should pass away before he returns that will sleep not die how do you drink his blood and eat his flesh see that he said it's requirement right that's why many left him because they thought how what's he saying how can we eat his flesh and drink his blood amen and we know that his blood was spilt was the new testament was the new covenant for us and he said he is the bread of life that comes down from heaven he is the manna he is that portion that sustains us he is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god amen we know that there was a body made and that word was but that that word became a body and that body bled and died for us amen and now brother branham said you're feasting on the body word of the son of man you're feasting on christ the word not that we're cutting up the body that was on the cross and we're eating it but that body that was on the cross represented the full word of god and the full word of god was crucified for us why because we're part of the word of god because that record of eternal life is part of the word of god and it had to be paid for it had to be redeemed because of what happened in the garden of eden threw it into chaos and so now something has to come and redeem it back but what redeemed it back it has to be the same kind has to be the word in the form of flesh crucified amen so we're not eating flesh we are eating the word but you must eat the word not spit it out not refuse it and not say that doesn't suit my taste because if we're rejecting the word we're rejecting christ if we have a portion that doesn't suit our tastes and we're spitting it out we're spitting out christ and you do not have eternal life you do not already have eternal life if you're taking the word and spitting it out if you're looking at it and says i don't think i like that those who are on that record of eternal life do not have a picky appetite they come to the smorgasbord of god's word and they say give it all i want i want one of everything give me one of each i may not understand it it may go against my flesh it may cost me a whole lot to fulfill this word and let it live in my life it may cost me my relationships it may cost me my job it may cost me my status my prestige whatever it costs me but so be it because i want to eat every part of christ amen that's why you can see those who are rejecting this word and those are rejecting parts of it and spitting it out they do not have life already they will not be part of the first resurrection because the only way to be part of the first resurrection is the half-life to be passed from death and to life to be in christ you can't get in christ if you're rejecting christ it's impossible now i want to i want to read a passage this is a long passage but let's read together the church age book on page 282 and i think that's right yeah 282 and i'm going to start at the last paragraph of 282 and we're going to read a couple pages together so hang with me follow along in your book this is really really good this is one of my favorite sections right here page 282 last paragraph to understand this subject even more clearly it will now be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages up until now we have been thinking in terms of the removal of the names of individuals now we want to consider not the individuals but the groups represented in the church to do so we will liken the church through the ages to the wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will produce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in that will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form so that's the whole purpose we live in farm country we're surrounded by wheat in the summer the purpose of putting the wheat in the ground is so you get a whole bunch more wheat and there's a process to that you don't put wheat in the ground and come back in a couple months and there's a bunch of wheat laying on the ground there's a whole process by which the wheat matures and becomes wheat again and that's what he's talking about all this process processes that goes back to reproducing the life jesus the great royal seed died that matches one who is the life of the church stands in the midst of the church for all seven church ages giving his life to the church the carrier or bearer to the end that his very life will reproduce in bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself and they will be even as he is for says john we shall be like him that is what john the baptist was referring to when he said that jesus would gather the wheat into the garner that was the resurrection where the redeemed who had been elected unto eternal life came in so jesus when he's talking about gathering the wheat into the garner we realize that when the seed goes in it comes up and there's an entire plant and brother brenham here calls it the carrier or bearer of life because we know that seed life is coming up through the stalk coming up through the uh the tassel coming up through all this but the only thing that we're interested in is seed again right that's the part we want we won't see it again so god what brother branham here is saying is that when he gathers the the wheat into the garner he is not gathering the entire plant into the garner he is coming back to gather the wheat into the gardener the rest of it doesn't get gathered into the garner now there's a purpose for that and we'll read that here but he says this is the whole church but he's only coming for the wheat second paragraph now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life so he's telling us and this really makes it easy for me he's telling us that the book of life both sections the book of life is really the record of the wheat plant coming forth the wheat plant that's supposed to produce wheat again it is not the record of everything that's going in the first resurrection and everything that's going to be gathered and garnered gathered into the garner that's the first resurrection and that's wheat seed only but this book of life is the record of the whole plant from blade to tassel to stalk to tassel the whole plant right and you can't have wheat without a plant second paragraph now read the first sentence again now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life i repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of the eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a bear seed is sown soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat yet then it grows into a stalk this is not yet wheat life is there but not the wheat then at the end of the stalk is a little spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no wheat yet then the plant is pollenized and we see the chaff grow this looks mighty like the wheat but it is not yet seed then forms the wheat and the husks it is now back to what it was originally now the ripened wheat is harvested next paragraph jesus christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself into glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of life of christ as the blade stalked tassel and husk were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church corporate through the ages has been the carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say that the book of life is the whole wheat plant keep reading let's go and let's go over that again here is that original seed that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produced a stalk not it either here comes husk in which the wheat is to form that isn't it the tassels appear then pollen falls on those pistols part of that plant is quickened something of that original seed that came up through the rest of that plant turns into seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type of that in israel leaving egypt they came out about 2 million strong all escaped through the sacrificial blood all were baptized in the red sea all came up out of the water enjoying holy spirit manifestations and blessings all late angel food all drank of the rock that followed them yet except for a very few they were not but carriers for the children who should follow them and go into canaanland all israel is not israel and all but a tiny minority had their names blotted out of the book of life see they came out they came out but the purpose of coming out was to go in so if you came out but don't go in you failed the purpose of god so the purpose was to come out and to go in but he said they're just carriers carrying the life all but just a tiny portion of what came out which we know was caleb and joshua all but a tiny portion they were just carrying the life for that next generation who would go in because they didn't go in they rejected the plan of god they rejected the prophet of god they turned to idols they turned to this they turned to that and they were killed they were dead jesus said dead he didn't say they sleep he said they're dead brother branham said eternally separated from god names removed from the book of life they were just there to support to bring what was really israel into the land third chapter or third yeah no paragraph we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the book of life this is the record god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life period if you're in christ you have life your name can never be removed that's why the baptism of holy ghost is called a seal that will seal us to the day of redemption because you cannot come to that seal unless you're part of that life and if you're part of that life then you come through near birth into that seal that's why you can be sealed because there's names that can be removed from the book of life but not the names that can be sealed or not the names that can be removed it's a different part of the book of life altogether amen so he that hath the son this is the record god hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have the life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit they are the original that's why he could seal the book before that's why god could put names in the book and he could he could have the lamb slain in his mind before or seal the names in the book before you made a choice because he knew where that life was he knew what the life was he knew where the life was and he knew where the life was going to come up at god's not guessing nothing god does is a guess you think he didn't know who was and who wasn't when they came out of egypt when they came out of egypt to mixed multitude do you think that he was worried that none would go in do you think he was worried about joshua and caleb or do you think he he really wanted a bunch of that first generation to come in but they just didn't see it they just didn't make it god knew he knew who would come out he knew he would fall away in the wilderness journey and he knew he'd go in because known unto god are all his works from before if we don't have god seated firmly on the throne and we don't have him as creator creator and sovereign over all things this gets really complicated but if we set god on the throne have him omniscient knowing all things from before the foundation of the world and giving him the right to choose then this is really really easy it just depends on what your perspective of god is last paragraph now we see why the redeemed bought back by original owner bride that's really important let's read that slowly now we can see why the redeemed who are redeemed the bought back by original owner who bought it back the original owner who did he buy back the bride who is the bride the redeemed that the original owner bought back hallelujah now we can see why the redeemed bought back by original owner bride she was in him as eve was in adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the record why because you were in him is christ going to lose part of himself you were in him before the foundation of the world that's why he could take that record of that which was in him which was going to be sewn into the earth which was going to come forth at different stages and times in different eras and in different places that's why he could record that that's why he could in his mind have the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to redeem that back because he had to redeem it back because it's his he's not going to lose it hallelujah she is part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the bride is a member of him and he loses none but that is not so concerning the all in the book of life for amongst them are even those like judas etc who have pardoned the record but their names were removed we can see those who come in the last days and after having done wonderful works jesus will say that he never knew them it is not that he was not aware of them his omniscience precludes that but they were not foreknown as in the bride and neither were they foreknown as amongst the righteous of the second resurrection they bore no fruit because they were outside the word did not abide in it and they therefore were sentenced to death then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aide and a comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into it into life everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their names on the book of life and these are cast into the lake of fire also this is the last paragraph we're going to read thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the harvest is the record of the church and even as not all the wheat plant is wheat seed and not all the plant is used in the harvest so with the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but a part of is it is gathered into the garner and a part of it is kept that it might enter into light eternal life and in the second resurrection and part of it which is a counted chaff is burned in the lake of fire and this is exactly what john the baptist and jesus said for john said that the wheat would be garnered and the chaff burned and jesus said bind the tares and then gather the wheat the ecumenical move will bind the tear churches together for the tares must be bound first and though their end is burning they are not burned at their binding but are reserved to a later date which is at the end of the thousand years or the second resurrection but once the tares are bound the rapture can take place and does so at some time between the binding and the revelation of antichrist then will come the day when all stand together as seen in daniel the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multitudes hard to be judged yes all are there all the books are opened a final disposition of all is made the harvest is indeed over the books once opened are closed see this analogy just makes it so much easier for me the book of life is the record of the entire plant but not the entire plant has eternal life or wheat seed right it's there to support the coming forth of the wheat seed the easiest way for me to explain this is take a look at what we have right now in israel and the situation we have right now in israel over in israel we've got a little over six million i believe it is six to eight million people i think six million of them are jews right now so if the bride would rapture right now today there would be six million jews in palestine and then when we rapture there would be two witnesses with the spirit of elijah and moses that would go and start preaching to those jews how many of them were elected seed 144 000 out of how many about 6 million and they're gathering in that maybe by the time that happens it may be 8 million 10 million who knows how many million so there's only 144 000 of the elect only 144 000 will receive the message of those two prophets only 144 000 will live in the millennium with christ and the bride is that true so what about why what's the big deal why is god doing it like this why did god bring 2 million out of egypt only to have a handful go in with a second generation you know there was prophecies laid in this scripture about the return of the diaspora the returning of the nations and and israel coming into its place and its nation and and its people and all that and we're watching that fulfilled before our eyes we've taught on that and you've seen it 144 000 people can't do that 144 000 people can't build a country can't form an economy can't have a government can't have a military can't have all the things that you need to have an entire nation to fulfill the word you need a lot more than 144 000 but god knew that he was going to call 144 000 but in order to get the 144 000 in the right place at the right time for the right message he had to have this support system that was going to build an economy that was going to build a government that was going to have a military that was going to offer protection that was going to have religious orders of the day and that was going to have spiritual teaching that was going to have all these things so that at the right time he could come down and call out his 144 000. the rest of them are not elect and if that hurts our feelings we just have to look at god sitting on a throne and say god are you just and are you right and is your word true so what about the rest they are the support system and we know that only the elect will be gathered into the garner but what about the rest of the record what's going to happen to them well if you want to know what's going to happen to them you have to go to white throne judgment and you have to go to matthew 25 the separating as the sheep and the goats and then you'll know what's going to happen to them and we're going to get into the judgment the great white throne judgment next week maybe wednesday or next week i don't know but the point is they're not all lost when you get to the white throne judgment some of them those whose names remain on the book those whose names are on the book of life go in to eternal life those whose names are not on the book they go to the lake of fire so it's not the end of the story so we live here in farm country we have wheat growing up right when we gather the wheat is the rest of the wheat plant thrown away no has anybody ever heard of straw this is what brother ben was talking about there's a portion of that wheat plant is the chaff and it's just blown to the wind it's just gone there's no hope for it it's burnt or it's it's got blown to the wind but the stalk that stalk is saved it has value still and it had a purpose what was the purpose of the stalk that grain would never dry if there was no stalk right it was important to the process and because it's important to the process god will give it a reward it will receive entrance into eternal life and be allowed to dwell in the new heavens and the new earth just like when the farmer goes out and he gathers his harvest he plants the seed and the purpose of planting the seed is to get seed right he's not planting wheat to get straw because straw doesn't bring the income that wheat does he would go bankrupt he plants wheat to get wheat but in the process of planting wheat he had this whole support system this whole plant that he needed that needed the whole plant to hold the hold it up to take care of photosynthesis to protect it from the wind all these things had to happen so that the sea could reproduce and some of that is the chaff blown in the wind or burned up with unquenchable fire but some of it is reserved and give an entrance into into the into the kingdom prepared for them from before the foundation of the world give an entrance into eternal life so it's not all lost everything that has its name on the book every name that's on the book will be in the new heavens and the new earth the one section is the section of eternal life or the record of the the seed the wheat coming forth the other record is the record of the support system that it takes to bring this seed forth and the support system as long as they don't do anything to get their name removed off the book they'll go in you want to talk about mercy that's mercy not part of christ from before the foundation of the world not in him not dead in christ not first resurrection not part of god from before the foundation of the world but yet because they served the purpose with which god purposed them for and because they did it faithfully and never rejected the bride never rejected the word and the coming forth of the word god in his infinite mercy gives them entrance into eternal life i love a god like that he'll go far beyond gathering his own harvest far beyond just going either his own children but anybody who is a support and a help and an aid to the coming forth of that life he will reward amen and i'm grateful for that let's look at this in church book page 272. we're just about finished here we're almost done 272 the very last paragraph in 272 now i'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in the book of life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true god and worship of him though they did not worship according to truth or word like judas they didn't go all the way see how judas was chosen of god he was instructed in truth he shared of the mysteries he had a ministry of power granted unto him he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus name but when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to pentecost to receive the spirit of god he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way amen that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost that's why if you believe that you have the baptism of holy ghost but you can see the word and brother brennan will bring a revelation of the word and it'll bring it out and it just doesn't suit your taste or you just don't like it or you have a different opinion or you don't you don't want to go that way that's not clear evidence that you received the baptism of holy ghost it's time to get down on your knees and say lord do i really have it because i'm having a hard time fulfilling your word i'm having a hard time believing your word amen that's why god came and restored his word full word full life when the word was restored in fullness now the life of christ could come back in fullness on the believer amen that's why once the full word is revealed you know when you have partial word you can accept partial word and receive the baptism holy ghost they did it luther's day they did it in wesley's day they did it in every day if there's only partial word available partial believing the partial word will will give you a a seal a seal until your day of redemption of the baptism holy ghost but once the full word has been revealed partial word won't work anymore because now full word gives us access to full life and because full life is available it requires accepting full word to access full life the partial word won't work anymore that's why when god came down and christ came down and opened the seven seals now it's a full manifestation of the revelations that's been sealed in the book that's been hid in the new testament and now that's been clearly unveiled before our eyes and now a partial or a pentecost or a wesleyan or a lutheran accepting of truth is not going to work anymore that's why he says have no doubt about it those that are really the wheat seed those that are the german predestinated germ of eternal life they will receive all the word they will be in in the word all the way partial there's no more time for partial brother branham said in the most message token he said in luther's day you had the lamb and in wesley's day you had the lamb but today we have the life you have to receive the life full word full life amen all right let's read one one more section out of here and this will set us up for next time 276. we're going to start second paragraph which is middle of the page the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the judgment so when you go to matthew 25 and you go to revelations 20 at the white throne judgment you see some were considered righteous and some are considered unrighteous and so now he's going to answer the question why are these righteous ones in judgment because we know the bride's not in judgment right the bride's present but the bride's not being judged and we'll get into that next week the question now arises why are these righteous ones in the judgment there is no other place that they can come up for there are but two resurrections that's pretty easy if you didn't make the first resurrection and only those that are in christ that were in him from before the foundation of the world that were sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost they're the only ones going in the first resurrection everyone else must wait for the second resurrection but there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the judgment john 5 24 says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation shall not come into the judgment is what it really says but is passed permanently from death unto life but notice carefully jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not having previously received it as a member of the bride john 5 28 29 marvel not at this for the hours coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now we all know that john 5 28 29 is not the rapture for only the dead in christ will arise from the graves at the time along with the living bride who is still on the earth first thessalonians 4 16 says for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord but it says in john 5 28 29 that all are going to come forth from the grave this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in revelations 20 11-15 wherein the dead were brought before the lord and judged according to the works and all whose names were not in the book of life were then cast into the lake of fire see where he puts the dead in all capitals here because they don't already have eternal life they are going to a portion of them are going to receive eternal life or receive entrance into eternal life but they don't already have it because they don't already have it they are called dead that's why when a saint goes to sleep they're not dead amen you know what if the lord should tarry and i shouldn't make it all the way to the rapture and they have to bury me out here somewhere don't ever put on my tombstone that i died see right here the body of chad lamb is asleep because i can't die i cannot die jesus is looking at his disciples and say you know if you believe on me you should never die every one of them died right every one of them in the natural life died and jesus was telling him you can't die he said neither shall anything harm ye do you know how some of them died neither shall anything harm thee he's not talking about the natural life the natural life has nothing to do with it he's talking about the spiritual life nothing can harm thee you can never be separated from god you can never die oh hallelujah which part of the book are you in where do you see yourself in that you know i i'm so grateful that i believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that i'm in the portion of the eternal life record and my name no matter what filthy vile nasty thing i would do tomorrow my name can't be taken out of that book why because i was part of him before the foundation of the world why what token what evidence because i want to eat every part of christ i want to there's a desire in me not from my flesh not from my mind but a desire in me that i want every part of christ i want to take it in i want to enjoy it i want to eat it hallelujah why because it's who i am i came out from him now when you show him to me i'm going to go into him that's what the message of the hour is it's christ an expose it's christ it's jesus christ exposed to your very eyes and if you came out from christ and you were part of christ when you see christ exposed you want christ that's why the message of the hour is not a challenge it's not hard it's not i can barely believe it all i wish i could not if you were in him from before the foundation of the world you might struggle at first because it's different than your thinking your mind but in the inside oh my i came out from him there he is i'm going into him amen that's consolation to me god has been good to us amen i told you i'd get you out early i will let's stand we want to make sure we beat the bad weather musicians if you could come as they're coming i'll just share a little story the other day i was listening to a message i think it was invisible union of the bride in christ i'm not quite sure on that i may have that a little bit wrong but he was talking about the story of the chicken or the the chicken that hatched out the eagle in the nest and the eagle that was born in the chicken with the chickens and he's out there and he's an odd chicken and nothing's going right and he can't eat like the rest of he doesn't like what they like but he doesn't know what else to do he just thinks he's a chicken he just thinks he's a bad chicken and he's typing it with a denominational believer and when when one of these seed of god elect seed of gods you know they're in these churches and they're trying to do what they think is right and being zealous and all that but he says one day another eagle flew over and screamed and something inside of him quivered that sounded right he heard cluck cluck and cock-a-doodle-doo and that wasn't it but when he heard that scream from the eagle something said that's it he didn't have to be taught he didn't have to have verses explained to him when it screamed he identified with the scream right and the the the eagle didn't have to water down the scream to attract the eagle and the eagle didn't have to kind of halfway sound like a chicken and halfway sound like an eagle so i wouldn't scare away the eagle the eagle screamed and the eagle liked it and the same thing's true today if we want to attract eagles we've got to scream like an eagle we've got to say what the eagle said what the eagle ministry is not something halfway in between amen eagles are attracted by an eagle scream and so i've always listened to this story and i've always enjoyed it because i've always put myself in the perspective of the eagle in the chicken yard you've been there too right but this time when i listened to it it struck me different i caught the perspective of the mother eagle and brother branham said that mother eagle knew she laid two eggs she wasn't hoping she wasn't wondering if there was another eagle out there somewhere she wasn't wishing that i just had more seed if i had more family she knew by foreknowledge she knew that there was two eggs and god knows exactly how many seed there are that little eagle never went looking for his identification he was in the barnyard as far as he knew he'd have been in barnyard the rest of his life but brother branham said that mother eagle went hunting for that other baby because she knew it was on the earth hallelujah it wasn't us who were seeking out god it's not us one day decided i don't fit in here i'm going to go and i'm going to find an eagle scream somewhere and i'm going to climb on high we had no idea what we were we had no idea what god's plan was for us we had no idea why none of this fit us until god came hunting for us because he knew that he had more eggs he knew that there was more seed and because he knew there was he went hunting for us and then we heard the eagle scream and something inside said oh my what do i do and the mother eagle said just jump and flap your wings i'll take over from there hallelujah we look at this and we say but you know there's only so many in this book and there's so many in this book and what about what about so and so and every time you start talking about god's right to choose and predestination and the election and the eternal seed of god and those that are in the book that can be removed and and those what about the person in the jungle and the thing and the thing and the thing and what about so-and-so is raised here never heard this and only heard that or had a bad experience what about what about what about is god god or is god a man and if that mother eagle knew that she laid two eggs and she was so inspired by the knowledge she had two eggs that it would send her out hunting for that other egg what about god who knows where his children are he knows how many he's going to have he knows when they're going to come forth and he knows we're going to go to land and it's god's responsibility to find his seed it's not the seed's responsibility to find god see if we could just let god be god if we could just let him be perfect wise infinite righteous holy just if we could just let him be all of those things and quit using our brain about all the possible scenarios of who heard what and then this this and the wrong this and a jungle pygmy in the jungle in africa god's got it all in control he knows exactly what he's doing we just have to let god be god and how many are you thankful that god is god and he knew where you were hiding out under a bush somewhere it wasn't adam went looking for god it was god came looking for adam when he was hiding out in the trees in the bushes trying to cover himself and hide himself we were hiding out in our bush somewhere in a little shack or shiny somewhere or up in a mountain or over in a hall or down in the woods or wherever we were he came hunting for his seed hallelujah and we heard the eagle scream hallelujah i just pray that god will use me to hunt the rest of his seed that i can be an instrument in his hand for spreading this message and screaming out the last day message screaming out pure and true and unadulterated and uncompromising and unwavering just say it say what the prophet said because if there's eagles out there that's what they'll be attracted to not scream cluck scream cluck no just the scream of the eagle is all that they want to hear amen let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your word your word has been so good and so true and we just asked lord that you would just reveal it to us in a greater way let us really see our portion lord and what we're here for what you've called us to god let us be positionally placed in this body god we just ask for your blessings as we travel lord help us to get safely home lord and we just thank you for allowing us to come to church well thank you that we had the opportunity to be here this morning we just asked that you would bless us along the way and help us lord to carry this message with us wherever we go screaming out the truth so that other eagles can come and find you lord we ask for your blessing in jesus christ's name amen let's sing i had a song i want to sing this thing i'll fly away 262. some glad morning when this life is over i don't know about you i'm not a chicken i can fly and one of these days i'm going to find out what these wings of faith are really all about it's not about feeling better on this earth it's not about claiming my healing or it's not about these situations what these wings of faith really are for is for a rapture and one of these days i'm going to set these wings and figure out what these big old wings are actually for and i'm going to fly away let's start that some glad morning when this life is [Music] [Music] god [Music] before i die hallelujah [Music] [Music] of this life has grown out [Music] [Music] away to a land where joy shall never end oh i'll fly away i'll i amen let's put a correction on that song brother jim can you bring up the chorus again it says before i die we have no guarantee of that we have no guarantee that some of us won't be here then we might be in the grave the day the resurrection takes place we don't know but one thing we know for sure is i can't die i might sleep but i can't die brother jim if you can change that fast we'll change it we'll sing it right according to the revelation of the hour no matter what happens in this life persecution troubles my own failures my own faults disgrace honor joy wealth poverty it doesn't matter i can't die why because i hath already eternal life when did i get it eternal life doesn't start i got it before the foundation of the world when i was in him and because my existence comes from before space and time i had a life i have a life within me that goes all the way out back before space and before time that's eternal life and though time and space fall away guess what i still have that same life and that's why it has nothing to do with merit conduct nothing to do with intelligence thank god all it has to do with is where was i before the foundation of the world that's what matters most and if i had representation in christ then then i can't die you see why god had to come to paul the apostle on the road to emmaus because paul was doing things he was being rotten really when he was saul he was a bad guy is i'm gonna tell him the truth he was rotten he was persecuting the christians he was hauling him in the jail he was doing all these things and you know for that for doing that god would have to remove his name from the book because he was fighting against the bride he was fighting against the truth only there was a problem with saul he wasn't part of the book where your name could be removed his name was written on the part of the book where your name couldn't be removed and so although he deserved to have his name blotted out he happened to wind up in the portion of the of the book of life where god could not wipe his name out that's why there was a lot of people rejecting the christians in that day there was a lot of people doing what saw what paul was doing hauling them into jail persecuting them running them from city city studying them but god didn't care about them he just blotted their name off the book but god had an obligation to the one who his name was on the book of life who could not be blotted out so god came down and personally revealed himself to paul [Music] because paul can't die paul couldn't go to the lake of fire paul couldn't have his name removed from the book so god came down you know the first time i heard this message i didn't love it so much and i didn't say all nice things about it [Music] and if i would resist the truth if i would resist god if i would resist christ being made manifest god would write strike my name from all the book of life but but my name's not on that part of the book of life my name's on the part of the book of life that he can't erase and so god was obligated to come down and reveal himself to me personally amen how many are thankful for the predestination of god for the election of god let's sing this the right way and you can be dismissed as we sing this let's start fly away o glory [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] glory [Music] oh there's just a [Music] shall never end i'll [Music] [Music] i [Applause] [Music] i [Music] oh i want to see him look upon his face dare to sing forever of my saving grace on the streets of glory let me lift my voice heirs all past home at last ever to rejoice now as i journey through the land singing as i go pointing souls to calvary to the crimson flow many arrows pierce my soul from without within but my lord leads me on through him i must win oh i want to see him look upon his face dare to sing forever of your saving grace on the streets of glory let me lift my voice heirs all past a home that lasts ever to rejoice when in service for my lord dark may be the night but i think more close to him he will give me life for satan snares may vex my soul turn my thoughts aside but my lord goes ahead and leads her every time for i want to see him look upon his face dare to sing forever of his saving grace go on the streets of glory let me lift my voice cares all past home may last ever to rejoice
