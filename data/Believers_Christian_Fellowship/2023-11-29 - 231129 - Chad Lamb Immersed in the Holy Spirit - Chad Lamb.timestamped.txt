[11:22] you might use us as instruments in your
[11:24] hands Lord to accomplish your great
[11:27] purpose God tonight we pray that you
[11:29] would take us Lord and you would take us
[11:31] to a higher level you would open our
[11:33] eyes to see you Lord and see your word

[11:48] vessel under your control and speak your
[11:50] Eternal words and may that word Lord
[11:53] positionally Place each attribute Lord
[11:56] and give us what we need for the journey
[11:58] that we were on Lord that that you
[12:00] predestinated us for for The Works were
[12:02] finished from before the foundation of
[12:04] the world may we just get in line with
[12:07] your plan and with your program Lord so
[12:09] that we're not doing anything to hinder
[12:11] Lord but may we do everything we can to
[12:14] youi father I pray that you would Lord
[12:17] bless us as we look into your word open
[12:19] our hearts Lord and come and speak to us
[12:22] break the bread of life as only you can
[12:25] Lord you're the only one who can give
[12:27] Revelation we're asking that you would
[12:28] do it now do it for each of us Lord we
[12:32] ask you would have your way in Jesus
[12:33] Christ's name we pray
[12:37] amen amen God bless you I just wanted to
[12:39] give you a quick update on Brother Rich
[12:41] Ley I just found out just before service
[12:44] that he came through the surgery well
[12:45] the surgeon said everything went well
[12:47] and he was being at the time I talked to
[12:49] his family he was being moved to ICU for
[12:51] recovery so let's just pray that the
[12:53] Lord will bring him through the recovery
[12:55] process quickly and I know that many are
[12:58] still out sick sick with colds and flu
[13:00] and Co and everything else amen but
[13:03] God's healing us he's delivering us amen
[13:06] so many are the afflictions of the
[13:08] righteous but the Lord deliver them from
[13:09] them all God bless you brother daring
[13:12] sister Farah it's good to see you here I
[13:13] know you guys got hit pretty hard as
[13:15] well but praise God Amen know every time
[13:18] we're sick it's miserable but when we
[13:21] come out of it we thank God for his
[13:23] healing power and it makes us appreciate
[13:25] what Redemption purchased for us what
[13:27] Calvary purchased for us and Redemption
[13:29] we have a new appreciation for it every
[13:31] time we've been sick amen while we're
[13:34] standing let's turn to Mark chap 1 and
[13:36] look into the word I'm I'm still in the
[13:39] same thought pattern that I've been in
[13:41] the Lord has really been dealing with me
[13:43] in the same line of thinking but it as
[13:46] you know it just always keeps expanding
[13:48] the word is so Dynamic amen it it's been
[13:51] it's been fixed from before the
[13:53] foundation of the world in the mind of
[13:54] God but it certainly has not been fixed
[13:57] in us it's growing and growing gr and
[13:59] growing amen as it expands the
[14:01] Revelation expands to us um so let's
[14:05] look at Mark chapter 1 verse
[14:10] 7 verse 6 and John was clothed with
[14:13] camel's hair and with and with a girdle
[14:16] of skin about his loins and he did eat
[14:18] Locust and wild honey and preach saying
[14:20] there cometh one mightier than I after
[14:22] me the latches of whose shoes I am not
[14:25] worthy to stoop down and unloose I
[14:27] indeed have baptized with water but he
[14:30] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[14:33] amen God bless you as you're seated and
[14:35] may God bless us as we look into his
[14:37] word amen I want to take from here this
[14:41] is when uh John first introduces to in
[14:45] the New Testament he introduces to the
[14:47] concept that there will be a baptism of
[14:49] the Holy Ghost and John says I have
[14:52] indeed baptized you with water but he
[14:55] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[14:58] and when we look at this word baptized
[15:00] is the same word baptized used both
[15:02] times baptized in water and baptized
[15:04] with the Holy Ghost and the word means
[15:07] literally to dip repeatedly to immerse
[15:10] or to
[15:12] submerge and so just like in water
[15:15] baptism when we baptize somebody in
[15:17] water we immerse them completely or
[15:19] submerge them under the water amen
[15:21] there's another there is another word uh
[15:25] that's a shortened version of this word
[15:26] in the Greek that means to dip but it's
[15:28] a quick dipping amen and it's a it's a
[15:30] temporal quick dipping but this is a
[15:33] full immersion a full submersion okay
[15:35] it's a it's a little more intents of a
[15:37] baptism and so the water baptism and the
[15:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost uses this same
[15:42] word an immersion or or a sub to to
[15:46] submerge something and so for a title
[15:49] this evening I'd like to take immersed
[15:51] in the Holy Spirit immersed in the Holy
[15:54] Spirit and I just want to work with that
[15:56] thought as we look into these
[15:59] things let's go to Acts chapter 1
[16:10] together Acts chapter
[16:13] 1 and verse4 here we're going to have
[16:16] Jesus addressing the the disciples after
[16:19] his resurrection in Acts 1:4 and it says
[16:22] and being assembled together with them
[16:24] commanded them that they should not
[16:26] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[16:28] promise of the Father which saith he you
[16:31] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[16:34] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[16:36] the Holy Ghost not many days hence so
[16:39] Jesus picks up the same terminology the
[16:41] same thing that John told him after his
[16:43] resurrection he's confirming John
[16:45] baptized you with water amen but you're
[16:47] going to be baptized amen with the Holy
[16:49] Ghost not many days hence so we picked
[16:53] this up in Acts chapter
[16:55] 2 in Acts chapter 2 verse one
[16:59] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[17:01] come they were with one Accord in one
[17:03] place and suddenly there came a sound
[17:06] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[17:08] and it filled all the house where they
[17:09] were sitting and they and there appeared
[17:11] unto them clothing tongues like as of
[17:13] fire and it sat upon each of them and
[17:16] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[17:19] and began to speak with other tongues as
[17:21] the spirit gave them utterance so here
[17:24] we see the the promise being fulfilled
[17:27] the promise of the fathers has now come
[17:29] and it came in such a mighty Dynamic way
[17:31] Amen in this this initial outpouring
[17:34] they were all waiting like he had told
[17:36] them he told them to wait until they
[17:37] were endured from power from on high and
[17:39] he told them to wait in Jerusalem not to
[17:41] move out until they had received this
[17:44] power and and so here we find it in in
[17:47] Acts chapter 1 it was promised from John
[17:49] the Baptist it was confirmed again from
[17:51] Jesus Christ himself after his
[17:53] resurrection and he said not many days
[17:55] hence and here we are about 40 Days
[17:57] Later approxim 40 days later when
[17:59] Pentecost was fully come in they were
[18:01] all together in one Accord in the upper
[18:04] room and the promise came according to
[18:06] what he said according to the appointed
[18:08] time amen and the the the it came as a
[18:10] rushing Mighty Wind amen clothing
[18:12] tongues of fire the the brother B said
[18:15] the pillar of fire was divided out and
[18:17] over each of them in a visible way
[18:19] showing that the pillar of fire was
[18:21] coming back to dwell in the individual
[18:23] amen and they were all filled with the
[18:27] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[18:29] tongues as the spirit gave them
[18:31] utterance amen so they
[18:35] were uh filled this is another term they
[18:38] were immersed baptized submerged but
[18:41] also to be filled amen because when you
[18:44] are submerged amen if you're able to
[18:47] hold this Holy Ghost you can be filled
[18:49] with it amen praise
[18:53] God brother Bram says in questions and
[18:56] answerers on the Holy Ghost I have quite
[18:57] a few quote so I may not give every
[18:59] reference uh and I might just read
[19:01] little short sections out of them
[19:02] because I have quite a few and I know
[19:04] it's a Wednesday night so don't get
[19:05] tired if I start quoting but there's
[19:07] some phenomenal things that the prophet
[19:09] teaches us and I want to look at that in
[19:11] in light of what we want to talk about
[19:13] and all the way back in 59 questions and
[19:16] answers on the Holy Ghost he said and we
[19:18] find out the Holy Ghost is God himself
[19:21] in
[19:22] you praise God the Holy Ghost is God
[19:25] himself in you not a third person not
[19:28] another person not another being but it
[19:30] is God it is the holy spirit which is
[19:32] the spirit of God and it is the it it is
[19:36] God himself in
[19:39] you amen God was above you in the pillar
[19:43] of fire with Moses God was in you in
[19:45] Jesus with uh God was with you in Jesus
[19:47] Christ now God is in you in the Holy
[19:50] Ghost no three Gods one God working in
[19:52] three
[19:53] offices spoken words The Original Seed
[19:56] he says and when so the B Bible is
[19:58] manifested again like in the early days
[20:01] of Christ cuz you are a predestinated
[20:04] seed just like Christ was and when the
[20:06] rain falls on the seed the life produces
[20:09] itself when the Holy Spirit Falls so now
[20:13] he's going to introduce this concept
[20:16] this is what I want to get into he's
[20:17] introducing the concept of a
[20:18] predestinated seed and now there's a
[20:21] predestinated seed laying in the earth
[20:23] amen and our bodies are the Earth but
[20:26] inside of our Earth is the seed amen and
[20:29] he says when the rain when he says when
[20:31] the rain falls on the seed the life
[20:34] produces itself when the Holy Spirit
[20:37] Falls so now he's typing the rain with
[20:40] the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit
[20:41] Falls Amen on a predestinated seed the
[20:45] life and the seed produces itself which
[20:47] what life would be that what would it be
[20:49] if it's a seed of God it'll produce the
[20:51] life of God
[20:52] Amen so we want to follow this thought
[20:55] through he said when it fell on those
[20:58] seeds Jesus said he chose them when
[21:01] before the foundation of the world when
[21:03] they were a predestinated seed is that
[21:05] right then here they haul themselves up
[21:08] in the upper room these seeds the word
[21:13] and the Word was laying on there without
[21:15] life in
[21:16] it all of a sudden there came a sound
[21:19] from Heaven as Waters begin to gush out
[21:21] and it actually filled all the house
[21:23] where they were sitting and the seeds be
[21:25] to grow it began to manifest itself and
[21:27] the word of God being
[21:29] manifested so now he takes this and he
[21:31] tells us what was going on in the upper
[21:34] room in the upper room there were those
[21:36] amen that had a predestinated seed
[21:38] within them amen and that predestinated
[21:40] seed was part of the word of God it was
[21:43] an attribute of God and God is the word
[21:46] amen and and so they had a part of the
[21:48] word an attribute of God a gene of God a
[21:52] predestinated seed within them in their
[21:54] soul amen and brother brandham said it
[21:57] was it was there
[21:58] amen let's let's read it again as he
[22:00] says it they hauled themselves up in the
[22:03] upper room these seeds the
[22:06] word so what were they they were the
[22:08] word amen they were a part of the word
[22:11] that had to come into manifestation amen
[22:14] and the Word was laying there without
[22:17] life in it now now brother bam uses so
[22:19] much terminology to describe things to
[22:21] us to explain what's happening amen but
[22:24] we know that if it ever had eternal life
[22:27] it always had eternal life is that right
[22:31] amen so it had eternal life there was
[22:33] already life in the seed but it was
[22:35] laying there dormant it needed something
[22:37] to spring it to life it needed a
[22:39] quickening power to Quicken it from its
[22:41] dorcy or of
[22:45] lifelessness into life it wasn't that
[22:47] there was no life there it was an
[22:49] eternal predestinated C Gene of God an
[22:52] attribute of God you can't call it dead
[22:54] but it's laying there in a dead form and
[22:57] it's laying there in an inanimate form
[22:58] in a dormant State waiting for something
[23:01] to trigger it to life and what it needed
[23:03] was what the seed in the ground needs it
[23:05] needs the rain it needs the water it
[23:07] needs the moisture to bring it to
[23:10] life it had to be immersed in the spirit
[23:14] and that immersion in the spirit would
[23:16] fill it up amen and it would spring to
[23:18] life and he says there and the seeds
[23:20] begin to
[23:22] grow
[23:25] amen and the token he says now you are
[23:30] his oh because he is we have the right
[23:33] to all that he purchased for us every
[23:35] promise in the Bible is yours it belongs
[23:37] to you when this token is upon you and
[23:40] God has sealed you now we want to check
[23:42] ourselves just for a moment when God has
[23:44] given you the true baptism of the Holy
[23:47] Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is
[23:49] within
[23:51] you remember he says true baptism of the
[23:55] holy spirit amen there's a reason he
[23:57] says true baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[24:00] we're going to get into that as we
[24:01] progress but when he has given you the
[24:03] true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the
[24:05] life of Jesus Christ is within you now
[24:08] that's true and every Theologian will
[24:11] have to admit that to be yes sir it's
[24:13] the new birth you are born a new of the
[24:16] Holy Ghost and because the holy because
[24:19] that God has did this you know and you
[24:22] know you're no good in yourself and you
[24:25] accept what God has did then he seals
[24:27] you in into his kingdom by the holy
[24:29] spirit amen so let's turn to Ephesians
[24:32] chapter 4
[24:35] together Ephesians chap 4 and verse
[24:41] 30 Ephesians 4 and3 says and grieve not
[24:45] the holy spirit of God where be you are
[24:48] sealed until the day of
[24:51] redemption so we look at this baptism of
[24:55] the Holy
[24:56] Ghost is is also typed with the new
[24:59] birth the true baptism Holy Ghost is
[25:02] typed with the new birth which is also
[25:04] being filled with the spirit which is
[25:06] also being sealed until the day of your
[25:09] Redemption it accomplishes all of these
[25:11] things the true baptism of the Holy
[25:13] Ghost accomplishes the new
[25:15] birth amen which is the filling of the
[25:18] Holy Ghost or the indwelling of Jesus
[25:20] Christ or God himself and you which also
[25:24] seals you into the day of
[25:26] redemption now we want to know why the
[25:29] true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:31] accomplishes all these things says in
[25:34] the message leadership he says you are
[25:35] here because your name was placed on the
[25:37] Lamb's Book of Life before there was
[25:39] even a foundation of the world that's
[25:42] exactly right you're a gene a spiritual
[25:44] Gene out of your heavenly father a part
[25:47] of God's
[25:48] word that explains it friends so that
[25:52] God when God sends down the rain the
[25:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost upon you amen
[25:57] he's doing it for a very specific reason
[26:00] amen because there's something in you
[26:02] that is laying there that must come to
[26:04] life it's a word that is predestinated
[26:07] to be expressed in the hour that we're
[26:09] living God doesn't send his word in vain
[26:12] amen he sent out his word and he said my
[26:14] word shall not return unto me void but
[26:16] it'll accomplish that which I sent it
[26:17] for so if you're part of that word that
[26:19] he sent into the Earth he sent it as a
[26:22] seed a gene an attribute in your soul
[26:25] amen and you are part of the word so go
[26:27] God has to send down the spirit to the
[26:30] moisture the water to immerse you Amen
[26:32] to bring to life that word so that word
[26:35] that he predestinated from his mind can
[26:38] come into manifestation and become the
[26:40] living word for this
[26:42] day that's the purpose amen there's so
[26:45] many uh there's so many times we can
[26:47] talk about amen these terms the baptism
[26:49] of the Holy Ghost seeking the baptism of
[26:51] the Holy Ghost having the experience of
[26:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we
[26:55] must understand to me I'm one to
[26:58] understand what is it what is it for
[27:00] what is it supposed to do I don't just
[27:02] want to throw out terms amen and
[27:04] sometimes terms we can have terms with
[27:06] different understanding different
[27:07] meanings but I want to know what brother
[27:09] benam was talking about what is this
[27:11] great power of the Holy Ghost supposed
[27:13] to do for me it is supposed to bring me
[27:15] alive amen bring a seed of God alive
[27:19] within me it's it's an experience of
[27:21] what an experience of the new birth what
[27:23] is the experience of the new birth a
[27:25] change your soul change something you
[27:27] changed the old things died you became a
[27:30] new creature in Christ Jesus it's a
[27:32] literal New
[27:33] Birth a spiritual New
[27:38] Birth
[27:41] amen this is why for me so many times if
[27:44] we put the emphasis on the wrong thing
[27:47] we put the emphasis on on what whatever
[27:50] we put the emphasis on Amen we can stay
[27:52] stuck in that emphasis and be satisfied
[27:55] because we had an emotional experience
[27:57] be satisfied because something manifest
[27:59] or some gift worked amen but unless we
[28:02] realize that the whole purpose of this
[28:04] immersion in the spirit is to get down
[28:07] to that seed I have to be fully dipped
[28:10] submerged emerged amen down into the
[28:13] very spiritual presence of almighty God
[28:16] I have to come in contact with the very
[28:18] spirit of God himself the Living God and
[28:21] I must be immersed in that presence for
[28:24] what reason so I can walk out and say I
[28:26] had such an experience no so that what's
[28:28] laying dormant inside can come alive and
[28:30] begin to manifest it's for the purpose
[28:34] of the new birth it is equated with the
[28:36] new
[28:39] birth that's why it's also a
[28:43] seal because once that
[28:46] seed has come in contact with that
[28:52] life there's no reversing
[28:56] it once that word that's laying there
[29:00] waiting for its counterpart to come and
[29:03] Quicken
[29:04] it it's laying there waiting for
[29:06] something it's waiting for the promise
[29:08] of the
[29:09] father to what to bring it to
[29:13] life once that seed that Gene that
[29:16] attribute that word once it's laying
[29:19] there amen and that immersion of the
[29:23] spirit of God comes upon it amen not
[29:26] just upon your flesh
[29:28] not just upon your spirit but all the
[29:30] way down to the soul and connects with
[29:32] an eternal attribute of God all of a
[29:35] sudden that Springs the life amen in the
[29:38] real you the genuine you what was
[29:40] intended to be you amen the Son of God
[29:42] from before the foundation of the world
[29:44] Springs to life and a new birth your
[29:46] soul is changed your desires is changed
[29:49] what you want is changed your appetites
[29:51] is changed amen now all your focus is on
[29:54] Christ only and you don't want the
[29:56] things of the world anymore more why
[29:58] you're a new birth once your birth once
[30:00] these two things come together you
[30:02] cannot tear them apart again you cannot
[30:05] put it back dormant you cannot let it
[30:07] lay there as dead it's already been
[30:08] sprung to life it is sealed until the
[30:11] day of redemption it these two parts
[30:13] have come together infused Amen in a
[30:16] union in a new birth amen and you're not
[30:18] going to undo that it is a
[30:22] seal it is so much like natural
[30:26] reproduction amen because there is a
[30:28] seed that comes from the male to the
[30:30] female into the womb of the female at
[30:33] natural reproduction amen but the seed
[30:35] can come and the seed can go the seed
[30:38] can come and the seed can go but in
[30:40] order for there to be a conception life
[30:43] amen uh uh to bring a birth there has to
[30:46] be something in the wound amen that can
[30:49] connect with this seed there has to be
[30:50] two parts that can come together and
[30:53] fuse and Link together and once the egg
[30:56] and the seed have come together infused
[30:59] amen they are predestinated for one
[31:01] another they are linked to one another
[31:02] they meant for one another but this egg
[31:05] is sitting there waiting for life to
[31:07] come to it amen it can never come to
[31:09] life till life comes to it but it's got
[31:11] the potential amen it's a mate it's a
[31:14] match it's waiting for its
[31:17] counterpart and when the counterpart
[31:19] comes to it there's a there's a fusion T
[31:22] takes place and a life that begins to
[31:24] form amen and that's irreversal
[31:27] now it's sealed amen it's destined to
[31:30] come
[31:31] forth that's why the true baptism of the
[31:34] Holy Ghost is the new
[31:37] birth is the filling of the Holy Ghost
[31:41] is the Seal of
[31:45] God
[31:48] Amen I thank God to live in the day
[31:50] where the prophet of God has explained
[31:52] these things to us the Mysteries are
[31:54] being revealed what for to root us and
[31:57] ground us so we're not tossed by every
[31:59] wind of Doctrine and the slide of men's
[32:01] hands as they cunningly devise fables
[32:03] amen we're not getting tossed by this
[32:05] Doctrine and this Church's Doctrine but
[32:07] we're established in the solid word of
[32:09] God we know who we are we know what's
[32:11] happened to us we know why it's happened
[32:13] to
[32:13] us and we know what results it's
[32:16] supposed to bring amen
[32:21] amen in the Rapture message the prophet
[32:23] said then how do we get into this body 1
[32:26] Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all
[32:28] baptized into this body by one Holy
[32:30] Spirit baptism that if you want to put
[32:33] that down in First Corinthians 1213 and
[32:35] by one Spirit we're all baptized and the
[32:38] spirit is the Life of Christ amen I
[32:41] thought it was
[32:43] God Amen it
[32:47] is the spirit is the Life of Christ is
[32:49] that right and the life of Christ and
[32:52] the life of any seed which he was he was
[32:56] the word seed brings the seed to life
[32:59] you get it if that life is laying in the
[33:02] seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit
[33:05] comes upon it it's bound to bring that
[33:08] seed
[33:10] life it's the same life it's the same
[33:13] life comes to it it'll bring that seed
[33:16] what was he he was the word is that
[33:20] right he was the word this is why
[33:22] brother brandham says when he walked by
[33:25] the Sea of Galilee you were there with
[33:26] him
[33:27] when he raised the dead you were there
[33:29] why he was the fullness of the word made
[33:31] bodily amen and you amen and when I say
[33:34] you listen when I talk about you I'm not
[33:36] talking about the part my eyes
[33:40] see I'm talking about the part that God
[33:43] predestinated before the foundation
[33:44] world to be a Son of God this outside
[33:47] flesh is born in hybridization it's got
[33:49] corruption all over it's got a cabor
[33:51] nature that goes with it and it's only
[33:53] doing its best to reflect another life
[33:56] that's on the inside
[33:57] side but when I say you I'm talking
[33:59] about the life that's deep in the inside
[34:02] that's the you I'm talking
[34:04] about amen and you are part of that word
[34:10] that's why you were there with
[34:15] him he was expressing the life of that
[34:19] word The Life of Christ the anointed
[34:23] word he said my father will send you the
[34:25] comforter you'll send it in my
[34:29] name but then he goes on to say but I
[34:32] will come to
[34:33] you he says I and my father will come to
[34:36] you make our Abode with you who's coming
[34:39] back it's that same life what is it it's
[34:41] the life of the word are the life of the
[34:44] seed so the seed that is in within me
[34:48] amen the real me the Son of God is the
[34:51] same kind of seed he was the fullness
[34:54] this is just a
[34:55] portion he was the word this is part of
[34:58] the word but the life that left that
[35:01] word at Calvary now when that life comes
[35:04] on it's the life of the word and when
[35:06] the life of the word connects with the
[35:08] word it Springs it to
[35:12] life so if the life is laying in the
[35:16] seed so you realize there must be a life
[35:20] laying in that
[35:21] seed brother vom called it a germatize
[35:25] seed he has so many ways of describing
[35:28] this amen he says he calls it a gerti
[35:30] seed and he talks about it uh uh in in
[35:34] uh the fourth seal and in the fourth
[35:35] seal he talks about there was seeds
[35:37] laying under the Earth after the
[35:39] destruction of the Earth in Genesis 1:2
[35:41] amen there was seeds laying there from
[35:42] another civilization or something like
[35:44] that amen and when God brought the right
[35:46] conditions he knows that there was seeds
[35:48] down there amen that were gerti seeds
[35:50] there was other seeds there that were
[35:53] germatize they were burned out by the
[35:55] waters is what he said
[35:57] but the one seed that had life in it
[36:00] when God parted the waters and brought
[36:02] the light and he brought the conditions
[36:04] right amen the life that was in that
[36:06] seed connected with the light amen and
[36:08] it sprung forth the life and began to
[36:10] produce what was ever in the
[36:12] seed so he's typing that with us under
[36:15] our Earth under a shroud of Darkness
[36:18] under a clouded spirit amen under under
[36:20] the darkness of deception of Corruption
[36:23] of hybridization all under all this
[36:25] Darkness amen there's a seed laying down
[36:28] there amen some seeds were not
[36:35] dermatiti they already have life in them
[36:38] what are they waiting for to connect
[36:39] with the same kind of life and when life
[36:41] comes to life when word comes to word
[36:44] when Eagle comes to Eagle what does it
[36:46] do it comes to
[36:48] life when when it's immersed in the
[36:52] spirit I want to I want us to catch that
[36:55] the immersion in the spirit
[36:59] he he goes on to saying God's power to
[37:01] transform God through a seed of his word
[37:04] and there's only one thing that can
[37:05] Quicken the word and that is the spirit
[37:08] for it is the lifegiver to the word and
[37:11] when the life and the word meets the
[37:13] life of the spirit it produces whatever
[37:16] the seed is when the life in the word
[37:19] that's down inside of you amen meets the
[37:22] life of the spirit which is the life of
[37:24] the word when those two come together it
[37:27] produces whatever the seed is so why you
[37:30] can't take the seed of a dog amen and
[37:32] mix it with the egg of a cat you can't
[37:34] take the seed of a chimpanzee and mix it
[37:36] with the dra you understand they've got
[37:38] to be two parts of the same thing that
[37:40] come
[37:41] together so the life of the word and the
[37:44] word have to come together amen and when
[37:46] it comes together it brings
[37:51] life and questions and answers on the
[37:53] Holy Ghost brother B says oh brother
[37:55] sister we're at Katie barer you're
[37:57] tasting now last night the Holy Spirit
[37:59] fell upon us come in us like a a rushing
[38:02] wind it settled upon many of you today
[38:05] ministers have been visiting homes here
[38:06] and there laying on hands and praying
[38:09] for them that seeking the Holy Ghost
[38:11] don't you take a
[38:13] substitute don't you take some kind of
[38:15] noise don't you take some kind of
[38:18] sensation you wait there until God has
[38:21] molded you and made you a new creation a
[38:23] new creature made you a new person amen
[38:27] what are we looking for amen we must
[38:30] have an experience of the baptism of
[38:32] Holy Ghost what is that experience the
[38:34] experience is something changed me so
[38:37] don't take just a noise don't take just
[38:40] a sensation amen and listen when brother
[38:43] B says this he's not telling you don't
[38:45] have a noise and don't have a sensation
[38:47] many of us had Sensations at the baptism
[38:50] of Holy Ghost many of us had different
[38:52] manifestations and many experiences and
[38:54] Supernatural experiences and Sensations
[38:57] amen it's not he's not excluding it he's
[39:00] telling us not to focus on that and seek
[39:02] that that may come that may not come it
[39:05] may come in a variety of different
[39:06] manifestations for different individuals
[39:09] but the thing that we're watching for is
[39:11] that there's something that comes upon
[39:13] me that actually quickens something
[39:15] inside of me and there's a change that
[39:17] takes place within till I'm a new
[39:20] creature amen till my desires have
[39:22] changed till my focus has
[39:25] shifted that's what we're waiting for
[39:28] that's what he's telling the people to
[39:29] watch for that's why he says don't take
[39:31] some noise don't take some sensation
[39:34] amen because there can be a sensation
[39:36] there can be a sensation that falls but
[39:38] it may not have fell deep enough yet it
[39:40] may have just Fallen upon your spirit
[39:42] and you got excited and you had a
[39:44] sensation and you get up and shout and
[39:46] dance but until you've had a full
[39:48] submersion in the spirit and that Spirit
[39:50] has touched that life in your soul amen
[39:53] it's not finished it's not a finished
[39:54] work yet amen
[39:57] right there must be an immersion that
[39:59] brings the seed to
[40:02] life makes us a new creature a new
[40:10] person Amen in the message does God ever
[40:13] change his mind about his word he says
[40:16] says then you the devil will punch at
[40:19] you I love this he'll say everything to
[40:23] you and accuse you and try to make you
[40:24] think that you're not but don't listen
[40:26] to
[40:28] him now you know you've passed from
[40:31] death into life you know the things that
[40:34] you once love you don't love no more you
[40:36] know that you have believed every word
[40:38] of God you've seen God working right
[40:40] Among Us with infallible proofs that he
[40:42] is The Great I Am brother re saying the
[40:45] devil's going to try to make you
[40:47] believe they might make you think that
[40:49] you're not but don't you listen to
[40:54] him says you know you passed from Death
[40:56] to life you know that the things you
[40:59] once loved you don't love no more every
[41:01] time brother B starts getting down to
[41:03] the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen he
[41:05] starts pointing at a changed life said
[41:09] your soul changed didn't it how will you
[41:10] know your soul changed didn't it he said
[41:12] you used to do this and you used to love
[41:14] this and you used to be entangled with
[41:16] the world but something changed he said
[41:17] what did that and he starts talking
[41:20] about now it's not just the change
[41:22] there's a change but that change moves
[41:24] all your focus to Christ and now the
[41:27] only thing you want is the word amen and
[41:29] you line up to the word and you believe
[41:31] the word and you follow the word and you
[41:32] never reject the word and that's the
[41:34] evidence he's talking about of the Holy
[41:36] Ghost because the Holy Ghost was sent to
[41:39] lead and guide us unto all truth all
[41:41] truth amen it will not lead and guide us
[41:43] into a false and it won't lead us into a
[41:45] rejection of truths amen but it'll lead
[41:48] us into all
[41:52] truths I go back I want to go back and
[41:54] just read a small excerpt that I talked
[41:56] about last time I preached from the
[41:58] private interview the only private
[41:59] interview that I know of that we have a
[42:01] recording of is with sister Bruce and of
[42:03] all the private interviews and all the
[42:05] information we'd love to have and all
[42:06] the things we'd love to know he said God
[42:08] preserved one and he preserved one
[42:10] because amen this I this is my personal
[42:14] belief I believe God allowed this to
[42:15] come through because we would need what
[42:17] was on this private interview because we
[42:20] were coming out of a Pentecostal Revival
[42:23] as it was fading and dying
[42:25] Pentecostalism had gotten the wrong
[42:26] Focus Amen brother brandham started
[42:28] saying amen actually brother brandham
[42:30] started calling the Pentecostal
[42:32] preachers 2x4
[42:33] preachers you know what he meant by 2
[42:35] by4 Acts 2 and 4 and they were all
[42:37] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[42:39] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[42:40] gave them utterance and he says they
[42:42] become two by4 preachers that's all
[42:43] they're preaching because they haven't
[42:45] gone on to preach what the Holy Ghost
[42:47] was supposed to do and where it's
[42:48] supposed to take us amen supposed to
[42:50] bring us all the way into
[42:54] adoption and because we were coming com
[42:56] out of the Pentecostal Revival with all
[42:58] the ideas that would carry over Amen
[43:00] brother Brandon would allow this little
[43:03] Our God would allow brother BR to have
[43:05] this interview with this woman and this
[43:07] one would be taped and this one is be
[43:08] the one that we
[43:13] have and she says to brother
[43:15] Branham but I've never had an experience
[43:18] that I've been filled with the Holy
[43:19] Ghost that I can put my foot
[43:23] on brother said all right notice this
[43:25] ordinary a human being is born in sin
[43:28] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[43:29] speaking lies that's the nature of human
[43:32] being Sister Bruce says yes that was
[43:35] your nature it changed once what changed
[43:38] it she says Christ said there you are
[43:42] sister that's
[43:45] it she wanted an experience she could
[43:48] put her foot
[43:49] on and brother Brenham gave her
[43:52] one something changed you what was it
[43:56] that she said Christ he said there you
[43:57] go sister that's
[43:59] it and it didn't just change you listen
[44:02] it wasn't just change you like all of a
[44:05] sudden I I I I I didn't drink anymore
[44:07] and didn't smoke but it changed you from
[44:09] that but it changed you into something
[44:12] it changed you into a lover of the word
[44:14] amen to where you go all the way you can
[44:16] stop drinking but reject this word and
[44:18] it wasn't the Holy
[44:20] Ghost you can quit committing adultery
[44:23] and become faithful to your wife but if
[44:24] you if you if you turn away from this
[44:26] word then that's not the Holy Ghost cuz
[44:28] the Holy Ghost will lead and guide you
[44:29] into all truth there's a change that
[44:31] takes place inside and it changes you
[44:33] away from things but it changes you to
[44:36] things it turns you away and points you
[44:38] and leads you all the way through all
[44:41] the way to the
[44:46] end praise
[44:51] God he goes on now now this is where I
[44:55] want to uh keep teaching I want to teach
[44:57] some of the other side now and the suan
[45:00] church age out of the church age book
[45:03] says now then here we are coming to a
[45:06] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[45:08] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[45:11] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[45:13] and that Eternal one was the father
[45:14] manifest in flesh and thereby gained the
[45:16] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[45:20] thoughts in our turn became the many
[45:22] membered spoken word
[45:24] seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal
[45:28] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[45:30] sons of
[45:32] God I want you to catch that he's not
[45:35] just saying your flesh that flesh has to
[45:37] be made over again we know that but he
[45:40] says
[45:42] it's the Eternal
[45:45] thoughts which that's you the real
[45:49] you the Eternal thoughts now manifest in
[45:53] flesh are the sons of God God what are
[45:57] the sons of God the Eternal thoughts the
[45:59] seed the word the G and now it's
[46:01] manifest in
[46:03] flesh amen they are the sons of God even
[46:07] as we are so called we did not become
[46:10] seed by the
[46:12] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[46:15] reborn for only the elect can be
[46:21] reborn because we were seed is the
[46:23] reason we could be quickened in nonseed
[46:26] there is nothing to
[46:29] Quicken so what did the baptism of the
[46:31] Holy Ghost come for the Merion the
[46:34] submer to be submerged in the spirit of
[46:36] God came to do what it came to Quicken
[46:40] the predestinated seed to life in
[46:42] nonseed there's nothing to Quicken amen
[46:45] but that immersion for the seed of God
[46:48] came to Quicken it's the rebirth we were
[46:50] not reborn we did not become seed we
[46:53] were not become seed because we were
[46:55] Reborn we were reborn because we were
[46:57] already seed you can't be birthed Amen
[47:00] in this process unless the seed is
[47:02] already
[47:07] there because we were seed is the reason
[47:10] we could be
[47:12] quickened this is so important to
[47:16] understand now we're seeing the power
[47:19] not just the power but the purpose of
[47:22] the baptism of the Holy
[47:24] Ghost and Matthew 5:45 if we could turn
[47:28] there together look at this
[47:36] scripture Matthew
[47:45] 5:45 Matthew
[47:48] 5:45 he says that ye may be the children
[47:51] of your father which is in heaven for he
[47:53] maketh his son to rise on the east evil
[47:56] and on the good and sendeth reain on the
[47:58] just and on the unjust this is a concept
[48:01] that brother brenham's going to teach on
[48:03] he's going to teach on this in relation
[48:05] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he
[48:07] sends he he makes his son to rise on the
[48:10] evil and on the good and sendeth reain
[48:12] on the just and on the
[48:16] unjust in the church age book when you
[48:19] get into the pergan church age section
[48:22] he says now let me tell you I was
[48:24] shocked what brother benam is referring
[48:27] to is when he went to Mishawaka Indiana
[48:29] as a young Baptist Minister he was
[48:31] coming through from a fishing trip and
[48:32] he stopped over and he saw a gathering
[48:34] of the Pentecostal people the Oneness
[48:36] Pentecostal people and he saw amen
[48:38] manifestations of the spirit speaking in
[48:40] tongues and interpretations of tongues
[48:42] and he saw amen that one would speak
[48:45] with tongues and another one would
[48:46] interpret and somebody from the back
[48:47] would get up in response and go and
[48:49] commit their life to Christ and he was
[48:50] amazed and he wanted to talk to them
[48:52] because he knew he had a gift of
[48:54] discernment he knew be able to know and
[48:56] he began to talk to the first brother
[48:57] these two main Brethren that were used
[48:59] in this way in these meetings he talked
[49:01] the first time one and he said he would
[49:03] he found a humble genuine Christian
[49:05] brother and he goes and he speaks to the
[49:07] next one and he said if there ever was a
[49:09] hypocrite that was the guy said he was
[49:12] married to a blonde woman but living
[49:13] with a brunette and had two children by
[49:15] her and he said he was proud and
[49:17] boastful and arrogant amen and brother
[49:18] brenon was confused and left the whole
[49:20] thing alone and that's what he's
[49:22] referring to now when he gets to this
[49:23] section of the church age book said now
[49:26] let me tell you I was shocked how could
[49:28] I not be here were two men one of them
[49:30] was a real believer and the other was a
[49:32] sinful
[49:33] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[49:36] gifts of the Spirit I was troubled by
[49:38] this confusion I left the meeting to
[49:40] seek God for the answer I went alone to
[49:43] a secret place and there with my Bible I
[49:44] prayed and waited on God for the answer
[49:47] not knowing just what portion of
[49:48] scripture to read I casually open the
[49:50] Bible to some place in Matthew I read
[49:53] for a while and then laid the Bible down
[49:55] in a moment the wind blew into the room
[49:57] and turned the pages of the Bible to
[49:59] Hebrews chapter 6 I read it through and
[50:01] was particularly impressed by the
[50:03] strange verse this those strange verses
[50:06] Hebrews chapter 6 4 for9 ver Verses 4
[50:09] to9 and we're going to read it here for
[50:12] it is impossible for those who were once
[50:14] enlightened and have tasted of the
[50:15] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[50:17] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[50:19] word of God and the powers of the world
[50:22] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[50:24] them again into repentance seeing They
[50:26] Crucified to themselves the Son of God
[50:28] aresh and put him to an open shame for
[50:32] the Earth which drinketh in the rain
[50:33] that cometh off upon it and bringeth
[50:35] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[50:37] dressed receiveth blessings from God but
[50:40] that which bearth thorns and briers is
[50:42] rejected and is nigh into cursing whose
[50:44] end it is to be burned but beloved we
[50:46] are persuaded better things of you and
[50:48] things that accompany salvation though
[50:50] we thus speak then he goes on to say I
[50:53] Clos the Bible laid it down and
[50:55] meditated a while and prayed some more I
[50:57] still had no answer I again to open the
[50:59] Bible aimlessly but did not read
[51:01] suddenly the wind blew into the room
[51:03] again and once more the pages turned to
[51:04] Hebrews 6 and remained there as the wind
[51:07] ceased I read those words over again and
[51:09] when I did then came the spirit of God
[51:11] into the room and into the room and I
[51:15] beheld a vision I saw in the vision a
[51:17] man dressed in the purest white who went
[51:19] forth into a flesh freshly plowed field
[51:22] and sewed grain it was a bright day the
[51:25] sewing was done in the morning but late
[51:27] at night after the sewer and white had
[51:29] gone a man in Black came and stealthily
[51:31] SED some more seed amongst that which
[51:33] the man in White had sown the days went
[51:36] by the the the Sun and Rain blessed the
[51:39] ground and one day there appeared the
[51:41] grain how fine it was but a day later
[51:44] appeared the tears the wheat and tears
[51:46] grew together they partook of the same
[51:47] nourishment out of the same soil they
[51:49] drank in the same sun and Rain then one
[51:52] day the skies turned to brass and the
[51:54] plants all began to droop and to die I
[51:57] heard the wheat lift their heads and cry
[51:59] to God for rain the tears also lifted up
[52:01] their voices and pleaded for rain then
[52:04] the skies darkened and the rain came and
[52:06] again the wheat now full of strength
[52:08] lifted up their voices and cried in
[52:10] adoration praise the Lord and to my
[52:12] wonderment I heard the revived tears
[52:15] also look up and say
[52:17] hallelujah then I knew the truth of the
[52:19] camp meeting in the vision the parable
[52:22] of the sewer and the seed the sixth
[52:24] chapter of Hebrews now this Parable the
[52:27] SE seed and the uh SE and the seed you
[52:29] can find it in Matthew I believe chapter
[52:31] 13 yeah Matthew 13:24 to 30 Jesus talks
[52:34] about a man went forth and sowed good
[52:36] seed in the ground then an enemy came
[52:39] later and SED other seed and he SED
[52:43] tears they all came up together and this
[52:46] is what the vision is showing brother
[52:47] bam this thing that the parable that
[52:49] Jesus told the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[52:51] this and Jesus goes to explain it that
[52:54] the good seed are the children children
[52:55] are the seed of the son of man the
[52:57] children of God but those are the other
[52:58] seed the seed of the wicked amen they'll
[53:00] grow up together amen and they're not to
[53:02] be torn apart from one another but in
[53:04] the end time he'll send laborers workers
[53:06] into the field and they'll be separated
[53:09] how will they be separated they'll be
[53:10] separated by the
[53:13] word so there are two different seeds
[53:15] that are swn into the
[53:18] Earth so then he goes now I knew the
[53:20] truth of the camp meeting and the vision
[53:22] the parable the sewer and the seed the
[53:23] sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident
[53:26] manifestation of spiritual gifts in a
[53:28] mixed audience all became wonderfully
[53:31] clear the S and white was the Lord the
[53:34] so and black was the devil the word was
[53:36] the field the seeds were people elect
[53:38] and reprobates both partook of the same
[53:41] nourishment water and Sun both prayed
[53:43] both received help from God for he
[53:45] maketh his son and Reign to fall on the
[53:48] both good and evil and though they both
[53:51] had the same wonderful blessing and both
[53:54] had the same Wonder wonderful
[53:56] manifestations there was still that one
[53:59] great difference they were of different
[54:04] seed this is it
[54:07] friends they they they both partook of
[54:10] the Sun and Rain he make the Sun and
[54:12] Rain to fall on both good and evil just
[54:15] and unjust and they they both had the
[54:17] same wonderful blessings and both had
[54:19] the same wonderful
[54:22] manifestations there was one great
[54:24] difference they were of different
[54:28] seed now let's go to Matthew chapter
[54:33] 7 Matthew 7 verse
[54:43] 21 Matthew chap
[54:46] 7 verse
[54:51] 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[54:54] Lord shall enter into the the kingdom of
[54:55] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[54:57] Father which is in heaven now stop right
[55:00] there what is the will of the Father the
[55:05] word he that follows all the word what's
[55:09] the Holy Ghost to do to lead and guide
[55:11] us into all truth the Holy Ghost will
[55:14] keep the word will lead us to the word
[55:16] will never reject the word and never
[55:17] lead us away from the word amen so here
[55:20] we see a great difference right here not
[55:23] everyone that sayith Lord Lord shall
[55:25] enter into so not everybody that claims
[55:27] Jesus Christ as Lord but those that keep
[55:30] the word that doeth the will of the
[55:31] father they're the ones that's going to
[55:33] enter
[55:33] in many will say to me in that day Lord
[55:36] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[55:39] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[55:41] thy name do many wonderful works and
[55:43] then will I profess unto them I never
[55:46] knew you depart from me ye that work
[55:49] iniquity iniquity is knowing to do good
[55:52] and not doing
[55:54] it
[55:56] who is he rejected those that work
[55:57] iniquity who is received those that do
[55:59] the will of the father or keep the word
[56:02] it still comes down to the word
[56:07] friends so they said we have not have we
[56:10] not prophesied in thy name they're
[56:11] talking to the King of Kings they're not
[56:13] standing at the white Throne judgment
[56:15] and lying yeah Jesus never denies that
[56:18] they did these wonderful Works they
[56:20] prophesied in thy name in thy name cast
[56:23] out devils and in thy name done many
[56:25] wonderful Works he never denied it I
[56:28] don't believe they're standing there
[56:29] making it up or lying at the white
[56:31] Throne judgment when all the thoughts of
[56:32] men are made known amen this is not
[56:34] they're not lying they truly did those
[56:36] things and I believe they did amen but
[56:40] brother in the church age book said here
[56:42] also was the answer to Matthew 7:21-23
[56:45] he says it's just after what we read he
[56:48] says Jesus does not deny that they did
[56:51] the mighty works that only the Holy
[56:53] Ghost can accomplish by by way of
[56:56] men I'm going to read that again Jesus
[56:58] did not deny that they did the mighty
[57:00] works that only the Holy Ghost can
[57:03] accomplish by way of
[57:05] men even Jesus told them in that day he
[57:10] said if Satan cast out Satan won't he be
[57:12] defeated it's not the work of Satan that
[57:14] cast out these Spirits it's the work of
[57:18] God this is where it gets
[57:20] confusing unless we have a prophet amen
[57:25] Jesus did not deny that they did the
[57:27] mighty works that only the Holy Ghost
[57:29] can accomplish by a way of wi you can
[57:31] see men doing the works that only the
[57:35] Holy Ghost can do only by the power of
[57:37] God can these things be done Satan is
[57:39] not again divided against Satan Satan is
[57:41] not casting out Satan it's the power of
[57:44] the Holy Ghost working the
[57:46] works and if we don't have good grounded
[57:49] teaching that we don't understand what's
[57:51] happening we think well that's a
[57:52] Christian that's a man of God that's a a
[57:54] Son of God that does not mean that
[57:57] that's a Son of God that does not mean
[57:58] that that's a a child of
[58:00] God
[58:02] Amen that's what we see in Matthew 7
[58:05] yeah Jesus does not deny that they and
[58:08] they weren't doing these things in the
[58:09] name of the devil or the name of a
[58:11] church they they says did we not do
[58:13] these cast out devil that prophesy in
[58:15] thy name they were doing in the name of
[58:17] Jesus
[58:18] Christ so Jesus does not deny that they
[58:20] did the mighty works that only the Holy
[58:22] Ghost can accomplish by way of men but
[58:24] he did deny that he ever knew them these
[58:28] weren't
[58:29] backsliders these were Wicked
[58:31] unregenerate reprobates these were the
[58:33] seed of
[58:40] Satan I'm so glad I can read the
[58:45] prophet he can say things that I don't
[58:48] have the authority to
[58:50] say in the message of leadership he says
[58:52] the choice of your conduct you can't mix
[58:55] it now you're either for God or against
[58:58] God and the outward expression shows
[59:00] exactly what's on the
[59:01] inside many of you think I got the
[59:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[59:05] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[59:07] you're going to heaven no sir you can
[59:11] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[59:13] hour in your life and still be lost and
[59:15] go to
[59:17] hell I hope this doesn't confuse you
[59:19] because I've been talking about the
[59:20] baptism Holy Ghost quicking the seed but
[59:22] now we're going to show more in depth
[59:24] we're going to get a good clear picture
[59:26] of this of this teaching you can have
[59:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour
[59:31] in your life and still be lost and go to
[59:34] hell the Bible says so that's exactly
[59:36] right look here you are an outside
[59:38] person you have five senses that
[59:40] contacts the outside body God gave you
[59:43] five senses not to contact him your
[59:45] Earthly home seed taste feel smell and
[59:47] here then you have a spirit on the
[59:49] inside of that and it has five Outlets
[59:51] conscience and love and so forth five
[59:53] Outlets that you contact the spirit
[59:54] world with but with your spirit your
[59:57] physical contacts the physical your
[59:59] spiritual contacts the spiritual but
[1:00:02] inside of that you got a soul and that
[1:00:05] soul is the gene that come from God
[1:00:08] what's brother benam telling us he's
[1:00:10] telling us that you can have the baptism
[1:00:12] of the Holy Ghost you can be immersed in
[1:00:14] the Holy Ghost but the immersion of the
[1:00:16] Holy Ghost is there to Quicken a seed on
[1:00:19] the inside but if there's no seed on the
[1:00:21] inside you can still be immersed the
[1:00:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost but that
[1:00:26] immersion will not bring a new birth
[1:00:28] because there's nothing inside to
[1:00:30] Quicken but it's not that it's not an
[1:00:32] immersion it's an a baptism of the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost it's an immersion in the Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost but it's not an immersion that
[1:00:38] brings a new birth that's why he said if
[1:00:39] you have the true baptism of the Holy
[1:00:41] Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:44] is the new birth brings the fullness of
[1:00:46] Christ inside and seals you because it
[1:00:48] brings to life the seed that's laying
[1:00:51] there but if there's no seed there you
[1:00:54] can still be immersed you're submerged
[1:00:57] in the Holy Ghost and have
[1:00:59] manifestations and Gifts the gifts and
[1:01:01] callings of God are without repentance
[1:01:03] amen it doesn't you don't even have to
[1:01:05] be born again to manifest those gifts
[1:01:07] you can manifest those gifts and if
[1:01:08] they're laying in you amen the immersion
[1:01:11] of the Holy Gift can bring out the gifts
[1:01:13] and they can begin to operate and
[1:01:14] operate correctly and operate spoton
[1:01:17] that's still no evidence you're born
[1:01:21] again you're only born again when the
[1:01:23] predestinate C Gene of God comes to life
[1:01:26] by the immersion of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:27] that's the new birth and the evidence is
[1:01:29] you're changed amen and the evidence is
[1:01:32] you take all the word all the way and
[1:01:34] you never leave
[1:01:37] it it's why it can be so deceiving
[1:01:40] coming out of a Pentecostal Revival and
[1:01:42] having those thoughts mixed in amen we
[1:01:45] have to have the true understanding
[1:01:46] there's nothing wrong with the gifts the
[1:01:48] gifts are perfect the gifts are good the
[1:01:50] gifts are meant to be here they still
[1:01:51] need to be in operation not a thing
[1:01:53] wrong with them nothing wrong with
[1:01:55] Sensations and experiences we want those
[1:01:57] and we want more of them amen but we
[1:01:59] have to know what the new birth actually
[1:02:01] is because you can have Sensations in
[1:02:04] meetings you can get excited you can get
[1:02:06] enthused you can even have
[1:02:07] manifestations but unless something
[1:02:09] inside of you is quickened to life youve
[1:02:11] not been born
[1:02:18] again he goes on to saying trying to do
[1:02:21] God a service without it being God's
[1:02:22] will the outside Spirit can be Anointed
[1:02:25] with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark
[1:02:28] as
[1:02:31] pitch where would we be friends without
[1:02:33] a
[1:02:35] prophet that's why on these subjects I
[1:02:37] want the prophet to show us the way not
[1:02:40] our tradition not our ideas not our
[1:02:42] preferences let the prophet teach us the
[1:02:44] truth of this
[1:02:45] age the outside Spirit can be Anointed
[1:02:48] with the Holy Ghost and the soul is dark
[1:02:49] as pitch the cerber grows on the same
[1:02:52] water that builds puts life into the
[1:02:54] wheat puts life into the Cocker but at
[1:02:57] the bottom of the Cocker it's a cckar
[1:02:59] life it's rejoicing and blooming and got
[1:03:02] life and doing everything that the wheat
[1:03:04] does but the soul of its cocko bur false
[1:03:07] teachers can rise teaching all kinds of
[1:03:08] trinitarianism and everything else and
[1:03:10] be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:12] perform just as many miracles as the
[1:03:14] true gospel
[1:03:17] can my but it can't stay with the word
[1:03:23] right let's go to Matthew
[1:03:29] 24 Matthew 24:24 this is the scripture
[1:03:32] that brother Brenham preaches anointed
[1:03:33] ones at the end time
[1:03:35] from Matthew 24:24 he says for there
[1:03:38] shall arise false Christ and false
[1:03:41] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:03:44] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:03:45] possible they should deceive the very
[1:03:48] elect in the message anointed ones at
[1:03:50] the end time he
[1:03:52] says what were they Christ Christ and he
[1:03:54] spells it out c r i STS is Anointed
[1:03:58] Christ and false prophets anointed ones
[1:04:01] but false prophets Jesus said that the
[1:04:04] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:04:07] now someone might say to me do you
[1:04:09] believe that that anointing on those
[1:04:10] people means that it's the anointing of
[1:04:12] the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy
[1:04:16] spirit of God upon a purpose on a person
[1:04:18] and yet they are
[1:04:22] false now listen close and see what he
[1:04:24] said and they shall show signs and
[1:04:26] wonders in so much that it would deceive
[1:04:28] the very elected if it were possible and
[1:04:30] they are anointed with the genuine Holy
[1:04:33] Spirit I know this sounds very foolish
[1:04:36] but we're going to take time and explain
[1:04:38] it by the word that that's absolutely
[1:04:41] thus saith the Lord the
[1:04:44] truth again in anointed ones at the end
[1:04:46] time he says the same holy spirit that
[1:04:48] anoints the church that gives them
[1:04:50] desire to save Souls that gives them
[1:04:52] power to perform Miracles it falls on
[1:04:54] the the unjust the same as the just the
[1:04:57] very same Spirit now you can't make it
[1:04:59] another way and understand Matthew 24:24
[1:05:02] he said there shall rise there shall
[1:05:04] rise false Christ false anointed ones
[1:05:06] Anointed with the genuine thing but be
[1:05:08] false Propet prophets of it false
[1:05:11] teachers of
[1:05:14] it
[1:05:16] amen it always comes down to the word
[1:05:20] test not not the spiritual manifest
[1:05:24] ation
[1:05:25] test but when it comes down to it it
[1:05:28] always comes down to the word test does
[1:05:30] it stay true to the word that's been
[1:05:32] delivered in this age amen will it
[1:05:35] accept the word that's been restored
[1:05:37] through a prophetic ministry will it
[1:05:39] accept it and yield to it and submit to
[1:05:41] it and allow this word to be its
[1:05:43] absolute amen it comes down to the word
[1:05:47] test and the Rapture he says but when it
[1:05:51] comes but when it comes to Oh Glory I
[1:05:53] got the anointing and it's the genuine
[1:05:56] anointing remember Caiaphas had it too
[1:05:58] and prophesied so did balam have it and
[1:06:00] prophesied brother benam said bam had
[1:06:02] the same Spirit on him that Moses had on
[1:06:04] him
[1:06:07] right but that don't have nothing to do
[1:06:10] with this inside unless that was God's
[1:06:13] seed he's Gene his Gene from the
[1:06:15] beginning predestinated you're finished
[1:06:19] amen I don't care how much you shout
[1:06:21] speak with tongues run shout that has
[1:06:23] nothing to do with with it a Cocker can
[1:06:25] count just as much as any rest of them
[1:06:27] I've seen heathens raise and shout and
[1:06:29] speak in tongues and drink blood out of
[1:06:31] a human skull and call on the devil any
[1:06:33] of them Sensations and things forget it
[1:06:35] it's your heart in that word and that's
[1:06:38] Christ bring in there and watch it make
[1:06:41] itself known just as it opens up like
[1:06:43] any other seed and declares itself for
[1:06:45] the age that it's living in amen what
[1:06:48] will it do that seed Gene of God that's
[1:06:50] placed in US amen that soul of God Amen
[1:06:53] it is pre predestinated for this end
[1:06:55] time hour meaning it's got to come in
[1:06:58] contact with the end time word because
[1:07:00] it is a match for the end time word
[1:07:02] those two come together then what does
[1:07:03] it do it opens itself up and begins to
[1:07:06] Bear the fruit what kind of fruit amen
[1:07:08] the fruit of the intime
[1:07:15] word
[1:07:16] amen so now you can see the baptism of
[1:07:20] the Holy
[1:07:22] Ghost I hope I can say a few things now
[1:07:28] amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:32] like water
[1:07:35] baptism you can go down a dry Center and
[1:07:37] come up a wet
[1:07:40] Center and be fully immersed in the
[1:07:42] water according to the word
[1:07:46] amen amen but if there's no repentance
[1:07:48] and conversion in the heart there's no
[1:07:51] repentance you just go down and come
[1:07:53] back the same
[1:07:56] condition the immersion in the Holy
[1:07:59] Ghost can be exactly the same way yeah
[1:08:03] and it can bring manifestations and
[1:08:06] Sensations and mighty works and
[1:08:09] prophesying and tongues and
[1:08:10] interpretations and anything that's
[1:08:12] available to any True Believer and any
[1:08:14] true gift and any true experience it can
[1:08:17] bring all of that and it's that
[1:08:19] immersion will immerse you in the Holy
[1:08:21] Ghost and you'll be immersed in the Holy
[1:08:23] Ghost a sinner a wrong seed and you'll
[1:08:26] remain a sinner a wrong
[1:08:31] seed but for the genuine child of God
[1:08:34] predestinated by God that immersion in
[1:08:36] the spirit of God whether it has
[1:08:39] sensation or
[1:08:42] not listen that immersion can have all
[1:08:46] kinds of
[1:08:47] Sensations but it's amazing when the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost will fall in a tangible way
[1:08:51] amongst the meeting it affects everybody
[1:08:54] some people get nervous and leave some
[1:08:56] people weep some people come to the
[1:08:57] altar some people it has all kinds of
[1:09:00] effects but not all of those effects are
[1:09:03] permanent
[1:09:04] effects right because it only affects
[1:09:07] the spiritual
[1:09:09] realm but on some it'll have a permanent
[1:09:14] effect and and though it's the same
[1:09:17] power of God falling there'll be many
[1:09:19] different reactions many different
[1:09:22] Sensations but the thing that we're
[1:09:24] looking for more than anything is that
[1:09:27] being submerged in his spirit will allow
[1:09:29] the spirit to penetrate and come in
[1:09:31] contact with the seed remember that seed
[1:09:34] is your soul it's in the soul and that
[1:09:37] seed in the soul is in the realm that
[1:09:39] has no
[1:09:42] sensation all of your Sensations are in
[1:09:45] the outer two Realms but the contact
[1:09:48] that brings the New Birth has no
[1:09:50] sensation in that realm it only has two
[1:09:52] things Faith or unbelief it doesn't have
[1:09:55] feelings it doesn't have emotion it
[1:09:56] doesn't have any of that so that's why
[1:09:58] when you're immersed you can have all
[1:10:00] kinds of feelings and emotions that's
[1:10:01] the second realm thing but the realm
[1:10:03] that's coming to the New Birth the
[1:10:05] contact in the seed is in the realm that
[1:10:08] has no
[1:10:10] sensation that's why you can have a new
[1:10:12] birth without sensation or it can
[1:10:14] accompany lots of Sensations but those
[1:10:16] Sensations many times is your spirit
[1:10:18] realm reacting to the presence of God
[1:10:21] Amen but the real birth is coming with
[1:10:23] without
[1:10:26] sensation just like the conception in
[1:10:28] Mary Mary had no
[1:10:31] sensation but the spirit amen brought
[1:10:34] forth a product in her wound without
[1:10:36] sensation so it can come with sensation
[1:10:39] and that's why brother bam said one of
[1:10:41] the Mysteries in this end time is the
[1:10:43] New Birth without the baptism the Holy
[1:10:44] Ghost a new birth without sensation it
[1:10:46] because it doesn't require a sensation
[1:10:49] although I say many times it may have a
[1:10:52] sensation cuz it's hard not to react in
[1:10:55] the spirit realm into the presence of
[1:10:56] God it can be dynamic and Powerful it
[1:10:58] can be subtle it can be like a light
[1:11:00] Breeze it can be like power falling upon
[1:11:03] you it affects all of us in a different
[1:11:05] way it could be so subtle that you
[1:11:07] didn't really recogn like you knew
[1:11:08] something happened but you didn't
[1:11:09] recognize that that was the baptism of
[1:11:11] the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost but what is it it's an immersion
[1:11:16] in the spirit yeah and that
[1:11:19] immersion is to bring contact with the
[1:11:23] light life of the word to the word in
[1:11:27] you and bring it to life that's the new
[1:11:30] birth that's why it's a
[1:11:35] seal now in the questions and answers on
[1:11:38] the Holy Ghost brother B preached the
[1:11:39] Holy Ghost Series in 1959 that I really
[1:11:42] enjoyed studying but he says this and
[1:11:44] now God is in US Jesus said in John 14
[1:11:47] in the day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:11:49] Father the father and me I in you and
[1:11:50] you and me God in us what was the
[1:11:55] purpose now we know God's in us we've
[1:11:57] been born again we've been quickened to
[1:12:00] life what's the
[1:12:02] purpose he says to carry out his
[1:12:05] plan what's the purpose of all of this
[1:12:08] why did I have a new birth why did I to
[1:12:10] carry out his
[1:12:12] plan not so I can for 20 years give a
[1:12:15] testimony of my new birth experience no
[1:12:17] my new birth experience amen was to put
[1:12:19] me in position to carry out the plan and
[1:12:21] will of God Amen am let's go to Acts
[1:12:25] chapter
[1:12:30] 1 I'm going to go a little bit longer if
[1:12:32] you can just hang with me I know it's
[1:12:35] Wednesday night and I know many people
[1:12:36] haven't been feeling good but praise be
[1:12:39] to God Amen I love the word of God it
[1:12:42] dissolves all doubt it ends all dispute
[1:12:45] it settles the questions it establishes
[1:12:47] is in the word of God unshakable and
[1:12:49] unmovable these are the things that we
[1:12:51] need to know we've been tossed here by
[1:12:54] preaching and tossed here by preaching
[1:12:56] in our traditional ideas and what we
[1:12:58] carried into the message but by the
[1:12:59] grace of God he's given us a firm
[1:13:01] foundation in the word of
[1:13:04] God Amen Acts
[1:13:08] 1:8 Jesus still speaking to the
[1:13:10] disciples after his resurrection he says
[1:13:13] but ye shall receive
[1:13:15] power oh praise God we want that
[1:13:18] power but we want to know what that
[1:13:20] power is to do I hear so many I I grew
[1:13:22] up in Pentecost we talked about the
[1:13:24] power you need the power the power and
[1:13:26] it was always the power to do a
[1:13:27] manifestation power to do a work power
[1:13:29] for raising the dead and all of that's
[1:13:31] Incorporated but what is this power
[1:13:33] supposed to do it's supposed to
[1:13:34] accomplish God's
[1:13:36] purpose he said but you shall also
[1:13:38] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] has come upon you and ye shall be
[1:13:42] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:13:45] in Judea and in Samaria and into the
[1:13:47] uttermost parts of the earth what is
[1:13:49] that power to do it's the power to make
[1:13:52] you a witness of
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:56] him that's what the power of the Holy
[1:13:59] Ghost is supposed to do make us a
[1:14:01] witness of him to accomplish his
[1:14:04] purpose he says in the message what was
[1:14:07] the Holy Ghost given for from 1959 if
[1:14:09] you feel the least tug don't turn it
[1:14:11] away what is the Holy Ghost God in you
[1:14:15] what is it
[1:14:16] for to continue his work among his
[1:14:19] people listen now he's going to he's
[1:14:21] going to keep carrying this on to the
[1:14:23] end now watch this what's the what is
[1:14:25] the Holy Ghost God in you what is it for
[1:14:28] to continue his work among his people to
[1:14:31] bring his church together to bring a
[1:14:33] church to a place in this day far beyond
[1:14:36] the Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal
[1:14:39] un a place to an
[1:14:41] adoption and a rapturing Grace amen
[1:14:45] what's this Holy Ghost is God in you
[1:14:46] what's it supposed to do to continue the
[1:14:49] work all the way to adoption and the
[1:14:51] rapturing grace
[1:14:55] that when this church this and when this
[1:14:57] part of the church the one we have right
[1:14:58] now when this part of the church when
[1:15:00] the spirit moves into this church here
[1:15:02] it'll
[1:15:03] raise oh praise God the power of God has
[1:15:07] raised us out of dark denominationalism
[1:15:10] brought us into darkness into light
[1:15:11] we've raised out of denomination raised
[1:15:13] out of out of Le Dean condition raised
[1:15:16] in the newness of life this church is
[1:15:18] raised by the power of God and it's got
[1:15:21] further more to raise
[1:15:25] when this church here it'll raise let's
[1:15:27] let's read this when the spirit moves
[1:15:29] into this church here it'll raise it'll
[1:15:31] just raise and it'll bring forth bring
[1:15:35] forth all of the redeemed that's touched
[1:15:38] that
[1:15:40] Spirit what is the spirit supposed to do
[1:15:42] in this age of this church supposed to
[1:15:44] go far beyond what the Lutheran far
[1:15:46] beyond what the methodists far Bey what
[1:15:47] the Pentecost but bring us to an
[1:15:49] adoption and to a rapturing Grace
[1:15:51] that'll actually raise the church and
[1:15:52] she goes goes up word by word and she
[1:15:54] goes all the way up until it actually
[1:15:57] brings with it the redeemed from all
[1:15:59] from the last 2,000 years that has
[1:16:01] touched that
[1:16:03] Spirit that's what the Holy Ghost was
[1:16:05] given for that's what it's supposed to
[1:16:07] be
[1:16:10] doing praise
[1:16:12] God it's an
[1:16:17] immersion it's an immersion
[1:16:20] friends it's an immersion that's
[1:16:22] supposed to to do
[1:16:24] something it's an immersion a dip a a a
[1:16:28] submerging in the very presence of God
[1:16:32] that quickens a predestinated seed to
[1:16:35] life am amen that changes
[1:16:39] us from what we were to Sons and
[1:16:42] Daughters of God Amen Born Again by the
[1:16:46] spirit of God seals us into the day of
[1:16:49] redemption and leads and guides us into
[1:16:52] all truth truth to accomplish his
[1:16:55] purpose and to keep fulfilling his word
[1:16:59] that's what it's for that's why it
[1:17:02] comes but you know it takes an immersion
[1:17:05] of baptism in the Holy Spirit to bring
[1:17:08] the quickening power to the seed to
[1:17:10] bring us to
[1:17:13] life and we notice as we looked as we
[1:17:16] preached as we talked we know that other
[1:17:19] individuals can be immersed in the
[1:17:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost but yet
[1:17:23] there's no seed there to Quicken but
[1:17:25] it's still an immersion a true immersion
[1:17:27] a true baptism in the Holy
[1:17:30] Ghost and it can have all kinds of
[1:17:32] manifestations and signs so there is an
[1:17:34] immersion that even non-elect can go
[1:17:39] through but I would like to end by just
[1:17:41] sharing this if the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:45] Ghost is an immersion or a dipping or
[1:17:48] submerging in the spirit of God I don't
[1:17:51] want just one
[1:17:57] I don't want just
[1:17:58] one we all have to have one to bring a
[1:18:01] new
[1:18:02] birth but I don't want just
[1:18:05] one and if a non-elect can have a
[1:18:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe I
[1:18:10] can have more than one immersion in the
[1:18:12] spirit of God I can have more than one
[1:18:14] time in my life amen that the presence
[1:18:16] of God envelops me amen and immerses me
[1:18:19] completely in his presence and I want
[1:18:22] more
[1:18:24] brother bandam goes on to say in 1953
[1:18:27] the me message the resurrection says
[1:18:28] what we need today is another refilling
[1:18:31] a filling another like the
[1:18:33] disciples some of you try to test an
[1:18:36] experience or trust it that they had 10
[1:18:38] years ago that's all right but what
[1:18:40] about today you need one today today is
[1:18:42] the day sure a filling the disciples
[1:18:45] about 3 or 4 days after they received
[1:18:47] the Holy Ghost went back and got in one
[1:18:49] Accord and began to pray again with one
[1:18:51] Accord until the Holy Ghost shook the
[1:18:52] building where they were sitting amen
[1:18:55] that's what we need I want to look at
[1:18:57] this in Acts if you can come with me to
[1:18:59] Acts chapter 4 now in Acts chapter 2 we
[1:19:03] see on the day of Pentecost was full
[1:19:05] come in that that they received the
[1:19:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost and what did
[1:19:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost do to them
[1:19:10] it sent them out onto the street and
[1:19:12] immediately they begin to preach the
[1:19:14] word to be a witness of Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ so then we go to Acts chapter 4
[1:19:24] 4 and then Acts chapter
[1:19:27] 3 we see Peter and John go to the temple
[1:19:30] to worship and they as they go through
[1:19:33] the gate beautiful they come by a lame
[1:19:34] man and the lame man amen he was lame
[1:19:37] from his birth and and they begin to
[1:19:39] tell him you know gold and silver have i
[1:19:41] n but such as I have I give to you in
[1:19:42] the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:19:44] walk and he went running and leaping
[1:19:45] into the temple and everybody begin to
[1:19:47] praise him and this concerned the temple
[1:19:49] guards and and the elders and they
[1:19:51] arrested them and they brought them in
[1:19:52] chapter 4 and in chapter 4 they bring
[1:19:55] him to arrest them they let him sit all
[1:19:57] night in jail they bring him to the
[1:19:58] council the next day amen and let's pick
[1:20:01] it up at verse
[1:20:04] 6 John chapter 4: 6 and Annis the high
[1:20:08] priest and Caiaphas and John and
[1:20:10] Alexander And as many as were of the
[1:20:12] Kindred of the high priest were gathered
[1:20:13] together at Jerusalem and when they had
[1:20:15] set them in the midst they asked by what
[1:20:18] power by what name have you done this
[1:20:21] then Peter filled with the Holy Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost all right listen Peter had been
[1:20:25] filled with the Holy Ghost a few days
[1:20:27] before in the upper room but we find
[1:20:30] Peter when he stands up he was filled
[1:20:32] with the Holy Ghost to do what to be a
[1:20:36] witness what did he do after he had the
[1:20:39] experience in the upper room was
[1:20:40] quickened alive sealed by the spirit
[1:20:42] full of the Holy Ghost he went out and
[1:20:43] then they had a great manifestation
[1:20:45] where everybody from all these nations
[1:20:47] heard them speaking in their own
[1:20:48] language it was a sign it got their
[1:20:50] attention when God got their attention
[1:20:52] and they they gathered around what was
[1:20:53] the next thing that happened P Peter
[1:20:56] filled with the Holy Ghost stood up and
[1:20:58] said there these men are not drunk as
[1:21:00] you suppose amen but this is that which
[1:21:02] the prophet Joel said this is the day
[1:21:04] this is the hour this is your sign amen
[1:21:06] what was he doing he was preaching the
[1:21:08] word with
[1:21:10] boldness why he had received power to be
[1:21:13] a witness before that he was
[1:21:17] hiding now they go to the temple they
[1:21:19] work another notable Miracle amen it
[1:21:22] didn't say he was filled with the Holy
[1:21:23] Ghost when he worked a miracle but it
[1:21:25] said he being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:26] gave an
[1:21:29] answer because that's what the power of
[1:21:31] the Holy Ghost was given for to be a
[1:21:37] witness and he
[1:21:38] says let's continue here verse eight
[1:21:42] then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:45] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[1:21:47] and Elders of Israel if we this day be
[1:21:49] examined of the good deed done to the
[1:21:51] impotent Man by what means he is is made
[1:21:52] whole be it known unto you all and to
[1:21:55] all the people of Israel by by the name
[1:21:57] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you
[1:21:59] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[1:22:01] even by him did this man stand here
[1:22:03] before you
[1:22:05] whole that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:07] in
[1:22:08] demonstration in a person's
[1:22:10] life he's not ashamed of the Gospel he's
[1:22:13] not afraid to give witness in the face
[1:22:15] of persecution standing in the
[1:22:19] council later they threaten him and he
[1:22:22] says is it you tell me is it better to
[1:22:24] obey God or
[1:22:26] man why cuz he was filled with the Holy
[1:22:29] Ghost now we find that they released
[1:22:32] them threatening finding no nothing else
[1:22:34] that they could do to them they run back
[1:22:36] to the company of the Saints they gather
[1:22:39] in with the Believers and they begin to
[1:22:40] tell them all that befell them and all
[1:22:42] that had happened to them and what was
[1:22:43] said to them and how they answered and
[1:22:45] and they they gave all this they gave
[1:22:47] all of these
[1:22:50] answers and I want to pick this up I I
[1:22:52] want to read it a little earlier when I
[1:22:53] was planning
[1:22:54] to let's pick it up in verse 23 let's
[1:22:57] read the whole thing in context acts 4
[1:23:00] ver
[1:23:01] 23 and being let go they went to their
[1:23:04] company and reported all that the chief
[1:23:05] priests and Elders had said unto them
[1:23:07] and when they heard that they lifted up
[1:23:09] their voice to God with one Accord and
[1:23:11] said Lord Thou Art God which has made
[1:23:13] Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all
[1:23:15] that is in that in them is who by the
[1:23:17] mouth of thy servant David has said why
[1:23:19] did the Heathen rage and the people
[1:23:21] imagine vain things the kings of the
[1:23:23] earth stood up and the rulers were
[1:23:24] gathered together against the Lord and
[1:23:26] against his Christ for of a truth
[1:23:28] against the holy Child Jesus whom thou
[1:23:30] has anointed hath Herod and pontious
[1:23:32] pilate and the Gentiles and the people
[1:23:34] of Israel were gathered together for to
[1:23:36] do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[1:23:39] determined before to be done and now

[1:23:45] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[1:23:47] they may speak the word so look what the
[1:23:49] request is God help us that with all
[1:23:53] boldness we can speak your word that's

[1:23:56] request by stretching forth thy hand to
[1:23:59] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[1:24:02] done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus
[1:24:05] and when they had prayed the place was
[1:24:07] shaken where they were assembled
[1:24:08] together and they were all filled with
[1:24:11] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[1:24:13] of God with
[1:24:18] boldness they were all filled with the
[1:24:20] Holy Ghost who was there Peter and John
