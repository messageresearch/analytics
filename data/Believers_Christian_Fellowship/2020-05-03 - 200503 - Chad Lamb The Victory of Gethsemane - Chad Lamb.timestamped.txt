[0:00] and i just want to
[0:10] [Applause]
[0:15] to be please in his presence
[0:20] found in his likeness
[0:30] i just want to please
[0:52] to hear him say well done
[1:10] please
[1:20] to hear him say well done
[1:27] praise the lord it's good to see you all
[1:30] especially
[1:31] those who haven't been here for a while
[1:33] does my heart good to see you all god
[1:34] bless you amen
[1:36] what a what a wonderful time to be
[1:38] together what a wonderful thing to do to
[1:40] come together and worship god together
[1:43] amen we love him for his steadfastness
[1:45] we love him for his faithfulness
[1:47] we love him for his keeping power
[1:49] because if it wasn't for him
[1:51] none of this would be possible he's the
[1:53] one who's kept us and brought us
[1:54] together and
[1:55] we thank him for that so say god bless
[1:58] you it's a good morning
[1:59] to serve the lord they're all good
[2:02] mornings to serve alone
[2:04] let's take our bibles while we're
[2:05] standing and turn to proverbs chapter
[2:07] 16.
[2:11] proverbs chapter 16. it's good to see
[2:14] all who were able to make it out and
[2:16] praise the lord it's wonderful to see
[2:19] everybody together
[2:22] may the lord just be magnified and
[2:24] glorified and lifted up
[2:26] and maybe just feast from his hand today
[2:29] amen
[2:30] may he be the one who speaks and may we
[2:32] just receive from him
[2:34] in this time let's look at uh
[2:37] proverbs 16 32
[2:41] proverbs 16 32 he that is slow to anger
[2:45] is better than the mighty
[2:47] and he that ruleth his spirit than he
[2:49] that taketh a city
[2:51] i just want to emphasize that he
[2:55] that ruleth his spirit is better than he
[2:57] that taketh the city
[2:59] now if you think about that he that
[3:01] slowed the anger is better than the
[3:02] mighty
[3:03] he that rules his spirit than he that
[3:04] taketh the city i mean it's most small
[3:06] small tasks to take a city we're
[3:09] thinking about the day in which they
[3:10] lived in
[3:11] maybe even a walled city or a city and a
[3:13] man is able to
[3:14] scale the wall and overthrow the city
[3:16] and all of its defenses in all of its
[3:18] military might but the one who can
[3:20] control his own spirit is better than
[3:22] that man
[3:23] so this isn't a small statement this is
[3:25] a major statement
[3:27] i mean praise god let's turn over to
[3:29] proverbs 25
[3:31] another verse of scripture
[3:35] proverbs 25 and verse
[3:39] 28 proverbs 25 and 28
[3:43] he that hath no rule over his own spirit
[3:45] is like a city that is broken down
[3:47] and without walls so if
[3:50] if a man can rule his own spirit he's
[3:52] better than one that the mighty and one
[3:54] that can take a city but man who can't
[3:55] rule his own spirit
[3:56] is like a wall like a city with no
[3:59] broken down with no walls no defenses
[4:01] you're overcome by everything and let's
[4:04] just bow our heads and ask the lord
[4:06] to bless us lord jesus we thank you we
[4:09] thank you god that we're able to gather
[4:10] in like this
[4:12] we're so thankful lord that our brothers
[4:14] and sisters are here
[4:15] this the older ones among us who've
[4:17] paved the way who have paid the price
[4:20] who have made sacrifices for the rest of
[4:22] this assembly
[4:23] we're so thankful they're here among us
[4:25] lord this morning
[4:27] what a blessing it is how it makes my
[4:29] heart lord warm to see them hear
[4:31] and know god that you've provided lord
[4:33] and you've used them
[4:35] as instruments in your hand to make a
[4:36] way for us and we're here together to
[4:39] worship your name to glorify you lord
[4:41] that you might be high and lifted up and
[4:43] we're here to feed from your hand lord
[4:45] things that we have need of in this hour
[4:47] we pray you would just speak to us lord
[4:49] and that you would lead and guide us
[4:51] into all truth for your name's sake
[4:53] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[4:56] you can all be seated man i just want to
[5:00] say it's been
[5:02] it's been a bit of a task to figure out
[5:05] how many we can fit and how to arrange
[5:07] the seats and all of these things and
[5:09] i just want to give a big thank you to
[5:10] the trustees and the deacons who have
[5:12] been working hard
[5:13] to make sure we're doing what we're
[5:15] supposed to do but we can get as many
[5:16] people together as possible
[5:18] and i thank them for that they're
[5:20] constantly looking and evaluating and
[5:22] after service is thinking about
[5:24] can we do this can we change that what
[5:25] can we do and i just want to say i
[5:27] appreciate them
[5:28] and then brother brian balog was here
[5:30] late last night setting up chairs in the
[5:32] fellowship hall
[5:33] just in case we needed room for overflow
[5:35] and he was here until 11
[5:36] something doing that so god bless these
[5:39] men amen we appreciate them and
[5:41] appreciate everyone who will step up and
[5:43] take their place and do what they can
[5:45] you know so we appreciate that
[5:47] i just want to say as we read these
[5:49] scriptures this was unusual this wasn't
[5:51] the direction i was intending to go
[5:53] in but i i had woke up uh yesterday
[5:56] morning i believe it was saturday
[5:57] morning
[5:58] and before i even opened my mind before
[6:00] i even opened my eyes that first
[6:02] scripture come to my mind
[6:04] you know he that ruleth his spirit is
[6:06] better than he that taketh the city
[6:08] which was strange i had first thought in
[6:10] my mind hadn't even opened my eyes yet
[6:12] there was no good morning there was no
[6:14] light to hit my eyes
[6:15] but i just come awake and that was there
[6:17] and then the next thought that god
[6:19] flooded into my mind
[6:21] was gethsemane and all of a sudden these
[6:23] two
[6:24] parts of scripture come together for
[6:26] gethsemane
[6:27] and this morning i'd like to preach on
[6:29] the victory of gethsemane
[6:31] the victory of death in gethsemane and
[6:34] just
[6:35] this reminds you i'll just read through
[6:36] these verses again before we move on it
[6:38] says he that is slow to anger is better
[6:40] than the mighty
[6:41] and he that ruleth his spirit than he
[6:43] that taketh a city
[6:45] proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule over
[6:48] his own spirit is like a city that is
[6:49] broken down
[6:50] and without walls so we want to talk
[6:53] about this in the context of gethsemane
[6:55] and brother branham says in the message
[6:57] desperations from 1963
[6:59] says our dear lord jesus himself and the
[7:01] world's greatest battleground
[7:03] gethsemane so he he brother branham
[7:06] when he starts talking about jesus in
[7:08] gethsemane he says this was the world's
[7:10] greatest battleground
[7:12] i mean it's amazing the way he looks at
[7:14] this and and he calls gethsemane the
[7:16] world's greatest battleground there was
[7:18] a battle taking place
[7:20] something was going on in gethsemane
[7:22] that was the world's greatest
[7:24] battleground
[7:25] amen something was taking place in
[7:27] gethsemane that affects you and i amen
[7:29] the the ability for us to be redeemed
[7:32] for the victory that we would have now
[7:34] amen there was something there was a
[7:35] victory taking place in the world's
[7:37] greatest battleground in gethsemane
[7:39] that has paved the way for you and i he
[7:42] said our dear lord jesus himself and the
[7:44] world's greatest battleground gethsemane
[7:46] he cried out in despair
[7:48] should he take the sins of the world or
[7:50] should he just remain on earth was
[7:51] his beloved disciples what he wanted to
[7:54] do
[7:55] so jesus is now in a battle
[7:58] but the the enemy he's in a battle with
[8:01] isn't so much a physical
[8:02] enemies in front of amen he's now
[8:05] battling his own will and his own
[8:06] desires
[8:07] will he amen will he take the path god
[8:10] has asked him to take
[8:11] or will he stay on earth with his
[8:13] disciples
[8:15] and this is amazing there's some things
[8:16] brother branham says and and don't ask
[8:18] me to explain it i can't explain it i
[8:20] don't understand
[8:21] but there's some things that brother
[8:23] branham says and he says jesus didn't
[8:25] have to go to calvary
[8:27] he chose to he wasn't forced but at some
[8:31] point
[8:31] he had to make a choice and he had to
[8:33] wrestle it out with himself in
[8:35] gethsemane
[8:36] knowing full well what he was facing
[8:38] knowing
[8:39] what was coming amen and he had to make
[8:41] a choice
[8:43] jesus christ had to make a choice and he
[8:45] made it in gethsemane
[8:47] would he die would he be brutally
[8:50] tortured
[8:50] would he be punished would he be
[8:51] separated or would he stay on earth with
[8:53] his disciples
[8:54] he could make that choice and i don't
[8:56] understand that
[8:57] we know god's got a plan from before the
[8:59] foundation of the world but he set it up
[9:01] on free moral agency and he had a choice
[9:03] he could go this path or he could go
[9:05] that path it was his choice
[9:09] amen would he would he
[9:12] should he take the sins of the world or
[9:14] should he just remain on earth with his
[9:16] beloved disciples what he wanted to do
[9:18] so brother man was telling us what he
[9:19] wanted as a human as a man
[9:22] there was a desire he wanted to stay
[9:24] with his disciples
[9:25] they didn't want to depart from his
[9:26] disciples he didn't want to be separated
[9:28] with them
[9:29] he wanted to stay with them but there
[9:31] was a greater desire than that desire
[9:34] and he wanted to please the father and
[9:36] so in gethsemane
[9:37] there's a war going on amen the war
[9:40] between the desire
[9:41] to stay with his disciples and the
[9:43] desire to please the father
[9:46] it's a great battleground name goes on
[9:49] to say
[9:50] but watch his humility as he humbled
[9:53] himself
[9:54] not my will but thine be done humbled
[9:57] himself to the word
[9:58] the promised word of the god of heaven
[10:02] amen let's look at gethsemane for a
[10:04] minute if we could turn to john 18.
[10:10] just we'll look at a few scriptures here
[10:13] concerning gethsemane and move on
[10:16] because the real thing that hits me with
[10:18] impact in all of this
[10:20] is that we have to have gethsemane
[10:23] we ourselves have to pass through the
[10:25] garden of gethsemane
[10:27] and and as i've been meditating on this
[10:30] and thinking about it
[10:31] over the last little while i've been
[10:33] thinking you know
[10:34] we we may not just have one gethsemane
[10:37] in our lives
[10:38] we may have many we may have several
[10:41] gethsemanes in our lives
[10:43] amen but but there's got to come a time
[10:45] to dying out where we die out where we
[10:47] wrestle it out when we take our way or
[10:49] we take god's way and we got to battle
[10:51] it out we got to wrestle it out
[10:52] amen we've got to come to that place
[10:54] amen but there's many times we come to
[10:56] new trials
[10:57] all the time new hardships new
[10:59] difficulties and we battle it out all
[11:01] over again
[11:02] what will i do with this will i run from
[11:04] this trial or will i walk right into it
[11:06] there's many times when we go into a
[11:08] trial when we make a decision to stand
[11:10] on the word amen there's many times that
[11:12] we have a choice amen
[11:14] we can take an easier road and nobody
[11:17] will know but
[11:18] us nobody will know that we chose an
[11:21] easier path
[11:22] amen but the one god's asking us is to
[11:24] take a stand amen and take a harder path
[11:26] and many times we could take an easier
[11:28] path and we've got to wrestle it out in
[11:30] our own gethsemane
[11:31] which way will we go because god is not
[11:34] in the habit of forcing he set this up
[11:36] on free moral agency
[11:38] now he looks in john 18 john 18 verse 1
[11:44] when i when i read i'll read this verse
[11:46] and then we'll talk about it when jesus
[11:47] had spoken these words he went forth
[11:49] with his disciples over the book
[11:51] sidron where where was a garden
[11:54] into which he entered and his disciples
[11:57] now in the other gospels in matthew and
[12:00] mark they named that garden gethsemane
[12:02] amen and luke that he said he goes into
[12:04] the garden and he and he plays out kind
[12:05] of what happens in the garden
[12:07] but john is always just a little
[12:08] different the book of john just
[12:11] always gives a little different insight
[12:13] amen it's always got something different
[12:15] and i always want to know what's
[12:16] different and why
[12:18] when i see that difference is why nobody
[12:20] else
[12:21] talked about the brook that he crossed
[12:22] nobody else named that he crossed the
[12:24] brook sidron
[12:25] nobody else talks about that they just
[12:27] talk about the garden and they talk
[12:28] about gethsemane
[12:30] so i looked up sidron and it's a greek
[12:33] word it's only used one time this is the
[12:35] only place
[12:36] that this word is used in the new
[12:38] testament and it means
[12:39] turbid it means turbid and i had to look
[12:43] that up because i have no idea what
[12:44] turbid means
[12:45] i don't even know if i'm pronouncing it
[12:46] right but it says
[12:48] not clear not clear or transparent
[12:52] because of stirred up sediment or the
[12:53] like clouded opaque
[12:55] obscure thick or dense
[12:58] as smoke or clouds and then getting down
[13:01] to the emotional side it says confused
[13:03] muddled disturbed and so when jesus was
[13:07] walking
[13:08] from the last supper at the last supper
[13:10] he makes a statement
[13:11] it says he was troubled amen and he and
[13:14] he testified
[13:15] and being troubled he testified one of
[13:17] you shall betray me
[13:19] so in the last supper he's with the he's
[13:22] with those that are dearest to him on
[13:24] earth
[13:24] and he's sharing a meal and he realizes
[13:26] amen this is the last he says i'll
[13:28] drink of the vine i'll eat of this no
[13:30] more will i drink of this till i drink
[13:32] it fresh with you and new with you in my
[13:34] father's kingdom
[13:34] he knows what's coming and he's at this
[13:37] time and he becomes
[13:38] troubled because there's going to be a
[13:39] betrayal and
[13:41] and he starts to move amen from that
[13:43] scene
[13:44] to change the scene and he's going to
[13:46] he's going to go to the garden of
[13:47] gethsemane
[13:48] but he's going to cross over a place
[13:51] called sidron he's going to cross over a
[13:53] place that's obscure
[13:54] it's muddled it's not clear amen and
[13:57] so many times we move into places that
[13:59] are obscure
[14:01] and unclear and muddled it's not super
[14:04] clear
[14:05] we're moving in places in our lives it's
[14:08] not like it's this or this
[14:09] it's we don't have a clue sometimes what
[14:11] choice to make it's unclear
[14:13] we don't even know what's happening to
[14:14] us or why it's happening we're moving
[14:16] through
[14:17] we've got to cross over amen this
[14:19] confused this model
[14:20] this unclear this cloudy place amen to
[14:24] move into the garden
[14:26] so now this is this is the path that
[14:28] he's walking and so we get it we get
[14:30] into the garden let's turn to matthew 26
[14:32] and read about that there
[14:38] matthew 26
[14:45] and 36 matthew 26 and 36
[14:54] then cometh jesus with them into a place
[14:56] called gethsemane
[14:58] and saith unto disciples sit ye here
[15:00] will i go
[15:01] and pray yonder many of us know but
[15:03] gethsemane means the oil press
[15:06] and it was a they believe a grove of of
[15:09] olive trees
[15:10] amen and we know that olive oil comes
[15:12] from olive trees but you have to press
[15:14] it out you have to squeeze it out to get
[15:15] the oil out
[15:16] and so gethsemane means oil press it
[15:19] says
[15:20] see ye here will i go and pray yonder
[15:22] and he took with him peter and the two
[15:24] sons of zebedee and began to be
[15:26] sorrowful
[15:27] and very heavy i just want you to focus
[15:30] on this verse for a minute
[15:32] he began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[15:36] you know brother ram does some unique
[15:38] things
[15:39] when he talks about jesus christ then
[15:42] and like i said just a few minutes ago i
[15:44] won't be able to explain all this i
[15:46] can't explain it but i believe it
[15:48] the prophet said it but he said he was
[15:51] completely man
[15:52] and he was completely god it was god
[15:56] had created a tabernacle for himself to
[15:58] live and he created a body
[15:59] and this was the son of god a virgin
[16:02] born a sinless body no hybridization no
[16:05] sin in this body
[16:06] but yet that body was every
[16:09] bit man every bit
[16:12] man but he was brother ben said the god
[16:15] man because he was completely god
[16:17] and he said he makes some statements
[16:19] about this then i i don't i'm not going
[16:21] to be able to explain it to you
[16:22] but when you read this scripture you can
[16:24] see the humanity
[16:25] and for this morning i'd like to just
[16:27] focus a little bit on the humanity of
[16:29] jesus christ
[16:30] because he's called our brother is that
[16:33] right
[16:34] he's called our brother amen he is our
[16:37] brother amen
[16:38] he was jesus christ in the form of flesh
[16:40] amen exactly like we're in the form of
[16:42] flesh only without hybridization
[16:44] without any sin but yet he had emotions
[16:47] he had feelings he
[16:48] he had different things that he had to
[16:50] experience as a man
[16:52] just like we experienced them as a man
[16:55] amen
[16:56] and and so it's important to recognize
[16:58] that in verse 37 he says and he took
[17:01] with him peter and the two sons of
[17:03] zebedee and began to be sorrowful
[17:05] and very heavy then saith he unto them
[17:09] my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto
[17:11] death
[17:12] carry ye here and watch with me
[17:15] and he went a little further and fell on
[17:17] his face and prayed saying oh father
[17:19] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[17:21] me
[17:22] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[17:25] wilt
[17:27] so when we look at this scripture you
[17:28] can see jesus is expressing his will
[17:32] he says father if it's possible let this
[17:35] cup pass from me
[17:37] but not my will he's saying that's what
[17:39] i want
[17:40] i want this cup to pass from me if
[17:42] there's another way
[17:44] amen and mark he says father you can do
[17:46] all things
[17:47] he prefaces it by saying father you can
[17:49] do all things amen you can do all things
[17:52] if you can let this pass for me let it
[17:53] pass
[17:54] but nevertheless not my will but thine
[17:56] and he's expressing
[17:58] that he has a will he has a will
[18:01] he has a desire he's sorrowful and very
[18:04] heavy
[18:04] and he wants to stay with his disciples
[18:06] and he's expressing his will
[18:08] lord if this cup can pass from me let it
[18:11] pass from me
[18:12] but if there's no other way then i want
[18:13] your will not my will
[18:17] so jesus was a man he was a man
[18:21] he was god he was the god man but he was
[18:23] a man
[18:25] and he's and he's struggling here
[18:28] so father if it'd be possible that this
[18:30] cup pass from me
[18:31] nevertheless not as i will but as thou
[18:33] will and he cometh unto his disciples
[18:36] and finding them asleep and saith unto
[18:37] peter
[18:38] what would you not watch with me one
[18:40] hour
[18:42] watch and pray that you enter not into
[18:44] temptation
[18:45] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[18:46] flesh is weak
[18:48] he went away again the second time and
[18:50] prayed saying o my father this cup may
[18:52] not pass away from me
[18:54] except i drink it thy will be done and
[18:57] he came and found them asleep again for
[18:59] their eyes were heavy
[19:00] and he left him and went away again and
[19:02] prayed the third time saying the same
[19:04] words
[19:05] then cometh he to his disciples and
[19:07] saith unto them sleep on now and take
[19:09] your
[19:10] rest behold the hours at hand and the
[19:12] son of man is betrayed into the hands of
[19:14] sinners
[19:15] rise let us be going behold he is at
[19:18] hand
[19:19] that doth betray me so we're looking at
[19:22] jesus
[19:23] agony and his suffering here
[19:26] in the garden of gethsemane if we can
[19:28] turn to luke
[19:30] 22 together i want to pick up one verse
[19:36] there
[19:39] luke 22
[19:43] and i want to read verse 44.
[19:52] 22 and 44 and being in agony
[19:55] he prayed more earnestly
[19:59] being in agony jesus christ
[20:03] was in agony this wasn't just
[20:07] a pretend trial just so you could see
[20:10] that there was a struggle at trial
[20:12] but he was really in agony
[20:16] and it says here he was being in agony
[20:18] he prayed more earnestly
[20:20] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[20:22] of blood falling down
[20:24] to the ground i've never been in that
[20:27] much agony have you
[20:30] he being in agony a real
[20:34] trial for the son of god not just
[20:37] pretend it wasn't a drama he wasn't
[20:40] dramatizing
[20:41] a trial he was in a trial he wasn't just
[20:44] it wasn't just going through the motion
[20:46] so we see he was agonizing as it was
[20:48] till
[20:49] sweat was as it were great drops of
[20:50] blood hitting the ground
[20:52] he was he was sorrowful and very heavy
[20:54] amen he was
[20:55] really struggling and he was struggling
[20:58] with his own will
[21:00] he was struggling with his own desire
[21:02] amen would i go god's way
[21:04] or or or is there another way and he's
[21:06] asking god three times is there another
[21:08] way
[21:09] is there another way is there another
[21:11] way because he wants there to be another
[21:13] way
[21:14] but he's willing if there's no other way
[21:16] then i'll go this way
[21:17] and that was the battle that he was
[21:19] facing brother brown says in the breach
[21:22] he says and john started crying because
[21:24] no one was worthy and no one
[21:26] could even look at the book oh it took a
[21:28] human being
[21:29] john wet because no one could do it and
[21:31] everything was lost
[21:33] and there came a voice from one of the
[21:34] elders standing in the midst of the four
[21:36] beasts and all the great host of heaven
[21:38] said
[21:38] don't weep john oh my the grace of god
[21:41] don't be
[21:42] don't be brokenhearted john don't weep
[21:45] for the lion of the tribe of judah the
[21:46] root and offspring of david
[21:48] he has prevailed prevail means wrestle
[21:51] with and
[21:51] overcome oh my in the garden of
[21:54] gethsemane when his blood dropped down
[21:56] out of his face he was overcoming the
[21:58] lion
[21:59] the root of the david was has prevailed
[22:01] has overcome
[22:03] this word vervail means to wrestle with
[22:05] and overcome
[22:06] what did he do in the garden of
[22:08] gethsemane he wrestled with and
[22:10] overcome but the question is what was he
[22:12] overcoming
[22:15] what was he overcoming we know that he
[22:17] had already taken the test
[22:19] in the in the wilderness amen after he
[22:21] was already
[22:22] filled with the holy ghost led of the
[22:23] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[22:25] by the devil
[22:26] and he already passed the test amen that
[22:28] they had failed in the garden of eden
[22:30] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[22:31] flesh the pride of life amen and he was
[22:34] tempted with all of these things
[22:35] and these were outside temptations satan
[22:38] placing a temptation on him
[22:40] to get him amen to lust and crave for
[22:43] the things of the flesh and the lust of
[22:45] the eyes and the pride of life
[22:46] and he passed everyone by the word he
[22:49] said it is written
[22:50] it is written it is written and get thee
[22:52] behind me satan he kept taking the word
[22:55] to defeat the temptation
[22:56] so he already had overcome the same kind
[22:59] of temptation that he fell by
[23:03] but now he's got to come to the garden
[23:05] of gethsemane to be tempted again
[23:07] this is amazing he's already passed
[23:09] through the wilderness temptation
[23:11] now he's in gethsemane there he overcome
[23:13] the devil he overcame
[23:14] temptation and then he overcame lust
[23:20] but now he's battling it out again but
[23:22] we have no
[23:23] dialogue with the devil
[23:27] in the garden again we have no dialogue
[23:29] with the devil
[23:31] we have a man wrestling with himself
[23:38] you know many of us have been through
[23:40] tests and been through trials
[23:41] and god brings us to places where you
[23:43] have to face things down by the word and
[23:45] there's something coming contrary to the
[23:46] word and we've got to bring the word to
[23:48] face it off
[23:49] and this thing's trying to get us to
[23:50] take the wrong path amen and we bring
[23:52] the word and bring the word and bring
[23:53] the word
[23:54] amen but there's some trials that are a
[23:56] little different than those trials
[23:58] and there's some trials that you face
[24:00] all alone because jesus friends did not
[24:02] even understand what he was going
[24:04] through
[24:05] he had nobody to stand with him he had
[24:07] nobody that would wait with him one hour
[24:11] and he's in agony he's in turmoil amen
[24:14] and he's not
[24:15] fighting an outside force he's fighting
[24:18] his
[24:18] own humanity
[24:23] and he's doing it all alone
[24:27] he's in the night how many times have
[24:29] you had a all by yourself
[24:31] in the night prayer meeting with god
[24:33] crying out to god
[24:34] in the in agony amen because there's
[24:36] something happening
[24:37] that we don't want to happen there's
[24:39] something we're going through that we
[24:41] don't want to go through
[24:42] there's something happening in our lives
[24:44] and we're saying father can i bypass
[24:46] father is there another way father can
[24:48] this cup pass from me
[24:51] and sometimes your closest friends don't
[24:54] understand what you're going through
[24:58] you can't call them up and pray for me
[24:59] because they don't understand it
[25:01] it doesn't make sense to them it's your
[25:03] own private
[25:04] trial it's your own private gethsemane
[25:08] there's times if you're married there's
[25:10] times your spouse will not understand
[25:13] what you're going through right there
[25:16] and it can be so discouraging but god
[25:17] set it up that way
[25:19] because he wants you he doesn't want the
[25:22] group amen he wants
[25:23] you and jesus is now
[25:27] he's struggling amen this is what he's
[25:30] he's not struggling with an attack on
[25:32] the word
[25:35] he's not struggling with a false
[25:38] interpretation of the word
[25:40] he's not struggling with a temptation
[25:43] to get him to lust and leave the word to
[25:45] take something else
[25:47] he's struggling with himself
[25:53] and when does he do this at the end of
[25:56] his ministry
[25:57] after he's grown after he's matured
[26:00] after he's increased
[26:01] in wisdom and underground wisdom and
[26:03] understanding and knowledge of god
[26:04] after all of this after he's been tested
[26:07] already after he's been tried
[26:09] after god's used him to manifest after
[26:11] all of that
[26:12] he comes to a gethsemane where now he's
[26:15] not wrestling
[26:16] with the devil he's wrestling with
[26:18] himself
[26:22] praise me to god things are getting more
[26:25] intense
[26:28] and they're going to continue to get
[26:29] more intense
[26:31] but i got a feeling we're all going to
[26:33] have gethsemanes to face
[26:35] we've had gethsemanes and we're going to
[26:37] half gethsemanes
[26:38] and jesus was so pressed in the oil
[26:41] press in gethsemane
[26:43] under that agony under that pressure
[26:45] under that press
[26:46] until it was pressing the blood out a
[26:49] sweat
[26:50] from his brow brother bam said he was
[26:53] under such distress
[26:54] amen the blood began to separate in his
[26:57] veins
[26:58] don't know even what that means but it
[27:00] began to pour it began to drop
[27:02] out of sweat from his brow his blood he
[27:04] was under so much press
[27:06] because the gethsemane is the oil
[27:07] pressed and brother bam said the blood
[27:09] represents the life
[27:10] amen and under that press what was
[27:12] happening the life was coming out
[27:15] he was pressed until the blood began to
[27:17] come out of sweat
[27:18] amen what was squeezing the life out it
[27:21] was the agony
[27:22] it was the it was the it was the the
[27:24] heaviness it was the sorrow that he was
[27:27] facing
[27:27] and when he was battling with himself
[27:29] and everything was clamping down on him
[27:31] it was bringing out the life
[27:34] and how do you get the fragrance out of
[27:36] a rose
[27:38] brother ram said you crush it and when
[27:41] you begin to crush it when you put the
[27:42] squeeze on it
[27:44] amen amen that thing that's trapped on
[27:46] the inside
[27:47] that somebody wants is a sweet perfume
[27:50] amen's got to be
[27:51] crushed amen to get the fragrance out
[27:53] not because there's no love for the rose
[27:55] but because they know that the rose is
[27:57] holding a fragrance
[27:59] and god knows that his bride each
[28:01] individual is holding within yourself
[28:03] a fragrance amen and he wants that sweet
[28:06] smelling savor
[28:07] amen and he's willing to put it into
[28:09] gethsemane to the press
[28:11] amen and under agony and under heaviness
[28:14] amen you have to say if god loves us he
[28:16] won't put us there he put his son there
[28:18] his only begotten son he stuck him right
[28:21] there not because he didn't love him but
[28:23] because he did love him and he trusted
[28:24] in him he had confidence in him
[28:28] he didn't put him there in the beginning
[28:29] of his ministry he didn't put him there
[28:30] as a 12 year old boy
[28:32] he didn't put him there when he started
[28:33] in the wedding in cana he put him there
[28:35] after he'd been tested
[28:36] tried proved stood on the word manifest
[28:39] the word
[28:40] and after that he put him in gethsemane
[28:44] and sometimes we think we get it all
[28:46] backwards we thought i mean we'll
[28:47] overcome the hard stuff now and then we
[28:49] move into the christian retirement plan
[28:53] you make all the investments up front
[28:55] you make the hard decisions you throw
[28:57] out the shorts and you quit cutting your
[28:59] hair and throw the makeup away
[29:00] and cut the cord through the cable tv
[29:02] and man have i
[29:04] sacrificed have i given up my life for
[29:08] the lord
[29:10] amen but that's exactly how you feel
[29:13] i've given it all up i fully surrendered
[29:16] amen
[29:16] and that was you just fighting amen with
[29:19] the attributes of unbelief
[29:22] that was just fighting with the
[29:23] attributes of unbelief
[29:25] and overcoming them by the word and
[29:27] kicking them out
[29:28] and having victory amen but that was
[29:30] just the beginning friends
[29:32] that's not what he i mean he that's not
[29:34] to the place he wants us yet
[29:35] he wants us to the place of full
[29:37] surrender so he can have full
[29:38] preeminence
[29:39] amen until we're willing to go by
[29:42] ourselves where
[29:43] nobody on this earth understands our
[29:45] misery and our sorrow
[29:47] and our trouble amen and there's no
[29:49] other place to go
[29:50] and it's dark and we've already crossed
[29:52] over the cloudiness and
[29:54] the muddled confusion and then we've
[29:56] come into a garden
[29:57] and now he's seemingly squeezing
[30:00] everything out of us
[30:03] what's he doing he's proving he's got
[30:05] confidence in you
[30:07] and he's showing that there's a life in
[30:09] there that can come out
[30:14] amen not in the beginning but at the end
[30:20] this bride has walked with the lord and
[30:22] she's grown amen she's learned
[30:24] she's endured she's taken the word amen
[30:27] but it wasn't the beginning
[30:28] it was the end of his ministry
[30:33] it was after he had overcome after he
[30:36] had accomplished
[30:37] what god had wanted the comments after
[30:39] he had manifest
[30:40] the god of heaven after he had stood on
[30:43] the word
[30:44] after all of that then he leads him to
[30:48] gethsemane
[30:51] brother bam says in the rising of the
[30:54] sun
[30:56] now notice this quickening power zoe
[30:58] bringing the word the mind
[31:00] that was in christ was in you then i'm
[31:02] trying to show you
[31:03] that when you when you raised when god
[31:06] raised jesus from the dead he raised up
[31:08] you
[31:08] also and also quickened to life with him
[31:11] you are now quicker to life though then
[31:13] you were but an attribute in his
[31:15] thoughts but god
[31:16] had saw all in him at the finish see
[31:18] when god looked down upon the body
[31:21] the spirit of him the spirit left him
[31:24] in the garden of gethsemane i'll just
[31:27] tell you
[31:28] i don't know how that works i can't
[31:31] i can't compute all that but i believe
[31:33] it another place in nicest ways said the
[31:35] anointing left him
[31:37] in the garden of gethsemane amen so now
[31:39] he's in the garden of gethsemane
[31:41] and something has lifted off of jesus
[31:43] christ
[31:44] something where he felt the presence of
[31:46] the lord where he had the anointing amen
[31:48] and that is now gone and now he's
[31:51] wrestling
[31:52] out his humanity
[31:55] the spirit left him in the garden of
[31:56] gethsemane he had to die a man remember
[31:59] friends he didn't
[32:00] have to do that that was god god
[32:02] anointed that flesh which was human
[32:04] flesh
[32:05] if he'd have went up there as god he'd
[32:07] never died that kind of death can't kill
[32:09] god
[32:10] but he did have to do it so he had to
[32:12] die as a man
[32:15] as a man amen and that man was the flesh
[32:19] man of god
[32:20] it was god who was nailed to the cross
[32:21] but as a man
[32:23] not as a supernatural being but as a man
[32:26] he was nailed to that cross
[32:28] and as a man he was wrestling it out in
[32:30] gethsemane
[32:32] i want to if we could go back to matthew
[32:35] i want to slow down just a minute and go
[32:36] back to matthew
[32:37] chapter 4. if i'm not careful i'll just
[32:40] fly
[32:42] and i just want to take a little bit of
[32:43] time
[32:46] and just share this as it's been laying
[32:48] in my heart
[32:53] i feel like each week i get more
[32:56] inadequate to preach
[32:58] because god's dealing in a way that
[33:02] like laying in the bed before my eyes
[33:03] were open these thoughts come
[33:05] and i don't really know quite clearly
[33:07] what to do with them
[33:08] but i know it's god and i know it's
[33:10] something to preach and
[33:11] and then all of a sudden there's like a
[33:14] knowing in my heart i know what this
[33:16] means
[33:16] but i don't know how to explain it like
[33:19] i know
[33:20] i know what he's saying but i don't know
[33:22] how to say it
[33:24] and i don't know if that makes any sense
[33:25] to you or not but but there's
[33:27] something he's doing amen before i'm
[33:29] fully away and there's a knowing that
[33:31] comes with it
[33:32] but how to explain what he's dropped in
[33:34] the unspoken part
[33:35] i don't know how to explain it friends
[33:37] but i'm trusting that same one can drop
[33:39] the unspoken part in your heart this
[33:41] morning
[33:42] that you can catch amen what it is god
[33:44] wants us to catch in this hour
[33:46] amen this is deeper amen than just
[33:48] preaching
[33:50] what i'm trying to talk about is much
[33:52] deeper
[33:53] than preaching a sermon it's much deeper
[33:55] than sitting in a service amen it's much
[33:57] deeper than spending an hour and a half
[33:59] or two hours in the anointed preaching
[34:00] of the word
[34:01] it's deeper than that this is heart
[34:03] surgery amen
[34:04] where god is the one wielding the
[34:06] scalpel and he's the only one that knows
[34:08] how to cut you where you need to be cut
[34:12] and when he cuts he cuts exactly to the
[34:15] spot where the problem is
[34:18] remember you know we talked about uh
[34:20] wednesday the rich young ruler when he
[34:22] come to jesus he said what must i do to
[34:23] inherit eternal life
[34:25] he said you know the commandments keep
[34:26] this and keep that and do that he said
[34:28] all of these have i kept from my youth
[34:30] up
[34:30] and jesus the master heart surgeon amen
[34:33] he looks at him says one thing now lack
[34:35] us
[34:37] oh you know what that cut where nobody
[34:40] else could cut
[34:42] what jesus just said to him cut him so
[34:45] deep
[34:45] into the exact spot that needed to be
[34:48] cut out but he wouldn't stay
[34:50] under the scalpel of the master surgeon
[34:52] to have that thing cut out of him so
[34:54] that he could go free
[34:57] jesus offered him freedom and to the
[34:58] rich young ruler it looked like
[35:00] it looked like a burden it looked like
[35:01] bondage
[35:03] sell all that they have and follow after
[35:05] me
[35:07] sell all that i have and give to the
[35:08] poor and and
[35:10] see and before he said that after he
[35:13] said you know keep these commandments
[35:14] and do this and do that
[35:16] and he says all that i've done he says
[35:17] jesus looking at him loved him
[35:20] loved him and because he loved him
[35:23] he took his knife and he cut into the
[35:26] part of the heart
[35:27] amen that needed to be exposed and
[35:29] needed to be cut out
[35:31] that's his love amen and we get the
[35:34] wrong idea of god's love that somehow
[35:36] god's loving you know he's always going
[35:37] to make it nice and we're always going
[35:39] to have a good time and we're going to
[35:40] be surrounded by friends and have a lot
[35:41] of good time
[35:42] we're always going to have an exciting
[35:44] service that's not always the expression
[35:46] of his love but when he was expressing
[35:48] his love
[35:48] to that that young man amen he cut him
[35:51] deep
[35:52] and he cut him personal and he cut him
[35:55] he cut him in a place
[35:57] amen that his rabbi didn't know about
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:01] he cut him in a place that his mom and
[36:03] dad may not have known about
[36:04] but he got him in the spot that was
[36:06] holding him back he got him in the spot
[36:08] that was keeping him from fully being
[36:10] free
[36:10] amen with the things of god and god
[36:13] knows how to do that to us
[36:14] friends and that's his love expressed
[36:17] but he'll let a trial come and let
[36:18] hardship come
[36:19] he'll let something come and he'll cut
[36:21] you in the only he's the only one who
[36:23] knows that that's where it's at
[36:25] [Applause]
[36:27] i said before nobody can cut deep like
[36:30] god can cut deep
[36:34] and it makes you feel like you're dying
[36:37] i mean you feel like god you're killing
[36:40] me
[36:41] that means ever had that thought you're
[36:44] you're in a trial god's doing something
[36:45] there's no way around it you can't do
[36:47] anything about it it's just happening
[36:49] and you're saying god you are killing me
[36:52] you are literally
[36:53] killing me any and i could just see i
[36:55] mean
[36:56] just let me be fictitious for a moment
[36:58] dramatized he could say
[36:59] that's the point that's the point
[37:04] he's trying to get us to willfully die
[37:07] he's trying to get us to willfully
[37:09] surrender
[37:10] and willfully die and we keep wanting to
[37:13] live
[37:14] and he wants us to die
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:17] amen we want we want
[37:20] blessings and he has no problem getting
[37:22] blessings but we want blessings because
[37:24] blessings feel good
[37:25] amen he wants us to die so that the
[37:28] blessings can mean something
[37:30] [Applause]
[37:31] because blessings with no death are
[37:34] meaningless how many people in jesus
[37:37] ministry got the blessings
[37:40] but it meant nothing at the end of the
[37:43] day it meant nothing their soul was lost
[37:45] the blessings meant nothing god wants
[37:47] something more than to bless
[37:48] us amen he'll bless us no no doubt about
[37:51] it
[37:51] there's blessings coming in the new
[37:53] heavens and new earth there's blessings
[37:54] coming in the millennium
[37:56] there's lots of blessings coming but
[37:57] there's something he wants
[37:59] first and that's all of you
[38:04] what did jesus want he wanted all of
[38:06] that rich young ruler
[38:09] a hundred percent but jesus didn't want
[38:12] a hundred percent for any selfish reason
[38:15] because when jesus got a hundred percent
[38:18] that was
[38:19] freedom for the rich young ruler
[38:25] see freedom from bondage
[38:29] freedom from bondage was going to
[38:30] require a sacrifice on the part of the
[38:32] one going free
[38:35] and he didn't want to pay the price he
[38:38] didn't want to pay the price
[38:40] let's look at matthew 4 have we read
[38:42] matthew 4 yet
[38:44] we haven't read it praise the lord
[38:48] matthew 4 1
[38:51] then was jesus led up to the spirit into
[38:53] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[38:54] devil
[38:55] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[38:57] nights he was afterward
[38:59] a hungered
[39:03] so here jesus is on a 40-day fast
[39:08] and it says after his fast he was hungry
[39:11] mother said during a fast you're not
[39:13] hungry if god puts a fast on you you're
[39:14] not even hungry
[39:15] but after his fast after 40 days fast he
[39:17] was hungry
[39:18] and so the devil comes to him and starts
[39:20] tempting him with his hunger
[39:21] says turn these stones into into bread
[39:25] but let's turn over to luke want to look
[39:28] at another scripture
[39:28] and there's something i want to draw out
[39:30] of these
[39:33] luke 4
[39:36] and 13.
[39:43] luke 4 and 13. and when the devil had
[39:47] ended all the temptation he departed
[39:49] from him for a season
[39:51] and jesus returned in the power of the
[39:52] spirit unto galilee and there
[39:54] went out a fame of him through all the
[39:56] region round about
[39:58] and he taught in their synagogues being
[40:00] glorified of all
[40:03] so in this initial test in this initial
[40:06] trial
[40:08] he was weak in the flesh we agree
[40:13] he was weak in the flesh but he come out
[40:16] of it strong in the spirit
[40:19] we read that jesus returning in the
[40:21] power of the spirit
[40:23] into galilee and there went out of fame
[40:25] of him through all the region why was
[40:27] there so much fame because of the
[40:28] demonstrations of the spirit
[40:30] he was strong in the spirit through all
[40:32] the region round about
[40:34] and he taught in their synagogues being
[40:35] glorified of all oh he was
[40:38] he was teaching he was being glorified
[40:40] at all a fame was going out he went up
[40:42] strong in the spirit
[40:43] he was weak in the flesh and his
[40:44] temptation but he was strong in the
[40:46] spirit
[40:48] but when we get to gethsemane brother
[40:50] branham says the spirit leaves him in
[40:52] gethsemane
[40:54] and he had just eaten with his disciples
[40:59] so now he's not weak in the flesh
[41:02] he's weak in the spirit this is a
[41:06] totally different kind of trial
[41:08] there he's strong in the spirit weak in
[41:10] the flesh amen and he overcomes
[41:12] the temptations to the flesh by the word
[41:14] hey but now
[41:15] he's going he just ate a meal with his
[41:18] disciples
[41:19] now he's going into the garden to pray
[41:21] he's not weak in the flesh it's not a
[41:23] 40-day fast
[41:24] amen he's got he's got friends that were
[41:26] there they were fellowshipping together
[41:28] amen he's not weak in the flesh now the
[41:30] spirit of god departs from
[41:32] gethsemane and he's weak in the spirit
[41:35] and now weak in the spirit god is
[41:38] making him face the most difficult
[41:40] challenge of his life
[41:43] amen it's not always those times amen
[41:46] it's not
[41:46] going to be a camp meeting that wins the
[41:48] day
[41:50] and i have nothing against them because
[41:52] i love them i enjoy them i thoroughly
[41:54] enjoy them
[41:54] but that's not the time amen those are
[41:57] times to be strengthened in the spirit
[41:58] and be encouraged in the spirit amen and
[42:00] walk out of there strong in the spirit
[42:02] amen but it's those times all alone amen
[42:06] when nobody understands and you and god
[42:09] will
[42:10] won't speak to you when you can't get an
[42:13] answer and you know brother branham said
[42:14] like a black sheep
[42:16] it was like a black sheep coming down
[42:17] like you wouldn't even hear my prayer
[42:19] amen not the spiritual high but the
[42:21] spiritual low
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:25] how can something good be happening in a
[42:27] spiritual low look at gethsemane
[42:31] god wasn't there to encourage him
[42:35] he wasn't feeling anything
[42:39] do we understand he didn't have a
[42:42] he didn't have a feeling he couldn't
[42:43] feel the presence of the lord
[42:46] he didn't have a warm feeling in his
[42:48] heart
[42:49] amen he didn't have that connected
[42:51] feeling when you pray
[42:53] you feel like god you just connected
[42:55] with god he
[42:56] he wasn't feeling those things amen but
[42:59] yet god wanted it that way because he
[43:02] had to
[43:03] overcome himself
[43:06] he had to have the victory over his own
[43:10] humanity
[43:12] so this this trial was different than
[43:15] the first one
[43:18] and there's all kinds of trials
[43:21] but there's some trials that are
[43:22] different
[43:24] there's some things god asks sometimes
[43:27] as you think
[43:28] how could he ask such a thing how
[43:32] how could it be like this
[43:36] how could it be that a friend in the
[43:38] world won't stand with me
[43:41] it's not his disciples didn't love him
[43:43] they loved him
[43:45] but he had to do this by himself
[43:48] it wasn't that they did if they had
[43:50] understood
[43:51] if they had comprehended if they had
[43:53] just known amen they would have stayed
[43:55] right with him
[43:57] but god allowed him to not know and he
[43:59] allowed him to be heavy in the eyes
[44:03] so he had nobody to pray with him he had
[44:05] to pray alone
[44:08] and the spirit of god departed him
[44:10] brother bennett said in conference he
[44:12] said
[44:12] here he was standing in gethsemane that
[44:15] great suffering the sin of
[44:16] every man was upon him everything that
[44:18] ever died the death of that
[44:20] was placed upon him and he was innocent
[44:23] but he had to become sin
[44:25] can you the holy son of god take the sin
[44:27] of adultery can you take the sin the
[44:29] punishment of adultery
[44:31] can you take the sin the punishment of a
[44:32] lie can you take the sin of all these
[44:35] things can you bear them upon yourself
[44:37] yet innocent he was the only one the
[44:40] conference was met
[44:41] what did he say not my will thine be
[44:44] done
[44:45] oh god can we all hit a gethsemane
[44:49] conference that
[44:50] final checkup brother said can we all
[44:54] hit a gethsemane conference he was
[44:56] talking about there's been many
[44:57] conferences he had a conference with
[44:58] abraham at a conference with noah but
[45:00] can we hit the gethsemane conference
[45:02] that final checkup jesus
[45:05] was not going to suffer because of what
[45:08] he did wrong
[45:10] he was not asked to suffer because of
[45:13] his
[45:13] error he was not asked to suffer because
[45:15] of his sin he was not asked to suffer
[45:17] because of his unbelief
[45:18] he was asked to suffer for others
[45:23] he was innocent and brother said he
[45:26] didn't have to
[45:28] but he chose to
[45:32] i'm going to look for a minute at the
[45:34] humanity of jesus just so we could
[45:36] understand
[45:37] that he is our brother literally
[45:40] he's our brother
[45:43] he says in the message when their eyes
[45:45] were open they knew him he said
[45:47] she said in saint john the 11th chapter
[45:49] said the bible said
[45:50] when jesus went to the grave of lazarus
[45:52] he wept i said sure
[45:53] he's having a debate with a woman who
[45:55] says he wasn't divine
[45:56] i said sure she said well how could he
[45:59] how could he weep being divine
[46:01] i said well you just fail to see what he
[46:02] was when he went to the grave weeping
[46:05] he was a man but when he pulled his
[46:07] little shoulders together said lazarus
[46:09] come forth and a man that had been dead
[46:10] four days come up out of the grave
[46:12] that was more than a man that was god
[46:15] and a man see right he was a man when he
[46:19] came down off a mountain
[46:20] off the mountain was hungry and looked
[46:22] for god on a for food on a tree
[46:24] he cursed the tree because it had no
[46:26] food he was a man when he was hungry
[46:28] but when he took five biscuits and two
[46:30] fish and fed five thousand
[46:31] and take up seven basketballs that was
[46:33] more than a man
[46:35] that was god in a man and god only
[46:38] represents himself in man he choose man
[46:41] when he was laying out there on the boat
[46:43] that night where virtue went out of him
[46:45] all day preaching and people pulling
[46:47] after him
[46:47] discerning they would discerning and so
[46:51] forth and the storm upon the sea
[46:52] i guess ten thousand devils swore they
[46:54] would drown him that night
[46:56] when he was laying back there asleep on
[46:58] the back of the boat them flopping
[46:59] around like a bottle stopper out there
[47:01] on the mighty sea somewhere
[47:02] he was a man when he was tired laying
[47:04] there sleeping that night
[47:06] but when he was once aroused put his
[47:08] foot on the braille of the boat looked
[47:09] up and said peace be still
[47:11] that was more than a man there yet that
[47:13] was god in a man
[47:16] he was a man when he died on the cross
[47:18] crying for mercy he was a man
[47:20] but when he broke the seals of death
[47:21] hell in the grave and rose up on the
[47:23] third day
[47:24] he proved he was more than a man it was
[47:27] god and a man
[47:28] no wonder every man that's ever amounted
[47:30] to anything believed that all poets and
[47:32] everything that's ever amounted to
[47:33] anything
[47:34] believe that that's right he was more
[47:36] than a man he was god
[47:38] do we believe that now
[47:41] that we we look at that and we
[47:43] understand that there was there was two
[47:45] parts there was
[47:46] a man and he was completely man that's
[47:48] what brother brother said
[47:49] and completely gone he said here in the
[47:53] message
[47:53] come follow me from 1963 and jesus was
[47:56] the transmitter of god's word
[47:57] for he was the triunity of god manifest
[48:00] in one man
[48:01] he was complete god and complete man
[48:05] complete god and complete man
[48:09] and it's interesting to me that we can
[48:11] look at that and say amen
[48:14] but that pattern continues today
[48:18] that pattern continues today the only
[48:21] difference was
[48:22] that was everything poured into one man
[48:25] and that one man was born without sin
[48:28] come virgin birth but the same pattern
[48:31] is laid out because
[48:32] all that was poor was god was poured
[48:34] into christ all that was in christ was
[48:36] poured into his church
[48:39] and the pattern continues
[48:42] and we have to catch the continuation of
[48:44] the pattern
[48:47] and let's go to john 11 the gospel of
[48:49] john
[48:51] chapter 11.
[49:01] john 11 and let's go to verse 32.
[49:09] he's come to the grave of uh he's coming
[49:11] to the grave of lazarus
[49:13] of lazarus knowing that he was dead it
[49:15] says then when mary was come
[49:16] where jesus was and saw him she fell
[49:19] down on his feet saying unto him lord
[49:21] if thou had been here my brother had not
[49:23] died when jesus therefore saw her
[49:25] weeping and the jews also weeping which
[49:27] came with her
[49:28] he groaned in the spirit and was
[49:31] troubled
[49:33] you see have you ever groaned in the
[49:35] spirit
[49:36] have you ever been troubled jesus was
[49:40] too
[49:41] he was complete man and complete god
[49:45] you know god was one who knows all
[49:47] things and has all things in control
[49:49] and everything's ticking just right on
[49:51] time but there's the man side
[49:53] that is going through the emotions of it
[49:55] all as well
[49:58] he he groaned he groaned
[50:02] in the spirit and was troubled and said
[50:05] where have you laid him
[50:06] they said in him lord come and see jesus
[50:09] wept then said the jews behold how he
[50:12] loved him
[50:13] and some of them said could not this man
[50:15] which opened the eyes of the blind have
[50:17] caused the
[50:17] even this man should have not died jesus
[50:20] therefore again
[50:21] groaned in himself coming to the grave
[50:24] so jesus
[50:26] it wasn't like amen being a god man that
[50:29] he could just skip up to the grave and
[50:31] say we're going to
[50:31] raise lazarus from the dead today and it
[50:34] it wasn't like that
[50:35] amen he was going through all the
[50:37] emotions that went with it amen
[50:39] he saw the suffering of the people and
[50:41] then he saw how
[50:42] mary wept how the jews went he disturbed
[50:45] him in his spirit
[50:47] it disturbed him in his spirit it
[50:50] groaned
[50:50] it troubled him when he when he knew
[50:52] that he was going to be deceived in the
[50:54] last supper he said he was troubled in
[50:56] spirit
[50:58] when he come to gethsemane he was
[51:00] sorrowful and very heavy
[51:03] praise the lord that shows there's
[51:06] nothing wrong with that when it happens
[51:08] to you
[51:10] that's part of the journey that's part
[51:12] of overcoming
[51:13] that's part of gethsemane
[51:18] he groaned he was troubled
[51:22] over being portrayed betrayed
[51:25] he called he called judas a friend
[51:30] he washed his feet knowing that friend
[51:33] would betray him
[51:34] and when he when he when he after he had
[51:37] washed her feet he sat down and
[51:39] and he was troubled in his spirit
[51:42] and he testified to him and said one
[51:45] among us will betray me
[51:48] you know the man's side
[51:51] wasn't enjoying it the man's side
[51:55] was suffering was troubled a man
[51:59] that had been a friend for all those
[52:01] years in the ministry
[52:03] they had ate together talked together no
[52:05] doubt had laughed together brother
[52:07] benham said jesus had a sense of humor
[52:11] he didn't like it but yet he surrendered
[52:14] to it
[52:15] it says in the message a prisoner from
[52:17] 1963 said
[52:18] now we're all born a free moral agent to
[52:21] make any decision that we wish to
[52:24] god justly does that because he put
[52:27] he must put every man on the same basis
[52:29] or he put the wrong man on
[52:31] he put the first man on the wrong bases
[52:33] that he put on a free moral agency see
[52:35] we're just exactly tonight like adam and
[52:37] eve there's no difference
[52:39] right and wrong sets before either one
[52:40] of us life and death
[52:42] we can make our choice up to you to make
[52:44] it
[52:45] what's interesting is this is where
[52:46] jesus was in gethsemane
[52:49] he couldn't make a choice i don't
[52:51] understand that
[52:52] don't don't don't come to me afterwards
[52:54] say brother chad how did that work with
[52:56] you know the perfect plan of god
[52:57] i have no idea but brother said he could
[52:59] make a choice
[53:01] he could stay with his disciples he
[53:02] could make a choice amen but he had to
[53:04] wrestle it out to make the choice
[53:06] that's the that's the part that really
[53:08] matters let's turn to genesis and look
[53:10] at this first trial
[53:14] there's just one thing i want to point
[53:15] out
[53:23] genesis 2
[53:27] verse 8
[53:32] and the lord god planted a garden
[53:34] eastward in eden
[53:36] and there he put the man whom he had
[53:37] formed and out of the ground made the
[53:40] lord god to grow every tree that is
[53:41] pleasant to the
[53:42] to the site and good for food the tree
[53:45] of life also in the midst of the garden
[53:47] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[53:49] evil
[53:52] how did that tree get there
[53:56] who put it there
[54:00] how did that tree get in the garden you
[54:03] know that's not how we would raise our
[54:04] children
[54:07] when we go in the backyard set up a play
[54:09] area you know we make it safe and
[54:11] you know we get out anything that would
[54:14] be dangerous and maybe fence it off and
[54:16] make it right
[54:17] but that's not how god made his garden
[54:21] he put the trial the temptation right
[54:23] there
[54:25] let's go over to verse 16
[54:30] and the lord god commanded the man
[54:32] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[54:33] mayest free lead but of the tree of the
[54:35] knowledge of good and evil thou shall
[54:36] not eat of it from the day
[54:38] that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[54:39] surely die
[54:41] chapter 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw
[54:44] that the tree was good for food
[54:46] and that was pleasant to the eyes and
[54:47] the tree to be desired to make one wise
[54:49] she took of the fruit thereof
[54:50] and did eat and gave also to her husband
[54:52] with her and he did eat
[54:55] and god didn't stop him and he didn't
[54:58] come down
[54:59] and he didn't make a lightning bolt
[55:00] strike the tree next to them to give him
[55:02] another warning he had already told him
[55:04] it was their choice and from that time
[55:07] on
[55:08] he set man on the same basis he could
[55:10] make a choice
[55:13] and and in order to make the choice it's
[55:15] not like flipping a coin it's not like
[55:18] rolling dice
[55:18] but these choices sometimes come down
[55:21] come with
[55:22] agony come with a real death it comes
[55:25] with a real
[55:26] a real real surrender
[55:29] i mean it's not you know we've
[55:32] i'll just say it this way we've had it
[55:34] pretty good
[55:36] we've had it pretty good we've lived in
[55:38] america we've had some freedoms and some
[55:40] privileges
[55:41] and we can come to church and we can we
[55:44] can worship the way we want and we could
[55:46] do
[55:46] you know we could we could live the
[55:47] message we could really live the message
[55:50] in america
[55:52] and so the making the choices you know
[55:55] we can make the choices and we've paid
[55:56] prices we've had
[55:57] we've had families reject us we've we've
[56:00] had churches reject us we've paid the
[56:02] price for making these choices
[56:04] but but god has a way of always turning
[56:07] the intensity up
[56:09] he's the one who can turn the dial
[56:11] because why he wants to prove
[56:14] that this bride is not like eve
[56:18] why did he let us come and satan see why
[56:20] does he let it get so bad
[56:22] why does he let things get more
[56:24] difficult why couldn't just continue on
[56:26] the way it was
[56:27] i liked the way it was i'm talking as a
[56:31] man now
[56:33] i liked being able to just come to
[56:36] church and worship and go home
[56:37] raise my family the way i want be able
[56:39] to homeschool them and teach them
[56:41] morality and teach them about god
[56:43] i like the way it was i didn't want
[56:45] anything to change
[56:46] and i would have never changed anything
[56:48] of my own free choice
[56:51] but that's not what god wants amen god
[56:53] wants to prove to satan
[56:55] she's not like ever and god
[56:59] amen had to prove jesus christ and he
[57:02] led him to go
[57:02] he led him by the spirit into the
[57:04] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[57:06] who led who where it was the spirit
[57:08] leading jesus christ to be tempted of
[57:10] the devil because he wanted to prove to
[57:12] satan
[57:12] that this is not like her amen this is
[57:15] not like the ones before
[57:16] amen he he did the same thing to job he
[57:19] wanted to prove to satan that job is a
[57:21] righteous man and he will not sin
[57:22] against me job's life was great
[57:30] but he come to a place he had to wrestle
[57:31] it out
[57:34] he wanted to prove to jesus i don't know
[57:36] what jesus is
[57:37] you know 30 years were like before we
[57:39] ended his ministry
[57:40] but he had to come to a proving time
[57:44] and the bride has to come to proving i
[57:46] should say times
[57:48] we've had times personal times where
[57:51] god's going to prove
[57:52] are we going to stay we're going to stay
[57:53] with this message or we're going to move
[57:55] on
[57:56] we've had opportunities to walk away
[58:00] somebody makes a good case somebody
[58:03] points out you know these are some
[58:05] discrepancies in what brother bam said
[58:07] and these dates don't match up and and
[58:09] this never happened
[58:11] and giving us an opportunity to walk
[58:13] away amen
[58:14] god didn't want to stop that he wanted
[58:16] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[58:18] to be right here in this church
[58:21] right in your family maybe in your house
[58:25] he said well i mean if god wanted me to
[58:27] live the message why didn't he just
[58:28] shelter and protect me and just
[58:30] feed me only good stuff no god wanted
[58:32] that tree of knowledge and good of evil
[58:34] to grow
[58:34] right next to where you walk by every
[58:36] day
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:39] because he wants to prove why why
[58:42] why why i can't answer all the wise but
[58:45] one thing i know
[58:46] because there was a rebellion in heaven
[58:48] amen that deceived the angels
[58:50] amen and lucifer was lifted up and said
[58:53] i will
[58:55] amen lucifer amen brother brother
[58:58] branham said
[58:59] lucifer was god's right hand man
[59:05] we can't imagine what that was like
[59:08] i can't imagine what that was like
[59:10] lucifer's right hand man
[59:12] and he says co-equal in every way
[59:15] but creation i'd say co-equal in every
[59:19] way but creation
[59:20] is powerful and magnificent and and
[59:23] inspiring
[59:24] all right co-equal in every
[59:29] way except for creation
[59:33] and and he got to a place
[59:37] where iniquity was found in him
[59:40] iniquity is knowing to do right and not
[59:42] doing it
[59:44] knowing better iniquity was found in him
[59:47] and he he makes a statement i have it
[59:50] here we don't have to turn there but in
[59:51] isaiah 14 12 he says
[59:52] howarth are fallen from heaven a lucifer
[59:54] son of the morning
[59:55] how thou art cast down to the ground
[59:57] which should weaken the nations
[59:59] for thou has said in thy heart i will
[1:00:01] ascend into heaven
[1:00:02] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:00:04] of god
[1:00:06] who's the stars of god
[1:00:11] i will sit upon the mount of the
[1:00:12] congregation and the size of the north
[1:00:14] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:00:16] clouds i will be like the most high
[1:00:21] the problem in heaven
[1:00:25] was self-will
[1:00:28] the problem i'm not claiming to
[1:00:31] understand it but there was a battle in
[1:00:33] heaven
[1:00:34] there was a deception amen and you think
[1:00:36] those
[1:00:37] those angels you know how could they be
[1:00:39] deceived
[1:00:40] we have no idea how magnificent lucifer
[1:00:43] was
[1:00:44] we have no idea how magnificent he was
[1:00:48] and how what a what what a marvelous
[1:00:51] spectacle he was to look at and he was
[1:00:54] powerful and he was mighty and he was
[1:00:56] full of wisdom and he was perfect and
[1:00:58] all
[1:00:59] perfect in wisdom full of glory
[1:01:03] in fact sometimes i wonder this is this
[1:01:06] is just me so take it for just coming
[1:01:08] from a brother
[1:01:10] i wonder if god did the same thing there
[1:01:13] that he always does
[1:01:15] i wonder if god stayed a little bit in
[1:01:17] the background and unseen and obscure
[1:01:19] and let let michael and let lucifer out
[1:01:22] in the front so all the angels really
[1:01:23] was seeing was michael and lucifer
[1:01:25] working
[1:01:25] amen and they didn't actually know
[1:01:27] exactly where god was but they had to
[1:01:29] discern it
[1:01:34] maybe i mean that pillar of fire maybe
[1:01:37] they you know
[1:01:38] they saw how wonderful and how
[1:01:41] wise and how powerful lucifer was and
[1:01:43] brother bam said he could exalt
[1:01:45] his kingdom over michael's humble
[1:01:47] kingdom
[1:01:49] and i just wonder if it may not bend
[1:01:51] like we imagine like all the angels come
[1:01:53] up to god
[1:01:54] and see him you know in this form and
[1:01:56] say god what do you think is it lucifer
[1:01:58] or is it michael
[1:01:59] i wonder if it was kind of like it is
[1:02:02] now
[1:02:03] he works through these other vessels
[1:02:05] amen you have to discern where god is
[1:02:08] you have to be led of the spirit amen
[1:02:10] there's a great deception and there's
[1:02:11] always been a great deception in the
[1:02:13] church
[1:02:13] amen because he planted those true trees
[1:02:15] in his garden
[1:02:17] and this church is his garden and he
[1:02:19] planted two trees in his garden
[1:02:22] because god wanted to prove
[1:02:26] to prove to prove
[1:02:32] you know the proving is not easy
[1:02:37] we think you know are you gonna wear
[1:02:40] makeup or not wear makeup
[1:02:44] that's just the beginning
[1:02:48] are you going to be baptized in jesus
[1:02:49] name you can stick with your trinity
[1:02:50] baptism
[1:02:52] that's just the beginning that's just
[1:02:55] starting off will you believe god sent a
[1:02:57] prophet or not that's just the beginning
[1:02:59] friends
[1:03:00] but what does he want he wants a fully
[1:03:03] surrendered vessel that he
[1:03:04] can display himself through
[1:03:08] because jesus was every bit man in every
[1:03:11] bit god
[1:03:14] jesus could feel he could have agony
[1:03:17] he could have travail of soul he could
[1:03:19] have troubles
[1:03:21] he could be troubled in his spirit
[1:03:27] the problem in the beginning was lucifer
[1:03:30] saying i will
[1:03:32] and i'd say the problem today is us
[1:03:34] saying
[1:03:35] i will i will do this
[1:03:39] i will do that and i will do this and i
[1:03:42] will do that
[1:03:43] and god does not want anything that you
[1:03:45] can produce
[1:03:48] he just wants you to show what he can
[1:03:50] produce
[1:03:53] in the breach brother iran says now of
[1:03:55] course when adam fell to death
[1:03:56] he brought death upon all creation now
[1:03:59] he was given free moral agency it was
[1:04:00] given to them
[1:04:02] just as just as we so to make a choice
[1:04:06] now adam and eve in the beginning there
[1:04:07] was a tree of right and wrong
[1:04:09] before before them and that same tree
[1:04:12] sets before
[1:04:12] each and every one of us god isn't doing
[1:04:15] for adam or for eve you say
[1:04:17] well it's their fault no not now it
[1:04:19] isn't it's your fault
[1:04:22] it's not your fault you're born in
[1:04:24] hybrid flesh that's their fault
[1:04:26] but what you do with the word now is not
[1:04:28] their fault that's your fault
[1:04:31] that's my fault amen now we can't play
[1:04:33] we can blame them for coming in hybrid
[1:04:34] flesh we can blame them for being born
[1:04:36] this way
[1:04:38] brother bram said you came here in in
[1:04:40] this way no fault of your own
[1:04:42] you never did it in the first place but
[1:04:45] after coming here and after hearing the
[1:04:48] word
[1:04:48] now it's our fault we've been put on the
[1:04:52] same basis
[1:04:53] of adam and eve free moral agency to
[1:04:55] make our choice
[1:04:57] amen and sometimes we try to skirt
[1:05:00] around choice
[1:05:01] [Music]
[1:05:03] we try to we try to get around
[1:05:06] having to make choices we see something
[1:05:09] coming
[1:05:10] i mean there's a showdown coming we try
[1:05:12] to go another way to avoid the showdown
[1:05:14] to avoid the conflict avoid the
[1:05:15] conversation
[1:05:18] but god has a neat way of moving the
[1:05:21] pieces
[1:05:22] around so you come in contact with it
[1:05:24] again
[1:05:25] and come in contact with it again and
[1:05:27] come in contact with it again
[1:05:28] until finally you're able to be proven
[1:05:31] by that test
[1:05:35] now it's your fault you can't place it
[1:05:37] on adam now you got to place it on
[1:05:39] yourself because right and wrong is set
[1:05:41] before you
[1:05:42] we're on the same basis as adam and eve
[1:05:46] but you see when we were when we are
[1:05:48] redeemed
[1:05:49] we no more want our own choice but we
[1:05:51] want
[1:05:52] his choice this is the change that's
[1:05:55] taking place
[1:05:56] we no longer want his our choice but we
[1:05:58] want his choice
[1:05:59] and that's what's growing that's what
[1:06:01] should be growing in our lives all the
[1:06:02] time
[1:06:03] i i you know i'm getting to the point
[1:06:05] where sometimes it takes me so long just
[1:06:08] to make a decision
[1:06:09] amen because i just don't want to do
[1:06:11] what i want to do anymore
[1:06:13] i mean i could always make a quick
[1:06:14] decision we could always say let's make
[1:06:16] a decision amen and this is what i've
[1:06:17] told my family for a while because it's
[1:06:19] the way i'm wired
[1:06:20] i hate being halt between two opinions
[1:06:23] and i used to have this saying this
[1:06:25] phrase i don't use it anymore
[1:06:26] i said let's make it we're going to make
[1:06:28] a choice and stick with it even if it's
[1:06:30] wrong
[1:06:32] because i just get tired of the
[1:06:34] in-between we're going to make a
[1:06:35] decision stick with it
[1:06:37] and we're going to crash and burn on
[1:06:38] this one you know
[1:06:41] but not anymore because i don't want to
[1:06:43] make my choice anymore
[1:06:44] i don't want to have my own will anymore
[1:06:46] i just want it to be him
[1:06:48] and him only
[1:06:52] and it gets harder
[1:06:56] it gets harder because the circumstances
[1:06:59] aren't so black and white they're not so
[1:07:00] easy anymore
[1:07:02] it gets harder amen it's like he's
[1:07:04] clamping the pressure down
[1:07:06] amen and things are becoming more cloudy
[1:07:09] and unclear where is the right and wrong
[1:07:14] what is his will and my will
[1:07:18] you know when it was the makeup it was
[1:07:20] easy
[1:07:21] when it was the tv it was easy when it
[1:07:23] was the shorts it was easy when it was
[1:07:25] water baptism
[1:07:26] it was easy it was black and white but
[1:07:28] god has a way of getting down
[1:07:30] deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
[1:07:32] and he lets the circumstances be not so
[1:07:35] clear it's a little fuzzy to where you
[1:07:37] got to go all the way down
[1:07:39] deep amen and make a choice based off
[1:07:42] motive and objective based off things
[1:07:44] that are laying in the heart
[1:07:47] not the easy you know you know well you
[1:07:50] know
[1:07:51] people will think this if if i don't so
[1:07:53] i better do it
[1:07:54] amen he's getting it down where nobody
[1:07:56] will know
[1:07:58] or he'll make it to where 50 will say
[1:08:01] this is right and 50
[1:08:02] will say that is right so you can't even
[1:08:04] take a consensus to figure out which way
[1:08:06] to go
[1:08:08] and you're left hanging there all alone
[1:08:10] half say this
[1:08:11] half say that and it's right back to you
[1:08:13] again
[1:08:18] and then you go to somebody who's senior
[1:08:20] to you and has wisdom
[1:08:22] amen and you ask them what should i do
[1:08:24] in this situation
[1:08:25] you know what many times when we begin
[1:08:27] to do that we're not looking for advice
[1:08:29] we're looking for an excuse
[1:08:34] we're looking to say if it didn't work
[1:08:36] out well he said my pastor said my dad
[1:08:38] said
[1:08:39] i asked so and so and they thought it
[1:08:41] was a good idea
[1:08:43] but god can take that away
[1:08:47] amen and the real wisdom of the wise
[1:08:50] will look at you and say i don't know i
[1:08:52] can't tell you what to do
[1:08:56] they'll look at you and say i don't know
[1:08:58] i'm not god
[1:08:59] you're in a pickle you're in a jam
[1:09:02] it could go one way or the other and
[1:09:05] you're just going to have to seek god
[1:09:06] for it
[1:09:08] that's a good answer that's always a
[1:09:10] good answer
[1:09:12] you see when we are redeemed we no more
[1:09:14] want our own choice but we want his
[1:09:16] choice see
[1:09:17] now adam and eve wanted their own choice
[1:09:19] they wanted to they wanted to find out
[1:09:21] what it was to have wisdom
[1:09:22] so they probed into it and it caused
[1:09:24] death now when man's been redeemed he
[1:09:26] don't care anymore for scholarship
[1:09:28] he don't care anymore for the things of
[1:09:30] the world
[1:09:32] for the wisdom of the world he don't
[1:09:33] want no choice at all
[1:09:35] christ has been his choice and that's
[1:09:37] all of it he's redeemed
[1:09:38] he just no more wants to lead himself he
[1:09:40] don't want nobody to talk
[1:09:43] to talk him into where to go and what to
[1:09:44] do he just waits and finds out the
[1:09:47] choice of his maker see
[1:09:48] then he goes in the name of his maker
[1:09:50] when the maker tells him to go
[1:09:53] so he gets maybe slower
[1:09:56] not faster with making choices
[1:10:00] maybe maybe you get to a place where
[1:10:03] somebody's like why why are you still
[1:10:05] sitting here
[1:10:07] just move but we get to a place where
[1:10:11] i just want his will that's all i want
[1:10:14] and until he tells me what to do i don't
[1:10:15] know what to do and until he tells me
[1:10:18] i have no idea what to do amen i'm going
[1:10:21] to wait till he forces the issue or he
[1:10:23] tells me what to do before i'm just
[1:10:25] going to make a choice
[1:10:28] that's a tough place to be
[1:10:31] brother brahm says in perfect strength
[1:10:33] my perfect weakness he said
[1:10:34] the greatest enemy i got is william
[1:10:37] branham
[1:10:42] i want to ask you who is jesus's enemy
[1:10:47] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:10:52] and of course you know the devil's there
[1:10:54] he's always there
[1:10:56] but i'm just reading through the
[1:10:58] scriptures
[1:11:01] jesus wasn't born in sin he wasn't
[1:11:03] hybrid
[1:11:06] brother i said the greatest enemy i got
[1:11:07] is william branham brother branham
[1:11:09] didn't say
[1:11:10] the devil
[1:11:17] the greatest enemy i got
[1:11:20] is me
[1:11:27] when god gets me to gethsemane
[1:11:31] i'm wrestling with one person and only
[1:11:34] one person
[1:11:35] i'm wrestling with me
[1:11:40] i'm trying to get past
[1:11:44] emotions feelings
[1:11:48] wants and desires there are things we
[1:11:51] want
[1:11:52] in this life we want another vehicle we
[1:11:55] would like to change houses we
[1:11:57] want another job i mean those are once
[1:12:00] and none of those are evil in themselves
[1:12:02] we want to do something we want to go
[1:12:05] somewhere we want to have more of this
[1:12:06] or we want less of that
[1:12:08] we have wants and desires
[1:12:11] and sometimes what god with the trial
[1:12:13] comes or
[1:12:14] a point of decision comes in such a way
[1:12:17] that god is telling us to give
[1:12:19] up those wants and we go to wrestling
[1:12:24] and who are we really wrestling with
[1:12:27] who is the real enemy right then
[1:12:31] me i'm the enemy
[1:12:34] i'm the one i'm the one
[1:12:39] who is holding back on what god's asked
[1:12:43] i'm the one amen sometimes we pray
[1:12:46] have you ever done this god's asking you
[1:12:48] to make a choice god's asking
[1:12:50] and and god's asking you to it's come to
[1:12:52] a tough spot
[1:12:53] give up something turn your back on
[1:12:55] something let an opportunity go
[1:12:57] do something and you come to the point
[1:12:59] where you're wrestling and wrestling and
[1:13:01] praying and praying
[1:13:02] and really there's nothing to pray about
[1:13:07] when it really comes down to it we'll
[1:13:09] fast we'll pray
[1:13:10] amen we'll go to prayer we'll come to
[1:13:12] the prayer time at church
[1:13:14] we'll we'll have other people pray with
[1:13:15] us but really if we would really be real
[1:13:18] honest with ourselves
[1:13:19] there was nothing to pray about from the
[1:13:21] beginning
[1:13:22] we knew what god was asking us to do
[1:13:24] we're just praying
[1:13:25] hoping god saying god can this cup pass
[1:13:28] from me
[1:13:28] god can this cup pass from me god can
[1:13:30] this cup pass from me
[1:13:35] it's the truth amen
[1:13:39] and and don't think that we're going to
[1:13:41] have less of this as we move forward
[1:13:43] it's going to come more it's time to be
[1:13:45] really honest with ourselves
[1:13:47] and quit playing uh games with ourselves
[1:13:50] and get down to the fact where we're
[1:13:52] either going to die
[1:13:53] or not we're either going to give it all
[1:13:55] a full surrender or we're not
[1:13:57] and god keeps pulling it back around
[1:13:59] before there's another surrender there's
[1:14:00] another choice to make
[1:14:01] and they'll bring it right around till
[1:14:03] there's another surrender and another
[1:14:04] choice to make
[1:14:06] what is it i think he wants preeminence
[1:14:11] i think it's the second fold of his
[1:14:12] threefold purpose i think he wants to
[1:14:14] come to perfect preeminence in a body of
[1:14:17] believers and he's doing that
[1:14:18] now how's he doing it he's getting us to
[1:14:21] wrestle
[1:14:22] with our own humanity and overcome the
[1:14:25] greatest
[1:14:25] enemy we got which is ourselves
[1:14:32] if jesus had to battle out self-will why
[1:14:35] because lucifer said i will
[1:14:39] don't think what we're going through
[1:14:40] here isn't connected with that what
[1:14:42] we're going through here is connected
[1:14:43] directly connected with what happened
[1:14:45] there
[1:14:47] and lucifer said i will
[1:14:50] eve said i will adam said i will
[1:14:56] but jesus says not my will
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:00] but it wasn't easy friends that's the
[1:15:03] point
[1:15:03] when jesus get not my will it wasn't
[1:15:06] an easy decision it wasn't easy it
[1:15:09] wasn't happy
[1:15:10] he wasn't popping chewing gum talking to
[1:15:12] his disciples laid out under a tree and
[1:15:14] said yep i think i'll do that
[1:15:16] it came with agony and trouble and
[1:15:18] spirit and great sorrow and heaviness in
[1:15:20] his spirit
[1:15:21] and if the son of god had to suffer that
[1:15:23] way to make that choice to fully
[1:15:25] surrender and die out
[1:15:26] what do you think it's going to be like
[1:15:28] for us it's not that's why brother
[1:15:30] branham said
[1:15:31] when in in these meetings he said i was
[1:15:33] watching a a religious service amen and
[1:15:36] they had the altar call and they went up
[1:15:37] there popping chewing gum and punching
[1:15:38] each other in the arm
[1:15:39] amen and when going up and wrestling
[1:15:41] with each other he said that's not the
[1:15:43] way to come
[1:15:43] you come dead you come to die you come
[1:15:46] to surrender all
[1:15:48] it's not a stand to your feet and repeat
[1:15:50] after me okay now you're safe
[1:15:52] no it's a it's a wallowing it out it's a
[1:15:54] wrestling it out and saying i'm
[1:15:56] tired of my own life i'm tired of my own
[1:15:59] way
[1:15:59] i want to surrender to him
[1:16:02] it's not a i think i'll go to church
[1:16:04] today and it's not i think
[1:16:06] i decide i'll be a christian because
[1:16:07] that looks pretty nice it's not that at
[1:16:09] all it's coming down to the fact that
[1:16:11] you realize that there's rottenness
[1:16:13] inside of me
[1:16:14] and i can't overcome me there's
[1:16:17] rottenness filthiness inside of me and
[1:16:19] no matter
[1:16:20] how much i try to do right i can't do
[1:16:22] right i need
[1:16:23] something that can clean out me and the
[1:16:25] only thing that can clean out me is him
[1:16:27] i've got to have him not because it's a
[1:16:30] good choice not because it's a good
[1:16:31] option
[1:16:32] because it's the only choice
[1:16:35] i've got to have the baptism the holy
[1:16:37] ghost not so i can have
[1:16:39] power so not so i can be excited so that
[1:16:41] i could
[1:16:42] actually live with myself
[1:16:48] because the greatest enemy i got is not
[1:16:50] the person
[1:16:51] who's causing me problems
[1:17:04] next time you say that guy at work oh my
[1:17:07] goodness he's really
[1:17:09] he's a problem for me it's not the guy
[1:17:13] at work
[1:17:17] i got a neighbor he's really
[1:17:20] it's not the neighbor
[1:17:24] it's you
[1:17:29] i got a son or a daughter i got a spouse
[1:17:32] if you knew my husband
[1:17:34] the problem's not your husband the
[1:17:37] problem's not your wife
[1:17:39] the problem's the one looking you in the
[1:17:42] mirror
[1:17:46] it's the truth across the board this
[1:17:49] person's giving me so much trouble
[1:17:51] this person that person if you were dead
[1:17:53] to self that person couldn't bother you
[1:17:57] amen jesus he could walk through all of
[1:18:01] the heretics
[1:18:02] i mean he could walk through all the
[1:18:04] religious leaders amen
[1:18:06] and and they didn't disrupt him he would
[1:18:08] tell them an answer to their question
[1:18:09] you know why this and why that he said
[1:18:11] because you have your father the devil
[1:18:14] he was pretty honest
[1:18:17] but it didn't knock him off course
[1:18:20] it didn't derail him from what he was
[1:18:23] supposed to do
[1:18:24] it didn't stop him amen from loving it
[1:18:26] didn't stop him from serving it didn't
[1:18:28] stop him from telling the truth
[1:18:31] jesus problem amen wasn't the pharisees
[1:18:36] i mean that was just the enemy trying to
[1:18:37] distract him that was the enemy trying
[1:18:39] to get him off course
[1:18:41] when he come down to it when jesus had
[1:18:43] when he was heavy and sorrowful and
[1:18:45] wrestling out in gethsemane what he was
[1:18:47] overcoming
[1:18:48] was self-will
[1:18:51] wanting to stay with his disciples
[1:18:53] wanting to bypass calvary
[1:18:57] but he had to wrestle it out so he could
[1:18:59] say
[1:19:00] lord i love that scripture and mark
[1:19:04] father you can do all things
[1:19:08] prayed that i've prayed that i'm
[1:19:10] standing right in the face of situations
[1:19:12] i
[1:19:12] absolutely can't change and it's right
[1:19:14] there and you still say father you can
[1:19:16] do all things
[1:19:20] and he doesn't say nothing back
[1:19:23] father you can make this go away like
[1:19:25] that just
[1:19:26] i've i've even prayed before i said if
[1:19:29] you just twitch your finger
[1:19:31] it'll all be over
[1:19:34] nothing
[1:19:37] because god was not interested in
[1:19:39] delivering me from my trouble
[1:19:42] god was interested in delivering me from
[1:19:44] me
[1:19:47] if we can get delivered from self i'm
[1:19:50] telling you
[1:19:51] nothing is impossible
[1:19:54] if we could get delivered from self
[1:19:57] nothing is impossible
[1:19:59] if brother brahm is saying one man fully
[1:20:02] surrendered in god's hand
[1:20:04] is enough to shake the whole world what
[1:20:07] if he could get a body of believers what
[1:20:09] if he could get a people on this planet
[1:20:11] fully surrendered and totally in his
[1:20:12] hand amen what would it just shaking be
[1:20:15] like then
[1:20:21] you know we would avoid gethsemane
[1:20:26] i can tell you right now today
[1:20:30] i would like to bypass gethsemane
[1:20:34] but there's another part of me like
[1:20:37] jesus
[1:20:38] for the glory that lay ahead he endured
[1:20:41] the christ
[1:20:42] the cross despising the shame there's
[1:20:45] something else inside of us
[1:20:46] friends that say you know what i don't
[1:20:48] want to go through gethsemane you know
[1:20:50] i don't want to suffer i don't want to
[1:20:52] face temptation
[1:20:53] but if i gotta pass through that to get
[1:20:56] there then i'll pass through that
[1:21:00] is that it's something in us pulling us
[1:21:02] back home it's something in us pulling
[1:21:04] us to our father
[1:21:05] it's the god part inside the man part
[1:21:10] something greater than us
[1:21:14] let's read this quote i haven't got past
[1:21:16] the first line perfect strength by
[1:21:18] perfect weakness
[1:21:20] the greatest enemy i got is william
[1:21:22] branham
[1:21:23] he's the one that gets in god's way
[1:21:26] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[1:21:28] that gets to a place sometimes where he
[1:21:30] thinks he can do something about it
[1:21:32] and when he does that shoves god right
[1:21:33] out of the picture
[1:21:35] but when i can get rid of that guy when
[1:21:37] i can get to a place that he's out of
[1:21:39] the way
[1:21:40] then god can come over and do things
[1:21:42] that william branham knows nothing
[1:21:44] about that's when god can use you
[1:21:47] that's when he can use any of you he can
[1:21:50] use anybody when we get out of the way
[1:21:52] but as long as we get ourselves in the
[1:21:54] way then we
[1:21:55] cannot jesus said to his disciples
[1:22:00] if any man will come after me let him
[1:22:03] deny
[1:22:04] himself that's what he was trying to get
[1:22:08] the rich young ruler to do deny himself
[1:22:12] if any man will come after me let him
[1:22:15] deny himself
[1:22:17] and take up his cross what do they do
[1:22:20] with a cross
[1:22:22] they kill you on it
[1:22:25] deny himself take up his cross and
[1:22:27] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:31] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[1:22:34] his life for my sake
[1:22:36] shall find it in gethsemane
[1:22:40] jesus was being asked to lose his life
[1:22:44] and he had to wrestle it out
[1:22:48] here we are today being asked to lose
[1:22:50] our life
[1:22:52] and we're going to have to wrestle it
[1:22:53] out
[1:22:56] i mean i can i can i could right now
[1:23:00] say let's all bow our heads don't
[1:23:02] because i'm not asking that
[1:23:04] and i say who wants to surrender their
[1:23:06] life to the lord and who wants to lose
[1:23:07] their life to find it
[1:23:08] everybody would raise their hands
[1:23:12] but that's nothing that's just raising a
[1:23:15] hand
[1:23:16] and saying that's what i want but that
[1:23:19] decision will have to be proved in
[1:23:21] gethsemane
[1:23:24] don't think it's going to be as easy as
[1:23:26] bowing ahead one day and raising a hand
[1:23:28] and saying i give my i want i want what
[1:23:31] you're talking about preacher
[1:23:32] that's the start that's you make an
[1:23:34] acknowledgement and say that's what i
[1:23:36] want
[1:23:36] but what you want has got to grow in
[1:23:38] your heart and it's got to get to the
[1:23:40] place where you want that more than you
[1:23:41] want anything else
[1:23:42] and you better believe that'll be put to
[1:23:44] the test
[1:23:46] that'll be tested time and time again
[1:23:48] and the test will get
[1:23:49] more intense as time goes on and then
[1:23:51] because he's trying to prove to satan
[1:23:53] she's not like you
[1:23:54] she will stick with this all the way
[1:23:56] through
[1:23:58] but don't think that you can pray at an
[1:24:00] altar one time and it's done
[1:24:02] amen raise your hand one time and it's
[1:24:04] done that decision at that altar will be
[1:24:06] tested
[1:24:08] that decision when you raise your hand
[1:24:09] we've seen many of people pray at the
[1:24:11] altar we've seen many
[1:24:12] people raise a hand we've seen many
[1:24:14] people turn their back on the word and
[1:24:16] walk away
[1:24:17] why because when it come down to dying
[1:24:20] or living for christ
[1:24:21] living for self or living for christ
[1:24:23] they wanted self more than living for
[1:24:24] christ
[1:24:26] they wanted my will not his will they
[1:24:28] came to gethsemane
[1:24:30] and when they came to gethsemane they
[1:24:32] said nope that's not it
[1:24:36] and in order to justify themselves they
[1:24:38] had to find a problem with the message
[1:24:42] and the problem was never the message
[1:24:43] the problem was always self.
[1:24:46] the problem wasn't the preacher the
[1:24:47] problem was in the message the problem
[1:24:49] was in the church
[1:24:49] the problem wasn't the denomination the
[1:24:51] problem wasn't rules
[1:24:52] the problem wasn't the abuse from my
[1:24:54] childhood that's never been the problem
[1:24:56] it never will be the problem the problem
[1:24:59] is always self
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:01] but we've got to find somebody to point
[1:25:04] a finger to
[1:25:04] because we don't want to point the
[1:25:06] finger here why did you walk away from
[1:25:08] truth why did you let down the standard
[1:25:10] why did you leave the church why did you
[1:25:11] go out in the world why did you do that
[1:25:13] well because of this preacher and
[1:25:14] because my mom and dad and because the
[1:25:16] brother bam said this and because the
[1:25:17] discrepancies
[1:25:18] hey that's never been the problem
[1:25:20] friends those are
[1:25:21] all there to prove what's inside of you
[1:25:26] the abuses the neglects the parents the
[1:25:28] preachers the church split
[1:25:30] it's all been there it's all ordained of
[1:25:32] god it's all there to prove that she's
[1:25:34] not like eve
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:38] if this message is true how can there be
[1:25:40] so many problems if this message is true
[1:25:42] how many church places this message is
[1:25:44] true
[1:25:44] how come there's so many different ideas
[1:25:46] and different preachers preaching how
[1:25:47] come there's so much contention
[1:25:49] to prove that she's not like eve
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:25:53] that's no excuse to leave christ there's
[1:25:55] no excuse to walk away
[1:25:57] that's no excuse to go out amen that all
[1:26:00] that does is expose
[1:26:01] that you weren't dead yet and you still
[1:26:03] loved yourself more than you loved the
[1:26:04] word of god
[1:26:06] amen that's just the raw bitter truth as
[1:26:09] true as you can lay it
[1:26:14] but when we finally come to gethsemane
[1:26:18] and say father i don't want to surrender
[1:26:23] i want to keep living that's what
[1:26:26] jesus's battle was
[1:26:28] is he going to take the sins of the
[1:26:29] world and be crucified is he going to
[1:26:31] stay with his disciples that's what
[1:26:32] brother branham said
[1:26:34] and we come to gethsemane and say ah
[1:26:37] i still you know i still
[1:26:41] have a few desires i still have a
[1:26:44] few things i'd like to do in my life
[1:26:48] experience
[1:26:50] father is there any other way
[1:26:54] father is there any other way
[1:26:58] you know the scripture doesn't give us
[1:27:00] any dialogue back
[1:27:04] i wonder if there was any dialogue back
[1:27:09] i know in some of my guests some of the
[1:27:11] experiences there's been no dialogue
[1:27:13] back
[1:27:17] and some of brother branham's there was
[1:27:19] no dialogue back
[1:27:23] father could you lord would you raise up
[1:27:26] sharon rose
[1:27:28] no dialogue back
[1:27:32] there was only one other person who
[1:27:33] would talk to him then god wouldn't
[1:27:36] but the devil would
[1:27:40] you raise up sharon rose silence
[1:27:43] what if that was your baby laying in
[1:27:45] that crib with its eyes crossed
[1:27:47] and you had to shoo the flies away
[1:27:51] and you're praying your heart out to god
[1:27:53] for your baby and you just buried
[1:27:55] your wife it's not a story
[1:27:59] it's the reality of a christian life
[1:28:02] these are the realities of a christian
[1:28:04] life brother bram said we do a
[1:28:06] disservice amen
[1:28:07] by taking the picture of christian you
[1:28:09] become a christian and god paves the way
[1:28:11] and he gives you everything you want
[1:28:12] and you do a disservice to christianity
[1:28:14] amen as soon as you give your life to
[1:28:16] christ you have surrendered on become a
[1:28:17] love slave to him
[1:28:18] and everybody in the word who became a
[1:28:20] love slave to him
[1:28:21] had to sacrifice had to give up had to
[1:28:24] be
[1:28:25] rejected and abused and cast out and
[1:28:28] slain
[1:28:29] what is that that's real christianity
[1:28:35] but they all got to a place that the
[1:28:36] reality of god was greater than the
[1:28:38] reality that they saw and they were
[1:28:40] willing to give up what they held for
[1:28:42] what he promised
[1:28:45] that's the real decision it's not
[1:28:48] making a decision for christ amen it's
[1:28:51] it's making a decision to die
[1:28:57] if we can just lose our life
[1:29:01] we can find it brother brahman said
[1:29:04] improving his word
[1:29:06] now to heal i cannot you know that what
[1:29:09] is a gift brother
[1:29:10] branham something that you take no it's
[1:29:12] something you know
[1:29:13] how to get yourself out of the way
[1:29:16] as long as you're there it'll never work
[1:29:18] william branham is the greatest
[1:29:20] enemy i got see but when i get him out
[1:29:23] of the way
[1:29:24] see then jesus christ can use the body
[1:29:27] what is it we want we want jesus christ
[1:29:31] to use this body
[1:29:34] this body was born in corruption born in
[1:29:37] sin
[1:29:38] born in corruption but it's been
[1:29:40] redeemed by the blood of jesus christ
[1:29:42] it has been sanctified by the word and
[1:29:44] by the life
[1:29:46] and now it's a dwelling place for the
[1:29:48] spirit of god
[1:29:50] and now there's god
[1:29:53] men and women on the earth again
[1:29:59] let's go to john 14.
[1:30:11] i want to talk about peter for a minute
[1:30:16] peter
[1:30:19] come to gethsemane with jesus
[1:30:24] and while jesus is surrendering all
[1:30:26] peter's sleeping
[1:30:30] right but when the guards show up
[1:30:35] peter snaps into action and goes to kill
[1:30:37] what's he doing he's fighting for his
[1:30:39] religion
[1:30:41] he's fighting for his position he's
[1:30:43] fighting to save
[1:30:44] jesus and then
[1:30:48] he gets scared and runs away
[1:30:51] see all of this is self swinging the
[1:30:54] sword was self
[1:30:56] running array with self
[1:30:59] going into the into the temple where
[1:31:01] jesus or to the
[1:31:02] to the uh palace where jesus was being
[1:31:04] interrogated
[1:31:05] amen and he was asked three times if he
[1:31:08] was one of his disciples and he denied
[1:31:09] three times
[1:31:10] what was that that was self self self
[1:31:13] self
[1:31:14] then he runs out and weeps bitterly what
[1:31:15] was that self
[1:31:18] but when we come to either first or
[1:31:20] second peter
[1:31:22] he says now i know that the time of my
[1:31:25] departure is near
[1:31:28] and so i want to take a minute to remind
[1:31:30] you although you know this and i'm
[1:31:31] establishing the present truth but i
[1:31:32] want to stir up your memory
[1:31:35] now the man who was scared and fighting
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:39] now he's just as calm as can be he's
[1:31:41] writing to them and saying there are
[1:31:43] some things i want to tell you
[1:31:44] because the time of my departure is near
[1:31:46] as the lord has showed me
[1:31:49] he was going to be crucified he was
[1:31:51] going to be taken
[1:31:52] amen and he didn't want to be crucified
[1:31:54] like christ so he wanted to turn him
[1:31:55] upside down because he didn't feel
[1:31:56] worthy to be crucified
[1:31:58] in the same manner as his savior he was
[1:32:00] going to his death
[1:32:01] but something changed between that
[1:32:03] gethsemane
[1:32:04] and the one he's talking about in peter
[1:32:06] first or second peter
[1:32:09] something changed peter died
[1:32:12] so that peter could die
[1:32:16] i'll say it like this jesus
[1:32:19] went to calvary a dead man
[1:32:25] you understand what i'm saying jesus
[1:32:27] went to calvary
[1:32:29] a dead man what they did at calvary was
[1:32:32] took care of the flesh
[1:32:33] but the decision had already been made
[1:32:35] in gethsemane the choice had been
[1:32:37] already made
[1:32:38] the death had already been made it had
[1:32:39] already been sealed in gethsemane
[1:32:42] amen they just took care of the physical
[1:32:44] portion of the physical body
[1:32:46] but he had already surrendered his
[1:32:47] spirit to the will of god in gethsemane
[1:32:51] and that's why it's time now to die
[1:32:55] the physical part will be taken care of
[1:32:57] we'll go by the grave or we'll go by the
[1:32:58] veil
[1:32:59] amen the physical part is going to be
[1:33:01] taken care of we're not worried about
[1:33:02] how the physical part
[1:33:04] amen how it ends its life i'm worried
[1:33:06] about bringing that spirit in me
[1:33:08] subject to his spirit to dying to self
[1:33:10] to letting him live
[1:33:12] that's the battle we're fighting right
[1:33:14] now amen that's
[1:33:15] that's the death we want to come to
[1:33:18] right now
[1:33:20] john 14 8
[1:33:24] philip saith unto him lord show us the
[1:33:26] father and it sufficeth us
[1:33:31] jesus said unto them i have been so long
[1:33:33] time with you
[1:33:34] and yet hast thou not known me philip
[1:33:37] he that hath seen me has seen the father
[1:33:39] and how sayest thou then
[1:33:41] show us the father believeth thou not
[1:33:43] that i am in the father and the father
[1:33:45] and me
[1:33:46] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[1:33:48] not of myself but the father that
[1:33:50] dwelleth in me
[1:33:51] he doeth the works believe me that i am
[1:33:54] in the father and the father in me
[1:33:55] or else believe me for the very work's
[1:33:58] sake
[1:34:01] philip said show me the father philip
[1:34:04] could see the man
[1:34:07] but he wasn't recognizing the father
[1:34:11] is that clear he saw the man but he was
[1:34:14] missing the father
[1:34:15] he said show us the father he said have
[1:34:18] i been so long with you that you don't
[1:34:19] know me
[1:34:20] i'm man i'm son and in me is father
[1:34:26] he says i am in the father and the
[1:34:29] father in me
[1:34:30] the words that i speak in you i speak
[1:34:32] not of myself
[1:34:33] not the man part i speak not of
[1:34:37] myself the words i speak unto you i
[1:34:38] speak not of myself but the father that
[1:34:40] dwelleth in me
[1:34:41] he doeth the works he was the god man
[1:34:46] and philip was looking at the god the
[1:34:48] man part and
[1:34:49] he's talking about the father he says
[1:34:51] show us the father he says you've
[1:34:52] already been seeing the father and
[1:34:55] didn't know it
[1:34:57] because the father is in my flesh he's
[1:34:59] in me
[1:35:00] he's in the flesh he's the one who's
[1:35:02] living the life he's the one who's doing
[1:35:04] the works he's the one who's speaking
[1:35:06] the words
[1:35:08] now let's skip down to verse 19.
[1:35:12] we're in the same discussion jesus is
[1:35:14] talking to him after this question
[1:35:16] verse 19 he says yet a little while
[1:35:19] and the world sees me no more but ye see
[1:35:21] me
[1:35:22] because i live you shall live also at
[1:35:25] that day you shall know that i am in my
[1:35:27] father
[1:35:28] and ye and me and i in you
[1:35:34] so show us the father
[1:35:38] show me the father
[1:35:41] show me jesus christ
[1:35:45] because wherever the father has went to
[1:35:49] jesus is in the father
[1:35:52] and then they've went and made their
[1:35:54] abode somewhere
[1:35:57] he said we will come and make our abode
[1:36:00] so now
[1:36:00] the father he said i'm in the father
[1:36:02] father and me
[1:36:04] he says i in you and you and me and so
[1:36:06] now
[1:36:07] we look at this picture we say so now
[1:36:09] where's the father
[1:36:11] where's the son where's the father and
[1:36:14] the son because they're going to abide
[1:36:15] together somewhere
[1:36:17] where are they abiding they're abiding
[1:36:19] in vessels of clay
[1:36:21] they're abiding in flesh and we can see
[1:36:24] the man
[1:36:24] but can we see the god-man and the
[1:36:27] god-woman
[1:36:28] can we see that it's god trying to take
[1:36:30] control of human flesh
[1:36:31] so that he can manifest himself
[1:36:33] perfectly like he did in jesus christ
[1:36:36] what does he need he needs your vessel
[1:36:39] he needs you to die
[1:36:40] because there's something inside of you
[1:36:42] that needs to be triggered or unlocked
[1:36:45] so that it can come to life brother
[1:36:48] branham says in the rising of the sun
[1:36:51] 1965 and so it is today we don't try to
[1:36:55] be some big person we don't care what
[1:36:57] the people say about us
[1:36:59] our name ain't nothing oh we've got to
[1:37:02] be here
[1:37:03] that's a nice quote but it's got to be
[1:37:05] real in us
[1:37:07] our name ain't nothing it's his name our
[1:37:09] life is nothing it's his life
[1:37:11] it's his power not our power and there
[1:37:13] is only one thing that we love to do
[1:37:16] is to see him glorified and how can it
[1:37:18] be
[1:37:19] when he's glorified in us
[1:37:24] by his resurrection that's in us we see
[1:37:27] him represented again as he was
[1:37:29] today did you get that see our desire is
[1:37:33] not to be glorified
[1:37:34] our desire is not some big name our
[1:37:36] desire is not boost some church or make
[1:37:38] more in sunday school or
[1:37:39] try to bring in hogtie push in offer a
[1:37:42] picnic party or bring stars buttons or
[1:37:44] something else like that
[1:37:45] that's not our desire our desire is to
[1:37:48] see him glorified
[1:37:49] glorified what not with self-pride
[1:37:52] but in us our lives to prove he is alive
[1:37:55] and living
[1:37:56] in us show me the father
[1:37:59] the only way you're going to see the
[1:38:00] father is if he's manifesting himself
[1:38:03] and his children
[1:38:04] because that's the method he's choosing
[1:38:06] in this day is to manifest himself
[1:38:08] in his bride that's where christ is
[1:38:13] our lives to prove he's alive and living
[1:38:16] in us
[1:38:18] if i can get myself out of the way so
[1:38:21] when william branham not even thought of
[1:38:23] and you not even thought of till we can
[1:38:25] see jesus glorified among us see him
[1:38:27] that's
[1:38:28] our desire what's the key he's in there
[1:38:31] do you believe he's in you you believe
[1:38:33] that
[1:38:34] he's in you then what do we have to do
[1:38:36] get ourselves
[1:38:38] out of the way brother branham knew it
[1:38:40] wasn't him
[1:38:41] he couldn't discern the thoughts and
[1:38:42] intents of the heart he couldn't heal
[1:38:44] the sick
[1:38:45] he couldn't do any of those things he
[1:38:46] couldn't give himself a vision
[1:38:48] he couldn't do that it was god inside of
[1:38:50] him using his flesh but what did he have
[1:38:52] to do he had to learn to get himself
[1:38:54] out of the way so that god could do
[1:38:56] something and what are we learning
[1:38:58] to get ourselves out of the way
[1:39:02] to die to self
[1:39:05] that's that gives us quickening power it
[1:39:08] gives us joy to know that we are with
[1:39:10] him
[1:39:10] both flesh and bone of him
[1:39:14] being the bride of him and seeing his
[1:39:15] same vindicated methods proving
[1:39:17] in us that he is now risen from the dead
[1:39:20] see
[1:39:20] no wonder he said fear not for now
[1:39:22] notice we are redeemed by him
[1:39:24] now risen with him that's what easter
[1:39:27] means to the people
[1:39:28] risen with him i notice now
[1:39:31] we have his spirit in us the abstract
[1:39:34] deed
[1:39:34] fully paid no you don't say well i hope
[1:39:37] i make it
[1:39:38] you've already made it not i will make
[1:39:41] it i've already made it
[1:39:42] i never made it he made it for me see
[1:39:45] not me him
[1:39:46] well brother branham i don't care what
[1:39:48] they say there he made it for me that's
[1:39:50] all i want i'm caring about
[1:39:52] i just want to see him manifested how
[1:39:54] can you do it
[1:39:55] call him down he says i just want to see
[1:39:58] him manifested how are we going to see
[1:40:00] memphis what are you going to do call
[1:40:01] him down
[1:40:01] oh great jehovah come down and manifest
[1:40:03] yourself oh great god come down now and
[1:40:06] show yourself mighty
[1:40:08] he says no listen carefully he says how
[1:40:11] can you do it
[1:40:12] call him down no he's in you
[1:40:17] it's not a calling down for a great
[1:40:19] manifestation
[1:40:20] he's already in the bride he's already
[1:40:23] housed
[1:40:24] bottled and confined in his bride that's
[1:40:27] what brother branham said
[1:40:28] he's already in you we're not calling
[1:40:30] something down
[1:40:31] oh great glory something come down what
[1:40:33] we're trying to do is die a little more
[1:40:35] to get out of his way so it can be
[1:40:37] expressed
[1:40:37] because it's already in you greater is
[1:40:41] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:40:42] world
[1:40:43] he's in you and you're in him seated in
[1:40:45] christ jesus in heavenly places
[1:40:47] it's finished it's done it's there but
[1:40:49] what we have to do is
[1:40:50] wrestle this humanity down amen and die
[1:40:53] to ourself
[1:40:54] we got to go through gethsemane until
[1:40:56] we're willing to give up
[1:40:58] our wants our desires our pleasures our
[1:41:02] everything
[1:41:04] you know the reason we fight and argue
[1:41:08] is because we think somebody shouldn't
[1:41:09] treat us bad
[1:41:13] you know why we get our feelings hurt
[1:41:17] because we think that somebody shouldn't
[1:41:19] say those things about us it's not nice
[1:41:25] not dead yet
[1:41:31] what do we get our feelings are and
[1:41:32] retaliate why do we
[1:41:34] why do we retaliate and bark back or say
[1:41:37] something mean back
[1:41:39] why because we're not dead yet
[1:41:43] i remember one time so clearly brother
[1:41:45] lonnie said anybody said it many times
[1:41:48] he said you can walk up to a corpse and
[1:41:50] kick him
[1:41:51] and he won't kick you back you can spit
[1:41:54] on him
[1:41:55] and he won't spit back
[1:41:58] jesus went to calvary a dead man
[1:42:02] they spit on him he didn't spit back
[1:42:05] they called him bad names
[1:42:06] he didn't call names back they ripped
[1:42:08] out his beard
[1:42:09] he did nothing back and when peter when
[1:42:11] he rebuked peter for taking his sword
[1:42:13] and cutting
[1:42:14] off the ear of the high priest servant
[1:42:16] when he rebuked him he said put up your
[1:42:17] sword don't you know that i could call
[1:42:19] for 12
[1:42:20] legions of angels and my father would
[1:42:22] give them to me
[1:42:23] he wasn't helpless he wasn't powerless
[1:42:26] he wasn't without authority and power
[1:42:28] to change his situation he wasn't
[1:42:30] wrestled
[1:42:31] into that situation he wrestled himself
[1:42:34] into that situation
[1:42:35] he said i don't know man takes my life i
[1:42:38] lay my life down and i raise it up again
[1:42:42] they didn't kill him he forfeited his
[1:42:44] life
[1:42:46] it wasn't their power over him it was
[1:42:48] his power over himself that allowed them
[1:42:50] to take his body and crucify it
[1:42:54] amen you realize brother branham he
[1:42:57] would quote
[1:42:57] billy sunday see like billy sunday said
[1:42:59] he said every tree had an angel sitting
[1:43:01] in it all around and if he would have
[1:43:03] just twitched his finger on the cross it
[1:43:04] would have ended the whole scene
[1:43:08] if he would have been offended feelings
[1:43:12] hurt
[1:43:12] angry because of the way they treated
[1:43:14] him he would have called legions down
[1:43:16] to change the situation but he died in
[1:43:20] gethsemane and went to calvary a dead
[1:43:22] man
[1:43:28] they could hit him over the head with a
[1:43:29] stick and say you say you're a prophet
[1:43:30] prophesy
[1:43:33] he had nothing to prove because he was
[1:43:34] dead
[1:43:37] he had finally surrendered all he had
[1:43:39] surrendered all his life but it come to
[1:43:40] the test and he had surrendered all
[1:43:44] mocked him made fun of him laughed at
[1:43:47] him
[1:43:47] beat him he didn't do anything in fact
[1:43:51] if you watch from gethsemane to calvary
[1:43:54] he hardly says a word
[1:43:59] just fragments of sentences
[1:44:03] he's got nothing to defend nothing to
[1:44:05] prove
[1:44:07] he's got he's not going to defend
[1:44:09] himself he's not going to
[1:44:10] uphold his reputation he's not going to
[1:44:13] make somebody else
[1:44:14] convince somebody else they're wrong
[1:44:15] he's right
[1:44:17] he went to calvary a dead man
[1:44:22] i said lord help me die so you can have
[1:44:24] that kind of control in me
[1:44:26] i long for that i long and guess what
[1:44:30] he's gracious he brings along exactly
[1:44:33] what we
[1:44:34] need and he knows how to cut us
[1:44:37] where only he can cut us
[1:44:41] if he knew if he knew the one spot
[1:44:45] that the rich young ruler couldn't give
[1:44:47] up
[1:44:49] he could keep all the commandments
[1:44:53] brother branham he goes on and talks
[1:44:54] about influence and he speaks of the
[1:44:56] rich young ruler many times he preaches
[1:44:57] it many times
[1:44:58] and and no doubt he was generous and he
[1:45:00] supported
[1:45:01] you know the community and he gave to
[1:45:04] the poor
[1:45:06] no doubt he was a good guy brother said
[1:45:08] he was a good boy
[1:45:09] he'd always been a good boy but there
[1:45:12] was something down in his heart that was
[1:45:14] going to keep him from a full surrender
[1:45:17] and only god knew what that was
[1:45:21] and god in his love didn't allow him to
[1:45:24] bypass that thing
[1:45:27] but god in his love took it straight to
[1:45:30] him
[1:45:34] how many of you believe god loves you
[1:45:38] he's the one with the scalpel
[1:45:41] and he knows what's holding us back
[1:45:44] he knows what's laying in our heart and
[1:45:46] his great love
[1:45:48] doesn't allow us to bypass it but his
[1:45:50] great love will bring us right into
[1:45:52] contact with it
[1:45:54] and then we have a choice to make do i
[1:45:57] drink of this cup
[1:45:59] or do i bypass it and at some point
[1:46:04] every one of us will say i'll drink of
[1:46:06] this cup
[1:46:08] if there's no other way if this is what
[1:46:10] you want i'll surrender it to
[1:46:12] you i'll drink of this come
[1:46:16] i'm in the same quote it is the rising
[1:46:18] of the sun how can you do it call him
[1:46:21] down
[1:46:21] no he's in you he's in you well then
[1:46:24] lord
[1:46:25] if i can get myself out of the way you
[1:46:28] can manifest
[1:46:30] what's holding back the manifestation of
[1:46:33] christ
[1:46:35] me i hope you can look in the mirror
[1:46:39] and say it's not that well if if they
[1:46:41] could just do this or if we would change
[1:46:43] this or preach it this way or
[1:46:45] no what's holding back the manifestation
[1:46:47] of christ
[1:46:49] me if i can get myself out of the way
[1:46:53] and the more out of the way i can get
[1:46:54] the more he can come out
[1:46:56] and the more this flesh can be subdued
[1:46:58] the more he can be glorified
[1:47:02] i can get myself out of the way you
[1:47:04] can't you can manifest
[1:47:05] how can you do it because you ordained
[1:47:07] us so all that the father has given me
[1:47:09] will come
[1:47:09] notice glory you believe that
[1:47:13] we shall rise in him we become part of
[1:47:16] him
[1:47:16] the easter the revealed secret of god
[1:47:19] like it was then
[1:47:20] of life after death we are now alive
[1:47:24] who who were once dead in sin and
[1:47:25] trespasses the true easter seals broke
[1:47:28] death from around me
[1:47:29] and i'm alive the easter seal at the
[1:47:31] beginning broke the seal of the roman
[1:47:33] seal the easter seal
[1:47:34] that he was sealed up and man when they
[1:47:37] died was gone but he broke the seal and
[1:47:39] revealed the secret
[1:47:40] and now god by his holy spirit has broke
[1:47:42] the seal from around our lives
[1:47:44] and christ is revealed as he lives in us
[1:47:48] for now we are quickened with him
[1:47:52] i'll tell you friends if we can go to
[1:47:54] gethsemane and die
[1:47:56] then god can do whatever he wants with
[1:47:58] our flesh
[1:48:00] and we can have a resurrection we can
[1:48:03] have a resurrection and be resurrected
[1:48:05] with him
[1:48:06] now not a future resurrection but a
[1:48:09] present tense resurrection
[1:48:11] that we live in him living in us
[1:48:16] let's look at first peter i want to read
[1:48:17] this last scripture and we'll close with
[1:48:19] the
[1:48:19] last scripture and one quote first peter
[1:48:23] chapter four
[1:48:33] first peter chapter 4 and verse 1.
[1:48:39] for as much then as christ has suffered
[1:48:41] for us in the flesh
[1:48:42] arm yourselves likewise with the same
[1:48:44] mind
[1:48:46] for he that has suffered in the flesh
[1:48:48] has ceased from sin
[1:48:50] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:48:51] of his time in the flesh
[1:48:53] to the lust of men but to the will of
[1:48:56] god
[1:48:57] oh doesn't that sound good friends if we
[1:49:00] could just be of the same mind of
[1:49:01] suffering
[1:49:03] that christ was we could be in the same
[1:49:06] mind
[1:49:06] for he that suffered in the flesh has
[1:49:08] ceased from sin that he no longer
[1:49:10] should live the rest of his time in the
[1:49:12] flesh to the lust of men
[1:49:14] i don't want to live the rest of my time
[1:49:16] in this flesh to the lust of men but to
[1:49:18] the will of god
[1:49:19] i want to be of the same mind that
[1:49:21] christ was whatever you have to suffer
[1:49:23] through whatever you got to do to purge
[1:49:24] me
[1:49:25] to to break me amen to tell me
[1:49:28] exactly what i need to hear like the
[1:49:30] rich young ruler if you've got to look
[1:49:32] me right in the eye
[1:49:33] if you use a preacher use a spouse you
[1:49:34] use the tape whatever you use
[1:49:36] but if you look me right down the eye
[1:49:37] and you say this is your problem
[1:49:39] you're this you're holding on to an old
[1:49:42] hurt or you're
[1:49:43] you're you love yourself more than you
[1:49:44] love god or you love the things of the
[1:49:46] world
[1:49:46] amen god if you're going to tell it i'm
[1:49:48] going to say all right lord cut it out
[1:49:50] of me
[1:49:51] i'm laying myself down on the table now
[1:49:54] lord
[1:49:54] you're the only one who knows me you're
[1:49:56] the only one who can expose that thing
[1:49:58] in me
[1:49:58] you're the only one who can cut it out
[1:50:00] of me lord i'm asking you cut it out of
[1:50:03] me
[1:50:03] i surrender now
[1:50:07] so that now i can live the rest of my
[1:50:10] time in flesh
[1:50:12] not to the lust of men but to the will
[1:50:15] of god
[1:50:16] what is that the second fold of the
[1:50:18] threefold purpose that god had in his
[1:50:20] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:50:22] the one thing he has purposed in all the
[1:50:24] bible and the one thing he wanted to
[1:50:25] achieve in all the scripture
[1:50:27] was that you would live the rest of your
[1:50:29] days not in the lust of the flesh
[1:50:31] but in the will of god and guess what
[1:50:35] he's going to accomplish this scripture
[1:50:37] someday
[1:50:39] this scripture is not a scripture it's
[1:50:41] not a memory verse this will become a
[1:50:43] living reality upon this earth and a
[1:50:45] group of people called the bride of
[1:50:46] jesus christ
[1:50:47] and i'm desiring more than ever to have
[1:50:49] it right here
[1:50:51] that i live the rest of my time in flesh
[1:50:53] not in the will
[1:50:54] the lust of the flesh but in the will of
[1:50:55] god i say god
[1:50:58] if this is gethsemane i take your will
[1:51:02] if i if it all has to be stripped away
[1:51:05] nevertheless
[1:51:07] not my will but your will be done in my
[1:51:09] life
[1:51:11] if you lose friends separated from the
[1:51:15] ones you love
[1:51:17] mocked and scourged and beat ridiculed
[1:51:19] and abused
[1:51:22] not my will but your will be done
[1:51:27] if we could just die if we could die
[1:51:31] there's nothing another human being
[1:51:33] could do to us to throw us off course
[1:51:37] there's nothing another human being
[1:51:39] could do to us to upset the plan of god
[1:51:41] in our lives if we could just surrender
[1:51:43] all and die jesus says don't fear those
[1:51:49] that can kill the body
[1:51:51] don't be afraid of that but feel here
[1:51:54] fear him
[1:51:55] that can kill the body and the soul in
[1:51:57] hell
[1:51:59] don't be afraid of what they do with
[1:52:01] this
[1:52:02] you die to the flesh on the inside you
[1:52:05] die out
[1:52:06] then whatever happens to this doesn't
[1:52:07] matter anymore
[1:52:09] because you're already dead
[1:52:13] i wonder if we could walk through life
[1:52:15] dead men and women
[1:52:18] dead to the flesh but alive in christ
[1:52:21] i wonder if we could walk in this life
[1:52:23] resurrected
[1:52:24] sons and daughters of god having died
[1:52:27] out to self and resurrected a new life
[1:52:30] of jesus christ and now it's not me
[1:52:34] somebody comes up to you and they say oh
[1:52:36] i just really like your family i'm like
[1:52:38] it's not me it's not me i couldn't do
[1:52:41] this
[1:52:42] i tried and it didn't work somebody
[1:52:45] comes up to you and say oh i just like
[1:52:46] the way you're dressed i just like the
[1:52:48] holiness
[1:52:48] it's not me it's not me
[1:52:51] what you're seeing is the father in me
[1:52:54] it's his works
[1:52:55] it's not me i had to die to me so that
[1:52:58] he could do this
[1:53:00] i had to die to me so that he could be
[1:53:02] made manifest i had to die to me so that
[1:53:03] the word would be on display
[1:53:05] it's not me it's not me there's no
[1:53:08] religious pride
[1:53:11] no religious pride no oh you know you've
[1:53:13] got a nice church and everybody down
[1:53:15] there
[1:53:18] it's not me you have a nice family it's
[1:53:20] not me
[1:53:22] i like the way you just got such a nice
[1:53:24] you know somebody will say to you just
[1:53:25] got such a nice atmosphere around you i
[1:53:27] just like to be around
[1:53:28] you say you should have seen me before
[1:53:30] no one liked to be around me
[1:53:32] i was angry and contentious and snarling
[1:53:34] and snapping
[1:53:36] what changed it's not me but you're
[1:53:38] seeing the father in
[1:53:40] me it's his works on display
[1:53:44] see it's death it takes religious pride
[1:53:47] out of the picture
[1:53:49] there is nothing we can do there's
[1:53:51] nothing we can accomplish for him
[1:53:52] there's nothing we can do in our own
[1:53:54] effort to make him happier to please him
[1:53:56] the only thing that will make him happy
[1:53:58] is a total surrender and a death to self
[1:54:02] and then it's him
[1:54:05] musicians you can come let's all stand
[1:54:09] i'm just going to stop here
[1:54:18] you know when jesus went to the
[1:54:20] temptation in the wilderness
[1:54:23] he had the spirit of god had just
[1:54:26] descended on him like a dove
[1:54:28] and he was fasting his flesh was weak
[1:54:30] but he was strong in the spirit he went
[1:54:32] out
[1:54:32] and he did wonderful things mighty
[1:54:34] things
[1:54:36] and the fame went abroad and he was
[1:54:37] glorified of all
[1:54:40] but when he come to gethsemane this time
[1:54:43] it wasn't his flesh that was weak
[1:54:46] amen this was the spirit but the member
[1:54:49] said the spirit
[1:54:50] of god departed him in gethsemane he
[1:54:52] went to calvary a man
[1:54:56] and from that time until he died on the
[1:54:59] cross
[1:55:01] we see weakness humility
[1:55:06] quietness there was only one thing he
[1:55:09] did and that's when he touched the high
[1:55:10] priest
[1:55:11] servant ear and healed his ear
[1:55:14] but after that the picture
[1:55:18] is different than it was when he came
[1:55:19] out of the wilderness temptation
[1:55:21] he cut around the wilderness temptation
[1:55:24] doing a lot of things
[1:55:26] that people saw and his fame went abroad
[1:55:29] and they he was glorified of all but
[1:55:31] when he come out of gethsemane
[1:55:34] he didn't say much he didn't do much
[1:55:37] but the picture was different he was
[1:55:40] spit on
[1:55:42] beat mocked accused
[1:55:46] and he opened not his mouth before his
[1:55:48] accusers
[1:55:51] i think all god wants is for us to die
[1:55:57] not to say you know we're going to do
[1:56:00] this we're going to do that
[1:56:01] all these great things but just die
[1:56:04] to where if he wants to use you to do
[1:56:06] something to manifest
[1:56:08] healing if he wants to manifest whatever
[1:56:10] he can do that
[1:56:11] if he wants to manifest humility and
[1:56:13] brokenness he can manifest that
[1:56:15] if you want to manifest quiet surrender
[1:56:17] he can manifest that
[1:56:18] if he wants to manifest dynamic healing
[1:56:20] he can manifest that
[1:56:24] but all he wants is for a surrender
[1:56:30] brother brahm said and who is this
[1:56:32] melchizedek notice
[1:56:34] after the battle was over melchizedek
[1:56:36] served his victorious child communion
[1:56:39] think of that part of himself
[1:56:43] now we want to see here and type here is
[1:56:45] in view the communion
[1:56:47] after the battle he gave of himself
[1:56:49] because the communion is part of christ
[1:56:52] and after the struggle is over after
[1:56:54] you've done got yourself
[1:56:56] whipped out so where's the struggle
[1:57:00] where's the struggle who where's my
[1:57:03] struggle
[1:57:05] when you've after you've done got
[1:57:07] yourself
[1:57:08] whipped out then is when you partake of
[1:57:11] christ
[1:57:12] become part of his being that's when
[1:57:15] resurrection comes
[1:57:18] is after we've got ourself done whipped
[1:57:20] out
[1:57:21] oh we've been through that journey but
[1:57:23] it's something that keeps repeating
[1:57:25] and repeating and repeating
[1:57:28] and when we come to gethsemane friends
[1:57:32] realize that god's asking us a question
[1:57:35] is it going to be my way or your way you
[1:57:38] pick
[1:57:39] brother graham said i didn't have to do
[1:57:40] all these things he said i could have
[1:57:42] went and sat on the riverbank and fished
[1:57:44] every day of my life and been just as
[1:57:46] saved
[1:57:47] i don't understand that either don't ask
[1:57:49] me how to make it make sense
[1:57:51] he just said it i believe it
[1:57:54] he had a choice remember when danny
[1:57:57] henry spoke over him in french
[1:57:58] he says thou has chosen the hard way the
[1:58:02] narrow way
[1:58:02] you did this of your own choosing
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:07] he had to wrestle with himself amen he
[1:58:10] made the wrong choice he lost his wife
[1:58:12] he lost his baby
[1:58:13] amen and now he comes to another risky
[1:58:15] choice and he makes the choice and he
[1:58:17] goes out
[1:58:18] as david going to face goliath but he
[1:58:21] did it
[1:58:22] of his own choosing
[1:58:25] jesus made a decision in gethsemane he
[1:58:27] wrestled with his flesh and he did it
[1:58:29] of his own choosing and this bride is
[1:58:32] going to overcome
[1:58:34] self amen and he's going to be manifest
[1:58:36] amen
[1:58:37] in his bride and it's going to be by her
[1:58:40] own
[1:58:41] choosing
[1:58:45] when we face gethsemane let's make the
[1:58:48] right choice
[1:58:50] because if we don't it's not like he's
[1:58:53] leaving without you
[1:58:55] it's not like he'll finish his purpose
[1:58:57] without you it's already ordained
[1:59:00] so that means we're just going to circle
[1:59:01] back to another gethsemane
[1:59:04] and if we make the wrong choice we'll
[1:59:05] circle back to another gethsemane
[1:59:08] at some point we're going to make the
[1:59:10] right choice
[1:59:11] and say not my will but thy will be done
[1:59:15] oh god
[1:59:16] praise god let's bow our heads and pray
[1:59:19] lord jesus
[1:59:21] oh god we just want to surrender lord
[1:59:25] god we have among us now our older
[1:59:28] brothers and sisters who walked this
[1:59:29] path
[1:59:30] longer than we they've seen a lot lord
[1:59:33] and they've done a lot and they've
[1:59:34] experienced a lot
[1:59:36] but yet they still want to surrender all
[1:59:39] they want a greater surrender lord and
[1:59:41] it's encouraging us who's following
[1:59:43] after them
[1:59:44] that we want a greater surrender too
[1:59:46] lord
[1:59:47] it doesn't matter how young or how old
[1:59:50] if we're new
[1:59:51] in this journey or we've done it for a
[1:59:53] long time
[1:59:55] we still want to surrender all lord we
[1:59:58] want you to be magnified and glorified
[2:00:00] in us
[2:00:01] and we want the ability in gethsemane to
[2:00:04] say
[2:00:04] not my will but thy will be done all
[2:00:08] gone
[2:00:09] we love you jesus we ask that you would
[2:00:11] take your people lord
[2:00:13] and you would minister to them yourself
[2:00:15] lord
[2:00:16] i believe you spoke your word i believe
[2:00:18] lord that you've taken control and spoke
[2:00:20] what you wanted spoke
[2:00:22] but i pray on an individual level you
[2:00:24] would take the scalpel
[2:00:26] and you would do the heart surgery
[2:00:27] [Music]
[2:00:29] and god that you would have a people
[2:00:32] that would make the right choice that
[2:00:35] would choose the narrow path
[2:00:37] that would choose the harder way and
[2:00:39] that they would do it of their own
[2:00:41] choosing not because you forced
[2:00:44] but because you gave the opportunity and
[2:00:46] they chose
[2:00:48] give us lord your grace lord if we
[2:00:51] failed in the past lord i pray you give
[2:00:53] us another chance
[2:00:55] god help us lord not to fail you now
[2:00:59] we love you lord strengthen us and use
[2:01:02] us for your glory help us to get
[2:01:03] ourselves out of the way that you can be
[2:01:05] made manifest
[2:01:07] we all we love you and ask lord that you
[2:01:09] would take your people from here
[2:01:10] as they travel home and travel wherever
[2:01:13] they go i pray god that you shine your
[2:01:15] light upon them lord and manifest
[2:01:16] yourself through them
[2:01:18] have your way with your little bride
[2:01:20] lord because we recognize
[2:01:22] that there's an abode a dwelling place
[2:01:24] for you
[2:01:26] on this earth and you're there behind
[2:01:29] the veil of skins god i just pray lord
[2:01:34] that you would rent the veil of
[2:01:35] self-will
[2:01:36] so that you can be manifest there behind
[2:01:38] the veil
[2:01:40] we love your god and ask your blessing
[2:01:41] in jesus christ's name
[2:01:48] amen
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:59] your spirits
[2:02:05] me lord
[2:02:08] and make me more lightly
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] praised
[2:02:30] is
[2:02:33] let me be
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:56] your spirit
[2:03:01] me
[2:03:05] and make me more like me
[2:03:14] me lord
[2:03:18] and bless the broken peace
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:41] jesus said no man takes my life
[2:03:46] but i lay it down
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:51] you realize even god
[2:03:54] won't kill you
[2:03:58] he wants you to lay it down by free
[2:04:02] choice
[2:04:04] that you make a decision to go the
[2:04:06] harder way
[2:04:08] god's not going to come enslave
[2:04:12] jesus looked at the rich young ruler
[2:04:14] said this is your problem
[2:04:16] but that rich young ruler had a choice
[2:04:19] to lay his life down
[2:04:20] to lose his life or save it he made his
[2:04:23] choice
[2:04:24] [Music]
[2:04:25] when he come to peter james and john
[2:04:28] he said drop your nets and follow after
[2:04:31] me and i'll make you fishers of men
[2:04:33] and they have their own choice drop
[2:04:34] their nets jesus didn't rip it out of
[2:04:36] their hands
[2:04:39] they dropped it willingly we've gotta
[2:04:43] make our choice god's not gonna come by
[2:04:47] and say you need to be dead and kill you
[2:04:49] oh we've been in trials before i've
[2:04:51] cried
[2:04:52] out god you're killing me i can't take
[2:04:53] any more
[2:04:55] but really he's not going to kill you
[2:04:58] he's going to bring you to the point of
[2:04:59] decision
[2:05:00] and if you die you're going to die of
[2:05:02] your own free
[2:05:04] choice you're going to finally lay down
[2:05:07] and say lord
[2:05:09] take me i'm all yours
[2:05:13] i lay down my life he's not going to
[2:05:16] kill me
[2:05:17] he's not going to force it he's going to
[2:05:19] give me the opportunity
[2:05:21] and he's going to ask me to make my
[2:05:23] choice
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] and everybody who makes this life in a
[2:05:27] full surrender and lives for jesus
[2:05:28] christ
[2:05:29] will do so because they chose to
[2:05:33] of their own free choice i say
[2:05:36] lord help me
[2:05:40] help me in the hour i need to lay down
[2:05:43] my life
[2:05:44] help me not to do as a rich young ruler
[2:05:46] and just walk away
[2:05:48] but help me to say oh i surrender all
[2:05:52] oh god bless you we've got several that
[2:05:55] are here
