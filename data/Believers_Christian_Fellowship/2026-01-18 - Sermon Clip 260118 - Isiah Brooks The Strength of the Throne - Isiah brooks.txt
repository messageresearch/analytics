TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You got all these message believers &gt;&gt; and you say, "Give me a roar." Roar. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; AND AND WE WE WE DON'T TAKE NOTE THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG IN THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEN JOHN &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; saw his name, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAW HIS NAME, THERE WAS NO NO QUIET MOMENT. &gt;&gt; He began to scream. HE BEGAN TO SHOUT. HE BEGAN TO PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR WORSHIP, &gt;&gt; YOUR WORSHIP IS BUILT UPON YOUR REVELATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU GOT A REAL REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS SET YOU UP FOR PRAISE. &gt;&gt; GOD SET YOU UP FOR WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE THAT'S THE THRONE &gt;&gt; THAT SATAN WANTED. HE WANTED PEOPLE TO WORSHIP HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE THRONE. IT'S NOT A CHAIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S A POSITION. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAID, IF YOU OVERCOME, &gt;&gt; I LET YOU SAT IN MY THRONE. &gt;&gt; EVEN AS I'VE SAT IN MY FATHER'S THRONE, &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE SAYING? I'M GIVING YOU THE POSITION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SAME POSITION ADAM HAD. SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE. THERE WAS NOT AN ANIMAL IN THE GARDEN THAT ADAM WAS AFRAID OF. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IN THEIR OWN WAY THEY worshiped him.
