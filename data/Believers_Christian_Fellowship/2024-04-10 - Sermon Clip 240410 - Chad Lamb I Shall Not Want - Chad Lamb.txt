TRANSCRIPT
========================================
everybody else got married and I'm still not married it's not fair How can there be not fair with God tell me how that's possible everybody else gets to have a family but I don't get to have a family amen it's not right how is there anything out of kilter with God how can he fail how can he not be a good shepherd how can he forget about us how can his plan for us be disrupted how can the things that he's predestinated not come to pass amen right [Music] the devil wants us to look around and become dissatisfied and begin to want for things that are outside the boundaries of what God's allowed for our life at some point we need to turn our vision heavenward and say I have a heavenly father who watches over me I've got a god who's my daddy and he knows what I need and he'll give me everything according to his riches and Glory I have a husband bridegroom I I I have a provider I have a Shepherd I've got everything I need and if I need something else he'll provide that too I'll ask him and believe that he'll give it to me and if I ask believing I'll have it and if he says no I still believe it's right am and it either come later or I don't need it but I'm not going to quit trusting in Him let's take our eyes off of these carnal things and let's keep our eyes focused on our bridegroom because what's life a vapor a Mist soon it's over you're not we're not going to live here forever when you think about the the lifespan of a average human being it's over before you know it it's boom it's gone I was thinking the other day about something that God had done for me when when I had an appendix rupture inside of me and I didn't know what was happening I was laying in a in a a CT scan with my arms up over my head and they slid the tray back and I remember just saying God whatever path you want me to walk I'll walk I didn't know what he wanted but he supernaturally came on the scene and made sure I didn't need a surgery and delivered me from that and I started thinking when was that and I started doing some math and it was almost 20 years ago I said it's impossible that was almost 20 years ago where does another 20 years put me and 20 years after that it was like that who cares about the car and the house and the relationship and the promotion and the [Music] vacation when it really put it in perspective he is all I need Christ is the only thing I need and he'll never fail me he'll never fail to be the shepherd I shall not want oh I say it because the Bible says it but now I'm saying it by Revelation I shall not want Chad Lamb is not going to come to a place of want because he's going to supply all of my needs according to his riches and Glory I'm not worried will I hit stressful times I'm sure but I shall not want
