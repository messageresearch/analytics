[5:06] god bless you all how's everybody doing
[5:08] tonight amen happy to be here
[5:11] i sure have enjoyed the worship back
[5:13] there such a nice atmosphere
[5:15] we have here you must come with
[5:17] expectation
[5:18] i'd like you to turn in your bibles to
[5:20] revelations chapters 1.
[5:34] revelations chapters 1 verse 12.
[5:46] amen and i turned to see the voice that
[5:49] spake with me
[5:50] and being turned i saw seven golden
[5:52] candle sticks
[5:53] and in the midst of the seven
[5:55] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[5:57] man
[5:58] clothed with the garment down to the
[6:00] foot and gird about to the pabst with
[6:02] the golden girdle
[6:03] his head and his hairs were white like
[6:05] wool his
[6:07] as white as snow and his eyes were as a
[6:10] flame of fire
[6:11] and his feet unto fine brass as if they
[6:14] had burned in a furnace
[6:16] and his voice as a sound of many waters
[6:20] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[6:24] and out of his mouth with a sharp
[6:26] two-edged sword
[6:27] and his countenance was as the sun
[6:30] shineth in its strength
[6:32] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[6:36] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[6:40] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[6:44] and the last i won't have you turn but i
[6:48] have one other scripture
[6:50] psalms 116 15.
[6:55] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[6:57] death of his saints
[6:59] if you will just bow your heads for a
[7:01] word of prayer
[7:04] heavenly father lord we come before you
[7:06] lord this evening
[7:08] lord we know nothing more to do than to
[7:10] surrender our vessels here before you
[7:12] this evening
[7:13] we recognize it was your grace that's
[7:15] watched over us and it was your grace
[7:17] that brought us here this evening father
[7:19] we recognize in and of ourselves we're
[7:21] unable to do anything right in this life
[7:23] anything good that we have we've
[7:25] received it from you
[7:26] so father god i just commit myself to
[7:28] you this evening and my insufficiencies
[7:31] and the thoughts that i have lord you
[7:33] know that even i
[7:35] know that i'm incapable of doing
[7:37] anything right
[7:38] so lord i just commit myself to you and
[7:40] i'm looking to a promise that you'd
[7:42] never leave us nor forsake us
[7:44] and lord we as all a people that were
[7:46] once not a people are now a people by
[7:48] your grace
[7:49] learning to walk by faith even each and
[7:52] every day
[7:53] even lord hitting the guardrails of our
[7:55] own human ability
[7:56] and coming off of it and realizing that
[7:58] will do us no good
[7:59] i just pray lord god that you would
[8:01] humbly receive glory and help your
[8:03] people tonight
[8:04] and take the thoughts and meditations of
[8:06] my heart and deliver them just the way
[8:07] you want them said
[8:09] we love you and thank you in jesus name
[8:11] amen
[8:12] amen you may be seated tonight
[8:19] so i you know me
[8:22] enough to know i have a funny way to get
[8:24] to my subjects
[8:25] and god kind of deals with me in a funny
[8:27] way sometimes but you know god is a god
[8:29] of variety
[8:30] and so he must have uh he wanted some
[8:33] oddballs like me i guess in that way
[8:35] and so i i just i told brother chad i
[8:38] was like man i'm really having a hard
[8:39] time
[8:40] today really hard time today it's like i
[8:42] have so much in my heart
[8:43] and so little in my brain it's like the
[8:46] brain is failing me
[8:47] um and i can't seem to take what's in my
[8:49] heart and inspiration that's in my heart
[8:51] and even see able to get it to the brain
[8:52] so i could put it on a computer
[8:54] and so i just realized i am incapable of
[8:56] doing anything good
[9:00] but i i want to minister something to
[9:04] you that's just something in my heart
[9:06] something that i've seen in the
[9:07] scriptures and and i heard brother
[9:09] branham say yesterday he seemed
[9:10] like he kind of was acting funny i was
[9:12] listening to a sermon he said you know
[9:13] i'm just going to get out here and
[9:14] preach the way i feel i'm just going to
[9:16] preach from my heart
[9:17] it's how i don't know i think he
[9:18] wrestled with himself to realize you
[9:20] know what maybe sometimes i just gotta
[9:22] just
[9:22] go with the flow go with inspiration and
[9:24] go where he wants to go
[9:26] um but you see i i i tied these two
[9:29] scriptures together for a reason
[9:32] and the special emphasis here was when
[9:35] john saw him he fell at his feet
[9:37] as dead and the other portion which i
[9:40] did not want to use this scripture but
[9:44] it hit me like four days ago and i
[9:45] actually cast it aside was precious in
[9:47] the sight of the lord as the death of
[9:49] his saints
[9:50] because the only time i've ever used or
[9:52] heard that scripture used is at
[9:54] funerals and to my knowledge there's
[9:57] nobody dead here
[9:58] tonight yet
[10:02] but i honestly started to fight with
[10:04] myself on that scripture and said now
[10:06] lord
[10:06] why would i use that for an opening
[10:08] scripture precious in the sight of the
[10:09] lord is the death of his saints
[10:12] isn't this isn't this only when someone
[10:14] dies but saints don't die
[10:17] christians don't die they can't die
[10:20] no the christians don't die so maybe the
[10:22] lord was meaning something here that we
[10:24] just want to take a peek at here a
[10:25] little bit
[10:26] maybe there's a death that we come to in
[10:28] order to enter into life
[10:30] first and when i when i i literally
[10:33] argued with myself for like five minutes
[10:34] i'm like who in the world am i arguing
[10:36] with
[10:36] i was saying i can't use that scripture
[10:38] well sure you can i'm like no i can't
[10:39] use that scripture
[10:41] it doesn't fit and then it fits
[10:43] perfectly
[10:44] and i said well you know you know you're
[10:47] acting strange when you're arguing with
[10:48] yourself on a scripture
[10:50] but i i wondered maybe i am preaching a
[10:52] few at all tonight
[10:55] maybe i am because john does fall at the
[10:58] feet of jesus as a dead man at a certain
[11:00] point in time in this
[11:01] in this journey and that's what i want
[11:03] to look at is this journey
[11:05] because i realize that i am not just
[11:07] hearing words in a book
[11:09] i am seeing my position in the
[11:10] scriptures and i am
[11:12] i'm john i you're john because john is a
[11:16] type of the bride
[11:18] and we are walking in the footsteps of
[11:20] the bride john this type
[11:22] through the bible coming up to this
[11:24] great revelation of the mystery of
[11:25] christ that he had hid in the back parts
[11:27] of his mind from before the foundation
[11:29] the world
[11:29] that he is making known right now
[11:33] and the process has never deviated
[11:36] from the one you'll see in the word
[11:38] you're never going to have an experience
[11:40] or a process that deviates what the
[11:41] scripture says
[11:42] is going to happen and i want to look at
[11:45] this from just an odd perspective i hope
[11:47] you'll just hang with me
[11:49] i just felt like this is what i'm
[11:50] supposed to bring so if i feel that way
[11:52] then that's what i bring and then
[11:53] then i'll sit down and i will sing some
[11:55] songs
[11:58] but here's how i got to this
[12:03] [Music]
[12:04] so i really have fun with the youth
[12:06] meetings so i can relax with the youth
[12:08] i can have fun with the youth i can act
[12:10] goofy with the youth right
[12:12] and i don't feel like i can do that with
[12:13] you guys so i would like to
[12:16] be able to just relax so i would i would
[12:18] i would really like you to just
[12:20] just you're all youth tonight right so
[12:22] remember in the mind of god you're
[12:23] eternal we're all the same age
[12:24] technically because we had no beginning
[12:26] nor no end so it's okay
[12:28] um so tonight we're just going to have a
[12:31] youth meeting
[12:32] and with the youth meetings we've been
[12:34] having here we've having just a great
[12:36] time and i want to say that i love
[12:37] spending time with youth
[12:39] and as your parents that you let them
[12:40] come i really enjoy it
[12:42] they're way more of an encouragement to
[12:44] me sometimes i think than i am to them
[12:46] so always appreciate that and um
[12:49] we were going through the church age
[12:50] book last year
[12:53] no in 2019 and we went through the
[12:54] entire church ages and we had just a
[12:56] really good time and god was really
[12:58] gracious and merciful to us and
[13:00] we saw a lot of things and i saw a lot
[13:02] of things and i was encouraged by a lot
[13:03] of things and in
[13:05] 2019 we finished the church aged books
[13:07] almost right there in december
[13:09] and i said well i have in my heart i
[13:12] want to go to the seals book
[13:14] and i said we can't go to the seals
[13:15] until we go to the breach
[13:17] and so i told all the kids there right
[13:18] at the end of the year 2019
[13:20] we're going into the breach and then
[13:22] there's that little thing that happened
[13:23] called covet
[13:24] and it stopped the youth meetings and we
[13:26] had no youth meetings
[13:28] and but i really had in my heart i
[13:30] wanted to preach on the seals i want to
[13:31] speak on the seals i want to study the
[13:32] seals i want to dive in
[13:34] to the seals and knowing before then i
[13:36] got to go to the breach
[13:37] but 2020 was an interesting year we
[13:40] didn't get a chance to do that
[13:41] and one thing we realized about 2020
[13:45] at least i did was i don't think i was
[13:48] ready
[13:48] to speak on the breach and i don't think
[13:50] i was ready
[13:51] to speak on the seals because
[13:55] i don't think i was in the right
[13:57] perspective
[13:58] i don't think i'd be looking at it from
[14:00] the right direction
[14:01] one thing 2020 i think maybe i'm not the
[14:04] only one
[14:05] that could say it really humbled me down
[14:08] it really broke me down it really showed
[14:11] me
[14:12] who my problem was it really really did
[14:15] that
[14:16] and with god you have to approach him in
[14:20] the right manner
[14:23] in the old testament when the high
[14:25] priest would go in there to make
[14:27] sacrifice
[14:29] he couldn't just go in there any old way
[14:31] he wanted to
[14:32] he couldn't just wake up in the morning
[14:33] and say ah i'm going into the
[14:35] holiest of holies today nope he had to
[14:38] dress the right way
[14:40] he had to walk the right way he had to
[14:42] come into the presence of god
[14:44] in the right way if he didn't he's a
[14:47] dead man
[14:48] you know what i mean and i find there's
[14:51] a pattern in the scriptures that if you
[14:53] don't approach him in the right way
[14:55] you will never see him even though he
[14:59] can be right there
[15:01] and i'm going to you know and i'll use
[15:05] an example like this do you remember in
[15:06] the bible there was the woman
[15:09] who fell at the table of the lord and
[15:11] said
[15:12] lord son of david my daughter's dying
[15:15] you know
[15:16] and she says and he says to her he says
[15:18] it's not meat for me to give the
[15:19] children spread the dogs
[15:22] and she said lord help me
[15:25] you remember that she approached him
[15:28] calling him the
[15:29] son of david which to her she was he was
[15:31] not the son of david but brother bam
[15:32] says but he he was her lord
[15:35] and when she addressed him the right way
[15:38] he then does something to her
[15:40] to test her he says it's not meat for me
[15:43] to give the children's bread to dogs
[15:45] and she says yeah lord that's the truth
[15:48] that's the truth
[15:49] but even the dogs who eat the crumbs
[15:50] that fall from the master's table
[15:53] so you're seeing some things happening
[15:55] here god
[15:56] had to be approached the right way
[15:57] addressed the right way and then the
[15:59] woman had to react to the response of
[16:01] humiliation the right way to receive
[16:03] from god
[16:04] what he wanted to do what she needed
[16:08] and so for me when i when i i started to
[16:11] stop and to think
[16:12] what did god show me in 2020 and you
[16:14] know brother chad you recap the year
[16:16] very very well for me some of the
[16:18] highlights for 2020
[16:19] was i am my own worst enemy is
[16:22] i am too strong i had too much ability
[16:27] i didn't realize the antichrist spirit
[16:32] is way closer than i think i didn't
[16:35] realize just how
[16:36] much of a woof nature i still had in me
[16:40] because the wolf nature always tried to
[16:42] defend its rights
[16:43] you know we have right now everybody's
[16:45] fighting for rights remember laodicean
[16:47] church age
[16:48] everybody's got rights we've got social
[16:50] rights
[16:51] we've got economic rights we've got
[16:54] health care rights fighting for school
[16:57] rights right to education
[16:59] all on one aisle the other aisle
[17:02] we've got constitutional rights we've
[17:05] got a bill of rights
[17:07] we've got a right to bear arms we got
[17:09] lots of rights
[17:11] right is this true a lot of rights on
[17:14] both sides
[17:15] a lot of rights on both sides
[17:18] and then i'm reminded of someone in the
[17:20] bible 2000 years ago who forfeited all
[17:23] his rights
[17:24] to fulfill one purpose and one objective
[17:27] one purpose one objective and if you
[17:30] think about that if you go back in time
[17:31] i'm just not even looking at notes
[17:33] so if you go back in time with me 2 000
[17:36] years ago you had lots of groups of
[17:37] people on the scene at one time
[17:40] you had the politicians you had the
[17:42] political leaders at that time
[17:44] that they were trying to hold things
[17:46] together you'd have herod and the local
[17:48] municipalities there they didn't want
[17:49] the people to get out of hand because
[17:51] they liked their position
[17:52] they wanted to maintain their position
[17:54] and the rights that come with that
[17:55] position
[17:56] then you had the economical leaders that
[17:58] were very comfortable
[18:00] in the status position that they had as
[18:02] the leaders of that day
[18:04] and they didn't want anything to disrupt
[18:06] their position
[18:08] then you even had the disciples who were
[18:10] jockeying for position
[18:13] even the disciples because they weren't
[18:14] even converted yet though they were
[18:16] standing in the presence of the king
[18:18] we're still saying hey who's going to
[18:19] sit on the right and who's going to sit
[18:20] on the left
[18:21] which one among us is the greatest among
[18:22] us we want to know because we want
[18:24] position because with position comes
[18:26] right
[18:28] you know what i mean and all the while
[18:30] there was a little lamb in the presence
[18:32] of the people
[18:33] there was a lamb of god who had
[18:36] the highest level the greatest seat of
[18:40] position
[18:41] he looked down on everything and he
[18:43] forfeited it
[18:44] all gave up all his rights
[18:50] to pay a price for you and me and then
[18:52] my question then comes then today
[18:55] where is the lamb where is the lamb that
[18:58] has rights but forfeits all their rights
[19:01] you forfeit your bill of rights you
[19:03] forfeit your constitutional rights you
[19:04] forfeit your gun rights you forship your
[19:06] social
[19:07] social rights you forfeit your economic
[19:09] rights you forfeit all your rights and
[19:11] say
[19:11] not my will be done but god's will be
[19:13] done you know what i mean
[19:16] so i realized that um in me was a lot of
[19:19] things not right
[19:21] and maybe i'm not the only one
[19:25] maybe maybe there was a few of us
[19:28] that were still we've got rights
[19:32] and little did we realize that was the
[19:34] laodicean spirit
[19:36] and it's working on as an antichrist
[19:38] spirit to get you to pull you away from
[19:40] the word
[19:41] and the word is very simple very humble
[19:45] won't shout at you won't yell and it
[19:47] maintains the same
[19:48] and it hides in simplicity the whole
[19:50] time
[19:52] and so as i realized that in my heart i
[19:54] wanted to go to the seals
[19:56] i really realized i had a lot to learn
[19:59] in 2020 i could not
[20:02] go there because i wouldn't be
[20:06] approaching him the right way
[20:08] i hope that makes sense and i think it's
[20:11] been confirmed just a little bit maybe
[20:12] i'm just
[20:13] maybe it's just me but when brother chad
[20:15] even just took justification
[20:18] last wednesday and sanctification on
[20:20] sunday
[20:21] to me it was god hiding in the
[20:23] simplicity of his word revealing it the
[20:25] same way that he hid it
[20:27] to people simple enough to receive it
[20:30] and god's whole mystery plan was that
[20:32] from the beginning
[20:33] he hid it in simplicity so the simple
[20:35] could receive it i love
[20:36] that he made it so that a fool should
[20:39] not air it
[20:40] i don't have to do spiritual backflips
[20:42] into a body change
[20:44] i don't i humbly simply believe his word
[20:47] and humble myself under his hand of
[20:49] humbling
[20:51] and so i
[20:55] was well we finished the year 2020
[20:58] and i says well i want to go to the
[21:01] seals
[21:02] and here as i'm going in these seals
[21:05] about a month ago i'm praying about i
[21:06] said i want to go to those seals i want
[21:07] to start with the breach again with it
[21:09] for the kids for the kids and for me
[21:10] because i really like going through them
[21:12] and before i'm approaching it i'm
[21:15] realizing you know the last time i spoke
[21:17] i think i spoke i don't know what the
[21:18] title was bringing forth fruit in
[21:20] this barren land and uh i kind of shared
[21:24] with you
[21:24] a little experience where the lamb of
[21:26] god didn't really express a lamb like
[21:28] nature
[21:29] and it was a very down spot for me and i
[21:32] realized that that was just the
[21:34] beginning
[21:34] of a downward spiral of brokenness
[21:38] that lasted a few months and by the
[21:40] god's grace he brought me out of it
[21:42] but what i realized in that was
[21:45] i realized there is nothing good with me
[21:47] they're re they're real
[21:48] i have nothing to glory like i'm broken
[21:52] i'm weak i have nothing
[21:55] that i can say i'm strong enough to do
[21:57] this like i didn't i had a point in time
[21:59] i'm literally looking at the ground i'm
[22:01] saying
[22:02] i can't i'm gonna break i'm gonna i
[22:03] can't take this anymore i'm no better
[22:05] than the dust and dirt i'm standing on
[22:07] i literally had that spot in my mind
[22:10] and not thinking straight just not
[22:12] thinking straight
[22:14] and then i came and i'm praying about
[22:16] these things
[22:17] and that's when all these thoughts start
[22:19] coming to my mind
[22:21] and here i am i'm wanting to go to the
[22:22] seals and i'm wanting to see the breach
[22:24] and i'm wanting to understand when the
[22:25] lamb
[22:26] only the lamb can take the book and lose
[22:27] his seals i'm wanting to understand this
[22:29] mystery
[22:31] and god in his mercy is showing it to me
[22:34] portions of it
[22:34] and yet i'm realizing that i can't
[22:37] approach these next steps until i can
[22:39] fall at his feet
[22:40] like a dead man and actually realize i'm
[22:41] dead and it's one thing to say it
[22:44] but i don't believe we preach
[22:48] just philosophical ideas i believe we
[22:51] preach what we're experiencing
[22:52] what we're going through where we came
[22:54] from and where we're going
[22:56] and maybe i'm just so simple enough i
[22:59] actually believe i'm a part of this
[23:00] story
[23:01] not because of anything good i've done
[23:02] but by his grace i believe i'm a part of
[23:05] it i really do i'm identified with these
[23:06] bible scriptures
[23:08] and so when i was uh approaching it
[23:11] the thought struck me i says my here i
[23:14] am and i'm broken and i want to go into
[23:16] the breach and here i am
[23:17] i've realized i've turned from the seven
[23:19] church ages
[23:21] i seen his glory in his power and here i
[23:24] am experiencing 2020
[23:26] realizing there's absolutely nothing
[23:28] good in me
[23:29] never was everything was by his grace
[23:33] nothing good in me and here i am wanting
[23:35] to go
[23:36] to the breach and in all of that
[23:40] these things start to come very very
[23:42] clear to me
[23:43] because i do not believe uh i'll put it
[23:45] this way revelations 1
[23:47] when he sees the image he falls to the
[23:49] ground like a dead man
[23:50] he does not get back up until
[23:52] revelations 4
[23:54] when he's caught up higher by a trumpet
[23:56] voice you know that
[23:58] so this is a pattern and i wanted to
[24:02] read this quote that i came across
[24:04] when i was preparing for that so because
[24:06] before i
[24:07] started into the breach i woke up in the
[24:10] night praying about it
[24:11] and i realized i was going to miss
[24:13] something and what i was going to miss
[24:15] i came downstairs i grabbed my seal book
[24:17] and i started reading the breach and i
[24:19] i kind of looked back and i realized oh
[24:21] man i skipped god hiding himself in
[24:22] simplicity
[24:23] i said well do i really need god hiding
[24:25] himself in simplicity i understand the
[24:26] concept i think right
[24:31] that's a scary thought i think i got it
[24:34] figured out oh
[24:35] that's where i fail so i opened up i
[24:37] turned it all the way back to godhead
[24:39] himself and simplicity it's about 4am
[24:40] and i start reading it
[24:42] and brother branham about page 14. he
[24:44] says i didn't see it to weigh in the wee
[24:46] hours of night last night
[24:47] this thought and this is what ties the
[24:50] whole thing together
[24:52] the whole thing the whole you can't see
[24:56] the breach
[24:57] you can't understand what he's saying i
[24:58] mean you could tell me the words
[25:00] but you can't see it you won't see the
[25:03] seals you won't see the breach
[25:05] until you see god hiding himself in
[25:06] simplicity it's the little mystery key
[25:09] to the whole thing
[25:11] and so when i woke up and i read that i
[25:13] said well praise the lord
[25:15] thanks for waking me up at 4 a.m i can't
[25:17] start the breach i got to the kids
[25:18] that afternoon with youth me i said
[25:20] sorry guys we're not going to the breach
[25:21] we're doing god hiding himself in
[25:22] simplicity
[25:23] we're going to start right here and i
[25:26] and i saw it and god had himself in
[25:27] simplicity i saw
[25:29] i can't go there unless i
[25:32] first come the right way and i'm going
[25:35] to read a quote to you and this may help
[25:38] what here is thou elijah 1959 he says
[25:42] john sprole a real friend of mine
[25:44] taking his wife and took a friend of
[25:47] mine taking his wife
[25:49] a trip to alice lorraine france and the
[25:52] guide was
[25:53] taking them through a certain garden and
[25:55] he showed them a statue of the lord
[25:56] jesus
[25:57] and brother sproul said he was looking
[26:00] at the statue he said
[26:01] what did the sculptor have in his mind
[26:05] why don't i don't see any sufferings of
[26:08] christ i don't see nothing
[26:10] just looks like a statue what does it
[26:12] mean and the guide said to him mr sproul
[26:15] perhaps you are criticizing the statue
[26:18] he said yes sir
[26:19] i said i don't know what the sculpture
[26:21] had in his mind
[26:22] he said the thing of it is you have to
[26:25] know what the sculpture had in his mind
[26:27] before you can see
[26:28] what he was trying to do he said now you
[26:31] come down here
[26:33] and he went and he took him to the very
[26:35] foot of the cross
[26:36] and there was a pad he said you kneeled
[26:39] down here
[26:40] he said now you look up and mr sproul
[26:43] said that his heart almost broke within
[26:45] him
[26:46] there was that every agony that jesus
[26:49] went through on the cross
[26:50] all featured he said you see sir
[26:53] the statue was made to get down and to
[26:56] look up to
[26:58] not to stand afar off and look over at
[27:02] well that's the way pentecostal is and
[27:06] that's the way that the word of god is
[27:09] that's the way the promises of god
[27:11] is it isn't to stand afar off to one
[27:14] side
[27:15] and say oh there's nothing to it no you
[27:17] got to get down on your knees one time
[27:20] and you have to look up to it then
[27:22] you'll see
[27:23] all together a different picture you'll
[27:26] hear something speak
[27:27] back to you through the word that will
[27:30] pick you
[27:31] up and say oh it's the
[27:34] oh it's just a word that's uh that's a
[27:37] paper that's wrote on paper
[27:39] that's what you'll say looking at it but
[27:41] when you get down on your knees one time
[27:43] you'll say oh lord
[27:44] is this your word this is your promises
[27:47] to me
[27:48] isn't it lord and i'll feel and you'll
[27:50] feel the tears that'll be running off
[27:52] your cheek
[27:52] and the whole thing will be altogether
[27:55] all together different
[27:56] when you do that long
[28:00] thought but you get what i'm saying
[28:03] you can't look at it you can't look at
[28:05] this word you got to look
[28:06] up to it and that's exactly what took
[28:09] place
[28:10] in revelations 1 to revelations 4 when
[28:13] he turns
[28:14] from the seven church ages and he sees
[28:16] the mighty god unveiled through the
[28:17] seven churches he sees the seventh a
[28:20] church is and the seven messengers then
[28:22] he falls to the ground
[28:23] but then the lord lays his right hand
[28:25] upon him to whom the arm of the lord is
[28:28] revealed right
[28:29] and then he doesn't get back up until
[28:32] revelations 4 when he hears an open
[28:34] voice
[28:34] and then he looks at the breach so this
[28:37] whole thing i'm trying to say is
[28:39] maybe 2020 was just getting us into
[28:41] position
[28:42] to be able to really go where god wants
[28:45] us to go
[28:46] and to see the things that god wants us
[28:47] to see but recognizing it's all in
[28:50] simplicity
[28:51] it's all in simplicity
[28:54] i needed broke i know i needed broke
[28:58] um psalms 117 now going back to this
[29:01] scripture of precious in the sight of
[29:02] the lord is the death of his saints
[29:05] and i i struggled with it and then i
[29:07] grabbed the whole chapter so why don't
[29:08] you open it up in your bibles
[29:11] 116 verse 1
[29:17] 116 verse 1.
[29:26] it says i love the lord because he hath
[29:29] heard my voice and my supplications
[29:32] because he hath inclined his ear unto me
[29:34] therefore will i call upon him as long
[29:36] as i live
[29:38] the sorrows of death compassed me and
[29:40] the pains of hell
[29:42] gat hold on me and i found trouble
[29:45] and sorrow then called i on the name of
[29:47] the lord
[29:48] o lord beseech thee deliver my soul
[29:51] gracious is the lord and righteous
[29:53] yea our god is merciful the lord
[29:56] preserveth
[29:57] the simple amen
[30:01] i was brought low and he helped me
[30:05] return unto thy rest o my soul
[30:08] for the lord hath dealt bountifully with
[30:10] me for thou hast delivered my soul from
[30:12] death
[30:13] mine eyes from tears and my feet from
[30:15] falling
[30:16] i will walk before the lord in the land
[30:18] of the living
[30:19] i believed therefore i have spoken i was
[30:22] greatly afflicted this greatly afflicted
[30:26] i wanted to just read you what this
[30:27] greatly afflicted is it's ana
[30:30] it means to be bruised with and to be
[30:32] oppressed
[30:33] and to be humbled by to be afflicted and
[30:36] to be bowed over
[30:37] to be put down and to be made low
[30:40] depressed and cast down
[30:41] to be stooped to humble oneself and to
[30:44] be bowed
[30:45] to be afflicted to be humble to be
[30:47] mishandled to be humiliated afflicted
[30:50] and weakened
[30:53] bowed down i said in my haste all men
[30:56] are liars
[30:57] what will i render into the lord for all
[30:59] of his benefits to me
[31:00] i will take the cup of salvation and
[31:02] call upon the name of the lord
[31:04] i will pay my vows unto the lord now in
[31:06] the presence of his people
[31:07] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[31:09] death of his saints
[31:12] and you remember in the scriptures
[31:13] isaiah 53 it says yea
[31:16] it yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[31:20] he hath put on him he put him to grief
[31:23] when thou shalt make his soul an
[31:25] offering for sin
[31:26] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[31:28] his days and the pleasure the lord shall
[31:30] prosper in his hand
[31:32] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[31:34] shall be satisfied
[31:36] by the knowledge shall my righteous
[31:38] servant justify many
[31:40] for he shall bear their iniquities i
[31:43] think
[31:43] god finds pleasure in us being broken
[31:47] i think god finds pleasure in us falling
[31:49] before his feet as dead men
[31:52] absolute dead i believe god finds
[31:54] pleasure
[31:55] and precious in his sight is when we die
[31:59] and say not our will but thy will be
[32:02] done
[32:06] okay maybe it was just me the only one
[32:07] that needed to die so
[32:09] i don't think so though i don't think so
[32:13] brother brenna makes this comment he
[32:14] says i was at a friend's house yesterday
[32:17] in a christian home
[32:18] and there were some young christians
[32:20] gathered and i was talking to them
[32:22] and the something was presented to me
[32:24] and i thought oh how
[32:26] i was looking into the woods around the
[32:27] trees and seeing that
[32:29] that they were dying and i thought oh
[32:31] how pretty those trees are
[32:32] even though they're dying yet they are
[32:35] pretty and sometimes a tree looks better
[32:37] when it is dying
[32:38] than when it does in its greenest and at
[32:40] its best
[32:41] and i wonder if that just wouldn't be
[32:43] the picture
[32:44] of our condition to our heavenly father
[32:47] for he said precious in the sight of the
[32:50] lord
[32:50] is the death of his saints how that must
[32:53] be a beautiful thing for the father to
[32:55] look down at his child
[32:56] coming home to him holding his position
[33:00] in christ and his faith and his
[33:02] confession
[33:03] i am saved by the grace of god and i
[33:05] stand there
[33:06] in the hour of death yet he will hold
[33:10] his profession and i believe that our
[33:12] father
[33:14] loves our gallantry and believing and
[33:16] holding to our testimony
[33:18] and just it isn't just to testify when
[33:22] you're feeling good
[33:23] or healthy or strong it's when you're
[33:25] down
[33:26] weak and troubled that that is when your
[33:29] testimony really counts
[33:32] amen so father god may be pleased
[33:35] in our destruction may be pleased in
[33:38] seeing us hold our confession
[33:40] in total brokenness
[33:44] total brokenness turn to job 42.
[33:56] just want you to see the pattern here
[34:00] there's no going up until there's a
[34:02] first going down
[34:06] then job chapters 42 then job answered
[34:09] the lord and said
[34:10] i know that thou canst do everything
[34:13] and that no thought can be withholding
[34:15] from thee who is he that hideth counsel
[34:18] without knowledge therefore hath i
[34:20] uttered that i understood not things too
[34:23] wonderful for me
[34:25] which i knew not hear and i beseech thee
[34:28] and i will speak
[34:29] and i will demand of thee and declare
[34:32] thou
[34:33] unto me i have heard of thee with the
[34:36] hearing of the ear
[34:37] but now mine eye seeth thee
[34:40] there wherefore i abhor myself and
[34:44] repent
[34:44] in dust and in ashes isaiah 6
[35:00] when job sees him in the reality of what
[35:02] he is
[35:03] after those seven seals if you remember
[35:05] we went through the seven seals and jobs
[35:06] lies we saw the six seals and him coming
[35:08] up to the seventh seal
[35:10] and when he sees the seventh seal he
[35:11] falls like a dead man
[35:14] chapter 6 isaiah chapter 6 in the year
[35:17] that king uzziah died i saw
[35:19] also the lord sitting upon the throne
[35:21] high and lifted up and his train
[35:23] filled his temple above it stood
[35:25] seraphins each of them having six wings
[35:27] and twain covered their face with twain
[35:28] they cover their feet and with twain
[35:30] they did fly
[35:31] and one cried unto another and said holy
[35:33] holy holy is the lord of hosts
[35:35] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[35:37] the post of the door
[35:38] moved at the voice of him that cried and
[35:40] the house was filled with smoke
[35:42] then said i woe is me for i am undone
[35:45] because i am a man of unclean lips and i
[35:48] dwell in the midst of a people of
[35:50] unclean lips from my eyes have seen the
[35:52] king
[35:53] the lord of hosts noticing a pattern
[35:57] in your bibles now to
[36:03] first peter 5.
[36:29] uh first peter four was i think his
[36:31] first peter
[36:34] first peter oh i'm sorry no first peter
[36:37] 5'4 i apologize
[36:40] first peter 4 5 it says when the chief
[36:42] shepherd
[36:43] shall appear he shall receive a crown of
[36:46] glory that fadeth not away
[36:48] likewise he younger submit yourselves to
[36:50] the other
[36:51] yea all of you subject yourselves one to
[36:53] another and be clothed with humility
[36:55] for the god resisteth the proud and
[36:57] giveth grace to the humble
[36:58] uphumble thyself therefore unto the
[37:00] mighty hand of god
[37:02] and he will exalt you in due time this
[37:04] is at his appearing
[37:07] there's no difference between his
[37:09] appearing in the humility of the one
[37:10] he's appearing to
[37:12] and it's shocking to me that you can be
[37:13] in his presence and not recognize it
[37:16] truly cannot recognize it even so much
[37:18] that john the baptist
[37:20] in the presence of jesus christ through
[37:21] inspiration said behold the lamb of god
[37:23] that taketh away the sins of the world
[37:25] then sends messengers and says are you
[37:27] the one or do we
[37:28] look for another and the reality of it
[37:30] is his answer came when he was in prison
[37:33] when jesus answered him and said tell
[37:36] john the blind see
[37:37] the deaf here and the gospel the poorest
[37:40] preached into the gospel
[37:41] and john knew that that was him because
[37:43] he saw that jesus was the vindication
[37:46] of the word because god vindicated his
[37:48] word by bringing it to pass and we know
[37:50] the manifestation of the word is when
[37:51] god fulfills his word
[37:53] so john recognized him as who he was
[37:56] when the word declared what he was
[37:58] but he was even in the presence of him
[38:00] and could not recognize it because it
[38:02] was too simple
[38:03] even to john it was too simple so where
[38:06] is the presence of christ today
[38:11] where is the lamb at where is christ
[38:16] is he veiled in humility is he veiled in
[38:19] simplicity
[38:20] is he veiled in vessels of dishonor
[38:24] vessels rejected smitten
[38:27] rejected those are the vessels he's
[38:30] still hiding
[38:31] but you can be in his own presence and
[38:33] not even recognize that he is in your
[38:35] presence
[38:36] because he's veiled in human flesh
[38:41] jesus said this in matthew he says the
[38:44] disciples came to jesus said
[38:46] who's the greatest in the kingdom of
[38:47] heaven and jesus called a little child
[38:50] and set him in the midst of him and said
[38:52] verily i say unto you except you be
[38:54] converted and become like a little child
[38:56] you will not enter into the kingdom of
[38:58] heaven whosoever therefore
[39:00] shall humble himself like a little child
[39:02] shall be the greatest
[39:03] in the kingdom of heaven you know
[39:06] brother banham talks about moses he said
[39:08] god let moses get
[39:10] real strong real wise so wise he could
[39:13] teach the egyptians wisdom
[39:15] he let him get so he was at the peak of
[39:17] his performance and you would say
[39:18] athletics
[39:20] he was a peak in politics he was next in
[39:23] line to be pharaoh
[39:24] he let him get in that condition just to
[39:26] let him fail miserably
[39:29] just to show one thing i won't do it
[39:32] that way
[39:33] i won't do it that way do you think god
[39:36] would let you get real
[39:37] strong even a prophet moses was a
[39:40] prophet and knew he was a deliverer he
[39:42] knew
[39:42] who he was he knew his position the
[39:44] question wasn't did he know his position
[39:46] he knew his position he just wasn't in
[39:48] the right condition
[39:50] ain't that something that does make you
[39:53] want to preach brother shay
[39:55] right position but wrong condition you
[39:57] can know your position and still not be
[39:59] in the right condition to fulfill the
[40:01] plan of god that he has for your life
[40:03] it's an interesting thing to me the
[40:05] bride of jesus christ we are told your
[40:06] position you know your position you know
[40:08] what the word says about you
[40:09] but you forsake the very thing that
[40:11] god's using to get you in the condition
[40:13] to fulfill your position
[40:14] oh that's kind of fun to say i enjoy
[40:17] that
[40:17] my ain't that something that's
[40:21] fun to think about but it is the truth
[40:24] we're forsaking the very thing that god
[40:26] is going to use
[40:27] you think that 2020 was it
[40:31] my they're signing things so fast
[40:33] they're going to run out of ink pretty
[40:34] soon
[40:36] they're putting stuff in order the mask
[40:38] is going to look
[40:39] small compared to some of the rights
[40:41] that are going to be ripped out of your
[40:42] hands
[40:43] but it's perfect it's perfect it's just
[40:46] what god has ordained
[40:48] and the whole thing let them do what
[40:50] they're going to do
[40:51] i just don't really resist the hand of
[40:53] god to condition me to get me in the
[40:54] right place for him to fully reveal that
[40:57] great mystery that he put down on the
[40:58] inside of me
[41:00] though i know i'm mud and muck though i
[41:02] know there's nothing good here
[41:03] i know he put something down on the
[41:05] inside and he's going to express it
[41:07] at the right time and in the right way i
[41:09] know he's going to do it
[41:11] and even brother branham said that in
[41:12] christ and god hide himself into place
[41:14] he says remember
[41:15] this was all this was an old pawn that
[41:17] nobody wanted
[41:19] nobody wanted he said but down on the
[41:21] inside of that pond there was little
[41:22] lily a little lily and he said it would
[41:25] press down beneath the mud and the muck
[41:27] looking for that light reaching out for
[41:29] that light to express
[41:30] the great beauty that was on the inside
[41:32] of it and i can say amen to that
[41:34] that's pretty simple ain't it but boy
[41:37] there's a lot of truth in that
[41:39] see i like how god hides it in
[41:41] simplicity i know that god even brother
[41:43] branham goes on he starts to talk about
[41:44] the little the building there
[41:46] he said you know this building it was
[41:49] just a
[41:49] just an area nobody wanted and we put up
[41:51] the building here he said it's a simple
[41:53] building
[41:54] you know when he says one time a man
[41:55] tried to take the building from us
[41:57] okay a man made a falco false accusation
[42:01] to try to take the building
[42:02] but god watched over it and it didn't
[42:04] happen then he said there was a fire up
[42:06] there was a wood burner up in the the
[42:08] rafters there
[42:09] he said they went do some excavating and
[42:12] do some work on it and the fire just
[42:14] didn't take he said the whole building
[42:15] should have been destroyed he said what
[42:16] was it
[42:17] must have been the hand of god watching
[42:18] over the building now you know and i
[42:20] know he's speaking about somebody just
[42:23] not about the building he's speaking
[42:24] about me and he's speaking about you
[42:26] you know and with everything you knew
[42:28] there's a false accuser accusing you day
[42:30] and night putting thoughts into your
[42:31] high trying to get you to deny who you
[42:33] are in christ
[42:34] day and night but he can only go so far
[42:36] and his claims will fall
[42:37] false there's no one to enforce those
[42:39] claims because there's all
[42:41] an overriding word that says i am bone
[42:44] of his bone
[42:44] life of his life flesh of his flesh when
[42:47] she is
[42:47] him so there's an overriding person
[42:49] there's a judge there that says no i'm
[42:51] throwing out that accusation
[42:52] it won't fit against these people
[42:54] because i've declared them righteous
[42:56] though they make mistakes it's not the
[42:58] righteousness of their works but it's an
[43:00] imputed righteousness that god gave to
[43:02] me
[43:02] by my faith and my faith alone
[43:06] and i thought that the other day oh
[43:07] foolish galatians who hath bewitched you
[43:09] to think that
[43:10] you think you came out by the hearing of
[43:12] the word you think you can add one inch
[43:13] to your stature
[43:14] from anything that you do no sir this
[43:16] was grace in the beginning it's grace at
[43:18] the end
[43:19] he starts the work and he'll finish the
[43:20] work and brother branham he goes and
[43:22] he's
[43:22] talking about that that fire that was
[43:24] inside of that building he said but it
[43:26] just
[43:26] couldn't take it it wouldn't go god was
[43:29] watching over it
[43:30] and you know and i know down on the
[43:31] inside of you this body of flesh is
[43:33] filthy rotten nasty thing
[43:35] there would be things that would destroy
[43:37] you that's already on the inside of you
[43:39] but god won't let it happen it won't it
[43:42] won't go
[43:43] it won't destroy it no god has purposed
[43:45] within himself that just makes me happy
[43:47] to know that god purposed in himself to
[43:50] preserve
[43:51] me i'm not preserving myself
[43:54] i'm not putting myself in a rapture he
[43:57] purposed in himself
[43:58] and this is the fulfillment of his
[44:00] desire
[44:01] not mine well it is mine but i've got
[44:04] nothing to do with the fulfillment
[44:05] thereof
[44:06] i just humble myself and believe what
[44:09] he's told me
[44:10] i'm so happy i got something to believe
[44:12] with
[44:13] you know when brother branham kept
[44:15] talking about that god high himself
[44:16] simplicity i told the kids i said
[44:18] don't think that god didn't inspire him
[44:19] to say those things for with no reason
[44:22] he inspired him say it with a reason now
[44:25] here's brother branham before he can
[44:26] even go into the breach and go into the
[44:28] seals what does he tell the church to do
[44:31] reconsecrate their lives time for a
[44:34] reconsecration
[44:36] god did call you out you're the elect of
[44:38] god you're god's chosen people but
[44:40] before we go into this
[44:42] we need a reconsecration before john
[44:45] could go into revelations 4
[44:47] you better fall as a dead man before
[44:48] isaiah could step into chapter 7 in the
[44:51] fulfillment of the seal he had to say
[44:53] woe is me
[44:54] before job could actually go and pray
[44:56] for his friends and intercede on behalf
[44:58] of them
[44:59] remember how god did that he set it all
[45:00] up he said if job don't pray for you
[45:03] you're done for and now job had to play
[45:06] the intercessory role on behalf of his
[45:08] friends
[45:08] but before he could do that he had to
[45:10] bow his head to the dust and ashes from
[45:12] which he came
[45:13] there is no way you're going to approach
[45:16] into that seven seal mystery that god
[45:17] docked up and put inside of you
[45:19] unless you first can come to him in the
[45:21] right way
[45:23] he put it in earth and vessels remember
[45:25] jeremiah he took the seven seal mystery
[45:26] and put it into earthen vessels
[45:29] okay that was earth and vessels where
[45:31] are they today
[45:34] he paid a price two thousand years ago
[45:36] but the mystery is still in earthen
[45:37] vessels
[45:38] christ in us is the hope of glory
[45:41] so these things here in in god hiding
[45:45] himself in simplicity
[45:46] what you begin to realize is there's a
[45:49] necessary process
[45:51] of god humbling us people and humbling
[45:53] this bride
[45:54] we're not going in because of the end of
[45:56] our intellectual ability to see things
[45:58] i think we continue to walk with him as
[46:02] we don't forsake whatever he brings our
[46:05] way
[46:06] to put us in the right position to see
[46:07] him
[46:09] that's a really strange way of saying
[46:12] just
[46:12] humble yourself to whatever god has in
[46:15] store for your life
[46:16] i think it's going to be so simple and
[46:18] it's going to be so humble and there's
[46:20] not going to be any great accolades
[46:21] remember what god calls great man will
[46:23] call foolish
[46:24] it could be i've even thought this we
[46:27] know brother branham said when i and my
[46:28] father are one and these other things
[46:30] when they begin to say those things
[46:31] right
[46:32] could it be that i may not actually be
[46:34] able to verbalize it in this right way
[46:36] but you watch my life
[46:38] my life will declare the life of my
[46:40] father living in me
[46:42] you watch my reactions to my wife if she
[46:44] doesn't talk to me right
[46:46] will my father be present manifesting in
[46:48] me you watch a brother
[46:50] at work who's ridiculed and made fun of
[46:53] what
[46:53] presence will be manifested there maybe
[46:55] it'll be the presence of his father
[46:57] manifesting
[46:58] expressing a different life that he once
[47:00] could not live
[47:01] see it's going to be so simple it's
[47:03] going to be so humble
[47:05] it's going to be isaiah 53 all over
[47:07] again
[47:08] there'll be no beauty that we should
[47:09] behold it none whatsoever
[47:12] there'll be no great accolades and no
[47:14] standing applauses for you
[47:17] in the eyes of the people but god will
[47:19] take attention to it
[47:20] i believe with all my heart god will
[47:22] take attention to that remember he even
[47:24] said in god calling the conference he
[47:25] even asked his son son do you want to go
[47:27] to that cross
[47:28] do you want to go pay that price you're
[47:30] going to be humiliated you're going to
[47:31] be rejected by
[47:32] everybody you want to do it
[47:36] yeah i want to fulfill the will of god i
[47:39] want his will
[47:40] not my will be done so whatever purpose
[47:42] he has in mind in these things
[47:44] i just want to submit myself to it
[47:48] um i might read this if it's okay
[47:52] a couple of things i i i didn't think
[47:54] i'd be long because i just
[47:55] my notes you know they bothered me
[48:00] um i want to read this about
[48:04] moses he said god won't leave his
[48:07] program
[48:08] that's the reason we know that it has to
[48:10] be simple
[48:12] now he always works in simplicity but
[48:14] god in the beginning
[48:16] that could have made the son to preach
[48:17] the gospel he could have made the wins
[48:19] to preach the gospel or an
[48:20] angel preached the gospel he could
[48:22] ordain men that
[48:23] for but he ordained men for that purpose
[48:26] and he never changed it
[48:27] he never ordained he never ordained
[48:31] denominations nor did he ordain groups
[48:33] of men ordained
[48:34] but he ordained a man to preach the
[48:36] gospel not machinery or mechanical
[48:38] devices
[48:40] and when he brought deliverance to the
[48:41] people down there he sent a simple human
[48:44] being born of a simple
[48:45] family a bunch of slaves what a god he
[48:48] is unfolding himself in that simplicity
[48:52] now notice he had had the training of
[48:54] worldly wisdom
[48:55] so that he could so that he could fail
[48:59] and show that it isn't by wisdom that we
[49:02] will
[49:02] ever be delivered by it is by faith that
[49:06] we
[49:06] are delivered he let him go in and get
[49:10] such an education until he could teach
[49:12] the egyptians wisdom
[49:14] he was so smart god was with
[49:17] this that simple family who could
[49:20] perhaps
[49:20] not even write their name and moses took
[49:23] the highest of their schooling and was
[49:25] with such a great education until he
[49:27] could teach
[49:28] wisdom to their teachers he could teach
[49:31] geniuses
[49:33] yes and god let him get that way just to
[49:35] display
[49:36] himself in humility and to show that
[49:39] wisdom has absolutely
[49:40] nothing to do with it moses miserably
[49:44] failed in his genius and he let him get
[49:47] that way
[49:48] for that purpose so that he would fail
[49:51] and he did fail and he fell
[49:55] so you see it's not by power nor by
[49:58] might
[49:59] but by not by the wisdom of the
[50:02] egyptians and not by the wisdom of your
[50:04] schools
[50:05] it's not by the power of our seminaries
[50:07] and it's not how
[50:08] not by the amounts of our organization
[50:11] but it's
[50:12] and not by the power of scholarly
[50:14] teaching but it is by my spirit
[50:17] saith the lord amen
[50:20] i am resting in the fact that i believe
[50:24] his promises to me musicians come
[50:28] it's one of those things it's like once
[50:29] i say what i feel to say i'm done
[50:31] i'm sorry guys it's a wednesday night
[50:34] you won't be upset with me i hope not
[50:36] musicians come um
[50:41] it's maybe too simple maybe it's
[50:42] supposed to be simple
[50:45] the devil complicates things the devil
[50:47] gets you twisted up not know what's up
[50:49] and what's down
[50:50] and god comes in such simplicity he
[50:53] makes it simple do you understand what
[50:54] i'm saying
[50:55] don't stumble at the simplicity of his
[50:57] unveiling
[50:58] he's going to continually unveil himself
[51:00] in simplicity
[51:02] it started off that way in the beginning
[51:03] it will finish that way at the end
[51:05] and it was i love the fact that brother
[51:08] branham said
[51:09] that bloody lamb came to take the book
[51:11] that book of redemption
[51:12] that abstract title deed and he said he
[51:16] was a bloody lamb he said where did he
[51:18] where did where did those what happened
[51:20] he says there he was in the garden of
[51:22] gethsemane
[51:23] bleeding great drops of blood so he took
[51:26] his fatal blow right there in the garden
[51:28] and he fulfilled his purpose
[51:30] on the cross but he took a fatal blow
[51:33] he took a fatal blow to his own will and
[51:36] he died right there
[51:38] jesus's will died in the garden and i
[51:41] believe it was precious in the sight of
[51:43] the lord
[51:44] now the question is whose will will die
[51:46] next
[51:47] whose funeral am i preaching tonight am
[51:51] i preaching a funeral
[51:52] i don't know i'm probably just preaching
[51:54] my own
[51:56] but i think god has a purpose in these
[51:59] these things
[52:00] they look strange sometimes and they
[52:03] come across strange
[52:05] but i'm convinced that god's doing
[52:07] something
[52:08] i really am um
[52:12] i'll read this scripture while you stand
[52:13] with me
[52:19] but what things were gained to me i
[52:22] counted for loss for christ
[52:24] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[52:26] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[52:28] of christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[52:31] suffered the loss of all things and do
[52:33] count them but done
[52:34] that i may win christ and be found in
[52:36] him not having mine own
[52:38] righteousness which is of the law but
[52:41] that which is through
[52:42] the faith of christ the righteousness
[52:44] which is of god by faith
[52:46] that i may know him and the power of his
[52:49] resurrection
[52:50] and the fellowship of his sufferings and
[52:52] be made inconformable
[52:54] unto his death if by any means i might
[52:57] attain into the resurrection of the dead
[53:00] and brother branham said this and he
[53:02] said
[53:04] investments but we can we can be a good
[53:07] church member
[53:08] and morally right not to
[53:11] still not obtain eternal life not to
[53:14] know the word
[53:15] some of them are theologians and
[53:16] scholars and sunday school teachers and
[53:18] bible expositors
[53:20] but that doesn't mean anything satan
[53:22] knows the bible better than all of us
[53:24] the bible said to know him is life to
[53:27] know him
[53:28] is life
[53:31] i want to know him i want to know him in
[53:34] the fellowship of his sufferings
[53:36] whatever sufferings he's laid for me i
[53:38] want to say that's okay
[53:39] if that gets me in the condition that
[53:41] you want that's okay with me
[53:45] just bow our heads for a word of prayer
[53:48] lord we come before you now
[53:52] um thankful lord lord we're thankful for
[53:55] your grace
[53:56] we're thankful for the fact that you're
[53:58] more interested in our character than
[54:00] our comforts
[54:02] and lord we want to thank you for all
[54:04] the blessings that 2020 brought us
[54:08] strange to say but i know it was a
[54:10] blessing in disguise for the bride
[54:12] and lord we know that she's got to be in
[54:15] the right position
[54:16] or the right condition i should say so
[54:19] that her great position can be fulfilled
[54:21] in redemption's plan and story and i
[54:25] just pray lord that you would help us
[54:27] each as individuals to never complain
[54:30] never
[54:31] argue or be upset with whatever god
[54:34] brings our way
[54:37] to get us to draw us closer to you
[54:40] father
[54:41] we know that that's your great purpose
[54:43] in every difficulty and every trial is
[54:46] lord you put bits in their mouth and you
[54:48] use them to draw us right up into your
[54:49] presence and we're so thankful for that
[54:52] so father god we just commit ourselves
[54:54] to you this this new
[54:56] year of fresh and anew forgive me lord
[54:58] for maybe i wasn't looking at things
[55:00] through the eyes of simplicity like i
[55:02] should have been
[55:03] and times gone past lord i pray that
[55:06] you'd help me to see
[55:07] things just the way you want us to see
[55:09] him help us as a people to see
[55:12] the simplicity of your reality in our
[55:14] midst father
[55:16] i pray lord that you would help us lord
[55:19] take our hand and continue to guide us
[55:21] which you have done in the past and we
[55:23] believe you will continue to do
[55:25] we commit the words that have been said
[55:27] in their broken up way to you father and
[55:29] to the people
[55:30] may they lord serve their purpose and we
[55:32] know they will
[55:34] lord your word will never return unto
[55:35] your void i just pray lord that you
[55:38] would bless your people
[55:39] and bless us as we go home that we can
[55:42] be better
[55:43] servants to you and better expressions
[55:46] of your desire
[55:47] lord we love you we commit ourselves to
[55:49] you in jesus name
[55:50] amen amen

[56:09] political changes come our way

[58:53] god was preaching that brother branham
[58:55] got to the seventh seal
[58:57] when he got to the seventh seal he said
[58:59] see i'd how did i know how did i know a
[59:01] week ago sunday when i said
[59:04] get simple it's got to be simple god
[59:06] hiding himself in simplicity
[59:07] how did i know that i was talking about
[59:09] this now
[59:11] brother branham tied the seventh steel
[59:13] to god hiding himself in simplicity
[59:16] in the seventh seal because it's simple
[59:19] it's not what you do it's what he does
[59:21] through you
[59:22] that's the simplicity of the seven seal
[59:25] it's not a life you live it's a life he
[59:26] lives through you but what he's
[59:28] got to do he's got to get us to lose
[59:30] confidence in our life
[59:31] confidence in our will confidence and
[59:33] lose confidence in all of our ability
[59:35] so that we can just surrender to the
[59:37] word and be humble and be simple and let
[59:40] him
[59:40] do what he's always purposed to do
[59:44] he had a purpose for moses but he had to
[59:46] get moses into condition where moses
[59:48] would just surrender
[59:49] and just simply do what god do it god's
[59:51] way
[59:53] right paul paul was a a chosen vessel of
[59:57] god but paul had too much education too
[59:59] much
[59:59] ability he had letters from the high
[1:00:01] priest
[1:00:03] and god washed all other way so that he
[1:00:06] would just do it god's way
[1:00:09] and sometimes we go through things and
[1:00:11] we have trials and difficulties they
[1:00:13] humble us they break us
[1:00:14] but i think we just have to keep
[1:00:16] learning that we've got to just
[1:00:17] surrender and do it god's way
[1:00:20] he doesn't need our ability he doesn't
[1:00:22] need our
[1:00:23] our great intellect he doesn't need our
[1:00:25] strength what he just needs is a
[1:00:27] surrendered willing vest
[1:00:30] and i say that's what i want to give you
[1:00:32] lord
[1:00:33] in every trial that proves that he's a
[1:00:36] faithful
[1:00:37] loving father but also gets me to lose
[1:00:39] confidence in myself
[1:00:41] i call it a good trial every difficulty
[1:00:45] that gets me to
[1:00:46] to forget about my my my abilities
[1:00:50] and that i can do nothing but proves
[1:00:53] that he's my heavenly father and he'll
[1:00:54] watch over me
[1:00:56] i say that was a good trial
[1:00:59] amen as we move forward like kyle said
[1:01:03] things are changing they're changing
[1:01:04] fast whether they get worse whether they
[1:01:06] get better
[1:01:07] or they get worse then get better they
[1:01:08] get worse again who knows
[1:01:11] but you know what there's one thing i
[1:01:13] care about i want to be exactly what he
[1:01:15] wants me to be
[1:01:17] where he wants me to be and i want to
[1:01:19] trust him
[1:01:20] through it all sometimes i i
[1:01:24] watch as myself and others as we get so
[1:01:26] bent out of shape about things get so
[1:01:29] upset and start the words that come out
[1:01:31] of our mouth sometimes
[1:01:33] i think we act like we have no heavenly
[1:01:36] father we get
[1:01:38] so upset and so angry and we just act
[1:01:41] like god's not in charge
[1:01:43] and that he doesn't know what's
[1:01:44] happening and we start saying
[1:01:46] this is wrong and this is wrong and how
[1:01:48] can this happen and how can they do that
[1:01:50] and i could say they can do nothing
[1:01:52] unless god permits it
[1:01:56] and and you just wait until the very
[1:01:59] thing that god
[1:01:59] god promised us through a prophet starts
[1:02:01] to happen when it begins to tighten up
[1:02:03] and we begin to lose religious freedom
[1:02:05] and start to find religious restrictions
[1:02:08] placed upon us
[1:02:09] and what's going to come out of our
[1:02:10] mouth then
[1:02:13] how can they they can't this and that
[1:02:17] i want you to say lord i'm trusting in
[1:02:21] you
[1:02:23] if you realize through the bible all
[1:02:25] those supernatural things that we found
[1:02:27] in the bible
[1:02:28] and we look at the wilderness journey
[1:02:29] and all the supernatural that god did
[1:02:31] every time god did that supernatural
[1:02:34] unbelievable miracles that had never
[1:02:36] been seen on earth
[1:02:37] it always come at a time of absolute
[1:02:39] weakness and brokenness
[1:02:40] and complete inability
[1:02:45] how many want to see the supernatural
[1:02:48] you put your hand up
[1:02:50] you said yes god does it in a way that
[1:02:54] he's the only one that gets credit for
[1:02:56] it
[1:02:56] he does it in a way that you know you
[1:02:58] had nothing to do with it it wasn't you
[1:03:00] you couldn't do it
[1:03:01] you weren't spiritual enough smart
[1:03:02] enough and you couldn't quote enough
[1:03:04] quotes or scriptures
[1:03:06] because all that your human ability
[1:03:08] failed you but god came through anyways
[1:03:10] and he gets all the credit we've got
[1:03:13] good days ahead of us
[1:03:15] may not be good for the flesh but it'd
[1:03:16] be good for the soul
[1:03:19] and that's the part that i care about
[1:03:20] more than anything
[1:03:22] because when god bless you amen god
[1:03:25] bless you as you go
[1:03:26] god be with you and we're going to sing
[1:03:28] stay and pray and worship as long as you
[1:03:30] like
