TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Well, they're holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up the ladder and I'm going home at the top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there will be. And the angels are holding up this ladder for me. Well, as I climb this gospel ladder, always heeding every sign. And I know my Savior's with me and he's teaching me to climb. Every day that I am climbing, there's a battle for me. Every step on this ladder is another victory. Well, they're holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder and I'm going home at the top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there will be. And the angels are holding up this ladder for me. There's a mansion being built for me somewhere in glory land. And this ladder that I'm climbing is a part of the plan. I can hear the angels backing. Keep climbing. Don't stop. There's a crowd of life awaiting you when you reach the top. Where they're holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder and I'm going home at the top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there will be. And the angels are holding up this ladder for me. Come on, you Christian soldiers. Show this world your light can shine. Get on board this gospel ladder and don't be afraid to climb. Can't you hear the angels cheering? Soon the battle will be over. And we'll celebrate this victory when we reach the other shore. We holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder and I'm going home at the top of this ladder. What joy there will be. And the angels are holding up this ladder for me. Well, they're holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder. And I'm going home at the top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there will be. And the angels are holding up this love for me. Let's go to E flat. Well, I'm a pilgrim and a stranger. I'm wandering through this world of sin. I'm on my way to that fair city. When the saints go maring in. When the saints go marching in, when the saints go maring in, Lord, I want to be in that number when the saints go maring in. Oh, I know I'll see my Savior if my life is free from sin. Heaven's doors will open for me. When the saints go maring in. Oh, when the saints go marching in. [Music] When the saints go marching in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number. When the saints go marching in and when we gather around the throne and the gates are closed within I'll be shouting glory glory when the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go marching in, when the saints go marching in, oh Lord, I want to be in that number. When the saints go maring and when they crown when they crown him king of kings when they crown him king of kings. Lord I want to be in that number when they crown him king of kings. When the saints When the saints go marching in. When the saints go maring in. Oh Lord, I want to be in that number. When the saints go marching in, well, I'm a pilgrim and a stranger. Wondering through this world of sin. I'm on my way to that fair city. When the saints are marching, [Music] you ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just tell you why. It's because my sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, "My sins are gone." For there underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary, as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Was at the old time altar where God came in my heart. And now my sins are gone. The Lord took full possession. The devil did depart. I'm glad. So very glad my sins are gone. Over there underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me down, I say my sins are gone. You got me into trouble. But Jesus got me out. I'm glad. Oh, my sins are gone. for there underneath the blood of the cross of Calvary. As far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. and living below in this old sinful world. Hardly a comfort can afford striving alone to face temptation. So where could I go but to the Lord? Where could I go? Where could I go? Seeking the refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to save me in the end. Singing where could I go but to the Lord once more. And where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. For my soul. Needing a friend to save me in the end. We're singing. Where could I go but to the Lord once more? And where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking the refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to save me. In the end, we're singing, "Where could I go but to the Lord?" Here we are. lifting our hands to you. [Music] Here we are giving you thanks for all you do. as we praise and worship your holy name. [Music] You are here [Music] within. &gt;&gt; As brother Chad comes this evening, let's sing verse one. For every answered prayer, [Music] you'll always be there. Oh, for love that hears us when we call, for arms that lift us when we fall. You have always been right beside us. Leading all along the way. And we made it through [Music] because of you. Here we are lifting our hands to you. Here we are giving you praise for all you do. you as we praise [Music] and worship your holy name. Oh, you are here dwelling within our praise for days we cannot see. For days we cannot see. For all is yet to be the trials we may have to face, but will be leaning on your grace. It will be your strength that saves us. Your love that makes us strong. And through it all, we'll sing this song. [Music] Here we are. [Music] Lifting our hands to you. [Music] Here we are. We're giving you praise for all you do as we pray [Music] and worship your holy name. [Music] You are here dwelling within our grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Oh, heavenly father, how we love you, Lord. How we're so thankful, Lord, that you've given us the permission, the allowance, the opportunity to lift our voice, to lift our hands and tell you that we love you. And God, we've gathered here at your bidding. You've drawn us to yourself, Lord. And we've come, Lord, to hear from you. We've come to receive from you. And God, we've come to give to you, Lord. To give you our hearts, to give you our praises, to give you our worship. And Lord, we've come to receive from you your word, Lord, and your spirit. May you come and fill us, Lord. And may you feed us, God. And God, I pray you take this vessel under your control and speak those words that are so needful in this hour, Lord. And may the right word strike the heart and meet the need of your children, Lord. May it bring results, Lord. For your word doesn't go in vain, Lord, but it'll accomplish what you sent it for. And I pray it would do so tonight, Lord. May your spirit empower us to hear and to receive all that you have for us. We love you. We ask your blessing over it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. It's good to be here this evening. Amen. While you're standing, if you want to grab your Bibles and turn to Romans, we're going to go to Romans chapter 3 and get started there. Uh while you're turning there, I just want to uh let you know that I've asked Brother Jim Swanson to take the service for us this Sunday. So, Brother Jim will be ministering this Sunday. So, I'm sure he'll appreciate your prayers. I know I always appreciate your prayers. I'm sure he will, too. So, we're looking forward to hearing from the Lord on Sunday. Amen. I'm going to continue on with this thought. I've been on the last two services on the message of grace and grace and works and and uh and and then we'll just see how the Lord leads. I never imagined when I started looking at this subject I would preach three services on it. Didn't dream on it. But I' I've been enjoying myself so much. Amen. It's been such a blessing. And it's amazing how you can go back to the fundamental teachings of Christianity that Christians have been talking about for 2,000 years. But in the light of the message of the hour, everything expands. every doctrine, every teaching, every scripture, it expands. And I I just love God for that. Amen. Let's look at Romans chapter 3 23 together. Romans 3 and 23. For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That all includes me. I'm sure it includes you, too. For all have sinned and come short of the glory go of God, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through the faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God. To declare, I say at this time his righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. Amen. God bless you. May you you may have your seats. If you look uh quickly back here uh in verse 23 again, I'm just want to go over 23 and 24. says, "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his grace." Amen. That's so exciting because I don't have to pay anything. He paid it. Amen. It's freely by his grace. And by the death of Jesus Christ, his grace is bestowed freely upon us through Christ. Amen. And so, I'm so thankful that he said freely. Amen. I don't have to earn it. I don't have to work my way up to it. I don't have to be a good boy for a certain period of time before I can receive his grace. Amen. I've been justified freely by his grace. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so this this uh Yeah, we got the slide up. So this uh um subject we're going to look at, we're going to keep looking up like we did on Sunday on grace and works, but we're going to look at grace and works in the book of Ephesians. And brother Brandham's going to, you know, explain some things through the book of Ephesians for us. And so we're going to take a look at that. So tonight's going to be a bit of a Bible study. I want to go chapter by chapter through the book of Ephesians and I'm going to read segments out of each chapter and we're going to see what brother Benham's talking about. Amen. In this Ephesians and you'll see what I mean here in a minute uh as we get to the quotes. And so I hope none of you are tired and I hope nobody falls asleep and it's okay if you fall asleep. We'll let you stand and read the segment in the next chapter. Amen. I got to do something to make you eager to stay awake. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so yeah, this is going to be like oldfashioned Bible study, which we haven't done for a while, but I I love it and I'm excited to do it. And and there's times that Brother Ben says things and, you know, we we hear him say things over and over again and they become true to us and we understand the truth of it and is real and we believe it, but sometimes it becomes so accepted that we actually don't go back and dig into what he was saying. And so sometimes it's fun to do that. And so tonight, hopefully we can uh I want to look at James. If you can turn with me to James chapter 2, I'm going to here we looked in Romans at a scripture that has to do with grace. In James, we're going to look at works and go to the book of James. Now, I'm so glad that God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; because if God had not sent us a prophet, amen, we would read uh book of Romans and read what Paul writes about grace being bestowed upon us freely without the works of the law. Then we would go to read James and James is seemingly saying something exactly opposite of what's Paul's saying. And if God hadn't sent a prophet, we would just decide which ones we want to read. &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't deny I mean, if we were Bible believing Christian, we wouldn't deny James. We wouldn't say James is wrong, but we would just kind of breeze over it, not know what to do with it or how to handle it, and then just skip over it. That's what we did when I was raised, you know, as a boy. But by the grace of God, Amen. The Bible became a new book. We had a prophet who who interpreted all the writing on the outside of the pyramid, restored us back to the apostolic teaching of the fathers so that we wouldn't have to just skim through stuff. Amen. But he would break it down for us so that we understand there's no contradiction in the word of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So when we come to the book of James, let's just read first chapter 2 uh verse 17. He says, "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead being alone." This is amazing because I Paul spent some quite a bit of time in in Romans and in Galatians uh explaining to us that we've been saved without the works of the law. that it has nothing to do with works and and works is excluded because of faith and and all of these things and that even the righteousness was imputed unto Abraham because he believed &gt;&gt; without works. It was imputed him without works. And so uh uh he spent quite a bit of time in that. And so now it comes in James is telling us that faith if it has not works is dead being alone. How can faith be dead if faith brought me to salvation and brought me to life? But he said, "Faith without works is dead." &gt;&gt; Okay, let's just keep reading. &gt;&gt; Yeah, a man may say, "Thou has faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God. Thou doest well. The devils also believe and tremble." But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seeest thou how faith wrought with his works? And by works was faith made perfect. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now he tells us something that seems opposite what Paul told us. Paul told us Abraham was justified by faith apart from works. Now he says, "Abraham our father was justified by works &gt;&gt; when he offered Isaac." &gt;&gt; This is where I thank God he sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Every single time I come across it, I thank God that he sent us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we'll get into some of the things Brother Bam says about this, but I want to first look at this last verse. This verse 22. sees thou how faith uh faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect. I want to look at this and break this down this one scripture down for just a moment because how can works make faith perfect? Faith is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace through faith and that of yourselves is a gift of God. And by that faith, Amen, we can enter in by the grace of God. We have access to God. Amen. Through this faith by his grace. So it it's it's it's only by faith. So how can works make faith perfect? Amen. I thought faith was all I needed. Faith in Christ Jesus would bring me into righteousness, bring me into the atonement. Amen. Bring me into salvation. So So what is what is James saying? And I you find out James is not saying what we initially think James is saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's no contradiction in the Bible. So in James uh 2:22, seeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect. So faith wrought with his works. This term wrought with, what does this mean in the Bible? It's this it's this Greek word here. It means to work with, to help with, workers together work together. So faith was working together with works. &gt;&gt; They were not in any ways contrary to each other. They were in partnership for the work of God. So faith was helping with working with working together with uh works. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now now we know that works without faith doesn't do any good for the kingdom of God. It has to be works with faith. They have to be a partnership here. &gt;&gt; They have to be working together. So faith wrought with his works. Worked together was helping his works. Amen. This is important because if if we go to the legalist side and we just go to works where somebody can preach to me a standard and have a church standard or a creed and I through a certain amount of willpower, amen, can do all of those works. But if I do those works without the genuine faith and salvation, the the the true faith that is a gift of God, amen, it doesn't do me any good whatsoever towards salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I have to start my bases on faith. I've got to believe I can do all of that. But if I don't believe the word, if I don't have true faith in my heart, it does me no good. But if I have true faith in my heart, that faith will work together with my works for the for the kingdom of God. Now, let's go to the to the next step. Uh let's go to the definition. Now says to work together, help in work, be partner in labor. That's what that's how faith wrought with my works. It was a partner together in the labor. It wasn't works apart from faith. It was faith empowering the works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To put forth power together with and thereby to assist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. That's what faith does for us. &gt;&gt; All right. And now let's look at this word perfect. Because now faith wrought with works and by works was faith made perfect. This is what this is what is a little bit uh uh uh um uh this is where we can get a misunderstanding by saying faith works makes faith perfect. Amen. But this word perfect is not the way we typically use the English word perfect. Amen. As in as in flawless without flaw. Amen. This is a different meaning. And let's look here at the meaning. This is the Greek word here out of the concordance says make perfect, perfect, finish, fulfill, be perfect, consecrate. Now the real understanding is going to come when we look at the definitions in the concordance. And so the definitions say to make perfect, complete, to carry through completely, to accomplish, finish, to bring to an end. &gt;&gt; All right. Now the next one is to complete perfect add what is yet wanting in order to render a thing full to be found perfect. Now this is my favorite. To bring to the end proposed to bring to the end the goal that's proposed. &gt;&gt; So what is works? How does works make my faith perfect? Because God has something he wants done. Amen. And he wants to do it. And he's got to have people who believe in the word and hear the word. But God didn't want us just to believe the hear word and hear the word. He wants something to be done. &gt;&gt; So when by faith in the anointing of the Holy Ghost, we do the works, we now are bringing to the end the goal of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's how we're perfecting faith because we're bringing the goal of faith to fruition. Amen. To manifestation because God didn't say, "Amen, I just give my word and I want you to believe and that's all you have to do. Now go die." Amen. No. But he wanted us to believe because he wants to use his children who believe and fill them with his spirit so that they can flesh out the word that they believe and the word can come into manifestation. And when that word comes into manifestation, it'll perfect faith &gt;&gt; or fulfill or accomplish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What faith is. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; To accomplish, to bring to a close or fulfillment by event. prophecies of the scriptures. So now we look at that little word perfect and it says, you know, faith wrought with our works. Amen. And by works was faith made perfect. It almost made it look like faith wasn't enough. You know, faith wasn't sufficient. I needed works to perfect my faith. Well, if you're thinking of perfect as uh uh uh something that is is perfect now is without flaw or something that is absolutely spotless or absolutely pristine and faith couldn't be that without works and we got the wrong understanding completely and so faith was insufficient. Faith is perfectly sufficient friends. But faith came to do something. And when faith moves us to do the something it was supposed to do, that's the completion of faith. And so faith is empowering or helping the works. So the works are the works of God, not our works, his works. And those works are the completion of the faith that came to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why when I read James and I I I I when I read it, I said, "It doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't add up to what Paul's saying. I don't understand it. What did the prophet say?" Amen. What does it mean? Now, all of a sudden, it begins to unlock. And it it's actually super simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "Abraham was justified by Paul by faith, but by James by works." Abraham was talking what God saw. He he means Paul here was talking what God saw and James was talking what man saw. Show me your faith by your works without your works and so forth. See, then if you don't have works with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth. &gt;&gt; But if you really got faith, you believe it and act like it. That's right. Put it in action. &gt;&gt; This is where Brother Ben's making it simple. He says Paul is looking from the reference of God. And when Abraham believed that was enough for God. &gt;&gt; God imputed righteousness unto him or put on him or put into his account righteousness because he believed. &gt;&gt; But when James is looking at Abraham, he's looking from an earthly human perspective. And and Abraham's faith was made perfect, completed, finished, brought about its purpose. Amen. when he offered up Isaac, showing that he truly believed God &gt;&gt; and did what God said. Amen. So God, listen, this is why um so many modern modern this modern teaching in the modern age throughout Christianity is God looks at my heart. It doesn't matter what I do. &gt;&gt; Anybody heard the extreme grace preaching that has become very popular in Leodysia because it suits the Leodysian nature. my rights, people's rights, right? And and uh so now this extreme grace says God looks at my heart, doesn't matter what I do. Well, there's there's a a a a measure of truth to what they're saying that God saved me uh separate completely separate from my works &gt;&gt; because when he saved me, I wasn't even born yet. Amen. And then, amen, he was watching over me and securing me while I was doing all the wrong works. &gt;&gt; And he didn't save me because I started doing right works. He came and found me. Amen. When I was still doing the wrong works. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, so God, from Paul's perspective, from the heavenly perspective, God is looking at he's looking for somebody who will believe his word. Amen. And he recognizes faith and then he sealed his faith with circumcision. God is looking for faith and he'll seal that faith with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for God, that's enough. You're sealed to the day of redemption. That faith was what? Faith was what acquired it. Faith was what triggered it. Faith was what apprehended it. Amen. And God imputed unto us righteousness. The same way. Amen. But yet, God wants his word made manifest on this earth. God wants his word to live in every age. He wants his word to be demonstrated in every age. Amen. So there's got to be a testimony to every age that the word is true. And that testimony is our works. &gt;&gt; And that's what man sees. &gt;&gt; And that's why works perfects faith &gt;&gt; because it accomplishes exactly what God sent us on this earth to do &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world. Listen friends, God sent us here to do works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he never intended works to be the basis of our salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's got something for us to do. And that something for us to do is to live his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To display his nature, to be a manifestation of Jesus Christ on the earth in a many membered body. That's what he wants us to do. That's why when we say we have faith and don't have works, it's dead because it's not accomplishing what God wanted it to accomplish. &gt;&gt; But when faith is wrought together with works, not just doing something because somebody said it, but the actual works of God that's anointed by faith, those works, amen, are perfecting faith and accomplishing God's purpose on the earth. Amen. This is why, and we're going to get into more quotes. This is why brother Brandham said, he goes, "I'm a legalist." That brother Brandham was a million miles from being a legalist and in what we term as legalist, but he believed in doing right. He believed in fulfilling the word. He believed in obeying the commands. That's what I believe he's referring to when he say, "I'm a legalist." He didn't believe it was optional if you want to or not to. He believed that God's commandment deserved obedience. &gt;&gt; And then that was the right thing for a Christian to do is obey the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he never he never taught that that was a basis for salvation or if you can do everything right, it means you're saved. No, you're saved by faith by faith alone. Amen. But that faith now, amen, brings you into the kingdom of the God and the knowledge of Jesus Christ and opens up the word to you and and also gives you the power to live the word that you see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let let's continue on. Uh in 2 Timothy 1:9 he says, "Who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." So I'm bouncing back and forth between grace and works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham was able to take from both sides and stick it together right in the middle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's first Thessalonians 4:1. Furthermore, when he we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more. For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication, that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the lust of concupisitions, even as the Gentiles which know not God, that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter, because that the Lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testify. For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. So this is Paul who taught grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's unusual or odd. How do I say this? &gt;&gt; I don't know how to say it. You know, so many times you get you're not I'm not premeditated. I don't know what I'm going to say, but I got something on my heart to say, and I don't know how to say because I want to say it in a very very nice way. But you have people who say the gospel is not dos and don'ts. Then what's Paul talking about? &gt;&gt; He's saying don't do this. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. &gt;&gt; You should do this. So like if it's not dos and don'ts, I don't understand over 50% of the New Testament &gt;&gt; because so much of the New Testament is telling us how to behave, &gt;&gt; what God's pleased with, what he's not pleased with. So you say that it became fashionable in the end time in Leodysia to say the gospel is not dos and don'ts. But then what is Paul talking about? What's Peter talking about? What's Jude talking about? What's James talking about when they're telling us don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, do this, and do &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's dos and don'ts, but it's not the basis for salvation. It won't bring you into salvation. You've got to come by faith and faith alone. You're justified by faith. Amen. By the grace of God alone, apart from anything you ever did. And if you never get anything right, you're still saved. But then after after Paul brings to them the message of grace, he starts telling them, "Now make sure you do this and make sure you do that and make sure you don't do this and make sure you don't do that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this old term, it's not dos and don'ts. I I sometimes I scratch my head at that and puzzle and say, "I I don't know what you're talking about." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh as if God doesn't care what you do every day with your life. &gt;&gt; As if it doesn't matter to him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's not He didn't save me so I can go live my own life. He saved me so I could surrender my life to him so he could live his life through me, which is according to his commandments. &gt;&gt; Amen. And trying to do God a service without being his will. He says he only reveals this word in the predestinated. Now, when I use that word predestiny, now it's a bad word to use in public, especially when we have mixed crowd between the Armenians and the Calvinist. And I I've asked you not to think I I know it all, but they're both wrong according to the scripture. Grace is what God did for me. Works is what I do for him. We talked about this on uh uh on Sunday. I never remember what day it is. Every time I'm here, it's Sunday. Even when it's Wednesday, it's Sunday. So, you'll have to forgive me, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Marriage and divorce. He says, it's just like today. I read this quote Sunday. There's two great schools of doctrine in the church. One of them is Calvinism. The other are Arminianism. One of them is legalist. The other one is grace. And we come to find out that the people who believe in grace, the Calvinist, they say, "Bless God, it don't hurt me to smoke. It don't hurt me to drink. I can do these things. I've got eternal security." Then we find the other side on the legalist said, "Oh, would like to ball him out. I would like to show him a piece of my mind, but I'm a Christian. and I have to keep still. See, you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right. So, brother Bam is is making this so clear. Now, when we come to the conflict between Calvinism and Armenianism, listen, it it it would take a long time to explain in detail the difference in these two. even to understand one of them. It there's so much writing on it and I I've done some reading on it but just in the way brother Brandham is using it here he's trying to show us what the end result of extreme Calvinistic teaching and Arminian teaching does because Calvinistic teaching is that God saved me apart from me. It had nothing to do with me. It was by his will alone and I have nothing to do with it and I can't resist his will and I will do and I will come to him because he draw me and I can't stop it. Amen. because of his will and and his blood is covered at all. Amen. There's nothing wrong with that teaching until you take it to extreme measures. &gt;&gt; So, fundamentally, I mean, there's some problems with it fundamentally, but I'm not getting into the nitty-gritty. I'm just talking in a general term here. So, some of you theologians around just don't just don't pick on me. I'm just trying to get a little bitty summary. Okay? So, so in the Calvinistic teaching then it goes, well, I was always saved. I cannot be unsaved. I'm saved only by grace apart from any works that I can do. And it wasn't my choice. Amen. It was God's choice. Amen. And and it doesn't have anything to do with what I do. So, they take it to extreme Calvinism, not even really what Calvin taught. To the point now where my conduct does not matter because I'm saved by grace, a choice God made before the foundation world. So it's it's totally separate from what I do. Now, Brother Rem tells us that's true. &gt;&gt; But then they ignore a whole another section of the Bible where God wants us to live the live his life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; When you get into Armenianism, Armenianism say that God just made it possible to be saved. His grace is sending Jesus Christ and there's a possibility, but it's all up to you whether you choose to believe or not. It's not something God predetermined. Amen. It's something that you have the capacity to believe and you hold on to because if you don't hold on to it and you disobey and fall away, you could lose your salvation. &gt;&gt; So this is why brother Brandham talks about the Calvinism and Armenianism this way. He's saying one of them says bless God. It don't hurt me to smoke. It don't hurt me to drink. I can do these things. I've got eternal security. You can see that was the end of that doctrine. or when it brother V said went out on a limb &gt;&gt; not how it started Armenianism when it was all up to you to make your choice and it's based on your decision it's based on your actions now when you have wrong actions &gt;&gt; then you're out of the grace of God &gt;&gt; yeah right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and so now that's why he would say I would like to ball him out because there's no conversion in the heart there's only a conformity to a code I'd like to ball them out I'd like to show them a piece of my mind but I'm a Christian, I have to keep still. Why does he have to keep still? Cuz he could lose his salvation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's all based on his conduct, his ability to do right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, this is what brother Bam's referring to where these two things went out on a limb and got extreme in these two extreme attitudes. Now, he's going to bring him back to the middle. Amen. So, so you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right. little further down in the same quote, he says, "As long as I want to go do it, it's in my heart to do it." Whether I say, "As long as it's in my heart to do it, I go do it." Legalism won't let me do it is because that I know I'd get punished for doing it. But the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do it. That's the truth of it. There is the two schools, not legalism or other or Calvinism. It's both. And that's exactly what brother Brandham taught. He he taught elements of both. &gt;&gt; Elements of both. &gt;&gt; So in demonology, I'm going to read three quotes that tell us about the book of Ephesians. I'm going to read them right in the row. Then we're going to go to the book of Ephesians. He says in demonology, physical realm, he says, "Oh, let me correct this just a little bit or say something. Somebody's going to get away and say, Brother Brenham's a Calvinist." No, I'm not. I'm a Calvinist. as long as Calvin now Calvinist is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; But when Calvinist gets out of the Bible, them I'm an Armenian. See, I believe in holiness and I believe in Calvinist, too. But both of them, one run out on a limb went this way, one run on a limb went that way. If it wasn't for the book of Ephesians to bring it back and put it in the right place where God did, we'd all be all mixed up. &gt;&gt; But they both got a doctrine, but they go deceit on it. each one that's the holiness and the Calvinist too the Armenian then this next quote he says I believe that before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians 1 that God knew us and knew that he was sending me and the other ministers and so forth to preach the gospel before the world was ever formed. I believe that's scriptural teaching that's got a lot of Calvinistic wing to it. I believe the Calvinist was all right. They got a scripture to stand. So has the Armenian. But they both run out and ride on limbs, broke off, made issues. God just brought the whole thing back and stuck it in the book of Ephesians and straightened it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a way to know what's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother, I'm saying it's in the book of Ephesians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the waters of separation says, "One went to seed this way, other one went to seed that way." But I think the book of Ephesians brings them both right back and puts them in the stump where they belong. So I really like the book of Ephesians. It keeps it kind of keeps us straightened out, brethren, in our theology, doesn't it? The book of Ephesians. So who wants straightened out in your theology? So let's go look at the book of Ephesians together. Turn to Ephesians chapter 1. And brother Franco, if you could bring up the whiteboard for me. I'm going to use it for just a moment. Ephesians chapter 1 and I'm just going to go chapter by chapter and I'm just going to put se we're going to read together segments out of the chapter. Now I I'm going to look at this I we're just sailing through this looking at one concept one idea in a simplistic way. We're not deep diving. This is not a deep dive study in the book of Ephesians. We could do that maybe for a year or more but we're just going to do this skim through on this subject we're on. So, first of all, I want to look at Is that spelled right? Yeah. Well, at least that's the way it is in the message. It's good enough for me. So, let's look at the grace side and the works side. I'm just drawing this for a reference. But over here, if you take chapters one, two, and three is on the grace side. And over here, chapters four, five, and six is on the work side. So, it is split right down the middle. It it's exactly as brother Brandham told us that the truth of this is in Ephesians. It's brought together in the theology straightened out in Ephesians. And the first three chapters is about grace and the last three chapters deals with works. So let's start reading. Are we ready? &gt;&gt; Remember what happens if you fall asleep. &gt;&gt; Please don't forget Ephesians chapter 1 verse one. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. So how was Paul an apostle? By the will of God. Amen. Had nothing to do with Paul. To the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be unto you and peace from God our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us. First of all, I want you to know where do our blessings lie in heavenly places in Christ. Does that make your blessings secure? &gt;&gt; According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. So when did God choose you? &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. So after you started doing good works, before you had a chance to do either good or evil, he said, "Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated." Amen. we were chosen not from the foundation of the world but before before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. So what did he choose us for? To be holy and without blame before him in love. That's why he chose us in Christ because Christ would pay the price to make us holy and without blame. Not our conduct but Christ sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Five. having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself. So, so okay, let's read the whole verse. According to the good pleasure of his will. So, he has predestinated predetermined our destiny. Predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself. So, he has already predestinated us to adoption. &gt;&gt; What is adoption? An adoption is taking a son and as a son grows into maturity and placing him in the kingdom. We have been predestinated to be placed in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Before we did the good works that would warrant our placing, &gt;&gt; amen, right? &gt;&gt; You think think about this. Adoption has to do with a son. Amen. And when you're born again by the Holy Ghost, you're a son. But then that Holy Ghost becomes a tutor to lead you and grow you into the stature of a perfect man and bring you into a measure where God can use you to do a kingdom work and he can positionally place you. And as you grow up, amen, as brother Benham taught it in adoption, amen, the boy's got to get the lessons right. Amen. He's got to grow in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ. Got to grow in temperance and faith and and and and and virtue and all of these things until finally the father gets him to a place and he says, "He's old enough. He's grown enough. I can place him in position that comes by him overcoming obstacles, passing testes, growing. Amen. Growing in grace, growing in knowledge, growing in revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Growing in conduct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Brandham, in the adoption series, he goes, he says he gives a report on the bad son. Amen. He gives a report on the good son. The report on the bad son and says, "I'm I'm sorry. I'm ashamed to tell you, but your son, he's going out and he's carousing. He's wasting money and he's doing all of that." Amen. He wasn't ready for adoption. &gt;&gt; But the good son, he comes to him. He says, "Now listen, you should have seen the way he handled those sheep the other day, father. He did it just the way you would do it." What's happening? His works are coming to manifest the the will and desire of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he can be placed into adoption after that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But guess what? You were adopted unto sons before the foundation of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before you got it right, he already knew what position you would hold. He already knew where you belonged in the kingdom. And he already predestinated you to the adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And how did he do it? According to the pleasure of his will. Not what you were asking him to do. what he decided &gt;&gt; through the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. We did not become acceptable. He made us accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. None of that has anything to do with what you did. wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself, still has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. So, was God waiting for you to make a decision? Was God waiting for you to get it right? Was God waiting for you? &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. He already predetermined it. He already decided. He already knew what he was going to do. He already knew you were going to do it. &gt;&gt; And so, in whom we also obtained an inheritance. How did I obtain that inheritance? In him. Not anything I did. By being predestinated. Verse 12. That we should be to the praise of his glory. Who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. In whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of your inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; That sounds like pretty good Calvinistic teaching to me. &gt;&gt; You agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's good. Let's look at chapter 2. Let's skip over to chapter 2. Like I said, we could go into much more. We're just kind of breezing through. And it's hard to breeze through, but we're going to try. All right. Chapter 2, verse four. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved. So when were you quickened with with Christ? When you were dead in sins and trespasses. &gt;&gt; Not when you had repented. Not when you had made it right. Not when you had turned over a new leaf. Not when you finally decided that you were going to believe. No. When you were still dead in sins and and and uh trespasses. Uh he quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved. And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ. When did he do that? When he raised Christ. &gt;&gt; So where is your position in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? When was it determined? Before you had a chance to make a decision. Amen. He hath raised up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Calvinistic &gt;&gt; grace. He did it. Even the works you do, he's already ordained that you'll walk in them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Chapter 3, verse one. For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you, word, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in a few words, whereby when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now, revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles should be fellows, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel. Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. Unto me who am less than the least of the saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ. And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. to the intent now that that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith of him. He's telling us God gave me this revelation that he already decided he was going to have the Gentiles and it's all finished in Christ &gt;&gt; according to his eternal purpose. Not waiting to find out what you would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've come through three chapters. Remember our division? Is it still up there? So, now we're halfway through the book of Ephesians, and now we're going to start into chapter 4. We start into chapter four. We're going to see that Paul now uh uh uh uh it's almost like he changes tunes. Now, let's read it here in verse one. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called with all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace. &gt;&gt; Is that a commandment? &gt;&gt; Is that something you're supposed to do? Then he goes back and there's another mention of grace here in verse 7. In verse 7 he says, "But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ." So what was given to us, the grace of God was given to us. Amen. It's not something that we earned is according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Now let's jump down uh to verse uh 17. Remember, now remember what half of the book we're in. &gt;&gt; Are we in the grace or works half? &gt;&gt; Okay. This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling have given themselves over into lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness. But you have not so learned Christ. If so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness, and true holiness. Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor. For we are members one of another. Be ye angry and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath. Neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed into the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. &gt;&gt; That was a pile of don'ts. &gt;&gt; Are we in agreement? Yes. &gt;&gt; I mean, he said, "Don't do this, and don't do that, and don't do this, and don't do this, and don't do this, and don't do this, and don't do that." &gt;&gt; Like, I got tired reading the list of don'ts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how can we say it doesn't matter? &gt;&gt; How can we say that the the gospel doesn't matter? The word of God doesn't matter, what God inspired Paul doesn't matter. And also Paul is telling you, he says, he says, "Grieve not," this verse 30, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God." He's telling you not to grieve the Holy Spirit. That's something you have to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. What Paul is not saying is all you need to do is get the Holy Ghost. And once you get the Holy Ghost, then don't worry about anything. You don't have to do anything. The Holy Ghost will lead you what to do. So whatever you do is fine. He's saying, "No, you exercise your free will. You control the vessel you live in. And you don't you dare grieve the Holy Ghost. It's not as though I can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and say, "Now I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. God's in me. Whatever I feel to do, I'll do &gt;&gt; right." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want to tell anybody don't do this or don't do this. I just want the Holy Ghost to lead them. &gt;&gt; I don't want to tell them. I don't want to give instruction. I don't want to give teaching because now they've got the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will will lead them. I just need to keep hands off. That's not how Paul taught the gospel. Paul taught the gospel. Now that you got the Holy Ghost, now that you know you're a child of God. Now that you know it's apart from works, that you didn't earn it, you're accepted in the beloved, you had nothing to do with it. God chose you to adoption. Now God cares about how you live. Now don't go do the former things. Don't go do what the world does. Separate yourself. Live sanctified unto the purpose that God has called you to. &gt;&gt; And don't you grieve the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought the Holy Ghost would keep me from grieving the Holy Ghost. Yeah, he does. That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost. And when you grieve the Holy Ghost, you feel the grieving of the Holy Ghost and it brings you back in the repentance. But you have a choice to make. You've got free moral agency. You've got you're still a human vessel and you've got the will to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; And Paul's telling you, will yourself to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. Now let's go chapter five. Be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice for God for a sweet smelling savor. But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not once na be named among you as become a saint. neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks. For this you know that no whoreonger, no unclean person, no covetous man who is an idoltor hath an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord. walk as children of the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul opened their eyes and their understanding to grace. He opened their eyes to their their predestinated position in the adoption of sons in Jesus Christ. He tells them that they were accepted in the beloved all according to God's will. Everything was done even even you're saved by grace through works and by sorry saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves is a gift of God. Amen. not of works lest any man should boast. But you're created in Christ Jesus unto good works. You're created in him to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unto good works. But he already ordained them. It's not up to you. He's already ordained you what you're going to walk in. Now that you've come to this position as a son of God, now stop doing that. Don't do that. Don't chase the world. Don't let anybody deceive you by their vain words. Amen. Th those people are not worthy of inheritance. They won't receive an inheritance. You walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you were called. What was that vocation? You were called to be sons and daughters of God. Now walk accordingly. &gt;&gt; Paul's not saying you're ordained. You've got the Holy Ghost. You go figure it out. &gt;&gt; No, brother's so good to teach us we still live in a sticky cockab. &gt;&gt; We still live in a cockab flesh and sticky cocker nature that picks up things. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's why Paul would lay out in the book of Ephesians what you are by the grace of God and then what God wants you to do. Once you realize the grace of God and who you are, he wants you to be his son and he wants you to live like a son and he wants you to avoid the things that give a bad testimony and a poor representation of him and damage you and hurt you and hurt your testimony and and keep you from growing. That's right. Amen. We can never attain to the adoption living this way. &gt;&gt; Also, we can't get the modernistic idea of the denominational systems that, you know, we're born again, we've got the Holy Ghost, we believe in Jesus. Amen. We're going to heaven, everything's fine, and we don't we don't need to say anything to anybody. Listen, don't forget that it was Paul. Paul, the Apostle Paul, who told the people, you've got sin among you in the Corinthians. sin that's so much not even named among the Gentiles that a man would have his father's wife. And he said, "And you're puffed up with vanity, you're puffed up with pride, thinking that that won't hurt us. &gt;&gt; Leaving the sin among us won't hurt us." That's what he said. You're you're you're you're puffed up. Rather, you should be mourning, but you're puffed up. You just let it go. You don't do anything about it. And then what does Paul tell them to do about it? Paul tells them to take that person out of their midst and turn them over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh so that their soul can be saved. &gt;&gt; This is Paul's teaching. &gt;&gt; So this modernistic Leodysian gospel is not the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not the word of God. I want to go uh go a little further here. Let's go down to the next reading. Let's go to verse 15, same chapter. See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil. Paul's telling us how to spend our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's telling us to walk circumspectly. Be reflective. Think not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ tells us what not to do, but he also tells us what to do. &gt;&gt; It's not just because we're sons of God, and it's not just because we have the Holy Ghost that we automatically know the right things to do. Paul was giving them instruction and dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; And he was doing it because they were called to adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not so they can earn merit with God, but because they were the children of God, called to a position in God and had to grow into a position of adoption. So that they could serve the purpose of God on earth. Amen. They had to know avoid this and lean to this, avoid this and do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh verse 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. Verse 25. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it. Let's go to chapter six. Children, obey your parents in the Lord. For this is right. Honor thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well. Did he just take them back to one of the ten commandments? &gt;&gt; I thought we were done with the law. &gt;&gt; Children, obey your parents and the Lord, for this is right. Honor thy father and my m thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ. Not with eye service as men pleasers. He's telling you how to be an employee. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Not with eye service as men pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will, doing service as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall be received of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And ye masters, do the same thing unto them, forbearing, threatening, knowing that your master also is in heaven, neither is there respective person with him. He also taught us how to be a boss, &gt;&gt; how to be a servant, how to be a master, and he gave instructions. Amen. Listen, Paul wasn't leaving the church alone to figure it out on his own. He was anointed of the Holy Ghost to positionally place the church in the right order. And he's putting them in order. And to put them in order, he first has to tell them who they are by the grace of God. He's got to tell them, amen, that they've come to this position apart from works. That's what he does in Romans and Galatians. He's telling them that you never earned this. Amen. That this this this this is the mystery that God is going to include the Gentiles. You weren't even included in the law. You weren't even included. Amen. You didn't even know you were part of it. This is the great mystery that's been revealed by the grace of God that you're included, too. But you've been included under the measure of grace. &gt;&gt; And he positionally places them in the in the predestinated will of God. Amen. not depending on their will, not waiting for their decision and not waiting for their actions. God had already done it according to the pleasure of his goodwill and adopted uh and predestinated to adoption of children by Jesus Christ and Ford knew where they would go and what they would be and what they were going to accomplish on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's a great place to start. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now that you've come to this, let me tell you how you should walk." Amen. So that you know how to possess your vessel. Right? &gt;&gt; That's what he's teaching that. Hey, listen. Wait. I'm going to teach you how to walk in the vocation where we've been called. You got to be circumspect. You got to be thoughtful. You got to forsake the old ways. You got to give up all the old things and the old lust and everything of the world. Amen. And you've got to come to uh uh the holiness. And you've got to come to sanctification. You've got to have a separated life. Amen. And you've got to live clean in your mind and clean in your body. Sing songs and meditate on the things of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not for salvation. &gt;&gt; Not for merit. &gt;&gt; Not for benefits. &gt;&gt; We already got all that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But so that we can fulfill our purpose &gt;&gt; on the earth. So that we can be pleasing to the Lord. because what's pleasing to him to do his will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why David was a man after God's own heart. He told us in the book of Acts, I've chose David, a man after my own heart, who would do all my will. &gt;&gt; And I want to be after the heart of God and I want to please God. And if God thought enough to tell us what he likes and what he doesn't like, what he wants us to do and not wants us to do, then there's something there's a gratitude inside of me for the understanding of what grace really is. There's something in me that wants to do everything that he desires. &gt;&gt; Not because I have to to make it. I already made it. Brother Bam told us that, you know, he doesn't He goes, I don't have to be preaching to go to heaven. I do that because I love the Lord and I love God's people. &gt;&gt; He exhausted himself. He extended himself. He went beyond his human strength. He went beyond. He he suffered rejection and ridicule and all kinds of hardships and financial trouble and and and legal trouble with the IRS and rejection from all of his friends. He went through all of that not because he had to to be saved, not because he had to to be a son of God, but because he had to because he loved God and this was God's plan for him and his will for him. And he wanted to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. And listen, God knew how to correct that prophet. Amen. When he got out of line, God says, "Don't do that." &gt;&gt; And he never took away his free moral agency. He said, he just said, "Don't do that. &gt;&gt; You go up and fulfill your plans. Your wife's not going to stay up there. She'll leave and you'll become a bum. Don't do it." &gt;&gt; And he listened &gt;&gt; to his heavenly father, to his Lord. Amen. I want to read a final list of dos. Paul gave us some dos, but he gave us a whole lot of don'ts. &gt;&gt; But here's another list of dues. And I want to close tonight on this list of dos. Chapter 6, verse 10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins gird about with the truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. That's a whole pile of dues. &gt;&gt; And I want to do them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's he telling him to do? Prepare yourself for spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's been instructing them in all along. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's been telling them a lot of things that are natural. Don't do. But there's a reason behind all of it. Don't do this. There's a reason because it brings you down because it it it it you lose your separation from the world and your sanctification. You ruin your testimony. You trouble your mind. There's all kinds of reasons for not doing all of these things. when he comes around to the things to do, there's a good reason to do all of these things, too. Because this is all about spiritual warfare. Because you've been called to be overcomers. You're overcomers in Christ Jesus, and you're going to be overcomers, fleshing out the overcoming Lord in this world because that's what he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, he doesn't say just, you know, become a Christian and just wait till, you know, a helmet drops on your head. and something in your hand. &gt;&gt; He says, "Be active." &gt;&gt; This is something we do. Put this on. Amen. I love how he says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, in the power of his might." Amen. Have a revelation of what God's given us. Get into the word. Amen. Get into the message of the hour and be strong in the power of the Lord. Amen. And be strong in the Lord and the power of his might. Amen. because this word has restored his power. It's restored his life. It's restored the Holy Spirit back into the church. Be strong in it. &gt;&gt; Because we don't wrestle against anything on this earth. It's all spiritual. There's spirits behind all of these things that Paul mentioned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have to take the word and cut through it all. &gt;&gt; And he tells us to be proactive. There's something for us to do. Now you see why brother Bam said he was a legalist. &gt;&gt; But he said he was a Calvinist. &gt;&gt; Is he a Calvinist or a legalist? &gt;&gt; He said both. &gt;&gt; Now you look at the book of Ephesians. Is Ephesians grace or is Ephesians works? &gt;&gt; Well, it just depends on if you're first half or second half. &gt;&gt; First half is grace. Second half is works. Amen. Because why, brother Benam said the the the Yeah. Let's I want to go back and look at this. Brother Franco. I don't know if you can quickly pull up the PowerPoint slide. I want to look at one more quote as we finish up. Oh, good. Yeah. Right here. One went to seed this way, the other went to seed that way. But I think the book of Ephesians bring them both right back and puts them in the stump where they belong. So, I really like the book of Ephesians. It keep it kind of keeps us straightened out, brethren, in our theology, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love the book of Ephesians more now than I ever have because God is telling us what he's done for us and now what he expects us to do. &gt;&gt; Does God have an expectation? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Does God expect a certain amount of conduct? Does God expect us to give our lives in obedience to his word to manifest? Yes. God has an expectation. But God hasn't left us all by ourselves to try to meet his expectation. He's given us his spirit. He's given us his power. And by his power, we can do what he's asked us to do. We can go where he's asked us to go. We can manifest what he's asked us to manifest. Not by not by uh our strength, not by our power, but by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord has given us in this age. And he's told us what he wants and he's given us the spirit to do it. And when we get it wrong of his spirit, he can correct us. Amen. And bring us back in line and bring us to a quick repentance. Brother Bram said that's also the work of the Holy Ghost. It's not as though we're born again, have the Holy Ghost, and we always do everything right. We do things wrong all the time, but part of the work of the Holy Ghost is to signal you when you've done wrong, to bring a conviction in your heart and drive you back to what God wants. &gt;&gt; So, he's not left us alone. That's what the whole first half of Ephesians is about. This isn't about you by yourself. It's what God chose to do through you, what God wants to do with you. that what your life is all about. Amen. This is all for you to accomplish on this earth. God has ordained you. He's predestinated you. He's took care of the sacrifice. Amen. Everything is already done. You're the one. Now you go and do it. &gt;&gt; How? By the power that he released at Calvary to come back into you to give you the power to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're going to have to will to do the will of God. We're going to have to be deliberate in our attentions. We're going to have to choose to do what he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because even with the anointing of the Holy Ghost, he does not take away free choice. &gt;&gt; He helps us sometimes make the right choice &gt;&gt; through external circumstances, &gt;&gt; but he never takes it away. And I'm so glad I'm so glad there's something I can do for him. He's done so much for me. &gt;&gt; He redeemed me. He saved me. He predestinated me unto adoption. He foresaw me crossing the finish line &gt;&gt; because he wanted me to cross the finish line. He ordained it. He predestinated. He made everything possible for it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; That's right. And now my appreciation of that is everything he said don't do, I don't want to do. &gt;&gt; Everything he said to do, that's what I want to do. &gt;&gt; I mess it up on a daily basis, but I still that's what I want. &gt;&gt; That's where my heart is. That's where my greatest desire is to be a son that brings satisfaction to my father. &gt;&gt; That pleases him. I want the Holy Ghost to give a good report. &gt;&gt; Do you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to go. I don't want to be the spoiled child who knows my dad will never correct me. I can go do whatever I want. No. I want to be the son who's diligent because I love my dad. I love my father. I love what he's done for me. I love who he is. I love all about him. And what I want to do is I want to be pleasing to him. And I want so bad the Holy Ghost, like brother Benham traumatizes, the Holy Ghost to go back, the tutor back to the father and say, "Father, hey, look, look at your son. Look at what he's doing. He's doing it just like you asked, just like you taught, just like you wanted him to do it." Friends, that that's the greatest desire of my heart is that the Holy Ghost can give that report of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can't even do it without the grace he gives me to do it. But I want to choose that grace, accept that grace, allow that grace to operate in my life because I can stop it. I can choose to do something else. I can take my own will and my own desire and I can push that power of grace down and do what I want to do because he's left me that privilege. &gt;&gt; But oh God, no. Help me, Lord. I want to take my will, my desire, my lesson, and I want to push it down and let grace have its place &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. So, do you have your theology straightened out in the book of Ephesians? &gt;&gt; If you ever get confused, go back to Ephesians. &gt;&gt; If you ever get discouraged, read the first three chapters. &gt;&gt; And I suggest you read them first. &gt;&gt; So, you have the courage to read the last three chapters. &gt;&gt; If you put the first three before the last three, then it would be all your deeds and your works and your obedience that get you grace. But oh, what an order to the word. He put grace and predestination and his will first. &gt;&gt; And then he told us what's pleasing to him. &gt;&gt; By the time we get to chapter 4, our hearts are so full and bubbling over. Whatever he tells me to do, I can't wait to do because I know who I am and what he's done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, abundant grace. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for your word, Lord. God, it's so rich. It's so alive. It's so true, Lord. And God, when we read it, Lord, by the light that you shined on it through this message, you've illuminated the truth. You've you've cut through all the confusion and brought us to the light. Lord, you shine the light on your word so that we could see what what it is you're trying to teach us, what it is you're trying to show us. I say, "Oh God, help us, Lord. Help us to realize what you have done for us. God, bring us to the first half of Ephesians and solidly plant in our heart that grace you had before us when you accepted us. You made us accepted in the beloved by your own pleasure, by your own will, by your own desire. apart from our works. Before we could do good or evil on our worst day, you still had chosen to place us in Christ. You've lifted us up and seated us in heavenly places with Christ. When he rose, we rose. And God, we're just now beginning to realize these things, Lord. And God, bring us to the full revelation and the full impact of Ephesians 1:3. And may that impact in our lives bring us to a desire to manifest four through six. That we can give our lives to you and that your spirit can work through us and that we can exercise our will to do your will. That you would empower us, strengthen us, give us revelation, give us understanding, show us what you want us to do. Teach us what is the right way to live in this end time. And Lord, we will give you room to work in us. And we will align our our heart with your heart and our will with your will if you'll just come and strengthen us and give us power. We surrender it all to you, Lord, and ask that you would take control of us and manifest yourself through us. We love you. We love you for the instructions. We love you for the teaching. We love you for the message of the hour to straighten out all the confusion. And God, I pray that you would bring us into that true understanding of grace and works so that our life will come into that place where Romans and James is both true inside of us. That we're that your righteous has imputed us by faith and we're as righteous as you're righteous by faith. but that our faith has been made perfect because you sent us a power of the Holy Ghost that we yielded to and surrendered to. And that power worked in us all your works and obedience to your word and became the completion or the fulfillment of your great purpose in our lives. so that our works anointed by your spirit with our will engaged will complete or make the faith perfect. That's our desire, Lord. That all you've desired for us to manifest in this end time will be manifest. That all the works that you've before ordained for us to do that we'll do and we'll do them yielded to you. Lord, we love you. We ask that you would help us, Lord. For we know that this is the final voice to the final age. And it has to do with the lives that we live. And it has to be the word on display. And it has to come from a heart of obedience. And God, I want to give you that heart of obedience tonight. Forgive me for my failures, my shortcomings. Lord, forgive me for my laziness, my spiritual lethargy. Forgive me, Lord. And God, would you come and empower me aresh to be more diligent and more thoughtful, more circumspect as I walk in this life? And my I do what you've asked me to do. And I do it with a willing heart, with joy in my heart, and with thanksgiving. Help me, Lord. Provide your spirit. And I yield my body. I ask that you'd help us, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. What a blessing. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. For there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. Oh, keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. Keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. For there's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true once more. So keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord. Jesus, keep me true. There's a race that I must run. There are victories to be won. Give me power every hour to be true. I'll live for Jesus and let the world go by. I'll claim his promises. He will supply. We'll walk together, my Lord and I. I'll live for Jesus and let the world know. I'll live for Jesus. Oh, I'll live for Jesus [Applause] and let the world go by. [Applause] [Music] I'll claim his promises. He will supply. We'll walk together. My Lord and I live for Jesus and let the world go by once more. Well, I'll live for Jesus [Music] and let the world go by. All his promises he will supply. We'll walk together.

There must be some more within that only he can see. I pray dear Lord change my life and give it all to thee and grant that every day you'll commune with me. Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us by the way? He opened to us the scriptures, the word revealed to us today. We can see the word in person. He's among us alive today. He opened our understanding in simplicity Christ. Now I know that he desires to have fellowship with me. He revealed something more within. Until now I did not see. Pray dear Lord please take my life live in me and I in me [Music] and grant that every day you'll commune with me. How could he desire to have fellowship with me?

I prayed, "Dear Lord, please take my life. Live in me and I in me. Grant that every day you'll commune with me.
