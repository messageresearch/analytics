[0:00] Amen.
[0:00] &gt;&gt; God had to convince Joseph not Mary
[0:03] because now she's carrying the word and
[0:05] God has got to watch over her life. And
[0:08] now there's prophecies that must be
[0:10] fulfilled in her life. And one of those
[0:12] prophecies is that this baby has to be
[0:14] born in the city of David. Well, Mary
[0:16] may not even even understood that. Mary
[0:18] may have heard and been read through I
[0:20] mean the scriptures and it never dawned
[0:22] on her that that was part of the word
[0:24] for her day. But it didn't need to dawn
[0:26] on her because it never left the mind of
[0:29] God. And she was part of the program of
[0:31] God. And God was going to work his
[0:33] program because his life was now
[0:35] injected inside of her. And she didn't
[0:36] have to figure it out. God was going to
[0:38] figure it out. If God had to move the
[0:40] heart of kings, he had to move nations.
[0:42] He had to move people in a census all
[0:44] over the world. Hey, listen. This was a
[0:46] worldwide census.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; God was moving politics. God was moving
[0:53] armies. God was moving uh laws,
[0:55] senators. He was moving. What was he
[0:57] moving it for? Because there was a
[0:59] prophecy, amen, that this baby has to
[1:01] come from the city of David. And if he's
[1:03] got to raise up another emperor in Rome,
[1:05] and that emperor gets suddenly a
[1:07] brainstorm one day, all of his advisers
[1:10] around him might say, "You're nuts. This
[1:11] is going to be so much work. Why are we
[1:13] doing this?" The Senate may have broke
[1:14] out and fights. They may have threatened
[1:16] his life. Then everybody around the
[1:18] world in the in the habitated world at
[1:20] that point. Now they're all disrupted
[1:22] and everybody has to go back to their
[1:23] city of origin and people are moving all
[1:25] over the place. So much so when they got
[1:27] to Bethlehem, the ends were full. There
[1:29] was no place to stay. People are
[1:30] dispersed. Amen. The the whole world is
[1:33] probably grinding their teeth and
[1:35] seething about
[1:36] &gt;&gt; who this emperor was.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; And it all happened because she had the
[1:41] word inside of her and she didn't have
[1:43] to figure anything out. She didn't have
[1:45] to lift a finger to move it. God was
[1:47] moving it.
[1:48] We don't have to understand how God's
[1:50] going to do what he's going to do in the
[1:51] end time. All the prophecies that
[1:53] brother Brandham laid down, it's you be
[1:55] sure it's going to happen. If he's got
[1:57] to raise up kings and knock them down
[1:58] and move nations and start fight and
[2:01] change the whole structure of the world,
[2:02] he's going to change it to bring forth
[2:04] what he promised to bring forth in this
[2:07] age. It'll happen just as sure as you're
[2:10] here. It's going to happen, friends. And
[2:13] you don't have to figure it out. You
[2:15] don't have to join conspiracy theories.
[2:17] You don't have to probe the internet for
[2:19] hours and listen to people sitting in
[2:21] their basement telling you what the
[2:22] government's doing. Forget about it all
[2:24] and stay with this word. Read the
[2:27] message. Listen to the tapes. Stay in
[2:29] your Bible. Stay in prayer. And stop
[2:31] roaming around the internet trying to
[2:33] figure out how God's going to bring to
[2:35] pass what Brother Ben prophesied. Cuz
[2:37] every time you get it wrong, every time.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; God never asked Mary to be smart. Amen.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; He never asked Mary to figure out the
[2:47] conspiracy.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; You know how many conspiracies were
[2:51] floating around
[2:52] &gt;&gt; when Caesar decided to tax the whole
[2:54] world?
[2:57] &gt;&gt; But we know what the conspiracy was. And
[2:58] for us, it's not a theory. It's the
[3:00] truth. God had to get that woman from
[3:03] Nazareth to Bethlehem.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; And he disrupted the whole world to do
[3:08] it.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; God's got to get you to manifest the
[3:12] full life of Jesus Christ. And if he's
[3:14] got to disrupt my life, your life, and
[3:16] everyone around us, he'll disrupt it all
[3:18] to have that manifestation.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Everything he said would happen will
[3:22] happen.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Boycott, gold system, whatever, it's all
[3:26] going to happen. But I it's not up to me
[3:28] to figure out how. Do you think Mary was
[3:30] sitting there one day and somebody come
[3:32] and said, "Mary, I saw this scripture
[3:34] where we got to go to Bethl." No.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; And then what does she do? Tell Caesar
[3:40] to bring a worldwide taxation.
[3:44] How many connections do you have in
[3:46] government?
[3:50] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we're supposed to
[3:52] do except believe the word and surrender
[3:55] to the headship of Christ. Let the
[3:57] spirit of God run our lives and stop
[4:00] using all our thinking.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Just stick with the word and let the
[4:04] spirit of God move us. Amen.
