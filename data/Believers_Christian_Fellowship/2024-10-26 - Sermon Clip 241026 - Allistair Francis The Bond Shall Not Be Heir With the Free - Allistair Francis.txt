TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's only one way to be a Christian the word Christian means Christlike and you can't do it you can't work it in yourself if you're trying that's a Bond woman and that's a bond woman's son right there there's no way at all you can do it you have to forget yourself die out to yourself and let Christ come in and Live the Life of Christ in you that's a foundational thing that we as people who believe in the open book need to realize I just rest just stop fighting know that Isaac is the son of the free woman I don't want to fight with myself anymore Lord I just want you to produce that life within me I want to just feed on the word I want to get more of that word I want to immerse myself in that word I want the life to come out from that that feminine Gene seed yes I'm tired of fighting with churchianity and trying to prove myself to people I just want to soak myself in there I just want to live the life that you predestinated me to be I want to live without reproach I want to live without feeling like everyone's watching me that I have to perform for them that I have to do what they think is right I just want to live by the genc that is inside I want to live by that which it can produce I don't want it to be my abilities or someone else teaching me about about something or asking me or forcing me to be some way I don't want to be a rule follower I don't want to be pleasing people by following rules and then because rules are always adjusting am right and you can just never attain just when you follow a rule they increase something or adjust something or change something and then we're going on for decades and decades and no one's getting it right I want to be what you want me to be let us realize we cannot do this by our strength of our own human character that is so affected by pride and arrogance I can't tell you how much this means to me how much it helps me because I I I know when I when I assess myself every single day I know when it's my ability when when I'm trying to do something where I'm trying to circumvent the word in some way where I'm trying to say something or do something for some kind of attention or to be right about something or to be more right than someone else you just know that Holy Spirit checks you in there and you know it's not about you it's not about the flesh it's not about recognition it's about what God wants it's about his purpose for me for today amen we must have his life come alive in us when we can produce this predestinated life we cannot go in the Rapture with our Bond woman produced life we have to have the revelation of the free woman and live in that that is our hope that is our stay that is our solid rock that is our part in the Rapture the bond shall not be air with the free amen praise be to God
