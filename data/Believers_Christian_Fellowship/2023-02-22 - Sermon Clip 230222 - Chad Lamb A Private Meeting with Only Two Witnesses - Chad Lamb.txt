TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the false church and the true church have both been pregnant they've both received seed and they've both been impregnated by two different sources one from Christ and one from Antichrist amen and how in the world are we going to know amen which one is the and which one is the Virgin everybody says I'm virgin amen I mean the Catholic Church says they're virgin amen the Protestant churches say they're virgin we say we're a virgin amen the only way we can do it is show the tokens that we have received and what have we received we received the true revelation of the word we receive the very spirit of God we have his life and we have his word with the correct interpretation of the word and when it comes time to present and we could say we could say it this way amen the one that I'm pregnant by amen gave me this word this is his word this Revelation this word this opening of the seals this revelation of the seven Thunders this this interpretation of serpency this interpretation of water baptism this interpretation of godhead I got this from the one who pregnated me and this life that's in me that's not my life but his life in me I got that from him too when I received this word that's the man who pregnated me and then the false Vine amen when they go to show their staff their bracelet whatever they show however it works amen I'm just showing it as a Time amen when they go to show they say Amen this is my interpretation of the scripture the one impregnated me show me baptism and titles amen show me a piece of fruit in the Garden of Eden amen show me that the the the seals are not open they'll be open later amen that's who impregnated me and by the tokens proves where the seed came from and it testifies that this bride is not a harlot she's not been in Harlot she's been keeping the pure word she's kept herself virgin to one man and that one man is Jesus Christ you realize you have a token to present concerning the life inside of you it's the evidence of the man who impregnated you
