[0:00] but what the devil wants to do is get
[0:03] you in a place where you're struggling
[0:05] and he can convince you that you're in a
[0:07] place that you're not
[0:09] this is always Satan's objective Satan
[0:11] doesn't care if you believe the word do
[0:13] you know that he doesn't care if you
[0:15] believe the word as long as you believe
[0:17] the word is applicable yesterday
[0:20] as long as you believe that God's word
[0:22] is only applicable Tomorrow Never today
[0:25] because when you as a Believer begin to
[0:28] believe that the word of God is
[0:29] applicable to you today the devil's in
[0:32] Hell tremble
[0:34] because they have to move there is
[0:37] Authority that is Jesus Christ when
[0:40] Jesus came to the man at the tomb he the
[0:42] the lesion that was in him not the man
[0:44] the man didn't know Jesus
[0:46] the man didn't know who Jesus was but
[0:48] the legion that was in the man at the
[0:50] tombs ran to Jesus and threw himself
[0:52] down
[0:54] they recognized
[0:56] Authority
[0:58] and Satan does not want you to have
[1:01] authority
[1:03] he will do anything he can to keep you
[1:06] away from Authority
[1:08] and you've come through sanctification
[1:10] and now the devil is going to work as
[1:12] hard as he can to convince you that you
[1:15] are sealed until the day of your
[1:16] Redemption
[1:18] and if you have the Holy Ghost sealed
[1:20] into the day of redemption and you are
[1:22] God is is working on you and you're
[1:24] starting in that growing that placing
[1:26] process
[1:27] called adoption
[1:29] God the holy spirit is there the tutor
[1:31] is there and he's teaching you you're
[1:32] now in this process the devil is going
[1:34] to come to you and tell you you're not
[1:37] sealed if you were sealed why are you
[1:39] fighting
[1:41] amen he will try to get you religious
[1:45] if you're not feeling religious
[1:47] if you're not feeling religious he well
[1:49] let me say it this way
[1:51] if you really haven't had an experience
[1:53] Satan is going to try to make you feel
[1:54] like the most religious person that's
[1:56] ever walked on the Earth
[1:58] and if you're a real son or daughter of
[1:59] God he's going to try to beat you down
[2:01] and make you feel like garbage
[2:04] because he wants you to believe that you
[2:07] are not Wherever You Are
[2:09] and confidence comes from knowing where
[2:12] you are
[2:14] and when you know where you are you know
[2:17] what to ask for
[2:20] Amen brother man I've talked about
[2:21] healing he said I know the Cure but I
[2:24] need to know the cause
[2:25] so he's praying and asking the Lord to
[2:27] show him the cause and when he
[2:29] understands the cause maybe that's sin
[2:31] in that person's life he could pray for
[2:33] his Spirit over and over and over and
[2:34] over again nothing happens the spirit
[2:36] won't move
[2:37] but then by discernment the cause is
[2:40] discerned the person has sinned in their
[2:42] life they repent of the sin and just
[2:43] like that they're free
[2:45] why because the Holy Spirit identified
[2:48] the cause now you're confident you know
[2:50] where you are
[2:52] and when you know where you are Satan is
[2:55] trying everything to make you believe
[2:57] you are not where God has placed you
[3:01] and if Satan can do that
[3:03] he's pulled a rug out from underneath
