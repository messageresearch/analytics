TRANSCRIPT
========================================
satan's deception is to make you believe that you are saved when you're not the only other tactic that he has the only other tactic that he has is if you really are saved to make you believe you're not that's his two tactics he is going to convince you that you are saved when you're really not or if you really are he's going to try to convince you you're not because he knows if you have that proper understanding and you have the indwelling comforter he is powerless before you because the scripture says if my heart does not condemn me nothing can stand in my way so because religious is his business that's the only thing that he has i got to convince you you're saved before you really do get saved but if by perchance you do get saved before i convince you you're not saved i have to make you believe that you're not saved when you really are saved that is his business and that is what takes the comforter away from us that is why the seals had to be loosed that is why we had to have a vindicated prophet come and tell us what is right and what is wrong and that is why we have to die to any of our own thinking and strictly legalistically militantly take what he said is truth because anything else is going to leave us running around the cow shed anything else is going to bring us down from our proper position anything else is going to bring condemnation into our heart remember religion is satan's business you're not going to beat him at it you are not going to beat satan at religion it is his business and he has spent thousands and thousands and thousands of years just in this dimension mastering it let alone what he did in the other dimension you are not going to beat him with your mental prowess we have one chance saints we have one hope and that is to take what the voice said to us and if he said that the evidence of receiving god in your being is to believe on him who he hath sent and yield completely to that word that is the one and only evidence and you have done that do not allow satan to talk you out
