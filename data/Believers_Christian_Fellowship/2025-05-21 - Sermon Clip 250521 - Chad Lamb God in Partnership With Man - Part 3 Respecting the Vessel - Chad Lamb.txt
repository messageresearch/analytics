TRANSCRIPT
========================================
All he's told is to cast this rod before Pharaoh's assign. He's not told anything else. And when he throws this rod down, it turns into a serpent just like God had showed him before in the wilderness. But the part that Moses wasn't told by God is that there'll be other power that can copy and mimic that power. And the magicians came and threw down their rods and it turned into serpents. And just imagine for a minute you're Moses and you're thinking this is exactly why I didn't want to come because he there's nothing he can do. He is powerless. He is incapable. He is unable. God never told Moses to do anything else. He just told Moses to drop the the the the rod and it'll become a serpent. And he did exactly what God says. And listen, uh when when the other magicians threw down their rods and they become serpents too, Moses was at a complete loss as what to do. Brother Ram tells us so. He said Moses just stepped back and watched. There was nothing he can do. He was completely inable, incapable, had no understanding. He was at the end of his intelligence and his ability. There was nothing he can do. And and and Moses doesn't start saying, "Okay, that was just a joke. I was just because Moses is in partnership with God." Don't forget what a partnership is. A partnership is not I do everything, you do nothing, we split the proceeds 50/50. You do everything. No. A partnership is you have your part to do and I have my part to do. Moses did his part. And when it went beyond Moses's ability, there was nothing else for Moses to do but sit still and be quiet and let his partner work. That's exactly what Moses did. Moses realized, I'm on partnership with God. And now we've be we've gone beyond my part of the contract. Because I'm here for the natural part. I'm not here for the supernatural part. Listen you, brother Chad. Listen, that's still the truth, friends. You can't make anything supernatural happen of yourself. It takes God. Amen. There's so many things that God wants us to do. Hey, listen. You can put your clothes on and you can come to church on time and you can pray and you can worship and you can hear the word. You can open your Bible and read. You can listen to the message. You can There's a lot you can do. You can testify. You can share the word. There's a lot you can do. But hey, there's just as much you cannot do. I'll tell you what else. Listen, God can't read the Bible for you. You have to read it. God can't come to church for you. You've got to get in the car and you've got to push on the pedal and you've got to come. Amen. You say, it's not as though, you know, we we decide to miss a few ser, we get tired and we want to sit home and we don't want to come and whatever. For whatever reason, we decide. Listen, God doesn't just pick you up and carry you and teleport you in and sit you here because there's something you need to hear. No, there's a part you have to do. And if you're going to get the benefit out of what God told us is benefit, you've got to do your part to get the benefit that he promised you would get. Right.
