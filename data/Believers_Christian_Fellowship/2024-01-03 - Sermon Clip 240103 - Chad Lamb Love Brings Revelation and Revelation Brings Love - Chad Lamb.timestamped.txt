[1:54] this love secret nobody else but only
[1:57] the bride will receive this love secret
[1:59] of the revelation of the Seven Seals and
[2:00] the Mystery of God being finished she's
[2:02] the one who's going to take the Rapture

[2:08] to remain who's going to go in the
[2:09] Rapture who's going to go into
