TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and so now this is a this is a quote that I want to start laboring on because we've got this balance that's all the way off and I don't know how I'm going to ever become worthy amen I know all the kind of things that make me not worthy there's a whole pile of that make me not worthy amen but what is going to make me worthy what's going to make my life worthy of the Gospel what's going to make me worthy of Christ and he says again in the same message a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of a tool that keeps a religious organization moving a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian is to be Christlike amen and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the Life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel amen when brother Ben starts laying this out in your life worthy of the Gospel he starts talking about the way we Act and the way we dress and the compromise on the word and taking our our parents religion and staying in the denominational system and being attached to the things of the world and not for he goes to all of that to show how many ways we're not worthy of the Gospel but I want to know how am I going to be worthy of the Gospel how am I going to have a life worthy of the Gospel I know all the things I do wrong and I know all the things that will keep me from it but there's got to be something that will measure up and level up my life and there's only one thing I know of because the the these Deeds aren't going to do it none of them I can pile them on all day long I can go to church I can pay great M sums of money I can do all kinds of things it's not going to level it up but the only way it's going to level it up if I can get what's over here over here and when that comes in place now all of the sudden we've got Christ over here and we have Christ over here and that'll bring a balance in my life and make my life worthy of the [Applause] [Music] Gospel hallelujah it's not something I can just put on and do but it's something I surrender to but what's hindering Christ in my life all of these other things that are making me not worthy not taking up my Christ loving my life wanting to try out my yoke of oxen wanting to stay with my field wanting to stay with my family that's all hindering the move of Christ in my life and keeping me off balance God but what's it going to take an absolute complete surrender to the will of God and a laying down of my life completely and taking up my cross and following him so that the life that's on one side of this equation can move to the other side of the equation and bring a balance and now my life can be worthy of the Gospel why because of good Deeds because of good character because no because Christ in me the hope of glory
