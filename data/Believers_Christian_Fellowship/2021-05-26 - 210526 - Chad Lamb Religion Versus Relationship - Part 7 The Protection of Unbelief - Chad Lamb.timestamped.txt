[4:24] that's what we desire more than anything
[4:26] this is leadership amen
[4:28] it's good to be with you this evening
[4:30] while we're standing let's take our
[4:31] bibles
[4:32] let's just look to the word let's go to
[4:34] revelation chapter 3.
[4:38] before we read the scripture i'd like to
[4:39] greet brother david and sister diane
[4:41] deanhart god bless you guys it's good to
[4:42] have you with us
[4:44] amen that's been a little while but
[4:46] they've got a pool that keeps bringing
[4:48] them back here and that's their family
[4:50] and we get to benefit from that so
[4:52] they're happy to have them here for a
[4:54] grandson's graduation
[4:55] and also to celebrate their 50th
[4:57] wednesday anniversary
[4:58] congratulations god bless you man
[5:02] amen and while they're in town i've
[5:05] asked brother david if he'd minister for
[5:07] us on sunday so he
[5:08] graciously said yes he's planning on
[5:10] ministering so i'm sure he'll appreciate
[5:12] your prayers
[5:13] and greater than that i'll appreciate
[5:15] your pool on sunday amen
[5:17] so we look forward to that and then also
[5:20] i wanted to let everybody know that
[5:21] according to
[5:22] our governor this will be the last
[5:25] wednesday
[5:26] under a mass mandate praise god
[5:30] they said june 2nd which is next monday
[5:32] should end they're going to
[5:34] release us from all mandates all health
[5:36] orders
[5:37] all of that unless they pull the
[5:39] switcheroo
[5:41] i hope not it's hard to trust the
[5:44] political atmosphere but that's what
[5:46] everything i have read is said
[5:47] it's a consistent theme in consistent
[5:49] statements so i believe next wednesday
[5:52] we'll be smiling at one another
[5:55] without mask those who have been
[5:57] vaccinated have already been released
[5:58] they've been freed
[5:59] as of the 15th so amen
[6:02] they're already free they know what it
[6:04] feels like but praise god
[6:07] our turn's coming we just thank god for
[6:09] his faithfulness through it all
[6:11] i mean the words never diminished one
[6:13] iota no matter what happens what comes
[6:15] what goes
[6:16] the word keeps moving just right along
[6:18] amen and bringing us
[6:20] higher and higher so we're thankful for
[6:22] that
[6:23] i'd like to continue on with this series
[6:25] on religion versus relationship
[6:28] i believe this is part seven
[6:31] i'd like for a subtitle to take the
[6:32] protection of unbelief
[6:35] the protection of unbelief and i've got
[6:37] so many thoughts and so many things on
[6:39] my heart
[6:39] that i just can't put it all together so
[6:41] i'm trusting god
[6:42] to put all the pieces together because
[6:45] there's no way a man could be capable of
[6:47] that
[6:48] but let's just look at revelations
[6:49] chapter 3 together
[6:51] and we'll read from verse 14.
[6:54] and unto the angel of the church of the
[6:56] laodicean's right these things sayeth
[6:58] the amen
[6:59] the faithful and true witness the
[7:01] beginning of the creation of god
[7:03] i know thy works that thou art neither
[7:05] cold nor hot
[7:06] i would that were cold or hot so then
[7:09] because thou art lukewarm
[7:11] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[7:13] thee out of my mouth
[7:16] because thou sayest i am rich and
[7:18] increased with goods and have need of
[7:19] nothing
[7:20] and knowest not thou art wretched and
[7:23] miserable
[7:24] and poor and blind and naked
[7:27] i counsel thee to buying me gold tried
[7:29] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[7:32] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[7:33] clothed and that the shame of thy
[7:35] nakedness do not appear
[7:36] and anoint thine eyes with eyes said
[7:38] that thou mayest see
[7:40] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[7:42] be zealous therefore
[7:44] and repent behold i stand at the door
[7:47] and knock
[7:48] if any man hear my voice and open the
[7:50] door i will come into him
[7:52] will sup with him and he with me
[7:56] man let's just bow our heads and ask the
[7:57] lord's blessing
[8:00] lord jesus we thank you for the
[8:01] privilege of being gathered here tonight
[8:04] for god you've been faithful to bring us
[8:06] once again
[8:07] by your grace and your mercy and our
[8:09] lives and we've come lord to worship you
[8:11] in spirit and truth
[8:13] for you have called us lord we could not
[8:15] come unless you called
[8:17] and that was your mercy and grace
[8:19] expressed to us
[8:20] now lord we ask that you would take
[8:22] preeminence among us and
[8:24] speak your word to us lord the word that
[8:26] we have need of
[8:27] for this day may lord we have the eye
[8:29] salve
[8:30] and the white raiment and the gold tried
[8:32] by fire may we enjoy it lawn
[8:35] we ask for your blessings over every
[8:36] part of this service and everything
[8:38] that'll be said
[8:39] take this vessel under your control in
[8:42] jesus christ's name we pray
[8:43] amen you can be seated
[8:48] we look here and at the laodicean church
[8:52] age which we know as the last church age
[8:54] which is the one that the world is
[8:55] currently under and
[8:57] we find that the condition that jesus
[8:59] finds the church
[9:00] in is the same condition he finds the
[9:02] men when he comes the first time
[9:05] when he came he found a church that
[9:07] thought they were right
[9:09] that thought they loved god thought they
[9:11] worshipped god
[9:13] but when god showed up to fulfill the
[9:15] word that he promised to fulfill
[9:17] amen it was exposing the unbelief that
[9:20] was laying in the church amen
[9:22] and they did not believe the word
[9:24] although they confess that they believe
[9:26] the word although they thought they
[9:27] believed the word
[9:28] because when the word came into
[9:29] manifestation they rejected that word
[9:32] proving that they were an unbeliever
[9:36] is that true they didn't know it they
[9:38] would have never confessed it
[9:40] amen but their encounter with the
[9:42] manifested word for their day
[9:44] amen proved the condition that they were
[9:46] in
[9:47] and so now at the end of time in the
[9:50] laodicean church age
[9:51] and then we find the same scenario he
[9:54] comes
[9:54] amen and finds a church that
[9:58] in verse 17 he says because thou sayest
[10:01] i am rich and increased with goods
[10:03] and have need of nothing this is the
[10:05] laodicean condition of the laodicean
[10:08] church
[10:08] they didn't know they had a need
[10:12] they thought they were rich and
[10:13] increased with goods it had need of
[10:14] nothing
[10:15] so the church at the end time believes
[10:18] they're fine their condition is fine and
[10:20] all is well
[10:21] more than fine they're rich and
[10:22] increased with goods and they
[10:24] they have no need
[10:28] and they're very much in the same
[10:30] condition amen
[10:32] as the church was in jerusalem in that
[10:34] day
[10:35] and so now we find that jesus is on the
[10:38] outside of the church
[10:39] knocking they put him out in this age
[10:42] because they didn't need him
[10:43] because they were rich and increased
[10:45] with goods and had need of nothing
[10:47] but he says and here in verse 17 and
[10:49] knoweth not that thou are
[10:51] wretched and miserable and poor
[10:54] and blind and naked
[10:58] what is it that had so blinded them to
[11:00] their real condition when when jesus
[11:03] testifies to them what their condition
[11:05] actually is
[11:06] is that they they are actually wretched
[11:10] and miserable and poor and
[11:14] blind and naked amen what was it that
[11:18] that had veiled them amen it was the
[11:20] veil of religion that had veiled their
[11:22] eyes
[11:22] to where they could not see their
[11:24] condition amen
[11:26] amen and so god had a veil in the
[11:29] beginning that would veil the eyes of
[11:30] their children
[11:31] that they would not see amen their
[11:34] nakedness they had a veil of
[11:35] innocency but that avail of innocy was
[11:37] taken away and they came under a lust
[11:39] veil and now as satan had perfected amen
[11:43] his eden when he comes to
[11:44] the perfection of his eden he has the
[11:46] church under a religious veil
[11:49] and they are veiled to their nakedness
[11:51] again only it's not a holy veil
[11:53] it's an unholy veil
[11:57] and this is the work of religion and
[11:59] this is the the work of satan this is
[12:01] what he's been trying to produce
[12:03] amen he's trying to build his own eden
[12:05] in god's
[12:06] see satan is always replicating and
[12:08] perverting replicating and perverting
[12:10] he's copying god
[12:11] and god and his satan he has them naked
[12:14] but under a veil of innocency
[12:16] but in satan's eden he has them once
[12:18] again naked
[12:20] but still veiled to their nakedness so
[12:23] that they would not
[12:24] need christ when christ came because now
[12:27] they have need of nothing
[12:28] because they're veiled to their
[12:30] spiritual condition
[12:34] this is the height of religion
[12:38] this is the pinnacle of religion when
[12:41] they've come to a place when they're so
[12:43] wretched
[12:44] and so miserable and so poor and so
[12:47] naked but have no idea because of the
[12:49] religious veil and they feel like
[12:51] all as well
[12:54] and so that was satan's goal that is
[12:57] satan's agenda
[12:58] and we find in this in this age jesus
[13:02] is on the outside of the church because
[13:05] they didn't need him so they didn't
[13:06] welcome him
[13:07] amen and they cast him out they thrust
[13:09] him out of their midst
[13:10] and now those who realize that they have
[13:12] a need
[13:13] must go beyond the camp amen must leave
[13:16] the realm of religion must leave the
[13:18] realm of the church amen
[13:20] it must be united with him outside the
[13:22] camp beyond the walls of religion amen
[13:25] because within the walls of religion
[13:27] they're held captive amen and he
[13:29] that the wall of the religion was the
[13:32] barrier that kept him out
[13:36] so the walled city of denominationalism
[13:39] of religion of church
[13:40] amen builds a wall amen just like
[13:44] a nimrod built a city and built a tower
[13:47] they built a city and built a tower
[13:49] supposedly for their protection
[13:51] for their unification amen to protect
[13:53] them from the judgments of god
[13:55] to protect them from being scattered so
[13:57] they would not be weak but so they would
[13:59] remain strong
[14:02] but the but the city and the tower amen
[14:05] that was supposed to liberate them and
[14:07] protect them
[14:08] was the very thing that ensnared them
[14:10] and trapped them
[14:12] so god came down and interrupted the
[14:15] work so that his children could go free
[14:16] and out of that he pulled an abraham
[14:21] and so now we find that the same thing
[14:23] in this day
[14:26] but because jesus has come
[14:30] in this day and been rejected
[14:35] and been thrust out of the church now
[14:38] he's calling us to leave the system to
[14:40] leave the walled cities
[14:42] to leave the denominations to be joined
[14:44] to him outside the city
[14:47] so to leave religion amen and and and
[14:51] you know many of us we've had to leave
[14:54] the baptist and some of the catholics
[14:56] and some pentecostals and some of this
[14:58] to come to the message amen but too many
[15:00] times we brought baptist along
[15:05] we brought pentecostal along amen but he
[15:08] wants us to come
[15:09] out completely come out of that thing be
[15:11] completely separated from that
[15:13] and go beyond the camp of religion and
[15:15] be united with him
[15:17] outside the city
[15:20] and so we've got to leave it all behind
[15:22] mother bram said everything that was in
[15:24] that previous age
[15:25] had to be burnt totally burnt amen
[15:28] nothing left over
[15:29] amen all that was there had to be
[15:31] completely burnt because it was good for
[15:33] that age
[15:34] but it could not carry over to this age
[15:36] there's a lamb for this day
[15:38] and that lamb for this day contains
[15:40] everything that was right in that day
[15:42] is the lamb for this day but we can't
[15:45] have a leftover lamb
[15:49] we can't have a reheated religion a
[15:51] leftover
[15:52] we can't bring any leftovers into this
[15:56] it's got to be the lamb for our day and
[15:59] the lamb for our day contains
[16:01] everything that the lamb contained in
[16:03] previous ages
[16:09] praise be to god so we need to let it be
[16:12] burnt by fire
[16:14] by the holy fire of god burn it all up
[16:17] and
[16:17] take the lamb that's here for today
[16:21] benham said the message god hiding
[16:24] himself in simplicity he said in the
[16:26] beginning
[16:27] when man sinned it showed the nature of
[16:29] man he's always trying to hide from god
[16:31] and make himself a way that he can feel
[16:33] justified
[16:35] a religion that's been a religion means
[16:37] a covering so he tried to make his own
[16:39] religion
[16:40] i've read that i think every time we've
[16:42] preached on this series but
[16:43] it's so important that a man has made
[16:45] his own religion
[16:46] so that he can feel justified
[16:50] man is under the veil of
[16:52] denominationalism and religion
[16:54] because he wants to be under the veil
[16:59] because he doesn't want to see his own
[17:01] condition because if he'd actually see
[17:03] his own condition then he would need
[17:05] christ
[17:06] and if he would need christ he would
[17:07] have to go beyond the camp to find him
[17:10] in this day
[17:10] because he cannot be found in the realm
[17:12] of religion you have to go beyond
[17:15] the camp to find him in this day and to
[17:18] go on beyond the camp means to live
[17:20] leave every security that you've ever
[17:22] held on to
[17:23] everything that you've ever thought to
[17:25] be right or true amen you've got to
[17:27] allow that to be burnt amen
[17:28] to unite with him and when unite with
[17:30] him he'll tell
[17:32] you what is right and what is true
[17:38] and so man would rather stay
[17:41] under the veil because of
[17:44] the false security that it provides
[17:48] man would rather stay in his religion
[17:53] because it's it's risky business to go
[17:56] beyond the camp
[17:59] because if he was rejected and cast out
[18:02] and you leave to go to him guess what
[18:05] you will also be
[18:07] whatever he is you are you're identified
[18:09] with him in every way
[18:11] if you go beyond the camp and leave all
[18:13] religion behind and unite to the one
[18:15] that's been rejected by the camp
[18:17] amen then you will also take on the same
[18:20] rejection that he's had
[18:24] and jesus was not looking amen is not
[18:27] looking for any
[18:28] false security his security comes from
[18:31] his position from who he is
[18:32] his identification as the word amen
[18:37] and it takes in order to go beyond the
[18:39] camp and be united with him
[18:41] it takes a certain something on the
[18:43] inside
[18:44] amen that has the same attributes
[18:48] amen we may not recognize it at first we
[18:50] may not understand what's going on in us
[18:52] amen but when as god the father is
[18:55] drawing us
[18:56] what he's doing is he's drawing a life
[18:58] that's on the inside of us
[19:00] he's cooing he's wooing he's speaking to
[19:02] a life
[19:03] a counterpart a part of himself and
[19:05] there's something in there
[19:07] amen that's a faith that's laying there
[19:09] dormant
[19:10] waiting to come awake but as he begins
[19:12] to brood over it
[19:13] it begins to pull amen and it begins to
[19:15] pull us
[19:16] beyond everything we've ever understood
[19:18] beyond everything that brought security
[19:21] beyond everything that was safe to us in
[19:23] the past and begins moving us into
[19:25] dangerous territory
[19:30] amen see it's only
[19:33] dangerous to the human mind
[19:36] it's dangerous to our perception it's
[19:39] dangerous
[19:40] to our levels of comfort amen but it's
[19:42] the only safe place to be
[19:45] it's going beyond the camp to unite
[19:48] with him
[19:52] and man would rather
[19:57] stay behind the veil
[20:01] then lose his security
[20:06] for what he doesn't yet understand
[20:12] many of us have known what it's like to
[20:14] lose our security for what we don't yet
[20:18] understand
[20:20] amen to follow him
[20:23] you walk a walk of faith
[20:27] now after he said this and god hiding
[20:29] himself in simplicity he says man
[20:32] make himself a way that he can feel
[20:34] justified
[20:35] a religion has been a religion means a
[20:38] covering so he tried to make his own
[20:39] religion
[20:40] but god made his decision on how that he
[20:43] would meet man
[20:44] that was upon the shed blood and that's
[20:46] the only way no matter
[20:48] how much we try any other way that's the
[20:50] only place that god will meet
[20:52] man for fellowship is under the shed
[20:55] blood
[20:57] that's why there had to come a fresh
[21:00] kill of the word in this day
[21:04] because god's path is always the path of
[21:06] the blood
[21:07] and there always must be a blood
[21:08] atonement there has to be a fountain
[21:11] open
[21:11] somewhere amen where this blood is
[21:13] flowing where the life of the blood can
[21:15] come
[21:16] to the believer and so there had to be a
[21:18] fresh kill of the word in our day
[21:20] so that we could unite with the
[21:22] sacrificial lamb
[21:23] amen and so we could get to the blood
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] brother bam said they believe the
[21:29] denominations believe they're getting
[21:31] people to the blood
[21:32] amen but they reject the very plan to
[21:34] get to the blood
[21:35] the word amen the word was the plan so
[21:38] god in this day
[21:39] had a fresh kill of the word so that we
[21:42] could feast on a bleeding bloody word
[21:44] amen so that there's still
[21:46] blood in this word amen so that it's
[21:48] fresh amen there's still an
[21:49] atonement that comes with this word in
[21:52] this day
[21:54] amen it wasn't what bled out the
[21:55] previous day
[21:58] but it's a bleeding word for this day
[22:01] because under the bleeding word for this
[22:02] day
[22:03] there's a path to the atonement amen and
[22:05] the atonement will bring us
[22:07] reconciliation back to the father
[22:09] and bring us back into relationship and
[22:11] we cannot come that way
[22:13] without the fresh kill of the word in
[22:15] this day
[22:18] and that's why god provided it for us
[22:23] in this day
[22:27] praise be to god let's turn to the
[22:30] gospel of john john chapter 11.
[22:37] i've given you fair warning i have no
[22:39] idea
[22:41] how this is going to work but i'm
[22:44] trusting him amen
[22:45] [Music]
[22:48] and then just too many things too many
[22:50] pieces too much bubbling up
[22:52] to be able to understand so i'm not
[22:54] trying to understand
[22:56] amen trying just to relax
[23:00] john chapter 11 verse 45.
[23:08] then many of the jews which came to mary
[23:10] this is mary after the raising of
[23:12] lazarus
[23:13] as mary lazarus sister and it's seen the
[23:16] things which jesus did believed on him
[23:19] but some of them went their way to the
[23:20] pharisees and told them
[23:22] what things jesus had done then gathered
[23:25] the chief priests and the pharisees
[23:27] a counsel and said what do we for this
[23:30] man do with many miracles
[23:32] if we let him thus alone all men will
[23:34] believe on him
[23:36] and the romans shall come and take away
[23:38] both our place
[23:39] and nation
[23:44] and one of them named caiaphas being the
[23:46] high priest that same year
[23:48] said and to said unto them you know
[23:50] nothing at all nor consider that it is
[23:52] expedient for us that one man should die
[23:55] for the people
[23:56] and the whole nation perished not and
[23:58] this spaking not of himself but being
[24:00] high priest that year
[24:01] he prophesied that jesus should die for
[24:03] that nation
[24:04] and not for that nation only but that
[24:07] also he should gather
[24:08] together in one the children of god that
[24:10] were scattered abroad
[24:12] then from that day forth they took
[24:14] counsel together
[24:15] for to put him to death
[24:20] they chose
[24:24] to kill the word
[24:28] because who was jesus christ he was the
[24:30] word made manifest in their day
[24:33] he was the fullness of the word of god
[24:35] everything they claimed to believe he
[24:38] was
[24:39] every book that they read amen uh the
[24:42] the pentateuch all the writings of moses
[24:44] the psalms amen
[24:46] even the kings and the chronicles amen
[24:48] all through the prophets
[24:50] everything that they read he was the
[24:52] embodiment of everything that their
[24:54] religion was based on
[24:58] and the word was standing before them
[25:03] and they felt threatened by the word
[25:08] the manifested word the present day word
[25:10] the fullness of the word
[25:12] became a threat to them
[25:16] until they get to the place where they
[25:18] said now listen
[25:19] all will follow after him we're going to
[25:23] have an
[25:23] upset of the system
[25:27] and the romans will come
[25:31] who cares about the romans
[25:35] see the only ones who care about the
[25:36] romans are the ones who've gotten
[25:38] comfortable in the roman system
[25:42] and under the roman system they had a
[25:44] place
[25:45] in a nation amen they had authority they
[25:47] had protection amen
[25:49] they had an enforcing agent they had
[25:51] they may have had scuffles with the
[25:53] authorities they may have had tissues
[25:54] and tats
[25:55] but their conduct here proves that they
[25:57] had gotten
[25:58] comfortable under the roman system
[26:02] and under the roman system they had a
[26:04] place and a nation
[26:06] amen and they did not want this present
[26:08] day truth to
[26:10] upset their position and their place in
[26:13] the roman system
[26:15] so they were willing to crucify the word
[26:19] to keep their place to keep their
[26:22] religion
[26:23] to stay under the roman system
[26:28] so jesus christ became a
[26:31] threat to the spiritual leaders in that
[26:36] day
[26:39] and you say how can this be
[26:44] it's because they started adapting their
[26:46] own ideas and their own concepts
[26:49] and they long ago had left their love
[26:51] for the word
[26:52] but they loved their religion amen they
[26:55] loved their position
[26:56] they loved the security that came from
[26:59] all of us
[27:00] you know being united we're all jews
[27:02] amen we're all descendants of abraham
[27:05] we've got the law amen we're the oracles
[27:07] of god
[27:08] and they started to appreciate their
[27:10] position and they started to appreciate
[27:12] the security that came from that
[27:15] and they stopped loving god
[27:21] they stopped loving god and started
[27:24] loving the privileges that came from the
[27:27] religion
[27:29] they started loving the system of
[27:32] worship
[27:33] they started loving the system of
[27:36] rules and conducts and hierarchies and
[27:40] they started to love the system and they
[27:43] started to worship
[27:44] the system and they stopped worshiping
[27:48] god
[27:50] now who instituted their system god
[27:54] who instituted their feast days who who
[27:57] instituted their new moons and
[27:58] who who who had their daily oblations
[28:01] put in order who
[28:02] who set up the tabernacle whose did it
[28:04] god did it all
[28:05] amen god did it as a way for man to
[28:08] approach unto him and for man to know
[28:09] him
[28:10] amen god wanted them to know what all
[28:12] the vessels were amen he wanted to know
[28:14] what the
[28:15] what the three the the motion of three
[28:17] steps into the inner chamber was
[28:19] from the outer from outside the court to
[28:21] the outer court to the inner court to
[28:22] the holy of holies he wanted all of this
[28:24] he wanted the seven feast of the lord to
[28:26] be ingrained in them
[28:28] so that he could come along later amen
[28:30] and tell them what the tutor was trying
[28:31] to show
[28:32] them and so god wanted the word
[28:37] and god wanted the law amen god wanted
[28:40] the system that was set up he wanted
[28:42] this to be a way that he would reveal
[28:44] himself to his children
[28:46] and they could grow in the revelation of
[28:48] that word amen but the problem was they
[28:50] stopped seeking god
[28:52] and got comfortable with the system
[28:56] and now god was not their savior
[29:00] the system was their savior
[29:03] amen god was not the forgiver of sins
[29:07] their actions
[29:11] became the power that forgave them
[29:16] think on that for a minute were they
[29:19] doing wrong they were they were doing
[29:21] the right actions they were giving the
[29:22] right sacrifice
[29:24] they were doing it according to the word
[29:26] amen but the problem was
[29:27] their hearts desire changed their focus
[29:30] changed they meant
[29:31] their attitude and approach towards
[29:34] towards god's
[29:35] system had changed and they made it into
[29:38] something god didn't intend for it to be
[29:42] and now their ability to bring a lamb
[29:45] became the means of their salvation
[29:47] instead of a heavenly father that would
[29:49] look down on their obedience and forgive
[29:52] them
[29:54] and so now their forgiveness and their
[29:56] atonement
[29:57] and their their reconciliation to god
[29:59] all became
[30:00] based on their ability to produce
[30:04] what the system said
[30:10] like i said sunday i feel like i'm
[30:13] tiptoeing on the edge of a razor blade
[30:15] because these are the things god
[30:16] instituted they're right they're holy
[30:18] they're clean and they're good
[30:20] but when man takes the wrong approach
[30:22] toward these things amen
[30:24] his approach is wicked
[30:27] his approach is evil not the thing that
[30:29] god instituted never
[30:31] amen is not wicked amen but man's
[30:33] approach becomes wicked
[30:37] and so now
[30:41] they weren't looking to a heavenly
[30:44] father
[30:44] anymore for forgiveness they were
[30:47] looking to the system for forgiveness
[30:50] the approach the system of worship and
[30:53] they begin to
[30:54] alter it and doctor and add to it and
[30:57] take away
[30:58] they begin to to manipulate this system
[31:01] amen
[31:01] based off their own wants or their own
[31:03] needs or however they would begin to
[31:05] manipulate this
[31:06] because their heart was no longer in it
[31:08] for heavenly father
[31:09] their heart was now in the system for
[31:11] their own benefit
[31:15] and that where they begin to fall away
[31:19] in
[31:19] error because it was no longer
[31:22] a reproach into an approach into a
[31:25] heavenly loving father
[31:28] but now it was all about me being
[31:30] justified
[31:31] me being forgiven and me being right and
[31:34] me being protected and me getting
[31:36] blessings
[31:39] and then they begin to take the wrong
[31:40] approach towards these things
[31:44] so much so that they quit worshiping god
[31:48] and started worshiping the system
[31:52] say brother chad i'm telling you it's
[31:56] the truth
[31:59] because when god came to them according
[32:01] to the word
[32:02] they didn't want him but they were
[32:06] willing to take the roman system by both
[32:09] hands
[32:12] to keep the religion to push away their
[32:16] god
[32:19] when jesus christ came on the scene amen
[32:22] that was their god
[32:23] made flesh standing there the word that
[32:25] he promised
[32:26] it was all there amen and they acted
[32:29] like they wanted the messiah but when
[32:30] the messiah come they didn't want the
[32:32] messiah
[32:33] because the messiah was train wrecking
[32:35] their system
[32:37] he was ripping apart amen their their
[32:40] false
[32:40] security he was ripping apart amen their
[32:43] false notions and ideas amen
[32:45] their false affections he was exposing
[32:48] amen
[32:49] he was he was making their fig leaves
[32:52] nakedness
[32:54] and as he was doing that amen they did
[32:57] not want
[32:58] to lose the system so they were willing
[33:01] to identify with rome
[33:03] and even plead with rome and work with
[33:07] rome
[33:09] to get rid of god
[33:14] but they wanted to stay religious
[33:17] they wanted to keep moses and the law
[33:20] and the prophets
[33:21] and the torah and the books and the
[33:22] scrolls and the temple
[33:24] and the sacrifices and the burning of
[33:26] incense and the high priest
[33:28] they wanted all the form without god
[33:34] i tell you nothing's
[33:37] that's changed what man wants
[33:42] because god to come to god first
[33:45] you have to come to god and be made
[33:47] miserable
[33:48] poor blind wretched
[33:53] you have to you have to have an expose
[33:56] of your condition amen
[33:57] so that you realize all my religion has
[34:00] failed man all that
[34:01] all that i tried to do has failed me all
[34:03] that i my ideas are all carnal
[34:06] my desires are all selfish amen
[34:08] everything i wanted it's been false amen
[34:10] everything i thought the truth
[34:12] i find that was based on selfishness
[34:15] and now what i thought amen was was
[34:18] beauty
[34:19] and clothing and riches and have need of
[34:21] nothing
[34:22] amen i come to the message and the
[34:24] messenger of the app the word of god
[34:26] through the messenger of the hour
[34:27] begins to make all my religion nakedness
[34:29] amen and i find out i'm wretched and i'm
[34:32] miserable and i'm poor
[34:33] and i need him more than i've ever
[34:36] needed anything in my life
[34:37] [Applause]
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] but because man wants security amen when
[34:43] the word of god the voice of this day
[34:46] the voice of god that come walking in
[34:47] the evening time in the garden when he
[34:49] heard that voice he hid himself from god
[34:52] because he realized he was naked and he
[34:54] was covered in his own religion but he
[34:56] knew
[34:56] if that voice and that presence he was
[34:58] naked
[35:01] and because he feared because
[35:04] he was naked he hid from god
[35:08] and man is doing the same thing today
[35:11] and when that voice
[35:12] came in the evening time walking in the
[35:14] garden it was the voice of
[35:16] god showing that the presence of god was
[35:18] here amen and what he was doing
[35:20] he was making all religion fig leafs
[35:27] and there was a few
[35:31] who would realize that they're wretched
[35:33] [Music]
[35:35] like a tax collector or a fisherman
[35:40] or a prostitute or a samaritan with too
[35:42] many husbands
[35:46] it wasn't hard for them to realize that
[35:48] they were wretched
[35:50] and miserable and naked and needy
[35:54] and they ran to him because he was
[35:58] offering them cleansing his clothing
[36:00] isaf
[36:02] white raiment and gold amen
[36:05] but those who already had everything
[36:07] they needed for security
[36:12] you understand those who had everything
[36:15] they needed caiaphas
[36:17] had everything he needed to feel secure
[36:18] he was in the right lineage he was in
[36:20] the right
[36:21] family he was in the in the right nation
[36:23] he had the right position
[36:25] amen he had a position he had a nation
[36:27] he was secure
[36:28] and because he didn't recognize his need
[36:31] amen he
[36:32] didn't need god
[36:36] but he wanted his form of religion
[36:41] because this form of religion is what
[36:43] gave him his security
[36:47] let's go to john 19.
[36:50] praise god
[37:03] that's why i titled this protector of
[37:06] unbelief
[37:08] because religion gives itself as the
[37:10] premise of the upholder of truth
[37:14] all religions they come under the false
[37:16] notion that we are the upholders of
[37:18] truth
[37:19] but the reality is every religion
[37:23] is the protector of the unbeliever
[37:28] that's the reality because
[37:31] because when nimrod amen said let us
[37:34] not be scattered about but let us unify
[37:36] ourselves
[37:37] and build a city and a tower amen that
[37:40] tower would be for protection and man in
[37:41] case god would judge with the flood
[37:43] again that's what the prophet of god
[37:44] told us
[37:45] and so now let us unify ourselves
[37:49] see if anybody there believed god
[37:55] because god said i will set a token in
[37:57] the sky
[37:58] and that token will be the rainbow and
[38:00] that rainbow will be a covenant between
[38:02] me
[38:02] and all that has breath upon the earth
[38:04] and between me and the earth that i will
[38:06] never
[38:07] destroy the earth with a flood again
[38:11] is that his word so then
[38:14] if nebuchadnezzar now is or not
[38:16] nebuchadnezzar but nimrod now is going
[38:19] to build a tower
[38:20] amen where brother branham said amen if
[38:22] god will bring a flood we can run up
[38:24] here sing with the angels amen when the
[38:25] flood passes we can come back down and
[38:27] live any way we want
[38:28] amen the only people who would align
[38:30] themselves with nimrod's religion
[38:32] are the unbelievers who do not believe
[38:35] the word of god
[38:37] because god said he will not destroy the
[38:39] earth with a flood again
[38:40] and he also commanded them to multiply
[38:42] and replenish the earth
[38:44] and he scattered them out to multiply
[38:46] and replenish but nimrod is saying let
[38:48] us not be weak in the scattering but let
[38:50] us unify ourselves amen and anybody who
[38:52] believed the word of god
[38:54] would not have come together for his
[38:56] city for his unified
[38:58] empire so now nimrod is building a
[39:02] religion
[39:04] that will protect the unbeliever
[39:11] so the devil is so deceptive that he
[39:14] sells religion as the upholder of truth
[39:17] when in fact he's the guardian of
[39:20] unbelief
[39:24] he is the shepherd and protector
[39:28] of the unbelievers
[39:31] and he uses the walled cities of
[39:33] religion to harbor and protect the
[39:35] unbelievers
[39:39] how so have you ever talked to somebody
[39:42] about water baptism in jesus name and
[39:43] showed them the scriptures and they
[39:45] believed you
[39:47] and then they went and talked to their
[39:48] pastor
[39:50] and then they came back to you the next
[39:52] week and said i don't believe that
[39:53] that's false my pastor
[39:55] said what is that church amen
[39:58] that church is a harbor of unbelievers
[40:01] amen
[40:02] they're not there to uphold church they
[40:04] are there amen to
[40:05] barricade and block the people from
[40:07] getting to truth
[40:11] and they are there to harbor unbelievers
[40:13] amen because when you begin to teach
[40:15] water baptism in jesus name to somebody
[40:18] amen and they catch it intellectually
[40:21] because brother branham said you don't
[40:22] even need a revelation for that
[40:25] they catch it intellectually
[40:29] they run to the pastor and the pastor
[40:31] talks them out of it
[40:32] intellectually it shows there was no
[40:36] revelation in the heart
[40:40] and when they come back to you and
[40:42] they've been talked out of it
[40:43] intellectually
[40:46] now the religion has now protected the
[40:50] unbeliever from god
[40:54] and how many times has that happened
[40:59] but that person goes to that church and
[41:02] is part of that religious order
[41:04] because that religion is an upholder of
[41:06] truth
[41:08] but their actions prove that they're a
[41:10] barrier to truth
[41:14] and a harbourer of unbelief
[41:19] romans 19
[41:23] verse 10
[41:29] then saith pilate unto him this is jesus
[41:32] trial
[41:33] this is proud unto him speak thou not
[41:35] unto me knowest
[41:36] thou not that i have power to crucify
[41:38] thee and i have power to release thee
[41:40] jesus answered thou couldest have no
[41:42] power at all against me except it were
[41:44] given thee from above
[41:46] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[41:48] hath the greater sin
[41:52] and from henceforth pilate sought to
[41:54] release him
[41:55] but the jews cried out saying if thou
[41:57] let this man go thou art
[41:59] not caesar's friend whosoever make
[42:02] himself a king speaketh against caesar
[42:04] when pilate therefore heard the saying
[42:06] he brought jesus
[42:07] forth and sat down in the judgment seat
[42:10] in a place that is called the pavement
[42:11] but in the hebrew
[42:12] gabatha and it was the preparation of
[42:15] the passover in about the sixth hour
[42:17] and he saith unto the jews behold your
[42:19] king but they cried away with him
[42:22] away with him crucify him pilate saith
[42:25] unto them shall i crucify your king
[42:27] the chief priest answered we have
[42:30] no king but caesar
[42:40] we're at the most religious place
[42:43] jerusalem who the most religious leaders
[42:51] part of what was the correct church
[42:56] to that day is that right
[43:00] where else was god working he was
[43:01] working through the jews he was working
[43:03] through jerusalem amen until jesus come
[43:05] and when they crucified him they put him
[43:07] that word into full effect
[43:10] so that jerusalem was the order
[43:12] jerusalem the most holy place
[43:15] the correct church
[43:19] the high priest the chief priests
[43:24] they would get so entrenched in their
[43:26] system
[43:27] and become so antagonistic against the
[43:30] living word
[43:32] that they would cry out we have no
[43:36] king but caesar
[43:41] absolutely denying the word
[43:45] absolutely denying their father
[43:49] and they would choose listen
[43:53] they would choose the system
[43:57] over the living word
[44:00] they would ch choose the roman system
[44:04] over the living word because the living
[44:06] word was exposing their need
[44:10] and they wanted to cover their need
[44:13] because religion
[44:14] is a covering a way for men to hide from
[44:17] god
[44:19] and jesus was ripping the veil of the
[44:21] covering to get his children to come out
[44:23] of theirs to see their need
[44:25] so that they would go beyond the camp
[44:27] and be united to him
[44:30] now there was a unification amen
[44:34] in israel in this day of two sects
[44:37] two factions within the jewish church
[44:40] and
[44:40] they were sadducees and and pharisees
[44:44] and the pharisees were your legalists
[44:48] the pharisees were those who loved rule
[44:50] and order and
[44:51] structure and the religion and they just
[44:54] kept piling more on
[44:56] and adjusting the rules and adapting
[44:58] them and making the rules
[44:59] and then you had the sadducees and the
[45:01] sadducees were the liberals in that day
[45:04] and they both were part of the chief
[45:06] priest and they were unified together
[45:08] for the casting out of jesus
[45:12] and i just would like to talk about this
[45:13] legalism and liberalism for a moment
[45:16] because you find out that they're
[45:18] opposite ends of the same thing
[45:21] they are the same thing and there's
[45:23] something that the devil has used to
[45:25] appeal to two different natures of
[45:26] people
[45:28] but it brings them into the same trap
[45:31] whether it's liberalism
[45:34] or what we i would call
[45:37] i would call disgraceful grace
[45:41] grace to disgrace is what brother brahma
[45:43] said
[45:45] or legalism and they're both
[45:48] providing people the same thing in a
[45:51] different way
[45:52] and they're both unified together
[45:55] against christ
[45:58] brother ben said in the message you must
[46:00] be born again he said
[46:02] not trying to squeeze in a calvinistic
[46:04] belief now you see
[46:05] i'm not in saying this now saying this
[46:08] know that i'm talking to a legalist
[46:09] people
[46:10] that's not it at all because i'm a
[46:12] legalist too but believe this that
[46:14] calvin had something and so did armenian
[46:16] have something and they both had
[46:18] something but they run off on the deep
[46:20] ends of it
[46:21] the calvin is saying well i'm saved and
[46:22] just that settles it his life
[46:24] proves that he isn't then he isn't saved
[46:29] the calvinist says i'm just saved that's
[46:31] it amen once saved always saved
[46:33] and brother ben i'm aligned very much
[46:35] with what calvin taught in many many
[46:37] ways but he's starting to talk about
[46:38] he's starting to separate this out
[46:40] he said his life proved that he isn't
[46:42] then he isn't saved
[46:44] and the legalist says i've got to do
[46:46] this and i must do this and i must do
[46:48] that
[46:49] then if you're not born again you're
[46:51] still not saved
[46:54] so there you are see it's in between in
[46:57] the middle of the road is where we've
[46:58] got to stay
[47:00] what are you what is calvinism what is
[47:02] what grace is
[47:03] is what god did for you but what works
[47:05] is what you do for god an appreciation
[47:07] of what he did for you through grace
[47:10] that's the whole answer then if i'm
[47:12] saved then i live like i'm saved but
[47:14] i couldn't live like i could live like i
[47:16] was saved and not be saved
[47:19] that's the fallacy of legalism i could
[47:22] live like i'm saved
[47:23] and not be saved but if i'm
[47:26] saved i'll live like i'm saved
[47:32] so see if the fact then brings it to the
[47:34] spot that we must be born again
[47:38] so the born-again experience tells what
[47:40] we are it doesn't mean
[47:41] i believe in shouting in all
[47:43] manifestations and not demonstrations of
[47:45] the spirit
[47:45] but yet that's not it yet it's something
[47:48] different from that
[47:49] it's a new creature something in the
[47:51] heart
[47:53] so brother branham is starting to speak
[47:55] about this calvinism
[47:58] uh which he says is extreme grace
[48:01] and then armenianism which would be
[48:03] legalism
[48:05] and he's telling us it's right in the
[48:07] middle
[48:10] and in marriage and divorce he says it's
[48:12] just like today there's two great
[48:14] schools of doctrine in the church one of
[48:15] them is calvinism the other one
[48:17] is armenianism one of them is legalist
[48:20] the other one is grace
[48:21] and we come to find out that the people
[48:23] who believe in grace the calvinist
[48:25] they say bless god it don't hurt me to
[48:26] smoke it don't hurt me to drink
[48:28] i can do these things i've got eternal
[48:30] security then we find the other side on
[48:32] the legal it said
[48:33] oh i would like to ball them out i would
[48:35] like to show them a piece of my mind but
[48:36] i'm a christian i have to keep still
[48:39] see you find yourself on two different
[48:41] roads and neither one of them is right
[48:46] oh i hope we can catch that neither one
[48:48] of them
[48:49] is right now you know there's no reason
[48:53] for me preaching this if we're going to
[48:55] find it everywhere else amen
[48:57] but these are the spirits that try to
[48:58] creep in all around us pharisees and
[49:01] or sadduceeism amen extreme grace or
[49:04] legalism
[49:05] and what legalism
[49:08] wants to produce something that you can
[49:10] do to feel
[49:11] secure that you're saved a works a
[49:16] a a a system an approach something that
[49:19] that you can do amen
[49:21] you can dress right and i mean you know
[49:25] the truth of the matter is if you've got
[49:27] god in your heart amen you've been born
[49:29] again by
[49:30] the spirit of god and that seed is
[49:31] quickened that seed is the word
[49:33] it'll take all the word and it'll
[49:35] manifest all the word
[49:37] so you know that that word in that word
[49:41] it's not right
[49:42] amen for a woman to cut her hair it's
[49:43] not right for her to dress like a man
[49:45] it's not right for a man to dress like a
[49:47] woman
[49:47] these things are not right the dirty
[49:50] jokes and the vulgarity
[49:51] and it's not right amen so the seed
[49:54] inside will produce the life that
[49:56] aligned to the word
[49:58] amen but what the legalist will do is
[50:00] try to produce a work say man
[50:03] a set of instructions an order of
[50:05] operation in the church amen
[50:07] so that the devil can take that order of
[50:09] operation and
[50:10] he can begin to build a false security
[50:16] it's where a woman won't cut her hair
[50:18] and she won't dress him modestly and a
[50:20] man won't tell dirty jokes
[50:21] and they'll kick a tv out of their house
[50:23] and won't listen to the wrong music and
[50:26] and then all of a sudden you realize
[50:28] that after a while in this vein of
[50:30] thinking
[50:31] that you begin to study the message to
[50:34] find the new church order
[50:39] under the legalistic thinking we begin
[50:42] to study the message
[50:43] and as we study the message we would
[50:46] never
[50:46] admit to this but under a legalistic
[50:49] teaching and under a legalistic spirit
[50:51] when that pharisee spirit which is not
[50:53] dead
[50:55] [Music]
[50:56] would come and try to trip up the church
[50:58] of god amen
[50:59] under that pharisee spirit you would
[51:02] begin to start studying the message
[51:04] and in studying the message the motive
[51:06] behind it
[51:07] would to be defined what the order of
[51:10] the church is
[51:12] so that i can keep the order so that i
[51:15] can feel okay
[51:21] and if you have a temperament like mine
[51:23] where you're
[51:24] a square with pointy corners
[51:28] and you like rules amen and you read the
[51:31] rule book before you play the game
[51:36] then that system works okay for you
[51:40] because just tell me what to do and i'll
[51:42] do it what do i have to do to be right
[51:45] well you can't cut your hair uh unless
[51:48] you're a man
[51:50] get the tv out of your house watch what
[51:53] you watch
[51:54] watch what you say come to church every
[51:56] time the doors are open because there's
[51:57] a quote for that
[51:59] make sure you pay your tithes give an
[52:02] offering on top of that because we've
[52:03] got scripture for that and
[52:08] lay it out for me i just want to know
[52:12] what the rules are
[52:14] now this isn't the words we used but
[52:17] this is the spirit that gets behind that
[52:21] and then i'll i just want to if i can
[52:24] keep the rules
[52:25] then if i can look like a believer and
[52:28] talk like a believer
[52:30] and fellowship with the believers then i
[52:33] can
[52:34] feel like a believer
[52:37] but feeling like a believer doesn't make
[52:40] you a believer
[52:42] it doesn't make me a believer and under
[52:44] the legalistic style
[52:46] you find now because you're always
[52:48] trying to feel like a believer
[52:50] you always got to be finding more rules
[52:55] because you feel like a believer when
[52:58] you can keep the order of the message
[53:01] now the order of the message is not
[53:03] wrong it's right
[53:06] but it depends on your approach because
[53:09] it's just the word of god
[53:13] but then because we want to
[53:16] feel justified
[53:19] we want to know what the rules are or
[53:21] what the order are
[53:24] so we really like it when a minister
[53:26] burns us up
[53:32] and when he really tears us and rips to
[53:36] hide off
[53:37] amen why because i'm finding security
[53:41] in conforming to the rules
[53:45] now there's not nothing wrong with a
[53:47] minister taking the height off when
[53:49] there's a good hiding that's needed
[53:52] but you can see how we could gravitate
[53:55] amen ourselves to a ministry that'll
[53:58] constantly
[53:58] line us up line us up line us up line us
[54:00] up if lining up makes us feel secure
[54:05] if lining up makes us feel like a
[54:08] believer because
[54:09] i do everything brother benham said
[54:15] praise god amen
[54:19] but you have no security in the grace of
[54:21] god
[54:23] you have no security in your bridegroom
[54:25] you have no joy in your salvation
[54:27] amen you have no peace in your heart
[54:30] you're rejecting
[54:31] the peace that comes from the bridegroom
[54:34] trying to find security in an order
[54:38] amen and then
[54:42] when we feel a little insecure we just
[54:44] want daddy to give us another weapon
[54:48] from the pulpit so that i can say i
[54:51] agree with that so i can feel like a
[54:53] believer again
[54:58] amen i hope the devil's getting exposed
[55:07] but then you have the flip side where
[55:10] the sadducees were secure
[55:12] because of who they were and what they
[55:14] were associated with
[55:18] the security came from the fact that
[55:19] they were jews and they had the right
[55:21] religion
[55:24] but not from belief in the word because
[55:26] the bible says that they did not believe
[55:28] in resurrection
[55:30] they did not believe in angels and did
[55:31] not believe in spirits
[55:33] they were rejecters of the word but they
[55:35] felt totally comfortable
[55:36] because they were jews and they were in
[55:38] jerusalem and they were part of the
[55:40] system
[55:44] because i'm part of a message church i'm
[55:47] in the message
[55:49] because i've i've joined the right
[55:51] church amen
[55:52] because you can take either side of this
[55:54] amen on the legalistic side when we
[55:56] begin to find out that my doctrine
[55:58] wasn't right
[55:59] oh my baptist doctor does it right i
[56:01] realize now my baptist doctor knows that
[56:02] right
[56:03] oh it scares me that my baptist doctrine
[56:05] was wrong tell me what the right
[56:06] doctrine is so i can believe the right
[56:08] doctrine so i can feel safe
[56:16] on the sadducees side
[56:20] it's not about the right or wrong
[56:22] doctrine it's about the right church
[56:26] if i'm associated with the right thing
[56:29] if i'm
[56:30] part of by joining myself to the right
[56:33] church the right movement the right
[56:34] belief system
[56:36] then i'm okay
[56:40] and they're both wrong
[56:50] one is searching the message
[56:53] for an order that can be kept
[56:56] to bring security
[56:59] and this side also starts to feel more
[57:01] secure when they can find
[57:03] faults in others
[57:06] that leads to more security because i
[57:09] know the word enough to know you're
[57:11] wrong
[57:12] that makes me right
[57:15] amen and so we can preach about
[57:17] everybody else is wrong and everything
[57:19] else is wrong
[57:20] and this is wrong and that's wrong and
[57:22] you're wrong and you're your mother is
[57:23] wrong your answer wrong and every other
[57:25] church is wrong
[57:28] and what's the implied message
[57:32] we're right if we can find what's wrong
[57:36] everywhere else
[57:37] then the implied message is we must be
[57:39] right
[57:42] and you can be correct
[57:45] in your observations and still be wrong
[57:49] in your heart
[57:55] or we can take this side
[57:58] and we say what the baptist church is
[58:00] wrong
[58:01] what's right the message is right all
[58:03] right i'm in the message
[58:06] if the message is right i'm in the
[58:07] message
[58:11] no real change either way
[58:14] no heart change no conversion no new
[58:17] birth no new creature
[58:19] no life of christ on the inside just an
[58:22] outward
[58:23] confirmation conformity and an outward
[58:25] joining amen
[58:26] just so that we can feel comfortable and
[58:28] we can get to the place
[58:30] where we can build a system amen taking
[58:33] truth nothing wrong with the word
[58:35] nothing wrong with the truth
[58:36] but with the wrong approach to the truth
[58:39] we can begin to build a wrong
[58:41] security
[58:46] because our approach is wrong
[58:50] and we can build a false security to
[58:53] where
[58:54] because we can keep the rules and
[58:56] because we can see where everybody else
[58:58] doesn't keep the rules then we
[58:59] are right or because i'm part of what's
[59:02] right it automatically makes me right
[59:04] no matter what i do on the side or when
[59:06] nobody's looking or
[59:08] my private life at home
[59:11] that doesn't matter because i'm in the
[59:16] message
[59:21] and we don't want either one of those
[59:26] there's there's enough truth to either
[59:29] one to make them deceptive
[59:32] but the real truth is right in the
[59:33] middle
[59:36] i can live like i'm saved and not be
[59:37] saved but if i'm saved i'll live like
[59:39] i'm saved
[59:43] it's all about creating a false sense
[59:47] of security
[59:52] and on either one when you begin to take
[59:57] away the security the teeth come out
[1:00:03] on either side if you begin
[1:00:07] the the to talk about the grace of god
[1:00:09] amen on the legalist side
[1:00:11] and begin to expose a false security and
[1:00:13] when the teeth come out amen
[1:00:15] and then they start finding fault in you
[1:00:17] and well you don't do that and your
[1:00:19] church doesn't do that and i'm
[1:00:20] they're just looking for a reason to
[1:00:22] scratch you off the list
[1:00:26] so that they don't have to hear to the
[1:00:28] exposing words that's making nakedness
[1:00:32] until we scratch so many people off the
[1:00:34] list
[1:00:36] there's nobody left so who's in the
[1:00:39] authority
[1:00:41] the only one left was scratched and
[1:00:43] scratched and scratched and scratched
[1:00:45] and scratched
[1:00:48] but you can get on this other side of
[1:00:51] where it's all about
[1:00:54] being part of the group
[1:00:58] and all of a sudden being a message
[1:00:59] believer is somebody who goes to a
[1:01:01] message church and believes that god
[1:01:02] sent a prophet
[1:01:06] and can begin to allow the world to
[1:01:09] creep into their life
[1:01:13] and can begin to dabble with
[1:01:16] uh the things that you know we used to
[1:01:19] run out
[1:01:21] the kind of music and clothing and
[1:01:23] entertainment and things that were not
[1:01:25] accepted
[1:01:26] now begin to get accepted amen and then
[1:01:29] under this system of grace under this
[1:01:32] extreme grace or what i call aggressive
[1:01:34] grace
[1:01:36] if you begin to point out what the
[1:01:37] prophet taught on those things
[1:01:42] if you just begin to point out what the
[1:01:44] prophet said about how we should dress
[1:01:46] and and and what entertainments we
[1:01:48] should have and what we should kick out
[1:01:49] of our house what we should allow and
[1:01:50] what we should not allow it
[1:01:52] and just begin to talk about those
[1:01:53] things all of a sudden
[1:01:56] who begins to defend the unbelief
[1:02:01] the church begins to defend the unbelief
[1:02:03] and all of a sudden you become critical
[1:02:07] and judgmental does that happen to any
[1:02:10] of you
[1:02:11] it's happened to me you become you have
[1:02:14] a critical judgmental spirit
[1:02:16] because you don't care about that person
[1:02:18] amen you're just
[1:02:20] all you care about is dressing right
[1:02:22] looking right and all that and all
[1:02:23] you've done
[1:02:24] is try to say this isn't what the
[1:02:25] prophet taught
[1:02:27] why are we letting this in the church
[1:02:29] why are we moving this
[1:02:30] why aren't we correcting this why aren't
[1:02:32] we changing this amen this is not what
[1:02:34] the prophet taught
[1:02:35] and when you begin to bring the word
[1:02:37] amen and expose the nakedness
[1:02:39] they'll let you know right away that
[1:02:41] you've got a critical judgmental spirit
[1:02:44] you don't care about people you have no
[1:02:46] love and you might be serpent seed
[1:02:52] that sounds crazy but that's exactly the
[1:02:54] path it takes
[1:02:57] exactly i've already been down that path
[1:03:03] until you go to talk to the pastor about
[1:03:05] what the prophet said
[1:03:07] and you end up leaving like there's
[1:03:08] something wrong with you
[1:03:11] and you're the believer you just believe
[1:03:14] what he said you believe what he said
[1:03:16] it's true and with something we should
[1:03:18] live by and all of a sudden you walk
[1:03:20] away and you feel like there's something
[1:03:21] wrong with you
[1:03:22] that you're critical that you're
[1:03:23] judgmental that you don't care about
[1:03:25] people you have no love you don't have
[1:03:27] the love of god and there's something
[1:03:28] wrong with you
[1:03:29] and then you begin to question am i the
[1:03:30] believer
[1:03:33] what happened the church became the
[1:03:35] defender of unbelief
[1:03:38] the protector the harbor the pastor will
[1:03:41] begin to
[1:03:41] harbor over unbelief
[1:03:46] praise god now don't misunderstand me
[1:03:49] we're not talking about a visitor
[1:03:50] we're not talking about somebody who's a
[1:03:52] teenager never had their experience yet
[1:03:54] but we're talking about people who know
[1:03:56] the message amen
[1:03:57] it's claimed to have an experience live
[1:03:59] victorious for years and all of a sudden
[1:04:01] these things begin
[1:04:01] to creep back in and now we begin to
[1:04:04] bring things
[1:04:05] in amen to what's called the message
[1:04:07] that was never permitted before
[1:04:10] and the worldliness begins to get in
[1:04:13] amen but
[1:04:14] but because we're in the message we're
[1:04:15] okay that's the spirit that was on the
[1:04:18] sadducees
[1:04:21] we're fine amen and all sudden the high
[1:04:24] heels come in
[1:04:24] and the short skirts and the tight
[1:04:26] clothes amen and
[1:04:28] the makeup but we can find a quote where
[1:04:32] brother bam said you know
[1:04:36] and all of a sudden
[1:04:39] all of a sudden the church becomes the
[1:04:41] protector of unbelief
[1:04:49] see
[1:04:52] the devil is so subtle and so deceptive
[1:04:58] so subtle and so deceptive
[1:05:02] that he'll gather a group of people
[1:05:07] and put a label over that group of
[1:05:09] people and because you love the people
[1:05:11] and want to be with the people
[1:05:13] whether you've had experience or not
[1:05:15] he'll let you believe you're okay
[1:05:23] and you may be far from okay
[1:05:27] the jews believed they were okay but
[1:05:29] they were far from okay
[1:05:33] they had generations of keeping the
[1:05:36] order
[1:05:38] generations of being part of the system
[1:05:42] until they got so inoculated
[1:05:46] so accustomed to the system that when
[1:05:50] jesus christ showed up
[1:05:53] they wanted caesar instead
[1:05:58] talk about extreme that's extreme
[1:06:03] but i don't ever want to get to the
[1:06:05] place where jesus christ comes knocking
[1:06:07] on my door with a revelation
[1:06:09] that i want my system and my comfort in
[1:06:11] my way of thinking so much
[1:06:12] that i'll reject him when he reveals
[1:06:14] himself to me today
[1:06:16] because he is the unveiled god unveiling
[1:06:19] himself to his bride today
[1:06:20] and i want all that he has for me and i
[1:06:23] don't want to get so settled down and so
[1:06:24] comfortable
[1:06:25] being part of something that i'm okay
[1:06:27] i've got the rules down pat that i'm
[1:06:29] okay but i want to constantly say i need
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:32] every hour i need the i want thy
[1:06:34] eyesalve i want thy gold i want thy
[1:06:36] raiment
[1:06:37] i want everything that you have for me
[1:06:39] i'm not okay
[1:06:40] till i've got all of you
[1:06:43] and i'm not okay until my atoms change
[1:06:46] i'm not okay
[1:06:47] until i shift dimensions and completion
[1:06:49] i i'm not okay
[1:06:51] i want to keep seeking and i want to i
[1:06:54] want to stay open to him and
[1:06:55] i don't want to enter into a walled city
[1:06:57] i want to stay outside the camp
[1:06:59] i don't want to settle down i don't want
[1:07:01] to fall security i want my security to
[1:07:04] come from my relationship with jesus
[1:07:05] christ
[1:07:07] the fact that he's unveiled himself to
[1:07:09] me and still unveiling himself to me
[1:07:11] that there's a love affair that there's
[1:07:13] a relationship back and forth
[1:07:15] that there's a reality to it amen not a
[1:07:18] system not an
[1:07:18] order not a form not a ritual but him
[1:07:21] the person
[1:07:22] of the word united with me constantly
[1:07:25] whispering love secrets in my ear
[1:07:28] that's our security friends not a
[1:07:31] pharisee system not a sadducee system
[1:07:33] amen no
[1:07:34] church system but our security comes
[1:07:36] from him
[1:07:47] the message cannot be denominated
[1:07:50] because the message is him
[1:07:54] but it doesn't mean that people who
[1:07:56] associate themselves around the message
[1:07:58] cannot have denominational spirits
[1:08:00] circling around
[1:08:02] it does not mean that you do not have
[1:08:04] denominational spirits
[1:08:06] trying to infiltrate your mind
[1:08:10] trying to move you off your security and
[1:08:12] christ
[1:08:13] and trying to bring you to another
[1:08:14] security
[1:08:16] on this side or this side amen to get
[1:08:18] you to a place where
[1:08:20] you've just settled down am i met jesus
[1:08:22] christ
[1:08:23] i've had my experience i'm okay and now
[1:08:25] yeah i know i shouldn't be looking at
[1:08:26] that i know i shouldn't be watching that
[1:08:28] i
[1:08:28] i know i i know i know but god
[1:08:36] understands
[1:08:38] praise god or be over here
[1:08:41] and i'm so tore up and hateful and
[1:08:43] bitter and critical
[1:08:45] because i have to constantly keep an
[1:08:47] order that's not real
[1:08:50] to my soul i'm constantly
[1:08:56] constantly chaining myself back
[1:08:59] to keep the rules i've got long hair and
[1:09:03] a long skirt enough temper to fight a
[1:09:05] buzzsaw
[1:09:09] and go to a church that's got the order
[1:09:11] down pat and keep the order down pat
[1:09:14] keep all the rules and do it all but so
[1:09:16] contentious and hateful in our family
[1:09:19] that all our children
[1:09:20] see is not the life of christ but a mom
[1:09:21] and dad that's always at each other's
[1:09:23] throats
[1:09:25] but yet we go to the right church that
[1:09:26] has the right order and we keep all
[1:09:28] right and mom's never cut her hair and
[1:09:29] she's never wore a short skirt
[1:09:34] but so much tension in the home
[1:09:38] because it's not the life of christ it's
[1:09:40] a put on
[1:09:42] and ever whenever you begin to put on
[1:09:44] the religion on the outside and put on
[1:09:46] the order on the outside
[1:09:47] when it's not coming from the inside out
[1:09:49] but the outside in amen
[1:09:51] when that happens corruption always
[1:09:53] starts in the inside
[1:09:55] and that corruption goes into hiding
[1:09:58] because your security comes
[1:09:59] from being right in the right church and
[1:10:01] right in the eyes of the other believers
[1:10:03] so the corruption moves inside deep
[1:10:06] inside and now
[1:10:07] amen privately you become very corrupt
[1:10:10] but publicly you become very correct
[1:10:17] because it's an outside in not an inside
[1:10:20] house
[1:10:27] doesn't matter you say
[1:10:30] i believe everything brother benjamin
[1:10:31] said and i do everything he said do
[1:10:34] but if you've not been born again you're
[1:10:36] still not right
[1:10:44] you say i believe every word of god i
[1:10:46] believe everything the prophet said
[1:10:48] but if you your life still won't line to
[1:10:50] the word still not
[1:10:57] let's go right matthew 23. i'm going to
[1:11:00] read a couple more scriptures
[1:11:17] i'd like to make this statement
[1:11:21] if your children don't know you're a
[1:11:23] believer you're not a believer
[1:11:28] if your wife doesn't know you're a
[1:11:30] believer
[1:11:31] you're not a believer
[1:11:36] because we can act a certain way for a
[1:11:38] certain period of time
[1:11:40] and a certain but those who know us
[1:11:43] most know us knows the truth
[1:11:46] they know the reality matthew 23
[1:11:52] 13.
[1:11:57] 23-13 but woe unto you scribes and
[1:11:59] pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the
[1:12:01] kingdom of heaven against men
[1:12:03] for ye neither go go in yourselves
[1:12:05] neither suffer ye them that are entering
[1:12:07] to go
[1:12:08] in you have become you can't go
[1:12:12] but you've become a barrier to others
[1:12:14] going
[1:12:16] let's go down to verse 25. well unto you
[1:12:19] scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you
[1:12:21] make clean the outside of the cup
[1:12:23] and of the cup and of the platter but
[1:12:26] within they are full of extortion and
[1:12:28] excess
[1:12:29] thou blind pharisee cleanse first that
[1:12:31] which is within the cup and the platter
[1:12:33] that the outside of them may be clean
[1:12:35] also
[1:12:36] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:12:38] hypocrites for your like unto white
[1:12:40] sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful
[1:12:42] outward but are within full of dead
[1:12:44] men's bones and all
[1:12:46] uncleanness even so you also outwardly
[1:12:49] appear righteous unto men but within
[1:12:51] you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:12:55] they look good but they weren't good
[1:12:59] they kept the order but it wasn't enough
[1:13:04] jesus come in contact with a rich young
[1:13:06] ruler one day
[1:13:07] he begins to ask him questions and the
[1:13:08] rich young ruler begins to answer into
[1:13:10] the affirmative to jesus all this i have
[1:13:12] done
[1:13:14] since my youth i've kept all the orders
[1:13:16] i've kept all the rules and when jesus
[1:13:17] questions him
[1:13:18] and you know the commandment to do this
[1:13:20] do this do this and he says all this
[1:13:21] i've done from my youth
[1:13:25] and jesus looked right down at his heart
[1:13:28] and he realized here was a man who loved
[1:13:30] himself morning loved god
[1:13:33] and he went right to the heart and said
[1:13:37] but sell
[1:13:38] all that thou hast and give to the poor
[1:13:40] and come and follow
[1:13:42] me he had an opportunity
[1:13:45] to walk with the word to walk with jesus
[1:13:48] christ and he turned his back on jesus
[1:13:50] christ for the real love of his heart
[1:13:53] which was his riches outside
[1:13:56] perfect stand in the face of jesus and
[1:13:59] say i've done it
[1:14:00] all but he did not have a heart that
[1:14:04] loved god
[1:14:05] more than his riches
[1:14:09] brother ben said in the message
[1:14:10] thirsting for life he said oh i've seen
[1:14:11] people shout dance in the spirit speak
[1:14:13] with tongues
[1:14:14] and enough temper to fight above saul
[1:14:16] and go out and live
[1:14:17] every day ungodly and half dress
[1:14:18] themselves and do shady deals and
[1:14:20] everything like that
[1:14:21] brother that's not fruits of the spirit
[1:14:24] come on back to the bible come back to
[1:14:26] the fountain come back and receive
[1:14:28] christ these other little things will
[1:14:29] take care of themselves
[1:14:31] as long as you receive christ and the
[1:14:32] life is going with it these
[1:14:34] other things will flow freely but don't
[1:14:36] try to get the other things before you
[1:14:38] get christ
[1:14:39] he is the fountain of life the only
[1:14:40] resource and he's the inexhaustible
[1:14:42] fountain of life
[1:14:44] you cannot exhaust his goodness and his
[1:14:46] mercy
[1:14:48] i want to look at philippians quickly
[1:14:49] there's several scriptures i want to go
[1:14:51] to keep your bibles handy
[1:14:53] we'll flip through these philippians
[1:14:57] chapter 3.
[1:15:02] philippians chapter 3
[1:15:07] and verse 4.
[1:15:13] though i might also have confidence in
[1:15:15] the flesh this is the apostle paul
[1:15:17] speaking
[1:15:18] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[1:15:20] whereof he might trust in his flesh more
[1:15:22] circumcise the eighth day of the stock
[1:15:24] of israel of the tribe of benjamin
[1:15:26] a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the
[1:15:28] law of pharisee
[1:15:30] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:15:32] touching the righteousness
[1:15:33] which is in the law blameless
[1:15:37] but what things were gained to me those
[1:15:40] i count
[1:15:40] lost for christ yea doubtless and i
[1:15:44] count all things but lost for the
[1:15:45] excellency of the knowledge of christ
[1:15:47] jesus
[1:15:48] my lord for whom i have suffered the
[1:15:50] loss of all things and do count them but
[1:15:53] done
[1:15:53] that i may win christ
[1:16:00] paul in the jewish religion
[1:16:03] had it all going galatians 1 13 he says
[1:16:07] for you have heard of my conversion in
[1:16:09] times past
[1:16:10] in the jews religion how that beyond
[1:16:13] measure i persecuted the church of god
[1:16:14] and wasted it
[1:16:15] and profited in the jews religion above
[1:16:18] many mine equals in my
[1:16:20] own nation be more being more
[1:16:22] exceedingly zealous
[1:16:23] of the traditions of the fathers
[1:16:28] paul he was benefiting
[1:16:32] more so than all his brethren in the
[1:16:34] jewish religion
[1:16:36] he had zeal he was a pharisee of the
[1:16:39] of the stock of benjamin a hebrew of the
[1:16:41] hebrew circumcised on the eighth day
[1:16:44] he had everything right
[1:16:48] he was wrong
[1:16:51] and when he heard a voice
[1:16:54] that came from the light that exposed
[1:16:57] his neckiness
[1:16:59] he was willing to leave all and take
[1:17:01] that voice
[1:17:03] he counted it all but dung that he might
[1:17:06] win
[1:17:07] christ
[1:17:14] let's look at revelation 18.
[1:17:22] revelation 18 and 1.
[1:17:29] and after these things i saw another
[1:17:30] angel come down from heaven having great
[1:17:32] power
[1:17:33] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:17:34] glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:17:36] strong voice saying babylon the greatest
[1:17:38] fallen
[1:17:39] has fallen and has become the habitation
[1:17:41] of devils and the hold of every foul
[1:17:43] spirit
[1:17:44] in the cage of every clean and hateful
[1:17:46] bird
[1:17:48] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:17:49] about religion
[1:17:52] where are all these unclean spirits and
[1:17:55] hateful birds
[1:17:57] and religion for
[1:18:00] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[1:18:01] the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:18:03] kings of the earth have committed
[1:18:04] fornication with her
[1:18:06] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[1:18:07] rich through the abundance of her
[1:18:09] delicacies
[1:18:10] and i heard another voice from heaven
[1:18:11] saying come out of her my people
[1:18:13] that ye be not partakers of her sins and
[1:18:15] that you receive not of her plagues
[1:18:18] for her sins have reached into heaven
[1:18:19] and and god has remembered her
[1:18:21] iniquities reward her even as she
[1:18:23] rewarded you
[1:18:24] and double under her double according to
[1:18:26] her works and the cup which she has
[1:18:28] filled to her double
[1:18:30] how much she had glorified herself and
[1:18:32] lived deliciously
[1:18:33] so much torment and sorrow give her for
[1:18:35] she saith in her heart i
[1:18:36] sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[1:18:39] see no sorrow
[1:18:42] the blindness of the s of satan's
[1:18:44] religion
[1:18:47] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:18:49] day death and mourning and famine
[1:18:51] and she shall be utterly burned with
[1:18:52] fire for strong as the lord who judges
[1:18:54] her
[1:18:56] she had gotten to this place this
[1:18:58] religion this this catholic religion
[1:19:00] this babylonian spirit
[1:19:03] and gone to the place where she
[1:19:06] sat as a queen of heaven and said i will
[1:19:09] see no sorrow
[1:19:11] and in one hour her plagues come and
[1:19:13] she's destroyed
[1:19:16] she's so convinced by the deception of
[1:19:18] the devil
[1:19:19] that she's right and she's so utterly
[1:19:23] wrong
[1:19:24] miserable wretched blind naked and
[1:19:27] knoweth it not
[1:19:29] that's what this veil has done in this
[1:19:31] day
[1:19:34] brother baby says in the message of
[1:19:35] grace he said but now according to the
[1:19:37] prophecy
[1:19:38] there will come the headstone and i want
[1:19:41] you to notice that when the headstone
[1:19:42] comes the prince that's going to cry out
[1:19:44] the message will cry
[1:19:46] grace grace for it's by grace
[1:19:50] are we saved not out of works lest any
[1:19:52] man should boast
[1:19:53] and the message of grace has been
[1:19:54] trampled under the feet of men until
[1:19:56] it's become a disgrace
[1:19:58] some of them runs out into eternal
[1:19:59] security some runs out into oh
[1:20:01] everything
[1:20:02] but the true message of grace remains
[1:20:04] the same and that's where satan tries to
[1:20:06] knock it out from the church
[1:20:07] but it's the grace of god that we're all
[1:20:09] saved by amen
[1:20:12] and the message the token motherboard
[1:20:15] says
[1:20:16] a young fellow said the other day god
[1:20:17] loves me so well god is
[1:20:19] so so is a good god that is true but
[1:20:22] he's a god of anger too he's a god of
[1:20:24] judgment
[1:20:24] he's a god of wrath we fail to get that
[1:20:27] you make him so good till you make him
[1:20:28] some old dodie grandpa
[1:20:30] he's not no doty grandfather he is
[1:20:32] almighty god
[1:20:33] and he don't have no grandchildren he
[1:20:35] has sons and daughters of god
[1:20:37] not shook hands and adopted in you must
[1:20:39] be born again
[1:20:40] and the blood applied it's sons and
[1:20:42] daughters of god not some old soft
[1:20:44] grandfather
[1:20:45] let his kids get by grandchildren get by
[1:20:47] with anything he is not a grandfather
[1:20:49] he's a father yes sir
[1:20:51] every child must be born of him he's a
[1:20:53] father of correction
[1:20:56] so we get over to the sadducees system
[1:20:58] when we make when we have
[1:21:00] this aggressive grace where anybody that
[1:21:02] comes against this grace is the one
[1:21:03] who's evil
[1:21:08] and get to the place where we can begin
[1:21:10] to believe
[1:21:11] because i believe the message because
[1:21:13] i'm in the message everything will be
[1:21:14] fine with me
[1:21:15] if you're an elect predestinated seed of
[1:21:17] god you will be fine
[1:21:22] but in order for god to get you fine you
[1:21:24] may not feel fine for a while
[1:21:27] because he's a father of correction who
[1:21:29] will not let you get away
[1:21:30] with anything amen he owns you you've
[1:21:33] been bought with a price you're not your
[1:21:34] own amen
[1:21:35] and he's going to make sure that his
[1:21:37] word is not violated by his children
[1:21:39] amen he's not a grandfather he's not
[1:21:41] soft and dirty it's not because i say i
[1:21:43] believe the message i go to a message
[1:21:45] church that i can begin to dabble in the
[1:21:47] things that the prophet told us to stay
[1:21:48] away from
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:54] but he's a god of correction
[1:21:59] that'll bring us back to the word
[1:22:06] praise god let's go to matthew and read
[1:22:07] a couple scriptures together
[1:22:10] i want to finish painting this picture
[1:22:12] that we started earlier
[1:22:14] when we get to the chief
[1:22:18] priests and elders we're talking about
[1:22:20] the united body of the pharisees and
[1:22:22] sadducees and herodians and all the jews
[1:22:25] together but this united body was mainly
[1:22:27] made of the sadducees and pharisees
[1:22:31] and in matthew 26 verse 3 it says
[1:22:34] then assembled together the chief
[1:22:36] priests and the scribes and the elders
[1:22:37] of the people and to the palace
[1:22:39] of the high priest who was called
[1:22:40] caiaphas
[1:22:42] and consulted that they might take jesus
[1:22:44] by septility
[1:22:46] and kill him
[1:22:50] this setility is by craft or by guile
[1:22:55] these men were so holy and so
[1:22:58] righteous and so pious that they would
[1:23:00] broaden their phylacteries and when they
[1:23:02] would
[1:23:03] when they would make an offering they
[1:23:04] would blow a trumpet so everybody can
[1:23:06] see them putting offering
[1:23:07] in and when they stood on the corner
[1:23:08] they would make long boastful prayers
[1:23:10] so everybody knew how religious they
[1:23:12] were but in the back room in private
[1:23:14] they were going to try to use craftiness
[1:23:16] and subtility to have a man killed
[1:23:22] it doesn't matter how good you look and
[1:23:24] how what part of what true system you
[1:23:26] are
[1:23:28] you are what you are in private
[1:23:32] you are what you are in the privacy of
[1:23:33] your heart
[1:23:41] matthew 27
[1:23:45] verse 62.
[1:23:49] matthew 27-62 this is after jesus
[1:23:53] crucifixion
[1:23:54] he's been buried and now the next day
[1:23:56] that followed the day of the preparation
[1:23:59] the chief priests and the pharisees came
[1:24:00] together into pilate
[1:24:02] saying sir we we remember that the
[1:24:04] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[1:24:06] after three days
[1:24:07] i will rise again command therefore that
[1:24:10] the sepulcher be made sure unto the
[1:24:12] third day
[1:24:13] lest his disciples come by night and
[1:24:15] steal him away
[1:24:16] and say unto the people he has risen
[1:24:18] from the dead so the last
[1:24:20] error shall be worse than the first
[1:24:23] pilate said unto them you have a watch
[1:24:24] go your way
[1:24:25] make it as sure as you can so they went
[1:24:27] and made the sepulcher sure sealing the
[1:24:30] stone
[1:24:31] and setting a watch
[1:24:34] not only did they conspire to have the
[1:24:36] word killed
[1:24:38] they were wanting to make sure the words
[1:24:40] stayed dead
[1:24:43] and they wanted to ensure that the word
[1:24:46] stayed locked behind the roman seal
[1:24:52] but they confessed that they remember
[1:24:54] while he was alive
[1:24:56] that he said after three days he would
[1:24:59] raise again
[1:25:02] they have ears and understanding
[1:25:08] let's go to chapter 28. and verse 11.
[1:25:16] so after jesus resurrected an angel came
[1:25:18] and rolled the stone away
[1:25:19] the watch that was set fell down as dead
[1:25:21] men now it says now when they were going
[1:25:24] behold some of the watch came into the
[1:25:26] city and showed unto the chief priest
[1:25:28] all the things that were done
[1:25:30] well we're done angel came we felt as
[1:25:32] dead rolled the stone away
[1:25:36] and when they were assembled with the
[1:25:37] elders and had taken counsel they gave
[1:25:39] large money unto the soldiers saying
[1:25:42] say ye his disciples came by night
[1:25:47] say lie
[1:25:50] the most holy people the most holy ones
[1:25:54] in the holy church
[1:25:55] in the most holy place you understand
[1:25:58] friends
[1:25:59] that whenever the word begins to
[1:26:01] challenge the religion
[1:26:02] amen man who is not ready to receive
[1:26:05] christ
[1:26:05] man who doesn't have a capacity to
[1:26:08] receive christ
[1:26:09] he will take his religion and crucify
[1:26:11] christ if he has to lie
[1:26:13] if you have to make up stuff about the
[1:26:15] prophet if he's got to look in his bible
[1:26:17] and know that water baptism in jesus
[1:26:19] name is true he's got to come up with
[1:26:20] some excuse to hold
[1:26:22] the people in the religion
[1:26:28] they become liars
[1:26:31] they they become murderers
[1:26:35] they've become deceivers why did they do
[1:26:39] it all
[1:26:40] so that they could maintain their
[1:26:41] position and their nation
[1:26:43] and man that they could hold their form
[1:26:44] and hold their religion because it's the
[1:26:46] thing that gave
[1:26:47] them comfort
[1:26:50] and you may think that's crazy but i
[1:26:52] know some of you have been in
[1:26:54] churches and systems amen they even
[1:26:56] claim to believe the message that would
[1:26:57] go through the same kind of manipulation
[1:26:59] in life amen to hold the system in place
[1:27:02] because it was the system of the church
[1:27:04] and the ministry
[1:27:05] that gave them comforts
[1:27:13] and people will let it go on because
[1:27:16] they feel comfortable
[1:27:19] because it's bringing a security in the
[1:27:22] church
[1:27:22] under the ministry
[1:27:26] there's nothing new under the sun
[1:27:28] everything that is has been before
[1:27:35] told the soldiers gave large money into
[1:27:37] the soldiers saying say ye
[1:27:39] his disciples come by night and stole
[1:27:41] him away while we slept
[1:27:43] and it has come to the governor's ears
[1:27:45] we will persuade him
[1:27:47] and secure you so they took the money
[1:27:50] and did as they were taught
[1:27:52] and this saying is commonly reported
[1:27:54] among the jews
[1:27:55] unto this day
[1:27:59] what were they defending their security
[1:28:05] they had already confessed we remember
[1:28:08] that while the deceiver was alive he
[1:28:10] said that he would raise after three
[1:28:12] days
[1:28:12] and here comes some of their own wash to
[1:28:14] testify they had seen the angel
[1:28:16] the stone was rolled away and come and
[1:28:18] showed them all things and they said
[1:28:19] listen say this
[1:28:23] tell them his disciples came and if the
[1:28:25] governor has anything they will stick up
[1:28:27] for you
[1:28:30] i tell you religion is dirty
[1:28:33] filthy deceitful the devil is using
[1:28:38] religion
[1:28:38] to harbor unbelievers these pharisees
[1:28:41] were
[1:28:42] unbelievers they didn't even believe the
[1:28:44] law of moses he said if you believe
[1:28:46] moses you would believe me
[1:28:49] and they didn't even believe the ten
[1:28:50] commandments friends they would not even
[1:28:52] stop
[1:28:54] lying
[1:28:56] that's one of the commandments written
[1:28:58] on stone that's on that line
[1:29:02] here they are absolute unbelievers but
[1:29:05] the religion
[1:29:06] under satan amen so promoted them that
[1:29:09] they come to the
[1:29:10] highest position that they could come
[1:29:12] under this religion
[1:29:13] and it was it was a true religion
[1:29:15] friends it was established by god
[1:29:17] but satan had gone in and began to work
[1:29:19] through people
[1:29:20] amen and promotion and manipulation they
[1:29:23] climbed till they got to the highest
[1:29:25] seat
[1:29:25] and they were absolute unbelievers in
[1:29:28] the word of god
[1:29:31] and every action they took with jesus
[1:29:32] christ proved that they were unbelievers
[1:29:34] but you know what happened after jesus
[1:29:36] resurrected amen and he went
[1:29:38] and then and then now the truth begins
[1:29:40] to spill out they cover it up and cover
[1:29:42] it up and cover it up and persecute
[1:29:44] truth and persecute truth
[1:29:45] why because they're protecting the thing
[1:29:47] that gives them security
[1:29:49] and gives them positions
[1:29:52] they'll marry the romans to stay here
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:58] brother venom already told us that all
[1:30:01] these denominations will marry the roman
[1:30:04] system so they can keep their system
[1:30:06] because rome doesn't care how you
[1:30:08] worship as long as you're part of the
[1:30:09] system
[1:30:10] rome didn't care that they were jews he
[1:30:12] didn't care that herod built them a tent
[1:30:13] pep temple
[1:30:15] all they cared is that they participated
[1:30:18] in the system
[1:30:19] if you participate in the system you can
[1:30:20] believe whatever you want
[1:30:22] we'll even send you funds to build your
[1:30:24] temple of worship
[1:30:25] as long as you participate in the system
[1:30:32] and the only threat to the system is
[1:30:33] somebody will speak the truth
[1:30:37] and jesus became such a threat to their
[1:30:40] security
[1:30:41] to their through their attachment to the
[1:30:42] system he so threatened their security
[1:30:45] amen that they would kill a man who did
[1:30:48] nobody
[1:30:49] any physical harm and had never
[1:30:52] committed a crime
[1:30:55] they threw daniel in the lion's den when
[1:30:57] he had never physically harmed anybody
[1:31:00] and never
[1:31:00] threatened a person they took the three
[1:31:03] hebrews
[1:31:04] and then they threw them into a fiery
[1:31:05] furnace amen they had never
[1:31:07] physically harmed anybody they posed no
[1:31:09] danger to anybody
[1:31:10] i mean they were not a threat but they
[1:31:12] would take them and throw them
[1:31:14] into a fiery furnace that was heated
[1:31:15] seven times why
[1:31:17] because they were a threat to
[1:31:18] nebuchadnezzar's unified form of worship
[1:31:24] not because they were a physical threat
[1:31:26] to anybody not because they were a
[1:31:28] threat to the kingdom not because they
[1:31:29] were
[1:31:30] posing any physical threat whatsoever
[1:31:33] the threat they were was to the security
[1:31:35] that was coming from the false union
[1:31:40] that's why ahab threw macaya into the
[1:31:42] inner chamber and to the south
[1:31:44] because macaya by speaking the truth
[1:31:46] amen he become a threat to the false
[1:31:48] union of ahab and jehoshaphat
[1:31:53] and all he did was tell him the truth
[1:31:54] and they asked him to
[1:31:58] they called him they asked him
[1:32:01] and he tried to let him off the hook he
[1:32:03] said go up
[1:32:05] go on up he knew they wouldn't receive
[1:32:09] it he said
[1:32:09] you're just going up and he said haven't
[1:32:11] i told you before just tell me what the
[1:32:13] lord says
[1:32:16] he told him exactly what the lord said
[1:32:20] ahab knew that was the word of the lord
[1:32:23] but because it threatened this new false
[1:32:25] unity
[1:32:26] that became between jehoshaphat and ahab
[1:32:29] he threw him into the inner chamber
[1:32:31] why because the truth was a threat to
[1:32:33] the religious system
[1:32:36] amen you see
[1:32:40] why the devil wants the devil would want
[1:32:43] people who are associated with this
[1:32:45] message to take the message and make it
[1:32:47] a religion
[1:32:47] because if they do they'll be willing to
[1:32:49] protect the religion
[1:32:52] because the religion becomes the
[1:32:54] security
[1:32:56] and they will be willing to compromise
[1:32:58] amen they will be willing
[1:33:00] amen to give in to keep
[1:33:04] what is my security
[1:33:08] but if your security comes from your
[1:33:10] personal relationship with jesus christ
[1:33:12] and your identification by this word it
[1:33:14] doesn't matter what they do to the
[1:33:15] church it doesn't matter if they scatter
[1:33:16] us as believers
[1:33:17] it doesn't matter if they throw me in
[1:33:18] the inner hall they cannot separate me
[1:33:20] from the love of god that is in christ
[1:33:22] jesus
[1:33:23] because it's been revealed to me
[1:33:24] personally
[1:33:26] shut the doors to the church will not
[1:33:27] stop anything
[1:33:30] amen but the devil would like to take
[1:33:32] religion and have us have a false
[1:33:34] security
[1:33:35] so that we have a need to protect our
[1:33:38] false security
[1:33:40] amen if your security in christ
[1:33:44] and nobody believes what you're saying
[1:33:45] it's okay
[1:33:48] nobody believed mikaya he was fine with
[1:33:50] that nobody believed
[1:33:51] jeremiah he was fine with that nobody
[1:33:53] believed isaiah he was fine with that
[1:33:58] because their security did not come from
[1:34:00] the system
[1:34:01] their security came from god himself
[1:34:05] that's why religion is a barrier to god
[1:34:08] amen
[1:34:09] it doesn't bring you to god it's not the
[1:34:10] upholder of truth it's the protector of
[1:34:12] unbelievers
[1:34:14] it's the sheltering amen of the
[1:34:16] unbelievers
[1:34:22] but god is going to have a bride because
[1:34:23] he said he would
[1:34:26] that would not fall by this system of
[1:34:29] religion
[1:34:31] not because she's better wiser smarter
[1:34:34] she's learned more over time
[1:34:35] but because he said he would have it in
[1:34:38] this day
[1:34:39] he will have it in his day and because
[1:34:41] he said he would have it in this day
[1:34:43] he had to ensure that it would be here
[1:34:45] so to ensure that he'd be there
[1:34:46] he had no option but to come himself
[1:34:50] so he didn't just leave it to you he
[1:34:51] said i'll come in you and do the work
[1:34:53] amen
[1:34:54] all you've got to do is receive it amen
[1:34:56] accept it amen open yourself to me
[1:35:01] and he would come himself and do it in
[1:35:03] this day
[1:35:07] and the message broken cisterns
[1:35:10] it says today i was talking with my good
[1:35:12] friend dr lee's zale
[1:35:13] which is present now and he's quite a
[1:35:15] theologian and so we usually have some
[1:35:18] pretty good discussions on scripture
[1:35:20] very smart and he asked me one time what
[1:35:22] i thought about the initial evidence of
[1:35:23] the holy ghost was speaking in tongues
[1:35:25] it's been many years ago i said no i
[1:35:27] can't see that he said neither do i
[1:35:29] said though i've been taught that he
[1:35:31] said what would you think would be the
[1:35:32] evidence i said the most perfect
[1:35:34] evidence i can think of is love
[1:35:36] and so we got to talk on that and then i
[1:35:39] thought that sounded pretty good so i
[1:35:40] just held that if a man has got love
[1:35:43] but one day the lord in a vision
[1:35:45] straightened me out
[1:35:48] and he said the evidence of the spirit
[1:35:50] was those who could receive the word
[1:35:53] neither love nor speaking tongues but
[1:35:55] it's receiving
[1:35:56] the word
[1:36:04] see the religious system in the roman
[1:36:07] system
[1:36:08] which is the babylonian system which is
[1:36:10] nebuchadnezzar system which is nimrod
[1:36:12] system which is cain system
[1:36:14] do we believe that
[1:36:17] is not based on faith
[1:36:21] it is based on participation
[1:36:28] if you participate then you're accepted
[1:36:32] if you come to church and pay your ties
[1:36:34] and you don't cut your hair and you wear
[1:36:35] the right kind of dress you're accepted
[1:36:40] if you're a baptist and you believe the
[1:36:41] baptism you're accepted
[1:36:45] you're accepted by participation not by
[1:36:48] faith
[1:36:48] but in christ he only accepts faith
[1:36:54] but the system is comfortable with
[1:36:56] participation
[1:36:58] because you can be given a sign in the
[1:37:00] forehead or a sign in the hand
[1:37:02] and the forehead is your mental
[1:37:04] agreement with the system
[1:37:07] or sign in your hand is what you do
[1:37:08] about it or giving in to it or
[1:37:10] supporting it
[1:37:12] so you don't even have to believe it if
[1:37:14] you support it they're still okay with
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:26] participation
[1:37:29] brings unity
[1:37:32] unity brings a false sense of security
[1:37:38] i want you to remember that
[1:37:39] participation
[1:37:41] brings unity unity brings a false sense
[1:37:44] of security
[1:37:49] our unity as we've said before
[1:37:52] is not just a lateral unity
[1:37:56] but we're unified in christ
[1:38:00] so if i am united with christ and you're
[1:38:03] united with christ
[1:38:05] then we're automatically united
[1:38:08] but we can't unify down here
[1:38:11] to be unified to christ that's a false
[1:38:15] union
[1:38:17] so if we can all unify here to feel like
[1:38:20] we're unified to christ
[1:38:22] there can be deception that enter in and
[1:38:23] bring a false union and a false security
[1:38:27] but if we individually unify with christ
[1:38:31] then we are automatically unified with
[1:38:32] one another
[1:38:35] and then when christ goes up if there's
[1:38:37] a string attached to you
[1:38:39] and you and you and you and you and all
[1:38:40] to christ in the middle of all of us
[1:38:42] and when christ lives off the earth
[1:38:43] guess what happens to all of us whammo
[1:38:45] we go together
[1:38:48] not because we unified ourselves
[1:38:50] together because we unified with christ
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:55] and that brings a stronger unity than
[1:38:57] any earthly units
[1:39:00] brother bram says in the pergament
[1:39:02] church age he said the evidence of the
[1:39:04] spirit-filled christian believer is not
[1:39:05] to produce the truth
[1:39:08] you catch that that's a statement
[1:39:12] the evidence of the spirit-filled
[1:39:13] christian believer is not to produce the
[1:39:15] truth
[1:39:16] and in parentheses he put the word but
[1:39:18] to receive the truth
[1:39:19] the word and to believe and obey it
[1:39:26] so brother man when he says the greatest
[1:39:29] the the lord straighten him out that
[1:39:30] vision the greatest evidence
[1:39:32] is receiving the word god
[1:39:35] knows what is lip service
[1:39:40] and what is real because you can say you
[1:39:43] receive the word but that doesn't mean
[1:39:44] you receive the word
[1:39:46] that means you that could mean you want
[1:39:48] to be identified in the right group
[1:39:52] but it doesn't automatically mean you
[1:39:54] receive the worry
[1:39:56] but it's to receive the truth the word
[1:39:58] and to believe it and obey it
[1:40:01] in the smyrna church age he says now we
[1:40:03] have been constantly saying that the
[1:40:04] true evidence of being baptized with the
[1:40:06] holy ghost
[1:40:07] is for the believer to receive the word
[1:40:09] for the age in which he lives
[1:40:13] in the token he says don't just come
[1:40:14] this far say i believe the message
[1:40:16] you obey the messenger come into christ
[1:40:22] you say well i believe every word said
[1:40:23] brother that's good but that's just
[1:40:25] being able to read
[1:40:27] take the message take it into your heart
[1:40:30] that you must have the token the very
[1:40:32] life that was in christ be in you
[1:40:34] when i see that i will pass over you
[1:40:38] see it's not a mental acknowledgement
[1:40:40] amen it's not an agreement amen
[1:40:43] it has to be an actual receiving the
[1:40:45] word for your day
[1:40:46] what does it mean to receive the word
[1:40:48] for your day it means to receive
[1:40:50] christ in his fullness because he is the
[1:40:52] word for your day
[1:40:55] and to become one with him
[1:41:01] but if the token was not there the
[1:41:02] covenant was not in effect
[1:41:04] it was a gnome same now no matter how
[1:41:08] much you say how much you'd say i
[1:41:09] believe every word in the bible
[1:41:11] say brother branham i can quote you half
[1:41:12] the bible all the bible by heart
[1:41:14] i believe every bit of it that's good
[1:41:16] satan does too it takes the token
[1:41:19] amen again in the token he says
[1:41:23] they're not come together we've not come
[1:41:25] together to talk about the message
[1:41:28] we are come together to get in the
[1:41:30] message and the message
[1:41:32] is christ he is the word
[1:41:36] so you cannot join the message
[1:41:41] you cannot become part of the message by
[1:41:43] going to a message church
[1:41:47] although i believe if you're in the

[1:42:18] responsible

[1:42:25] displayed we cannot feel safe
[1:42:28] until this token is displayed that's
[1:42:30] right

[1:43:08] revealed it to you notice what he said
[1:43:10] to him upon this rock
[1:43:12] that's peter the predestinated seed of
[1:43:14] god that had received this light
[1:43:16] and given the keys to the kingdom upon
[1:43:18] this rock
[1:43:19] of revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:43:22] he is the full manifested god
[1:43:25] upon this rock not a father son and holy
[1:43:27] ghost and him being the second person
[1:43:30] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[1:43:32] the gates of hell will never shake it
[1:43:34] down
[1:43:34] never prevail against him i'll build my
[1:43:36] church upon this rock a revelation
[1:43:39] of jesus christ i want to ask you what
[1:43:43] is the book of revelation
[1:43:45] the revelation of jesus christ that's
[1:43:48] why there had to be a prophet in the end
[1:43:49] time that would open that book
[1:43:51] amen because the church is built on the
[1:43:53] revelation of jesus christ and in the
[1:43:55] end time
[1:43:56] he would open the revelation of jesus
[1:43:58] christ
[1:43:59] which is the mystery of god revealed
[1:44:03] look christ in you makes him the center
[1:44:06] of life of the revelation
[1:44:09] christ's life in you makes him the
[1:44:10] center of the revelation
[1:44:12] christ in the bible makes the bible the
[1:44:14] complete revelation of christ
[1:44:16] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:44:18] revelation of the whole thing
[1:44:20] see what god is trying to do
[1:44:24] god is trying to get that full measure
[1:44:27] of jesus christ
[1:44:28] united into a church on the earth amen
[1:44:31] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:44:33] christ knew united as one that's what
[1:44:36] this message came to do
[1:44:37] the forerunner was here the forerunner's
[1:44:39] coming he came to do what
[1:44:41] he came to unite with the bride
[1:44:44] so that the bride could what she could
[1:44:47] manifest christ again
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:53] some people are taking the message
[1:44:56] and looking for a new order to build a
[1:44:59] church system by
[1:45:01] so that will now be correct because we
[1:45:03] found out the
[1:45:04] bad this wasn't correct and but now we
[1:45:06] have an order that's correct
[1:45:10] some people will take the message and
[1:45:11] look for the
[1:45:15] sure loopholes to fight the legalists
[1:45:20] but they're going to be a group of
[1:45:22] people that's going to take the message
[1:45:24] and look for christ i'm not interested
[1:45:27] in a church order
[1:45:29] i don't have the message for a new
[1:45:30] church order the message didn't come for
[1:45:32] a new church order
[1:45:33] although he preached church order he set
[1:45:35] the church in order but the message
[1:45:36] didn't come to bring us a new church
[1:45:38] order so that we could be happy with the
[1:45:39] new church order
[1:45:40] he came to restore the word so that we
[1:45:42] can meet our bridegroom amen
[1:45:44] we can meet our bridegroom jesus christ
[1:45:47] the word
[1:45:48] the revealed word
[1:45:52] some people want the new church order
[1:45:54] that's now now we're correct
[1:45:59] some want to feel correct by joining to
[1:46:01] a system
[1:46:03] but there's a bride who's not looking
[1:46:04] for a security in an order
[1:46:06] or a security in a system she's looking
[1:46:08] for him
[1:46:10] amen this is him this message is him he
[1:46:13] came down
[1:46:14] he came and opened the seals he came and
[1:46:16] gave the revelation
[1:46:17] the lamb has to take the book the lamb
[1:46:19] has to open the seals
[1:46:20] this message came to reveal him to her
[1:46:23] and she's looking for him and the
[1:46:25] message
[1:46:25] not an order not a loophole not a system
[1:46:28] not a false security
[1:46:29] she's looking for him and every time she
[1:46:33] goes back to the message
[1:46:34] and goes to the bible she's not looking
[1:46:36] for another rule to tackle the rules to
[1:46:38] feel more secure
[1:46:41] she's not looking for another miracle
[1:46:43] that proves that brother ben was a
[1:46:44] prophet so that i know i'm not aligned
[1:46:45] to the right thing
[1:46:49] she's looking for him in every line
[1:46:54] if you go to the bible read every line
[1:46:55] don't see christ go back and read it
[1:46:57] again
[1:46:57] amen how am i going to see it amen
[1:46:59] that's what the opening of the word came
[1:47:01] to do to show you christ
[1:47:02] he's the whole word he's the whole bible
[1:47:06] now she's not looking for a system she's
[1:47:08] not looking for a security she's looking
[1:47:10] for him
[1:47:13] he came and unveiled himself
[1:47:18] to a bride who wanted to see him
[1:47:26] some go one way some go the other
[1:47:29] but the bride just wants to see him
[1:47:37] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:47:40] revelation
[1:47:42] of the whole thing what's he saying
[1:47:45] what's the whole thing
[1:47:47] he foreshadowed it in eden
[1:47:50] way back in genesis when he took his son
[1:47:53] and he put him in dominion over the
[1:47:55] earth and out of his son he pulled
[1:47:56] a wife a bride and united two together
[1:47:59] and said be one flesh
[1:48:03] and that was his masterpiece family and
[1:48:06] he put him in dominion over his creation
[1:48:08] amen and then the devil slipped in and
[1:48:11] he brought that masterpiece to ruin
[1:48:13] but he's been through the entire bible
[1:48:16] building back this masterpiece
[1:48:21] and when he got through the old
[1:48:22] testament he had reestablished
[1:48:25] the last atom amen but on calvary you
[1:48:29] opened up a side so he could take out
[1:48:30] the ingredients for a bride
[1:48:32] and now and through the new testament
[1:48:34] he's been building back that bride
[1:48:35] but in the end time amen he's going to
[1:48:38] unite the two back together
[1:48:40] and christ in the bride christ in you
[1:48:43] makes you the revelation of the whole
[1:48:45] thing because it's come
[1:48:47] back to a union to one flesh again
[1:48:51] you are flesh in my flesh the bone of my
[1:48:53] bone and life of my life
[1:48:56] where is christ he's in her
[1:49:01] christ in you amen
[1:49:06] is the complete revelation of the whole
[1:49:10] thing
[1:49:13] see what god is trying to do amen
[1:49:16] he's trying to get people to stop at a
[1:49:20] forerunner ministry

[1:49:24] we've got church order we've got our
[1:49:26] churches we've got our preachers we've
[1:49:28] got everything
[1:49:29] and we're sitting here under the
[1:49:30] forerunner ministry waiting for
[1:49:32] something to happen
[1:49:39] but christ in you is the revelation of
[1:49:42] the whole thing
[1:49:44] what the prophet came for what did he
[1:49:46] come for he come to announce his coming
[1:49:50] what coming he come in bride form
[1:49:53] and the formation of the bride he's here

[1:49:56] and through his bride to complete his
[1:49:58] works
[1:50:02] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:50:03] revelation of the whole thing
[1:50:05] see what god is trying to do if you
[1:50:07] catch that revelation friend you don't
[1:50:09] need a church system amen
[1:50:11] you don't need a set of rules you don't
[1:50:13] need a program you don't need anything
[1:50:15] to find security
[1:50:16] when you realize it's christ in you the
[1:50:18] individual not a group of people
[1:50:20] but christ in me the hope of glory
[1:50:22] christ in me his plan from the beginning
[1:50:25] christ in me in the end time what he
[1:50:27] foresaw before the foundation of the
[1:50:28] world
[1:50:29] this is why the prophet came this is why
[1:50:31] we have a message so that he could come
[1:50:33] alive
[1:50:34] inside a people on the earth christ in
[1:50:36] me as an individual
[1:50:38] i don't need a system an order a
[1:50:40] structure all i need is him
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] that's why he came and that's what keeps
[1:50:47] us free from religion
[1:50:55] see what god is trying to do oh i pray
[1:50:58] that he helps us see it
[1:51:00] i hope that we see it clearer and
[1:51:01] clearer every day
[1:51:04] what is the new birth then you'd say
[1:51:06] well brother branham
[1:51:07] what is a new birth it's the revelation
[1:51:10] of jesus christ
[1:51:11] personally to you
[1:51:14] amen now you joined a church you shook a
[1:51:17] hand
[1:51:17] you done something different you said a
[1:51:19] creed you promised to live by a code of
[1:51:20] rules
[1:51:21] but christ the bible he is the word that
[1:51:24] was revealed to you
[1:51:25] no matter what anybody says what takes
[1:51:27] place it's christ
[1:51:28] pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[1:51:30] christ in you
[1:51:32] that is the revelation that the church
[1:51:33] was built upon
[1:51:37] you say well i'm a lutheran i'm a
[1:51:38] baptist i'm a presbyterian that don't
[1:51:40] mean one thing
[1:51:42] don't mean that to god not a thing not a
[1:51:44] snap of your finger
[1:51:46] what is it it's christ being revealed
[1:51:48] and he is the word
[1:51:49] and when the word is revealed it
[1:51:51] expresses itself
[1:51:54] what god purposed for christ jesus
[1:51:56] christ was to express himself
[1:51:57] to take his own laws and live by his
[1:51:59] laws and fulfill his laws by death
[1:52:02] and christ god died in flesh in order to
[1:52:04] condemn sin in the flesh
[1:52:05] that he might bring to himself a
[1:52:07] glorious bride redeeming back
[1:52:09] that redeemed back that will believe
[1:52:13] only the word of god and not swap it
[1:52:14] like eve did for intellectual conception
[1:52:16] of man
[1:52:17] you see it that's christ's idea that's
[1:52:19] god's idea
[1:52:20] the new birth reveals this
[1:52:24] but the revelation this is christ again
[1:52:27] in christ
[1:52:27] mr god revealed but the revelation come
[1:52:29] through the blood see
[1:52:31] through jesus christ who is the blood of
[1:52:33] god creative blood in the womb of mary
[1:52:36] and paul knew him by revelation that's
[1:52:38] how we know him today
[1:52:40] the only way you could know him not say
[1:52:42] i'm a methodist that means nothing
[1:52:44] i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm a
[1:52:46] catholic that means nothing
[1:52:48] but by the revelation that god has
[1:52:50] revealed the word to you
[1:52:53] it doesn't matter if he's revealed it to
[1:52:55] your parents
[1:52:56] i mean it does matter you want him to
[1:52:59] reveal it to your parents
[1:53:01] but that's not good enough for you
[1:53:05] it's not even sufficient that he's
[1:53:07] revealed to everyone else in the church
[1:53:11] pastor and elders and everybody else but
[1:53:14] he's wanting to reveal it to you
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:22] and by the revelation that god has
[1:53:24] revealed the word to you he is the word
[1:53:26] and the word how you know it's revealed
[1:53:30] it lives itself and expresses itself
[1:53:33] through you amen
[1:53:36] oh that kills it all that kills the
[1:53:39] pharisees spirit
[1:53:40] that kills the sadducees spirit how do
[1:53:43] you know it's revealed
[1:53:45] how do you know it's revealed it lives
[1:53:48] itself and expresses himself through you
[1:53:53] not what you've done what he did through
[1:53:55] you what he's doing through you
[1:53:57] amen not by keeping an order keeping a
[1:53:59] law but he himself doing it not you
[1:54:01] doing it
[1:54:02] him doing it not just living your way
[1:54:06] but he doesn't live in your way
[1:54:08] he lives according to the word amen
[1:54:11] if christ is revealed if that word is
[1:54:13] revealed
[1:54:15] it's a union a marriage between you and
[1:54:18] christ
[1:54:20] and he himself comes in in his
[1:54:23] lives his self his life his self
[1:54:27] through you amen
[1:54:31] praise god not i'm going to keep the
[1:54:33] church order to be okay
[1:54:35] i'm gonna search the message to find
[1:54:36] more rules so that i know i'm all right
[1:54:38] i'm gonna join myself to the right
[1:54:40] ministry so i'm okay
[1:54:43] no i'm only okay when he himself
[1:54:46] lives the word
[1:54:49] my motivation is not fear my motivation
[1:54:53] is not to be part of the group
[1:54:55] my motivation is not to fit in i'm not
[1:54:58] doing works to please anybody else
[1:55:00] in fact i'm not even doing works
[1:55:05] i'm just yielding to him
[1:55:08] and his spirit is taking me over and i'm
[1:55:10] a love sleep to jesus christ
[1:55:12] and now he has entered in and now as i
[1:55:14] feed on the word he's bringing the word
[1:55:16] to life inside of me
[1:55:19] amen now what i couldn't overcome now
[1:55:21] i'm overcoming
[1:55:22] when i couldn't stop now it stopped
[1:55:25] how's that happen
[1:55:26] because of a personal revelation of
[1:55:27] jesus christ to you
[1:55:32] don't need religion we don't need
[1:55:34] another order
[1:55:36] we don't need to join the right group
[1:55:39] i don't recommend you join the wrong
[1:55:40] group
[1:55:42] but i recommend that you open yourself
[1:55:46] to this word that is christ
[1:55:49] this message these message books
[1:55:53] are not a new system
[1:55:57] not a new form of belief not another
[1:55:59] religion
[1:56:02] in fact god didn't send a prophet so
[1:56:04] that we could have message books
[1:56:09] god sent a prophet so that he'd have a
[1:56:10] bride on the earth
[1:56:12] that he could live inside us the message
[1:56:16] came so there could be christ revealed
[1:56:19] in you
[1:56:20] which is the revelation of the whole
[1:56:22] thing
[1:56:24] it's the revelation of the whole message
[1:56:27] christ in his bride
[1:56:29] amen he's looking for a people
[1:56:32] who have something on the inside that
[1:56:34] says that's what i want
[1:56:36] that's what i've always wanted i may
[1:56:39] have got
[1:56:40] caught up in trying to keep rules i may
[1:56:41] got caught up in a system i may got
[1:56:43] caught up in a ministry
[1:56:44] but what i've always wanted is just to
[1:56:47] have you
[1:56:48] and what i've always wanted is just to
[1:56:50] have you and me
[1:56:52] and that i could die and that you could
[1:56:54] live and that's all i've ever wanted
[1:56:55] i've always loved you lord and that's
[1:56:57] all i've ever wanted
[1:56:58] how many can say that's all you've ever
[1:57:00] wanted amen that's what he wants to hear
[1:57:02] he's all he's ever wanted was for you to
[1:57:05] say i want you
[1:57:06] and you only
[1:57:14] he's going to have it he's in the
[1:57:17] process of having it
[1:57:19] because he promised amen that he would
[1:57:23] amen and if you're blessed by the grace
[1:57:26] of god
[1:57:27] to be part of that then you can't
[1:57:30] surrender enough you can't humble
[1:57:33] yourself enough
[1:57:34] you can't express your love enough just
[1:57:38] gratitude for the grace that has come
[1:57:40] into our lives
[1:57:43] what he's done and what he showed
[1:57:46] some people want to have a message
[1:57:51] as intellectual property
[1:57:55] but some people just want christ
[1:58:00] some people want to read and digest the
[1:58:03] message
[1:58:04] to understand the proper way to live
[1:58:07] to feel secure and be right
[1:58:11] but some people just want to read the
[1:58:13] message to fall in love with him
[1:58:16] to see him to open ourselves to him
[1:58:22] the message came oh
[1:58:26] just hear my heart god didn't send a
[1:58:29] prophet in this day and a message so
[1:58:30] that he could have a bunch of message
[1:58:32] churches
[1:58:37] god sent a message so he could have a
[1:58:38] bride
[1:58:41] there's nothing wrong with the churches
[1:58:43] with nothing wrong with us gathering
[1:58:44] like this there's no error there
[1:58:46] but let's not stop there
[1:58:50] he didn't come for for a new system a
[1:58:54] new form
[1:58:56] he came so that he could call his bride
[1:59:00] and so that he could unite with his
[1:59:01] bride
[1:59:03] so that the masterpiece could be
[1:59:06] restored
[1:59:09] let's all stand musicians if you could
[1:59:12] come
[1:59:12] by the blake if you could come
[1:59:18] praise god
[1:59:22] do you love him you love him because he
[1:59:26] first loved you
[1:59:29] and whenever i hear that it makes me
[1:59:30] love him more
[1:59:32] because it's not what i've done it's not
[1:59:34] what i could ever do it's what he's done
[1:59:35] for
[1:59:36] me you know why he sent this message in
[1:59:40] this last day
[1:59:42] so he could have me
[1:59:46] can you say the same thing
[1:59:49] that's what it's got to come to friends
[1:59:51] that's the revelation that he wants us
[1:59:52] to come to
[1:59:54] why did brother branham come why did he
[1:59:56] suffer with what he suffered why did he
[1:59:57] struggle
[1:59:58] why why did he have to come and preach
[2:00:01] why did he have to store up the food
[2:00:03] and make the tapes and why did he have
[2:00:05] to go through why all of that
[2:00:08] because he wanted me
[2:00:12] i'm part of the plan because he wanted
[2:00:14] to unite with me in this day
[2:00:17] and he wanted to come into a union
[2:00:21] and he wanted to be christ in me
