[0:00] this is my message to the church now as
[0:02] we go off the air just in a minute are
[0:04] you standing if you're standing on god's
[0:06] word and with god's word every amen
[0:10] that every
[0:13] every jot every tittle that means the
[0:16] full word
[0:19] where are you standing i'm trying to
[0:21] tell you pull away from them shucks and
[0:23] get out here in the weed where you can
[0:25] get right before the sun i hear the
[0:27] coming of the combine you're standing
[0:29] complete justified like you never did it
[0:31] in the first place hallelujah talk about
[0:33] a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more
[0:36] thankful for that than anything i know
[0:38] you are the pure
[0:40] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[0:42] living god every man and woman that's
[0:45] born of the spirit of god and washed in
[0:47] the blood of jesus christ and believes
[0:48] every word of god stands as though you
[0:51] never sinned at the first place you are
[0:54] perfect
[0:55] he drops down a couple paragraphs and he
[0:57] says you're standing completely
[0:59] you never sinned at the first place
[1:02] god don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:05] forgetfulness you never did it
[1:09] praise god that's how effective this
[1:11] washing is in this end time amen that's
[1:14] what's been given to the bride at the
[1:16] end time that can wash such a
[1:17] purification that a prophet of god can
[1:19] look at you and say this bride if you're
[1:21] standing with the word and you're
[1:23] standing on the word every jot every
[1:25] tittle what's he saying there's no more
[1:27] unbelief amen you're not i'm an
[1:30] unbeliever of the word but the full word
[1:32] has come and you're standing with the
[1:33] full word
[1:36] you believe it you've received it you've
[1:37] submitted to it he says you're perfect
[1:40] amen and he's not talking about you know
[1:42] the little mistakes that you make and
[1:44] he's not talking about you've come to
[1:46] sinless perfection and you'll never make
[1:48] another blunder brother venom is not
[1:49] talking about that because he says
[1:51] otherwise
[1:52] later but what he's talking about is the
[1:55] condition of your soul your condition
[1:57] before god because you've come to the i
[2:00] am you've come to the atonement amen
[2:02] himself and when you come to that
[2:04] atonement the full word that is coming
[2:06] this day through a prophetic ministry
[2:08] you said that's nothing but the truth i
[2:10] believe it i give my whole life to it
[2:12] and that word washed you from all the
[2:15] sins of unbelief in your life and in
[2:17] your heart and he says you're sinless
[2:19] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[2:22] you never did it in the first place
[2:23] because this original word comes to
[2:25] awaken an original seed inside of you
[2:28] and under the washing of the original
[2:30] word it takes that seed to its original
[2:32] condition and brings it to life and that
[2:34] seed never did it in the first place
[2:37] that seed was part of god part of god's
[2:40] thinking it never was in sin to begin
[2:42] with and the washing of the water of the
[2:44] pure word washes everything away from
[2:46] that seed and springs it to life in an
[2:48] original form which is pure
