[0:00] so many times amen us men we make
[0:03] mistakes and I made mistakes early in my
[0:05] marriage and truth be known I still make
[0:07] mistakes
[0:09] because I I think my wife should think
[0:12] like me
[0:16] and I don't understand why she doesn't
[0:17] think like me
[0:19] and when she's not thinking like me I'm
[0:21] thinking what is wrong with you
[0:25] you're not thinking like me
[0:27] and she's over here thinking what is
[0:29] wrong with you
[0:31] like for me the picture's so clear
[0:34] for me over here the picture's so clear
[0:37] because we have two different
[0:39] perspectives based off the nature that's
[0:41] been placed within us
[0:45] and and because man is given to rule
[0:48] over the woman
[0:49] he's given the rule over here but
[0:51] according to knowledge
[0:54] giving honor unto her as unto the weaker
[0:57] vessel
[0:58] how do we honor a weak Professor well if
[1:00] you have a vase that's worth a lot of
[1:01] money you honor it by putting it on a
[1:03] pedestal you keep it safe you put it in
[1:04] a case you put it up High where the kids
[1:06] can't break it that's giving honor to
[1:08] one as a weaker vessel
[1:09] and this is how we're supposed to care
[1:12] for our wives giving honor to them as a
[1:14] weaker vessel means we protect them we
[1:16] guard them we shelter them we protect
[1:17] them amen we're not too harsh with them
[1:19] I mean we're not too rugged amen I I can
[1:22] talk to another man
[1:25] rough
[1:27] uh I've done it with my friends before
[1:29] I've had a conversation and it's just
[1:31] been straightforward I mean not me
[1:33] nobody was mad we're straightforward I'd
[1:36] say no I disagree with you if you see
[1:37] two men working amen and you guy calls
[1:40] all those buddies ever they're going to
[1:41] build a shed and all of a sudden they're
[1:42] standing around well I think you should
[1:43] do it this way I said no I'm not going
[1:44] to do it that way I want to do it this
[1:45] way but what about this I think you're
[1:47] going to have a problem later you say
[1:48] leave me alone I know what I'm doing
[1:51] and all those guys can work on that
[1:53] project and they're fine at the end of
[1:54] it amen they go eat some pizza they pat
[1:56] each other in the back they had a great
[1:58] day
[2:01] you throw one woman into the mix and
[2:03] she's in tears in the house wondering
[2:06] why everybody's so mean
[2:07] and why do you talk to each other like
[2:09] that
[2:14] the problem is she's of a nature that
[2:16] God wants her to have
[2:18] and the man's of a nature God wants him
[2:20] to have
[2:21] neither one are wrong
[2:24] but when I begin to if I don't dwell
[2:26] with my wife according to knowledge and
[2:28] I expect her to act like me view
[2:30] everything like me respond to everything
[2:32] like me
[2:34] then what I'm doing is because I have
[2:36] the headship and I'm giving headship
[2:38] that way I'm pushing her down and
[2:40] pushing her down and pushing her down
[2:42] and all of that feminine nature that God
[2:44] wants to be expressed is being hindered
[2:47] inhibited Limited
[2:50] right
[2:51] I don't think that's what God wants
[2:53] I don't think that's what he wants in
[2:55] his marriage I don't want to think
[2:56] that's what he wants out of his bride I
[2:57] don't think God Amen I don't think God
[3:00] wants a Ministry so harsh and so hard
[3:02] and so legalistic that the bride has no
[3:04] expression she's hindered she's hampered
[3:06] she has nothing to say she hasn't
[3:09] she's never right she doesn't know what
[3:10] she's talking about
[3:13] I don't think that's what God wants
[3:15] I think God wants both expressed male
[3:17] and female I think he created it so I
[3:19] think he's expressing male and female I
[3:21] think he wants an expression of male and
[3:23] female
