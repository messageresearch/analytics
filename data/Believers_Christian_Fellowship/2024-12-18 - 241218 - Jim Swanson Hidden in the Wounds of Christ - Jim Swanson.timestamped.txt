[14:07] the service and I was asked to sing but
[14:12] my heart's not in singing right now it's
[14:14] in trying to deliver what God has laid
[14:17] on my heart
[14:18] so you
[14:21] understand thank you let us turn in our
[14:24] scripture
[14:25] to Song of Solomon again
[14:36] it's been
[14:37] a I guess it's been just one week or two
[14:42] weeks been two
[14:45] weeks everything's brand new
[14:49] tonight I know
[14:54] uh song of Solon the 2 chapter
[15:02] same scripture I rode read and wrote
[15:06] down some
[15:07] thoughts about the Clift of the rock
[15:10] verse
[15:10] 14 chapter
[15:13] 2 oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of
[15:17] The Rock in the secret places of the
[15:21] stairs let me see thy countenance let me
[15:25] hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice
[15:29] and their countenance is comely now I
[15:31] want you to turn if you would
[15:34] to Exodus the 33rd
[15:38] chapter Exodus
[15:55] 33 verse 17
[16:00] and the Lord said unto Moses I will do
[16:02] this thing also that thou has spoken for
[16:05] thou has found Grace in my sight and I
[16:09] Know Thee by name isn't that
[16:12] wonderful amen he knows Us by name yes
[16:16] and he said I beseech thee show me thy
[16:20] glory and he said I will make all my
[16:25] goodness pass before thee and I will Pro
[16:30] proclaim the name of the Lord before you
[16:32] thee and will be gracious to whom I will
[16:35] be gracious and will show Mercy on whom
[16:39] I will show Mercy amen and he said verse
[16:42] 20 thou c not see my
[16:45] face for there shall no man see my face
[16:49] and live amen and the Lord said
[16:53] behold there is a place by
[16:56] me and thou shalt stand
[16:59] upon a
[17:00] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[17:03] Glory passeth by that I will put thee in
[17:08] a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee
[17:12] with my
[17:13] hand while I pass by and I will take
[17:17] away mine hand and thou shalt see my
[17:20] back Parts but my face shall not be
[17:24] seen let us
[17:27] pray father this
[17:30] evening never ever do justice to the
[17:34] precious word that we have laying before
[17:37] us but with these lips of clay may you
[17:40] come and anoint what's already been
[17:42] written May the spirit of
[17:46] Revelation come and impart the words the
[17:50] true meaning of the words to Every Soul
[17:52] we pray that's hungering for more of you
[17:56] may you bless your word to our hearts
[17:59] may we go from this place knowing that
[18:02] the god of Heaven has come not just in a
[18:06] natural temporal way that we think when
[18:08] we come to church I guess the Lord was
[18:11] there but Lord rather a deep seated
[18:14] knowing in our souls that whatever we
[18:16] have need of it was meant by you we need
[18:20] your help Lord tonight we ask your
[18:22] blessing now in jesus' name amen God
[18:27] bless you you may take your
[18:29] seats I've got a lot of scriptures
[18:31] tonight and I want to get to them as
[18:34] quickly as I can I'd like you to turn to
[18:36] Isaiah
[18:38] 53 Isaiah
[18:54] 53 thank the Lord and we're going to
[18:57] start reading
[19:00] at verse
[19:04] three we all know who this is referring
[19:06] to don't
[19:07] we amen he is despised and rejected of
[19:12] men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[19:15] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[19:17] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[19:21] him
[19:22] not surely he hath borne our griefs and
[19:27] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[19:31] him
[19:32] stricken smitten of God and
[19:36] Afflicted what a deep weighty scripture
[19:38] that is smitten of God and
[19:41] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[19:46] transgressions he was
[19:48] bruised for our
[19:51] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[19:54] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[19:58] are
[20:00] healed thank the Lord for that
[20:03] scripture we can go on I'd like to pick
[20:05] up verse n he made his grave with the
[20:09] wicked and with the rich in his death
[20:12] that's referring to Joseph of armea that
[20:15] used his own tomb that he Bible says
[20:19] hewed out
[20:20] himself and place the savior in that
[20:26] tomb I didn't realize until I studied
[20:29] that when a person is crucified back in
[20:33] those days they were only 2 or three
[20:35] feet off of the
[20:37] ground and most generally they least
[20:40] leave them until they die for several
[20:42] days until the animals and the birds
[20:45] pick their flesh clean their
[20:48] bones I didn't realize that I thought
[20:51] they were all put into a tomb but they
[20:53] weren't what a horrible way of dying
[20:56] what a horrible thing and I was thinking
[20:59] of that that event there and how much
[21:03] our
[21:07] savior suffered for my
[21:12] sins sir the prophet told us that we
[21:14] were in him before the foundation of the
[21:17] world so everything that God was he
[21:20] poured into Christ and we were in him
[21:22] also so we were actually crucified on
[21:26] that cross with him we don't remember we
[21:29] don't expect to ever feel that but there
[21:33] is by faith a moment in our spiritual
[21:36] journey that we need to identify with
[21:38] that probably more than you ever have in
[21:41] your life and tonight I hope we can
[21:43] touch an area that you'll say that was
[21:46] me I was
[21:47] there I'd like
[21:50] to maybe I don't know if it's up on the
[21:53] screen doesn't have to be but I'd like
[21:54] to change a little bit on the title this
[21:57] evening not just the Cliff of the rock
[22:00] but hidden in the wounds of Christ and
[22:04] because the
[22:06] wounds had occurred by the father
[22:09] allowing it to happen which we'll read
[22:12] in one of the messages
[22:14] here it was a very traumatic thing
[22:18] for any believer that saw that God
[22:21] allowed his son to be put through such a
[22:25] horrible
[22:26] death but and we we read in Isaiah it
[22:30] said but it pleased verse 10 the Lord to
[22:34] bruise him and he hath put him to grief
[22:38] when thou shalt make his soul an
[22:41] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[22:45] he shall prolong his days and the
[22:48] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[22:51] his hand that doesn't look like
[22:54] something that you would be pleased
[22:55] about but it pleased the Lord do you
[22:59] know why cuz you were in his thinking I
[23:02] was in his thinking and he couldn't
[23:04] release you from that until our savior
[23:07] suffered and died on that cross whether
[23:09] we understand it or not perhaps tonight
[23:12] we'll look at it a little bit different
[23:14] but
[23:16] hidden hidden in the wounds of
[23:19] Christ I like if you would to turn
[23:23] to First Corinthians 10
[23:31] 1 Corinthians
[23:37] 10 I'm going to take my time tonight
[23:41] even though it's a Wednesday night you
[23:42] forgive me I I hope to let you out I
[23:45] won't promise anything but I'll do my
[23:48] best there was too much on the plate
[23:51] last time so I'm not going to let that
[23:54] happen again God you understand don't
[23:57] youen
[23:59] 1 Corinthians
[24:06] 10 and verse one starting with moreover
[24:10] Brethren I would not that you should be
[24:12] ignorant how that all our fathers were
[24:15] under the
[24:16] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[24:19] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[24:21] cloud and in the sea and all and did all
[24:25] eat the same spiritual meat
[24:28] eat and did all drink the same spiritual
[24:33] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[24:36] rock that followed them and that rock
[24:40] was Christ amen and the verse five but
[24:45] with many of them God was not well
[24:47] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[24:52] wilderness I'm going to turn over to
[24:55] Exodus if we could we're going to go
[24:57] back and forth here but
[25:03] Exodus and it'll be chapter
[25:09] 17 and we'll begin
[25:13] reading for the sake of time I'd like to
[25:15] read the
[25:16] whole several verses
[25:19] but we'll just pick it up at verse
[25:24] 4 Exodus 17:4 and Moses cried un to the
[25:28] Lord saying what shall I do unto these
[25:32] people they be almost
[25:35] ready to Stone
[25:40] me and the Lord said unto Moses go on
[25:44] before the people and take with thee of
[25:47] the Elders of Israel and thy rod
[25:50] wherewith thou smot the river take in
[25:54] thine hand and go behold I will stand
[25:56] before thee thereupon The Rock in horb
[26:00] and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there
[26:02] shall come water out of it that the
[26:05] people may
[26:06] drink and Moses did so in the sight of
[26:09] the Elders of
[26:13] Israel now let's go to
[26:16] Hebrews the 6th
[26:22] chapter
[26:24] Hebrews 6
[26:32] we'll pick up the thought
[26:36] here in verse
[26:41] four Hebrews 6 verse4 for it is
[26:45] impossible for those who were once
[26:47] enlightened and have tasted of the
[26:49] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[26:53] the Holy
[26:54] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[26:57] God and the powers of the world to come
[27:00] if they shall fall away to renew them
[27:04] again unto
[27:07] repentance seeing they crucify to
[27:11] themselves the Son of God
[27:13] aresh and put him to an open
[27:20] shame may God add his Blessing to the
[27:22] reading of the word
[27:31] there's a scripture in the Old Testament
[27:34] that talks about
[27:36] the ym in the thumb how many are aware
[27:39] that that was the some say it was the
[27:42] breastplate the ephod on the priest and
[27:45] and had little linen Pockets where the
[27:47] 12 Stones
[27:49] of of different
[27:52] varieties were placed because when there
[27:56] was a prophecy or a Propet or somebody
[27:59] with a saying it was brought before that
[28:03] ephod or yman Thum and if it was true
[28:06] and God honored it the lights would
[28:08] flash how many remember that brother
[28:10] Braham said today it's the
[28:12] word so the word has to flash from one
[28:15] side to the other any Doctrine could
[28:17] come up any person could say anything
[28:19] they want but when it's the yman thumb
[28:20] and which is the Holy Ghost word of God
[28:23] for this hour it's got to
[28:26] flash but in order to Flash the stones
[28:30] weren't just in the earth it had to be
[28:32] mined out by men they had to take from
[28:35] the pressure of the whatever happened
[28:38] earthquakes whatever and they got in
[28:40] there and found these Stones they still
[28:42] weren't ready for the yman the thumb
[28:44] them until they were polished and did
[28:46] you know that the scripture talks about
[28:49] jewels a jewel is a stone that might be
[28:53] beautiful but it's only beautiful when
[28:57] it's polished
[28:59] and the polishing of the stone has to be
[29:00] done by careful Artisans that know
[29:03] exactly how to polish it so that it will
[29:06] reflect the light of the Y th and this
[29:09] precious word of God has to be preached
[29:11] by those that are anointed by the Holy
[29:14] Ghost so that when it goes forth there's
[29:16] a flashing of lights that you and I know
[29:20] that's nothing but the Holy Ghost and
[29:22] that's the way we live today is
[29:24] believing not only the prophet's message
[29:26] here but everything that's said there
[29:29] along with how the how the Holy Spirit
[29:32] has revealed it to the ministers so
[29:34] they're vital because they're the ones
[29:36] that take the sword of the spirit and
[29:37] trim the
[29:39] stones of
[29:41] Revelation I'm going to get into
[29:43] something here and but all of them have
[29:45] to be polished in order to reflect the
[29:49] light
[29:53] and the same stones in the Old Testament
[29:57] that were on the ephod or breastplate of
[30:01] the priest also are the same stones that
[30:04] are in the 21st chapter of the Book of
[30:06] Revelation where the wall of the
[30:08] foundation is the same 12 Stones but you
[30:12] may know or you may not know I'm just
[30:13] giving a little history here that every
[30:15] one of those stones that was in the Y
[30:17] and the thumm had a name written on it
[30:21] it was the 12 tribes of Israel so when
[30:24] the priest would go into the Hol place
[30:26] he was carrying the names
[30:29] to remind not remind God so much but
[30:32] remind himself and what he went in there
[30:34] to pray for and that is the people the
[30:37] Israelis the Jewish people and because
[30:40] he was the priest he could offer up
[30:42] sacrifices and praise for those 12
[30:45] tribes now those same Stones according
[30:49] to the scripture are in the foundation
[30:52] wall of the New Jerusalem which is let
[30:55] me show you the bride the Lamb's wife
[30:57] amen so you're actually not only being
[31:00] reflected but you're actually proving
[31:02] that your name is in those stones so
[31:05] whatever Jesus did and called you by
[31:08] being crucified and and smitten you were
[31:11] there in him when that happened and you
[31:14] can't be released until the
[31:17] pain you're never going to be uh a
[31:22] living an epistle known and read of all
[31:24] men until you have absolutely taken your
[31:28] position which is in Christ and now
[31:30] you're manifest with a name and that
[31:33] name is in the
[31:36] city all those stones represent the
[31:40] Bride of Jesus Christ let John said let
[31:43] me show you the bride the Lamb's wife
[31:46] and all of those stones were right there
[31:47] again from the Old Testament all the way
[31:49] to the New Testament now I want to I
[31:52] want to go into
[31:54] something that I didn't touch on very
[31:56] much last time but
[31:58] that word cleft is quite an interesting
[32:01] word it can be a division it can be a a
[32:06] cutting it can be a a cataclysmic event
[32:10] and uh when we just read what what God
[32:14] said I'll just put you in the Clift of
[32:16] the rock that's an impression or
[32:18] depression in the Rock but a lot of
[32:20] cliffs and like I mentioned before I've
[32:22] been in the mountains I've hunted and
[32:24] climbed mountains and when you get to a
[32:26] cliff you got to be careful because
[32:27] usually goes down to a V and if you're
[32:30] going down too tight and you're not
[32:32] watching you're going to get stuck in
[32:34] that so the Clift of The Rock and
[32:37] doesn't necessarily have to be a clevice
[32:38] or crevice all the way down it just
[32:40] needs to be a place of depressed area
[32:43] where God can come and meet with his
[32:46] child so what I'm talking about tonight
[32:49] is there is a place for every believer
[32:52] because the fact that it was spoken in
[32:55] the book of Exodus and that Clift became
[32:57] became such an important part of that
[32:59] whole story where the Clift was put in
[33:03] there because that is exactly where God
[33:05] was going to meet his people you are not
[33:08] here to try to prove you're somebody
[33:11] special you are here because God
[33:13] orchestrated your time in the word to be
[33:17] present in in in this day and he alone
[33:20] he is the only one that can place you in
[33:24] the Rock of Ages that Clift of the rock
[33:27] is so vital and important that without
[33:30] that Cliff there wouldn't even be
[33:32] anything for a Believer because brother
[33:34] Bram said and I'm going to read it here
[33:36] in a moment in the Masterpiece when God
[33:39] smote his son he did it because he knew
[33:43] there had to be something that would
[33:44] come out from his son and that would be
[33:47] the Bride of Jesus Christ so he was
[33:49] obligated by his word to send more than
[33:51] just a an example through a death on a
[33:54] cross but more than that an actual life
[33:57] to somebody that's going to come in
[34:01] 2024 there's no time frame with
[34:04] God he's he's in eternity from past to
[34:07] present and for forever and ever and
[34:09] ever but he saw you in Jesus Christ now
[34:13] let me let me
[34:15] just ask you some questions here I
[34:17] thought this would be probably the way
[34:19] it's kind of a little teaching service
[34:21] tonight and it's hard to see up here I
[34:23] don't know if it's me or just the glare
[34:25] but I I can't see my Bible so so I got
[34:27] to hold it up here and they said well
[34:30] you can switch I have no idea what to
[34:31] turn on or turn off so we'll just leave
[34:33] it
[34:34] alone forgive me but
[34:37] uh all right the lights I I don't think
[34:40] it'll do any good because there's such
[34:41] glare
[34:43] there I'm going to ask some questions
[34:45] now I had to write these questions
[34:49] down what causes a
[34:53] Clift either an earthquake or some great
[34:56] event
[34:59] why did God use
[35:01] it why did he use the Cliff of the
[35:04] rock to hide Us in
[35:08] him is the injury and the safety of that
[35:12] Cliff one of the
[35:14] same and listen to what I'm I'm getting
[35:17] to here is the
[35:19] injury which is a Clift because when
[35:22] Moses took that rod and and struck that
[35:25] rock there was a cliff brother Bram said
[35:27] it left a Clift that Clift now was that
[35:31] only the injury of the rock or did it
[35:34] also type
[35:36] safety do we enter the cliff by our own
[35:41] will what does the Clift of suffering
[35:45] offer to
[35:48] us it actually offers a release from our
[35:51] guilt and
[35:53] unbelief do we find sustenance in the
[35:56] rock
[35:58] yes honey water and
[36:01] safety is there suffering in the Cliff
[36:04] of the Rock I'm going to have you turn
[36:06] to First
[36:08] Peter first
[36:10] Peter
[36:13] and 1 Peter
[36:25] 3 1 Peter 3
[36:28] Verse
[36:30] 18 for Christ also hath once suffered
[36:34] for sins the just for the unjust that he
[36:38] might bring us to God being put to death
[36:41] in the flesh but quickened by the
[36:46] spirit that
[36:48] is now let's just go over to verse 19
[36:58] wherefore let them that suffer according
[37:00] to the will of
[37:02] God commit the keeping of their souls to
[37:06] him in well doing as unto a faithful
[37:10] Creator in other words what Peter is
[37:12] saying here you're going to suffer for
[37:15] his name's
[37:16] sake there is no way that the bride is
[37:20] not going to
[37:22] suffer because the Bible says you are
[37:24] going to suffer so you can plan on
[37:27] having things to suffer but I want to
[37:31] show you from the scripture that the
[37:33] things that we suffer our Lord went
[37:35] through it Paul went through it all of
[37:37] it is what by suffering we will earn a
[37:41] crown and we will reign with him now in
[37:44] Romans 8:19 or 88 I reckon that the
[37:48] sufferings of this present time are not
[37:51] worthy to be compared with the glory
[37:53] which shall be revealed in us and
[37:56] Hebrews 2 nine for the suffering of
[37:59] death and so forth verse 10 perfect
[38:02] through sufferings and verse 18 He
[38:04] himself has suffered being tempted so
[38:08] all of this is proving that in that in
[38:11] that Cliff there's going to be suffering
[38:14] I want to read some things
[38:16] that that I hope will get us started on
[38:19] some things that I I have on my
[38:22] heart now when last time I was referring
[38:26] to brother bram's message on the
[38:29] Masterpiece and how the great sculpture
[38:32] Michelangelo worked on that remember now
[38:35] Michelangelo he physically suffered
[38:38] doing all the that chipping that he he
[38:41] did and it it became such a experience
[38:44] for him that he was he was emotional
[38:47] over it because as he saw that Vision
[38:49] being played out in his work the closer
[38:53] it got to where he thought this is
[38:55] exactly what I saw in my mind
[38:58] and he was he got more excited and when
[39:00] the word becomes real to you and you get
[39:03] excited what the word is doing and the
[39:04] preacher actually says something that
[39:06] quickens it to you you get excited
[39:08] there's an excitement there what is it
[39:10] it's
[39:11] inspiration and and Michelangelo had to
[39:13] have the inspiration brother B said it
[39:14] was the inspiration that caused him to
[39:16] strike that image it wasn't because he
[39:19] had to or was told to the inspired word
[39:22] in his mind in His image of that
[39:25] Michelangelo's image of Moses he had to
[39:27] strike it so that's what God did and
[39:30] I'll read it here in a moment but we
[39:32] have to remember now inspiration is what
[39:34] changes things inspiration is what what
[39:37] caused Moses to strike that rock and
[39:41] when he struck the rock the first time
[39:44] it left a brother BR said it left a
[39:46] divot or
[39:49] a area that what was now what I just
[39:53] want to back up a minute watch now when
[39:56] Moses image was hit by Michelangelo that
[40:00] piece that flew off of his right knee he
[40:02] didn't try to glue that back
[40:06] on he didn't want to take the mechanical
[40:09] uh whatever he could and put it back on
[40:13] it was a result of the inspiration that
[40:14] caused it and when God put his word in
[40:19] your life and it became such a part of
[40:23] you he wasn't going to say well I'll
[40:24] just go ahead and find another piece and
[40:26] and patch that brother patch that sister
[40:28] up he didn't do that brother bradam said
[40:31] the same the same thing that he took out
[40:33] of Eve out of out of I'm sorry out of
[40:37] Adam became Eve and you can't replace it
[40:39] it's the same even though it's different
[40:41] it's still the same it's the same God
[40:43] and the word is the same no matter where
[40:45] it comes from no matter who it applies
[40:47] to it's all the same God doesn't changed
[40:49] his mind about his word because it's
[40:51] accurate and right to the point and it
[40:53] fits every situation but sometimes as
[40:56] believers we think that shouldn't happen
[40:58] to us why is God allowing that pain and
[41:01] suffering it's because he knows exactly
[41:04] what you and I
[41:05] need we cannot understand all the
[41:08] workings of God all we have to do is
[41:10] remember we must follow what the word
[41:13] said even though it causes suffering
[41:16] amen you see where I probably I'm going
[41:18] here I want to say this
[41:21] here the
[41:25] marble that
[41:27] Michelangelo started with was probably
[41:31] brother BR said maybe three or four foot
[41:33] piece of
[41:34] marble but it wasn't just the Moses
[41:39] image he was
[41:41] also displaying The Ten Commandments
[41:44] that Moses was
[41:46] holding so Michelangelo actually saw the
[41:50] importance of the of the man Moses
[41:54] holding the law of God and remember the
[41:58] scripture says every knee shall bow and
[42:00] every tongue shall confess that Jesus is
[42:02] Lord so where did he strike the image on
[42:05] the
[42:06] knee and what was the word
[42:09] speak so whenever God does something he
[42:12] has to say something according to his
[42:14] word so the knee actually would have to
[42:17] bow if it was a real person but it was
[42:19] it was just a statue but it was showing
[42:23] that God was speaking through that
[42:25] Michelangelo that artist and I I I was
[42:28] just thinking of the fact that the
[42:29] prophet saw that and actually had a
[42:31] message over that nobody else that I've
[42:34] ever heard has ever preached on
[42:35] Michelangelo and the Moses it was the
[42:38] prophet that saw that and how he typed
[42:40] it to Jesus Christ and the father
[42:42] striking his own son and so because of
[42:46] that it it it's a lot more precious to
[42:49] me now let me just read what I've
[42:51] probably gone through this four or five
[42:52] times and I every time I do I see
[42:54] something different but let me just read
[42:56] what he said what brother brandham said
[42:58] in this message he said his own image
[43:02] was reflected in his
[43:04] work God and Christ were one as in as
[43:07] much until he put his own Spirit into
[43:10] him and the image and the Builder became
[43:14] one his
[43:16] Masterpiece now he said Moses was in the
[43:20] work of St Angelo or Michelangelo rather
[43:22] was a sculpture work that was dead
[43:25] because he had been made out of stone
[43:29] but here the master builder when he got
[43:31] his handiwork perfected he stepped into
[43:34] it so the Creator actually became the
[43:38] one that possessed the very image of
[43:40] Christ so there was nothing in in that
[43:44] uh situation that caused anything other
[43:47] than what God's will was so he in other
[43:49] words he absolutely had his own image
[43:52] being manifest in that son of his and I
[43:55] want to say that Michelangelo had a son
[43:58] and that was Moses in that rock he was
[44:01] producing what was in his mind so it was
[44:03] actually a son of Michelangelo just just
[44:07] stay with me for a minute and because he
[44:09] was a son he was a created being from
[44:11] the very thoughts of Michelangelo that's
[44:14] what our heavenly father did he had a
[44:16] thought of you and of me back before the
[44:18] foundation of the world and he had to
[44:20] display it and created through his
[44:26] son there isn't a person on the earth
[44:30] but what can say my image my life if
[44:34] they would be a believer would say God
[44:37] orchestrated what I am where I am and
[44:39] who I am because I was in him before the
[44:41] foundation world if you are a
[44:43] Believer amen right that's exactly
[44:48] right
[44:49] so his Michelangelo's love for his
[44:53] son caused him
[44:56] Joy because in his vision of
[44:59] Moses he had the
[45:02] word which was held by Moses but what I
[45:05] didn't mention the last time was that he
[45:08] got friendly with a priest of the
[45:10] Vatican and this priest was a preacher
[45:13] every weekend he would go out and preach
[45:14] at these little groups and he invited
[45:17] Michelangelo to come to his his home or
[45:21] whatever it was the parish there and so
[45:23] Michelangelo stayed with that priest and
[45:25] the priest was in the Valle VA of course
[45:27] and knew and of course they had one of
[45:29] the original uh interpretations of the
[45:32] scripture the Vatican did and so he
[45:34] learned everything about and that's what
[45:36] I believe caused him to do Moses because
[45:38] he knew Moses had the law and this is
[45:41] back back in the 14th hund the 14th uh
[45:45] 14th century and so here we've got this
[45:48] man called
[45:50] Michelangelo being tutored by this
[45:52] priest that's preaching the gospel in
[45:56] through the Catholic but that's all
[45:57] right and and it was affecting
[45:59] Michelangelo to where he had a vision
[46:02] based on what this man was saying with
[46:05] the Old Testament
[46:07] whatever now here we've got this this
[46:10] going on and and brother Bram I'm going
[46:13] to pick it up in a minute he said he
[46:16] saw he he said he when he struck the
[46:19] image the spirit of Moses had to be
[46:22] released because in his mind in
[46:24] Michelangelo's mind he knew
[46:27] that was truth and it was actually an
[46:29] image that he had in his mind so he had
[46:32] to strike it he had to say speak because
[46:35] it was his manifestation of what he
[46:37] already had and if you don't say speak
[46:40] nothing will happen so he believed so
[46:43] much that this thing had to come to pass
[46:46] and and actually be a living entity that
[46:49] he had to holler to speak it wasn't that
[46:52] he brother Bri said that was the
[46:53] inspiration it struck him so much that
[46:55] he had to say speak and the prophet took
[46:58] that over to us in in our day and let me
[47:03] read what the prophet said here and I
[47:05] want to get I'm not into my message yet
[47:08] but I want to lay this Foundation here a
[47:10] little bit first just bear with
[47:12] me and now in order for this to speak he
[47:15] is the word and for the word to speak he
[47:17] must come into the image and then for
[47:20] the image to speak it's got to be
[47:22] smitten he comes into the image and then
[47:25] in order to speak the perfect Redeemer
[47:27] all the types of the Old Testament met
[47:30] in him all of them and he said
[47:34] therefore it's a match piece remember we
[47:37] talked about the and the piece
[47:39] of paper he tore in half and you
[47:40] couldn't ever uh match it because it was
[47:43] one piece cut in half brother Bram said
[47:45] that's exactly what it was it had to be
[47:47] the exact image that he saw in his mind
[47:50] and he says everything will work
[47:52] together for good and he called it a
[47:54] dirty a dirty piece of paper
[47:59] paper because it wasn't the paper that
[48:01] got washed it was the
[48:04] Garment and the Garment came
[48:07] dirty that was us we were s we actually
[48:11] caused the the smitten rock it was our
[48:16] unbelief now it was type I know it was
[48:18] in the type of the Old Testament but
[48:20] Moses actually did it because of
[48:21] unbelief he was told don't strike it
[48:23] just speak to it but he went against
[48:25] what the word said speak and he didn't
[48:27] make the promised land because of that
[48:30] so how are we going to get by if we
[48:32] don't do exactly what the word said we
[48:34] change one thing or do another thing God
[48:36] forgave
[48:37] him he was by Grace he was forgiven but
[48:41] he still didn't see the Promise Land
[48:43] because he disobeyed what God has said
[48:46] that's why I read in Corinthians about
[48:48] we crucify him again by what by not
[48:52] obeying the word so that cleft is
[48:55] because he didn't obey the word he used
[48:59] a force of anger and and and whatever
[49:03] else that caused that to happen now
[49:05] listen to what he said here I just trust
[49:07] the Lord will help us to get into the
[49:10] the Crux of this whole thing here now
[49:13] the smiting of C Christ the smiting of
[49:16] Christ was for a
[49:20] cause that he might take from him one to
[49:25] be a family the bride he might take him
[49:28] a bride so when his Masterpiece was
[49:31] perfected then he had to Smite it to
[49:33] take from him not another piece not
[49:37] another creation but of the same
[49:40] creation so it had to be part of him
[49:43] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[49:45] he didn't add another one to it he
[49:47] actually took you from him you are so
[49:51] specialise God sir but the the thing is
[49:55] when when God was pleasing to to bruise
[49:58] him and and take him and and cause all
[50:02] that pain he did it because he knew that
[50:04] you were in the picture I was in the
[50:06] picture and he can't take something else
[50:08] but what his own son was don't you see
[50:11] that the bone of his bone and flesh of
[50:13] his flesh is because when Adam and Eve
[50:16] were together they were of the same it
[50:19] was Adam's name Eve didn't even have a
[50:22] name yet it was Adam because she came
[50:26] from him and you this evening have come
[50:29] from the very crucifixion
[50:33] yourself help us Lord but there's going
[50:36] to be suffering involved in it
[50:40] suffering I want to read some things
[50:46] from now just wait a minute he said
[50:49] here's a beautiful story that comes to
[50:51] my mind when Moses took that rock or
[50:54] that Rod rather and smokee The Rock
[50:57] and The Rock was Christ Jesus is that
[50:59] right The Rock was Christ and he put a
[51:02] cliff in the side of that rock when
[51:05] Israel got hungry from that injury now
[51:10] when Israel got hungry I'm just going to
[51:12] say you're Israel tonight whatever you
[51:14] have need of you're Israel tonight when
[51:16] Israel got hungry what' they do they
[51:19] went and to the Rock and there was
[51:23] bees did you know that the honey of bees
[51:26] could be spread over a horrible wound
[51:28] and no infection will come as a result
[51:30] of it prise God the Indians did that
[51:33] when they were working out and whatever
[51:35] running and hunting and whatever and one
[51:37] of them got injured they just found a
[51:39] beehive with a honey and they spread the
[51:41] honey in there and then sold them up and
[51:44] the Honey won't let anything contrary
[51:46] and did you also know I'm going to go
[51:49] this before I get get going that the
[51:52] blood of a
[51:53] lamb has got natural
[51:56] bodies in it that'll actually negate the
[52:01] effect of a poisonous
[52:03] Serpent and fact the blood of the Lamb
[52:07] is an antidote for that so when you go
[52:11] to a hospital and you you get bit by a
[52:13] snake and you got this it's a antitype
[52:17] that kills that poison and because it's
[52:20] the blood of the Lamb they don't use a
[52:22] lot of other creatures but the blood of
[52:24] the Lamb is got such a make that they
[52:27] could actually use that to to satisfy
[52:30] the need of killing that Venom that the
[52:33] snake has put in you that's the Lamb's
[52:37] blood Satan is sure tried to do his
[52:40] stinging and biting and whatever but
[52:41] there's a blood of the Lamb that was
[52:43] shed on Calvary that every one of us can
[52:46] come under that that precious blood and
[52:49] Satan cannot get anywhere with us
[52:51] because we have been proven by God
[52:53] himself that the blood of the Lamb is
[52:55] all healing
[52:57] am amen amen so they went to the Rock to
[53:02] get the water they went to the Rock to
[53:04] get honey they went to the Rock to have
[53:11] safety I want to just read this that
[53:14] brother bradam
[53:15] said he said The Rock was the driest
[53:18] place and he said all the critics would
[53:20] say you know we've we've checked it down
[53:23] there in the in the in the little uh
[53:26] Oasis and the little spots down in the
[53:28] in the valley and in the stream beds and
[53:31] that's where the water had to go and
[53:33] brother B said they went and searched it
[53:34] all out the driest place in the whole
[53:36] area was this rock up
[53:40] here it had no way did it have any kind
[53:43] of moisture in it at all in fact it was
[53:45] the driest place in the world but that's
[53:48] how God
[53:49] works and so he he caused the water now
[53:53] remember Paul said the rock that
[53:55] followed them them and Peter and all the
[53:59] disciples we'll get into it probably if
[54:01] we have time the rock that follow them
[54:03] now I don't know how that happened I
[54:05] don't know the rock that followed them I
[54:07] don't know if it was a spiritual Rock
[54:08] Only but I'll tell you one thing it
[54:11] provided
[54:13] water and this is the rock that we
[54:17] follow amen and that what follows us it
[54:19] isn't just that we follow a message the
[54:21] message follows us there's going to be a
[54:24] produc something produced in in the
[54:26] believer's life that because we follow
[54:29] that no it's because God follows us and
[54:32] he's there a present help in time of
[54:34] trouble Hallelujah we and there I'm
[54:37] thinking about blind barus you know
[54:39] there he was blind and he starts to
[54:42] holler but he had one desire he wanted
[54:45] the Rock and it wasn't until he got the
[54:47] rock to stop and listen a little bit
[54:49] that he got his his healing his eyes
[54:52] were blind but now because of the rock
[54:54] he received his healing that that's
[54:56] water folks that's a water from the Rock
[54:59] and it isn't just a natural water it's a
[55:01] spiritual water hallelujah it's a
[55:04] spiritual
[55:07] water this is something that kind of
[55:10] surprised me brother brandham said I
[55:12] think this morning in the
[55:15] ministry uh I think that would be good
[55:18] for me to say this to show you what
[55:21] effect the ministry has on different
[55:24] places of the world
[55:27] and he said the American people you
[55:28] Brethren are the hardest Feld there is
[55:31] anywhere now I've been overseas and for
[55:36] the most part they're pretty accepting
[55:38] of of
[55:41] um I can't say of just us in the message
[55:44] but wherever we went they were more
[55:46] accepting it doesn't mean now that we've
[55:48] got churches in the message but before
[55:49] we did in denomination there wasn't that
[55:52] many back in the 50s and 60s there was
[55:54] the prophet but he was thrown out of a
[55:56] lot of areas and wasn't allowed to even
[55:58] come and preach but and brother brandham
[56:01] said this he said you Brethren are in
[56:03] the hardest field there is anywhere I've
[56:05] been in Africa India and throw on and
[56:08] brother um or practically the world over
[56:12] and I've never seen a field so hard to
[56:14] battle as here in
[56:17] America this needs a missionaries worse
[56:20] than anywhere I've ever seen in all my
[56:22] life for an educated Heathen is harder
[56:25] to de deal with than an uneducated
[56:28] Heathen listen to these
[56:30] words Heathen is an
[56:33] unbeliever and you have that and you've
[56:36] got a battle here the missionary may
[56:38] have a lot of stuff to contend with
[56:40] malaria Amia and so forth but he don't
[56:43] have the demon
[56:46] Spirits I mean those demons that's got
[56:49] into culture minded men you talk about
[56:52] something hard to deal with and what's
[56:54] he saying their worse than the hot and
[56:57] tots and uneducated and and sinners over
[57:00] there over overseas but listen what he
[57:03] says recently I had breakfast with a
[57:07] bunch of
[57:09] ministers and I say this with respect
[57:12] brethen I would have rather had
[57:14] breakfast with a bunch of witch
[57:16] doctors that sounds horrible than these
[57:20] men I would have had a better reception
[57:23] think of this now I've had I had had a
[57:27] more and agree greeing spirit with a
[57:30] bunch of wit doctors many times than I
[57:33] would with a bunch of
[57:35] ministers such a horrible thing God
[57:38] Deliver Us from such we are so
[57:42] intellectual everything is moved away
[57:44] from the spirit it's the word it's the
[57:47] word it's the word now listen to what
[57:48] he's saying here sure I believe in the
[57:51] word but if the spirit don't agree with
[57:53] the word then you got something mixed up
[57:55] somewhere
[57:57] that's hard well brother brother Jim
[58:00] we're in the message we're around it
[58:02] still applies in the message if it's all
[58:05] word and they keep saying word but
[58:06] there's no demonstration in the spirit
[58:08] and power so nothing gets done they just
[58:10] keep giving the word the spirit's the
[58:13] only thing that gives life I'm going to
[58:15] say that again the spirit is the only
[58:17] thing that gives life when God quickens
[58:19] his word to a soul I don't care if it's
[58:21] for Divine Healing or salvation or
[58:23] whatever once that happen that that's
[58:26] who for sees anything anybody can talk
[58:28] about because the Baptists talk about
[58:30] the word all the
[58:32] time but they you give them the word
[58:34] test they don't want that why did
[58:37] Brother Brown do that because I see that
[58:39] creeping into the message not here but
[58:41] creeping in the message where if they
[58:43] can intellectualize or spend a lot of
[58:45] time and talk about something talking
[58:47] about it isn't being in it when you're
[58:50] in the word you are part of it and you
[58:53] express what God has done inside you
[58:55] that's not talking about something
[58:57] that's not talking about faith that's
[58:59] living there's Faith inside of you to
[59:02] receive what God has put in our path
[59:05] today now listen to what brother Bram
[59:09] said on on this and I'm going to try to
[59:11] get in my message not long ago there was
[59:12] an Infidel that passed through the
[59:15] lands making
[59:18] infidels out of supposedly to be
[59:20] Christians he was so educated till the
[59:23] ministers was afraid to attack him
[59:27] and then he went to Europe and on his
[59:30] road back he got broke down he went out
[59:33] into the West to make him a rest Place
[59:37] one day while he walked out from his
[59:39] Camp oh he swelled himself out because
[59:42] he was an
[59:43] Infidel he began to look down there come
[59:47] that whispering of the wind down through
[59:51] the pines and he began to look up he
[59:54] looked at those rocks hanging in the
[59:56] mountain and he said oh
[59:58] rocks who put you in the
[1:00:02] mountains have I been
[1:00:04] wrong about the chronology of this
[1:00:08] world all of a sudden God began to speak
[1:00:13] the Bible said if they hold their peace
[1:00:15] the rocks will cry out God in his
[1:00:18] Universe speaking from the
[1:00:20] rock well that Infidel knelt down by the
[1:00:23] side of a tree and said oh God have
[1:00:26] mercy on my soul there you are their
[1:00:29] pastors were afraid to attack him but
[1:00:32] God could let the rock speak out because
[1:00:34] God's in his Universe speaking to his
[1:00:37] people we think we've got it all figured
[1:00:39] out but God can just take an Infidel and
[1:00:42] by just showing him the Rock and the
[1:00:44] question is how did that ever come to be
[1:00:46] God can save a person just by his word
[1:00:50] just by an example
[1:00:52] Hallelujah yes and he said he said one
[1:00:56] time they wanted to drink brother BR
[1:00:58] said and they went to the Rock and they
[1:01:00] want to get something to eat they went
[1:01:02] to the Rock and the bees had made the
[1:01:05] honey there
[1:01:08] now I'm going to go into a a thought
[1:01:12] here and I want you to bear with me just
[1:01:14] a moment
[1:01:15] here when the scripture in John 1 in the
[1:01:21] beginning was the word you know what
[1:01:24] that word word means in the beginning
[1:01:27] was the
[1:01:28] logos and you know what let's turn this
[1:01:31] I want you to see something here and
[1:01:32] we'll go into my my thought
[1:01:36] John the Gospel of
[1:01:50] John say Amen when youen when you're
[1:01:54] there John 1
[1:01:59] on I'm
[1:02:01] sorry well
[1:02:09] well verse one John 1 St John 1 I'm
[1:02:15] sorry in the
[1:02:18] beginning was the
[1:02:20] word now that word is
[1:02:23] logos it means a thought
[1:02:26] or a
[1:02:28] concept or the expression or utterance
[1:02:31] of that thought in other words before it
[1:02:35] could become a spoken word it had to be
[1:02:38] a thought
[1:02:39] first so it wasn't God it was the word
[1:02:43] or logos which was the thoughts of God
[1:02:46] and then that attribute and thought of
[1:02:48] God when it's expressed became the word
[1:02:51] we call it this Bible but like brother
[1:02:53] Chad said the word w d is not w d in
[1:02:57] every
[1:02:58] language it's our English Lang language
[1:03:01] so it what it is is a uh connection of
[1:03:05] alphabetical letters w o r d but it's
[1:03:09] way deeper than that that's just
[1:03:12] describing in our vernacular or our way
[1:03:15] of saying it that it was the word but
[1:03:17] it's the actual thought of
[1:03:20] God it's a very it's a very thought so
[1:03:23] when God had a thought about Christ or
[1:03:26] thought about um the the word the image
[1:03:30] it had to be expressed because he
[1:03:32] thought it before it was expressed in
[1:03:34] other words you are a thought expressed
[1:03:37] today that's right you are here as a
[1:03:39] thought expressed so don't don't get
[1:03:42] worried about whether or not you're
[1:03:43] doing this or right or whatever God had
[1:03:45] placed you here because in his Old
[1:03:47] Kingdom in his whole uh attributes and
[1:03:51] all of his thoughts and everything you
[1:03:52] were for ordained to be here amen now
[1:03:55] let me let me go with a thought
[1:03:59] here the thought of this logos which is
[1:04:03] the thought or concept or expression
[1:04:07] once that is
[1:04:09] expressed that's part of what God is so
[1:04:12] when he sent his word to heal them it
[1:04:15] wasn't just a w r d it was a thought but
[1:04:20] until the individual picks up that same
[1:04:22] Revelation and thought he won't even get
[1:04:24] his healing because it's God expressing
[1:04:28] himself in word form but not just as w d
[1:04:32] but his very nature it's very love and
[1:04:36] that's what Calvary was all about
[1:04:38] Calvary was more than just a cross on a
[1:04:41] hill somewhere it was a very image of
[1:04:44] God In A Man Called Jesus Christ and it
[1:04:47] had to be done because you were in him
[1:04:50] before the foundation of the
[1:04:53] world I want to show you something here
[1:04:56] folks that we were in
[1:05:00] him but we had to suffer so because the
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:05] word the word which is the
[1:05:09] logos was
[1:05:11] uttered and Jesus Christ became a a
[1:05:16] fulfillment or a image of that word
[1:05:19] being fulfilled that everything that
[1:05:21] occurred on Calvary was for a specific
[1:05:24] reason so it's God Alone with his
[1:05:26] attributes but now he's expressed
[1:05:29] himself through a flesh bone body called
[1:05:33] Jesus Christ that was his son because
[1:05:35] God is a
[1:05:36] spirit they that worship Him must
[1:05:38] worship Him in spirit and the truth God
[1:05:40] isn't whenever he took on that form by
[1:05:43] that went past uh Moses that wasn't
[1:05:47] necessarily what God looks like he could
[1:05:49] could have been MDC it could have been
[1:05:51] anything he formed because he could do
[1:05:54] anything but we we as Believers we want
[1:05:57] to see God but we're not going to
[1:05:59] necessarily see him we'll see him in
[1:06:00] action in The
[1:06:03] Bride that's how we see God or the
[1:06:06] action in us when God reveals something
[1:06:09] in our souls that's the god of Heaven
[1:06:12] operating in
[1:06:14] someone that's why the prophets were so
[1:06:16] vital in the scriptures because they
[1:06:18] were actually speaking the very thoughts
[1:06:20] of God and you can't have the thoughts
[1:06:23] of God just come and then dissipate and
[1:06:26] fall by the roadside and no don't
[1:06:29] accomplish anything it's God's word
[1:06:31] coming to pass by the prophets now
[1:06:35] there there's a substance in
[1:06:40] that there's a substance in that and I
[1:06:43] want to get to the to the Clift again I
[1:06:45] want to go back to that Clift again so
[1:06:48] when
[1:06:50] when Moses struck that rock the first
[1:06:53] time and water came forth
[1:06:56] the second time he was told to speak to
[1:06:58] the Rock and because he didn't speak to
[1:07:01] the Rock he smoked The Rock he didn't
[1:07:03] get to go to the promised land but God's
[1:07:06] mercy and grace extended it because it
[1:07:08] wasn't very long that he was on the
[1:07:10] mount
[1:07:11] Transfiguration so wherever Satan wanted
[1:07:14] to find out where his body was it wasn't
[1:07:16] going to be possible because when God
[1:07:18] does a good burial or whatever he he
[1:07:21] doesn't let anybody know where it
[1:07:24] is and that's that's why the book of
[1:07:26] Jude like I mentioned you know
[1:07:30] Michael he wanted to know the devil
[1:07:32] didn't want him to keep it quiet he
[1:07:35] wanted to know where Moses was buried
[1:07:37] and he he never did find out did
[1:07:41] he no he
[1:07:43] didn't but there's two
[1:07:46] strikings two
[1:07:48] striking but I want you to notice
[1:07:50] something it was a believer that struck
[1:07:53] him
[1:07:56] wasn't a stranger Moses was a Believer
[1:07:59] he had just had thus sayi the Lord speak
[1:08:01] to the Rock and he struck the rock so a
[1:08:04] Believer is responsible for the
[1:08:07] crucifixion stay with me just for a
[1:08:09] little bit so we don't think we've done
[1:08:11] anything wrong but our sins and
[1:08:13] iniquities is what caused
[1:08:16] Calvary do you believe that it's because
[1:08:19] of us he would never have it never would
[1:08:23] have been a an experience we had
[1:08:25] anything to say about it we would never
[1:08:27] let him go to the Cross Peter said that
[1:08:30] and I was just thinking the other day
[1:08:32] you know that cross that wood whether
[1:08:33] was made out of gopher wood or whatever
[1:08:35] wood it was or Sycamore or
[1:08:37] whatever God knew when that little seed
[1:08:40] in the ground produce a little leaf that
[1:08:43] was the cross that Jesus was hung on it
[1:08:46] had to mature but he also knew there was
[1:08:48] 153 fishes that when the boys got out of
[1:08:51] their fishing it was all counted so
[1:08:53] everything means something to God yeah
[1:08:56] so why did the Bible why did they say oh
[1:08:59] there was 13 because little numbers are
[1:09:01] important to God I had a man that that
[1:09:05] uh I sold my when I sold my little camp
[1:09:07] trailer I wanted to go in and talk and I
[1:09:09] said uh we were talking he said I'm a
[1:09:12] changed man I said oh that's wonderful
[1:09:14] yeah he said I just got saved I said you
[1:09:17] did yeah but he said uh of course you
[1:09:21] know how denomination consider save so I
[1:09:24] said well that's fine so uh what's
[1:09:27] favorite scripture do you have oh he
[1:09:29] said I love all the word except for one
[1:09:32] thing I
[1:09:34] can't I can't understand why these names
[1:09:37] in the Old Testament are so hard to
[1:09:40] pronounce and I said okay he said so I
[1:09:43] just don't even read them I said okay
[1:09:46] and I told my pastor they're just hard
[1:09:48] to too hard to pronounce so I don't even
[1:09:50] read them and he looked at me and he
[1:09:51] said what if your name was in the Bible
[1:09:54] and nobody wanted to pronounce your
[1:09:57] name he said you know brother Jim that
[1:10:00] changed me I just realized everybody and
[1:10:03] every name is important I said it is
[1:10:06] even though if we don't understand it
[1:10:08] all it's still important to
[1:10:10] God Amen that's right so it was a
[1:10:14] believer that struck
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:18] but I want to take that thought just for
[1:10:20] a few moments and run it through the
[1:10:23] scripture when it pleased the Lord Lord
[1:10:25] to bruise him there had to
[1:10:28] be
[1:10:30] a an end I was thinking about lost and
[1:10:34] found you as little kids we
[1:10:38] remember you you heard the story when
[1:10:40] the boots were in the back room and they
[1:10:42] put it on no that's not mine and they
[1:10:44] went back and forth they took it on they
[1:10:45] put it on and then finally he said but
[1:10:48] my mom made me wear them it's because
[1:10:51] they didn't know who the boots long
[1:10:53] belong to and so the lost and found
[1:10:55] their the poor teacher of those little
[1:10:56] kids he she's trying to figure out who
[1:10:58] the boots belong to well it's the same
[1:11:01] thing with in the scriptures there's
[1:11:03] lost and there's found there is a uh
[1:11:08] necessary application of that and it's
[1:11:12] also in the Bible where we have the the
[1:11:16] results
[1:11:18] of um trying to think of that what they
[1:11:20] call the uh oh dear I didn't write it
[1:11:24] down but it's uh cause and effect so
[1:11:27] when you have the cause of something
[1:11:29] there's an effect to
[1:11:30] it so the cause of Christ is to bring
[1:11:35] out a bride for him the effect the cause
[1:11:40] of him dying on the cross was to produce
[1:11:42] something which was the effect which was
[1:11:45] the absolute bride of Jesus Christ but
[1:11:47] it took a cause something had to die
[1:11:50] something had to be bruised in in order
[1:11:53] for you the effect to come out out
[1:11:55] because God there's always a cause and
[1:11:57] effect to everything and brother BR said
[1:11:59] you know you have to know your motive
[1:12:01] and objective so God had a motive and an
[1:12:05] objective to have Moses strike that rock
[1:12:08] now it wasn't in the time of this of the
[1:12:11] crucifixion but it typed it and so as we
[1:12:13] look at the the the Clift of the rock
[1:12:16] the Clift had to be absolutely part of
[1:12:20] that whole scenario of the Cross and the
[1:12:22] and the sufferings and everything
[1:12:23] because you were the one that had to be
[1:12:26] caught in that cliff and let me just say
[1:12:28] something here if you are in the Clift
[1:12:31] of the rock the cleft of the rock is
[1:12:36] vital for the Salvation of not just you
[1:12:39] but you see you're responsible for more
[1:12:42] than just your being in Christ you
[1:12:46] brother I I have the quotes here brother
[1:12:48] BR said you could affect the destiny of
[1:12:51] a lot of people if you don't see the
[1:12:52] word just right am and because we often
[1:12:55] times hurry things up and don't really
[1:12:58] understand the the the revelation of the
[1:13:00] word we we get out of sink we get out of
[1:13:03] place and it causes somebody else to
[1:13:05] maybe fail and that will bring my next
[1:13:08] quote up and I want to share something
[1:13:10] with
[1:13:13] you there's what they call a stone
[1:13:16] cutter Moses
[1:13:19] was a Heuer you know what Huer means
[1:13:23] hewed out a rock and it take someone
[1:13:25] that has the ability to Hue out a rock
[1:13:28] and that Joseph that took Christ's body
[1:13:31] and hewed out that that grave for him
[1:13:35] that no man had ever laid in before he
[1:13:38] was a Huer or a what a stone cutter and
[1:13:43] so because the stone was rejected and we
[1:13:47] can go to Zechariah 4 we can go in the
[1:13:49] rest what Peter said that that stone was
[1:13:52] rejected because it was made to fit in a
[1:13:56] particular place and you are made to fit
[1:13:59] in a particular place that's why you had
[1:14:01] to be in the Cliff of the rock it
[1:14:04] doesn't sound like that there's very
[1:14:06] much but you had to be in the Clift of
[1:14:08] the rock that's why the cliff was
[1:14:11] made Christ was on the cross but he was
[1:14:14] smitten why because you had to come
[1:14:16] forth from him the Cliff of the rock is
[1:14:19] for you and you
[1:14:21] alone now there's where we want to get
[1:14:25] get into our message
[1:14:26] tonight that Clift of the rock
[1:14:31] is oh help us
[1:14:34] Lord
[1:14:35] is the hiding
[1:14:38] place
[1:14:40] where
[1:14:46] he let
[1:14:50] you become washed in the blood of the
[1:14:54] Lamb
[1:14:56] why was he
[1:14:58] wounded why was he forsaken it's for you
[1:15:03] amen so you actually caused the wounds
[1:15:07] yes but you actually came and
[1:15:11] were covered by that blood that caused
[1:15:14] the womb so you took part in both things
[1:15:16] you were not only part of it when he was
[1:15:20] crucified but you are actually that's
[1:15:23] your only help is the bleeding word in
[1:15:27] your life and remember brother Bram said
[1:15:29] the blood doesn't save Faith saves you
[1:15:32] but the blood keeps you and so if we we
[1:15:35] say well brother Jim I I I don't know
[1:15:37] anything about a cliff of the rock
[1:15:38] orever you were already there if you Wen
[1:15:40] in him and the reason you were already
[1:15:42] there is because he had you in his mind
[1:15:45] before the foundation of the world you
[1:15:46] don't remember being on the cross but
[1:15:48] you were
[1:15:49] there because in the body you are right
[1:15:52] now you think oh that was not a a thing
[1:15:55] I remember it all it doesn't matter if
[1:15:56] you remember it's what the Bible said
[1:15:59] and in the Cliff of the rock is where
[1:16:01] the wounds the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:03] cleansed
[1:16:05] you you are absolutely clean every day
[1:16:09] by the blood and that was the blood of
[1:16:12] the lamb but because you are in him you
[1:16:14] are part of that lamb that's right so
[1:16:19] the blood of the Lamb is the wounds that
[1:16:22] Christ was given because of your
[1:16:28] unbelief so the unbelief caused the
[1:16:34] crucifixion I'm going to prove something
[1:16:37] here to you what brother brother
[1:16:39] brandham said here and I just want to
[1:16:40] I'm trying to find it quickly here here
[1:16:43] it
[1:16:45] is now when he came to Jerusalem they
[1:16:48] said make him hold the peace make them
[1:16:50] hold their peace and if they hold their
[1:16:53] peace the rocks will be medely cry out
[1:16:56] the Chief Cornerstone went coming
[1:16:58] rolling down the stones something to
[1:17:01] take place and the Rocks were crying
[1:17:04] out when the same lamb provided for B
[1:17:09] deus's eyes he provided for you 1900 and
[1:17:14] something years ago as he climbed
[1:17:16] golgatha and offered himself all bruised
[1:17:20] and hacked
[1:17:23] together listen friend Abel went out
[1:17:26] into his herd and got the lamb and
[1:17:28] killed it that became the sacrifice you
[1:17:32] better catch this Abel died on the same
[1:17:34] rock that his lamb died
[1:17:36] on are you willing tonight to die out to
[1:17:40] yourself are you willing to die out to
[1:17:43] all your thoughts just lay on the rock
[1:17:45] with your lamb and die out say oh God
[1:17:48] have mercy when I think of men and women
[1:17:50] who think of Pride young men and women
[1:17:53] who give their lives over to to Terrible
[1:17:55] Things thinking that their job and all
[1:17:58] their Prestige of their neighborhood is
[1:18:00] good oh why don't you do
[1:18:04] this crawl up Calvary Yonder
[1:18:09] tonight Hallelujah let your own life be
[1:18:12] hacked out and die Yonder on the cross
[1:18:15] with him and throw your arms around the
[1:18:17] Rock of Ages cleft for me Isn't that
[1:18:22] beautiful because if you don't
[1:18:26] you're not going to be cleansed by the
[1:18:28] blood I'm going to ask you a question
[1:18:30] none of us have ever seen the Blood
[1:18:31] Brother BR said you'll never see the
[1:18:33] blood that was was shed so it's by faith
[1:18:36] that you claim the blood but if we're
[1:18:38] not willing to die and and go back into
[1:18:41] that Cliff of The Rock and be saturated
[1:18:44] with the blood of the Lamb how in the
[1:18:46] world are we going to be saved when you
[1:18:49] are saved you realize your your
[1:18:52] insufficiency your mistakes what you've
[1:18:54] done wrong and you say God please
[1:18:56] forgive me but you've got to step back
[1:18:59] into that Cliff of the rock where Christ
[1:19:02] is so you could be bathed in his blood
[1:19:05] and released from the sin that you
[1:19:07] committed that actually caused
[1:19:10] him and the reason I'm saying this is
[1:19:13] because there's something that
[1:19:17] happened with my little
[1:19:21] granddaughter you know brother brandham
[1:19:22] and I've got a lot of quotes here
[1:19:23] brother Bram said
[1:19:25] that Rod was a rod of
[1:19:28] Correction and so daddies and mommies
[1:19:32] have to have that in their home in order
[1:19:35] to correct whatever is wrong and
[1:19:37] sometimes this little spoiled Spirit
[1:19:39] gets in and the kids oh I know that's
[1:19:42] hard but I'm a grandpa I don't know 12
[1:19:45] 13 times sometimes we have to say things
[1:19:47] we don't like to say right parents right
[1:19:50] you don't have to agree but it is the
[1:19:51] truth and so I'm taking care of my
[1:19:54] little one
[1:19:55] precious little I think she was
[1:19:58] probably seven maybe seven years old and
[1:20:03] always
[1:20:04] whining and I went to her brother and I
[1:20:06] said why why does your sister whine I
[1:20:09] don't know Grandpa she just wants
[1:20:11] attention I said that's exactly what
[1:20:13] church members do they whine because
[1:20:15] they need
[1:20:16] attention and so I said honey I said
[1:20:19] come on Grandpa wants to talk to you a
[1:20:21] minute and you know she's whimpering and
[1:20:24] whatever and I said said if there's
[1:20:26] something wrong just tell Grandpa but
[1:20:28] don't just spend the day you're you're
[1:20:30] upsetting everybody and you're not
[1:20:32] accomplishing a thing and your brothers
[1:20:34] doesn't care for it that much you
[1:20:36] probably know where I'm going to go and
[1:20:38] so she just started in good and I said
[1:20:41] I'm going to just warn you my children
[1:20:44] know one of my children are here you
[1:20:46] know I only speak one time and I said uh
[1:20:50] grandpa is just telling you right now
[1:20:53] stop doing that
[1:20:55] and of course if you were never made to
[1:20:58] mind it's just it doesn't mean a thing
[1:21:01] so I said the next time you do it I'll
[1:21:03] have to correct you it didn't mean
[1:21:06] anything so she did it again and I took
[1:21:09] her over and I applied
[1:21:14] the the rod of
[1:21:17] Moses and I got to tell you
[1:21:20] something it's hard for me to keep
[1:21:22] crying when I did that
[1:21:25] that little girl crawled up in my arms
[1:21:28] and wouldn't
[1:21:29] leave why because she saw that Grandpa
[1:21:33] loved her so much she couldn't figure
[1:21:35] all this out but all of a
[1:21:38] sudden the pain that she suffered she
[1:21:41] realized isn't it strange that I loved
[1:21:45] her and she every from then on every
[1:21:48] time she saw me she threw her arms
[1:21:49] around I don't know if she ever did to
[1:21:51] anybody else but she did to Grandpa
[1:21:53] because I applied
[1:21:55] the word and that is exactly what it is
[1:21:58] on the cliff when God applies the word
[1:22:00] in your life you want to crawl right up
[1:22:02] to him and put your arms around him
[1:22:05] brother Brown said crawl up to him today
[1:22:07] and ask him to help you then the other
[1:22:10] the other little thought I want to give
[1:22:13] this evening I'm not going to take you
[1:22:16] all the way to 9:00
[1:22:20] cuz I want to read something you know
[1:22:23] the quote
[1:22:25] my kids would get up of a morning and
[1:22:27] everyone gets up in the morning gets on
[1:22:30] my lap Rebecca a little older than Sarah
[1:22:32] and so Rebecca got up first and she run
[1:22:34] in and jumped across my leg and her legs
[1:22:37] hanging down cuz she's bigger and she
[1:22:39] put her arms around me and began to hug
[1:22:41] me and just then the smaller girl little
[1:22:44] Sarah she looked and Rebecca turned to
[1:22:46] Sarah and said
[1:22:48] Sarah I've got all of
[1:22:51] daddy there's none left for you
[1:22:55] and the little fellow the little girl
[1:22:57] puckered up to her lip to cry and I
[1:23:00] motioned to her and I put my other leg
[1:23:02] out and she come up and jumped on my
[1:23:04] other knee and I put her her arms around
[1:23:07] her and she turned those big brown
[1:23:10] eyes and looked over to Rebecca and said
[1:23:14] Rebecca you may have all of daddy but
[1:23:17] Daddy's got all of
[1:23:19] me so that's the way brother Brown said
[1:23:22] it is brother you may have all Theology
[1:23:25] and all but I want Christ to have all of
[1:23:28] me everything that I am every fiber and
[1:23:31] every bit I want him to hold me how that
[1:23:35] God does his great marvelous work he
[1:23:37] holds on because why you are with him in
[1:23:41] the Clift of the rock it wasn't just for
[1:23:43] him it was for you and it was for me
[1:23:45] without the Clift of the rock we
[1:23:46] wouldn't be here
[1:23:48] tonight
[1:23:51] Hallelujah can I read something that
[1:23:54] means a lot to me and maybe this will
[1:23:57] help you a little
[1:24:00] bit we've heard it mentioned many
[1:24:04] times we need to die to
[1:24:07] self but you know that can just be a
[1:24:09] phrase we we have to when we we die we
[1:24:13] have to do more than just say the words
[1:24:16] and act like it we actually dying is not
[1:24:20] happiness there's a sacrifice in dying
[1:24:23] it's painful
[1:24:25] you want things in your life to be
[1:24:27] better you want the church to be better
[1:24:30] more understanding and God bless your
[1:24:33] pastor to preach the things that will
[1:24:35] change lives you got to die to yourself
[1:24:39] because your own image becomes so
[1:24:41] important that you can't think of
[1:24:43] anything but yourself listen to these
[1:24:46] words written anonymously years
[1:24:49] ago when you are forgotten or
[1:24:52] neglected and you don't don't hurt with
[1:24:55] the
[1:24:56] insult but instead your heart is
[1:24:59] happy that is dying to
[1:25:02] self when your advice is
[1:25:06] disregarded your opinions ridiculed and
[1:25:09] you refuse to let anger rise in your
[1:25:12] heart and take it all in patiently
[1:25:17] loving
[1:25:19] silence that is dying to
[1:25:22] self when you're loving and and
[1:25:24] patiently bearing
[1:25:27] disorder
[1:25:29] irregularity
[1:25:30] tardiness
[1:25:32] annoyance and endure it as Jesus endured
[1:25:36] it all that's dying to
[1:25:39] self when you never care to refer to
[1:25:43] yourself in
[1:25:45] conversation or record your own good
[1:25:48] works or itch for praise after a great
[1:25:52] accomplishment
[1:25:54] when you can truly love to be
[1:25:58] unknown that is dying to
[1:26:01] self when you can see your brother or
[1:26:03] sister prosper and can honestly Rejoice
[1:26:07] with him and feel no Envy even though
[1:26:10] your needs are great that is dying to
[1:26:14] self when you are content with any
[1:26:18] food any
[1:26:19] offering any rment any climate or any
[1:26:25] society that is dying to self when you
[1:26:28] can take correction when you can humbly
[1:26:31] submit inwardly as well as outwardly
[1:26:34] with no Rebellion or resentment rising
[1:26:38] up within your heart that is dying to
[1:26:43] self this was written several years
[1:26:46] ago are you dead
[1:26:50] yet I asked this question are we all
[1:26:53] dead yet or are we hanging on to
[1:26:55] something pretty sobering isn't it have
[1:26:58] you crawled up into the cliff and have
[1:27:01] you been baed in the blood of the lamb
[1:27:04] and is it just washed you clean as white
[1:27:07] as snow or are we holding on to well but
[1:27:10] I'm important I'm
[1:27:12] something you know there was a I read a
[1:27:16] book a while many years ago
[1:27:19] feelings buried
[1:27:22] alive never die
[1:27:26] think of that
[1:27:27] feelings it's against the law to bury
[1:27:30] something that's alive but feelings
[1:27:33] buried alive they never die cuz sooner
[1:27:37] or later somebody's going to go dig them
[1:27:39] back back up again and you're going to
[1:27:41] say well I I I I just I have a hard time
[1:27:44] with that person or that thing we need
[1:27:47] to die to ourselves and bury the dead
[1:27:50] feelings and don't go back and dig them
[1:27:53] up I don't I know if this is for anybody
[1:27:55] this morning or this evening but it's
[1:27:56] for me we've got to die to self folks
[1:28:01] self dying self death and that's what
[1:28:05] happens when we go back to the Cliff of
[1:28:08] the Rock in Calvary and we say Lord
[1:28:11] Jesus forgive me you know it's a it's a
[1:28:14] pretty sobering thing when you think of
[1:28:16] we caused his crucifiction because of
[1:28:19] unbelief did you know that's what caused
[1:28:23] the cross and and and God had to had to
[1:28:26] please himself by causing the death of
[1:28:29] his son just so we could come out of him
[1:28:33] and and and actually live the whole
[1:28:37] message not just talking about it not
[1:28:39] just listening to it but living it out
[1:28:43] did you love him
[1:28:45] tonight let's
[1:28:51] stand brother Bram said the blood keeps
[1:28:54] you clean from
[1:28:57] sin because it makes a
[1:29:00] sacrifice are you willing to sacrifice
[1:29:02] your own thoughts to him tonight
[1:29:05] everything that you thought you
[1:29:08] were a lot of wonderful wonderful truths
[1:29:12] have
[1:29:13] been delivered from this Pulpit
[1:29:17] here and everybody has an opinion how it
[1:29:20] should or shouldn't apply to them but
[1:29:22] you know what brother Bram said you talk
[1:29:24] about a Revival of the Holy Ghost if we
[1:29:27] could all just understand what true
[1:29:30] death is die to
[1:29:33] ourselves crawl up into Calvary tonight
[1:29:37] say Lord forgive me I need to have
[1:29:41] another touch from you I need to have

[1:34:09] gazel and those
[1:34:11] that would run in
[1:34:13] groups and the ones that impressed me
[1:34:15] the most was the
[1:34:19] zebras because God gave him the
[1:34:22] ability to interact act with one another
[1:34:24] to where the Predators the Lions and
[1:34:26] cheetas they couldn't pick out that
[1:34:29] vulnerable one because all the stripes
[1:34:32] mixed together when they'd
[1:34:34] run so when the little fo of the
[1:34:39] zebras gets
[1:34:41] lost sometimes 10,000 zebras are running
[1:34:45] across the serengetti when they get
[1:34:48] lost it wouldn't matter if they cried
[1:34:51] out because all the little ones would be
[1:34:52] crying then
[1:34:54] do you know how they recognize their
[1:34:56] mom they were born and immediately after
[1:35:00] they're born she presses them up to her
[1:35:03] side until the stripes become imprinted
[1:35:07] on their little mind Hallelujah and
[1:35:10] that's what it needs to be tonight those
[1:35:12] stripes at Calvary needs to be imprinted
[1:35:15] on our lives that's how we know whether
[1:35:19] it's our heavenly father or not that's
[1:35:22] why they don't get lost is because
[1:35:23] they're
[1:35:25] imprinted imprint of the Holy Ghost on
[1:35:29] the
[1:35:30] believer amen God bless you and he was
[1:35:36] wounded for
[1:35:38] our
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:43] transgression and he was
[1:35:46] bruised for our iniquity
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:55] and
[1:35:57] surely he
[1:35:59] bore our
[1:36:05] sorrow and
[1:36:07] by his stri we are
[1:36:14] heal
[1:36:16] amen and the Clift of the rock hidden in
[1:36:20] the wounds of
[1:36:22] Christ so astounding to me was when our
[1:36:26] brother Jim began to point
[1:36:28] out that what brother Brenham taught us
[1:36:31] he was smitten he was a perfect
[1:36:33] Masterpiece and he so pleased God that
[1:36:35] it pleased God to Smite him amen and the
[1:36:38] smiting of Christ came out the
[1:36:39] ingredients for the bride she was in
[1:36:42] him but brother benam told us that the
[1:36:45] Masterpiece has to be returned to his
[1:36:46] side and we all knew that we heard that
[1:36:49] but what was so profound to me is how do
[1:36:52] I get back to his side
[1:36:54] what's the path back first recognizing
[1:36:57] that it was my sins that caused his
[1:37:00] smiting that it was my unbelief and my
[1:37:02] fault so the path back to his side is a
[1:37:05] path of recognition that I caused those
[1:37:08] wounds and it's repentance and humility
[1:37:11] and surrender that brings me back to the
[1:37:15] wounds that cleanse me the ones I cause
[1:37:18] are the ones that cleanse me but the
[1:37:20] only way to connect back to the
[1:37:21] cleansing power is through humility and
[1:37:24] surrender and repentance and recognizing
[1:37:26] I'm the one who put it there but that's
[1:37:28] flowing for
[1:37:30] me oh what a paradox friend it's an
[1:37:33] absolute Paradox but it struck me with
[1:37:35] so so profound it's so deep amen that
[1:37:39] it's it it's it's something for us to
[1:37:40] take away tonight yes I came from him
[1:37:43] yes I was him he was smitten so the
[1:37:45] bride could be released but she's got to
[1:37:46] be
[1:37:48] reconnected and where's where's her
[1:37:51] hidden Place back in the Cliff of the
[1:37:53] The Rock back where she came from back
[1:37:56] where he was smitten how does she get
[1:37:58] back by recognizing it's my sins that
[1:38:01] put him there it's my fault that he was
[1:38:04] wounded and if we can humbl ourselves
[1:38:06] and repent and recognize it's me then we
[1:38:11] can be brought right back to his side
[1:38:13] and cleansed from all
[1:38:17] unbelief what a what a wonderful thing
[1:38:20] the Lord Has Done amen amen
[1:38:24] I don't know about you but I want to
[1:38:26] climb up the
[1:38:28] calvary climb back to where I came from
[1:38:32] recognizing it was my
[1:38:34] fault if I can recognize it was my
[1:38:38] fault
[1:38:39] amen he can wash me white as
[1:38:43] snow and then we can remain by his side
[1:38:47] forever United with him cleansed forever
[1:38:52] amen God is good to us
[1:38:54] and we just want to say thanks to our
[1:38:55] brother Jim for yielding himself and we
[1:38:58] just appreciate a veteran who still
[1:39:01] would press the battle amen still take
[1:39:03] the sword of the word and press it drive
[1:39:05] it to the heart of the enemy amen and I
[1:39:07] appreciate that it's encouraging to me
[1:39:09] to see our brother staying in the pull
[1:39:12] pit and delivering the word amen God
[1:39:15] bless you all let's bow our heads and
[1:39:16] just thank the Lord for his word Lord

[1:39:46] it happened but Lord you've made a
