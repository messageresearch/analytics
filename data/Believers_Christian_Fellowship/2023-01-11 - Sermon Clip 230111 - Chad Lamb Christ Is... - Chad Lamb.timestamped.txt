[0:00] Moses mother convinced him that he was
[0:03] the Redeemer born a proper child
[0:06] so he had the right understanding of the
[0:09] scripture
[0:10] but yet no manifestation
[0:13] he had he had been taught intellectually
[0:17] through a mother who had told him you
[0:19] were born a proper child you were born
[0:21] at the right time and we have a
[0:23] revelation you're the Redeemer you're
[0:25] the one that's going to bring us out and
[0:27] and he believed it and he tried to act
[0:29] upon it in his own accord amen and he
[0:32] failed miserably he goes into the
[0:33] Wilderness for 40 years and then God
[0:35] comes to approach him and call him back
[0:38] into his commission amen and then he
[0:40] begins to stumble around and say he
[0:42] can't do it and he's not able and and
[0:44] there's this whole dialogue with God and
[0:46] also God doesn't have a plan B here
[0:51] so God is in dialogue with money you say
[0:54] why didn't he strike him dead because he
[0:55] doesn't have a plan B Moses is the
[0:58] Fulfillment of the scripture he is
[1:00] carrying within him the predestinated
[1:03] word for That season but it must move
[1:05] from predestinated word to manifested
[1:07] word and God has got to get Moses to
[1:11] yield to the word and when Moses yields
[1:14] to the word it moves from predestinated
[1:16] word to manifested word
[1:19] and when it's manifested word it becomes
[1:22] light and that light becomes life and a
[1:24] whole nation is saved
[1:27] perfect so we realized that Jesus Christ
[1:30] is the anointed word made manifest in
[1:32] that day
[1:36] so we
[1:38] must be like the virgin
[1:42] like Moses like John the Baptist
[1:45] I believe amen I believe that God has
[1:48] called me for this hour I believe that
[1:51] I'm part on Eternal thought of God that
[1:53] he had of me I believe that I am
[1:55] predestinated to be here in this hour
[1:57] and there's a prophecy laying in me a
[1:59] word to be fulfilled but nothing's going
[2:01] to happen until I and my own free choice
[2:04] my free moral agency lay down my life
[2:06] and surrender to the word that's been
[2:08] handed and I get baptized in his name I
[2:10] dress the way he said I talked the way
[2:12] he says I Surrender everything all my
[2:14] thoughts all my previous understanding
[2:16] of the Bible all my own wishes I lay it
[2:19] all down and I Surrender the word and
[2:21] become the manifested word by letting
[2:24] the word for the hour flow through me
[2:27] and that brings light and that brings
[2:29] life
[2:31] you can see what a hindrance it is to
[2:34] say I am to say that I'm the Bride of
[2:37] Jesus Christ but I want to cut my hair I
[2:40] want to wear jewelry I want to wear
[2:41] makeup I want to I want to join with
[2:43] systems I want to have my own way I
[2:46] still want to do a little side deal on
[2:47] the side I
[2:51] I think the brother Brandon was right in
[2:52] all these areas but
[2:56] you see what a hindrance it is
[2:58] because the predestinated word must be
[3:00] manifested word and we become the word
[3:03] when we let the word flow through us
[3:07] how do we let it flow through us being
[3:10] unto me
[3:11] according to your words
[3:13] if that's what you're calling for in
[3:15] this hour
[3:16] that's what you're going to have
[3:19] that's what I'm going to surrender to
[3:20] you
[3:21] I'm going to quit all my little deals
[3:24] I'm going to quit my associations I'm
[3:25] going to surrender my own thinking
[3:29] because the manifested word is the light
[3:33] of the hour
