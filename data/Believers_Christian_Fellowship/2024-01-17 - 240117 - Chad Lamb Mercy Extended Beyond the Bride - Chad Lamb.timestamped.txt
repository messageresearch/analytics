[16:05] Lord there was a time that you saw the
[16:07] field widen the Harvest and you knew
[16:10] there was a need for Laborers but you
[16:12] told your disciples look into the field
[16:14] now you pray to the Lord of the Harvest

[16:19] a plan but God you're calling us to see

[17:47] you all thank you
[17:48] musicians
[17:50] amen let's take our Bibles and turn to
[17:52] the Book of Matthew together Matthew
[17:55] chapter 10 just want to say God bless
[17:57] you brother Cornelius it was good to
[17:59] have you sing for us so you all got to
[18:01] meet brother Cornelius cuz he sang a
[18:02] song special amen God bless you brother
[18:05] he had a difficult Journey his journey
[18:07] was derailed and his flight was delayed
[18:10] he missed his flight to Amsterdam which
[18:12] made him uh that flight was late which
[18:14] made him miss his flight to the United
[18:16] States he had to stay the night in the
[18:18] airport catch a flight the next day he
[18:20] arrived one day late so I said oh that's
[18:23] always the precursor of good things amen
[18:26] good things are in store for our brother
[18:27] so pray for him that he gets his sleep
[18:29] and rest and has a good visit with us
[18:31] here he'll be leaving on Monday amen so
[18:34] he'll be with us for a week amen let's
[18:37] look at Matthew chap
[18:38] 10:38
[18:46] together Matthew chapter 10 verse
[18:50] 38 and he that taketh not his cross and
[18:52] follow after me is not worthy of me and
[18:55] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[18:57] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[18:59] shall find him he that receiveth you
[19:02] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[19:05] receiveth him that sent me he that
[19:07] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[19:09] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[19:11] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[19:14] the name of a righteous man shall
[19:15] receive a righteous man's reward and
[19:18] whosoever shall give to drink unto one
[19:20] of these little ones a cup of cold water
[19:22] only in the name of a disciple verily I
[19:26] say unto you he shall in no wise lose
[19:28] his reward man God bless you as you're
[19:33] seated
[19:35] amen so we're going to cover some
[19:38] familiar territory this is not
[19:40] unfamiliar and I want to do a little bit
[19:41] of teaching amen tonight but I really
[19:45] had this on my heart uh I was going to
[19:47] go into this a little bit on Sunday but
[19:49] I just felt checked and and I'd carry it
[19:51] over today and I want to preach on a
[19:53] subject called Mercy extended beyond the
[19:56] bride Mercy extended beyond the the
[19:58] bride and uh we're going to talk about
[20:01] that here for a little while uh when we
[20:03] look at Matthew here it's very
[20:06] interesting when we come to to verse 40
[20:10] he says he that receiveth you receiveth
[20:13] me what a scripture friends how many
[20:17] people want to receive
[20:18] Jesus but he said he that receiveth you
[20:21] receiveth me now all of a sudden he's
[20:24] he's he's he's doing he's giving
[20:26] something to his disciples he's giving
[20:28] something to his followers that's
[20:30] absolutely amazing he said if they
[20:32] receive you they receive me if they
[20:34] receive me they receive him that sent me
[20:37] amen what what what an amazing thing
[20:41] amen sometimes we want to go uh uh uh we
[20:43] don't know where Christ is but Christ is
[20:45] right here Among Us amen he's in a many
[20:48] membered body he said if they receive
[20:52] you he that receiveth you receiveth me
[20:56] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[20:57] sent me me he that receiveth a prophet
[21:00] in the name of a prophet shall receive a
[21:02] prophet's reward and he that receiveth a
[21:04] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[21:06] man shall receive a righteous man's
[21:08] reward now he starts talking about
[21:10] reward and the rewards are for the
[21:12] reception if they receive a prophet in
[21:15] the name of a prophet you'll receive a
[21:16] prophet's reward if you receive a
[21:18] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[21:20] man you receive a righteous man's reward
[21:22] but then he goes in down he says and
[21:24] whosoever shall give to drink unto one
[21:27] of these little ones a cup of cold water
[21:30] only in the name of a disciple it means
[21:32] just a disciple not not anybody with a a
[21:35] title just a disciple a cup of cold
[21:39] water amen verily I say unto you he
[21:42] shall in no wise lose his
[21:44] reward brother Brenham says in Elisha
[21:47] the prophet from 1956 he makes this
[21:49] statement so Jesus said if you give one
[21:52] of my disciples a cup of cold water at
[21:54] the Judgment it won't be
[21:57] forgotten we fail to see the power that
[22:00] God has placed in his
[22:02] people remember if you receive a prophet
[22:04] receive a righteous man he that
[22:07] receiveth you receiveth me all of the
[22:09] sudden amen the picture keeps getting
[22:11] clearer and clearer that we are his
[22:13] ambassadors on Earth we are his
[22:15] representation on Earth amen we are here
[22:17] to reflect his life that his life can
[22:19] live through these vessels we are flesh
[22:21] and bone of
[22:23] him now he says we fail to see the power
[22:26] that God has placed in his people
[22:28] God is in his people you believe that
[22:30] God was with his people one time when he
[22:33] walked on Earth but now God is in his
[22:35] people a little while the world sees me
[22:37] no more yet you'll see me for I personal
[22:40] pronoun now will be with you and in you
[22:42] to the end of the world God dwells moves
[22:46] Works in
[22:47] mankind amen so there's a tremendous
[22:50] blessing that goes with that let's turn
[22:52] to Genesis
[22:56] 19 we're we're going to look at this in
[22:58] a couple places here in the scriptures
[23:00] and then build on this thought like I
[23:02] said this is not a new subject we've
[23:04] been through this several times but I
[23:06] just wanted to bring it in relation to
[23:10] Mercy Genesis 19:
[23:16] 27 and in Genesis
[23:19] 19 God has told Moses that there's going
[23:22] to be a destruction of Sodom and Moses
[23:25] we we remember so clearly Moses starts
[23:28] bartering with the Lord amen to to hold
[23:31] off the destruction he starts saying but
[23:33] what if there's 50 righteous surely you
[23:35] wouldn't destroy it and God says for 50
[23:37] I won't destroy it and they start this
[23:39] bartering process amen back and forth
[23:42] and then he comes back for 40 and then
[23:43] he comes back for 30 and he keeps
[23:45] working God down amen and and and you
[23:48] you begin to look and say what an
[23:50] interesting uh set of circumstances
[23:52] Abraham is here God has told him I'm
[23:55] going to destroy Sodom and Abraham is
[23:57] now now interceding for Sodom trying to
[24:00] find a way amen for God not to destroy
[24:02] Sodom and finally God stops the
[24:05] conversation said for 20 I won't do it
[24:06] and he walks away from Abraham amen we
[24:09] know he didn't find 20 so he destroys
[24:11] Sodom but do you have to wonder what was
[24:13] Abraham interceding for and we know what
[24:16] was in Abraham's heart Abraham had his
[24:18] family in his heart he had lot and his
[24:21] family was down there in Sodom and that
[24:23] was in Abraham's heart but we get here
[24:26] to verse 19 or chapter 19: 27 and it
[24:30] said and Abraham got up early in the
[24:32] morning to the place where he stood
[24:34] before the Lord and he looked toward
[24:36] Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the
[24:38] land of the plain and behold and beheld
[24:41] and lo the smoke of the country went up
[24:44] as the smoke of a furnace and it came to
[24:47] pass when God destroyed the cities of
[24:48] the plain that God remembered Abraham
[24:52] and sent lot out of the midst of the
[24:54] overthrow when he overthrew the cities
[24:56] in which lot dwelt
[24:58] God didn't remember
[25:00] lot God remembered
[25:03] Abraham it was good that lot was
[25:06] associated with Abraham because God
[25:08] remembered Abraham and sent lot
[25:11] out amen this goes back to the this goes
[25:14] back to the quote brother B said we fail
[25:16] to see the power that God has placed in
[25:18] his people if somebody gives a cup of
[25:20] cold water and to one of these little
[25:22] ones only in the name of the disciple he
[25:24] shall not lose his reward and brother
[25:25] Benham said it won't be forgotten at the
[25:28] Judgment yes and now lot is associated
[25:32] in life with Abraham being his nephew we
[25:34] know Abraham greatly loved him we know
[25:36] after his father died he took Abraham
[25:38] along when he left his home and came
[25:40] into the promised land and we know we
[25:42] know all of that amen and and lot got
[25:44] down into Sodom and he got into that
[25:47] situation there but Abraham had a heart
[25:49] for lot and when it came to the
[25:51] destruction of Sodom God remembered
[25:54] Abraham and sent lot out
[25:58] praise be to
[26:00] God and we are Seed of Abraham by faith
[26:06] we're in the same family we're in the
[26:08] same lineage amen he is our Father
[26:11] Abraham is the father of Faith he's our
[26:13] father we're children of Abraham by
[26:15] faith amen so we're in the same
[26:19] lineage let's go to Revelations chapter
[26:22] 20 we're going to take a look at the
[26:24] white Throne judgment we're going to
[26:25] spend some
[26:26] time looking at this Revelation chapter
[26:32] 20 we're going to
[26:35] start Revelation chap 20 we're going to
[26:37] start at verse
[26:43] 6 Revelation 20 and 6 blessed blessed
[26:48] and holy is he that hath part in the
[26:50] First
[26:51] Resurrection on such the second death
[26:54] hath no power but they shall be priest
[26:56] of God and of Christ Christ and shall
[26:58] reign with him a thousand years so we
[27:00] know that the bride amen is in the first
[27:04] resurrection she comes up in the first
[27:06] resurrection amen and so the second
[27:08] death has no power over her and she'll
[27:11] be in the Millennium and she will be
[27:12] priest of God and of Christ shall reign
[27:15] with him a thousand years so she
[27:17] bypasses the judgment and will will not
[27:20] be coming up in the second Resurrection
[27:22] for the white Throne judgment she'll be
[27:24] at the white Throne judgment but she
[27:25] won't be in judgment
[27:28] we'll talk about that as well in just a
[27:30] moment so let's go down to uh uh verse
[27:33] 11 and pick up the white Throne judgment
[27:36] Revelation 2011 and I saw a great white
[27:39] throne in him that sat on it from whose
[27:41] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[27:44] and there was found no place for them
[27:47] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[27:49] before God and the books were opened and
[27:52] another book was open which is The Book
[27:54] of Life and the dead were judged out of
[27:56] those things which which were written in
[27:58] the books according to their works and
[28:00] the Sea gave up the dead which were in
[28:02] it and death and Hell delivered up the
[28:04] dead which were in them and they were
[28:06] judged every man according to their
[28:07] works and death and hell were cast into
[28:10] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[28:13] death and whosoever was not found
[28:15] written in the Book of Life was cast
[28:17] into the Lake of Fire so now we see a
[28:20] judgment being set we know this is the
[28:22] great white Throne judgment and when
[28:24] it's being said it said the books were
[28:26] open and another book which is The Book
[28:28] of Life and judgment and they're judged
[28:30] according to the things that are written
[28:32] in the books according to their
[28:35] Works amen this is not the Judgment of
[28:38] the Bride she bypass judgment amen but
[28:41] whatever is found written in the books
[28:42] and then they're judged thus and whoever
[28:45] was not found written in the Book of
[28:47] Life was cast into the Lake of Fire that
[28:50] is the white Throne judgment now we know
[28:52] the bride will never be there the the
[28:54] the C Gene of God will never be there
[28:56] let's go back to John chapter 5 and
[28:59] let's look at the reason
[29:06] why John chapter
[29:15] 5 in verse 24 John 5 and
[29:18] 24 verily verily I say unto you he that
[29:21] heareth my word and believeth on him
[29:23] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[29:26] shall not come into condemnation but is
[29:28] passed from death into life so if you've
[29:31] heard his word and Believe on him that
[29:32] sent him you already have eternal life
[29:35] and shall not come into condemnation
[29:37] this word condemnation means judgment
[29:40] when we look at the definition of the
[29:41] word it's it's translated 48 times it's
[29:45] used 48 times in the New Testament 41
[29:48] times it's translated
[29:50] judgment 41 out of 48 so it means
[29:53] judgment amen you shall not come into
[29:56] judgment but you've already already
[29:57] passed from death and the life there is
[29:59] nothing to judge in the bride she
[30:01] bypasses judgment she doesn't have to
[30:03] stand judgment why because she was
[30:05] judged in Christ at Calvary when the
[30:07] word was judged she's part of the
[30:10] word Amen brother B said uh uh he made
[30:13] me pay for my sins when I was in him at
[30:17] Calvary amen because she's part of the
[30:19] word amen she bypasses judgment so if
[30:22] you hear his word and Believe on him
[30:23] that sent him you already have
[30:25] everlasting life and you'll never come
[30:27] into the Judgment for you've already
[30:29] passed from Death un life so we know
[30:32] we're secure amen we're absolutely
[30:34] secure we were secure before the
[30:35] foundation of the world it's just coming
[30:37] to manifestation in this day as we
[30:39] receive the word it's coming to
[30:42] manifestation but now we want to talk
[30:44] about Mercy being extended beyond the
[30:47] bride last time we talked about brother
[30:49] B said hey you can never exhaust God's
[30:52] goodness and mercy to his
[30:54] people but we know that we we we see we
[30:57] want to look at there there's Mercy
[30:59] extended even beyond the realm of the
[31:01] Bride there's going to be more Mercy
[31:03] extended and that's what I get excited
[31:05] about
[31:06] friends Romans chapter 8 let's look
[31:09] together
[31:13] there Romans chapter
[31:19] 8 verse 1 Romans 8
[31:23] And1 said there is therefore now no
[31:27] Nation to them which are in Christ Jesus
[31:29] who walk not after the flesh but after
[31:32] the Spirit by spiritual New Birth and
[31:35] now now you're not walking after the
[31:36] flesh you're walking after the spirit
[31:38] and there is no condemnation that's same
[31:40] thing judgment there is no judgment to
[31:43] them who are in Christ Jesus I thank God
[31:46] for that that's God's grace to us but
[31:50] now let's start looking at everyone else
[31:54] amen let's go to Matthew
[31:56] 25 Matthew 25 is another scene of the
[32:00] white Throne
[32:02] judgment we looked at it in Revelation
[32:05] 20 now we're going to look at it in
[32:07] Matthew
[32:09] 25 now remember that Judgment at the
[32:12] white Throne judgment after the second
[32:14] Resurrection when all the dead amen
[32:16] stand before him both small and great
[32:19] and they're judged the books are open in
[32:21] another book and they're judged out of
[32:22] the books according to the things
[32:23] written therein and then we we look here
[32:26] at verse 31 which is a a a parable about
[32:31] the white Throne
[32:32] judgment so Matthew
[32:35] 25:31 when the son of man shall come in
[32:38] his glory and all the Holy Angels with
[32:40] him then shall he sit upon the throne of
[32:42] his glory and before him shall be
[32:44] gathered all nations and he shall
[32:46] separate them one from another as a
[32:49] Shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[32:51] goats and he shall set the Sheep on the
[32:54] right hand but the goats on the left
[32:56] then shall the King say unto them on his
[32:58] right hand Come Ye blessed of my father
[33:01] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[33:02] from the foundation of the world for I
[33:05] was hungered and you gave me meat I was
[33:07] thirsty and you gave me drink I was
[33:10] stranger and you took me in naked and
[33:13] you clothed me I was sick and you
[33:15] visited me I was in prison and you came
[33:17] unto me then shall the righteous answer
[33:20] him saying Lord when saw we thee a
[33:23] hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave
[33:24] thee drink when saw we thee a stranger
[33:28] and took thee in or naked and clothed
[33:29] thee or when saw we thee sick or in
[33:32] prison and came unto thee and the King
[33:36] shall answer and say unto them verily
[33:38] verily I say unto you in so much as ye
[33:41] have done unto one of the least of these
[33:44] my brethren you have done it unto me
[33:47] then shall he say also unto them on the
[33:49] left hand depart from me ye cursed un
[33:51] Everlasting fire depart for the devil uh
[33:54] prepared for the devil and his angels
[33:57] for I was a hungered and you gave me no
[33:58] meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[34:00] drink I was a stranger and you took me
[34:02] not in naked and you clothed me not sick
[34:05] and impr prison and you visited me not
[34:07] then shall they also answer him saying
[34:09] Lord when saw we thee a hunger or a
[34:12] thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or
[34:14] in prison and did not Minister unto thee
[34:16] then shall he answer them saying verily
[34:18] I say unto you in as much as you did it
[34:21] not to one of the least of these you did
[34:23] it not to me and these shall go away and
[34:26] to Everlasting punishment but the
[34:29] righteous unto life
[34:32] eternal this is also the white Throne
[34:36] judgment brother brandham in the sardan
[34:39] church age section of the church age
[34:41] book he refers to this and he and he
[34:43] makes this statement said to further
[34:45] clarify notice specifically the words of
[34:47] Matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that
[34:51] the shepherd is literally separating
[34:53] sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd
[34:56] so let's go back and look at that verse
[35:00] 32 and before him shall be gathered all
[35:03] nations and he shall separate them one
[35:05] from another as a Shepherd divideth his
[35:08] sheep from the goats Amen brother I I
[35:12] love the gift of a prophet he can hone
[35:13] down on the word and he can tell you
[35:15] amen any misunderstanding because he
[35:17] doesn't want you to misunderstand this
[35:19] can't be the separating of sheep and
[35:21] goats because the Sheep are the Sheep of
[35:23] his pasture they're the righteous
[35:24] they're the redeemed they're the bride
[35:27] so this can't be them there in the
[35:29] Judgment but he's separating them as a
[35:31] Shepherd separating he's just showing
[35:34] why how he's doing it he's doing it as a
[35:36] she Shepherd would separate these two
[35:38] he's not calling them sheep and
[35:41] goats oh my goodness I love that God
[35:44] sent a prophet who knows the author of
[35:46] the word and could look down at that
[35:48] because you and I can debate that we can
[35:50] look at language we can look at Greek we
[35:52] can fight back and forth on what that
[35:54] means but when a prophet comes down he's
[35:56] got the mind of God on the word and he
[35:58] he points right to it and it's exactly
[36:00] as it's
[36:02] written Amen brother frankco if you
[36:04] could pull up the Whiteboard I want to I
[36:06] want to draw this out on the
[36:07] Whiteboard he he says I I'll read this
[36:11] again it does not say that that a
[36:13] Shepherd is literally separating sheep
[36:15] from goats but it is as a shepherd and
[36:17] that's capital as in the church age book
[36:20] as a shepher dividing sheep from goats
[36:22] these are not sheep in this particular
[36:24] area of time white Throne judgment the
[36:26] Sheep are in his fold they heard his
[36:29] voice the word and they followed him
[36:32] they already have eternal life and
[36:34] cannot come into the Judgment but these
[36:37] do not have eternal
[36:41] life it's beautiful friends and they are
[36:45] in the Judgment they're in the Judgment
[36:47] because they don't have eternal life
[36:49] amen the bride cannot come into the
[36:51] Judgment because she has eternal life
[36:54] where did she get it before the
[36:55] foundation of the world when she was in
[36:57] the mind of God the SE Gene of God
[36:59] inside has life on the inside amen
[37:02] because she heard his word and believed
[37:05] on him that sent him she already have
[37:07] everlasting life it was the evidence she
[37:09] already had
[37:10] it so she cannot come in the Judgment
[37:13] but these do not have eternal life they
[37:16] are in the
[37:17] Judgment then he says they are allowed
[37:20] to go into eternal
[37:23] life oh I love this friends the
[37:25] righteous are all to go into eternal
[37:28] life why they didn't already have it
[37:30] amen they weren't listen they didn't
[37:33] have the C Gene of God they didn't have
[37:35] life already inside of them they didn't
[37:37] have it brother B says they were never
[37:39] born
[37:41] again amen but they're allowed to enter
[37:44] into eternal life amen and when they
[37:46] enter into eternal life this is at the
[37:48] end of the Thousand Years this is after
[37:51] the Millennium this is at the white
[37:52] Throne judgment this is the ending of
[37:54] all time from here on out we move into
[37:57] new heavens and new earth and there is
[37:59] no more time it's back to Eternity and
[38:01] I'll ask you a question if you get
[38:03] entrance into eternal life and you get
[38:06] life that goes beyond time now there's
[38:08] no more time but you're alive what kind
[38:11] of life is
[38:13] that you've entered into eternal life
[38:16] you don't have it on the inside but by
[38:19] the grace of God by his Mercy he's
[38:21] allowed you to come into it and now
[38:23] you're in there you have Life Beyond
[38:25] Time
[38:27] am praise be to God why do we get
[38:31] excited cuz this doesn't this doesn't
[38:33] matter to us amen because we already had
[38:35] it we always had it we could have never
[38:37] lost it oh but friends amen we want to
[38:40] see Mercy extended we want to see those
[38:42] whom we love come into eternal life
[38:46] that's why we get so excited about this
[38:48] amen that's why amen I I I I I've
[38:51] preached this before and I get really
[38:54] really thankful in my heart because
[38:57] this message actually declares the very
[38:59] nature of God in his true
[39:02] righteousness amen the denominations all
[39:04] have their own ideas about salvation and
[39:06] you have to have it their way and if you
[39:08] don't come their way everybody else is
[39:10] damned to hell and but oh my goodness
[39:13] this message comes along and begins to
[39:14] show God's loving nature his Tender
[39:17] Mercies and his desire to
[39:20] save it reflects his true
[39:23] nature so when we come to to the white
[39:27] Throne
[39:28] judgment let's just do it this way let's
[39:32] just say we have a
[39:34] throne Before the
[39:37] Throne there's two sections because he's
[39:40] going to separate
[39:42] them as
[39:45] sheep on I want to read this and make
[39:47] sure I get right because if I draw it
[39:49] wrong I'm going to be in
[39:54] trouble okay the Sheep sheep on his
[39:57] right hand and the goats on his left so
[39:59] he would be facing them this would be
[40:02] the
[40:05] righteous on his right
[40:08] hand so over here you've got all these
[40:13] people multitudes of people over here
[40:16] you got multitudes of
[40:18] people so when you look at this it looks
[40:22] like you have these that will be eternal
[40:32] lost and then you have the
[40:36] King on the throne and you say well
[40:39] we've got three categories of people but
[40:41] actually according to scripture we have
[40:43] four categories of people because the
[40:46] king is not alone on the throne beside
[40:48] the king is the
[40:52] [Music]
[40:53] queen God Amen when Jesus begins to
[40:57] speak here in the parable he says unto
[40:59] them verse 34 then shall the king say
[41:03] that's one
[41:05] person to them on his right hand to the
[41:08] to the righteous come you blessed of my
[41:10] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[41:11] you from the foundation of the world and
[41:13] we know he speaks to the ones on the
[41:15] left hand those that will be lost and he
[41:17] tells them they didn't take care of him
[41:18] they didn't look after him they didn't
[41:19] serve him so that's we got the ones on
[41:22] the right the ones on the left and the
[41:23] King on the throne but listen to what he
[41:25] says
[41:27] he says I was hungered and he starts to
[41:29] say I was hungered I was naked you
[41:31] clothed me I was in prison you visited
[41:33] me and they
[41:37] asked uh then they then they asked uh in
[41:41] verse 38 I mean verse 37 then shall the
[41:44] righteous answer him saying Lord when
[41:45] saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and
[41:47] thirsty and gave thee drink when they
[41:49] didn't even know when they did it
[41:52] they're standing here looking at the
[41:53] king and he's saying you fed me you you
[41:56] clothed me you visited me you you served
[41:59] me and they said Lord when they they
[42:02] never saw that figure they never serve
[42:05] that figure if you understand what I'm
[42:07] saying they they're confused about how
[42:09] they fed him and how they clothed him
[42:11] and how they visited him but then he
[42:13] makes a statement he and he says and the
[42:16] King shall answer verse 40 and the King
[42:18] shall answer and say unto them verily I
[42:20] say to you as much as you have done it
[42:22] unto one of the least of these my
[42:24] brethren you have done it to me that's
[42:27] the fourth group that's the mystery
[42:29] group at the white Throne judgment
[42:31] everybody else is uh uh defined and
[42:33] easily said the one on the right the one
[42:35] on the left and the King on the throne
[42:37] but he reveals a mystery group at the
[42:40] white Throne judgment he says when you
[42:42] have done it to these these my brethren
[42:45] that are sitting here on the throne with
[42:47] me then you did it unto
[42:50] me oh it's always been the mystery group
[42:54] the bride's been the mystery through the
[42:56] the whole Bible she's been the mystery
[42:58] group and still in the white Throne
[42:59] judgment she's the mystery group but a
[43:01] prophet has come and revealed the
[43:04] mystery who this mystery group is it's
[43:06] the bride and she is judging with the
[43:10] King praise
[43:12] God oh I love that I'm going to keep
[43:16] reading
[43:17] here these do not have eternal life
[43:20] that's why it says the dead were
[43:23] judged this is the Judgment of the Dead
[43:27] and it seems wrong to think that the
[43:29] foolish virgin and and and the righteous
[43:31] that but they don't already have eternal
[43:34] life so this is the Judgment of the Dead
[43:36] But at the end of the Judgment of the
[43:38] Dead there'll be a group that go into
[43:40] eternal life and a group that go to the
[43:42] lake of
[43:43] fire but these do not have eternal life
[43:46] and they are in the Judgment they are
[43:47] allowed to go into eternal life but upon
[43:50] what grounds do they enter into life
[43:51] eternal certainly not upon the fact that
[43:54] they already had his life as does the
[43:56] bride but they receive it because they
[43:59] were kind to his
[44:01] Brethren that's the scripture they are
[44:04] not his Brethren that would make them
[44:06] joint hirs with Jesus they are not heirs
[44:09] to anything but life they share No
[44:11] Throne Etc with him their names must
[44:13] have been in the Book of Life and not
[44:16] removed now because of their love of the
[44:19] people of God they are recognized and
[44:21] saved no doubt these served and helped
[44:24] the children of God per perhaps like
[44:26] Nicodemus and gelo they stood for the
[44:29] children in a time of trouble that's
[44:32] super interesting we'll come back to
[44:34] that if this seems the smack of
[44:37] restoration watch carefully now for the
[44:39] wicked are not restored but turned into
[44:42] the Lake of Fire the names of many of
[44:43] those destroyed were in The Book of Life
[44:45] also but they were blotted out because
[44:48] they failed to honor the people of God
[44:51] who were the Living manifested Word
[44:54] living Epistles for their day
[44:56] amen all right we're getting some really
[45:00] good principles laid down
[45:02] now their names were blotted out others
[45:06] names remained in The Book of Life they
[45:09] went into eternal life on what grounds
[45:12] because they were good and kind to the
[45:14] Brethren
[45:16] amen the other group didn't serve Christ
[45:20] didn't feed him didn't clothe him
[45:24] didn't they didn't serve him
[45:26] him and it says they were blotted out
[45:29] because they failed to honor the people
[45:31] of God who were the Living manifested
[45:35] Word living Epistles for their
[45:38] day when it comes down to the Judgment
[45:42] it's actually all about the
[45:45] word it's all about the the judgment is
[45:48] all about the
[45:50] word amen when he says you did it to the
[45:52] least of these my brethren it wasn't it
[45:55] it wasn't about being nice to be nice
[45:57] and nice to it's not about flesh friends
[46:00] it's about the manifested word that was
[46:02] manifesting in that body of Flesh at
[46:04] that period of time it's not a judgment
[46:07] based on flesh it's a judgment based on
[46:10] the
[46:11] word what they did with the word they
[46:14] came in contact with is how they're
[46:16] judged here at the white Throne
[46:18] judgment and because they failed to
[46:20] honor the people of God who were the
[46:22] Living manifested Word living Epistles
[46:24] for their day I think interesting too
[46:26] that that that that uh oh my goodness I
[46:32] think it's very interesting that he
[46:34] mentions Nicodemus and Gia here because
[46:36] they're he he's using them as examples
[46:38] of those who would serve God's people
[46:40] maybe in a time of trouble amen maybe
[46:43] they would stand up for them maybe they
[46:44] would Supply a need maybe they would
[46:46] would meet a need like feeding when
[46:48] they're hungry clothing when they're
[46:49] naked you see you see what we're saying
[46:51] here in Matthew 25 and you go to realize
[46:54] that God would have wrote names in the
[46:56] book of life because he knows that he
[46:59] would have a need somewhere down the
[47:01] road when he was coming in the flesh of
[47:04] Bob and the Flesh of Chad and the Flesh
[47:06] of this there may be a need down the
[47:08] road so he would write a name in The
[47:10] Book of Life and somebody would meet the
[47:12] need of the word made flesh at a time
[47:16] amen and for that they would get
[47:18] entrance into eternal
[47:20] life it's all about the word it's all
[47:24] about the word
[47:26] all right let's go to Genesis chapter
[47:28] 20 I want to keep laying this principle
[47:31] down we're going to go back to
[47:41] Abraham Genesis
[47:50] 20 and verse one Genesis 20 and verse
[47:54] one this is
[47:57] after Abraham and Sarah are turned back
[48:00] young and they travel down to Gar and
[48:02] Sarah is now beautiful and young and uh
[48:05] aimc takes her for a wife we know the
[48:08] story really well but we're going to
[48:10] read it again in this
[48:12] context uh chapter 20:1 and Abraham
[48:15] journeyed from then toward the South
[48:17] Country and dwelt between Kadesh and
[48:19] shur and sojourned in gar and Abraham
[48:22] said of Sarah his wife she is my sister
[48:25] and ab that king of gar sent and took
[48:26] Sarah but God came to aimc in a Dream by
[48:30] night and said to him behold Thou Art
[48:33] but a dead man for the woman which thou
[48:35] Hast taken for she is a man's wife but
[48:38] aimc had not come near her and he said
[48:40] Lord wilt thou slay also a righteous
[48:42] Nation said said he not unto me she is
[48:45] my sister and she even she herself said
[48:48] he is my brother in the Integrity of my
[48:51] heart and innocency of my hands have I
[48:53] done this and God said unto him in a
[48:55] dream yay I know that thou did this in
[48:58] the Integrity of thy heart for I also
[49:01] withheld thee from sinning against me
[49:03] therefore suffered I Thee not to touch
[49:05] her now therefore restore the man his
[49:08] wife for he is a prophet and he shall
[49:10] pray for thee and and and thou shalt
[49:12] live and if thou restore her not know
[49:15] thou that that know that know thou that
[49:19] thou shalt surely die thou and all that
[49:22] are thine lot of THS there
[49:29] aimc is not doing anything
[49:32] wrong and he takes Sarah because of what
[49:36] Abraham told him and then we know
[49:38] Abraham's protecting himself and and now
[49:41] he's going to take Sarah but God in his
[49:45] Mercy comes to not a c Gene not what
[49:51] Abraham is but somebody else amen and he
[49:55] comes down to aimc and he warns him in a
[50:00] dream don't do this and aimc says Lord
[50:03] you know the Integrity of my heart I I
[50:07] didn't know and I want to read it again
[50:11] here and verse six and God said unto him
[50:14] in a dream yay I know that thou did this
[50:17] in the Integrity of thy
[50:20] heart God knew that aimc was not doing
[50:24] this on purpose
[50:26] God knew he me he had no ill intentions
[50:28] to Abraham he was not trying to defile
[50:31] another man's wife that he says would
[50:33] you do would you treat the righteous
[50:35] that way is basically what he's saying
[50:37] and God says no I know the Integrity of
[50:39] your heart that's why I warned you in a
[50:41] dream oh I love the righteousness of
[50:46] God
[50:48] Amen but he says
[50:52] uh so he says I know we're in verse six
[50:55] still and I know that thou did this in
[50:57] the Integrity of thine heart I also
[50:59] withheld thee from sinning against
[51:09] me amen I thought he would be sinning
[51:13] against Abraham by taking Abraham's wife
[51:15] as another man no I kept you from
[51:16] sinning against me this is my word
[51:20] Abraham's my word Sarah is my word amen
[51:23] and there's going to come A Promise
[51:25] something through them they're fleshing
[51:26] out my word my mind is on display here
[51:29] in these two and I had to keep you from
[51:31] sinning against me because you're
[51:34] righteous and you had Integrity in your
[51:36] heart and you're pure in heart and you
[51:38] didn't do this on purpose and I know
[51:40] that but I I come to you to warn you so
[51:43] that you wouldn't sin against
[51:45] me now restore that man as wife so so
[51:49] aimc wakes up and he knows exactly what
[51:52] he's got to do let's go down to verse 14
[51:54] now and ailec took sheep and oxen and
[51:57] men's servants and woman servants and
[51:59] gave them unto Abraham and restored him
[52:02] Sarah his wife and aimc said behold my
[52:05] land is before thee dwell there where it
[52:08] pleaseth thee and unto Sarah he said
[52:11] behold I have given thy brother a
[52:13] thousand pieces of silver behold he is
[52:15] to thee a covering of the eyes and to
[52:17] all that are with thee and with all
[52:19] other thus she was reproved so Abraham
[52:22] prayed unto God and God healed aim and
[52:25] his wife and his maid servants and they
[52:27] bear children for the Lord had fast
[52:29] closed up all the wombs of the House of
[52:31] ailec because of Sarah Abraham's
[52:35] wife oh praise God now aimc does the
[52:40] best thing he can he doesn't just say
[52:42] here's your wife he said here's some
[52:44] oxen here's some sheep here's the here's
[52:46] some gifts here's a thousand pieces of
[52:48] silver and here's the land go anywhere
[52:50] you
[52:51] want because now he realizes what
[52:54] Abraham is in relation to God Amen and
[52:57] what he needs to do now is bless Abraham
[53:00] so that Abraham can bless him so that he
[53:02] can be
[53:03] blessed you know aimc wasn't wrong amen
[53:07] we we know Abraham in this situation
[53:09] Abraham was wrong but Abraham cannot
[53:12] come into condemnation he cannot come
[53:14] into the Judgment because of who he is
[53:16] amen but aimc amen will be in judgment
[53:19] if he makes this mistake so God has to
[53:22] spare him and show him mercy and now
[53:24] he's got to go to who who does he go to
[53:27] to be spared who does he go to to find
[53:30] this Mercy who does he go to amen he has
[53:32] to go to
[53:35] Abraham and Abraham now prays for him
[53:38] when Abraham prayed the Judgment of God
[53:40] was already upon him because he had
[53:42] already closed up the wombs amen but now
[53:44] when when Abraham who who should be the
[53:47] guilty one but now when Abraham prays
[53:50] God hears Abraham's prayer and he
[53:52] reverses the curse and he opens up the
[53:54] wound yes
[53:57] sir you see this is not just a new
[53:59] testament principle this is the entire
[54:01] Bible amen now where brother Brandon
[54:04] when he sees this clear he sees this
[54:06] through the whole scripture and he sees
[54:08] it through the context of God's
[54:11] [Applause]
[54:13] nature praise
[54:16] God
[54:18] Amen
[54:20] so
[54:22] oh God help us give us eyes to
[54:27] see
[54:29] Abraham
[54:30] becomes to
[54:33] aimc life or
[54:37] death depending on how he deals with
[54:42] Abraham in this
[54:44] situation Abraham is standing
[54:48] there and aimc is in
[54:52] judgment and which way it's going to
[54:55] fall life or
[54:57] death depends on his attitude towards
[55:03] Abraham and Abraham's intercession for
[55:10] him are we seeing the picture sir and we
[55:14] are Seed of
[55:19] Abraham again in the sardian church age
[55:22] Prophet says thus if God has so designed
[55:25] that there be those whose names are
[55:27] placed in a section of the Lamb's Book
[55:29] of Life and cannot be erased for they
[55:32] are the names of his bride then we must
[55:34] accept that I accept
[55:38] it if it is also states that there are
[55:40] those whose names were placed in the
[55:42] record of the book of life but in the
[55:44] for knowledge of God they were to fall
[55:46] and have their names removed we must
[55:48] accept that and if there are those whose
[55:50] names were never placed upon a record of
[55:52] life we must accept that also and and if
[55:55] there are those who will enter into life
[55:57] eternal after the white Throne judgment
[56:00] solely yes you got that word solely
[56:02] right solely on the grounds of being
[56:05] good and kind and just to the elect of
[56:07] God who are his Brethren then we cannot
[56:10] but accept that for who knoweth the mind
[56:13] of the Lord that he should instruct him
[56:16] rather let us be subject in faith to him
[56:18] who is our father and
[56:21] live amen I'm going to take a little
[56:24] turn a little deviation and we'll come
[56:25] back let's go to Revelation 21 and I
[56:28] think we'll find that it's no deviation
[56:29] at
[56:32] all Revelation
[56:34] 21 all the way back at the end of the
[56:38] Bible Revelation
[56:42] 21 and verse
[56:48] 23 ver uh Revelation 21 and 23 and the
[56:52] city had no need of sun neither of moon
[56:54] to shine in it for the glory of God did
[56:56] lighten it and the lamb was the light
[56:58] thereof and the nations of them which
[57:00] are saved shall walk in the light of it
[57:03] and the kings of the earth do bring
[57:04] their Glory and Honor into it and the
[57:07] gates of it shall not be shut At All by
[57:09] day for there shall be no night
[57:12] there and they shall bring the glor they
[57:15] and they shall bring the glory and honor
[57:18] of the Nations into
[57:20] it praise
[57:22] God I I I just want to look at this for
[57:26] a
[57:27] minute in verse 24 and the nations of
[57:30] them which are saved shall walk in the
[57:31] light that is not the elect that's not
[57:34] the bride that's everybody else who
[57:37] entered in to life and through the white
[57:40] thr
[57:41] judgment and brother B says this in the
[57:43] Philadelphian Church age he says the
[57:45] city he goes ahead and says which is New
[57:47] Jerusalem see New Jerusalem I'll put on
[57:50] him the New Jerusalem now the bride or
[57:53] the church is the new jerus
[57:55] Jerusalem so who is this city it's the
[57:58] elect amen and now the light that's
[58:01] going to shine is going to shine from
[58:03] the city in the New Jerusalem how many
[58:07] knows that the church itself is the New
[58:09] Jerusalem let's prove it in Revelation
[58:12] 21 amen he's going to say here now I
[58:16] think it's where I want all right let's
[58:18] look back here and show you the Bible
[58:20] says prove all things Revelations
[58:23] 21 and I saw a new heavens and a new
[58:25] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[58:27] Earth were passed away and there was no
[58:29] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[58:31] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[58:33] out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[58:36] adorned for her
[58:37] husband amen it's the new church the
[58:40] Gentile Church the bride the bride is
[58:43] the Gentile and the Gentile has his name
[58:46] he took a people out of the Gentile for
[58:48] his name's sake and he says he's going
[58:49] to put on them brother R dealing with
[58:51] the name of the city of his God the New
[58:53] Jerusalem amen so now he says now this
[58:56] city is as a bride adorned for her
[58:58] husband brother B says it is the bride
[59:01] the city is the elect we know there'll
[59:04] be a physical City so don't think I'm
[59:05] getting away from that and the new
[59:07] heavens and new earth we know that
[59:08] physical City will come and sit over top
[59:10] the mountain that'll rise up amen but
[59:12] that City now is the dwelling place of
[59:14] God where the temple of God
[59:16] is and all of these that are saved to
[59:19] the Earth they're going to come to the
[59:20] city they're going to walk in the light
[59:22] of the city and they're going to come
[59:24] through the Gates of the city amen and
[59:26] they're going to have access into this
[59:28] city amen and they're going to bring the
[59:31] honor of the Nations into the city we'll
[59:34] get to that later now let's look at
[59:36] chapter
[59:40] 22:1 and he showed me a pure River of
[59:43] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[59:46] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[59:48] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[59:51] of it on either side of the river was
[59:52] there the Tree of Life which bear 12
[59:55] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[59:57] every month and the leaves of the tree
[59:59] were for the healing of the Nations this
[1:00:02] tree is in the
[1:00:03] city in New
[1:00:06] Jerusalem and this tree we've talked
[1:00:09] about it many times so you understand
[1:00:10] this well this tree is the tree of life
[1:00:13] and it's growing on either side of the
[1:00:16] river so when you look there's a tree on
[1:00:20] either side of the river but it's one
[1:00:22] tree of life it looks like two trees
[1:00:25] because the tree is on either side of
[1:00:26] the river the river is Flowing between
[1:00:28] it amen but this is male and female
[1:00:30] bridegroom and brid tree come back
[1:00:33] together again and so brother B says now
[1:00:37] remember he is that tree of life
[1:00:39] contrary to the serpent seed you see he
[1:00:42] is the seed the woman's seed the Tree of
[1:00:44] Life In The Garden unless they put forth
[1:00:46] their hands and move this tree theyd eat
[1:00:48] that tree and live forever and he's the
[1:00:51] only tree that can be taken that you can
[1:00:53] live forever his word is life and that
[1:00:56] be the word then the word of God which
[1:00:59] Eve turned down in the garden even of
[1:01:01] Eden then here is Christ the word made
[1:01:05] manifest and when he come on Earth he
[1:01:07] was the Tree of Life do you believe that
[1:01:10] in Rome what did they do he had to be
[1:01:13] chopped down and he was put on a tree of
[1:01:14] disgrace cursed is he that hang on a
[1:01:16] tree he became a curse for the human
[1:01:19] race and now through that he brings
[1:01:21] forth a brid tree which will be the tree
[1:01:24] of life restored back to him what will
[1:01:27] the what will the bride tree the Tree of
[1:01:29] Life restored back to him again as
[1:01:32] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[1:01:34] oh glory be to God by the same word the
[1:01:37] same God made manifest in husband and
[1:01:39] wife the same bride tree back again so
[1:01:43] what's he doing in this day he's
[1:01:44] bringing forth the bride tree and he's
[1:01:46] uniting the bride tree and the
[1:01:48] bridegroom tree because brother bam said
[1:01:50] the bridegroom tree without the bride
[1:01:51] tree doesn't produce fruit so now we see
[1:01:56] the tree of life amen is on either side
[1:01:58] of the river and they're standing there
[1:02:00] together with the River of Life coming
[1:02:02] from the Throne of God right in between
[1:02:05] them it's coming out and this tree Bears
[1:02:07] 12 manner of fruit in its season and the
[1:02:10] leaves of this tree are for the healing
[1:02:12] of the
[1:02:13] Nations and here's what brother brm says
[1:02:15] in future home he says the leaves will
[1:02:18] be for the healing of the Nations that
[1:02:20] is the kings that live in there bring
[1:02:22] their honor in when they bring their
[1:02:24] honor in and Lay It Before the Throne of
[1:02:26] God just like the outside the 11 tribes
[1:02:29] brought in every one of them a tenth to
[1:02:30] Levi when they bring their honor uh into
[1:02:34] the Blessed Land from the Blessed land
[1:02:36] in that they'll reach from the Tree of
[1:02:38] Life break off a holly leaf or a tree of
[1:02:41] life leaf and they'll walk out together
[1:02:43] there's no more war everything's at
[1:02:45] peace the leaves are a memorial for the
[1:02:47] healing of the
[1:02:51] Nations brother Chad what are you
[1:02:53] talking about
[1:02:55] We're Here There and
[1:02:57] Everywhere
[1:02:59] Abraham was standing there as a tree of
[1:03:02] life yes that's
[1:03:07] right to reject that tree was to reject
[1:03:13] life aimc was in trouble because of what
[1:03:16] he was going to do with the word made
[1:03:20] manifest but there was an opportunity
[1:03:23] for aimc
[1:03:25] if he would restore if he would restore
[1:03:27] the man's wife and have that man pray
[1:03:31] for
[1:03:32] him Abraham became a source of
[1:03:36] restoration and a source of life for
[1:03:38] ailec because aimc was as good as a dead
[1:03:40] man if it wasn't for
[1:03:45] Abraham Amen in the new heavens and new
[1:03:47] earth what's going on in the new heavens
[1:03:50] and new earth there's a Perpetual life
[1:03:52] there's a healing and there's a peace
[1:03:55] amen there's life beyond time and what
[1:03:57] are they doing with this life all of
[1:04:00] those who live outside of the city all
[1:04:02] of the Nations and all the kings what
[1:04:04] are they doing in this life they are
[1:04:06] Gathering From The Blessed land all
[1:04:08] outside the city and they're bringing
[1:04:10] their tithe they're bringing their honor
[1:04:12] into the City and when they bring their
[1:04:14] honor into the city now they go over and
[1:04:17] in exchange for coming into the city and
[1:04:20] bringing their honor and Glory into the
[1:04:22] city they reach over and they break off
[1:04:25] a a tree a leaf from the tree of life
[1:04:27] and they walk out in peace because the
[1:04:29] leaves are for the healing of the
[1:04:32] Nations there's an exchange taking place
[1:04:35] what's to exchange they're serving those
[1:04:37] in the city with their tithe and they're
[1:04:39] getting life from the city from the Tree
[1:04:41] of Life why is this going on in the new
[1:04:43] heavens and new earth CU this is exactly
[1:04:45] how they got there they got there by
[1:04:49] serving the word amen when the word amen
[1:04:52] whether it was in print form or whether
[1:04:53] it came in flesh and you and I are are
[1:04:56] the Saints down through time are like
[1:04:57] Abraham when they served the word amen
[1:05:00] they were blessed to enter in amen
[1:05:02] because why because you fed me when I
[1:05:04] was hungry you clothed me when I was
[1:05:05] naked you visited me when I was in
[1:05:07] prison enter you into the joys of the
[1:05:10] Lord when did we do this Lord when I
[1:05:13] don't I didn't recognize you I didn't
[1:05:15] see you I didn't know I when you've done
[1:05:16] it to these why because these are also
[1:05:19] this is the Tree of Life restored from
[1:05:21] the Garden of Eden this is bridegroom
[1:05:23] tree and brid tree back together again
[1:05:26] sitting on the throne and they'll be in
[1:05:28] that City and all those who enter in
[1:05:30] will be perpetually coming and bringing
[1:05:32] tithe into the city for exchange for
[1:05:36] Life
[1:05:38] Hallelujah the reason they got there is
[1:05:42] perpetuated through
[1:05:46] eternity now think about that think
[1:05:50] about Abraham standing there as a tree
[1:05:52] of life for
[1:05:55] aimc Jesus Christ was standing there the
[1:05:57] tree of
[1:05:59] life for all of Israel and they refused
[1:06:03] life and they scorched it and they cut
[1:06:05] it down they hung it on a
[1:06:11] cross when Jesus comes or brother Ram
[1:06:14] comes to the message that day on Calvary
[1:06:16] he says now what must we do now the
[1:06:18] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[1:06:20] lived for
[1:06:21] himself his life was spent for others
[1:06:24] that's perfectly eternal
[1:06:26] life when you say you go to church and
[1:06:29] you do good things that's fine but when
[1:06:31] you live your life to yourself you have
[1:06:33] an eternal life eternal life is living
[1:06:35] for
[1:06:37] others it proved it when he came in the
[1:06:40] and the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:06:42] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:06:44] himself he lived for others and you
[1:06:46] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:06:48] day and you don't live for yourself no
[1:06:51] more you live for others
[1:06:55] okay let's go back to the white Throne
[1:06:57] judgment and go back to Matthew

[1:07:04] hungry you clothed me when I was naked
[1:07:08] you visited me when I was in
[1:07:12] prison now you enter
[1:07:16] in Lord when do we do that when you did
[1:07:18] it to these now you enter into
[1:07:22] life there'll be people entering into
[1:07:26] life because the word was made
[1:07:31] flesh because the elect C genene of God
[1:07:35] was on Earth in that period of time and
[1:07:38] because they were
[1:07:40] there somebody served them yes and when
[1:07:44] somebody was good and kind to the
[1:07:46] Brethren they went into eternal
[1:07:50] life do you realize that's you and me
[1:07:52] friends
[1:07:54] do you realize we
[1:07:57] stand I'm going to say something but
[1:07:59] please understand what I'm saying do you
[1:08:01] understand we stand as a tree of
[1:08:04] life we stand as an opportunity for
[1:08:07] somebody to enter into life amen there's
[1:08:09] somebody whose name is on the book of
[1:08:11] life amen who's going to enter into life
[1:08:14] and because of what they did for the
[1:08:16] Brethren what they did for Christ the
[1:08:19] word listen don't don't look at your
[1:08:21] flesh this is not about your flesh amen
[1:08:23] this is about the word that God has
[1:08:24] planted in your soul before the
[1:08:26] foundation of world this is the word
[1:08:27] that's been anointed by the spirit of
[1:08:29] God to come to life and live and
[1:08:31] manifest through your flesh it's not
[1:08:33] about your flesh it's about the
[1:08:35] word that's the life listen this is not
[1:08:38] tree of life so don't start looking at
[1:08:40] this and and and and over promote this
[1:08:42] that's not it it's the eternal life of
[1:08:44] God down on the
[1:08:46] inside and that life amen is here
[1:08:50] creating an opportunity at life for
[1:08:53] somebody body at the white Throne
[1:08:54] judgment my goodness how glorious will
[1:08:56] it be for us to be sitting with the
[1:08:59] queen next to the King when he separates
[1:09:01] the sheep and the goats and there's one
[1:09:03] amen there's one entering into eternal
[1:09:05] life because you had a need one day and
[1:09:08] that person met your need and you're
[1:09:09] watching them March through the gates
[1:09:11] into eternal life you think that won't
[1:09:13] be a day of rejoicing that won't be a
[1:09:15] day of shouting why because I was here
[1:09:18] they had opportunity I didn't put myself
[1:09:22] here God ordained for me to be here God
[1:09:25] ordained for them to be here it's all
[1:09:27] ordained of God but praise God living
[1:09:29] for others is eternal life I'm not here
[1:09:33] for myself I want to get that out of my
[1:09:35] head so bad I'm here for others and you
[1:09:38] say well I'm here to promote the message
[1:09:40] I am here to promote the message I'm
[1:09:41] here to live the word but I may be here
[1:09:43] to save somebody that has no other
[1:09:46] opportunity at the internal life but
[1:09:48] that they were good and kind to this
[1:09:50] part of the
[1:09:52] body so that that affects the way I live
[1:09:55] my life now I don't want to live my life
[1:09:58] unchristian I don't want to live my life
[1:09:59] contener I don't want to live my wife
[1:10:02] this is why we don't go into communal
[1:10:04] living we're all we're all going to sell
[1:10:05] out everything go out to North Dakota in
[1:10:08] the middle of nowhere and let's start a
[1:10:10] little commune no because living for
[1:10:12] others is eternal life I've got to go to
[1:10:15] work I've got to go to the market I've
[1:10:16] got to be amongst my unsaved loved
[1:10:19] ones why so the day amen can come oh
[1:10:24] praise God that they can come and bring
[1:10:26] honor into the City and take a leaf of
[1:10:28] the Tree of Life at the same time we're
[1:10:31] not just taking up space we're not just
[1:10:33] wasting air we are here by the purpose
[1:10:36] of God and the purpose of God is For
[1:10:41] Life those who enter into judgment do so
[1:10:44] of their own accord because they refused
[1:10:46] life when they came in contact with it
[1:10:48] but they had an opportunity because they
[1:10:50] came in contact with
[1:10:52] it
[1:10:55] I love the mercy and Judgment of God
[1:10:58] that he'll create a way listen where
[1:11:00] there was no other
[1:11:02] way this is a way where there was no
[1:11:05] other
[1:11:08] way brother brandom tells a story and I
[1:11:11] think it's super
[1:11:13] interesting there's so many things that
[1:11:15] the prophet understands that I don't
[1:11:17] understand so I'm just going to declare
[1:11:19] I don't understand but he says it and I
[1:11:22] believe it
[1:11:24] yeah and he comes to adoption in 1960 he
[1:11:27] said speaking to an old doctor yesterday
[1:11:30] one of my doctor friends buddies 80s
[1:11:32] something years old and his
[1:11:33] sister-in-law is here at the church
[1:11:35] tonight and she's been just a teeny
[1:11:37] teeny bit worried about
[1:11:39] him and I went to see him and as soon as
[1:11:42] I began to talk to him he brightened up
[1:11:44] he told me about a hunting trip he had
[1:11:46] taken many years ago in Colorado the
[1:11:47] very same country I hunt at just as
[1:11:50] brilliant and bright I said Doctor how
[1:11:52] long you been practicing
[1:11:54] he said when you were
[1:11:55] nursing way down I said and many times
[1:11:58] he said I've practiced taking my buggy I
[1:12:00] put my saddle bags over my horse I took
[1:12:02] the little satchel and I've walked and I
[1:12:04] said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00
[1:12:07] in the morning with your flashlight
[1:12:08] trying to find a house where a little
[1:12:10] child had a tummy ache or a mother in
[1:12:12] labor pains that's right and I said you
[1:12:15] know doctor I believe across this
[1:12:17] dividing line here between Mortal and
[1:12:19] immortality God has a place for good old
[1:12:22] doctors that serve like that
[1:12:26] I love that quote don't ask me to
[1:12:28] explain it mechanically I can't you can
[1:12:30] say well maybe one of those babies was
[1:12:32] an Alex I have no idea how that works
[1:12:34] out I just believe what the prophet said
[1:12:37] and it brings joy to my heart God has a
[1:12:40] place for good old doctors that serve
[1:12:41] like that now listen great tears come in
[1:12:44] his eyes and he started crying he
[1:12:46] reached up his feeble hands and said
[1:12:47] brother I hope so across the land god
[1:12:52] judges a man's soul what he
[1:12:57] is then I give him the satisfying
[1:13:00] scripture many times plowing through
[1:13:03] those dark muddy fields at night trying
[1:13:05] to help somebody maybe never get a penny
[1:13:07] for it but it's all right I I said Jesus
[1:13:10] said in the scripture blessed are the
[1:13:12] merciful for they shall obtain mercy and
[1:13:16] that is true that was the consola
[1:13:19] scripture that brother brandham gave the
[1:13:23] cons him to console him and that comes
[1:13:26] out of Matthew 5:7 that's the scripture
[1:13:29] but I'm going to read that to you but I
[1:13:30] want to read the next one to you too
[1:13:32] because it blesses me he said blessed
[1:13:34] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[1:13:37] mercy and then next blessed are the pure
[1:13:40] in heart for they shall see
[1:13:44] God what did he say to aimc aimc said
[1:13:47] you know the Integrity of my heart he
[1:13:48] said I know the Integrity of your
[1:13:51] heart that's why I kept you from sinning
[1:13:54] against me because I know the god judges
[1:13:57] a man by a soul what he is on the inside
[1:14:01] God knew what aimc really was amen aimc
[1:14:05] was caught in a trap and that trap was
[1:14:07] going to be his damnation damnation had
[1:14:09] already set in amen but God knew what
[1:14:12] was in AMC's heart and God shined Mercy
[1:14:15] on him because he knew he had a pure
[1:14:16] heart in this
[1:14:18] situation and God spared him by Mercy
[1:14:21] and gave him an opportunity to come to
[1:14:24] life why because he had his word there
[1:14:28] in
[1:14:30] Abraham praise
[1:14:32] God now let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:14:36] 7 I want to bring this in just
[1:14:38] now because I want to
[1:14:43] show God judges by what's in the
[1:14:49] heart and you can think well my that's
[1:14:52] great all you got to do is be
[1:14:55] merciful and do a bunch of good deeds
[1:14:57] and you're going to go to heaven I don't
[1:14:59] even know if I'm bride I don't even know
[1:15:01] I don't even know if I'm bride but if
[1:15:02] I'm just nice to the
[1:15:07] bride this is man is so intellectual as
[1:15:11] such nonsense floats around in our
[1:15:13] brains so I'm going to secure my
[1:15:15] position maybe I'm not the bride I don't
[1:15:17] quite have the faith to reach that far
[1:15:18] so I'm just going to be really good to
[1:15:19] the bride and that's going to be my
[1:15:20] ticket in listen every one of those the
[1:15:23] white Throne judgment had no idea why
[1:15:26] they were going into eternal life they
[1:15:27] didn't have it preconceived and figured
[1:15:29] out it wasn't intellectual reasoning it
[1:15:31] wasn't a bunch of works for Works sake
[1:15:33] it wasn't works with a false
[1:15:36] motive they were pure in heart when they
[1:15:39] were doing these things they didn't know
[1:15:42] it was going to equal life they didn't
[1:15:44] know that it was for Jesus Christ that
[1:15:46] so see see what I'm saying friends drop
[1:15:48] this intellectual nonsense and reasoning
[1:15:50] and saying I'm just if plan a fails I'm
[1:15:52] going for Plan B you're never going to
[1:15:54] make it there anyway so just forget it
[1:15:56] you got to throw all your stock into
[1:15:58] plan a with faith because you've heard
[1:16:00] the
[1:16:02] word so we're not hedging by I'm going
[1:16:05] to really be nice to the bride you
[1:16:06] should be nice to the bride anyways out
[1:16:09] of a pure
[1:16:13] heart if you're doing it to secure
[1:16:16] passage
[1:16:20] that we're going to see this right here
[1:16:22] in Matthew chapter 7 let's go to verse
[1:16:26] 21 Matthew 7: 21 not everyone that saith
[1:16:31] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:16:33] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:16:35] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:16:37] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:16:39] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:16:42] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:16:44] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:16:46] and then will I profess unto them I
[1:16:48] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:16:50] work
[1:16:52] iniquity
[1:16:54] what I did all of this in your
[1:16:57] name cast out devil many mighty Works
[1:17:00] healed the sick I've done all this and
[1:17:02] Jesus never denies that they did it
[1:17:05] there's no denial so the works in his
[1:17:08] name we're not going to get them into
[1:17:11] heaven listen look at what they
[1:17:14] did we prophesied in thy name am and I
[1:17:17] name cast out Devils that's good works
[1:17:19] they helped a lot of people cuz if
[1:17:21] you're casting out Devils you're really
[1:17:23] helping
[1:17:24] people and then I and and thy name have
[1:17:27] done many wonderful Works amen and then
[1:17:30] will I profess unto them I never knew
[1:17:32] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:17:36] that's the problem is
[1:17:38] Iniquity brother Bram said in the power
[1:17:40] of transformation what is Iniquity David
[1:17:42] said if I conceive iniquity in my heart
[1:17:44] God will not hear me see iniquity is
[1:17:47] something that you know you ought to do
[1:17:49] and you won't do it sir you know better
[1:17:52] but don't do it it's iniquity see you
[1:17:54] know they should stay with the word of
[1:17:56] God but for the church's sake or
[1:17:58] somebody else's sake or something else
[1:17:59] you stray from the word of God and do
[1:18:01] what the organization
[1:18:03] says all the good works and all the
[1:18:06] healing and all the blessing God's
[1:18:08] people and all being merciful to the
[1:18:10] whole world it didn't do one ounce of
[1:18:12] good for them because they had iniquity
[1:18:14] in their heart they didn't do it out of
[1:18:16] a pure
[1:18:17] heart right so you can see all the
[1:18:20] schemes of man they come crumbling down
[1:18:22] amen when we're standing there at the
[1:18:23] white Throne judgment there's not going
[1:18:25] to be any argument that day he's there
[1:18:28] Discerning the very thoughts of your
[1:18:32] heart so these who are the Righteous who
[1:18:36] enter in they were the
[1:18:40] ones there's there's going to be several
[1:18:43] categories that are saved at the white
[1:18:45] Throne judgment we're going to talk
[1:18:47] about that in a second but these
[1:18:50] righteous who are there solely because
[1:18:51] they were good and kind to the the
[1:18:54] Brethren they were
[1:18:57] surprised pleasantly
[1:18:59] surprised when they got down to judgment
[1:19:02] and they found out that that deed they
[1:19:05] did with pure motives and a pure
[1:19:08] heart not even knowing who they were
[1:19:10] serving or
[1:19:12] why that what they done secured their
[1:19:15] entrance into eternal
[1:19:16] life they were surprised friends they
[1:19:20] were shocked they didn't know it was
[1:19:22] Jesus they didn't know that they did
[1:19:23] these things to him they didn't why they
[1:19:25] were doing it out of a pure heart right
[1:19:29] amen they go into eternal life why
[1:19:34] because they were pure in
[1:19:37] heart and so I want to I want to write
[1:19:41] down the categories of those that will
[1:19:44] be over
[1:19:45] here you have
[1:19:48] those that were
[1:19:51] good to the brethren
[1:19:57] we're going to have two more categories
[1:20:00] as we go but I going to read them first
[1:20:03] back in the sardan church age he says
[1:20:04] it's the second Resurrection
[1:20:06] Resurrection where the foolish virgins
[1:20:08] come up notice that they were virgins
[1:20:11] they did not have the Holy Spirit so
[1:20:12] they missed being in the bride while the
[1:20:15] five wives who had oil became part of
[1:20:16] that bride but these people being a
[1:20:19] separated god-loving people and trying
[1:20:21] to abide in the word according to what
[1:20:23] they knew of it and being a help in the
[1:20:26] work of the Lord will come up at the end
[1:20:29] of time they will miss the Millennium
[1:20:31] which you can begin to see by these
[1:20:33] truths is much more important and
[1:20:35] wonderful than we have ever thought or
[1:20:39] believed so who else will be here the
[1:20:42] foolish
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:51] virgin some of them no doubt were also
[1:20:54] kind and good to the Brethren like
[1:20:57] Nicodemus and
[1:21:00] Gia but he says here these people are
[1:21:04] separated god-loving people in trying to
[1:21:06] abide in the word according to what they
[1:21:08] knew of it and being a help in the work
[1:21:10] of the Lord will come up at the end of
[1:21:14] time it has to do with the
[1:21:18] word even the foolish virgin their
[1:21:21] salvation has to do do with what they
[1:21:23] did with the word that they
[1:21:25] had and that they were helping in the
[1:21:28] work of the Lord not their own work
[1:21:31] somehow they're helping in the work of
[1:21:32] the Lord however they're doing that I
[1:21:35] don't know I'm not going to put labels
[1:21:36] on it but they're because they're an aid
[1:21:39] and a help in the things of God and
[1:21:42] they're trying to keep the word the best
[1:21:44] that they know it's still all about the
[1:21:47] word their salvation is linked to the
[1:21:49] word those who are good and kind to the
[1:21:51] Brethren because the Brethren are the
[1:21:52] manif ested word those who are foolish
[1:21:54] virgin because they're promoting the
[1:21:56] word amen and the next group is going to
[1:21:58] have to do with the word
[1:21:59] too let's look at this next
[1:22:02] group it is the second resurrection that
[1:22:05] the souls under the altar is set forth
[1:22:07] in the fifth seal Revelations 6:9-11 are
[1:22:10] given white robes and of course eternal
[1:22:12] life or there would be no point of white
[1:22:13] robes further down in the quote he says
[1:22:16] they come up in the resurrection and
[1:22:17] receive life because of their stand on
[1:22:20] the word these are the Jews amen the
[1:22:23] Jews amen that died from the time of
[1:22:25] Christ on this is the Jews under the
[1:22:28] altar in the fifth seal so they come up
[1:22:30] in the resurrection and receive life
[1:22:32] because of their stand on the word and
[1:22:35] notice how these are crying out for re
[1:22:37] Revenge they cannot be bride material
[1:22:39] the bride turns the cheek and cries
[1:22:41] forgive them Father they know not what
[1:22:42] they do these are Jews they have to be
[1:22:45] because they are in the fifth seal and
[1:22:46] it's the for seal of the Gentile bride
[1:22:48] has gone in the Rapture so these Jews
[1:22:50] aren't born of his Spirit they don't
[1:22:52] even believe that Jesus is the
[1:22:57] Messiah but as they were blinded by God
[1:22:59] for the Gentiles say God gave them
[1:23:01] eternal life on the grounds that they
[1:23:04] that that though they could not come to
[1:23:06] him yet they were truly faithful to all
[1:23:09] the word they knew and died for it as
[1:23:12] multitudes died under Hitler Stalin Etc
[1:23:15] and will yet
[1:23:17] die so
[1:23:19] now
[1:23:21] these are the
[1:23:24] Jews of the New
[1:23:27] Testament of the New Testament
[1:23:31] dispensation why are they
[1:23:34] saved the word because of the word
[1:23:38] because of the
[1:23:42] word let's go to
[1:23:45] John chapter
[1:23:51] 1
[1:23:58] John chapter
[1:24:04] 1 John chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[1:24:08] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:11] with God and the Word was God the same
[1:24:14] was in the beginning with God all things
[1:24:16] were made by him and without him was not
[1:24:18] anything made that was made in him was
[1:24:21] life yes and the life was the light of
[1:24:25] men what is in the word
[1:24:29] life who is the Tree of Life Christ the
[1:24:33] manifested
[1:24:35] word what happened to each one of
[1:24:39] these they got life because of their
[1:24:42] attitude their approach or their service
[1:24:45] to the
[1:24:47] word why is it we have
[1:24:50] life not necessarily because of our
[1:24:52] attitude approach or service that all
[1:24:54] part of it but we have life because we
[1:24:57] are the word and always had life because
[1:25:01] we were always part of his thinking we
[1:25:03] were always part of the
[1:25:05] word so now we see as these go marching
[1:25:11] into life they go into life because of
[1:25:15] the
[1:25:16] word we're here why are you on this
[1:25:19] Earth to manifest the word am amen and
[1:25:24] being here to manifest the word is
[1:25:26] creating an opportunity for
[1:25:28] somebody maybe to come into the
[1:25:31] city maybe to come into the City and
[1:25:35] bring maybe a service an honor into the
[1:25:39] city in exchange for leaves from the
[1:25:42] Tree of
[1:25:43] Life you know what's interesting about
[1:25:45] this city when we get to New heavens and
[1:25:48] new
[1:25:48] earth this city has Gates yeah you know
[1:25:52] you know what gates are gates are
[1:25:54] doors right but when you get to New
[1:25:57] heavens and new earth all the doors are
[1:26:01] open and they're never closed by day or
[1:26:04] by night and the light is always shining
[1:26:07] in the city
[1:26:10] yesu and they can come to the city
[1:26:13] anytime they want there's no closed
[1:26:17] access so do you know what my goal is
[1:26:19] now in this life I want to be part of
[1:26:21] that City and I don't want to be a barb
[1:26:23] wire fence I don't want to be a metal
[1:26:25] door I want to be a gate that's standing
[1:26:28] open in the city where somebody can come
[1:26:30] and partake of life amen where the light
[1:26:33] is shining forth I don't want to be a
[1:26:36] wall to prevent or to hinder I don't
[1:26:38] want to become a hindrance to life but I
[1:26:40] want to become an open door where
[1:26:42] somebody can come to the city Amen in
[1:26:45] exchange for life right say praise be to
[1:26:50] God what is it all about it's not not
[1:26:52] it's not me it's not you it's the word
[1:26:55] that's down in us when they serve that
[1:26:58] word God loves
[1:27:01] it to fight the word brother B said
[1:27:04] whose names are they that were in The
[1:27:06] Book of Life and blotted out of the book
[1:27:07] of life he said it's very clear whose
[1:27:10] names were there and then blotted out
[1:27:11] it's those who fought the bride those
[1:27:14] who resisted the word and those who
[1:27:16] fought against the word like Judas he
[1:27:18] had his name on the book but his name
[1:27:19] was blotted out why he came to the Tree
[1:27:21] of Life and he rejected
[1:27:24] it but there was those who came to the
[1:27:26] tree of life and accepted
[1:27:28] it God has given us a privilege friends
[1:27:32] I want to live as a display of the city
[1:27:36] I want the light to shine I want his
[1:27:38] throne where was his throne his throne
[1:27:41] was in the top of the city and his light
[1:27:42] was shining down through the city and
[1:27:44] the walls of the city were Jasper clear
[1:27:47] as Crystal amen I want my life to be
[1:27:49] clear as Crystal not smutted up with the
[1:27:51] word world but clear so that the light
[1:27:54] that's shining on me will shine out of
[1:27:56] me and I don't want to close door I
[1:27:58] don't want to commune I don't want to
[1:27:59] shut everybody off and I don't want to
[1:28:01] treat
[1:28:02] everybody horrible and grouchy and and
[1:28:05] contentious I want to be an open door
[1:28:07] where the light shining out where
[1:28:08] somebody can come and bring something to
[1:28:11] the city in exchange for the tree of
[1:28:13] life when you look at all three of
[1:28:18] these you look at all three of
[1:28:21] these
[1:28:23] and for one reason or another right they
[1:28:28] could
[1:28:31] not receive
[1:28:37] Revelation not because they didn't want
[1:28:40] to but because they
[1:28:42] couldn't because as for the foolish
[1:28:45] virgin and those that are good to their
[1:28:46] Brethren they did not have the Cene of
[1:28:49] life on the inside remember when Jesus
[1:28:51] come come to the woman at the well and
[1:28:53] the woman at the well when Jesus began
[1:28:54] to speak and began to receive exactly
[1:28:56] what he was saying and it quickened that
[1:28:58] seed like that and brother bam said why
[1:29:00] when all the Pharisees and all the
[1:29:01] others were hearing of him they didn't
[1:29:03] he said they had nothing to receive the
[1:29:05] word with they had nothing to believe
[1:29:07] with but she had something inside to
[1:29:09] believe the word with you and I have
[1:29:11] something on the inside to believe the
[1:29:12] word with and we didn't give it to
[1:29:14] ourselves that was the grace of God that
[1:29:16] was decided before the foundation of the
[1:29:18] world that shouldn't make us proud or
[1:29:20] arrogant or contentious or a closed door
[1:29:23] or a smutted up wall that gives us
[1:29:25] tremendous amounts of responsibility
[1:29:27] that if God placed that in me I want to
[1:29:30] be like this
[1:29:32] city but these my friend they didn't
[1:29:35] have what you have and they could never
[1:29:38] have what you have and they can never
[1:29:40] believe the way you
[1:29:41] believe that's why we don't that's why
[1:29:44] we don't uh have any attitude towards
[1:29:46] those who can't receive it amen if they
[1:29:48] they can't receive if they don't have
[1:29:50] the seed they can't receive it
[1:29:52] it the Jews can't receive it cuz they
[1:29:55] were blinded intentionally so that Grace
[1:29:57] could come to the Gentiles and because
[1:29:59] God put his hand over their eyes he's a
[1:30:02] merciful god and he's just and all said
[1:30:04] because I did that as long as they'll
[1:30:06] hold to the word that I gave them I will
[1:30:08] give them white robes at the white
[1:30:10] Throne
[1:30:12] judgment the the the foolish virgin amen
[1:30:15] they're god-loving separated people but
[1:30:18] they don't have a SE gene on the inside
[1:30:20] that can receive Revelation but yet
[1:30:22] there's something in them though they
[1:30:23] can't receive the Revelation they love
[1:30:26] the word and they love the people of God
[1:30:28] and they want to support the work of God
[1:30:30] Amen but they cannot receive the
[1:30:32] Revelation you and I can receive and
[1:30:34] those that are good and kind to the
[1:30:35] Brethren some of them listen this may
[1:30:38] shock you some of them may not even be
[1:30:44] churchgoers but something in them love
[1:30:47] something in
[1:30:50] you without this sing so now you've got
[1:30:53] people who could not receive the
[1:30:56] Revelation that you and I can receive
[1:30:57] but by the mercy of God by his by the by
[1:31:01] the extension of grace through the Tree
[1:31:03] of Life they're now to enter into
[1:31:06] life why because of their attitude their
[1:31:09] approach their service their work for
[1:31:12] life which is the
[1:31:14] word and I for one say thank
[1:31:19] God this message is so so beautiful
[1:31:22] because it accurately portrays the
[1:31:24] nature of God
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:30] himself blessed are the merciful they
[1:31:33] shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure
[1:31:36] in heart not the ones with iniquity
[1:31:39] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:31:42] shall see God and I say thank you
[1:31:47] God thank you God now our attitude
[1:31:51] towards all the those around
[1:31:52] us listen there's no reason to F fight
[1:31:55] there's no reason to cram anything down
[1:31:57] anybody's
[1:31:59] throat you know the woman at the well
[1:32:03] she couldn't get
[1:32:05] enough Jesus would say one thing and she
[1:32:08] would ask another
[1:32:09] question Jesus would say something and
[1:32:11] she would say oh that's it now now now
[1:32:14] they tell us that we worship here what
[1:32:16] what what do you tell I perceive you're
[1:32:17] a prophet now you tell me then then he
[1:32:19] gives her another answer she never
[1:32:21] walked away and says let me think about
[1:32:23] what you're saying I'm not so sure it
[1:32:25] doesn't make sense to me she comes right
[1:32:27] back and she says we know that when
[1:32:28] Messiah comes when Messiah comes he'll
[1:32:30] tell us these
[1:32:32] things listen Jesus never was ramming it
[1:32:35] down her throat saying stay here let me
[1:32:37] explain it again come back over to my
[1:32:39] house one more time we need to do an
[1:32:41] additional Bible study you're just not
[1:32:42] getting
[1:32:45] it amen we have to realize that in the
[1:32:50] Book of Life there's several different
[1:32:53] categories that serve God's purpose in
[1:32:56] several different
[1:32:58] ways let God sorted out the thing to do
[1:33:02] is spread the
[1:33:03] seed just cast the seed if it falls on
[1:33:06] good ground it'll come forth and bear
[1:33:08] fruit you don't have to worry about that
[1:33:09] because the ground is prepared before
[1:33:12] you seed the seed we don't have to have
[1:33:15] negative attitudes we don't have to
[1:33:16] press we don't have to push all we have
[1:33:18] to do is sew the seed and listen if you
[1:33:20] ever get a hold of a woman like the
[1:33:21] woman at the well don't worry she'll
[1:33:23] come back you give her one answer she'll
[1:33:26] come for the next you give her another
[1:33:28] answer she'll come for the third you you
[1:33:30] don't have to push and you don't have to
[1:33:32] broaden you don't have to handcuff and
[1:33:33] force feed
[1:33:37] right sometimes you realize oh they
[1:33:39] didn't catch it not that they were
[1:33:42] against it not that they spoke evil not
[1:33:46] that they
[1:33:47] condemned but it just went over their
[1:33:50] head
[1:33:52] just let it
[1:33:55] go let them come in God's provided
[1:34:00] way and you'll still have Fellowship in
[1:34:04] the great Eternal regions of
[1:34:06] forever when they come into that
[1:34:09] City guess what we're going to greet
[1:34:12] them and fellowship with them and enjoy
[1:34:15] our fellowship for
[1:34:17] eternity praise be to God let's just
[1:34:20] thank god let's
[1:34:24] stand I thank God for this
[1:34:27] message I'm so glad I don't have to walk
[1:34:30] around contener and angry and forcing
[1:34:32] everybody to see it my way and to
[1:34:34] believe everything I believe I can just
[1:34:36] so see you know the seed sewer that went
[1:34:38] forth to sew he you know I hate to say
[1:34:41] anything negative about somebody I never
[1:34:43] met but he wasn't really
[1:34:47] skilled he got seed in the byways he got
[1:34:50] seed in the path he got seed in the
[1:34:52] thorn he got seed everywhere and he
[1:34:55] happened to get some in good ground and
[1:34:57] so I don't think God's expecting us to
[1:34:59] be uh tactically laser beam uh accurate
[1:35:02] in our sewing of our seed we hold back
[1:35:04] the seed and say I'm going to wait I
[1:35:06] don't want to waste any seed and I don't
[1:35:08] want to sew it in the wrong ground so
[1:35:10] I'm just going to wait and okay I think
[1:35:12] you're good ground I'll give you
[1:35:16] one no he just had a bag of seed and he
[1:35:19] was out there TOS let's just toss seed
[1:35:21] let's just live the life let our life
[1:35:23] speak the word let let our life our
[1:35:25] families our our relationships our
[1:35:27] conduct our dress and our speech let it
[1:35:29] spread seed everywhere and if there's
[1:35:32] good ground don't worry the good ground
[1:35:35] will receive the seed it'll grow it'll
[1:35:37] bear fruit we don't have to be worried
[1:35:40] about it friends all we got to do is
[1:35:42] live a Christian
[1:35:44] Life don't don't fail to testify don't
[1:35:48] fail to give the message don't fail to
[1:35:50] speak the me don't don't mean don't
[1:35:52] don't don't misunderstand what I'm
[1:35:53] saying share the word but if it doesn't
[1:35:55] take don't worry about it it'll be
[1:35:58] okay if there's a seed there don't worry
[1:36:01] next time they're around you they'll be
[1:36:03] you know him huling around and wanting
[1:36:05] to ask you a question but not wanting to
[1:36:07] ask you a question cuz something inside
[1:36:10] of them stir listen there's no way
[1:36:12] they're going to be able to resist it
[1:36:13] it's like magnetism a seed genus
[1:36:15] magnetized to the word if they found a
[1:36:17] source of where the waters flowing amen
[1:36:19] there's a magnetic pool they'll come
[1:36:21] back around and say Hey you know that
[1:36:24] that thing you said the other day I'm
[1:36:25] not so sure about can you run that past
[1:36:27] me
[1:36:29] again then inside you can just smile and
[1:36:31] say I'll just go to throw some more
[1:36:34] seeding God knows who's
[1:36:37] who God knows who's
[1:36:39] who everybody who's going to come to
[1:36:42] life is going to come one way or another
[1:36:45] but I thank God for his
[1:36:48] plan I thank God Mercy was EXT extended
[1:36:52] beyond the bride yes and I thank God
[1:36:56] that I can stand on this Earth as a
[1:36:59] source of
[1:37:00] life not because of me but because of
[1:37:03] what he planted inside of me is a part
[1:37:06] of
[1:37:07] himself and there's an opportunity for
[1:37:10] life that walks around clothed in this
[1:37:13] Veil and I'm thankful for that and it
[1:37:17] changes my attitude towards my
[1:37:20] interactions with people people let's be
[1:37:22] conscious of this friends let's be wide
[1:37:24] awake and realize what we are and who we
[1:37:28] are brother bam said in the first quote
[1:37:30] I read he says we fail to see the power
[1:37:34] that God has placed in his people God is
[1:37:38] in his
[1:37:40] people the tree of life is
[1:37:43] available the word is
