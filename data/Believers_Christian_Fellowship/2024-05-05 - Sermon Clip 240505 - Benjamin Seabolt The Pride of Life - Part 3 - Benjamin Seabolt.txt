========================================

2900 years ago a flaw in the spirit of Elijah's character and God says I have got to deal with that because this ministry this man this vessel is the vessel that I'm literally going to step into as the lamb and pull the seals off of the book and I cannot understand what I'm saying God's not taking it chance I cannot take a chance that when I put the power of the spoken word the cre the creative spoken word on his tongue that he will even interject himself slightly I've got to deal with this one I know it was 2,900 years ago but I've got to make sure that's not going to rise up at the inopportune time I'm going to make a really drastic statement not Doctrine but I'm going to go here to 19 58 May the eth paragraph 63 how fitting 63 and he says now before it comes to pass I'm sparing you may the 8th 1958 paragraph 63 is literally the hinging point of whether the lamb can come and break the seals or not it's the hinging point because if he doesn't pass this test the lamb cannot step into this vessel am what if he comes to the first seal and says well I don't know what it is but I think it's right we're done yeah me and you would not be sitting here if he comes to these seals being loose and he and he doesn't know for certainty that I have to wait for God himself to come and speak this word out of me yes if I can interject anything of me into this me and you are doomed we cannot come into the full image of Christ amen and remember the seals were just not the interpretation of the symbols the seals were the release of the spirit of God to us it was the full not a partial dip but this this was the fullness of the spirit of God they asked brother brandom the question now that this has been released could you come and speak the word over somebody and instantly put them into rapturing condition and he says yes that's right amen amen what has he done to us Saints has not the word that he has came and spoken over top of us put us into rapturing condition that would have never happened if he would have said anything else in paragraph 63 this was the liftoff point because now God has rectified and it wasn't to say that brother Bram didn't have issues coming up in his life that he made mistakes and God had to deal with him but we're talking about a issue that was 2900 years ago in the spirit of Elijah that God is wanting to use to fulfill his ministry he's got to root that out of there he's got to expose that and he's got to get that out of there to go where he wants to go
