[1:32] their fortunes, they've forgotten what

[21:00] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together.
[21:03] Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful,
[21:05] Lord Jesus, that you've gathered us once
[21:08] again. That you've allowed us this
[21:09] privilege of being together. Lord, we
[21:12] pray that you would just move, Lord, in
[21:14] our midst, Lord, that you would have
[21:16] free reign. Lord, we pray you take these
[21:18] lips and mind under your control to
[21:20] speak your word. May you give us ears to
[21:22] hear and hearts to perceive all that you
[21:24] have for us. And Lord, may you
[21:26] accomplish your purpose as we surrender
[21:28] to you and give you the preeminence that
[21:30] you desire. May you find the liberty to
[21:32] work your work in this place and in our
[21:35] lives. We commit this service into your
[21:38] hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[21:42] Amen. Amen. Before we turn to our
[21:45] scriptures, I'm going to let you all
[21:46] have your seats for just a minute
[21:47] because this is another special Sunday.
[21:50] We have a baby dedication this Sunday.
[21:52] So, if brother Aaron and Sister Samantha

[21:55] little baby girl forward, we're be happy
[21:58] to help them dedicate her, Amen. to the
[22:02] Lord. And it's always a privilege to see
[22:06] God blessing the young families and
[22:08] bringing forth life. Amen. This little
[22:11] girl's name is Gwindelyn Irene Small.
[22:14] Gwindelyn means blessed ring and Irene
[22:17] means peace. And so, she's got a lovely
[22:19] name.
[22:23] God bless you
[22:25] both. Oh my
[22:31] goodness. Let's all pray
[22:34] together. Dear Lord Jesus, God, I stand
[22:38] here as your representation, Lord. Your
[22:40] representative in this church, Lord, as
[22:42] pastor, shepherd of this flock. Lord, if
[22:46] you were here, you would draw this baby
[22:48] up in your arms as the mothers brought
[22:50] you children, Lord. and you took them in
[22:52] your arms and blessed them. So here I am
[22:54] in yourstead. And Lord, so in the name
[22:57] of Jesus Christ, I take this little girl
[22:59] in my arms, little Gwindelin Irene
[23:02] Small, and I bless her, Lord. May her
[23:04] life be blessed. May you hedge her about
[23:06] and protect her and watch over her,
[23:08] Lord, all the days of her life. May you
[23:10] become real to her and may you speak to
[23:12] her heart from the time she's a young
[23:14] person, Lord. That she would never stray
[23:16] and never know the ws of the enemy, but
[23:18] she would know your way and she would
[23:20] walk in your way. Pray to watch over her
[23:22] protector. Bless her mother and her
[23:24] father. Give them wisdom and strength
[23:27] and understanding to raise this little
[23:28] life for your glory. For they are
[23:30] stewards over the life and you have
[23:32] entrusted her into their hands
[23:34] temporarily for a time. And may they be
[23:37] found faithful in their post of duty.
[23:39] May you bless my brother Aaron. Give him
[23:41] strength and wisdom and understanding to
[23:43] lead and to provide for her life. Lord,
[23:46] pray that you bless sister Samantha. May
[23:48] she have the nurture and care and the
[23:50] motherly instincts to care for this
[23:52] little wind. And may she show her an
[23:54] example of Christian femininity that can
[23:57] follow. And Lord, may we as an assembly
[24:00] gather around this family and support
[24:02] them and care for them and lend our
[24:04] support and care, Lord, so they have the
[24:06] strength to bring forth, Lord, this life
[24:08] to full maturity. We love you. We thank
[24:11] you for the gifts that you give, for all
[24:13] your gifts are good. And we enjoy this
[24:15] moment and share it together and give
[24:17] you glory for it. In Jesus Christ's name
[24:19] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you

[24:27] and she's so warm. God bless you. God

[24:32] all stand
[24:33] together.
[24:35] Amen. God bless you, musicians. Thank

[24:40] Sister Rachel back at the organ. Amen.
[24:42] After God had healed her and brought her
[24:46] back. Amen. What a wonderful rejoicing
[24:50] day. You know, the Bible says, "Many are
[24:52] the afflictions of the righteous, but he
[24:54] is God who deliverth them from them
[24:55] all." And so, we love to see God's hand
[24:58] delivering. Amen. If you would like to
[25:00] turn to the book of Revelation, chapter
[25:02] 5, you can begin turning there. Just
[25:04] want to remind you that brother uh Gabe
[25:06] Smith, he's in Oregon this morning, uh
[25:09] preaching for brother Rich Cobb. And
[25:11] then brother Kyle Wert's across town
[25:12] preaching at Bible believers this
[25:14] morning. So, we want to remember them as
[25:17] well. And then also next Sunday, uh,
[25:20] which will be Easter Sunday, Brother Jim
[25:22] Swanson will be over and take the Easter
[25:23] service at Bible believers. So I know
[25:25] he'd appreciate your prayers as well for
[25:28] that service. Amen. So let's turn to
[25:31] Revelation chapter 5. Let's begin with
[25:34] verse one. Also want to thank the
[25:36] sisters for the special today. That was
[25:38] wonderful. Appreciate that so
[25:41] much. Amen.
[25:43] Revelation 5 verse 1.
[25:47] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[25:49] sat on the throne a book written within
[25:51] and on the backside sealed with seven
[25:54] seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaim
[25:56] with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to
[25:59] open the book and to loose the seals
[26:01] thereof?" And no man in the heaven, nor
[26:03] in the earth, neither under the earth,
[26:05] was able to open the book, neither to
[26:07] look thereon. And I wept much, because
[26:10] no man was found worthy to open and to
[26:12] read the book, neither to look thereon.
[26:15] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[26:17] weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe
[26:19] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[26:21] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[26:23] the seven seals thereof. And I beheld,
[26:25] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[26:27] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[26:28] the elders stood a lamb, as I had been
[26:30] slain, having seven horns, and seven
[26:32] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[26:34] God, sent forth under all the earth. And
[26:36] he came, and he took the book out of the
[26:38] right hand of him that sat upon the
[26:41] throne. Amen. God bless you all. May God
[26:44] bless us as we have our seats and God
[26:46] bless us as we look into his word.
[26:49] Amen. So for this morning, I'd like to
[26:52] take the subject, the mysterious book in
[26:55] an earthn vessel. The mysterious book in
[26:58] an earthn vessel. And uh you know, we've
[27:01] preached on these things so many times,
[27:03] but I don't think we've exhausted it
[27:05] yet. Amen. There's so much revelation
[27:07] here. And this was so important to the
[27:10] ministry of the seventh angel to brother
[27:11] Brandham that that this time in in this
[27:14] time uh in the redemption plan this time
[27:18] that we find ourselves in was such a
[27:20] critical junction in time. It was the
[27:22] completion the wrapping up of so many
[27:24] things and uh we might talk about that a
[27:27] little bit. But I want to I there's just
[27:29] some things I've been looking at that
[27:31] keep opening more and more. Uh and and
[27:33] things that we know and things we've
[27:35] heard and things we've talked about, but
[27:37] they keep opening on other levels and
[27:39] they keep surprising. Uh for me, they
[27:41] keep surprising me as the depths keep
[27:43] opening and opening and opening. The
[27:45] word is like an onion. It just keeps
[27:46] peeling. Amen. Keeps opening and it gets
[27:49] fresher the deeper you go and more
[27:51] powerful. Amen. And that's why it brings
[27:53] tears to our eyes to see the revelation
[27:55] of the hour. Amen. And so this morning
[27:57] we're doing something a little bit
[27:58] different. Brother Franco just grabbed
[28:00] my notes just when I was in the back
[28:02] room there and he said he's going to try
[28:04] to throw them on the overhead like they
[28:06] did when I was out in Arizona. And I
[28:08] said, "God bless you, brother, if you
[28:09] can do it that fast, you know." So he's
[28:11] only had a few minutes. So I didn't put
[28:14] this PowerPoint together. I don't even
[28:16] know what order I'm going to preach this
[28:18] in. I've come to I've come today with
[28:20] more material than I can get through. I
[28:22] don't intend to get through it all.
[28:24] Amen. So, I'm just praying that God will
[28:26] have his way. We may jump around a
[28:28] little bit, but I'm just asking you to
[28:29] be patient and keep feeding. Amen. All I
[28:32] want you to do is keep reaching out for
[28:34] the next bite. And God will give you the
[28:35] next bite. Amen. So, just keep saying,
[28:37] "I want another bite. I want another
[28:39] bite. I want another bite." So, I don't
[28:41] intend to preach at all. At some point,
[28:42] we got to find a stopping point. And I'm
[28:44] asking God to give us the stopping point
[28:46] because we want to catch this uh this
[28:49] what's opening up, what's fresh on my
[28:51] heart. Amen. I want to deliver to you.
[28:53] And then we want to stop and we may pick
[28:54] it up again Wednesday night. But if you
[28:57] come to the table hungry, he'll feed.
[28:59] Amen. He will feed his sheep. Amen. And
[29:02] so we're going to try to read through
[29:04] some of these things and go through
[29:06] them. And I will Hey, if I have to
[29:08] stumble around, it won't make me
[29:10] nervous. You just don't get nervous. If
[29:12] you don't get nervous, everything will
[29:13] be fine. If God got to flip through and
[29:15] find my next slide, it'll all be fine.
[29:17] Amen. And if we abandon the whole
[29:19] PowerPoint and go a different direction,
[29:21] that'll be fine, too. Amen. Praise God.
[29:24] So, we just read through this scripture,
[29:26] but I want to read through this quote
[29:27] now. Says, "Notice he's not an animal
[29:30] because the lamb went and took the book,
[29:32] but not an animal." Amen. Brother Ram
[29:35] says, "The book of Revelation is a book
[29:36] of symbols." He preached a message
[29:38] called Book of Revelation, book of
[29:39] symbols. Amen. So, a lamb can't take a
[29:42] book because he has no hands. He can't
[29:45] hold a book. He doesn't mouth it, you
[29:47] know. So, it's symbology. So, when he
[29:49] say lamb, we know he's talking about
[29:50] Jesus Christ. Yeah, the man. Amen. But
[29:54] this man is the lamb. He's the
[29:55] sacrificial lamb. Amen. That made the
[29:58] atonement that paid the price of
[29:59] redemption. That I was our
[30:00] substitutionary lamb that took our place
[30:03] on Calvary and died for our sins. So he
[30:05] is the lamb, but he's not a lamb.
[30:08] He's a man. Amen. But that man is a
[30:11] lamb. And that lamb's also a lion. Amen.
[30:15] Amen. So you see how you read the book
[30:18] of Revelation? You don't read the book
[30:20] of Revelation literally. It's a book of
[30:22] symbols to bring forth a truth. Amen. A
[30:25] hidden truth.
[30:27] So either he he took the book out of the
[30:30] right hand of him that sat upon the
[30:31] throne. Who was it? The owner, the
[30:33] original owner that had the book of
[30:35] redemption in his right hand. And no
[30:37] angel, no angelic being, nothing else
[30:39] could take the place. And this bloody
[30:41] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[30:43] his hand. What was it? Brother, this is
[30:45] the most sublime thing in scripture.
[30:47] Amen. An act that not an angel, not
[30:50] nothing could do it. And the lamb come
[30:52] and took it from the right hand of him
[30:54] that sat upon the throne. What is it
[30:56] now? It belongs to the lamb.
[30:58] Amen. I I've heard this script uh this
[31:01] quote so many times and I wanted to look
[31:03] up sublime. What does sublime mean? And
[31:05] and and one of the definitions I found
[31:08] online was lofty, grand, exalted in
[31:12] thought, expression or manner. That's
[31:15] one definition. and others of
[31:17] outstanding spiritual, intellectual or
[31:19] moral worth.
[31:23] Amen. This is the most sublime thing in
[31:26] the scripture.
[31:28] If this is the most sublime, the thing
[31:30] of outstanding spiritual, intellectual,
[31:33] moral value, the thing that's lofty and
[31:35] grand, excellent in thought, expression
[31:37] or manner, and he says this is the most
[31:39] sublime thing in all of the scripture.
[31:42] Listen, he didn't say that Calvary was
[31:44] the most sublime thing in scripture.
[31:46] Although Calvary is fundamental,
[31:49] without it, we have no redemption.
[31:51] Without it, we're we're completely lost.
[31:53] Amen. But but if you have the purchase
[31:56] price paid, but there's no claiming of
[31:58] redemption. It was paid, but then it
[32:00] falters at the claiming, and then you
[32:02] never come into the inheritance, the
[32:04] full restoration of what was lost. Amen.
[32:06] So, we've got to have the price paid,
[32:09] but there also has to be a time that the
[32:11] that the that the that the purchased
[32:13] price, Amen, brings about the fullness
[32:15] of redemption, which is a return back to
[32:17] the inheritance.
[32:20] Amen. That was the reason he came and
[32:23] died.
[32:25] Amen. A reason that he came and died is
[32:27] because the inheritance was lost and had
[32:31] to be purchased back.
[32:34] So when we go to the first seal here, he
[32:36] says now in this fifth chapter, the
[32:39] breaking of the seals and now the seven
[32:41] sealed book. First we want to read the
[32:43] first seal. Last evening to background
[32:45] just a little more, we find out that
[32:46] John looked and seen the book still in
[32:48] the hands of the original owner. You
[32:50] remember how it was lost by Adam? He
[32:53] forfeited the book of life for the
[32:55] knowledge of Satan and lost his
[32:56] inheritance. Lost everything and no way
[32:59] for redemption. Then God made in the
[33:02] likeness of men came down and became a
[33:04] redeemer to us to redeem us. And now we
[33:07] find out that in the days past by these
[33:10] things which was mysterious is to be
[33:12] opened up to us in the last days. So it
[33:15] was lost because Adam was the first son
[33:17] of God and he was given dominion over
[33:20] the earth. He was gi he was a god upon
[33:22] the creation of of god. He was given the
[33:24] dominion to be a god on the earth. Amen.
[33:27] and and his commission was to multiply
[33:29] and replenish. And we know, brother Bam
[33:31] told us he was to bring forth the God
[33:33] race. Amen. Upon the earth, the seed of
[33:35] God, the children of God. That was God's
[33:38] original desire from the beginning.
[33:40] Amen. And so because of that, he had the
[33:43] book. Yeah.
[33:47] Listen, remember book of Revelation,
[33:50] book of symbols. That's right.
[33:53] What kind of book was Adam carrying
[33:55] around? Right? Remember when brother
[33:57] Stan Price was here, he was talking
[33:58] about this. Amen. And then brother Ram
[34:01] shows us in the symbology of the book.
[34:03] It was a scroll that was wrapped around
[34:05] and had a seal on it. Another one
[34:06] wrapped in another seal. But that's the
[34:08] symbol form. Amen. The question is what
[34:11] book was Adam carrying around? Because
[34:13] brother Bam tells us Adam had this book.
[34:15] It was the right to inheritance. It was
[34:17] the right Amen. to the contents of the
[34:19] book. What was in the book? He had a
[34:21] right to that book. And and the question
[34:23] is what did Adam do with the book? Was
[34:25] he walking around holding this and
[34:27] tilling the ground? And and then you
[34:29] know just just to show that this is not
[34:32] natural. This is spiritual. Amen. Adam
[34:35] was naked. Yeah. So where did he put the
[34:39] book when he had to use two hands? He
[34:40] didn't have a pocket. There was no
[34:43] Let me set this down.
[34:47] Are we understanding friends?
[34:50] Where was this book? Amen. Now, how did
[34:52] he have the book? The book was the mind
[34:55] of God. The book was the mystery plan of
[34:57] God. The book was the thing that was
[34:59] trapped in God's mind, what he wanted to
[35:01] do, what he wanted to achieve. And it
[35:02] was all written in that book. And that
[35:04] book is the family of God coming forth
[35:06] on the earth. And that book was given to
[35:08] Adam because Adam was supposed to bring
[35:10] forth that family. Brother Brandham said
[35:12] they would have eventually brought forth
[35:13] Christ. Amen.
[35:17] Amen. Christ, the one seed, the seed of
[35:19] Abraham, Christ, the promised seed. It
[35:21] would have come forth in a many membered
[35:23] body because that's all the seed
[35:27] and he was given that book. But when
[35:29] part of himself, Amen, the woman hybrid
[35:31] the seed with the serpent and he went
[35:33] and took the woman. Now because of
[35:35] hybridization, he lost the book
[35:39] and it went back to the original owner.
[35:42] Amen. What book?
[35:47] What paper was it written on?
[35:50] What kind of ink? You know, brother Bam
[35:53] says that your name, the only thing in
[35:54] the book are names.
[35:57] So he says in the church age book, the
[35:59] only thing in the book are names. But I
[36:01] thought there was revelations trapped in
[36:02] the book. There are revelation, tons of
[36:04] revelation trapped in the book. It's all
[36:06] the revelation about what names are
[36:08] written on that book. Every revelation
[36:10] has to do with the names. And what is
[36:12] the name? The names are the family of
[36:14] God. the seed line of Christ. The record
[36:18] of the seed
[36:20] is in that book. Amen. So, Adam had it
[36:23] and he lost it and he went back to God.
[36:27] And listen, only thing in that book are
[36:30] names. So, did God write it down because
[36:33] he was afraid he would
[36:37] forget? It's all symbology. It's all
[36:40] meaning something. It's representing
[36:41] something. Amen. And then brother Bam
[36:43] said, "Your name was written in the
[36:46] blood in the ink of the blood of Jesus
[36:47] Christ."
[36:50] But the blood of Jesus Christ, although
[36:52] it was shed in the mind of God, the
[36:54] physical blood wasn't shed until 2,000
[36:56] years ago, but the book was in existence
[36:59] from before the foundation of the world.
[37:02] So what blood? Amen. Because brother
[37:04] Brenham said the blood represents the
[37:06] life. The blood is a representation of
[37:07] the life. So what what ink did he write
[37:10] your name in that book? It was his own
[37:13] life.
[37:16] That's right. His life, the life of God,
[37:19] which is the life of Christ. That is
[37:21] that is how your name is written in the
[37:23] book because you were always intended to
[37:25] share his life.
[37:30] Amen.
[37:32] See, we we get so to me, this is just
[37:36] me, friends. We get so bogged down in
[37:39] literal things and physical things that
[37:41] we don't catch the full revelation of
[37:43] what the prophet is trying to tell us
[37:45] and things become confusing because
[37:47] because it looks like he he uses one
[37:49] type and an analogy one place he'll use
[37:51] another type somewhere else and they
[37:52] look like they're contrasting types and
[37:54] they can't be coexistent at the same
[37:56] time. And the reality is if you don't
[37:58] make it physical and physical locations
[38:01] and physical items, but you make it
[38:03] spiritual truth, they can be
[38:04] simultaneously true at the exact same
[38:06] time.
[38:08] Amen. Because it's a spiritual truth.
[38:13] Now, brother Bam goes on to say here in
[38:15] Revelation
[38:17] 5:1, now the strong angel with a loud
[38:19] voice proclaimed, "Who is worthy? Who is
[38:22] able to to do this?" And then the elder
[38:25] said, "Don't weep for the lion of the
[38:26] tribe of Judah. He is worthy. He has
[38:29] overcome." And he took the book and
[38:31] opened the book and loosed the seals
[38:32] thereof. He never told what happened to
[38:35] them when we hit them. Seven seal being
[38:38] uh being opened right down through the
[38:40] Bible. Watch what took place right in
[38:43] this seven sealed book that we're enter
[38:45] that we're enter now holds the whole
[38:48] mystery of the whole redemption blessing
[38:51] of God. All right, let's stop for a
[38:54] minute. A lot of words, but let's keep
[38:56] it simple. In this seven seal book that
[39:00] we're entering now holds the whole
[39:02] mystery of the whole redemption blessing
[39:04] of God. So in the seven seal
[39:08] book in the
[39:10] book holds the mystery of all the
[39:13] redemption blessings of God. Amen. In
[39:17] the book.
[39:19] But brother Brandham already told us in
[39:21] the church ages there's nothing in the
[39:22] book but names.
[39:29] But the whole mystery of the redemption
[39:33] blessings of God is in the book. But he
[39:36] said the only thing written in the book
[39:39] are names.
[39:42] Means the whole thing is about the
[39:44] names.
[39:46] Amen. The whole thing is about Christ.
[39:48] The whole thing is about God becoming
[39:51] material upon the earth and a family of
[39:54] God and fellowship one with another.
[39:56] That's what the whole book is about.
[39:58] That's the mystery that was sealed up in
[40:00] God from before the foundation of the
[40:02] world. That one desire, the one plan,
[40:04] the one thing he wanted to achieve. And
[40:07] all the Bible and everything written in
[40:08] it and every type and every character is
[40:10] all trying to declare what the mystery
[40:12] of this book is. Amen. Amen. And the
[40:16] whole mystery of the redemption blessing
[40:18] of God, remember, he is the lamb. He's
[40:20] the only one that redeemed it. And
[40:22] remember, it's sealed on the backside of
[40:24] the book, not written within. It's
[40:25] sealed on the backside. And it's not
[40:27] written within. And he was the only one
[40:29] was able to even open the book or to
[40:31] reveal the book or to reveal the seals.
[40:33] The only one that could do it. So this
[40:36] is one thing that we might squabble
[40:38] about this in here. So what brother's
[40:40] talking about is the seven thunders.
[40:42] Amen. which he calls the seals on the
[40:43] back side of the book. He says nothing's
[40:45] written about him. There's nothing
[40:46] written in here in the book because when
[40:49] he goes to the seven thunders in
[40:50] Revelations 10, seven thunders uttered
[40:52] their voice and John said, I was about
[40:54] to write, but the voice from heaven said
[40:56] unto me, write not the what the seven
[40:58] thunders uttered, but seal it up. So
[41:00] that's what brother Bam calls those
[41:02] other seals.
[41:04] What the what the seven thunders said,
[41:06] brother Bam said, we don't know, but we
[41:08] need to know.
[41:10] Amen. So he says, "You can squabble
[41:12] about what's in here, the words that are
[41:14] written in here." But those seals you
[41:16] can't squabble about. You can't argue
[41:17] about because there's nothing written at
[41:19] all. All we know is there was a sound.
[41:21] John heard the sound. John knew what the
[41:24] voice uttered because he was going to
[41:25] write what it said. But he was told not
[41:27] to to seal it up. That's the mysterious
[41:29] seals of the seven thunders. The seals
[41:31] on the back side of the book
[41:34] that nobody knew anything about or could
[41:36] even probe at. Yeah. And only the lamb
[41:40] can open those seals. Amen. Praise God.
[41:46] Are we enjoying the word? Listen, this
[41:48] isn't our first time through this, but
[41:50] every time through it is just as
[41:51] exciting as the first time.
[41:54] This is the day we live in. This is the
[41:56] manifestation of this hour. This is what
[41:58] God has opened for us in this day. Amen.
[42:00] And he did it to give us faith for
[42:02] rapturing grace. Amen. There was
[42:04] something that we needed more than any
[42:06] other age had because nobody came to the
[42:08] resurrection of the dead and the change
[42:10] of the body. But that's going to happen
[42:12] by faith. Amen. It's going to take faith
[42:15] to bring the resurrected saints. It's
[42:17] going to take faith to change our
[42:18] bodies. And God had to do something to
[42:20] unlock another measure of faith. Amen.
[42:23] So that we can move by faith into this
[42:25] manifestation. Amen. And that's what he
[42:28] did in the opening of the seals.
[42:31] We've been looking at it for 60 years.
[42:33] I've only been looking at it for 25, 26
[42:36] years. Amen. But we've been looking at
[42:38] it because it's unfolding and unfolding
[42:40] and unfolding. Amen. Because it's
[42:42] building faith upon faith. Revelation.
[42:44] Brother Brandon said faith is a
[42:46] revelation. And the revelation is
[42:48] bringing faith.
[42:50] Amen. And so God is continually
[42:52] revealing this to
[42:54] us. So we could squabble about this in
[42:57] here. What about this? But he's the one
[42:59] that divinely interprets it. So we can
[43:01] squabble about but in in here the
[43:04] doctrines the loose ends brother talks
[43:06] about we can squabble about that but
[43:08] he's the one who indivinely interprets
[43:10] that. Amen. And he does it through a
[43:12] prophetic ministry in the end time. But
[43:14] on the backside here that's the seven
[43:17] thunders. There's no one can do it. It
[43:19] belongs to him and him alone. And he's
[43:23] the one that can reveal those seven
[43:26] mysteries out and watch how every bit of
[43:29] it is on redemption. How the church was
[43:31] redeemed and what will be the redeeming.
[43:34] So every bit of those seven that seven
[43:37] seal mystery, every bit of those un
[43:39] unveiling of the seals or the opening of
[43:41] the seals has to do with the church.
[43:46] Is that what he said? Amen. Every bit of
[43:49] his own redemption. how the church is
[43:51] redeemed and what will be the redeeming.
[43:54] It has to do with the church.
[43:58] So keep that in your mind as we move
[44:01] forward. These seals, the opening of the
[44:03] seals has to do with the redeeming of
[44:04] the church
[44:09] in the breach. He says, "And revealed as
[44:12] the seals break and are released to us,
[44:14] then we can see what this great plan of
[44:16] redemption is and when and how it's
[44:18] going to be done. It's all hidden in
[44:20] this book of mysteries here. It's sealed
[44:22] up with seven seals. And so the lamb is
[44:26] the only one who can break them. Now he
[44:28] says, "We realize now if you'd like to
[44:31] look in the scriptures, you can get over
[44:33] in Jeremiah and find out there when when
[44:36] he was going into captivity of the land,
[44:39] you know, he he uh bought his uncles his
[44:42] uncle's son and some property and he
[44:45] went through the ceiling. And if you if
[44:47] you took it, we got that also in the
[44:49] seven churches, them seals and so forth
[44:51] in there. So, brother Brandham starts uh
[44:54] pointing it starts in the breach and he
[44:56] goes even into the seals and he keeps
[44:58] pointing back to Jeremiah to this story
[45:00] in Jeremiah. And I've preached on this
[45:02] before and and it thrilled our souls.
[45:05] But I've been I've been looking at it
[45:06] over the last little bit. And as I look
[45:09] at it, all of a sudden, God starts to
[45:11] unlock a whole another understanding out
[45:13] of this story in Jeremiah to me. And it
[45:16] just absolutely thrilled my soul. I
[45:18] actually couldn't wait to get here this
[45:19] morning and tell you because we preached
[45:23] on it before where where where
[45:26] uh he goes in the seals and I took it
[45:28] through the seals through the breach and
[45:29] the first seal and he says in another
[45:31] seal he said, "Look at Jeremiah. Look at
[45:33] Jeremiah. Look at Jeremiah. And he keeps
[45:35] pointing to Jeremiah. So we go back and
[45:37] we look at Jeremiah.
[45:39] Amen. So let's look at the scripture
[45:41] here in Jeremiah. Jeremiah 32 and6. This
[45:44] is the story he's referring to. And
[45:47] Jeremiah
[45:49] said, "The word of the Lord came unto
[45:51] me, saying,
[45:53] Behold, Hanimal the son of Shalom, thine
[45:56] uncle, shall come unto thee, saying, Buy
[45:59] thee my field that is in Anithoth, for
[46:01] the right of redemption is thine to buy
[46:03] it." So this story is about redemption
[46:06] and a kinsman redeemer. Amen. Jeremiah
[46:10] now is the kinsman redeemer. He's
[46:11] playing the part of Christ.
[46:14] Yeah. He's going to redeem family land
[46:17] that was lost and he's the one with the
[46:19] right of redemption. And so he's going
[46:22] to pay the price of redemption.
[46:25] So Hannah, mine uncle's son, came to me
[46:27] in the court of the prison according to
[46:29] the word of the Lord, and said unto me,
[46:31] by my field I pray thee that is in
[46:33] Anithoth, which is in the country of
[46:35] Benjamin, for the right of inheritance
[46:37] is thine, and the redemption is thine.
[46:40] So he Jeremiah has the right of
[46:43] inheritance. Yeah. And he's the one who
[46:47] can redeem it. Amen. That makes him the
[46:49] goel. That makes him the kinsman
[46:51] redeemer. Buy it for thyself. Then I
[46:54] know that this was the word of the Lord.
[46:56] And I bought the field of Hannah, my
[46:58] uncle's son, that was at Anithoth, and
[47:00] weighed him the money, even 17 shekels
[47:02] of silver. And I described the evidence
[47:05] and sealed it and took witness and
[47:07] weighed him the money in the balance. So
[47:09] I took the evidence of the purchase,
[47:11] both that which was sealed according to
[47:13] the law and custom, and that which was
[47:15] open. And I gave the evidence of the
[47:17] purchase unto Baroo, the son of Niah,
[47:20] the son of
[47:23] Measaihile, my uncle's son, and in the
[47:25] presence of the witnesses that
[47:26] subscribed the book of the purchase
[47:28] before all the Jews that sat in the
[47:30] court of prison. And I charged Baroo
[47:32] before them, saying, "Thus sayeth the
[47:34] Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, take
[47:36] these evidences, this evidence of the
[47:38] purchase, both which is sealed and this
[47:41] evidence which is open, and put them in
[47:43] an earthn vessel, that they may contain
[47:45] continue many days. For thus sayeth the
[47:48] Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, houses
[47:50] and fields and vineyards shall be
[47:52] possessed again in this land." So this
[47:56] is the story that brother Brandon's
[47:57] referring to. And in this story, uh, God
[48:01] speaks to Jeremiah and tells him to
[48:03] redeem this land. And so now his kinsman
[48:06] comes to him and says, "We need you to
[48:08] redeem the land for it's your right to
[48:10] inherit. It's your right and position to
[48:13] redeem." So he he redeems it. Amen. He
[48:15] pays the price and he redeems it. And
[48:18] the the price and the purchase and the
[48:21] redemption was all recorded. Yeah. And
[48:24] there was a record that was open.
[48:28] of the redemption and there was a record
[48:30] that was sealed.
[48:33] Just like in the seals, there's a record
[48:35] that's open. It's open by the lamb and
[48:37] you can see a white horse went out and a
[48:39] red horse and a palace, but there's a
[48:40] record in the thunders that's sealed.
[48:43] You can't see what's in them because he
[48:45] was told to seal it up. Even Daniel was
[48:48] told, "Seal this up. Hey, the revelation
[48:50] will be sealed up to the time of the
[48:52] end." Yes.
[48:54] So now we have a open record and a
[48:57] sealed record that has to do with this
[48:59] book over in the book of Revelation. And
[49:01] brother Benham's telling us to look at
[49:02] Jeremiah to understand what's going on
[49:04] in Revelation.
[49:06] It has to do with redemption, the
[49:08] purchase price paid. Amen. The uh the
[49:10] open record and the sealed record. But
[49:12] then he says, "Then it was put in an
[49:14] earthn vessel." Amen. to keep because
[49:17] Jeremiah said, "Hey, hey, Jeremiah
[49:19] said,"For thus sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[49:21] the God of Israel, houses and fields and
[49:23] vineyards shall be possessed again in
[49:24] this land." What's he saying? God had
[49:27] already told him, "You're going to be
[49:28] taken captive this land." Amen. Because
[49:30] they've turned from God is going to go
[49:32] into Babylonian captivity. Amen. But the
[49:35] very fact that you bought the land shows
[49:38] that it's coming back. Amen. The whole
[49:41] point of redemption is, hey, you may go
[49:43] into Babylonian captivity, but you're
[49:45] coming back to this place. And until
[49:48] until you come back to claim what is
[49:51] yours, it's going to be sealed in an
[49:52] earthn vessel. Amen. So that you can
[49:54] come back and claim what you paid for.
[49:57] Amen. So when we get into the seals,
[49:59] brother Bam saying, going to Jeremiah.
[50:01] Well, when we preached this before, we
[50:03] we labored on the open and closed
[50:05] record, the open and closed record, the
[50:07] the the seals, the symbol of the seals,
[50:09] and then the seven thunders. That's
[50:11] right. What was open, everybody could
[50:13] read, what nobody could read because it
[50:15] wasn't
[50:16] written. But then when I go back this
[50:20] time, I start looking at other things
[50:22] brother Brenham says and and I went back
[50:26] to Revelation chapter 5 part 1 and two
[50:29] which is what brother Brenham preached
[50:30] after he preached the revelation of
[50:32] Jesus Christ series. So in 1960 he
[50:34] preaches at the end of 1960 he preaches
[50:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ series
[50:39] finishing in
[50:40] 1961 and then he goes into Revelation
[50:42] chapter 4, Revelation chapter 5 and he
[50:45] stops because he's got to wait until the
[50:49] lamb can come and take the book.
[50:52] So he gets us to this part. And so when
[50:54] I went back and read what he said in
[50:56] Revelation chapter 5, it it just began
[50:58] to open. So I want to look at these
[51:01] names. If you see here, I've got
[51:02] highlighted in yellow and in green and
[51:05] in blue and in uh pink here, it's
[51:08] Hannah. Shalom is father, Anithoth is
[51:12] the land, Benjamin is where the
[51:14] inheritance is. And so when we look at
[51:17] these names, they all have to do with
[51:19] the story of redemption. Hene means God
[51:22] is
[51:23] gracious. Shalom means retribution or
[51:26] recompense. That means to restore
[51:28] everything that's lost.
[51:30] Anith anithoth the land is answered to
[51:33] prayer
[51:34] and Benjamin is son of the right hand
[51:37] which is Christ because he sits on the
[51:40] right hand of the throne of power. Amen.
[51:42] So all of this in the story even all the
[51:45] characters in the story are telling the
[51:47] story of redemption. Amen. Hamill comes
[51:50] to Jeremiah which is God is grace come
[51:53] and redeem. We need grace. We need
[51:55] somebody to pay a price of redemption.
[51:57] Amen. And it's the father's land which
[51:59] is recompense or restoration. Amen.
[52:02] Bringing it back. And the the land is
[52:04] the answer to prayer. Amen. And it's in
[52:07] the nation of Benjamin which is the son
[52:09] of the right hand. So it belongs to
[52:11] Benjamin which is Christ. Amen. Here in
[52:14] the story. And so all of this is playing
[52:18] together for this story of redemption.
[52:22] Now, so in in uh when we get into the
[52:26] seal series, the breach, the first seal,
[52:28] third seal, I think fourth seal too
[52:30] says, "Look at Jeremiah. Look at
[52:32] Jeremiah." So now we've looked at
[52:33] Jeremiah, but now I'm going to go back
[52:35] to Revelation chapter 5 when he preached
[52:38] on this most sublime thing in all of
[52:42] scripture. He says it this way. Now,
[52:44] when Jeremiah wrote this book was
[52:46] sealed, here's a good thing I want you
[52:48] to notice. All of you now that read it
[52:51] in the sealed book. Now remember, he was
[52:54] going to be gone. So Jeremiah was going
[52:56] to go away in this captivity. He had
[52:59] prophesied. Now he didn't know it only
[53:02] through prophecy. As you follow me,
[53:04] through prophecy, he knew through the
[53:05] revelation of God that there was going
[53:07] to be away from the country for 70
[53:09] years. Remember him prophesying that he
[53:12] would be 70 years they'd be in
[53:14] captivity. So he wanted to be sure that
[53:17] this seal that this inheritance would be
[53:19] kept because he had an inheritance, his
[53:22] cousin's inheritance. So he had it all
[53:25] wrote up legally. And what did he do
[53:27] with it? So it would not rust. He put it
[53:31] in an earthly vessel and put it away so
[53:34] it wouldn't rot or rust until them 70
[53:38] years was expired.
[53:40] Glory to God. I hope you could catch it.
[53:42] Do you see what God did? He never
[53:44] revealed it to the highs and the prudent
[53:46] so they could fuss about it for all this
[53:49] time. But he put it in an earthly
[53:51] vessel. And listen, listen what he says
[53:53] next. And he created himself his own
[53:56] son, Christ Jesus. And in this last day,
[53:58] now he's opening the seals and showing
[54:01] it to the church, kept in an earthly
[54:03] vessel, so it wouldn't rot or rust.
[54:05] Hallelujah. Oh, I know you think I'm a
[54:07] holy roller. Maybe I am. You see, but
[54:09] there it is. It's been kept wrapped in
[54:12] the vessel of the earth that was
[54:14] redeemed out of the earth. Come up on
[54:16] Easter morning where death seals could
[54:18] not hold him any longer. But he broke
[54:20] the seals and rose up proving himself in
[54:23] these last days that he is alive. He is
[54:25] he's in his church. He's the same
[54:28] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[54:29] that's been hid from the seminaries.
[54:31] It's been hid from the organizations.
[54:33] And in his last days, he's revealing it
[54:35] by his own presence among his people.
[54:38] He's getting somebody that he can get
[54:39] the world out of them and things out of
[54:41] them, the churchian out of them so he
[54:44] can speak through them and reveal and
[54:46] open these seals like like this himself.
[54:52] So all of a sudden when I went back to
[54:54] this, I'm going to read you a few more.
[54:55] When I went back to this, I started to
[54:57] understand what was we see what the seal
[54:59] of the open record are. We see the price
[55:01] of redemption pay. Christ paid the price
[55:04] of redemption. Amen. The seals, amen,
[55:06] hold the mystery of it. Amen. The the
[55:08] seals, there's an open and closed
[55:09] record. We see the book in the book of
[55:11] Revelation. But brother Bam said, "Go to
[55:13] Jeremiah." And then he starts to labor
[55:15] on the fact that so this didn't get
[55:16] lost. So the revelation didn't get lost.
[55:19] He put it in an earthn vessel. And that
[55:22] earthn vessel is Jesus Christ. This
[55:24] mystery book is in Christ. It's in
[55:28] Jesus. But I thought the Bible said it's
[55:30] in the hand of the original owner.
[55:33] Listen, don't get too hard and fast on
[55:36] physical things. Let the revelation
[55:38] strike your mind because where is Jesus
[55:40] sitting on the right hand of the father?
[55:43] It's not a different person. It's not a
[55:45] different place. It's all one and the
[55:47] same.
[55:49] Amen. The book went back to the right
[55:51] hand which is authority and power
[55:52] because he alone controls
[55:56] this book. He's the one who gave it to
[55:58] Adam. And when Adam lost it, he took
[56:00] control over this book himself. He's in
[56:03] control of the book. Amen. And now he
[56:06] hid this book.
[56:10] He placed it in an earthn vessel so that
[56:12] in the Babylonian captivity of the
[56:15] church when they went into Catholicism
[56:17] and denominations and got led captive,
[56:19] the truth would not be lost because the
[56:21] truth of this book is in Jesus Christ.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:28] That's where he's kept it all this time
[56:30] in the earth and vessel. And this is
[56:32] what brother Bram's talking about by go
[56:34] to Jeremiah. Go to Jeremiah. Go to
[56:36] Jeremiah. That's why he's the only one
[56:38] that can open these seals because he is
[56:41] those seals. He is the mystery of the
[56:43] book. The book is writing of him. Amen.
[56:47] The book is in him. He's the one
[56:49] concealing it and holding it and
[56:51] guarding it until the right hour.
[56:55] Amen. Oh, praise be to
[56:58] God. You go on further this message says
[57:03] the seven and last one of these seals
[57:05] when they're open, he's found in in
[57:07] Revelation the chapter 10, there was a
[57:09] mighty
[57:10] angel. This is the seventh
[57:13] seal. The seventh and last one of these
[57:15] seals has everything to do with
[57:17] Revelations 10. Amen.
[57:21] this there was a mighty angel which was
[57:22] Christ come down and put one foot on the
[57:24] land one on the sea raises up his hand
[57:26] and says the day is finished time has
[57:28] run out it's all over time shall be no
[57:31] more and he said at the sounding of this
[57:34] at this time the mystery of God should
[57:36] be finished when God is who God is and
[57:40] how he was made
[57:41] manifest. So what's the mystery to be
[57:44] finished? who God is and how he's made
[57:47] manifest.
[57:49] That's what's in this book. Who God is
[57:52] and how he's made manifest. But brother
[57:55] Chad, you said, Brother Bam said only
[57:57] names are in the book. That's the only
[57:58] thing in the book. Amen. The mystery of
[58:01] who God is and how he's made manifest is
[58:04] hidden in this book. And the only thing
[58:06] in this book are the names
[58:10] of the Christ seed.
[58:15] who God is and how he was made manifest.
[58:18] How when that seal was opened, how we
[58:21] begin to understand now how that he was
[58:23] the son of God. He was God himself made
[58:28] flesh and the revelation of who he is
[58:31] that should be finished before this
[58:33] angel can put his feet upon the land and
[58:35] sea and swear that there'll be time no
[58:37] more. When this time comes, we're right
[58:39] in the front yard of it right now. He's
[58:42] in 1961. He finished the the church
[58:44] ages. He's getting ready to move into
[58:46] the seals. And he's standing in the
[58:48] breach in Revelation chapter 4 and
[58:50] chapter 5, which is the breach, the link
[58:51] between the two. And the link between
[58:53] the two, Amen, is Jesus Christ, the man.
[58:57] Amen.
[58:59] He says, "Now,
[59:01] now what's got to be revealed under this
[59:04] seventh seal, this last seal, this
[59:07] mystery, is who God is and how he was
[59:09] made manifest. and that he was the son
[59:12] of God and he was God himself made
[59:14] flesh.
[59:16] So what is this great mystery that's in
[59:19] this book? It's of God and how he's made
[59:22] manifest. Well, that mystery came forth
[59:25] in the son of God because Jesus Christ
[59:29] was God
[59:31] in the flesh. Amen.
[59:36] Jesus
[59:37] Christ. Jesus Christ was declaring what
[59:41] was in the book.
[59:43] Amen. His very life was the contents of
[59:47] the book
[59:49] in an earthn vessel.
[59:52] Displaying to the world of what was in
[59:54] the back of God's mind.
[59:58] And where was the book?
[1:00:05] Because all that's in the book would be
[1:00:07] Christ. Brother V said and he said and
[1:00:10] that's the believer the words in the
[1:00:12] book.
[1:00:14] But the only thing in the book is names.
[1:00:16] The only thing in the book is people who
[1:00:17] would come forth. That's the contents of
[1:00:19] the book. But the contents of the book
[1:00:22] is the mystery of who God is and how
[1:00:24] he's going to be made manifest. But the
[1:00:26] only thing in the book are names. And
[1:00:28] here comes Jesus Christ, the fullness of
[1:00:30] this book made flesh. And in him is
[1:00:33] everything that's in the book. And where
[1:00:35] were you when brother Bam said, "Where
[1:00:36] were you when he went to Calvary?" I was
[1:00:38] in him then because I'm part of the
[1:00:41] book. And he was the manifestation of
[1:00:42] the book. And the book was put in flesh.
[1:00:44] And he was the flesh man displaying the
[1:00:47] contents of the book. And where was I?
[1:00:49] If I'm a word in the book and part of
[1:00:51] the word, I was there then in that
[1:00:54] vessel.
[1:01:00] Oh, this book. Now you know why brother
[1:01:02] talk about the seals. The opening of the
[1:01:03] seals. My Bible became a new book.
[1:01:05] Everything changed at the opening of the
[1:01:06] seals. It's the revelation. It's the
[1:01:08] mystery of God finished.
[1:01:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's not all the
[1:01:14] information that we think is the
[1:01:16] information. It's what's laying under
[1:01:17] the information is the revelation of
[1:01:19] God. Remember, I just want to explain
[1:01:21] this to you. If you take a book and you
[1:01:24] roll up the book like a scroll like
[1:01:25] brother Brandham described it, this book
[1:01:27] has information
[1:01:29] names.
[1:01:31] The book is a record of life. Yeah.
[1:01:34] Right.
[1:01:36] But around the book is a seal.
[1:01:40] The seal is not the book.
[1:01:46] The
[1:01:47] seal prevents you from seeing what's in
[1:01:50] the book. Right. That's right.
[1:01:56] So the opening of the
[1:01:59] seals unlocks what's under the seals,
[1:02:03] which is the content of the book. So
[1:02:05] it's not the information of the seals is
[1:02:07] the mystery. It's what the seals were
[1:02:10] hiding from us for seven church ages is
[1:02:13] what the mystery is. And the mystery is
[1:02:16] who God is and how he manifests himself
[1:02:19] on the earth.
[1:02:22] So when we open these seals, we've got
[1:02:24] we got interpretation of symbols. We've
[1:02:26] got information. We've got how the
[1:02:28] church has been moving down through time
[1:02:30] and how the antichrist spirit come in
[1:02:32] and and what did the antichrist spirit
[1:02:34] start to do? It started to keep the true
[1:02:36] revelation from the people by obscuring
[1:02:38] the word. Amen. Then what God would do,
[1:02:40] God would send an anointing of the Holy
[1:02:42] Ghost to combat that evil, to keep his
[1:02:44] people on the right path. But he never
[1:02:46] fully let the secret out till the end
[1:02:48] time. And what were the seals doing? The
[1:02:50] seals were actually keeping the
[1:02:52] revelation from the people,
[1:02:55] right? So the opening of the seals
[1:02:57] unlocked and unloosed the book. And when
[1:02:59] the book was loosed, I was loose cuz I
[1:03:02] was in the book. Not a seal, but the
[1:03:04] seal was hiding my true identity under
[1:03:08] denominationalism under the failure of
[1:03:10] the church, under the Catholic system,
[1:03:12] under Babylonian rule. But all this
[1:03:15] time, God had this book secure so it
[1:03:18] wouldn't rot cuz he paid the price
[1:03:20] before we went into Babylonian
[1:03:22] captivity.
[1:03:24] He paid the price before the church
[1:03:26] ages. He paid the price before the
[1:03:28] falling away. He paid the price before
[1:03:30] the 19th council because he is a prophet
[1:03:32] knows it's going to go in the 19
[1:03:34] council. I've got to put this record. I
[1:03:36] got to show it in the book of John, but
[1:03:38] I got to seal this record up. And I
[1:03:40] sealed the contents up in an earthn
[1:03:42] vessel. Amen.
[1:03:46] So that we wouldn't lose the revelation.
[1:03:52] Listen, the earthn vessel isn't a hiding
[1:03:55] place that you dig a hole and you put in
[1:03:58] the ground like a treasure. The earth
[1:04:00] and
[1:04:01] vessel is Jesus Christ.
[1:04:07] It's Jesus Christ.
[1:04:10] That means since the beginning of the
[1:04:14] church dispensation of the
[1:04:17] bride, this mystery has been secure in
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ. Amen. What is the mystery?
[1:04:26] God becoming flesh.
[1:04:30] And for
[1:04:31] seven church ages, the mysteryy's been
[1:04:35] secure in Jesus. When you see Jesus, you
[1:04:38] see God's plan.
[1:04:40] It was safe in the flesh of Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ. The word made flesh.
[1:04:47] It wouldn't rot. It wouldn't rust. As
[1:04:49] long as God come and took on flesh
[1:04:51] before the falling away. Amen. This
[1:04:54] mysterious book was secure in him
[1:04:56] because in him was the revelation of
[1:04:59] that book.
[1:05:01] And it couldn't get lost as long as we
[1:05:04] knew God came in flesh.
[1:05:10] This isn't about information or a church
[1:05:13] or a system or this is about the great
[1:05:16] plan of God wanting to become a family
[1:05:18] upon the earth.
[1:05:27] says again in Revelation chapter 5, you
[1:05:29] love him with all your heart. You
[1:05:31] understand now what the sevensealed book
[1:05:33] was. What is it? We got it in a scroll
[1:05:36] now. And you just remember just in these
[1:05:38] last days I it was kept in an earthly
[1:05:40] vessel. You understand now who was that
[1:05:43] earthly vessel? Jesus Christ. No man had
[1:05:46] it. Nobody had it. It's only through
[1:05:48] him. It wasn't even written in the word.
[1:05:50] If it was written in the word, it was
[1:05:52] hid so that you couldn't even find it.
[1:05:54] That's right. So, it's in him that it's
[1:05:57] revealed.
[1:05:59] You get that? It's in him that it's
[1:06:02] revealed.
[1:06:04] And in that earthly vessel so it
[1:06:06] wouldn't rot or rust.
[1:06:12] Oh, praise
[1:06:13] God. Listen, before I read further,
[1:06:16] listen. Where was this book sealed and
[1:06:19] hidden? It was hidden in Jesus Christ.
[1:06:21] Yeah. But the Bible said it was in the
[1:06:24] right hand of him that sat on the
[1:06:26] throne.
[1:06:30] Brother Bram said, "Put on your
[1:06:31] spiritual jackets." Right?
[1:06:34] Put on your spiritual jackets. We're not
[1:06:37] looking at two people here, friends.
[1:06:38] Amen.
[1:06:41] And then he comes and he pulls back one
[1:06:43] to his church and said, "See, I'm the
[1:06:44] same yesterday, today, and forever. See,
[1:06:46] and now you've always wondered whether
[1:06:48] the poor sinner would burn for
[1:06:51] eternal. What's he talking about now?
[1:06:54] Whether the poor sinner would burn or he
[1:06:57] would just become annihilated after a
[1:06:58] million years. Here it is. That's how it
[1:07:00] was. There's no such a thing as eternal
[1:07:02] hell. Couldn't be eternal cuz hell
[1:07:05] wasn't with me when I began backyonder.
[1:07:07] I created it to punish the wicked. And
[1:07:08] what are you so scared about? See about
[1:07:10] Abraham's seed and all these different
[1:07:12] things. That's just the outline of it.
[1:07:14] See, but when you get into how God God
[1:07:16] opening up them seals and showing it
[1:07:19] come right on down, you see when you do,
[1:07:21] then you can't get away from this book.
[1:07:25] So, what's he saying? Brother Bam starts
[1:07:27] making statements that are are puzzling
[1:07:29] sometimes. They puzzled me for years. He
[1:07:31] talked about the things that were under
[1:07:33] laying under those seals. And he said,
[1:07:34] "Laying under those seals was serpent
[1:07:36] seed, Godhead, baptism, water baptism in
[1:07:39] Jesus' name, the correct teaching of
[1:07:40] water baptism, correct understanding of
[1:07:42] Godhead, who Christ was." And and
[1:07:44] Brother Bam says all that was laying
[1:07:46] under them seals.
[1:07:49] But when Brother Bam opened the seals,
[1:07:51] he started to explain what a white horse
[1:07:53] rider was and what happened in the
[1:07:55] church ages and how the Antichrist
[1:07:57] spirit moved in and how the church went
[1:07:59] off and how God was protecting his elect
[1:08:00] through the church. He he brother
[1:08:02] Brandham had been teaching serpent seed
[1:08:04] for decades before he opened the seals.
[1:08:07] He had been teaching the godhead before
[1:08:09] he opened the seals. He had been
[1:08:10] teaching water baptism in Jesus' name
[1:08:12] before he opened the seals. So he said
[1:08:14] that was the mystery laying under the
[1:08:16] seals.
[1:08:18] Has anybody else scratched their head?
[1:08:20] Because it wasn't like he opened the
[1:08:22] seals then he taught serpent seed. Yeah.
[1:08:24] He opened the seals then he taught God.
[1:08:26] He already taught it. But he said that
[1:08:27] mystery was laying under the seals.
[1:08:30] Oh friends, that means God was already
[1:08:33] before the opening of the seals letting
[1:08:35] out the secret that was in the book
[1:08:37] through a prophetic ministry for
[1:08:39] decades. He's already showing us serpent
[1:08:41] seed. What's serpent seed have to do
[1:08:43] with the book? Serpent seed has
[1:08:44] everything to do with the book because
[1:08:46] now you found out that I wasn't born in
[1:08:48] a hybrid. I was supposed to come another
[1:08:50] way. I'm a seed gene of God and my name
[1:08:52] is on the book and serpent seed is why I
[1:08:54] feel the way I do and I struggle the way
[1:08:56] I do and I have problems like I do and
[1:08:58] I'm all messed up cuz serpent seed is
[1:09:01] part of the mystery that's laying under
[1:09:03] the seals how you came wrong what you
[1:09:05] should have come like and where you were
[1:09:07] supposed to be where you come from where
[1:09:08] you going it's all locked up in serpent
[1:09:10] seed and the ministry of godhead amen
[1:09:12] and who Jesus Christ was so before he
[1:09:15] opened the seals he was letting the
[1:09:17] contents hidden under the seals Amen
[1:09:19] Yes.
[1:09:21] You mean if you open that book, it says
[1:09:23] serpent seed means XYZ. No. The only
[1:09:26] thing on the book are names.
[1:09:29] Amen. Serpent seed explains what
[1:09:33] happened to these names.
[1:09:35] Godhead teaches whose these names are.
[1:09:41] Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] Praise be to God. For years I've tried
[1:09:46] to correlate what what does he mean?
[1:09:49] serpent seed was under the seals.
[1:09:54] You go and read the seals and he doesn't
[1:09:56] teach the doctrine of serpent seed. He's
[1:09:57] already taught it.
[1:10:02] Amen. Because there was one mystery, one
[1:10:06] goal, one plan, one thing God wanted to
[1:10:08] achieve and he wanted to become a family
[1:10:10] upon this earth in fellowship with one
[1:10:12] another. And that's what he's redeeming
[1:10:14] back through a fe three-fold plan. He's
[1:10:16] bringing back the last Adam, Christ.
[1:10:18] Amen. And he brought him back. Now he's
[1:10:20] bringing back Christ's bride. Amen. To
[1:10:22] re reunite them together in harmony as
[1:10:25] one to restore back the Eden condition
[1:10:27] in a millennial reign. That's what
[1:10:29] redemption's all about. It's about the
[1:10:31] names in the book coming back to their
[1:10:33] place.
[1:10:35] What derailed it? What he did to fix it?
[1:10:38] What we're learning through it all.
[1:10:39] Amen. All that's happened and bringing
[1:10:41] it back to what was his original
[1:10:42] intention. Yes. That's the mystery under
[1:10:45] the book.
[1:10:48] Praise be to God. Listen, there's so we
[1:10:51] could dive into every avenue of this,
[1:10:54] spend weeks on all of this, but listen,
[1:10:56] the reality is this
[1:10:58] mystery, this book for 2,000 years was
[1:11:03] secure in Jesus Christ.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:08] What do you mean? Like, how did did he
[1:11:11] put it inside of him? And is there a
[1:11:13] trap door with a key?
[1:11:16] No. The very fact that he was God in
[1:11:19] flesh
[1:11:20] was holding the mystery secure
[1:11:24] cuz the mystery is God becoming flesh.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] So we could see it in Jesus Christ.
[1:11:32] Although through the churches get
[1:11:33] obscure. We weren't really sure second
[1:11:34] person, first person, all this. But we
[1:11:36] still, it was holding that truth so that
[1:11:39] the end time, he could take the veil off
[1:11:42] of the word so that we could see we're
[1:11:44] part of that truth, too.
[1:11:49] Praise
[1:11:51] God. Praise be to
[1:11:54] God. I'm so full of the
[1:11:57] matter. It's so real to me, friends.
[1:12:00] It's becoming more real every day. And
[1:12:02] the more real it becomes, the more
[1:12:03] simple it becomes. Amen. It's so simple,
[1:12:07] friends. We've made it so hard trying to
[1:12:09] add interpretations and understand
[1:12:11] things and make calculations and 2 plus
[1:12:13] 2 equals 4. Hey, listen. That's that's
[1:12:15] not how it works with God.
[1:12:18] How it works with God is I'll show it to
[1:12:20] you here and I'll show it to you here
[1:12:21] and I'll show it to you here and I'll
[1:12:22] show it to you here. And they're all
[1:12:23] different types and they're all
[1:12:24] different forms, but they're all telling
[1:12:25] you the same story.
[1:12:27] Yeah. But I thought it was an arc and I
[1:12:30] No, I thought it was a flood. And then I
[1:12:32] thought it was this and I thought it was
[1:12:33] that and I thought it was a book but I
[1:12:35] thought it was in Jesus. I thought it
[1:12:36] was the seals. I I thought I show it to
[1:12:39] you here and then I'll show it to you
[1:12:40] here and then I'll show it to you here.
[1:12:42] And I keep changing the way I show it to
[1:12:44] you and I use different symbols and I
[1:12:45] use different name and I use different
[1:12:47] way and it's in my right hand. No, it's
[1:12:48] in Jesus Christ. And
[1:12:52] amen. But I can't correlate. It's in his
[1:12:54] hand and it's in Jesus. I can't put
[1:12:56] those two together. No, listen. You
[1:12:58] misunderstand. He's not saying amen.
[1:13:00] It's got to be here. here. It's got to
[1:13:01] be there. He says, "I'm showing it to
[1:13:02] you here, and I'm showing it to you
[1:13:03] here, and I'm showing it to you here,
[1:13:05] and I'm showing it to you here, so that
[1:13:07] something will go off inside of you and
[1:13:08] say, "It's the same thing. It's all the
[1:13:11] same story. It's the same revelation.
[1:13:13] It's the same truth."
[1:13:15] That's why he said the seventh seal.
[1:13:17] Amen. He couldn't let it out. He
[1:13:19] couldn't tell it. No, it would do great
[1:13:20] damage. But he showed it in every type
[1:13:23] that's in the Bible. All the way back in
[1:13:26] the book of Genesis, this truth has been
[1:13:28] coming up these seals.
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:32] Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] And we get confused because he said it's
[1:13:36] in his hand. No, he said there's only
[1:13:38] names in it. No, he said it's in Jesus.
[1:13:41] Well, the Bible says it's in his hand.
[1:13:43] Brother Brandham says it's he secured in
[1:13:45] the earth and vessel Jesus. I'll take
[1:13:47] what the Bible said, not what the
[1:13:48] prophet said.
[1:13:51] When you put the prophet in
[1:13:52] contradiction to the Bible, you have no
[1:13:54] idea who a prophet is and what God's
[1:13:56] doing. Amen. There's no contradiction.
[1:13:58] And he's showing it to you in another
[1:14:00] picture. The same thing in another
[1:14:02] picture. He's not contradicting the
[1:14:04] word. He's revealing the word cuz Jesus
[1:14:07] always revealed the word through symbols
[1:14:09] and types and parables.
[1:14:14] Oh, praise God.
[1:14:16] Praise be to
[1:14:18] God. This is why brother Ramy gets done
[1:14:20] with the seals. He said, "My Bible
[1:14:22] became a new book. Oh, the glorious
[1:14:23] thing. Oh, to know these things in this
[1:14:25] end time, friends." Amen.
[1:14:29] Praise God.
[1:14:32] He says in the breach
[1:14:34] now the whole thing here the seven seals
[1:14:37] got the mystery of God from the
[1:14:39] foundation of the world all sealed up in
[1:14:42] there and revealed by seven different
[1:14:45] seals that if God willing, let us pull
[1:14:47] back those seals and look down through
[1:14:49] the book and find out what it's all been
[1:14:51] about. I hope we have a great time.
[1:14:55] Brother Bim says those seals sealed up
[1:14:57] the entire Bible. When those seals open,
[1:15:00] it opened up the entire
[1:15:02] Bible. But I thought the only thing
[1:15:04] sealed was this scroll with names in
[1:15:10] it. That's what he's been showing in the
[1:15:12] Bible.
[1:15:14] His
[1:15:15] coming, his plan, his desire.
[1:15:20] It's the same thing. Yes. What's
[1:15:22] difference between the Bible and the
[1:15:24] seven scroll book? Nothing.
[1:15:27] Oh, this he shows it in stories and
[1:15:30] allegorories and lives of his
[1:15:34] children. But it's the same thing. It's
[1:15:37] the mystery of his coming. It's the
[1:15:39] mystery of God. It's been sealed up. We
[1:15:42] could read it, but we didn't understand
[1:15:43] what it was all about. We didn't know
[1:15:44] what the story of Esther was about. We
[1:15:46] didn't know what story of Ruth was
[1:15:47] about. We didn't know what all these
[1:15:48] things were actually about. Yeah. Right.
[1:15:51] But at the opening of the seals, all of
[1:15:52] a sudden, he took the veil off the
[1:15:53] Bible. And we could go back. We could
[1:15:55] see that there was going to be uh uh
[1:15:57] that there had to become a mighty
[1:15:58] prophet. We could see, amen, that there
[1:16:00] was going to be a restoration. We can
[1:16:01] see there's going to be a redemption.
[1:16:03] Amen. But what so many missed is that
[1:16:05] redemption was God himself coming down
[1:16:07] and taking on flesh and paying the price
[1:16:09] of redemption himself. It was him
[1:16:12] made flesh. And then part of him was a
[1:16:15] bride because that's what he declared
[1:16:17] when he made the first masterpiece
[1:16:18] family in the Garden of Eden. He already
[1:16:20] foreshwn everything he's going to do at
[1:16:22] the end. So now everybody saw Christ
[1:16:24] coming and some believed it was God and
[1:16:26] some believed it was part of God or some
[1:16:27] other apparition. Amen. But the true
[1:16:30] revelation is this was God and all that
[1:16:32] God was he poured into Christ and he was
[1:16:35] God. Amen. He was the express image of
[1:16:38] God. He was declaring God. He was
[1:16:40] declaring the mystery of God. He was
[1:16:42] declaring the desire of God. He was
[1:16:44] declaring the plan of God. Amen.
[1:16:49] But in him was another expression too,
[1:16:52] which would be a bride because there had
[1:16:54] to be a restoration to what was fallen
[1:16:55] in Eden. And that was the mystery that
[1:16:58] got lost in the church ages.
[1:17:02] But that mystery was safe in the earthn
[1:17:04] vessel.
[1:17:07] The last Adam. If there's a last Adam,
[1:17:09] there's got to be a last bride, wife,
[1:17:14] part of Adam.
[1:17:17] So it wouldn't get lost when the church
[1:17:19] went into Babylon. He put it in an
[1:17:22] earthn vessel and secured the
[1:17:26] revelation until she comes back out of
[1:17:29] Babylon.
[1:17:31] When did Jeremiah pay the price? Before
[1:17:34] it went to Babylon.
[1:17:36] When did they claim the inheritance?
[1:17:38] After they returned. Amen. That's why
[1:17:41] this is the claiming ministry. Now, he's
[1:17:42] come down to claim his bride, which is
[1:17:44] you and I. Amen. After we've come out of
[1:17:47] Babylon,
[1:17:49] let's go on and read this. I don't even
[1:17:50] know where I'm at in this. And the whole
[1:17:52] thing here, the seven seals, got the
[1:17:54] mystery of God from the foundation of
[1:17:55] the world all sealed up in there and
[1:17:57] revealed by seven different seals. If
[1:17:59] God willing, let us pull back those
[1:18:01] seals and look down through the book and
[1:18:02] find out what it's all about. I hope we
[1:18:04] have a great time there. The mystery of
[1:18:07] redemption is sealed until the book
[1:18:09] could not be broken until the last
[1:18:11] angel's message. The scrolls there. We
[1:18:13] know it was there. We know that it was
[1:18:15] redemption. We believed it was
[1:18:17] redemption. Jeremiah said, "This scroll
[1:18:19] must be kept." As you read it there,
[1:18:22] he'd say, "It must be kept in earthly
[1:18:24] vessel." See, oh, what a beautiful thing
[1:18:26] there. I could talk about a while. The
[1:18:28] scroll was kept in an earthly vessel. a
[1:18:30] vessel that once became flesh. Glory.
[1:18:33] Died, rose again, and kept in the
[1:18:34] earthly vessel until the time of
[1:18:36] purchase. Oh my, beautiful. All right.
[1:18:39] Now, these messages are all kept up into
[1:18:41] this earthly vessel until the time of
[1:18:43] God's appointed time at the last
[1:18:46] messenger of the earth. Oh, praise God.
[1:18:50] The first seal, he says, "Did you get to
[1:18:51] study in Jeremiah?" He keeps wanting to
[1:18:53] point us to Jeremiah
[1:18:56] how he wrote that. Many of you taking it
[1:18:58] down last night. how them seals were
[1:19:00] wrote and placed away for keeping until
[1:19:02] he returned after the 70 years of
[1:19:04] captivity. He was to return back and
[1:19:07] claimed his possession. That's where
[1:19:09] we're at right now. This is the claiming
[1:19:11] ministry. He's claiming what he died
[1:19:13] for, what he paid for. And now at the
[1:19:15] end of the church ages, there's a return
[1:19:17] out of Babylonian denominational wrong
[1:19:19] understanding. That's what the opening
[1:19:21] of the seals is all about. It's taking
[1:19:23] away the thing that hindered us from
[1:19:25] seeing the revelation. And the thing
[1:19:27] that hindered us was that Antichrist
[1:19:29] spirit through the seven church ages.
[1:19:31] And at the end of time, he's taking the
[1:19:33] seals off to explain what happened, what
[1:19:35] went wrong, what he's been doing, so
[1:19:37] that we could get to the real mystery.
[1:19:44] And the real mystery is she is him.
[1:19:47] Amen.
[1:19:50] Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] That's the real mystery that was laying
[1:19:55] under the seals.
[1:19:58] Listen, I just want to say this
[1:20:02] again. The mystery is in the
[1:20:05] book. The seal is on the book
[1:20:10] to keep the book from being seen.
[1:20:14] Amen. Do you understand?
[1:20:17] So when we take the seals off the book,
[1:20:19] which has everything to do with the
[1:20:21] church ages and the confusion and the
[1:20:24] spirits and the two spirits, the two
[1:20:27] vines, how Satan was working, how God
[1:20:29] was combating, how he redeemed the Jews,
[1:20:32] how he would redeem the foolish virgin,
[1:20:34] and how all these things would happen.
[1:20:35] It was all wrapped around here. But when
[1:20:37] he peeled that off, now we could finally
[1:20:41] see into the book again.
[1:20:44] So the mystery of the book is not the
[1:20:46] interpretation of the seals. It's what
[1:20:49] the seals have been hiding from us.
[1:20:53] Amen. And the seals have been hiding
[1:20:55] from us our true identity.
[1:20:59] It's not a church. It's a bride. It's
[1:21:02] not a system. It's not an idea. It's not
[1:21:05] a following a rule. It's not any of
[1:21:07] that. It's Jesus Christ
[1:21:10] himself becoming his own bride. Amen.
[1:21:14] God manifest on the earth. God becoming
[1:21:16] a family. God unifying back what fell in
[1:21:19] Eden. That's what the mysteryy's been in
[1:21:22] the
[1:21:23] book. He returned back to claim his
[1:21:26] possession. I certainly like to study
[1:21:28] it. There's no way to express it all
[1:21:30] because it's an eternal word. It's an
[1:21:32] eternal book.
[1:21:34] It's a book that transcends language.
[1:21:37] It's a ch it's a book. It's a book that
[1:21:39] goes beyond the symbols of the book.
[1:21:41] It's deeper than the symbols. It's
[1:21:42] deeper.
[1:21:44] It's the mystery of God.
[1:21:48] And his presence said, "But when on the
[1:21:50] back of the book is sealed with seven
[1:21:52] seals, Daniel heard the voice of the
[1:21:53] thunders and was forbidden to write it."
[1:21:55] John was forbidden to write it, but it
[1:21:57] was sealed on the backside of the book
[1:21:59] that it was after all the mysteries of
[1:22:01] the book has been given out and
[1:22:02] revealed. Now, notice Daniel said there,
[1:22:04] the mystery in the days of these voices,
[1:22:06] the mystery of God should be unfolded at
[1:22:08] that time. See the mystery, who God is,
[1:22:12] what's the mystery that's be unfolded?
[1:22:15] Who God is, how he was made flesh, all
[1:22:19] these things should be unfolded by that
[1:22:21] time.
[1:22:22] What's really laying under the seals,
[1:22:25] who God is, and how he was made flesh.
[1:22:29] Amen. Amen. And we're ready for the
[1:22:32] seven seals on the back side of the
[1:22:33] book. that's not even revealed to men,
[1:22:35] not even wrote in the Bible, but they'll
[1:22:37] have to be just exactly compared with
[1:22:38] the rest of the Bible. And I think it'll
[1:22:40] be a great thing.
[1:22:44] And in the message, is this the sign of
[1:22:46] the end? So, he said, "The seventh
[1:22:47] angel, Revelation 10:7, is the seventh
[1:22:50] church age messenger." See, now watch.
[1:22:52] In the days, now what? In the days of
[1:22:54] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:22:55] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:22:57] should be finished. Revelation 10:7. The
[1:23:00] mystery of God. The mystery of God.
[1:23:02] Amen. All mysteries unlock this mystery.
[1:23:07] But this is the mystery of the book.
[1:23:10] Are there mysteries? Yes. But the
[1:23:12] mysteries all have to do with this
[1:23:13] mystery.
[1:23:15] What is the mystery of serpent seed? The
[1:23:18] mystery of serpent seed has everything
[1:23:19] to do with this mystery.
[1:23:23] Amen.
[1:23:26] Now, sounding forth this messenger, the
[1:23:28] seventh angel here is sounding forth his
[1:23:30] message to the Leodysian church. Notice
[1:23:33] his type of message. It wasn't to the
[1:23:34] first angel. Wasn't given that second
[1:23:36] angel, third, fourth, fifth, sixth. But
[1:23:38] it is the seventh angel that had this
[1:23:40] type of message. What was it? Notice his
[1:23:43] type of message finishing all the
[1:23:45] mysteries of God that are written in the
[1:23:46] book. The seventh angel is winding up
[1:23:48] all the mysteries that's laying loose
[1:23:50] ended all out through these
[1:23:52] organizations and denominations. The
[1:23:54] seventh angel gathers them up and
[1:23:56] finishes the entire mystery. That's what
[1:23:59] the Bible said finishes the mystery of
[1:24:01] the written book. What is the mystery of
[1:24:04] this book? The seventh seal. The coming
[1:24:08] of the Lord. God becoming flesh upon the
[1:24:10] earth. Amen.
[1:24:16] God let it strike our hearts deeper and
[1:24:19] deeper and deeper. Amen. Souls that are
[1:24:23] in prison now. He says, "But one day he
[1:24:24] rose from there, come forth. Where was
[1:24:26] the book at?" It was still in the
[1:24:28] abstract owner, God Almighty. And John
[1:24:29] looked around and he wept because there
[1:24:31] was no man even worthy to look on the
[1:24:33] book and especially open the seals to
[1:24:35] reveal what the hidden mystery was. The
[1:24:36] mystery was in the seven seals. When
[1:24:38] these seven seals was opened, that
[1:24:40] opened up the entire Bible. The seven
[1:24:43] seals, it was sealed with seven
[1:24:44] mysteries. And these seven seals held
[1:24:47] the entire mystery of it. And it was the
[1:24:50] book of redemption, New Testament.
[1:24:55] Did you read what I read?
[1:24:58] Not the old and only proclaimed for the
[1:25:01] new.
[1:25:04] Does anybody else read things like that
[1:25:05] and be like, I don't know what he's
[1:25:06] talking
[1:25:07] about cuz I thought it was the whole
[1:25:10] book. And now he's saying it's not the
[1:25:13] old, it's just the New Testament. That's
[1:25:14] this book is the New Testament. And all
[1:25:17] of a sudden, you know, we got a conundr
[1:25:19] because because now we've got to solve
[1:25:22] out what he's talking about. He's been
[1:25:23] saying the whole book, my Bible became a
[1:25:25] new book. He goes back and he's teaching
[1:25:26] of the Old Testament, but he says this
[1:25:28] book of redemption is the New Testament.
[1:25:32] Oh, let's put on our spiritual jackets.
[1:25:37] Listen. He says, "And he that is in
[1:25:39] you," now there it is scientifically
[1:25:41] proved that it is the truth. So
[1:25:43] therefore, we don't worry about whether
[1:25:45] it's truth. both scientific and
[1:25:46] spiritual. What was said come to pass.
[1:25:49] So the message of the seven seals in
[1:25:50] their closing, that's the message of the
[1:25:52] entire Bible.
[1:25:55] I thought he just said it was New
[1:25:56] Testament.
[1:25:58] Did the prophet make a mistake?
[1:26:01] Don't raise your hand if you believe he
[1:26:02] made a mistake, but I don't believe he
[1:26:04] made any mistake. He knows what he's
[1:26:06] talking about. We may not understand
[1:26:08] what he's talking about, but he knows
[1:26:10] exactly. He's seen it. He's watched it
[1:26:12] unfold. He knows exactly what the
[1:26:13] mystery is and he knows what he's
[1:26:15] talking about. It unlocked the message
[1:26:17] of the entire Bible. The seven seals
[1:26:18] closes the New Testament and sealed it
[1:26:21] up. So what did the seven seals do? It
[1:26:24] closed the New Testament and sealed it
[1:26:27] up. Feast of trumpets, he says this is
[1:26:30] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:33] and the and he pats his Bible. to the
[1:26:34] whole Bible and the seven seals had the
[1:26:36] mystery hid of what it all was and is
[1:26:39] supposed to open it in the last day at
[1:26:40] the Leodysian age at the end of time.
[1:26:43] Thanks be to God. That finishes the
[1:26:45] message to the church. That finishes it
[1:26:47] when they look back and see what was has
[1:26:49] been and see where it's all all brought
[1:26:52] up to that finishes it. The age of the
[1:26:55] church.
[1:26:57] So let me just if I could just talk
[1:27:01] about this for a minute. Brother Bam
[1:27:03] says this book of redemption, the New
[1:27:08] Testament. Then he says it's the mystery
[1:27:10] of the entire Bible. But he says it's
[1:27:12] not the old. The old only declared for
[1:27:14] the
[1:27:17] new. Remember when we look at these
[1:27:23] seals, white horse
[1:27:26] rider, red horse rider, black horse
[1:27:29] rider, pale horse rider, has everything
[1:27:32] to do with the New Testament church.
[1:27:35] Souls under the altar. Amen. White robes
[1:27:37] given to the Jews from the time of
[1:27:39] Christ on. Brother Brenham said, not
[1:27:40] before Christ. Yeah. The fifth seal is
[1:27:42] about the Jews from the time of Christ
[1:27:44] on. And then the tribulation period, the
[1:27:47] sixth seal.
[1:27:49] These seals don't have anything to do
[1:27:52] with the Old Testament.
[1:27:54] They're all about the New Testament
[1:27:56] church.
[1:28:01] Okay? Remember Jeremiah?
[1:28:06] Jeremiah came at the time redemption
[1:28:08] price needed to be paid. And Jeremiah
[1:28:11] paid the price of redemption and
[1:28:12] recorded it in a book
[1:28:15] and sealed it in an earthn vessel
[1:28:18] because he knew by prophecy that this
[1:28:22] church is going into
[1:28:24] Babylon. But when they come out, I've
[1:28:28] already secured them.
[1:28:30] I already paid the price of redemption
[1:28:32] at Calvary. And now after we come out of
[1:28:34] Babylon, I'm going to lay claim to
[1:28:36] what's mine. Y that's what brother
[1:28:39] Brandham's talking about. The Old
[1:28:41] Testament is bridegroom. The New
[1:28:43] Testament is bride. That Jesus Christ
[1:28:45] come as the fullness of the word. Every
[1:28:47] prophet, all the Psalms, everything that
[1:28:49] was written was all written of him. The
[1:28:51] New Testament hadn't been written yet.
[1:28:52] He come as the fullness of the word.
[1:28:54] Amen. He came to fulfill. He was the
[1:28:56] capping off of all prophets. He was the
[1:28:58] finishing of all prophecy. He was the
[1:29:00] fullness of God made flesh. And in him
[1:29:02] was his New Testament bride. And out of
[1:29:05] him came the New Testament.
[1:29:09] He had already secured the Old
[1:29:11] Testament. That's why when he
[1:29:12] resurrected, they all resurrected with
[1:29:14] him.
[1:29:16] But now his bride is going to come forth
[1:29:18] in manifestation. And that bride now is
[1:29:21] going to fall into Babylon. And these
[1:29:23] seals have everything to do in this book
[1:29:25] has everything to do with what happens
[1:29:27] to the bride and the redemption of the
[1:29:29] bride and the restoration after we come
[1:29:31] out of Babylon because he already paid
[1:29:33] for it. But there's going to come a time
[1:29:35] when we come out of the church
[1:29:36] denominational system and come back to
[1:29:38] the true and living word. Come back to
[1:29:41] the the answer to prayer. Come back to
[1:29:43] the the land of the son of the right
[1:29:45] hand. Come back to our inheritance. And
[1:29:47] he's going to be able to claim it cuz he
[1:29:49] paid it.
[1:29:51] already paid for it. Now he's going to
[1:29:53] claim it at the end of time.
[1:29:56] And this mystery's been hiding in him
[1:30:00] because he's the word made flesh. And
[1:30:03] that's the mystery of the book. The
[1:30:06] mystery of the book is God made flesh
[1:30:09] and a man upon the earth. Amen. And so
[1:30:12] what we couldn't
[1:30:14] understand, what was hid from us by the
[1:30:18] seals was the fact that we also were the
[1:30:23] word made flesh on the earth. And what
[1:30:26] causes to be blind to it? Denominational
[1:30:29] teaching.
[1:30:31] Amen.
[1:30:32] That's why he says not the Old
[1:30:34] Testament. This is the New Testament.
[1:30:36] And the seals have everything to do with
[1:30:38] the New Testament.
[1:30:40] that sealed away from this bride her
[1:30:43] true identity and her inheritance and
[1:30:45] who she really is. But at the end of
[1:30:48] time, God would send a prophet and
[1:30:51] Christ himself would take the book. Yes.
[1:30:57] Amen. It doesn't mean, listen, it
[1:30:59] doesn't mean it's only the bride, but
[1:31:01] this is the part he's redeeming now.
[1:31:03] This is the part he's dealing with now.
[1:31:05] This is the part he's unifying himself
[1:31:06] to to do what? to bring back everything
[1:31:11] that was lost, to bring back the family
[1:31:14] of God back upon the earth again in the
[1:31:16] millennial reign and beyond that to the
[1:31:19] new heavens and the new
[1:31:22] earth. Oh friends, I don't know where
[1:31:24] I'm at anymore, but I know I'm in a
[1:31:26] happy place.
[1:31:32] Praise be to God.
[1:31:43] Yeah. Let's go a little
[1:31:51] further. I don't know where I'm
[1:31:54] at. Let me go. Let me just read this to
[1:31:58] you. Says, "The seven sealed book is
[1:32:01] revealed at the time of the seven
[1:32:03] thunders of Revelation 10.
[1:32:06] Is the seven seal book revealed? It's
[1:32:08] been revealed to me because I heard
[1:32:10] those thunder
[1:32:15] sounding. Brother says, "Now the seven
[1:32:17] seals holds the mystery of the book." I
[1:32:21] hope you can catch that now. The seven
[1:32:23] seals holds the mystery of the book. We
[1:32:26] can see what those seven seals. Until we
[1:32:30] can see what those seven seals has
[1:32:32] sealed in, we're only presuming them
[1:32:37] things. So remember, the mystery is in
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:41] book and the seals have been holding it
[1:32:46] in. But when the seals are loosed, now
[1:32:50] the book is loosed and now the mystery
[1:32:52] that's laying under the seals is loosed.
[1:32:56] I hope you see it, friends. Amen. I hope
[1:32:58] it's becoming clear.
[1:33:03] Amen. All
[1:33:08] right. All right. I don't want to get
[1:33:10] into that yet. Let's go to Revelation.
[1:33:12] I'm going to go over here to Revelation
[1:33:15] chapter 10 verse 8.
[1:33:20] After the opening of the seals, the
[1:33:22] sounding of the thunders, the ministry
[1:33:24] of the seventh angel, we come to
[1:33:26] Revelation
[1:33:30] 10:8. And I want to finish with this for
[1:33:33] tonight. We'll go further maybe on
[1:33:35] Wednesday. Revelation 10:8. And the
[1:33:37] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[1:33:39] unto me again, and said, go and take the
[1:33:41] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:33:43] the angel, which standeth upon the sea
[1:33:45] and upon the earth. And I went unto the
[1:33:48] angel and said unto him, "Give me the
[1:33:50] little book." And he said unto me, "Take
[1:33:52] it and eat it up, and it shall make thy
[1:33:54] belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[1:33:56] mouth sweet as honey." And I took the
[1:33:59] little book out of the angel's hand, and
[1:34:01] ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet
[1:34:03] as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it,
[1:34:05] my belly was bitter. And he said unto
[1:34:07] me, "Thou must prophesy again before
[1:34:09] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:34:12] kings."
[1:34:14] Let's go back to our
[1:34:19] book. This is the
[1:34:21] book that was in the hand right hand of
[1:34:24] him that sat on the throne. But it was
[1:34:25] also the book that was inside the earth
[1:34:27] and vessel. Do we agree it was in both
[1:34:30] places simultaneously?
[1:34:33] Because these are spiritual truths, not
[1:34:34] physical locations.
[1:34:37] Amen.
[1:34:40] See the thing that limits us is this
[1:34:43] sight and these ears and this brain.
[1:34:46] Amen.
[1:34:48] You
[1:34:50] know what we think is seeing is not
[1:34:53] seeing.
[1:34:57] When brother Brennon went beyond the
[1:34:58] curtain of time into the sixth
[1:34:59] dimension, he could see just fine.
[1:35:03] There was no light bulb, no sunshine, no
[1:35:07] light that we have here on earth. To us,
[1:35:10] that realm is darkness.
[1:35:12] To him, it was all light. So if it
[1:35:15] didn't have any natural light, what we
[1:35:17] call natural light, then that means he
[1:35:19] didn't use natural eyes, what we call
[1:35:21] natural eyes.
[1:35:24] So seeing is not seeing. Hearing is not
[1:35:27] hearing. Amen. There's more hearing. And
[1:35:30] there's more seeing. Yes. Than what we
[1:35:33] understand.
[1:35:35] We are limited in our flesh. But we are
[1:35:39] not limited in revelation. Amen. God. So
[1:35:43] here we see this book that's been in an
[1:35:47] earthn
[1:35:48] vessel. It's been in Jesus
[1:35:51] Christ. Why did he put it in Jesus
[1:35:53] Christ? So that it would stay secure. So
[1:35:56] that the revelation would not get lost.
[1:35:58] Amen. So it would not corrupt and
[1:36:00] wouldn't rust in the Exodus from the
[1:36:04] promised land.
[1:36:08] Because this mystery is God made flesh.
[1:36:12] So Jesus Christ is God made flesh.
[1:36:14] That's why the book is in him. Not
[1:36:16] something inside of him. But he is the
[1:36:20] manifestation of the contents of the
[1:36:22] book. The word made flesh. Yes.
[1:36:27] So then no man can touch this book. No
[1:36:33] man can look upon the book because it's
[1:36:34] sealed. No
[1:36:36] man, only the worthy one. And Christ
[1:36:38] steps forward because he paid the price
[1:36:40] of redemption for this book. Now he's
[1:36:41] going to lay claim to the book. And now
[1:36:43] he takes and he opens the seals all the
[1:36:45] book. And he comes down as the mighty
[1:36:46] angel in Revelation chapter 10. Now he's
[1:36:48] got an open book in his hand.
[1:36:51] Not a sealed book anymore. Now the
[1:36:53] mysteryy's been unveiled. Now it's open.
[1:36:56] Now, now a voice now comes to John,
[1:36:58] which John's a type of the bride. And a
[1:37:00] voice comes to John and says,
[1:37:02] "Go to the angel and take the
[1:37:09] book. Take
[1:37:14] it. Take it and eat it up."
[1:37:18] Amen. This is the book nobody could
[1:37:21] touch. Yeah. Nobody could look at,
[1:37:23] nobody could read. This was the book
[1:37:26] that Adam lost. No man could have it.
[1:37:28] This is the one that's been hiding in
[1:37:30] the flesh of Jesus Christ for
[1:37:32] safekeeping.
[1:37:34] And now at the opening of the seals
[1:37:35] under a seventh church age messenger
[1:37:37] when the mystery of God's finished, now
[1:37:39] the seals have come off the book. Now
[1:37:41] the book has come back to earth.
[1:37:45] Where does the mighty angel put his
[1:37:46] feet? Amen.
[1:37:50] Brother Brandham said the seventh angels
[1:37:52] on earth at the time of this coming.
[1:37:55] He came and brought what did he bring
[1:37:57] back? He didn't bring back a piece of
[1:38:00] paper, friends.
[1:38:02] But he come back and he's told to take
[1:38:05] the
[1:38:06] book and eat it up. Amen.
[1:38:12] Do you see how complicated the book of
[1:38:14] Revelation is? If we're looking for some
[1:38:16] physical thing in a physical location
[1:38:18] cuz if we're looking for a physical
[1:38:19] thing, if we're looking for a list of
[1:38:21] names that are wrote down and and then
[1:38:23] on the day of judgment, brother Benham
[1:38:24] said at the white throne judgment, that
[1:38:26] book will be opened and the names were
[1:38:27] read off. How's he going to open the
[1:38:29] book and read the names? John ate it.
[1:38:33] Where's the book? The Bible says John
[1:38:36] took the book and he ate it up and in
[1:38:39] his in his mouth it was sweet as honey,
[1:38:41] but in his belly it was bitter. Amen.
[1:38:43] How is God going to take that same book
[1:38:46] and open it at the white throne judgment
[1:38:48] and start reading all the names of it?
[1:38:50] Check. Bob. Check. Susie. Check. Harry.
[1:38:55] Check. Where's the book? The book was
[1:38:57] inside. Amen. God made flesh in Jesus
[1:39:00] Christ. Now, at the opening of the
[1:39:02] seals, he comes to John who represents
[1:39:04] the church and says, "Now, I'm going to
[1:39:06] take the book back to earth and I'm
[1:39:08] going to put the book in another earthn
[1:39:10] vessel. And that other vessel is my many
[1:39:12] membered body, my bride. And now the
[1:39:15] book is secure in the bride. What is
[1:39:18] that book? It's the mystery of God that
[1:39:20] was in the back part of his mind. What
[1:39:22] God wanted to achieve in all the Bible
[1:39:25] that he wanted to become a family on the
[1:39:27] earth in fellowship together in harmony
[1:39:29] and in love and in fellowship.
[1:39:33] And now that book with all the names and
[1:39:36] all the contents and everything else is
[1:39:38] in a many member body.
[1:39:40] We've ate the book. The book's in
[1:39:45] us. How is the
[1:39:48] book? You realize you can't read the
[1:39:51] book of Revelation like a textbook. You
[1:39:54] can't read it like a newspaper. Cuz if
[1:39:56] so, what book is at the White Throne
[1:39:58] Judgment?
[1:40:01] Amen.
[1:40:03] That doesn't mean there'll be no record.
[1:40:04] That doesn't mean there's nothing. But
[1:40:06] that's not what this book is. Amen. This
[1:40:08] book is the mystery of God. And now the
[1:40:10] mystery of God is in the bride. Brother
[1:40:13] said, "The word is in the bride and the
[1:40:15] mind of Christ that he knows what done
[1:40:16] with it." And now he says in verse 11 of
[1:40:19] chapter 8, he says, "Now thou must
[1:40:21] prophesy again."
[1:40:25] What are we prophesying again? Prophesy
[1:40:28] again. I've got to go pray for hours and
[1:40:30] hours till I get
[1:40:32] prophecy. I've got to do I got to tell
[1:40:34] future event. No, no, no. prophesy again
[1:40:37] what's already been prophesied. You're
[1:40:39] telling what the contents of the book is
[1:40:41] all about. The mysteries have come off.
[1:40:43] The seals have come off. The
[1:40:45] denominational barrier has been removed
[1:40:47] from the book so that we can see what
[1:40:49] the book is really. It's God becoming
[1:40:51] flesh upon the earth. And now we're to
[1:40:53] prophesy that again. And all the
[1:40:56] mysteries that were under the seals.
[1:40:57] What mysteries were there under the
[1:40:59] seals? serpency, godhead, water baptism,
[1:41:04] eternal security, predestination,
[1:41:06] salvation, all of that was laying under
[1:41:08] the seals, not written down on pieces of
[1:41:11] paper, but the truth that has everything
[1:41:12] to do with this manifestation of God.
[1:41:16] Amen. And now we are to prophesy again.
[1:41:21] Turn with me to one last scripture and
[1:41:23] I'm going to finish here because if I go
[1:41:24] one step further, we'll go an hour
[1:41:26] further
[1:41:28] and I don't want to do that. 2
[1:41:30] Corinthians chapter
[1:41:41] 4. 2
[1:41:43] Corinthians chapter 4 verse
[1:41:49] three. Paul says, "But if our gospel be
[1:41:51] hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[1:41:54] and whom the god of this world has
[1:41:55] blinded the minds of
[1:41:57] them which believe not, lest the light
[1:42:00] of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is
[1:42:02] the image of God should shine unto them.
[1:42:05] For we preach not ourselves, but Christ
[1:42:07] Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your
[1:42:09] servants for Jesus' sake. For God has
[1:42:11] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:42:13] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:42:15] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:42:17] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:42:18] Christ. But we have this treasure in
[1:42:21] earth and vessels that the excellency of
[1:42:24] the power may be of God and not of us.
[1:42:28] Amen. This treasure of the knowledge of
[1:42:30] God in the face of Jesus Christ. What
[1:42:32] does that mean? That I know God because
[1:42:36] God became flesh. Amen.
[1:42:40] Now the knowledge of God in the face of
[1:42:42] Jesus Christ. Now we have this treasure
[1:42:45] in earthn vessels that the glory may be
[1:42:48] of God and not of us.
[1:42:52] Amen. The question is where's the
[1:42:55] book? It's a good question.
[1:42:59] If we go to
[1:43:00] traditional theological seminary study
[1:43:04] of the Bible, we got a problem because
[1:43:08] somebody ate the book
[1:43:11] and John ate the book and John departed
[1:43:14] this world.
[1:43:16] If we make everything physical, not
[1:43:19] symbolic, but physical, then the book
[1:43:22] was eaten and is gone.
[1:43:25] It's in John. Yeah. But if we make it
[1:43:28] symbolic and realize this book is always
[1:43:32] the mystery that was in God's mind.
[1:43:35] And this mystery that was in God's mind
[1:43:37] was in the flesh of Jesus Christ. He
[1:43:39] paid the price of redemption and held
[1:43:41] this mystery safe in his flesh. The
[1:43:43] revelation of God until he could redeem
[1:43:45] his bride. And then he would peel the
[1:43:47] seals off of the book that kept her from
[1:43:49] seeing the truth. Amen. And now she
[1:43:52] would see whatever he is. I am too. Yes,
[1:43:56] sir. Where he come from, I come from.
[1:43:59] Where he goes, I goes. What he is, I am.
[1:44:05] And she ate the book. And this bride is
[1:44:09] prophesying again. May God bless you.
[1:44:12] Let's stand together. I don't want to go
[1:44:14] any further. Amen. I'm still so full,
[1:44:19] friends. There's so much that we want to
[1:44:22] share. But but let God just take these
[1:44:26] truths and drive them deep into our
[1:44:28] soul.
[1:44:29] May they become the thing we feed on the
[1:44:31] thing we see. May we see Listen, when
[1:44:34] brother Brandham knew what time he was
[1:44:36] in the end time age, the opening of the
[1:44:37] seals, it indicated that everything that
[1:44:40] he had been teaching was true. It was
[1:44:41] the vindication of serpent seed being
[1:44:43] true. It was the vindication of the one
[1:44:45] God being it vindicated everything he
[1:44:47] was teaching that he was showing these
[1:44:48] mysteries are the truth. Mhm. And when
[1:44:52] he realized what it was, Amen. It
[1:44:54] changed. He said, "My Bible became a new
[1:44:56] book to me."
[1:44:58] Amen. The seals are taken off. The
[1:45:01] mystery is revealed. And now we can see
[1:45:05] Christ and his bride coming all the way
[1:45:08] through the Bible. I see my position
[1:45:10] now. I see who I am. I see who he's
[1:45:13] always wanted me to be. And now, what is
[1:45:15] the bride's ministry? To prophesy again.
[1:45:19] We're not here to preach what made it
[1:45:21] obscure. We're not here to preach
[1:45:23] denominationalism. And we're not here to
[1:45:25] preach man's ideas. We're here to preach
[1:45:27] this revelation of the mystery of God.
[1:45:30] Amenise because his word is in his bride
[1:45:34] and the mind of Christ that he wants
[1:45:36] that knows what he wants done within.
[1:45:38] Amen. I'm so How many of you feel so
[1:45:41] overwhelmingly privileged just to see
[1:45:43] these things?
[1:45:46] Overwhelmingly privileged. that God has
[1:45:49] taken the veil off and the mystery is
[1:45:51] gone and we're not confused about a
[1:45:53] physical book and a physical place and
[1:45:55] how can it be here and there and what is
[1:45:57] it and where is it? It's the revelation
[1:46:00] of God. The mystery of God made known to
[1:46:04] us. Listen, it's not a mystery anymore.
[1:46:07] It's a revelation to us now that he told
[1:46:10] us what it was, what it's always been,
[1:46:12] and what he always wanted. And now that
[1:46:15] book is in us. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:46:19] together. Dear heavenly father, we thank
[1:46:22] you Lord Jesus for all you give. God,
[1:46:25] this hour that we live in, Lord, to us
[1:46:27] sometimes it's
[1:46:29] overwhelming. God, the claiming ministry
[1:46:31] where you claim what you purchased 2,000
[1:46:33] years ago, you're claiming your body to
[1:46:36] live in again, a many membered body to
[1:46:40] dwell in. For you are the book. You are
[1:46:44] the message. All the contents of the
[1:46:47] book is
[1:46:48] you. We haven't eaten pieces of paper.
[1:46:52] We've been feeding on the true
[1:46:54] revelation of the
[1:46:55] word. What was hidden in your mind and
[1:46:59] obscure from view for so many years. You
[1:47:01] revealed it when you came in flesh as a
[1:47:04] son of God. You showed what had been
[1:47:07] laying in your mind what your great
[1:47:08] desire
[1:47:09] was. And Lord, then you brought forth
[1:47:12] from yourself, from your son, a
[1:47:14] bride to redeem back and restore back
[1:47:17] what was lost in Eden. But that bride
[1:47:19] fell and got tangled up with
[1:47:21] misunderstanding. And the seals hid the
[1:47:23] true
[1:47:24] revelation. But Lord, here in the end
[1:47:26] time, you sent a prophet to peel those
[1:47:28] seals off so that we could see. You gave
[1:47:32] us the eyes, Lord, and you showed us who
[1:47:35] we really are.
[1:47:37] God, help us to feed on this
[1:47:39] revelation, to receive you, Lord, to
[1:47:43] receive, Lord, this book, to eat it, to
[1:47:46] feed on it, to become one with it, to
[1:47:49] let our lives now be the hiding place,
[1:47:52] the guarding place, the security for the
[1:47:55] revelation of that book. May we give our
[1:47:58] flesh completely to you. May we give
[1:48:00] every desire to you, every want, Lord.
[1:48:02] Every thing that would hinder, may we
[1:48:04] lay it down at your feet so that you can
[1:48:06] have this
[1:48:07] vessel to display your book. God, may
[1:48:10] you live in each one of us, Lord, more
[1:48:12] than ever before. And may we be more
[1:48:14] yielded than we've ever been. For God,
[1:48:16] we understand our purpose better than
[1:48:17] we've ever understood it before. And may
[1:48:20] it bring real changes in our life, Lord.
[1:48:22] this real purpose that we're here on
[1:48:24] earth for to display the contents of
[1:48:26] this book. May it override every other
[1:48:28] fleshly desire and every other carnal
[1:48:30] thing in our life. May this be the thing
[1:48:32] we strive for more than anything, Lord.
[1:48:35] May this be the life we yield to, the
[1:48:37] thing that we surrender to, the thing
[1:48:39] that takes preeminence among us more
[1:48:40] than anything else, that you might have
[1:48:44] your way in us. We ask it in Jesus
[1:48:47] Christ's name. Bless your people. Bless
[1:48:49] us. Keep opening your word for us, Lord,
[1:48:51] that we might see. Rub that ISAV in our
[1:48:53] eyes all over again that we can see
[1:48:55] clearer than we've seen before. For we
[1:48:57] love you and we ask your blessing in
[1:49:00] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:49:03] Amen. Oh
[1:49:05] friends, I'm so
[1:49:08] thankful that there was a cry that said,
[1:49:11] "Go to the mighty angel and take the
[1:49:15] book and eat it up."
[1:49:18] This is the marriage union. This is the
[1:49:20] invisible union when you go to Christ
[1:49:24] and you receive the true revelation from
[1:49:27] him. And when you receive that, it
[1:49:29] becomes part of you. You feed on it. You
[1:49:32] become one with it. And when you become
[1:49:35] one with this revelation, what comes out
[1:49:37] of you is the prophesy again. What comes
[1:49:41] out of you is Christ the word for our
[1:49:44] day.
[1:49:45] Oh, I'm so glad God's given us an
[1:49:48] opportunity to feed on this mysterious
[1:49:51] book so that the book can be hid once
[1:49:54] again in a vessel of clay. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:58] God bless you, saints. Thank
[1:50:01] you. You open the seals of my
[1:50:05] life. Now I know who I
[1:50:10] am. You broke the seals of my life.
[1:50:15] life. Now I know where I come
[1:50:19] from. You open the seals of my
[1:50:24] life. Now I know where I'm
[1:50:29] going. I'm going
[1:50:33] home. I'm going
[1:50:38] home. My Bible became a new book.
[1:50:43] Every chapter
[1:50:47] present your
[1:50:51] mysteries have been revealed to
[1:50:56] me in such
[1:51:01] simplicity. How grateful I am.
[1:51:07] Will I
[1:51:10] thank
[1:51:12] you
[1:51:15] Lord? Your word is so good to
[1:51:20] me. More than life to
[1:51:24] me. It has
[1:51:27] [Music]
[1:51:29] become my reality.
[1:51:35] Will I see
[1:51:38] Christ in every verse, every
[1:51:44] line? Praise the
[1:51:48] Lord. We are one. You
[1:51:52] open. You open the seals of my
[1:51:57] life. Now I know who I am.
[1:52:03] You broke the seals of my
[1:52:06] life. And now I know where I come
[1:52:11] from. You open the seals of my
[1:52:16] life. And now I know where I'm
[1:52:21] going. I'm going
[1:52:25] home. I'm going home.
[1:52:31] I see the seals of my
[1:52:34] life in every
[1:52:39] story while I read my
[1:52:44] name along with yours.
[1:52:49] You tell me over and
[1:52:53] over how much you love
[1:52:58] me and all the
[1:53:00] [Applause]
[1:53:02] plans you have for me.
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:08] And you explained to
[1:53:12] me my strange and mysterious
[1:53:17] life. Everything became
[1:53:21] clear once you opened the
[1:53:26] se. And now I understand.
[1:53:32] Now I
[1:53:36] know I have always
[1:53:40] been a part of you. You
[1:53:44] open You open the seals of my
[1:53:49] life. Now I know who I
[1:53:53] am. You broke the seals of my life.
[1:53:59] Now I know where I come
[1:54:03] from. You open the seals of my
[1:54:07] life. Now I know where I'm
[1:54:12] going. I'm going
[1:54:17] home. I'm going home. Your
[1:54:21] word. Your word is so good to me.
[1:54:28] More than life to
[1:54:31] me, it has
[1:54:35] become my
[1:54:40] reality. Will I see
[1:54:44] Christ in every verse, every
[1:54:50] line? Praise the
[1:54:54] Lord. We are one. Will you explain to
[1:54:58] me? Will you explain to
[1:55:03] me my strange and mysterious
[1:55:08] life? Everything became
[1:55:12] clear when you opened the
[1:55:17] se. And now I understand.
[1:55:23] Now I
[1:55:26] know I have always
[1:55:31] been a part of you. You open the seals.
[1:55:36] You open the seals of my
[1:55:39] life. Now I know who I
[1:55:44] am. You broke the seals of my life.
[1:55:50] Now I know where I come
[1:55:53] from. You open the seals of my
[1:55:58] life. Now I know where I'm
[1:56:03] going. I'm going
[1:56:08] home. Going home.
[1:56:14] He's the same
[1:56:16] God who spoke
[1:56:19] to the woman
[1:56:21] at the
[1:56:23] well. He's the same
[1:56:26] God whose
[1:56:29] wonders are too
[1:56:31] many to tell.
[1:56:35] The same
[1:56:37] God who
[1:56:40] pardoned the
[1:56:42] raging red
[1:56:47] sea. He's the same
[1:56:50] God who's
[1:56:52] living in
[1:56:55] me. Verse
[1:56:58] one. Will I look
[1:57:01] back in history? I see a mighty
[1:57:06] God
[1:57:09] unveiled,
[1:57:11] proving over and
[1:57:13] over that his word will never
[1:57:19] fail. But I'm
[1:57:22] not just
[1:57:24] dwelling on a pasty.
[1:57:33] He's the same
[1:57:35] God and he's
[1:57:37] living in
[1:57:39] [Music]
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:41] me. Oh, the same
[1:57:45] God who spoke
[1:57:48] to the woman
[1:57:51] at the well.
[1:57:54] The same
[1:57:56] God whose
[1:57:58] wonders are too
[1:58:01] many to
[1:58:04] tell. The same
[1:58:07] God who
[1:58:09] parted the
[1:58:11] raing red sea.
[1:58:18] Jesus in
[1:58:20] God's
[1:58:22] living in
[1:58:25] me. Verse
[1:58:27] two. Will the same
[1:58:30] God who
[1:58:33] created all the
[1:58:35] heavens and all the
[1:58:39] earth. He came back living in Jesus.
[1:58:45] And there was
[1:58:46] power in his
[1:58:50] word. But now
[1:58:52] in these last
[1:58:55] days, I'm
[1:58:57] beginning to
[1:59:02] see that he's the same God and he's
[1:59:08] living in me.
[1:59:13] will the same
[1:59:16] God who spoke
[1:59:19] to the woman
[1:59:22] at the
[1:59:24] whale. He is the same
[1:59:27] God whose
[1:59:29] wonders are too
[1:59:32] many to tell.
[1:59:36] The sing
[1:59:38] God who
[1:59:40] parted the
[1:59:43] raing red
[1:59:48] see he's the same
[1:59:51] God and he's
[1:59:53] living in me once more.
[2:00:00] He's the same
[2:00:02] God who spoke
[2:00:05] to the woman
[2:00:07] and the
[2:00:09] well. He's the same
