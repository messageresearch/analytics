[0:00] the seventh angel who's the seventh
[0:02] angel and the seventh angel is a
[0:04] messenger of the seven Church
[0:07] age which is William
[0:10] brandham which is also the Fulfillment
[0:12] of Malachi 4 Revelation
[0:14] 10:7 and that day yes sir amen the
[0:18] seventh angel in the days of his
[0:20] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[0:23] seven Thunders would be revealed amen
[0:25] they're not going to be revealed later
[0:27] they're going to be revealed under his
[0:28] ministry amen
[0:30] amen then he and then comes to the
[0:32] leosan church age out of the church age
[0:34] book he says now this messenger of
[0:35] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going
[0:38] to do two things according to Malachi 4
[0:41] he will turn the hearts of the children
[0:42] to the fathers two he will reveal the
[0:44] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[0:46] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[0:49] contained in the Seven
[0:51] Seals it will be these divinely revealed
[0:54] mystery truth that literally turn the
[0:56] hearts of the children to the
[0:58] Pentecostal fathers
[1:00] what what does that mean that means the
[1:02] seventh angel the Elijah of Malachi 4
[1:07] amen has to be the one who brings the
[1:09] revelation of the seven
[1:11] Thunders not another man not anybody
[1:14] else it has to happen in his ministry
[1:16] under his sounding he's got to bring the
[1:18] revelation of the seven Thunders and if
[1:20] you don't have the revelation of the
[1:22] seven Thunders you don't have the
[1:24] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 he can't be
[1:27] Malachi 4 without the opening of the
[1:29] seventh seal he can't be Malachi 4
[1:31] without the coming of the Lord he can't
[1:33] be Malachi 4 without the revelation of
[1:35] the seven Thunders because it takes
[1:37] these revealed mystery truths to
[1:39] literally fulfill Malachi 4 turn the
[1:42] hearts of the children back to the
[1:43] Pentecostal fathers so you can't have
[1:45] brother branam as Malachi 4 and not
[1:48] having amen as the one who reveals the
[1:50] seven
[1:51] Thunders amen it doesn't work if he did
[1:55] not in his sounding reveal the seven
[1:57] Thunders then he did not fulfill Malachi
[1:59] 4
[2:02] so if the Seven Seals not open he wasn't
[2:04] who he said he was and who we believe he
[2:06] is if Christ hasn't come he's not who he
[2:09] says he is and not who we believe he is
[2:11] so it's we we've come to the place in
[2:14] the message it's all the way or nothing
[2:15] amen it's either right or it's not right
[2:17] we can't hang up halfway anymore he's
[2:20] either who we believe he is and who he
[2:22] says he is and who God vindica him to be
[2:24] or we need to go start something else
[2:26] because you can't mix this with your own
[2:28] thinking anymore
[2:30] it's got to be the Fulfillment of the
[2:34] word amen still tons of things we don't
[2:37] understand all kinds of questions I got
[2:40] I I I I agree there's still things that
[2:42] he's got to unfold things I don't
[2:44] understand things he said I don't
[2:45] comprehend but that doesn't change
[2:47] anything he has got to be the seventh
[2:49] angel that's on Earth at the time of
[2:51] this coming when the mighty Angel comes
[2:53] down with an open book in his hand and
[2:55] the Seven Thunders are revealed which
[2:57] reveals the mysteries of the Seven Seals
[2:59] that's the time he has to be
[3:04] here and then it has to be finished when
[3:07] he's here
