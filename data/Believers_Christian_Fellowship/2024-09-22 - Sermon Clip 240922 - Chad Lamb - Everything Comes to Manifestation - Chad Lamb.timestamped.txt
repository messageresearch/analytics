[0:00] said God help me to be honest with
[0:02] myself stop making excuses for myself
[0:06] stop passing over
[0:08] infractions stop saying it's because of
[0:11] this happened or because I have this
[0:12] tendency and I have a temper because my
[0:16] mom you know that may be true you may
[0:19] you may have inherited a temper from
[0:20] your mom but that's no excuse to let it
[0:23] lay there expose that thing talk about
[0:26] it pray about it push against it fight
[0:28] again don't don't don't just say it's my
[0:30] mom I got this because of my mom right
[0:34] so it's your mom's fault you just told
[0:35] off everybody in the
[0:37] room right it's mom's fault you just
[0:41] spoke that way to your husband or to
[0:42] your children that that was mom's fault
[0:44] no that's your
[0:47] fault sometimes we got to be honest I
[0:50] spoke with a brother one time I was
[0:51] speaking with talking to a ministering
[0:53] brother and he told me when he was a
[0:54] young man he was struggling with lust
[0:56] and he couldn't get over it and and how
[0:58] he had been to the altar he had been to
[1:00] the prayer line he had prayed he had he
[1:02] had read his Bible he had listened to
[1:04] the message he had talked to God he
[1:06] wanted to be free and he couldn't break
[1:08] free and he told me where his freedom
[1:10] came said I was sitting outside a
[1:12] brother's house and I confessed my
[1:14] faults to
[1:17] him I humbled myself and exposed where
[1:20] sin was hiding in my life and he said I
[1:23] had prayed and I went to The Altar and I
[1:25] went to meetings and I went to this but
[1:27] my Deliverance came on a porch when I
[1:29] told my brother what I was going through
[1:32] and he prayed with me and I've been free
[1:34] ever since
[1:37] God or we could say it must be okay cuz
[1:40] he's still blessing me I I I'll get
[1:42] better later I'll
[1:46] just better be careful that we don't
[1:49] leave those things lay yes because Judas
[1:52] left it lay demons left it
[1:55] lay won leave those things lay but
[1:58] expose those things say listen I I'm
[2:00] ashamed of this but I'm having trouble
[2:02] with this now I don't suggest you write
[2:04] it down for the whole church to read I
[2:07] [Music]
[2:09] mean but don't stuff it don't hide it
[2:12] don't act like it's okay and don't don't
[2:14] know in your heart you're wrong amen and
[2:17] wait for well if if it's wrong the
[2:19] preacher will say something about it you
[2:20] already know it's wrong why do you need
[2:22] the preacher to say something about it
[2:24] you've got a seed of God on the inside
[2:26] and if you got the Holy Ghost you've got
[2:27] the teacher that'll teach the word to
[2:29] you amen when that woman said brother
[2:31] Bram you didn't touch me tonight amen
[2:33] where was the holy ghost in her that
[2:34] would take the word and find the
[2:36] application in her life because the
[2:37] teacher should be in you not just in the
[2:39] pull pit that'll say well he didn't say
[2:42] exactly this he do need to say exactly
[2:45] this amen there's a teacher inside of
[2:46] you that'll say I'm
[2:49] guilty he didn't say my name and he
[2:52] didn't say the exact circumstance but
[2:54] all of a sudden I have a witness that I
[2:55] need to make that thing right I need to
[2:57] get rid of this I need to expose this in
[2:59] my life right
[3:02] amen
[3:04] man the danger is if we
[3:07] don't and we have another service next
[3:09] week and it's a good service and you're
[3:15] blessed somebody ask you to pray for
[3:17] them and you pray for them and they get
[3:22] healed that's dangerous
[3:25] friends that's
[3:28] scary I don't want to be in that spot
