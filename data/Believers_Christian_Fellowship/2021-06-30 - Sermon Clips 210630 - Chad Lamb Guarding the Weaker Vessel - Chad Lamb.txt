TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you realize adam was not deceived adam was not the weaker vessel the woman was the weaker vessel she was deceived if adam had been standing there whispering in her ear she would have never fallen for the tactics of the devil she she was there alone facing the devil and the devil was attacking the word and by reasoning she began to reason by the word and she come out from beyond the boundary of the word and then she was attacked and fell prey she was beguiled but adam was not deceived in the transgression so if adam would have been standing there whispering in her ear would she have fallen she fell because she had to open the door to release the attributes that were locked inside of gohan but god knew in the end time he would have one that wouldn't fall she's predestinated not to fall this one fell this one fell this one fell this one fell but there's one predestinated not to fall so how is he going to keep her from falling she's still the weaker vessel so what's he going to do he's going to do something different in this day he's going to come down himself with his personal presence and he's going to be standing not next to her but inside of her and he's going to be whispering love secrets to her and no matter what the devil brings he's got a love secret to fight against it he's opening the word you realize he's opening the word day by day service by service tape by tape he's opening what's he doing he's making the bride an invincible army not because she's got some super mind but she's under the headship of the word and under the headship of the word he's got to go through the word first to get to you and if you stay under the headship he's not going to get to you the only way is for the weaker vessel to forget that she's a weaker vessel and start to think she can reason the word and she can figure out she can do and she can begin to act like jezebel but this bride's predestinated not too
