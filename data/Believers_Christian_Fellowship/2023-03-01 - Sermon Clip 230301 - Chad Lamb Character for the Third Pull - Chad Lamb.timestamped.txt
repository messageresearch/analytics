[0:00] we've heard talking about the spoken
[0:02] word the manifestation
[0:05] but I think brother Benham declared it
[0:07] for us and he showed us temporarily what
[0:08] we'll see in fullness of power
[0:10] what it will look like I don't know how
[0:12] it will happen I don't know will it be
[0:14] everybody will it be a few well I have
[0:16] no idea
[0:17] it may be completely different than what
[0:19] I'm even thinking
[0:22] but the point is it'll be there
[0:23] according to the prophecy and it'll be
[0:26] according to God's design and will and
[0:28] his timing through whomsoever he chooses
[0:30] but the vessel he chooses will have the
[0:32] character to handle that power
[0:34] he will see to it
[0:36] so if we ever want to be part of that
[0:39] manifestation
[0:40] then what do we do today
[0:43] I say never forget your ABCs
[0:47] never forget your ABCs we have people
[0:50] who want to show Dynamic gifts and
[0:52] dynamic powers and they want to speak
[0:54] things and they want to do great things
[0:56] and really when it comes down to it they
[0:58] want to be somebody
[1:00] you can see through it
[1:02] but but they want to speak things but I
[1:04] say if you want to speak something into
[1:06] existence
[1:08] and if you want the power of the spoken
[1:09] word then start by speaking the word to
[1:12] this earth here and getting this to obey
[1:13] the word
[1:14] well I speak to a storm if you can't
[1:17] even keep from lying why speak to a
[1:19] storm if you can't even keep your home
[1:21] in order why speak to a storm if you
[1:23] can't keep this body this Earth why
[1:25] speak to the Earth if you can't speak to
[1:27] this earth and make it match the
[1:29] scriptures
[1:31] if you can't conduct yourself in your
[1:33] home as a Son of God and a daughter of
[1:34] God if you're fighting and fussing all
[1:36] the time if the children are disorderly
[1:38] then why why even think about speaking
[1:41] something into existence until we first
[1:43] come back to the ABCs
[1:45] and let God train us where we're at and
[1:47] repent and recognize I need something
[1:50] more I need a greater character just to
[1:52] handle today
[1:56] amen we want to speak a world to
[2:00] existence and go live a private life on
[2:01] it but we can't pay our tithes on a
[2:02] regular basis or show up to church
[2:05] according to the word
[2:07] and forsake the assembling together of
[2:09] ourselves
[2:10] you realize that no matter how far you
[2:12] go in math you still need ABCs to go to
[2:15] algebra and trigonometry and all that
[2:16] and no matter how advanced you get in
[2:19] literature
[2:21] all literature is still made of the ABCs
[2:24] at least English literature
[2:27] you can never get away from the ABCs you
[2:29] can never become so advanced in the
[2:31] kingdom of God that you don't need to
[2:34] pay your tithes pray and read your Bible
[2:36] every day that you don't need to come to
[2:38] Fellowship you're never getting so
[2:39] Advanced that you don't need fellowship
[2:41] with the Believers
[2:43] you never got so Advanced that you don't
[2:45] need to sin under the live preaching of
[2:47] the word through the faithful Ministry
[2:48] you've never you've never got that
[2:49] advanced yet
[2:52] we can never we can never listen these
[2:55] things are foundational they're ABCs
[2:57] their basics in the scripture they're
[2:59] basic the rudimental parts of Christian
[3:00] Life
[3:02] through the foundation but remember the
[3:03] rest of the house is built on the
[3:05] foundation
[3:06] so you can never start building off the
[3:09] foundation and leave the foundation your
[3:11] building will collapse everything must
[3:13] stay upon this Foundation all the way up
[3:17] so we want to go high but forsake the
[3:19] foundation don't forsake the foundation
[3:22] we want to we want Power the bride's
[3:25] going to this and the bride's going to
[3:26] do that why doesn't the bride just keep
[3:28] her home in order
[3:31] well the bride will do this and the
[3:32] bride will do that why won't the bride
[3:35] just clean up her language
[3:37] clean up her lifestyle
[3:39] why won't the bride just as a husband
[3:42] loved his wife as Christ loved the
[3:44] church
[3:45] well why won't the wife reverence her
[3:47] husband
[3:49] you see what I'm saying
[3:51] if we ever want to get to the top of the
[3:53] ladder we've got to hit every rung on
[3:55] the ladder
[3:57] why to build character to learn
[4:00] obedience
[4:02] stay in line with the word we're never
[4:04] going to have power of spoken word if we
[4:06] can't keep the word
