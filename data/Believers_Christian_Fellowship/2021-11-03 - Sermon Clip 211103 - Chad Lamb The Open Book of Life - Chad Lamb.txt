TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when jesus went to uh i can't remember what city it was but when he's walking through the city and he comes to a sycamore tree and he looks up and zacchaeus is up there says zacchaeus come down i'm going to your house today and he goes into zach he is his house and in zacchaeus's house amen zacchaeus begins to confess all of his sins i've done all this and i'm going to pay back if i stole anything i'll pay it back four times i'm going to give to the poor and he confesses his faults and he acknowledges he's going to make it right and jesus said salvation has come to this house today he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe anything in a former day he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe anything that would come in the future but because zacchaeus received the manifested word for his day that the high priest couldn't receive that the chief elders couldn't receive that the scribes and pharisees couldn't receive when zacchaeus could receive it confess his wrongs and repent he says salvation has come to this house today well how but but what if zacchaeus made a mistake later i don't think jesus is taking back his declaration of salvation amen i don't think jesus is playing a game saying zacchaeus you're saved but you know don't make a mistake and don't fail to receive me later no when zacchaeus had the capacity to recognize the living word he knew what was inside of zacchaeus he gets invited to simon's house and in simon's house amen simon pays him no respect simon gives him no uh washing of his feet no kiss no greeting amen and simon just invites him the house but has no respect for the word made flesh but there's a little harlot woman there's a little woman trapped and steeped in sin and she comes running in and breaks an alabaster box and washes his feet with her tears dries them with their hair and jesus looks at simon and he tells this woman though her sins are many they are all forgiving her she listen i i say this and don't get shocked at what i say jesus declared that all her sins were forgiven and we have no record in the bible of her asking forgiveness for her sins he didn't wait for her to say a sinner's prayer he didn't wait for her to ask forgiveness he didn't tell her to go to the temple there was nothing else she had to do all she had to do was recognize the word made flesh before her and she fell at his feet and began to worship the word that was made fast and she was getting a hold of the thai post amen and a few days after that that typos would go to calvary and shed blood and that shed blood was the price of her redemption but she got a hold of the typos here and jesus said he looked at her and says your faith has saved you saved by faith faith and want faith in the word that was presented to her in her day
