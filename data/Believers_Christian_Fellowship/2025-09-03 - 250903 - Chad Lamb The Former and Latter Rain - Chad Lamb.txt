TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And Jesus hold my hand. I need thee every hour. And through this pilgrim land, protect me by thy power. [Music] Hear my feeble plea. Oh Lord, look down on me. When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand as I travel through this pilgrim land. There is a friend who walks with me. He leads me safely through the sinking sand. It is the Christ of Calary. And this would be my prayer, dear Lord, each day to help me do the best I can. For I need thy light to guide me day and night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. Jesus, hold my hand. Hold my hand. I need thee every hour through this pilgrim land. Protect me by thy power. [Music] Here my people. Oh Lord, look down on me. When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand and let me travel in the light that I may see the blessed day. Keep me that I may be holy thine and sing redemption songs someday. I will be a soldier brave and true in ever firmly take a stand as I onward go and daily meet the foe. Blessed Jesus my hand. Verse three. Well when I wander through the valley dimmed toward the setting of the sun. Lead me safely to a land of rest. If my crown of life now won. I have put my faith in thee, dear Lord, that I may reach the golden strength. No other friend on whom I can depend. Blessed Jesus for my hand. Well Jesus hold my hand I need thee every hour and through this pilgrim protect me my life I love hear my fe look down on me when I Kneel in prayer. I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. When I kneel, when I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand. Alas, and did my Savior bleed? And did my sovereign die? Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I? At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my son. And now I am happy all the day. Was it for crimes that I have done? He groaned upon the tree. Amazing pity, grace unknown, and love beyond decree. Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight. And now I am happy all the day. But drops of grief can never repay the debt of love I hold. Here Lord I give myself away. It is all that I can do. [Music] At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight. And now I am happy all day. Oh yeah.

[Music] God bless you all. [Applause] Well, I didn't realize it till I got here that they were going to sing that song. And I already had that song on my list to sing. So, let's just stand together and we'll sing it in English. Now, we've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Although Satan rages, we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Verse one, for many years now, Satan's tried to stop us. But the bride of Jesus, she's still alive. Like a mighty army, she keeps maring onward, winning every battle. for the Lord's on her side. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan rages, we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord and give me your hand. Let's agree together that all of our eneies will crumble at our feet. Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound in heaven in the name of Jesus. Satan will have to flee. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan rages, we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Once more, we've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. [Music] Though Satan rages, we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Well, it's not in trying, but in trusting. Not in running but in resting. [Music] Not in wondering but in pray that we find the strength of the Lord. It's not in trying but in trusting. It's not in running but in resting. It's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the Lord once more. It's not in trying but in trusting. [Music] It's not in but it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the Lord. [Music] You shall love the Lord with all your heart.

I I love you for all the things you do. Lord, I love you. Oh, help me love you, Lord, with all my heart. With all my soul, with all my mind, with all my heart, with all my heart, with all my soul, with all my mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just bow our heads together and pray. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus, for gathering us once again. And God, as we've come, Lord, to this service, we come with expectation, Lord, for your prophet told us that we get what we expect, Lord. God, we wanted to come and sing your praises with our brothers and sisters. We wanted to come, Lord, and rejoice in your goodness. We wanted to come and hear your word preached, Lord. We wanted to receive from you another portion for today. And God, we expect that, Lord. And and God, you've promised to feed us this way. You've promised to meet us this way. We come in obedience to your word. And now, Lord, we look to you to come and break the bread of life for us. To feed us as your hungry, waiting sheep, trusting in you, the great shepherd and bishop of our souls, that you'll feed us on the good food, Lord, that'll give us strength and give us life. Have your way with us, Lord. Speak the words you want us to hear. Give us ears to hear and a heart to receive. May we go out of here different than we came in strengthened, Lord, and edified with clear vision, Lord, knowing what it is you're trying to do in our lives. And may we yield to that purpose, Lord. May we yield and surrender to your word. And may your word have a place to work in us. We love you, God. We ask for these things as you take preeminence this evening. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you this evening. It's certainly good to be here. Amen. It was good to hear from brother Michael. God bless you. It's good to have you and your wife and your son here with us. He called me a few days ago and let me know that he was going to be coming through. And uh and so it's a real privilege for us to have him visiting with us. He's about as far south as you can possibly go in Texas. Brownsville, way down there. And actually they attend a church in Mexico. They cross the border to go to church and and so it was nice. It was good to hear a song in Spanish, wasn't it? Amen. That's special for us. Amen. So, God bless you all. I was amazed when I told Blake that they were going to have a song and what it was. He goes, "Huh, I already have that on my notes to sing tonight." So, that was an ordained song for tonight. Amen. It was in the mind of God. So, we appreciate having them here. Uh and uh like he said, he's been in Canton for a while, but they're coming back, staying here tonight, and then heading towards home. So, just be praying for them. Amen. We also have another visitor with us, uh Brother Nathaniel from Germany. God bless you. He's back here, this young man here. He's actually going to be here for 6 months. He's doing an internship at New Life Scientific. And so, God bless you. Welcome. It's good to have you, but we're going to have a chance to get to know you. So, you're not you're kind of a visitor, but not really a visitor. You're a long-term visitor. Amen. So, his family attends Brother Good Roads, which we certainly know brother Gird really well. And and so, we're happy to have him here with us as well. Man, want to remind you of the wedding coming up this Saturday. keeping in prayer for brother Wesley and sister Anne's wedding. We're excited to see them married and we'll be there. But while we're there, brother Danny Delmundo will be here preaching. So, if you just want to remember him in prayer and and uh we're always excited to have him come by. Uh also this Sunday, our two of our brothers will be traveling out. Brother Jim Swanson will be ministering over at Bible Believers. Uh so remember him in prayer and brother Gabe Smith is going to be traveling down to Logan to minister for brother Jeff Snodgrass. So remember those brothers as well. So it seems to be the way it goes. Sometimes they just they scatter through the winds. But hey, God is good and we we love the Lord. Amen. While we're standing, if you'll take your Bibles and turn with me to Romans, we'll go to Romans chapter 13. Also wanted to let you know that brother Levi Bish sent over a a handful of pendants, little pendants that he had made of the supernatural cloud and he wanted to share them here with the church. So they're out on the welcome desk for anybody who would want one. And we know that he's made the tie tacks for years. A lot of the brothers got the little tie tacks that brother Levi Bishes had made and and so we've enjoyed those. And so the pendants are out there. If you'd like to have one of them, you're welcome to it. And we certainly appreciate him for thinking of us. Amen. It's always been very nice. Amen. Romans 13 and 11. Romans 13:11. and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep. For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. We just ask God's blessing uh over the word. We've been for quite some time talking about uh the message from pick up your pen and write. We still got my little booklet in my hand. If you brought it, uh we're not going to go through it like we have been. We finished going through it, but but we will um uh just refer to one section out of it. There was something that came up in spoken words, the original seed, which is the message Brother Brandham was preaching when he got this message from the Holy Spirit that told him to pick up his pen and write. And he shared it uh first in that message. And then, you know, we printed these little booklets and you're welcome to it. Brother Michael, if you guys didn't get one, we've got them in the back there. grab them before you go. It's an excerpt out of uh uh the church age book where he once again uh puts down in the church age book what the what was written there when the angel or when the Holy Spirit told him to pick up his pen and write. And so uh if we could pull up the PowerPoint, Brother Franco, I want to take just out of there the former and latter reign because this came up in spoken orders the original seed. It came up in a quote here and I just want to spend some time talking about it while we're on it. Amen. And I never dreamed we'd be this long in spoken word as the original seed and and big but I'm absolutely loving it. It's a thrill. Sunday was such an exciting thrill to my heart and I appreciate the pull on the word and Amen. When I'm telling you the harder you pull, the more I love what I'm doing. I I have a good time here. Amen. And so just receive the word of God. Amen. Just reach out and grab it and take it. Amen. And the harder you take it and the faster you take it, the more fun I start having. Amen. because then I start learning things while I'm preaching and I like that. That's always the best. Uh so we want to look at former former and latter reign. This is the this is the quote where he mentions it there out of the Peramian church age. Now I want you to be very careful here and see this. God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled. It has to be for it is a spiritquickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi. Jesus referred to it. It is just before Christ comes the second time. By the time Jesus comes, all scripture must be fulfilled. The gentile dispensation will be in its last church age. When this when that messenger of Malachi comes, he will be right with the word. He will take the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation. He will start at the serpent seed and carry on to the messenger in the latter reign. But he will be rejected by the denominations. So this prophet this this uh fulfillment of Malachi 4 we know is brother Brandham and we know he's a prophet of the age and revelation the fulfillment of revelations 10:7 but he is going to take the whole Bible amen from Genesis to Revelations and he did. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to start with serpent seed and go all the way to the messenger in the latter rain. Amen. So we know that this latter rain has something to do with his ministry because he's the messenger and he's going to carry on to the messenger in the latter rain. So we want to talk about that uh here in uh 1960 uh in this message condemnation by representation. He says and we believe that there is to be a church in the last days that will receive both former and latter reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be scattered throughout the world in this leodyian age. It'll be a church that's called back to the original faith in God. It'll be a church that'll have Jesus Christ walking in it, manifesting himself. The shadow of the king will be in it. Amen. And I don't like to say will, I say is. Amen. The shout of the king is in the in the camp because we've received this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we see here again there's going to be a former and a latter reign. Now, uh I'm going to bring I'm going to I'm going to look at quite a few quotes out of spoken word as the original seed. And we've been talking about this message for now for the last few weeks, how it was a pivotal message in brother Bam's message. He comes to this time in 1962 and he knows God's done with the churches. He knows the revival fires are burning down. Everything's slowed down. It's come to a law. His ministry has slowed down and he knows there's something else going to happen. And he's in this in between time and he's trying to sort it all out. And he's going into that and spoken word is the original seed. And he's trying to show us, amen, that the original seed is the spoken word of God. And when you come back to the original, it will reproduce itself. Amen. It'll reproduce exactly what it was intended to produce. So whatever produced the first church, Amen. at the end if we come back to the original word, it'll be just like the church was when it was fresh from Pentecost. And so that's what he's teaching us in this message, spoken word, the original seed. But before this time, brother Ben, if you go all the way back, you can start all the way back in the early 50s. Brother Benham starts saying, "And the l and this is the latter rain. This is the latter rain." And he like everybody else is referring to the Pentecostal revival and the outpouring of the spirit and the gifts that had been restored and even in his ministry and the supernatural and brother Bham saying this is the latter rain and and and so but then he starts changing and you get into 57 58 59 he starts realizing there's got to be a former reign. So then he starts saying now the former rain's got to come into this latter reign but then when he comes to spoken word as the original seed into the seals and beyond he completely changes. Amen. He realizes that wasn't the that wasn't the latter rain cuz you can't have the latter rain till you have the former rain. &gt;&gt; And he starts teaching it. So I want us to understand that cuz when you go back in the message, you may hear those things. But brother Brennham himself is realizing the reality and the gravity of the scriptures and the position he's in as God's unfolding it to him as he's moving into his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he comes to spoken word the original seed and he starts to lay it out. He says,"Now we are hearing so much in so many organizations and everything else talking about we're in the latter rain." Nonsense. No such thing now. &gt;&gt; That's pretty clear. &gt;&gt; But before he said, "This is the latter rain." But now he's going to now be because God has revealed this to him and showed him where he's at in the ministry and what's coming. He realizes we're not in the latter rain. No such thing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and this is what he says in the church age book. This age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. We know that there must have necessity be a return of dynamic power. The believers sensed this and in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century. What seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit. It was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration. It was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain. So I'm going to back up. You know me, I don't like to move too fast. I like to go slow. So, uh, so I backed it up here because it says what seemed to be the answer when the Isuza Street revival broke out and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the the the baptism of the Holy Ghost came back with the gifts of the spirit, it seemed like the restoration. It seemed like going right back to what the church was at Pentecost, but he said it wasn't. &gt;&gt; It only looked like it, but it wasn't. This was indeed the long awaited restoration. So, I want us to to look at this the long awaited restoration because there's got to come a restoration that the that the true church would return to being the bride that she was at Pentecost. That's what the restoration is going to do. Bring her back to what she was when she was a virgin bride, fresh from the hands of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At Pentecost. And they thought that the the Zuza Street revival, the the the Pentecostal revival was the long awaited restoration, but it wasn't. But look what he says next. The latter rain can only come after the former rain. &gt;&gt; So he's attaching the latter rain to the restoration. &gt;&gt; You see that? We're going to see that as we go. Which is the spring or teaching rain. The latter rain then is the harvest rain. &gt;&gt; So we have a teaching rain and a harvest rain. Amen. And so how could this be the real thing when the teaching reign had not come? The prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come. Thus, what was thought to be the restoration and final quickening at the rapture had not come. And now, brother Benham, when he when he's in in resume of the ages in the church age book, he now can place everything. He now understands. And now he says now it looked like it was a restoration, but it can't. How can the latter rain, which is the restoring rain, how can the latter rain come till the teaching reign came? How can you teaching reign come without the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn their hearts back? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the teaching reign has to come before the latter rain. This is the scripture that this is coming from where brother's referring to Joel chapter 2 verse 23 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God. For he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. I want you to see this is going to refer back to this, but he's going to use different terminology. You're going to bring the former rain and the latter rain in the first month. And the floor shall be full of wheat, and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerorm, and the caterpillar and the palmer, my great army, which I sent among you, and ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; We live in the day of the fulfillment of this prophecy. Amen. He told us that he's going to restore all that was destroyed by an antichrist spirit when it ate down the church. Amen. the bride tree as it was destroyed through these four stages. But he's got a promise of restoration here in Joel chapter 2. Amen. But part of that restoration is a former reign and a latter reign. And in the former and latter reign, he's going to bring a restoration back to all that these insects, the insects of the antichrist have eaten down to the church and bring the church back. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he does, ye shall eat in plenty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you eating good? &gt;&gt; Why? Because we went through the drought of the dry the dryness of the church age. We went through the starvation. Amos said, "Amen. There'll be a drought in the land. Not for food and water. Amen. A famine, but for hearing the word of God, because the word of God had gotten lost. Amen. Had been destroyed through the dark ages. But now under the former latter rain, he's going to restore all that the caterpillar, all that the canker worm, all the locust, all everything that they destroyed is coming back. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you. Can you say, "God has dealt wondrously with me." Isn't it doesn't matter what our trials are, the hardships that we face. That's part of the perfection of the bride. That's what God has to do in our lives because God has so swn the word back into us and he's poured out his spirit upon that word to manifest the word. How are you going to manifest that word in an atmosphere of perfection? Every trial, every hardship is only an obstacle that God wants the word inside of you to conquer and overcome and prove that there's been a restoration in this age. That's &gt;&gt; right. Man, we're not looking for easy living. And we're we're looking for the word that has come back to positionally place us and bring us back into our right mind, the correct understanding of who we are with the anointing, the power of God, the Holy Ghost poured out in the bride to make that word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I say, God has dealt wondrously with me. &gt;&gt; And we should have nothing to be ashamed about. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when we look at the former rain and latter reign, we're going to look at these definitions. If we pull up this word is for the former reign mo it means teacher and brother uses it as teaching rain. And then when you look up latter rain, this word latter rain means the latter rain, spring rain, the March or April rains which mature the crops of Palestine. But you see where I've got that 3 3953 number in blue because in the concordance it says this word comes from that word. This is the root of the other word. So when we pull up that root word, it means to glean, to gather, to take the aftermate, to take everything. That means that's that's where this word latter rain comes out of the word to glean or to gather. That's why brother Brandham said it's the harvest rain is the gleaning or gathering rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. on the same page. Then now in resume again he says now it says God is going to restore. The Lutheran age did not restore the church. It started a reformation. The Wesley age did not restore. The Pentecostal age did not restore. But God has to restore for he cannot deny his word. This is not the resurrection of the church. It is the restoration. God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning. Now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration. The locust, cankerworm, caterpillar and palmer have eaten all but the root and small bit of the stem. Now we are told that these insects are all one and the same in different stages. That's right. They are the antichrist spirit manifested in organization, denomination, and false doctrine through the ages. And that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored. God isn't going to plant a new church, but he's going to bring his original planting back to original seed. Remember, spoken word is the original seed. If it comes back to the original word, it'll produce the same original life. &gt;&gt; His original planting back to original seed. He is doing it as stated in verse 23, by the teaching or former rain. Next will come the harvest rain or what did he say? &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; I I'm highlighting this really nice and thick because I don't want to forget this because there's sometimes brother Ben says things and he ties things together that all of a sudden blow your mind and it comes up later and you start to understand what he's telling us that he calls this latter rain is the harvest rain or rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's keep going. Don't forget that. &gt;&gt; We're going to remember it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The latter rain is the harvest rain or rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Okay. Spoken word is the original seed. We're back now to this message. Someone asked me to repeat that Hebrew word again in Joel the 2 chapter, Joel 2:28, where he speaks of the coming of the former and latter rain. The former is the Hebrew word mo, which means teaching. In other words, it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain. Now we've had the teaching rain and we're ready now for the harvest rain. You know the first rain is when you plant the seed that starts your crop growing. Then just before it matures, there comes another crop. That's what they call the harvest rain. We know when it is the spring rains and then the rains about June. It makes your crop. Now the rain we find out was the spirit. So what's the former rain and the latter rain? It's an outpouring of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an outpouring of the spirit of God. Amen. So that the seed that's been planted will grow. It needs the water. It needs the moisture. It needs the spirit to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he begins teaching us now that the the teaching rain. And and and I love how he says we've had the teaching reign right here. Let me go back here. Uh let me find it. We've had the I turned it off. We I am messing everything up. &gt;&gt; We've had the teaching rain. &gt;&gt; We're ready now for the harvest rain. &gt;&gt; But look at when he says this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is so important because we know when he comes to this message, he realizes something's happened, but something's going to happen. He realized something's changing in his ministry. He realized 1962 is this year of change because he comes and preaches spoken word is the original seed. And he says the revival fires are dying down. They're not burning up the country like they used to. My meetings are the worst of all of them. What has caused all of this? He said because there's been a seed planted now we've got to wait and see what comes forth from the planting. And now he's come and tells us at this stage. Amen. He's come through he's come through his his first and second pull. He's come through the revival meetings that have gone all over the world. Amen. Proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. With supernatural vindication and healings and miracles. And now he comes to the church ages. And he and he starts tying together all the loose ends and bringing back all the truth. He's teaching water baptism in Jesus' name. He's teaching the truth on Godhead. He's teaching all of these things, bringing us back to the original word. And he says, "We've had the teaching reign. We're ready now for the harvest rain. &gt;&gt; And now in 1962 in spoken word was the original seed. He's standing in between these two rains and said this rain is falling but there's another rain to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is so exciting friends because now we we're standing here amen in 2025 and we can we can say that the harvest rain has come. Amen. We're not standing in between these rains anymore. We're standing here the beneficiaries of the harvest rain that has already fallen. &gt;&gt; He says now here's been three different kinds of seeds planted. A denominational Billy Graham. He was the head planter. Oral Roberts for the Pentecostals. Pentecostal seed has been planted. I'm talking about organization now. Then the word has been planted. Now you'll have to understand folks. I ain't saying this no more unless God tells me. I want you to get this good and clear. Three seeds has been planted. That's the reason the planting it's about over. It's all over. Seeds must be planted before the rain falls. I believe that there is uh I believe that it's near the harvest time. The seeds has been planted. Denominational seeds of the churches such as the evangelicals, the Baptist, the Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and the Pentecostal seeds has been planted into the Pentecostal organization by great men like Oral Roberts, Tommy Hicks, Tommy Osborne, great men of God. See, and I believe that the word of God has been planted unadulterated away from any of these organizations. That's what's the matter. See, what's the matter? Why does he say that's what's the matter? Because the question in the beginning spoke over his original seed is why are the revival fires dying down? What is the revival? The revival was the former rain revival when the spirit was pouring out while the seed was being planted. And and you can type revival with rain. Y &gt;&gt; they're synonymous. And they saying, "Why has the revival fires died down?" He said, "That's what's the matter. The problem is the seeds been sown. &gt;&gt; The seeds been plant the seed plant must have seed water before it can grow. It must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow." Now, listen carefully here. Now, the seed must be planted and then it must have water in order to grow. Now, you say, "Well, brother Brandham, I'm going to express your thought there. We've had the water. So be it. That's correct. You have had the water. What water? Rain. &gt;&gt; Revival. You have had the water. You ever plant cabbage or anything or seeds or some other another like that? Usually they got a water there. Just pour a little on them. See? All right. But now wait, what did we have in the planting time? The former rain. That's where he's back showing. Yes, we've had revivals. Yes, we've had an outpouring of the spirit. Yes, we've had water, but it was during the planting time. Amen. Now, we've got to see what comes up. And now, when it comes up, there's got to be a harvest rain, something to bring it to full maturity. &gt;&gt; Now, what's the matter now? She is now waiting for the latter rain. That's when she produces her fruits. Oh, praise God. That's when it brings it to full maturity. I hope you get her. Then the kind of seed you had planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap because the spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; If the denominations wants more members, that's what they're going to get. That's what they have gotten. The Pentecostals wants more Pentecostals. That's what they're going to get. But the word is going to produce sons and daughters of God. Uh-huh. Right. That's coming, too. Watch. Look at that great latter rain supposeded to be done. How they would run over the wall, leap over, how they'd be an army coming. Oh my goodness. Sometimes like I know this is here. I put it here, but when I see it again, I get so excited because brother Bam said there'd be an army coming. That ties us right back to the dry bones in Ezekiel. Amen. This is going to be an army rising up again. He said, but what they're going to have the denomination is going to bring forth denomination. Pentecostal is going to bring forth Pentecostal, but the word of God is going to bring sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now watch, but there was now these all quotes I pulled out of spoken word's original seed. And if you watch the numbers, they're all right in together. I've just pulled pulled pulled little clips, little nuggets out of spoken word, the original seed. Now watch. But there was one which was the word. He was the word. And where did he stay? With the promised one, the elected one. The word stayed with the elected one. And the word of God will stay with the elected one, the royal seed of Abraham. by the promise. He's referring back to Genesis 18 on the plains of memory when God came down in flesh to meet Abraham to confirm the promise to him. And he says, "One which was the word. He was the word. Where did he stay? With the promised one, with the elect." How many came down? There was three of them that came down. Two angels and God himself in flesh. Amen. And one stayed with the elect group, which was the word. And the other two went down to preach. Amen. And brother Bram said preaching the gospel is the blinding light. He went down to blind those in Sodom. &gt;&gt; And he said that was Oral Roberts and Billy Graham. He's still preaching the same thing. He's telling us the same story. But there was one. It was God who had come in a vessel of flesh. And in the plains of memory, he had come to the elect, those who had received the promise. And he came at the time to confirm the promise. &gt;&gt; And the word of God today will stay with the elected one. the royal seed of Abraham by the promise. What kind of works did it do when it was manifested about 800 years later in the form of Jesus Christ? It done the same works. What he say? What works did this what works was just Jehovah Elohim doing in flesh? Amen. When he turned his back to the tent and discern the thoughts of Sarah behind him, he says, listen, I I love this. I I want you to catch this right here. When it was manifest 800 years later in the form of Jesus Christ, it done the same works that that one did there. Amen. That the word did at the gate at Abraham's tent. Set with his back turned to the tent. Today Abraham, his name was Abraham, not Abram. What it always had been what his name he say he's showing us he's working the sign of the Messiah before the Messiah came. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Messiah came as Jesus Christ and did the same thing that had happened to Abraham on the plains of memory. He could discern their thoughts. Amen. But then he would come again at the end of the gentile dispensations in the church ages and he would come into a man of flesh into a prophet of the age. And he would do the same thing in so much that he would turn his back to a crowd of thousands of people and start calling people out so that we would see this is the same life, the same God, the same word that was back confirming the promise to Abraham is confirming the promise to the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; praise be to God. But his name was Abraham cuz God met him a few days before that and told him his name was Abra. What's he doing? He knows his name change. He knows who his is. He's giving a proper identification. Said, "Where is thy wife?" Not s a r a but s a r a h. Sarah. Where is thy wife Sarah? Like he didn't know. Said she's in the tent behind you. He said, "I'm going to visit you. I the personal prana. I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." Oh, and you're going to have that baby that you waited on. The latter rain is fix. Whoa. Oh. Oh. The latter rain is fixing the fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where? On the plains of memory in Genesis 18 when he comes in the flesh to confirm the promise and shows the sign of the Messiah and comes to the elect seed at the right time. He says, "Now the harvest rain is fixing the fall. That's why I've come this way to you, Abraham. I'm bringing this seed word that you've held in your heart to full harvest maturity." Amen. &gt;&gt; The latter rain is fixing to fall. You've held that seat in there long enough. Now I'm believing and you're looking for a coming son and he's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the real church today. See that elected seed. &gt;&gt; You've been looking for him and I'm going to send him to you. Amen. What said that? The word. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we've come right back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bam does this. &gt;&gt; He's not doing it. It's God doing it through him. The man can't do this. Here's a man. He Listen, this is 1962. This is March of 1962. He doesn't know what's going to happen next. We're standing here looking. We're looking backwards at everything that happened after this and said, "Oh man, that was so perfect. That was so good. He laid that right down just in the right time." But there was no way for him to know what was God's going to start doing at the end of the year when he brought six different people to him with dreams. And all the dreams were about his ministry changing and him going out west and capped off by the expansion of his road and the vision that he had had of his gate being uh torn to pieces and the and the commission of God to go west for this and now knowing that he's going west. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; For the interpretation of the seven thunders. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't know it when he sang this. He didn't know what God was going to do and he didn't know what was going to come next. So remarkable, friends. &gt;&gt; We're such a privileged people. He goes on, he says, "This has been about 6 hours. A spoken word, the original seed." He preached it for 6 hours. They had a break for lunch. &gt;&gt; Don't be nervous. They got a lunch break, but it was six hours with a lunch break in the middle. This has been about 6 hours, right? Close to it. Five and a half, six hours. There is much more could be said, but surely the Holy Spirit by this time has sunk it so deep in you that you know what I'm talking about. We are at the end time. The seeds are sewed now. The latter rain is fixing to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows that much. &gt;&gt; How, when, where, why, he just knows it's fixing to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the next day, he preaches a message. Well, I'm not going to get to that yet. I'm going back here to Abraham. Is it okay? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 18. We've been through this so many times, but it doesn't matter. We're going through it again. &gt;&gt; This is this is these this is our life. &gt;&gt; This is our identification. This is what we're living through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 18. I want you to catch this. How brother Ben Renham said, "The latter rain is fixing to fall." Now look at what he says in paragraph 308. Said, "I'm going to visit you. I, the personal prana, I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. and you're going to have that baby that you waited on. The latter rain is fixing to fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've held that seat in there long enough on believing and you're looking for the coming son and he's coming. And then he ties it to the church today looking for the coming of the Lord. But he says, "I'm coming to visit you." I the personal pronoun according to the time of life and you're going to have that baby you waited on the latter rain is fixing to fall when he comes in Genesis 18 let's let's look at verse 9 let's just pick it up in verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behind behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also. And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh? Where did she laugh? The Bible said she laughed within herself. It wasn't even audible. She laughed within herself. And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying shall I assurity bear a child which amold?" Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed, I will return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not, for she was afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou did laugh. So here he promises Abraham, Abraham, I'm going to return unto thee according to the time of life and you shall have this child. So he promises this visitation and he promises this return. And and what he's going to do is he's going to turn them back to what? To their youth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just like he's going to take the church back to what she was when she came out of Pentecost. Right. &gt;&gt; She's going back to a virgin bride, fresh from the hands of God, washed by the water of the bleeding word, restored back to an unadulterated virgin condition, back to what she was. And what and she was meant to be in the beginning. Abraham and Sarah were turned back young, but God promised them a visitation. And if you look, God never comes to Abraham himself again. But the next visitation is in chapter 21. If you turn with me to chapter 21, the next time God visits, it says this in his visitation. And the Lord, chapter 21, verse one, and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said. When did he say he would visit Sarah? When he looked at Abraham and said, I'll visit thee according to the time of life. Because Sarah was part of Abraham and part of the promise and the fulfillment of the promise was going to come forth through her. Amen. And where is the promise? Amen. The promise is the Christ, but the bride of Jesus Christ is part of Christ. And the fulfillment of the promise is going to come through her. &gt;&gt; And the Lord visited Sarah. The Lord came to her. Why? Because it was the it was time for the latter rain to be poured out. &gt;&gt; As he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. Listen. And Sarah conceived. and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him. There was something Sarah needed. She needed this visitation. She needed she needed a visitation of the Lord. She needed an outpouring of the spirit. She needed something to give her the ability to conceive. Remember at this point she's already been turned young again because in the chapter before and chapter 19 he goes down to Guerrar. And in Gerrar, the king of Beimilec, he wants this beautiful young woman. Amen. So it shows that she had already been turned young. But after she had been turned back by the by the word, she had been turned back to what she was, she still needed something. She needed &gt;&gt; a visitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in that visitation, she conceived. If you go with me to Hebrews 11, let's turn over there quickly. Hebrews chapter 11. Let's look at what this visitation did for her. Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews 11 and 11. Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised. Right. &gt;&gt; What gave her the faith to give her the strength to conceive seed? It was in the private visitation in Genesis 21. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that and that visitation gave her the faith and the faith gave her the strength to conceive seed because she knew his promise was true. &gt;&gt; I want to go back and look at a slide quickly. Let me see. Let me see if I can find it. Remember when I told you to remember this? &gt;&gt; What is the harvest reign? Rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; We've got to come to a faith. This bride's got to come to a faith. Amen. A faith that'll change the atoms in her body. Amen. What she needs to come to that faith is the harvest rain. She needs a visitation like on the plains of memory, but she needs the visitation that takes place in the little room where the Lord comes to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And gives her the strength to conceive seed. Praise God. Oh, where am I? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's keep going. I've already read this. All right. In the end time sign seed, this he preaches the next night. This is uh 03:19. spoken words seed is 03:18. He says, "But the word of God has been sown also. And when the spirit of God begins to fall, the word of God will live in the people. And that false bride that's committed adultery out there and brought herself into creeds and sold out her birthright will reap what? A confederation of church." That's to be bound and burned like the thorns and thistles. But where the word of God's been swn into the people's heart, it will reap a bride for Christ. As certain as I'm standing here, end time signs. In the Smyrna church age, he says he he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit say to the churches of each age. In every age, it was the same cry. Hear what the spirit says. If you are a Christian, you will get back to what the spirit is teaching. That is the word of this age. Every messenger to every age will preach the word. Every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the revival? It's the latter rain. And it's the fire that's falling. It's the spirit of God. It's it's the reviving awakening of the bride. What was it? It's because she was tied back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want that revival. Amen. That revival is in the word. Amen. Every fresh and true revival because men have gotten back to the word for their age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The cry of every age is the rebuke. You have left the word of God. Repent and come back to the word. From the first book in the Bible, Genesis, to the last book, Revelation, there is only one reason for God's displeasure, leaving the word. And there is only one remedy to regain his favor. Back to the word. The spoken word is the original seed. Come back to the word and come back to the original life, the original purpose, the original intent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The invisible union. And he says, "But watch when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival." &gt;&gt; What's the revival? The latter rain. &gt;&gt; When she begins to have a revival, when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God, watch then again, you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride, catch that woman elect. And I tell you, there's been a message that has swept out and swept the world, and it's caught me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the first seal. Now, we're going to keep talking. I'm going to I'm going to make a little turn, but hang with me. And you you all know this, but don't don't get lost in details. Hang with me. We're talking about the revival. We're talking about the harvest rain. We're talking about rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Are all those things the same thing? Absolutely. And in the first, he said, "There's coming forth the seven mysterious thunders." That's not even written at all. He's talking about the seven thunders in Revelations 10. When when John heard them and he picked up his pen to write and he says, "Don't write them." He says, "They're not even written at all. There's a mystery in those seven thunders." And he says, "That's right. And I believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for what? Rapturing faith." So that means the preaching of these seven thunders, which is the preaching of the seals, which is the mysteries revealed, has something to do with the harvest rain, the latter rain. the revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now, we wouldn't be able to do it. There's something we've got to step farther. We can't have enough faith for divine healing. Harley, we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth. &gt;&gt; So, so what's the harvest rain? Rapturing faith. What are those seven thunders going to do? Amen. It's going to get the bride together for what? Rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you to see in church age out of the church age book he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. One according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. Two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. &gt;&gt; It will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers. Exactly. So, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Did he do it? He did it. Third seal. Now, remember, we're in the seals now. The seals are unfolding. They've not finished unfolding. He's only in the third seal. He's not finished preaching the mysteries of thunders, he's right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's what this the that's what's the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have, we have denominational revivals. We haven't had a real stirring. Listen, he's talking about revivals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A stirring. Said, "No, no, no, no, no, sir. Don't think we've got revivals. We haven't." Oh, they've got millions and millions and millions of church members, but not a revival nowhere. No, no. The bride hasn't had a revival yet. Can I do that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, there's been no revival there. No manifestation of God to stir the bride yet. We're looking for it. It will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up &gt;&gt; again &gt;&gt; cuz she's coming back to what she was. It'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again. He will send it. He promised it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So these the revelation of these seven thunders, the preaching of the seven seals has everything to do with the latter rain, harvest time, rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Now says Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory in the reason of his death. See the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh. The spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison. That's right. His flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it. Quicken means made alive. His flesh, which is his body, remember we had this quote last this past Sunday. His flesh, which is his body, and that's the word. It's been laying dead for years, but it gradually begin to come into reformation. And now she's standing upon her feet. What? His body, which is the word, is her coming back in the restoration. Amen. back back in the reformation to the restoration &gt;&gt; and now she's standing upon her feet. Now go look where he goes next. Oh, how I wish I had time to go back to Ezekiel. But guess what, friends? This is Wednesday night and we got time to go back to Ezekiel. Why don't we go back to Ezekiel? Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish I had time to go back in Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you. He said, "Can these bones live again?" He said, "Prophesy." So, in order for the bones to live again, there has to be prophecy. Amen. Someone has to prophesy. How can you pro how can how can prophecy come only through the prophet? It's the word of the Lord. Hear ye dry bones, the word of the Lord. And sin you skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march towards Zion. Glory to God. That's him. That's him. The victory. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Ezekiel 37. I'll pull the scripture reference up here. Ezekiel 37 verse one. Brother Bren, I'm writing Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He goes right to Ezekiel, right to the dry bones. And he's referring here. He's referring to quicken means made alive. &gt;&gt; And his flesh, which is his body, and that's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His flesh, which is his body, and that's the word. &gt;&gt; What was Jesus? He was the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is his wife supposed to be? The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; The original word, the spoken word, the original seed. That original word for a bride is supposed to come into manifestation. And it's supposed to be the flesh. The word made flesh again on this earth. &gt;&gt; But he says, but it's been laying dead for years. What's been laying dead for years? It's the word. In what form? His body. What body? His bride body. But it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing on her feet. &gt;&gt; Oh, now let's go to Ezekiel 37 and1 says, "The hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the uh in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about. And behold, there were very many in the open valley, and lo, they were very dry." And he said unto me," Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, "Oh, oh Lord God, thou knowest." Again he said unto me, "Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, Oh ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. What was it that caused the bones to come together?" It was the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord God unto these bones, behold, I will cause breath to enter unto you, and you shall live. Listen. And I will lay sin you upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the senus and the flesh came upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them yet. See, listen. He began to prophesy and bring back the word of the Lord and testify of what God was going to do. And he brought it through three stages all the way back to where she was standing on her feet again. But yet, it wasn't a complete work. There had to come something. There was a former rain, but there had to be a latter rain. There was a revival to bring the bones together to tie the word back together because it's the word that's been laying dead. So, he had to tie all the word back together in the former reign. So there was a prophecy and there was a great move and a great shaking and it shook the whole world and it brought the bride back together to the word of God. But something else had to happen. There was no breath in there yet. They had to come back to the fullness of life to complete the commission. It didn't didn't finish back in the first age. &gt;&gt; So there had to come something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he said unto me, "Prophesy unto the wind." Prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, "Thus sayeth the Lord God, uh, thus sayeth the Lord God, come from the four winds, oh breath, and breathe upon these slain that they may live." So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army. &gt;&gt; What army is this? Amen. This is the same army. This is not a new army. This is a restoration of the army. This is a turning back to what that army was before it fell. And now it's come back. And brother Brandham said, "And marching to Zion." Amen. Because somewhere along the way, the army was defeated. And the army fell. And where it fell, it fell into ruin and decayed. But under the prophecy of the word of the Lord coming back under a former reign. He brought that army back to its feet by bringing the word of the Lord back. But there had to come the breath, the spirit, the latter reign. It had to be Christ himself descending into her to bring the army back. Amen. He's not left it up to you and I to finish the work that the first church aid failed. He came himself to be life, to be breath. Breath represents life. And he breathed into the church his own life. That's what when you look at that cloud up there, that's the headship of Christ. It was Christ. Brother Brenham said, "What is that?" It's Christ, the mighty angel. Only Christ it can be. And then he tells us, "And the seventh angel standing on the earth at the time of his coming when Christ came back, it had to be when the seventh angel was here." That's the latter rain. &gt;&gt; That's the harvest rain. That's the revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the awakening of the bride. That's why he goes to Christ the mystery of God revealed. If I could just go to Ezekiel, &gt;&gt; if I just had time, I'm so glad we had a little more time. &gt;&gt; Find out there was two stages to this restoration. &gt;&gt; First stage tying together the loose ends, but then there had to be breath life that come back by a word of prophecy. Oh friends, like I said before, I feel like the most privileged human being on the face of this planet. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Things go right, things go wrong. Who cares, friends? We know the whole purpose and intent. We know the endgame. We don't understand what happens in our daily lives. Obviously, we have all kinds of mishaps and and derailments and detours and things that are good and things that are bad and things we can't explain. But listen, don't worry about all of that. That all fits into the program. &gt;&gt; But this is the program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to set our eyes back on things that matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they came together bone to bone and sin you and and sin you and then skin covered them and they stood on their feet. But there had to come another word of prophecy. They had to give something to give them the faith, something to quicken, something to make alive. &gt;&gt; And that was a when the it was when the prophet, the same prophet who prophesied the first time had to have another word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Standing in between spoken word is the original seed, the former rain, and the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Knowing the seed's been planted back to the original word, waiting to see what comes forth. And now in the opening of the seals, Amen. Christ has returned to his army. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just going to go back. Just bear with me because I I I'm just I don't know. I just have too much fun. &gt;&gt; Remember this quote? The word is going to produce sons and daughters of God again. Uhhuh. Right. That's coming too. What? Look at that great latter rain supposed to be done. how they would run over the wall, leap over the wall. They'll become a mighty army. Listen, don't don't expect that you're going to take two bounds and jump over your neighbor's wall. But this is our spiritual condition. There is nothing that can hold back the bride when she's come together with the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; And they'd be an army coming on. Amen. What army? The army that fell is being restored. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, praise God. Now, in recognizing day, this is now we're in 1964, I want you to remember that in the third seal, he said there's been no revival to wake awaken the bride to stir the bride yet. But in 1964 July, in recognizing day its message, he says everywhere now there's no revival. Everybody's complaining, ministers crying. I was reading one of the outstanding papers that's come here to the church. A very fine paper. And I know the editor and I know the people. They're godly people. Very fine. Brother and sister Moore of the Herald of His Coming. One of the finest papers in the field. Herald of His Coming. But they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast, pray, fast, pray, sound a trumpet. How many reads it? You know that you see it all the time. Fast pray. Fast pray. It's all you hear. Fast and pray. We're going to have a great breaking of the day. There's a great thing going to happen. Oh, you pray, pray, pray. We're not too late yet. Why do they do that? Why do they do that? They want a great awakening. They're crying, believing that there will be awakening. They're good people. Why is it? What have they done? They have not recognized the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; And the and the third seal, there had been no nothing to stir her yet. Nothing to wake her up. But here we are. Amen. a little over a year later and he says there's been there's been an awakening of the bride. What was it? It was those seven unknown thunders back there that wake her up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have rec not recognized the awakening of the bride. See, by being Christian, they feel the pull of the hour, but they haven't recognized what's been done. That's what's making them feel that way. They know something is supposed to happen, but see, they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already when it's already happened right by you. &gt;&gt; Can I highlight that? &gt;&gt; Don't let this be our mistake. Now, &gt;&gt; someday something's going to happen someday. I'm telling you, it's already happened. The latter rain has fallen. Christ has come. He's here uniting with his bride. Amen. What are we here to do? Get all the way into the word. Submit and surrender all the way to it. Feed on all of it. It's already here. The awakening of the bride, the bride's revival, the harvest rain, the rapturing faith. It's been given to us, friends. Let's just absorb it and eat it and feast on it and give our whole lives to it continually again and again. It doesn't mean that there's not going to be something God's going to do with the bride. There may not. There may be other manifestations. I don't know what he's going to do and may not do, but I'm not looking for a revival. I've seen the revival. I've experienced the revival. Amen. This the restoration of the word, the unveiling of the mystery of God's mind was the revival and awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we keep looking to the future, looking to the future, looking to the future, we're missing what God has already given to take us into the future, to take us beyond the future, to where there's no more future. To where we do it eternity, where you never say future again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So realize what we have, awaken to what's been given to us and enjoy and feast on and value and love and submit to and surrender to what's already been given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be pointing and pointing and pointing and pointing when it's already here. &gt;&gt; We're looking for a way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you. Feast of trumps is the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2,000 years but is loosed in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the evening time message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit back in the church. Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time. He said it. He promised it. So, are we looking for another move of the Holy Ghost? No. He's already moved, friend. &gt;&gt; We're looking for that move to change our life. We're looking for that move, Amen, to bring us into every other move. We're looking for what God has said, amen, to have preeminence in us so that it could finish the work that he's left for this specific time to finish. &gt;&gt; It'll be him doing it, but he's promised that he loosed it in the evening time by the evening time message. That means it's already loosed the Holy Spirit back. What is that? That's the reign. The rain is what? The spirit falling on the people. The Holy Ghost where? Back in the church again. Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the end time. &gt;&gt; That's the bride's revival. What is the bride's revival? It's him. &gt;&gt; He's my revival. Amen. His spirit, his life coming into us. &gt;&gt; The bride's revival. Amen. I believe he's got more he wants to do. But he's going to do it through this revival, &gt;&gt; through this awakening, through this bride that he's united with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hosea 6, he says, "Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come unto us." Will the Lord come unto us? &gt;&gt; How? He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. the restoration of the word and the restoration of his life. The invisible union. He says, "The word promises this. It shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come. Behold, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet, and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. It shall come to pass in the last days, I'll pour out my spirit from on high. The former and latter reign shall come together in the last day." Is that what he said all the way back in Joel? In the first month. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That means the same time. Brother Benham shows that it's the same time and the same season under the same prophetic ministry that the former and latter reign is going to come together in the last days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it has. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It has. And things that are to be. He says, I believe that's the same thing we live in today. God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do. Now we know that this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin into a life of service. And in the day that God has poured out his spirit from on high, great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day when the former and latter rain are falling together. &gt;&gt; We got it. &gt;&gt; It's falling together. As we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many great denominations this is turned down. You know this experience of former and latter reign it took place in the prophet's ministry &gt;&gt; cuz it fell in the end time. It fell through that prophetic ministry. The former and latter reign fell together. So we can stand here and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes, &gt;&gt; in your ears. It's it's it's already done. But listen, we each have our own experience of former and latter reign. &gt;&gt; Every bride member has an experience of former and latter reign because I wasn't there in 1962, 63, 60. I came along much later in 1999 in the year 2000. But oh, praise God. I had a revival when I saw the restoration of the word. When I realized that what had happened to my Bible and what my church was teaching me is wrong and what the truth was. I had a revival. Amen. But then I got stuck between two revivals. &gt;&gt; I realized what the truth was. I realized what the word was. I realized what the church that happened to the church. I realized that there was a restoration. Amen. But then what about me? Amen. Now all of a sudden I was coming back lining up with the word baptized right. Understood the nature of God. Amen. Understood the church ages and all that. But I had to have a latter rain experience myself. I had to have the breath of God descend upon me. I had to realize what the mystery was laying under those seals. And the great mystery of God under those seals was that I was part of that being. I was part of that life and his life wanted to express in me. &gt;&gt; And talk about a breath, friends. Talk about another word of prophecy, another boost. Amen. Now she's standing on her feet and marching to Zion. &gt;&gt; And this latter former and latter reign. Yes, it's history. Yes, it fell in the same day. Amen. But it's still available to anybody who still needs a revival, an awakening. And until all of the bride is awakened, you can still have a former latter rain experience, friends. &gt;&gt; You young people can have a former latter rain experience. Don't get stuck between two revivals. It's all dying down. It's all getting dry. If you're in that place and you believe the word and believe what you've been taught and you know the restoration of the word, I encourage you, keep feeding on the message. Keep praying for revelation because there's a latter rain that has to come next. And if not, you'll just be a dead church member standing on your feet looking like an army member but with no life in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This revival is still available to the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I had my experience. But I'm not done with the latter rain yet. I love it when he breathes on me fresh. I love it when it comes fresh again. When I go back to the message of the hour and revelation starts pouring in all over again, it thrills my soul. I'm not done with my latter rain revival [Music] &gt;&gt; because it's through that revival he's going to bring me into every promised work and every manifestation he wants to do. And it's not going to be me doing one bit of it because he left his work to do in her in this specific time. And now he has to do it in and through the bride. That's why he's brought his life back, his breath back, his spirit back &gt;&gt; so that he can have a vessel to work in. And I just want to be that vessel. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't want to mess it up by adding my own works. I don't know what he wants to do next. I don't know how to do what he wants to do. I have no capability in my flesh to do and in my mind to figure it out, but I want him to have preeminence because that's the great purpose he's looking for in this day, to have preeminence in a group of people. so that through that revival he can bring the final manifestation of his life on this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have it in me, oh God almighty. &gt;&gt; Have it in me. &gt;&gt; Don't stop between two revivals, friends. &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself spoken words, the original seed, something's happened. Something's happened. It's happened to me. I believe it. But yet, it seems to be dying down. Amen. Just keep pressing on until something else happens. &gt;&gt; Until you hear that prophet prophesy again to you, &gt;&gt; until that word of prophecy is to you, remember when that prophet was prophesying again, he he was prophesying through the wind. Amen. To come to a place, what place? To the army. &gt;&gt; Amen. It had a resting place. It had a purpose in the prophecy. It had a thing it was going to accomplish. And that prophecy was going to bring the life, the breath, amen, the power, the anointing, the Holy Ghost of God into a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's for me personally. Right. &gt;&gt; And the anointed ones at the end time. He says, "Now therefore, the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth is a type of the spiritual rain which gives eternal life dropping down upon the church. For we call it the former rain and latter rain. It is rain pouring out of God's spirit upon his church. &gt;&gt; I love that rain." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now look at what he says here in questions and answers. And what was the last sign that they had before the promised son that they had waited on all those years come back was God standing in the form of a man and could discern the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart. Sarah being the church representing the church. Discern the thoughts that's in the church that was even behind him. Is that right? You know, brother B's referring to his ministry, right? &gt;&gt; And immediately after that, she changed back to a young woman and him a young man. And Isaac was brought on the scene, the promised son. I believe you're seeing the last thing that'll happen to the church before the rapture. That's exactly I believe it. The rain is over. &gt;&gt; Can I highlight that? &gt;&gt; Listen, don't think the rain's over for you. You're part of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're part of that army in Ezekiel. It's for you. But what he's telling you is don't look for something else to come. It's come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That rain has come. It has been manifest. It has been preached. It has been delivered. &gt;&gt; And he's teaching us. Brother Bam is saying, he's not saying there's no more awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; Because if he had in 1964, then I'm wasting all my time up here, friends. &gt;&gt; But what he's telling you is what was supposed to come has come. And now it's over. Don't look for another. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "As ministers of the gospel, I can't see one thing left but the going of the bride. Not another reign, not another revival, but the going away of the bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. The new birth is Christ is a revelation. God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth. Now, what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things that he did, making the word manifest? Oh, if the church only knew its position, it will one day. Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the rapture will come because the rapture comes with a shout. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The gathering together &gt;&gt; of the bride through the message. But the rapture will go when the church knows its position. That's what God's constantly trying to get us to see. That's the revelation that's coming. That's why we're feeding on this word. And listen, it's not a new message. It's the same message brother Brandon preached so many years ago. But listen, friends, we weren't seeing everything that he was telling us. He was trying to get us to see, oh, we saw Malachi 4. We saw a prophet. We saw a restored word. We saw denominations were wrong. We saw Rome was going to rise up and the Catholic Church was going to take power. But what have we had been missing? We missing the bride coming of Christ. We missed our position what the church is supposed to be in the end time. &gt;&gt; And God is wanting us to see it and awakening us to it and revealing it to us hour by hour, day by day. And when the church, all the church, everybody knows its position, then the rapture will go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How am I going to see it? Don't we need another move of the spirit? We've already had the move of the spirit that reveals it. We need to go back and trust it and feed on it and receive it and love it and embrace it and everything. You can listen to it, friends. &gt;&gt; So, what do I need to do? Why don't you play a tape again? Why don't you read a book again? Why don't you come with enthusiasm full of the word of God knowing that this is the bride's revival? This is the awakening of the bride. What brother Brandham brought. Amen. It's not just the opening of the seals, but after the opening of the seals, he said, "My Bible became a new book." Amen. God put peeled back the veil even for the prophet. And what he started preaching from 63 on was the seventh seal, the bride's message. Go back and feed on it with everything that you got. Friend, don't sit on your hands and say, "Well, someday something will happen. Someday something will happen." It's already happened. Just take it and feed on it and become one with it. This is the bride revival. This is the awakening of the bride. This is Christ returning the word returning to his bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the invisible union. This is Christ coming in bride form. &gt;&gt; Don't neglect it. Don't discard it. Don't think you're going to just get it on Wednesdays and Sundays, but throw yourself, immerse yourself into it with everything you got because this is it. This is the revival. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wait and think some great thing will happen and then a pressure will come and then we'll do this and we'll do that. Listen, if there's anything going to be done, it's going to be the outcropping of what's been done, what's been given, what's been preached, what's been revealed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It'll bring us through. It'll show itself. It'll manifest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the last thing I want to read, Proverbs 16:15. And the light of the king's countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen the cloud of the latter rain? &gt;&gt; Do you got it hanging in your house? Do you have it on a card? Have you seen it out in the foyer here? I I mean there's a little pendant with it out there on the on the welcome desk right now. Amen. The king's favor is as a cloud of the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Oh, Elijah on Mount Carmel showdown when he brought him back to the word, he restored the original worship. He told him, "Would you quit blending your religion? If Baal be God, serve him. If God be God, serve him. But quit mixing this thing together." And he built back the 12 original stones and brought back the altar. And he brought signs and wonders and miracles to vindicate. Amen. That what he was telling was the truth according to the vision of the Lord. But after that, amen, he began to pray for what? He began to pray for the rain to come. Amen. And he got down with his head between his knees and he prayed and he sent he sent his servant up to say, "Hey, is it do you see anything?" He saw nothing. He prayed again. But on the seventh time, he went. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the seventh age, he says, "I see a little cloud coming out of the sea about the size of a man's hand." And he says, "Oh, send for Ahab, for I hear an abundance of rain." That little cloud didn't bring a little drizzle, but that little cloud under the Elijah ministry brought in the seventh time in the seventh age brought an abundance of rain, friend. &gt;&gt; It was the refreshing from the Lord. It was the awakening of the bride. It brought rapturing faith to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's the king's favor, friends. &gt;&gt; I feel favored. Do you feel favored? &gt;&gt; I feel thrilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. &gt;&gt; God is so good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate the former and latter reign? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Don't look for another revival, friends. enjoy the one we've got. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't look for something else to come. Receive what's come &gt;&gt; and let that life carry us wherever he wants to carry us and do with us whatever he wants to do with us. For too long, we've we've either there's been two mistakes that we can easily make. Either sitting on sitting on our heels thinking, well, when God wants to do something, it'll happen and I'm just sitting here buying time till something happens. or I need to make something happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both of those are as wrong as the east is from the west. But what I need to do is throw myself into what has happened and give myself completely to the word of God and then let that life do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not sitting doing nothing wasting time waiting for God to do something. And neither it is me getting to action by my own reasoning and my thoughts and making something happen. &gt;&gt; Right? But me diving into the awakening of the bride, enjoying my revival. &gt;&gt; What is he revived? He's revived the army that was laying there as dead. What's he revived? He's revived the church that had died to the church age. &gt;&gt; He's revived me &gt;&gt; back to what he ordained me to be before this foundation of the world as a son or daughter of God. He has revived me from the deadness of ignorance, from the deadness of having my mind blackened and alienated from God. And he's brought me from death unto life. He has risen me. He's awakened me. He has restored me. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. [Music] We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan rages, we cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. One more time. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Oh, Satan rages. We cannot be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Amen. God bless you, friends. Aren't you happy? &gt;&gt; Aren't you thrilled? Hey, listen. Tomorrow you're going to have problems. There's going to be disappointments, struggles, things that don't go right. And you're not going to understand why. You may get frustrated. Your mind get may get foggy and you may forget some of the things you heard tonight. If you live anything like I live, but oh, if we could just realize he's already awakened in my soul. He's already restored me and brought me back. Everything is going to work together for his good and serve his purpose. I don't get the need to get nervous. I don't need to be afraid. I don't need to panic. Everything's under control. Everything's all right. God bless you. Before we pray, I just want to say it's been good to have brother Michael here. And brother Michael shared with me a link of his testimony he shared uh up in Sheffield, Ohio at Brother Samuel Brownings back in July. So if you get a chance, go find Brother Samuel Browning's website. You should be able to find it easily. And go back to July. Do you remember the date? &gt;&gt; July 6. &gt;&gt; July 6th. If you go back to July 6, he shares his testimony and God's done amazing things for that brother. God uses him as a translator and blessed him and many things and so it' be encouraging for you to for for you to hear that. Amen. Also want to greet uh Jacqueline's parents. God bless you. It's good to have you guys here. I failed to greet them on Sunday, but they're here. They've been I think missing their daughter and grandchildren. So, we get the privilege of visiting with you. God bless you. Amen. It's good to have you. God bless you all. Let's bow our heads together and pray. Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful God that God, you have rubbed the Isav of this message in our eyes. God, you've given us eyes to see and ears to hear. for you determined it before the foundation of the world, Lord Jesus. We know there's nothing we could have done to save ourselves, to awaken ourselves, God, but you did it all for us. We're so grateful, Lord. Lord, I believe your favor is as the cloud of the latter rain when you came yourself to shower your life upon us to bring us into that final stage of growth to mature us to complete us Lord for that is the purpose of the latter rain to take the seed Lord at harvest time and to bring that final outpouring that'll last all the way to the end. And God that is what you have done Lord in this age. You've poured yourself into us. It's that final portion, all of you. And it will last all the way till the wheat is gathered into the gardener. Lord, we don't have to look for another one. You've already sent it, Lord. You're already here, present to bring it to pass. We love you. We ask your blessing to be upon us, Lord Jesus. I pray, Father God, that you would, Lord, bless your children. If there's any here that's between two revivals in their own life, may you bring them to that latter rain revival, Lord. May you awaken them to who they are in you and what their purpose is in this life. May you reveal yourself to them. God, we ask that you would bless each one of us as we go from here. Strengthen us, use us, anoint us for your purpose. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Listen friends, as I said in my prayer, that latter rain, Brother Bram describes it as the harvest rain. When that rain falls, it marks the beginning of the harvest season. And the harvest season will end with all the garner being gathered, all the wheat being gathered back to the garner. And that rain provides the last bit of moisture that'll bring the final ripening to the full stage of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, at harvest time, he doesn't send more rain. You don't want rain at harvest time because the seed has to dry out and the presence of the sun. This words has been delivered. So, what he's already given us is the moisture it takes to bring this ride bride to full maturity. &gt;&gt; Now, there's been this dry period. No prophet, no worldwide work, no turning their back and discerning the heart. No, he's already done it. And that was the harvest rain to bring all the moisture, the spirit of God back in us that we need to come to full harvest maturity. &gt;&gt; Now, in this dry period, since the prophet lets the scene, there's moisture. Yes, friends, from the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to the latter rain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's the it's the thing that brings full harvest maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. God bless you as we're dismissed. Let's sing another song. Well, God has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth and healing in her hand. Everlasting joy and gladness in her heart. And in this pride, I've got a part. Well, God has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth and healing in her hand. Everlasting joy and gladness in her heart. And in this bride, I've got a part. Well, God has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth, healing in her hand, everlasting joy and gladness in her heart. And in this bride, I've got a heart one more time. Well, God has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth and healing in her hand. Everlasting joy and gladness in her heart. In this bride, I've got a part. Well, and in this bride I've got a part. Let's go to the key of C. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, oh, it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, well, if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you. If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, oh it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, and if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you, and if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you, it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, oh, it shall quicken your mortal body. If that spirit dwells in you, Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. You have done what this world could not do. Oh, you saved my soul when I was lost.

It didn't take something special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I give him control, he'll be born in me. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start. Live inside this house of clay. Mold me by day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Outwardly I'm nothing. Not much to behold. Hardly the place for his word to unfold. But if I'll just yield this vessel, let him have his way from glory onto glory. He'll change me day by day. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start.
