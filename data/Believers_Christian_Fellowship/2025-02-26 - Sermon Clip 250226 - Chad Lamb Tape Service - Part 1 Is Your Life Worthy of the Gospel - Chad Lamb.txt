TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother bam is is addressing in his prayer here there's a question about what is a Christian Life is it faithfulness to a church is it doing good deeds and to the poor and needy and really what he's going to get down to to the very core of it that we're going to find as your life worthy of the Gospel Living Christian Life is believing God when God's presented to you there are there are manifestations of that there are things that come with obedience but when you get down to the core of it it's not faithfulness to Aur church is not doing good to the needy or the poor it's receiving the word of God in your day that's really what he's going that's the heart of what he's trying to tell us is your life worthy of the gospel and I think we'll see that as we move on let's go to paragraph 39 on page 10 uh page 10 paragraph 39 him speaking directly to Israel the ones that was called To The Feast that I would also apply today to men the church who is bidden to come to the feast that won't do it the spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do they find excuses so what have we bid to we're bid to the spiritual Feast of the Lord he's calling us to come and feast on his word let's go now to page 12 paragraph 53 he says look at our religious system today how can it be that the churches can ever get into the condition that they are now so that's the question how is it that the churches can get into the condition they are now he says is because they rejected and refused the message of God the invitation to come to the feast so what is the message of God it's the invitation to come to the feast so how did the churches get into the condition they are now is because they refused the message of God the invitation to the feast they rejected it and he says could you call a life like that worthy of the Gospel what what kind of Life the one who refuses the invitation to the feast is not worthy of the Gospel he's not then he goes on and he talks about going to the Ball Game and seeing the pastor smoking and and the Baptist Church that lets out listen the problem wasn't the smoking that was the indication that the life had left the church and why were they in that condition they refuse to accept the invitation of the Lord the message of God and because they refused it somewhere longay they find it in a condition brother brandom's not saying because you smoke you're not worthy of the Gospel he says no you smoke because you rejected the gospel and rejecting The Gospel made you Unworthy of the Gospel this is just the outcropping of it this is just the effect that it has so but if if we go through the we're going to go through this entire message but I want you to keep that in your mind brother brandham is not saying your sinful acts make you unworthy worthy of the Gospel he's saying rejecting the message of your hour makes you Unworthy of the gospel and then you have no place to go but into this downward spiral Spiral of immorality so it's not doing good versus not doing good that's not what he's talking about it's accepting the word or rejecting the word that's really what he's talking about
