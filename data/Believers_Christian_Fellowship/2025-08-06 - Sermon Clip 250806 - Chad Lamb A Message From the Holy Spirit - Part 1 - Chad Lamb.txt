TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Why did he give himself for the church? That's verse 25. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blame. So he gave himself so that he could sanctify and cleanse his church by his word by the washing of the water by the word so that he could present to himself a glorious church without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing. &gt;&gt; He did it. He did it himself and he did it for himself. He will have a virgin bride. He will have a virgin bride. He will have a virgin bride &gt;&gt; when in the end time. Where do we live? in the end time. How what's the mechanism he's going to do it? He's going to give himself and shed his own blood, pay the price of redemption and have a sanctifying power by the shedding of blood so that he can sanctify a people. So that he can come and live inside of them. So that he can wash all their wrong all their errors and prostitution and all of this hybridization so he can wash it away with the washing of water by the word. So that he can finally after the washing of the word present to himself. Yes, &gt;&gt; a glorious &gt;&gt; glorious church &gt;&gt; not having spot or wrinkle &gt;&gt; or any such thing but be holy and without blemish. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I tell you that you better be spotless and without wrinkle or any such thing and that you should be holy without blemish, it'd be like popping your bubble. Friends, just let the air out. I can't do that. But he didn't say anything about the bride doing this. This is all him doing it. What do I have to do to stay in this place where I am made spotless and without wrinkle or any such thing and without blemish and holy and presented to him a glorious church? What do I have to do? All I have to do is stay under the pouring out of the water because it's the washing of the water of the word that's doing the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the most blessed people that have ever walked the face of this earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not my trying. It's not my effort. It's not my this, it's not my that. It's 100% if I can just stay in this message that he has. It's a pure clean water to wash away all the prostitute spirits, all the filth of the denominational agent, all the wrong of our hybridization and wrong thinking and the things that we're born with. It's the word that is washing it all away, planting inside us the very mind and life of Jesus Christ to watch so he can present to himself cuz he wants a bride. He wants a virgin bride. He wants to reproduce himself on the earth. Amen. He wants to do it. And he's doing it. And he sent everything he needs to accomplish it with. He brought back the fullness of the word, a pure, clean word with no error in it whatsoever. And he brought back with the word the fullness of his spirit the power to manifest this word. And he has through this message supplied everything that we have need of. All we've got to do is stay under it, friends. &gt;&gt; Don't tamper with it. Don't try to figure it out. Just stay under it. And anything he wants you to know, he'll reveal it to you.
