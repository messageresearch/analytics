[0:00] I saw the light. I saw the light. No
[0:06] more in darkness. No more in night. I am
[0:12] so happy. No sorrow inside. For praise
[0:17] the Lord, I saw the
[0:21] light. I wondered so
[0:24] aimless filled with sin. I wouldn't let
[0:30] my dear Savior in. Then Jesus came like
[0:35] a stranger in the night. Praise the
[0:40] Lord. I saw the light and I saw the
[0:45] light. I saw the light. No more
[0:50] darkness. No more in night. Now I'm so
[0:55] happy. No sorrow
[0:58] inside. Praise the Lord. I saw the
[1:05] light. Just like the blind man, I
[1:08] wandered
[1:10] alone. Worries and cares I claimed for
[1:14] my
[1:15] own. Like the blind man that God gave
[1:19] back his sight. Praise the Lord. I saw
[1:24] the light. And I saw the light. I saw
[1:30] the light. No more darkness. No more in
[1:35] night. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow
[1:41] inside. Praise the Lord. I saw the
[1:47] light. And I was a fool to wander and
[1:52] stray. For straight is the gate and
[1:56] narrow the way. Now I have traded the
[2:01] wrong for the right. Praise the Lord. I
[2:06] saw the light and I saw the light. I saw
[2:12] the light. No more in darkness. No more
[2:17] in night. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow
[2:23] inside. Praise the Lord. I saw the
[2:29] light. And I am resolved no longer to
[2:35] linger. Charmed by the world's
[2:40] delight. Things that are higher. Things
[2:44] that are no. These have the Lord my
[2:48] side.
[2:50] [Music]
[2:51] I will hasten to him. He stands so glad
[2:58] and
[3:00] free.
[3:03] Jesus great is highest. I will come to
[3:08] thee.
[3:11] And I am resolved to go to the Savior.
[3:16] Leave my sin and
[3:20] strive. He is the true one. He is the
[3:25] just one. He hath the words of
[3:30] life. And I will hasten to him. He sings
[3:37] so glad and
[3:40] free.
[3:41] [Music]
[3:43] Jesus great is highest. I will come to
[3:50] thee. I am resolved to follow the Savior
[3:56] faithful and true each
[4:00] day. Headed what he sayith. Do what he
[4:04] will.
[4:06] He is the living
[4:09] way and I will hasten to him. Hasten so
[4:17] glad and free.
[4:20] [Music]
[4:22] Jesus great is high and sky will come to
[4:29] thee and I resolve to enter the kingom.
[4:36] Even the paths of
[4:39] sin friends may oppose messes may beset
[4:44] me. Till I will enter
[4:49] in and I will hasten to him. Hastening
[4:56] so glad and
[4:59] free.
[5:01] Jesus greatest highest. I will come to
[5:08] thee and I am resolved. And you will go
[5:14] with me. Come without
[5:19] delay. Taught by the Bible, led by the
[5:24] spirit. Will walk that heavenly
[5:28] way. And I will hasten to him. Amazing
[5:35] so glad and
[5:38] green.
[5:41] Jesus great is highest. I will come to
[5:47] thee. Oh, and I will hasten to him. He
[5:54] sings so glad and free.

[20:51] Oh my goodness. I'm I'm looking at the
[20:54] beautiful, beautiful heavenly species
[20:57] here. You know what I would have done
[20:59] before? I would have just started from
[21:02] this corner there and just walk and
[21:04] shake everybody's hand and hug those
[21:06] that need to be hugged brothers and just
[21:09] after we have finished that we say let
[21:11] go in the fellowship
[21:12] hall and just have a good time. Uh we we
[21:16] love you so much. I know brother Chad
[21:19] will be will be
[21:21] jealous when I said I love
[21:23] you. Love you.
[21:27] Wow. These three months seemed like it's
[21:30] been
[21:31] uh probably years
[21:34] and uh if I ever told you anything that
[21:38] is inspired,
[21:41] this one is this is the most inspired
[21:43] one.
[21:46] I love you.
[21:48] And thank you so much for all your
[21:49] prayers. Amen. All your love expressed
[21:55] in many ways in texts, in letters, in
[22:00] cards, in phone calls and uh it just
[22:04] tells
[22:06] that we have been raptured together.
[22:10] Yes, sir. Amen.
[22:13] We're sitting in h in heavenly places.
[22:16] Sometimes I cannot just find words to
[22:19] express
[22:21] how the bride of Christ
[22:25] is so valuable and cherished by the
[22:28] almighty and all those that are among
[22:30] the bride themselves.
[22:32] We love you. So I know that we we left
[22:35] here
[22:37] uh beginning of February, end of uh
[22:40] January, beginning of February for those
[22:43] who probably did not know. So we moved
[22:45] up to uh Virginia is closer. It's just 3
[22:49] minutes walking to the DC area. So where
[22:52] we've been appointed with um some
[22:55] projects uh little secret you can't the
[22:59] pullpit but uh so we're there we're
[23:02] preparing and uh it's going to be
[23:03] lingering. So hope I thought probably 6
[23:06] months to a year but seems like it's
[23:08] something that could take a couple of
[23:09] years because it just you know how
[23:11] government work things are heavy and you
[23:14] have too many things that could change
[23:16] every day every every hour. So we're in
[23:21] there but uh I do believe that we were
[23:24] there uh for a purpose God's purpose.
[23:28] It's mostly not just being involved in
[23:30] anything that is with government with
[23:32] the people the high places white house
[23:35] and others but somewhere there there's a
[23:38] seed
[23:40] that uh just needs a little light to
[23:45] come by to come by and we have nothing
[23:49] in ourselves it's just that you just
[23:52] pray every single day God I don't know
[23:53] where you're going to be lending me
[23:55] today who are you going to be putting
[23:58] across my path. Lord, I just don't want
[24:01] to be a hindrance if this is the day
[24:04] that you're going to be lighting that
[24:05] candle. So, that's our our purpose and
[24:09] our motive every single day. And uh it's
[24:12] not it's not easy, but I know that with
[24:14] your prayers, with your love, I have
[24:17] confidence
[24:19] that God will make his purpose to
[24:23] succeed. not men will have nothing to do
[24:26] with him. So just looking up to what he
[24:28] has in store for for us. And before I uh
[24:33] start I again wants to thank want to
[24:38] thank those that came to help that
[24:40] braved the cold winter of January to
[24:43] come to help those two days. I know that
[24:46] if I would have said it a couple weeks
[24:48] ago, the entire church would have been
[24:50] come. I have no doubt that each and
[24:52] every one of you is willing and would
[24:55] have come to to help me. But uh thank
[24:58] you those that could not make it. I know
[25:00] that for uh it was too late and uh but
[25:03] you those that were there I just want to
[25:05] thank all of you guys and all of you
[25:08] guys. I'm greeting bring greetings from
[25:11] uh brother Chad. We texted back uh back
[25:14] there. So he is done with all the
[25:17] services. He's going to be heading back
[25:20] home uh probably tomorrow. So, he's
[25:24] sending his greetings to you all and I
[25:26] am I'm taking his words out of his
[25:29] mouth. Before he can say I love you, I'm
[25:32] telling you I love you
[25:34] already. And also in the DC area, uh we
[25:39] have found a wonderful brother, Pastor
[25:43] Mike Walls. I don't know if many some
[25:45] people have met him at the youth camp.
[25:48] wonderful pastor, wonderful shepherd.
[25:51] He's sending his greetings to you and
[25:53] all the saints there. It's uh it's the
[25:56] church uh in the DC, Maryland, and
[26:00] Virginia area. And uh brothers there,
[26:03] they just like here. They will just hug
[26:05] you and we're just one unit. Told him
[26:07] that we're just one unit. BCF, ICBF, one
[26:11] unit. And they they greet you. They they
[26:14] know you probably not by names but they
[26:17] see you the stream and uh they just want
[26:20] to to send their greetings to you. And
[26:23] anything else I forgot? Let's stand. I
[26:28] don't recall any. If I if I do uh just
[26:31] remind me at the at the end of the
[26:34] service. God bless you. This is not
[26:36] something new. It's something over that
[26:40] uh the Holy Spirit has ministered it
[26:43] here every day in any shape. It's just
[26:47] uh we
[26:48] just reminding us ourselves Amen. of uh
[26:54] the beauty and the purpose of the
[26:57] resurrection. Amen. Easter was the day
[27:01] set up two weeks ago. all the churches,
[27:04] everyone who calls himself a a
[27:06] Christian, they celebrate, but they
[27:08] forgot about it.
[27:10] But Easter for us, it's it's it's our
[27:14] life. It's who we are. And it's just
[27:17] we're going to be speaking something
[27:18] like that and uh have some quotations
[27:21] here. I know the Lord will speak to you.
[27:24] So, not not me. I'm just here
[27:27] probably I don't know. Just pray for me
[27:30] and we'll be together. Amen. Amen. Let's
[27:33] turn to to the word of God this morning
[27:35] and uh read the scripture in the book of
[27:38] uh
[27:42] Luke. Luke chapter
[27:57] 24 chapter 24. We're going to start with
[28:00] uh uh verse 22 uh through 26 and then
[28:03] you will be sitting
[28:06] down. If you are there I can go ahead
[28:09] and start. We can
[28:11] go. 22 says yay a certain women also of
[28:15] our company made us astonished which
[28:18] were early at the separ. This is Cleopus
[28:22] uh
[28:24] speaking one of Jesus disciples. 23 And
[28:28] when they found not his body, they came
[28:31] saying that they had also seen a vision
[28:34] of angels, which said that he was alive.
[28:38] You will see that in this verse, every
[28:40] place there is a there's a life, there's
[28:43] a body to be associated with that life.
[28:46] There cannot be life without a body
[28:48] associated with it. So they knew that
[28:51] life was somewhere and they tried to
[28:54] find the whole morning of the
[28:56] resurrection. The disciples were trying
[28:58] to find where the body was. And could
[29:01] you imagine this is one of the biggest
[29:03] the greatest event we'll go we'll read
[29:05] the prophet about that. And Jesus is not
[29:08] even mentioning telling his disciples or
[29:10] his bodywood. The very the very 11 that
[29:15] left everything for him that they didn't
[29:17] even understand who he was what the
[29:20] ministry was. They followed him three
[29:22] and a half years and here he is
[29:25] resurrecting not even giving them a clue
[29:27] of where his body was. Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:31] And life was there. 24 And as certain of
[29:36] them which were with us went to the
[29:38] separ and found it even so as the women
[29:42] had said, but him they saw not. Then he
[29:46] said unto them, "Oh fools and slow of
[29:48] heart to believe all that the prophets
[29:50] have spoken. Ought not Christ to have
[29:53] suffered these things and to enter into
[29:56] his
[29:57] glory? Ought
[29:59] not Christ to have suffered these things
[30:03] and enter and to enter into his glory."
[30:06] That's Jesus speaking to them. Let's bow
[30:08] our heads and uh just pray for God to
[30:11] anoint his word. Precious Lord, we have
[30:14] read your precious word.
[30:16] Father, men cannot Lord speak about it.
[30:20] It will take the Holy Spirit to take
[30:22] this portion, Father, and minister to
[30:25] each and every one of us. We believe
[30:27] that you're here, Lord. Your children
[30:28] have come for that motive. We have come
[30:30] for that motive, Father. And we believe
[30:32] that you will use us, Father, to speak
[30:35] your word. Let your name be praised in
[30:37] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God
[30:40] bless you. You may be
[30:42] seated. So I uh uh took the title of uh
[30:46] our thought here on um based on the 20
[30:50] verse
[30:51] 26 and the title is Christ ought to
[30:56] enter into his
[30:57] glory. So there was in his resurrection
[31:01] you'll find out that not only he had to
[31:07] suffer he resurrected. Amen. But he his
[31:11] motive his the the the
[31:13] the climax of all that he
[31:17] did was to enter into his glory. Amen.
[31:22] That's the reason he's saying telling
[31:24] them ought not Christ to have suffered
[31:26] these things to go through all he did
[31:30] and to enter into his glory. Amen. So
[31:32] we're going to be looking into
[31:35] Christ entering into his glory. Amen.
[31:38] And the prophet of God. Do you know men
[31:39] how he is? And just think that the
[31:42] disciples with were with him for three
[31:46] and a half
[31:49] years.
[31:52] And through the prophet we can learn
[31:54] that they lived with him, they walked
[31:58] with him, they fished with him,
[32:01] but they did not have a new birth.
[32:03] That's right. Amen.
[32:05] They spoke things that are me memorable
[32:08] in the scriptures today. But even doing
[32:11] that without the new birth
[32:15] and that's why the
[32:16] resurrection was to find a way that they
[32:19] can have the new birth else they would
[32:22] not
[32:23] understand. They would not even
[32:25] understand the kingdom of God. Yeah,
[32:27] that's right. The prophet of God says in
[32:29] the message, the proof of his
[32:30] resurrection preached in
[32:34] 1954 said, "So in order to get the truth
[32:37] to men, God sent his own son made in the
[32:42] likeness of a sinful flesh. And he was
[32:46] born here on earth and was an a
[32:49] propitiation for our sins offered up at
[32:53] Calvary to take away our sins and to
[32:55] give us liberty and to set us free from
[32:57] the prison's house that we've been in.
[33:00] Even his disciples in these last three
[33:03] and a half years. They were shut up in a
[33:06] prison house. That's right.
[33:09] Jesus was speaking things up here and we
[33:13] men disciples Peter although they loved
[33:16] him
[33:19] but they could not get up there. Amen.
[33:21] everything in their mind. Jesus had hard
[33:24] time and this is just think
[33:27] that Jesus is this great Jehovah
[33:34] that tried to condescending for time. I
[33:39] have no time I can tell you probably for
[33:41] eternity just to come to be bottled up
[33:46] in that body. Yeah. I wonder how long
[33:49] his journey took for him to do that. How
[33:53] many layers of deity did he have to peel
[33:56] off of
[33:58] himself? How many clouds that were
[34:00] enshrouding him that had to be separated
[34:03] from him? How many
[34:05] lightnings? How
[34:07] many have nobody lights galaxies were at
[34:11] his feet that has to get rid of them to
[34:15] start condes descending? The one who had
[34:18] no who filled all space and time is we
[34:21] sometimes say how long did it take him
[34:24] to get rid of everything that men would
[34:28] just look at it you'll die right away
[34:30] said I don't want to I don't want to
[34:32] kill them I want to go live with them
[34:35] and not only that my motive is I want to
[34:39] live in them
[34:41] so how long did it take him to do that
[34:46] And as as he came he lived in this this
[34:50] body his
[34:53] language imagine his language his every
[34:56] every time his disciples I like because
[34:58] even everybody was expressing as his
[35:01] disciples when I see Nicodemus going by
[35:04] night I know that you are a good guy but
[35:08] let me stay in my my denomination said
[35:10] if you stay there you're going to die
[35:12] you need to come be born again but as
[35:14] Nicodem Nicodemus went by night. He was
[35:17] representing me. I need to know. Yeah.
[35:20] Yeah.
[35:23] So you'll see that many was far away for
[35:26] men to understand God. Yeah. Jesus was
[35:29] living with them for the three and a
[35:31] half years. Everything he was saying, he
[35:34] knew that they could not have the
[35:36] capacity to understand it. Amen. But
[35:39] he's such a loving father. Amen. Even if
[35:41] you don't understand it, yeah, just love
[35:44] him. Amen.
[35:46] Just love him. It will work out for you.
[35:50] Even if you cannot put it together, just
[35:53] love him. He knows how to do things
[35:56] because he's God. Amen. He said, "Now
[35:59] man is a
[36:00] prisoner." God said that a man was a
[36:03] prisoner.
[36:05] So until something has happened to the
[36:08] man, I want you to get this
[36:12] now that before this certain thing
[36:16] called the new birth, this certain
[36:20] thing, that's the that's only thing
[36:22] that's certain. Until this certain thing
[36:26] called the new birth ever happens to the
[36:28] man, he cannot no way at all understand.
[36:33] Amen.
[36:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Or even
[36:37] understand God or have any knowledge of
[36:40] God. Though the the the word speaks it,
[36:43] his mind can't comprehend it because
[36:46] it's a human mind. Just know human mind.
[36:50] You can have you can split the atom. You
[36:54] can have the AI. You can have all the
[36:57] intelligence that you can have. You can
[37:01] be born of the family that never ne
[37:04] never. They were always correct in
[37:07] everything. But you still have a human
[37:10] mind that can never never understand
[37:14] God. Amen. That's right. How how many
[37:17] humans are here? Oh, we we're in that
[37:20] same company. Amen. Can never understand
[37:24] God.
[37:26] He's got to have the mind of God in him
[37:29] to understand godly things. Amen. So for
[37:33] you to have the mind of God, so God has
[37:36] to give you his mind
[37:42] so there's no boasting there.
[37:45] Because if you get it that opportunity
[37:49] to receive God's mind, he's the one who
[37:52] gave it to you. So there's no way to
[37:54] boasting and say, "Hey, I have the mind
[37:56] of God. You haven't got the mind of
[37:58] God." It doesn't make any sense. Amen.
[38:01] See, so all the reading, all the
[38:04] schools, all the teachings, I mentioned
[38:06] the AI, that's probably the highest
[38:08] teaching right now. The schools, as good
[38:10] as they may be, yet that's not the real
[38:13] principle yet.
[38:16] It would only take one thing. That's
[38:19] right. For you to understand God, he has
[38:22] to inject his mind into you. Amen. Yeah.
[38:26] So your efforts are vain. Amen. my
[38:30] efforts would be vain. Yeah. We need to
[38:33] have his own mind. Excuse me. Thank you,
[38:35] Lord. Amen.
[38:38] And just know that Easter
[38:41] itself, Easter is not even about uh
[38:43] about Jesus. No sir.
[38:47] Easter is not about angels.
[38:50] It's not about seraphims, cherubams.
[38:54] Easter is for you.
[38:56] For you and me. Though human we we just
[39:00] spoke about human when there's nothing
[39:02] in human mind but God in his great mercy
[39:06] wanted that Easter would be for that
[39:09] human I cannot comprehend him but he's
[39:13] willing to come and just inject his life
[39:15] into you that Easter becomes your
[39:19] portion
[39:24] the prophet of God wants to speak about
[39:26] you Before we can start get into our
[39:30] service,
[39:32] he's saying
[39:33] something in the message, the Easter
[39:38] Seal. I'd like to rehearse
[39:42] this pre 65. He said, "Now there's a
[39:47] great statement and I want my minister
[39:50] brothers to try to understand this."
[39:54] See in the beginning we know he speaks
[39:57] he said God was not even God because God
[39:59] is an object of worship but for him to
[40:02] be worshiped he created angels first we
[40:04] know that so everybody knows that but he
[40:07] said something he said that's when his
[40:09] great plan begin to unfold he said but
[40:12] remember you now forget about the one
[40:16] sitting close to you forget the one
[40:19] about sitting behind you in front of you
[40:22] look at yourself where you are. I'm
[40:25] looking at myself where where I am. When
[40:27] he's referring to you, he's referring to
[40:30] this guy. Amen. And to the one who is
[40:32] sitting up there. Amen. Amen. The
[40:35] prophet of God says, "But remember you,
[40:38] that's you. Put your name there in the
[40:42] stature that you are in this
[40:46] morning. If you wasn't in his
[40:49] thinking, then you are not now." Amen.
[40:54] So everybody is here now.
[40:58] Meaning you were in his you were in his
[41:00] thinking.
[41:03] Before even he could think of a star of
[41:06] a moon or the sun, you were in his
[41:10] thinking. Just think God is lifting you
[41:12] up because he wants to talk to you. He's
[41:15] telling who you are. Amen. It's not that
[41:17] man, that human mind that can never
[41:19] understand God. But God has said, "Hey,
[41:22] beside that you cannot understand
[41:25] me without my mind, let me just speak
[41:28] about you first."
[41:31] Amen. He said that for you there is some
[41:36] part that's in you
[41:39] that's eternal.
[41:43] Praise God. Now just think these words,
[41:46] we take them so lightly. Something
[41:48] eternal is something that never had a
[41:51] beginning. Yeah. Will never have an end.
[41:54] How would you possess that? There's some
[41:57] part of
[41:58] you, some part that's in you that's
[42:02] eternal. Yes, sir. Amen. Meaning your
[42:05] origin. It's not what we know. Even what
[42:07] you yourself know right now.
[42:11] It's much greater than what we can we
[42:13] can even um fathom. He said that's
[42:17] eternal and eternal only belongs to
[42:21] God. And in God was his thinking and in
[42:24] God was his thinking of you sitting
[42:28] right where you are now. In God's and
[42:31] and brother Chad has preached this many
[42:34] many times here that God's thought are
[42:36] real are different from our thought.
[42:39] Amen. My thought could be probably, hey,
[42:42] no one day I can become the the American
[42:45] American uh the US
[42:47] president. I can have a thought like
[42:49] that. But if I go into reality, I'm not
[42:53] qualified to to to become it. There are
[42:56] many things that will eliminate me out.
[42:58] Hey, you don't your accent is is is bad.
[43:01] You you you're born out in Africa.
[43:03] You're not even born here. So my thought
[43:06] would be a good thought to just
[43:08] entertain me. But the reality is I can
[43:10] never become that. But God's thought are
[43:13] tangible. They are real.
[43:17] Today
[43:18] is May 4th. In his thought at this very
[43:23] moment, you are sitting where you're
[43:25] sitting there.
[43:27] You cannot take yourself out of that pew
[43:29] right now. Because in God's thought, you
[43:31] were supposed to be exactly where you're
[43:33] sitting here this morning. Amen. He
[43:36] said, "Sitting right where you are now,
[43:38] in his thinking, I stood at the pulpit
[43:40] this morning because he's infinite and
[43:43] knows all things. Therefore, he could
[43:46] tell the end from the beginning because
[43:48] he's eternal." Amen.
[43:51] What how beautiful it is that God is
[43:54] telling his children on earth the end
[43:57] from the beginning. Amen. Amen.
[44:02] And you being a son of God or a daughter
[44:06] of God, I'm still talking about you.
[44:10] You being a son of God or a daughter of
[44:12] God, then you were in his thinking at
[44:15] the beginning. Yes, sir. Not the
[44:18] beginning of Genesis 1,
[44:20] the beginning of John 1:1.
[44:26] Meaning the et we were in the eternity
[44:29] with him.
[44:31] And when the Holy Spirit come and you
[44:34] are on earth walking around as as a
[44:37] sinner way down in your life, there is
[44:41] something
[44:43] when we were in
[44:45] sin. Something was inside of each and
[44:48] every one of us. Amen.
[44:52] You don't know what's taking place, but
[44:55] you are hungry.
[44:58] I have testimonies of people that were
[45:00] hungry.
[45:02] Something inside of them that could not
[45:04] even understand. You couldn't even tell
[45:05] a friend, kids that, hey, there's
[45:07] something in me, they would not even
[45:08] understand. You think you were crazy,
[45:10] but something inside
[45:14] there, something that you never put in
[45:18] there.
[45:22] You never put that thing inside there.
[45:26] It's something that you couldn't even
[45:29] desire to be in there because we're
[45:33] human, right? Just think of it. God
[45:36] could have knocked at your door and
[45:38] said, "My son, my daughter, this is the
[45:41] plan I have of eternal life. I want you
[45:45] to have this." You and I with a human
[45:48] mind, we would said, "Get out of here."
[45:52] Yep. Amen. True.
[45:55] It says something you couldn't even
[45:58] desire to be in there
[46:02] to be a Christian. It's the greatest
[46:05] miracle ever happened to man.
[46:08] The heavenly miracle.
[46:12] You couldn't even desire to be there.
[46:16] God could have handed out eternal life.
[46:19] He said, "Come and take it." He said,
[46:20] "Get out of here.
[46:23] I don't want
[46:24] it. And he
[46:28] said, it's
[46:29] something that's contrary to your own
[46:33] nature.
[46:36] Human nature.
[46:38] It's contrary to human nature. Eternal
[46:40] life, it's contrary to human nature.
[46:44] That's why God put us into human nature.
[46:47] Yeah. To prove that he's God. that deity
[46:52] can never remain in a human nature.
[46:54] That's why we have to be raptured and
[46:55] live eternally. Amen. Amen.
[47:00] It's the fornowledge of God that's
[47:02] taking place, God's word. And we know
[47:05] that God's word is a thought
[47:08] expressed. So in God's thinking, you are
[47:11] coming into an
[47:14] expression, into a manifestation. God
[47:17] wants you to become a reality. Amen.
[47:21] Now coming
[47:23] to the Easter time after the
[47:28] resurrection of Jesus
[47:31] Christ. The prophet of God says that
[47:33] this is the greatest of all things that
[47:36] Jesus ever done on
[47:38] earth. Now think what Jesus went through
[47:41] for you and me. Amen. The suffering he
[47:45] went through. Amen.
[47:48] The rejection the prophet of God says he
[47:51] he was hated from his birth even to the
[47:54] cross.
[47:56] Hated
[47:58] for you
[48:00] never had a
[48:02] reputation. And think of all those
[48:04] things and how they mocked him and he
[48:07] was put spit on him and and the prophet
[48:10] of God
[48:11] says he says of all the days and all of
[48:15] the things that Jesus
[48:16] did and certainly appreciating all of
[48:19] his vindication of God's word and what
[48:22] he did to fulfill it of healing the
[48:26] sick, raising the dead, casting out
[48:29] devils, preaching the gospel to the
[48:32] poor, fulfilling every word. Listen, the
[48:35] things that he's been doing,
[48:37] not for himself, for others. Amen. Amen.
[48:41] Doing it for you, doing it for
[48:43] me. All the healing, raising the dead,
[48:47] and casting out the devil, devils,
[48:49] preaching the gospel to the poor,
[48:51] fulfilling every word that God said that
[48:53] he would do when he came. and then also
[48:57] suffering for our sins in ourstead to be
[49:00] the propitiation for sin at the cross
[49:04] where no one else could have done it but
[49:06] him.
[49:08] But above all of
[49:10] that, I think Easter sealed the whole
[49:13] thing.
[49:15] Amen. Amen. That's more than I even I
[49:18] can even understand it myself as a
[49:20] human.
[49:22] But because there had been prophets on
[49:24] earth who had prophesied before him,
[49:28] there had been prophets on the earth who
[49:30] had healed the sick, even raised the
[49:34] dead and done the same signs that Jesus
[49:36] did.
[49:38] You say, well, crucifi crucifixion was
[49:41] great, but many men had died. Yes, many
[49:46] men had been crucified. Amen. Even in
[49:50] the same days our Lord was crucified.
[49:56] But there was only one
[49:59] of them who rose up from the dead that
[50:02] sealed it. And remember when he rose
[50:05] from the
[50:06] dead, there were three seals that that
[50:09] were on man that shut up man. Every
[50:12] prophet, everyone who came into the
[50:14] world was shut up under those three
[50:16] seals. There was a seal of death, seal
[50:19] of hell, and seal of grave. The grave.
[50:22] But when he rose that morning, he took
[50:25] the key of all those three seals. He
[50:27] overcome them for you. Amen. Prophet of
[50:32] God says that it sealed the word of God
[50:35] forever. And now he says,
[50:39] "Oh, what a privilege it
[50:42] is to know that there is something in
[50:45] the resurrection that's pertaining to
[50:47] us."
[50:50] Others were good stories. I want
[50:52] something that pertains to me.
[50:56] The resurrection has something that
[50:59] pertains to you.
[51:02] Let's read the scripture in the book of
[51:04] John.
[51:07] Please pray for us. John chapter
[51:15] 20 verse
[51:18] 19. It's when Jesus uh
[51:28] resurrected. This is what the
[51:31] resurrection brings to us.
[51:39] John 20:19
[51:44] goes, "Same day, then the same day at
[51:49] evening being the first day of the week,
[51:53] when the doors were
[51:54] shut, where the disciples were assembled
[51:57] for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and
[52:00] stood in the midst, and saith unto them,
[52:03] Peace be unto you.
[52:06] Amen. In the resurrection, there was
[52:08] something that pertains to you. The true
[52:11] resurrection of Jesus Christ should
[52:14] bring you peace.
[52:17] If you do not have
[52:19] peace, there's nothing else that will
[52:22] bring you peace.
[52:24] Pray for Easter to come your way. Amen.
[52:29] Amen.
[52:31] And when he had he had so said, he
[52:34] showed unto them his hands and his
[52:37] sight. Then were the disciples glad when
[52:41] they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to
[52:44] them again, "Peace be unto you. As my
[52:49] father has sent me, even so send you."
[52:52] Amen. The resurrection, what he brings
[52:55] to you, things that pertains to you, he
[52:58] brings you peace and he will send you.
[53:01] And you know how he sends the prophet of
[53:04] God said the father sent him by entering
[53:07] into him. Amen. He wants to enter his
[53:10] resurrection is Easter. He's going to be
[53:14] feasting in you. Amen. It pertains to
[53:17] you. Amen. And when he said 20 22 And
[53:22] when he said he had said this, he
[53:24] breathed on them and said unto them,
[53:27] receive ye the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[53:30] Whosoever sins that you remit, they are
[53:32] remitted unto them. And whosoever sins
[53:35] you rem you retain, they are retained.
[53:37] So the
[53:38] resurrection, the part that pertains to
[53:41] you in this resurrection, his peace is
[53:45] with you. Amen. And it's a peace that
[53:49] passes all understanding.
[53:53] The resurrection Easter should give you
[53:57] that as your portion.
[54:01] As let's go back again to the the
[54:03] reading of the scripture of uh where we
[54:06] started the book of
[54:09] Luke. We can see um Cleopus and his
[54:13] friend on the road as the prophet of
[54:15] God.
[54:16] uh explained it to us
[54:20] here. And all of this we're building
[54:23] up
[54:24] to come to find
[54:27] how would
[54:29] Christ complete his
[54:32] resurrection because he could have
[54:35] suffered and died the the the death that
[54:38] was so cruel and even
[54:42] resurrected. But if he's not entering
[54:45] into his glory, even his resurrection is
[54:48] in vain for you. He ought to enter into
[54:52] his glory. And we will be able to see
[54:55] that as we we
[54:57] progress. 24. We can start at
[55:00] 13 that we skipped because we I didn't
[55:03] want you to stand up for a long time.
[55:08] 13 says, "And behold, two of them went
[55:11] that same day to a village called Emmas,
[55:14] which was from Jerusalem about three
[55:16] score furlongs, and they talked together
[55:20] of all these things which has happened."
[55:23] that the prophet of God is telling us.
[55:25] He said, "And here in the the message,
[55:28] the curtain of time,
[55:30] 1955." And here they are on their road
[55:32] going over to their place, walking along
[55:36] the
[55:37] road. I just like to listen in on
[55:40] them. Wouldn't you just a minute stand
[55:44] around? And the prophet is now before
[55:47] Jesus could meet them, the prophet of
[55:49] God is wanting you and I to listen in on
[55:53] them,
[55:55] to walk with them before Jesus meets
[55:57] them. So only the prophet of God could
[55:59] tell do say something like that. He
[56:02] said, he said, "I would like to listen
[56:05] in on them. Wouldn't you just a minute
[56:08] stand around and see what they were
[56:09] saying?" Amen.
[56:12] Let's see what they were saying that the
[56:15] Bible didn't record that before Jesus
[56:18] could could come what they were saying
[56:20] among themselves. He said I I hear one
[56:23] of them saying well Cleopus what do you
[56:27] think about
[56:30] it? I'm
[56:33] disappointed. Well I guess we'll just
[56:35] have to face the preacher again.
[56:39] Meaning the churches that came out of
[56:42] Yeah. told the preacher that we found
[56:44] the Messiah. We found the the prophet of
[56:48] Galilee. They had to rewind that back to
[56:52] go back that he wasn't. So we thought he
[56:55] was the one to bring us
[56:58] salvation to free the children of Israel
[57:00] from the bondage of sin or from the
[57:03] Romans. It seems like things didn't go
[57:07] the way we thought.
[57:09] I'm
[57:10] disappointed. He said, I guess we we
[57:12] were wrong in this fellow called
[57:16] Jesus. My I hate to do that. My
[57:20] confidence was really built up in him.
[57:23] And these were the people that loved
[57:26] him.
[57:30] We can love him and fully misunderstand
[57:34] him
[57:35] and we'll be in the confusion.
[57:39] They were in confusion. They loved him.
[57:41] They served him. They wanted to give
[57:42] their lives to him. But because they
[57:45] were still in human mind, they could not
[57:48] know understand what was happening in
[57:51] the supernatural.
[57:54] And the good thing is because they were
[57:56] were speaking and talking about him.
[57:59] That's the best thing to do. Even if you
[58:01] don't understand it, just speak about
[58:04] him. Amen. Praise the Lord. You have no
[58:08] idea. Just love him. The first thing,
[58:10] love him and just speak about him.
[58:13] That's what they did.
[58:16] And notice while while they spake about
[58:18] him, talked about him, he appeared.
[58:22] Amen. That's a good way to get him
[58:25] around you.
[58:26] How many wants him around you? Amen.
[58:30] How many wants that stranger to appear
[58:33] in your live lively day daily
[58:36] life and he said talk about him all the
[58:40] time. Keep your
[58:43] conversation not on whose or where the
[58:45] next play comes on the television but
[58:48] speak about him. Amen. Amen. Talk about
[58:51] him, sing about him, love him, keep him
[58:54] on your heart and mind all the day and
[58:58] night.
[59:00] You do that, you have the assurance that
[59:04] he will be walking with you.
[59:10] He said, you go to singing hymns and you
[59:14] start reading the Bible and that that
[59:17] stranger will appear to you too. Praise
[59:20] the Lord. I want that stranger to appear
[59:22] to me too.
[59:25] How can he appear to you? You just love
[59:27] him. Keep talking about him. Forget
[59:30] about what the world has to say this and
[59:32] that tomorrow. Talk about him. Sing
[59:34] hymns to him. Amen.
[59:39] Said the Christian live on the word.
[59:45] He said in the other message shalom. He
[59:48] said the reason he doesn't appear to so
[59:51] many of us
[59:52] today, our conversation is talking about
[59:56] everything else but Christ.
[59:59] We're always talking about when we're
[1:00:02] going to get the work done, what we're
[1:00:04] going to do here. Let your conversation
[1:00:07] be on
[1:00:09] Christ. That's when he appears is when
[1:00:12] you talk about him. Be speaking about
[1:00:15] him. You do that and you will see what
[1:00:17] happens.
[1:00:19] Amen. And the prophet of God says that
[1:00:22] even to get rid of
[1:00:25] devils, just say good thing. Yeah.
[1:00:30] The devil will will leave you saying
[1:00:32] good thing. You didn't even pray. When
[1:00:35] the Senician woman came to Jesus, her
[1:00:38] her daughter was vexed with the devils.
[1:00:40] Yeah. And she came asking Jesus to heal
[1:00:43] her. Jesus never said, "I'm healing her
[1:00:45] or I'm doing this." Jesus spoke and
[1:00:48] said, "It's not good to give the the the
[1:00:50] food to the dogs." Yeah. She responded.
[1:00:53] She said, "Yay, Lord. Even the dogs can
[1:00:55] get something from the crumbs of the
[1:00:57] tables." Yeah.
[1:01:00] And Jesus said, "The devils are have
[1:01:02] left." Because of just what you said,
[1:01:07] what you spoke about, devils left your
[1:01:09] your daughter. Jesus never prayed for
[1:01:11] her. Amen. And the prophet of God say
[1:01:15] that's the way to get rid of the devils.
[1:01:18] Right?
[1:01:20] Talk about Jesus.
[1:01:22] Say something loyal,
[1:01:25] something real. Yeah. Devils will flee
[1:01:29] from you.
[1:01:31] Yes. And then we continue in 15 verse
[1:01:34] 15. We go a little verse by verse here.
[1:01:36] A little study. And it came to pass that
[1:01:39] while they communed together and
[1:01:42] reasoned, communing we know that is
[1:01:44] talking to have fellowship, talk with
[1:01:47] each other. While they
[1:01:50] communed communed together and reason
[1:01:54] and
[1:01:56] reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and
[1:02:00] went with them.
[1:02:02] The prophet of God says we need to draw
[1:02:05] nigh unto God so he will draw nigh unto
[1:02:08] us friends. That's right. But everything
[1:02:11] else has has took the place of the
[1:02:14] prayer meeting. That's the reason he's
[1:02:17] not drawing near
[1:02:19] us. And he said sometimes we don't have
[1:02:22] a victory that we ought to have in our
[1:02:26] lives
[1:02:28] because of the way we talk. Do we talk
[1:02:31] about him or talk about something else?
[1:02:34] Victory comes through what is coming out
[1:02:37] of your mouth. Amen. What is brewing
[1:02:39] from inside out? He said that gives you
[1:02:42] a victory.
[1:02:44] He said I believe that's the reason
[1:02:46] people don't have the victory in their
[1:02:48] heart that they they should have is
[1:02:51] because their thoughts are on other
[1:02:55] things. Right.
[1:02:57] But these two disciples were still
[1:03:00] walking with them. Their thoughts and
[1:03:03] their mind were upon the one they loved
[1:03:06] so much though they didn't even
[1:03:08] understand him. Yeah.
[1:03:10] But because they were walking with
[1:03:12] walking thinking about him, talking
[1:03:14] about him, he appeared to them. Amen.
[1:03:19] And the prophet of God says that
[1:03:21] sometimes God lets things happen so that
[1:03:26] we will draw nigh unto him. Amen.
[1:03:29] Something happen. Yes sir. Some little
[1:03:33] trial that comes in our lives. Give us
[1:03:36] victory. Amen. Why is he allowing that?
[1:03:40] He see he can notice that you have
[1:03:43] you're not even talking about him. your
[1:03:44] mind is something great you want to
[1:03:46] accomplish and then he
[1:03:49] allows he permits Satan to come up with
[1:03:52] little trial
[1:03:56] so you can draw near him he knows how to
[1:04:00] do that
[1:04:03] for God has surely ordained that certain
[1:04:05] events must take place they will unfold
[1:04:08] just as his great time clock ticks it
[1:04:12] off
[1:04:16] 16 But their eyes were hardened that
[1:04:19] they should not know
[1:04:22] him. As we said, they didn't even
[1:04:24] recognize him.
[1:04:28] In the message, the mighty conqueror,
[1:04:30] the prophet of God says, "Why? There's
[1:04:32] been many times God's walked right with
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:38] and me,
[1:04:39] and you didn't recognize him.
[1:04:43] He's done that over and over for each
[1:04:46] and every one of us here walking with us
[1:04:49] and we never recognize it. Amen. He
[1:04:52] said, "Who kept you from getting that
[1:04:54] wreck the other day?"
[1:04:57] The little accident, the car that was
[1:04:59] headed your way, who protected you from
[1:05:02] that? He was walking with you. Amen.
[1:05:07] He said, "Who was it out there at the
[1:05:09] hospital when the doctor said, "Well,
[1:05:11] there ain't hardly anything no more I
[1:05:13] can do."
[1:05:16] He was walking with you and you got out
[1:05:19] out of the
[1:05:20] hospital and you got well. Who did that?
[1:05:24] Where did it come
[1:05:26] from? You didn't recognize it. I didn't
[1:05:29] recognize it. I'm sincere.
[1:05:33] But it was his grace and it was he that
[1:05:36] did that thing for
[1:05:39] you. And these people that loved
[1:05:43] him, they spoke about
[1:05:45] him. And as they were going couldn't
[1:05:49] even understand anything, but their
[1:05:52] understanding, misunderstanding was not
[1:05:55] hindering God from revealing himself to
[1:05:57] them. Amen.
[1:05:59] Because they were his before the
[1:06:02] foundation of the world. Hardly they
[1:06:04] didn't even realize that every step of
[1:06:08] the way they were writing the scripture.
[1:06:10] Yeah. Right. Amen. As they were walking
[1:06:14] their
[1:06:15] sad, the Holy Spirit was using their
[1:06:18] very lives. Yeah. Even in their
[1:06:20] misunderstanding, even in their sadness
[1:06:23] to write the scripture. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:27] Sometimes it's through your trials that
[1:06:30] you think that this is just unbearable.
[1:06:32] Did I sin? Did I do something
[1:06:36] wrong? The script scripture is being
[1:06:39] written by the hand of the almighty.
[1:06:42] When you feel like it I'm no value at
[1:06:44] all. I have nothing. It's just
[1:06:46] everything is just being torn apart.
[1:06:50] That's when God is writing scripture
[1:06:52] using you because you are a written
[1:06:55] epistle. No, don't forget that. Amen.
[1:06:57] Amen. Amen. The prophet of God says in
[1:06:59] the in the message when their eyes were
[1:07:02] opened, he had promised it, but they
[1:07:05] were sad and all beat out and everything
[1:07:09] they thought they had lost everything
[1:07:11] they had and everything had failed and
[1:07:16] it was the darkest hour that I guess
[1:07:19] they had ever seen.
[1:07:21] You might be sometimes God allow us to
[1:07:24] go through those moment in moments in
[1:07:26] our
[1:07:27] lives in the darkest hour we don't
[1:07:31] things don't just click as they used to
[1:07:34] something is just what is going on God
[1:07:36] why am I facing
[1:07:38] this don't forget he's walking with you
[1:07:42] and if allowed that to be in your life
[1:07:45] he's writing a scripture
[1:07:48] that you are unaware of in that very
[1:07:52] moment. Amen.
[1:07:54] They had hopes in him and believed in
[1:07:57] him and seen his great manifestation of
[1:08:01] miracles and signs and wonders, all the
[1:08:03] vindication of the Messiah. And then to
[1:08:06] see him stand there, bruised, just torn
[1:08:10] apart and crucified, being spit on. The
[1:08:14] one who used to one time to sneak out
[1:08:17] and just go. They couldn't find him. Now
[1:08:19] he's been held in the hand of people
[1:08:21] that didn't even have enough muscles.
[1:08:24] Two two guys there holding him. He
[1:08:26] couldn't even run. He couldn't do
[1:08:27] anything. Couldn't defend
[1:08:29] himself. Been completely just
[1:08:33] just torn apart and just uh crucified.
[1:08:37] And they couldn't believe that. They
[1:08:39] couldn't they they
[1:08:40] couldn't put together this mighty
[1:08:43] prophet of Galilee
[1:08:46] and the men they are seeing now on the
[1:08:48] cross. Yeah.
[1:08:50] Not knowing that this
[1:08:53] Jesus was to become Christ. Meaning his
[1:08:57] Jesus was being being completely torn
[1:09:00] down, beaten up, Christ was rising up.
[1:09:05] Amen.
[1:09:07] They couldn't see that in so much that
[1:09:10] even after Jesus resurrected, he never
[1:09:12] mentioned any place about Jesus. He
[1:09:14] always pointed them to Christ. Yeah. He
[1:09:18] wanted to show them that this body
[1:09:20] you're saying, you're seeing, you
[1:09:22] couldn't even find it in the grave, that
[1:09:25] body has nothing, no virtue for you. It
[1:09:27] has, it did the work. Amen. Now, the
[1:09:30] body that should be found, it's your
[1:09:33] body.
[1:09:35] Amen. It's not me. Yeah.
[1:09:38] in so much that when when when he
[1:09:41] died I I don't I don't want to to to to
[1:09:44] burn the the pages here but remember
[1:09:48] that the first
[1:09:51] Adam was put to death also one time the
[1:09:56] reason he was put to death was
[1:09:58] to God to bring out
[1:10:02] the bride to him
[1:10:05] and the prophet of God we'll read it
[1:10:06] later on that he had
[1:10:09] both masculine and feminist spirit.
[1:10:16] So the feminist spirit
[1:10:18] was pulled out put into his bride.
[1:10:24] He remained with remained with the
[1:10:27] masculine spirit. Mhm.
[1:10:30] The reason Eve could
[1:10:33] sin, she only had a part of the spirit
[1:10:36] of Adam, right? Jesus didn't want to do
[1:10:38] that on Calvary. If he had only a part,
[1:10:42] if we only had a part of his spirit, we
[1:10:45] wouldn't
[1:10:46] overcome. His entire
[1:10:50] spirit has to be put into you. That's
[1:10:54] the reason his body is up there as a
[1:10:57] memorial lifeless.
[1:11:00] Adam after the resurrection. His
[1:11:03] resurrection he lived. His body still
[1:11:05] has the spirit. Yeah.
[1:11:08] Jesus
[1:11:09] body it's up there as a memorial. His
[1:11:12] spirit is on earth. Amen. The fullness,
[1:11:15] not a part. Yeah. Eve had a part of that
[1:11:18] spirit. That's why she could not
[1:11:20] overcome with a part of it. Yeah. Jesus
[1:11:23] never want you to have a part of his
[1:11:24] spirit. Amen.
[1:11:27] Lord getting it? Yeah. Amen. The
[1:11:29] fullness of his spirit. The prophet of
[1:11:32] God will say that that body could be
[1:11:34] here of Jesus would be here because he
[1:11:38] has pulled back into Christ. Even when
[1:11:42] after the resurrection, you will see
[1:11:43] that he pointed them back to Christ. He
[1:11:46] said Christ, he spoke about Moses. He
[1:11:48] referred to Moses and the prophets.
[1:11:50] Moses meaning that he went back to
[1:11:52] Genesis, went back to Exodus and
[1:11:54] Leviticus. That's what he meant. Jesus
[1:11:57] was not in in in Genesis.
[1:12:01] But Christ was there and Christ never
[1:12:04] left the earth. That's the reason his
[1:12:06] body has to be taken up as a memorial.
[1:12:08] He's saying you don't get it. Take your
[1:12:10] eyes off of Jesus, this body.
[1:12:13] Put your your your eyes on Christ. Amen.
[1:12:16] Because Christ is on earth. Amen. And
[1:12:19] he's the one who's going to be living in
[1:12:21] you. I Jesus, my body, I can split up to
[1:12:23] live in you.
[1:12:26] Amen. It has to be up there as a
[1:12:28] memorial. Yeah. So that the fullness of
[1:12:31] deity That's right. that once
[1:12:33] tabernacled in him
[1:12:36] so he can come. It just come inside of
[1:12:39] you. Amen.
[1:12:42] 18 And the one of them whose name was
[1:12:45] Cleopus answering said unto him, "Art
[1:12:47] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and
[1:12:51] has not known the things which are come
[1:12:53] to pass there in these
[1:12:56] days?" And I like how Jesus goes, and he
[1:12:59] said unto them, "What things?" Like he
[1:13:01] didn't know
[1:13:02] anything. I love it.
[1:13:05] And they said unto they said unto him
[1:13:07] concerning Jesus of Nazareth, you see
[1:13:10] where they were
[1:13:12] they were stuck at Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:17] But he wanted them to come up higher to
[1:13:19] come into Christ. That's when Paul was
[1:13:22] coming teaching the Romans and other the
[1:13:25] Corinthians. Paul is changing. He said
[1:13:27] this Jesus is Christ. Yeah. They could
[1:13:31] his disciples could not connect the dot.
[1:13:33] could not see that he is his ministry is
[1:13:37] pointing to Christ.
[1:13:43] They still
[1:13:45] had the Jesus of Nazareth
[1:13:49] which was a prophet mighty in deed and
[1:13:52] word before God and all the people. But
[1:13:55] they could not pass that to be connected
[1:13:58] to Christ because God had to give them
[1:14:02] his mind so they could be able to see
[1:14:05] that. Amen. Amen. The prophet of God
[1:14:07] says in the message in when their eyes
[1:14:10] were opened they knew him. The same
[1:14:13] 164 he said what things just like he
[1:14:17] didn't know nothing about it. See he
[1:14:20] said that just to throw them off. God
[1:14:23] does that. Yeah. Sometimes
[1:14:26] and he did that
[1:14:28] purposely just to
[1:14:30] try. And don't you know he doesn't
[1:14:34] change his nature. He doesn't He does
[1:14:37] the same thing to try you see what you
[1:14:41] will do. God does that. Amen.
[1:14:45] He tries you to see what you will do.
[1:14:49] He will work around some way. It will be
[1:14:53] throwed before you and just to see what
[1:14:57] you would say about it.
[1:15:01] He comes to yourself that you can
[1:15:04] testify. Yes. You said Cleopus, I want
[1:15:07] to to listen to you. What things? You
[1:15:10] tell me what you know about this about
[1:15:12] the the the manifestation of the word of
[1:15:15] this hour. Tell me what you know.
[1:15:19] Now he's asking him when Cleopus is not
[1:15:22] expecting him to tell him directly or
[1:15:24] excited. No, he's in the his darkest
[1:15:27] hour. He said, "What things?" You tell
[1:15:29] me. You testify. You profess it from
[1:15:31] your own mouth. I want to listen to you.
[1:15:33] What you know about the message of the
[1:15:34] hour. What you know about the
[1:15:36] vindication of the your the word of your
[1:15:38] hour, you tell me. I want to listen.
[1:15:41] Amen. To that
[1:15:43] and Cleopus started.
[1:15:46] Amen. In our day, we would have been
[1:15:50] telling him in our day, God sent a
[1:15:53] mighty prophet, William Brham, and he
[1:15:56] preached. The seals were open, and now
[1:15:59] we saw him going into an accident. And
[1:16:02] now there are people that's waiting for
[1:16:03] him to come and uh have a tent meeting.
[1:16:08] He was still listening. I want you from
[1:16:10] your own mouth, you testify.
[1:16:14] just want to to to to to hear what you
[1:16:17] say about it. He wants to see your
[1:16:20] attitude. Yes, sir. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:23] Others are saying that facts are showing
[1:16:26] that this message is not. We're still
[1:16:28] waiting for another one. What attitude
[1:16:30] do you have towards that? What are you
[1:16:32] saying about that?
[1:16:35] He wants to see your attitude. The way
[1:16:37] you take what you think about it. He
[1:16:39] does that purposely.
[1:16:44] does it yet because that's his
[1:16:46] unchanging nature. He did the old He did
[1:16:49] it the old times. They were in
[1:16:53] desperation and the prophet of God says
[1:16:56] in desperation that's when the best
[1:16:58] things come comes out of you.
[1:17:02] So Cleopus was able to testify to him
[1:17:06] what he humanely knew of good about this
[1:17:10] prophet.
[1:17:12] God sometimes puts us in a in a in a
[1:17:15] position that we would testify of all
[1:17:18] that we know that's good about this
[1:17:20] message before he can step in. Amen.
[1:17:24] He wants us to consider this message
[1:17:26] that what has happened and this is not
[1:17:28] men doing it though I don't understand
[1:17:30] it. I don't know it but I love it and I
[1:17:33] knew that this was him that was supposed
[1:17:35] to come. Amen.
[1:17:39] Praise God. And
[1:17:42] 20 and how the chief priests and our
[1:17:45] ruler delivered him to be condemned to
[1:17:48] to to death and have crucified
[1:17:51] him. But he said something that was
[1:17:54] truthful. The truth he said, but we
[1:17:58] trusted. I can't explain it. I don't
[1:18:01] understand everything, but we trusted.
[1:18:04] It still was in the past. We trusted
[1:18:07] that it had been he which should have
[1:18:09] redeemed Israel. And beside all of this,
[1:18:12] today is the third day since these
[1:18:14] things were done. Yay. And certain women
[1:18:18] also of our company made us astonishes,
[1:18:21] speaking about Mary Magdalene and other
[1:18:23] Marys which were early the sepiler. And
[1:18:27] when they found not his
[1:18:30] body, Jesus probably where he was said,
[1:18:33] "These are still looking for my body."
[1:18:36] They're not getting it right.
[1:18:41] My mighty my body is not the final
[1:18:43] resting place of this deity. Amen.
[1:18:46] Praise the Lord. Therefor it's it's it's
[1:18:49] it's your body. They they didn't even
[1:18:51] know that they were a part of that
[1:18:52] resurrection. It's said they're still
[1:18:54] looking at my body, looking for it.
[1:19:02] And remember when uh the woman at the
[1:19:05] well, Jesus was there standing, came to
[1:19:10] her, she was bragging about the well of
[1:19:13] Jacob. Oh, this is Jacob's well. You
[1:19:16] know the prophets, mighty men have
[1:19:18] drunk, taken a drink out of it. mighty
[1:19:21] prophets, my king, the and even the sons
[1:19:24] of of Jacob, even their their camels
[1:19:28] have taken a drink out of it. Jesus
[1:19:31] could there probably shaking his she's
[1:19:34] looking at the past. That well has no
[1:19:36] virtue. The true well I'm standing here
[1:19:39] and she cannot see it. That's the same
[1:19:42] thing that was happening that evening
[1:19:45] with the Cleopus and his friend or the
[1:19:47] his body they couldn't find it. Jesus
[1:19:50] thinking body. Cleopus doesn't even know
[1:19:53] that he's a part of that body. He's
[1:19:56] still looking for it. Yeah. Cuz this one
[1:19:59] came to serve a purpose. This is a
[1:20:01] creature of time.
[1:20:04] The prophet of God says that the sunship
[1:20:06] is not eternal. Yeah. That's right.
[1:20:09] Jesus was made God came in time. That's
[1:20:13] right. Was made a creature of time to
[1:20:15] redeem us so he can go back to deity.
[1:20:18] Amen. To find his glory. We'll come to
[1:20:21] that. Hopefully Lor will help us.
[1:20:25] In the message communion
[1:20:27] 1962, the prophet of God says, "Now we
[1:20:30] want to think of Jesus and associate him
[1:20:33] what he
[1:20:35] was. What is he? What is his
[1:20:38] body? What is the body of Christ? It's
[1:20:42] the body of believers that's associated
[1:20:46] with him in the Holy Spirit." So Cleopus
[1:20:49] and his friend Mary Magdalene and
[1:20:51] others, they were looking for the body.
[1:20:53] And no wonder Jesus could not even give
[1:20:55] them a clue cuz it would confuse them.
[1:20:57] Right? You're looking for it.
[1:21:00] You are a part of that body. My body
[1:21:04] will do nothing. I've done my work. The
[1:21:06] work that was that was ordained for me
[1:21:09] to do to finish, I've done it. Now it's
[1:21:12] the Holy Spirit that's making way his
[1:21:14] way into the real body of whom you are.
[1:21:19] Amen. Of whom you are a part of.
[1:21:23] It's the body of the believers that
[1:21:25] associated with him in the Holy Spirit,
[1:21:28] not an idol. They want to make the body
[1:21:31] of Jesus an idol. And this generation is
[1:21:34] doing the same thing. Amen. We can even
[1:21:36] be in the message making that body the
[1:21:40] body that was crucified on Calvary. We
[1:21:42] can make it an idol. Yeah. And Jesus did
[1:21:45] not didn't like that. No. He didn't want
[1:21:47] that body to be made an idol. Yeah. For
[1:21:50] the people to go to have maybe to go and
[1:21:53] pilgrimage and just go see that body. He
[1:21:56] did not want that. Amen. Because he has
[1:21:59] a body. You will find that body.
[1:22:01] Amen. And you and I are part of that
[1:22:04] body. Amen. That's the reason they could
[1:22:06] not find it there. But they can find it
[1:22:08] today. It's sitting up there.
[1:22:11] Lord
[1:22:13] said, not an idol, not a piece of bread,
[1:22:17] but a spirit that's in the heart of the
[1:22:20] believer. Amen.
[1:22:22] What is his
[1:22:24] body? The prophet is giving us an
[1:22:26] answer. It might not be the way we
[1:22:28] think, but he's putting us into another
[1:22:30] realm, into another dimension. What is
[1:22:32] that body? He said it's a spirit
[1:22:37] that's in the heart of the believer.
[1:22:41] That's where the body is. If his spirit
[1:22:44] is in you, within you, Yes, sir. you are
[1:22:47] that body that were that Cleopus was
[1:22:49] looking for.
[1:22:51] That's right.
[1:22:56] And they are associated together.
[1:23:00] little room here, this room, this
[1:23:02] bathroom, bedroom here together, that
[1:23:05] body. Amen. That when man and God can
[1:23:09] talk to each other and sons and
[1:23:12] daughters of God, mortal men through the
[1:23:15] shedding of the blood through remission
[1:23:17] of sin and this man and this woman, boy
[1:23:20] and girl that has fellowship with
[1:23:22] Christ, that's his body. Thank you,
[1:23:25] Lord. Is communing with him. The body is
[1:23:29] a husband and wife would sit to would
[1:23:32] sit down and talk it over or a boy and
[1:23:34] his girlfriend Christ and his church is
[1:23:37] communing together. That's the reason we
[1:23:40] can hear from him.
[1:23:42] That body can hear from him.
[1:23:48] And see the future.
[1:23:52] Amen. That body sees the future. Yes,
[1:23:55] sir. How many How many have seen Los
[1:23:58] Angeles sinking?
[1:24:02] That's the future. You and I, we've seen
[1:24:05] it. Why? Because we're in that body.
[1:24:08] Else there, they have no idea what's
[1:24:10] going to be happening. But you have the
[1:24:12] material, you have the information. You
[1:24:13] got it. It's not information, the
[1:24:16] revelation that it's going to sink. We
[1:24:18] know the future because we are in his
[1:24:21] body. Amen. In his body, things are
[1:24:25] circulating there. Yeah. Revelation,
[1:24:27] information circulating that we know it.
[1:24:30] Amen. We see the future before he gets
[1:24:33] here and can tell the future that it's
[1:24:36] perfect. That's right. How many knows
[1:24:39] that your future is perfect?
[1:24:42] Amen. Amen. Yeah. You might not look
[1:24:44] like it right now, but I can tell you
[1:24:47] your future is perfect because you are
[1:24:51] in that body. Everything that's promised
[1:24:54] to that body is perfect. Yes, sir.
[1:25:01] 24 verse.
[1:25:03] And a certain of them which were with us
[1:25:06] went to the selicer and found it even so
[1:25:10] as the woman has said. Meaning we we
[1:25:13] heard that he's alive but we could not
[1:25:15] find his body. That's what he's uh
[1:25:17] referring there to
[1:25:19] there. 25 Then he said unto them, oh
[1:25:23] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:25:26] that the prophets have
[1:25:28] spoken in Christ is the mystery of God.
[1:25:32] The prophet of God said, "And he stepped
[1:25:34] out from the roadside roadside and begin
[1:25:38] to talk to them about Christ." He didn't
[1:25:40] talk to them about Jesus.
[1:25:43] After the resurrection, Jesus never
[1:25:46] referred to Jesus. Yes, sir. Amen. After
[1:25:50] the resurrection, Jesus referred them to
[1:25:53] Christ because the mission of Jesus came
[1:25:57] to an end. Christ was the one who was
[1:26:01] from the beginning and who is the one
[1:26:03] who goes to the to not even the end
[1:26:05] who's going to be staying on. Christ was
[1:26:07] on earth. He never mentioned the word
[1:26:10] Jesus again. Yes, sir. After the
[1:26:12] resurrection, he pointed them back to
[1:26:15] Christ.
[1:26:18] The Christ who was now to indwell within
[1:26:20] them. Amen.
[1:26:23] He said, "Oh fools and slow to
[1:26:26] understand." Don't you know that all the
[1:26:28] prophets and psalms, see what was he
[1:26:30] doing? What was Jesus doing? The prophet
[1:26:32] of God says he was
[1:26:35] identifying himself to these apostles.
[1:26:40] They were identifi trying to identifying
[1:26:42] him to that body if they would have
[1:26:44] found it. But he's giving them his own
[1:26:49] identification of who he was. Amen.
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] That all the prophets, all the psalms
[1:26:55] and everything was him expressed.
[1:27:01] Amen.
[1:27:03] In the same message, the prophet of God
[1:27:05] said that they they they were slow fools
[1:27:09] and slow of heart to
[1:27:10] understand the vindication of the
[1:27:14] scripture of the hour. Yes, sir. They
[1:27:17] could not see the scripture that was
[1:27:20] vindicated in that hour. Amen. They were
[1:27:23] still looking trying to find the relics.
[1:27:26] Yes. Trying to find the body. They had
[1:27:29] brought spices. Yeah. They want to get
[1:27:31] an idol set up there. Though they loved
[1:27:35] him. Yeah. Don't get me wrong. They
[1:27:37] loved him. Yes, sir. But because they
[1:27:40] loved him and they were of his, he was
[1:27:44] in the obligation
[1:27:46] of putting his mind into them. Amen.
[1:27:50] That's why the upper room was made up,
[1:27:52] prepared to come and meet them. Yeah.
[1:27:55] That this time they won't be able to
[1:27:58] understand what I would tell them. Let
[1:28:00] me go inside of them. And once I get
[1:28:02] inside of them, the questions will be
[1:28:06] resolved. Amen.
[1:28:10] And Jesus said
[1:28:13] 26, Ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:28:16] these things and to enter into his
[1:28:19] glory?
[1:28:20] And beginning at
[1:28:22] Moses and all the prophets, he expounded
[1:28:26] unto them in all the scripture the
[1:28:29] things concerning himself.
[1:28:34] And the prophet of God says in in the
[1:28:36] message of the
[1:28:38] revelation chapter 4, he said, "See,
[1:28:42] John had left the earth." He's comparing
[1:28:44] the John when John was caught up in the
[1:28:46] the fourth chapter of Revelation.
[1:28:49] Christ has left the earth in the form of
[1:28:52] the Holy Spirit and had returned
[1:28:55] back to the body
[1:28:59] again. Which body did he return to?
[1:29:04] That was Christ, not the body of Jesus
[1:29:06] there. Amen. Amen. He said Christ had
[1:29:10] left the
[1:29:11] earth when after his resurrection he
[1:29:14] went up to the father. Yeah.
[1:29:16] and had returned back to the body again.
[1:29:21] That's right. Today, the body sits there
[1:29:25] as a memorial,
[1:29:27] as a sacrifice,
[1:29:29] but the very life of that life is on
[1:29:32] earth. Christ is not up there, the body
[1:29:37] of Jesus is up there as a memorial.
[1:29:40] Christ is not there in that body.
[1:29:44] That's right. Amen. Christ is here.
[1:29:47] Christ is on earth and he's hunting for
[1:29:50] you every single day to make you that
[1:29:54] body. Amen. A part of that body. Yeah.
[1:29:57] Yeah.
[1:29:59] Thank you, Lord. That's the reason Paul
[1:30:01] could could say in Acts 17, you don't
[1:30:03] have to turn opening and alleging verse
[1:30:06] three that Christ must needs have
[1:30:09] suffered and rise again from the dead.
[1:30:12] And that that this Jesus whom I preach
[1:30:15] unto you is Christ. Amen.
[1:30:20] Today you and I, we have to go past
[1:30:23] certain veils. That's right. Amen. The
[1:30:26] apostles had to go past the
[1:30:30] veils of the prophet of Nazareth of
[1:30:34] Galilee, the mighty man who would
[1:30:37] deliver them. They had to go past the
[1:30:40] veil.
[1:30:41] Today we have to pass the veil that God
[1:30:44] has sent us a prophet. The message with
[1:30:47] all the beauty, the wonders, it's good,
[1:30:50] but we need to pass that veil. That's
[1:30:52] the the the reason the prophet of God
[1:30:54] says we can go to church. It's good to
[1:30:56] come to church. Go to church. But leave
[1:30:59] church, go into Christ. Amen. Enter into
[1:31:03] that body because he has a body here.
[1:31:06] We need to pass the veil and then to be
[1:31:10] married
[1:31:12] to Christ himself which is this word
[1:31:14] today. And once we get inside there, we
[1:31:18] will see his glory manifested. Amen.
[1:31:21] Remember that in the book of Leviticus,
[1:31:23] you don't have to turn back and read it.
[1:31:25] This is when the children of Israel are
[1:31:28] getting they aka have come out of uh
[1:31:31] Egypt. God had brought them out with his
[1:31:34] mighty hand, but he's setting up there
[1:31:36] the principle of what he wanted to do
[1:31:39] with mankind.
[1:31:41] Leviticus 26, I can read it quick.
[1:31:44] Three, he said, "If you walk in my
[1:31:46] statutes and keep my commandments and do
[1:31:49] them, then I will give you rain in due
[1:31:52] season, and the land shall yield her
[1:31:55] increase, and the the trees of the field
[1:31:58] shall yield their fruit." And 11 11 he
[1:32:01] said, "And I set my tabernacle among
[1:32:04] men." Praise God. My tabernacle is not
[1:32:07] up there. Amen.
[1:32:10] My tabernacle is among men. Amen. And my
[1:32:13] soul shall not abboard you and I will
[1:32:17] walk among you and will be your God and
[1:32:20] ye shall be my people. That's the
[1:32:22] principle he wants to show them. And
[1:32:24] Paul picks that up in 2
[1:32:27] Corinthians 6. He said, "In what
[1:32:29] agreement has the temple of God with
[1:32:32] idols?" That's right. Amen. Now, who
[1:32:35] would have been an idol at the morning
[1:32:38] of the resurrection? Right. If the body
[1:32:41] of Jesus was found there, Yeah. and
[1:32:44] Cleopus was standing here. Yeah. Who
[1:32:47] would have been an idol there? Yeah.
[1:32:50] Right. Amen.
[1:32:55] The body that was laying there, though
[1:32:57] it did what God wanted to accomplish for
[1:33:00] mankind at that very morning of the
[1:33:03] resurrection, it was an idol. The body
[1:33:07] that God wants to live in, he was the
[1:33:09] one standing up here, Cleopus and his
[1:33:11] friend.
[1:33:13] And what agreement has the temple of God
[1:33:16] with idols? For ye are the temple of the
[1:33:19] living God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah.
[1:33:24] Praise the Lord. The body of Jesus
[1:33:26] Christ with all the respect and
[1:33:28] consideration, it was the temple of the
[1:33:30] living God until that Sunday morning.
[1:33:38] Until that Sunday morning,
[1:33:42] Cleoperson's friend and Mary
[1:33:44] Magdalene were to become the temple of
[1:33:47] God for eternity. Praise God.
[1:33:51] Amen. The same God, the same deity that
[1:33:54] condescended that found its abode in
[1:33:58] Jesus Christ stepped out of that body
[1:34:01] that morning.
[1:34:04] Said, "I'm leaving this as a memorial up
[1:34:07] there. You are the body. I'm going to be
[1:34:10] living it for eternity." Amen. You are
[1:34:14] that body.
[1:34:17] You are that body.
[1:34:20] For ye are the temple of the living God,
[1:34:23] as God has said, I will dwell in them.
[1:34:27] Amen.
[1:34:29] Amen.
[1:34:32] And walk in them. Yes, sir.
[1:34:37] And I will be their God, and they shall
[1:34:39] be my
[1:34:41] people. Where would the glory of God be?
[1:34:44] Amen. Because up there, the body that is
[1:34:47] there, it's now set up as a memorial.
[1:34:50] He can't go there. He cannot go there.
[1:34:55] His glory should be found in you and me.
[1:34:58] He has He ought to enter into his glory.
[1:35:02] Amen.
[1:35:04] The father did enter into his glory in
[1:35:07] the river Jordan. Amen.
[1:35:11] Thou are well pleased for me to abode
[1:35:13] abide in the father entered into his
[1:35:17] glory in the body of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:35:21] And then on the resurrection morning
[1:35:25] Easter is a change of dispensation.
[1:35:29] Amen. Amen. Right. Easter is the body of
[1:35:33] Jesus Christ making a way for you and me
[1:35:36] to step in to take for him to abide
[1:35:40] eternally. Yeah. It's a change. That's
[1:35:44] what Easter is to you. You have a part
[1:35:46] in it. And your part your part is an
[1:35:49] eternal eternal part.
[1:35:53] Jesus part of abiding the father within
[1:35:56] him was for time.
[1:36:00] for time and he will step
[1:36:04] up. Where will his glory be? Not in that
[1:36:08] body up there. You can make it an idol.
[1:36:12] Without knowing, with good intention,
[1:36:14] with love. That's right. Amen. But the
[1:36:17] revelation is that you are that body.
[1:36:20] Amen. Amen. That's right. That he said
[1:36:22] in just read it over again to 2
[1:36:25] Corinthians 6:16. And what agreement has
[1:36:28] the temple of God with
[1:36:30] idols? You can make even the prophet of
[1:36:33] God in this hour to make him an idol.
[1:36:35] Amen. Amen. Yeah. When you said he's
[1:36:39] going to come back and put set up a tent
[1:36:41] there. Yeah. You're putting up an idol
[1:36:44] there.
[1:36:49] But the temple is you.
[1:36:54] The temple is you. You can go to the
[1:36:56] father said, "God, do you want to stay
[1:36:58] up there with in the body of Jesus
[1:37:00] Christ?" He said, "Nope."
[1:37:02] That served in time. Yes. For the a
[1:37:05] specific work, my eternal dwelling
[1:37:10] place. It's inside of you. Amen.
[1:37:20] Now, how would God accomplish this
[1:37:21] desire of tabernacling in you and in me
[1:37:25] to make you and me a part of that body
[1:37:29] that was to say eternal that had an
[1:37:32] eternal purpose.
[1:37:34] They were looking for his body. We
[1:37:36] couldn't find his body.
[1:37:38] I thank God in the first century in 2025
[1:37:42] I can see your body here. It's been
[1:37:45] found. This is the time to tell Cleophus
[1:37:48] that that body we found it. It's here
[1:37:52] in simplicity.
[1:37:55] Simplicity.
[1:37:58] How would God accomplish this desire as
[1:38:00] I said of tabernacling and dwelling in
[1:38:02] man? by releasing his
[1:38:06] spirit on that day of the
[1:38:09] resurrection. All the deity is I as I
[1:38:12] told you before that Adam only released
[1:38:16] after his resurrection be when he was
[1:38:19] dead was put to death there was only one
[1:38:22] a part of the spirit was released. Amen.
[1:38:26] Right. The the feminist spirit. Yeah.
[1:38:29] And he still stayed with the other
[1:38:30] spirit. Yeah. Could you imagine if if
[1:38:34] his bride had both masculine and
[1:38:37] feminine spirit would would she have
[1:38:38] fallen? No. That's the reason you and I
[1:38:43] this bride will not fall. Because she
[1:38:46] does not have a part of the spirit of
[1:38:49] her husband. She got the completeness of
[1:38:51] the spirit of her husband.
[1:38:55] That's the reason she will not fall.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:39:03] the Roman Romans 8
[1:39:10] 11 but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:39:13] up Jesus uh just one one scripture
[1:39:17] there Romans 8:11 if you want to look at
[1:39:21] it but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:39:24] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:39:29] He that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:39:31] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:39:35] his spirit that dwelleth in you. The
[1:39:37] prophet of God says somewhere that
[1:39:40] if that
[1:39:42] spirit did not come to resurrect Jesus,
[1:39:47] Jesus would not have resurrected.
[1:39:51] But because there were such harmony,
[1:39:54] Amen. between the son and the father.
[1:39:57] The son was relying on that spirit
[1:40:00] completely to raise him up from the
[1:40:02] dead. Amen. Had no doubt.
[1:40:06] And that spirit was obligated to
[1:40:08] resurrect him. He could not have
[1:40:10] resurrected him too. But he had an
[1:40:13] obligation because unity he had already
[1:40:16] found a tabernacle. Yeah. a dwelling
[1:40:20] place he was well pleased to dwell in
[1:40:23] cuz Jesus submitted everything he was to
[1:40:27] God. He could do nothing but what the
[1:40:29] father showed him. Amen. And you might
[1:40:31] say we might say he say but the father
[1:40:33] is not showing us. Every Wednesday he
[1:40:37] shows us things here. Every Sunday he
[1:40:41] shows us. Whenever you're reading,
[1:40:44] listening, he shows you. We have the
[1:40:46] same vision that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:49] had. When it's needed, he's going to use
[1:40:52] it for certain things. Amen.
[1:40:58] And the prophet of God says in the
[1:41:00] message, it is the rising of the sun. If
[1:41:03] the same spirit referring to Romans
[1:41:07] 8:11, if the same spirit that raised up
[1:41:11] that raised him up that quickened the
[1:41:14] true believer to eternal life. Now
[1:41:17] remember
[1:41:18] potentially in Romans 8
[1:41:23] 11 he starts he said but if and the
[1:41:27] prophet of God says there is a problem
[1:41:30] there is a catch. Yeah. Amen.
[1:41:36] But if the spirit of him, Amen. God, the
[1:41:40] Holy Spirit, that's the prophet of God
[1:41:41] still saying, that raised up Jesus from
[1:41:44] the dead dwell in you. Now there you
[1:41:48] are. If the bride's bridegroom's spirit
[1:41:52] dwells in the bride, Amen. Amen. The
[1:41:56] bride at the beginning did not have the
[1:41:59] entirety of the spirit of her her
[1:42:02] bridegroom. Amen.
[1:42:05] She did not have the entirety of that
[1:42:07] spirit. The masculine stayed inside.
[1:42:09] Yeah. Inside
[1:42:12] Adam. That's how she could fall. Yeah.
[1:42:16] But this one,
[1:42:18] this one, this bride will get the
[1:42:21] fullness of the spirit of her
[1:42:25] bridegroom.
[1:42:27] Because the body after the resurrection
[1:42:31] had no spirit. It's up there.
[1:42:41] That's the reason the prophet of God
[1:42:43] could says that could say that in crisis
[1:42:45] is the mystery said look Christ in
[1:42:49] you makes him the center of life. That's
[1:42:53] right. Of the revelation. Amen. These
[1:42:56] things probably we have them as a
[1:42:59] rehearse them. But until the mind that
[1:43:02] was in Christ takes these words,
[1:43:05] something opens up inside of you.
[1:43:09] He said, "See, Christ, Christ life in
[1:43:14] you."
[1:43:16] Amen. Makes him the center of the
[1:43:20] revelation. That's right. Christ life
[1:43:22] where in Jesus. No.
[1:43:27] No. Amen. Christ life in you. Jesus had
[1:43:33] released that deity that was in him. He
[1:43:36] said, "Now it's upon your lap." Yeah.
[1:43:39] Amen. It's upon your lap. Amen.
[1:43:44] Deity is here. Amen. Amen. Christ's life
[1:43:47] in you makes him the center of the
[1:43:50] revelation.
[1:43:52] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:43:54] complete revelation of Christ. Just it's
[1:43:57] Christ. Christ. That's the reason Jesus
[1:44:00] after the resurrection, he didn't point
[1:44:02] himself Christ. Look at Christ. Don't
[1:44:04] waste your time here. Look at Christ.
[1:44:09] Christ in
[1:44:11] you makes you
[1:44:15] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:44:18] thing.
[1:44:22] I I don't know how to get it. God help
[1:44:24] us. It's not Christ in Jesus. Yeah, that
[1:44:28] makes him the complete revelation of the
[1:44:30] whole thing.
[1:44:33] That's our Lord who redeemed us. Amen.
[1:44:37] But listen to the revelation has come to
[1:44:39] take the scales off of our eyes. Amen.
[1:44:42] It's Christ in you. Yes. In you, in
[1:44:48] Cleopus, in Mary Magdalene,
[1:44:51] in all those Christ in you and me makes
[1:44:55] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:44:59] thing. See what God is trying to do.
[1:45:06] Amen. He
[1:45:08] goes, he said when God made his
[1:45:13] bridegroom, he made the bridegroom
[1:45:17] first. And he was both men and woman in
[1:45:25] spirit. Both men and woman in spirit.
[1:45:30] Yeah. The first bridegroom, Adam, the
[1:45:32] first Adam
[1:45:34] formed formed him in the dust of the
[1:45:36] earth to make him material, tangible.
[1:45:41] And notice when he made Eve from Adam,
[1:45:44] he took not another piece of clay. He
[1:45:46] took from the same piece of clay, the
[1:45:48] same word. For Adam was a spoken word.
[1:45:52] See, he took from him. And then he made
[1:45:56] he had masculine and feminine spirit.
[1:46:01] The first
[1:46:03] Adam sir
[1:46:06] and he took the feminine spirit away
[1:46:11] from Adam.
[1:46:13] What remained in Adam? The masculine
[1:46:16] spirit.
[1:46:18] That's the spirit that if the that same
[1:46:22] spirit that was in Adam was in his
[1:46:25] bride, she would not have fallen. Amen.
[1:46:33] And he took the feminine spirit away
[1:46:35] from Adam and placed it in
[1:46:39] Eve. So it's still part of Adam's
[1:46:43] spirit. Amen. She had a part of Adam's
[1:46:48] spirit.
[1:46:50] With a part she could fall.
[1:46:56] The second Adam has to release the
[1:47:00] complete spirit. Amen. For you and I to
[1:47:04] not fall. Right.
[1:47:08] We getting it. Amen.
[1:47:11] Amen.
[1:47:14] Then it was Adam's
[1:47:17] spirit. The prophet of God calls it the
[1:47:21] dynamic.
[1:47:23] Amen. Eve had the mechanic. Yeah. Right.
[1:47:27] The dynamic remained in Adam. Amen.
[1:47:30] That's right.
[1:47:34] That's why Romans
[1:47:37] 8:11 has a new meaning for a believer.
[1:47:40] Amen.
[1:47:41] Because this is the complete deity, the
[1:47:46] complete spirit of God, not a part.
[1:47:54] The fullness. Amen. It's only the
[1:47:57] fullness that can entitle you a victory
[1:48:01] over sin. Amen. That can change your
[1:48:06] molecule into a new body. Amen.
[1:48:10] Amen.
[1:48:12] He said then it was Adam's
[1:48:15] spirit, the
[1:48:17] dynamic that quickened the mechanics of
[1:48:21] the this of his body.
[1:48:25] The
[1:48:27] mechanics of the body. The body was Eve
[1:48:32] after but his bride. So the thing that
[1:48:36] could
[1:48:38] quicken Eve, that could quicken that
[1:48:41] body, that could quicken that mechanic,
[1:48:44] it was in Adam. Amen.
[1:48:49] That's why on
[1:48:51] Calvary, G Jesus body is completely
[1:48:56] lifeless. Yeah. When he went up because
[1:48:59] the spirit stayed here. Both the
[1:49:02] dynamics and the mechanic.
[1:49:05] Both. Yes. Lord. Praise the Lord. That
[1:49:09] body is a memorial. What is a memorial?
[1:49:12] What is a memorial?
[1:49:17] The body that they were looking for. I'm
[1:49:20] have a privilege of seeing a group of
[1:49:24] people here
[1:49:26] being a part of that body.
[1:49:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:33] So before the
[1:49:35] resurrection, we were in Christ as the
[1:49:38] prophet of God said. That's right. But
[1:49:40] after the
[1:49:42] resurrection, Christ must be in us.
[1:49:45] Amen. Right.
[1:49:48] Amen. Amen. Before the resurrection, we
[1:49:52] were there. And the prophet of God said
[1:49:56] he atoned for our sin. We were still
[1:49:58] inside. Yeah. Yes, sir. when he was
[1:50:01] pierced on his side. We came out. So
[1:50:04] before the resurrection, we were in him
[1:50:06] in Christ. Amen. After the
[1:50:09] resurrection, Christ
[1:50:12] ought to be in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:21] The only hope for him to enter in his
[1:50:24] purposed
[1:50:26] glory is to enter in tabernacle in you
[1:50:31] and me.
[1:50:34] He ought to enter into his glory. Yeah.
[1:50:38] His glory is not up there. Amen. His
[1:50:41] glory
[1:50:43] is somewhere there inside of you. That's
[1:50:44] where he finds his glory. We will read
[1:50:46] it. Amen. In the book of
[1:50:50] Colossians. I'm winding down. Sorry. You
[1:50:54] can hold on little dinner there. I don't
[1:50:55] see you every day.
[1:50:57] Could you please feel for
[1:50:59] [Laughter]
[1:51:02] me? Colossians one. Colossians 1.
[1:51:16] 26 says we start at
[1:51:19] 26 even the mystery this is a Paul he's
[1:51:23] trying he had the mind of God was
[1:51:26] already in Paul and he's trying to
[1:51:29] convey things that are coming freshly
[1:51:32] divinely there to laid out for the
[1:51:35] church said even the mystery which has
[1:51:38] been hid from ages and from
[1:51:41] generations, but now is made
[1:51:44] manifest to his saints, to whom God
[1:51:48] would make known what is the riches of
[1:51:51] the of the glory of his mystery among
[1:51:54] the Gentiles, which is Christ in you.
[1:51:58] Amen.
[1:52:00] The hope of glory. Amen. whom we preach
[1:52:04] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:52:07] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:52:11] beloved. This is Paul saying that with
[1:52:14] this revelation Christ wants to present
[1:52:17] he wants to present every man perfect in
[1:52:21] Christ Jesus. Meaning every member of
[1:52:24] that bride will have deity living in
[1:52:28] them. Amen. Nobody will come short.
[1:52:31] Right. Amen. Every member perfect. Yeah.
[1:52:36] Christ in
[1:52:38] you, that's the only hope that he can
[1:52:42] enter into his glory. Yeah.
[1:52:45] Amen. Amen. Christ in you is the only
[1:52:50] hope for him to find his glory. Amen.
[1:52:53] Yeah.
[1:52:55] What house have you has have you
[1:52:57] prepared me? Can go up in Hebrews 10. We
[1:53:00] don't have time to go there. Amen.
[1:53:05] In the mighty God
[1:53:07] unveiled before us preached 1964 winding
[1:53:11] down. Please feel for me. Sorry for me.
[1:53:16] Now back in the days of old testament
[1:53:20] the prophet of God says we find that
[1:53:22] after he appeared to his people in
[1:53:25] different
[1:53:26] forms he veiled himself behind older
[1:53:30] badger skins. That's right.
[1:53:34] God hide hiding
[1:53:37] behind badger skins at his mercy seat.
[1:53:42] And the prophet of God says that what he
[1:53:45] was hiding be hiding behind the badger
[1:53:49] skins was his glory. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:54] That nobody could approach. Yeah. Right.
[1:53:59] We find that how that Solomon Solomon
[1:54:04] when he dedicated the temple of the Lord
[1:54:06] and the badger skins were hanging there
[1:54:09] the veil how that he came in as a pillar
[1:54:12] of fire God as a cloud and went down
[1:54:16] behind there behind the badger skins and
[1:54:20] veiled himself to the outside
[1:54:23] world but by faith not the reality Mhm.
[1:54:28] But by
[1:54:29] faith, Israel knew that he was back
[1:54:32] there, though they never seen him. They
[1:54:35] only had one candidate that would go
[1:54:38] there once a year. Amen. That's Aaron,
[1:54:40] the high priest.
[1:54:42] So once a year with all the preparation
[1:54:45] that was made for that day, and they had
[1:54:49] to make sure that he had a string on his
[1:54:51] leg. Yeah.
[1:54:52] He if he forced death there nobody could
[1:54:55] enter in because going in was death.
[1:54:57] Yeah. Aaron was allowed once a year in
[1:55:02] this after dedicated his entire body. He
[1:55:05] was going through a lot of processes
[1:55:07] through the year to be able to meet the
[1:55:10] requirement requirements of what that
[1:55:13] day. Yeah. Amen. Amen. I'm going to tell
[1:55:16] you, Aaron was going through a lot.
[1:55:20] Just to be able to
[1:55:23] experience one day of the life of a son
[1:55:27] of God. Yeah. Right. Amen. Of your life.
[1:55:31] Yeah. Today, if you have the Holy
[1:55:33] Spirit, you have that every single
[1:55:36] minute, second, you are behind the veil.
[1:55:40] But Aaron in the Old Testament, this
[1:55:43] high priest had to go through a process
[1:55:47] through the entire year, his clothing,
[1:55:51] everything around him to be able to meet
[1:55:54] the requirements of entering
[1:55:58] experiencing Yeah. what a son of God and
[1:56:01] a daughter of God experience when they
[1:56:02] have the Holy Spirit. Yeah. Amen. Yeah.
[1:56:06] It's glorious the message you have
[1:56:08] received. There's no message that ever
[1:56:10] struck the earth like this one.
[1:56:14] The prophet of God says that this mighty
[1:56:17] angel of Malachi 4, since God sent
[1:56:20] prophets on earth, since Enoch, there
[1:56:23] has never been one like this. Amen.
[1:56:26] Amen.
[1:56:28] Amen. The only difference is not body
[1:56:30] that paid on Calvary, but deity was
[1:56:33] tabernacling in this man. Amen. Amen.
[1:56:37] Amen. And God took him out. He doesn't
[1:56:40] He doesn't like idols. Yeah, that's
[1:56:42] right. To have the same deity now on
[1:56:46] your lap. Praise God. He
[1:56:49] said, "By faith, Israel knew that he was
[1:56:52] back there. They knew he was there
[1:56:55] regardless of what any of the heathen
[1:56:58] world had to say. He was hid from the
[1:57:01] unbelievers.
[1:57:03] But the believer by faith knew he was
[1:57:07] back there. They had mercy and he was at
[1:57:11] his mercy seat which was a great secret.
[1:57:17] It was a great secret. His presence back
[1:57:20] there is a great secret. Amen. His
[1:57:24] tabernacling in you, it's a great secret
[1:57:28] to those around you. That's right. Amen.
[1:57:31] Lord, you know in the old testament to
[1:57:34] enter behind that
[1:57:36] skin was death.
[1:57:39] Now to stay from behind it is death.
[1:57:44] Amen. Meaning you have been welcomed.
[1:57:47] Yeah.
[1:57:49] To the glory of God. You have been
[1:57:52] welcomed to say God come on in. Amen.
[1:57:57] Then to enter into his glory was death.
[1:58:01] His glory was hid there in secret to
[1:58:04] unbelievers. But the believers by faith
[1:58:07] they knew he was there.
[1:58:13] Now to stay away from his glory is
[1:58:16] death.
[1:58:19] To stay away from his glory is death.
[1:58:22] Meaning a true believer in this hour has
[1:58:26] to be in his glory. Amen.
[1:58:29] True. That happened of course at the
[1:58:33] renting of the veil at Calvary when the
[1:58:35] veil was rent the old veil. Now to stay
[1:58:38] out of his presence is
[1:58:40] death. Then to enter in in his presence
[1:58:44] was
[1:58:45] death. For the time sake we have to wind
[1:58:48] down. And the prophet of God says in the
[1:58:51] message
[1:58:52] dedication as uh heaven is my throne and
[1:58:56] earth is my foottool. Where is the house
[1:58:59] that could build that that you could
[1:59:01] build
[1:59:02] me? How could you build me a house to
[1:59:05] dwell
[1:59:07] in then? How beautiful Hebrew 10:5 but a
[1:59:11] body has thou prepared me? That was the
[1:59:13] body of Jesus Christ first. Amen.
[1:59:17] showing that God was going to dwell in a
[1:59:20] body. Amen. Oh, and when this body had
[1:59:23] been made a sacrifice, the correct lamb
[1:59:26] had been sacrificed, Jesus Christ served
[1:59:30] the work of the sacrifice. He fulfilled
[1:59:33] it and the body was taken up as a
[1:59:35] memorial. He said, uh, and when this
[1:59:37] body has been made a sacrifice, the
[1:59:40] correct lamb had been sacrificed. There
[1:59:42] was coming forth then
[1:59:47] Hallelujah.
[1:59:48] There was coming forth.
[1:59:50] Then God came in his own body which was
[1:59:55] his bride. Amen. That's his own body.
[1:59:59] Jesus Christ was temporarily.
[2:00:03] Yeah. God's body. Amen. And served the
[2:00:08] best purpose. But the eternal body where
[2:00:12] God is going to be dwelling in for
[2:00:16] eternity, it's you.
[2:00:19] And there had been 120 temples that God
[2:00:22] had created was ready for dedication
[2:00:24] that morning. They had got they had got
[2:00:27] all their unbelief beat out of them.
[2:00:29] Amen. They gathered in the upper room
[2:00:31] and waited for 10 days for dedication or
[2:00:35] service.
[2:00:37] Why? because Christ was to enter his
[2:00:41] glory. Amen.
[2:00:44] They uh waited for 10 days for
[2:00:46] dedication service. Then when completely
[2:00:51] surrendered, God came down again in the
[2:00:54] shikina glory. Amen. We think that the
[2:00:57] shikina glory is submission up there.
[2:01:00] We're envisioning it. That shina glory
[2:01:03] is wanting you a veil. Yeah. He wants to
[2:01:07] be hid beyond your veil
[2:01:11] so that only the believer can see him in
[2:01:13] you. The unbelievers would not even
[2:01:15] understand it, but you hid there. And he
[2:01:18] said God came in his resting place where
[2:01:22] he finds his rest into the heart of man.
[2:01:27] His resting place is not he could create
[2:01:30] anything but he doesn't need all of
[2:01:32] that. He had only one purpose, resting
[2:01:36] place, one place that he can hide his
[2:01:39] glory. All the glory of God, the prophet
[2:01:43] of God says that is in his word.
[2:01:46] And he wants to find to hide the glory
[2:01:48] of his deity of his word behind your
[2:01:52] skin. Amen.
[2:01:54] Not in a building, but in the heart of
[2:01:58] his people, he finds rest. He said until
[2:02:02] and until you come in behind that badge
[2:02:05] of skin, until you get out of your old
[2:02:08] skin, your old thoughts, your old creeds
[2:02:11] and come into the presence of God, then
[2:02:14] the word becomes a living reality to
[2:02:18] you.
[2:02:20] When does the word become the living
[2:02:24] reality? When God finds enters into his
[2:02:28] glory in your heart.
[2:02:30] It becomes a living reality. Then you
[2:02:33] are
[2:02:35] awakened to the shakina glory.
[2:02:39] We are awakened
[2:02:41] to the shikina glory. When that shikina
[2:02:44] is within you. Amen. It it it brings you
[2:02:47] things to memory. Yes sir. It tells you
[2:02:49] that my glory. That's the reason
[2:02:52] probably sometimes men are not a good
[2:02:55] model, good example, good reference.
[2:02:57] Sisters are a good reference.
[2:03:00] The way you dress
[2:03:01] up with the revelation
[2:03:04] it's the
[2:03:06] best defeat to Satan's age.
[2:03:10] Satan's age, his desire is to undress
[2:03:13] people. Yeah. But when somebody who has
[2:03:16] a revelation that I should wear this way
[2:03:20] to cover my entire body,
[2:03:23] it's the greatest. Satan cannot stand
[2:03:26] it. Amen.
[2:03:29] We used probably years back used to be
[2:03:31] kids before I even believed the
[2:03:35] message. You know, sometimes you go poke
[2:03:37] and play with the girls and and and and
[2:03:39] kids and boys. Something was
[2:03:42] supernatural when a girl was dressed up
[2:03:46] in had a dress long dress well covered
[2:03:50] up. There was fear inside of me back
[2:03:53] then. I couldn't approach her. I I I
[2:03:57] couldn't play with her
[2:04:01] because she was carrying a divine
[2:04:05] picture image of God.
[2:04:11] But you must come
[2:04:13] behind. We must come in behind the veil
[2:04:17] to see the unveiled God. We we we're
[2:04:21] closing now in the book of John chapter
[2:04:25] 17. Let me read it for you. Jesus say is
[2:04:28] saying in 9 and 10 he said I pray for
[2:04:31] them. Jesus is praying you talking about
[2:04:34] a segressionist.
[2:04:36] He can segregate. He said I pray for for
[2:04:38] for them. I pray not for the world.
[2:04:42] Clear cut. Yeah. Oh no. Let's let's make
[2:04:44] sure that you you don't touch on the
[2:04:47] feelings. You might hurt the
[2:04:49] feelings. This is this is the word
[2:04:51] saying it. I pray for them and I pray
[2:04:54] not for the world but for them which
[2:04:57] thou has given me for they are thine and
[2:05:01] all mine are thine and thine are mine
[2:05:07] and where is he glorified not in heaven
[2:05:10] I am glorified in them
[2:05:14] that's where the glory of God has to
[2:05:17] abide the glory he ha he ought to enter
[2:05:22] into his glory where in you and in me.
[2:05:26] Amen.
[2:05:28] Thessalonians one more. Amen. Two
[2:05:32] Thessalonian one. He said I'm going to
[2:05:34] read it 10. When he shall come to be
[2:05:38] glorified in his saints. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:05:42] He's not be glorifying. We have the
[2:05:45] Catholic mentality of God having a
[2:05:47] little place there. He's walking in that
[2:05:49] mansion. That's that's beautiful for for
[2:05:52] little kids. But for grown-ups with the
[2:05:55] revelation of the grown-ups, no, it's
[2:05:58] not. So when he shall come to be
[2:06:00] glorified in his saints, Amen. and to be
[2:06:04] admired in all that in all them that
[2:06:07] believe. Could you imagine that? There's
[2:06:10] no place people can come and admire God
[2:06:12] in a building. Yeah. He is admired in
[2:06:16] them. Yeah. You want to admire the glory
[2:06:19] of God, just approach one sister. Amen.
[2:06:22] Filled with the Holy Ghost. You can
[2:06:24] admire the glory of God inside there.
[2:06:26] Approach a brother filled with the Holy
[2:06:28] Ghost. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:32] 12 said that the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:06:34] Christ may be glorified in you.
[2:06:41] Now listen, let me read this again. an
[2:06:43] unveiled uh unveiling of God. Prophet of
[2:06:47] God says all the glory that is in God is
[2:06:50] in his word. Can you imagine his word
[2:06:55] because when his word is in in man in a
[2:06:58] woman, it becomes a living reality of
[2:07:01] God himself. Amen. All the glory that is
[2:07:04] in God is in his word. All the blessings
[2:07:08] that that's God that's in God is in his
[2:07:11] word. It's hid to unbelievers by
[2:07:14] traditions. See what I mean? But it's
[2:07:17] all in Christ. All that God was, he
[2:07:20] emptied
[2:07:21] himself, winding
[2:07:24] down, and came into Christ.
[2:07:29] And we,
[2:07:32] Amen. into Christ or behind the veil.
[2:07:37] Amen.
[2:07:39] So we are invited to him.
[2:07:42] to be partakers of all he is. The
[2:07:44] prophet of God still continuing. We are
[2:07:47] invited into him which is to unbelievers
[2:07:51] which is hid hid to unbelievers but the
[2:07:54] but the veil of human flesh. See they
[2:07:56] know that glory they read of it. It's in
[2:08:00] the word here. The glory of God and and
[2:08:03] things like that. To us it's a
[2:08:06] manifestation. That's right. To them
[2:08:09] it's a letter. Yeah. Right? When that
[2:08:12] glory when he enters into his glory in
[2:08:15] you, it becomes a manifestation.
[2:08:19] Nobody can copy copycatist cut copy it.
[2:08:24] It's a manifestation. See, it's no more
[2:08:26] a word. It's a reality.
[2:08:30] And he says again, then we become part
[2:08:35] of him. Amen. as you are the veil that
[2:08:39] veils him. Amen.
[2:08:42] No. On the mount transfiguration,
[2:08:45] all they want to see it was just Jesus
[2:08:48] glorified. And the prophet of God says
[2:08:50] that our desire is to see him glorified.
[2:08:55] Glorified not with
[2:08:57] self-ride, but in us.
[2:09:00] In us. Not somewhere. Not in a building
[2:09:04] somewhere. Not in a mansion somewhere.
[2:09:06] glorified in us, our lives to prove he
[2:09:11] is alive and living in us this Easter.
[2:09:15] It's a reality.
[2:09:17] A daily reality for a believer. Amen. He
[2:09:20] said, "If I can get myself out of the
[2:09:24] way, Yes, sir. If we can get ourselves
[2:09:28] out of the way."
[2:09:30] So when William Brandham not even
[2:09:33] thought of, so you and me not even
[2:09:38] thought
[2:09:40] of and you not even thought of till we
[2:09:44] can see Jesus glorified among us.
[2:09:52] Let me read this is it's very good. It's
[2:09:54] very good to read it. I don't I don't
[2:09:56] see you every day. Give give me five
[2:09:58] minutes.
[2:09:59] Great.
[2:10:01] The playoff and his friend did
[2:10:05] something of uh great importance at the
[2:10:08] end. You remember they they loved him.
[2:10:12] They served him but they couldn't
[2:10:14] understand it because the Holy Spirit
[2:10:17] was not given yet. The Holy Spirit was
[2:10:19] not released yet. Yeah. Which brings all
[2:10:22] the deity, the mind of God, everything
[2:10:25] that God is, it's in his word, in the
[2:10:28] Holy Spirit. They didn't have that. But
[2:10:30] they did something that was of great
[2:10:33] importance. Yes. As they were walking,
[2:10:36] they invited him in. Amen. Y
[2:10:40] And you know what? We can have we can
[2:10:42] walk walk all day long. Let's invite him
[2:10:45] in this morning. You say, you know what?
[2:10:48] I might have had you maybe for a long
[2:10:50] time walked with you. This morning I
[2:10:52] want to come Aresh.
[2:10:55] And those that have not experienced that
[2:10:57] glory. Yes, sir. In a vessel hid behind
[2:11:00] your badge of skins,
[2:11:03] give him an opportunity.
[2:11:05] And in this message in the the evidence
[2:11:07] of the resurrection preached in 1958,
[2:11:10] the prophet of God says, "Now, here's
[2:11:12] where I want to get to. What I want you
[2:11:16] to
[2:11:17] see that that was the first message
[2:11:21] after the
[2:11:22] resurrection. And as he walked with them
[2:11:24] through that entire
[2:11:27] day, they did not know him.
[2:11:30] Yet he was with them, but he himself had
[2:11:34] their eyes closed.
[2:11:37] He had their eyes closed.
[2:11:41] But when it got towards the setting of
[2:11:44] the sum
[2:11:46] and Jesus made as if he was to pass them
[2:11:49] by. Yeah. If that isn't just exactly
[2:11:53] what he has done again these last days.
[2:11:57] Amen. At the setting of the sun. Amen.
[2:12:00] These last days let's leave clear office
[2:12:04] that morning of the resurrection. Let
[2:12:06] come in this last day. Amen. I'm going
[2:12:09] to Don't sleep on me.
[2:12:12] We're going to stand up in a few
[2:12:13] minutes.
[2:12:16] Did you notice what he gave the church
[2:12:18] then through the day
[2:12:22] through the seven ages? Right. That was
[2:12:25] the day. Amen. Did you see what he gave
[2:12:28] the church then through the day? Just
[2:12:31] preaching the word. Amen. Amen. He never
[2:12:35] performed one sign or wonder. That's
[2:12:38] right. Through the church ages. Amen.
[2:12:43] He never said anything just preach the
[2:12:46] word about the resurrection of what the
[2:12:48] prophet said.
[2:12:50] That's what he's done since the days of
[2:12:53] his going away until this last day. You
[2:12:57] can go on the record find the time that
[2:13:00] miracles has happened like in this day
[2:13:03] that had never happened through the
[2:13:05] other church ages. They had prayer
[2:13:07] meetings. They had faith. They tried.
[2:13:09] But what have happened in this setting
[2:13:12] of the sun has never happened through
[2:13:15] the churches. But now the prophet of God
[2:13:20] says, "But now, oh bless his name, the
[2:13:23] sun is setting
[2:13:25] and he made as if he would not stop. Oh,
[2:13:30] I can think of Fenny Crossby when he she
[2:13:33] cried, "Pass me not, oh gentle
[2:13:37] savior." And these disciples said,
[2:13:40] that's the most valuable thing that
[2:13:42] these disciples said. They could not
[2:13:44] understand it, could not comprehend or
[2:13:47] know, but they loved him. And something
[2:13:50] was within them that was being
[2:13:53] represented in Christ. And these
[2:13:55] disciples said, "Come and
[2:13:58] abide. If we could only be this morning,
[2:14:01] this
[2:14:02] afternoon having the same attitude,
[2:14:05] Amen. the same longing and eager that
[2:14:09] this Christ that has resurrected, if
[2:14:12] he's resurrected and standing outside of
[2:14:15] you,
[2:14:17] there's no benefit to his resurrection.
[2:14:20] It's just another story. Yes. But his
[2:14:23] resurrection is that after he had
[2:14:25] suffered,
[2:14:27] he ought to enter into his glory. In
[2:14:31] that glory, you the one that veil that
[2:14:34] will hide that glory. He's wanting this
[2:14:37] morning to come into his glory.
[2:14:42] Disciples said, "Come and abide. Stay
[2:14:45] with us through the darkness for it's
[2:14:47] getting late." and he made out like he
[2:14:50] was going on but they constrained him.
[2:14:53] In other words, they begged him
[2:14:58] in though they couldn't
[2:15:00] understand though you may not be able
[2:15:03] but please do what they did. That's the
[2:15:06] prophet of God saying it. Do what they
[2:15:08] did. They invited him come
[2:15:12] in. They said come in. The day is far
[2:15:15] spent. That's it. It's then and then
[2:15:19] only can he make himself known when you
[2:15:22] invite him to come in. Could we stand?
[2:15:26] How many are willing to invite him in?
[2:15:29] That the purpose of his resurrection of
[2:15:33] Easter could fully be revealed in you.
[2:15:40] Amen. The disciples could not understand
[2:15:42] that. All these
[2:15:44] mysteries, they could not understand it.
[2:15:47] M but they did something that was very
[2:15:50] valuable said could you come in could
[2:15:53] could you spend some time we might have
[2:15:55] been in church for a long time even in
[2:15:57] the message
[2:15:58] itself the message the message the the
[2:16:00] the the stories the realities what
[2:16:04] happened in this message is so powerful
[2:16:08] that it can it can even draw you closer
[2:16:12] but
[2:16:14] sometimes we might not have the reality
[2:16:17] Because the reality is so simple. He
[2:16:20] wants to
[2:16:21] tabernacle behind your badger
[2:16:24] behind your skin. When you let him in,
[2:16:28] when he comes behind your
[2:16:31] skin, you let him into his glory, then
[2:16:35] the purpose of his
[2:16:38] suffering and
[2:16:41] resurrection is met.
[2:16:49] Isaiah 49 said before we close
[2:16:52] this, "Listen, O isolles unto me, and
[2:16:56] hearken ye people for from far. The Lord
[2:17:00] had called me from the womb." He has
[2:17:03] done the same thing with you and me. He
[2:17:06] called you and me from the
[2:17:07] wombs of our parents, of our
[2:17:11] moms. From the bowels of my mother has
[2:17:14] he made mention of my name. He has done
[2:17:17] the same thing. Many have died, but he
[2:17:21] didn't let you sleep with others. One
[2:17:23] out of of a million. How many germs the
[2:17:26] same day, the same hour you came along
[2:17:29] with them?
[2:17:31] or the
[2:17:33] 1.999 1 point9 million died.
[2:17:37] You came because there was a
[2:17:40] supernatural a divine purpose. Amen. For
[2:17:43] you to be living in this day. Amen.
[2:17:46] Amen. He didn't allow you to be in the
[2:17:48] days when he was walking with them,
[2:17:50] preaching the word. He wanted you to be
[2:17:54] at the setting of the sun. That's right.
[2:17:56] Amen. Let this be the setting of the sun
[2:17:59] in your spiritual walk with him. Said,
[2:18:02] "God, I know
[2:18:04] that you have one
[2:18:08] motive. You want to tabernacle in me."
[2:18:11] That's the whole that's the message.
[2:18:15] And I'm I invite you in. And he said,
[2:18:19] "And he he has made my mouth like a
[2:18:21] sharp sword. In the shadow of his hand,
[2:18:24] he hid me." Has he hid me? and made me a
[2:18:27] polished
[2:18:29] shaft. In his quiver has he hid me and
[2:18:34] said unto me, "Thou are my
[2:18:37] servant, oh Israel, in whom I will be
[2:18:41] glorified." Amen. God Christ wants to be
[2:18:45] glorified in you. Christ in you. Yes,
[2:18:49] sir. That's the only hope for him to be
[2:18:53] glorified.
[2:18:55] Amen. That's the only time he can show
[2:19:00] his glory.
[2:19:02] Outside of that, there's no glory to be
[2:19:06] manifested. Let's bow our heads in
[2:19:09] prayer. Precious
[2:19:13] Lord, we're
[2:19:15] so grateful to
[2:19:19] you that you have allowed us
[2:19:26] being of
[2:19:28] times humans
[2:19:31] wise. But we learned through the
[2:19:34] revelation
[2:19:35] that there's a portion of a part of you
[2:19:39] that's eternal that you deposited within
[2:19:43] us. That makes us to
[2:19:46] be double beings. Amen.
[2:19:50] And Lord, we have now heard in this day
[2:19:53] that you have called us. We were in
[2:19:58] the chicken
[2:20:00] yard. But your scream, father, has
[2:20:03] reached that portion of you that is
[2:20:05] within
[2:20:06] us. And now what we all we long is to
[2:20:10] hear that voice. All we long is to
[2:20:14] communicate with that voice of who we
[2:20:16] are really
[2:20:20] are. Help us father this morning with
[2:20:23] this little chopped
[2:20:25] up message. But
[2:20:28] father what we wanted to convey is that
[2:20:32] your
[2:20:33] resurrection is unfinished. The purpose
[2:20:36] of you coming condescending through the
[2:20:40] years, through the
[2:20:43] generations from Genesis coming down to
[2:20:46] this
[2:20:47] age was that
[2:20:50] you could further release deity in man.
[2:20:54] Amen. That your deity could
[2:20:57] find a
[2:21:01] place in the heart of man. Amen.
[2:21:05] We are sincerely coming to you and
[2:21:08] asking you if we have missed that
[2:21:11] target. If we have walked on through the
[2:21:14] day of
[2:21:16] our
[2:21:18] experience without inviting you
[2:21:21] in, could you, Father, could you stop
[2:21:25] Dongo? Could you stop by us this
[2:21:28] morning? Could you stop by my brother
[2:21:30] and my sister regardless of the
[2:21:32] age that we would invite you in and you
[2:21:36] would do something father that we will
[2:21:39] know that this is the way you did it
[2:21:42] before your
[2:21:44] resurrection. Father, we thank you for
[2:21:46] the time you have given to
[2:21:48] us. And we thank you for the shedding of
[2:21:51] the blood on Calvary through your
[2:21:53] beloved son Jesus Christ
[2:21:55] to all take our amnesia away to take all
[2:22:00] the clatters that were in our even the
[2:22:03] scale that were in our eyes that we can
[2:22:05] see. Amen. And Lord, as you have shown
[2:22:09] yourself to us, there's no other desire
[2:22:12] but Lord to walk with you, to hold you,
[2:22:15] to house you
[2:22:17] in. Don't go. Lord, could you come
[2:22:21] in? We thank
[2:22:23] you. We commit your children in your
[2:22:26] care, Lord. is brother Chad coming back
[2:22:30] Father this week that
[2:22:32] you you would provide Father safe
[2:22:34] flights, safe travels and bring him safe
[2:22:38] back and you will bless us all Father
[2:22:41] those that were predestinated to hear
[2:22:43] you. Come and hunt us that we will never
[2:22:45] have any day of rest until your glory is
[2:22:49] has entered in us. Amen. We love you. We
[2:22:53] thank you. who commit, Father, the days
[2:22:55] ahead in your
[2:22:57] care that you will give us strength,
