[6:19] praise the lord certainly good to be
[6:21] with you this evening
[6:23] amen while we're standing let's take our
[6:24] bibles and turn into the book of psalms
[6:32] amen
[6:34] we're gonna continue on with the seventh
[6:37] seal family
[6:38] and uh this may be the last part for now
[6:41] we'll see
[6:42] we'll see how it goes we're making no
[6:43] promises that's my disclaimer no
[6:46] promises
[6:47] let's let the lord lead as the lord does
[6:49] so often
[6:50] always leads in our lives but i feel
[6:53] like this could be the last one
[6:55] i want to take a look at teens and young
[6:58] adults today
[6:59] as we're progressing through but i'll
[7:01] start to start with reading out of the
[7:02] book of psalm
[7:04] chapter 127 psalms 127.
[7:10] and we'll pick that up at verse 1. we've
[7:12] been reading from verse 3
[7:14] but tonight i'd like to pick it up from
[7:15] verse 1. psalms 127 and verse 1.
[7:20] except the lord build the house they
[7:22] labor in vain that build it
[7:24] except the lord keep the city the
[7:25] watchman waketh in vain
[7:28] this is going to be important as we talk
[7:29] about raising teens and young adults
[7:32] this is the reason why we're going to
[7:33] read this scripture first let's read it
[7:35] again
[7:35] except the lord build the house they
[7:37] labor in vain that build it
[7:38] except the lord keep the city the
[7:40] watchman wakeeth but in vain
[7:42] it is vain for you to rise up early to
[7:44] sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows
[7:46] for so he giveth his beloved sleep lo
[7:50] children are in heritage of the lord and
[7:52] the fruit of the womb is his reward
[7:54] as arrows are in the hand of the mighty
[7:56] man soar the children of the youth
[7:59] happy is the man that hath his quiver
[8:00] full of them they shall not be ashamed
[8:03] but they shall speak with the enemies
[8:05] in the gates and let's ask the lord his
[8:08] blessing over the word dear lord jesus
[8:10] we thank you god that we can be here
[8:12] tonight lord it's a privilege lord just
[8:14] to be able to gather
[8:15] together to sing your praises to worship
[8:18] your name
[8:19] to hear your word preached lord we just
[8:21] pray you would take preeminence now that
[8:23] you would speak through these lips of
[8:24] clay
[8:25] that you would hear lord through our
[8:26] ears and that you would let this word
[8:28] drop into our heart
[8:29] and manifest into a life lord let it
[8:32] translate lord from the preaching to the
[8:34] living lord
[8:35] and let it be done in us we ask for
[8:37] these things in jesus christ's name amen
[8:40] you're going to be seated you can have
[8:43] your seats
[8:44] and bring up the powerpoint i want to
[8:48] before i launch into
[8:52] everything i want to go through teens
[8:53] and adults i want to wrap up something
[8:55] from last wednesday
[8:56] we were talking about young children
[8:58] raising children and
[9:00] some things that i didn't get to and i
[9:01] just want to drop some points in there
[9:02] because there's questions that i get
[9:04] from time to time and so i'd like to
[9:06] answer that really quickly before we
[9:08] move too far
[9:09] to read this quote again that we've been
[9:11] focusing on any man in his family a
[9:13] correct good noble obedient family is
[9:16] one with another
[9:17] any family and if there's something in
[9:19] the family that moves them apart
[9:21] then it's not right boy i tell you this
[9:23] is this is
[9:25] this isn't rocket science but this is
[9:26] profound
[9:28] you know it's simple but it's powerful
[9:30] and we should be
[9:31] sometimes watching for that thing that's
[9:33] driving us apart
[9:34] you know every once in a while tension
[9:36] hits a family
[9:37] brother venom says any family i i can't
[9:40] remember the message he says in a couple
[9:42] different messages but i was just
[9:43] listening to a tape the other day and
[9:44] brother ben was saying any family
[9:46] they'll just go along and every once in
[9:47] a while they just kind of
[9:48] hit a spot where several things go wrong
[9:50] he said you're entering into a night
[9:52] cycle and he says
[9:52] that happens to all of us that happens
[9:54] to everyone and everything begins
[9:56] cruising right along and everything's
[9:57] going smooth and
[9:58] you hit a spot where there's tension
[10:00] over for whatever reason maybe multiple
[10:02] things come together at the same time
[10:04] there's tension in a family but what
[10:06] brother bam says is if there's something
[10:07] in the family that moves them apart
[10:09] then it's not right the family is broken
[10:11] somewhere
[10:12] and so this is a key for us to start to
[10:15] have spiritual discernment
[10:17] when we see something hitting and
[10:19] something trying to break the family
[10:21] that's the time to stop quit moving
[10:23] forward stop for a minute say god
[10:25] show me what is causing this tension
[10:27] what's behind this
[10:29] what's the enemy trying to do where is
[10:30] it coming from is it because
[10:32] we're too busy is it because dad's
[10:34] working too many hours and away from
[10:36] home
[10:36] is it because we've got too much on our
[10:38] plate we've taken on too many activities
[10:40] what's going on why is there something
[10:43] coming and creating this tension and
[10:44] driving us apart
[10:46] amen because if there's something that
[10:48] moves them apart then it's not right
[10:51] even if the activity itself is not
[10:54] wicked or evil
[10:55] but the fact that it's driving the
[10:57] family apart makes it not right
[11:00] because it's it's always easy to get
[11:02] busier has anybody noticed that
[11:05] oh it's easy to get busy getting busy is
[11:07] not hard getting busy is easy
[11:09] especially if you have a family it seems
[11:11] like it's non-stop you can get busy
[11:13] and if you want to be busier you can get
[11:14] busier but
[11:16] but sometimes that's detrimental to the
[11:18] health of the family
[11:19] because everybody's going in opposite
[11:20] directions and we don't have that time
[11:22] that we need
[11:24] so if anything moves them apart then
[11:26] it's not right the family's broken
[11:28] somewhere
[11:29] so we have to be diligent and watchful
[11:31] especially as fathers and as mothers
[11:33] we need to work together and be watchful
[11:35] and be prayerful when we see something
[11:37] begin to move in
[11:38] and move the family apart we need to
[11:40] that's the time to go to
[11:42] prayer and say go on i need an answer i
[11:44] need you to show me what it is
[11:45] and you got to be careful when you can't
[11:47] pray that kind of prayer
[11:49] because when you pray that kind of
[11:51] prayer and all you see is your faith
[11:53] looking back then you know where the
[11:54] problem is
[11:56] i've prayed prayers like that and i've
[11:57] seen myself
[11:59] but if we're going to pray that prayer
[12:01] honestly then we've got to be honest all
[12:02] the way through with whatever god shows
[12:04] us we got to deal with it
[12:06] sometimes it's us sometimes it's
[12:07] something we allow sometimes to somebody
[12:09] else
[12:09] sometimes there's other extended family
[12:11] putting pressure on the family
[12:13] it could be any myriad of reasons but
[12:15] we've got to be watchful we've got to be
[12:16] discerning
[12:17] because our family life matters i say it
[12:21] matters you know brother brenham told us
[12:23] the order of things god first family
[12:25] second others third and ourselves last
[12:28] so family life matters
[12:32] it goes on to say they should all be one
[12:34] father with mother
[12:35] mother with father children with parent
[12:37] parent with children
[12:39] all in agreement and when you see that
[12:41] you'll see one
[12:42] lovely picture praise god because that's
[12:46] the masterpiece picture
[12:48] and this applies to teenagers
[12:51] brother branham wasn't excluding them
[12:53] when he made this statement all
[12:54] one mother with father father mother
[12:57] parent with child
[12:58] child with parent all the way through
[13:01] this it's a false notion
[13:05] it's a layout to see an idea
[13:08] that you have to accept teenage
[13:11] rebellion
[13:14] amen that that is not in the scriptures
[13:19] it's a layer to see an idea to think
[13:21] it's inevitable
[13:22] that they're just going to rebel at some
[13:24] point and you have to deal with it
[13:25] yeah they're going to go through things
[13:27] every child is going to go through
[13:28] things and different phases of life will
[13:30] bring different things
[13:31] but we don't have to just roll over and
[13:33] accept the fact that yeah
[13:34] it's going to be horrible when they get
[13:36] to be teenagers
[13:38] you know it's you know they told us it
[13:40] was going to be horrible when they
[13:42] turned two
[13:44] they turned two and it wasn't horrible
[13:47] then if it didn't happen at two it'll
[13:48] happen at three they turned three and it
[13:50] wasn't terrible
[13:52] then this and this and this and you know
[13:54] you're always told
[13:55] well wait till they're teenagers because
[13:57] you know nobody likes it when things
[13:59] work out
[14:01] for somebody else it's amazing
[14:04] you know they see the family together
[14:06] and they see your children in order and
[14:07] they see the family happy and order and
[14:09] obedient
[14:09] and then the very next thing they'll say
[14:11] to you they'll say oh your family's so
[14:14] nice
[14:15] but you just wait till they're teenagers
[14:17] it's like why'd you have to say
[14:18] that why couldn't you stop with
[14:20] everything so nice why
[14:22] did you have to add that in amen and and
[14:25] so we can get that
[14:26] mindset and we can accept that as a
[14:29] truth
[14:29] and if we accept that of the truth we
[14:31] may very well get the very thing we
[14:33] believe will have
[14:34] but we have to determine that i'm not
[14:36] accepting this as an inevitable outcome
[14:39] not every teenager is going to rebel and
[14:41] it's not going to be terrible in their
[14:43] teenage years
[14:44] don't accept that as the truth that's
[14:46] not a bible truth
[14:48] amen things may be difficult they may
[14:50] not be difficult
[14:52] just wait and see what happens don't
[14:53] expect the worst
[14:57] so we want the family to be one
[15:00] now when i go back to young children and
[15:03] child training up through the toddlers
[15:04] up
[15:05] into the young children age we talked
[15:07] about that a lot
[15:08] how we establish it on uh the foundation
[15:11] of love
[15:12] and build from there and and then we we
[15:14] ended with talking about chastisement
[15:16] spanking and all kinds of punishment uh
[15:18] talked about the
[15:19] the method that god uses through seals
[15:21] trumpets vials we see it in the
[15:23] scriptures
[15:23] how god always deals with his children
[15:26] he always sends a prophet to break to
[15:28] them
[15:28] a seal he opens up what he wants them to
[15:30] know
[15:31] and then when they violate that he
[15:33] sounds a trump and he gives them a
[15:34] warning
[15:35] and when they don't hear the warning
[15:36] then the vial is poured out and
[15:38] the vial is poured out and the plague
[15:40] falls so we
[15:41] we talked about that but the the main
[15:44] thing
[15:45] and i just wanted to hit this for a
[15:46] minute before we moved on that we need
[15:48] to teach these
[15:49] these little toddlers as they move
[15:51] through is we need to teach them respect
[15:54] respect and there's a lot of things that
[15:57] they need to learn to respect
[15:59] but number one they need to respect mom
[16:01] and dad
[16:03] because that'll pay huge dividends down
[16:05] the road and they need to respect
[16:08] your word all right
[16:11] if they need to learn to respect your
[16:13] word let your yay be
[16:15] yay in your neighbor
[16:18] all right so they need to learn to
[16:22] respect the parents
[16:24] and this happens when they're we little
[16:27] because we go through the right process
[16:30] because we've got a vision of what we
[16:31] want
[16:32] and and we work according to the vision
[16:35] like i said last time
[16:36] when that little tiny todd baby is
[16:38] handed to you
[16:39] we need to have a vision for its life we
[16:42] need to have a desire for this life a
[16:44] plan that god has laid out
[16:45] and the desire we have as parents we're
[16:47] not just going to keep walking and
[16:49] hoping things work out when we get there
[16:51] but
[16:51] we've got a desire we've got a goal
[16:53] we've got a picture that we want in our
[16:55] mind
[16:55] we want a family in harmony we want our
[16:57] children to feel
[16:59] loved and content and feel safe and we
[17:01] want we want to be connected to them and
[17:03] we want to enjoy our children
[17:05] we want to enjoy our home we want other
[17:07] people to enjoy our children
[17:08] we want them to grow up to be
[17:09] respectable we want them to grow up to
[17:11] have respect
[17:12] and so we start off with a plan
[17:16] so when they have respect for their
[17:18] parents they should have respect for the
[17:21] parents
[17:21] verbal command because if you can teach
[17:25] them to respect your word you're setting
[17:27] them
[17:27] up to respect the word
[17:30] when your word doesn't mean anything
[17:33] you're setting them up for failure
[17:36] as parents we've got to teach them that
[17:39] our word
[17:39] to teach them verbal commands and not
[17:42] verbal commands spoken in anger
[17:45] this is where we get in trouble all the
[17:47] time this is where i failed many times
[17:49] but not they they learn to finally
[17:52] listen when our voice hits that certain
[17:54] tone
[17:54] we've told them multiple times in fact
[17:57] i've made this statement before i've
[17:58] heard my dad make the statement i
[17:59] repeated the same statement
[18:01] and i realized as i make this statement
[18:02] i'm speaking of failure
[18:04] in the statement and i've said i've told
[18:07] you multiple times
[18:10] that was one of my dad's favorites and
[18:12] when i repeated it
[18:14] i just announced my failure
[18:18] because i shouldn't have ever got to the
[18:19] place where i had to tell you multiple
[18:21] times
[18:22] that means i didn't go through the
[18:24] process right the first time
[18:26] that means i did not make my word
[18:29] important to you and i didn't stand by
[18:31] my word and i didn't go through the
[18:33] process
[18:33] and that's better when they're this big
[18:37] because it gets harder when they're this
[18:39] big
[18:41] the lessons are easier when they're tiny
[18:43] amen they're easier to reinforce
[18:46] you have control you run their whole
[18:48] life it's much easier when they're
[18:49] little
[18:50] so they learn to respond to your verbal
[18:52] command
[18:54] spoken in a normal tone of voice
[18:57] this is a challenge this is where we all
[18:59] fail i raised my hands first i failed
[19:02] i failed many times but i don't want to
[19:04] fail
[19:05] but i know that that's that's right we
[19:08] want them to respect other adults
[19:10] not just us in our home but respect all
[19:12] adults because
[19:13] what are we teaching them we're teaching
[19:15] them to respect authority
[19:17] anybody that's over them is worthy of
[19:19] respect because that's going to pay
[19:21] pay big dividends down the road because
[19:23] the real problem is rebellion and we're
[19:25] fighting against rebellion
[19:26] and when you teach the proper respect
[19:28] when they're young you're already
[19:29] inoculating them against rebellion
[19:32] but when you allow them to rebel to
[19:34] grandma
[19:35] we allow them to rebel to so-and-so and
[19:38] uncle this and
[19:38] and older siblings you're allowing them
[19:41] to get in an
[19:42] atmosphere of rebellion where a
[19:44] rebellion under certain circumstances is
[19:46] okay
[19:47] and like i said it's easier when they're
[19:49] this big
[19:50] to take care of this now need to teach
[19:54] them respect for church officers
[19:57] like the deacons aren't the enemies of
[19:58] little kids
[20:00] all right the teach teach them respect
[20:03] for the ministry for the
[20:04] church officers for their sunday school
[20:06] teachers for for everyone
[20:07] they need to learn respect for that they
[20:09] need to learn respect for the sanctuary
[20:12] because we've set the sanctuary apart
[20:14] and they need to realize this sanctuary
[20:16] is a place that we as a people have
[20:17] dedicated
[20:18] to the worship of the lord this isn't a
[20:20] playground
[20:22] i i remember when when our kids were
[20:24] younger i i
[20:26] expected i expected my children to sit
[20:28] in church
[20:29] and pay attention and and they could
[20:31] play
[20:32] they could play at the house they could
[20:33] play all over but they weren't coming to
[20:35] church to play
[20:36] because i wanted my children to realize
[20:38] that there is something that mom and dad
[20:40] dem way more important than your
[20:43] entertainment
[20:44] and that's worshiping god it's it's good
[20:47] for kids to realize
[20:48] i mean you're talking about just a short
[20:50] period of time coming into the sanctuary
[20:52] how many times how much time do you
[20:54] spend in the sanctuary throughout the
[20:55] week
[20:55] it's good for those children to get the
[20:57] idea that this is way more important
[20:59] than me
[21:00] this is mom and dad deemed this more
[21:01] important than me and i wanted my kids
[21:03] to know
[21:04] there is something way more important
[21:06] than you
[21:08] because that's a problem with our
[21:09] society kids growing up thinking there's
[21:10] nothing more important than them
[21:13] and that and that lesson is being
[21:14] reinforced over and over
[21:16] and over again but they need to get the
[21:17] message real clear
[21:19] early on there are things in this world
[21:21] that is more important than you
[21:22] and worshiping god is one of them and
[21:24] keeping the sanctity of the sanctuary
[21:26] is one of those things so
[21:30] so i've had questions people ask me what
[21:32] do you do and what age and
[21:34] all of this training your children to
[21:35] sit in church and all i want to say to
[21:37] you is god made you the parents
[21:39] the holy ghost will anoint you with the
[21:40] right leadership for your children
[21:42] but i also say it this way have a vision
[21:45] of what you want
[21:48] you bring them to church have an idea of
[21:50] what you want what are you looking for
[21:52] what is your expectation
[21:54] at certain ages in certain stages what
[21:56] do you expect
[21:57] i mean do you expect do you expect to
[22:00] come in and out
[22:01] 20 times well when you've got a 12 month
[22:04] old to an 18 month old that might not be
[22:06] an unrealistic expectation until they
[22:07] get trained
[22:09] but it shouldn't be that way with a
[22:11] five-year-old
[22:13] we have to understand one of that's my
[22:14] goal i want my children to learn and sit
[22:18] to sit and listen to the word will they
[22:21] catch everything no
[22:23] no but they need to learn the respect
[22:25] they need to learn the reverence they
[22:27] need to learn
[22:27] that this is what we do as a family and
[22:30] i'm coming here as a dad
[22:32] i'm coming here as mom to hear the word
[22:34] preach to worship my god and you're not
[22:36] going to distract me from worshiping god
[22:38] because this is more important that's
[22:41] not a bad lesson that's a good thing
[22:42] friends you taught your children a good
[22:45] thing
[22:47] so when we were when we were raising our
[22:49] children
[22:50] we we tried all kinds of different
[22:53] tactics we tried
[22:54] all kinds of different things but we
[22:55] begin to realize
[22:57] that toys don't work
[23:01] we thought you know bring them a little
[23:02] toy and they keep themselves a little
[23:03] entertained
[23:04] the problem is they're learning to be
[23:07] entertained in church
[23:09] and when they get tired of that one toy
[23:12] what do they look for they're bored of
[23:13] that they want another toy
[23:14] so you bring another toy and then what
[23:16] happens is mom
[23:18] brings in a bag full of toys
[23:21] to try to get through the service but it
[23:24] doesn't work it's in
[23:25] because because what we're doing is
[23:27] we're feeding into the lust of a little
[23:28] child
[23:29] the lust to be entertained and when one
[23:31] toy doesn't work they get another tour
[23:32] and get another toy
[23:34] and then you've got the toys all over
[23:35] the seat in the floor then you got kids
[23:37] laying in the floor
[23:38] smashing cars together and then you got
[23:40] the parents
[23:41] with their kids sitting next to your
[23:43] kids watching them smash cars on the
[23:44] floor
[23:45] and they're not allowed to move and now
[23:47] we're creating all kinds of trouble
[23:51] see what i mean we've got to have a
[23:54] vision what do i want
[23:55] i'm not here to entertain them i'm not
[23:57] here to make this fun
[23:58] amen now this is about listening to the
[24:01] word of god this is about worshiping god
[24:03] as a family this isn't about how much
[24:05] fun you can have
[24:05] because i promise you it won't work
[24:07] everything you do is temporary
[24:09] so then mom and dad will start hiding
[24:11] toys
[24:13] because 30 minutes into this earth they
[24:14] get dirty this toy so i got a new we're
[24:16] always
[24:17] working a gimmick we're always working a
[24:18] plan we're always hiding something back
[24:20] or we only have these toys at church
[24:24] you see what i'm saying that child's
[24:26] learning to be entertained at church
[24:28] and what will happen is if we keep
[24:30] feeding that keep feeding that keep
[24:31] feeding that
[24:32] you're going to have a pre-teen who
[24:33] cannot sit and listen to preaching he's
[24:35] bored out of his mind because he's been
[24:36] entertained all through his toddler
[24:38] years
[24:40] amen so what we did is we just decided
[24:43] that we'd let our children
[24:45] write or draw or even color
[24:48] because what am i training them to i'm
[24:50] training them to take notes in church
[24:53] i'm training them to this is my goal
[24:55] this is my vision
[24:57] amen i'll let them write amen they could
[24:59] start off with colored pencils or
[25:01] whatever
[25:01] doing a little bit of this and then that
[25:03] went away then they had just a paper and
[25:05] just a pencil
[25:06] and then they start following along in
[25:08] their bible and then they start
[25:10] and now all of them take notes
[25:13] all of them have their own notebook
[25:15] their own bible and they sit
[25:17] they write down the preacher they write
[25:18] down the day they write down what he's
[25:20] preaching
[25:20] and they write down every scripture
[25:25] amen i don't think that's an unrealistic
[25:27] expectation
[25:30] and you could say will that save them
[25:32] brother chad no that won't save them
[25:34] but it'll get them a lot further down
[25:36] the road to hearing their word than
[25:37] sitting on their knees turning their
[25:38] seats smashing cars together
[25:43] do we understand it's about the vision
[25:46] it's about the goal
[25:47] you're not going to save your children
[25:48] just because they sit nice in church
[25:50] that doesn't mean they're saved
[25:52] amen but sitting and listening in church
[25:54] is a whole lot better way to
[25:56] hear the word of god for salvation than
[25:58] playing
[25:59] and sleeping and and going in and out
[26:01] and
[26:02] running around out in the foyer or
[26:04] playing in the nursery
[26:08] you see what i'm saying there now you
[26:10] can't expect
[26:11] you know a two-year-old to take notes
[26:15] you have to be led of the spirit of god
[26:17] but you've got to have a vision what's
[26:19] my vision
[26:19] what's my goal what am i trying to
[26:21] accomplish and god what do we do now
[26:24] to meet that because if you don't have a
[26:26] vision if you don't have a goal
[26:27] then you just pack a bunch of toys
[26:30] because you're just trying to get
[26:31] through the service
[26:33] but if we do the hard work amen of
[26:35] having difficult services
[26:38] when your kid or little then once you
[26:40] get that child trained
[26:42] sitting next to you in the service doing
[26:44] something that's non-distracting
[26:46] and guess what you get to enjoy the
[26:48] service
[26:50] it pays big dividends back amen and if
[26:53] you train your oldest children
[26:55] that sets an example for the next one
[26:57] coming back and if you keep the standard
[26:58] right
[26:59] the next ones just fall right in line so
[27:01] the first one is the best one to work
[27:03] with
[27:05] because it makes it a lot easier all the
[27:06] way down
[27:08] because what's our goal our goal is to
[27:10] teach these children respect
[27:13] i can't i can't give them the holy ghost
[27:15] because they sit and look respectfully
[27:17] at the preacher and listen
[27:20] but if i can teach them to respect the
[27:21] word of god
[27:23] respect the house of god respect the
[27:26] ministry
[27:26] respect that then they're in position
[27:29] that they can receive
[27:32] and i want my children to receive the
[27:34] word as early as they're able to
[27:36] i don't want to delay it because of my
[27:38] training
[27:39] i want to do everything i can to set
[27:40] them up amen
[27:43] so that means you know i'm just sharing
[27:46] some of my
[27:48] our experiences my wife and i
[27:49] experiences because not it's not
[27:51] not any two are the same you don't have
[27:53] to do it this is not cookie cutter
[27:56] we're not making any requirements i'm
[27:57] just sharing your testimony just give
[27:59] you some inspiration
[28:00] but you need to be inspired by the lord
[28:02] on how to take this child god gave me
[28:05] and train it the way god wants it
[28:06] trained so don't
[28:08] copy everybody else you can learn good
[28:10] things you can try them but this is
[28:11] we're not in the business of copying
[28:13] anymore
[28:14] so i'm sharing some experiences not for
[28:15] you to copy them just to share them for
[28:17] inspiration
[28:18] it might inspire you in something but
[28:22] but i started myself as dad
[28:25] training my children when they were
[28:26] about 18 months old to sit in church
[28:29] before that you know they have needs
[28:30] that only mom can meet the needs and
[28:32] for us by the time 18 months was along
[28:34] we either had another baby or one coming
[28:36] really soon
[28:37] expecting one so it was kind of needful
[28:39] i got this one taken care of before the
[28:40] next infant comes along
[28:42] so hey that was necessity
[28:46] but around 18 months give or take on the
[28:48] on the child a few months
[28:49] i start training them and what i do is
[28:51] when they needed to go out
[28:52] i took them out right because they were
[28:56] already used to going out with
[28:58] mom and when mom would take him out it
[28:59] was time to eat
[29:01] to get a drink to get a change to do
[29:03] something
[29:04] amen and now that dad took him out it's
[29:06] different
[29:08] we have a transition i started taking
[29:11] them out and when dad took them out
[29:13] it was absolutely no fun whatsoever
[29:16] because we would sit on the bench out
[29:17] there and watch the monitor and they
[29:19] weren't allowed to move from my side
[29:20] sit on my lap or i would stand and hold
[29:23] them and watch the monitor because we're
[29:25] still
[29:25] about worship it's always about
[29:29] worship amen and when we're out there
[29:32] there's no pencil there's no pen there's
[29:34] no colored pencil there's no
[29:36] there's no bible book bible picture book
[29:39] there's nothing to look at nothing to do
[29:41] out there's boring but at least in my
[29:42] seat next to that
[29:44] i can flip through my bible storybook i
[29:46] can flip through my story bible
[29:47] i can write something down on a piece of
[29:49] paper at least
[29:51] there's some privilege here but there's
[29:53] no privilege out there
[29:56] see it's not rocket science it's simple
[30:00] and and it didn't take very long now i'd
[30:03] have to work with them and some
[30:04] got it like that and some took longer
[30:10] and we're not naming any names
[30:13] but they're not all the same you just
[30:16] have to deal with them according to
[30:17] understanding you know the way god
[30:19] anoints you but the fact is
[30:22] every one of them learned to sit in
[30:24] church every one of them learned to
[30:26] listen to the preacher every one of them
[30:27] learned to take notes everyone learned
[30:29] learned respect for the house of god
[30:31] respect
[30:32] for the ministry respect for the word
[30:36] so it can be done so when i take them
[30:39] out
[30:40] their feet never hit the floor
[30:44] because if they're if they're if they're
[30:46] rowdy
[30:47] rambunctious noisy in here and we take
[30:50] them out of church
[30:51] and we set them down and let them go
[30:52] running around here and playing in the
[30:54] flower pots and run from here and run
[30:56] from there
[30:56] and then they're rewarded for being
[31:00] noisy
[31:01] there's a reward so if if i'm loud in
[31:05] church
[31:05] i get to go out and play in the foyer or
[31:08] i get to go in the library and roll
[31:09] around with friends and eat snacks and
[31:11] play and have a big time
[31:12] where do you think they're going to want
[31:14] to go it's about child training
[31:19] this is about training what do i want i
[31:22] want to sit in church and hear the
[31:24] preaching of the word
[31:25] and i want my child to sit there quietly
[31:27] with me that's what i want
[31:30] if that's what we want then you have to
[31:31] work towards that it's not something
[31:33] magically that just happens one day you
[31:35] wake up and
[31:36] poof there it is i mean it might happen
[31:38] at 14 or 15 but i want it earlier
[31:42] so you have to have a vision we have to
[31:44] have a desire what is it we want to do
[31:46] and what are we looking for the nursery
[31:49] is a great place when you have a little
[31:50] toddler and sometimes
[31:51] they're just fried they just can't take
[31:53] no more i mean
[31:54] when they're wee little sometimes
[31:56] they're just fried you know they're
[31:57] fried
[31:58] hey you're fried too sometimes
[32:02] that happens but you also realize that
[32:05] sometimes
[32:05] you can go to the nursery and i don't
[32:07] know how it is now i just i'll just
[32:09] speak
[32:09] years back from experience with my wife
[32:11] in there the nursery can end up
[32:13] being a social gathering for moms
[32:16] and play time for the tots that is not
[32:20] what the church nursery's for
[32:24] it's not and it's hard because you know
[32:26] two moms sit there and their kids start
[32:27] touching each other and playing the moms
[32:29] start talking
[32:30] you gotta guard against that it's a
[32:31] natural progress of events that takes
[32:34] place it's not anybody being evil
[32:36] not anybody doing wrong but it can
[32:38] easily go that way
[32:40] to where you're sitting next to each
[32:41] other and it's hard for two sisters to
[32:43] sit next to each other and just look out
[32:45] the
[32:46] glass and just pay attention to free
[32:47] it's not in their nature
[32:49] most of the time especially when they
[32:52] have something in common like they're
[32:53] raising children they have a family
[32:54] and all of a sudden they feel that pool
[32:57] coming from the chair next to them so
[33:00] it's not an evil thing but it's
[33:01] something to be careful of
[33:03] because what are the children learning
[33:04] the children are learning the nurseries
[33:06] not
[33:07] church i don't have to pay attention
[33:08] there it's fun in there it's not fun in
[33:10] here
[33:12] so got to be careful there's times you
[33:13] need the nursery you need to use them
[33:15] their seasons of life you need them
[33:17] but be careful that the nursery is an
[33:19] extension of the sanctuary
[33:22] not a playroom and not mom's social hour
[33:27] is that clear i don't say that to be
[33:28] mean but i say that that's the truth
[33:30] we need to be aware of that because all
[33:32] of us slip a little bit we slip
[33:34] amen and bad habits come in we got to
[33:35] shake ourselves back up and guess what
[33:37] will happen we might get it right here
[33:39] and i might have to say something again
[33:40] in several years because this is human
[33:42] nature
[33:44] we have to be aware of things and come
[33:45] back in line because what's my goal is
[33:47] i want to train my child to respect the
[33:50] house of god and respect
[33:52] the word of god something else that we
[33:55] don't want is food and drinks in the
[33:57] sanctuary
[33:59] because that's not what this is for
[34:02] we've got nurseries if your child needs
[34:04] something
[34:04] you can go to a nursery but the the
[34:07] sanctuary is not for food and drinks
[34:09] even for toddlers so we want to be
[34:13] careful of that as well
[34:15] this is where we come to worship god
[34:19] he gets preeminence above everything
[34:22] else
[34:23] he gets preeminence we have nurseries
[34:26] when we have to take care of stuff but
[34:27] nursery is an extension
[34:29] of the sanctuary if you're training your
[34:31] children
[34:32] train your children think everything i'm
[34:35] doing is training
[34:38] if if they scream and yell
[34:41] and get to go look at a book and play in
[34:43] the foyer
[34:44] we just train them to be loud to get to
[34:48] go play
[34:50] it doesn't work that way we've got to
[34:52] think what we're doing
[34:54] and it matters so everything we do
[34:56] matters
[34:57] and this this this age when they're
[34:59] little they're absorbing things so fast
[35:01] they're changing
[35:02] so quickly you think i'm never going to
[35:04] get through this phase but i'll tell you
[35:05] we've been through it five times you get
[35:07] through it faster than you ever imagined
[35:10] and what you do every day that
[35:12] consistency pays off in the long run
[35:14] and you may be thinking oh the child's
[35:16] three it's they're never going to sit in
[35:18] church they're never going to get it
[35:20] i promise you they will they will
[35:23] they'll get it just stick with it some
[35:25] will get it fast
[35:26] some it will take a lot longer amen some
[35:28] will make you look like a hero
[35:30] some will make you look like a zero but
[35:33] it's not about impressing the other
[35:35] parents it's about this child
[35:37] learning respect for the sanctuary so
[35:39] that we as a family can worship god
[35:40] together
[35:41] it's not about impressing anybody else
[35:43] it's not about taking somebody else's
[35:45] tactic we've got to have the right
[35:46] vision and the right motive in doing
[35:48] what we're doing
[35:49] so we're not all copying we're not all
[35:51] trying to be the same but we all
[35:53] have the same vision that we want our
[35:55] children to learn respect
[35:57] we want our children to learn to sit and
[35:58] hear the word of god
[36:00] and you're the parent you're the one who
[36:02] determines at what age
[36:03] and what station that's why god gave
[36:05] those children to you
[36:07] not to me and not to the person sitting
[36:08] next to you and not even the grandma god
[36:10] gave him to you
[36:12] you're the one god's going to anoint to
[36:14] lead that child you know their
[36:15] temperament
[36:16] you know the maturity level you know
[36:18] what they can handle
[36:19] amen just let the lord lead you but
[36:22] don't
[36:22] make excuses when it's time to
[36:26] move to another stage you got to be led
[36:28] of the lord to move
[36:30] so don't fear anybody else don't worry
[36:32] about what anybody else is doing
[36:34] focus on the charge that god gave you
[36:36] and focus on the goal that you have for
[36:38] this child
[36:39] what do i want i want to worship
[36:41] together as a family
[36:43] i want my children to sit on my lap or
[36:45] sit next to me
[36:46] hear the word of god they can look at a
[36:48] little book that's no problem
[36:50] they can draw on a piece of paper that's
[36:51] no problem as long as they learn to
[36:54] sit respectfully and quiet and listen
[36:56] you'll watch
[36:57] you'll be able to eventually take the
[36:59] little book away they won't want it no
[37:01] more
[37:03] they'll quit drawing pictures and
[37:04] they'll start writing scriptures
[37:08] right it starts to get fun you start to
[37:11] help them look up bible verses when they
[37:13] bring their own bible guess what they
[37:14] want to do with their own bible they
[37:15] want to read what everybody else is
[37:16] reading
[37:18] what do you do you're training them in
[37:20] the service
[37:21] how to receive the word they want to
[37:24] look in their little bible
[37:26] amen and they have their own little
[37:27] bible and i remember if you remember my
[37:29] testimony
[37:30] it was out of breanna's precious moments
[37:32] bible that god spoke to me and called me
[37:34] into the ministry
[37:36] out of her precious moments bible
[37:40] man that says a lot doesn't it
[37:43] maybe that's the way i am maybe that's
[37:45] the way god has to speak to me
[37:46] but what i was doing she was sitting on
[37:48] my lap and she couldn't even
[37:50] read but i had taught her we'd turn the
[37:52] description her bible because she liked
[37:54] her bible
[37:54] and i would take her little finger and i
[37:56] would follow along as the minister read
[37:58] the scripture
[37:59] and she loved that and every time there
[38:01] would be a new scripture read and she
[38:03] saw people turning their bible she'd
[38:04] hold out her little finger
[38:07] what was i doing i was training her in a
[38:09] way that she was enjoying
[38:12] it doesn't have to be torture
[38:16] we can make it enjoyable so that the
[38:18] children enjoy
[38:19] sitting with you sitting on your lap
[38:22] you're holding them tight
[38:23] you're going through the bible with them
[38:25] you're letting sit next to you they're
[38:26] leaning on you
[38:27] it's they're close to you the kids love
[38:29] to lean on mom
[38:31] just don't let them do it when they're
[38:32] 12.
[38:35] that's odd for the people sitting behind
[38:37] you
[38:40] but but make it enjoyable but trained we
[38:43] got to train our children
[38:45] and we've got to all do this together
[38:48] amen so that i wanted to wrap up that's
[38:51] something that i wanted to get to
[38:53] last time and i didn't have a chance to
[38:55] now i want to move forward as we talk
[38:56] about going to the next stage
[38:58] as we we go through infants to toddlers
[39:01] to young children
[39:02] now we're moving up into the teenage
[39:03] years and
[39:05] this is in no way have we exhausted
[39:08] everything that we could teach or talk
[39:09] about on these subjects
[39:10] but it's just we go as the lord leads
[39:12] and we hit some things that the lord
[39:14] wants to highlight at this time
[39:15] we can always circle back around and do
[39:17] more on these things later but as we
[39:19] move into the teenage years this is like
[39:21] i said certainly not going to be
[39:22] exhaustive in any way
[39:24] but just the direction i feel to go in
[39:26] on this subject
[39:28] now i've been talking pretty much just
[39:31] to parents
[39:31] but tonight's going to be different
[39:33] because i'm going to talk to the
[39:34] teenagers and the young adults too
[39:35] because now you've been trained to sit
[39:37] in church and listen
[39:39] aren't you happy now you can listen to
[39:41] what i have to tell you
[39:42] so i'm going to talk to you and i'm
[39:44] going to talk to the parents because
[39:45] this
[39:46] once we get into this stage of life this
[39:48] is more of a team effort
[39:51] between the children and the parents
[39:53] we're going to do this stage together
[39:56] and so brother branham says the
[39:58] scripture says in ephesians 6
[40:00] children obey your parents in the lord
[40:02] for this is right
[40:03] honor thy father and mother which is the
[40:05] first commandment with promise
[40:07] that it may be well with thee and thou
[40:09] mayest live long on the earth
[40:11] this is a commandment apostle paul is
[40:14] picking up one of the commandments that
[40:15] moses
[40:16] had received from the lord one of the
[40:17] ten commandments to honor thy father and
[40:19] thy mother and he reinforces it here in
[40:21] the new testament
[40:22] this is not a scripture to the parents
[40:26] this is a scripture to you
[40:29] right your parents already know it and
[40:31] then they already had their opportunity
[40:33] either to succeed or fail
[40:35] in fulfilling this word but this is the
[40:37] part of the word that's instructed to
[40:39] you
[40:39] for you to fulfill to obey your parents
[40:43] in the lord this is right and honor thy
[40:45] father and thy mother
[40:48] the apostle paul also says in colossians
[40:50] 3 20
[40:51] children obey your parents in all things
[40:54] that's my favorite part of the scripture
[40:57] as a parent in all things
[41:00] not the things that you think i'm right
[41:02] about
[41:05] in all things trying to be your parents
[41:06] in all things for this is
[41:08] well pleasing unto your parents
[41:11] that's not the motivation for doing it
[41:14] amen
[41:14] children obey your parents and all
[41:16] things for this is well pleasing
[41:18] unto the lord
[41:22] my question to you young folks out here
[41:25] you teenagers
[41:26] is do you want to be well pleasing to
[41:28] the lord and i'm going to answer for you
[41:30] yes i know you do
[41:32] but this is how you can be well pleasing
[41:34] to the lord
[41:35] by honoring mother and father by obeying
[41:37] your parents in all things
[41:40] and i want to look at some of the
[41:41] negative side of that
[41:43] in in first samuel 15 23 it says for
[41:46] rebellion
[41:47] is as the sin of witchcraft and
[41:50] stubbornness is as iniquity
[41:52] and idolatry so this is the way god
[41:55] views rebellion
[41:57] and this is the way god views
[41:58] stubbornness so now
[42:01] you guys have come to the age of
[42:02] accountability you're beyond
[42:04] you know mom and dad controlling your
[42:06] every move you're getting into a
[42:08] situation where mom and dad
[42:09] physically can't control everything you
[42:12] do amen because you're
[42:13] you're you you have a mind you have
[42:16] a body uh that you can you can you have
[42:19] control over you can go places and do
[42:20] things someone
[42:21] some of you have driver's license you
[42:22] can drive places you can go to friends
[42:24] house
[42:25] every move you make cannot be physically
[42:27] controlled by mom and dad
[42:29] now you're moving to an age of
[42:30] accountability now it's about
[42:32] more than just mom and dad now it's
[42:34] about me being right with the lord
[42:37] now it's about me and god and to keep me
[42:40] and god right and me and god in harmony
[42:42] i have to honor my father and my mother
[42:44] and i have to obey my mom and dad
[42:47] because this is well pleasing to the
[42:48] lord this is what god wanted
[42:50] because if i show rebellion to mom and
[42:53] dad
[42:53] god views my rebellion as witchcraft
[42:58] it's evil and it's wicked
[43:01] so rebellion is the son of witchcraft
[43:04] and stubbornness is iniquity in idolatry
[43:06] so this is no longer about mom and dad
[43:10] this is about you beyond the age of
[43:12] accountability
[43:13] having to give an answer for your
[43:15] contact conduct to god
[43:18] so now it gets a little bit more serious
[43:21] now it's not the parents who are
[43:22] squirming in their seats only
[43:25] we're all in this together because
[43:27] you're beyond the age of accountability
[43:29] you'll be accountable to god
[43:32] i read this out of deuteronomy i don't
[43:34] read this to scare you because we're not
[43:35] applying this part of the law anymore
[43:38] but just to show you if a man have a
[43:40] stubborn and rebellious son
[43:42] which will not obey the voice of his
[43:44] father or the voice of his mother
[43:46] and that when they have chastened him
[43:48] will not hearken unto them
[43:50] then shall his father and his mother lay
[43:51] hold on him and bring him out into the
[43:53] elders of his city
[43:54] and unto the gate of his place and they
[43:56] shall say unto the elders of the city
[43:58] this our son is stubborn and rebellious
[44:01] he will not obey a voice
[44:02] he is a glutton and a drunkard and all
[44:05] the men of his city shall stone him with
[44:07] stones that he
[44:08] die so shalt thou put evil away from
[44:10] among you
[44:11] and all israel shall hear and fear
[44:16] so this is part of the law this is a
[44:18] commandment that came
[44:20] from god through moses and he's telling
[44:22] them that if there
[44:23] is one that is stubborn and rebellious
[44:26] and when you chasten them and they will
[44:27] not listen
[44:28] amen that you take them before the
[44:30] elders and they stone them to death
[44:32] to put evil away from you because god
[44:34] views this as
[44:36] evil so rebellion and stubbornness is
[44:39] not a phase
[44:42] is that clear it's not a phase it's not
[44:45] normal
[44:45] i mean some of you a lot of you have
[44:48] been sheltered from the world
[44:50] some of you have gone to public schools
[44:52] some of you have had
[44:53] cousins that are unbelievers and and
[44:55] friends maybe and
[44:56] you've seen this rebellious attitude
[44:58] towards parents
[44:59] you may have witnessed it you may have
[45:00] heard the attitudes you may have heard
[45:02] the conversations but you have to
[45:05] understand how god views that
[45:07] laodicean may view it as normal laodicea
[45:10] may view it as
[45:10] a phase or a stage in growth but that's
[45:13] not how god sees it
[45:15] he doesn't see it as a phase he doesn't
[45:17] see it as a normal part of growing up
[45:18] he sees it as stubbornness rebellion as
[45:22] witchcraft and iniquity and
[45:25] evil that he wanted put away from the
[45:27] camp
[45:28] so there's two responsibilities here as
[45:30] we move into our teenage years
[45:32] a responsibility for the child and
[45:34] responsibility for the parent
[45:38] luke chapter 2 verse 48 we're going to
[45:41] follow jesus's life
[45:43] it's when jesus was left behind at one
[45:45] of the feasts and
[45:46] he was astonishing the scholars in the
[45:49] temple
[45:50] and verse 48 says and when they saw him
[45:52] they were amazed
[45:53] and his mother said unto him son why
[45:55] hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy
[45:57] father
[45:58] and i have sought thee sorrowing and he
[46:00] said unto them
[46:01] how is it that you sought me wished you
[46:04] not that i must be about my father's
[46:06] business
[46:06] and they understood not the saying which
[46:08] he spake unto them
[46:10] and he went down with them and came to
[46:12] nazareth and was
[46:13] subject unto them but his mother kept
[46:17] all these sayings in her heart
[46:18] and jesus increased in wisdom and
[46:20] stature and favor with god and man
[46:22] i find this fascinating because jesus
[46:26] at 12 years old in the temple already
[46:29] knew who he was
[46:31] and he already knew what his purpose was
[46:33] and he knew what his father's business
[46:35] was
[46:35] and he knew the word in a way that was
[46:37] going to astonish
[46:39] the scribes and the pharisees he knew
[46:41] more
[46:42] than mary and joseph he had a better
[46:46] understanding than mary and joseph
[46:48] amen he was perfect he was sinless
[46:51] he was without flaw they were full of
[46:54] flaws
[46:55] his understanding was more mature than
[46:58] their understanding his vision was
[46:59] clearer than their vision do you get my
[47:01] point
[47:03] so but even in all of that jesus
[47:06] knew the position his father put him in
[47:09] and his father
[47:10] put him in this position under the care
[47:13] of mary and joseph and jesus subjected
[47:16] himself
[47:17] this is a willful act he wasn't beat he
[47:20] wasn't chained
[47:21] he subjected himself unto them
[47:25] why because he had an understanding of
[47:28] his positional placing from his father
[47:30] [Music]
[47:31] if that's where his father put him
[47:34] that's where he was going to stay
[47:36] and if these were the earthly parents
[47:38] that were given to watch over him
[47:40] until he come to a certain age and he
[47:42] would move out into his ministry
[47:44] until that time he would subject himself
[47:46] to them
[47:47] not because they were smarter not
[47:49] because they had greater revelation
[47:50] not because they knew the word better
[47:52] not because they were more righteous
[47:54] you get the point it had nothing to do
[47:57] with their merit it had nothing to do
[47:58] with their abilities
[47:59] it had nothing to do with their wisdom
[48:01] it had everything to do with his
[48:02] positional placing
[48:04] god put him here he was going to subject
[48:06] himself to them
[48:08] he was wiser he was more righteous he
[48:10] was more pure
[48:11] he had better revelation he had clearer
[48:14] vision
[48:17] so it's easy to get the understanding as
[48:19] a teenager
[48:20] even as a young adult still live in your
[48:22] parents house that you know better than
[48:24] them
[48:24] and they're wrong hey guess what you
[48:26] might
[48:28] i realize day by day my children are
[48:29] getting smarter than me
[48:32] you know we we were playing a game the
[48:35] other day
[48:36] i can't remember so are you smarter than
[48:39] a fifth grader
[48:43] i found out real quick my kids are
[48:45] smarter than me
[48:46] and my wife's smarter than me too and i
[48:49] won't tell you where i ranked but it
[48:50] wasn't highest
[48:53] it's probably somewhere in the middle of
[48:54] the pack
[48:57] but that has nothing to do with the
[49:00] position god's placed me in and the
[49:02] position god's placed in
[49:04] they're getting wiser they're getting i
[49:07] should say more knowledge
[49:10] they're they're growing up they're
[49:12] understanding things better
[49:13] sometimes we get into a discussion and
[49:16] i'll make notes this way i know it's
[49:17] that way and later i find out they were
[49:18] right i was wrong
[49:20] and that happens kind of often
[49:24] and they remembered i forgot they can do
[49:27] math faster than i can do math i mean
[49:28] you see
[49:29] all the way around it's getting bad for
[49:31] me
[49:33] except for the fact that god still
[49:35] positionally placed me as father
[49:37] them as child that hasn't changed
[49:40] that can't change that won't change at
[49:43] some point
[49:44] amen one by one they'll find a place
[49:46] under different headship
[49:47] amen but i i will always be there and i
[49:50] will always be dad
[49:52] but while they're in my home and while
[49:54] they're under my care there's a certain
[49:56] positional placing that god had ordained
[49:58] and we have to show respect unto god's
[50:01] placing
[50:02] and if god puts you under a father it
[50:05] doesn't matter if you know more than him
[50:07] if you're more righteous than him if you
[50:08] have a greater revelation than him are
[50:11] we getting the point
[50:13] it's positional placing it's showing
[50:15] respect to god
[50:17] and i respect god even if i'm having a
[50:19] hard time respecting this man or this
[50:21] woman
[50:22] i respect god amen when mary came
[50:26] to jesus mary denied the virgin birth
[50:29] right in the face of all of those
[50:31] religious leaders amen
[50:32] and she had to be rebuked by jesus
[50:36] mary was in error mary was wrong
[50:39] mary was denying what gabriel had told
[50:41] her you think
[50:42] jesus would have to listen to her then
[50:46] yes he subjected himself to her
[50:50] why because that's where the father
[50:51] wanted him to be
[50:53] and that's how he obeyed the father and
[50:55] showed honor to his father
[50:56] is by subjecting himself to the earthly
[50:58] parents he was placed under
[51:01] see brother madam says in a super sign
[51:03] but it's the father
[51:04] was in him the emmanuel the god the baby
[51:07] god jehovah god that little baby cried
[51:10] that was jehovah can you see it
[51:11] god living in a baby god living in a
[51:13] teenage what type of a teenager was he
[51:16] he set the example oh we just got it
[51:20] he set the example when he was lost by
[51:24] his father and his mother they looked
[51:25] about to find him
[51:26] and they found him in the temple what
[51:28] did he say as a teenager
[51:30] no you not wish thou not that i must be
[51:32] about my father's business
[51:33] example for the teenagers see brother
[51:36] i'm showing
[51:37] he was already had a revelation of who
[51:40] he was spiritually
[51:43] he was an example to the teenagers he
[51:45] already
[51:46] had his own revelation he already knew
[51:48] he must be about his father's business
[51:50] he wasn't waiting till later to get a
[51:53] revelation he had a revelation
[51:55] he understood who he was he knew where
[51:57] he was on earth
[51:58] he knew where he came from he knew what
[52:00] his father's business was
[52:01] and you can know it too as a teenager
[52:04] you don't have to wait till you're
[52:05] married and have children you can right
[52:06] now
[52:07] catch the revelation of what your
[52:09] father's business is for you and why
[52:10] you're here and who you are
[52:12] spiritually and that positioning
[52:16] will never put you out of your natural
[52:18] position under your natural parents
[52:21] because as soon he knew all of that he
[52:24] understood it
[52:25] but he still subjected himself to his
[52:28] mother and joseph
[52:30] followed them back brother branham said
[52:33] worked in a carpentry shop
[52:36] with joseph totally subjected himself
[52:40] knowing what he was called for subjected
[52:42] himself
[52:44] that's god's way that's the way we
[52:47] should do that
[52:49] see god chose
[52:52] saul to be king and saul
[52:55] rebelled against the word of god is that
[52:58] right
[52:59] we read that scripture where rebellion
[53:01] is the sin of witchcraft
[53:02] that's samuel speaking that to saul
[53:04] after saul rejected the word of god
[53:07] so saul rebelled against the word of god
[53:10] he was in rebellion
[53:11] he was rejected from being king and god
[53:14] chose david to be king
[53:16] but until god put david in its king
[53:20] david would not rebel against saul
[53:24] because saul was the lord's anointed so
[53:27] david
[53:28] was called out by a prophet had the
[53:30] anointing poured over him as a type of
[53:32] the baptism of holy ghost
[53:34] he knew what he was predestined for he
[53:37] knew what he was called for
[53:38] he knew what he was born for but yet god
[53:41] had placed this king saul
[53:42] and this king was in rebellion but even
[53:45] though this king was in rebellion
[53:47] this future king wouldn't be in
[53:49] rebellion just because this king's in
[53:51] rebellion
[53:53] see it's about more than the merit of
[53:55] the leadership
[53:56] it's about the expectation of god
[54:01] it's about the design and the placing of
[54:03] god
[54:04] god had put saul here and he had called
[54:07] david to replace
[54:08] all but until god moved saul and moved
[54:11] david up
[54:12] david was under saul because saul was
[54:14] king of israel
[54:16] and david would not touch the lord's
[54:18] anointing
[54:20] why because that's the way god set it up
[54:23] it didn't matter how unrighteous saul
[54:25] was acting he wouldn't go against what
[54:27] god set up
[54:28] and sometimes parents make mistakes
[54:34] they can act in ways that are
[54:35] unrighteous
[54:37] they can make decisions that aren't the
[54:39] most spiritual decisions
[54:42] and sometimes the teenagers or the young
[54:44] adults know it
[54:46] they know that's not a good decision
[54:49] they know
[54:50] you just compromise they know that what
[54:52] you just said wasn't said in
[54:53] righteousness
[54:54] they know that temper wasn't godly
[54:58] they know it they can see it they know
[55:00] it but
[55:01] even if mom and dad get them in a
[55:05] position where they rebel against the
[55:06] word of god
[55:07] by making a mistake or saying something
[55:09] wrong that never could get
[55:11] david to rebel against saul just because
[55:14] saul rebelled against god
[55:16] so just because mom and dad rebel
[55:17] against god does not give the child the
[55:20] right to rebel against mom and dad
[55:23] that makes sense so we've got to do it
[55:26] god's way
[55:27] we've got to stay in harmony with god
[55:29] and and
[55:30] and you have to make we have to make
[55:32] sure when you come to that age of
[55:33] accountability
[55:34] i'm going to do only that which pleases
[55:36] my father
[55:37] not my earthly father but my heavenly
[55:39] father and if this is the position god
[55:42] put me in
[55:42] amen i'll subject myself unto this
[55:45] because god put me here
[55:47] and his word tells me here and i'm now
[55:50] fleshing out the word of god
[55:54] so we always want to live the word when
[55:56] it's super duper stuff
[55:59] i want to manifest the word i'm going to
[56:01] speak something into existence
[56:03] but what about manifesting the word
[56:04] children obey your parents
[56:07] in all things guess what that is a
[56:09] manifestation of the word
[56:12] so we think about the word on display or
[56:14] the word being made manifest as these
[56:16] super things
[56:17] amen if you don't get the abcs right how
[56:19] are you going to do the algebra
[56:22] so it's the little foxes that spoil the
[56:24] vine
[56:25] take us out of the blessings of god
[56:27] because we don't get the little things
[56:28] right
[56:29] we don't obey in the least how will he
[56:31] give us much
[56:32] if we don't obey in the least so now
[56:36] if you're if you're seeking leadership
[56:38] as a teenager from the lord
[56:39] and you want to know your purpose in
[56:41] life and where god wants you to go and
[56:43] and you want these spiritual experiences
[56:45] with god don't forsake the little things
[56:49] don't forsake doing the things you know
[56:51] you ought to do and because you can't
[56:53] forsake this and pray for super duper
[56:55] things
[56:56] we've got to come back to the simple
[56:58] everyday living and obedience to
[57:00] our father and if we walk in obedience
[57:02] god will do the super-duper things
[57:06] praise be to god so we have to walk
[57:10] according to god's word and according to
[57:12] positional placing
[57:15] romans 1 28 and guess what guys i'm
[57:18] talking to you teenagers and i'm really
[57:20] putting the heat on
[57:21] but don't worry we're going to switch
[57:22] gears and hit mom and dad here soon
[57:24] so just hang with me can you say amen
[57:28] see i'm now i'm preaching like an
[57:29] evangelist
[57:34] because an evangelist likes to hear amen
[57:37] can you say amen
[57:41] amen romans 1 28
[57:45] and even as they did not like to retain
[57:47] god and their knowledge
[57:48] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[57:50] to do those things which are not
[57:52] convenient
[57:53] being filled with all unrighteousness
[57:55] fornication
[57:56] wickedness this is bad stuff
[57:59] fornication is bad wickedness is bad
[58:02] unrighteous is bad
[58:03] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[58:07] murder is that bad
[58:10] debate deceit malignity whispers
[58:13] backbiters
[58:14] haters of god despiteful proud boasters
[58:18] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[58:20] parents
[58:22] guess what disobedient to parents made
[58:25] the hit list of the worst
[58:30] it's not a small thing this isn't a
[58:32] trivial matter this isn't a light thing
[58:34] we should not listen to laodicea we need
[58:37] to shut off the culture
[58:38] we need to move away from what the
[58:40] culture is telling us and come back to
[58:41] the word of god
[58:43] disobedience to parents is not a light
[58:45] matter it's not a trivial thing
[58:47] it's not just you know brother bannon
[58:49] made the statement he said
[58:50] old man old woman he said you should
[58:52] never say something like that
[58:54] because that was a common terminology in
[58:56] that day oh man and that was
[58:57] doing that was just blowing off mom and
[58:59] dad just writing them off they don't
[59:00] know what they're talking about
[59:01] they're old they're already washed up
[59:03] they don't know
[59:05] remember they should never do that that
[59:08] made the list with murderers
[59:12] inventors of evil things wickedness
[59:16] i mean this is not a good list and you
[59:19] say i've never murdered
[59:21] i never invented evil things but you
[59:24] know i mean who can be obedient to their
[59:25] parents
[59:28] somehow in our mind we trivialize
[59:30] certain things and make some worse than
[59:31] others
[59:33] yes sir inventors of evil things
[59:35] disobedient to parents
[59:37] without understanding covenant breakers
[59:39] without natural affection
[59:41] implacable unmerciful
[59:45] i don't want to be on this list
[59:48] placable unmerciful who knowing the
[59:51] judgment of god that they which commit
[59:52] such things are worthy of
[59:54] death
[59:58] did you remember the law of moses
[1:00:01] disobedience to parents
[1:00:02] and the law of moses was that worthy of
[1:00:04] death
[1:00:06] according to deuteronomy it was and here
[1:00:09] paul reinforces it
[1:00:12] worthy of death not only do the same but
[1:00:14] have pleasure in them that do them
[1:00:18] not only do the same but have pleasure
[1:00:21] and them to do them because it's a big
[1:00:22] joke when somebody smarts off to their
[1:00:24] mom and dad
[1:00:26] it's funny we don't take pleasure in
[1:00:29] those that do these things
[1:00:31] it's evil this is a condition
[1:00:36] of the end time
[1:00:40] and we live in the end time and this
[1:00:42] condition is prevalent in the end time
[1:00:47] brother brandon said in questions and
[1:00:48] answers from 64.
[1:00:50] why here in london england just recently
[1:00:51] they had a rock and roll team to
[1:00:53] impersonate christ and judas and all
[1:00:55] that and
[1:00:55] they called christ daddio and talked to
[1:00:58] all those words them crazy kids talk see
[1:01:00] the teenage kids took over the world now
[1:01:03] you know
[1:01:04] that the bible predicts that
[1:01:07] this scripture that we just read in
[1:01:09] romans is a prediction
[1:01:10] of the end time disobedience to parents
[1:01:13] and teenagers start running the show
[1:01:16] now you know that the bible predicts
[1:01:17] that unthankful unholy
[1:01:19] without natural affections truce
[1:01:21] breakers false accusers disobedient to
[1:01:22] parents
[1:01:23] teenage taking over the world and it's
[1:01:26] done it
[1:01:28] i say this is a condition in our culture
[1:01:31] all around this is a condition of the
[1:01:33] end time this is a condition of laodicea
[1:01:36] all around us
[1:01:37] it is this is the world has been given
[1:01:39] over to the teenagers
[1:01:41] the parents now are just here to supply
[1:01:44] all the wants of the youth
[1:01:46] to fulfill all the youthful lust and
[1:01:48] that's the that's the role that the
[1:01:49] parents serve
[1:01:50] amen and if the parents ever try to take
[1:01:52] leadership over their child
[1:01:53] or try to rebuke them or chastise them
[1:01:55] or refuse
[1:01:57] all of a sudden they're they're evil in
[1:01:59] some way
[1:02:00] the world went completely backwards and
[1:02:02] upside down
[1:02:05] so we realize that rebellion
[1:02:08] is wicked disobedience to parents and
[1:02:10] teenagers disobeying parents
[1:02:12] is wicked in evil
[1:02:15] god hates it let's just let's just line
[1:02:18] that out right now
[1:02:19] god hates it
[1:02:23] but i want to go you guys are off the
[1:02:25] hook now
[1:02:27] praise the lord i hope you've all
[1:02:29] thoroughly repented
[1:02:32] and now it's time for the rest of us to
[1:02:34] see what else brother branham has to say
[1:02:38] let's go back to ephesians 6 1-3 we read
[1:02:41] this scripture children obey your
[1:02:42] parents in the lord
[1:02:43] for this is right honor thy father and
[1:02:45] mother which is the first commandment's
[1:02:47] promise
[1:02:47] that it may be well with thee and thou
[1:02:49] mayest live long on the earth
[1:02:51] next scripture and you fathers provoke
[1:02:54] not your children to wrath
[1:02:57] but bring them up in the nurture and
[1:02:59] admonition of the lord
[1:03:02] there's a commandment for the children
[1:03:03] but there's a commandment for the
[1:03:04] fathers
[1:03:06] and they go hand in hand like i said
[1:03:08] when we get to this stage in life we're
[1:03:10] working in a partnership
[1:03:12] because you can't control everything
[1:03:14] anymore
[1:03:15] and that's the way it should be because
[1:03:18] what was the goal from the beginning
[1:03:19] when god handed you this child
[1:03:21] that if time would permit the goal is to
[1:03:24] raise this child
[1:03:25] to be independent of you to serve god on
[1:03:28] its own
[1:03:29] to raise its own family to be part of
[1:03:31] the church to find its position in the
[1:03:32] body of believers
[1:03:33] to work independent of you that was your
[1:03:36] goal from the beginning
[1:03:37] so as you go through there should be
[1:03:39] more independence all the time
[1:03:41] you should be losing control all the
[1:03:43] time but if you've
[1:03:44] if you made the right lessons at the
[1:03:46] right stages losing control is not a
[1:03:48] problem because the child now has
[1:03:49] self-control
[1:03:50] because you taught that and trained that
[1:03:52] into them when they were tiny
[1:03:57] and so now you begin to lose control as
[1:04:00] the children get older
[1:04:01] especially as they move into young
[1:04:02] adults you can't control their every
[1:04:04] move
[1:04:05] you can't lock them in the room and only
[1:04:07] let them out to eat and do school work
[1:04:09] it doesn't work that way and so
[1:04:12] you got to be able to lose a little bit
[1:04:15] of control
[1:04:18] and you can't have control over
[1:04:21] everything
[1:04:22] but that's why you started with respect
[1:04:27] with respect because they learn to
[1:04:29] respect
[1:04:31] and although that child may get bigger
[1:04:34] than you in physical size
[1:04:36] and physically you can't do anything
[1:04:38] physically to control their behavior
[1:04:40] if we got respect right at three and
[1:04:42] four years old
[1:04:43] and we kept it all the way through it's
[1:04:46] not your physical force that holds them
[1:04:47] in the line
[1:04:48] it's the respect that they have for you
[1:04:50] that holds them in line
[1:04:54] that's why we have to work from the time
[1:04:57] they're taught
[1:04:59] all the way through so that we don't
[1:05:01] lose or miss our opportunity
[1:05:05] and your father's provoking all your
[1:05:07] children to wrath but bring them up
[1:05:09] in the nurturing admonition of the lord
[1:05:12] let's go back to colossians 3 we read
[1:05:13] this too children obey your parents in
[1:05:15] all things my favorite part
[1:05:17] right for this is well pleasing unto the
[1:05:19] lord
[1:05:20] next part fathers provoke your children
[1:05:22] provoke not your children to anger
[1:05:24] lest they be discouraged
[1:05:28] this is interesting there's a
[1:05:30] commandment for the children
[1:05:31] and a commandment for the fathers
[1:05:35] this means that as your children get
[1:05:38] older
[1:05:39] you can provoke them to anger
[1:05:43] father's provoking all your children to
[1:05:45] anger lest they be discouraged
[1:05:47] i want to look at this scripture again
[1:05:49] and i want to look at the word
[1:05:50] discouraged
[1:05:52] that word discouraged means to be
[1:05:53] disheartened
[1:05:55] dispirited or broken in spirit
[1:06:00] as the children get older we can
[1:06:04] we can provoke them to anger
[1:06:08] and they can be discouraged
[1:06:13] why because if we don't catch the
[1:06:17] transitions right
[1:06:20] and you treat a 16 year old like a 10
[1:06:22] year old
[1:06:25] it's not going to work you got to catch
[1:06:28] the transitions right
[1:06:30] to where you can nurture and train that
[1:06:33] child because
[1:06:34] every year that child should be more
[1:06:35] independent of you and of your control
[1:06:38] year after year but sometimes parents
[1:06:42] parent and a way to satisfy their own
[1:06:44] insecurity
[1:06:45] so that the child now becomes an
[1:06:47] emotional prop for them
[1:06:49] and they will never let the child grow
[1:06:51] in independence
[1:06:52] and it becomes frustrating for the child
[1:06:54] and the parents try to control every
[1:06:56] move
[1:06:57] and hold on to everything and and won't
[1:06:59] let anything go
[1:07:00] and now the child becomes frustrated
[1:07:02] because in them
[1:07:04] is built to become a man or woman
[1:07:07] they're built they're growing it's god's
[1:07:09] purpose it's god's plan in their life
[1:07:11] there's they they feel the need for
[1:07:13] independence they
[1:07:14] they feel the need to make decisions
[1:07:17] they feel the need
[1:07:18] to branch out and they have that need
[1:07:21] because that's
[1:07:21] god put that in there because they're
[1:07:23] growing to an independent position
[1:07:26] independent of you in the body in this
[1:07:28] world
[1:07:29] and something god wants to do in them
[1:07:31] and they can't stay attached to mom's
[1:07:33] apron strings until they're 24
[1:07:36] and cut loose and sent into the world it
[1:07:38] happens by degrees
[1:07:41] and we've got to catch the transition
[1:07:43] and help nurture our children through
[1:07:45] that but if we don't let them when we oh
[1:07:47] we're overbearing and over controlling
[1:07:49] as they come into those teenage years
[1:07:50] and all of a sudden we're going to
[1:07:51] create a frustration inside of them
[1:07:53] and it's go they're going to blow up
[1:07:56] they're going to blow up
[1:07:59] and then we'll blame them for the blow
[1:08:01] up
[1:08:02] but that's not what the apostle paul did
[1:08:05] the apostle paul
[1:08:06] didn't blame the children he blamed the
[1:08:09] parent the fathers
[1:08:12] rather provoke not your children to
[1:08:14] anger lest they be discouraged
[1:08:16] or broken spirited we got to be careful
[1:08:20] that we
[1:08:20] let that child grow
[1:08:24] let them make decisions let them gain an
[1:08:26] independence
[1:08:27] we should be teaching them how to work
[1:08:31] from the time they're little get them
[1:08:33] out and work they should know how to
[1:08:34] work
[1:08:35] they should know how to fill out
[1:08:36] paperwork amen they should be able to
[1:08:38] balance a checkbook
[1:08:41] i'm amazed that 16 17 18 year old kids
[1:08:43] they can't balance a checkbook they
[1:08:45] don't understand the basics of managing
[1:08:47] money
[1:08:47] they why because mom and dad do
[1:08:49] everything for them and have taught them
[1:08:51] nothing
[1:08:52] because they act like they're going to
[1:08:53] stay with them for the rest of their
[1:08:54] lives but we realize we're not training
[1:08:56] them to stay with us the rest of their
[1:08:57] lives
[1:08:58] we're training them to go fulfill god's
[1:08:59] purpose for them
[1:09:02] so they they need to know they need to
[1:09:04] be trained
[1:09:05] they need to be taught and they need to
[1:09:07] be given the chance
[1:09:09] to do it they need to be given some
[1:09:12] liberty
[1:09:15] guess what they don't always get it
[1:09:18] right
[1:09:20] they'll make some mistakes along the way
[1:09:23] but they how else are they going to
[1:09:25] learn
[1:09:33] i want to look at a quote here
[1:09:38] this is a story brother branham tells
[1:09:39] about his family and i think it takes
[1:09:42] this scripture and it puts it into
[1:09:43] perspective
[1:09:45] and i just want to talk about this out
[1:09:47] of questions and answers from 1964.
[1:09:51] brother bram says i just went through
[1:09:53] the experience with my rebecca
[1:09:55] she just committed to to god she was 17
[1:09:57] getting ready to turn 18.
[1:10:00] so i just committed to god when she got
[1:10:03] to be a little teen
[1:10:04] tiani and she was going with some girl
[1:10:06] when we first went out there going
[1:10:08] run over to some girl's house taking
[1:10:10] music lessons and this girl
[1:10:11] i come by one day and here this girl was
[1:10:14] sitting there at the piano playing rock
[1:10:15] and roll
[1:10:16] well that was just enough for me so i
[1:10:18] told her to stay away from over there
[1:10:20] and then she said well it's the only
[1:10:22] place i got to take music
[1:10:23] you know how tea annie's get
[1:10:28] and i said every kid has to go through
[1:10:29] that practically everyone goes through
[1:10:31] that age you did
[1:10:32] i did and we got to think their thoughts
[1:10:36] think of what brother ben i'm saying
[1:10:38] he's not saying she should have never
[1:10:40] said that
[1:10:40] she shouldn't have he is
[1:10:43] telling the parent to try to understand
[1:10:45] the child
[1:10:49] you have to think their thoughts so then
[1:10:51] a few days after that her mother got
[1:10:53] after her for something and she sassed
[1:10:55] her
[1:10:55] now that's not rebecca at all took off
[1:10:58] and slammed the door almost and knocked
[1:11:00] the things off the wall went to school
[1:11:02] now i ought to have seemingly oh i love
[1:11:05] that word seemingly
[1:11:06] i ought to have seemingly just taken my
[1:11:08] belt off and followed her out there in
[1:11:10] the yard
[1:11:10] and brought her back with warps around
[1:11:12] her see but i thought wait a minute i
[1:11:14] got to think 18 year old thoughts see
[1:11:17] now i said mother i know that she
[1:11:20] started to cry me to i said
[1:11:21] i know you've done all you can do i've
[1:11:23] done all i can do
[1:11:24] now if it's out of our hands we have to
[1:11:27] take the next step
[1:11:30] further says i said well look honey now
[1:11:32] you've got to listen to me it's hard for
[1:11:34] you to do this i'm your husband
[1:11:36] but people drive across the nations and
[1:11:38] around for just a few
[1:11:40] words of advice now i talked to her the
[1:11:42] other day and she just walked away from
[1:11:44] me
[1:11:44] now becky never did do that to me
[1:11:48] you ever had that were you trying to
[1:11:49] talk to your children they just walk
[1:11:51] away from you
[1:11:53] does that do to your blood pressure
[1:11:59] what does it do to your adrenal glands
[1:12:00] your fight-or-flight syndrome
[1:12:06] right but that's the moment you can
[1:12:08] provoke them to anger
[1:12:10] right there or you can have
[1:12:13] understanding
[1:12:15] and you can try you can try to train
[1:12:18] them through this to become independent
[1:12:19] adults
[1:12:21] usually that's what this battle is over
[1:12:25] there's a struggle for independence
[1:12:27] because god put it there
[1:12:29] and there there is a resistance to their
[1:12:31] independence
[1:12:33] sometimes it's righteous they can't go
[1:12:35] and be as free as they want to free
[1:12:36] be free you've got to hold them back but
[1:12:38] sometimes you're holding them back too
[1:12:40] long and they should be more free
[1:12:41] usually this struggle is all about how
[1:12:44] much independence
[1:12:47] and it's going to take some real
[1:12:48] leadership from the holy ghost for you
[1:12:50] mom and dad and especially dad taking
[1:12:52] some real leadership to know where that
[1:12:54] child's at
[1:12:55] amen and not be overbearing or
[1:12:57] controlling and not
[1:12:59] provoke them unto wrath but find out god
[1:13:02] where
[1:13:02] am i where is the place that i should be
[1:13:05] letting them go and
[1:13:06] giving them freedom and holding them
[1:13:07] back because most of the time
[1:13:09] these these situations are based off of
[1:13:12] that
[1:13:14] he said now becky never did do that to
[1:13:17] me
[1:13:18] and when her mother said something about
[1:13:19] it she slammed the door and said you
[1:13:21] expect me to sit here and be a
[1:13:22] wallflower all my life
[1:13:24] and blam me she slammed the door and
[1:13:25] went out that was the devil
[1:13:28] boy that was easy to diagnose that was
[1:13:31] the devil
[1:13:33] but his daughter wasn't the devil
[1:13:40] it was the devil influencing her
[1:13:43] he didn't wage war against his daughter
[1:13:47] he's going to wage war against that
[1:13:48] devil
[1:13:51] see we're coming to a different level
[1:13:53] this isn't where you jerk them up
[1:13:54] swat them on the tail and tell them
[1:13:56] never to do it again we should have
[1:13:58] already been through that
[1:13:59] you should already be past that i mean
[1:14:01] you go to you go to when you've got a
[1:14:03] toddler
[1:14:04] you go to multiple multiple spankings
[1:14:07] per day
[1:14:08] sometimes multiple per hour in certain
[1:14:10] seasons
[1:14:13] then as they move up you're going into a
[1:14:16] handful per week
[1:14:18] then a handful per month and then a
[1:14:21] handful per year
[1:14:24] and then you're done chastising is not
[1:14:26] going to work anymore
[1:14:28] you see the time to to take them and
[1:14:31] deal with that right there
[1:14:32] that time has passed we're in a
[1:14:35] different stage and we need to awaken
[1:14:36] ourselves to it
[1:14:38] take the prophet as our example
[1:14:41] so now that that was the devil you know
[1:14:44] what he didn't do
[1:14:45] he didn't go tell his daughter you're
[1:14:47] possessed of an evil spirit
[1:14:51] that could provoke them to anger
[1:14:56] he didn't lay hands on her and cast a
[1:14:57] demon out
[1:15:00] he was the one with the understanding he
[1:15:03] wasn't asking her to have the
[1:15:04] understanding
[1:15:05] he was the one who's having the
[1:15:08] understanding
[1:15:10] further down he says and then when she
[1:15:13] started that
[1:15:14] and i took me to i took me to about an
[1:15:16] hour i said mita
[1:15:18] take your hands off me that's my kid
[1:15:22] i said isn't it mine too all right i
[1:15:25] said
[1:15:25] if she was dying this morning you'd have
[1:15:27] to commit her to god for eternal
[1:15:29] destination
[1:15:30] why can't we commit her to god now for
[1:15:32] her earthly journey
[1:15:35] and she said well that's my kid i said
[1:15:37] it's mine too
[1:15:38] i said now can you take your me not say
[1:15:41] anything to her
[1:15:42] i said i never said that will quit
[1:15:45] scolding her
[1:15:46] just advise her
[1:15:50] oh brother branham caught something
[1:15:53] later on he's going to tell his wife
[1:15:55] this is of the lord brother branham
[1:15:58] caught this
[1:15:58] he wasn't compromising
[1:16:02] he wasn't letting her get away with
[1:16:03] stuff brother branham later told his
[1:16:05] wife that the vice he gave her was
[1:16:07] of the lord
[1:16:12] now that doesn't mean every time your
[1:16:13] child back talks you you take your hands
[1:16:15] off
[1:16:17] but you have to be led of the lord we
[1:16:19] have to be sensitive to the spirit
[1:16:21] we have to be the adult we have to be
[1:16:23] the one who's born again of the holy
[1:16:24] ghost we have to be the one leading
[1:16:27] not provoking the anger
[1:16:30] he said i never said that we'll quit
[1:16:32] scolding her just advise her
[1:16:35] she needs a buddy and you're the only
[1:16:38] one to be her buddy
[1:16:40] you and i we're her parents these kids
[1:16:43] today
[1:16:44] needs a buddy they don't need a drill
[1:16:48] sergeant
[1:16:50] they don't need a correction officer
[1:16:52] they don't need a parole officer
[1:16:54] right do you get the point they need an
[1:16:57] advocate
[1:16:59] they need one who can stand alongside
[1:17:00] and help them through they need one that
[1:17:02] can advise them they need one that can
[1:17:04] keep their calm
[1:17:05] when the when the teenager can't keep
[1:17:06] their calm they need a father who'll
[1:17:08] keep his calm
[1:17:11] when they're not born again yet they
[1:17:12] need somebody who's born again already
[1:17:14] and to overshadow and to take care of
[1:17:16] them and to be there to work out a plan
[1:17:18] of redemption for them
[1:17:21] amen they don't need a parole officer
[1:17:23] they don't need a corrections officer
[1:17:25] they understand do they get so they're
[1:17:28] wrong yes they need to be told
[1:17:30] they're wrong but they need advice
[1:17:33] they need correction and they need
[1:17:35] correction
[1:17:36] as a young adult not correction as a
[1:17:39] five-year-old
[1:17:41] they don't need an 11-year-old
[1:17:43] correction they need a 16 17 18 19
[1:17:46] 20 year old 21 year old kind of
[1:17:48] correction
[1:17:49] you have to understand as things change
[1:17:51] just because they turn 13 don't mean you
[1:17:53] turn them over
[1:17:54] but between 13 and 19 is a huge progress
[1:17:57] they come in one way and they go out
[1:17:59] another way
[1:18:00] amen and your relationship should be
[1:18:01] changing with them and your approach to
[1:18:03] them
[1:18:04] should be changing along the way it's
[1:18:06] not going to be the same at 13 and 19.
[1:18:09] and it won't be the same for every child
[1:18:11] because there's different maturity
[1:18:12] levels
[1:18:12] there's different abilities and then
[1:18:14] they progress in maturity in different
[1:18:16] ways
[1:18:16] so you've got to be led of the spirit of
[1:18:18] god all the time
[1:18:20] and be prayed up because it's a crucial
[1:18:22] time to get them through this time
[1:18:24] amen so that they and they and you can
[1:18:26] stay in contact with one another so that
[1:18:28] you can advise them
[1:18:31] if not if we don't handle the situation
[1:18:33] right we get ourselves in a situation
[1:18:35] where the relationship is so broken you
[1:18:38] can't even give a word of advice
[1:18:42] and that's a bad place to be
[1:18:45] we don't want to provoke them to anger
[1:18:48] so that they be discouraged
[1:18:52] when you say something to your child and
[1:18:54] they turn around and smirnoff back to
[1:18:55] you and say something very mean and very
[1:18:57] hurtful
[1:18:58] and walk away from you what do you think
[1:19:00] it does to them
[1:19:03] we always think about what it does to me
[1:19:06] how can they talk to me that way
[1:19:08] how could they say those things don't
[1:19:09] they know how how rebellious and how
[1:19:11] hurtful that is
[1:19:12] and all we're thinking about is me me me
[1:19:14] but you know every time that child
[1:19:16] stood in the face of his dad or his mom
[1:19:18] and said hateful
[1:19:19] rude mean things and then walked away
[1:19:23] you know it killed them you know it did
[1:19:26] damage to the inside of that teenager
[1:19:29] and sometimes we can't get past the way
[1:19:31] it made us
[1:19:32] feel to recognize that they need an
[1:19:36] advocate right now
[1:19:38] they need a buddy they don't need a
[1:19:40] drill sergeant
[1:19:45] see right now i'm preaching to myself
[1:19:48] just as much as anybody else because
[1:19:50] i've we've got to make these transitions
[1:19:53] we've got to see what the prophet told
[1:19:55] us and we've got to say
[1:19:56] what i'm doing isn't working god you got
[1:19:58] to show me what works
[1:20:02] amen we're not exempt and some of us you
[1:20:05] know we have different temperaments
[1:20:06] and the child with a different
[1:20:07] temperament and and it's a different
[1:20:09] mixture every time and and some go one
[1:20:13] way and some go the other
[1:20:14] some like i said will be easy some will
[1:20:16] be difficult but it's going to take the
[1:20:17] leading of god leading through a holy
[1:20:19] ghost-filled parent
[1:20:20] amen not not not just condemning not
[1:20:24] just
[1:20:25] chastening not just scolding all the
[1:20:27] time but they need a buddy they need an
[1:20:29] advocate they need somebody that will
[1:20:30] advise
[1:20:32] so we've got to maintain the
[1:20:34] relationship and we've got to understand
[1:20:40] says she needs a buddy and you're the
[1:20:42] one to be her buddy you and i
[1:20:44] we're her parents these kids today needs
[1:20:46] a buddy
[1:20:47] i'm so glad we had a prophet i mean
[1:20:50] he'll talk about that old mammy taking a
[1:20:52] a barrel slat and wearing that girl out
[1:20:55] he'll talk about this and he'll talk
[1:20:56] about that
[1:20:56] but it'll also open up and tell you
[1:20:59] exactly
[1:21:00] what went down in his home
[1:21:04] so we're not too much this way and too
[1:21:06] much that way
[1:21:07] so that we can come right down the
[1:21:08] middle of the room
[1:21:11] these kids today needs a buddy if they
[1:21:13] had a mother and a father would stay
[1:21:15] home and take care of them instead of
[1:21:16] out here and bar room running around all
[1:21:18] night and things like that
[1:21:19] wouldn't have a juvenile delinquency see
[1:21:23] on down paragraph 130 he says so we
[1:21:26] there
[1:21:26] got down on our knees and committed it
[1:21:28] to god
[1:21:30] they didn't let it go they didn't ignore
[1:21:33] it
[1:21:34] they got down on their knees together
[1:21:37] mom and dad
[1:21:38] and committed it to the lord committed
[1:21:40] it to god
[1:21:41] i said i know she's 18 years old we'll
[1:21:43] be in a few days
[1:21:44] and she and the girl that age will think
[1:21:46] about boyfriends and we've kept her in
[1:21:48] said i never wanted to see her get
[1:21:50] married i want to put her in the office
[1:21:51] there to do work
[1:21:52] i want to see her filled with the spirit
[1:21:54] and live like them
[1:21:56] and well we all want that she said well
[1:21:59] we can't do that said she just won't
[1:22:01] listen to it
[1:22:02] i said wait a minute we've raised her
[1:22:04] all we can
[1:22:06] now put her in the hands of god commit
[1:22:10] her
[1:22:10] and i said then when she does anything
[1:22:13] say becky darling
[1:22:14] mother don't want you to do that but i'm
[1:22:16] your pal i'll stick by you see
[1:22:18] let her know that you love her she's
[1:22:20] going to get somebody to love her
[1:22:23] and it might be the wrong woman see i
[1:22:26] said you be the woman that does the
[1:22:27] loving
[1:22:28] i said honey that sounds kind of crude
[1:22:30] but people come
[1:22:31] everywhere and sit on personal
[1:22:33] interviews and things i said i'm so
[1:22:35] common we're common to one another
[1:22:37] because we're husband and wife but we
[1:22:38] never let that happen you must remember
[1:22:41] this is in the name of the lord praise
[1:22:44] god
[1:22:45] this is in the name of the lord you mean
[1:22:46] in the name of the lord i can be my
[1:22:48] child's buddy
[1:22:51] that's what god led the prophet to do
[1:22:53] for his daughter
[1:22:56] what will he lead us to do i don't know
[1:22:58] we should pray about it and find out
[1:23:00] what god wants
[1:23:03] she said all right we got down and
[1:23:07] committed it to god said we'd take our
[1:23:08] hands off of it that afternoon she came
[1:23:10] in she said well
[1:23:12] i guess you're still saying i ain't
[1:23:13] going over there me he said no i never
[1:23:15] said nothing about him
[1:23:16] he said you know mother don't want you
[1:23:18] to do that and you know
[1:23:20] what like to kill your daddy when he
[1:23:21] heard you up there playing that boogie
[1:23:22] woogie music over what it was
[1:23:25] with that girl so now he didn't want you
[1:23:28] to do that
[1:23:29] and we don't want you to do that becky
[1:23:31] but we just committed it to the lord
[1:23:32] i want you to know we love you whatever
[1:23:34] you do we still love you
[1:23:37] she hollered said i'm going anyhow
[1:23:41] let her spout off a little bit she
[1:23:44] hollered and said i'm going anyhow
[1:23:46] said all right dear so went ahead said
[1:23:48] all right
[1:23:49] i'll have supper ready when you get back
[1:23:51] she never did go
[1:23:54] no she never went since
[1:23:57] see not long after that she met george
[1:24:00] george is a christian
[1:24:01] that settled it then she's trying to
[1:24:04] listen she's trying to tell mrs wood
[1:24:06] about it the other day she said
[1:24:08] oh i got awful wild
[1:24:11] so she just said daddy and mother
[1:24:13] committed me to the lord said
[1:24:15] awful wild but that was wild to us
[1:24:18] we don't want to get any wilder than
[1:24:20] that
[1:24:24] that was wild to us but you see
[1:24:28] brother branham was led of the lord to
[1:24:30] take an action
[1:24:32] different than the initial reaction
[1:24:35] to have an understanding and to stay in
[1:24:38] his position
[1:24:40] see you have a father or a mother that's
[1:24:43] in a position of leadership over a home
[1:24:45] and you have a teenager they're moving
[1:24:47] up in maturity but they're still
[1:24:49] under this head chin but what happens is
[1:24:51] because of teenage
[1:24:52] passions and because of teenage hormones
[1:24:55] and because of
[1:24:55] this frustration between wanting freedom
[1:24:58] and not having freedom and
[1:24:59] it's a natural thing that's happening
[1:25:01] inside and because of that frustration
[1:25:03] they may spout off and be disrespectful
[1:25:05] and say things
[1:25:06] and immediately we move out of our
[1:25:08] position
[1:25:09] and put ourselves down on a teenage
[1:25:12] position
[1:25:13] and start arguing with a teenager
[1:25:19] i know i'm not the only one guilty of
[1:25:20] that
[1:25:23] what happened we left our position when
[1:25:25] we left our position we left our power
[1:25:30] but what brother branham did is he
[1:25:32] didn't take the devil's bait
[1:25:35] because when she slammed the door that
[1:25:37] was the devil
[1:25:38] and brother branham didn't get anointed
[1:25:40] by the devil to go in there and slam it
[1:25:42] again
[1:25:46] right sometimes we
[1:25:50] catch each other's anointing
[1:25:55] i'm not the only one guilty of that
[1:25:57] either
[1:26:00] and we've got to remember i'm the high
[1:26:04] priest of this home
[1:26:08] they can act the way they want that
[1:26:10] devil can rise to rise up
[1:26:12] but i have the authority and power to
[1:26:14] shut it down
[1:26:17] but i can't shut it down down here
[1:26:20] i have to stay here i can't let my
[1:26:23] emotions i can't let
[1:26:25] the hurtful words i can't let all this
[1:26:26] drag me down to the same level as my
[1:26:28] teenager
[1:26:29] i have to stay in my position and if i
[1:26:32] stay in my position it means i may have
[1:26:34] to let them run their mouth for a little
[1:26:36] bit
[1:26:36] and move off the scene and then i'll go
[1:26:38] take spiritual authority over what's
[1:26:40] happening in my home
[1:26:43] because there's a power that comes in
[1:26:45] our position and brother branham just
[1:26:47] exercised that with his wife they got
[1:26:48] down on the knees and they committed
[1:26:50] to god they didn't have to go toe-to-toe
[1:26:52] with a teenager that was being
[1:26:53] influenced by an evil spirit
[1:26:54] they could go above that and they could
[1:26:57] go to the throne of the father and say
[1:26:59] this is my child and i'm committing this
[1:27:02] child to you
[1:27:04] see we have to understand this is
[1:27:06] spiritual warfare
[1:27:08] we got to stay in our position as
[1:27:10] mothers and fathers amen and not get
[1:27:12] sucked down to
[1:27:13] verbal combat and the reason we get into
[1:27:16] verbal combat
[1:27:17] is always selfishness because of the way
[1:27:20] that child made us feel
[1:27:23] we got frustrated we got anger we were
[1:27:25] hurt they hurt our feelings
[1:27:28] i'm also not the only one guilty of that
[1:27:31] i'm not going to raise
[1:27:32] hands because it's unanimous
[1:27:36] what we need is to take the cue from the
[1:27:39] prophet and say god
[1:27:41] i want to take dominion over the
[1:27:42] situation
[1:27:44] and i want to nurture and lead that
[1:27:46] tenure all the way through
[1:27:47] all the way through as long as as i've
[1:27:49] got this influence over them and they're
[1:27:51] in my home i want to lead them all the
[1:27:52] way through
[1:27:53] god give me wisdom in this situation
[1:27:55] sometimes we just got to let
[1:27:56] the let the child talk it doesn't matter
[1:28:00] how wrong it is you can always correct
[1:28:02] things later
[1:28:04] some things don't have to be dealt with
[1:28:05] right then
[1:28:07] don't forget you're in control of their
[1:28:09] whole life
[1:28:12] you know sometimes we get pulled from
[1:28:14] this position down to this position
[1:28:17] and get into verbal combat that's never
[1:28:19] going to work what we need to do is stay
[1:28:20] in our position
[1:28:21] and let the let them spout off mouth off
[1:28:24] act rebellious say hurtful things
[1:28:26] whatever we go
[1:28:28] and pray about it but then the next time
[1:28:30] they need a ride over to a friend's
[1:28:31] house
[1:28:34] all you have to say is no
[1:28:37] calm not angry
[1:28:40] hey dad so-and-so wants me to come over
[1:28:42] i want to go over to
[1:28:44] sister so-and-so's house they're having
[1:28:45] some fellowship i'm sorry sweetheart
[1:28:49] i don't really feel like taking you over
[1:28:50] there because of the way you spoke to me
[1:28:54] you're not fighting you're not arguing
[1:28:56] you're
[1:28:57] in control you're in your place
[1:29:01] you don't have to fight back we don't
[1:29:04] have to
[1:29:05] get sucked down to the level of a 16
[1:29:07] year old
[1:29:08] we can stay on our spot
[1:29:14] so there's all kinds of different ways
[1:29:16] to deal with the situation
[1:29:18] some things have to be corrected some
[1:29:19] things you can't let it go like brother
[1:29:21] branham did
[1:29:22] some things have to be corrected but
[1:29:24] you're in total control of the
[1:29:25] correction
[1:29:27] they live in your house they're probably
[1:29:30] on your cell phone plan
[1:29:36] it's probably your money that they
[1:29:37] sustained them with
[1:29:39] early on when they first start driving
[1:29:41] they're probably driving your car
[1:29:43] if they're not driving they're probably
[1:29:44] asking you to drive them
[1:29:47] who says you have to you have to take
[1:29:49] disrespect
[1:29:50] and hatefulness and still drive them to
[1:29:52] their friend's house
[1:29:56] who's running the show then
[1:30:01] you can stay calm we can stay in control
[1:30:03] we if there has to be correction we can
[1:30:05] have calm
[1:30:06] correction that hits them where it hurts
[1:30:08] the most
[1:30:10] without yelling without screaming
[1:30:13] without getting into
[1:30:14] verbal combat without any kind of
[1:30:16] altercation at all
[1:30:18] oh they might get upset and go slam the
[1:30:19] door again it doesn't matter they're
[1:30:21] still not going
[1:30:24] they'll eventually learn that if i want
[1:30:26] to do what i want to do
[1:30:27] i've got to do what mom and dad wants me
[1:30:30] to do
[1:30:31] or else i'm going to be my own prisoner
[1:30:36] so not everything has to be we'll just
[1:30:38] let it go no
[1:30:40] some things you can't let go some things
[1:30:42] have to be dealt with even when they're
[1:30:44] teenagers
[1:30:45] but stay in position stay here to deal
[1:30:48] with it
[1:30:49] don't come down here to deal with it
[1:30:51] stay mom and dad
[1:30:52] stay the high priest of the home stay
[1:30:54] the king of your castle
[1:30:57] pass down righteous judgment that makes
[1:30:59] good sense
[1:31:00] and you don't have to explain yourself
[1:31:02] and you don't have to debate
[1:31:03] and there's no court session they're not
[1:31:06] they're not defending themselves on the
[1:31:07] court of law you're the king you made
[1:31:08] the decision
[1:31:10] don't get sucked in debate because all
[1:31:13] it's going to do is is
[1:31:14] gender an argument which is going to
[1:31:15] cause you to provoke your child to wrath
[1:31:18] stay in control stay calm make sound
[1:31:21] decisions
[1:31:22] don't get sucked in when the devil's
[1:31:24] trying to influence a weaker vessel
[1:31:26] don't get sucked in to something that's
[1:31:27] going to bring you out of your lofty
[1:31:29] position down
[1:31:30] to a lower position and then you're
[1:31:31] getting caught in the same
[1:31:33] influence of the same spirit we gotta we
[1:31:35] gotta think differently
[1:31:38] but the man told his wife what she needs
[1:31:40] now is a buddy
[1:31:42] and you're the one to be your buddy
[1:31:45] he said it's in the name of the lord he
[1:31:47] had caught an inspiration he knew what
[1:31:48] to do he committed to god
[1:31:50] and they told her you can go but we
[1:31:51] don't want you to do and it all nearly
[1:31:53] killed your dad
[1:31:54] we don't want you to that's not right
[1:31:56] but i still love you anyhow and i'll
[1:31:58] have supper ready when you get back
[1:32:01] she never went and never went again
[1:32:05] praise be to god i'd rather work by
[1:32:08] inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:32:10] than any psychology book in the world
[1:32:15] god knows how to anoint the parent that
[1:32:17] he placed that child
[1:32:18] under you're the one he'll deal with to
[1:32:21] deal with that child
[1:32:22] you just have to have a relationship
[1:32:23] with god and stay tuned in that's why
[1:32:26] applying the token is so much more than
[1:32:29] after the fact hopes that it'll fix a
[1:32:31] situation that's already gone awry
[1:32:34] but apply the token before the child's
[1:32:36] born
[1:32:38] and keep the token applied the entire
[1:32:40] time that child's in your house
[1:32:42] because he says because it'll take an
[1:32:44] effect on them
[1:32:46] what the token life in the home will
[1:32:48] have an effect and influence over that
[1:32:50] child their whole life
[1:32:52] don't wait till they've already gone
[1:32:53] awry then try to apply the token apply
[1:32:55] the token before you ever bring them
[1:32:56] home from the hospital
[1:32:58] and keep it applied the entire time and
[1:33:01] it will take an effect
[1:33:02] and we have to live that's why mom and
[1:33:04] dad have to live a consecrated holy life
[1:33:09] or else we get sucked in to these little
[1:33:12] evil things
[1:33:13] and we gotta stop getting sucked into
[1:33:15] these things
[1:33:17] this quote did me a world of good
[1:33:20] understanding i'd like to wrap up with
[1:33:24] this
[1:33:26] the message thy house 1961.
[1:33:31] usually who would you get a teenager to
[1:33:33] sit around and listen to someone preach
[1:33:35] and talk
[1:33:36] why they'd be out and gone somewhere
[1:33:38] little girls like that
[1:33:40] brother branham was complimenting the
[1:33:41] teenagers that were sitting and
[1:33:42] listening to his preaching
[1:33:45] so where do you get teenagers to sit and
[1:33:46] listen like that i want to ask you the
[1:33:48] same question where do you get teenagers
[1:33:50] to sit and listen
[1:33:51] to two and two and a half hour sermons
[1:33:54] where in the world is it no
[1:33:58] no no fun activity no game just
[1:34:02] preaching
[1:34:04] they'd be outgoing somewhere little
[1:34:05] girls like that i said to brother fred
[1:34:07] his kids they can just hear me say one
[1:34:09] thing that's wrong
[1:34:11] then they're they're ready to stop it
[1:34:13] right now you see
[1:34:14] brother said this is wrong they're ready
[1:34:16] to stop it right then
[1:34:17] and set with the highest respect instead
[1:34:19] of being out of hot rotting
[1:34:21] rambling around they when they hear you
[1:34:23] speak about the gospel they're ready to
[1:34:25] sit right there and listen see
[1:34:27] now i know we all think our kids as
[1:34:29] renegades and things like that
[1:34:31] but we must stop that
[1:34:34] i believe that we must remember that
[1:34:36] these kids are the best
[1:34:37] kids in the world because they're our
[1:34:40] children and we claim them for god
[1:34:45] see what he's teaching his congregation
[1:34:47] stop
[1:34:48] thinking they're bad kids they're not
[1:34:50] bad kids
[1:34:53] we don't have any bad kids here
[1:34:58] you know just because a child hits that
[1:35:01] stage where they're struggling for that
[1:35:02] independence
[1:35:03] and there's a little power struggle in
[1:35:04] the house of independence that's not
[1:35:06] uncommon
[1:35:07] that's not far from being normal that
[1:35:09] doesn't make them evil that doesn't make
[1:35:11] them bad kids
[1:35:13] they just need special leadership and
[1:35:15] guidance through that transition in life
[1:35:17] amen they need a parent that can
[1:35:19] understand what's happening
[1:35:20] and be led of the lord to lead them
[1:35:22] through that time but that's a normal
[1:35:23] thing and it's a healthy thing in many
[1:35:25] ways
[1:35:27] but they're not bad we got to remember
[1:35:28] these are the best kids in the whole
[1:35:30] world
[1:35:31] because we've committed them to god
[1:35:34] we've committed them many of us we've
[1:35:36] brought them as infants we brought them
[1:35:38] to the altar and we put them in the
[1:35:40] hands of a minister so that minister
[1:35:42] could take and dedicate that child to
[1:35:43] the lord we have to have
[1:35:45] faith in what we did right then we don't
[1:35:48] do that out of tradition we don't we
[1:35:50] don't do that just because
[1:35:51] everybody wants to see the cute baby in
[1:35:53] the cute outfit that has nothing to do
[1:35:55] with why we're bringing them up
[1:35:56] we're bringing them up because we want
[1:35:58] to dedicate this child to the lord
[1:36:00] that the lord will look after this life
[1:36:03] because we realize as parents will fail
[1:36:06] we realize we'll get things wrong
[1:36:07] we're going to make mistakes along the
[1:36:09] way but we commit this life to you
[1:36:11] and we commit ourselves to you to use us
[1:36:14] to shape this life but where we fail
[1:36:16] we're trusting in you to keep this life
[1:36:19] and we've got to have confidence in that
[1:36:21] prayer of dedication
[1:36:23] we got to believe it it's don't don't
[1:36:25] ever come and dedicate a baby
[1:36:27] just out of tradition do it with full
[1:36:29] faith in your heart
[1:36:30] then i'm asking god if i dedicate this
[1:36:33] child that god will keep this child all
[1:36:35] the days of its life
[1:36:38] and believe it when things go wrong go
[1:36:40] back to your dedication
[1:36:43] when things get rough go back to the
[1:36:45] dedication and say god
[1:36:46] we dedicated this son we dedicated this
[1:36:49] girl to you in the name of the lord
[1:36:51] and we're trusting you to help us in
[1:36:52] this time we trusted you to keep them
[1:36:55] from the time they're in heaven and we
[1:36:56] need you now god but we're trusting
[1:36:58] that when we committed that child to you
[1:37:00] that you are going to take control
[1:37:04] we've got to live by faith not by
[1:37:06] reasoning
[1:37:07] back by faith and we got to believe
[1:37:10] that we got the best kids in the world
[1:37:16] if you don't believe that go to walmart
[1:37:18] someday
[1:37:22] and just stand there and watch for a few
[1:37:25] minutes
[1:37:26] go up to somebody randomly at work and
[1:37:28] ask them to take out kids you have any
[1:37:29] teenagers
[1:37:30] tell me about your teenagers and five
[1:37:33] minutes into the conversation you're
[1:37:34] going to be thanking god for the
[1:37:36] children you have
[1:37:38] so brother ben's teaching his
[1:37:40] congregation to change your attitude
[1:37:42] amen and start realizing that we've got
[1:37:45] the best kids on the planet
[1:37:47] they've been dedicated to the lord
[1:37:49] they'll sit and listen to preaching for
[1:37:50] two and three hours
[1:37:52] amen they'll come service after service
[1:37:53] they'll go to youth meetings not to play
[1:37:55] games but to hear preaching
[1:37:57] they got preaching on wednesday
[1:37:59] preaching on sunday and then they'll go
[1:38:01] on a friday two times a month to hear
[1:38:02] more preaching
[1:38:05] we've got the best kids in the whole
[1:38:06] world
[1:38:08] if they hit a struggle in their life for
[1:38:10] independence and they don't know
[1:38:12] they're a little frustrated and they
[1:38:13] don't know if they should be free to do
[1:38:14] this or not free to do that
[1:38:15] and they come into hey they're still the
[1:38:17] best kids in the whole world
[1:38:20] that didn't change anything and our
[1:38:23] attitude towards them is gonna it's
[1:38:26] going to change their attitude towards
[1:38:28] us
[1:38:30] fathers provoke not your children to
[1:38:32] wrath
[1:38:33] if you talk about them like they're the
[1:38:35] best and you treat them like they're the
[1:38:36] best
[1:38:39] what do you think is going to happen he
[1:38:42] goes on this quote and he says
[1:38:44] now your salvation will not save that
[1:38:46] child
[1:38:47] but now paul said believe in the lord
[1:38:49] jesus christ and thy and thy house shall
[1:38:51] be saved
[1:38:52] now what did he mean by that he didn't
[1:38:54] mean that because they
[1:38:56] they were saved that their house would
[1:38:57] be saved with it he meant this
[1:39:00] that because they had if he had enough
[1:39:02] faith to be saved himself
[1:39:04] his same amount of faith that he had for
[1:39:06] himself would work for his children
[1:39:09] by faith not hope faith
[1:39:12] see what i mean now i've got my children
[1:39:14] there's my little son joseph and billy
[1:39:16] sarah rebecca
[1:39:18] no no i want to see each one of them a
[1:39:20] worker in the gospel doing something
[1:39:22] i want to see them saved and filled with
[1:39:23] the holy ghost now i've committed them
[1:39:25] to god
[1:39:26] and say i'm holding on to god for them
[1:39:29] and i believe they're going to be saved
[1:39:31] every one of them see
[1:39:32] i believe they're going to be saved and
[1:39:34] i'll have them on the other side
[1:39:36] and i don't believe my salvation will
[1:39:38] save them no
[1:39:39] but my faith in god will do it
[1:39:42] you see my faith believing god will do
[1:39:45] it and will cause them to come to christ
[1:39:49] and i believe that's where you people
[1:39:51] praying for your children
[1:39:53] and that's the reason your children has
[1:39:54] the manners
[1:39:56] and the real lady and gentlemen in this
[1:39:58] wild age that we're living in
[1:40:00] yet they have the part about them that's
[1:40:02] the best i know of
[1:40:03] any kids see well i think the reason of
[1:40:06] that is because it's your prayers for
[1:40:08] them
[1:40:09] and you've committed them to god and
[1:40:11] holding on
[1:40:13] oh praise be to god why are they the
[1:40:16] best kids
[1:40:17] in the whole world because we've
[1:40:18] dedicated them to the lord
[1:40:20] we raise them in the nurture and
[1:40:22] admonition of the lord and we're holding
[1:40:24] on to god
[1:40:25] for the kids amen and we're believing
[1:40:27] that god's working with them
[1:40:28] and you can see god's working with them
[1:40:33] amen will they will they have a little
[1:40:36] frustration periods in their life
[1:40:38] maybe well they hit things that are an
[1:40:40] impasse that you just can't agree on and
[1:40:41] it creates difficulty
[1:40:42] probably but that doesn't change the
[1:40:45] fact that they're the best kids in the
[1:40:47] world
[1:40:49] deal with them you guys are the best
[1:40:50] kids in the world
[1:40:52] not just my five all of you
[1:40:57] why because you love the lord it's
[1:40:59] obvious because you want to serve him
[1:41:02] nobody's forced you to come up and sit
[1:41:04] on the front row you did that of your
[1:41:05] own choice
[1:41:06] nobody's forcing you to go to use me you
[1:41:07] do have your own choice nobody's forcing
[1:41:09] you to raise your hands
[1:41:10] and sing nobody's forcing you to open
[1:41:13] your mouth and sing praises to the lord
[1:41:14] nobody's forcing you to say amen to the
[1:41:16] word you're doing that of your own free
[1:41:18] choice
[1:41:20] why because you've been dedicated to the
[1:41:22] lord because you've got parents that are
[1:41:24] holding on for you
[1:41:25] amen and you're the best kids in the
[1:41:27] world
[1:41:29] how many believe they're the best kids
[1:41:30] in the world
[1:41:32] amen now let's treat them that way
[1:41:36] amen in the frustrations let's treat
[1:41:38] them like the best kids in the world
[1:41:39] when they have to be corrected you just
[1:41:41] corrected one of the best kids in the
[1:41:42] whole world
[1:41:44] when there has to be a punishment hey
[1:41:46] you've just punished one of the best
[1:41:47] kids in the whole world
[1:41:49] you see how it changes your whole mode
[1:41:52] of thinking
[1:41:53] they're not rebels they're not wild amen
[1:41:56] i would take the troubles that we have
[1:41:59] over anybody else's with their teenagers
[1:42:01] in the whole planet
[1:42:04] we may think we have a rough time you
[1:42:06] know brother bram said his becky was
[1:42:08] telling mrs wood
[1:42:09] you know i got real wild
[1:42:15] usually that's about as wild as it gets
[1:42:17] around here
[1:42:19] and if that's as wild as it gets i say
[1:42:21] thank god
[1:42:22] thank you lord jesus there's a different
[1:42:25] atmosphere there's something the word is
[1:42:27] doing there's something that commitment
[1:42:28] is doing
[1:42:29] when they're committed to god and
[1:42:30] parents are holding on for their kids it
[1:42:32] is
[1:42:32] making a difference don't lose faith in
[1:42:35] that
[1:42:35] in the midst of a conflict don't lose
[1:42:38] faith in everything we just talked about
[1:42:40] in the midst of a power struggle don't
[1:42:42] lose faith and confidence
[1:42:44] the same faith you have right now in
[1:42:46] them have it in the middle of a conflict
[1:42:49] and it'll change our attitude it'll
[1:42:52] change our approach
[1:42:53] it'll change everything
[1:42:56] like i said this isn't exhaustive we
[1:42:58] could say a lot more things about
[1:43:00] teenagers but this is the thing that god
[1:43:01] laid on my heart
[1:43:04] if you've got a teenage son or daughter
[1:43:06] that's here in the assembly with you
[1:43:09] worshiping god oh you should you should
[1:43:11] thank god
[1:43:12] every day
[1:43:15] if you've got a child amen and maybe
[1:43:17] they they've left and man they've gone
[1:43:19] to do their thing but you committed them
[1:43:20] to god and you're holding the god for
[1:43:21] them you thank god for them every day
[1:43:23] amen because it's your faith and
[1:43:25] commitment
[1:43:26] if they're ever going to come back it's
[1:43:27] your faith and holding on and commitment
[1:43:29] that's going to bring them back
[1:43:31] we've got to hold on with faith not
[1:43:33] through a lost cause there is no lost
[1:43:35] cause
[1:43:37] there is no hopeless situation there is
[1:43:39] no lost cause
[1:43:41] we've dedicated these children to the
[1:43:43] lord we've dedicated ourselves to the
[1:43:45] lord and we're holding on for them
[1:43:47] because they're the best kids because
[1:43:49] they're the kids that have been
[1:43:50] dedicated

[1:44:09] got to have faith got to believe
[1:44:13] god's going to do something when the
[1:44:15] devil takes all of our faith and
[1:44:17] robs us of even hope amen then nothing's
[1:44:19] happening but
[1:44:20] if god can come and fan the fames of
[1:44:22] flames of faith again
[1:44:24] amen and you can renew that faith you
[1:44:26] had the day you dedicated them to the
[1:44:27] lord
