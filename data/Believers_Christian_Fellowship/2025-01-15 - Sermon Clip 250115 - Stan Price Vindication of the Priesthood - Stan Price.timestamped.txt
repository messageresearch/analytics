[0:00] Adam and Eve had a place of fellowship
[0:02] with God but it wasn't in their
[0:04] Humanity it was in the theophany that
[0:06] dwelt in them right because their
[0:09] theophany was created in the image of
[0:11] God so that was the only part you know
[0:15] outside and the prophet says it Adam's
[0:17] flesh was
[0:19] animal So Adam Adam's fellowship with
[0:22] God was not based on his flesh it was
[0:25] based on the this harmonious part that
[0:29] God had put in that flesh which was the
[0:31] theophany that was made in His image
[0:34] right and so here is Adam and Eve in
[0:37] harmony with God yet they're in
[0:40] flesh all right so watch so said now
[0:43] that's the first thing that
[0:45] disfellowship this wonderful Union but
[0:47] now look Adam and Eve in a position to
[0:51] never
[0:52] die because that's that was a position
[0:54] they were in a position to never die in
[0:57] a position to never be old yeah amen
[1:01] right in a position to never be sick to
[1:04] never have a
[1:06] worry and you say I sure wish I could be
[1:09] like
[1:10] that well let me I got news for you you
[1:14] are in the same
[1:17] position Redemption has done a work that
[1:20] we don't even recognize and so what so
[1:23] what is happened here okay Christ has
[1:27] redeemed
[1:28] us but we we have not been made
[1:31] manifest we don't because I came onto
[1:34] this Earth and I have a gene of God in
[1:37] meise that Gene of God listen to this is
[1:42] already
[1:43] there sitting there but I don't know who
[1:46] I am right right right I come into this
[1:49] world ignorant right not knowing who I
[1:52] am but Watch What Happens okay so he
[1:54] says I I beheld and I looked and L verse
[1:58] 6 in the midst of the throne of the four
[2:00] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[2:02] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[2:04] seven Harps seven eyes which are the
[2:06] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[2:08] the Earth we could stop on this but
[2:10] we're not going to and he came and he
[2:13] took the
[2:14] book out of the hand of him that sat on
[2:17] the throne so
[2:19] this book The Lamb where did the lamb
[2:22] come from he came out of the throne amen
[2:26] am but he was not a separate person from
[2:28] the one that was sitting this is a
[2:30] parable it's a parable It's a drama that
[2:33] God is playing out because I want you to
[2:36] see that this is where you
[2:38] live the The Throne of God is in
[2:42] you and so what God is showing you is
[2:45] what Redemption did for you
[2:49] individually God and so the lamb what
[2:53] did he do he claimed
[2:56] you but you know what the prophet said
[2:59] I'm and I'm I'm fixing to show you what
[3:01] the prophet said he sat back down on the
[3:06] throne so what
[3:08] happened redemption's work had been
[3:12] accomplished because he opened he was
[3:15] the only one that could open this book
[3:17] that's right and so now he is in the
[3:21] throne yeah
[3:23] revealing Who You Are
