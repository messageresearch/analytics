ask you'd be glorified in all that's said and done and may our hearts rejoice in you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you while you're standing if we can take our Bibles and turn to Exodus chapter 3 just want to say God bless you it's good to have Brother Kyle back from Oregon amen and Trust all went well there and also I just got a picture from Vitali just about an hour ago they're back home they made it so appreciate you praying for them and we sure had a good time with them we're thankful that they were here also as you can tell it's a little warm in the sanctuary we had uh uh AP came out and changed our Transformer out yesterday and when they brought the power back on something's wrong with the air conditioners I don't know what it is amen so I think God just answered my wife's prayers because she's always cold in church so so I don't know if that was it or not but we need to start praying that it works amen but anyways we'll get that taken care of so the the deacons have opened the back doors and open the outside doors so we can try to get a little air in amen so if you go out or you take your children out just remember that all the doors are open amen so try to keep the noise down also we have a few visitors I want to welcome back after several years of brother Michael and Sister Mary and quinland from England God bless you it's good to have you here they were with us about four years ago and they intended to come right back then a nasty little thing called Co happened and changed everybody's plan so it's been four years so they'll be with us for about a month and so uh I encourage you to get to know them greet them they're staying with sister Joyce and so we'll have a good time with them also there's a family visiting from India God bless you they're here Sunday it's good to have you back they're here visiting their daughter but it's nice they've been streaming and they know who we are now we get a chance to see who they are God bless you and welcome amen let's stand while we're standing let's go ahead and read this scripture Exodus chapter 3 and I'm going to begin with verse one says now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called him to him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God Amen God bless you as you take your seats and may the Lord bless us as we read his word amen I've got a PowerPoint if we could bring up the PowerPoint uh brother Franco I want to minister on a subject called face to face and this is something that uh through meditation that's just opened up I don't know how or when the inspiration hit but it's been a little while now that I've been looking at this and I pray that God will give me the the ability to just rest and let him Minister as the inspiration come I always feel so guilty because the inspiration is always so good but the delivery is always so poor when you compare the two because God does something so deep inside of you when you try to put it in the language it just fails so we're not depending on language we're depending on the Holy Ghost Amen to come and be the Divine interpreter of his word and so I put together a PowerPoint because I want to lay a foundation in the scriptures and I want to go through a lot of scriptures so this helps me move more quickly than turning back and forth so you can jot down the scriptures as we go and I I'm not going to try to cram all this in I'm going to try to discipline myself and I don't want to go long been trying on Wednesdays not to go long I've been trying to be about an hour and I've been failing thus far but I've been trying and I intend to do that because I know everybody works we got to get up early school's back in session there's things that we are commissioned to do amen and it's also part of the plan of God that we work and go to school so we want to we want to be sensitive to that as well so you just pray for me that God will help me and so we can be concise but I'm going to lay a foundation I'm not going to cram it all in if we have to extend extend it to Sunday we'll just pick it up on Sunday Lord willing so we see now we know this passage really well here in the uh Book of Exodus when Moses is now out in the desert he's run from Egypt and and we know he's born to be a deliverer predestinated to be that deliverer and and now he's out in Egypt and God's going to get his attention and he sees a a bush that's consumed with fire or it's full of flame but not being consumed by the fire and God called his attention and he drew aside to see and we know that this is the pillar of fire it's the angel of the Lord that's in the bush and and he begins to draw nigh and God in verse four says when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses said here am I so now we know that the Lord is there we know it's the angel of the Lord but we know it's God we always we have to ask ourselves is it God or is it the angel of the Lord amen these are such such good questions we're going to ask as we move on and you'll find out why I'm doing that I'm not trying to bring any confusion but I want us to think deeper on these things because so many times we skim over things and we don't take the full depth of meaning and brother bandham said God condenses his truths in the Bible and he wants us to meditate on these things because God he he he takes his full Revelation and he and he compacts it into one book and then by then by the ministry of the word by the gift of a prophet by the five-fold ministry and the gift of the Holy Ghost and Revelation from God he begins to take that book and expand it into all kinds of places so we see now God begins to speak to him out of this bush we know there's a light in the Bush Moses knows it as a fire and and it's the pillar of fire in verse six he says moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God he knew there was God God was calling and saying I God I'm the god of thy fathers and Moses was afraid to see God now we're going to we're going to keep going here let's go over to Exodus chapter 33 no yeah turn to Exodus 33 and then I'm going to read this scripture out of Deuteronomy 34:9 I have it on the overhead here it says and Joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hand upon him and the children of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the Lord commanded Moses and there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face here God begins to speak to Moses and it's God himself speaking to Moses out of this bush amen and and Moses when he knew that was God speaking to him hid his face CU he was afraid to see God but now it says there was no prophet in Israel since in Israel like un Moses who whom the Lord knew face to face this is where I get my subject face to face and I want to know I I was questioning what does it mean to know face to face what does that term actually mean I want to know what it means I don't want to just use a term but I want to know what it means and so let's look now in Exodus 33:9 in Exodus 33:9 it says and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the people and the Lord talked with Moses so he went and God called him to the Tabernacle he went into the Tabernacle and the Lord began to talk to Moses in the Tabernacle and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp so I want to stop there I don't want to read any further but the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh to his friend that's an amazing relationship is an amazing relationship and now we know we're starting to see what this face to face means he speaks to Moses face to face as a man speaketh to his friend this isn't like a god G giving down decrees this is like a man conversing with his friend and now he's talking to him face to face and and so I this is Exodus 33 is the chapter that first formed this question for me what does it mean face to face cuz I thought I knew what it meant until I got a little deeper into this chapter so this is just what we just read the portion we just read and the Lord spake to Moses face to face this is the term I want to look at as a man speaketh to his friend but when we get a little further down just a short ways I'm sorry I I'm going to give you the definition of face to face this word face means face just like we would indicate face but it also means presence or person this is really important because because it could mean your literal face but it doesn't always mean your literal face it could mean your presence it could represent your person so let's look further down we stopped reading at 11 but now in verse 18 it says and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and I will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou can't not see my face for there shall no man see me and live this is where I first asked the question what does it mean when he said he talked to him face to face because just just seven verses later or uh not seven but just uh 10 nine verses later he says no man can see my face in live but yet he met him face to face he spoke to him face to face there was no Prophet like Moses since who the Lord spoke to face to face but here he says Thou cast not see Moses said show me my glory and he says no man can see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in a CLE Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen this is this is true throughout the scriptures that no man can see God and live and no man can see God's face so when Moses was talking God to God face to face amen it's not as though Moses could have described to you the shape of God's face uh did God have a nose did God what size were his ears amen because God is a spe Spirit God is invisible God can take on all kinds of forms to to show himself and to declare himself and become visible but God himself is the invisible God is that right so when Moses talks to God face to face amen now it's not as though Moses is seeing a face it means that Moses is personto person with God God is speaking to him on a personal level as a person speaking to a person as a man speaks to his friend because God says you cannot see my face and live and when I read this I'm thinking I've had this picture all wrong I I imagine Moses standing before God and God but then all of a sudden I got to this portion of scripture I said it's not what I think it is amen because God Moses may not have seen anything right he saw a pillar of fire amen and God was speaking to him out of a pillar of fire amen who I don't know exactly what Moses would have seen or how God how many different ways God would have represented presented himself to Moses but God said you can't see my face is that right so when he was talking to Moses it was something different than when I say I'm looking at your face when he was face to face with God God was facing off with Moses in a personal relationship and he was coming to him person to person so maybe we could take this as a as a as just a a cheap definition maybe just the some way of explaining it and instead of face to face we could understand person to person God spoke to Moses person to person the way a man speaks to his friend it says in numbers 789 and when Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking to him from off the mercy seat that was upon the Ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him now when we first went to Exodus 33 at the beginning of Exodus 33 when we were here let's go let's let's look it should still be open in your Bibles verse 8 and it came to pass when Moses went out into the Tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after Moses until he'd gone into the Tabernacle so he's going into the Tabernacle and it came to pass as Moses entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle now verse 11 and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend but here in number seven it gives a different description in number seven it says when Moses was gone into the Tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one Speaking unto him from off The Mercy Seat God was on The Mercy Seat between the wings of the cheram because that's where his throne was that's where he said he would abide amen and there was a veil over that I don't know if Moses went behind the veil or not I'm not sure but God was there between the wings of the cheram and Moses heard his voice from off The Mercy Seat so God was speaking to him from The Mercy Seat and and and God describes this as talking to Moses face to face amen then in Genesis 32 we're going to go to the story of Jacob now Jacob when he's coming back from laan his father he's entering into the promised land I'm jumping from one story to the next but I want to use these examples and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of day and so in Genesis 32 he comes and he goes over uh uh the brook and he leaves his family on one side and he meets a man and he wrestles with that man and we know later that he's going to call that man God but here he wrestles with a man but in Hosea Hosea calls this man an angel says he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with with God yeah he had power over the angel and prevailed so now depending on where you're on the scripture it's either a man or it's an angel amen it's God in a form amen it's a man or an angel come to speak to him and this is what Genesis 32:30 says and Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved Jacob says I have seen God and the Bible says he wrestled with a man and joah said he prevailed over the angel amen but but but Jacob said I have seen God face to face but God said no man can see my face I hope we're seeing the picture now God said nobody can see me and live no man can see my face even Moses who was his friend who he spoke to amen fa face to face he put his hand over him put him in the Cliff of the rock put his hand over him until he passed by and removed his hand to let him see the back part of him but wouldn't let him see his face yet Jacob said I saw him face to face what did Jacob see it was God in a form speaking back to him and he had interaction with him and he said I saw God face to face the thing is was it correct yes was it correct no it was correct amen he saw God face to face but it was not the the face of God that no man can see lest they die it was God representing himself as an angel who looked like a man who could wrestle with Jacob we got that John 1:18 it says no man has seen God at any time but I thought Jacob said he saw him is that right Jacob said I got I saw God face to face but John 1:18 says no man has seen God at any time and we know there's no discrepancy in the Bible there's no no discrepancy in the Bible God said no man can see my face in the Book of John it says no man has seen God at any time when Moses when Moses met the pillar of fire that was God in a form speaking back to him was it God it was God it was the invisible God who took on a form and in that form he spoke to Moses and Moses was so fearful he wouldn't even look up he hit his eyes so that he wouldn't see God but then later God says you can't see me it says no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him what was it was God in a form in 1 Timothy 6:16 it says who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power Everlasting amen amen no man has seen God at any time do we believe that's true but we also believe that God spoke to Moses face to face we let us true right but God said no no you Moses you can't see my face amen no man can see my face and live but yet Jacob said I saw God face to face we believe both of those are true right so that means you can meet God face to face amen and it could be a different form and what Jacob saw could be different than what Moses saw is that right but they still both met God face to face we believe that's true amen I mean see we sometimes we have to move beyond what we understand in the carnal world because the spirit world does not work like the carnal World we're so used to time matter and space I've said this before and so limited by our language and our language is developed to explain the world we live in and explain the bodies we live in and all of our language is here to explain this dimension that's right and we don't have enough language to explain the other dimension that's why we're always fumbling around trying to explain it and trying to find the right words cuz there's not right words in the language to explain that Dimension but God is constantly coming down and expressing himself in this Dimension amen and whenever he expresses himself amen all of a sudden we now find that that was an expression of God there's God and we grab a hold of that and that that's it that's God and only this can ever be God and just as soon as we do that God changes forms and comes another way and all of a sudden when we when we when we zero down on this now we refuse to say this is God I saw him here but that's not him no you saw him here you should see him here and when he moves to another you should see him here because that's God amen amen he's injecting himself into this Dimension but he is not bound by this Dimension he's not limited by this Dimension he exists outside of this Dimension and he injects himself into this dimension but he exists outside this Dimension praise God Amen and the unchangeable god brother B says and then Jacob all Disturbed and perplexed and in trouble set his wives across the Little Brook went back on the other side in an unexpected place and in an unexpected time he met God in an unexpected way what a way to meet God in a wrestling match but it was God regardless of whether he's in a burning bush or wrestling match it was God praise God so if it was God in a wrestling match then how could it be God in a burning bush because Moses couldn't wrestle with the bush wasn't in the form of a man God was in another form but it was the same God it was the same God who spoke to Jacob and blessed Jacob it was the same God who spoke to to Moses and instructed Moses it was God it was God but then when you think about it it was God but it wasn't God right it was God but the bush wasn't God it was a bush the pillar of fire is a way that God represents himself but God existed before the pillar of fire god was real before there was anything that declared him before there was even anything visible there was God so God exist beyond anything visible but he uses things visible and things tangible to begin to express himself and when God takes that form and expresses it that's God Amen because God's in it God's using it that makes it God but God can jump out of that into something else and now this is God so now we could find the bush you know maybe it's still living that that Moses that the pillar of fire entered into amen and we could go back and worship the bush but that's not going to do any good God was using that temporal where you know where is that man that angel that Jacob wrestled with amen that form amen the the forms even that God took on when God stepped down as Elohim took on flesh to come and speak to Abraham amen then brother brandham said he just grabbed the elements he blew it off of his hands they formed a body he stepped into it and that was God is that right that was God speaking to Mo God met Moses flesh to flesh amen but but yet when he was done those elements just went back to elements and disappeared and he went back to being the invisible God so was it God yes was it God see what I'm saying this is where language is so pathetic this is where human understanding is so foolish because we get hung up on was it or wasn't it it was this and then it was that how can it be this and that it can be this that that that and that and still all be God I I wish I had a better way explain that's the best I can do amen so brother bam said whether it was in a wrestling match or in a burning bush it was God regardless of whether it was in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was God I believe it amen praise God and God's provided approach he says God loves to fellowship with his creature in the Garden of Eden we are told that when man walked in and uprightness of God God come down in the cool of the evening and fellowshipped with his children amen so we believe this brother bham even dramatizes that God comes down in the cool of the evening to walk with his children in the cool of the evening and even says children have you enjoyed your day today did you enjoy my creation and brother B dramatizes all of this Force so we can see it amen and so I believe with all my heart God came down and fellowshipped with his children in the cool of the evening but when Adam had fallen and God came down in the cool of the evening for his daily Fellowship this is what it says in Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day they didn't hear footsteps it never says they saw a form but they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden what did Moses hear he heard God Amen what did he hear in the Tabernacle between the wings of the chair he heard God he met God when he met the voice of God what was it in the burning bush that declared that that was godone not that this is a fire not that it was in a bush but when out of the Bush and out of the fire God spoke amen and told him who he was then he knew it was God Amen amen so they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself I I'm going to confess to you I have no idea what form or representation they saw they could have seen a myriad of things they could have seen the similitude of a man they could have seen an his Angelic form they could have seen anything the Bible doesn't tell us that they saw anything but they heard one thing sure when God came down they heard when the presence of God was in the garden they heard his voice and they knew he was there by his voice is that clear in Genesis so I don't know if they saw a form him or didn't see a form if they saw a form I mean we can use our imaginations all day long and still just be as nowhere as we are right now amen but the reality is they knew his presence by his voice not by his image by his voice they knew his presence they knew God was in the garden by his voice this is so important Moses knew God was in the temple amen because he spoke to him out of the Tabernacle he knew he was in the bush because he spoke to him out of the midst of the fire amen and he gave him the word praise God remember when brother Brandon is on a mountain in Colorado and he's hunting and the storm comes and he knows it sudden death and the voice of the Lord tells him to go back into the storm and he goes back into the storm and he speaks through the storm and the storm Fades away and and all of a sudden the Sun comes out and brother B starts walking he's walking through Virgin Timber he a as a as a hybrid born uh redeemed Son of God has just spoken to Nature the same way Adam did the same way Jesus Christ did he just spoke to Nature and a nature obeyed his voice now he's work walking through Virgin Timber amen it's like he's going back into an Eden condition showing that all that Adam lost is being restored amen back into the hands of even Fallen redeemed man and so now he's walking amen he sees an image before him he sees his wife and but he sees his wife young not old he says then I looked at my hands and in every way he said my thoughts and everything I turned back young again he's coming to a needing condition but then what does God say to him he says why don't you walk with me amen why don't you walk with me God wanted to walk with the prophet just like he did in Eden everything that was lost in Eden was coming back in this snapshot so that we could see it and fellowship between God and man come back and he said why don't you walk with me he said oh I would love to and he went walking through that virgin Timber the animals wouldn't leave him they kept coming to him in every way it was like the restoration of Eden just for a brief moment of time so that we could see it that's my faith and my belief that we could see it amen demonstrated so we know the title deed book has been given back amen but then so so if everything was restored his youth was restored his wife was restored in virgin Timber speaking to Nature and then all of a sudden fellowship with God is restored I asked you what did he see what form was he in what image did he see brother B never says he saw anything he knew him by a voice amen he knew him by his presence the presence of God came back to fellowship with him he didn't see as far as we know he never told us he saw an image he heard a voice praise God I tell you what I've heard a voice I've Heard a Voice let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 5 together let's look at this example here Deuteronomy chapter 5 Moses in the book of Deuteronomy here he's rehearsing ing the Journey of The Exodus to them before he departs from the cross over and as he's rehearsing this he begins to explain what they've been through and the events that have happened and he comes to verse uh five here in chapter 5 verse 5 I'm sorry verse one I'm going to go to verse one first and he and he begins to explain to them what was happening and he goes back now he's going back to Mount Si and Moses called all Israel and said unto them here o Israel the St statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day that you may learn them and keep and do them and the Lord Our God made a covenant with us and horb the Lord made not this Covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount so here he's saying to all of Israel the Lord met you face to face now it's not just Moses in the Tabernacle of Moses at the bush now Moses is saying and on Mount Si amen when the when the mountain Shook and the earthquake and the pillar of fire came down and the cloud and thick Darkness was all about it he said then the Lord spoke to you face to face praise be to God I want to read that again verse four the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire and then there's parentheses parentheses uh uh I can't remember all the English terms but it's an injected thought so we can skip the parentheses and stay in the line of thought of the sentence the Lord talked with you face to face in the M Mount out of the midst of fire saying bottom verse 5 saying I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me and he goes from here all the way to the bottom of verse 21 and he speaks the Ten Commandments bang bang bang bang what we call the Ten Commandments all the way down and and and now Moses is saying when you came up to the Mount when you came out of Egypt amen and out of the midst of the fire God spoke to you face to face saying thou shall have no other gods before me amen Thou shalt not lie Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery what was he doing he was giving them the word out of from inside the thick Darkness Inside the Fire amen up on the mount they heard his voice he was giving them the word and he says he was speaking to you face to face did they see God they saw a they saw Darkness they saw fire they saw smoke like a burning furnace they felt the Earth shaking they heard a voice did they see God yes did they see God no because no man can see God and live but they saw a form that was in shrouding and God was behind the form but what they heard was the voice of God speaking to them face to face and and no goes all the way down to verse 21 giving the Ten Commandments verse 22 these words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick Darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me how did they meet God face to face when God gave them the word when they stood at the base of the mountain and God showed himself in Fire and smoke amen but inside this is what what Moses says here look listen I'm going to read it again these words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mouth out of the midst of fire of the cloud and out of the thick Darkness with a great voice amen he was behind it all speaking it was God speaking to them the word for their day giving them the Commandments amen the Covenant he's making with them and it was God speaking to them face to face and the great tragedy was that when God spoke to them that way they ran away they're supposed to come to him but they ran and stood a far off and asked Moses to go that was the tragedy that God would come speak to them face to face the way he spoke to his prophet and they would run away and send the prophet amen let's keep moving in Ezekiel 20:33 he says as I live sayith the Lord God surely with a mighty hand with a stretched out arm and with Fury poured out will I rule over you and I will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein you were scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with Fury poured out and I will bring you into the Wilderness of the people and there will I plead with you face to face like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt so will I plead with you sayeth the Lord he's speaking of a regathering of Israel I will reather you I will bring you from the Wilderness I will bring you back amen and I will bring you into the Wilderness of people and there will I plead with you face to face what will they see I think more importantly than what they see is what they hear I think that's really the question now I think that's what we're finding is the important part of meeting God face to face is the voice amen Deuteronomy 4 nine says only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy son's Sons especially the day that thou stood us before the Lord thy God and Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire into the midst of heaven with Darkness clouds and thick darkness and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire you heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude Only You Heard a Voice and he declared unto you his Covenant which he commanded you to perform form even Ten Commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone here's the same event the same thing only now he's saying you heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude this word similitude similitude is what it is similitude means form image or likeness representation or semblance you didn't see anything that looked like a person you didn't see anything amen that declared to you this person amen you saw the fire the smoke and the thick Darkness but you saw no similitude but Moses says later God spoke to you face to face face to face but you didn't see any similitude face to face is person to person God came down and spoke to them as a person praise God Hebrews chapter 1 God who at sunry times and in diverse manner spake in time pass un to the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he ha appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person we went through this a few weeks ago but I'm going to bring the definition up again of Express image of his person and I'm just going to read here the highlighted part the exact expression the image of any person or thing marked likeness precise reproduction in every respect what was Jesus Jesus was showing The World God yes he was God Amen what made him God because when God made a flesh body this was the only flesh body he made for him to dwell in fullness in and God the fullness of the godhead was bodily in Christ Jesus so he made Jesus a stamped replica an absolute likeness a a a perfect reflection of God and now he was there in the flesh reflecting God so this becomes the Flesh of God and God the spirit of God dwelt In the Flesh of God and then we could see God praise God but you know this similitude this exact expression image of it's more than just the facial structure it was also the character it was the life it was the nature it was everything all bundled in one Jesus Christ was showing God on the earth he was de claring God it was God showing himself in Jesus Christ in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them so now Jesus Christ Christ is the image of God Amen when you want to see God you have to see Jesus Christ when when when Philip I believe it was he said show us the father and it should suffice us and Jesus said have I been so long with you that you know me not when you see me you've seen the father amen they were standing before God face to face talking to God and they didn't even know it amen God was speaking through his son in Colossians 1:15 it says who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so what was Jesus Christ he was the image of the invisible God when God made his likeness on Earth he made the Flesh of Jesus Christ and stepped into it he's the image of the invisible God now we look at this 2 Corinthians 46 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ so how we know about the light of the knowledge of the glory of God you see in the face of Jesus Christ he's declaring the father this word face means face or person or presence or countenance amen so in the countenance or the person of Jesus Christ you see the glory of God Amen praise God we're moving along we're making good times so don't get nervous we're going quickly and the message is shamed he says but it's it's a reality to a man or a woman boy or girl who really is a genuine Christian when God made the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you received it there is something that settles within you and there is nothing takes its place when a man ever meets God not in some emotional workup some enthusiasm or some religious Doctrine some catechism or Creed or Dogma that he was accepted for a comfort for himself but when he really comes to a place like Moses did on the back side of the desert walk up face to face with almighty God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there is something it does to you now amen now we're going to find out that we can meet God face to face like Moses met God face to face like the children of Israel met God face to face like Jacob met God face to face we can meet God face to face do you believe the prophet met God face to face amen but I don't think God wants it to stop there the prophet's telling us that that that when a man like Moses did on the back side of the desert walk up Faith face to face with God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly what the word what should we be looking for when we come in contact with God face to face the voice that should be speaking should be matching the word and when you see exactly with the word and the promise of the hour then there's something that it does to you amen how did they recognize him in the Garden of Eden by a voice they recognize his presence by a voice amen he re Moses recognized when he spoke to him they recognized him in the fire Amen in the smoke when he spoke the Commandments praise God how are we going to come face to face with God are we going to wait until we see something going to wait till a future day or can we come face to face with God today in the book of Acts we speaking of this Apostle Paul when he yet saw on his way to Damascus says at midday oh King I saw on the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me and them which Journey with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted here here uh the Apostle Paul he's yet Saul now he's not been converted yet but here Paul amen he comes face to face with Jesus Christ but what does he see he doesn't see a similitude of a person he doesn't see the form of Jesus Christ he sees a bright light but the bright light spoke and what it was when he come face to face with Jesus Christ it was the voice coming from the light that declared who he was amen and then he said who are you he said I'm Jesus whom you persecuted Jesus had already lived Amen in the flesh he had already lived his life he been crucified amen he had been buried he had been resurrected and now Jesus had come back and entered into the Flesh of a many membered body and he was there because Saul was not persecuting amen Jesus In the Flesh that body with the nail scars he was persecuting the Church of the Living God and he says I am Jesus whom you persecute what did he see what form he saw a light amen and that light was Jesus was was the light Jesus amen but yet that light was in the church is that right so was the church Jesus Christ yes because it was the Tabernacle of Jesus Christ he was there when he persecuted the church he persecuted Jesus Christ amen they couldn't see any form they couldn't see the same Jesus that was crucified but it was the same Jesus that was crucified was now speaking to Paul and he recognized him by a voice brother B says look at Paul when Paul was a great Theologian but when he come face to face with the word what did he come face to face with when he come face to face with the word Jesus it quickened he came to life right quick because he was ordained to be that oh we have an opportunity to come face to face with the word who's the word praise God spoken words the original C he said I believe the Bible is the word the whole truth and Jesus is the word made manifest he and his word is one and the same I want to come face to face with God I want to come face to face with Jesus Christ but what form will I see what form am I looking for should I look for a light like Paul saw a light should I look for smoke and Fire on the Mountain what should I look for amen I should I should recognize him by a voice he says what are you going to do with him this Jesus called Christ Christ is the anointed word what are you going to do with it it's the message of the hour what is Christ what is Jesus Christ Christ is the word amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and then verse 14 says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen Jesus Christ was the word made flesh and brother benam said Christ is the anointed word and elsewhere he said he's the anointed word for your day yes amen what form are we looking for he can take on all kinds of forms and we know what form he's in in this day he's in the form of the Bride he's a many membered bride is where he's at but we're recognizing him not just by a form because anybody can say I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride any group anybody can say I'm bride they can take on a similitude so should I look to that no I should listen for a voice coming from behind that representation of God that manifestation of God should have a voice and the voice should declare the word for this day sir amen praise be to God this message brother brandham was a son of man revealing the son of man who is the son of man Jesus Christ so where was Jesus Christ amen he was in that son of man declaring himself amen is that right that's why people would be so mistaken by the manifestation they would begin to worship the flesh Tabernacle of brother bam assuming that he's Jesus Christ amen and I don't know if you remember do you remember Dawson Riley's testimony when when he begins to tell Dawson Riley amen did you hear what's going up with Canada they're baptizing people in my name does anybody remember that and and brother Dawson was thinking oh wow that's bad and brother brandom said they're not as far off as you think what a statement friends that was a form but God was behind the form but how did we recognize what did we hear when we came to this message we heard a voice amen the voice was back in the garden again and we recognized he was in our midst by a voice and that voice was speaking the word amen and it wasn't just the word for Luther's day the word for Wesley's day it was the word for our day amen we heard his voice and we can stand face to face with God again praise God brother man says in the message absolute Paul didn't always have the ti poost he used to be tied to the group of the Pharisees and he had had to be trained and educated so that they would accept him and let him tie himself to their post but one day he was on the road down to Damascus and he met Jesus face to face and from there he cut loose from the Fise TI poost and retied himself again that Jesus who he had knowed was crucified died and rose again Paul knew it because he met the person that changed him right there he was never the same for he was never the same from then on he never just met a book he never just met a Creed he met the person Jesus Christ when you know when we say the message is Christ I'm not talking about recorded messages I'm talking about the person of Jesus Christ that declared himself through recorded messages I'm not talking about printed books I'm not that's not what I'm talking about amen I'm not here to to worship a book I don't believe in just a book I believe in the one the book's talking about the one the book is unveiling to me this is the unveiling of God in this message God has unveiled himself so that we can Behold Him in all of his glory and meet him face to face amen why because he's had a voice in this day amen the voice of God Amen brother Brenham one time was preaching in 1951 and he says I am the voice of God to you is that right it wasn't these vocal cords amen it was the very thought of God that was being expressed God had come down and declared himself and he was recognized by a voice praise be to God brother brandham saw him on all kinds of forms brother bam saw a pillar of fire he saw a light that manifested to an angel he saw all kinds of things but he knew it was God speaking to him all the time it was gone and the message in absolute he says now today if we're trusting only an education or mechanical way of Education to explain the Bible then we've only got it from a mental conception but no man has the right behind the pulpit preach the gospel unless he has come face to face with it like Moses on the backside of the desert no matter how well he was educated whatever whatever had taken place his fears and frustrations left because he stood on a sacred ground with God that nobody could take it away from him and every man or woman that has an experience with God has met this same Pillar of Fire upon the sacred grounds of your heart there is no Theologian no devil no nothing Paul said nothing present nothing future death sickness sorrow can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus it's a tyst you know something happened no matter how much science raised up raises this that or the other you are tied you and God become one he's in you and you're in him why because through this message he's given a voice in this day and that voice is the voice of God just like at Mount Si and we've got an option we can run away from that voice or we can run to that voice and stand before God face to face you know the Apostle Paul was struck down by a light and that light had a voice behind it and that voice was Jesus Christ and he says who are you Lord amen he know he went back into the form of Pillar of Fire which he was before amen and he says I'm I'm Jesus whom you persecute but you know there was other men with Paul and those other men did not clearly understand what the voice said they heard something but they didn't hear a voice am mean they heard something but they saw no man they saw a light but then they didn't hear there's several different reports in the Bible what does it show it looks like a confusion maybe the story doesn't match what it shows amen is no matter how loud The Voice rings out only the elect will hear the voice and meet God face to face they were all there when the light shine but only Paul's the one who met Jesus Christ they were there when Jesus was declaring himself in a pillar of fire they were there when he was thundering out the word but only the elect predestinated met God face to face how many people sat in brother benham's meetings and how many heard the word preached and how many were there for the seals but only a few met God face to face how many listened to the text how many read the books how many said in the message Church how many hear the anointed preaching of the word but how many meet God face to face because we got to go beyond the image before our eyes and go past that and who's behind the image who's past the veil who's beyond all of that it's God back there declaring himself showing that I am present you can meet me face to face not a book not a tape not a greed not a new teaching amen but the person he's declaring himself by a voice and we can meet him face to face you can come to the same service and hear the same exact words and one person will have met God face to face and they would have their lives discerned and their questions answered and Direction and instruction and it' be almost prophetic and another person will sit there and I got nothing and I saw nothing and that man behind the pull Pit and the other person said I didn't even see the man behind the pull pit that was God speaking to me how can how can we walk out of the same service in somebody's mirac ously delivered and somebody's all tied up in knots because we got to look Beyond the Veil and listen for a voice we can meet God face to face amen praise be to God every man or woman that has had an experience with God that you and God in personal contact that means you've went beyond the church you went beyond the service you went beyond the tape you went beyond the vessels and you went beyond to the one that was behind all of that speaking Beyond you know when when they were there on Mount sin it was all thick darkness and clouds and fire and Light is that right and God speaking out of the midst of it and he was declaring his word and he says when you hear the trumpet sound long what's the long trumpet it was this Covenant it was these words when you hear that then come to me in the mountain and instead of coming they ran away why because what they saw frightened them what they heard they couldn't endure they couldn't go and we know it was all God's timing we know more the drama had to be played out we understand that but they said Moses you go and Moses could go beyond the mountain beyond the fire beyond the smoke into the thick Darkness where God was where was God he was behind it all he was in the midst of it all Moses could go into the darkness up into the mount into the scary quaky everything that made him tremble trembling Quake but where was God God was speaking out of the midst of it and Moses was able to go there amen I say God help me to see you face to face and go beyond all the voices and everything that you're sharing and showing and all the ways in which you declare yourself but help me to keep going until I come in contact with you like Moses did don't want to be like the children of Israel I want to go myself into the thick Darkness where God is I want to know him be known by him 1 Corinthians 13:9 says for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face when is then that's a good question when is then well if you go to verse 10 you'll see the word when then relates to when if I was an English teacher I would tell you what all this means what kind of words these are and all of that but then relates to win when will this be when that which is perfect has come then that which is inart shall be done away brother brandham goes to the scripture and he reads the scripture and says but what we do have now by the grace of God is the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen and the perfect word is not the perfect word listen this is why we have so much trouble sometimes in the message because the a perfect word is not a perfect teaching amen and like brother bam perfectly laid it all out no he he does it the way he can he says it this way one time and this example another time and it's all jumbled up and it'll start explaining it'll jump off on stories and it'll switch subjects and it'll come back to it that's not what he means by the perfect word it's not laid out perfectly it's the perfect understanding it's God it's the unveiling of God it's the mystery of God now complete and unveiled before us hallelujah the mystery of God should be finished in the voice of the seventh Angels amen what was those seals what was the preaching of the seals revealing Christ because Christ is those seals that was revealed so what is the revealing of the seals amen more Doctrine more perfect it's a perfect word the perfect word is a person he is the person of the word and he's standing behind a prophet unveiling himself face to face with with those who will receive it amen for now we see through a glass Darkly I love this but then then relates to when when is when that which is perfect has come do you believe we received a perfect word do you believe it's Christ himself that opened the seals he himself who took the veil off the word he himself who taught brother bandam comes to the end of the seals he says now don't say thank you to any man don't tell me any preacher anybody don't say thank you it wasn't a pre it wasn't a man what's he doing brother B doesn't say this about any other message he preaches you notice that he comes to the end of the seals because he wants you to know he did not preach those seals amen he would have got them all wrong if an angel of the Lord hadn't showed up every day and told him exactly why cuz only the lamb can open the seals and loose the seals he's got he's got to let you know I didn't do this there was something behind me I was the vessel he was standing behind amen but it was Christ himself the lamb that took the book and loosed the seals so don't say thank you to any man amen don't think it's a preacher or some man no man this was not the works of William brandom this was the works of Jesus Christ this is not the Revelation coming through William it's coming through William brandom but not through his mind amen his mind was wrong it came direct from God to the man he would see it in vision and have to take up a pen and write it down what was he writing down Jesus Christ revealing himself through the seals what is the opening of the seals revealing Christ Christ is the seals that was revealed oh if we could go beyond the text you'll find the person we have a perfect word it's not so you can go to a textbook somewhere and say this subject this answer no it's a perfect word Jesus Christ the word came and revealed himself completely and everybody can hear it but not everybody can see it everybody can hear it but not everybody can receive it that's why Jesus said to his disciples when they asked him about you know John the Baptist and Elias they have these questions Jesus did not say this is Elias who should have come he didn't say that he said if you can receive it if you can receive it this is Elijah that's right if you can't receive it then it's not Elijah who is this you understand it has to come by Revelation and that's only to a predestin at group even Jesus himself was not forcing the Revelation upon anybody he knew it was but he said if you can receive it this is who that was if you can receive it praise God for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face we're wrapping up this word glass is the word Mirror Mirror when you look into a mirror what do you see when you look into a mirror do you see somebody else or do you see your own image looking back what do you see when you look into a mirror that's what this word glass means in the Greek it means mirror but now we're seeing through a mirror Darkly but then face to face now now we know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known when that which is perfect has come I'll be able to pick up the mirror of this word and I'll say where is God hiding in this day where is the veil that he's speaking behind where is the final voice to the final age what voice is that it's the voice of God where is it the voice is in the bride so if I want to know where the voice of God is calling out from in the end time his voice is in his bride and she will be the final voice to the final age and when that which is perfect has come there'll be a cleaning agent that comes on the mirror amen cuz now we see through glass Darkly but when that which is perfect has come there'll be a clean cleaning agent that will clear all the smudge away until you can look at the word and you can do like that little boy in his aunt's house and say it's me mama that's me oh God it's me that he's talking about I understand the mystery now I know what's been hidden in the back part of God's mind all of this time now I know where God wants to dwell he wants to dwell in me talking about meeting him face to face where will you Mee him face to face in your soul in you is where that meeting place is where will you have your experience of God you'll experience God in your heart in your soul that's the meeting place where you meet God you got to go beyond the darkness of Flesh beyond the darkness of your mind and get down to where God is hiding in your soul and that's where he wants to see you face to face when will we see face to face when that which is perfect has come this is the last scripture I want to read psalms 278 when thou says seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when David writes this Psalm and When God says when thou sayest seeky my face do you think God is telling uh David come find my actual physical face so you can know what size my noses so you could draw it out no seek my person seek me seek after me to come to me in a personal relationship seek ye my face because no man can see his face is that what God told Moses so why would he say no man can see my face until David to seek my face it's not that kind of face he wants you to seek him him come face to face means is very personal not from a distance not from far away not through another you know not through a a telephone not through a messenger but seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek let's all stand brother Ben if you and the musicians can make your way up I barely went over an hour thank God when the Lord said seek my face you know the the Lord wants to be sought after the Bible says seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be God wants to be sought after he's not a cheap date that should be sought cheaply when it was scary in Sinai they ran away but when it was scary in sin Moses went with seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open he said you'll seek after me and you shall find me when you search for me with all your heart God wants to be found he wants to be sought he wants to meet us face to face amen but he wants us to seek his face seek his person seek his presence seek him he doesn't want us to seek a group he doesn't want us to seek a Doctrine he doesn't want us to seek a teaching he wants us to seek Him we've got to push beyond all the ways in which he expresses himself to find him what is he he's the invisible God how's he expressing himself now in Bride form I believe that but he is behind the bride form it's him it's him I want I want to go to the invisible part that's deep inside shrouded in darkness sure but that's where he dwells and I want to come make a personal contact with him when you said seeking my face my heart said not my brain my heart said your face will I seek and I want to seek it with all of my heart for if I seek it with all of my heart heart he'll be found why because he spoke in our day he's present he's made his presence known by his voice and he can be found let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus God it would have been impossible impossible for us to find our way to you God you asked us to seek you but you showed us where you you are you told us where you are you came in this generation and you declared Yourself by your voice like you did in the Garden of Eden like you did to the prophet in Colorado you've done it again in our day God I want to seek you face to face Lord I want to know you I want to know you Lord on a personal level not through a group I want to go beyond the group through a church I want to go beyond the church not just through a Doctrine I want to go beyond the doctrine and I want to find who the doctrine speaking of Lord the revelation of the seals was hiding you the mystery that was locked up in your mind has been unveiled and you've made a way that we can come to you God I want to seek after you with all my heart and find you lord lord I want I want to meet you face to face I want that experience Lord with you again and again and again as I commune with you Lord God if there's anyone here who hasn't had that experience Lord where they've met you personally where something in them is quickened something's changed they they know they've gone beyond tradition they've gone beyond anything else that it's
