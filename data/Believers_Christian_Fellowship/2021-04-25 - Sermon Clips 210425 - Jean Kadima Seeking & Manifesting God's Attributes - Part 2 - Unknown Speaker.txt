TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when the son of man cometh will he find faith that's what the most important what faith now we know is the fate of god and that's what matters because you will see as we reading that everyone had a doctrine and jesus when he came he was not he was not like what is your doctrine are you a what if i say this in it never ask that is the problem is to recognize him recognize when he comes so today let me just say if you recognize him in the formation of his bride and you start manifesting his attribute there will be no fight about doctrines amen there will be no fight because he's going to adjust that fight he's going to adjust that doctrine i mean yeah you will tell me oh no brother when the squeeze comes and then we will have the same doctrine because brethren say that yeah in some way but you can be squeezed only if you are squeezable you gotta be in that fight you gotta be in the body to be squeezed out is that right yeah so therefore i this is the end of the dying world the end of the seals the end of the ages the end of everything a rocket has been blown out and a rocket opened another rocket and another rocket than that and there is the ushering of the millennium where are the doctrines it's the end we used to have we used to have we we used to but we come to the end now we gotta recognize him if you recognize him that he came and he is in the body that i have to manifest him i'm telling you there'll be no doctrines
