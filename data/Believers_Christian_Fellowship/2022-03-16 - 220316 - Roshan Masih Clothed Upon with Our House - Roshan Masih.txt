praise god for everything so thank you for praying for us and the ministry we are doing in india so may the lord bless you for the prayers so tonight i would like to read from the book of revelation chapter 6. verse 9 to 11. revelation chapter 6 9 to 11. and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true do us to thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was certain to them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled may the lord have his blessings you may be seated please so we thank the message of the hour sending us a prophet and our understandings has been cleared and we do not think according to the denominational way but we have the revelation and said pray for the revelation and we know that revelation is a prevailing power so god has given us in this day the prevailing power through the opening of the world so we are most privileged people on the earth we have the full understanding of the word of god and god revealed the mysteries to him and we know that he preached on the seals and we know that this portion of scripture we have read talks about the jewish youth people and tonight i will like to preach on uh the like we have read here that they are the souls under the altar but they are crying for revenge and then the lord said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season and lord said to them wait for the little season until they until that time god provided them white robes so my subject is clothed upon with our house and we see that when he opened the fifth seal uh there are souls under the altar john saw them and the souls these souls are of them that were slain for the word of god and they held the testimony they lived and they stood faithful and they given their life for the world they held they believed and we know that they were killed slain and the bible say they cried with the lord voice saying how long o lord holy and true doers do not judge and awains our blood on them that dwell on the earth so they were killed they were slain and now they are in another dimension and they are asking for awareness and asking the lord and we know that their bodies were destroyed because they were slain and some were gassed in the gas chambers some were burned to death some were short some were cremated in the oven some were slain in the holocaust some were persecuted and hunted down we know that they all are jews brother branham said and they were killed by different different ways and now they are in another dimension and their bodies are killed and they are gone to another place and even they are there but they want leaving and asking the lord they remember how they were killed because when we die we do not forget anything they still remember and though they are believer [Music] and they believe the word of god and they had a testimony that they helped too still they are full of anger they are still full of revenge and asking the lord to even they are crying praying asking the lord to revenge because we were killed slain but lord said wait they went into the other life still remembering it and crying out but ranam said when you die you do not forget anything you are still conscious but ranam said when the souls our souls are not kind of sleeping there they are conscious they know everything when we die we are here and that dimension is right here not somewhere else right here so we are just go other side and the people are like this maybe few seconds we don't know if and we see the same different world same kind of people there and we remember everything we know in the bible about largest and that rich man they both died and went beyond the curtain and that rich man knows everything he remember and he said lord send someone send a large rest and i have five brothers and let someone go and preach that they may not come in this tormented place so he remember everything so these souls under the altar they remember how they were killed what happened to them and they are asking for revenge and the bible says 11 words and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled amen so white robes were given unto them they were just souls and crying until the altar and then lord provided given to them white robes and when they received the white robes god said rest for a while and wait so i'm going to read few scripture about the white robe from the bible what is rule matthew 17 2 mount of transfiguration and if you will search you will find many quotes has spoken about it and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light so his robe his raymond was white as the light mark 9 3 mark 9 3 and the his raymond becomes shining exceeding white as snow so as no filler on earth can white them so that was not his dress his clothes he was wearing because the bible says his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow and revelation 3 5 revelation 3 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raymond and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels one scripture revelation 3 17 18 because thousands i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knows not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i consell thee to buy of me ghoul fried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raymond that thou must be clothed and that the shame of the nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see one more scripture maybe two revelation 4 4 and round about the throne were 4 and 20 seeds and upon the seeds i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold revelation 7 9 after this i beheld beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the land clothed with white robes and palms in their hands so these are some scriptures tells us about the white robe and i would like to read another scripture from the book of 2nd corinthians chapter 5 then we will move further paul is writing in this great teaching here because he had two gone beyond the curtain and he met people there and he talked with them and he heard many things and he did not tell to anyone 14 years he kept silence and after 14 years one day he told that i know one man who was caught up in heaven many times some experience supernatural happened to us and we are so quick to tell others there are some some supernatural that must be between us and god many things brother branham never told something should be in us and god we should not disclose everything so paul never told to anyone 14 years and when he told even he did not disclose everything he just said he went there and he went went there and he met people and he saw them and then he started to disclose wrote things about them little by little so paul is writing in this great teaching here because he had gone there and he saw celestial's bodies there and how he is writing concerning these things ii corinthians 5 1 4 we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens amen he said we know we know that he is certain amen he is not guessing this is not any kind of hoping or guessing or just imagination but he is very certain about this he says we know this we are not assuming this we are not supposing this this is not a theory because the one talking here he experienced this he was caught up in that dimension in that place and he saw the house there he saw the tabernacle there he saw the heavenly celestial's body there so he said we don't hope it not hoping that maybe it could be right or wrong but he know exactly he went in that land he saw these things he says we know this if this earthly house talking about our body this body physical body this is a house and we are wearing this house i am wearing this for 49 years and it's getting old and he said we are we know that if this tabernacle this house is dissolved this past horse vrabranam said this pastors pastors is all kind of diseases and sickness full with all kind of this and infirmities and all that so born of a woman this past horse full of trouble few days if it dissolve we have a building say a building of god and house not made with hands no temple but eternal house and there is one form of eternal brother and sister and that's god's own life amen this is not temporal not temporary but this is eternal that means having no beginning and no end eternal in the heavens not in the grave somewhere but ranam said if somebody tells you that i'm died said don't believe. amen because christian don't die he said don't believe that i'm dead i am somewhere other side in another dimension so that house is an eternal house amen and that house is in heaven when we die we are we are we goes in our body there amen so poor in this house we groan second verse earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven amen so paul says we know that it is certain and he knows because he went there and he says when this earthly dissolve fell die we have another and that another house is an eternal horse amen and that house he said we are growing groaning we are groaning earnestly and necessarily desiring to be clothed upon with our house in this age of the rapture are you earnestly desiring to put upon your house which is heavenly when seven angels descended and all the mysteries the seals being opened and the word has been given to the bride are you and nestle desiring to go there are you endnessly desiring to change your body and dwell in that horse amen when you see all these earthquakes tsunamis volcanoes floods krona ukraine russia conflict all that are you earnestly desiring to put upon that house this is an age where we are on the walls of the eternity one of these days we are going this world is going to be perished finished and we are not identifying ourselves with the world amen we are identifying ourselves with the message the gospel jesus christ who revealed himself amen so we see that when the seventh seal is open when the book is open the word is given to us amen the holy ghost is loose upon the church that he may take the hardship that we may be led by the holy spirit do not follow men so when god has given us all the material which we needed for our journey and to get there are you and nestle desiring to be clothed upon with your house are you necessary desiring to be clothed upon with your house those souls were under expectation they were asking the lord for that event but the ropes were provided to them house were provided to them and three words if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked so here in we wear something and when we do not where we pond naked we are naked watch the language here clothed and naked said if we are not clothed we will be found naked naked and clothed is there any nakedness and clothing in the spiritual world paul says if we will not be clothed we will be naked and clothed with what with an house with the house we are going to wear house and jesus said i am going to prepare a place a house a mansion for you in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you amen so if you are not clothed with that house and you have no house to be clothed upon with you will be found naked so then we must make sure that we have the house there otherwise we will go and there is no house to wear no house to put upon and we will be naked there and paul says we will be you will be pond naked if you don't have that house clothing is connected to glory and honor and nakedness is connected to shame and embarrassment why would we want to be clothed so that we shall not be found naked and when we are naked it is shame embarrassment but when we are clothed it's an honor amen in other words we die here and we go other side and we have not a house there to wear and we are naked there we are just a soul because there were souls under the earth they were just soul and we will be souls only naked there because there is no house let me read branham's message mean i mean to say good i mean to say before i read quote our time is finished on earth and we die and lose this first body and then we go other side and we have not another body other side then we are naked there bubranam said the message is the countdown 62. then i think the fifth dimension is where the sinner goes when dies now i think that when the sinner dies he goes to this dimension notice the first thing he cannot go in the presence of god because he is a sinner and his time is up on earth he did not repent he's not covered with the blood and he died as a sinner when he died as a sinner he his days are over finished and now he goes there other side he cannot go in the presence of god because he's not covered with the blood he's not a repentant person and his time is up on earth if i would type it for you it is like trying to go to sleep and you are in a you cannot be asleep and you are in a nightmare hide your things you are screaming you are just that is the state of the wicked dead life he cannot go in the presence of god because he is a sinner he cannot return back to the earth because his time is up and he is caught between the two things in the fifth dimension he has got a soul and he cannot go in the presence of god because it is not covered by the blood he is a sinner he cannot wake himself up because his times is up on earth so that's why anyone who die they sell is so rest in peace they pray for little prayer all the time anybody in any religion if somebody die they want to pray for his soul may he so rest in peace but there is no rest for the wicked the bible says the rest is only for the righteous for them who are covered with the blood super brahnam says because his time is up on the earth and he cannot go in the presence of god cannot come back cannot go further he is between like we are between uh we are not asleep we are in a nightmare tormentation crying weeping scared this kind of situation is when sinner died the wicked so there he is in a tormented nightmare babran and when a synonym is caught with his soul between earth and hell in a nightmare there he stands see how miserable is this to die without jesus without the salvation without the covering of the blood it's very means painful or cannot bear but paul here second corinthians 5 is talking about different conditions that what we have read under the fifth seal there they were just souls under the altar they were crying for evans and they were not clothed and then god given them white robes but this is second corinthians 5 verse 4 i'm going to read for we that are in the tabernacle to groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed so he says we are here redeemed people and we wanted to go there want to close that house we are burdened about this amen we are burdened we want to go there and we are earnestly desiring because in this age in this day there is someone who did not come from seminary who did not bring us any theory any doctrine but he himself went beyond the curtain of time and he saw the people there he saw the body he met them hug them and he shook hand with them and he came back with the evidence with the substance amen and told us that there are bodies there are people amen amen so we received a prophet in this age and he experienced the things he entered into that body amen he entered into that body who said i was young again and when he entered into that body he can look back and he can see his another body lying on the bed next to his wife with the clothes he was wearing like when jesus rose from the dead his clothes were there in the tomb there like moses he was clothed with the glory when he came from the presence of god stephen when he died [Music] they saw him like an angel white glorified amen so we see that he said i was young again who looked back over here and said there is my body laying next to my wife and he saw his wife there also he said sharon was there [Music] he met people there he talked with them we know we have read all this young in a body that did not come by natural birth in a body that could not get sick he was in a body that could not get old and he was a witness of that word and he came with their true testimony who crossed over that land and and came with an evidence and a priest who is this milk is that he started to tell us about these things we have another body there are angel amen our angels are beholding the father's face this kind of things amen brothers and sisters in that body we will never grow old no sickness can touch that body now our eyes are getting dim pain and aching and cholesterol and heart attack and different things but we have another body there amen and prabranam came back with the substance and began to teach us and you have one waiting if you are a christian you say you have a body if you are in christ and this mortal a man will we are that immortal paul says first corinthians 15 50 to 54 let me read this then we will go further now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither do corruption inherit incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all asleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last room for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on encryption and this mortal must put on immortality must wear that immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought that shall be brought to pass the same that is written death is followed up in victory amen because for we that are in this tabernacle to grow on being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon he was in the first churches and he saw the future but we are in the seventh in the last churches amen how much more we should be burdened to be clothed upon when seven angels has come when all the mysteries have been revealed when the full word is restored back how much we should be burdened and how ernestly we should desire to go there when we see everything is coming to pass all scripture is uh fulfilling before us modern events are clear by prophecy and now we see all the events and those events are already being told to us in the message how much we should burden to go there and earnestly desiring because the bible says when it happens jesus said luke 17 lift up your eyes because your redemption drought night amen because the message of the seven seal is given to us to give us faith to be chased to go there to get in the rapture to go in that body that mortality might be swallowed up of life poor description must put on encryption and this mortal must put on immortality the holy spirit is released to claim you for glorification to get us back in that perfect place bubranam said when a person a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in christ and then when this rover flesh is dropped there is a theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to when we are born again we have a body but if we are not born again if we are not covered by the blood of the lamb then we will be in terrible condition shame nakedness embarrassment so we must make sure that we are under the token we are under the blood and our sins are covered washed away a man with the blood of the lamb lamb's blood amen so let me show you later how man became naked because the bible says there will be shame embarrassment if you will be found naked and when our bible opens in the book of genesis we see that whatever god created it was good and when he created a man he said it's very good everything was running in continuity days nights sun [Music] rising birds singing everything was beautiful god had perfect union with his family every evening he comes like you in the evening comes back from your work or job sit with your family and talk and you have nice fellowship so everything was going on in continuity but one day one anointed preacher came with a false doctrine but he took the same subject because ranam said satan always stay on the same subject that's how he deceived he was an anointed cherubim that united preacher started to preach and we know that eve heard his preaching uh satan's the devil the serpent and then the bible says in one cool evening evening time when god came down he saw his church deceived naked with a false doctrine that's why as the message is given to us we should believe we should not mix or inject our own understanding this message is simple but the people have made it so complicated this message is very simple but branham said this message we will go and find the left this is no any complication there no anything which we cannot understand this message will go and get the people will catch the people because when jesus came in the whole bible new testament nobody came to him he himself went everywhere he went to the shore of glilly he phoned some fishermen he went to uh in the house of matthew all and even he said i have chosen you you did not choose me so the same son of man same jesus christ he never changed his pattern so this message has come to bring us back to the original world and said come back to the bible but we are not we are me not all some people are trying to make this message a doctrine they take little we have to take everything that is given to us so i sometime i wondered and surprised some people say i prefer the books after 63 but was born under a sign he was born a prophet he was a prophet from the beginning and the revelation is always progressive revelation it always goes in progression amen so we see that people take the same things and twist them and deceive the people and the first church when god came in the evening time he saw his church in deception deceived by a preacher who preached but he twist the word he dislocate the word he added something little bit one word not big sentence we we must be careful because one word the bible says warn us even one word cannot be add or one word cannot be taken [Music] there was a deceived church that had been deceived deceived by a false united one deceived by the preaching of something and they were that preaching that doctrine robert them rob them and steal something steal that post doctrine which is dangerous all the time robbed them robbed their glory robbed their robe [Music] and they became naked and they found that they are naked and then they try to cover themselves with the pig leaves and try to make their own big leap religion said because listen means covering so now they wanted to cover themselves with their own religion with their own some efforts sweet fellowship was broken that came in with the false teaching with something added into the world and god and his family broken and taught us that he lost the title deal he lost dominion over the earth adam and he lost eternal life he lost fellowship with god the church lost its glory because of some false preacher and church became naked and now the church is trying to cover himself with some man or pig leaves they manufactured a covering to cover their own selves but when when god descended in the cool of the evening a man he ripped he snatched that quickly covering and throw it away showing that man-made theory or reason would not work hallelujah he ripped that big leaf off of them what god did he slew a lamb [Music] amen he threw a lamb and he brought an atonement and he clothed them with lamb's skin he covered their nakedness with lamb's skin lamb was killed to take away their nakedness man made things religion cannot cover our nakedness old nomination all there so god took away their man-made covering and they were provided with a robe lamb was killed babranam stepped under the tree of life god had the lamb slain covered i'm quoting prabranam fellowship by redemption message god had the lamb slain covered adam and eve with the skin and shed the blood a way back to fellowship again with god so that fellowship that covering came by the skin of the lamb amen and god covered them with that skin the lamb's skin and their sins were covered because the bible says there is no remission of sins without the blood that's why we need cross all the blessings brother branham said all the blessings are in the tournament [Music] we must have cross in our life it is sad to see that many many churches who claim they believe the message they have removed the cross from their life they think that if they will believe this they can get in the rapture if they will believe this that's how we are divided separated in many groups but gross the atonement is the only a man think because there is no remission of sins without the blood the bible says for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ amen so when we believe in christ when we believe the cross that day on california but brahmana prays amen so then we put on christ when we baptized in the name of the jesus christ then we are in christ i was reading this morning somebody sent me quote says when you go to pray before the throne of god god do not see you he sees jesus and when you are praying you are not praying but jesus is praying in you the holy spirit amen so we should be thankful for all this provision and all the arrangement and program of god so we see that how church became naked with some thing added into the world and said you never do these three things do not add do not misinterpret it and now come let's come to our age in this eighth when in the laudician god sent us a prophet in the evening time when he came in the evening time he saw church deceived amen with the man made big leaves curies doctrine durham nationalism and he found a church deceived wife by the world in the evening time i have a scripture here revelation chapter three about our age laudishan which but the people say they are came and he ripped that thick leaf pig leaves that fig leaf reason denominational things because they are in lukewarm condition neither hot or cold but they says i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing but god says knows not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now vision is naked and insane if somebody knows that he's naked then we can help him or somebody can help him but the bible says they know it doubt that they are naked because they are insane insanity so brother branham when he came he saw the deceived church deceived by the different different kinds of interpretation different kinds of things added and taken from the word of god then like eliezer he went out at evening time to get a bride that's what he said i was preaching healing great successful meetings he said something i was missing and we know that how god told him that all these big healing services everything and told to him that your ministry is to get the bride so then the evening time he went like eliza to find a bride a character and we read that 24 genesis 53 and the sermon brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raymond and gave them to rebecca amen so that is the ministry of the seventh angel eliezer he was like elijah he was like eliza he was like john the baptist and he said you cannot beat your type it is in the bible so his ministry was to provided us a robe because we were naked this age is naked and we know that we are not in laodicean condition praise the lord so this message has brought us out of that condition we are not wretched we are not miserable we are not naked we are covered with the word of the hour because his ministry was to restore the world bring us back to the world that word and us become one that's what he did he started his ministry and and he was providing a robe covering us let me read in his own word he restored the lamb he also the word of god and he says the message is present stage of my ministry i hope he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the world and dress his bride in the clothes of the world and for his righteousness amen so what is harm's ministry he is talking about his ministry and the message title is present stage of my ministry and it says this is my ministry that god let me take the clothes of the world and dress his bride in the clothes of the world and even he said it is god's requirement of the hour the evening time message is to apply the token token is the holy spirit and the holy spirit was born with the dogmas and creed and opinions but when true word came a restore back our understanding is clear and we are not under any man's hardship because our handshake is jesus christ the seventh seal amen and we do not follow man when the world is restored to us that we may become one with the word so that's god's requirement and that is the ministry of brother bran because i have i'm going to read couple of quotes i hope you will enjoy them holy spirit was born loosed by the message the revelation opening of the world that he may take hardship and preeminence in us that we may not work in man's opinion but must led by the holy spirit but ibrahim said eliza and elisha message so the baptism of the holy spirit was upon christ when he was taken up on the day of pentecost 120 people went in the upper room up there with their eyes straight towards the heaven watching and when he threw that robe of the holy ghost back down there she picked up a double portion out of the spirit of god so when we are talking about the rope when we say that dominationalism and all those false teaching doctrines made the church naked and then a ministry came to provide the rope amen and that robe he said is the holy ghost amen he said that is the requirement the holy spirit because when we receive the holy spirit that is god jesus christ in us doing his own work with his own way law law or grace but to make every man look the same he has to have the same kind of robe on the poor does that the rich hand now when god gives a poor man the holy ghost it is the same holy ghost he gives the rich man so babranam says the holy ghost is the robe for the poor and for the rich both looks the same you would not have to tell you what that means the holy ghost of course to cover with his own robe the waters of separation another now god made a robe also to cover that is the blood of jesus christ by the holy ghost the rube gods provided way she laid at boa's feet ruth and when he woke and seen the confidence my one of these days he will see the confidence that his church has got in him when he seen the confidence he taken his own rope holy spirit spread it over her it was getting cool and he spread his robe over her and sent her on her road and so did the people on the day of pentacles the new church when they went out there was not ashamed and stood under there waiting for 10 days according to his word christ spread his robe the holy ghost over the church to protect her and warm her to keep your heart right warmed up in fellowship until the full time of redemption amen so this message the holy ghost the word restored back is the road for this day and we are waiting for the rapture and what is the rapture to get in another body the horse up there and we cannot go there without the rope because the prophet says it is the requirement of the hour this is a requirement to go in the wedding supper we must have that robe we must need that white rayman to go in the wedding supper because the bible says revelation 19 7 8 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be read in fine linen clean and white for the final linen is the righteousness of sins and that righteousness is the baptism of the holy ghost we are in christ and christ in us god's provided way brother you are going to find yourself the same way every man that comes by the door is going to get the same rope and that rope is the baptism of the holy ghost every man pays the same price amen jesus is the door and when we go entered entered by that door he is there to provide the robe and without that robe nobody can go there because we read in the bible in the book of matthew 22 there was a man and he was there in the wedding somehow he came but branham said maybe through window or something and the question was asked to him friend how came thou in either not having it wedding garment and the bible says he was speechless no answer nothing to say if we go with other robot it is terrible it is shame and we thank the lord for the ministry that ministry brought up or brought us out of nakedness laudishan is and brought us in the brightest and bride have been provided with the river that is the ministry of eliasm that is the ministry of the seventh angel to provide us the word robe the holy ghost amen because without that robe nobody can get in there and we point that if we will go without the house and we will stand there hang between hell and earth tormented in tormentation nightmare it's terrible we must make sure while we are here we have given an opportunity we can receive the holy ghost we can get that robe because jesus said even you are evil and provide good things to your children when they ask if you ask for bread you don't give him stone he said if you will ask your heavenly father for the holy ghost he will give you so let's make sure that we have received the true baptism of the holy spirit let us make sure that we have robed by that robe covered by that robe of righteousness that jesus christ because this is the requirement and god says to this is our age laudish i consult the revelation 3 18 to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and unite thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see so that's god's counsel to the age we can come and receive the baptism of the holy spirit that is the ministry of prabhupada he said his greatest or the highlighted message it's the token and he preached this message many times not one time because the holy spirit in him inspired him to preach this again and again and he said without the token you are perish he said get the holy spirit or perish repent or perish so brother and sisters we have to make sure while the time is given to us while the holy ghost is available for us all and god gave the council to this eighth that come and take the white raymond that your nakedness do not appear if he will come he is waiting his father loving father you remember the prodigal son when he came he repented the roof was provided to him by the father father was waiting if anyone here and i know and i believe all are repented and have accepted the lord jesus christ but without jesus without that robe without the covering of our sin or washed by the blood if we go there we will be in tormentation let's make sure like prodigal son we can come and say lord i have sinned and the roof was provided to him and jesus christ is the door and he is there because he has given the invitation when you come to him through the door he is standing there to provide the rope amen so i am closing with this quote by brahms quote from the message redemption by judgment not just a gold crown to set on your head but something far beyond that paul got a glimpse of it one time he said i hath not seen ear has not heard neither has it entered the hearts of men what god has for them in store that love him not a crone a gold crown that would not mean much to me i don't care about them things anyhow but micron is a new body a new being crowned in his likeness a body like his own glorious body where i can just live with him that's the crown enough for me amen that's what brahnam said so that's what he came for that's why god has sent us because this deceived church may come out of that condition and we are the witness that we have come out of that chaos that darkness in that condition we were there sometime when we were in the denominational world but now we have received a message the message which came from heaven eternity to take us back to eternity to provide us the robe elijah's ministry we are the rebecca we are the root he said boaz provided hope to her elijah provided rope to her amen may the lord help us he was elijah amen and we are elisha he preached a message second-handed robe and in that message he said we do not need any new doctrine new teaching said what we need is our 19th french uniting of the holy spirit that is the requirement that is the token and token must be on this on display in the evening time may the lord bless you let's pray gracious heavenly father we just want to thank you for the provision that you have made for us for the message for the holy spirit guiding us directing us unto all the truth because of this message we know where we are and what has been fulfilled and what you are going to fulfill and because of this message our eyes are open and we are covered and we have received the holy ghost we thank you for everything that you have given us for

[Music] precious [Music] [Applause] please [Music] me [Music] how many want to be covered completely covered in the full garment that's been given to us men if we're seeking god to cover us for the baptism of the holy ghost through that word to be clothed in that word that's been given to us on this day we cannot seek the holy ghost and resist the holy ghost at the same time [Music] you know the prophet of god the garment has been restored and he's here clothing a bride and the garment of the word amen and to receive that holy ghost the life of that word to come upon us christ we cannot be asking to receive that and be resisting the very thing we're asking to receive because it's the life of the word coming to manifest the word through us and so we have to do is we surrender completely to this word and say lord this message is christ it's not a man's idea it's not a compilation of doctrines for teaching but this message is jesus christ the word has been restored is the headship restored to the church i cannot resist that and ask for the life of christ to come and cover me but i have to say lord it's right it's every bit right and i surrender all my life to that lord i take the headship of your word now come lord and be my clothing be my garment be my purification be my righteousness clothe me lord in that word if you're seeking the baptism of the holy ghost surrender completely to the word that has been restored don't ask to change the garment say i want the garment but could you cut the sleeves a little different and could you we've been given a perfect garment it doesn't need altered to our opinion it doesn't need change to our own fleshly desires what we need to do is die out to everything that's contrary to the garment and say god if there's part of me that doesn't fit in that cut that part off of me because i want to fit into that garment it's got to be your life the life of the word the life of the lamb amen the blood that was shed to come upon me that now your life is in me and on me and i'm displaying your righteousness to the world if we want the holy ghost if we want a greater measure of the holy ghost we want more of god in our lives then we have to surrender to what god has given us and like our brother said if he's if we've surrendered how can we ask earthly fathers good things and they'll not give us evil if so much that that is so true how much more so if we under a full and complete surrender and death to self ask our heavenly father will he not fill us with the holy ghost let's not make it complicated let's just die out let's not make it hard let's just surrender completely to him amen god bless you let's bow our heads and pray in a prayer thanksgiving their heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this word that you've given to us god we appreciate so much lord what you have restored in this age help us almighty god not to take it for granted help us not to forsake so great a salvation that you have given in this age the day that we live in lord you you have opened the heavens unto us lord you've given us access into your mind you've provided a pure white garment that we can be clothed in in this day the holy ghost that has been bound for two thousand years is unbound and released and back upon the church help us god to be aware of the day and age we live in and the opportunity that we're in god help us to die out to ourselves in a greater way and surrender to this word lord god i pray that you would shave off all of us that is contrary to this word shape us lord to that garment god clothe us in your own righteousness with your own life that we might be a reflection lord of your life in this earth god i pray that you would bless our brother roshan lord god as he's poured out his heart i pray that
