[19:31] and well you're living lord inside your
[19:34] bride bringing us Lord into a higher
[19:37] Place God I just pray that you would

[19:41] you would take full control may you have
[19:43] Liberty Lord amongst us as we glorify
[19:46] your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[19:50] amen amen God bless you as you have your
[19:52] seats I be seated for just a
[19:55] moment man I just want to say it's good
[19:57] to be home we appreciate you all for
[20:00] praying for us we've had a wonderful
[20:01] trip and um I'm going to show you a few
[20:04] pictures just here in a moment so you
[20:05] can see where we were but first we've
[20:08] we've got a very special dedication we'd
[20:10] like to do so we'd like to invite the
[20:12] Barnes family to come forward if they
[20:13] would at this
[20:15] time Matt and Rachel Barnes if they'll
[20:17] bring their
[20:19] children to the
[20:22] front it feels so good to tell them to
[20:24] bring their children to the front as
[20:27] many of you know they had an adoption
[20:29] that was finalized on Thursday this past
[20:32] Thursday the 28th uh many of you were
[20:34] able to go we thank God for those who
[20:36] were able to go and celebrate with them
[20:38] but it's been a long year and a half
[20:40] there's been some ups and some downs and
[20:42] some trials but God knew all along what
[20:45] he was going to do amen God was never
[20:47] taken by surprise and we just want to
[20:50] say thank you to God as we dedicate
[20:53] these children to the Lord so these two
[20:56] came to them already named
[21:01] Ari was arah
[21:03] arah but they they gave her a new middle
[21:06] name Ariah Grace
[21:10] Barnes Ariah means Lion of God I think
[21:14] in this case it's
[21:15] lioness of God and Grace means
[21:19] favor and then Kai uh God dropped a name
[21:23] in Sister Rachel's heart one day and
[21:25] they changed his name to Malachi so he
[21:27] can still be called
[21:29] Malachi Paul Barnes Malachi means
[21:32] messenger of God and Paul means little
[21:36] or humble I say God bless you in your
[21:40] new names amen isn't God good amen man
[21:44] are we thankful for what God's done
[21:46] these two had a difficult start in life
[21:48] it wasn't so easy but God had a rescue
[21:52] plan God knew what he was going to do
[21:55] and so we just want to take a minute as
[21:57] a congregation to pray to together and
[21:59] dedicate these two children to the Lord
[22:02] so let's just
[22:03] pray let's just
[22:06] pray dear Lord Jesus God I thank you
[22:10] Lord for this little boy and this little
[22:12] girl God you've watched over them all
[22:15] the days of their life Lord through
[22:17] difficulty and through tragedy but God
[22:19] you had a plan you knew before the
[22:22] foundation of the world what you were
[22:23] going to do in their lives and we're
[22:25] standing here as Witnesses of your grace
[22:27] of your love and your mercy mercy and we
[22:29] want to say thank you for these little
[22:31] lives Lord if you were here you would

[22:35] but I stand here as your representative
[22:37] and I take them into my arms and I bless
[22:39] them in the name of Jesus Christ God may
[22:42] you watch over them as youve watched
[22:44] over them these first few years of their
[22:46] life you are so good and so faithful to
[22:49] give them a mother and a father that
[22:50] will love them and care for them God I
[22:53] pray that you'd watch over them from

[27:45] couple pictures I'm not really going to
[27:47] do a trip report this wasn't a missions
[27:48] trip this was more of a Ministry trip
[27:50] but I just wanted you to see where we
[27:52] were if you didn't know we were on the
[27:54] opposite side of the planet and so and
[27:57] it takes a long time to get there and
[27:59] there's a lot of flights so but um I got
[28:03] a picture here a satellite picture of
[28:06] Australia everybody lives around the
[28:08] edge of Australia nobody really lives in
[28:10] the middle there's just a few it's
[28:12] pretty much Barren but the edges are
[28:14] beautiful quite beautiful and so um in
[28:18] this trip I was really really blessed to
[28:20] get to travel with two of my favorite
[28:22] traveling Companions and so this was a
[28:24] rare opportunity and we were very very
[28:26] thankful that we got to go to together
[28:28] I'm especially thankful that God
[28:29] afforded me this privilege amen while I
[28:32] had the time to take it and it was it
[28:34] was a real blessing and you know we we
[28:37] drove up to Detroit and flew from
[28:38] Detroit to Los Angeles that's almost a
[28:41] 5H hour flight Los Angeles down to
[28:43] Sydney and that's almost a 15-hour
[28:46] flight and then we got on a plane and we
[28:49] flew an hour and a half up to Brisbane
[28:51] we got in a car and we drove about an
[28:53] hour to brother Daniel's place and uh
[28:57] then we stayed up all day and went to
[28:59] bed that night so by the time we laid
[29:00] down it had been like 50 hours since we
[29:02] had laid down but praise God he took
[29:05] care of us
[29:06] amen um this is a picture of brother
[29:09] Daniel we're on his back porch there
[29:10] just eating breakfast the next day after
[29:12] we were there brother Daniel and his
[29:14] wife Cheryl there all the way at the end
[29:16] and then he's got two deacons there and
[29:18] their wives so it was nice to get the
[29:19] fellowship with them a little bit this
[29:21] is a picture brother Daniel's Church you
[29:23] remember brother Daniel was here two
[29:25] years ago for November meetings and we
[29:27] had a wonderful time with him and so
[29:29] we've been talking about this for quite
[29:30] some time and it just worked out we had
[29:33] three meetings at his church uh and then
[29:36] Sunday there was two and we had a
[29:37] fellowship in between they've got a
[29:38] fellowship hall they got quite a nice
[29:40] facility and we thank God for what they
[29:42] have and while we were there the the
[29:45] girls got to meet some other young
[29:46] ladies and they had some fellowship so
[29:48] it was really nice they got to make some
[29:49] friends on the other side of the planet
[29:52] one thing that's we find that's a real
[29:54] privilege is that you know that's what I
[29:57] told him when we were there in Australia
[29:59] I said it's a privilege to get to meet
[30:01] brothers and sisters around the world
[30:05] because you know most people have to
[30:07] wait till the marriage supper but some
[30:08] of us are privileged to get to meet some
[30:10] of them in this life and I counted a
[30:12] great honor and a great privilege to
[30:14] have got to meet them and shake their
[30:15] hands and hug the brothers by the neck
[30:17] and there's going to be a great reunion
[30:19] someday and and we'll all meet but I'm
[30:22] so thankful we had this time here so we
[30:26] had quite a busy schedule I had quite a
[30:29] busy
[30:30] schedule I say we Loosely because we had
[30:34] the weekend meetings and then uh uh
[30:37] three services then I had one day to
[30:38] rest and then I flew out Tuesday down to
[30:42] me Melbourne but when I went to
[30:44] Melbourne the girl stayed behind for
[30:48] vacation and uh I ended up with eight
[30:50] services in N9 days plus 3 days of
[30:53] travel and so it was a lot uh when we
[30:57] went to m we we had there was another
[30:59] fellowship there another church and if
[31:02] you look at this picture all the way to
[31:04] the right is brother quazy and brother
[31:06] quazy is a minister he's originally from
[31:08] Ghana but he's an immigrant uh to
[31:10] Australia he's been a pastor for over 25
[31:12] years there in Melbourne got a quite a
[31:14] nice church and we were really blessed
[31:16] just to the right of me is brother Eric
[31:18] and his wife Kylie they're the ones who
[31:20] hosted me I stayed in their home and
[31:21] they were wonderful host and we had a
[31:23] wonderful time there with them we had
[31:25] meetings Wednesday night and Thursday
[31:27] night there and it was a joint
[31:29] Fellowship everywhere was a joint
[31:30] Fellowship so they opened up the church
[31:31] for other believers in the area so it
[31:33] was quite nice it was a full house and
[31:36] we got to meet a lot of Believers and it
[31:38] was in Melbourne that I I had a sister
[31:40] come up to me and says um I think it was
[31:43] Melbourne it might have been Perth I
[31:46] don't remember now but anyways uh she
[31:49] said make sure you tell everybody in the
[31:51] church that they're a blessing to us so
[31:54] I said I'll be happy to convey the
[31:55] message they said the musician
[31:58] the song leaders the congregational
[32:00] worship all the ministers and they said
[32:03] even the prayer requests and testimonies
[32:05] are a blessing and so I said I will
[32:07] relay the message but they and she said
[32:09] make sure you tell them I said I'm going
[32:11] to tell them so I I've relayed the
[32:13] message but they were she was quite
[32:14] adamant that she was been very very
[32:16] blessed by you all so we had we had
[32:19] meetings there then Friday we flew over
[32:21] to Perth now if you don't know if you
[32:23] take Australia and you lay it over the
[32:25] United States it's roughly the same size
[32:28] so this is big this is a lot of flying
[32:30] it's like a four or five hour flight
[32:31] over to Perth so we flew over to Perth
[32:35] and when I got there I I met brother uh
[32:39] Michael there and we had we had another
[32:41] weekend meetings two on Saturday and one
[32:44] on Sunday right there at the end of the
[32:45] trip but while I was working the girls
[32:49] found something else to
[32:51] do playing with koalas and kangaroos I
[32:54] guess you can only do that in
[32:56] Australia but this is brother Michael
[32:59] he's originally from Zimbabwe but he's
[33:01] immigrated there and after that he
[33:03] became a pastor of the church there he's
[33:05] a wonderful brother and the wonderful
[33:06] Fellowship that they have there this is
[33:09] the church they don't have their own
[33:12] church they're actually renting off of a
[33:15] Pentecostal church so they they have
[33:17] their service at 1 p.m. on Sunday so we
[33:20] had two on Saturday they could rent the
[33:22] facility uh all day Saturday and then a
[33:24] 1 p.m. service on Sunday and it was
[33:28] while I was at this church um I just
[33:32] throughout the whole trip we kept
[33:33] getting text messages from you all and
[33:35] and and little messages little notes and
[33:37] I just want to say it was super
[33:39] encouraging I I appreciate every one of
[33:41] you for dropping us a note just sending
[33:43] something and it meant a lot to me uh
[33:46] especially since I lost my traveling
[33:47] Companions and I was all by myself in
[33:49] airports and to get a little word of
[33:51] encouragement was great but it was at
[33:53] this church I had two services on
[33:54] Saturday I was at the end of my
[33:56] preaching I already preached several
[33:58] services and I was just a little bit
[34:00] feeling a little bit wore out I had a
[34:01] little bit of a head cold and I went
[34:03] into the the little Pastor study the
[34:06] study between services and I was uh
[34:08] struggling with the second service and
[34:10] and just really seeking the Lord and
[34:11] feeling tired and feeling too tired to
[34:14] preach and I got a message uh I got a
[34:18] message from Brother John Brooks that
[34:20] said brother Chad you just came heavy on
[34:21] my heart and I'm praying for you and I
[34:24] looked and it was like 1:30 in the
[34:26] morning here and and I said how in the
[34:28] world did God wake him up or keep him up
[34:31] or I don't know to send that note right
[34:34] when I needed it the most in the whole
[34:36] trip I said God knows what he's doing
[34:39] and God works through his body I say God
[34:41] bless you brother John that was a huge
[34:43] encouragement to me and so I fired right
[34:45] back thank you brother I needed that and
[34:47] so we went and the Lord blessed the
[34:49] services he really blessed the services
[34:52] especially in Perth above all God really
[34:55] God really came down and he really did
[34:57] something
[34:58] Supernatural I had no idea of what was
[35:00] going on I had no idea really what to
[35:03] preach but God really changed my
[35:05] direction uh during that service and I
[35:08] preached unlike IID preached any other
[35:09] time that I was in Australia and God
[35:12] just redirected and it was just odd and
[35:14] it wasn't anything that I even really
[35:16] desired and I was going down a path and
[35:18] I didn't know why I was going down this
[35:19] path and I didn't necessarily want to go
[35:21] down this path like I would have rather
[35:23] preached on other subjects if I got to
[35:25] just pick but God just orchestrated it
[35:27] and and that was the way Saturday night
[35:29] and then Sunday morning the same thing I
[35:31] woke up and God just redirected and I
[35:33] was all tore up trying to sort it out
[35:35] but I eventually just I just submitted
[35:38] to the path that was going and not what
[35:40] I thought was best and not what I
[35:41] thought was most beneficial but just
[35:43] what was there and afterwards the pastor
[35:46] gave me a testimony and it absolutely
[35:48] floored me I had no idea how perfect God
[35:51] had orchestrated that service and it it
[35:55] it's not a man it's God
[35:58] because we have no idea what we're doing
[36:00] sometimes and it's not and it's not
[36:01] these bold things you know absolutely
[36:03] for sure what you're doing God spoke to
[36:05] me and I knew exactly this was for them
[36:07] I had no idea all I could do was move
[36:09] with those little nudges that God gives
[36:11] and the whole time you're second
[36:12] guessing and hoping it's working out
[36:14] right and praying amen and when you get
[36:16] to the end you find out it was perfect
[36:18] it just takes your breath away because
[36:19] the whole time you're uncertain the
[36:21] whole time you're trying to feel your
[36:23] way through it not knowing if this is
[36:24] right or not right and you don't know
[36:26] till the end
[36:28] and you can say thank God Amen God has
[36:31] been good amen so I just really
[36:34] appreciate your prayer support and I
[36:36] really appreciate this assembly and what
[36:38] you mean to us I've been longing to get
[36:41] back I've been excited to get back home
[36:42] and I'm so glad I could be here for
[36:45] Easter just to see you all and I
[36:47] appreciate all that you've done for us
[36:50] uh after Perth we flew back to Brisbane
[36:52] I spent a a day and a half or two days
[36:55] actually back there and then the girls
[36:57] and I flew back home and uh this is a
[37:00] sunset over Melbourne Bay we caught one
[37:02] night we were having dinner it was
[37:03] beautiful Australia is
[37:05] beautiful amen but I I've I've said many
[37:09] times the most beautiful the most
[37:11] beautiful place in every country I've
[37:14] ever been in is the Bride of Jesus
[37:16] Christ the most beautiful thing to see
[37:19] in every country in every country I've
[37:21] been to I may not always have time for
[37:23] sightseeing I may not get out and see
[37:25] some of the popular SES usually I go
[37:27] from a house or a hotel to a car to a
[37:30] church to a car to a hotel or a house
[37:33] but but by the grace of God I've seen
[37:35] the most beautiful sight in every
[37:36] country I've been in because I've seen
[37:38] God's bride and it's been a privilege
[37:41] and I thank God for it amen I just want
[37:44] to say thank you too to all the
[37:46] ministers who ministered while I was
[37:47] gone amen I had a chance to download the
[37:50] services and catch up as I was flying so

[40:47] destroy I am come that they might have
[40:50] life and then they might have it more
[40:53] abundantly let's bow our heads and pray
[40:55] Lord Jesus we ask that
[40:57] Lord as we now turn our attention Lord
[40:59] to your word that you would come and
[41:02] break the bread of life to us Lord that
[41:04] you come open our understanding to
[41:06] understand your word Lord and open the
[41:08] scriptures to us that we might see you
[41:11] God I pray that you reveal to us Lord
[41:13] your your desire for us in this day that
[41:15] we're living and and Lord may we grow
[41:17] Lord by the food that you give us the
[41:19] good sheep food in due season I pray
[41:22] that you'd bless the ministering of the
[41:23] word Lord and bless the vessel that you
[41:25] use and God give us ears to hear and a
[41:27] heart to perceive all that you have for
[41:29] us this morning in Jesus Christ's name
[41:31] we pray amen amen God bless you as you
[41:35] have your
[41:37] seats
[41:39] amen Jesus came that we may have
[41:43] life and that more
[41:46] abundantly amen uh an abundant life and
[41:50] we thank God for that and we know that
[41:53] that Christ came and he he paid the
[41:56] price of redemption for us a price that
[41:58] nobody could pay because we were all
[42:00] sold in sin we were all bondslaves to
[42:02] sin we were trapped in hybridization but
[42:05] he came virgin born Liv the perfect life
[42:08] so that he could become a substitute for
[42:10] you and I and he gave his life and he
[42:12] shed his blood for our Redemption to pay
[42:14] the price of our Redemption amen but as
[42:17] Paul said if if Christ Rose not then we
[42:20] have all men are most miserable because
[42:22] we would know that we're free from the
[42:24] bondage of sin that the price has been
[42:26] paid but if there was no Resurrection
[42:28] there was no guarantee of our eternal
[42:30] life amen but he resurrected to prove
[42:33] that what he said was true and prove
[42:34] that he had victory over death now the
[42:37] curse of death has been broken amen and
[42:40] the resurrection is the proof of this
[42:42] and so we thank God Amen that we are
[42:44] free people amen free in every sense of
[42:47] the word free and you say well brother
[42:49] Chad we're still stuck in hybrid flesh
[42:51] oh that's only temporary friends we're
[42:53] free we've been free we've been
[42:55] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[42:57] we've been set free and we've seen the
[42:59] we've seen the resurrection of Christ as
[43:01] a witness that sin's curse is broken
[43:04] death is broken and death has no hold on
[43:07] you and I he come that we might have
[43:09] life and life more abundantly amen amen
[43:12] he's restored to us eternal life so he
[43:16] is the god of resurrection and we
[43:19] believe that we are in the Resurrection
[43:21] season amen this is the resurrection of
[43:24] his bride this is the resurrection of
[43:26] his church
[43:27] and if we turn together to John 11 I
[43:30] would like to just read a little bit out
[43:32] of John 11 as we move
[43:36] forward says in John
[43:41] 11:23 this is The Story of Lazarus we
[43:44] know that Lazarus had become sick and a
[43:46] message went to Jesus Christ that your
[43:48] friend Lazarus is sick and Jesus delayed
[43:51] and he doesn't go and and he and he says
[43:53] it's good that he didn't go this whole
[43:55] thing has to play out according to God's
[43:57] desire but now he comes after Lazarus is
[44:00] dead and been buried and he comes in
[44:03] verse 23 and he says Jesus sayth unto
[44:05] her thy brother shall rise again Martha
[44:09] say unto him I know that he shall rise
[44:11] again in the resurrection at the last
[44:13] day Martha begins to tell that she has
[44:16] faith in a resurrection she believes in
[44:18] a resurrection but she's believing in a
[44:21] future
[44:22] Resurrection she has faith in a res she
[44:24] knows that her brother will rise again
[44:25] in the resurrection so she believes the
[44:28] word she believes the prophets but Jesus
[44:30] doesn't want her just to have faith in a
[44:32] resurrection that's coming but he wants
[44:34] her to have faith in a present day
[44:36] Resurrection he wants her to go beyond
[44:39] just what everybody else understands but
[44:41] now he comes in verse 25 and he says
[44:43] Jesus said unto her I am the
[44:46] resurrection the resurrection then is a
[44:48] person amen the resurrection is not just
[44:50] an event we know that there's a
[44:52] culmination there's an event but the C
[44:55] the the resurrection is a person the
[44:56] resurrection is a life the resurrection
[44:58] is Jesus
[45:00] Christ he said I am the resurrection and
[45:03] the life he that believeth in me though
[45:05] he were dead yet shall he
[45:08] live and whosoever liveth and believeth
[45:11] in me shall never die believest thou
[45:14] this amen Jesus now is taking the
[45:17] resurrection that she believes in amen
[45:20] and he's and he's showing he's showing
[45:21] her a higher Faith he's showing her a
[45:23] greater truth than what she believes
[45:25] there's not a resurrection that's coming
[45:27] but there's a present Resurrection
[45:29] standing right in front of her and the
[45:31] power of resurrection and life is right
[45:33] there it's Jesus Christ the word made
[45:36] flesh the prophecy fulfilled he's
[45:39] standing there he is the resurrection he
[45:42] is the life and he said and and and he
[45:44] says he that believeth in me though he
[45:48] were dead yet shall he live my goodness
[45:51] praise God he's not just talking about
[45:53] physical death he's talking about those
[45:55] of us who were born born Dead Come
[45:58] spiritually dead blind and alienated
[46:00] from God Amen we were separated from the
[46:03] things of God but if you believe in him
[46:05] though you're dead yet shall you be made
[46:07] alive there's a resurrection in this
[46:09] season right now because the person of
[46:11] the Resurrection is
[46:13] here the word amen the same word that
[46:15] was made flesh there is the same word
[46:17] being made flesh
[46:20] here and the resurrection and the life
[46:22] is present Resurrection Sunday is not
[46:24] one Sunday it's a life amen it's his
[46:27] life coming into
[46:29] US raising us from the
[46:32] dead the dead of separation from God and
[46:35] bringing us into
[46:37] life he says whosoever liveth I'm
[46:40] reading verse 26 again and whosoever
[46:43] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[46:44] die believest thou this and she said
[46:47] unto him yay Lord I believe that thou
[46:49] art the Christ the son of God which
[46:51] shall come into the
[46:53] world let's go down to verse 43 now
[46:58] he goes to the grave and he tells them
[47:00] to roll the stone away they find a stone
[47:03] placed over the grave and and it's
[47:06] amazing uh if I could just expound on
[47:09] this for just a moment this isn't really
[47:11] what I planned on doing but but praise
[47:12] God anyhow there's a stone that they've
[47:15] rolled over he died amen and he died
[47:18] because he had a sickness and that
[47:20] sickness was under death and and and
[47:22] they wanted Jesus to come to save him
[47:24] but Jesus wants to do something greater
[47:26] he wants to show Resurrection Life
[47:28] present tense they're all holding on to
[47:30] a future but he wants them to move from
[47:32] the future to today he wants to bring
[47:34] the res Resurrection present tense amen
[47:37] so he lets it Go and and now he he's
[47:39] dead and they they take and they wrap
[47:41] him in grave clothes amen what do they
[47:44] wrap him in gra they wrap him for death
[47:46] and then they Place him in a tomb which
[47:48] is what it's Stone that's been carved
[47:50] out by man and they take the stone
[47:52] that's carved out by man and they lay in
[47:54] the carved out rock that man is as as
[47:57] carved out himself and then they take a
[47:59] great Stone and they lay that stone over
[48:01] the entrance amen and we're going to see
[48:04] here it's a picture of denominationalism
[48:06] it's a picture of the church ages amen
[48:08] because they've taken the word and
[48:10] they've carved it out themselves but the
[48:12] man carved rock is for death not for
[48:15] life and then they placed him under the
[48:18] word amen and then they rolled the word
[48:21] on top of him their own Revelation why
[48:24] because the the denominational system
[48:26] that old system was what it was holding
[48:28] them down in death by what their own
[48:31] Revelation on the word they're making
[48:33] sure they stay in the manmade Rock
[48:38] grave but when Jesus Christ the word
[48:41] made flesh was present amen he was the
[48:43] resurrection and the life and he says
[48:45] roll that stone away move that false
[48:48] revelation of that false church out of
[48:50] the way amen we've got to move this out
[48:53] because I'm going to speak life back
[48:55] into this body amen amen and that's
[48:58] what's happened in our day when God sent
[49:00] a prophet amen they were rolling that
[49:02] false Doctrine and rolling that false
[49:04] understanding that man-made idea that
[49:07] man-made Revelation rolling it off of
[49:09] the Tomb amen why so that the voice of
[49:12] the Resurrection can hit and bring him
[49:14] out of that man-made
[49:18] system it's amazing how man uses the
[49:21] word to keep man under the word but God
[49:25] Amen when you when you look at PSAL I
[49:27] think it's Psalms is it psalms 27 that
[49:29] he used for the Rapture and he says amen
[49:32] thou has set me up upon a
[49:36] rock where does man put those in the
[49:39] church they put them under the rock but
[49:42] where does God put man God puts man on
[49:45] the Rock why he lifts him on the word he
[49:49] puts the word under him to lift him up
[49:51] and he said now is my head above all of
[49:53] my
[49:54] enemies why because he set me upon the
[49:57] rock he didn't put me under the rock to
[49:59] hold me down but this word elevated me
[50:03] above all of my enemies and put me on a
[50:05] firm foundation not for death but for
[50:09] Life
[50:12] hallelujah oh my goodness how could you
[50:14] not love this word how could you not
[50:16] love this message it's life friends it's
[50:18] everything it's everything to
[50:21] us amen they're not old Bible stories
[50:24] amen they're our life they're being
[50:27] fleshed out
[50:29] today amen Jesus said you roll the stone
[50:34] away he wasn't going to do this all by
[50:38] himself he had to have church
[50:40] involvement yeah amen you roll the stone
[50:44] away you move that false idea away you
[50:48] tell the
[50:50] truth amen that church and brother B
[50:53] said he told those
[50:55] women that's what the the prophet of God
[50:57] said he told those poor women to roll
[50:59] that stone away that's how brother
[51:01] Brenham said it he said why because the
[51:04] church has something to do in
[51:08] this you roll that stone away you remove
[51:12] that false idea you tell the
[51:16] truth but the church can't bring
[51:18] Resurrection Life right only the
[51:22] resurrection and life can bring
[51:24] Resurrection life amen amen we got a
[51:27] part to play but we can't bring life
[51:30] yeah right then then he speaks and it
[51:33] says in verse
[51:35] 43 and when he thus had spoken he cried
[51:38] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth the
[51:42] prophet of God says he had to cry
[51:43] Lazarus because if he just cried with a
[51:45] loud voice come forth they would have
[51:46] all come
[51:48] forth but he said Lazarus come forth why
[51:51] it's the voice of the Resurrection amen
[51:54] he has resur he is the resurrection in
[51:56] life life so he's got to be specific
[51:58] Lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[52:01] came forth bound hand and foot with
[52:03] grave clothes and his face was bound
[52:05] about with a napkin Jesus saith unto him
[52:08] loose him and let him
[52:11] go the church has another part to
[52:14] play Jesus has his part nobody else can
[52:18] substitute nobody can bring life but the
[52:21] voice of the
[52:23] Resurrection but when he's come to life
[52:26] he comes out bound hand and foot all
[52:29] bound up he's still restricted in his
[52:31] movement he's alive but he's still tied
[52:34] down what's he tied down with with the
[52:36] old rags of denominationalism with old
[52:38] thinking old understanding false
[52:40] understanding of the Bible and he's all
[52:42] bound down he doesn't have the freedom
[52:44] to worship he doesn't have the freedom
[52:45] to move he doesn't have the freedom to
[52:47] express the life that's in him but he's
[52:49] telling the people that are around the
[52:51] church you loose him amen you take all
[52:54] those grave clothes off of him and let
[52:56] him go free amen cuz he's got the
[52:58] resurrection
[52:59] life amen so God is working and it and
[53:03] it's amazing it says he cried with a
[53:05] loud voice he said Lazarus come
[53:09] forth amen it was a specific cry to a
[53:12] specific
[53:13] one and in this day we've been told in
[53:16] Revelation 10 that the mighty Angels
[53:18] come down and he said the the the
[53:21] Covenant Angel The Mighty Angel amen
[53:24] with a rainbow over his head brother B
[53:26] said only Christ it could be he's come
[53:29] down with an open book in his hand and
[53:31] he cried with a loud voice what was that
[53:34] that's the voice of the resurrection and
[53:36] what's he calling for he's calling to
[53:38] his church for his bride to come out
[53:40] come out from among her my people and be
[53:42] ye separate he's calling for the
[53:44] resurrection of the
[53:46] Bride why because she was under the
[53:48] man-made Rock she was under the man's
[53:51] Revelation she was held down but in this
[53:54] end time there's another loud cry and
[53:56] it's the loud Cry Of The Mighty Angel
[53:59] it's the loud Cry of Christ when he
[54:01] comes with an open book and when it's
[54:03] the time for the unsealing of the book
[54:05] he cries as when a lion roar and what is
[54:08] that cry it's the voice of the
[54:10] Resurrection what's he resurrecting he's
[54:13] resurrecting his
[54:14] bride coming out of the Dark Ages
[54:17] restoring her back to her position amen
[54:21] that's the
[54:24] cry but oh God
[54:27] it wasn't for
[54:29] everyone it was only for those whose
[54:31] names were
[54:34] called brother B said he doesn't call
[54:37] the names like Orman Neville or Le Veil
[54:41] it's not that kind of
[54:43] calling but he calls your name as he's
[54:46] revealing the word as he's unfolding the
[54:49] Mysteries that's calling your name
[54:52] amen what does that mean that means as
[54:56] the prophet of God takes and now
[54:58] preaches the Seven Seals and unveils the
[55:00] Mysteries that were locked up through
[55:02] the church ages something in your heart
[55:04] says that's the truth that's the truth
[55:08] that's the truth others listen and walk
[55:10] away but you listen and say that's right
[55:13] that's the truth that's the Bible That's
[55:15] the Way It Is regardless of what I've
[55:17] been taught regardless of what I've
[55:19] thought all my life regardless of what
[55:21] my forefathers thought regardless of
[55:23] what generationally I was taught it
[55:25] doesn't matter amen I'm hearing a voice
[55:27] and that voice is preaching to me the
[55:29] truth of this Bible it may not sound
[55:31] like anything I've ever heard before but
[55:33] when I hear it something in me can
[55:35] identify that that's the truth what's he
[55:38] doing he's calling your name amen cuz
[55:41] not everybody gets that not everybody
[55:43] has a predestinated seat of Life inside
[55:46] that has the capacity to hear that voice
[55:48] and say that ain't nothing but the truth
[55:50] brother
[55:52] Brandon amen Millions here and walk away
[55:56] but there's a few who hear with a
[55:58] different set of ears ears of
[56:00] predestination and they can say oh my
[56:02] there was there was many people that
[56:04] were laying in the grave the day that
[56:06] Jesus cried with a loud voice but he
[56:08] called for one and he called Lazarus and
[56:10] in this day he's not calling everybody
[56:12] he's calling his bride it's a specific
[56:15] name he's calling Mrs Jesus Christ to
[56:17] come forth out of the systems and out of
[56:19] the denominations out of the hued out
[56:21] Rock Amen come out cuz he's going to put
[56:24] you upon the rock
[56:26] amen the rock of revelation of his
[56:29] word praise be to God and how do we know
[56:34] it's specific for me because I heard my
[56:37] name
[56:39] called well I didn't hear the
[56:42] pronunciation my parents
[56:46] used it's not your real
[56:51] name amen the whole family in Heaven and
[56:54] Earth is named Jesus Christ
[56:57] Christ when I heard his voice and I knew
[57:02] who was here in this day when I found
[57:04] out who was present and who was opening
[57:07] the seals and who was reading the vi of
[57:09] the Mysteries I heard my
[57:11] name amen that's what the whole family
[57:15] is
[57:15] named now let's go to John
[57:18] 12 let's go just a little further in
[57:21] this
[57:25] story
[57:27] John
[57:29] 12:1 then Jesus 6 days before the
[57:32] Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus
[57:35] was which had been dead whom he raised
[57:37] from the
[57:39] dead if we go down to verse 9 we'll pick
[57:42] up the story there much people of the
[57:45] Jews therefore knew that he was there
[57:47] and they came not for jesus' sake only
[57:50] but that they might see Lazarus also
[57:52] whom he had raised from the
[57:54] dead now now Jesus wasn't the only
[57:59] spectacle they wanted to see the one
[58:01] that was raised from the
[58:03] dead now there was there was uh uh more
[58:07] to the story we should
[58:09] say now verse 10 but the chief priest
[58:11] consulted that they might put Lazarus
[58:14] also to death they already wanted to
[58:16] kill Jesus because Jesus was exposing
[58:19] their system he was exposing the
[58:21] religion he was exposing the the the the
[58:24] the falseness of their heart and and he
[58:26] was exposing the whole thing and the
[58:28] people were going after Jesus and they
[58:29] were losing their in influence and for
[58:31] Envy they wanted to kill Jesus but now
[58:34] it wasn't just Jesus that they needed to
[58:36] kill but the one that he raised back to
[58:38] life is a target too because now people
[58:41] are being attracted to the one who was
[58:43] raised back to
[58:46] life praise
[58:49] God let's read this again but the chief
[58:51] priests consulted that they might put
[58:53] Lazarus also to death because that by
[58:56] reason of him who Lazarus many of the
[59:00] Jews went away and believed on
[59:03] Jesus what's the problem now the problem
[59:06] now is not just that Jesus is preaching
[59:09] the word and exposing the the false
[59:11] Doctrine and the falseness of the church
[59:13] now there's one that's been called by
[59:15] name that's been resurrected to life
[59:17] that's come out of the system and now
[59:19] he's there testifying that Jesus is the
[59:21] Messiah testifying that the voice of the
[59:24] Resurrection is present and the life of
[59:26] the resurrection and the power of the
[59:27] Resurrection is present tense and now
[59:30] not just because of Jesus but now
[59:32] because of Lazarus many of the Jews amen
[59:36] are Believing on
[59:38] Jesus why is the resurrection power
[59:41] supposed to do today it's supposed to
[59:42] restore a bride back to her position why
[59:45] because she's now an attraction amen
[59:48] that's attracting the attention of the
[59:49] people and so people will come see her
[59:52] resurrected life and Believe on Jesus
[59:55] Christ amen that's what our life is
[59:58] supposed to produce we've been
[59:59] resurrected amen we've been resurrected
[1:00:02] out of dead denominationalism we've been
[1:00:03] resurrected out of the false
[1:00:05] understanding we've been brought back to
[1:00:07] the original life the original faith of
[1:00:09] the of the forefathers we've been back
[1:00:11] to the original life that came from
[1:00:13] Pentecost why was the life restored amen
[1:00:15] so that people could see there's a
[1:00:17] resurrection power on Earth today we
[1:00:20] don't have to live a compromising life
[1:00:22] we don't have to live a second rate
[1:00:24] Christian Life we don't have to have
[1:00:25] hypoc y all around us there can be a
[1:00:27] genuine life lived for Jesus Christ
[1:00:30] there can be a real church just like
[1:00:32] there was in the first century that'll
[1:00:33] give all that'll believe the word
[1:00:35] that'll stay with it that'll manifest
[1:00:37] the life amen and that's an attraction
[1:00:40] that'll attract people to Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] now that becomes the
[1:00:47] threat I don't know about you but I
[1:00:49] would like to be a
[1:00:51] threat to the kingdom of the
[1:00:53] devil I would like my resurrected life
[1:00:57] to be a
[1:01:00] threat not me cuz I have
[1:01:03] nothing but a life a resurrected life
[1:01:07] that seed of God that was laying dormant
[1:01:10] inside has sprung to life at the voice
[1:01:12] of the Resurrection we heard the call
[1:01:15] we' come to life and now it's his life
[1:01:17] in here manifesting
[1:01:20] itself praise
[1:01:22] God there's a quote that I've been
[1:01:25] meditating on on that's got me thinking
[1:01:26] on this thought and it comes from Christ
[1:01:28] as the mystery of God revealed and and I
[1:01:31] will read it to you it says oh if I
[1:01:32] could get the world to see that why
[1:01:35] there you are there is the body of
[1:01:36] Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed
[1:01:39] oh my justified in his sight why are we
[1:01:43] Justified we are his
[1:01:46] victory the church is his
[1:01:49] victory we come forth in the last days
[1:01:52] with this glorious gospel showing his
[1:01:54] victory he died for this purpose and we
[1:01:57] are proof of his victory listen to how
[1:01:59] many times he says his victory yeah
[1:02:02] whose Victory is this this isn't our
[1:02:04] Victory this is his
[1:02:06] victory listen it's it's not what we're
[1:02:09] doing it's what he's doing it's not what
[1:02:11] we've accomplished listen Lazarus had no
[1:02:14] power to raise himself from the dead
[1:02:17] Lazarus was dead he was dead and in the
[1:02:20] grave 4 days he begin to stinketh
[1:02:22] already according to his sister he's
[1:02:24] laying there in
[1:02:26] perfectly incapable of doing
[1:02:29] anything he couldn't raise himself he
[1:02:32] couldn't raise himself no more than you
[1:02:33] and I could raise
[1:02:37] ourselves but God has a predestinated
[1:02:40] appointment with
[1:02:42] Lazarus and it was the power of the
[1:02:45] Resurrection that raised him from the
[1:02:47] dead it wasn't Lazarus power Lazarus had
[1:02:51] no
[1:02:53] power Lazarus was just the one one that
[1:02:56] God chose to manifest his resurrected
[1:02:58] power in he was the chosen vessel that
[1:03:02] God would use to Manifest this
[1:03:04] Resurrection but he had no power to
[1:03:07] resurrect himself and we had no power to
[1:03:10] resurrect ourselves there's nothing we
[1:03:12] can do for ourselves
[1:03:14] friends but the power is in the voice of
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] Resurrection the one who's present the
[1:03:21] resurrection and the life that's Jesus
[1:03:24] Christ and he had he is the the
[1:03:27] resurrection and the life he is the
[1:03:30] power to raise the seed to life it's not
[1:03:34] us it's
[1:03:37] him we're just as helpless as Lazarus
[1:03:42] was but Lazarus had something inside of
[1:03:46] him that when Jesus called he could
[1:03:51] respond that when Jesus called he could
[1:03:54] get up he may still have been bound he
[1:03:57] may I don't know if he hopped out I
[1:03:58] don't know if he Shuffle stepped out I
[1:04:00] don't know how he got out of that grave
[1:04:01] but he was
[1:04:02] bound but something in him could respond
[1:04:06] to that voice anden it was there by
[1:04:09] predestination Lazarus didn't know it
[1:04:10] was there Lazarus didn't know it'd be
[1:04:12] resurrected Lazarus didn't know anything
[1:04:14] any more than you and I knew anything
[1:04:15] when we come to this life we were living
[1:04:17] whatever life we were living we had no
[1:04:19] power to do anything we didn't know that
[1:04:21] we were a chosen vessel to manifest the
[1:04:23] resurrected life of Jesus Christ we just
[1:04:25] thought we were Comm common human being
[1:04:26] like every other common human being but
[1:04:28] God before the foundation of the world
[1:04:30] had a specific purpose for
[1:04:32] Lazarus and he's had a specific purpose
[1:04:35] for you and
[1:04:36] I and he wants to manifest he's the
[1:04:39] resurrection and the
[1:04:42] life so now he says I'm going to go
[1:04:45] through some of this quote again but I
[1:04:47] want you to C catch the phrase his
[1:04:49] victory because this is his
[1:04:52] victory this is why it can't fail that's
[1:04:56] right there was no chance Lazarus was
[1:04:58] not coming up out of the
[1:05:01] Grave when Jesus come on the scene when
[1:05:04] Jesus waited 4 days he he knew what was
[1:05:06] going to happen when he delayed his
[1:05:08] return there was a purpose in it all
[1:05:10] when he got to the Grave he wasn't
[1:05:11] worried about what was going to happen
[1:05:13] he knew what was going to happen this
[1:05:14] was an appointment this is an
[1:05:16] appointment with Destiny this is
[1:05:18] predestination he knew there was no way
[1:05:21] Lazarus could miss coming
[1:05:24] forth and there was no way you and I
[1:05:26] could miss coming forth under this
[1:05:28] voice it's impossible we didn't know it
[1:05:32] he knew it we didn't decide it he
[1:05:34] decided it we were already dead in sins
[1:05:36] and trespasses but he came our way amen
[1:05:40] and somebody moved a stone away and we
[1:05:42] heard a call and when we heard the call
[1:05:44] there was something in us that could
[1:05:45] respond to the call because that was the
[1:05:47] purpose from the beginning God wanted a
[1:05:50] witness of the resurrection and Lazarus
[1:05:52] was that witness and now that witness
[1:05:55] became a threat to the system because
[1:05:57] they were coming to see one who was
[1:05:59] resurrected from the dead and they were
[1:06:01] believing in the one who resurrected him
[1:06:03] from the dead realize they weren't
[1:06:04] believing in Lazarus they were believing
[1:06:06] in the one who called his
[1:06:08] name and now people aren't believing in
[1:06:10] the bride they're not coming to us to
[1:06:12] say I believe they know there's nothing
[1:06:14] in me to believe in amen believe in the
[1:06:16] one who raised me from the dead believe
[1:06:18] in the one who gave me power by his
[1:06:20] power by his own Spirit to live a life I
[1:06:23] never was able to live on my own amen I
[1:06:25] was raised a Christian boy in a
[1:06:27] Christian home and went to church every
[1:06:29] Sunday of my life and every Wednesday my
[1:06:32] whole entire life and I wanted to be a
[1:06:34] good boy but I had absolutely no power
[1:06:37] to live the word and I found a cycle of
[1:06:39] Perpetual failure in my
[1:06:41] life but oh by the grace of God there
[1:06:44] was somebody who would tell me that old
[1:06:46] system is holding you down and they
[1:06:48] rolled a stone away and I heard the
[1:06:50] voice of the Resurrection in this
[1:06:52] message and it called me to life and by
[1:06:54] his power the resurrection power he
[1:06:57] resurrected me back not to what I was as
[1:07:00] a boy not growing up in a Pentecostal
[1:07:02] church he resurrected me back to my
[1:07:04] predestinated
[1:07:06] position back to what I was always
[1:07:08] intended to be a real believer of the
[1:07:13] word amen still stuck in a cur nature
[1:07:17] still making mistakes but there's
[1:07:18] another Power inside that's beyond the
[1:07:20] power of the Cocker nature that's beyond
[1:07:23] the power of the intellect it's the
[1:07:24] power of God I mean unto salvation
[1:07:27] that'll bring the life of God in our
[1:07:30] life that's the resurrection in the life
[1:07:34] and now that becomes the
[1:07:37] attraction why because where else is the
[1:07:40] power to live the word yes amen and when
[1:07:44] the church no longer has the power
[1:07:47] because they've left Christ they no
[1:07:49] longer have the power to manifest the
[1:07:51] word they change the
[1:07:54] word
[1:07:56] true because there is no power to
[1:07:58] overcome and to live as a Christian to
[1:08:00] live honest to live true to live humble
[1:08:03] to submit to the Commandments of the
[1:08:04] Lord because there's no power left there
[1:08:07] because the Holy Ghost has had to leave
[1:08:08] because they left the word now they
[1:08:10] start changing the word and now those
[1:08:12] things were for the apostles they don't
[1:08:14] count for us anymore that was for the
[1:08:15] church age we don't have to live by that
[1:08:17] anymore and what are they doing amen
[1:08:19] they're justifying the
[1:08:22] tombstone they're justifying the Stone
[1:08:26] they're justifying the death amen you
[1:08:29] know what they're justifying they're
[1:08:30] justifying the rot yeah amen of dead
[1:08:34] flesh
[1:08:38] right but we don't have to change the
[1:08:40] word amen the word is true it's always
[1:08:43] been true Jesus Christ spoke it it's
[1:08:46] been true if he spoke it to the Apostle
[1:08:47] Paul it's true it's always been true it
[1:08:49] always remains
[1:08:51] true and then that means it can be
[1:08:54] lived but it can't be lived by
[1:08:59] you God would never give a commandment
[1:09:02] that's impossible to
[1:09:03] keep the only problem is we can't keep
[1:09:10] it can't do it we can't we can't we
[1:09:15] can't overcome this
[1:09:17] flesh we can't do it so he made a
[1:09:21] mechanism where he could come and do it
[1:09:24] amen because he is the resurrection in
[1:09:27] the life and now the resurrection and
[1:09:30] the life can take up Abode that's what
[1:09:33] the whole purpose of the blood was he he
[1:09:35] purchased us with the blood so that he
[1:09:37] could sanctify us and that he could
[1:09:38] indwell us and it's Christ now in us
[1:09:41] living his own word amen it's the power
[1:09:43] of the Resurrection in a people
[1:09:46] today that'll actually live the
[1:09:51] Bible amen not in their own power and
[1:09:55] resurrection power so I want to read
[1:09:58] this again we are his
[1:10:00] victory the church is his
[1:10:03] victory do you know that when when you
[1:10:06] reject the false and take the true
[1:10:09] that's his victory right when you deny
[1:10:13] yourself and you take up your cross and
[1:10:15] follow him that's his victory because
[1:10:18] you didn't do that yourself there was
[1:10:20] another power that came in and gave you
[1:10:22] the power do you know that when when you
[1:10:24] submit to this message you submit to
[1:10:26] this word when you refuse to look at
[1:10:29] what you shouldn't look at when you
[1:10:30] refuse to say what you shouldn't say
[1:10:31] when you refuse to go the way of the
[1:10:33] world and you subject yourself to this
[1:10:35] word you know what that is that's his
[1:10:38] victory that's not your Victory that's
[1:10:40] his victory cuz you couldn't do
[1:10:42] it amen if it was left to us to have the
[1:10:45] victory there would be nothing but
[1:10:46] failure amen but the resurrection and
[1:10:48] life came in this day to dwell inside of
[1:10:51] us amen so that we could be his victory
[1:10:54] yes
[1:10:56] amen listen I I I don't know how to I I
[1:10:59] don't quite know how to share what's on
[1:11:01] my heart but if I could if God would
[1:11:03] just help me right now to share amen we
[1:11:05] get so beat down we get so beat up
[1:11:07] because of ourselves we get so
[1:11:09] discouraged because of our own flesh and
[1:11:11] the man in the mirror and the mistakes
[1:11:12] that we make and and we we we fail all
[1:11:15] the time and we get beat down to the
[1:11:17] point we feel like we're nothing we're
[1:11:18] just worms and we're and we're no good
[1:11:20] and we'll never amount to anything and
[1:11:22] in one sense of the word that's true
[1:11:26] but the problem is if you keep your eyes
[1:11:27] on that amen you're going to deny Christ
[1:11:30] his victory because he doesn't want you
[1:11:31] to be a beat down no good nothing worm
[1:11:34] he wants to come in you and he wants to
[1:11:36] have a victory in that flesh that flesh
[1:11:39] that's no good that flesh that's hybrid
[1:11:40] that flesh has fallen he wants to
[1:11:42] display to the world that he's got the
[1:11:44] keeping power that you can keep that you
[1:11:47] can live that you can Manifest this word
[1:11:49] it has to be on display
[1:11:52] somewhere that's his victory yes sir so
[1:11:55] many times we we get in the moly Grump
[1:11:57] so bad because we can't do it we fail
[1:11:59] listen stop looking at yourself and
[1:12:02] start looking at the word and start
[1:12:03] looking at who came in this generation
[1:12:06] and he's here what does he need he needs
[1:12:08] somebody who will surrender their life
[1:12:10] and say I'm done taking my thinking I'm
[1:12:12] done taking my ways I'm done trying to
[1:12:14] have it my way Lord I surrender all to
[1:12:16] you so that the Resurrection Life can
[1:12:18] come and manifest itself and that
[1:12:21] becomes the attraction to attract them
[1:12:22] to Christ that becomes the threat and
[1:12:25] that becomes his
[1:12:28] victory
[1:12:31] hallelujah it's his
[1:12:34] victory Lord I have no confidence in
[1:12:37] myself but I have absolute confidence
[1:12:40] I'll make
[1:12:41] it that's not confidence in myself
[1:12:43] that's confidence in his
[1:12:45] word left to myself I'll ruin it he
[1:12:49] didn't leave it to
[1:12:52] myself he didn't leave it to Lazarus
[1:12:56] he didn't leave it to Lazarus to
[1:12:58] resurrect himself to breathe Breath of
[1:13:00] Life back into
[1:13:01] himself he took care of that
[1:13:06] part we are his victory can't hardly get
[1:13:09] past that
[1:13:11] statement if there's anything that
[1:13:13] should make us sing and dance it's this
[1:13:16] we are his victory he is going to have
[1:13:18] victory in this day and that Victory is
[1:13:19] going to be in flesh and it's going to
[1:13:21] be in Fallen human no good flesh that's
[1:13:23] failed a thousand times but it's not
[1:13:25] always going to fail it's going to
[1:13:27] overcome it's going to manifest the life
[1:13:29] it's going to be a real genuine
[1:13:31] Christian because Christ is going to be
[1:13:33] on the inside making sure that he has
[1:13:35] his
[1:13:36] victory he's not going to be
[1:13:41] defeated God had his
[1:13:44] Eden Satan slipped in and through the
[1:13:46] woman he ruined God's
[1:13:49] Eden now Satan's built his own Eden so
[1:13:53] now God slipped in
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] and through another woman he's going to
[1:13:58] restore destroy Satan's
[1:14:00] eeden it'll be him and
[1:14:02] her that Kingdom's coming down because
[1:14:06] Christ is here but he's where he slipped
[1:14:08] in
[1:14:10] unawares where's he at he's the
[1:14:13] resurrection and he's the
[1:14:16] life amen the church is his
[1:14:19] victory we come forth in the last days
[1:14:21] with the Glorious gospel showing his
[1:14:23] victory he died for this Purp purpose
[1:14:25] and we are proof of his victory amen
[1:14:28] when we see him coming down and living
[1:14:30] among the church that's his victory
[1:14:33] shows that he he couldn't they couldn't
[1:14:36] keep him in the grave neither can they
[1:14:37] keep us and we're already potentially
[1:14:41] arise because we've raised from the dead
[1:14:43] unbelief in his word from a
[1:14:45] denominational Creeds to an eternal word
[1:14:47] of the Eternal God which is him hisself
[1:14:50] working through US manifesting himself
[1:14:54] that he is the same yet yesterday today
[1:14:56] and forever amen what part of that can
[1:15:01] fail let me read that again
[1:15:04] amen he he's brought us from the
[1:15:06] unbelief in his word from the
[1:15:08] denominational creas to an eternal word
[1:15:10] of the Eternal God which is him hisself
[1:15:14] working through US manifesting himself
[1:15:17] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:15:18] forever how can that fail amen it's him
[1:15:23] himself praise God am and when the word
[1:15:26] moves on down into the body from the
[1:15:28] head what is it the same word nothing
[1:15:30] can be added or taken from it so that
[1:15:33] same word moves from the head as the day
[1:15:35] comes close down into the body down uh
[1:15:38] down into the body vindicating that they
[1:15:40] are one they are husband and wife they
[1:15:42] are flesh of his flesh word of his word
[1:15:44] life of his life Spirit of his Spirit
[1:15:46] see amen how do you know it Bears the
[1:15:48] same record same fruit same word
[1:15:51] manifest Christ same life same God Same
[1:15:54] Spirit same word same book amen same
[1:15:57] signs the things that I do shall you
[1:15:59] also oh Hallelujah my notice the
[1:16:02] Vindicated word in his body is his
[1:16:05] victory and the reason of his
[1:16:08] death why did he die so that he could
[1:16:10] have victory in you so he could sanctify
[1:16:13] a bride so that he could come and dwell
[1:16:15] inside of it and here in the end time
[1:16:18] amen he can come and full measure
[1:16:19] because the full word has been restored
[1:16:21] and there's a purifying water to wash us
[1:16:23] from all the filth of the prostit and
[1:16:25] bring us back to that virgin condition
[1:16:27] when he was given a virgin fresh from
[1:16:30] Pentecost so why he could come and
[1:16:32] indwell so why he could have the
[1:16:36] victory praise
[1:16:38] God we we don't get credit for this
[1:16:42] one I'm
[1:16:44] thankful because if there's something I
[1:16:46] can do that would get me credit I'd be
[1:16:48] sure to ruin
[1:16:53] it praise God
[1:16:56] Ephesians 2:8 says for by grace are you
[1:16:58] saved through faith and that not of
[1:17:01] yourselves yes it is the gift of
[1:17:05] God what did you do well I
[1:17:08] believed well good for you how did you
[1:17:12] believe you were given a gift of
[1:17:16] faith well I I mean sometimes I I I I
[1:17:21] don't understand sometimes the way we
[1:17:23] say things I I I don't mean that anybody
[1:17:25] else I'm pointing at myself CU I don't
[1:17:26] like the way I've said things
[1:17:29] sometimes we tend to get a little bit
[1:17:31] hotty sometimes say well I believe every
[1:17:34] word well praise
[1:17:36] God that's his
[1:17:39] victory you had no capacity to believe
[1:17:42] the word by your brain you had no
[1:17:44] capacity by your human will it was a
[1:17:46] gift of faith that was given by
[1:17:49] Grace so we say well well I believe well
[1:17:53] good you you just proved that he had
[1:17:56] victory in you but we say it as if like
[1:17:59] we did something
[1:18:01] special well I'll tell you it's
[1:18:02] something special because it's so
[1:18:04] impossible for people to believe the
[1:18:06] word it is something special but it's
[1:18:08] his victory not
[1:18:11] ours says no man can come to me except
[1:18:14] the Father which has sent him draw him
[1:18:17] and I will raise him up at the last
[1:18:19] days hey we're in the last
[1:18:22] days you can't even come unless he draws
[1:18:25] that's right this isn't our will it's
[1:18:27] his will this isn't our doing it's his
[1:18:29] doing and it's not that we don't want
[1:18:30] him to do it we want so bad for him to
[1:18:32] do it but you can want all you want but
[1:18:34] without him wanting your want means
[1:18:36] nothing that's right it's got to be his
[1:18:39] desire that's his victory again in
[1:18:43] Christ as the mystery of God revealed he
[1:18:44] says he proves his resurrection life
[1:18:46] then as he vindicates himself she the
[1:18:50] bride is independent from all others
[1:18:51] she's an independent woman a Great
[1:18:53] Speckled Bird that different from all
[1:18:55] others you remember the Bible on that
[1:18:57] The Great Speckled Bird comes out of
[1:19:01] Leviticus says but she had his name she
[1:19:04] had his life how did they speckle the
[1:19:07] bird they were both white and then they
[1:19:09] pulled the head off of one bird and
[1:19:10] drained the blood out upon the other
[1:19:12] bird and the other bird was speckled
[1:19:14] with the red blood and it flopped its
[1:19:16] wings like this and the blood cried holy
[1:19:19] holy holy as it bathed the ground this
[1:19:22] was a sign that was given for the CL for
[1:19:24] the cleansing of leprosy which is the
[1:19:27] cleansing of sin leprosy is a type of
[1:19:29] sin and in the levitical order they
[1:19:32] would take take two Turtle does and they
[1:19:35] would take the head off of one and drain
[1:19:37] they take a mate and they drain the
[1:19:38] blood of one mate onto the other and it
[1:19:40] would spreckle it crimson and it would
[1:19:42] go flying and it would go free because
[1:19:44] the sacrifice of one freed the other the
[1:19:48] blood from one now was upon the other
[1:19:51] and the blood when the blood came upon
[1:19:52] the other the other could go free cuz
[1:19:54] one sacrifice for the free but as the
[1:19:56] Free Bird went it was testifying to the
[1:20:00] world that the blood is Holy Holy Holy
[1:20:03] unto the Lord it's sprinkling the blood
[1:20:05] which is the life of the animal because
[1:20:08] God said the life is in the blood the
[1:20:10] blood is given for the
[1:20:11] life so now that bird and he says now
[1:20:14] the Bride is a Great Speckled Bird he
[1:20:16] sacrificed his life he washed her in his
[1:20:19] own blood amen but now she goes free
[1:20:22] because of his sacrifice but her freedom
[1:20:24] is is a testimony that he gave his life
[1:20:27] and now his life is upon her and as she
[1:20:30] goes she's sprinkling his life all over
[1:20:32] the ground as she flies that's the
[1:20:35] purpose of the bird going free is
[1:20:37] testifying of the life of the dead bird
[1:20:40] amen what are we supposed to be doing
[1:20:42] testifying of the life of Jesus Christ
[1:20:44] the one who shed his blood for me his
[1:20:46] life now is in me his blood life is now
[1:20:50] upon me amen and it's supposed to be
[1:20:52] sprinkled off of me as I move in into
[1:20:54] this world and that sprinkling of the
[1:20:56] blood which is the life should be
[1:20:58] declaring holy holy holy is the
[1:21:02] Lord why because this is his doing that
[1:21:05] little pigeon had nothing to do with it
[1:21:07] amen that little pigeon was just the
[1:21:09] recipient amen it didn't have the power
[1:21:12] to cleanse itself it didn't have the
[1:21:13] power to set itself free it was bound
[1:21:15] but it was the dead mates life that set
[1:21:17] it free amen we had no power to set
[1:21:20] ourselves free we had no power to
[1:21:22] overcome but it was our m who gave his
[1:21:25] life for us that set us free and it's
[1:21:27] his blood that freed us and it's his
[1:21:29] life that's being declared in
[1:21:32] ours praise
[1:21:35] God says so Christ the dead mate put his
[1:21:37] blood his blood from his life sprinkled
[1:21:41] carrying his blood crying holy holy holy
[1:21:43] unto the Lord it's an odd-looking bird
[1:21:46] sure it is but she the bride is
[1:21:49] identified by him and she is independent
[1:21:53] from all others amen I love that
[1:21:56] statement she's
[1:21:58] identified by
[1:22:00] him because he put his life in
[1:22:05] her and she is independent from all
[1:22:10] others her dependency is not on an
[1:22:13] organization not on a system her
[1:22:16] dependency is not even on another human
[1:22:19] being but she is dependent only upon him
[1:22:25] let's go to Second Peter chapter 1 now I
[1:22:28] want to look at another aspect or
[1:22:30] another
[1:22:31] phase of this that we're speaking
[1:22:38] of second Peter chapter
[1:22:46] 1 second Peter chap 1 verse
[1:22:53] 2

[1:23:14] godliness how did we get all things that
[1:23:16] pertain to life and godliness yes his
[1:23:19] divine power let's read that again
[1:23:22] according as his divine power
[1:23:25] hath given us all things that pertain
[1:23:26] unto life and godliness did you ever get
[1:23:29] it of your own power it was his divine
[1:23:32] power through the knowledge of him that
[1:23:35] hath called us to glory and virtue what
[1:23:38] did he call us to glory and virtue amen
[1:23:42] praise
[1:23:43] God whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:23:46] great and precious promises that by
[1:23:49] these what's these the precious promises
[1:23:53] ye might be be partakers of the divine
[1:23:56] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:23:58] that is in the world through lust and
[1:24:00] beside this give all diligence add to
[1:24:02] your faith virtue and The Virtue
[1:24:04] knowledge the knowledge Temperance and
[1:24:06] the temperance patience and patience

[1:24:14] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:24:16] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:24:18] of our Lord Jesus Christ let's go back
[1:24:21] to verse four now we know that this is
[1:24:23] the divine nature and the divine nature
[1:24:26] he begins to give us eight attributes of
[1:24:28] the divine nature with the eighth being
[1:24:30] love Godly love charity the capping
[1:24:33] Stone and when brother bam comes and
[1:24:35] preaches this he preaches it and the
[1:24:38] statue of a perfect man showing that
[1:24:40] this is the building up into the head in
[1:24:42] all things which is Christ this is
[1:24:44] coming to the stature of a perfect man
[1:24:46] unto adoption and so the divine nature
[1:24:50] is what we're growing into growing into
[1:24:52] Christ
[1:24:53] likeness
[1:24:54] and and he says here uh in verse four
[1:24:58] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:25:00] great and precious promises that by
[1:25:02] these the promises you might be
[1:25:05] partakers of the divine nature how are
[1:25:07] you going to be a partaker of the divine
[1:25:09] nature because he promised it to
[1:25:11] youen not because of your straining and
[1:25:14] your work and your labor and you're
[1:25:15] being a good boy and you're starting
[1:25:17] back at zero and climbing the ladder
[1:25:19] again and falling off it has nothing to
[1:25:21] do with that it's the precious promises
[1:25:22] that have declared it to you that's
[1:25:24] right right that by these the precious
[1:25:27] promises you might be partakers of the
[1:25:30] divine nature having escaped the
[1:25:32] corruption that is in the world through
[1:25:34] lust I want to look at this world word
[1:25:37] partakers when I looked up the word
[1:25:40] partakers it means a partaker a
[1:25:44] partner a fellowship a
[1:25:46] companion a partner an associate a
[1:25:49] comrade a companion a partner a sharer
[1:25:53] in anything
[1:25:55] so what are we partakers our partners
[1:25:58] our comrades our companions in the
[1:26:02] divine
[1:26:03] nature well you mean we have a share in
[1:26:06] the divine nature yes we can share in
[1:26:09] the divine nature how by the precious
[1:26:11] promises according to his divine power
[1:26:14] has made it possible for us to be our

[1:28:57] can't look at that because we'll always
[1:29:00] be
[1:29:01] discouraged but we got to look at what
[1:29:03] he's pointing us to and what his goal in
[1:29:05] our life is his goal is to bring us into
[1:29:08] perfect love into the Capstone his goal

[1:29:13] so that the Resurrection Life is seen in
[1:29:15] you and I that's his victory that's his
[1:29:19] purpose and that's the reason of his
[1:29:21] death amen his death is not in vain
[1:29:24] friends he didn't die in vain he didn't
[1:29:26] die hoping that somebody will finally
[1:29:28] achieve it he died knowing that you have
[1:29:30] a part in the divine nature he Divine
[1:29:32] knowing there's precious promises to
[1:29:34] bring you into that divine nature you

[1:29:37] times and you may have to bump your toe
[1:29:39] a few times but you're going to make it
[1:29:41] because it's his will that's stronger
[1:29:43] than your
[1:29:44] will if we could just look at that and
[1:29:47] be encouraged yes be ashamed of yourself
[1:29:49] but let that shame move you back into
[1:29:51] the word and say God I can't trust my
[1:29:53] thoughts I can't trust my feelings I
[1:29:55] can't trust what another human being
[1:29:56] tells me but I trust this word and by
[1:29:59] your power I know that I'm a partaker of
[1:30:02] the divine nature and I have a share in
[1:30:03] it and I'm moving towards that I don't
[1:30:05] know when I'll get there I don't know
[1:30:07] how I'll get there but I believe that
[1:30:09] I'll get there because remember friends
[1:30:11] everything in the kingdom of God is
[1:30:12] acquired by faith it's got to be Quicken
[1:30:14] to you that you belong
[1:30:17] there something in this word has to
[1:30:19] unlock something in you and say I'm not
[1:30:22] born to be an outcast I'm not born to be
[1:30:24] a second class I'm not born to always be
[1:30:27] a failure but he placed me here to be
[1:30:29] his victory so his victory can be in me
[1:30:33] and what a greater Victory than somebody
[1:30:35] that's dead and rotten and stinking
[1:30:40] yeah you say brother tell you don't know
[1:30:43] how bad I am praise God what a
[1:30:46] victory sir
[1:30:50] am we're all
[1:30:52] bad
[1:30:54] he's the one who's good that's why it's
[1:30:57] his victory not
[1:31:01] ours in the message live from 58 he says
[1:31:04] now the Christian church should have
[1:31:06] real character
[1:31:08] then I just love this if the Life of
[1:31:11] Christ is in the Church of Christ then
[1:31:13] it's got to have the character of Christ
[1:31:15] it'll Pro produce the Life of Christ
[1:31:18] it's just no more than just what we call
[1:31:20] in the South Common Sense if the life of
[1:31:23] the spirit of Christ Christ is in the
[1:31:24] church it has to produce that life
[1:31:27] because the life that's in you makes
[1:31:29] your
[1:31:31] character brother brenon made it real
[1:31:34] simple if the life of Beethoven was in
[1:31:37] me I would compose music because that's
[1:31:40] the life that's in me it made so simple
[1:31:43] but if the Life of Christ is in me then
[1:31:45] I'll keep the father's word because he
[1:31:47] kept the father's word amen not by my
[1:31:51] life but his life in me if toan's life
[1:31:54] was in me and I composed a piece of
[1:31:56] music I mean how much pride could I take
[1:31:58] in
[1:31:59] that it was the other life that was in
[1:32:02] me amen right it wasn't
[1:32:05] me praise God Amen but if his life is in
[1:32:09] me he'll keep his word because when he
[1:32:13] was here in flesh he kept his word and
[1:32:14] now he's coming back in flesh to keep
[1:32:16] his
[1:32:17] word cu the bride will stay on the word
[1:32:19] and the word alone amen by his power
[1:32:25] in the marriage of the Lamb he says I
[1:32:26] believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:28] I believe in speaking in tongues but I
[1:32:30] think we lay too much emphasis on that a
[1:32:33] man can speak with tongues and a woman
[1:32:34] speak with tongues and if her life and
[1:32:36] his life doesn't compare with what the
[1:32:38] tongues you're speaking in then it's the
[1:32:39] wrong tongue cuz the holy spirit will
[1:32:42] make you act like the Bible it'll bring
[1:32:45] you to the fullness of the stature of
[1:32:47] Christ amen oh praise be to God now
[1:32:51] listen to what he says you take a person
[1:32:53] that speaks with tongues enough temper
[1:32:55] to fight a bustle and talk about the
[1:32:57] neighbors and everything like that why
[1:32:59] you call that the Holy Ghost it cannot
[1:33:01] be no sir the Holy Ghost is meekness joy
[1:33:04] peace longsuffering goodness gentleness
[1:33:06] patience Faith the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:33:08] fruit of the spirit that the Holy Spirit
[1:33:11] bears in the Church of the Living God's
[1:33:13] sweetness and humbleness humility love
[1:33:15] one for another and
[1:33:17] longsuffering it's not our power it's
[1:33:20] the power of the Holy Ghost but but we
[1:33:22] also can't be deceived in ourselves no
[1:33:24] matter no matter how many how many
[1:33:27] things we understand in the message and
[1:33:29] how much we've produced and how many
[1:33:31] testimonies we have amen that listen
[1:33:34] that Holy Ghost is to bring us into the
[1:33:36] stature of a perfect man amen
[1:33:40] right we can say I believe this and I
[1:33:43] believe that and I understand this and I
[1:33:44] understand that but enough temper to
[1:33:46] fight a buff stall and go around talk
[1:33:47] about the neighbors and gossip and
[1:33:49] backbite and all these other things no
[1:33:51] we've got something wrong amen there's
[1:33:53] something missing somewhere because the
[1:33:54] Holy Ghost that'll give you a revelation
[1:33:56] on the word is the same Holy Ghost
[1:33:57] making you a partaker of the divine
[1:34:00] nature so we got we can't get things
[1:34:02] discombobulated here we got we got to
[1:34:04] keep things in order we we we we may
[1:34:07] have an intellectual understanding of
[1:34:09] some few things but the reality has to
[1:34:11] be the
[1:34:12] life the life has to be manifest the
[1:34:15] life has to be lived there's no
[1:34:18] substitute for it yes he says again and
[1:34:21] that's and that's the way God does the
[1:34:23] church he beats every Creed every
[1:34:25] denomination every man-made Dogma until
[1:34:27] he sees his own life reflecting in you
[1:34:29] he's talking about the old gold smelter
[1:34:32] who used to beat the gold to get all the
[1:34:33] dross out of it until it becomes shiny
[1:34:35] and smooth and mirrorlike you can see
[1:34:37] his own reflection and he beat it and he
[1:34:39] beat it till he had his reflection in
[1:34:41] the gold and he's talking about that's
[1:34:43] what Christ is doing now to his church
[1:34:45] he's knocking out all of the world and
[1:34:47] knocking on everything that's unlike him
[1:34:48] until he can see his own reflection amen
[1:34:52] amen he says he sees his own life
[1:34:54] reflecting in you if I do not the works
[1:34:57] of my father believe me not see if what
[1:35:00] what is
[1:35:03] purpose what is purpose to the church
[1:35:05] the life that was in Christ isn't
[1:35:07] reflecting in you don't you stand still
[1:35:10] if you haven't got patience virtue all
[1:35:12] these things and Temperance and things
[1:35:14] and godliness and brotherly kindness and
[1:35:16] all these things that's required of you
[1:35:18] no matter what you've done no matter how
[1:35:20] much you shouted how much churches
[1:35:22] you've joined how many feathers you've
[1:35:24] pinned into yourself don't do it wait
[1:35:26] till genuinely from your heart you can
[1:35:28] forgive till in your heart you have
[1:35:31] brotherly
[1:35:35] kindness the reason I'm reading this is
[1:35:37] because I want us to
[1:35:38] recognize that there's something we're
[1:35:40] striving for there's something we're
[1:35:42] surrendering for the we don't want to
[1:35:44] get caught up in the wrong thing amen
[1:35:46] we're not here to manifest the most
[1:35:48] works in the world because there's other
[1:35:50] churches that can manifest Works amen
[1:35:52] but the works without the life breeds
[1:35:54] confusion amen we want the works but we
[1:35:57] must have the
[1:35:58] life we must have the the the stature of
[1:36:02] a perfect man we have must have the
[1:36:03] divine nature on
[1:36:05] display with all the works and the
[1:36:09] manifestations we're not what are the
[1:36:12] question is what are we looking for in
[1:36:13] our lives what are we hoping for what is
[1:36:15] our goal what are we Desiring to have
[1:36:18] happened or we are we're we're hoping to
[1:36:20] to have a great manifestation so that we
[1:36:22] can show that that did this and and and
[1:36:25] I I laid hands on them and they were
[1:36:26] healed and Hey listen there's all kinds
[1:36:28] of people in the world laying hands on
[1:36:30] sick and they're being healed it's
[1:36:31] happening friends all kinds of
[1:36:34] manifestations Amen but then deny the
[1:36:36] word and then live compromised lives and
[1:36:39] what's the point of raising the dead if
[1:36:41] you're embezzling money from a widow
[1:36:45] yeah so you rais the dead proving that
[1:36:47] you're a Christian but you embezzled
[1:36:49] money from a widow in the church proving
[1:36:51] that you
[1:36:52] weren't
[1:36:56] what is it if you can have a great
[1:36:58] campaign and you can heal all kinds amen
[1:37:01] but you're caught in
[1:37:06] fornication what needs to be underlying
[1:37:08] at all is the divine nature amen what
[1:37:11] God has promised for us and that's what
[1:37:13] we're striving for amen God will produce
[1:37:15] his own Works God will produce his own
[1:37:17] life but if we don't have that meekness
[1:37:19] and Temperance that's where we need to
[1:37:20] lay in prayer and say I don't need some
[1:37:23] big sign I need more faith I need more
[1:37:25] Temperance I need more patience in my
[1:37:27] life God come and take out this old
[1:37:29] nature and put your nature inside of me
[1:37:32] I need patience I need brotherly kind
[1:37:35] God I'm lacking in these things that you
[1:37:37] promised I can have and I'm holding on
[1:37:39] to your promise by faith that you'll put
[1:37:41] it in me but God I'm laying here on the
[1:37:43] altar saying I need the divine nature I
[1:37:46] need more Temperance in my life I'm I'm
[1:37:49] lacking control I keep falling into the
[1:37:51] same sins because I lack temperance it
[1:37:53] self-control God come and put your
[1:37:55] self-control inside of
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:00] me I think many times we could get false
[1:38:03] hope in the wrong thing
[1:38:06] yeah I believe the message and I know
[1:38:08] God sent a prophet
[1:38:11] and where's the divine
[1:38:15] nature what I want more than anything in
[1:38:18] my life is for Christ to live in
[1:38:22] me if I never have a testimony to
[1:38:25] produce to prove to you as long as he
[1:38:28] puts in Me Faith and Temperance and
[1:38:30] patience and kindness and brotherly
[1:38:32] kindness and and
[1:38:35] love that's what I want the divine
[1:38:39] nature he'll take care of everything
[1:38:43] else nothing's going to miss a beat he's
[1:38:46] going to heal the sick he's going to
[1:38:48] deliver The Afflicted he's going to work
[1:38:50] signs and miracles because he promised
[1:38:52] that in his church yeah
[1:38:55] but what I'm striving for more than
[1:38:56] anything is to lay my life down and let
[1:39:00] him work his divine nature into me and
[1:39:04] I'm holding on to it by a
[1:39:07] promise God you promis this and I live
[1:39:11] in the age that it's going to be
[1:39:14] manifest I believe that how could we not
[1:39:17] believe that God already sent the
[1:39:18] prophet every end time sign has been
[1:39:20] shed amen this is the age when he's
[1:39:24] going to bring his church into the
[1:39:25] statue of a perfect man he's capping her
[1:39:27] off now with Divine love he's he's
[1:39:30] uniting himself the headship has come
[1:39:32] down to unite with the bride I this is
[1:39:34] the age for the manifestation I'm not
[1:39:36] going to be settled until I can see that
[1:39:39] life working in me and I'm going to stay
[1:39:41] on the Altar and keep climbing back on
[1:39:43] the Altar and saying God I want what you
[1:39:45] promised me Lord I need you to come and
[1:39:48] have your Victory inside of
[1:39:50] me what is it it's the res Resurrection
[1:39:53] in the Life what Resurrection amen the
[1:39:57] same
[1:39:58] life
[1:40:01] resurrected not a different life the
[1:40:03] same life what life the predestinated
[1:40:05] life the C Gene of God brother B says in
[1:40:09] perfect strength and by Perfect weakness
[1:40:12] so when I get everything out of me then
[1:40:14] God can come
[1:40:15] in but as long as I got some of myself
[1:40:19] there then God can't get
[1:40:21] in my listen carefully to this
[1:40:25] quote that's it we smother him out we
[1:40:29] drive him away that from the poorest of
[1:40:32] us to the richest of us from the least
[1:40:34] to the greatest we keep God out of our
[1:40:37] Lives because of our own
[1:40:42] selves that just floored
[1:40:45] me from the poorest of us to the richest
[1:40:49] of us from the least to the greatest we
[1:40:52] keep God out of our lives because of his
[1:40:54] our own
[1:40:55] selves brother Chad where did all that
[1:40:57] preaching go say it's his will he's
[1:40:59] going to do it's not you doing it don't
[1:41:01] forget that God never trumps free moral
[1:41:06] agency all he needs is a surrendered
[1:41:09] vessel and he'll do all the work
[1:41:11] amen all he needs is somebody that'll
[1:41:14] lay their life down even Jesus Christ
[1:41:16] had to go to Gethsemane and he had to
[1:41:18] wrestle with his own will and his own
[1:41:20] flesh until he could surrender it to God
[1:41:22] Amen
[1:41:24] amen even in the resurrection of Lazarus
[1:41:27] somebody had to roll the stone away and
[1:41:29] somebody had to unbind his grave
[1:41:31] clothes and in this great promise of the
[1:41:34] divine nature somebody's got to get
[1:41:37] themselves out of the way somebody's got
[1:41:39] to die to themselves and
[1:41:43] surrender
[1:41:45] Amen brother R goes on to say I've often
[1:41:47] said the greatest enemy I got is William
[1:41:50] Brandon he's the one that gets in God's
[1:41:52] way
[1:41:54] he's the one that gets lazy he's the one
[1:41:55] that gets to a place sometimes where he
[1:41:57] thinks he can do something about it if
[1:42:00] I'm guilty of anything it's all of the
[1:42:03] above and when he does that shoves God
[1:42:06] right out of the
[1:42:07] picture but when I can get rid of that
[1:42:10] guy when I can get to a place that he's
[1:42:12] out of the way then God can come over
[1:42:15] and do things that William brandham
[1:42:16] knows nothing
[1:42:18] about oh that's what I want I want to
[1:42:20] get to the place where he comes and do
[1:42:22] things I don't know nothing
[1:42:24] about you know nothing I've ever thought
[1:42:26] of you know it wasn't brother Brenham
[1:42:28] who thought of creating squirrels that
[1:42:30] was God who told him to do it God did
[1:42:32] something he didn't know anything about
[1:42:34] God did something he wasn't even
[1:42:36] planning for God come and did it by his
[1:42:38] own instruction amen what did that man
[1:42:40] need to do get out of the way what do I
[1:42:42] need to do get out of the way what do I
[1:42:44] need to do die to myself and we say that
[1:42:46] all the time die to yourself it's great
[1:42:48] it's great to die to yourself but
[1:42:50] sometimes God has to show you what part
[1:42:52] of yourself you need to die to I don't
[1:42:54] even know what to die to sometimes I
[1:42:56] know I need more death but what do I
[1:42:57] need to die
[1:42:59] to oh and then God and His grace will
[1:43:02] allow a circumstance to come up and
[1:43:04] you'll realize oh my goodness that's
[1:43:05] what I need to die to that's the thing
[1:43:07] that's still hindering
[1:43:09] me I need to lay down my wants I need to
[1:43:12] lay down my desires I need to lay down
[1:43:14] my self-preservation I need to lay down
[1:43:16] my self-
[1:43:19] protection what do we need to get rid of
[1:43:22] we need to get rid of self
[1:43:25] so he can
[1:43:27] come and have his victory
[1:43:31] yes what do we need we need less of me
[1:43:35] and more of
[1:43:37] him much much less of
[1:43:42] me said but when I can get rid of that
[1:43:45] guy when I can get to a place that he's
[1:43:48] out of the way then God can come over
[1:43:49] and do things that William brandham
[1:43:51] knows nothing about that's when God can
[1:43:53] use you that's when God can use any of
[1:43:55] you he can use anybody when we get out
[1:43:58] of the way but as long as we got
[1:44:00] ourselves in the way then we
[1:44:03] cannot you know what happens when you
[1:44:05] get yourself out of the way and God
[1:44:06] comes and does it you have no heart to
[1:44:09] take any credit for
[1:44:11] it you have no heart to steal his
[1:44:15] victory and hijack it and make it your
[1:44:18] own source of
[1:44:22] pride amen it's a shame that that's
[1:44:25] happened so many times God brings a
[1:44:29] victory and we hijack his victory we
[1:44:33] make it our Victory and we get puffed up
[1:44:35] and become proud because we had victory
[1:44:38] that we didn't win
[1:44:41] ourselves sometimes we just got to get
[1:44:43] ourselves out of the way so that Chad
[1:44:45] Lam's not even thought of so that he can
[1:44:48] come and do things that I've never
[1:44:50] thought of so he can come in you and do
[1:44:53] things that you've never thought of
[1:44:55] that's what I want I want I want like
[1:44:59] brother said I want to be standing near
[1:45:01] when he does those things
[1:45:04] am he says in looking unto Jesus he says
[1:45:07] I would like to say one thing just
[1:45:08] before we pray for the sick many people
[1:45:10] have the wrong impression about a gift a
[1:45:13] gift is not something that God gives you
[1:45:14] to go out and say here I'll go over here
[1:45:16] and pick out this and I'll take that and
[1:45:18] do this that's not gifts so many people
[1:45:20] think that but they're wrongly impressed
[1:45:23] a gift of God is just to know how to get
[1:45:25] yourself out of the way so God can use
[1:45:27] you that's all a gift is as long as
[1:45:30] you're in yourself didn't Jesus say
[1:45:33] himself the son can do St John M 5:19
[1:45:36] verily very say unto you the son can do
[1:45:37] nothing in himself he passed by the pool
[1:45:40] that where all the cripples was and
[1:45:41] healed one man with prostate trouble or
[1:45:43] something a disease he said the son can
[1:45:47] do nothing in himself but what he sees
[1:45:48] the father doing that doeth the son
[1:45:50] likewise it's not me he said that doeth
[1:45:53] the works it's my father that dwelleth
[1:45:54] in me he doeth the works now you people
[1:45:57] sitting here there don't sorry now you
[1:46:01] people sitting out there don't you dare
[1:46:03] look to a man you look to Christ he's
[1:46:05] the one but he promised in the last days
[1:46:08] that he would manifest himself in human
[1:46:09] flesh like he did here at Sodom now your
[1:46:12] flesh My Flesh let us just open our
[1:46:14] hearts and get our own thinking away and
[1:46:17] just let the word take his course
[1:46:18] tonight in us then we'll see God's great
[1:46:21] gifts of his spirit manifesting before
[1:46:24] us what I want to do I want to get
[1:46:26] myself out of the way where I'm not even
[1:46:28] in the picture at all because I want
[1:46:30] this to be his
[1:46:32] victory I want it to be so much his
[1:46:34] victory that that you know when brother
[1:46:37] brandham comes to the end of the seals
[1:46:39] he says now don't say thank you to no
[1:46:41] man cuz no man did this he said I had no
[1:46:44] more idea what they were no more than
[1:46:46] nothing amen God just come to him day by
[1:46:49] day and gave him the Revelation and then
[1:46:51] he searched it out through the
[1:46:51] scriptures and he comes to the end of
[1:46:53] the seals and he wants you to know very
[1:46:55] clearly that that didn't come from his
[1:46:56] mind that wasn't him he had no ability
[1:46:59] to do that that was all God oh God let
[1:47:02] the Bride come to that position amen
[1:47:04] where we can be his victory it can be
[1:47:06] his victory in us where will it be in US
[1:47:10] absolutely but he's not going to share
[1:47:12] the glory with us we've got to get out
[1:47:14] of the way so he gets all the
[1:47:18] glory I can imagine Lazarus saying that
[1:47:21] was pretty neat how I rose out of the
[1:47:23] dead rose from the dead wasn't
[1:47:26] it come
[1:47:28] on I was just laying there
[1:47:37] thinking we were dead in sins and
[1:47:40] trespasses alienated from God our minds
[1:47:42] darkened to the things of God and God
[1:47:45] come and called us by name amen God put
[1:47:48] his Resurrection Life inside of us amen
[1:47:51] and then we can say well I just read the
[1:47:53] message and it made sense to
[1:47:58] me no God had a predestinated seed of
[1:48:01] Faith laying in your heart that he
[1:48:03] placed there before the foundation of
[1:48:05] the world and in due time he came along
[1:48:08] to your grave and he called your name
[1:48:13] and you came forth and now you're here
[1:48:16] to testify of his victory of his power
[1:48:20] you're here to testify that the
[1:48:21] resurrection power is on Earth
[1:48:24] today to resurrect a people to be what
[1:48:28] they were intended to be from Pentecost
[1:48:31] on the Pentecost come forth right but
[1:48:34] they failed before they made the
[1:48:35] destination but this bride is coming
[1:48:38] back to that condition not to fail but
[1:48:40] to move on and finish the journey amen
[1:48:44] why because of his divine power that's
[1:48:46] been given to make us partakers of the
[1:48:49] divine
[1:48:50] nature God is going to have the
[1:48:54] victory he
[1:48:56] tells he tells in Zachariah tells Z
[1:48:59] zerubabel not by might nor by power but
[1:49:03] by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:49:06] not by might nor by power you're not
[1:49:08] going to do this by Will you're not
[1:49:11] going to do this by self-restraint
[1:49:13] you're not going to do this by
[1:49:14] self-control amen it's going to be by a
[1:49:17] spirit what do we need we need a
[1:49:20] spirit but Jesus said to his
[1:49:23] disciples I will not leave you
[1:49:27] comfortless I will come to
[1:49:30] you that's the promise that's what
[1:49:32] Pentecost was all
[1:49:34] about listen Pentecost was not all about
[1:49:37] signs and wonders and all that that that
[1:49:39] comes with it that's the alc but it was
[1:49:41] all about Christ coming back to his
[1:49:44] church so I will not leave you
[1:49:45] comfortless but I will come to you and
[1:49:48] now when he came to them then he
[1:49:49] manifest himself in them remember
[1:49:52] remember Peter Peter was all Peter was
[1:49:55] Peter was a good example of
[1:49:59] us Jesus said you know the son of man's
[1:50:03] going to be betrayed and betrayed and
[1:50:05] he's going to be evily mistreated and
[1:50:07] killed and Peter
[1:50:09] says you're ruining everything people
[1:50:13] are hearing what you're saying why cuz
[1:50:15] Peter liked the campaign he liked the
[1:50:17] prestige he liked the
[1:50:20] position then when God comes down the
[1:50:23] the the time and and and he says far be
[1:50:25] it from you for a thing like that to
[1:50:26] happen and Jesus recognizes right quick
[1:50:28] he says he turns to him and says get
[1:50:30] thee behind me Satan for thou carest
[1:50:32] about the things that be of man and not
[1:50:35] the things that be of
[1:50:37] Goden and Peter didn't comes down a
[1:50:39] little further and and and Jesus says
[1:50:42] this night you all betray me betray me
[1:50:44] and he says uh or forsake me he says
[1:50:46] I'll never forsake you though all men
[1:50:49] leave the I'll not forsake you and he
[1:50:51] says you will before the Crow
[1:50:54] Thrice you'll deny me and he says though
[1:50:56] all men forsake Thee I he said I'm ready
[1:50:58] to give my life even prison even death
[1:51:01] for
[1:51:02] you that was Peter right you know Peter
[1:51:07] had to
[1:51:09] fail just a few hours from making that
[1:51:11] statement he had a damsel by a Fireside
[1:51:14] asking for the third time you're
[1:51:15] Galilean you're your your your your your
[1:51:18] speech betrayed thee and he began to
[1:51:20] curse and to swear and say I'm never
[1:51:22] knew the man a few hours after he said
[1:51:25] he'll go to prison he'll even give his
[1:51:26] life he'll never forsake Him and now he
[1:51:28] sees Jesus Jesus looks at him he runs
[1:51:30] out and he weeps bitterly he had to fail
[1:51:32] because if he had passed that test after
[1:51:34] what he said he would have got the
[1:51:36] victory yeah
[1:51:38] amen but God's going to make sure only
[1:51:40] one gets the
[1:51:42] Victory and it's going to be
[1:51:45] Christ now Peter goes to the upper room
[1:51:47] and he's a broken man he's defeated he's
[1:51:49] failed all of his strength all of his
[1:51:51] power all of his thinking is utterly
[1:51:53] failed he's been a failure and a public
[1:51:55] failure and everybody knows he's a
[1:51:57] failure that's such a good place to
[1:52:00] be I'd rather just get it out in the
[1:52:02] open now I'm a
[1:52:04] failure that's such a good place to be
[1:52:07] I'm a public
[1:52:09] failure but praise be to God he's going
[1:52:12] to come and he's said I'll not leave you
[1:52:14] com but I'll come to you now another
[1:52:18] Power another life another nature comes
[1:52:20] into Peter and by the power of the Holy
[1:52:22] Ghost Peter goes out a few days later
[1:52:24] and they go walking by a gate called
[1:52:26] beautiful and a lame man that was laying
[1:52:28] there and he looked at them and says
[1:52:30] Silver and Gold Have I None but such as
[1:52:31] I have I give unto you in the name of
[1:52:33] Jesus Christ take up thy bed and walk
[1:52:35] and the man went running and leaping and
[1:52:36] worshiping in the church and they come
[1:52:38] to worship and to honor Peter and look
[1:52:40] at what Peter says Peter says don't look
[1:52:42] at us as though we have done anything to
[1:52:46] this
[1:52:47] man oh look at that change friends
[1:52:49] that's the change we need amen I want
[1:52:52] that change in my life right now don't
[1:52:54] look at me I didn't have anything to do
[1:52:56] with that that was God that was Jesus
[1:52:58] Christ and on his name and faith in his
[1:53:00] name has made this man whole don't look
[1:53:02] at us under our hands like we did
[1:53:04] anything we didn't do
[1:53:07] anything oh oh brother thank you for
[1:53:10] that I didn't have anything to do with
[1:53:11] it oh brother you're so it has nothing
[1:53:13] to do with me amen I had to get myself
[1:53:15] out of the way so that he could come and
[1:53:17] live his life so that if anything good
[1:53:19] is produced it's his life not mine
[1:53:21] mine's the that's got to get laid to the
[1:53:23] side my thinking's got to die my nature
[1:53:26] my wishes my wants I got to surrender
[1:53:28] all of them so his life can come and
[1:53:30] live his
[1:53:31] life that's his victory and the reason
[1:53:35] of his
[1:53:37] death said Christ is a mystery of God
[1:53:39] revealed he said it's not expressions of
[1:53:41] some church that we should Express
[1:53:43] something it's a life that you don't
[1:53:45] live yourself but he comes in you and
[1:53:48] lives by hisself and you become a
[1:53:51] prisoner to any human intellectual being
[1:53:53] at all you're led by the
[1:53:56] spirit oh praise God that's my greatest
[1:54:01] desire listen to this out of the rising
[1:54:04] of the sun there's just two more things
[1:54:05] I want to read as we
[1:54:07] close says no wonder he said fear not
[1:54:10] for now notice we are Redeemed by him
[1:54:13] and now risen with him that's what
[1:54:15] Easter means to the people risen with
[1:54:17] him notice now we have his spirit in us
[1:54:20] the abstract deed fully paid
[1:54:23] no you don't say well I hope I make it
[1:54:25] you've already made
[1:54:27] it that's how Faith speaks
[1:54:31] amen I hope I make it no you've already
[1:54:34] made
[1:54:36] it I'm just learning how to surrender
[1:54:39] yeah I'm just learning how to give up
[1:54:42] myself more and more day by
[1:54:45] day you don't say well I hope I make it
[1:54:47] you've already made it not I will make
[1:54:49] it I've already made it I never made it
[1:54:51] he made it for for me not me him well
[1:54:54] brother brandham they said I don't care
[1:54:56] what they say there he made it for me
[1:54:59] that's all I want I'm carrying about and
[1:55:02] I just want to see him
[1:55:03] manifested how can you do it call him
[1:55:06] down no he's in you see he's in you well
[1:55:10] then Lord if I can get myself out of the
[1:55:12] way you can manifest how can you do it
[1:55:16] because you ordained it
[1:55:18] so if I can just get out myself out of
[1:55:21] the way he can manifest how can I do it
[1:55:23] he ordained it so this is his victory
[1:55:27] and this is what he wanted to do and he
[1:55:29] can do it amen he will do it and where
[1:55:33] is he going to do it I'm volunteering
[1:55:35] for the job I believe he'll do it right
[1:55:38] here if I can just get out of the
[1:55:41] way last thing I want to read from the
[1:55:43] prophet in the unveiling of God he says
[1:55:45] he died to reveal himself to us now let
[1:55:49] us die to self to reveal him to
[1:55:53] others he died to reveal himself to us
[1:55:57] now let us die to self to reveal him to
[1:56:01] others why because if you die to self if
[1:56:05] you're dead then he's
[1:56:08] resurrected then he is the resurrected
[1:56:10] life living in you and he will reveal
[1:56:14] himself to others and you won't take a
[1:56:17] drop of credit for
[1:56:20] it this is his victory
[1:56:23] and the reason of his death are we going
[1:56:26] to make it
[1:56:28] absolutely by our own power absolutely
[1:56:32] not but by his predestinated plan will I
[1:56:36] grow into the stature of the fullness of
[1:56:38] Christ yes why because of the precious
[1:56:42] promises because of the divine power
[1:56:44] that he's gave to keep the promises and
[1:56:46] he's made me a partaker of the divine
[1:56:49] nature already before the foundation of
[1:56:51] the world am I I going to make it yes am
[1:56:53] I going to display Christ yes how am I
[1:56:55] going to get there I don't know but I
[1:56:57] know this has got to go out of the
[1:56:58] picture so he can come and be the
[1:57:01] picture it's Christ in Bride form that's
[1:57:05] the mystery that's unfolded today and
[1:57:08] that's where the light is shining why so
[1:57:10] that resurrected life can be an
[1:57:13] attraction to others just like Lazarus
[1:57:16] was an attraction to the world they come
[1:57:19] to see somebody that was dead and
[1:57:21] stinking yeah
[1:57:24] alive hey we were dead and stinking but
[1:57:28] we're alive in Christ Jesus not just
[1:57:31] alive but thriving under the hand of God
[1:57:34] thriving by the power of God manifesting
[1:57:37] this word with with healing with
[1:57:39] Deliverance amen with with
[1:57:41] manifestations of a man and
[1:57:42] manifestations of a woman and
[1:57:44] manifestations of a father
[1:57:45] manifestations of a mother and a and a
[1:57:47] household and all the things that God
[1:57:49] has placed in his word now living in
[1:57:51] flesh what is that that's an attraction
[1:57:53] of the resurrection and life and when
[1:57:56] they come to see Lazarus amen they saw
[1:57:58] Lazarus and believed on Jesus may they
[1:58:00] come and see his resurrected life in the
[1:58:03] bride and may they believe on
[1:58:05] Jesus praise God let's all Stand
[1:58:08] Together may God bless you in this
[1:58:12] Resurrection
[1:58:15] season praise be to God the
[1:58:19] church in the resurrection is his
[1:58:23] victory and the reason of his
[1:58:27] death
[1:58:29] God help
[1:58:31] me manifest your
[1:58:34] life all I can say is
[1:58:37] Lord I'm
[1:58:39] here God you know my heart you know my
[1:58:43] desires but I absolutely believe your
[1:58:48] promise I believe it do you believe it
[1:58:51] amen do you believe you're already a
[1:58:53] partaker of the divine
[1:58:54] nature do you believe that by the divine
[1:58:58] power that you're going to be conformed
[1:59:00] to the image of Jesus Christ I believe
[1:59:03] it too are we there yet I don't think I
[1:59:07] am but I'm moving that way by his grace
[1:59:12] day by day Surrender by surrender trial
[1:59:15] by trial bit by bit brother bam said you
[1:59:18] know what brother B said he said you
[1:59:19] know what it's going to take a whole lot
[1:59:21] of Shaving down for you and it's going
[1:59:22] to take a whole lot of Shaving down for
[1:59:24] me you know what we need shaving down
[1:59:27] you know what God's doing shaving us
[1:59:29] down you know what all these trials are
[1:59:32] for and all the it's a shaving down well
[1:59:34] praise God we're being shaved
[1:59:36] down you may say well brother Chad there
[1:59:39] there's a lot to shave down don't worry
[1:59:41] he's got a good Tool It's called The
[1:59:42] Sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:59:44] God and it's a good shaving
[1:59:46] instrument and he knows how to anoint
[1:59:48] somebody to wield the sword to shave it
[1:59:50] down yeah I don't I know about you but
[1:59:52] in the last several Services I've been
[1:59:54] shaved down have you been shaved down
[1:59:56] you know what we might need more of more
[1:59:58] shaving down but oh God shave me down so
[2:00:02] that I fit into your M amen I don't want
[2:00:05] to try to do like the churches do and
[2:00:07] make you fit into my mold I want to be
[2:00:09] shaved to fit in your mold so that I
[2:00:12] reflect the life of Jesus Christ God if
[2:00:15] you got to shave me down shave me down
[2:00:17] if you got to reveal more of my failure
[2:00:19] to me so that I could surrender it Lord
[2:00:21] so that you can live then so be it but I
[2:00:23] believe that's the hour we live in and
[2:00:25] that's the time that we're here to be a
[2:00:27] real bride a real Church manifesting the
[2:00:30] life of Jesus
[2:00:32] Christ not manifesting it

[2:00:40] Saturday to manifest it at work and to
[2:00:43] manifest it when nobody's around and
[2:00:45] when you're driving in your car by
[2:00:46] yourself and when you're thinking your
[2:00:47] thoughts all alone that the same
[2:00:49] manifestation is there is here on Sunday
[2:00:52] that's a real Christian and that's what
[2:00:55] God has come to produce the his life in
[2:00:58] a many-membered body the reality of what
[2:01:01] a bride should
[2:01:02] be it's his work it's his
[2:01:06] victory he's determined to have it he's
[2:01:09] going to have
[2:01:10] it and I'm determined that to yield all
