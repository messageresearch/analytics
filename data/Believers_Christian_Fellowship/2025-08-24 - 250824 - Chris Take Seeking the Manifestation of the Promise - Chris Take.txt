If you want to stand with me this morning, it's good to be back here with all of you. Amen. Brother Chad told me from the very beginning, relax. And I'm telling you, I try. I'm trying my best cuz I know that it's true. If you relax, you just, you know, hey, so we're just going to pull up our feet to the table today and um just let the Lord speak to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Man, you want to pull up the PowerPoint for me? you know, I'm I'm not a a teacher and um so I'm not super great with PowerPoints. Um so I jump around sometimes, so brother uh whoever's up there on the slides might have to help me out here this morning. But I wanted you to be able to uh read the quotes with me and see the scriptures with me because I have a lot of them and uh I have a lot on our plate this morning. So just trusting the Lord would put it all together for us. And um unfortunately usually what happens is if I have more it still somehow fits in about an hour just comes out a lot faster. So uh we pray that the Lord gives you extra sharp ears this morning or he just helps us to take our time. Amen. We want to minister today on seeking the manifestation of the promise. Amen. And then we want to turn to Matthew chapter 3. seeking the manifestation of the promise. Bring greetings from my pastor, brother Nathaniel Saias. He wanted to make sure that everyone got his hello. Matthew chapter 3. And we're going to read the whole chapter here. Still hear pages turning. appreciate the confidence brother Chad has to have us here to fill in the space for him and along with the other ministers Gabe and the other ones here the Ben and the Kyle just uh we're just uh we're just part of the body &gt;&gt; we're just we're here and you're there &gt;&gt; that's about it we're counting on him &gt;&gt; to speak to us &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 3 in Those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying,"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his path straight." And the same John had his raignment of camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair, and the leather girdle about his loins, and his meat was locusts and wild honey. then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, "Oh generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come. Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance." And think not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our father. For I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree which bringeth forth not fruit, good bringeth not forth good fruit is heuned down and cast into the fire. But Jesus talks about that pruning the vines, right? Cutting the branches off. They don't bring forth the fruit. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him. But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me. And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straight out of the water, and lo, the heavens were open unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. and low a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we are so thankful to be here this morning. So thankful we have a place to come to worship you, Lord, to hear your words spoken. Father, may it truly be said in the spirit of truth, Lord, this morning. May you just move in our hearts. May we receive your words that you have for us. May may new understanding just light our light upon our souls, Lord. That we could see you, Father, greater than we had yesterday, greater than we did this morning, Father. That and in do in doing so, we would draw nearer to you, Father. We thank you, Lord. We just thank you for each one that is here. May you bless them, Father, for coming. Anoint their ears. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You can have your seats today. So, seeking the manifestation of the promise. So, the big thing we want to know is what how do we know we're saved? How do we know we got the Holy Ghost? Uh we want to know what is it that we're looking for to know we're walking with God and we're part of God. And and those are those are some of the big questions that we face and and some of the big questions that of the the world faces, right? They and then we see this the problem in denominations is is then there some kind of name on a book uh you you uh you know said some kind of um you know glossalia or some kind of gibberish and you were that that shows you're saved or or there's some uh you do something outside in your flesh and and it shows that you're saved. And brother Brandon had people come to him saying I I don't know if I'm saved. I'm concerned. I'm confused. and he would he would talk to them and and he would see where their heart was and and brother Brandham would minister and he would say that you know that that the evidence that Christ is within you is the fact that you can say amen to every word. So then we're making sure we say amen every time cuz we're looking to hear ourselves testify that something has changed within us. But the biggest thing that we know that we can look at is we look in we look behind us and we realize we're not the person we were. We realize that there's something that's pulling and drawing us deeper into the word of God. And and someone would come to you and say, "Show me, you know, tell me what it is that that that gives you that evidence that that tell me what it is that shows you that you are the manifestation of the promise." And many times we can begin to testify and begin to share how, you know, we're closer to the Lord and how the the Lord opened this up and you were reading in your scripture in your in your in the book and listening to the sermons and something ministered to your heart and they can look at you and say, I don't know what you're talking about. I need evidence. &gt;&gt; And many times, if we're not careful, we fall into that same trap when all he said was, "Seek you first the kingdom of God." Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "And all these things shall be added unto you." In other words, in other words, as you pursue Christ because of the desire in your heart for Christ, that testifies you were part of Christ before the foundation of the world. And many times that is not enough for ourselves. We we are not satisfied with that. And he's asking us, look, just seek the manifestation of the promise. Just seek it. Seek me. Look to me. Testify of me. and and and then you look back and now as you get further down as you mature as a believer someone can ask you and you could say come live with me for a few days and I'll show you come let's let's walk with me a a a pace walk with me you know how did the the two on the road to Emmas know he was it was him he began to minister to them along the way he he they said walk with us and he walked with them and it was when he broke the bread when he did something that testified of who that he was before his death. All the words that they spoke was quickened to their hearts and they realized who he was. It wasn't just that a man stepped forth and broke a piece of bread open. It was that vindicating. It was the manifestation of the promise that he ministered to them along the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about, you know, Jesus and all of these things. And and here I'm already way ahead in different places all over, so maybe we just had the slides for no reason. But um he's talking about Jesus and he says, "Well, how do you know that that he was Jesus?" He says, "Because he manifested what the word said about him. &gt;&gt; He he was a virgin born of a virgin. You know, he came from Bethlehem." And and you would think you would say, "Well, why didn't God just make it more simple?" And it was, you know, a nice bulleted list. You know, anybody here like bulleted lists, right? I was explaining to my wife the other day how my brain works and she just shook her head and walked away. So, we're still married though. Actually, today is 12 years. I just been super blessed with my wife and thank you. Appreciate that. I just uh she's the best thing that ever happened to me outside of salvation. It's true. Brother Brandham says it's a great adventure. So, we would like a nice bulleted list, but you know, she said it was an angel and she's from Nazareth. And then and then they lived in or G or I forget the first town she was at. Then they move from from Egypt. They disappear. Bethlehem. He's born in Bethlehem. Just a blip on the map. And then he's gone. And they're back to this town and that town. They're in Egypt. They come back from Egypt and people are looking at them and say well you're from Nazareth just well why couldn't it be simple you know like they grew up in Bethlehem both of them Mary and Joseph and then and then and then there was you know more a priest came and said yes believe Mary she received seed of the of the Lord the Holy Spirit overshadow her yes a priest would come and say and then all of a sudden Kaius would wake up and say I had a dream or I had a vision and there's a woman in Bethlehem hand by the name of Mary and she's pregnant and she's pregnant of the of the Holy Spirit and she's going to bring forth the promised son of the Messiah and then we can all begin to prepare for this like that we say that would have been so much easier. &gt;&gt; That would have been so much more organized. &gt;&gt; You know, we we we look and we see, you know, we drive by. There's lots of them here. There's one right that's the entrance. Is that the cornfield there? I'm so turned around in here. The cornfield's there. There's a corn field somewhere in the proximity of this building and it's in nice neat rows. How do we know? You know, we can look at it and we know man put that there cuz it's in nice neat rows. &gt;&gt; You go out in the jungle or you go down into the the wilderness and you know the streams don't run in straight lines. &gt;&gt; The the trees, they're just, you know, they all grow together and then you can't even walk through the brush and and and it's just thick and it looks like chaos. Yet, leave it alone and it thrives. Yeah, &gt;&gt; leave that corn field alone. It won't be here next year. &gt;&gt; Something else will be there. &gt;&gt; That's God's organization. &gt;&gt; So, we say, well, you know, if God would have done it this way, it would have been all crystal clear, &gt;&gt; but that's man's organization. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, God wants you God wants you to be pursuing the manifestation of the promise that he's given you. &gt;&gt; Now, let's jump back here talking about John the Baptist. And we know we know this this is uh familiar to us. He's out. Brother Brandham's out baptizing. And when he baptizes the 17th person, he heard a voice say, "Look up." He looks up and that pillar of fire come circling down out of the heavens stood right over where I was at and said, "As John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Christ, your message will forrun the second coming." In Matthew 21 32 says, "For John came unto you." Nice. Those are nice screens. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness. Now Jesus is speaking of of John. And you believed him not. But the publicans and the harlots believed and when you had seen it repented not afterward that you might believe him. So in other words Jesus is saying at some point afterwards you realized who John was. But even in that even in that state they couldn't overcome the fact that he didn't manifest the promise in the way that he they thought he should. &gt;&gt; So they were seeking they come to him and saying look be honest with us. illustrate who are you. &gt;&gt; And he quotes to them scripture. &gt;&gt; He is going by way of manifesting who he he excuse me he is going by way of vindicating who he is by manifesting the word to them. &gt;&gt; But you see they never received the word to begin with. Had they received the word to begin with when he quoted them scripture, they would have say, "Ah, yes." &gt;&gt; And what would they have done? This is what we're going to get to, but I like to just throw out these hints here. What would they have? They what they excuse me, they would have then said, "Where's Jesus?" &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're the man you say you are, the Messiah is close at hand. &gt;&gt; The same thing with the prophet in our age. If people really believed who he was, they would be looking for Christ. They would be saying, "Where is Jesus? You're the man who's supposed to forerun his second coming, and where is he?" &gt;&gt; So now he says, you didn't even believe him. Mark Mark 1:7 to 8. And preached, saying, "There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I'm not worthy to stoop down and unloosed. I have indeed baptized you with water. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. So right here, put a little sticky note in your mind that John had a first and a second ministry. But the whole point of those two, he says, "I baptize you with water, but he's coming to baptize you with the word, to give you the word, to give you the completion of the thing that I am pointing you to." He is the one that's coming. So in other words, there's something coming. all of this, you have followed my ministry up to this point. And something began to stir within John and see something begin to stir within John and he realized he's coming. He's here. He's close at hand. &gt;&gt; What was it? All that I have said to you to this point is is to bring you to the position to receive him when he comes. You see, the men of the church didn't catch the vision of the ministry of John. &gt;&gt; In a simple example, those who should have recognized who he was didn't. &gt;&gt; They were looking to man to reveal Christ. &gt;&gt; They were looking saying, "Where's the one that's going to tell us? We need them to speak plainly. Tell us who you are. tell us when he's coming. You know, Jesus, how how is it that Jesus? The Pharisees came to him and said, "Who who are you?" You know, they they just they mean every time they came, I'm sure in his spirit because he was all God and all man. He probably just groaned inwardly. Here they are again. Here we go. Right? And so they would say, they would ask him over and over and over again, "Who are you?" you know, you say this or you heard this, you've done this. What? Who are you? &gt;&gt; And he would just seemingly give them riddles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he was speaking to them. He was pointing them back to what the word said about him. &gt;&gt; But because they didn't believe the word, &gt;&gt; they didn't receive him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they walked away shaking their heads, you know, planning his demise &gt;&gt; because he was he was he was destroying the the kingdom. He was destroying the control that they had over him, over the people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And so, but then there's this woman at the well, a prostitute. She, you know, who knew the word, right? Cuz she quotes the word to Jesus. &gt;&gt; What happens is she before he even begins to say who he is, obviously she had never seen him before cuz she didn't say, "Oh, you're that Jesus guy." &gt;&gt; She didn't know who he was. He's just some guy there at the well. And and she's probably thinking, "No, you know, probably another customer." &gt;&gt; And he begins to say things to her. He begins to minister to her through the first poll. &gt;&gt; The ministry begins to her and he begins to talk to her and speak to her. And then he discerns her spirit. And because she already believed the word of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As he begins to minister to her, he hasn't even he hasn't he's just saying, "Hey, the living water, you drink of that, you never thirst again." And so on and so forth. And she's like, "Man, this sounds very interesting." Something was responding to her. And we we want proof. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; We want proof. There's your proof. But you see, that's not good enough for sign seekers. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we can be tricked by that spirit and say, "Well, you need to show me something." Look, look, like, give me some kind of evidence. And, and there, right, there is the evidence. &gt;&gt; And the woman at the well says, and then he discerns her heart. Brother calls that the messianic sign. He discerns her heart and she says, "You know what? There's a Messiah coming. There's a there's something in her eyes. You never you ever meet somebody? I've met you before. I've never met you. So, we walk up. No, that's not going to work because I need somebody I've met before. We see you. I haven't seen you in a few years. Okay. For example, and and I see you across in in Walmart or uh you know, the auto parts store, some cooler than Walmart. And uh Cabelas, how about that? And I see you over there at the fishing lures and I'm like, "Man, that guy looks familiar." And you look at me, before we say the words, what's your name again? Sorry. Joseph. Brother Joseph. Before we say the name, Brother Jo, Brother Chris, there's a twinkle in the eye. There's a a little recognition in the eye and we say that's brother Joseph, right? What your the thoughts you have of him, suddenly it all clicks together and there's a spark in the eye and you realize he recognized me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that's why you can't run away cuz we see it before we say it that that person recognized us. So there's a recognition. So she's sitting there at the well and or she's standing and Jesus is sitting and and and he says and he he says, you know, yeah, you have five husbands and the one you're with now is you're not even married to. And something in her eyes sparks and she goes, when the Messiah comes, he's going to talk just like you. And she's thinking, could it be? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Could it be? &gt;&gt; And then the third poll, &gt;&gt; he says, "I am he that speaketh to thee." &gt;&gt; Why didn't he do that to the Pharisees? &gt;&gt; He was he in this in this way. He was trying to &gt;&gt; But they didn't believe what the word said about him. &gt;&gt; They skipped over that part. A virgin shall conceive after many, many years after Isaiah prophesied that. I mean, Isaiah wasn't even a favorable guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he said that, you know, did they even talk about it much? They they did, right? They said they believed it. They said yes. I say amen to that. But when the manifestation of the promise was standing there, they could not receive it. &gt;&gt; They could not receive it. So we today are seeking the manifestation of this promise. He says, "And he came into all the countries." Jesus speaking of John, "He came into all the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins." So we know that and then he so so this is John's ministry. It's just a few scriptures to to refresh our memory on the ministry of John up to Jesus. So, brother uh John says that he's coming to baptize you with the Holy Spirit, to the Holy Ghost. But that didn't come until after Jesus died and you know resurrected again and ascended up and the disciples went into the upper room and begin to pray. Then he sent them what he called the comforter. But John's saying he's coming to baptize you in the Holy Spirit. And Jesus baptized people. But then but then there was there was there was it was it was what was pointing John is basically pointing to he is the beginning. He is the beginning of that promise. He is the the one he's coming. So they're looking to him and they're looking to Jesus saying okay and then he dies and they're saying John's word never came to pass. And then now all you have all these disciples and just hang on with me. You have all these disciples who are saying yes Jesus rose again but the whole world didn't see it. The people who heard John didn't see it. &gt;&gt; Yeah right. &gt;&gt; So many times God he he gives us excuse me John pointed to him but the completion of Christ's ministry was his return in spirit form to the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see first, second pole, third pole. And we say polls because brother Brandon had this vision where he's fishing, right? Pole. That's a that's a pole. P U L L. First pull, right? It and it's you pull, you catch a fish, you're attracting. That was healing signs in the hands. Second pole we call it. That was just the vision where he he uh and I'm terrible at remembering all these details, but he pulls and he pulls too soon and it's a tangled mess. But that's the discernment. It's stages. You could say stages. First, second, third stages of the ministry. First stage was the healings and second stages was the discernment. The third stage was the point of his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was in that that he unveiled Christ. That Christ was unveiled to us because Christ himself came down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. It's in Revelation says the beginning of the creation of God came in the leady and church age. Brother Brandham says that was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was created in the womb of Mary. So Jesus had three stages of his ministry as well. So John has three cha three three stages and here comes the word and he says this is him and there's a sign from heaven the cloud &gt;&gt; comes down says this is my son right now John must decrease &gt;&gt; so that he can increase because brother Bham says uh right here skip ahead in influence I must decrease he must increase God can't have two on earth at the same time Only one has the message. You know, I must decrease. He is the messenger. I've been up to this time. Now he takes my place. As Elisha, when Elijah went up and throwed back his robe to Elisha, his ministry was finished. Elisha must take up where he left off. We know Elisha is a type of the bride. &gt;&gt; So take up where he left off. So now, so now all of the attention, all of the focus must go to Christ. &gt;&gt; But because we're men and we're living a fallen flesh, people were still attached to John's ministry. &gt;&gt; And they came to Jesus and said, John has asked us, "Are you the one?" So John begins to struggle with everything that's happened. But then you know Jesus encourages him but but God has to take him off the scene completely take his he takes his life and and so the whole point and then and then you can again you can go and you can see the three stages of Jesus's ministry &gt;&gt; and the completion of that was redemption &gt;&gt; was the word coming to you and I &gt;&gt; so that Christ could indwell in his people. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But as we understand in the first church age, they lost that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it had to be planted. &gt;&gt; Many times we don't understand everything. He said it had to be planted so that it could bring forth &gt;&gt; the original seed today. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that was the dark ages. Okay. So now let's jump forward in history to a man by the name of Apollos. He says, ' And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord. Being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. He's a second pole minister. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right. He is a second pole minister. He know he knew John but he hadn't been introduced to the opening of the word which was Christ. &gt;&gt; And so much had happened. I where was this guy right? I mean he's fervent in the Lord and uh instructed in the way of the Lord fervent in the spirit and he diligently taught the things of the Lord. So he knew the word. He was preaching the word going boldly and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquilla and Priscilla had heard they took him. So now stop reading. So now so now they here he is speaking boldly in the synagogue and and this is where this is where we're praying on how this all works because we need Aquilla and Priscilla today. God opens up these opportunities for you to begin to minister in fellowship to your brothers and sisters and there's an opening there and there's a door there and and how God can begin to use you. So he's speaking bold and they took him and and here's what they did. They didn't correct him. They expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. &gt;&gt; So now here's the thing. Here's the thing. He was along the way of God underneath that ministry of John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; He was along in there. He was in that process, but he had got stuck in a in a in a in that position underneath just up to the opening of the word. Just up to when we say opening of the word, we mean the revealing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just up to that position. &gt;&gt; And they begin to tell him more perfectly. So you realize that that it's it's this thing about Christ, it's this thing underneath the ministry of the the of the word being revealed to us and open to us that that is is is more perfect. So in other words, if if I'm looking at a at a and I'm sorry to anyone who's not carpenter anyway, that's how I think of examples, but I think we're all fairly familiar. But if if I'm putting together we built cabinets for a while when I was a teenager. If I'm putting together a face frame for a cabinet and I have it I've taken each board and I've ran it through the planer so every board is exactly the same thickness down to a 64th. Then I take it and I glue it together. It looks really good, but it's not perfect. I must then sand it down starting with a with a high grit about 180 depending on 100 work from 100 grit to 120 grit to 220 grit and now I've expounded unto the face frame the way of the cabinet more perfectly. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, you could take that phrase frame and you see it many times on cheaper cabinets and they don't do that part &gt;&gt; and it's there and you look at it with the understanding of the perfection of a face frame on a cabinet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you realize there's more that could be done with this. But until you know, until it's revealed to you, you look to that and say, "Wow, it's perfect." &gt;&gt; So Apollos is looking to what was revealed to him saying, "Wow, that's perfect." &gt;&gt; But there was something more. &gt;&gt; There was something more that had come that Paulos had missed. &gt;&gt; So then it was expounded unto him. And a Aquilla took him while Priscilla made some coffee and tea cake and because she's minister ministered unto him as well. &gt;&gt; He said, "Man, the best coffee I ever had and and he begins to tell him, you know, there's this thing called sandpaper." And Apollos says, 'You know, I was wondering about that. Because every once in a while, if you're a child of God, what he does is he shows you a glimpse of the perfection. &gt;&gt; And you and you see it, and it's like it passes before you. &gt;&gt; And then you when you see the other one, you're just like, I &gt;&gt; something's a little different on this. Something's a little different there because God is doing something to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, saints, &gt;&gt; I can't tell who you are in the Lord, where you are, how far you've come, if you'll come. I can't tell that. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And neither can you tell that of me. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm using this example because I understand with the Holy Spirit, you can discern those things, but you never want to Me and me and brother were talking about this the other day. When you meet somebody, if the Lord's opened your eyes to the word and you meet somebody, you you you can see there's something in them that's different &gt;&gt; and it rings true. And you can use that in conversation, right? You you know, okay, where where you can go and how you can fellowship in that kind of way, but you don't use that to to say this is where you're going and this is where you're not going. So he begins to minister to him and and because Aquilla was was already hearing things and catching things and and understanding more when when Aquilla came to him again to talk to him about sandpaper. Something began to stir inside of him. &gt;&gt; You see, there was already there was already something there. You know, I'm sorry. I just tried to explain myself a second ago and I don't remember where I was. I'm trying to get better at that. You see, we're still preachers. We're still guys, right? The devil loves to get he slips that in. You know, whatever your weakness is as a minister, you'll be preaching along, he'll slip that in there and then you just he'll try to derail your thought. But the God God is always perfect and he comes along and he says, "Here's where you are." Or he says, "Don't worry about it. Go back to your notes." So they expanded unto him the way of God more perfectly. Brother Frank can just like edit that part out. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding. And when he was disposed to pass into AIA, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him, who when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace. For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. So you see now Apollos catches what's going on and he receives that and he's and he his eyes are open and now he begins to minister to the people and he and God takes this gift where he was already boldly speaking and he begins to minister through the word that was given for their age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. And you can go and you can see that Apollos was very instrumental in at least the Corinthian church and I'm imagining other places of as well. There's a few scriptures here. He says, "Who then is Paul and who is Apollos? But ministers by whom you believed? I have planted Apollos water, but God gave the increase." So God began to use this man named Apollos &gt;&gt; as he understood the word that was revealed to him to them in that day, right? He received that. But you see what happened was now there was these these brothers here in in in Corenth. So this is before Paul I'm sorry. No, while Paul is at Corenth, Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples. Now, interestingly enough, that this happens at Ephesus, which is the type of the first church age. And we are supposed to be the that's the alpha and we are the omega bride. So, there's a lot of types and there's a lot of shadows and there's a lot of things that come that came in that age that now this is the complete manifestation of that in our age. We're back, right? We're back. But it's different because that seed has reproduced itself. &gt;&gt; So now we are the completion of what was started in Ephesus. &gt;&gt; You have to remember that that they lost that uh the the spiritual Eve was married and fell to denominations, fell to organization, fell at Na, right? But the second Eve won't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the bride of Jesus Christ in the last age. So it was restored, right? So the understanding of what was given at Ephesus under the ministry of Paul was restored and it was restored because sovereign grace. &gt;&gt; Sovereign grace came down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see divine but says when divine love was projected sovereign grace took its place. So divine love projected to Mary sovereign grace stepped and created a man in her womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine love was projected to our age and sovereign grace came down and Christ stepped into the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You received his seed. This is the first time in history. &gt;&gt; The first time in history that the bride of Jesus Christ, the the his wife is receiving a marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He he was he was talking about it. He was alluding to it. He was pointing to it. But it's in this age that it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we look back now Ephesus. Okay. So Ephesus received the ministry of John the Baptist because he says unto them through Apollos. He says unto them, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? And they said unto him, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. So now Apollos had ministered to them. He had only received uh John's baptism. And I I should say I'm assuming it was Apollos. They'd only received John's baptism. And he said unto them, "Unto what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Unto John's baptism." Then said Paul, "John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is on Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus." So now they received this first and second pole ministry from John the Baptist. However, that happened. They're at Ephesus. They're the first church. There's 12 about 12 there, it says. But you see, they only came so far. But then Paul comes to them, the message of the age, and begins to tell them there's something that came. The point of the baptistry was that th that the people that you should believe on him that was coming after him. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, you should be seeking the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; John as an anointed prophet was ministering the promise to them, but he was not the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; He was the manifestation of a different promise. &gt;&gt; So, I shall be one like crying in the wilderness, right? He quoted Isaiah to them. He was the manifestation of that promise but he was the man ministering unto the manifestation of the promise &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. So brother Brandham was the the the fulfillment and was the the manifestation of the promise of Malachi 45 and 6. &gt;&gt; But the point of that was to minister about the promise and point us so we could say here's the signs, here's the scriptures. Now, because of that, and because you believe that already, when you hear the message, you look and say, "Where is Jesus? Where is the Messiah? He said he'd come today. Where is he?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if there's something missing, the way of God has not been yet more perfectly expounded unto you, you will stop with John's ministry. You will stop with the ministry of Brother Brandon. That's all you will receive. and you won't seek the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; Because now in our age, what is supposed to happen? &gt;&gt; You and I, I say this way, the bride of Jesus Christ should be manifesting the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's the signs, brother Chris? &gt;&gt; Show me evidence. &gt;&gt; I don't see anything. I'm sorry, but that's it. But now a son of God says, "I never been here before. I'm new to this church. Can Can you show me what it means?" &gt;&gt; And they go, "I knew it." &gt;&gt; You see, saints, it comes down to the end of it. It all depends on the sovereign grace of Jesus Christ. It all depends on Christ himself revealing himself to you. And if you are new, but Christ is inside of you, you're not yet aware of that. When you meet Christ in your brother, &gt;&gt; something testifies back and forth. &gt;&gt; There's a twinkle in the eye. There's a a recognition, a glimmer of recognition. And now, now you see it. And now you're saying, God, I want to be the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; That is what God is looking for. He says, I must decrease. Brother says, I must decrease. He must increase. Elijah throws the mantle. Elisha must complete the ministry. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking to what? The manifestation of what the word says about the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot &gt;&gt; that he said. &gt;&gt; That's why we read it every day &gt;&gt; cuz we read it and we listen. We read it and we listen. And as we do that, our revelation increases. And our revelation produces what? Manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't know why your wife looks at you and say, you know, you've been treating me really nice lately." &gt;&gt; Your kids, they're thinking, you know, dad's not the same person he used to be. And it just gets better and better and better and better. Say, "That's not very spiritual, Brother Chris." Oh, yes it is. Oh, yes it is. Because there's only two spirits in the world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Christ and the Antichrist. And when you start living the word, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; that's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is powerful. &gt;&gt; In the face of complete and total darkness, &gt;&gt; that is powerful. And that will change the life of the people around you. &gt;&gt; And when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them. They spake with tongues and prophesied. And all the men were about 12. He says in harvest time he says we've been baptized the same man that baptized Jesus John. We've been baptized to John's baptism. So they knew of Jesus. John only baptized unto repentance not for the remission of sins because the lamb hadn't been killed yet. He said John baptized unto repentance seeing that you should believe on him that was to come on Jesus Christ. And when they heard this, they were baptized. And Paul laid his hands upon them. The Holy Ghost came upon them. He says, "30 years later." And he says this about the church at Ephesus. He says, "These good people at Ephesus had heard about the coming Messiah." Saints, I realize you're faithfully taught here. And and and I had two sermons and I would just came said, "Lord, you're going to show me what you want me to speak." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he showed me Friday night in conversation. He showed me this was the sermon he wanted me to minister. &gt;&gt; So if all of this is a refresher to you, say, "Lord, show me what I've missed before." &gt;&gt; So I say that again. Look, see the the guy got in the way again. &gt;&gt; Here's the thing, saints of God. Something happened. Something happened. Brother Brandham came in his ministry and he preaches for the first several years, many years he preaches and and all of that, you know, we go back through the of revelation that Christ came, we go back and we and we can pull through that. But if that's all you get, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; if you just get up to the baptism of Jesus Christ, if you just get up to the seals and the preaching of the word and all and you can listen to those messages, I'm not saying you don't listen to them, but I'm saying your revelation only comes up to that. God has to first come and tell you that that thing after there, the word after there was the message, was the point. &gt;&gt; It's like John preaches a lot of good things and he, you know, he's up there and he's rebuking the church and everyone says, "Yes, tell them vipers all about it. &gt;&gt; Get him, John." Right? and he he's blasting it up and there's a man preaching like they've never heard preached before and he's baptizing and people are getting their lives right and there's power and there's fire and then and then and then he baptizes this man named Jesus and then it's like it's not the same anymore. We got to go back, John. John, we got to go back, you know, get that stick out and start smacking the desert floor again and and let's get some Pharisees and we can chew them out and &gt;&gt; and then John's in prison and everyone's thinking, "Now, what do we do?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing happened with brother Brandham. If he's if he's the second forerunner, &gt;&gt; then he's going to be patterned after the first forerunner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And same thing happened. He comes and and there's all this, yeah, you know, tear them churches down. Yes, we're holy rollers. And and and and then and it's like, well, the point was you to holy roll into Christ &gt;&gt; and and to stand up the word in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't just keep rolling. Roll unto something. There is a purpose for something. I don't mean that as a slander to anybody. There's a purpose to something. God doesn't just come and say just shout and and run around and and be excited and be excited about the and brother Bam encourages that and then something changes. &gt;&gt; And everyone says we can't have you minister for us anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. What what what matures a believer? Me and brother Ilia was talking about this. Excuse me. What's one of the greatest not the but one of the greatest trials that we face that brings us closer and that that causes a maturing in our character is when someone who should believe &gt;&gt; what you believe persecutes you for what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; So, we're going to have to we're dealing with that. But you see, we're looking at this pattern here of John the Baptist had a ministry and the churches the church at Ephesus only heard that. Do you think by any great chance the same pattern is going to happen today? &gt;&gt; If it happened with the first church age, it will happen in the last. &gt;&gt; People looking and saying, "Well, yes, John." And there was a season where we said, "Yes, baptism unto repentance. John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; But then the word came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says right here, they heard about the coming Messiah. We all heard the Messiah was coming. We all knew he's coming &gt;&gt; now. Ready? Oh, this is good. This is good. John had preached him. They were baptized unto repentance of sins, looking forward to believing on Jesus. How many can say when they heard the message that's exactly what you were all of you have the ability to raise your hands? I know you do exercise authority over your body. He says but now it was time to look back to Jesus and be baptized unto remission of sins. It was time to receive the Holy Ghost. And when they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, okay, next quote, next part of the quote, he says, "All those dear folks at Ephesus were fine people. And anyone of any and if anyone had a right to feel secure, they did." Notice how far they had come. They had come all the way up to accepting the coming Messiah. They knew he was coming. &gt;&gt; Their own prophet baptized him. &gt;&gt; They had come all the way up. But don't you see that in spite of that they had missed him. He had come and gone. &gt;&gt; They needed to be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? I'm not going to try to preach Brother Alistister's sermon. But if if Christ is the word &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is Christ in the word, &gt;&gt; you must receive the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are you sealed? How is a womb sealed? &gt;&gt; Receiving seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Word. The word of God is a seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sealed unto the day of your redemption. They at Ephesus received the Messiah, received Christ after he had already come and gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ron puts it that way, but I like to say this. When Christ came and he was revealed through the ministry of the prophet 63 to 65, he's still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? The Christ came back into the church. He's still here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, oh, he came. He came. He came. Show me. &gt;&gt; How do you show how we People are seeking for the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; There's been a promise given. People are looking for it. How are you going to show them? How are you going to show them that you have the truth? You can talk about it. You can say you have the truth. You can say you've got the word. You can use the catchphrases. But how? Cuz they're looking. &gt;&gt; They're looking. There's people in the pew with you looking. So what does the bride have to do? They must manifest what the word said about them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; They must be Christ in flesh. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Look at the fruits. Show me the fruits." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, that takes a long time. You know, you got to plant a tree and it has to grow up and then it has to get pollinated and then fruit has to grow. I want apples in June. Sorry, doesn't happen that way. So, you have to have faith that's actually an apple tree you planted. &gt;&gt; And then you have to have faith that apple tree is going to get the life &gt;&gt; to produce the apples. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we've all done that, right? M spring, Home Depot's got the sale. Get the tree, you plant it, it grows up, and they say, "Oh, you got the male tree. You need the female tree." Oh, you say it's an apple tree. It should give me apples. No, no, no. Right. So, it takes the two. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ &gt;&gt; Christ himself must come and manifest himself &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think that sounds confusing, you need to go read where Paul says, "Well, I will to do good, evil is present with me. And though I want to do good, I do evil." &gt;&gt; And he was the first church age messenger. Sounds like riddles. until God gives you a revelation. &gt;&gt; And that's all it is. It's that simple. You see, that's the thing. It's like, well, how do we know Jesus was Jesus? Cuz he said he was. &gt;&gt; He only did that a couple times. But he only did that when first the word called him out. &gt;&gt; You see, she called him out &gt;&gt; at the well. She said, "Hey, when the Messiah comes, he's going to say those same things." You see, the word identified him first &gt;&gt; and then he confirmed it. &gt;&gt; You see, God gives you the word, God gives you revelation of the word, then he proves that word to you. &gt;&gt; That's why I tell people, I said, you hear something preached by any minister that confuses you or concerns you, go to the word. This is why it's so important to have your own personal walk with Christ and feeding on the word daily because then if it's the truth, God identifies it to you. God proves it to you. If it's not the truth, he proves it to you. &gt;&gt; That it's not the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he confirms it. We're not just here guessing. Just have faith in a breeze, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. So he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God. So again just to recap the vindication that Jesus was who he said he was came because he fulfilled what the word said about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom. And this is a long or I'm sorry, this isn't the long quote. He says, "We all here this afternoon who are Christians believe that Jesus Christ was God's word manifested. We believe he was virgin born. He was the tabernacle in which Almighty God tabernacled in here on earth. Not just a prophet, not just some ordinary man, but God himself manifested in the form of a man, God with us. Rise and shine for the light has come to you." Isaiah was the light. I got the highlighted portions because we just read every word. We'd be here too long. Noah was the light of his day. Isaiah was the light of his day. Why? He had the word manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel, the Bible words for this day is the light of today. Jesus come on two lights. So for reference that he's talking about John the Baptist and Jesus can't shine at the same time. Can't be a church light and God's light shine at the same time. God's light putting out the church light. God is separating churchism from his light of the promised word of this hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham isn't saying stop going to church. He's saying if I I if if the light that you're following, how do I say this? He's saying that that the churchism the the the form of coming to church and and having everything that involves in in church is not the point. You know, there's an example that that that I'll use here that I think explains it well for myself at least. But says, you know, he says many things about the end of time and and what we're going to face and and you know, we have all of our guesses and our opinions on that, but when it happens, we'll know this is God and it always happens different than we think it does anyways. But he says, you know, at some point the church doors will close. I I if if your entire walk as a believer revolves around this what happens here on Sunday morning and on Wednesday night and in between and the special things if that's what keeps you going &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; then when church is not there &gt;&gt; you will fall apart &gt;&gt; but if your purpose is the light of the age which is the revealed word &gt;&gt; is the open book &gt;&gt; then this is the bonus this. You come here and it bolsters you and it strengthens you. And then you go to your studies, you go, "The preacher talked about that and you're feeding and you're feeding and then you come Wednesday and the preacher's talking about what you were feeding on." And then, right, because imagine this. Imagine this. Let's say, let's say you got to have church. You got to have the brothers get up here and sing and the musicians play and sing songs and to to pull you from your despair and your stuper and your fog and and the ideas of of your job. And then the preacher comes and and gives you all of the, you know, the word and you receive it. And then there's a nice atmosphere. And then there's singing of songs. And then there's closing out. And the brothers will shake your hand as you go out and you can talk with some believers in fellowship. And then you go back. And then now you go back to your other life. And then now you know we're looking in the future. Can't come here anymore. You can't. Nobody can have church. But the Bible says they try to stop ministers from preaching. &gt;&gt; And say they do stop ministers from preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now instead of churchism, now it's like, hey, what's a secret knock? &gt;&gt; Slip inside. I don't know. I'm just, you know, painting a picture here. And now you sit down and, you know, maybe the guitar's too loud, so you can just, you know, hum, you know, as a few come in. And then the brother opens the Bible and everyone goes, "What's he going to say? Everything is about the word of God. &gt;&gt; Or you can't even do that. You just gather your family in the corner, &gt;&gt; little candle on, I don't know, again, painting a picture and you begin and everyone's hanging on every word because all that you're focused on is the ministry of the light of the age. And there will be churches having church &gt;&gt; and saying, "Why don't you just come and join us?" You saw this pattern behind the iron curtain, right? &gt;&gt; People, you know, people gave up because they had to have church. &gt;&gt; We have church. Let's go to church. &gt;&gt; I wish we didn't have to, you know, throw the caveats in there. But our flesh gets in the way and people start looking, a brother Chris is saying we ought to stay home. What's he going to say next? I won't say it, but you know what I'm thinking. There's a nice catchphrase. Okay. So that's churchism, right? This idea you have to have Oh, see there we go again. This idea that that that you live, you serve God through church. But church is what happens when people who serve God come together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There. Thank you, Jesus. That perfectly puts it there. Church is what happened when people who serve God come together. &gt;&gt; How? Doesn't matter. They're together. What happens? The word begins to be ministered. song begins to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, how in the world did Paul and Silas in the jail? Their feet were in stocks, their hands were in stocks, and their heads were in stocks. &gt;&gt; Brother Blake, you ever tried to sing hunched over? There's no reason the song leader stands to sing. Constricts your diaphragm. &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas are there, you know. I don't know what they sang. Whatever songs they had then, &gt;&gt; you know, maybe Paul even wrote one, you know, or was it Silas? I don't know who began to sing first. It says Paul and Silas begin to sing, right? &gt;&gt; Am I remembering that correctly? &gt;&gt; So, so, so then it was the song, brother. The song set them free. know the word in them &gt;&gt; produced the song in the face of complete adversity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz anybody can sing, but not anybody can sing sitting in jail. &gt;&gt; Anybody can sing in church. Anybody can stand up here and and and sing and and you know, maybe you think, well, that's not your gift, brother, right? But they can get up there and make a joyful noise unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that. But only the word can testify forth in that condition. &gt;&gt; Only a revelation of Jesus Christ himself can testify forth in that condition. &gt;&gt; You say, when we got our arm arm in arm and we're we're we're here and we've got and and we're just so encouraged and we're so challenged, that should encourage us for our walk. And you say, "Yes, praise God." And you're an encouragement to your brother and your brother's an encouragement to you because outside of these walls, you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, which is look, hey, guess what? A personal relationship with Jesus Christ does not exist today outside of the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; It does not exist outside of the open book. &gt;&gt; It's that's just what it comes down to. That's the light of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. which brother Brandham said is the best day ever because it's all of the light. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So what what what's going to you come together and you're arm in arm and you're there. Now what happens when you're alone? You know we I had this project one time was a commercial project and there we were working on the main level but there was a basement. I'm a grown man saints. I'm a man. I've walked in the woods with bears and you know I've seen bears and I'm a man and I hated going down in that basement. You know, it just was like, man, what and it just went forever. I mean, there was rooms that went way back there and they were dark. &gt;&gt; See, Paul and Silas were in the inner prison, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There was no light at all. &gt;&gt; No, it was pitch pitch black. You think you got a prisoner you're going to execute the next morning? Let's say that was the plan. You're going to give them a torch. &gt;&gt; Here, have a little light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, he's a dead man walking. &gt;&gt; You don't care. &gt;&gt; Pitch black. There wasn't no, you know, musicians and and song leaders to to encourage them out of that position. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; The only thing the only thing that can give you light in that kind of darkness &gt;&gt; is the man who can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother preaches that sermon, the man who can turn on a light. &gt;&gt; And he starts preaching about the open of the word. We're like, "Oh, this why?" Because he turns the light on in the darkness of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And guess what? Spiritually speaking, we are in the same position Paul and Silas were. &gt;&gt; He says, "Uter darkness." &gt;&gt; He says, "I couldn't see any further." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, I think it was after 77, he couldn't see any further. See, he predicts that 77 will see the close of time cuz he couldn't see any further. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yet here we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lights. But what's the only thing that can stand in that kind of darkness is the same thing that gave Paul and Silas the victory over their circumstances. They were the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The word is light when it's vindicated. Until the word it promised for the day is a vindicated, then it is not light. It cannot be. If God said, "Let there be light and no sun come in sun come into in existence." There is no sign of light. &gt;&gt; So he speaks the word. Okay. Okay. But when God said, "Let there be light." Remember how brother talks about the third pole being the spoken word? &gt;&gt; And we thought, look, I'm young, but I paid attention growing up to what preachers said about the third pole. We thought it was like, yes, we're going to be speaking squirrels. What are you moose hunting 59in bull, right? Or I'm fishing and or I'm like the ladies in the, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not a lady. I don't have an example for you. the sewing machine. I don't know. Perfect Holland sauce doesn't break cuz Holl sauce breaks if you don't do it correctly. Mayonnaise breaks too, you know. Perfect mayonnaise. Speaking word, right? I don't make any fun of that. I'm not making fun of that. But you see, what was it? It was that the word, the spoken word was manifesting itself. He says, "Oh, it'll be that spoken word." And it was the complete manifestation of the word of God that was given. The spoken word that was given. The angel came to him and said, "Well, what do you want?" He says, "Well, I don't know." He's like, "Well, aren't you hunting squirrels?" &gt;&gt; Right? There was the word first. Okay? So, when God said, "Let there be light and there was light." That was the manif the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; When God promised the Messiah, Messiah come, then his word was fulfilled and he was the light of the hour. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you see? That's why if the light hasn't come, okay, you ready for this? If the light hasn't come and you're looking for it, you're right in tune with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if the light has come and you're still looking for it, &gt;&gt; you're out of sync with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must, like he said about the Ephesus church in the the church age book that we just read, you must go back &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; to God. This is the same example by the Bram says God turned a corner &gt;&gt; and they kept building a wall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you spiritually are going to experience the same thing because some of us are younger than others. And you it's not just it's not just the bride worldwide. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't deal with the bride worldwide. &gt;&gt; He deals with you. &gt;&gt; It's an individual affair. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he comes to you and begins to minister to you under the first pole. Then he begins to discern your heart. And the minister gets up and he speaks to you what you're already thinking about. He minister to you what you've been praying about. &gt;&gt; And the word begins to discern your heart and you fall upon a scripture. You come to a sermon and brother Brandham begins to minister and it's exactly what you're looking for already. Already what's in your heart. The scripture that you opened and it's already there. what you were looking for. And what is he do? What is he doing? He's trying to say, "I am he that speaketh to thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am he that's ministering to you, &gt;&gt; man. Amen. That's right. What he's telling you is exactly what you're looking for. &gt;&gt; What you need is exactly what he's speaking to you. All you have to do is receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all it comes down to. You have to receive what God has spoken to you. &gt;&gt; He's laid it out for you. He took the pages and he laid them out one by one. He says, "You were born there and then this happened and then this happened." And he's leading you to what? The completion of the whole thing. He's telling you, "I have crafted you for this day. I have crafted you for the position that you're sitting in." Your name your name Preston, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm Chris. Nice to meet you, brother. He's crafted you for this day. He's crafted you for right here and right now. But the brothers told me who you were. I didn't guess that. They mentioned you and I said, "I know who you're talking about. I saw him the other day." &gt;&gt; Right? Something manifested that you have a need of &gt;&gt; and God lays it all out for you in a blueprint and says, "This is it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And a minister can come from somewhere else who doesn't know everything that you're going through and we'll hear a little something and that's it. And God will use that and vindicate and say you need to speak that for him. &gt;&gt; You need to speak that for it one person doesn't matter. Could be you. Could be you. God crafted this thing just for that person. And God comes and he discerns your heart through the ministry. &gt;&gt; Is God still alive today? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God is still using man today. &gt;&gt; Are we still here? &gt;&gt; Do we still have needs? &gt;&gt; Does God still care? &gt;&gt; Is his word the truth? &gt;&gt; If it is and you believe everything that he's written down, &gt;&gt; then God can speak through the minister &gt;&gt; and he can discern your heart and tell you exactly what you have need of and tell you exactly what you you're looking for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's still real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, the problem is that we fail. &gt;&gt; We get in the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is perfect in his ways. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the last days that two spirits would be so close it would deceive the very light if possible. It isn't communism, it's churchism. So we talked about that. Now, in this message, shalom here as I I'm coming down to a close. He says, "There is a young fellow around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth." Now, before Brother Man begins to speak this in in this message, he stops and he says, "Lord, forgive me for what I'm about to say." because he wants to make a point. So now he's he's in the the person of the Pharisees talking to the group the the the other Pharisees and Sadducees or whatever, however they did it. &gt;&gt; And he's and he's saying, "There is a young fellow here around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth." Again, patterns repeat themselves. So this same spirit is here today whispering in your ear, &gt;&gt; saying this same thing. There's a young fellow around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth, dare I say it, Chris take talking to you about the opening of the book, talking to you about this stuff. Brother Chad Lamb, &gt;&gt; brother, you know, whoever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Gabe Smith, &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't matter. Your dad, right? What does your dad know? You know, who's this young? Who's this young fellow? Who's this old guy? You know, who's he? M &gt;&gt; okay. Now he begins to talk about well this is why he is challenging he is challenging they are challenging the word that's being revealed to the people &gt;&gt; have nothing to do with him. What does our Bible teach us? Oh goodness gracious. You see he uses the word against the word. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care. He's not looking for some. You know I look at it this way. You know, it's interesting to think about it in this context. Again, more of a parable. You know, it's like it's like the devil's not all knowing, right? &gt;&gt; Can't read your mind. &gt;&gt; You know, he's been crafting his attack all these generations and these years, but he's not all knowing. So, he thought, I know what to do. The cloud came from a rocket. And people left. And I know that hits close to home. People left. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he thought, yes, I have dismantled &gt;&gt; this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And he's laughing and he's saying, you know, it's like that, you know, death, death, is he still? He says, I still got him. Is he still there? The death says, I still got Jesus. He's still down there. And the devil says, yes, I've got him. And then people just kept coming and then there was a new pastor and this is happening other places and he says he says um death do we have him? No, he rose you know he came through it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, right. &gt;&gt; So then he's like man that didn't work. &gt;&gt; Please give me some liberty &gt;&gt; to paint a picture here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I'm not a artist. So he says, "Ah yes, I have a new idea. What if because those people, they they all believe the prophet too much. So what if I use the prophet to fight the word? &gt;&gt; What if I don't even make them denounce the prophet? &gt;&gt; What if I what if they don't even turn their back on the prophet? They just begin to preach against the open word, &gt;&gt; which by the way, he has no idea. So he's totally guessing cuz he's like, "What is that? What is it?" And it was in secret. &gt;&gt; So saints, you can say, "Oh, well, I'm not anti- message. I believe in brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I believe Brother Brandham came. I believe the cloud was actually vindication." &gt;&gt; Right? and you begin to minister Pentecostal doctrine and Baptist doctrine under the guise of the message &gt;&gt; and you have quotes to back you up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So when we're standing against anti- message, are we standing against anti- message, which is Christ, or are we standing against anti-profit people? See, the devil got us really distracted with all of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; People stood up, including me as a young man. And I I stood up, you know, and I preached the message, right? And it was like, well, you know, the word just comes and the word vindicates itself and the word interprets itself by coming to pass. And then God, you know, we don't need to get up there and start slaying these people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The word comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, that happened here. I said it hit close to home. That happened here. The word just began to minister to everyone goes, "Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen." &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, the point I'm making is what if the word is used against the word? lowercase W &gt;&gt; against uppercase W. &gt;&gt; So they're doing the same thing. What does our Bible teach us? See, Brother Brham, they didn't have the Bible when Jesus was walking on earth. Brother Brandham is bringing that that pattern present. &gt;&gt; He says, "What does our Bible teach us? God is love." &gt;&gt; Sounds good. Who was the fir? Who was the first with you when you were born? Your kind old priest. Who come to you when you was in need, didn't have no money, and loaned you some money. Your kind old priest who put his hand on your shoulder and on your mother's shoulder when you was about to separate and prayed you back to God. Your kind old priest. Who was it that was here for you when you were struggling? Your church. And now you want to say your church is wrong. Who was it took sides with you when you and your neighbor were fussing and brought you back together in fellowship? Your kind old church. Kind old priest. &gt;&gt; Who is it is the last words going to say over you at the day out chandonder? Who is it? They let you lay there and rot, but your kind old priest comes and blesses you and sends the word of God along with you. Your kind old priest. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, they were using the Torah, using the word of Moses, the word of their messenger &gt;&gt; to say Jesus was wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. What about this guy called Jesus of Nazareth? Jesus of Nazareth, not of Bethlehem. People are scratching their heads saying, "Look, it says of Bethlehem and this guy's of Nazareth. What are people doing? &gt;&gt; I got the book in Moses, blah blah blah blah. &gt;&gt; Your kind old priest had to sacrifice all of his life. That pastor gave you 30 years of his ministry &gt;&gt; and you're just going to walk away from him. &gt;&gt; His grandfather was a priest. His great great great great grandfather was a priest. He put his whole time in the organization. He is trained to the word. He knows what he is talking about. The problem is how did they know how what gave what basis did they say he knew what he was talking about? &gt;&gt; Because somebody told them he knew what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the word spoke of what he was saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way to catch Jesus in their midst was they needed to know what the word said about the coming Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now we're talking about fruits of the spirit. Kind, love, joy, peace, understanding, longsuffering, patience. Fruit of the spirit. What about this Jesus? Where did he come from? They didn't even know where he came from. 30 years he walked around building furniture. Jesus, I can see his brothers, you know, they believe on him later. I think they did. I'm not sure. But in the moment, Jesus, you're just going through a midlife crisis. You know, John's a charismatic guy and you're just bored. You know, you've been back here with dad building furniture. By the way, this looks really good, man. Good job on this. You know, I mean, look at this. You want to give up this craft? You want to, you know, I mean, look at dad, right? He's getting a hold. He can hardly hold the chisel anymore. He can't run the planer. A few years later, you know, Jesus is at it again and his brothers come to him. Look, dad's passed on. Somebody's got to keep the furniture business going. But you're just going to walk away. You just, you know, you're in a midlife crisis, right? Yeah. We told you about it last year. You know, like get a hold of yourself. Dad just died. I understand. You're sad. You're depressed. You know, it's hard losing dad. And you're going to go follow this guy named I mean, the guy doesn't even wear normal clothes. He's got camel hair. &gt;&gt; He's like, you know, we've been using camels for like 120 years. Nobody's ever thought, "Hey, that looks great as a tunic." And he eats bugs, man. He eats bugs and and and he's I heard he was, you know, chewing out the Pharisees, which I kind of liked, but still like, you know, leave that guy alone. Don't be getting all weird. And Jesus says, "No, it's time for me to go." &gt;&gt; You're going to have the same pattern in your life. that spirit is going to come whispering to you saying, you know, you're going to go off the deep end, right? &gt;&gt; And he says, "No, I know you're right. And maybe you'll delay it for a little bit." Like, I know you're right. You just It's too crazy, right? Like, we've got this whole thing. We got this whole community. We got the message and you know, it's everywhere we go and there's people and and it's like, why? Wh why? And you're saying that like like there's people who say they believe the prophet and believe the message and and and you're saying they're not preaching the message. You're trying to tell me that my pastor, you know, this preacher or or this ministry or or what I believe is not true, like there's something more or better. Look, we heard all about this. Add one word or take one word from it. Your place will be taken off the book of life. We've heard about this, Jesus. I don't think you should go. But you see, there was something in Jesus that couldn't hold him back. &gt;&gt; There was something because he was the perfect word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Put your halo back in your back pocket. He was all God and all man. So he had to fight the same demons. &gt;&gt; He had to fight that spirit. &gt;&gt; Say, "You're going off the deep end." &gt;&gt; Yep. Right. &gt;&gt; Look, that girl across town, she's been here a few times over the past year. You know, Jesus, come on, man. You're 30, bro. Like, people get married around here at like 15. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus just said, "Thanks." And walked out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thanks, but no thanks. &gt;&gt; And walked out. And in every single church age, Jesus in his bride said the same thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; No thanks. And walked out. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; No thanks, Luther. &gt;&gt; And walked into Wesley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pentecost said, "No thanks, Wesley." &gt;&gt; And walked into what &gt;&gt; should be Christ himself in the flesh in you and I. &gt;&gt; The word revealed. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to go through the same thing because this is the age that you live in. You can't change it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you cannot change when you were born and the fact that you are here and this is the time that you get to live in. &gt;&gt; You can't change it. &gt;&gt; So, it's time for the bride of Jesus Christ to say, "No thanks." &gt;&gt; And walk out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk out where? What are you going to do? Where are you going to go? I don't know. But who else has the words of life? Amen. &gt;&gt; The pattern repeats itself over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; And the devil loves to slip in and say, "See, it's your pastor. It's you. &gt;&gt; You need to walk out of the spiritual condition you're in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to tell yourself, the word needs to speak back to your body and say, "No thanks." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And walk into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Say, "No thanks. I know it's a creature of time, but he said bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh." &gt;&gt; So you body will obey my confession. &gt;&gt; Not just for healing of the flesh, but healing of the spirit, healing of the heart. Wounds come, wounds come upon you, and sometimes they come from good people that you misunderstood. A spirit begin to whisper in your ear. And if you could see into the spiritual realm right now, things are happening. God is speaking. At the same time, the devil is whispering. &gt;&gt; The word is speaking and there's a war within. &gt;&gt; There's a battle within. &gt;&gt; And whoever you fed last week is winning today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, not much fruit of the spirit there. What about this Jesus? All he does is try to tear up the schools that we've built. Not much fruit of the spirit there, is it? What did he do up there where them poor merchants down there and the businessmen, they don't raise sheep. So, they set a little pin out there so man could bring in a sheep. That poor businessman, he wants to offer a sheep because it's God's requirement. Oh, sounds so good. What has this Jesus of Nazareth done? Kicked over his tables, took some leather, played it together, beat them priests out of there, and called your kind old priest a snake in the grass, a hypocrite. Now, you call that fruit of the spirit? Certainly not. No more than you think of compassions and him going through a multitude of people there. Never heard of it. Never healed any of them. full of compassion. He is full of compassion and never healed any of them. People with a carnal mind will never know it. It's a revelation. Them priests had 10 times the fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Esau &gt;&gt; was a good old Christian. &gt;&gt; How would you know what's right? Oh yes. Thank you. Now we can get down. Now we can get down to where the rubber meets the road. &gt;&gt; How can you tell? &gt;&gt; How would you know what's right? The manifestation of the spoken word of God being made manifest the light of the hour. Certainly there is what the evidence of the Holy Spirit is. Believing the word of God when it's manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. believing the word of God when it's manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; You and I are looking for that word to be manifested inside of our lives. &gt;&gt; We're not looking Put it this way. What does the word say about the bride? Go find out. I'm still looking and I still keep finding things and finding things and finding things. &gt;&gt; And the Lord keeps revealing himself to me in his sovereignty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the promise becomes life. It's so simple, saints of God. It's so simple. And when you know the world stole that. If you know, you know. In other words, if you've got the revelation, you know. &gt;&gt; You get it. &gt;&gt; You get it. And if you want to get it and you don't, you'll get it. &gt;&gt; If your desire in your heart is, Lord, show me. Lord, show me. I want to know what all these people are talking about. I want to know. Many times it's not even people. Sometimes you feel like you're alone alone on an island, but the Lord keeps speaking to you, speaking to you, speaking to you, and you you try to you try to just, you know, okay, yes. No, I'm going to put that behind me, and I'm just going to you know, I went through that. I thought, well, no, no, no, no. See, no. Just just focus on the message. Preach the message. Preach the Bible. Next thing you know, there it is again. And there it is again, the word building up and manifesting and expanding and opening up. And I said, "Well, I'm not listening to any other man." So, but they're preaching the same thing. So, no, no, no, focus message, the sermons of brother Brand. I'm in the Bible. The sermons in the Bible. Then he's like third pole, opening of the word, seven seals, Christ in you, manifesting in you. And then you're looking at, oh, he he stepped out, took the book, redee redemption's plan, the name, your name's written in the book, and and you're looking up saying, I have lost my mind. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not the same thing over and over again. God's trying to show you again in his word, &gt;&gt; again in his word from a different perspective of what he's doing in your life. We just looked at John as the forerunner and how God worked in him and progressed him up to the point and then the word came and we see the second forerunner. The same exact pattern happened. We can look then at a very personal level at the woman at the well just like you and I. And he begins to speak to us first pull second pull and then he reveals himself to us. Says I am he that speaketh to thee. You see, it's the same thing there over and over. Sorry, it's not the same thing. It's the same vision. And the word ministers and he comes through this way and he comes through this way and he moves and he slips through and he comes and he ministers to you and then he he points you to this over here and he points you to that over here and he has you sit and he has a minister come and he has your pastor preach on a certain thing and you sit down and you happen to push play on a on a certain sermon and and then God speaks to you and God's showing you and all you have to do is say, you don't have to say anything. Actually, you just have to surrender to him. &gt;&gt; That's all she did. She said, "You sound like the Messiah." She was there. And it wasn't cuz she said those words. That's where we always want to go. Like, okay, what was those words that Brother Chris said? Okay, you sound like the Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's just religion. &gt;&gt; And it gets you nowhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to pray, "God, I need you to meet me at the well. &gt;&gt; I need you to meet me." See, that's Jacob's well. &gt;&gt; Coincidental. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, the word says, "Esau have I Jacob have I loved. Esau have I hated." Jacob put that well there. Isaiah references the heritage of Jacob. There she stood looking at the manifestation of the heritage of Jacob, &gt;&gt; which was what? Birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All I want is the birthright. All I want is the birthright. All I want is the word. How do I know I'm saved? What do you want? The word. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the kingdom of God. What can you never get enough of? The word. Welcome to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; What were you just reading? What were you just feeding on over the past couple days? Oh, I heard brother Brandham was preaching and a Bible verse and I read this over here and the pastor preached this over here and then you see again, it's not those words you use in conversation cuz people do that. It's something that speaks from the heart. &gt;&gt; You see, stop looking to your brother or your sister to confirm what God's done in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And stop looking at your brother or your sister trying to confirm what God's done in them. &gt;&gt; You just need to get Christ in you. &gt;&gt; You need to focus on him and he will lead you. He said, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me." He is the bread of life. And this morning, by his grace and his sovereignty, he has broken that bread for us. Can we receive that? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you so much for coming here and speaking to us, Lord. Father, we are so grateful, Lord Jesus, that you have come and broken the bread of life to us. Lord, your word has been spoken. Your word has been given not from my own opinions, not from my own thoughts, Lord Jesus, but Father, you have come and speak spoken to us, Lord. Father, you've spoken very directly to individuals, Lord Jesus. I pray they would receive that, Lord. the devil wants to come and and come in with doubts and ideas and spirits and different things and try to turn us aside. But Lord, you have spoken. And I pray that Lord, it would be received. Now, Lord, there's a promise that said if if we would cast our breads upon the waters, if we would say if we would give it to you and and surrender it to you, you would come back and prove that word to us. You said your word would not return to you void. Father, there's going to be a bride coming on that word. And Lord, if your word has been spoken this morning, which I believe, Lord, that word will find a resting place in the heart of the bride of Jesus Christ and word will come back to word. Father, bless your people this morning. Bless this church, this assembly, Lord. May you continue to encourage them and be with them, Lord. May they just cons continue to throw themselves at your feet and say, "Father, not my will, but thy will be done." Thank you, Father. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You know, saints of God, I was thinking about love the other day, and I almost preached on that this morning. I just want to say this. True love is when you look and say, "What can I do for that person? How can I how can I encourage that person? How can I pray for that person?" You look at your wife and say, "What can I do for her?" &gt;&gt; You look for opportunities to please her, to put a smile on her face. And the wife looks at the husband and says, "What can I do to to please him? play that. Do you know that song pleasing? Yeah. Can you play that? You look and say, "I just want I just want what can I do?" And and if that's how you look at your spouse or that's how you look at your your family, you know, you'll begin to look to Christ and say, "Father, how can I please you?" Esther, who was a type of the bride of Jesus Christ, what's the difference between Esther and Vashi? Oh, you say, "Well, she didn't come when she was called." And that's true, and there's many different types. But what was the biggest thing Esther said? I only want what the king wants. &gt;&gt; In other words, she loved the man before she even knew who he was. And she began to learn about him. &gt;&gt; She fell in love. You see that right back there, the word returning to the word. Divine love, divine love in your life placed there before the foundation of the world begin to project and sovereign grace took its place. Amen. Jesus Christ himself took the place right inside of you because you said I that's perfect love agape love is perfect love says what can I do for Christ I'm not talking about how can you clean the church and all those things are good I'm talking about personally spiritually what can you do what of yourself can you surrender you say I want that word that you've spoken of to be manifested in my life then look and say God what can I do to give you more what can I do to give you more of myself. How can I give myself over to you more than I did yesterday? Now, we're talking about divine love. And when that divine love inside of you begins to project, sovereign grace takes its place. Jesus Christ steps down into you. Oh, saint, I feel right for a rapture. Let's sing this song. Pleasing, let me be pleasing to you. Pleasing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Let me be pleasing Jesus. Just make it a prayer. Lift your hands. Let everything I do &gt;&gt; be pleasing to you. [Music] Let everything that I pursue be pleasing, oh Lord, unto you. Sing it to him now. pleasing.

Thank you so much for your being attentive this morning. Pray that you can just take and say, Lord, when things get, he doesn't want you to feel overwhelmed. You know, you look at your face and you know, you look at yourself in the mirror of God's word. You can kind of feel overwhelmed sometimes. That's that spirit of discouragement. You just say, "Lord, I want to be pleasing to you." You say, "I want I want to know more of you. I want to understand you more this week." Make that your write it on your sticky note. Put it on your screen. Say, "God, I want to be pleasing to you." And as you give to him, he fills that up with himself. God bless you all this morning. Amen.
