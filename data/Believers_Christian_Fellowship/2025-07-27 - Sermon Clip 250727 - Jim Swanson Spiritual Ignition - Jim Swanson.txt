TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But you see combustion is a effect when you have the fuel and the spark and the atmosphere. Now when the gasoline for you I might lose some people here but the gasoline has to be vaporized. &gt;&gt; You could have gasoline in a big b bottle or can up here and I could throw a match right in it and put the match out. It wouldn't do anything. But you atomize that gasoline. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want you to you atomize it. That's in the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; When you atomize a gasoline, it's getting ready for ignition. &gt;&gt; And when the ignition strikes it, it has one purpose. It wants to explode. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in you. When you hear the word, you know, the fuel is the word, but the word alone is dead. &gt;&gt; The letter kleth, &gt;&gt; but the spirit gives it life. I don't care how good I rebuilt an engine. If I didn't have it ready to experience the fire of the fuel and the gas that was in there and it atomized into another a vapor, it would never start. But even if I did all that and it started, it it isn't going to go anywhere. So I can go in and sit down in the flesh seats and go to sleep. What are we do engines for? What are we coming to the message for? To move on. &gt;&gt; There has to be a move. So that's called transmission. Did you know the scripture? Oh dear. I get going on the transfiguration. When Jesus was up on the top, did you know that means transformed? &gt;&gt; Same word, &gt;&gt; transfigured. So you're transformed by the renewing. But it isn't this mind. It's the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here I'm sitting in a an old Model A that I rebuilt and I'm I'm saying, "Dad, I I think I did right." Well, son, we'll find out. And so, I got in there and turned the key on and pushed the starters on the floor and pushing and roar roar roar roar. And I said, "Dad, what's wrong?" He said, "It's not getting any fire. It's not getting any ignition." Well, Dad, I've got the key in. I He said, "No, come out here and look." and some of the plug wires. Now remember the plugs, brother Brandon, I've got the quote. He said that's where the spark comes from. &gt;&gt; And how did they receive the spark from the coil or the magneto and it sends that message down to those sparks and the sparks are the Holy Ghost. But it takes a power of the Holy Ghost to to start them going so that they sent down through the spark plug to the combustion chamber so that little vaporized gas can be ignited. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in his service. So when our brother starts to preach something and you g praise God, that ain't nothing but the truth. There's an explosion going on. &gt;&gt; It's called combustion in the realm of the spirit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't live in a church or in a in a age without having that happen in your life if you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you die and you you you're put in the grave, you're already alive in Jesus Christ while you're here because the rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not some figment and something that's going to happen way down. It's right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that rapture is a revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe faith is a revelation? Do you believe that God can come on the scene in any aspect of your life and quicken the word to you?
