better now amen amen let's take our bibles and turn to john chapter 20. we'll read the scripture together and then let you have your seats john chapter 20 we'll read two verses starting in verse 21. john 20 and 21 then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father you're so good to us lord and we're just so thankful that you have given us this opportunity to be here lord and god having been absent lord on sunday makes it even more precious to us lord we realize how wonderful these times are help us to never take them for granted lord i pray god as we come and focus our attention on you on your word

go away from here lord having been fed lord and strengthened for this life we give you preeminence and ask you to take your place among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats for a title tonight i'd like to talk about the token is the assurance the token is the assurance and this is what i was on my heart for sunday and i was been studying been meditating for many days and saturday all day i had a wonderful day i was really looking forward to sunday morning service and so now i've had a few more days to meditate on and this subject just keeps blowing up it keeps getting bigger and bigger so we'll just see how far we get today and if we don't get very far we'll finish it lord willing on sunday but but you know we've talked about uh over the last couple of weeks we talked about justification and justification by faith and how it's the imputation of righteousness and it was god's program it was god's plan that he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so that the promise would be sure to all the seed amen so that he would make sure that we wouldn't miss it he would put something in us that had the capacity to receive the word for our day and in being able to receive the word for our day he would recognize us as seed and that faith reaching out and believing god god would in turn impute unto us righteousness and not impute our sins amen and that's by grace friends amen i mean it's it it's by grace i mean by grace we believe by faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of god and so we re recognize that the capacity to believe is by grace it's something that god has done and god's portioned a portion of himself out and he knew what ground and what bed it would fall in and what time it would come forth and he intended that for to be the genuine us amen and so it's by grace and then we talked again about sanctification and we talked about you know sanctification comes by the washing of the water of the word amen the bleeding word in this day the word that bled forth and died for us is now the washing of the water of the word that's there to cleanse us amen to cleanse us from the prostitutes of denomination and unbelief and all the things that go with that and that's also an act of grace you can't clean yourself what what are you going to use to clean yourself amen what do you have that's pure what do you have in yourself and in your flesh in your mind what do you have in this earth that you can use to rid yourself amen of hybridization and rid yourself of of all the unbelief you don't have anything that you can clean yourself with so he has to clean you amen with something that he's provided and that is the bleeding word amen that is the pure word that will wash all the filth of the prostitutes away from us and that is by grace all we got to do is stand under the water of the word amen you know washes and now we want to talk about the baptism in the holy ghost and i'm just going to take one little sliver it's a huge subject but i'm just going to look at one little sliver if you allow me to do that and i'll talk about the token is the assurance but when we come back to this scripture jesus says unto them first he says in verse 21 he says peace be unto you as my father sent me even so send i you so i'm going to send you the same way my father sent me and brother ben said how did the father send him he said he went in him and so then jesus then in verse 22 and he said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive you the holy ghost now when you breathed on them it takes you all the way back to genesis chapter two when god made man and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul and now jesus is sitting there he's foreshadowing what's going to come and he breathes on them because it's the it's a symbolic of the breath of god the life of god coming in amen and and told them to receive the holy ghost now i want you to when you look at this i want to back up a little bit i want to be real simple i i hope i can be real simple tonight but i want to say it this whose idea was this was it the disciples asking for something or was it god promising something amen was it christ telling them that he was going to do something or was it the disciples asking him for a favor you realize the baptism of the holy ghost is not it's not our idea it's his idea it wasn't our desire we could never have a desire for unless he first amen promised it and so we we because of uh denominational teaching and wrong understanding i i found that within myself growing up in the pentecostal church i had the wrong understanding of the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost was always for me the carrot at the end of the stick i could never be good enough i could never get it right i could never keep from failing i mean i could never feel like i had the babies and the holy ghost every time i felt like i had an experience or a sensation or a good time at the altar then something would happen i would fail i would make a mistake and then i would have to go all the way back to the beginning and start over so the baptism of the holy ghost was always the carrot at the end of the stick and it was frustrating and you know i wanted to be right i wanted to be right with god we have a desire to be right with god and be filled with the spirit be sealed into the day of our redemption amen but but when it becomes just our desire and not his desire our you know it's something we when we begin to uh when we begin to look at it in the manner of this is something that i need i've got to have i've got to go to god and i've got to convince him to give me this instead of understanding that this has been god's plan from the beginning this is something he wanted to do he didn't tell the disciples to go get the holy ghost he told them to receive the holy ghost when we look at this word receive it's it's super interesting and in the fact he jesus initiated the whole thing by telling them that as the father sent me so send i you and when he said this he breathed on them they didn't ask for anything he breathed on them and then he's the one who initiated the action he's the one who breathed on them signifying the breath of life the spirit of god that was going to come into them amen and then he told them to receive it and so you can't receive what's not given you can't receive what's not provided he didn't tell him to go find it or go get it he told them to receive it and that term that that terminology means it's there for you to take it's there it's been given it's been breathed on you and then you just have to receive it and even the word in the greek it means it's interpreted receive take have catch it means to take to take with the hand to lay hold of any person or thing in order to use it to take up a thing to be carried to take upon oneself to take in order to carry away without the notion of violence to remove to take away to take what is one's own to take to oneself to take one's own to claim to procure for oneself amen jesus is saying just he's saying just receive it don't go find it don't make it up don't don't hunt all over just it's coming to you just receive it it's breathed on you just receive it the holy ghost is coming receive it let's turn over to acts chapter 2. i just want to lay these scriptures in as a foundation and i said i want to just be real simple because i found you know me growing up in pentecost and coming to the message initially i carried over that wrong thinking and it's taken a while for god to wash all that out of me and then you realize that that you know i'm justified by his grace for what he chose before the foundation of the world and what he did for me i'm sanctified by the washing of the water that he provided that he poured upon me that he washed me and if i receive the holy ghost it's going to be by the same thing by grace because it's something he gave that he wanted me to have that he provided that he promised and all he's asking me to do is receive it these terms are simple we make them complicated acts chapter 2 verse 37 this is the day of pentecost peter is preaching and verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said in peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do i mean i think the most important part of this at the beginning here is the fact that the word being preached in its power amen see what peter was doing was peter was standing up and he was taking old testament prophecy and he was bringing it to date and saying that is this. and he was saying the prophecy of joel is this it's not what you think you're judging this wrongly this is the fulfillment of this prophecy this is the day this is the time this is the the word for the day and they were pricked in their heart amen you realize what he's going to say next is is prerequisited by this statement that they heard the word for their day and they were pricked in their heart amen then and then peter's going to give instructions but that is what happens first the scriptures are so simple friends they said men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call now when you read that scripture just take it for face value friends and don't read a bunch of stuff into it don't bring up a bunch of baggage from the past just read what it says and i want to ask you how complicated is it in the scripture to receive the baptism of the holy ghost how difficult did peter make it on the day of pentecost amen how complicated was it amen they heard the word for their day they were pricked in their heart and they wanted to do something about it amen they believed it was true and they wanted to know what to do next and he said repent repent for all the wrong that you've done for all the wrong you've believed repent amen and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ with remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost gift of the holy ghost gift of the holy ghost as i said i want to make it so simple like it's childish because a gift is not something you earn you paid for you deserve amen it's something that's given amen it was breathed upon the church and now he's saying you shall receive it's the same word received that jesus says receive ye the holy ghost to take to take upon oneself to take in one's possession amen it's there for you to take but you have to believe it this way not over complicate it not change the scripture amen not bring pentecostal ideas and mix them in with the book of acts but just take it the way peter gave it amen that you hear the word amen the word pricks you in the heart you know that what you're hearing is the truth and you've got to do something about it and he tells you to repent be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and you shall receive i tell me how that word will ever fail how will it work for others but not work now it's to them that are far off as many as the lord our god should call amen the question is did god call you if god called you it's for you if in hearing the word your heart was pricked amen and you had the capacity to repent and be baptized in his name then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and you've got to believe it that way brother branham made this statement i thought it was so unusual because it's so true he said some people won't receive the holy ghost unless they speak in tongues now listen how important that is he's not saying they weren't eligible for it he's not saying they couldn't have it he's not saying it wasn't available he said they wouldn't receive it because they had their own idea about how it should come instead of just sticking with the scripture being pricked in the heart that that is an act of grace friends that's not something you do they weren't pricked in the mind they were pricked in the heart they were had the capacity to repent and then in obedience to the word they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and they shall receive the gift of the holy ghost because it's for you and your children and to those that are far off and as many as the lord our god shall call peter didn't make it complicated man has made it complicated and if god has called you and by his grace you're pricked in the heart you were able to receive uh repent and receive his word and be baptized in his name then the word says you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and that word receive is the same to take with the hand to lay hold of to take what is one's own to take to oneself man there's a part that god has done but he's asking us just to receive it the devil has gotten in and made things complicated let's go back to acts chapter 1. i'm going to read this scripture and i just want to read some quotes i'm going to read what brother branham said amen and there's a lot that brother brahm says on this subject there's so much that brother banh says on this subject as he preaches to so many types of people that you can find anything you want to make any doctrine say what you wanted to say on this subject that the baptism only goes it's the truth you can you you can go to the right side you can go to the left side amen but but i'm just going to read to you just just what brother benham said and there's much more like i'll tell you up front there's much more that he says you can find a lot of quotes i was coming across so many i just had to start removing them there's just too many to read but i just want to share with you what struck my heart as i read it acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and in samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth so he said after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power power for what amen you shall re receive power to be his witnesses what did the power come for this is really important the power came so that you could be his witnesses because god knew that peter couldn't do it amen and peter proved that peter couldn't do it on his own he said lord the law forsake you i'll not forsake you i'll be a witness for you but when it came to the trial peter was anything but a witness peter was anywhere but willing to stand with christ and stand on the witness stand for him or stand in the seat of judgment on his behalf peter was gone amen so he knew that the disciples because on the day that he was arrested they all scattered he already knew they were going to need some power to be his witnesses to do what he had called them to do in this life he was going to provide for them he was going to have to provide for them a power to fulfill his will because they didn't have the power in themselves brother bram says in the laodicean church age from 1960 when he's preaching on the church ages he said i offer my prayer for you now as we bow our heads our heavenly father they they are the trophies of your presence they know that these words are true because they are yours they know that they have been given by the holy spirit because they are the word of god and they have been convinced that they need you that they need sweetness of the holy spirit in their life to give them overcoming power and they will receive power from on high receive the power to live a christian life to receive power to overcome temptations see they god was not going to give them power to build a ministry power to make them feel good about themselves power to give them some sort of vindication or fleshly evidence he was giving them power to live a christian life power to be witnesses and that's the purpose of the holy ghost he was giving you the power amen to be a witness so that you could be converted so that you can be regenerated so that the holy ghost could burn the old nature out amen in the seed of life the germ of life that's laying in there can spring the life and take control and be empowered by the holy ghost they meant to live a holy ghost life because he knew your old life couldn't do it and your own nature couldn't do it so brethren saying that they may see power to live a christian life to receive power to overcome temptations as the song we're just saying was just singing they gathered in the upper room and was praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost and power for service came that's what they want power for service to come upon them now listen when i was a boy and i was in the pentecostal church i didn't want power for service amen i was scared to death of being lost and i just wanted something to prove that i wasn't lost the just the truth of it i wanted some evidence some token something to prove that i wasn't lost so i would feel more secure amen because the word wasn't enough for me and so and so they were praying brother said that you quoted the song they were in their room praying for uh that they were baptized with the holy ghost and power for service came amen the the real uh the purpose of the baptism holy ghost is to be a witness and they needed power for service because they were all hiding and fearful they weren't being a witness they weren't accomplishing god's purpose they that jesus was sending them but he's going to send them the way the father sent him he was going to go in them go with them but they couldn't do it on their own then they needed something and god knew what they needed and he was going to provide what they needed but they needed power for service and the message desperations 1963 said then the life that was in christ is the holy ghost not the third person but the same person and the form of the holy spirit coming upon you as a token that your life and your fair is paid you have been accepted until that token comes you're not permitted on the highway you're not permitted on the bus line you're not permitted to go in until you can present this token and that token is your fare and now it shows that the blood has been shed and been applied to you the price has been applied to you and you have the token that the blood has applied to you and you're accepted get it now now just know certain evidence you say brother branham i feel in your mind you see why why will i know now brother brenham is now talking about this is desperation he preaches token in the morning and i better leave it september 1st 1963 and in the evening service he preaches desperation and now he's in the beginning statements of the message desperation and he's referring back to preaching on the token and in the token brother brennan was showing that that you know he was typing it with the exodus journey and how the every house had to take a lamb they had to slay the lamb and take the blood and put it as a token over the door and that the the death angel would come and see that token he would pass over there would be safety knowing there was a lamb slain and the blood was applied and now brother is taking that and he's bringing it today and he's saying now amen there's no longer a chemistry the chemistry of the blood of jesus christ was shed amen in judea and it went into the soil went to the ground amen but it was the life that was in that blood is the token now it has to be on display the same life that was in jesus christ now comes back upon the believer in that life amen can't that can't be a life that's in the bucket the blood can't be in the bucket the blood had to be applied to the outside of the door for all to see and now it can't be a life that i say amen i have the life but it's got to be a life that's on display that's the token but now he comes and he's in desperation now and he's preaching and he says now he said the token is the evidence that the price has been paid the blood has been shed for your redemption for the forgiveness of your sins but the token now is the evidence that that's been applied to you you have the token and now brother brown says now just no certain evidence because brother ben's trying to get away from tongues being the initial evidence so no certain evidence see you say brother branham i feel it in your mind you say why will i know look what you look what you look what were you and what are you there is how you know i said i wanted to make this simple i hope we can make it super simple tonight just taking what the prophet said he's preaching he just preached token now he's preaching desperation and he's pointing back to token amen token was one of the highlight messages of his ministry and so this is a critical message he's preaching and he's saying now this token is your evidence that the blood has been applied to you that your fair has been paid that you are forgiven and you have been redeemed back to god and he says now no certain evidence no certain if he what he's talking about is pentecostal form of evidence and tongues or something like that no certain evidence he said i can feel in your mind you're asking why will i know or how will i know look what were you and what are you there is how you know simple simple see what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things just automatically go with that amen these other things he's talking about gifts and manifestations of the spirit and all of those things they go with the token but they are not the token so brother benham said you know he made it simple he said if i go buy a shoe amen i get a tongue with the shoe the tongue isn't the shoe the tongue goes with the shoe and he says when you get the token which is the baptism of the holy ghost he said the token amen all these things go with it gifts and manifestations and all kinds of supernatural things they go with it but they're not it amen and he doesn't want us to look for any certain evidence because the spirit divides us severally as he willeth we don't all do all speak with tongues do all prophesy the apostle paul is telling us that the gifts are distributed throughout the body so if we make it one certain evidence and that's not the gift the spirit has given you look out somebody's in and somebody's out so he said what was he said look at what what were you and what are you there's how you know what was you before the token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things just automatically go with it in the message paradox from 1963 he says for instance i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you now listen this is a wonderful statement because we are a paradox to ourselves we wake up every morning and look in the mirror and we find there's our enemy this is the this guy is wrong amen he he he has a hybrid nature he comes in a hybrid form with a spirit of the earth and we look at the man in the mirror and that's our enemy enemy number one amen but down on the inside by the new birth there's another life amen another nature amen it is a portion of the life of god on the inside amen it is christ for this day amen and so we are a paradox within ourselves because sometimes we have mixed messages within ourselves you have an inner man speaking and an outer man speaking so this is what brother branham is addressing he says every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodists and presbyterians in lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being he's coming back to make it simple and anyone can look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle unless that happens you cannot be a christian unless what happens unless something happens to you that changes your whole being unless you can look back and see what you were and what you are what you were before the tokens applying what you are after where your desires were where your desires are now amen and see that there's been a change that takes place amen unless that happens you cannot be a christian that's what he says unless that happens you cannot be a christian there must be a paradox for you to become a christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it so when brother enemy he keeps pointing to the same thing i got many more scriptures to read and many more we could read but brother venom is super clear he's laying this down amen that the baptism of the holy ghost is something that changes you you changes your whole being amen it's a change let's go to the book of ephesians and look at ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins quickened made alive you at the quicken who were dead you were dead in trespasses and sin you were breathing in and out and you were walking around and eating and doing that but there was something inside of you a life on the inside that was dead that was as though it was dead and you and you had the quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins and where and in time past you walked according to the courts of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom we also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others paul is not saying you're still that way paul is saying this is how you were but something's changed you had the lust of the flesh amen you were walking the same way the world was walking you had the same desires the world had you wanted the same things they wanted and you were caught up in the same things they were caught up in but something changed inside of you something brother man says through all your being heavenward amen you started loving the lord and wanting nothing but to please the lord the outside man could still fall of course the outside man could still have wrong desires but something down on the core of you changed it shifted and all your love and affection went to him no longer for the world or the things of the world are self or the desires of the flesh but something at the core of who you are amen in your soul shifted and turned heavenward what brother ben says and this he says the same thing in in the message it is the rising of the sun and now you see now you're already you were dead and sin trespasses but you've been resurrected now you're already resurrected when god raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know basically how do you know your soul changed didn't it something deep inside changed amen you've undergone a change your body came in obedience to it didn't it and obedience to what a church the word which is the life amen then you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus it's easter with you and i in jesus we are all our jesus you and i we are all resurrected together amen resurrected what to newness of life amen something was laying there amen it was shrouded over by darkness amen but there was a seed down under all the waters and all the darkness and that seed had come from god and it was waiting for the word to come to the word for life to come to life amen and under the baptism holy ghost it was quickened that seed was quickened alive and down on the core of who you are it changed some of the complicated part in our life is that the outside didn't change the inside changed and as the inside grew stronger it began to take possession of the outside man and force the outside man into obedience to the word but the outside man hasn't yet changed but the inside man who grew and has grown in the knowledge of jesus christ and grown stronger he more and more takes reign amen possessing his vessel and pulling the outer man into obedience to the inner man that's the paradox that's what's complicated because we received the baptism the holy ghost something changed all our desires went heavenward now we love him we don't love the world we hate the things of the world we hate what we are we hate what we were amen we want nothing more than to please him but we still find ourselves falling because of the old sticky caulk of our nature on the outside amen and then with a pentecostal doctrine that says if you fall then you didn't have it amen because if we have to take that mentality the holy ghost don't lie so brother branham wouldn't have had it when he told his wife to lie to the lawyer i'm so glad god had a wave sheets to show us so that we would know not just in the words but in the demonstration of a life lived that we would see the change is in the soul the core of who we are the essence of who we are the inner man the real us it changed this outside man is going to have to change to match the nature of the inside man but until then we will wrestle it into subjection because the inside man wants to wrestle it into subjection in the stature of a perfect man brother banham says well now that's the way it is trying to manufacture christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be changed so you can't this isn't reformation you can't pretend you can't brother says you can't put peacock feathers in a crow it's not going to work you can't this is the problem with some of the holiness movements amen when it was in the days of the methodist movement where all the holiness movement started and the wesleyan revival it was a genuine revival of the holy ghost moving them amen to sanctification to line their lives up with the word but when they refused to move with the light when the light moved amen now in order to maintain sanctification because it's not anymore amen they're not any more under the baptism of the holy ghost amen because the light has moved on now they had to establish rules and parameters and you know style of dress and length of dress and fabric you can use in certain colors and certain types of why because they believed what god had done and they were trying to hold on to it amen but sanctification moves right along with the pillar of fire amen when the pillar of fire moves they meant sanctification moves with it amen and so now we tried to manufacture christianity but you can't do it we live in a day where they've so failed at manufacturing christianity they just decided to water down christianity because they couldn't even manufacture it anymore so the denominations have so watered it down they've changed the definition of what it means to be a christian it used to mean if you were a christian amen you were also holy but now they've changed the definition you can be a christian and not be holy praise god but there's a people on the earth amen that can be real christians by a new birth amen but you can't manufacture you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself you don't have to worry about peacock feathers and a crow and all this you just let the nature on the inside change and let that life live and you'll have the right feathers on the outside you don't brother that said you don't have to worry about it amen sheep don't have to manufacture wool sheep bear wool it's a natural outcropping of sheep so we were living life like a goat but down on the inside was a true sheep nature amen in the baptist holy ghost amen awaken the sheep then the sheep will produce wool and he doesn't have to think about it all he has to do is feed [Music] now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again yes sir like i've always said you take a hog scrub him up and put a a tuxedo suit rather on him and turn him out there he'll go right to the mud and a hole and wallow because you see he wouldn't do any good he's a hog that's his nature wallow is his nature you've got to change his nature and the rest of it will take care of itself you notice you must be born again that is changed there's got to be a change whether it's making this so clear something on the inside has to change that's the new birth that's the quickening of the seed that's the baptism only goes something inside has got to change then everything else will come right he said i love the simplicity of you take a hog and you wash him out and you decorate him and you put nice clothes on him where will the hulk go you pluck somebody out of the world amen and you tell them all the code and conduct of living a christian life and why and explain it all amen when they get away from you and get out of the pen they will go right back to harlotry and prostitution and drug addiction and drinking why because there's nothing changed on the inside yet and it doesn't matter how much they want to live a different life because people who have lived a hog life and suffered under it amen have come to the terms with the fact i don't want to live this way anymore it's hurting me but if all we have to give them is a government and a code and a rule and and all the scriptural reasons on why you don't do this and you do do this and you don't do this and you do do this amen at some point they're going to get near a hog wallow because you can't keep them from it the world is full of it the world is is polluted this is satan's eden you can't keep people from it so it can't just be an explanation of why why the word says this and why this and you don't want to live that way anymore do you know i don't want to live that way anymore well if you don't want to live that way anymore all you have to do is this and do this and do this i'm telling you friends that's reformation that will not work the only thing that will work is transformation something has to change on the inside amen and then when that hog nature changed to a sheep nature it won't go to the wallow and if you find a sheep in a wallow i would say he slipped and fell in he didn't want to be there do you understand what i'm saying you take a sheep nature and he gets too close to a wallow and a trap set for him brother man said there's traps set for you and you're going to fall into them and then you find a sheep and a wallow i'm i rest assured he doesn't want to be there and he did not get there and then intentionally something happened hey amen i love the simplicity of it the problem is when the sheep's turned loose and he runs right back to it that ain't no sheep that's a hog with a sheep fleece stapled to it needs a change now i want to read this is a little bit of a lengthy reading but hang with me because it's so good brother branham has a private interview just before he preaches the masterpiece in 1964 and that private interview was with a sister george bruce many of you know this but i'm going to read it just so you can see i want you to see how brother branham deals with a sheep at the beginning it just tells you that this was recorded during the song service of the message masterpiece he's in his office during the song service speaking to sister george bruce and then brother man begins to say i visited you in the hospital that time and i prayed constantly god wouldn't let you die because you're of value to the church now i know you i know you're going to be all right sister bruce she was having heart problems i believe that with all my heart see and then sister george bruce says brother branham most of all i want the experience that that i've been sealed in the holy ghost and if god will reveal it to your heart she wants the experience she wants to know that she's sealed with the holy ghost this is how brother branham responds to the sister he says i believe with all my heart that you are a real born-again believer he didn't ask her did you speak with tongues did you have this sensation he looked at him and said i believe you're a real born-again believer sister bruce how could that spirit just leave now listen he's going to explain to her why she's struggling listen close when you get sick you get weary this is outer realm stuff outer moon when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person sister bruce says yes see and you get things on your mind see little bitty things it just keeps building up both ways you'll get somebody on your heart and you want to pray for them and get up and pray for it you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side satan maybe might present something to you and out this away in in your nature and god works and satan works then when satan tries to make you believe that you're not see you keep building this and maybe this and this don't look at yourself sister bruce brother what he's saying is the reason you're struggling and you have doubts about whether you've been born again he says i believe you're a real born-again believer the problem just is you get sick and you get weary and you're a nervous nature person anyways and if you get a little bitty thing on your mind you just can't rest until if it's to pray for something you can't rest until you pray but when satan gives you a thought amen you just begin to build on that and fixate upon it this is what brother brown is explaining to her he's explaining to her why she's struggling but he's not trying he's not trying to tell her how to get the baptism only goes he believes she already has it he believes it's just that outer realm that's messing with her because she's a nervous type person and she's sick with a heart condition amen and she's got this nervous condition where she she has problems amen fixating on thoughts and she can't rest until she accomplishes the deed and when the devil gives her thoughts little worries and little uh doubts make her doubt what she is then she just mulls it over and over and over i say she's not the only one there's people here amen that do the same thing now he says he said now i'm fixing to pray for you i'm not worthy of that now he just told her don't look at yourself sister bruce this is an important statement don't look at yourself i'm fixing to pray for you i'm not worthy of that i think what would i do if jesus was sitting here now and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay hands upon you with his great faith see you'd get well well i think well i'm a sinner i'm not him but i come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before god i'm not a sinner neither are you before god he said before god i'm not a sinner and neither are you we got a blood sacrifice laying there god don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of christ that's it he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice christ's blood then it's christ that's talking through us to god oh friends catch that talk about a sanctifying power in the blood to so cleanse you from you that you begin to pray amen by the anointing of the holy ghost you begin to pray through the blood it's not you anymore it's christ praying to god we just don't see ourselves right then it's christ that's talking through us to god so therefore we're not sinners no more we're christian i believe you to be a genuine christian woman i remember the thing and sister bruce says i make so many mistakes and i fail so many times oh praise god i'm so glad this was recorded friends i'm so glad god god gave this to us amen this is a gift that he has given to us sister bruce went through what she went through so that you and i would have the truth today because these are the same things we go through men we get nervous we get upset the devil begins to put doubts in our mind we fixate on and begin to wonder well was i mistaken did i really have what i thought i have and and now and then all of a sudden i'm making mistakes and brother brown's trying to get her to doc don't look at yourself amen there's one thing we're supposed to look at and this thing is simple it's straightforward amen you believe god you're pricked in the heart amen you repent you're baptized in his name and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the bible is not complicated we're not supposed to look at ourselves we're supposed to look at what the word says brother is trying to point her to the word and to the sacrifice that she has and she said i make so many mistakes and i failed so many times brother says that's why christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you he will not impute sin blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin brother branham's saying they're not allotted to you he took your mistakes your desires in your heart is to serve him sister bruce says yes your desire in your heart is to serve him she says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked not lauded to you see he is your propitiation he is your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before god christ took your sins and become you because your desire is to serve him is this complicated it's not complicated sister bruce says but i've never had an experience that i've been filled the holy goat listen listen careful but i've never had an experience that i have been filled with the holy ghost that i could put my foot on you know what that poor woman went through a lot but there's going to be some day i'm going to shake her hand and thank god thank her for enduring what she went through so that i would have the truth on these things so that i would see how a prophet deals with these things amen and now he instructs her in righteousness but i've never had an experience that i've been filled with the holy ghost that i can put my foot on all right notice this brother man's gonna he's gonna fix this all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of human being sister bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once but what changed it she says christ there you are sister that's it what's complicated about that amen the holy ghost is for you receive it amen say god i receive it you promised me that gift i've done everything you asked me to do amen you provided the faith to believe your word you're the one who pricked me in the heart and i cried out what should i do you said repent i've repented lord you said be baptized in your name i've been baptized in your name and you told me i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and i'm here lord receiving your gift [Music] because that's what the word says amen and when that gift comes to you it will change you your soul will change amen it's not just saying well i accept it i believe it those are words words don't mean anything but there has to be an experience amen brother branham was clear on that you have to have the experience of the new birth i mean we don't go back to preaching a baptist doctrine of you you receive the holy ghost when you believe brother branham was dead set against that because there's a lot of intellectual faith saying i believe now saying that i've got the holy ghost because i believe but he said you've got to have an experience there must be an experience of the baptism the holy ghost but he never attached it to any fleshly emotional evidence or sensation he said what is the experience brother brennan makes it clear the experience is a changed life that is the experience that you went through the experience of i was one way and now i'm different and i didn't change myself it wasn't alcoholics anonymous it wasn't a self-help book amen it wasn't willpower it wasn't turning a new leaf at the new year none of that worked amen but there was a supernatural power that changed me from the inside what is that amen that's the experience amen of the baptism of the holy ghost of the new birth and that's what brother bam said you have to have it can't just be a mental acknowledgement and a verbal declaration but you have to have that experience you have to change your desires have to change your thinking has to change your loves have to change oh i'm going to read that one more time is it okay i want it ingrained in our brains so the next time that the devil comes around when we're weary and tired and nervous and upset and plants thoughts on our mind we can come right back to this she says but i've never had an experience that i've been filled the holy ghost that i could put my foot on all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being she says yes that was your nature that was your nature it was my nature it changed once but what changed it she says christ there you are sister that's it there's the experience you can put your foot on that i didn't change myself he changed me man and no matter how many times this outer man trips me up in this world amen tries to trap me and there's traps laid for me and i fall into them it doesn't matter something in me has changed drastically changed the things i loved i don't love i hate the things i used to love and now i love the things i tried to avoid now brother man goes on to say he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come to the judgment but half past tense pass from death to life saint john 5 24 jesus speaking see so you you're a christian sister bruce i've watched your life i've watched you under vision and i know you're a christian brother branham is not just petting this woman and getting her out of his office he said i've watched you by vision i've watched you under vision and i know you're a christian not one spec see i am your shepherd as it was sister bruce says yes somebody to help and if there was any doubt in my mind if i thought you was something was wrong i tell you sister bruce she says i believe that but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and god as far as i know anything about it sister bruce there's not a thing there's not one thing she comes to the prophet the prophet the gift of discernment has watched her life and watched it under vision and he says as far as i know there's not one thing wrong and she was convinced something was wrong because she was looking at herself she was listening to the devil she was looking at her mistakes and she said i don't have any particular experience that i can put my foot on and brother branham takes her back to the true experience that she can put her foot on and tells her not to look at herself or a mistake there's a sacrifice there and he dispels the whole thing and it wasn't complicated it was simple it wasn't a carrot on a stick it wasn't to say well when you get the baptism holy ghost you don't have to worry about the mistakes no more you won't have them he didn't say that he just told her that's what the blood's for your mistakes are not allotted to you you're not even a sinner before god amen can you believe that for yourself friends or does it only apply to sister bruce amen but i say it's on tape and it's for me brother brahm says in satan's eden i heard brother neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't i preach on the holy ghost why didn't i do this here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it's a person jesus christ the word of god established in your heart to quicken every word of this age right watch the holy ghost in action not so much in demonstration but in action what it does according to the word because the holy ghost will lead and guide you into all truth you'll believe the word you'll receive the word you'll act upon the word amen you believe god amen you if god says dress this way you'll believe it amen you'll act upon it why because it's a power that's given to you to live a christian life it's a power that's given you to be a witness amen when the disciples the disciples believed in jesus christ they believed in the resurrection of jesus christ they had seen him amen thomas had handled him with his hands and then they had they had met him on a couple of occasions they had fed him broiled fish and honey he had cooked them dinner by this by the sea of tiberias amen they they believed that he was resurrected from the dead they believed that jesus christ was the son of god but they still needed something to give them the power to be his witness they needed to be converted they needed the baptism for the holy ghost and god knew what they would need so he provided it for them as a gift if he had made it anything else we would be troubled friends but he made it a gift and he told us to receive it amen says in the token from 1964 this is the one he preaches in march 1964 he says we realize and then he gave them a token for the assurance that they wouldn't have to be scared all upset and nervous he's referring back to the exodus journey into the passover night and he said he gave them a token and if they would just apply the token in faith that they wouldn't have to be scared upset and nervous see sister bruce was scared upset and nervous but brother brandon was bringing her back to her token she had a positive token she had a true token and he was telling her you got a true token you've got a positive token you have to have faith in that token they were giving a token for assurance that they wouldn't have to be scared or upset and nervous where he said when i see the token i'll pass over you watch how he did now he prepared first to sign a messenger identified message identification of the messenger and a token for the assurance that the way was paid they are headed for the promised land the same thing he has done today what did he do he went he sent us the holy ghost the holy ghost is the messenger and the scripture identification of himself identifies him among us the same yesterday today and forever and the token is the assurance what are you scared about our fare is already paid and we are identified with our sacrifice he can't turn you down he promised that we're identified see the token was given for an assurance but so many times in my thinking the token was anything but assurance it was fear it was dread it was it was the carrot on the end of the stick it was the fear if you if you don't get this you can't make the rapture if you don't go get this and if you don't get that you can't make the rapture and all of a sudden you know all of a sudden the assurance of the token is taken away but that's not why god gave a token he gave you the token as a seal of your destination so that you can relax and know that the earnest money has been paid you're coming to the fullness of redemption he gave you the token which brother bam tells us what the token is what is the token it's his life in you amen that's the token and it must be on display and that is for assurance not for fear amen that is so we can relax not so that we can get upset that is so that we can be sure that the way is paid the earnest money is down it's secure amen the blood has been applied everything is under the blood amen the destination is sure and secure everything is fine the boxcar is sealed amen it won't be unsealed until it makes its destination and how do you know amen what manifestation did you have what sensation did you have amen i don't know i'm not going to tell you my experience my sensation or my emotion but i'll tell you my experience my experience was there were things in my life i couldn't overcome there was things i hated there was things that cost me personally there was things that made my life difficult but just like a hog to its wallow no matter how much i turned over a new leaf or made a resolution or didn't want to do that i was like the hog right back in the wallow until something in me changed amen and now i don't want that there's nothing in me that wants that i want to stay as far away from the wallow as i can get amen what was it it wasn't my willpower it failed amen it wasn't a new year's resolution it failed it wasn't a buddy system it failed it was the power of almighty god coming in to quicken a seed on the inside and now all my desires i had selfish desires and fleshly desires and worldly desires but they all turned heavenward and now my greatest desire from the depths of my soul was to serve him to love him to be one with him and i didn't make it happen it just happened it's not a pretend it's not a put on it's not words amen it's something down in the core of me all i want is him amen i want to please him i want to be with him i want to talk to him it doesn't mean i always spend the right amount of time and devotion it doesn't mean i always pray like i should it doesn't mean i'm always faithful but down inside the desire has never left it's never went away all i want is him all i love is him all my desire is to my bridegroom what is that that's the evidence i can put my foot on because i didn't do it he did it in me i didn't make it happen i played church i grew up playing church i grew up pretending to be a christian but no matter how much i raised my hand in church and no matter how much i went to all the meetings i mean i couldn't change the desire for sin on the inside so i won't tell you all the things that god did and the way he spoke and the sensations and all the personal things he did for me because i don't want you to ever feel like you've got to do that same thing or god will deal with you the same way but i'll share with you the same thing you can have and that's an experience of a change in the soul a new birth experience and you must have it amen brother bannon said the fundamentals go by believing i receive the holy ghost when i believe the pentecostals go by amen emotion and experience but brother brethren was able to pierce it right down the middle but you have to have an experience of a new birth a change in the soul our youth everybody you got to have an experience of a change amen you're born amen you may have been born into a message family you may have been raised up amen believing the truth amen there's nothing wrong with that but there's still an old nature on the inside no matter how much you want to be a christian and love god and serve god amen there's something in you keeps pulling you to sin and pulling you the wrong thoughts and wrong desires and but you need to cry out to god and say god i'll receive that holy ghost if it's a gift it's a gift for me i've done everything you said to do and i need that gift to change me amen to to take my whole heart and set it on you you can't do it yourself i don't know many of you can probably testify of your of your days in the reformation and how tired you were in the reformation and how exhausted you were in the reformation because you can never get it right but i'll tell you amen there's a change that comes in experience of the baptism holy ghost where i still don't get it right but something in me has changed and will never change back something has shifted amen something has turned towards heaven towards our god and it's not turned back and i still don't always get it right amen but something's right on the inside and it wasn't something i did it was something he did by grace not by works not by effort not by a certain meeting not by a certain word not by a certain action but by grace praise god brother brahm says in desperations so now in the same thing about this token the token we have talked to we have talked to the token all along the way but now is the manifestation of the token the life of christ living through us what do we have to do to produce that nothing you just yield to it you just surrender now we have we have sometimes allowed it the lutheran allowed it to accepting the word accepting christ's personal savior the method is said when you get happy enough to shout that's it the pentecostal says speak in tongues then you got it and we found out that all of it was wrong see the token is the token it's you and christ as persons together see it's the holy spirit his life in you working his own life through you it's not what you do it's what you surrender to it's not what you do but it's what he does through you as you surrender to him and surrender as you surrender to the word you surrender to him and the life of the word begins to flow and become the token on display in the message of the token he says i believe there's so much tommy rotten people saying they shouted they spoke in tongues i believe in those things but you can't rely on that how can you rely on that and then deny the word the token is the word identified in you living itself out that's god being his own interpreter you don't have to say well now you interpret my tongue that ain't it he interprets your life by the word why because the the life on the inside begins to take the life on the outside and bring it subject to the word amen and all your desires turned heavenward again in the token he says don't you rely upon no speaking in tongues no nothing else but let the token itself be there the person of jesus christ his own life in you circumcise not just this and that but circumcise your whole being till you and christ are one christ in you and his life lives out through you you have to come into a union with christ so we start off brother the lord jesus told us that he was going to send the holy ghost and he told him he breathed on them and told him to receive it so he promised he would send it not their idea his not their request his promise before they could ask he already provided before they knew what they needed he had already told them what they would have then we moved into the to the experience of a changed life but i want to end with just a couple quotes when we talk about the evidence these things are different there's a promise there's an experience and there's an evidence this is what brother man talks about the promise is for whosoever is pricked in the heart and can repent and be baptized in jesus name and receive the holy ghost if you can do that it's for you the experience is the experience of a changed life but here's the evidence in the smyrna church age from the church age book probably says see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and god bought back jacob because jacob alone was seed jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of god if you are a true seed you will hear the word yes listen i love what brother brennam says brother baby say if you were true seed you better hear the word that's not what he's saying amen but we have taken what he said and we've made it we manufactured it through a reformation say if your true seed you'll listen to tapes every day and if you don't listen to the tapes and read your bible you're not seed that's the devil if i've ever been seen i'll always be seed and if i go through a dry spell and i don't listen to tapes for a week and i don't read my bible and i don't pray for a month i'm still seed you can't change that amen you can't change amen with your seed or not amen but i tell you if your genuine seed have been born again amen by the spirit of god you can't wait to get back to god amen if you drift away and then you recognize what's going on there's something in you that longs to be back in fellowship with him you're not satisfied that way you're not happy living that way you may find yourself in dry places you may find yourself amen in situations where you've neglected amen but you're not satisfied there if you've been born again by the spirit of god but if your seed your seed you're always seed always worth seed and nothing's going to change them so brother branham is not saying if your seed you better listen to the message of your seed you better agree with it that just makes a bunch of pretend but here's what he says if you're a true seed you will hear the word amen that happened to me if your true seed you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you into the body of christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you again no jesus was the royal seed he lived in a human body then spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to jordan was there baptizing water upon obeying the word the holy spirit came upon him and the voice said this is my beloved son hear ye him the voice did not say this has become my son jesus was the son the holy ghost positioned him has that son before them all then having been filled thus and the same pattern holds at pentecost and ever after he went and demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of god and from god for that day listen what he said the spirit moved him the word was expressed moved into jordan he was baptized amen in jordan and then the holy ghost came upon him he didn't say this has become my son he said this is my son that's why the holy ghost came upon him because he already was a son and he was walking in obedience to the word to be baptized in jordan and when he walked in obedience to the word to be baptized in jordan because he was a son obeying the word the holy ghost came do you think it's different for you no the pattern is set it's the same if you're a son of god walking and obeying you hear the word you believe it's true you walk in obedience to the word he comes down receive him just say be it unto me lord i receive it in jesus name lord let it change me change me lord i need the experience of a change praise god then the saint peter holds true at pentecost forever but he says then having been filled thus he went and demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of god and from god for that day what was part of the holy ghost coming upon him the fact that he received the full revelation of god and from god for that day it wasn't just the demonstration it was the receipt it was the ability to receive the full revelation from god and of god so many times we fixate on one thing and we forget there was a whole life of jesus christ that was lived it wasn't just opening blind eyes he did that amen in that power still in the bride because wherever christ is that power is there amen the power to lay hands on the sick and healed and the power to anoint with all it's here friends but he also had a character like no other character amen and it doesn't matter how many uh i mean how many times you lay hands on the stick and they're healed but if you got temper enough to fight a buzzsaw and men it won't even obey the word there was a character that went with it and there was the ability to receive revelation from god that went with it as well it was a full package it goes on in the quote to say now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is that you never sin again it's not what he said the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives is that complicated it's simple and questions and answers from 64 he says there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that i know of and that is a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour i say thank you lord because i have that and i didn't give that to myself i have that despite myself i have it because he gave me a gift of faith i believe there's something in me to believe the word with so we have a promise to you to those who hear the word and pricked in their heart who repent and are baptized in his name there's a promise to you to receive the holy ghost and you have an experience of a change in the soul and you have the evidence of being able to receive the word for your day it's not complicated it's simple but you can't manufacture it it's not complicated it's not hard but you can't do it that's the catch-22 it's not complicated to understand the scripture's plain the message is plain it's not complicated it's not hard but you can't do it the only way that will ever happen to you is if you're a seed of god and your name is written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and if you are seed then you will hear the word the spirit will baptize you with the battle when it goes and you will receive the word for your day and hour why because he already determined it will happen it's by his grace let's read john 16 together musicians if you'd come mr blake if you come read this last scripture together i've got a lot more but i'm going to wait for sunday and see how the lord leads john 16 verse 13. how be when he the spirit of truth is come what's his title this time spirit of truth truth what is the message of the hour the truth when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for you shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you this is part of the work of the holy spirit the spirit of truth will lead you into all truth and he will take what comes from the father all that the father is christ is the sons and what's the sons he'll give it and show it to you where did this revelation come from amen the spirit of truth from the father how did you receive it amen did you work your way up to it how did the apostle paul receive it he was going the wrong direction but because he was a seed it had to come to him how did you receive it because you're a seed it had to come to you we just have to have enough faith to say lord it's me i receive it lord i receive it because you told me to receive it i receive it because i'm a candidate for it i receive it because i believe it now lord as i receive your spirit change me lord give me the experience of a changed life something that i can put my foot upon i mean let's all stand i hope that that was helpful god did not make the gospel complicated but he made it impossible chew on that for a while he did not make the gospel message complicated but he made it impossible that you cannot take peacock feathers and stick it in a crow it's impossible to do it yourself it's impossible to work your way up to it it's impossible to reform somebody into it it's impossible the gospel is impossible for you to do yourself but it's not complicated it's simple if your seed you will hear the word he will baptize you with his spirit and you will receive the word for your day and i say thank you god you will be converted by the holy ghost you will have what they had in the upper room when they couldn't get over themselves they couldn't stop from tripping over their own feet amen there's something that came into them that was a life amen that was not their own it was a new life it became a new creation amen and if your seed you'll hear the word he'll baptize you with the spirit that seed in you will be quickened to a new life amen the old nature will die out in the soul amen and the nature of the seed will come to life and you will hear the word for your day and you will obey and god will get all the glory because you couldn't do it the gospel is simple but it's impossible it can't be it can't be bought it can't be earned it can only be received i say lord give me a heart to receive it let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word god i'm so thankful this evening that you saw fit to have a little woman by the name of sister george bruce go through a trial in her life and have a condition of nervousness lord and a heart issue so that she would need your prophet lord and that conversation would be recorded lord and laid on a tape for me so that i could hear it in 2021 and i could know your attitude and approach lord toward the baptism of the holy ghost god you're so mindful of your children you're so sensitive you're so gentle with us lord you're so mindful of our need that you look 60 years in advance and make sure you provide something that we would need so that we wouldn't be deceived by the devil so that we wouldn't be tripped up by his lies so that we could see and hear the truth lord and it could be applied lord by faith and we could tell the devil that he's a liar and that your word is true god i pray that you bless your people that are here lord god if there's anybody that's being lied to by the devil i pray god that what we heard from your prophet tonight i pray that it would dispel all the lies and they'd be able lord to just resist the devil so that the devil will flee that they could go back and put their foot upon that experience lord where their life was changed and god if there's those here who have not yet had the experience of the baptism of holy ghost i pray that you quicken it to him now in jesus name that you give them a faith to open their heart and receive it lord the simplicity that you gave it and that you'll come in and that you'll do a work that they could never do themselves that you'll bring a change lord from the soul that they could never do on their own and i pray god that they would have an experience of a changed life the power to live a christian life god move i pray move on each of us lord continue to mold us into your image
