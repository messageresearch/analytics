[0:00] if you put the works the labor the
[0:02] effort of
[0:03] cain against the labor and effort of
[0:05] abel
[0:06] cain's works far outweighed the works of
[0:09] abel
[0:10] his effort and the beauty and all that
[0:12] he put into his sacrifice
[0:14] far outweighed that of abel but in god's
[0:17] scale
[0:18] when he saw faith amen when he saw faith
[0:20] in the word for the hour
[0:22] god saw it this way amen
[0:26] and cain felt justified in his own
[0:30] actions and when god would not accept it
[0:33] instead of humbling himself and being
[0:35] judged
[0:36] he became angry with god and when god
[0:39] told him just to do like abel does he
[0:41] goes and he has a conversation with abel
[0:43] and after he has that conversation with
[0:44] abel he decided to kill
[0:46] abel and why did he kill abel because
[0:48] when there was a voice of god
[0:52] cable abel had the revelation he had the
[0:55] word
[0:56] he had the path back to god amen he knew
[0:58] what the atonement was
[1:01] he knew what needed to be judged he knew
[1:03] how to come to the judgment and when he
[1:06] had the revelation he was the voice of
[1:08] god
[1:09] to cain amen and cain could not endure
[1:12] that voice amen and he wanted to hide
[1:14] from the voice
[1:15] and the only way to hide from the voice
[1:17] was to stop the voice
[1:18] amen and to kill his brother because his
[1:20] own works were evil
[1:24] and that's why john says marvel not when
[1:27] the world hates you amen
[1:29] because you're testifying amen there's a
[1:32] path back to god
[1:33] and all these other paths are wrong amen
[1:36] they're a man's own
[1:37] doing man's own achievement man's own
[1:39] covering he is
[1:40] there's no atonement in it amen there's
[1:43] no covering
[1:44] but you have to come to the judgment to
[1:46] recognize what went wrong in the garden
[1:48] what's wrong with religion what was
[1:50] wrong with the church age is
[1:51] why we need a judgment today
[1:54] [Music]
[1:54] [Applause]
[1:55] and when you begin to become that voice
[1:58] of revelation
[1:59] amen now the voice is in you amen the
[2:02] voice of god is in the bride and it's
[2:04] the voice of god
[2:05] walking in the garden of his bride in
[2:08] the cool of the evening
[2:09] amen and it's testify your very life
[2:13] amen your very confession
[2:14] what by revelation you understand is
[2:17] testifying
[2:18] that the works of religion are evil
[2:23] what's evil feeding the poor feeding the
[2:25] poor is not evil
[2:27] going to church amen giving tithe
[2:30] supporting missionaries
[2:31] printing bibles i mean that's not even
[2:32] what's evil
[2:34] is rejecting the judgment and the true
[2:36] atonement amen and not coming through
[2:38] the judgment in this hour
[2:40] to have your father make an atonement
[2:42] for you then feeling
[2:44] self-justified by your own works and
[2:46] your own covering
[2:48] those works are evil
