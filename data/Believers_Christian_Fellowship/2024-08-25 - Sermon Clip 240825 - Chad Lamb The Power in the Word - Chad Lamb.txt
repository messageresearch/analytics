========================================

that's why our confidence is what God's done not what we're doing what God's done this is something that I have to constantly remind myself because you know we as human beings we get passionate about things and I'm I'm truly passionate about this message but my personal passion in the message can move me amen Beyond uh certain barriers and trying to press and trying to push or trying to conjure something up make something happen or push something before it's time or persuade or push people into a certain Conformity amen amen and and and that's one of the errors that we can make as people it's one of the errors we can make make as ministers is that we're trying Amen to use our passion amen and our Force to produce something in the kingdom of God but God has his own method for producing something he sent his word amen that's his method and if I've Got Confidence in the word he sent that word's not going to return into him void he doesn't need me to apply extra pressure all I need to do is preach the word and let the word take effect cuz the word will take effect am amen and and I don't say that to condemn any preaching style because we absolutely understand God calls different men for different things and every once in a while we need somebody amen who has the ability to call call us on the carpet and call us to question amen but that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is I don't need to do something to make the the word take effect in your life all that I've got to do is proclaim the truth that he's proclaimed to me and if it's the true word of God it'll have the life of the word inside of it and it'll bring life out of you if you've got a seat of God I don't need to use my personality I don't need to use a church discipline I don't need to use peer pressure we don't need to use guilt trips we don't need to use anything to get the word to produce all we need to do is preach the word keep it as true as we know how to keep it keep ourselves out of the way as much as we know how to keep ourselves out of the way and if we can do that that word's going to produce the results and it doesn't matter if you say it in a whisper or you say it at the top of your voice it's not the inflection of your voice or the volume that you say it with it's not how dynamic or how boring it's the power of the spoken word it's the foolishness of preaching it's God's Method All We've got to do is have confidence in God's method and let the word do the work oh I'm more convinced than ever and I Don't Preach that to you I preach that to me because sometimes I feel constrained I see things that aren't lined up and I got we got to fix this we got to fix that and I stay awake at night sometimes wondering what should we do about this situation or that situation and I've come to terms with myself that there's nothing that I have the power to do it's the power is in the word you got to preach the word
