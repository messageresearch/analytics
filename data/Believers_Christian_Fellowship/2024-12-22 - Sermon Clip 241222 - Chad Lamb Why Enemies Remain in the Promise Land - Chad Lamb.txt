========================================

I hope that you understand this friends when you resist the devil amen and you take the word and you believe the word and you don't get Deliverance right away and it doesn't look like it's working amen God's not God's not upset at you because it didn't work because you can't do anything without him anyways amen failing is not the problem it's when we stop trying that's the problem when we stop believing when we stop pushing when we stop fighting that's the problem when we put it under tribute that's why he was angry and when they put him under tribute he says now I'll not drive them out but they'll remain and be thorns in your flesh and then we go a little further in Judges chapter 2 and look what he says now Judges chapter 2 verse 20 and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened into my voice I also will not henceforth drive out any from from before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that that through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep my way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivering he them into the hand of Joshua he left them but he left them for a purpose he left them so that he could prove Israel and then if you look at that last verse again he said therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily oh there's some hope in the word hastily that doesn't mean he'll never drive them out he just not going to drive them out hastily because now he's going to use them to prove Israel now there's a purpose in them staying there and when they fulfilled their purpose they'll be driven out amen and we know under the ministry of Solomon they were they were driven out under the son of David Ministry amen he never said it was going to be there forever he said now I'm not going to drive them out I'm not going to drive them out hastily oh praise God if you give a child of God one Speck of Hope and Faith he's going to hold on to that amen he's going to say did you read the word hastily everybody else will say he said he's not going to drive them out he won't drive them out he won't drive them out but you get somebody with faith planted down in their soul they'll look at a little word called hastily and said hey praise God he said hastily that's the difference between a Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever will look for the excuse to disbelieve the believer will look for the excuse to believe they'll look for the fraction the word they'll look for an exclamation point they'll look for a comma in a certain spot they're looking for a reason to trust God they're looking for a reason to believe the unbeliever is looking for a reason not to believe and God gives them plenty of reasons then you start adding up words and quotes and scriptures and he says he says don't remove won't remove allow to remain he said that four times in the Book of Judges but the believer says but he said hastily once and all I need is once amen you have four times it will not remove I have one time of hastily and I believe he's going to remove this enemy day amen
