[12:12] in life through all the trials and
[12:15] circumstances you keep drawing Lord and
[12:17] you keep making a way God we pray that

[12:22] just draw us into yourself that you
[12:24] would break the bread of life and feed
[12:26] it to us Lord and that may we grow Lord

[12:59] the unveiling of the amateur Gods this
[13:01] will be part four I believe if you'd
[13:03] like while you're standing turn to First
[13:05] Peter with me and and we'll begin
[13:08] reading a verse out of First Peter uh I
[13:11] just want to let you know that um uh
[13:13] many of you probably got the email we
[13:15] sent an email out today that this coming
[13:17] Sunday will be our first summer
[13:19] Fellowship dinner in the fellowship hall
[13:21] after the service so all the information
[13:23] is on the email or on the bulletin board
[13:25] so you can review those also I forgot on
[13:28] Sunday to mention that uh it was nice to
[13:31] be at the graduation open house for our
[13:33] two high school graduates sister Heidi
[13:35] bird and brother Keat Hatfield God bless
[13:37] you it was good to be your graduation
[13:39] and we want to say congratulations for
[13:41] that achievement also we had some
[13:43] college graduates that graduated this
[13:44] year we forgot to mention them as well
[13:47] sister Martha saasu graduated brother
[13:50] Gabriel golden brother Zachary golden
[13:52] and brother Samuel pittsenbarger all
[13:54] graduated college this year so
[13:56] congratulations God bless you all and
[13:59] may God uh guide you in your next stage
[14:02] of Life in The Next Step amen we're all
[14:04] rooting for you and we're all pulling
[14:05] for you amen all right let's look at
[14:08] First Peter together while we're
[14:10] standing Now 1 Peter chapter
[14:14] 2 and verse
[14:19] 9 1 Peter chapter 2:9 says but you are a
[14:23] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[14:26] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[14:29] should show forth the Praises of him who
[14:31] ha called you out of Darkness Into His
[14:34] Marvelous Light man God bless you as you
[14:37] have your
[14:39] seat praise
[14:41] God so as we continue on here we're
[14:44] going to take the thought tonight of um
[14:46] the subtitle of Kings and Priests and we
[14:49] see Peter's writing here that you are a
[14:52] chosen generation a royal priesthood and
[14:55] so I'm I'm going to be emphasizing a lot
[14:57] on the uh priest that we've been called
[14:59] to be priest a royal priesthood and
[15:01] priest and kings and uh we'll just see
[15:04] how the Lord leads let's turn from here
[15:06] over to Romans chapter
[15:12] 8 Romans chapter 8 we'll pick up another
[15:17] scripture as we begin
[15:32] Romans 8:
[15:36] 29 for whom he did Forno he also did
[15:39] predestinate to be conformed to the
[15:41] image of his son that he might be the
[15:43] firstborn among many Brethren and so now
[15:46] we recognize that we have been
[15:49] predestinated to be conformed into the
[15:51] image of his son and so Jesus Christ was
[15:54] the god man on Earth amen he was God
[15:57] Amen formed into the form a flesh he was
[15:59] God man and he became an example for us
[16:02] now we're the amateur Gods he was
[16:03] fullness we're not fullness and brother
[16:06] B says it this way in the message as the
[16:08] eagle stirs her nest said he is messiah
[16:12] messiah is the anointed one and we are
[16:15] his children which have a lesser
[16:16] anointing so we as Jehovah Eagle is a
[16:19] great eagle and we are eaglets he's
[16:21] Messiah and we with the same anointing
[16:24] are Messi
[16:25] hates amen anointed Messiah means the
[16:28] anointed one are are you anointed amen
[16:30] what with the same spirit that he was
[16:32] anointed with we have it in measure he
[16:35] has it without measure he was God
[16:37] manifest In the Flesh and we're sons of
[16:39] God parts of him come on yes sir the
[16:43] very works that I do shall you do also I
[16:46] might take a spoonful of water out of
[16:48] this ocean out here and you never miss
[16:51] it in the ocean but remember the same
[16:53] chemicals that's in the entire ocean is
[16:55] in the spoon same water that's just more
[16:57] of it out there so that's what it is so
[17:00] now he comes and he calls us he was
[17:02] Messiah he was the Great Eagle we're
[17:04] eaglets he was the Messiah we're messet
[17:07] amen he was the anointed one we're also
[17:09] anointed ones he had it without measure
[17:12] he had means he had a full portion we
[17:14] have a measure of the same life that was
[17:16] in Jesus Christ is in Us by measure and
[17:19] then brother I'm uses the analogy of
[17:21] taking a teaspoon and dipping it into
[17:23] the ocean that's a measure but in the
[17:25] measure is all the quality that is in
[17:28] the whole ocean is in the measure so
[17:31] there's potential laying in there that
[17:33] everything that is in an ocean is in the
[17:35] spoon so it's not the whole thing but
[17:37] it's it partial but partial doesn't mean
[17:39] that it doesn't have all the
[17:40] capabilities and capacity to be the same
[17:43] thing what is it ocean water there ocean
[17:46] water in
[17:47] here life of God in him life of God in
[17:52] us and we've been con we've been
[17:55] predestinated to be conformed into the
[17:58] image of his son meaning that's what we
[18:00] reflect we'll reflect that life Jesus
[18:03] Christ was the reflection of God on
[18:05] Earth and this bride in the end time is
[18:08] supposed to be the reflection of Jesus
[18:11] Christ amen so let's turn to Revelation
[18:14] now Revelation chapter
[18:22] 1 Revelation chapter
[18:26] 1 and uh I'd like to read verse 5 and 6
[18:29] Revelation 1 15
[18:31] and6 and from Jesus Christ who is the
[18:34] faithful witness in the first begotten
[18:36] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[18:37] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[18:40] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[18:42] and hath made us Kings and Priests unto
[18:44] God and his father to him be glory and
[18:47] Dominion forever and ever so if you look
[18:50] here brother B highlights this but he
[18:52] says the scripture says and hath made us
[18:55] Kings and Priests that means this isn't
[18:57] something that's going to happen in the
[18:58] future this is something that Christ has
[18:59] already done he hath made us Kings and
[19:02] Priests and in the church age book he
[19:05] says he hath made us oh there are
[19:09] certain truths we need to
[19:11] emphasize this is one of them he ha he
[19:15] hath made us salvation is his doing
[19:18] salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he
[19:20] redeemed us for a purpose he bought us
[19:23] for a purpose we are Kings spiritual
[19:26] Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon
[19:28] on the earth with him when he sits on
[19:30] his throne but now we are spiritual
[19:32] Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual
[19:34] Kingdom so now we are Kings and priest
[19:37] he hath made us my brother so clear to
[19:39] tell us that that's a spiritual Kingdom
[19:41] we ruling now and in the Millennium that
[19:44] spiritual Kingdom will be both spiritual
[19:45] and natural because we'll be ruling and
[19:47] reigning with him for a thousand
[19:50] years but try to be a king naturally now
[19:53] just go up to the government and say you
[19:55] know I'm a king try to cut in line at
[19:58] the MV and
[20:00] see see how that works for
[20:04] us but now we're spiritual Kings and we
[20:08] Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom the same
[20:11] quote further down he says right now we
[20:13] reign with Christ having Dominion this
[20:16] is where we have our Dominion this is
[20:17] where we rule having dominion over sin
[20:21] as unbelief and all the attributes
[20:24] thereof we can rule over that over sin
[20:28] the world that's the cosmos that's this
[20:30] world order that influences us the wrong
[20:32] way we can have dominion over that wrong
[20:35] influence over sin the World the Flesh
[20:39] that's our own bodies that we dwell in
[20:43] and the
[20:44] devil
[20:46] amen praise God so I read that again
[20:50] right now we reign with Christ having
[20:52] dominion over sin the World the Flesh
[20:54] and the devil showing forth his praise
[20:57] and glory showing forth
[20:59] himself for it is Christ in US willing
[21:01] and doing of his good pleasure yes
[21:03] indeed even now we are seated in
[21:05] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and made
[21:09] us priests yes priests unto him offering
[21:12] the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips
[21:15] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[21:17] unto him worshiping him in spirit and in
[21:19] truth interceding and
[21:22] petitioning priests and Kings unto our
[21:25] God no wonder the world does not appeal
[21:27] to us and we are UL your people zealous
[21:29] unto good works we have been recreated
[21:32] in him to be children like unto our
[21:35] father so that is what we're supposed to
[21:38] be doing now the New Birth has come and
[21:40] recreated Us in to uh we we we have been
[21:45] recreated in him to be children like our
[21:47] father so we're here to reflect his life
[21:49] so part of this this this royal
[21:52] priesthood part of him making us priests
[21:54] already is that we offer him spiritual
[21:57] praise
[21:59] and through Sanctified lips we're
[22:01] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[22:03] so our sacrifices our s uh giving it as
[22:05] a sweet offering un him worshiping him
[22:08] in spirit and truth but also interceding
[22:10] and petitioning now that interceding and
[22:12] petitioning is part of the priesthood
[22:14] that's actually not for us but it's for
[22:18] others interceding and petitioning on
[22:20] behalf of
[22:21] others and so we are already Kings and
[22:25] Priests as priests we worship Him in
[22:28] spirit in truth we offer to him a
[22:30] sacrifice of our Lives we worship Him
[22:32] and praise him with Sanctified lips but
[22:33] we are also interceding and petitioning
[22:36] before him because that's what the
[22:38] priesthood on Earth was doing the
[22:40] priesthood had established through the
[22:42] Levites and through the sons of Aaron
[22:44] they were there to intercede on behalf
[22:46] of Israel before God they were
[22:48] interceding on behalf of God and
[22:50] petitioning God Amen to to to bring his
[22:53] favor upon the people to forgive their
[22:55] sins Amen to to to for whatever they
[22:57] were interceding and petitioning that
[22:59] was the role of the priest and now we've
[23:01] been made
[23:03] priests
[23:05] amen praise God let's turn together to
[23:09] Luke chapter
[23:11] 9 now remember we have to be conformed
[23:15] to His Image we have to do this in his
[23:17] likeness or in his
[23:19] nature so when we're unveiling the
[23:23] unveiling of the amateur Gods means the
[23:25] amateur Gods should look like God
[23:29] yeah it should be a reflection of God
[23:31] the the the the priesthood should be a
[23:33] reflection of his priesthood our our our
[23:36] kingship be should be a reflection of
[23:37] his kingship everything should be in a
[23:39] reflection of God if we're the amateur
[23:41] gods or a portion of God or a part of
[23:43] God it should be a reflection of what
[23:45] God is not something that's we've
[23:48] conjured up in our own minds not our own
[23:51] desires not our own will being exort
[23:53] exerted or hybrid or mingled in with the
[23:57] will and word of God but but it's
[23:58] something that we surrender ourselves to
[24:00] and his life comes in and lives through
[24:02] us and it has to be a reflection of his
[24:04] life so in Luke
[24:07] 951 Luke chapter
[24:10] 9 we're going to read verse
[24:14] 51 says and it came to pass when the
[24:17] time was come that he should be received
[24:18] up he steadfastly set his face to go to
[24:21] Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his
[24:24] face and they went and entered into the
[24:26] village of Samar of the Samaritans to
[24:28] make ready for him and they did not
[24:31] receive him because his face was as
[24:32] though it would go to Jerusalem and when
[24:34] his disciples James and John saw this
[24:36] they said Lord wilt thou that we command
[24:39] fire to come down from heaven and
[24:41] consume them even as Elias did but he
[24:45] turned and rebuked them and said ye know
[24:48] not what manner of spirit you are of for
[24:52] the son of man has not come to destroy
[24:54] men's lives but to save them and they
[24:58] went to another Village so here we
[25:00] reflect the the ministry of the son of
[25:03] man and remember the ministry that's
[25:05] continuing on is the son of man Ministry
[25:07] continue on in Bride form because he
[25:09] left a part of his work that he didn't
[25:11] didn't finish he left it to be finished
[25:13] in and through the bride so now there's
[25:15] a continuation of his ministry and here
[25:17] they are in the day where Jesus Christ
[25:20] is rejected in this Village of the
[25:21] Samaritans and and and they don't
[25:23] receive him and James and John they get
[25:25] the idea like the Old Testament prophet
[25:28] let's just let's just call fire down
[25:30] from heaven and the and and they they
[25:32] feel like they're doing a good thing
[25:33] bringing judgment amen upon these people
[25:36] who rejected the Messiah rejected Jesus
[25:38] Christ and Jesus says you don't know
[25:40] what Spirit you're of for the son of man
[25:43] I have not come here to destroy life but
[25:45] I have come here to save
[25:47] life and so then if that was the purpose
[25:50] of the son of man what is the son of
[25:51] man's Ministry in you what's the purpose
[25:53] of that Ministry in you and I not here
[25:56] to destroy but here to save
[25:59] sa amen so salvation is part of the
[26:04] purpose amen of us being sons of God
[26:07] amateur Gods upon the Earth amen it's
[26:09] part of the continuation of the life of
[26:12] Jesus Christ let's go to Hebrews chapter
[26:26] 2 remember we we are a a royal
[26:30] priesthood we've been called we he has
[26:33] made us Kings and Priests but we want to
[26:36] know what kind of priest and after what
[26:38] order because it's not going to be after
[26:39] the order of Aaron because that was the
[26:42] Jewish order after the sons of Aaron
[26:44] that that has that has run its course
[26:48] but we have to find out what kind of
[26:49] priest we are so let's go to Hebrews
[26:52] chapter
[26:56] 2:14 now for as much then as the
[26:59] children are partakers of Flesh and
[27:01] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[27:04] of the same but through death he uh that
[27:08] through death he might destroy him that
[27:10] had the power of death that is the devil
[27:12] and deliver them who through fear of
[27:14] death were all their lifetime subject to
[27:16] bondage for verily he took not on him
[27:18] the nature of angels but he took on him
[27:20] the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all
[27:23] things it behooved him to be made like
[27:25] unto his his Brethren that he might be a
[27:28] merciful and faithful high priest in
[27:31] things pertaining to God to make
[27:33] reconciliation for sins of the people
[27:36] for in that he himself hath suffered
[27:39] being tempted he is able to secure or to
[27:42] help them that are tempted now here's
[27:45] what's really important Jesus Christ
[27:47] came to be our high priest amen but how
[27:49] did he come he came in flesh why did he
[27:52] come in flesh he came in flesh so that
[27:55] he would have an understanding of what
[27:57] it's like for you and I to live in flesh
[28:00] so that he could be a faithful high
[28:01] priest so he took on not the nature of
[28:03] angels but the Seed of Abraham that
[28:05] means he came in
[28:06] flesh amen so I'm going to read 17 Again
[28:11] therefore in all things it behooved him
[28:13] to be made like unto his Brethren that
[28:15] he might be why did he do that so that
[28:18] he could be a merciful and faithful high
[28:21] priest and things pertaining to God to
[28:24] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[28:26] people for in that he himself s has
[28:28] suffered being tempted he is able to
[28:30] secure them that are tempted he was
[28:33] tested he was tested in the wilderness
[28:34] he was tested with all kinds of
[28:36] rejection and affliction and he un he
[28:38] come in flesh so that he would
[28:40] understand so that he could be a
[28:41] merciful and faithful high priest so
[28:44] that means god came into flesh to become
[28:47] a high priest and he took on not the not
[28:50] the seed of angels not the likeness of
[28:51] angels but the Seed of Abraham to be
[28:53] made like his Brethren to be a merciful
[28:55] and faithful high priest and that he's
[28:57] tempted he's able to help those that are
[29:00] tempted he came down to be like us only
[29:03] he was sinless but he came down to be
[29:05] like us to taste of a fleshly experience
[29:08] so that he can be the right kind of
[29:10] priest and now think about this friends
[29:13] now we have been called into this this
[29:15] flesh we've come down in the flesh only
[29:17] we've come in the hybrid flesh and what
[29:19] kind of a priesthood should we be we
[29:21] should be able to be merciful and
[29:23] faithful because we've been tempted and
[29:24] we've been tested and we know what it's
[29:26] like we have understanding of what it's
[29:29] like to live in this world we have
[29:31] understanding of what it's like to be
[29:32] born hybrid we have understanding of
[29:34] what it's like to have a mind darkened
[29:36] we know what it's like so that we can
[29:37] help those when they're
[29:42] tempted God never put us here so that we
[29:44] could sit in an elevated position and
[29:47] call out the people why are you like
[29:48] this and why are you like that and why
[29:49] are you doing this and why are you doing
[29:51] that but God in his Mercy allowed us to
[29:54] come through hybridization through
[29:55] Fallen man incorruption with a mind
[29:58] alienated from the things of God having
[30:00] our conscience darkened and hating the
[30:02] things of God and having to be converted
[30:04] so that we would know what it's like to
[30:07] be in the world trapped in darkness with
[30:09] no
[30:10] understanding because we have to be a
[30:12] hyp we have to be a priest under our
[30:15] high priest Jesus
[30:17] Christ
[30:19] amen so we should have a degree of
[30:23] understanding now
[30:29] let's go to chapter
[30:31] 4 Hebrews chapter
[30:34] 4 we're going to keep looking at this
[30:36] priesthood of Jesus Christ because he's
[30:38] the high
[30:41] priest he's the Messiah we're
[30:44] Messiah
[30:48] amen he's the high priest we're
[30:52] priests chapter
[30:56] 4:14 says for we have not a high priest
[30:59] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[31:01] of our
[31:02] infirmities but was in all points
[31:04] tempted like as we are yet without
[31:08] sin he that means he can be touched with
[31:12] the feeling of our
[31:15] infirmities why
[31:18] because he was in all points tempted
[31:21] like as we are yet he never sinned he
[31:24] never fell but he felt the
[31:26] Temptation he was tested he was tried he
[31:29] come into a corrupt world and he know
[31:31] what it's like to deal with
[31:33] people he knows what it's like to get
[31:36] tired he know what it's like to be
[31:39] exhausted he knows what it's like to be
[31:42] hungry he knows what it's like to be a
[31:44] child he knows what it's like to be a
[31:45] teenager he he knows what it's like and
[31:49] he came that way so that he could be a
[31:51] merciful and faithful high
[31:53] priest and we've come this way and been
[31:56] redeemed by the blood of the Lamb and
[31:58] we've been awakened to who we really are
[31:59] but what kind of priesthood should we be
[32:02] having come this way we should be a
[32:04] priesthood with compassion and
[32:06] understanding and
[32:10] mercy Hebrews chapter 5
[32:17] now for every high priest taken from
[32:21] among men is ordained for men in the
[32:23] things pertaining to God that may he had
[32:25] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[32:27] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[32:30] and on them that are out of the way for
[32:32] that he himself also is compassed with
[32:35] infirmity why did God pick amen the sons
[32:38] of Aaron to be the high priest to be
[32:40] priest why because they're Afflicted
[32:42] with infirmities and they can have
[32:44] compassion amen this word compassion
[32:47] here where it says who can have
[32:48] compassion on the ignorant that means
[32:51] they can bear with them and deal with
[32:53] them amen with the those who are
[32:55] ignorant that they're able to bear with
[32:57] them and deal with them because uh on
[33:00] them that are out of the way for that he
[33:02] himself was also is compassed with
[33:05] infirmity so God now had drawn a man as
[33:09] a high priest Aaron and Aaron's sons as
[33:11] high priest and they can bear with the
[33:13] sins of the people they can deal with
[33:15] those who are out of the way because
[33:16] they are Encompass themselves with
[33:18] infirmities they understand they can
[33:20] intercede before God and say God I know
[33:22] what it's like he doesn't understand
[33:24] what he's doing would you forgive him
[33:26] Lord and now we've come to some way same
[33:29] way we've been encompassed with
[33:30] infirmities amen and it should put us we
[33:33] should have compassion for those who are
[33:34] out of the way amen we should be able to
[33:36] deal with those amen who don't
[33:39] understand and don't see and are doing
[33:40] wrong and making mistakes amen so that
[33:42] we can be merciful and faithful
[33:45] priests that's why we're here it's what
[33:49] I believe to reflect his priesthood in
[33:52] us he was a priest after the order of
[33:55] MDC
[33:58] MDC was not if we go on and read Hebrews
[34:01] he says he didn't come after the sons of
[34:03] Aaron he was he sprung up out of Judah
[34:05] where there's no priest he's not after
[34:07] the same order of priesthood of Aaron
[34:09] but but he's after the order of
[34:10] melkisedek what is melkisedek melkisedek
[34:13] was Priest of the most high God uh king
[34:15] of peace and and king of righteousness
[34:18] he was the theophany of God that come
[34:20] down and met Abraham after the slaughter
[34:22] of the Kings and he served in communion
[34:24] and Abraham paid him tithes of all amen
[34:27] and and that was was the order of
[34:28] melchisedec he was Priest of the most
[34:30] high but that priesthood moved into
[34:33] flesh that melchisedec that theophany of
[34:36] God was made into the Flesh of Jesus
[34:38] Christ he was Jesus Christ in a
[34:39] prefigure now he came down Amen to what
[34:42] to have the feeling of our infirmities
[34:45] to come flesh like we're flesh that that
[34:48] that now that malisic priesthood must
[34:50] come down and the malistic priesthood
[34:52] isn't after carnal ordinances but it's
[34:54] the priesthood that's after an eternal
[34:56] life an everlasting ing life amen
[34:58] because he had no beginning of days no
[35:00] ending of life no father no mother it
[35:03] was eternal life it was God's life amen
[35:05] that was moving down now it moved down
[35:07] into this priesthood it's a priesthood
[35:09] of life not conal ordinances but eternal
[35:12] life the life of God Amen and that high
[35:16] priest had to have blood for
[35:17] sanctification so he offered his own
[35:21] blood and that blood amen represented
[35:25] the life what life the very life that
[35:28] God had put into flesh amen that life
[35:30] now amen was given as a ransom for you
[35:33] and I so that the life that was in the
[35:34] blood can come back upon you and I and
[35:37] that's what brings us into Sons and
[35:38] Daughters of God and Kings and
[35:42] Priests so now what order of mzed do we
[35:45] have what is that order what do we have
[35:47] we have
[35:49] life it was an order of Life what did
[35:52] the blood represent all the time when
[35:54] the when the the ironic priesthood they
[35:56] were slaying lambs and slaying lambs and
[35:58] slaying lambs and they were carrying it
[36:00] behind amen the T into the Tabernacle
[36:03] and putting it on the Altar and and now
[36:05] taking it once a year into the holy of
[36:07] holies what were they doing they were
[36:08] showing that there's life there has to
[36:10] be life as a substitute for our fallen
[36:13] failed life amen the the whole thing was
[36:16] about life perpetually about life they
[36:18] had to offer a life for a
[36:21] life and the blood represented there was
[36:23] an innocent victim that was my
[36:25] substitute it was all about life but now
[36:28] Jesus Christ comes and sheds his blood
[36:31] to do what to purchase for us life and
[36:33] now his life comes into us and now we're
[36:36] a priesthood that's carrying
[36:40] blood amen because without the shedding
[36:42] of blood is no remission of sins and the
[36:44] priests are constantly offering blood
[36:46] where is our blood if we're a priesthood
[36:48] who's interceding and petitioning we
[36:50] have to intercede and petition with
[36:52] blood where is the blood that we
[36:54] intercede in petition with it's the very
[36:56] life that was in the Blood The Life of
[36:58] Christ the melchisedek life is in us in
[37:01] a portion making us a priesthood after
[37:03] the order of melchisedek after the order
[37:05] of our high priest so that when we
[37:07] petition we petition with a
[37:10] token with the life not just saying God
[37:13] would you forgive but God Amen I'm
[37:15] bringing to you your life amen I'm
[37:18] presenting back to you the blood that
[37:19] was shed the life that's in me I'm
[37:21] standing in the gap for this individual
[37:24] and I'm presenting to you your own life
[37:27] your own
[37:28] blood yes why can we do that because we
[37:31] were born in affirmity we were born in
[37:33] flesh we come after this order we
[37:36] understand or at least we should
[37:41] understand because we ruined the
[37:44] priesthood when we fail to
[37:46] forget that we were born in
[37:53] infirmity God still has inter ceders on
[37:56] the Earth
[37:58] yes God still has a way he's got a bride
[38:01] on this Earth who's part of a priesthood
[38:04] a royal
[38:06] priesthood she's got
[38:08] blood she's got a token she's got an
[38:11] offering she can approach into the holy
[38:14] of
[38:15] holies she can make
[38:17] intercession on behalf of
[38:20] others we shouldn't take this position
[38:22] lightly
[38:26] friends pray praise
[38:29] God let's go to First John I want to
[38:32] read a scripture that we went through a
[38:35] bit in
[38:37] detail on Sunday but I'd like to just
[38:41] review it if we
[38:44] could 1 John chapter
[38:47] 4 start at verse
[38:51] 7 beloved let us love one another for
[38:54] love is of
[38:55] God and everyone that loveth is born of
[38:58] God and knoweth God he that loveth not
[39:02] knoweth not God for God is
[39:06] love an amateure God should be like
[39:09] God and God is love so an amateur God
[39:15] should have
[39:18] love in this was manifested the love of
[39:21] God toward us because that God sent his
[39:23] only begotten son into the world that we
[39:25] might live through him hear in his love
[39:28] not that we loved God but that he loved
[39:30] us and sent his son to be the
[39:32] propitiation for our
[39:35] sins beloved if we if if God so loved us
[39:39] we ought also to love one another no man
[39:41] has seen God at any time if we love one
[39:44] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[39:46] is perfected in us and so God is
[39:51] love and and those that love are of
[39:55] God and so when he
[39:59] says
[40:01] uh verse 10 here in his love not that we
[40:04] love God but that he loved us and sent
[40:07] his son unto the world that he might
[40:10] live through him and God so loved the
[40:13] world that he
[40:14] gave his only begotten son it was love
[40:18] that caused God to extend mercy
[40:23] first to extend a propitiation first God
[40:27] led the way because love goes
[40:31] first and
[40:33] and this is love here in his love not
[40:36] that we loved
[40:38] God but that he loved
[40:43] us so now we're learning about love real
[40:46] love which is God and this is the kind
[40:50] of love that we have to emulate so the
[40:52] kind of love that we have to emulate is
[40:54] a love that goes first
[40:57] This is Love not that we love God but
[41:01] that God loved us you know what love is
[41:04] not that my neighbor loves me but that I
[41:06] love my
[41:07] neighbor that's God's
[41:12] love God's love sent a propitiation a
[41:16] price paid before we ever asked for it
[41:18] before we acknowledged we had a need
[41:20] before we could love him thank him or
[41:22] give him any credit he did it first he
[41:24] stood in the Gap first he made a
[41:25] provision first he shed his blood first
[41:28] he went first This is Love not that we
[41:30] love God that but he loved
[41:32] us this is the kind of love we're
[41:34] supposed to emulate yes in verse 16 he
[41:39] says and we we have known and believe
[41:42] that love that God ha to us God is love
[41:45] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[41:46] God and God in him verse 19 we love him
[41:52] because he first loved us and now hold
[41:55] on to that and don't lose it we here is
[41:58] love not that we love God but that God
[42:00] loved us and gave his
[42:02] son and and we love God because he first
[42:06] loved
[42:07] us now we think about that with our
[42:09] relationship to God but now we are the
[42:12] amateure Gods on Earth we are the
[42:14] priesthood on Earth how should we love
[42:17] the world how should we love everyone
[42:19] around us how should love be projecting
[42:21] from us in what Manner amen should it be
[42:23] projecting from us and how will anybody
[42:26] ever love us if we don't first love
[42:32] them because it says we love him because
[42:35] he first loved
[42:37] us
[42:40] so when love
[42:42] projects Sovereign Grace takes its
[42:46] place love true love has to go
[42:49] first the love of God goes first let's
[42:53] go to Matthew 22 we're going to read
[42:55] quite a few scriptures but they should
[42:56] be easy to get to close together instead
[42:59] of just keep your Bibles handy or your
[43:00] notebooks if you want to jot them down
[43:02] because we're going to go quickly
[43:04] through
[43:04] several Matthew
[43:11] 22:35 Matthew chapter
[43:15] 22 verse
[43:17] 35 then one of them which was a lawyer
[43:20] asked him a question tempting him and
[43:21] saying Master which is the great
[43:23] commandment in the law and Jesus said
[43:26] unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[43:27] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[43:30] with all thy mind this is the first and
[43:32] great commandment and the second is like
[43:35] unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[43:38] thyself on these two Commandments hang
[43:41] all the law and the prophets yes so he
[43:44] asked him what's the greatest
[43:45] commandment he says well I'll tell you
[43:46] the greatest commandment you shall love
[43:49] the Lord thy God with all your heart
[43:51] with all your soul and with all your
[43:52] mind that is the first and greatest
[43:55] commandment so if you want to know the
[43:56] greatest commandment that's the greatest
[43:57] commandment and the second is like to it
[44:01] it's similar it's the same Thou shalt
[44:03] love thy neighbor as thyself on these
[44:05] two Commandments hang all the law and
[44:08] the prophets if you can get this if you
[44:11] can Master this then you fulfilled the
[44:14] whole
[44:15] law Jesus mastered it and he fulfilled
[44:18] the whole
[44:19] law and Mark in The Book of Mark we
[44:22] won't turn there but in the Book of Mark
[44:23] it refers to the same statement somebody
[44:25] asking what the greatest commandment he
[44:27] says virtually the same thing but at the
[44:29] end he says Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[44:31] as thyself there is none other
[44:34] commandment greater than these there's
[44:37] nothing you can do greater than this
[44:39] there's nothing that you can accomplish
[44:40] there's nothing you can do there's no
[44:42] deed done there's no commandment greater
[44:44] than these the greatest is to love God
[44:47] with everything you have and love your
[44:48] neighbor as yourself that's
[44:51] it amen praise
[44:54] God so let's turn to Luke 10
[44:59] now Luke chap
[45:03] 10
[45:09] now somebody comes to Jesus and starts
[45:12] asking him a question about uh what do
[45:17] you have to do to inherit eternal life
[45:18] and he said keep the Commandments do
[45:20] these things he said I've done them all
[45:21] from the beginning but then verse 29 he
[45:24] says but he willing to just ify himself
[45:28] said unto Jesus and who is my
[45:31] neighbor so he had to keep these
[45:33] Commandments and love thy neighbors
[45:35] thyself and but he he wanted to justify
[45:38] himself so he said well can you define
[45:40] to me who my neighbor is yeah so this is
[45:43] Jesus's explanation of who his neighbor
[45:46] is verse 30 and Jesus answered and said
[45:49] a certain man went down from Jerusalem
[45:51] to Jericho and fell among Thieves which
[45:54] stripped him of his reignment and
[45:56] wounded him
[45:57] wounded him and departed leaving him
[46:00] half dead and by chance there came down
[46:03] a certain priest that way and when he
[46:05] saw him he passed by on the other side
[46:07] and likewise a levite when he was at the
[46:09] place came and looked on him and passed
[46:11] by on the other side but a certain
[46:14] Samaritan as he journeyed came where he
[46:16] was and when he saw him he had
[46:18] compassion on
[46:20] him and went to him and bound up his
[46:22] wounds pouring in oil and wine and set
[46:24] him on his own beast and brought him to
[46:27] the in and took care of him and on the
[46:29] tomorrow when he departed he took out
[46:31] two pence and gave them to the host and
[46:33] said unto him take care of him and
[46:35] whatsoever he
[46:56] neighbor he wanted a definition of who
[46:58] the neighbor was so he knew who he had
[47:00] to be nice to and who he didn't have to
[47:02] be nice to so that he could have eternal
[47:04] life by keeping a few Commandments and
[47:06] but but Jesus then broke it down and he
[47:09] he didn't tell him he didn't tell him
[47:11] who his neighbor was he told him who to
[47:13] be a neighbor
[47:15] too cuz he asked which three was a
[47:17] neighbor to the man that was wounded he
[47:19] said the one that took care of him the
[47:21] one that extended love amen the one that
[47:23] did what that loved the man when the man
[47:25] couldn't love back he was conscious he
[47:27] was beaten he had naked he had no money
[47:29] he had nothing he had nothing that he
[47:32] could offer in the relationship but the
[47:35] the but the man amen the Samaritan man
[47:38] he went first and he gave first and he
[47:41] loved first and he did everything with
[47:43] no expectation of anything in return
[47:46] that's the right kind of love that's
[47:48] God's love that's loving your neighbor
[47:50] as
[47:51] yourself amen remember on these two
[47:54] Commandments hang the whole law
[47:57] and so there's a statement in here that
[47:59] I'd like to look
[48:01] at he said in verse 33 let's go back and
[48:04] read verse 33 but a certain Samaritan as
[48:07] he journeyed came where he was and when
[48:09] he saw him he had compassion on him now
[48:13] this word compassion is used in the New
[48:15] Testament uh 12 times and it's
[48:17] translated to have compassion or to be
[48:20] moved with compassion and it means to be
[48:23] moved as to one's bowels hence to be
[48:26] moved with compassion having compassion
[48:29] and in the parth says for the bows were
[48:31] thought to be the seat of love and
[48:34] pity so when the man when he saw the man
[48:37] beaten and wounded and naked he he it he
[48:41] was moved with compassion it wasn't that
[48:44] he thought well Jesus said that I have
[48:47] to be nice to my it wasn't an
[48:49] intellectual
[48:52] thing he said it's the movement of bows
[48:55] meaning the Cent of emotions for the
[48:58] Jews where where love and pity comes
[49:00] from he was stirred on the inside and
[49:03] had compassion on this man and that
[49:06] compassion that love that was a very
[49:08] real love to him that was flowing out of
[49:11] him that love was extended to this man
[49:13] and that's what Jesus called being a
[49:16] neighbor it wasn't a duty it wasn't
[49:19] religion it wasn't it wasn't ticket to
[49:21] eternal life it was an outflow of
[49:24] something real that was in the man and
[49:26] so I want I want you to take note of
[49:27] what that what that uh uh compassion is
[49:30] compassion wasn't a thought compassion
[49:33] wasn't compassion was a move he was
[49:35] moved with Compassion or he felt it deep
[49:40] inside
[49:42] amen so now let's go to Acts chapter
[49:54] 10 Acts chapter 10
[49:58] verse
[50:02] 37 he
[50:08] says says that word I say you know which
[50:12] was published throughout all Judea and
[50:14] began From Galilee after the baptism
[50:16] which John preached how God anointed
[50:18] Jesus at Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
[50:20] and with power who went about doing good
[50:22] and healing all that were oppressed of
[50:24] the devil for God was with him
[50:27] what did Jesus do what did Jesus do in
[50:29] his lifetime he went about doing good
[50:33] and Healing The
[50:34] Sick who are we supposed to emulate
[50:37] Jesus he went about doing good and
[50:39] Healing The Sick and John first John
[50:42] says that he that saith he abideth in
[50:45] him ought also to walk even as he walked
[50:49] we should walk just like Christ walked
[50:52] let's go to Galatians
[50:54] now over to Galatians 6
[51:05] Galatians 6
[51:07] and9 the Apostle Paul now speaking to
[51:10] the church in Galatians he says in
[51:12] Galatians 69 and let us not be weary in
[51:14] well-doing for in due season we shall
[51:16] reap if we faint not as we have
[51:19] therefore opportunity let us do good
[51:20] unto all men especially unto them who
[51:23] are of the household of faith so
[51:27] God has called us to go about doing good
[51:31] and Healing The Sick why because love
[51:34] must be
[51:35] projected in order for Sovereign Grace
[51:37] to take its place love has to be
[51:39] projected when Sovereign Grace took its
[51:41] place in us love was
[51:43] projected God went first he loved for we
[51:45] love him because he first loved us here
[51:47] in his love not that we loved God but
[51:48] that God loved us and gave his son sent
[51:51] his son So This is Love we must we must
[51:54] love first let's go to Matthew now back
[51:57] to Matthew Chapter
[52:03] 5 Matthew chapter
[52:08] 5 verse
[52:13] 43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it
[52:17] hath been said Thou shalt love thy
[52:19] neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say
[52:22] unto you love your enemies bless them
[52:25] that curse you do good to them that hate
[52:27] you and pray for them which despitefully
[52:29] use you and persecute you that ye may be
[52:32] children of your father which is in
[52:35] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[52:38] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[52:40] reain on the just and on the unjust for
[52:44] if you love them which love you what
[52:46] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[52:49] the same and if you salute your brethren
[52:51] only what do you more than others do not
[52:54] even the publicans so
[52:56] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[52:59] father which is in heaven is
[53:01] perfect what are we supposed to
[53:05] do bless them that curse
[53:08] you you're supposed to love our enemies
[53:11] has it been said love your neighbor but
[53:13] but I say love your
[53:15] enemies bless them that curse you do
[53:17] good to them that hate you pray for them
[53:19] that spitefully use you and persecute
[53:21] you that you may be children of your
[53:23] father isn't that the goal yes to be
[53:26] like
[53:28] God isn't that what an amateur God
[53:30] should be like he should be like God
[53:32] well God sendeth the rain on the just
[53:34] and the unjust the ones that curse him
[53:36] and the ones that love him they both get
[53:39] blessed amen and so what what what what
[53:43] kind of life should we live one that
[53:44] emulates him and there's a reason I'm
[53:46] going into this so just read these
[53:48] scriptures and understand that this is
[53:50] the example that's been given to us this
[53:52] is the Commandment of the Lord this is
[53:53] what we've been taught in the way we
[53:55] should act love should be projected but
[53:57] there's a reason a very important reason
[53:58] why I'm laying this out when we go to to
[54:01] Luke 7 we're going to look again at
[54:11] Jesus Luke chapter
[54:19] 7 Luke 7 and:
[54:22] 11 and it came to pass the day after
[54:25] that he went to a city called Na and
[54:28] many of his disciples went with him and
[54:29] much people now when he came nigh
[54:32] through the gate of the city behold
[54:33] there was a dead man carried out the
[54:36] only son of his mother and she was a
[54:38] widow and much people the city was with
[54:40] her and when the Lord saw her he had
[54:43] compassion on her and said unto her weep
[54:45] not and he came and touched the buyer
[54:47] and they that bear him Stood Still and
[54:49] he said young man I say unto thee arise
[54:52] and he that was dead sat up and began to
[54:54] speak and he delivered him to his mother
[54:57] and there came a fear on all and they
[54:59] glorified God saying that a great
[55:00] prophet has risen up among us and that
[55:02] God hath visited his people here comes
[55:05] Jesus into a city and as he's coming
[55:07] into a city he sees he sees a funeral
[55:11] buyer going by there's a man laid out
[55:13] there and and very quickly he discerns
[55:15] the situation and we have it here it
[55:18] says that he was uh the only son of his
[55:23] mother and she was a
[55:25] widow now Jesus lived Jesus lived 33
[55:29] years upon this Earth I I would have a
[55:32] hard time believing this is the only
[55:33] buyer he ever saw it was the only time
[55:36] somebody was carried through a city or
[55:38] out of a city and off to a burial but
[55:40] but and this one something particular
[55:43] struck him because now he sees a widow
[55:45] following behind and this is her only
[55:47] son and she's a widow that means she has
[55:50] no means of support whatsoever she's
[55:52] absolutely destitute her husband has
[55:55] died and now her only son which is her
[55:57] Redeemer her future everything to her
[55:59] the one that will take care of her now
[56:01] he's dead she's left with nothing and it
[56:03] said Jesus I want to I want to read it
[56:05] exactly the way he said it and verse 13
[56:09] and when the Lord saw her he had
[56:11] compassion on her this is the same exact
[56:14] scripture that we looked at before with
[56:16] the definition that said to be moved as
[56:19] to one's bows hence to be moved with
[56:21] compassion to have compassion so Jesus
[56:24] when he saw this scene he you know this
[56:27] this Jesus was God in flesh amen he was
[56:30] here upon the Earth and he's walking on
[56:32] this Earth and he's not walking sterile
[56:34] he's not walking amen separated from
[56:36] everything around him like a robot only
[56:38] doing God said this go do that no he was
[56:40] moved with compassion amen something
[56:43] inside of him moved in his bows and and
[56:45] and and he saw this situation and he
[56:48] felt for the Widow and when he felt for
[56:50] the Widow he moved out with compassion
[56:52] and touched the buyer and he stopped and
[56:54] he said young man arise what was it
[56:57] there was something he he took on flesh
[56:59] God came down in flesh and in flesh he
[57:01] had movement inside of him a compassion
[57:04] for another human being amen another one
[57:07] that had no way to make a means of
[57:09] living for herself she was a widow with
[57:11] no husband her only son was now dead and
[57:13] it moved him and when it moved him he
[57:15] went into action because there was
[57:17] something in him that could change the
[57:23] situation that's the Son of God that's
[57:26] God in flesh that's not an amateur God
[57:28] that's God and his
[57:30] son what should the amateur Gods be like
[57:32] there should be things that move us
[57:34] remember brother brandham he was moved
[57:36] for the sick people he had a feeling for
[57:39] them and remember when he got upset in
[57:41] the whole sermon and standing in the Gap
[57:43] and he says I got upset with the people
[57:45] because they didn't hear my message and
[57:46] and he went he wanted to go you know run
[57:48] away and God stopped him and and then
[57:50] there was a brother who had a a vision
[57:52] or a dream and saw him coming down like
[57:54] Moses sitting at the table and he went
[57:56] and he come back and he was changed and
[57:58] he said now brother brother br's
[58:00] interpretation see Moses on the back
[58:02] side of the desert he had run away
[58:04] because his people rejected him and he
[58:06] lost the feeling for the
[58:08] people that's what he said he lost the
[58:10] feeling for the people and and he's on
[58:12] the back side of the Desert god comes to
[58:14] him and says now go deliver your people
[58:16] and he had so been rejected and hurt and
[58:18] wounded and ran away on the backs side
[58:20] of the desert his his bows of compassion
[58:22] no longer moved for his people who were
[58:24] in bondage and he said I can't go I
[58:26] stutter I won't go they won't accept me
[58:28] and all these excuses amen and and
[58:31] brother said he had long forgot the
[58:33] feeling for his
[58:34] people and brother R said that's what
[58:36] happened to
[58:39] me and then God corrected him and and he
[58:42] took his correction and he preaches
[58:43] standing in the Gap but remember at the
[58:45] end of the standing in the Gap he said I
[58:47] can't go out feeling this
[58:49] way he said I've lost the feeling and
[58:52] tell he goes I still feel like they
[58:54] ought to have heard it and he called him
[58:56] Ricky and ricettas and he says until I
[58:58] can have the feeling for the people
[58:59] there's no point in me
[59:02] going listen this was a man that was
[59:04] commissioned by an Angel and had a gift
[59:06] of healing to take to the peoples of the
[59:07] world but if he couldn't feel for the
[59:09] infirmities of the people there was no
[59:11] point in him
[59:12] going it doesn't mean he didn't have a
[59:14] gift it doesn't mean that the Angel's
[59:16] commission wasn't still right but it
[59:18] took somebody to stand in the place of a
[59:21] priesthood that would have feeling for
[59:23] the infirmities of the people because he
[59:24] knows his own infirmity
[59:27] somebody had to stand in the Gap
[59:29] somebody had to pray the prayer of faith
[59:31] somebody had to have feeling for the
[59:34] people say God help us not to lose
[59:37] feeling for
[59:39] people it's part of being a priest it's
[59:43] part of the
[59:45] priesthood Matthew
[59:53] 14:14 Matthew 14 and verse vers
[1:00:03] 14 it says and Jesus went forth and saw
[1:00:07] a great multitude and was moved with
[1:00:09] compassion toward them and he healed
[1:00:12] their
[1:00:13] sick when Jesus saw the multitude was
[1:00:15] hungry he was moved with compassion and
[1:00:18] that's what caused him to break the
[1:00:19] bread and the fishes when he saw their
[1:00:21] sick he was moved with compassion and
[1:00:23] healed their sick when he saw the Widow
[1:00:25] with the dead son he was moved with
[1:00:27] compassion see in order to be a priest
[1:00:30] we have to be a priest that can be
[1:00:32] touched with the feeling of
[1:00:35] infirmities we were
[1:00:38] born in sin We've Come Through This
[1:00:41] World we've had a lot of Hard Knocks and
[1:00:44] many of us have different
[1:00:45] stories different things we've been
[1:00:48] through but why did we come in flesh and
[1:00:52] why did we come the way we
[1:00:54] came May maybe so we could have a
[1:00:57] feeling for the
[1:00:58] infirmities of
[1:01:00] people there's certain things that'll
[1:01:03] move you to compassion because you've
[1:01:04] been through it there's certain things
[1:01:07] that that that when you hear you you
[1:01:10] intercede you go to prayer you
[1:01:12] understand you have a feeling you can't
[1:01:13] get it off your mind you want to pray
[1:01:15] for that person because you know the
[1:01:17] feeling amen because your compassion
[1:01:19] your bows are moved and you go into
[1:01:21] action and start moving and what do you
[1:01:23] do you move into a priesthood of
[1:01:25] intercession and say say God would you
[1:01:26] heal would you deliver would you comfort
[1:01:28] I know what it feels like Lord I moved
[1:01:31] with compassion and now I'm presenting
[1:01:33] to you the the life of melkisedek your
[1:01:36] life back would you please God would you
[1:01:38] move on this situation what is that
[1:01:40] that's a royal priesthood on Earth
[1:01:42] today that's what we've been called
[1:01:45] to brother B said in the message why he
[1:01:48] said we've got to love one another
[1:01:51] though we different you got to love
[1:01:52] anyhow you can't Bluff it you got to
[1:01:55] really do it you got to and that's the
[1:01:57] greatest power they found in healing is
[1:02:00] love when you have sympathy and love for
[1:02:03] people trying to help them that's what
[1:02:06] brother BR said was one of the secrets
[1:02:07] he says by love he cast out demons by
[1:02:09] loves he heals the Sick by love that was
[1:02:11] one of his secret weapons was he loved
[1:02:15] people brother R says in 1959 from the
[1:02:19] beginning it wasn't so in this message
[1:02:20] he said you know you have to enter into
[1:02:23] suffering of a person to have feeling
[1:02:25] for
[1:02:26] them if it ever gets to a place that I
[1:02:29] can't feel sorry for the sick then it's
[1:02:31] time for me to leave the platform
[1:02:33] praying for them it's when I get to a
[1:02:35] place that I can't feel the burden of
[1:02:37] sin on people then it's time for me to
[1:02:39] get away from here because I could never
[1:02:41] do no good for God it's the feeling you
[1:02:45] have for people you know it's a love
[1:02:47] that you can project to the people that
[1:02:49] they know you love them and they love
[1:02:52] you and you can feel it and there's
[1:02:54] something that happens
[1:02:56] then oh don't don't don't miss this I'm
[1:02:59] going to read this last sentence you
[1:03:01] know it's a love that you can project to
[1:03:04] the people that they know you love them
[1:03:07] and they love
[1:03:09] you and you can feel it and there's
[1:03:12] something that happens
[1:03:14] then when love projects Sovereign Grace
[1:03:17] can take its
[1:03:19] place brother B said one time love is
[1:03:22] the most powerful force on Earth
[1:03:26] where should love be in the end time
[1:03:28] brother Brenham said in the end time
[1:03:29] it'll only be in one place it'll be in
[1:03:31] the
[1:03:33] bride there should be love to project
[1:03:36] there should be C compassion for our
[1:03:37] fellow man for our
[1:03:41] neighbors
[1:03:44] amen the guy who frustrates the
[1:03:46] Daylights out of you at
[1:03:49] work he needs an
[1:03:53] interceder when Jesus was nailed to the
[1:03:56] Cross there was an intercession taking
[1:03:58] place from a priesthood because as they
[1:04:01] walked by and wagged their hands and
[1:04:02] said he healed others couldn't he he
[1:04:04] delivered others couldn't he deliver
[1:04:05] himself he said he could do this and he
[1:04:07] said he could do that why doesn't he
[1:04:08] come down off the cross and nailed to
[1:04:10] the cross with them mocking them he said
[1:04:12] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:04:14] they're doing what is that that's
[1:04:17] intercession that's a priesthood calling
[1:04:19] out to the father father God would you
[1:04:22] please would you please forgive them
[1:04:24] they're not even asking forgiveness the
[1:04:26] priest is asking forgiveness that's
[1:04:28] intercession that's intercession and
[1:04:30] petition he's interceding and
[1:04:32] petitioning God on their behalf they's
[1:04:34] too ignorant to what they're doing to
[1:04:36] even know that they're doing wrong but
[1:04:38] there's one who's got understanding love
[1:04:40] and compassion and he's nailed to the
[1:04:42] cross dying for their sin and saying oh
[1:04:44] Father for my sake would you forgive
[1:04:47] them they don't know what they're
[1:04:50] doing what about like I said the guy at
[1:04:52] work that drives you nuts amen can you
[1:04:54] ever say God would you forgive him he
[1:04:56] doesn't understand what he's doing look
[1:04:58] at how he was raised look at his
[1:05:00] understanding look at the pain he's been
[1:05:01] through look at his home God please
[1:05:03] forgive him and let him go and open his
[1:05:05] eyes and heal him and bless him and help
[1:05:07] him
[1:05:08] God that's intercession what's a
[1:05:11] priesthood for a priesthood is here to
[1:05:13] intercede and petition on behalf of
[1:05:16] others why can we petition on the behalf
[1:05:18] of others because of my own infirmity
[1:05:20] and my own Affliction and my own
[1:05:21] Temptations amen I I know what it's like
[1:05:25] yes to be in that
[1:05:29] position brother B says in the paman
[1:05:31] church age when he preached it in 1960
[1:05:33] he says let me walk like he walked let
[1:05:36] me speak like he speaks let my motives
[1:05:38] be like his motives let others find
[1:05:42] Jesus in me let me lose myself and find
[1:05:45] it Lord in thee that's it let me just
[1:05:47] lose myself and find it in thee just so
[1:05:51] enshrouded in Christ till there's no
[1:05:53] room for No Doubt just what he
[1:05:56] says now don't go out here and say glory
[1:05:59] to God hallelujah praise God you see
[1:06:01] what I can do glory to God you haven't
[1:06:03] got it yet that's not the way he did it
[1:06:06] no stick his chest out and say see what
[1:06:08] I can do yes sir I'm so no he never
[1:06:12] taken praise for nothing he gave it to
[1:06:15] God and walked humbly and sweetly with
[1:06:17] such an air around him till people just
[1:06:19] love to be around
[1:06:23] him once
[1:06:25] loved them enough till even he prayed
[1:06:28] for them constantly all the time and
[1:06:30] that was your example my example to do
[1:06:32] to others as he did to us so now I'm I'm
[1:06:37] getting down to the part that I really
[1:06:39] want to get to so we'll finish up with
[1:06:42] this but he had such an air around him
[1:06:45] till people just loved to be around
[1:06:48] him brother B said I can't help people
[1:06:51] unless I can love them and I love them
[1:06:53] and then they love me and then you can
[1:06:55] feel
[1:06:56] it listen that's where things can really
[1:06:59] begin to happen that's where
[1:07:01] intercession can really begin to take
[1:07:03] place and I want to I want to look at it
[1:07:05] in Matthew 25 so let's go to Matthew
[1:07:10] 25 and I pray that the Lord will help
[1:07:14] me to take what's in my heart and be
[1:07:17] able to share
[1:07:20] it remember when we talked on Sunday
[1:07:22] about creating an atmosphere to
[1:07:24] atmosphere around Jesus Christ CHR was
[1:07:25] love and he says wouldn't it have been
[1:07:27] amazing to be around him to feel his
[1:07:29] atmosphere and he go that it must have
[1:07:31] been one great big bundle of love and
[1:07:33] respects and godly
[1:07:35] fear there was something about him that
[1:07:38] people loved that the children Lov there
[1:07:39] was something about brother Brenham that
[1:07:40] people loved to be around people in his
[1:07:43] community and his neighbor and old
[1:07:45] buddies
[1:07:48] and and there was love that was
[1:07:50] projecting love was projecting here and
[1:07:53] love was projecting there and and
[1:07:56] if I could brother
[1:07:58] Brenham he didn't make every one of his
[1:08:01] friends believe like he believed to love
[1:08:05] them there was many that never come to
[1:08:08] the full revelation of the message they
[1:08:10] believed him they loved him they
[1:08:12] believed what he said was true and they
[1:08:14] believed the Miracles he did was right
[1:08:15] but they stayed in their Methodist
[1:08:17] Church and in their Catholic Church they
[1:08:18] stayed where they were they didn't leave
[1:08:20] where they were and come to his church
[1:08:22] but they believed him and they loved him
[1:08:23] and they believed he was even a prophet
[1:08:25] they believed the things that he said
[1:08:26] were true but they never understood the
[1:08:28] message to where they would come out of
[1:08:30] her my people they never heard that call
[1:08:32] but they loved the
[1:08:36] man I'll ask you a question
[1:08:39] now brother bram's friends in town Dr
[1:08:45] Adair and and and Jimmy p po and and I
[1:08:50] don't even know I mean the the mayor who
[1:08:52] was his buddy and all of these other
[1:08:54] ones who was friends and ones that
[1:08:55] hunted with him and they never come to
[1:08:57] the revelation of the message and they
[1:08:59] they never understood uh who he really
[1:09:01] was and they but they just loved him and
[1:09:03] respected him the question is did he
[1:09:07] fail in his
[1:09:09] friendship because he didn't get them to
[1:09:11] see the light of the
[1:09:13] hour did Brother Brenham fail I don't
[1:09:16] think he failed one drop neither do I
[1:09:19] think we fail when we love people and we
[1:09:21] project love and they love us even
[1:09:23] though we may try to drop seeds we may
[1:09:25] try to give them the message but there's
[1:09:26] something in them they love us anyhow
[1:09:28] they just don't understand what we're
[1:09:29] talking about they just can't grasp it
[1:09:31] I've had family members that loved me
[1:09:33] dearly and then they just couldn't grasp
[1:09:35] what I was saying they never spoke evil
[1:09:36] they never condemned me in fact they
[1:09:38] respected me all the time and they loved
[1:09:40] me dearly but there was just nothing
[1:09:42] inside that could go ding I get
[1:09:44] it because you have to have a seed to
[1:09:47] believe with and the question is am I
[1:09:49] failing my family am I failing my
[1:09:51] friends because I can't make them see
[1:09:53] the message and I can't get them to
[1:09:54] repeat it and I can't them that come
[1:09:55] here to church I'm not failing them
[1:09:58] because if they're seed they'll
[1:10:01] come any more than brother Brandon
[1:10:03] failed his own family and failed his
[1:10:05] friends and failed all all his buddies
[1:10:07] in
[1:10:08] Jeffersonville but you know what I
[1:10:10] believe he did for them I believe there
[1:10:12] was a priesthood on Earth an
[1:10:13] intercession and I believe he opened a
[1:10:15] door for them and made a way for them to
[1:10:18] come
[1:10:20] anyhow that's just me and I'll show you
[1:10:24] why I believe that Matthew
[1:10:29] 25:31 when the son of man shall come in
[1:10:32] his glory and all the Holy Angels with
[1:10:34] him then shall he sit upon the throne of
[1:10:36] his glory and before him shall he gather
[1:10:38] all nations and he shall separate them
[1:10:40] one from another as a Shepherd divideth
[1:10:43] his sheep from the goats and he shall
[1:10:45] set the Sheep on the right hand and the
[1:10:48] goats on the left then shall the king
[1:10:50] say unto them on his right hand Come Ye
[1:10:52] blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom
[1:10:55] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:10:56] the world for I was a hungered and he
[1:10:59] gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave
[1:11:01] me drink I was a stranger and he took me
[1:11:03] in naked and you clothed me I was sick
[1:11:06] and you visited me I was in prison and
[1:11:08] you came unto me then shall the
[1:11:10] righteous answer him saying Lord when
[1:11:13] saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and
[1:11:15] thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we
[1:11:17] thee a stranger and took thee in or
[1:11:19] naked and clothed thee or when saw we
[1:11:22] thee sick or in prison and came unto
[1:11:24] thee and the King shall answer and say
[1:11:26] unto them verily verily I say or verily
[1:11:28] I say unto you in so much as you have
[1:11:30] done it unto one of the least of these
[1:11:32] my brethren you have done it unto
[1:11:37] me here we
[1:11:39] have people that brother R tells us
[1:11:42] clearly this is the white Throne
[1:11:43] judgment after the thousand years is
[1:11:45] ended the general resurrection of the
[1:11:46] dead has come we're standing at the
[1:11:48] white Throne judgment and his bride is
[1:11:50] Seated on his throne with him the bride
[1:11:52] doesn't come into judgment she's passed
[1:11:54] from condemnation he's passed under from
[1:11:56] Death un life and now we come and seated
[1:11:59] on his throne with him and he's judging
[1:12:00] Amen in the white Throne judgment and
[1:12:02] he's separating as sheep from goats not
[1:12:05] sheep and goats cu the Sheep are in the
[1:12:06] fold they've already been resurrected
[1:12:08] and raptured but as a Shepherd separates
[1:12:11] these two categories and he's separating
[1:12:13] them and one is going to enter into
[1:12:15] eternal life one is going to go into
[1:12:17] damnation and what is the dividing line
[1:12:20] what is he basing this judgment on this
[1:12:22] judgment is based on how they treat
[1:12:25] his
[1:12:27] Brethren who are his Brethren amen you
[1:12:29] find that you've got three categories of
[1:12:31] people here you have those on the right
[1:12:33] hand those on the left hand and his
[1:12:36] Brethren those on the right hand are the
[1:12:38] ones that are like the Sheep they're the
[1:12:40] ones that are going to go into uh uh the
[1:12:42] righteous that are going to go into
[1:12:43] eternal life the ones on his left are
[1:12:45] are typed with the goats they're going
[1:12:47] to go into a damnation Everlasting
[1:12:48] damnation amen so where are his Brethren
[1:12:51] his Brethren are sitting on the throne
[1:12:52] with him you've got three groups of
[1:12:54] people in this judgment
[1:12:57] so when you've done it to the least of
[1:12:58] these my
[1:13:00] brethren you've done it unto
[1:13:04] me what did they
[1:13:08] do what did they
[1:13:10] do to receive entrance into eternal
[1:13:15] life they loved
[1:13:19] back
[1:13:22] Christ didn't have a revelation of to
[1:13:25] the message or they wouldn't be at the
[1:13:26] white thr
[1:13:27] judgment didn't have a c Gene of God to
[1:13:29] believe
[1:13:31] with but in some way they had
[1:13:34] contact with the elect of God they came
[1:13:38] in contact with the elect of God they
[1:13:40] had some sort of contact or relationship
[1:13:44] at some
[1:13:46] way and they come into eternal life why
[1:13:48] is it they enter into eternal life at
[1:13:50] the white Throne
[1:13:51] judgment this is Brother Chad because
[1:13:55] loved
[1:13:57] back and we love him because he first
[1:14:01] loved
[1:14:03] us why is it we want to project love
[1:14:06] because in projecting love I create an
[1:14:08] opportunity to love
[1:14:09] back and loving first and loving the way
[1:14:12] God loved and loving and giving and
[1:14:15] loving and sacrificing and and loving
[1:14:17] amen This is Love not that we love God
[1:14:19] but that he loved me that's love love is
[1:14:21] not that my neighbor loves me but that I
[1:14:22] love my neighbor that's love and if I
[1:14:25] can project love Sovereign Grace can
[1:14:27] take its place Mercy can come on the
[1:14:29] scene if I can project love I give an
[1:14:31] opportunity for somebody to love back
[1:14:33] and if somebody can love back they may
[1:14:35] not have a c Gene of God they may have
[1:14:37] nothing to believe the word with they
[1:14:39] may have no ability to receive
[1:14:41] Revelation because you've got to have
[1:14:42] the crystal on the inside to pick up the
[1:14:44] waves amen if you don't have the crystal
[1:14:46] on the inside it's just fuzz you can't
[1:14:48] pick it up and you can't blame them for
[1:14:50] that amen but why can they get into
[1:14:52] eternal life how can they enter in
[1:14:54] because they came in contact with Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ in flesh in you and they loved
[1:15:01] back this is why you don't hate your
[1:15:04] neighbor this is why you're not contener
[1:15:05] to the guy on the other side of the
[1:15:07] fence this is why the guy who irritates
[1:15:09] you at work you don't write him off and
[1:15:11] you don't send him down the road amen
[1:15:13] because if you do you cut him off from
[1:15:15] an opportunity for eternal life but what
[1:15:17] we have to do is Project love the way
[1:15:19] God projected love remember brother Bram
[1:15:22] said God doesn't send anybody to hell
[1:15:25] man sends himself to hell he fights his
[1:15:27] way the love of God has given an
[1:15:29] opportunity and man has refused the
[1:15:31] opportunity amen I want to be that
[1:15:35] opportunity and I want somebody to
[1:15:37] refuse the opportunity I don't want to
[1:15:39] refuse to give it by being hateful and
[1:15:41] contener and and self-willed and and and
[1:15:43] totally reserved to myself and pulled
[1:15:45] back from all
[1:15:48] Humanity but I'm a
[1:15:52] priest I'm a priest with
[1:15:56] life the blood remember the blood
[1:15:58] represents the life I'm a priest with
[1:16:00] life what life the life of the high
[1:16:03] priest is in me the the life that's went
[1:16:05] behind the veil the life that's
[1:16:07] purchased everything back that life is
[1:16:09] in my hand that life is in me and I can
[1:16:12] intercede oh God forgive forgive them
[1:16:15] for that they didn't mean
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:20] iten sometimes we don't realize what we
[1:16:24] are
[1:16:26] I mean like we talk about it but then
[1:16:28] when our neighbor parks on our side and
[1:16:30] he got tire marks in our grass
[1:16:33] and yes sir yes I mean we we want a
[1:16:37] gospel that works on Monday amen when
[1:16:40] The Neighbor on a rainy day missed his
[1:16:42] driveway got in your lard and left a big
[1:16:44] rut and pulled out never even apologized
[1:16:46] for her never even had the audacity say
[1:16:48] I'm sorry I was in your yard amen what
[1:16:50] do you want to do you want to say God
[1:16:52] you know that neighbor would
[1:16:55] or say God forgive my poor neighbor he
[1:16:57] doesn't even know what he done he
[1:16:58] doesn't know how hard he made it for
[1:17:01] me oh and and you know you don't want to
[1:17:05] go give him a piece of your mind when he
[1:17:06] pulls back
[1:17:08] in because if you give him a piece of
[1:17:10] your mind and what if he turns around
[1:17:12] and gives you a piece of his mind and
[1:17:13] what is his opportunity for
[1:17:16] life if he's not a seed of God if he
[1:17:19] doesn't have the crystal on the inside
[1:17:21] how what's his Open Door how Hey listen
[1:17:25] sometimes we got to be reminded of what
[1:17:27] we are who we are where the royal
[1:17:29] priesthood where the intercession and
[1:17:31] and and and where where this is on this
[1:17:33] Earth it's right here and you and I amen
[1:17:35] let's not be blind to what God's put us
[1:17:38] in in this day we're here in flesh so
[1:17:40] why why why has has anybody here messed
[1:17:46] up
[1:17:49] unanimous why did you mess up why do you
[1:17:52] keep messing up why is it so hard why is
[1:17:55] it a struggle why does things slip out
[1:17:57] of your mouth and you wish you didn't
[1:17:58] say it why do mean why do you say mean
[1:18:00] things and why do you why do you do
[1:18:02] wrong things all the time maybe so that
[1:18:04] you can be touched with the feeling of
[1:18:06] the infirmities of everyone around us
[1:18:11] amen so that we can have
[1:18:14] compassion that means the compassion to
[1:18:16] bear with the sins of all of those who
[1:18:19] sin against
[1:18:20] us somebody somebody went around behind
[1:18:23] my back and said something to to my boss
[1:18:25] about me and made me look
[1:18:27] bad we'll get them you know what the
[1:18:30] reality is I've done that before
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:34] amen I said something to somebody I
[1:18:36] shouldn't have said
[1:18:38] yes so I can have the
[1:18:41] feeling of the
[1:18:44] infirmity if I want to be forgiven why
[1:18:47] don't I want others to be
[1:18:52] forgiven in Matthew chap 10
[1:18:58] remember we're talking about unveiling
[1:18:59] the amateur
[1:19:02] Gods Matthew chapter
[1:19:04] 10 verse
[1:19:13] 40 he that hath received you receiveth
[1:19:16] me and he that receiveth me receiveth
[1:19:19] him that sent me he that receiveth a
[1:19:22] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:19:23] receive a prophet's reward and he that
[1:19:25] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[1:19:27] a righteous man shall receive a
[1:19:29] righteous man's reward and whosoever
[1:19:31] shall give to drink unto one of these
[1:19:33] little ones a cup of cold water only in
[1:19:36] the name of a disciple verily I say unto
[1:19:38] you he shall in no wise lose his
[1:19:43] reward that means if he only gives just
[1:19:46] a disciple just somebody who believes in
[1:19:49] Jesus Christ gives him a cup of cold
[1:19:51] water only in the name of a disciple
[1:19:53] just because he's a disciple
[1:19:55] he's not going to lose his
[1:19:58] reward amen if somebody can receive a
[1:20:01] prophet in the name of prophet he can
[1:20:02] get a prophet's reward but if all they
[1:20:04] can receive is a
[1:20:06] disciple and do that deed for a disciple
[1:20:10] he'll not lose his reward here's what
[1:20:13] brother B says uh I'm sorry I want to go
[1:20:16] to
[1:20:19] Mark no no I don't
[1:20:22] sorry that's the same it says the same
[1:20:25] thing in Mark 9:41 but it words it this
[1:20:27] way for whosoever shall give you a cup
[1:20:29] of water to drink in my name because you
[1:20:32] belong to Christ verily I say unto you
[1:20:35] he shall not lose his reward now let's
[1:20:38] go to Revelation chap
[1:20:50] 20 Revelation 20 and: 11
[1:21:02] Revelation 20 and 11 and I saw a great
[1:21:05] white throne in him that sat on it from
[1:21:07] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[1:21:09] away and there was found no place for
[1:21:12] them and I saw the dead small and great
[1:21:14] stand before God and the books were open
[1:21:16] and another book was open which is The
[1:21:19] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[1:21:21] out of those things which were written
[1:21:22] in the books according to their works
[1:21:25] this is the white Throne judgment same
[1:21:27] thing we saw in Matthew
[1:21:29] 25 and the Sea gave up the dead which
[1:21:31] were in it and the death and Hell
[1:21:32] delivered up the dead which were in them
[1:21:34] and they were judged every man according
[1:21:37] to their works and death and hell were
[1:21:40] cast into the Lake of Fire this is the
[1:21:42] second death and whosoever was not found
[1:21:45] written in the Book of Life was cast
[1:21:47] into the Lake of Fire it's amazing that
[1:21:50] when this judgment comes the books are
[1:21:53] opened and the book
[1:21:55] so the book of life either has your name
[1:21:57] in it or not in it but the books that
[1:21:58] were open amen he says and they're
[1:22:01] judged according to their
[1:22:03] works it's hard to believe but this is a
[1:22:06] works-based
[1:22:07] judgment at the white Throne judgment
[1:22:10] they're judged according to the works
[1:22:11] what works well what did Matthew 25 tell
[1:22:14] us the works were when I was naked you
[1:22:17] clothed me when I was hungry you fed me
[1:22:19] when I was in prison you visited
[1:22:21] me you know
[1:22:25] um let me read this sorry I'm going to
[1:22:27] read from the sardan church age out of
[1:22:29] the church age
[1:22:30] book the question now arises why are
[1:22:33] these righteous ones in the Judgment
[1:22:35] there is no other place that they can
[1:22:37] come up for there are but two
[1:22:38] resurrections and since they could not
[1:22:40] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:22:43] must come up in the second which is a
[1:22:45] resurrection unto judgment the ones who
[1:22:48] qualify for the first resurrection the
[1:22:49] bride are not in the Judgment John 5:24
[1:22:53] says verily verily I say un to he that
[1:22:55] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:22:56] that sent me hath everlasting life that
[1:22:59] is the believer is already the recipient
[1:23:01] of eternal life which he has in his
[1:23:03] possession now and shall not come into
[1:23:06] the condemnation shall not come into
[1:23:08] judgment is what it really says but is
[1:23:11] passed permanently from death into life
[1:23:13] but notice carefully Jesus must have yet
[1:23:15] another group in mind who at a certain
[1:23:17] Resurrection will receive eternal life
[1:23:19] they will receive it at the resurrection
[1:23:21] not having previously received it as a
[1:23:23] member of the bride that's this group
[1:23:25] we're talking about further down he says
[1:23:28] now we do not need to guess about those
[1:23:30] who in the second Rec Resurrection are
[1:23:31] given life we are told it is given to
[1:23:34] them on the grounds that they have been
[1:23:36] kind and good to the Brethren those who
[1:23:39] are raised and cast into the Lake of
[1:23:40] Fire will be so treated because of their
[1:23:42] mistreatment of the Brethren since this
[1:23:45] is the word of God we simply accept it
[1:23:48] there is no argument here just a simple
[1:23:51] statement of fact yes I love it next
[1:23:55] paragraph to further clarify notice
[1:23:57] specifically the words of Matthew
[1:23:58] 25:31-46 it does not say that a Shepherd
[1:24:02] is literally separating sheep from ghats
[1:24:04] but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep
[1:24:06] from ghats these are not sheep in this
[1:24:08] particular area of time white thrown
[1:24:10] judgment the Sheep are in his fold they
[1:24:13] heard his voice the word and they
[1:24:14] followed him they already have eternal
[1:24:17] life and cannot come into the Judgment
[1:24:19] but these do not have eternal life and
[1:24:22] they are in the Judgment they are
[1:24:23] allowed to go into eternal life but upon
[1:24:26] what grounds do they enter into life
[1:24:28] eternal certainly not upon the fact that
[1:24:31] they already have his life as does the
[1:24:33] bride but they receive it because they
[1:24:35] were kind to his Brethren they are not
[1:24:38] his Brethren that would make them joint
[1:24:40] heirs with Jesus they are not heirs to
[1:24:42] anything but life they share No Throne
[1:24:45] Etc with him their names must have been
[1:24:47] in the Book of Life and not removed now
[1:24:51] because of their love of the people of
[1:24:53] God they are recognized and
[1:24:56] saved I'm going to read that again
[1:24:59] because of their love of the people of
[1:25:02] God they are recognized and
[1:25:06] saved no doubt these served and helped
[1:25:09] the children of God perhaps like
[1:25:11] Nicodemus and Gia they stood for the
[1:25:13] children in a time of
[1:25:20] trouble we love him because he first
[1:25:23] loved us
[1:25:25] us we are the Lesser Gods the Messi
[1:25:28] hates the little Gods the amateur Gods
[1:25:30] the reflection of
[1:25:31] God and we love him because he first
[1:25:34] loved us these who receive life at the
[1:25:38] white thr judgment because of their love
[1:25:42] of the people of God and we love him
[1:25:46] because he first loved us why do these
[1:25:48] people love us maybe because we first
[1:25:51] Lov
[1:25:52] them maybe because we acted like our
[1:25:56] father and we loved first and our love
[1:25:58] went first and our love went before and
[1:26:01] our love was sacrificial and our love
[1:26:03] gave of
[1:26:04] ourselves and maybe that opened the door
[1:26:07] for them to love us back and because of
[1:26:11] their love of the people of God they are
[1:26:14] recognized and
[1:26:18] saved you know what I want to be
[1:26:21] loving I want love to project I I don't
[1:26:25] want Chad to get in the way anymore I
[1:26:27] don't want my own temperament and my own
[1:26:28] feelings I want to recognize that he has
[1:26:30] called me here to be a messiah he's
[1:26:33] called me here to project the love of
[1:26:34] God Amen to love sacrificially and to
[1:26:37] love first and to go
[1:26:39] before so that somebody can love me
[1:26:43] back and they can stand there at the
[1:26:45] white Throne
[1:26:46] judgment and when Jesus says enter you
[1:26:50] into to the joys of the Lord prepare
[1:26:52] they
[1:26:52] said why why are we going in what did we
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:59] do cuz you fed me when I was hungry you
[1:27:02] clothed me when I was naked you visited
[1:27:04] me when I was in prison you'd come to me
[1:27:07] when I was sick Lord I I don't ever
[1:27:10] remember seeing
[1:27:13] you when you did it you remember your
[1:27:16] neighbor you remember that little old
[1:27:19] lady that lived next to you that that
[1:27:21] loved you and always was talking to you
[1:27:22] and you you couldn't help but love her
[1:27:24] back and
[1:27:25] remember remember that
[1:27:28] time amen and all of a sudden it'll Dawn
[1:27:31] on
[1:27:32] somebody I'm going in because of
[1:27:38] that I remember when sister lann's
[1:27:42] husband passed away and she had a
[1:27:45] neighbor that started mowing her grass
[1:27:48] shoveling her driveway and always
[1:27:50] watched out for her garage door got
[1:27:52] stuck come over that neighbors moved
[1:27:53] away says do you think God won't bless
[1:27:56] that neighbor for taking care of of
[1:27:58] himself in a form of a widow
[1:28:00] woman and why did he loves sister lanne
[1:28:03] so much because she was contener and
[1:28:05] mean and nasty and hard to deal
[1:28:08] with I don't think so when love
[1:28:11] projected he had some means to love
[1:28:14] back oh God and now here's something
[1:28:17] else that we have to
[1:28:19] notice why are they going in because
[1:28:21] when I was sick you visited me
[1:28:24] when I was sick you visited me when I
[1:28:27] was in prison you came to me when I was
[1:28:29] naked that means that you and I have to
[1:28:32] go through some things to give somebody
[1:28:34] else an opportunity to do something for
[1:28:36] us so we shouldn't go into the depths of
[1:28:38] Despair every time we have a need and we
[1:28:40] get sick or we get lonely or something
[1:28:43] happens or death in our family and
[1:28:44] there's a death in our family and a
[1:28:46] coworker comes and they bring a meat
[1:28:47] tray and send flowers and they come to
[1:28:49] the funeral and they say so many nice
[1:28:51] things about you care about you amen
[1:28:53] what happened we had to have a death in
[1:28:55] the family to create an opportunity for
[1:28:57] somebody to show love to the Brethren so
[1:28:59] that on the white Throne judgment he can
[1:29:01] say enter you into the joys of the Lord
[1:29:03] prepared before you because when I was
[1:29:06] hurt you comforted me when I was lonely
[1:29:09] you came to me
[1:29:12] yes man it changes the perspective of
[1:29:15] our life doesn't
[1:29:16] it we have to have sickness we have to
[1:29:19] have death in our family we have to have
[1:29:21] tragedy we have to lose jobs we have to
[1:29:23] do all of this to give somebody else an
[1:29:25] opportunity to care for the
[1:29:30] Brethren say God help us to be
[1:29:33] priests help us to stay engaged and
[1:29:37] loving and project love at every chance
[1:29:40] we
[1:29:40] get listen I've had people in my life
[1:29:44] that were hard to deal
[1:29:46] with I had a neighbor that was just
[1:29:49] particularly
[1:29:50] hard and he didn't like me and almost
[1:29:53] didn't like anything I I did and
[1:29:54] everything I did was
[1:29:57] wrong but every time I saw him I was as
[1:30:00] nice to him as I possibly could be and I
[1:30:02] prayed God please help help me to help
[1:30:05] me to find a way to be nice to this
[1:30:07] neighbor he hated almost everything I
[1:30:10] did but and it was funny because he
[1:30:13] started liking me and you could tell he
[1:30:15] didn't like the fact that he was liking
[1:30:19] me he wanted to be contener he wanted to
[1:30:22] be mean he wanted to be accus
[1:30:24] and he didn't like it when he when he
[1:30:26] yelled at me because there was a stick
[1:30:28] off of our tree Laying across his fence
[1:30:30] I said I'm sorry sir I didn't notice
[1:30:32] that I apologize we'll clean it up right
[1:30:33] now and he's like well well see that you
[1:30:40] do couldn't handle not fighting back but
[1:30:43] I realized the stakes are high friends
[1:30:46] the stakes are high it matters the way
[1:30:48] we treat people matters because it
[1:30:50] matters the way they treat us and if I
[1:30:53] want them to love me back I've got to
[1:30:55] project love first amen I've got to love
[1:30:58] the way God loves God so loved the world
[1:31:00] he gave God loved us first we love him
[1:31:03] because he loved us and they come into
[1:31:05] eternal life because they love the
[1:31:06] Brethren how is it they love the
[1:31:08] Brethren cuz the Brethren loved them
[1:31:10] first
[1:31:13] amen God help
[1:31:15] me to be like you on this earth like we
[1:31:20] said Sunday there'll be people that
[1:31:21] you'll never win over
[1:31:24] but if you tried you never sent anybody
[1:31:27] to hell they s
[1:31:30] themselves because they hated love and
[1:31:32] didn't
[1:31:33] want but it's not don't don't let it be
[1:31:36] our
[1:31:37] fault God please help it let let me not
[1:31:40] let it be my
[1:31:42] fault it's not going to be God's fault
[1:31:45] that anybody goes to hell cuz he sent

[1:31:52] fault either I want want to be like God
[1:31:54] on this Earth I want to love even the
[1:31:58] unlovable how could you love the
[1:32:00] unlovable because there was a day in my
[1:32:03] life I was
[1:32:05] unlovable I was born in sin shaped in
[1:32:07] iniquity come into the world speaking
[1:32:09] lies that hateful disposition was mean
[1:32:12] and
[1:32:14] contener what right do I have to hate
[1:32:16] somebody Who's acting like I used to
[1:32:20] act say God help me to be a priest that
[1:32:25] can feel the feeling of the infirmities
[1:32:29] that can have compassion and bear with
[1:32:31] somebody because I understand because
[1:32:34] I'm also tempted and living in carnal
[1:32:38] flesh and brother B said in the message
[1:32:41] the Messiah said now that is true God
[1:32:43] called Messiahs God called us and we
[1:32:46] become Kings and Priests and God Like
[1:32:48] Jesus was God's high priest we become
[1:32:50] lesser
[1:32:52] priests God and fullness dwelt in him to
[1:32:55] shine forth the expression of God to the
[1:32:57] world for God was in Christ reconciling
[1:32:59] the world to himself and as God was in
[1:33:02] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:33:04] God comes into his church and anoints
[1:33:06] him some messes oh my do you see it the
[1:33:09] same thing he did is in his church the
[1:33:12] same power he had is in his church and
[1:33:14] his church becomes his Dominion he's
[1:33:16] King over his dominion and we are Kings
[1:33:18] and Priests offering spiritual
[1:33:19] sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips
[1:33:22] giving praise to his name amen men oh my
[1:33:24] there you are messes messes little
[1:33:28] Messiahs little anointed ones anointed
[1:33:30] of what the the main one anointed off of
[1:33:33] what the main one anointed off the great
[1:33:36] one that's what I want to be in this
[1:33:38] world a little Messi at so when the
[1:33:40] widow woman lost her son I want
[1:33:43] compassion to come out of me I want to
[1:33:46] pray and intercede I want to project
[1:33:48] love I want to love others so that they
[1:33:50] have an opportunity to love me back
[1:33:52] because who knows what that'll equal in
[1:33:55] eternity
[1:33:58] am we have no idea what the white Throne
[1:34:01] judgment will be
[1:34:02] like I don't know we don't know how it
[1:34:06] will transpire how it will happen so our
[1:34:09] little finite Minds just falled apart
[1:34:11] trying to understand but can you
[1:34:14] imagine seeing people that you fellowed
[1:34:18] with that you knew that you worked with
[1:34:20] that was your family in this life
[1:34:23] can you imagine what it would feel like
[1:34:25] to see them going into eternal
[1:34:27] life because they loved you
[1:34:32] back now can you imagine what it would
[1:34:35] be like to see them going into
[1:34:37] Everlasting
[1:34:40] damnation say God give me a heart to
[1:34:44] extend
[1:34:45] love give me a desire put your whole
[1:34:48] life inside of me so that I love the way
[1:34:50] you loved help me to love to be kind to
[1:34:54] be tenderhearted to go first help me God
[1:34:58] because I need your help when I'm done
[1:35:01] wrong help me to
[1:35:03] forgive because they don't know what
[1:35:06] they're doing help me to act like you
[1:35:09] acted when you were on this Earth and to
[1:35:11] be like you would be if you were in my
[1:35:14] flesh because I believe you are in my
[1:35:17] flesh amen let's all Stand Together
[1:35:27] sometimes it's
[1:35:28] jarring to realize by Revelation who we
[1:35:33] are what we are on this Earth it's a
[1:35:36] little bit jarring I don't think we've
[1:35:38] grasped the magnetude of it I don't
[1:35:40] think we fully understand the
[1:35:41] consequences for it but oh if we could
[1:35:45] just have our eyes opened to the
[1:35:48] possibilities and if we could just relax
[1:35:50] ourselves and allow God to take more and
[1:35:52] more control so that he can live through
[1:35:55] us and he can love through us and he can
[1:35:56] serve through us I I'm excited for what
[1:36:00] God can do because there's still life
[1:36:02] available on this Earth there's still an
[1:36:04] intercession going on there's still
[1:36:06] something happening for others and I'm
[1:36:09] excited about
[1:36:11] that then let's bow our heads
[1:36:14] together pray dear heavenly
[1:36:17] father so thankful Lord
[1:36:20] for all that you've given to us Lord so
[1:36:24] thankful God for the message that you

[1:36:34] bride on this Earth for a purpose we're

[1:36:47] living in us God we just pray that you
[1:36:49] help us to surrender in a greater
[1:36:52] way God you have
[1:36:54] presented opportunities to this world in
[1:36:57] the form of your
[1:36:59] bride God help us to stay out of the way
