that's each and every one of our hearts desires here this morning this Earth this evening it's just to have him speak to us so that we can reply hear my Lord he's been so kind to us he's been so gracious he's came himself he's literally came himself and given his word to us given himself to us he has come in the form of his word in this age that we live in how can we respond with anything else besides here and my Lord I give all myself to thee let's pray together precious Lord Jesus we are so thankful once again for this opportunity that you've provided to us Lord Lord that we can come in fulfillment of your scriptures and assemble ourselves together Lord that we can come and yield ourselves to you Lord each and every member of the assembly here with our licks of fire lord and the guests that you've placed in each vessel and we can bring those in assembly for your service Lord father we would just ask now that we've done all that we can do Lord mechanically we've put our clothes on we've gotten our vehicles we've drove here Lord father bet the mechanics will never cut it Lord we have to have the Dynamics father and we stand here in humility and humbleness humbled Lord knowing that we can't provide the Dynamics that we are mere mortals and if you don't come and if you don't do something then this will just be a mechanical meeting father [Music] Lord and we it is our prayer here this evening that this would be anything but that father for we desire to have spirit and we desire to have life here so we would ask that you would come now and that you would pick up each and every gift father both speaker and hearer and that you would perform what you've ordained to accomplish for this service and for this time lord we would just bring our pastor and his family up before you at this time as well as they're a way for a period of rest Lord we would ask that your Holy Spirit would just go there and be with each and every one of them Father and that you would be their portion Lord and that you would just minister to them let them have a great time we pray bring them back safely at the appointed time the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray the bride says amen God bless you this evening it's so good to be with you if you have your Bibles we're going to go to Hebrews chapter 12. I assure you this is probably or I'm sure this is probably getting very familiar to you but I started preparing a different thought in a different direction and really thought that's what I was going to do and when I really started putting stuff together and preparing it was very clear that that was not the avenue to go with at this point in time so I'll call it apologize in advance if you hear some things that you've heard before um but it is what it is I can't do anything different without inspiration I'm literally just a pile of dirt standing here so obviously there's something here that he wants us to hear again and there is some new stuff here so it won't all be boring to you but uh there is some rehashing to do I I believe but uh it's good to be with you I do want to take a moment and thank all of those that have assisted during the birth of our little girl all those that's provided food we certainly appreciate that and have enjoyed that we especially appreciate those that took their lives into their own hands and babysitted my three little boys during that time so it's a real real soldiers there but we just appreciate it and if we have any visitors I apologize but I did just have a little baby girl last week so you can refer to me as not brother Benjamin anymore but if you would like to refer to me as father of the world's most beautiful little girl that will be perfectly fine with me and everybody will understand I'm sure it might be slightly biased but I'm pretty sure it's factual somewhere down along there God bless you we certainly appreciate you let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 before I really make a fool out of myself beginning in verse 1 says wherefore seen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God let's get down to verse 18. he says for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkest and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of orange Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore obviously referring to Israel at Mount Sinai for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake so Paul says you're not called to that but verse 22 ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel God bless you as you would take your seats so Paul is very clearly laying out to us that we are not called to Natural things that we are called to spiritual things and we as Gentiles know that we are a spiritual people compared to the Jews who are of very natural people natural numbers natural tribes natural land not so for the gentile people we are a spiritual Kingdom brother Branham um preached a message things that are to be and I've referred to that a lot and will refer to that during this service but my base inspiration for this little series here was as I was listening to things that are to be it struck me that during the course of that message you have a major end time Prophet standing on the earth and he's preaching a prophetic message of things that are to be but yet he does not reference one single natural thing everything that he speaks about is in the spiritual dimension and to me that's extremely striking in it it's extremely significant and it it tells within itself what type of people we should be because we know that we can be nothing outside of the word that God has sent to us that came through our messenger so if our messenger is picking up that word and he's picking up that inspiration from God and he is coming with nothing but spiritual applications of things that are to be I think then we should be a spiritual people and not a natural people it doesn't mean that we're not going to be affected by natural things we understand we're still in a fallen hybrid condition things are going to be around us trying to have an effect on us but we should be able to be a spiritual people and rise above that and that's what Paul is referring to here he's he's referring to you're not called to Natural things as the scripture says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual principalities so that's where our focus is here and that's what we want to hold in our mind that we are called to a spiritual position brother Branham says in the church age book the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture so how is Christ going to back up his word he's going to take his bride in a rapture you can argue and fuss about it all you want you can debate and stew about it all you want at the end of the day God will come and show who is who and what is truth and what is error he says the first Showdown was Mount Carmel this that was a natural Showdown the second was Mount Transfiguration also a natural Showdown the third will be Mount Zion spiritual Showdown we understand that that rolls over into natural manifestations we would not dispute that that's clearly taunting the message but it starts with a spiritual application it must start spiritually brother random says in the Third Exodus there's coming in Exodus where God will show who is who where the church itself the Bride of Jesus Christ will be exited out into the land that's promised in my father's house are many mansions in this place you don't have to go there and fight like they did speaking of Israel it's already prepared if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting so he immediately goes back to John 14. quoting that scripture and tying that together that where I am their ye will be also he says the great Exodus at hand this great Exodus is going to consist of God coming and showing who is who by removing his bride from the Earth brother Reynolds says in Fellowship 1955 I've never believed that heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings where there's a bunch of houses there made with mortar dobbed up with paper pain on the wall I've never believed that a supernatural being would have to live in a literal house I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 said in my father's house as many mansions he meant a body a dwelling place for the scriptures verify the same thing and say if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting you see it mortal beings is the only one who lives in mortal habitations Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations then the place that we go into until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar and clay or precious stones and jewels it's a place of condition it's a place of condition I'll give you a little hint you do not have to wait for that you have the full word delivered to you with Supernatural Vindication to allow you entrance into this condition if you so desire it's a place of condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live in into another dimension you can be caught up you do not have to wait for that there is a spiritual catching away before there is a natural catching away and you absolutely have the authority of God to do that Jesus said destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days and they thought he was speaking of Solomon's Temple but he was speaking of his own body he has gone to prepare a place for every believer that the very moment we step out of these mortal regions we don't go out into myth or some Supernatural Spirit but we go into a tabernacle a dwelling place and that might be right here in this building this morning so let's not put it off any farther than what he says we have to it might be right here in this building this evening that dwelling place that Tabernacle that condition that is available to you to be caught up in a raptured state it might be right here in this building this evening he said in a place that no other radio activity or nothing can touch back to things that are to be brother Branham says that's where we are just in case you thought I was out on a limb that's where we are we have become from Mortal beings from time beings to Eternal beings how did we become that by holding our breath and wishing a fairy dust by our own merits we have become that through the Deliverance of the word that has been given to us the full manifestation of Christ himself brother Rayner says we don't look for nail prints we look for the word made manifest and where the word is made manifest you have the opportunity to move dimensions and go from Immortal to or I'm sorry to go from Mortal to immortal he says we have become that have become that First Corinthians 2 12 says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so this is a principle that even the first church age Messenger to the Gentiles was laying down don't be comparing natural with natural compare spiritual things with spiritual things in the unveiling of God brother Branham said it was so great till even Moses Moses feared the Quake then if at that time he shook just the mountain this time he'll Shake heavens and earth what about this Glory if that was veiled by a natural Veil this is veiled by a spiritual Veil so don't try to look at the natural break into the spirit and see where you're at see what hour we're living in and once again we have that opportunity this evening we do not have to wait for that we have the full word delivered to us right in front of us even in print form that we can look into the word and see where you're at not geographically on a map but look at where you're at the same way Adam had to look where he was at when God Came Calling for him Adam Adam Where Art Thou he's asking the same question this evening through his revealed word he's laid it right before our wandering eyes and he said where are you where are you we have that opportunity this evening but it's not a natural comparison it's a spiritual application it's a spiritual comparison brother Branham said and things that ought to be are to be and last night speaking over in Yuma for the Christian business man I spoke on the subject of the Rapture now that might have been a strange subject to speak at a banquet but most everyone there was Christians and so if we're Christians I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead and I want to speak on that tonight and the subject is going to be things that are to be and now speaking last night on The Rapture so tonight I want to speak on this subject that I might tie it together with last night's message I think this is extremely important to realize that brother Branham is tying these two things together when he is preaching on things that are to be he says that's my subject but what I want to preach on is what I preached on last night the rapture one in the same thing things that are to be will put you in a raptured condition his scripture for that service obviously was John 14 I'm going to read this very briefly he says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you so if you have heart trouble this evening or maybe some mind trouble he says don't let that be don't let that be the case in my father's house are many mansions I'm telling you Saints in my father's house are many mansions that revelation will solve a lot of your heart trouble maybe even all of your heart trouble and it will certainly solve a lot of your mind trouble I am not sure that there's a trouble on the face of this Earth that can Trump the Revelation in my father's house are many mansions and one of them is mine and that's not made of brick and stone in my father's house is my body and if my body is in my father's house come what may I'll say as Jesus said destroy this Temple in less than three days I'll raise it up don't let your heart be troubled Saints don't compare natural things with natural be caught up compare spiritual things with spiritual things verse 3 and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so have we or have we not had the full truth delivered to us in this day if we've had the full truth delivered we've had the full way delivered and we've had the full life delivered because he says I am I am the truth the way and the life I'm grateful that we have that I'm grateful that we do not have to stumble in darkness I am grateful that we have the answer to the devil's question you say what question the question what question any question I have the answer to the devil's question well what's the answer to in my father's house are many mansions he has went and prepared a place for me and I know that he has went and prepared to prepare a place for me because he has been so gracious to send me a prophet in this last stage to send me a prophet to tell me I am the way this is the truth This Is The Life and the church age brother Branham said you had better come before it's too late and this is the quote that we really emphasized last service but I just want to read this and then we're going to move on to some some other things because we can we can preach that Revelation you know predestinated for known of God before the foundation of the world I mean you all know all the cliches if you've been around for more than six months we can preach that and we can stand on our head and bubble dance and do whatever else we want to do but unless the rubber meets the road it's going to come to not it's just intellectual brother Rayner says you had better come before it's too late saith the Lord and byeth me gold tried in the fire and then you will truly be rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we come into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it so all of those things are true we are predestinated we are foreknown we were attributes in the mind of God but until that becomes manifestation and until that become there is a way that that becomes in manifestation and there is a way that that comes in reality and we have to understand how that works or we're going to fail the test it says spiritually we will not leave it all know we are going to take something with us what that something is is all that we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be with the softness of this character less laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden one thing that you can take with you when you leave this earth character why was this full word delivered to us one reason character development it wasn't so that we could bubble dance and I don't have anything against bubble dancing or feeling good or even the cliches I like the cliches but at the end of the day we have to come to terms the fact and the reality and the reason that this full word was delivered for us was character development if we miss character development we've missed the point of the message direct quote brother Branham says if you miss that life you will not come up anyhow so it doesn't matter what doctrines you believe or what doctrines you can explain or what you can tie it together he says if you miss the life the character of the message you won't come up anyhow that's how important it is how many wants to come up we must have character but God is so gracious to his Saints because he's made a requirement he's made a requirement for that character but he's provided the way to have that character so yes he's made a requirement and it's it's a stiff requirement in fact the requirement is perfection but he delivered a perfect word praise the Lord brother Raynham says faith is the substance and I would love to be there tonight speaking of his house many of you know what it is to be away from home don't you say it's just a little Shack but it doesn't take a big house to make a home it's the character on the inside that makes a home not talking about brick and mortar remember what we started out with compare spiritual things with spiritual things it's the character on the inside that makes a home I can say I believe this message I can say God sent a prophet I can say a lot of things what does my character say it's the character on the inside that makes the home God hiding himself in Simplicity brother Branham says now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that this will not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ and every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord at consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people brother Branham says in the church age book a crown is given to the winner of the Olympic race it was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoke of here in Revelation given to the Martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life the one Crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are incorruptible how many would literally give their life for this gospel that's been presented to us in this last end time age many would literally do that but brother Branham is saying here that you can so how many of us have declared that we'd give our life's blood for this message but brother Branham is saying you got the choice you can do it right now he says this Crown is for those who have given given their lives literally in martyrdom but there's also a crown for those that have striven each and every day in giving their life for this gospel he says they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the Praise of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their life for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of God what a concept that those who would literally have to give their life like those that have gone on before us in the Dark Ages they have literally given their life for the gospel and he's saying that I can receive the same reward They Do by simply dying daily spiritually as Paul taught us same Crown same reward for a spiritual death to self and taking of the word all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body how many believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body you've put yourself on the hook now if you believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an internal Kingdom of substance how many believe in an internal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints so if you believe in a physical resurrection and you believe in a physical Kingdom he says you ought to lay up spiritual Treasures if you believe in those two things all too little time is given for the things of God and the recompensers of God it's too lightly esteemed he says if we believe in a physical Kingdom with physical Rewards we should lay up Treasures there where we can get them you say well what should I lay up there according to the prophet there's only one thing you can lay up there and it's not good works to your neighbor telling your neighbor you love them character that could be part of it I don't deny that but it's not just being a good person Saints it's not just saying God sent a prophet I believe the message if you truly believe in a physical Resurrection in a physical Kingdom he says you ought to believe in spiritual Treasures and that spiritual treasure is your character so you have this character but what do you do with this character how do you lay Treasures up in heaven we're going to get to that here in a minute Matthew 6 says lay not up for yourself Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break in and break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break in nor steal so now by the prophet we understand what Matthew's talking about here or what Christ is talking about here in Matthew when he says lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven we have this interpreted because now we don't have to wonder well what treasure should I be packing up there you know how big should my pockets be do I need a forklift or a dump truck Lay Up character in heaven where it can't be corrupted don't think of Heaven somewhere way up here lay up Treasures in Heaven where your character's at lay up Treasures in Heaven where moths can't corrupt it where somebody can't break in and steal it somebody can break in and steal it up here there's people out there that somebody can talk you into it and somebody else can talk you out of it you take somebody that's really sharp intellectually they can talk you in things and out of things Saints I've sat in the courtroom before and watched somebody that I know is guilty as Sin and I will have an attorney say this and here comes the defense attorney and says this and I'm sitting there wondering maybe he's not guilty that that intellectual spirit is that powerful I've said in courtrooms to where it has literally came down to the last person to have something to say and that's the way things fall because the intellectual battle up here can go back and forth back and forth back and forth you can see a video of a criminal doing something that is cut and dried black and white and you can have somebody with that sharp intellectual Spirit come in and convince you that that really wasn't them or they really didn't mean it or there's some other reason that they did it that's why he says don't lay up don't lay up Treasures where somebody can get to them somebody can get to your mind Saints how many people have we how many people have we seen I don't even have to say it that way how many times have we experienced being wrong in our mind how many times have we experienced somebody leading us astray but how many times have we had that little buzzer that brother Brandon referred to in our heart that that looks good and that sounds right and I even agree with that but something just doesn't I don't know brother Branham says don't you ever ignore that he says that is what the Holy Spirit was given to you for to keep you away from that stuff it may convince you up here don't ever disregard what's laid in Heavenly places and protect what you put in Heavenly places because ultimately it's going to have the final say so Jesus says lay up not for yourself Treasures on Earth lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven for where your treasure is there will be your heart also Colossians 3 if ye be risen with Christ seek those things which are above not on things on earth this principle is through the entire scriptures get your eyes off a natural get your eyes on spiritual Eternal things 63 the evening messenger brother Branham says Ellie's are sweet sweated it out until he found character that's right who would he get and he trusted God character for what character for Isaac the bride which was a type of the church you know that that was the natural Seed of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of Abraham well if Ellie either the messenger hunting the bride and trying to find character if that man has come a messenger of the last day trying to find the bride for Jesus how many believe we've seen that messenger he will not look for a denominational membership he will look for character that's willing a willing character watch good character first then to get her ready to meet Isaac I'm going to repeat that good character first then prepare her to get ready to meet Isaac as if if this sounds familiar it's because our pastor just preached on this it it's good that it sounds familiar but like I said I can't help the direction that I've got to go good character first then get her ready to meet Isaac and this is what my main thrust is for this evening is there are two parts to this just as our pastor preached it there's two parts to that there are two parts to this things that are to be there are two parts to this experience with Christ there are two parts to your Earthly pilgrimage God has got to come and find you without Christ coming on the scene and revealing his word to you you don't stand a chance and I don't stand a chance he has got to come and find his character here on Earth and that character is in his Saints but once he does find that character I'll speak for myself he has a whole lot of work to do to prepare that character to meet Isaac after he found the character then get her to stand still long enough to listen to his message of Isaac that's the message of the last days the evening light is first find the church where they will believe the message hunt that church down can you read what I'm talking about he says hunt where that church is that'll even let you come in that won't close the door in your face and then when you do that that then you found character there now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how that bride's got to be dressed she's got to be closed stand still this message is the exact opposite message that the laodicean churches preach because the laodicean churches preach everything but stand still and let him work on you in fact they can't stand it if you stand still if there's not a rock concert going on and a bunch of hoopla going on or as brother Branham says a bunch of Hollywood evangelism going on the laodicean church will not stand for it but brother Branham says stand still now I'm not against those things you all know me better than that I have no issues with emotion actually I take that back I do have issues with emotion I have issues I do not have issues with stimulation by revelation I have zero issues with that whether that's in a song service or in the preaching of the word or when you come through the vestibule and you see the world's newest daddy the world's beautifulest little girl whatever expression it comes in I have no problem with stimulation by regulation you say well how is that stimulation by Revelation because the doctors told me I could never have that little girl told my wife we could never have that little girl or then three little hoodlums running around with her that is stimulation by Revelation and it comes with emotion so I have no issues with emotion so long as the abasis is a stimulation by Revelation and that is what the church in laodicea will keep you from and they will cover that up with emotionalism so they don't want you to stand still long enough to get stimulated by revelation brother Brandon says stand still and get dressed by the word stand still and let the message dress you if we're to lay up character in Heavenly places there is only one Avenue that we have to do that and that is through the message of this hour but we have to stand still and let him do his job in identification brother Brandon says and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people let's mold our character this is the second part of the two parts we have character if you didn't have character you would never even stand still long enough to hear about this message you would just dismiss it and go on but because we do have character it will catch our attention and now the second part of that brother Branham is now teaching us is to stand still let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence The Works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing then when we let his character be in US then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ his mind which is his character well what is his mind his word what is his character his word what do we have available to us the mind of Christ in so much that we would have a prophet walk behind the platform and say what I want to speak on this morning is what Christ had in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world what a statement to make what a statement to back up but he did it the reason he did it was so our character could be molded not by natural influences but by Heavenly influences perfect strength my perfect weakness brother Branham says and that's the way God wants us to realize that we are totally insufficient then so we got the first part right totally insufficient that's the character he's looking for because when this message comes your way how many of you realize you were totally insufficient totally and then God takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person to make his hands do what God would have his hands do make his lips speak where God's lips would speak because they're not his they're Gods that's physical the spiritual becomes physical now your lips are not your lips they're God's lips what a thought what a responsibility how many statements from this past week do we need to go and retract now I'm guilty just like the rest of you but that's the message Saints that's the reality of the message the scripture says we're going to answer for every word that we say out of a business outside of the appropriate business for I can't think of the word that I'm thinking that I'm needing to use right now but every frivolous word that we use and speak and talk about the scripture says in brother Brandon preaches we will have to give an account for that why because my lips are not my lips and my lips right here and my tongue do not have the freedom to speak anything they want to speak they were purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ my lips have become God's lips you say well that's getting pretty serious I just I'm just reading you what he said your lips become his lips I mean we can say his feet but our feet is his feet right our hands are his hands we can say that right why can't we say his lips are my lip or my lips are his lips why because the spirit of the age brother Branham says it's Frolic and joking I'm going to get back to my notes before I get on that he says that's the spirit of laodicean entertainment Spirits frolic and joking he says that's not only the spirit of lyric seeing that's the spirit of America how much more do we have to watch against that I say Lord have mercy on me Lord have mercy on me my lips are his lips he begins to build character things that are to be he says just as soon as it's born the Breath of Life comes into it speaking of a baby and God breathes in it there and it becomes a living Soul now just as this baby is being born then the spiritual body is there to receive it and now when this body is dropped here this earth like the baby is dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again I labored on this last time I'm going to go fairly quickly through this because I know you all have got this principle but he says now stop a minute why do we have revivals why do we assemble ourselves together why am I always rebuking the people why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out it knows there's something lacking there because remember there's two parts to this walk there's two parts to this experience one is the character and the character is there but the Holy Spirit knows that there's something lacking there brother man says why do I keep preaching why do I keep rebuking the people why do we come to church is because we're molding that character we are molding that body did Jesus go to prepare it absolutely is it there absolutely is it it is it Eternal in the heavens absolutely does it need a character to go into it absolutely and that's why we're here now that part is not in question it's this part that is in question and I won't even say that it's in question it's this part that is being worked out that is being molded to fit into that as the scripture says this the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak your Eternal Body in the heavens is willing but the flesh is weak our spirit and our character needs molded to fit into that image we're going to get to that here in just a little bit there is an immortal body there waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again and I know I told you that last service but I just loved that part to receive it back into itself again if it goes back into that being that means it had to have been there before that is the answer to the devil's question you say what question I already told you the questions any questions I was already there come what may I'm going back there it's not going to say doesn't mean that you're not going to have bad days I am natural and Mortal just like the rest of you but I Pray by God's grace that we are all growing spiritually and Rising above that on a daily basis to where now as things come and they will come as you all know and that and that I know and more things will come but as they come and as more things come my revelation will grow higher and stronger and I will automatically instead of totally uh what's the word that I want to use um not taking appropriate action and making wrong decisions I will rise above that and the foremost thought on my mind will be In My Father's House are many mansions the question has already been answered he says now think if God in his Mercy has the mother before this little baby is born craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speaks forth dad I want this I want that he says he'll do everything to get it I'm paraphrasing now just a little bit for the sake of time he says but he says now think how much more Abel he is think how much a more able Christ is to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live that way he says there is something in us that calls us to live and there is something in us that calls to do right he says then God will call somebody to the platform or to the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why why does God preach the absolute truth it shows you then that if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take this away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's going to prepare you say well Jesus went and prepared it did he do a halfway job what's it need no no say he's done his part he has prepared it but he's also prepared a way for us to be molded into the image that will fit what he has prepared he has done both parts it's just a matter of whether we yield to it he says God is able to prepare us and to give to us that Crave in our life that we want to see something how many in here wants more of God why it goes to show there is more for you see you're craving it your little birth pains are coming on you need more so that we can be happy and free and you ready for it perfect how many wants to be happy congratulations laodicean wants that in fact that's all they want is to be happy and be happy right now and what right do you have to take my happiness away from me by telling me the truth that you say is truth how many wants to be free congratulations they would have seen wants to be free but there's a third part here and perfect how many wants to be perfect they ought to see him don't want that now you're not in a natural position now in order you say well that's so silly Saints it's the truth it is really that simple in order for you to even vocalize that and declare that you have to be a special class of people because the world does not want that the world wants to be happy and to be free they do not want to be perfect they may be perfect in their own eyes but they're certainly not going to want to be perfect according to the word of God and that is the only Perfection no matter how they want to interpret that or however they want to manifest that they can think that they're perfect but the scripture answers that question in the Book of Revelation when it says the church says I'm this and I'm that and I'm this and I'm that God has a pretty good answer for that says no you're not no you're not in fact if you want the truth this is what you are and he doesn't have one single good thing to say about the Lotus cnh not one single thing but they're happy and they're free they're certainly not perfect there's only one class of people that wants that and that's the ones with character already on the inside with the ability to be molded into perfection I say praise God for his grace to us Saints we we certainly do not appreciate what he has given us enough and I can say that from my heart and I know it's it's it's I'm as guilty as anybody we we do not truly grasp and appreciate what he has done for us and I pray God help us I pray God help us he has been so gracious to us to give us that ability not just that ability but to provide a way that we are going to come to that that it's certain that we come to that what a privilege he says like the little germ of life being in the bosom of God and The Germ of life is in the bosom of mother God is growing now this is where I want to really start emphasizing this God is growing listen to the next thing he says and go on to prepare the place for us the Eternal place with himself he says you do have a c Gene in you and God is growing and oh by the way he's went and prepared a place for that ties those two together Saints we have to have a character formed in US in order to fit into that image he has prepared and he has provided that way for us he says my see there's something life in there and you begin to feel well maybe I ought to do that he says but see what it is it's something your body Yonder is needing look how they communicate look at the polls as brothers Brothers says look at the pulsation between the spiritual and the natural between your Eternal Body and the one that you're in now your body Yonder is needing something and it calls to you and there's a physical response to that in so much that God would move somebody onto the platform to preach something to change your life to change your character to change my character that's how real it is he says something in your body Yonder is needing that come on but God's got the vitamins right in here for every bit of that body Jesus has gone to prepare the place in the bosom of God yes sir a little germ Son of God little daughter son or daughter of God he says in the invisible Union all that spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh that's a process is becoming becoming that's a verb that's action it didn't just happen 20 years ago when you were converted the word is becoming flesh it's a process it's the second prong character development he says manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening verb action process it's happening day by day how you tell me how by you trying to do better by you trying to be a good boy by you trying to be a good girl it's happening day by day by the process that he has provided his revealed word only way if you're not eating the book on a day today basis this process is not happening and you will be bound and stuck in low to sin condition but if you are this process is happening and I'll say it he says said God is growing day by day think of that God growing I mean you think God he's Eternal he's over the entire universe he he's the one that dwelt alone by himself with his thoughts encompassing all the universe but now here we are right at the tail end the closing moments of time and God is growing what a thought Christ The Mystery of God revealed God growing in hybrid flesh God growing in Fallen flesh that's the power that the word has been that has been delivered to us he says it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in the deserts and things taking place that I can't even keep Pace with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be unite United with his church where the word becomes the word a lot of that was review here's some new stuff for you now stay with me because when I close I'm going to close fast in The Invisible Union I'm sorry in questions and answers number one 1954 brother Branham says as I said in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here what you are what you are not will be what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here what your Celestial body is somewhere else is what you're reflecting back here in the spirit land where you are Saints we have got to get our boots off the Earth we have got to get caught up we are living as brother random says way underneath our privileges we are not fully recognizing what we are in our position with Christ and this is before the seals in the spirit land what you are there's the answer to the devil's question Saints if you are a child of God in the spirit land you tell me what power on Earth is going to change that and what trial and tribulation that you're going to face this week next week or a month from now is going to change that what overcoming power that should deliver to us I'll say it as brother Branham says the reason we find ourselves so stooped shoulders and our head down and are drooping in the mumbles and the grumbles and the cries and complaints he says because you've not been tuned into that and there's only one way to get tuned into that if you want free from the laodicean spirits there's one way and that's to get tuned into the message of this hour because it's the only Channel that's going to explain this to you and break this down for you and give you the answer to the devil's question if not you better go ahead and make an appointment with the psychiatrist because the mental oppression and the mental plagues that are coming upon this world and especially this nation you will not be able to stand there's only one thing that's going to stand that shaking and that's the message of this hour in your soul and God has been so gracious to come and tell us these things what you are no chance to that that is settled that is fact that is eternal that is reality that is unmovable what you are in the spirit land I am here if you're still vulgar minded and so forth in the spirit land you're vulgar minded here if you still got malice and envy and strife in the spirit land you're in the spirit land with that it reflects back here so you tell me which is reality if this is reflecting that which is the reality and what should I be more focused on and accept in my life and which should I believe more when the devil presents it to me I assure you he's not going to present this to you he'll present every laodicea and condition to you but he's sure not going to come and come along and remind you what you are truly in the spirit Realm there's a lot of things that he's going to tell you but that's not going to be one of them he says what you're in the spirit land it reflects back here but if your whole innermost being has become cleansed how many want to be cleansed and purged how many want to be purged and it shows that you've got a body out yonder waiting so you tell me who's farther Advanced me or that body that's waiting if it's waiting that means it's ahead of me that means it's been there before me that's been cleansed and purged and it's reacting back in the flesh what's happening in the spiritual land what's truly happening in true reality is reacting back in this flesh and in your flesh but we are so smart and we are so educated and we have such a pure written word that we can take it and we can fool 99 and maybe even 100 of the people that we associate with but this word will tell you whether you're there or whether you're not you may fool everybody else but this word will reveal to you whether you've got the goods or not it's not about convincing me convincing this brother convincing this sister it's not about convincing the guy at work it's about knowing for yourself that's where the overcoming power is he says what is there is reacting back in your flesh that's how powerful that's how real this is is it's controlling your flesh now not you controlling it this decision has already been made he says don't you see see there it is look what he refers back to all the way back in 1954 goes right back to the exact same scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting see before the seals back in 1954 immediately ties these two things together questions and answers 1954 in the evening he says you cannot be here a spiritual being sinner or saint sinner or saint without having an influence from the underworld or from the above world if you are influenced from here you're from above how many has been influenced from here meaning Heavenly places if you have the capability to be influenced from Heavenly places what does the default you were already in Heavenly places and if you were already in Heavenly places what's the next default your Eternal destination has already taken care of saints how we should rejoice if your influence your Celestial body is waiting up here but if you're Wicked and hypocritical and indifferent listen to these words if you're Wicked okay I can get that hypocritical I can get that what if you're just indifferent towards the message what if you're indifferent towards the Wednesday night service whatever happens happens maybe I get something maybe I don't maybe I grow in character maybe I don't Pastor will be back Sunday indifferent what a word if you're just indifferent towards the truth he says you're being influenced from the underworld Mercy Lord have mercy on me your Celestial body is down here regardless of how much you think it's up there because the fruits that you bear before the people proves where you're from so you are here what you are somewhere else I know I'm beating that into you but I'm not going to apologize for you you are here what you are somewhere else not what you will be somewhere else you are here now what you are now somewhere else praise God your life that you live here is just reflecting what your inheritance is when you leave here do you understand we are right now all when I think of that we are right now glorified in the presence of God born again Believers for if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting in glory not somewhere else right Yonder already waiting and these Earthly bodies groan to be clothed upon with that immortality things that are to be he says well if I've passed over I want to see Jesus he's referring back to the vision that he had going beyond the curtain of time this is the only place brother Brandon mentions this that I've ever found he's referencing back to that Vision or as he says I'll call a division obviously we know that was more than a vision that was an experience that he had but he's referencing back to that and he says he's speaking to those people and he says well if I've passed on I want to see Jesus and they said listen to what they said this is the only place that I found that he relays this they said you can't see him now this is the scripture said Souls under the altar they said this place that you're in is the scripture You Preach Souls under the altar Saints Souls under the altar was the fifth seal go to the end of the fifth seal and see what brother Branham has to say about you and try not to shout I'll give you a little hint he said something about seeing you over there my people that was over there Lord have mercy on us Saints and we just read oh okay that's good he saw us over there they are testifying the scripture that you preached about souls under the altar this is that place and he came back and said while I was there something I want to get to you here in a little bit Mercy goodness there's the answer to the devil's question he's just a little higher these are those people still speaking in that dimension Jesus referring to Jesus he's just a little higher someday he will return 1964 questions and answers he says now now the nature of the spirit of the Lord when you're born again you're not born to physical like the baby was but what's happened the spiritual Birth has come to you and while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart did you catch it growing verb action process not a one-time deal is there a one-time experience absolutely never deny that but if it was truly a one-time experience Born Again experience the spirit of God coming into you brother Branham says it will grow into your heart growing into your heart of God he says while that spiritual birth is growing there is a physical or a Celestial body growing to receive that spirit so we moan and groan and cry and Mumble about how we want to get out of here do we not you don't have to raise your hand I'll raise both of mine for you I'm ready to go Saints I got my little girl I'm ready to go but we moan and groan about all of our trials and troubles and tribulations but yet really it's up to our character development to fit into that body that's waiting on us so I would say we want to keep mumbling and grumbling and groaning and complaining okay but let's at least work on our character development at the same pace and we'll probably be better off correct at least I will praise the Lord he says and when the life leaves this body it goes to that body what life the character it goes to that body just as when the body is presented on Earth the spirit comes and when the spirit goes out of the body there is a body waiting for we know that after this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting he references this scripture from the beginning of his ministry to the end of this minute of his ministry every time this topic comes up every time he references this scripture it's a powerful scripture 1958 hear ye him now here's I'm cognizant of the time and like I said when I close I'm going to close quick so stay with me I'm not going to have time to rehash it but I've laid a really broad foundation for the last three services and it's all going to come crashing down right here but this is the process this is the purpose this is the reason he says now here's where I think the Pentecostal church has made their mistake when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but is his inheritance was not yet determined it depended upon his character so though being a son and if he was a disobedient son he would not inherit anything but still he was a son but if he was an obedient son see you can be a son but you're not going to inherit that body it doesn't change the fact that you're a son you can be a disobedient son you're still a son but you're not going to inherit that body if you want to inherit that body you have to be an obedient son he says but if he was an obedient son he was heir to all things so don't call for that body until you're an obedient to all the word it's not going to work I mean that's simple I know but do we agree with that this is what he's teaching us we can call for it all we want but if we know that we're not lined up to the word of God it's not going to work if our heart condemneth not then we have faith towards God don't call me be calling for your body until you're lined up to the word that he's already delivered don't try to get to things that are to be until you've lined up to things that are if that makes sense that that goes for me as well as anybody he says then he was heir to all things and we've been taught not only through Pentecostal Realms but through the Holiness group and the Baptist and what more I'll let you decide what what more means that when we're born he says this is what we've been taught that when we're born again we're sons of God he says that's true but that's just the beginning that's my emphasis that's true but that's just the beginning it's your character from then on what means the difference 1961 expectation the holy spirit is telling you the same thing let's be expecting let's get ready for it make ready like taking a trip get everything packed up he says no this kind of trip you unpack everything he says that's the problem we've got too much packed up now too much of what too much of me too much of my character too much of sebolt DNA still packed up here it needs some unpacking not only does it need unpacking it needs throw it in the trash it needs change completely he says no this kind of trip you unpack everything got too much packed up now that's the trouble of it we need to unload questions and answers 64. that's the reason that all these great Mysteries could not be given to Luther could not be given to Wesley could not be given to the age that just passed by us think you caught it the Pentecostal age he says pass by us Pentecostal Edge brother Brown says the Pentecostal age was the laodicean church age and he just says it's passed by us why he says why could these things not be given why it wasn't time what things is he talking about he just told us in that quote that I read you the things that we've been taught before that when we believe we're sons of God he says that's true but now he's coming and saying these other things that couldn't have been taught back then they couldn't have been taught back in those other ages why it wasn't time he says they were begotten begotten means birthed Sons they were begotten now the person of Christ himself the son of man do you understand revealing himself in human flesh it could not have come until now why could it not have come until now because now there's a people in the Earth with the character to be developed into the word that's presented if they so choose or if they chose before might I say he says now we've moved past those ages this is where we're at now Christ himself the son of man in flesh I'm here to tell you that didn't cease in 1965. it did not cease in 1965 that was the start that was the wave chief God's provided way 65 he says the church will come through justification through Luther's sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man how character development character development after the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life brother Brandon says what he did through the church ages he does to the individual if you've came through justification and sanctification and had the baptism of the Holy Spirit do not let the devil talk you out of that no matter how many times you fall on your face because there is a process that that leads to character development you are going to fall on your face hundreds if not thousands of times during character development it does not mean you have not come through this process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit In fact I would dare to say that you can't even begin character development and be worried about character development and be upset that you fell on your face until you've came through this process so the fact that you are upset with yourself for failing pretty good indication that you've been through a process now I'll say this don't try to talk yourself into it if you haven't received the baptism of the Holy Spirit get the baptism of the Holy Spirit if you have not been born again don't fool yourself for your brother your sister your neighbor to get it settle that question but once you've settled that question do not allow failures in character development to go back and raise questions there we understand that I believe we do go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when the husband and the wife will be the self same person God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same if it is the self-sane person and he is manifesting himself in his bride on this Earth I'm going to venture to say there's a pretty good character development there maybe even perfection it has to be Saints why would he give us a perfect word if we're not to come to Perfection and manifest that brother Brown said not sinless perfection not sinless perfection you're going to make bad decisions and wrong decisions during your character development but if your character development has come to the point that every time you see a slight deviation of the word in your life you repent of it and line back up to the word I can tell you by the authority of the prophet and of the authority of God's word you are in a place of perfection it's the only way you're going to come to Perfection you don't we don't stand a chance any other way and if he said to come to Perfection then I've got to find the way there I cannot be good enough to come to Perfection if I'm not perfect in the revealed word of God that he has delivered to me I don't stand a chance but if I am walking daily striving daily laying my life down in obedience to the revealed word of God for my age just as much as I'll tell you that I'm a failure I'll tell you that I'm perfect I am a failure in this flesh always have been always will be but in this dimension in this eternal Dimension this Immortal Dimension that has been offered to me that I've had the privilege to step into by the word that has been revealed to me we had a Prophet come and declare what that we were the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ how by us trying harder why us being good boys and girls by the word that he has delivered to us dying to ourself and lining up to that even if it's a minute by minute process even if it's a second by second process when you die to yourself and the deviation away from the word and you line back up with the revealed word it puts you in a state of perfection and that Saints is not a one-time thing that is a process that is character development and allow it to be such because if not you're just going to find yourself trying to get reborn and reborn and reborn and reborn and get the Holy Ghost again and again and again and again the devil is never going to tell you that you've got the Holy Ghost he's never going to tell you that that's been settled if you do have the Holy Ghost he's going to try to convince you you don't and if you don't have the Holy Ghost he's going to try to convince you that you can never get it because you'll never be good enough so if you have a little thing sitting on your shoulder chirping those two things just figure out which is true in your heart and then answer the devil's question if you don't have it get it if you do have it tell him in my father's house are many mansions and if you want to hear some more talk about that stick around because that question's already been settled I want to go through some scriptures really quick and then we're going to close and when I say really quick I mean really quick so if you have a pen and paper and want to write them down that's fine but don't even bother trying to turn to these Hebrews 12 where we started out at wherefore seen we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin with us so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith I think you got it so I'm going to go down to 23. to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to God the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect just men made perfect just men Born Again men you can't be just unless you're born again Born Again men made perfect two things Revelation 4 1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither rapture and I will show thee things which must be hereafter when you are born again you are caught up you are raptured up out of your Earthly layoutian condition what's the second thing that should happen you should start seeing things which must be hereafter not natural prophetic events things in here that need to change from this point forward he says come up here and I'll show this to you John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and so he's already come right that's what he says when he the spirit of Truth is come so he's come he's come you've received the baptism of the Holy Spirit he's come and he will show you things to come both in the scripture and things that are to come in here and change does that make sense two parts first Peter 2 verse 1 wherefore laying aside all malice and guile in hypocrisies and envies in all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby you said well I've received the word praise God now do the next part that ye may grow thereby the purpose of you receiving the sincere milk of the word is to do what character development growth he says in verse 5 ye also are Lively stones are built up building as a process action verb built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable acceptable to God by Jesus Christ Jude 1 verse 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves building as I said verb action process on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourself in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life Ephesians 2 verse 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God I'm telling you you can't be in that position without a new birth we all agree but look at verse 20. and and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together grow after the New Birth the building will be fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple growth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom also ye are building look how many verbs and action are used after the New Birth this is where we're at Saints character development whom you are also building together for a habitation of God through the spirit First Corinthians 12. verse 27 now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular really good position to be in right praise God we are members of the body of Christ we we are the body of Christ members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of the Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way your members of the body of Christ and Paul says you've got all these gifts and all these Ministries but yet there's a more excellent way character development still going on First Peter 1 1. I'm going to skip to verse 9 actually First Peter 1 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls receiving the end of your faith so if you receive the end of your faith there had to have been a beginning of your faith correct so the beginning of your faith is not the end two things correct character development Proverbs 1 7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom I'm sorry beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction Proverbs 9 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so if knowledge has a beginning does it not have an end if wisdom has a beginning does it not have an end two things here character development have you come to the knowledge of the new birth that's the beginning let it be developed have you come to the beginning of wisdom you say well I don't know brother random says wisdom will come into the church and tell you what age you're living in have you received the beginning of wisdom let it have its due process character development the reason that you know what age you live in is so that you can come to the end of your faith that you can come to the end of knowledge that you can come to the end of wisdom and have perfect character Matthew 24 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax old but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved so if you have to endure something that tells me it's not a one-time blip on the radar there's some endurance here there is a process here there is a walk here there is character development here second Timothy 4 7 Paul speaking he says I fought the good fight and I have finished my course so if Paul finished his course what does that mean I think you all got it by now there was a beginning to his course where was the beginning when he got smooth off his high horse is that where he stopped no Paul says I fought the fight I finished my course getting knocked off my horse was the beginning of my course but it surely wasn't the end of his course I have kept the faith Ephesians 4 let's go to 12 for the sake of time oh no let's start at 11. and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for what for the perfecting of the Saints and I know I've said it a hundred times maybe this will be the last verb action process perfecting after the New Birth character development skipping to verse 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him all things which is the head even Christ Philippians 1 8 being confident of this one thing that he which hath begun a good work and you will perform it into the day of Jesus Christ second Corinthians 3 17 now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty how many has received the spirit of the Lord and how many has been said at Liberty from your sins but we all with open face beholding in a glass the glory of the of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory changed verb action process character development after you've received the spirit of the Lord and been said at Liberty musicians please come I read this quote last time but it is super important so I'm going to read three more quotes and we're going to be out of here in five minutes unless you stay in worship if you stay in worship that's up to you how long you're out of here brother Brandon says I know your faith the scripture speaking Christ speaking brother brand I'm quoting in the church age book I know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamus you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith Romans 5 3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patients as seen in James 1 4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect an entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and for God this is the process of character development he makes the requirement Saints and he provides the process for it and the answer for it the process of character development is dying to yourself daily waiting on God for the answer and waiting for God to manifest the answer the process of character development is that patience not to snap to your own ways but let the mind of Christ be in you remember he said his mind is his will and his will is his word the process of character development is when you hit the roadblock when you hit the snare when you hit the Trap when you hit the trial stop for a second stand still let him Dress You by his word be caught up die to your own ideas and let him wait on him and for him to provide the solution whether it's a little problem or a big problem his requirement for us is perfection and he's provided the process for that in Investments he says as I said this week Ellie's are sweated it out trying to find character you can go ahead and play something if you would like please and when he found Rebecca then he had an awful time making her stand still he could get her dressed he says he had an awful time getting her to stand still so he could get her dressed same thing it is with the church we find the character in the Pentecostal Church you find when you got character to work on but then you can't make them stand still long enough to bring them back to where they once fell from how many wants to go back to where you once fell from you didn't fall from being a good boy it was a lot higher than that [Music] he says in order to get them back to where they once fell from since I want to go back to where I once fell from [Music] to get them back to where I they once fell from they've got to stand still long enough to have their character worked on [Music] praise God I say let's stand still s in the scripture I think it's Psalms 46 10 stand still and know that he is God I'm telling you to stand still but now I'm telling you to stand up stand still and know that I am God what's he saying stand still don't solve your own problems Don't Take Your Own Way know that I am God wait on me and wait for me how many wants to stand still and know that he is God and let him dress you and develop your character to where he can put you back where you once fell from I'm going to read this last quote where I started out he says the second a forerunner of Christ which was brother Branham we know well so for the latter rain Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was Mount Transfiguration the third will be Mount Zion not to change what he said but I'm going to say it this way the third is Mount Zion that's where we're right now a spiritual Showdown will you take your way or will you heed the call to come to Mount Zion will we be a natural people and respond naturally or we would be a spiritual people and respond to a spiritual Mountain Zion because the scripture says we're not called to Natural Things were called to go back to where we fell from what we are there is what we are here I say Lord mold my character through whatever process you have to mold my character to make me fit that reality do we agree with that praise God I know you do God bless you thank you for being patient for me let's pray together Lord Jesus father we just want to thank you for coming and being with us this evening Lord Lord we want to lift our hands in worship to you Lord and in gratitude that you have called us to perfection and that you have provided a word for us to get there and Lord those two are facts they are Undisputed you have done it it's history but Lord we want to stand here and ask in your mercy and in your grace that you will come and that you will allow us to stand still and be dressed by this word you have so graciously sent to us that you will not find a flippant woman when you return running to and fro but you will find a wife in her place of duty standing still and dressed appropriately in christ-like character of perfection we know you will do this Lord because you said you would have a bride and if you said you would have a bride you're going to have a bride and not only did you say you would have a bride you said you would have a bride without spot or wrinkle Lord those things are factual they are true they are unwavering but we want to come now both individually and as the assembly and submit ourselves to you afresh and Lord say as Mary did Let It Be according to Thy Word let it be in US according to Thy word let it be in me according to Thy Word I commit this congregation to you Lord commit myself to you and I pray that as you've spoken this word this was a prophetic word delivered to us and as you've spoken this word over the people so as you have spoken so let it be done in me and into this congregation I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints sing this glory to glory

passions the clay vessel of order I am [Music] and it's all because Jesus he didn't grow the day away empty and broken [Music] came back together [Music] but he did not despair he started over yeah and I I bless the day he didn't throw the play away cause over and over holds me and makes me into his life Is Blindness he Fashions the clay a vessel of order up today and it's all it's all because Jesus he didn't throw the glitter he is the Potter and I am the clay I'm molded in His image he wants me to stay but when I Stumble and fall and mighty vessels [Music] over and over he molds me and makes me into his lightness he Fashions the glaze The Vessel of Honor Ed by and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away well over and over he moves me and makes me into his life his loudness
