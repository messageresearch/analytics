[0:00] but the opening of The Seven Seals in
[0:02] Revelations 10 in the full word being
[0:04] born into a manifestation again and it
[0:07] was Vindicated by the spirit of God in
[0:10] its full strength here upon the Earth
[0:12] manifested here in the same way it's
[0:14] doing the same things here on Earth you
[0:16] see it it's Jesus Christ the same
[0:19] yesterday today and forever do you see
[0:22] it
[0:23] that's my question have you seen it
[0:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[0:28] and forever fully manifested manifested
[0:32] is to be made flesh God veiled in human
[0:36] flesh again Discerning the thoughts and
[0:38] the intents of your own heart
[0:40] I had a conversation with a brother a
[0:43] while ago about a month ago when brother
[0:44] Jean Kadima and I told him in my heart
[0:46] it's burning I says it's like I just
[0:48] Abba Father Abba Father I want to preach
[0:51] on it and then we got to talk and we
[0:52] talked for an hour almost an entire hour
[0:54] and just sharing what what was stirring
[0:57] in my heart brother John Kadima comes up
[0:59] that night and his opening scripture is
[1:01] Galatians 4 and Abba Father and he
[1:03] preaches everything we talk about that
[1:05] morning
[1:07] who is this in our midst
[1:09] is what is going on do you notice it's
[1:11] not a public show do you notice how calm
[1:14] and quiet these things are do you notice
[1:16] there's not a lot of screaming and
[1:17] shouting in the public running in to see
[1:19] something but it's still Jesus Christ
[1:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22] Discerning and identifying what you're
[1:25] talking about in your home what you have
[1:27] a cup of coffee with a brother over here
[1:29] on this side who is this in our midst
[1:31] but see it's just as calm and settled as
[1:34] can be
[1:35] will the bride have a great ministry yes
[1:37] but it'll be so humble it'll be so
[1:39] humble people won't even realize it it
[1:42] won't be screaming and shouting in the
[1:43] public coming from all places to see a
[1:46] skeptical or spectacle nope you know
[1:49] after the resurrection when Jesus came
[1:51] back on the scene he went to people
[1:53] privately
[1:55] if what a resurrection that was what a
[1:57] resurrection this is where God himself
[1:59] is individually coming to you meeting
[2:02] you when you're discouraged out like
[2:04] Peter fishing by the seashore he comes
[2:06] to you in your place of discouragement
[2:07] and begins to talk to you and you read
[2:09] this in the Bible and then the brother
[2:10] says this to you when you call him and
[2:12] then the minister preaches on the same
[2:13] thing that you have need of that day
[2:15] who is this is this the Mighty God
[2:18] unveil it is the Mighty God unveil he's
[2:21] here he's doing the same things that he
[2:23] did then doesn't that declare him to be
[2:25] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:29] he is he's here but see how quiet and
[2:32] personal and private it is now
[2:34] it's in silence not a lot of screaming
[2:37] shouting and Gathering everybody in no
[2:39] he's meeting you quietly in the secret
[2:42] of your own prayer life of your own
[2:44] devotion and walk with him he comes to
[2:46] you here he comes to you here it comes
[2:48] to you here so shocking now but see so
[2:52] humble
