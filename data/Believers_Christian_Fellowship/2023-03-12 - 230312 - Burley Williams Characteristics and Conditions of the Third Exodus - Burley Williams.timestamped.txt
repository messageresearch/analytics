[10:10] you are here
[10:12] [Music]
[10:14] Among Us
[10:20] [Music]
[10:27] your presence
[10:30] in this place
[10:36] you are here
[10:41] Among Us
[10:46] power
[10:52] I'm here to
[10:56] his name you are here in our men
[11:13] how is
[11:27] we are changed as you need in our midst
[11:32] you are here
[11:34] you are here
[11:39] Lord we've waited
[11:45] [Music]
[11:52] Holy Spirit Come here
[12:02] [Music]
[12:06] praise the Lord
[12:08] do you believe that
[12:10] the Holy Spirit changes things amen
[12:13] amen is good to be in the house of the
[12:16] Lord could we just by our hearts
[12:19] father we just want to thank you this
[12:22] morning and we believe that your holy
[12:24] spirit is definitely in our midst
[12:27] and that's what our heart long for Lord
[12:29] that when we come to the services
[12:32] we come to church we know that there's a
[12:35] promise where two or three are gathered
[12:37] in our name you will be in our midst
[12:40] and that's what we come oh God to hear
[12:42] from you and be into your presence
[12:45] because in your presence things happen
[12:47] things change in your presence that's
[12:51] why we want to enter ourself content
[12:53] into just like the holiest of holies
[12:55] where there is life there's nothing
[12:57] artificial everything is real because
[13:01] it's your presence and then that brings
[13:03] the change
[13:04] and we remember the scripture that how
[13:06] Aaron didn't put a rod in there that Rod
[13:09] was dead but yet when it got into your
[13:12] presence it brought a resurrection it
[13:14] brought life and that's the same thing
[13:17] with us Lord sometimes we can feel dead
[13:19] we can feel down we can feel depressed
[13:23] we can have many things going on in our
[13:25] hearts in our lives but if we can just
[13:28] get back into your presence it'll bring
[13:30] us a Revival back down into our soul so
[13:34] that we can have a clearer understanding
[13:36] of the challenges and to face things
[13:38] that we have to face in this day and
[13:40] time so Lord as we go into your word we
[13:43] pray that you just give us understanding
[13:46] and you just open our hearts to receive
[13:49] and uh do we can be drawn closer to you
[13:52] father as the words of Life Goes Forth
[13:55] so we commit everything through your
[13:57] hands not now Lord in the name of Jesus
[13:59] Christ we pray
[14:01] amen amen we go to Exodus chapter 3.
[14:09] and we pray the Lord be with brother
[14:11] Chad plus they're having some wonderful
[14:13] service I think in the Philippines
[14:15] and uh it's a privilege to be here this
[14:18] morning and uh in Exodus chapter 3
[14:23] we'll go to verse 5. he said draw not
[14:26] hither
[14:27] put off thy shoes for off thy feet
[14:30] for the place wherein thou standards is
[14:32] Holy Ground
[14:33] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[14:36] father the god of Abraham the god of
[14:39] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[14:43] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[14:46] God
[14:48] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[14:50] Affliction on my people
[14:51] which are in Egypt and I've heard
[14:54] they'll Cry by reason of the attached
[14:56] Masters
[14:57] for I know their sorrows I really like
[15:01] that scripture
[15:02] God said for I know their sorrows he
[15:06] know their sorrows he knows our sorrows
[15:09] amen
[15:11] in verse 8 and I am come down to deliver
[15:14] them
[15:15] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[15:18] bring them up out of that land that
[15:20] you're a good land into a large into a
[15:23] land flowing with milk and honey
[15:26] unto the place of the Canaanites and the
[15:28] High Tides amorites parasites and the
[15:31] High bikes and the jebusites now
[15:34] therefore Behold The Cry of the children
[15:36] of Israel is coming to me and I have
[15:39] also seen the oppression which the
[15:42] Egyptians oppressed them verse 10 come
[15:45] down therefore and I will send thee unto
[15:48] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[15:50] people the children of Israel out of
[15:53] Egypt amen you may be seated
[15:56] in this verse of scripture here I'm
[16:00] taking this uh when the prophet of God
[16:02] preached the Third Exodus when he began
[16:05] to look into the scripture he said when
[16:07] God said I come down to deliver them out
[16:10] of the hand of the Egyptians and then he
[16:13] said in verse 10 come therefore and I
[16:16] will send thee he said God said I'll
[16:19] come down but Moses I'm sending these so
[16:21] what is it God going in the form of a
[16:24] man
[16:26] can we say praise the Lord amen so this
[16:30] morning if the Lord would help us I want
[16:33] to just take a thought on the the
[16:36] characteristics and conditions of a
[16:39] Third Exodus that's what we would like
[16:41] to minister on Amen and uh I appreciate
[16:45] brother Sergey I don't know where he at
[16:47] where you at brother
[16:49] yeah
[16:51] God bless you brother I appreciate it
[16:52] driving me down
[16:54] he drove to he's pretty fast
[17:01] but we made it brother
[17:05] so amen we just had a good Fellowship
[17:08] last night with the Brethren and the
[17:10] omniscient Saints uh really just enjoy
[17:13] sharing the word of the Lord but we're
[17:15] here this morning I pray that you just
[17:18] remembering me in your prayers yesterday
[17:20] the enemy really tried to bother me in
[17:23] my eye a little bit there but by God
[17:26] grace we just keep pressing on
[17:29] amen now uh I want to uh read a quote
[17:34] here this coming from the message the
[17:36] Third Exodus and uh
[17:41] he says
[17:46] excuse me
[17:47] he said we are in an exodus
[17:50] no let's go this isn't a message to
[17:53] Third Exodus he said the first Exodus
[17:56] what did he do
[17:58] he brought them out of a natural land to
[18:02] a natural land
[18:04] he said the second Exodus he brought
[18:06] them out from a spiritual condition into
[18:10] a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:14] he said now he's bringing them
[18:17] from the spiritual baptism of the Holy
[18:20] Ghost right back into the Eternal land
[18:23] of the Millennium and the great
[18:25] Hereafter and he I like how he put it
[18:28] same pill of Fire
[18:30] by the same anointed system the same God
[18:34] doing the same things
[18:36] and the same word
[18:39] declared the first one declare the
[18:42] second one the same word declared the
[18:45] second one has declared the third one
[18:48] and here we see it amongst us now he
[18:52] said come out oh come out of this chaos
[18:55] come to the Living God come to the word
[18:58] and the Word was made flesh and amongst
[19:01] us and now he's in our flesh dwelling
[19:06] amongst us come out and serve the Living
[19:09] God now he just explained each three
[19:13] Exodus now I want to go and read a
[19:17] scripture
[19:18] and we'll go back into this quote I want
[19:20] to go to Matthew chapter 4.
[19:24] Matthew chapter 4 and we want to go to
[19:27] verse 13.
[19:34] the scripture says in leaving Nazareth
[19:37] he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is
[19:40] upon the Sea Coast and the borders of
[19:42] Zebulon and Nephilim he said that it
[19:46] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[19:49] Isaiah's the prophet saying the land of
[19:52] Zebulon and the land of Nephilim by the
[19:55] way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of
[19:59] the Gentiles the people which sat in
[20:02] darkness saw great light and to them
[20:05] what sat in the region in the shadow of
[20:08] death light is sprung up they said from
[20:11] that time Jesus began to preach and to
[20:14] say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[20:18] at hand now I want to go to first
[20:21] Thessalonians chapter 4.
[20:27] thank you
[20:34] and we'll go to verse 14 very familiar
[20:37] scriptures
[20:40] so for we believe that Jesus died and
[20:44] rose again even so dim which uh
[20:47] which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[20:51] him for this we say unto you by the word
[20:54] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[20:57] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[20:59] not prevent them which are asleep
[21:02] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[21:05] heaven with the Shout with the voice of
[21:08] an unchanging Archangel and with the
[21:10] Trump of God and the dead of Christ
[21:12] shall rise first then we which are alive
[21:16] and remain shall be caught up together
[21:18] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[21:21] in the air so shall we ever be with the
[21:25] Lord wherefore Comfort one another with
[21:28] these words amen so if you ever feel
[21:31] uncomfortable and going through
[21:33] something just start thinking about the
[21:35] rapture
[21:37] amen that one day we'll be leaving here
[21:39] by his grace and we have something to
[21:41] look forward to amen now like I said I
[21:45] want to preach on the characteristics
[21:47] and the conditions of the Third Exodus
[21:50] amen and uh I know I won't finish but I
[21:54] just want to maybe hit some highlights
[21:55] and if the Lord would help us there's a
[21:58] lot of things going on and a lot of
[22:01] things happening today
[22:02] but I do believe by the way of the
[22:05] message of the hour God had committed in
[22:08] a way that for us to even understand the
[22:11] Third Exodus we'll have to understand
[22:13] the first and the second then we can
[22:16] understand the third because it's
[22:18] actually it's the same amen but now we
[22:22] want to talk about this morning is
[22:24] characteristics and conditions and I
[22:27] believe it's the Lord will help us we'll
[22:28] see a lot of things that are happening
[22:31] today I think sometimes we see a lot of
[22:34] things happening and going on we get
[22:36] overexcited sometimes and be like wow
[22:39] and so forth but when it comes to the
[22:41] reality of these things there's nothing
[22:43] new Under the Sun
[22:45] everything that's happening now has
[22:47] already happened before
[22:49] so we condensed I might not I'm not
[22:52] preaching nothing different or nothing
[22:53] new things that we literally already
[22:55] know but I guess I could do like Peter
[22:58] said this morning I know that you know
[23:00] these things but I stir your mind up by
[23:02] the way of remembrance because sometimes
[23:05] we forget sometimes praise the Lord that
[23:08] prophecy is being fulfilled into what's
[23:11] happening now like I said there's
[23:12] nothing literally nothing new in front
[23:14] of the sun that's why I'm so thankful we
[23:16] can go back into the Bible go back into
[23:19] the scripture and see what has already
[23:20] been then we can see what is going on
[23:23] now amen that's why Jesus Christ
[23:26] announced himself also in the Book of
[23:28] Revelation he said he which was which is
[23:31] and which is to come it's the same
[23:34] yesterday today and forever and I thank
[23:37] God uh for the pattern of the scriptures
[23:39] like the prophet said in Christ with
[23:41] mystery God revealed when he was
[23:43] speaking about the opening of the
[23:44] seventh seal he said that you know we
[23:46] can study these things how God have
[23:48] revealed himself through the Seven Seals
[23:51] in the lives of Believers and stories
[23:54] and characters he said just look into
[23:56] them things it was all alone the hidden
[23:59] mysteries of God was led to these things
[24:01] still unveiling himself revealing this
[24:04] great Plan of Redemption that's why when
[24:06] we read about Ruth we read about Esther
[24:08] in the book of Jeremiah when we read
[24:11] these things it still is God unfolding
[24:13] himself showing us the pattern and plan
[24:16] that you and I have a wonderful
[24:17] opportunity to see today the bride got
[24:20] it all
[24:22] we see it all it's been given all to us
[24:25] and we thankful that for that because
[24:27] God wants his people to not be tossed
[24:29] and turned with every Farm win and
[24:31] Doctrine he want us to be stable is that
[24:34] right praise the Lord you know uh I was
[24:37] sitting in the uh I do a little bible
[24:39] study back home and and and when I went
[24:42] to go do it we've been on the subject of
[24:43] the mark of the beast and I noticed uh
[24:46] it was a young girl who didn't show up
[24:48] to the Bible study and they they began
[24:50] to explain to me why I said they said
[24:52] she's not here today she's went she went
[24:55] to Kentucky or to Asbury I'm pretty sure
[24:58] y'all don't heard about what's going on
[25:00] at the college up in Asbury they said
[25:02] this Great Big Revival and all these
[25:05] things is taking place and I said so
[25:07] okay so she took off and skipped the
[25:09] Bible study and went there I said I'm
[25:10] not offended about that but you know we
[25:13] have to understand something brothers
[25:14] and sisters the the way they say that is
[25:17] a Revival that is actually not a Revival
[25:21] that's just another move is what that is
[25:23] but in all respect I do believe there
[25:27] there are some people are actually
[25:29] sincere because I watch some of it they
[25:31] actually really are sincere but what
[25:33] they're actually they're thirsting and
[25:35] actually hungry for the Holy Ghost but
[25:37] if you can look at the whole scenery
[25:39] there it's just a bunch of entertainment
[25:42] and it's about your singing because
[25:44] there's no Revival without the opening
[25:46] of the word
[25:48] but in respects I give them respect for
[25:50] that but in my mind they saying how they
[25:53] want the move of God and they want the
[25:55] the Holy Spirit I look at that that's
[25:57] nothing but the foolish virgins because
[26:00] you remember the prophet said when they
[26:02] went to go out to buy the uh that's when
[26:04] the bridegroom comes so all of these
[26:07] things that's happening and I believe
[26:08] God is doing something and those things
[26:10] you and I need to look at that if they
[26:12] crying for the Holy Spirit we need to go
[26:14] back to what the prophet said you got to
[26:16] remember that's where the time when the
[26:18] bridegroom come see people in their mind
[26:21] they say they want the Holy Ghost that's
[26:24] what they say they want but they don't
[26:25] want the word
[26:27] you'll find out if somebody really want
[26:29] the Holy Ghost by giving them the word
[26:31] because then you give them the word they
[26:33] say I don't want to believe that I don't
[26:34] receive I don't receive this well you
[26:36] don't want the Holy Ghost because if you
[26:38] get the Holy Ghost that's what it's
[26:39] going to take you back it's to the word
[26:42] can we say praise the Lord so but I have
[26:44] respect for those things I'm not a
[26:46] Critic some people say oh look at them
[26:48] no I don't I don't do things like that
[26:50] I'm just trying to see look into the
[26:53] what's been prophesied and see what God
[26:55] is doing and what God is actually
[26:57] showing us amen so now one thing about
[27:01] this Third Exodus I might not I might
[27:04] preach it a little different but same
[27:06] Revelation it's just an angle that I was
[27:09] looking at some things or things that
[27:11] happening now doesn't happen and it's
[27:14] it's all nothing new like I said so I
[27:17] might have a little different approach
[27:18] to it but it's the same Revelation amen
[27:21] so we'll understand when we look back
[27:24] what's happening in the first Exodus
[27:26] there's some things that I want to point
[27:28] out because remember
[27:30] before they got in the first Exodus they
[27:34] went from a natural land to a natural
[27:36] land but before they got there it was a
[27:39] Wilderness Journey
[27:41] can we say man and a lot of things
[27:43] happen in the wilderness Journey praise
[27:46] the Lord so that happened before they
[27:49] got into the promised land now the same
[27:51] when Jesus Christ came when Jesus Christ
[27:53] was talking with the disciples they was
[27:56] following him they was walking with him
[27:59] really that was they haven't Jesus
[28:01] having taken them into their land that
[28:04] he came to take them to which was the
[28:06] day of Pentecost but before they got
[28:09] there a lot of things took place before
[28:11] they got there so it was just like when
[28:14] he was with the disciple that was their
[28:16] little portion of a Wilderness Journey
[28:18] can we say Amen praise the Lord now you
[28:21] and I we also know that the promised
[28:24] land today for us is also the baptism of
[28:27] the Holy Ghost we understand that but in
[28:30] the reading the quote you gotta also
[28:31] remember too as he put it in the quote
[28:34] he said that we also been promised uh
[28:36] the the let me just read that to you
[28:38] real right quick for you again so you'll
[28:40] see exactly what I'm saying because I'm
[28:43] not trying to interject nothing but I
[28:45] just want to know he said now he's
[28:47] talking about the Third Exodus now he's
[28:49] bringing them from the spiritual baptism
[28:52] of the Holy Ghost that means we already
[28:54] got it
[28:56] can we say man but that's not it's not
[28:59] the complete the journey to where we're
[29:01] going can we say Amen now if you're born
[29:04] again yeah you're in your Promised Land
[29:06] what God had given you but for according
[29:09] to this quote to complete everything
[29:11] listen what he said he said right back
[29:14] to the Eternal land of the Millennium
[29:17] and the great Hereafter so that let us
[29:20] know that there's more to even come with
[29:22] this can we say amen and we haven't
[29:24] gotten into the Millennium yet
[29:26] we might be born again but we haven't
[29:28] got there yet so that means things still
[29:31] had to happen before we even get there
[29:33] the same as things had to happen before
[29:35] they got the cannon the same thing
[29:37] happened before they got to Pentecost
[29:40] there's some things still gonna have to
[29:42] happen before we get to to fulfillment
[29:44] the fullness of this quote can we say
[29:47] Amen so there's things happen in between
[29:49] we need to see what happened in the past
[29:51] we'll understand what is happening now
[29:54] so in the first Exodus there's many
[29:58] things that was taking place we will
[30:00] find that in the first Exodus there was
[30:02] some uh uh uh laws were introduced
[30:07] Pharaoh has changed his laws he had to
[30:10] make Commandments and did we see that
[30:12] there was pressure on the Believers then
[30:14] we see that there was a prophet then we
[30:17] see it as a focus on children then we
[30:19] see then that first Exodus signs and
[30:21] wonders then we also see in that Exodus
[30:24] the pillar of fire and we also see
[30:26] impersonators had to happen in that
[30:29] Exodus and then I put down most
[30:31] importantly it's the lamb
[30:34] can we say Amen because there's no
[30:36] completion of no Exodus without the lamb
[30:38] without the shedding of the blood
[30:40] there's nothing no complexion can we say
[30:43] Amen so let's just kind of I just want
[30:45] to just kind of talk about these things
[30:46] so what I read in Exodus 3 Matthew
[30:49] chapter four and first Thessalonians is
[30:51] to me it's the three key scriptures of
[30:54] each Exodus amen and we'll go back into
[30:57] these things if the Lord permit amen now
[31:00] he says here uh in the message of Exodus
[31:04] this is not the Third Exodus it's the
[31:06] message called an exodus he said finally
[31:09] there came a time for The Exodus The
[31:12] Exodus means a calling out of the
[31:16] separation it comes a time where God had
[31:19] to separate his people that was in
[31:21] bondage a beautiful type of today is I
[31:24] think the church means to call out and
[31:27] then he says here in the voice of the
[31:29] sun which is a very wonderful quote to
[31:31] me he said The Exodus was at hand and
[31:35] just listen carefully how he put this he
[31:37] said exodus mean to be taken out brought
[31:41] out he said now we find
[31:44] excuse me now we find out that usually
[31:48] just as those joint Crossroads other
[31:52] Exodus the unusual begins to happen
[31:56] amen he said the crossroads of an ex
[31:59] unusual things begin to happen can you
[32:02] see just in the last past years unusual
[32:06] things been happening
[32:08] give me say man well we called them
[32:10] unusual but when we see something
[32:12] happening then we can take it back to
[32:14] the word it's no longer unusual because
[32:17] now we see
[32:18] amen he said unusual begin to happen
[32:22] he's I believe we are there again I
[32:26] believe we're there at The Exodus of the
[32:29] Bride to go meet the bridegroom I
[32:33] believe the Exodus is ahead so now he's
[32:35] talking about the Exodus is to go meet
[32:37] the bridegroom but then when he said in
[32:40] the Third Exodus bringing the completion
[32:42] of the third exit to that great Eternal
[32:44] place of the Millennium so it all Blends
[32:46] in together and there's a lot of things
[32:48] inside of here can we say Amen so now we
[32:52] was going to deal with these things
[32:53] first of all we see in the beginning of
[32:56] the first Exodus hell we see how God was
[32:59] behind everything how God I like how God
[33:02] planned things when God planned
[33:04] something he don't he don't have to
[33:06] rethink it
[33:07] can we say man his thoughts are Eternal
[33:10] and when he lays it out he lays it out
[33:13] and when God lays things out he don't
[33:15] have no counselor with him
[33:18] give me say Amen he's there by himself
[33:20] he lays it all out he lays out his great
[33:22] plan and God just sit and watch how his
[33:25] plan that he had in the backside of his
[33:28] mind just coming to pass amen now
[33:31] um in the first Exodus we understand uh
[33:35] when you go to the third message Third
[33:36] Exodus we find the children of Israel
[33:38] was down in Egypt if you will let's just
[33:40] turn to that scripture Exodus chapter
[33:42] one
[33:44] foreign
[33:46] and we want to go to verse six
[33:54] Exodus chapter 1 verse 6 it said and
[33:56] Joseph died
[33:57] and all his Brethren and all that
[34:00] generation
[34:02] he said the children of Israel was
[34:04] fruitful and their creatures abundantly
[34:06] and multiplied and waxed exceedingly
[34:09] Mighty and the land was filled with them
[34:12] first of all you go back the prophet
[34:14] said why he said if they uh he said it's
[34:18] there in Egypt not in their Promised
[34:20] Land we need to find out what got them
[34:23] down there why did this happen he said
[34:25] why it happened is because they rejected
[34:27] Joseph he said they rejected Joseph
[34:30] which is the spiritual part they reject
[34:33] the spiritual thing that will cause them
[34:35] to be down there in an exodus amen but
[34:39] no we also know it goes even back
[34:41] further than that it goes all the way
[34:43] back even with Abraham because remember
[34:46] God told Abraham your children were so
[34:49] John in a straight country which is not
[34:51] theirs 400 years amen so we know when
[34:55] God speaks something it makes no
[34:57] difference how many years it takes it's
[35:00] going to come to pass once he's spoken
[35:01] it and God man it's already finished so
[35:05] now look at he giving Moses Abraham the
[35:08] promise now God is orchestrating
[35:10] everything for the promise to come to
[35:12] pass I just like that when God promised
[35:15] something he is the great orchestrator
[35:17] he brings everything put it in his place
[35:20] for his promises to come to pass amen so
[35:23] now we see that we're just going to do a
[35:26] little quick little history here we see
[35:27] that Joseph no Joseph typing Christ amen
[35:31] and we see how his Brethren begins to
[35:33] hate him I know you all know the story
[35:35] but we're just going to go over it again
[35:36] we know his brothers begin to hate him
[35:38] they begin to like him because Joseph
[35:40] telling them the things that God showed
[35:42] him and so forth they just didn't like
[35:44] him at all you know they man ain't
[35:45] nothing like nothing too different today
[35:47] in it sometimes you want to talk about
[35:48] some things that Gotham showed you and
[35:50] you just rejoicing sometimes people get
[35:53] mad at you
[35:55] why they get mad at you because ain't
[35:56] nothing happening in their life and you
[35:58] trying to Rejoice what God is doing in
[36:00] your life they get mad at you they
[36:02] shouldn't get mad because the same God
[36:04] that can stir you up it's the same God
[36:06] can stir them up
[36:08] amen but think about it there was
[36:11] nothing Joseph could do to stop his
[36:13] brothers from hating him because there
[36:16] was a promise there was a prophecy God
[36:19] had to get Joseph down in Egypt so
[36:21] nothing that he could do but this I'm
[36:23] just looking at how God just do things
[36:25] and now so we see they get down to Egypt
[36:28] and I know you know the story I'm just
[36:30] saying this fast so I can get to my
[36:31] message we see Joseph he get down to
[36:34] Egypt we know the story the children of
[36:36] Israel was actually in a comfort zone
[36:38] down in Egypt
[36:40] Joseph made sure they had the best amen
[36:43] the Egyptians wouldn't bother them they
[36:45] had the best because Joseph was still
[36:47] alive so now after Joseph died we see
[36:51] now God said I still got to fulfill my
[36:54] promise that they're going to be that
[36:56] 400 years and they're going to be led
[36:58] out with a mighty hand so what happened
[37:01] God had to start make things change to
[37:03] make the children of Israel
[37:05] uncomfortable because if that if pharaoh
[37:08] oh if that first pharaoh never died he
[37:12] still would have had respect to the
[37:13] children of Israel because of Joseph so
[37:16] God had to let him die let a pharaoh
[37:19] come up that didn't know Joseph
[37:21] other words he didn't know Joseph so he
[37:24] said why do I have to respect these
[37:26] people this is our land they are Hebrews
[37:29] they come to our land on our turf hey
[37:32] we're going to do what we want to do
[37:33] with them so God put a spirit of hate
[37:35] upon them to hate the children of Israel
[37:38] and what another purpose what this was
[37:40] for causing them to hate the children of
[37:43] Israel to make the children of Israel
[37:45] cry
[37:50] cry out to God so that's why sometimes
[37:53] things happen in your life God permit
[37:55] things to happen to make you cry to make
[37:57] you pray to make you come closer to him
[37:59] God is I can restrain things also in
[38:03] your life to make this happen
[38:05] can we say praise the Lord now we see
[38:07] down here in the scripture amen
[38:10] I said Joseph died in all his brothers
[38:12] and all that generation that had to
[38:15] happen so God can set everything in
[38:18] motion the way that he wanted it to be
[38:20] amen now let's go to verse 8.
[38:23] am I going too fast
[38:26] we're excited but I can slow down
[38:30] amen verse 8 now that Rose of a new king
[38:34] over Egypt with new not Joseph and we
[38:37] know how to profit
[38:39] uh interprets this he said there had to
[38:42] be like he said just like a new king
[38:44] grew up come up that did not know Joseph
[38:46] he said that's why we got a new king now
[38:48] that don't know the freedom of religion
[38:51] see he's bringing all things in praying
[38:53] that you're our Third Exodus are you
[38:55] following me now just keep following me
[38:57] so now
[38:59] verse nine he said unto his people
[39:02] behold the people of the children of
[39:04] Israel are more and mightier than we he
[39:08] began to look around and realize it's a
[39:10] lot of these message Believers out here
[39:13] they're more than we they're mightier
[39:15] than we can we say man Heaven you know
[39:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ is mightier
[39:20] what makes us mightier is Christ in US
[39:23] Christ in his bride that makes us
[39:25] mightier and the devil knows that we are
[39:27] mightier
[39:28] to me say Amen don't you know the devil
[39:31] even though you are more than a
[39:32] conqueror
[39:33] the devil know that but do you know that
[39:37] you got to remember he's a bluff he's a
[39:39] deceiver like I was telling the brother
[39:41] yesterday after the devil sister
[39:43] deceiver to he believe in one God but he
[39:46] get people to believe in three
[39:49] now that's the deal before you right
[39:51] there
[39:52] can we say praise the Lord now so this
[39:55] had to happen they're mightier than we
[39:57] verse 10. he said come on let us deal
[40:01] wisely with them at least they multiply
[40:04] and it come to pass that when they're
[40:06] falling out any War they John also to
[40:10] our enemies and fight against us so let
[40:13] them let's get them up out of the land
[40:15] let's deal wisely with them see the
[40:18] devil is no different today he's dealing
[40:20] wisely
[40:21] can we say Amen he's dealing wisely I'ma
[40:24] tell you there's different kind of way
[40:25] how he's dealing wisely and Lord willing
[40:28] will try to get into some of these
[40:29] things so what happened in verse 11 he
[40:32] said therefore they said over them
[40:34] taskmasters to afflict them with their
[40:37] burdens and they built for ramuses
[40:39] Treasure cities pythons and Ramesses so
[40:42] now we're seeing pressure coming into
[40:44] this situation and they put taskmasters
[40:46] over there so I don't
[40:48] if the devil put pressure upon them in
[40:53] the first Exodus past message over them
[40:56] in the first Exodus he had to do it in
[40:58] the second and he also had to do it in
[41:00] the third that's why pressure and the
[41:03] things that we go through in this day
[41:04] shouldn't Shake us
[41:06] what it should do is mold you pressure
[41:09] should mold you not shake you
[41:12] can we say man because remember God he
[41:15] is the he is the Potter
[41:17] we are the clay
[41:19] can we say Amen but clay and pottery
[41:23] could never be formed without pressure
[41:25] amen the Potter puts the clay sticks it
[41:28] on the wheel the wheel spins he could
[41:30] water on his hand what did he do he get
[41:33] in the clay he squeezing when he
[41:35] squeezed the clay it starts shaping it
[41:37] and it started forming it amen so when
[41:39] you and I are going through things it's
[41:41] nothing but that great Potter got his
[41:43] hands on your life shaping you informing
[41:45] you to what he wants you to be not what
[41:48] you wanted to be but what he wants us to
[41:50] be
[41:50] amen so if pressure in the fresh Exodus
[41:53] pressure in the second Exodus it has to
[41:56] be the same characteristic and
[41:58] conditions and this Exodus
[42:00] and it ain't gonna get no lighter it's
[42:02] going to always be pressure but what
[42:03] pressure should do amen I can say make
[42:06] you better not worse
[42:09] praise the Lord amen verse 12.
[42:13] it says but the more they Afflicted them
[42:16] the more they multiply and grew and they
[42:20] would grieve because of the children of
[42:22] Israel this this chapter is just really
[42:25] my favorite one of my favorite chapters
[42:26] in the Bible I said God let me be like
[42:29] that the mom get Afflicted the more hard
[42:31] times I go through let me grow
[42:34] not decrease amen but let me grow Lord
[42:37] help me grow amen praise the Lord that's
[42:40] the way it's supposed to be and then we
[42:41] see they got offended because the
[42:44] children of Israel was growing so the
[42:46] devil said we need to change attacked it
[42:49] when this when Satan see any of us
[42:51] growing in our spiritual life he would
[42:54] change the tactic on your life to try to
[42:56] stop you from growing
[42:59] he don't care what he got to bring in
[43:01] he don't care who he has to use
[43:03] huh sometimes he can use children
[43:06] mama daddy friend sister
[43:10] he can use them
[43:12] amen
[43:14] he used Joseph's brother
[43:16] can we say Amen what brought David
[43:19] pressure his nephews
[43:21] his family pressure so there's different
[43:24] ways pressure can come but I'm so
[43:26] thankful that when things happen when I
[43:29] believe now brothers and sisters
[43:31] I watched myself out of everything
[43:33] that's happening going on I look for
[43:35] character in people
[43:38] I look how they respond back
[43:41] when something happened how do you
[43:42] respond back what is your reaction to an
[43:45] action
[43:46] can we say man do you believe we're in
[43:49] adoption time
[43:51] what entitles a boy to adoption what the
[43:54] prophet said his behavior
[43:56] his behavior entitles him to an adoption
[43:58] so myself I watched my behavior and I
[44:02] watch the behavior of others then it
[44:04] tells a lot where we're at
[44:07] hello
[44:09] praise the Lord and you're still you've
[44:11] been married 30 30 and 25 and 20 years
[44:14] and still throwing Sticks and Stones
[44:15] something wrong
[44:20] let me get a couple more amens or do I
[44:22] need to repeat that again
[44:25] you're supposed to grow not only in
[44:27] Christ but you're supposed to grow in
[44:28] your marriage
[44:29] [Music]
[44:30] and I see today is such an attack on
[44:33] marriages now
[44:35] around the messages
[44:37] so hard so much pressure but the thing
[44:40] of it is with that attack and stuff
[44:43] coming on people start thinking of
[44:44] divorce get rid of one another get
[44:46] separated from one another that's what
[44:48] the devil wants you to think
[44:50] it ain't time to think like that when
[44:52] you see the enemy trying to come in you
[44:54] they say wait a minute we need to we
[44:56] need to see where the devil where he's
[44:57] working at trying to destroy our
[44:59] marriage let's not attack one another
[45:01] let's go see where the evil one is lying
[45:04] and deal with him
[45:06] yes right right hello I'm just going to
[45:09] be blunt with you
[45:11] I'm just gonna be real with you it's
[45:13] hard for you to get brother Burley to
[45:15] believe that both of you got the Holy
[45:17] Ghost and you can't put your marriage in
[45:18] order
[45:21] something wrong
[45:24] if I'm born again my wife born again
[45:26] problems come up we should be able to
[45:28] get the word of God and solve that
[45:30] problem
[45:32] get rid of our selfishness our own
[45:35] personal feelings and let the word be
[45:37] king
[45:38] amen the Holy Ghost is a keeper he's not
[45:41] only a keeper of your soul he's a keeper
[45:44] of your marriage
[45:45] if you give it to him
[45:47] praise the Lord so you know people want
[45:50] to talk about all the other stuff so I'm
[45:52] sorry as a god son that's a perfect word
[45:54] so he can have some perfect Believers
[45:56] and now that word perfect means mature
[45:59] because this is maturing time amen if
[46:02] the elders can't get their lives
[46:04] together what are the young people going
[46:05] to look up to

[47:04] the Holy Ghost is a cable brothers and
[47:06] sisters

[47:09] put God out of it and then when things
[47:11] go wrong they want to put God in it no
[47:13] you put God in it first and when things
[47:15] go wrong still put God in it he'll bring
[47:18] you out of it
[47:19] [Applause]
[47:20] Lord have mercy
[47:22] all of these things pressures happening
[47:26] now it don't happen before
[47:29] amen let's go on a little farther they
[47:32] said verse 12 but the more they
[47:33] Afflicted them the more they multiplied
[47:35] and grew and they would grieved because
[47:37] of the children of Israel amen hey
[47:40] praise the Lord that ought to help every
[47:42] one of us out right now
[47:44] they would grieved with the children of
[47:46] Israel because the Lord had got
[47:48] Afflicted the more they grew amen the
[47:50] world this allowed to see an ace out to
[47:52] be grieved with you
[47:56] hello it ought to be grieved with you

[48:12] but I'm not going to compromise what I
[48:14] believe to be a friend with nobody
[48:18] praise the Lord
[48:23] let's keep going on here
[48:25] so we see here
[48:28] verse 13. and the Egyptians made the
[48:31] children of Israel to serve with rigor
[48:34] they make their lives bitter with heart
[48:37] bondage and Martyr and brick in all
[48:41] manners of service in the field all
[48:43] their service wherein they made them
[48:45] served with rigor can you see the
[48:47] effects of that today
[48:48] that's why all the pressure is hitting
[48:51] the bride you got to remember now
[48:54] the world got Precious too yes we got
[48:56] pressures too but the only difference
[48:58] you and I hasn't have an antidote
[49:02] we have someone we can go to to deal
[49:04] with depression we don't have to go to
[49:06] pills
[49:08] hello I'm not against pills but we don't
[49:11] have to go to peel I'm not against
[49:12] medical but what bothers me when people
[49:14] start relying on those sorts of things
[49:17] depression pill anti-depressant pills
[49:20] all these things here I want to give you
[49:22] some gospels that God can take care of
[49:24] all of those situations
[49:27] science want us to depend on them but I
[49:30] want to depend on God
[49:33] amen
[49:36] so with pressure today
[49:38] it is the enemy trying to break people
[49:40] down
[49:42] that's why I'm so thankful God gave us a
[49:44] message how to let off of depression
[49:47] know how to let It Off cast all your
[49:49] burdens given to the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:51] he cares for you
[49:53] amen
[49:55] he says
[49:57] and the king of Egypt spoke to the
[49:59] Hebrew midwives
[50:01] of which the name of the one was chakra
[50:03] in the name of the other poor he said
[50:05] when you do the office of a midwife to
[50:07] the Hebrews women see them upon the stew
[50:10] if it be a son then you shall kill him
[50:13] but if it be a daughter then shall she
[50:15] then she shall live now we know all of
[50:20] this repeated again I'm gonna read
[50:22] something to tell you what the prophet
[50:23] said
[50:25] he said notice this in the Third Exodus
[50:28] he said notice the king
[50:30] that new king that raised up that didn't
[50:34] know Joseph he said what was his first
[50:37] scheme
[50:39] to destroy the power of Israel notice he
[50:43] said what was his first scheme to
[50:45] destroy the power of Israel was with
[50:49] their children
[50:52] now did you hear what he said to
[50:54] describe the power of Israel was with
[50:57] their children
[50:59] can we say amen and so what do you want
[51:02] to do he wanted to kill the children to
[51:04] stop them from multiplying
[51:07] that's why we see the same thing in the
[51:09] second Exodus what did Herod do he tried
[51:12] to kill the children because whatever
[51:14] he's trying to do is find that seed
[51:16] right so if that happened in the first
[51:18] Exodus in the second Exodus why you
[51:21] think pressure now is on young people
[51:23] it's that same devil putting pressure on
[51:26] the young people why to try to destroy
[51:28] the effects of the message because the
[51:31] world says this is what the world says
[51:33] it's the statistics when children get 18
[51:36] years old they leave the church
[51:38] I think we need to defy that the only
[51:41] reason why they left the track because
[51:42] they never was born again I think that's
[51:44] why we need to leave our children to the
[51:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost when they get
[51:48] 18 they still serve God they need to
[51:50] serve God the very time God deal with
[51:52] their heart that's what they need to
[51:54] give it to him
[51:56] amen praise the Lord he's trying to
[52:00] destroy the Young Generation now
[52:04] amen that's what he's trying to do now
[52:06] how is he doing through music
[52:10] through movies
[52:12] through entertainment
[52:14] amen that's how he's doing it and save
[52:17] not just young people
[52:20] older ones too
[52:23] hello
[52:25] I was just asking a question recently I
[52:27] said listen they said what can we do
[52:30] turn the lights on for the lights could
[52:32] turn on to the young people
[52:34] ain't nothing you can do
[52:36] but live a life
[52:37] preach the gospel because there's only
[52:40] one man can turn on the light
[52:42] that's God
[52:45] can we say Amen you know I have to
[52:48] preach against this stuff when young
[52:49] people get it in their mind now
[52:52] it's just so much out here
[52:55] so much trouble
[52:57] so much distraction you know I get out
[52:59] of them conversations
[53:01] because you keep they keep talking like
[53:03] that they building the world
[53:05] and then all of a sudden you're like oh
[53:07] honey I understand
[53:09] yeah it's so hard for you I I don't talk
[53:11] like that I'm sorry
[53:14] I I can't I can't do that when they
[53:17] start doing it's so hard and stuff like
[53:19] that really that's what Jesus is good
[53:21] God is good
[53:23] hey man he's a deliverer he's a
[53:25] comforter he's a savior he's a sustainer
[53:28] of the soul I want to talk about Jesus
[53:30] pull them away from the natural thing
[53:32] bringing to spiritual things
[53:34] if you got the Holy Ghost nobody makes
[53:37] you turn on a tape
[53:40] nobody makes you come to church
[53:42] you do it because you want to
[53:45] can we say praise the Lord
[53:47] amen now there's two things I would
[53:50] never do you can ask my son he'll
[53:52] testify I will not wake somebody up to
[53:54] go to work and I will not wake them up
[53:57] to go to church
[53:58] [Music]
[54:00] if it ain't there it ain't there
[54:03] keep me say praise the Lord you can ask
[54:06] my son because many times he was working
[54:07] for him I leave him I go on the job I'll
[54:10] be working he called me an hour and a
[54:11] half later dude where you at duh my new
[54:14] job I'm on a job
[54:15] why you didn't wake me up for what
[54:19] you're looking for a company do they
[54:21] call you and wake you up no so you
[54:23] disrespecting your daddy that's just my
[54:25] daddy no that's my job that's not my
[54:27] hobby
[54:28] no I'm not going to wake you up it got
[54:31] to be in you
[54:33] nobody got to wake me up to come to
[54:35] church
[54:36] because I'm already up early expecting
[54:38] to go to church I'm not going to sleep
[54:40] to the last minute and say oh let me get
[54:42] a little bit more and then I'm maybe
[54:44] make it to church on time no I'm going
[54:45] to be in church on time because I
[54:47] prepared myself the day before before I
[54:49] go to church
[54:52] amen
[54:56] praise the Lord
[54:58] amen we get we living in a generation of
[55:01] time people can go to job sick but they
[55:03] can't come to church sick
[55:10] hello
[55:11] they can go to work sick but won't come
[55:13] to church sick
[55:16] I'd rather skip work sick and then come
[55:18] to church sick because come to church
[55:20] sick I can leave out with some healing
[55:24] Jesus excuses of the flesh
[55:27] we got to overcome these things by the
[55:29] grace of God
[55:30] put God first
[55:33] amen
[55:35] notice
[55:37] oh
[55:41] let me finish reading this he tried to
[55:43] destroy their children
[55:44] now listen close the same devil
[55:48] in a different form of kingship
[55:52] try to destroy God's only son
[55:55] get rid of the children
[55:57] first before they get a start the devil
[56:01] is real smart shrewd bird he knows how
[56:05] to hit the thing before it gets start he
[56:09] knows it the only thing that you can
[56:11] ever do to beat him I like how God's
[56:13] gonna give us a remedy here the only
[56:15] thing that you can ever do to beat him
[56:18] is to rely on Christ amen and humble
[56:22] yourself and let him lead you
[56:26] you'll never do it any other way your
[56:28] intellectual Powers will never do it
[56:30] you've got to believe it just rely on
[56:33] him he is the shepherd it ain't the
[56:36] Sheik's business to keep the wolf away
[56:40] I like that it's the shepherd's business
[56:43] but the Sheep must stay with the
[56:45] Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my
[56:49] safety zone is in Christ and Christ is
[56:52] the word that's the safety zone now you
[56:54] hope you know you catch that about the
[56:56] shepherd right
[56:58] in one part it is this pastor duty to
[57:03] keep the Sheep safe
[57:04] and mainly protecting who comes to the
[57:07] pulpit
[57:09] hello I didn't preach on certain things
[57:11] what the enemy tried to do but you know
[57:14] the chief Shepherd is Christ
[57:16] which is the word and the word is what
[57:19] keeps us safe the word of God inside of
[57:22] you is direct you to tell you what not
[57:24] to do where not to go what nothing to
[57:26] watch what not to see what not to hear
[57:28] the word will teach you those things
[57:31] that's what keeps us safe if the Holy
[57:33] Ghost Inside of us leading us into the
[57:35] right places where we can Shine the very
[57:37] appearance of evil
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] I believe in the power of the Holy
[57:42] Spirit
[57:43] I believe he's a keeper until the day of
[57:46] our Redemption I believe God can keep us
[57:48] do you believe that I believe with all
[57:51] of my heart
[57:52] amen wow
[57:54] almost all we ain't even got started
[57:59] don't worry I ain't gonna drag you to
[58:00] death
[58:06] we see here
[58:08] even in this first Exodus attack on the
[58:11] children we see it in the second exits
[58:13] now we see it in the third yeah it's
[58:15] pretty hard on the Young Generation
[58:18] but you got to show them the way
[58:20] that is in Christ
[58:23] amen
[58:25] they got to come the same way
[58:28] we did and I hate to say this but I got
[58:30] to say it
[58:31] the problem with the young people
[58:33] growing up in the message today
[58:35] since they growed up all around the
[58:37] world word and grown up in church they
[58:40] think they automatically born again
[58:41] right
[58:43] no exactly
[58:45] you got to meet him yourself personally
[58:47] you've got to meet him yourself
[58:51] the message did not come to produce
[58:53] religious sinners
[58:56] it come to produce Sons and Daughters of
[59:00] God and not grandchildren
[59:04] but Sons and Daughters of God
[59:08] amen that's young people there you're
[59:10] born again I go to so-and-so Church
[59:12] are you born again my dad is a deacon
[59:16] are you born again uh my dad is the
[59:19] pastor no no no no are you born again
[59:24] take me to your experience in the word
[59:26] show me where you're at
[59:28] can we say praise the Lord you got to
[59:30] meet that's why I said the most
[59:33] important of both all three Exodus is
[59:37] the Lamb
[59:39] amen because it made no difference well
[59:42] all of the characteristics all the
[59:44] things that happen through all of the
[59:46] Exodus is there never was the shed in
[59:48] the blood
[59:49] there was no Deliverance
[59:52] remember all of the Miracles that Moses
[59:55] did took place down in Egypt they were
[59:57] still in Egypt they did not be able to
[1:00:00] leave out to Exodus 12 when they had to
[1:00:02] be the sacrifice of a lamb
[1:00:04] so then in the second Exodus it had to
[1:00:06] be the lamb himself to lead them out
[1:00:09] and this Third Exodus the lamb had to
[1:00:12] come again
[1:00:13] can we say Amen in the form of a son of
[1:00:16] man Ministry it had to come again to
[1:00:19] take us back to the land
[1:00:21] because in this Exodus we were we grew
[1:00:24] up in denomination we thought church was
[1:00:25] the salvation
[1:00:27] but it's not it's the Christ it's Christ
[1:00:30] the lamb is salvation so God in this
[1:00:32] Third Exodus amen that's why amen
[1:00:35] Revelation 10 had to descend himself to
[1:00:37] bring his bride out of an exodus
[1:00:40] that's why first Thessalonians when he
[1:00:42] said the Lord himself shall descend with
[1:00:43] a shout to bring us to an exodus that's
[1:00:46] why Revelation 10 1 and verse
[1:00:48] Thessalonians they go together the
[1:00:50] descending of the Lord amen with a shout
[1:00:52] with a message to prepare us for an
[1:00:54] exodus it all works together so it has
[1:00:57] to be a lamb that's why Revelation 5
[1:00:59] John's they said behold the law you know
[1:01:01] the tribe of Judah but when John look
[1:01:03] he's seen the lamb it wasn't time for
[1:01:05] lion yet it was time for the lamb a
[1:01:08] bloody lamb to show I am the kids from
[1:01:10] the Redeemer I paid the price to bring
[1:01:12] my people to her inheritance
[1:01:15] Lord right amen can we say praise the
[1:01:18] Lord
[1:01:19] so we see
[1:01:20] in this Exodus
[1:01:22] Pharaoh changing his laws
[1:01:27] we see it in the second Exodus Herod
[1:01:30] made a law
[1:01:31] kill all of the children invest in him
[1:01:33] in Rhema you know them this designated
[1:01:36] places because Jeremiah said had quoted
[1:01:40] that that was going to happen see
[1:01:42] everything working according to God's
[1:01:44] program
[1:01:45] is that right laws change that's what
[1:01:47] today laws have to change
[1:01:51] they have to be the same pattern in this
[1:01:53] Third Exodus why do you think Obama
[1:01:55] passed that hate crime law
[1:01:57] there had to be God permitting laws to
[1:01:59] change it's going to constantly be like
[1:02:01] that laws are going to be changed to God
[1:02:03] guess what the scriptures to go against
[1:02:06] the word of God laws have to be changed
[1:02:08] to do that
[1:02:09] so there's no difference what we're
[1:02:11] seeing now today than what has already
[1:02:13] been done amen now even in the Exodus in
[1:02:18] the first Exodus you had murmurers and
[1:02:20] complainers
[1:02:24] in the second answer this you had
[1:02:25] murmurs and complainers
[1:02:27] you don't think they're gonna happen in
[1:02:28] the third
[1:02:30] yes
[1:02:32] there was David and Korra first Exodus
[1:02:36] can we say man second answer that was
[1:02:38] judas's carrier and the Pharisees
[1:02:41] so what you think gonna happen in the
[1:02:43] Third Exodus
[1:02:45] make Believers amongst message believers
[1:02:48] they have to be the exact same thing
[1:02:52] amen that's right let me read some of
[1:02:55] these conditions right quick
[1:02:57] in the first Exodus telling me to Exit
[1:02:59] the 16.
[1:03:17] um let's go to
[1:03:20] Exodus 16 verse 2.
[1:03:24] it says in the whole congregation
[1:03:27] of the children of Israel murmured
[1:03:30] against Moses and Aaron in the
[1:03:33] wilderness did not lay Mama against
[1:03:36] Jesus
[1:03:39] huh yeah so what makes you think they
[1:03:41] ain't going to marmor now
[1:03:43] what do you think all this is happening
[1:03:45] with a mama against the prophet
[1:03:48] it's the same spirit that comes from the
[1:03:50] first two Exodus
[1:03:51] murmuring against the prophet oh he told
[1:03:54] a lie he prophesied a lie he said
[1:03:56] something he's confused all this
[1:03:58] nonsense
[1:03:59] it has to be
[1:04:02] but let me go ahead and jump ahead of
[1:04:04] myself you never seen Joshua and Caleb
[1:04:06] complain
[1:04:10] can we say Amen Jocelyn Caleb didn't
[1:04:12] complain because really what they were
[1:04:15] looking at as a promise
[1:04:17] not looking at a man's fault looking at
[1:04:19] the promise that he spoke out of his
[1:04:21] mouth that's what Joshua and Caleb
[1:04:23] looked at you don't think they seen
[1:04:25] Moses problems
[1:04:27] sure they did
[1:04:29] have you seen Moses lose his temper
[1:04:32] I could see Joshua and Caleb Mosley
[1:04:34] leaves in his temper and power of
[1:04:35] dramatizing all children in Israel look
[1:04:38] what he did look what he did and Joshua
[1:04:41] Kayla said Lord bless you sir
[1:04:44] he going through a lot there's a lot of
[1:04:46] pressure on him Lord bless him sir
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:50] hello we have a servant today told a lie
[1:04:53] but brother told a lie do we say oh he
[1:04:56] got to be a false prophet no we said oh
[1:04:59] God thank you for the honesty of that
[1:05:01] Prophet a lot of pressure was over him
[1:05:02] on them taxes and he just lost it for a
[1:05:05] little moment thank God for an honest
[1:05:07] man thank you Lord I don't complain
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:11] but the moment complaining look at it
[1:05:12] look at look at that that's not it's an
[1:05:14] honest man
[1:05:15] the biggest problem people missed out on
[1:05:18] the message I believe they never let
[1:05:19] brother Berlin be a human
[1:05:23] Elijah a man of light precious passions
[1:05:27] just like you and me
[1:05:29] think about this here's a man God take
[1:05:32] him into different dimensions different
[1:05:34] Realms seeing the Monograms seeing
[1:05:37] people lie past present future
[1:05:40] look at all that pressure on the man and
[1:05:42] then he come out of service the next day
[1:05:44] out there cutting grass
[1:05:47] people rocking the road hello
[1:05:51] a human
[1:05:53] but yeah the prophet
[1:05:57] you know when somebody want to put all
[1:05:59] the prophet mistakes out ask them to
[1:06:01] talk about theirs
[1:06:05] you don't have no mistakes yeah yeah I
[1:06:07] got some mistakes I said well well he
[1:06:09] without saying let him catch the first
[1:06:10] stone then
[1:06:14] but I'm not here to help brother Branham
[1:06:18] let me tell you friend I refuse to go
[1:06:21] around the world trying to vindicate
[1:06:23] brother Brennan
[1:06:25] I refuse to do that
[1:06:27] I don't have to do that God did that
[1:06:31] I just preached the message so I don't
[1:06:34] get into the ministerial fights I don't
[1:06:37] get into that kind of stuff
[1:06:38] God took care of the Prophet because you
[1:06:40] got to remember whatever you say or do
[1:06:42] Ain't Gonna Change where he's at
[1:06:45] so let them talk
[1:06:47] that's what they've done to Moses that's
[1:06:49] what they've done to Jesus it had to
[1:06:51] happen today but Joshua and Caleb Lord
[1:06:54] bless your servant
[1:07:00] verse 3.
[1:07:02] and the children Israel is saying this
[1:07:03] to them
[1:07:04] what to God
[1:07:06] we had died by the hand of the Lord in
[1:07:10] the land of Egypt see their own
[1:07:11] Revelation is messed up
[1:07:14] they think God's trying to kill him
[1:07:17] in other words they're saying that he
[1:07:18] could have just killed us an Egypt why
[1:07:20] are you going to bring the light here to
[1:07:21] kill him just let us stand easy and then
[1:07:23] we'll just die there
[1:07:25] God ain't trying to kill them that's
[1:07:27] what the spirit put around a lot of
[1:07:29] people in this message they think the
[1:07:31] mess is trying to kill him
[1:07:34] no it's not he's trying to save you
[1:07:37] but look at the message I can't do this
[1:07:39] I can't wear this I can't hear this I
[1:07:42] can't go there that's why they look I
[1:07:43] can't I can't I can't I can't that's a
[1:07:46] sign they said you're killing me
[1:07:48] do not let me live my life I want to
[1:07:50] live my life go right on live your life
[1:07:52] go right on but what is that Gonna Leave
[1:07:55] You living your life mean you die but
[1:07:58] losing your life for the Lord means you
[1:08:00] live
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:07] but listen what they said what's your
[1:08:09] God we have died by the hand of the Lord
[1:08:11] in the land of Egypt when we sat by the
[1:08:14] flesh pot
[1:08:15] when we did eat bread to the full
[1:08:19] notice they're saying yeah he would
[1:08:22] could have killed us in Egypt but at
[1:08:24] least we was eating good
[1:08:26] feeling good and happy then just let
[1:08:30] them kill us
[1:08:31] Same Spirit Satan let's go back out in
[1:08:34] the world
[1:08:35] enjoy yourself
[1:08:37] live your life
[1:08:39] do what you want to do fulfill your
[1:08:41] pleasures what's wrong with that do it
[1:08:45] but Satan don't tell you
[1:08:47] if you never be right with God you're
[1:08:48] going straight to hell
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:54] that's the hard word to say to people
[1:08:56] today you go into hell you feel like oh
[1:08:58] that's so harsh you shouldn't say things
[1:09:00] like that why not
[1:09:03] why not it's in the Bible
[1:09:05] you either gonna go to heaven or you're
[1:09:07] gonna go to hell you're gonna go one
[1:09:08] another and either which way you go you
[1:09:10] fight your way you're gonna have to
[1:09:11] fight
[1:09:12] you got to fight your way to heaven you
[1:09:14] got to fight your way to Hell either way
[1:09:15] it's a fight
[1:09:17] I want to fight for what's right
[1:09:21] we don't got so soft
[1:09:24] oh brother prophesied to be smooth
[1:09:26] painless no sir no
[1:09:30] I don't seem too much or came too far I
[1:09:32] know what God is doing I know what the
[1:09:34] power of God is I know how God can keep
[1:09:36] people and I know what the prophecy is
[1:09:38] how this bride supposed to be a
[1:09:40] conquering bride not a bride defeated I
[1:09:43] know that and I believe it
[1:09:47] yes sir
[1:09:49] for you have brought us forth into this
[1:09:51] wilderness
[1:09:53] to kill this whole assembly
[1:09:55] with Hunger they hold Revelation when
[1:09:59] messed up why because pressure hits them
[1:10:02] when they sing the signs and the
[1:10:04] Miracles they were just happy as they
[1:10:06] could be this is a Revival this is it
[1:10:09] but now when the pressures of Life begin
[1:10:11] to come now the enemy attacking the mind
[1:10:14] and who they blaming Moses
[1:10:17] in the Lord same characteristics today
[1:10:22] my my my
[1:10:25] all right let's keep going could I have
[1:10:27] a few more minutes
[1:10:29] right
[1:10:31] then he says verse 4 then said the Lord
[1:10:33] unto Moses behold I will reign bread
[1:10:35] from heaven for you and the people shall
[1:10:38] go out and gather a certain rate every
[1:10:40] day that I may prove them whether they
[1:10:42] would walk in my law or no so they
[1:10:45] actually they were hungry
[1:10:47] God said I feed him
[1:10:50] it seems like
[1:10:52] when God fed them manna that should have
[1:10:55] solved the problem
[1:10:58] but it didn't
[1:10:59] see there are some people you can't you
[1:11:02] can't satisfy them
[1:11:04] you give it to them give them things
[1:11:07] give it give it it's just their
[1:11:08] satisfaction
[1:11:09] the only Satisfaction come is the rest
[1:11:12] of the Soul
[1:11:13] because when he got rest in the soul
[1:11:14] you'll be content with the things God
[1:11:16] give you
[1:11:17] Until then people are going to want want
[1:11:19] one see that's why you got girls and
[1:11:22] boys jump to one relationship to another
[1:11:24] that's trying to find happiness
[1:11:26] but they're looking at it the wrong way
[1:11:28] if they get that happiness first in
[1:11:30] Jesus Christ he'll give them the
[1:11:32] companion that he want to give
[1:11:36] hello
[1:11:37] you know these days around the message
[1:11:39] you preach courtship people get mad at
[1:11:42] you
[1:11:43] they really for the priest dating
[1:11:47] dating if you really look at it has no
[1:11:50] intentions for marriage
[1:11:53] dated in the jump from one partner to
[1:11:55] another to test the fields
[1:11:58] courtship you got one person on your
[1:12:00] mind
[1:12:01] one
[1:12:02] and praying Lord is just it
[1:12:05] but dating oh you play the field
[1:12:09] I know this ain't popular but I see this
[1:12:11] stuff special in Youth Camp all the time
[1:12:13] you can see Mr pretty boy think he's the
[1:12:15] only one on the camp and every girl
[1:12:17] looking at it
[1:12:20] and then you get girls get it in her
[1:12:21] mind like it's just only one boy on the
[1:12:23] camp
[1:12:24] all of them locked on that one because
[1:12:26] he's supposed to be what you call
[1:12:28] popular popular for what
[1:12:33] popular for what I'll tell you what he's
[1:12:36] popular for he's popular for sinning
[1:12:39] sneaky things doing things wrong
[1:12:42] undercover he's popular for that and
[1:12:45] he's also popular that when he can be in
[1:12:48] church he can Shine Like An Angel
[1:12:52] so yeah he's popular
[1:12:55] hello girl's no different
[1:12:59] see these things need to be exposed
[1:13:01] ungodliness things like that need to be
[1:13:04] exposed God don't want you to be that
[1:13:06] way God wants your heart
[1:13:09] give it to him first everything else
[1:13:12] lines up the way that he wants it
[1:13:18] divorce around the message
[1:13:20] you would think that would never be
[1:13:22] but it is
[1:13:24] in this journey because you got to
[1:13:26] remember also in the first Exodus it was
[1:13:30] a mixed multitude
[1:13:31] second Exodus mixed multitude Third
[1:13:34] Exodus mixed multitude
[1:13:39] you would think
[1:13:41] they would have been satisfied God gave
[1:13:43] them bread
[1:13:45] right now let's go to Numbers Chapter
[1:13:47] 21.
[1:13:58] numbers 21 verse 5.
[1:14:01] it said the people spake against God
[1:14:05] and against Moses
[1:14:07] wow
[1:14:09] the very one that delivered them
[1:14:12] now they speak against them
[1:14:16] wherefore how you brought us out of
[1:14:19] Egypt
[1:14:20] to die in the wilderness say the same
[1:14:23] thing again
[1:14:25] for there is no bread but yet it was
[1:14:29] there is no bread neither is there any
[1:14:32] water
[1:14:33] I was so low this light bread so that
[1:14:38] was bread
[1:14:39] but they wanted another bread
[1:14:42] that's our soul loath this light bread
[1:14:45] they got tired of the matter
[1:14:47] it's the same thing today
[1:14:49] I am tired
[1:14:51] first you rejoice when you come into the
[1:14:54] message
[1:14:54] But as time goes by I am tired of you
[1:14:58] quoting brother Brown
[1:15:00] I'm tired of hearing it quote something
[1:15:02] there give me some Dr Dobson give me
[1:15:04] some TD Jake that man of God too we're
[1:15:06] tired of hearing this we're tired of
[1:15:07] this message
[1:15:11] Same Spirit
[1:15:14] first Exodus second Exodus third exit
[1:15:17] Jesus tried to tell them Moses didn't
[1:15:20] give you that bread my father give you
[1:15:22] that bread I am the true bread that come
[1:15:24] down from heaven they didn't want that
[1:15:25] bread
[1:15:27] but there was a few electric on it Thou
[1:15:29] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:15:31] Jesus said what are you going to go to
[1:15:32] where can we go
[1:15:34] if you leave this word of the hour tell
[1:15:37] me where you're going I'll tell you
[1:15:39] where you're going you're going down
[1:15:42] because God ain't bringing nothing else
[1:15:43] this is it
[1:15:45] God don't the devil don't release hell
[1:15:47] everything that he got and God will
[1:15:49] release having everything that he got it
[1:15:51] ain't no more
[1:15:53] we just have to take what God has given
[1:15:55] us and whack that devil down with it
[1:15:58] praise God
[1:16:01] tired of this bread give us some more
[1:16:03] bread people want more different they
[1:16:04] want to eat on something different
[1:16:06] so they go to entertainment
[1:16:08] that goes through movies that goes
[1:16:10] through all these kind of things they'll
[1:16:12] go through that
[1:16:13] let me tell you something friends I
[1:16:15] believe exactly what the prophet said
[1:16:17] the biggest problem we've done when we
[1:16:19] took the altar out of the house
[1:16:23] now
[1:16:25] dad come from home from work
[1:16:27] as soon as you get home
[1:16:29] eat a little dinner
[1:16:32] get on this phone
[1:16:34] he's on YouTube
[1:16:36] Mama on Facebook
[1:16:39] children on games
[1:16:44] then when everybody don't hurt their
[1:16:46] fool
[1:16:48] after four hours
[1:16:51] then they come good night good night
[1:16:54] make sure you pray
[1:16:59] that's it
[1:17:01] the devil just infiltrating the home
[1:17:03] right
[1:17:06] and you wonder what's wrong with the
[1:17:07] Young Generation
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:14] praise one
[1:17:16] he's killing family structure
[1:17:18] that's what's happening today
[1:17:21] when young people here
[1:17:23] that's what liquor going on in that
[1:17:24] family that husband wife when they hear
[1:17:26] that stuff it pollutes their mind
[1:17:28] let the devil say
[1:17:30] and this message right and people
[1:17:32] getting divorced and stuff like that and
[1:17:34] this message supposed to be right giving
[1:17:35] people young people mind yeah is it
[1:17:38] right let me tell you something the
[1:17:40] message is right
[1:17:41] people are wrong
[1:17:45] but the devil got to attack the message
[1:17:48] he had to attack the message to get
[1:17:50] people to lose confidence in that
[1:17:52] because he knows I can get it to lose
[1:17:54] confidence in the word I got him
[1:17:57] that's why I don't put my faith and my
[1:17:59] hope in people
[1:18:00] I put it in Jesus Christ
[1:18:03] that's where my faith that's what my
[1:18:04] hope is that is in the word of God
[1:18:07] bless you I I can't finish it
[1:18:11] there's no way
[1:18:13] there's just really no way
[1:18:15] I got a whole
[1:18:18] slew of things here but there's no way I
[1:18:20] could finish
[1:18:27] how many of you give me five more
[1:18:28] minutes
[1:18:29] Hold Up Hold Your Hand up
[1:18:32] 10 15 20 25 30 30. according to what I'm
[1:18:36] seeing I got at least three more hours
[1:18:44] praise the Lord
[1:18:46] my brothers and sisters I'm just coming
[1:18:49] bringing it down really
[1:18:51] but this Third Exodus the
[1:18:54] characteristics and the conditions if we
[1:18:57] just understand the first and the second
[1:18:59] we'll understand the Third
[1:19:02] we can even go with the prophet's life
[1:19:06] and bring in the Third Exodus what did
[1:19:09] it start with Moses being a proper child
[1:19:13] can we say Amen Jesus Christ himself
[1:19:16] started God come down started as a baby
[1:19:19] you can go right to the prophet life
[1:19:21] with that visitation the light came in
[1:19:23] at his birth you can go all of that God
[1:19:25] donate the program
[1:19:27] for a Third Exodus they're all the same
[1:19:30] when you catch the pattern
[1:19:32] so there have to be complaint against
[1:19:33] the message today
[1:19:35] is not the Joshua and Caleb that's
[1:19:37] complaining
[1:19:38] it's to make Believers let's complaining
[1:19:40] the unbeliever that's complaining not
[1:19:42] Joshua and Caleb
[1:19:44] because they believed the promise that's
[1:19:46] what the Bride come in we hear a lot of
[1:19:48] things I'm a one preacher there'll be
[1:19:49] honest with you I cannot explain
[1:19:52] everything brother Branham did and said
[1:19:56] I can't
[1:19:58] and I ain't gonna try to
[1:20:01] I'm not
[1:20:02] I just say I don't know
[1:20:06] Peter you've been in this message 35
[1:20:08] years you don't know I said let me
[1:20:10] repeat that one more time to you I don't
[1:20:12] know
[1:20:15] that don't make me no bigger no smaller
[1:20:17] I just don't know but I said I know the
[1:20:20] person that does know
[1:20:22] and he'll let me know what I need to
[1:20:24] know what I need to know until then I
[1:20:27] ain't worrying about it
[1:20:29] that's the way it's supposed to be hear
[1:20:32] me say praise the Lord so all this thing
[1:20:34] pressure on the children impersonators
[1:20:37] we have to have all that happening today
[1:20:39] now I ain't going to do that I'll
[1:20:42] finally get into something else
[1:20:43] happening around the message but there's
[1:20:46] things that you probably already see
[1:20:47] yourself but you know all this stuff has
[1:20:50] to be fanaticism has to be clicks have
[1:20:52] to be groups have to be all this have to
[1:20:55] be
[1:20:56] it's a shame whenever we get to a place
[1:20:59] to cataract category categorize
[1:21:01] Ministries or this group is different
[1:21:03] from this group this ministry difficult
[1:21:05] I think every Ministry that is called of
[1:21:08] God born again should be respected
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:13] whether they preach simple preach High
[1:21:16] it don't matter
[1:21:18] lonely that is a god gift call
[1:21:21] it should be respected
[1:21:23] can we say praise the Lord you know you
[1:21:26] know when you come to church with the
[1:21:28] right spirit and right expectation
[1:21:31] you can get a preacher can get right up
[1:21:34] here and preach to you God bless you
[1:21:36] saints of God
[1:21:37] I want to go ahead and take my subject
[1:21:40] and preaching the word of life here and
[1:21:43] they can start reading the quotes
[1:21:45] lining up scriptures and just voice
[1:21:47] don't even go high
[1:21:49] and the power of God can come down
[1:21:54] come down yeah right because that
[1:21:56] minister is in his place
[1:21:58] his position not trying to be like
[1:22:01] somebody else
[1:22:04] then you can get somebody here preach
[1:22:06] Lively
[1:22:07] power God can come down
[1:22:11] different minister
[1:22:12] same power
[1:22:17] but when you put categories
[1:22:20] when you yourself don't selected your
[1:22:22] favorite minister
[1:22:25] you ain't gonna listen to nobody else
[1:22:29] it ain't the Menace of fraud sometimes
[1:22:31] the people fall they got they selected
[1:22:32] ones
[1:22:36] I don't want to hear that brother uh
[1:22:40] he don't shout enough what
[1:22:44] brother I don't have a lot of them
[1:22:45] shouting ain't saying nothing
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:48] anybody's you shout what are you saying
[1:22:51] are you preaching what God gave you is
[1:22:54] it coming from your heart do you see it
[1:22:55] yourself
[1:22:57] these categories now
[1:23:02] I'll tell you one person dude and I wish
[1:23:06] he would I well I can't calm him down
[1:23:07] Michael Teague
[1:23:10] 82 years old I'd be nervous for him
[1:23:13] when he preached he thinks he's 40.
[1:23:17] he gets up down all night
[1:23:21] no he himself but when he get through
[1:23:23] everybody
[1:23:28] but no
[1:23:30] the power of God falls upon him he stays
[1:23:32] in his space
[1:23:34] then I can see another one just simple
[1:23:36] as can be with deep Revelation power
[1:23:39] guard just fall I just say praise God
[1:23:44] I've seen ministers young ministers they
[1:23:46] could preach something
[1:23:48] preach you feel the presence of God and
[1:23:50] then they can even say something wrong
[1:23:53] but the integrity
[1:23:56] in their heart was right
[1:24:00] that's the type of preacher
[1:24:02] when he's over I talk to him say brother
[1:24:04] I want to talk to you something about
[1:24:05] something you said you might want to
[1:24:07] look at it this way that's not
[1:24:08] condemning them he just preached the
[1:24:10] error
[1:24:11] but now when you get one got a little
[1:24:14] Doctrine
[1:24:16] that he think is right but it can't be
[1:24:19] proven through the message of scripture
[1:24:21] will he want to push it to the
[1:24:22] congregation then the type I take care
[1:24:25] of before they leave the pulpit
[1:24:29] because if you're going to be that bold
[1:24:30] to throw it out I'm going to be that
[1:24:32] bold to expose you
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:37] but the categories we got now friends it
[1:24:40] shouldn't be that way every God gift
[1:24:43] Ministry should be respected
[1:24:46] because we go back to the message
[1:24:47] respect if you don't respect the man
[1:24:49] office he can't even do nothing for you
[1:24:51] anyway
[1:24:53] that's just the bottom line you can't do
[1:24:55] nothing for you anyway
[1:24:57] praise the Lord can we get the Lord a
[1:24:59] hand
[1:25:01] God bless you
[1:25:05] musicians could come
[1:25:09] I really appreciate you continue to keep
[1:25:11] praying for me
[1:25:13] uh we still pressing on and
[1:25:16] back and forth to these doctors don't
[1:25:17] drove me crazy
[1:25:20] but you got to do it
[1:25:22] you know once a month they stick that
[1:25:23] needle right down in the eye to inject
[1:25:26] medicines behind it I have to do it but
[1:25:28] they talking about six months but I'm
[1:25:30] still believing that it don't go that
[1:25:32] long I just still keep believing and uh
[1:25:35] I Just Gotta Eat Right do right and keep
[1:25:38] myself right not come out right
[1:25:41] praise the Lord but you know that that
[1:25:43] sweet stuff is killed it's a killer
[1:25:46] sugar sweetly kills you
[1:25:49] kills you sweetly
[1:25:51] can we say Amen but you know but I'm
[1:25:54] thankful I pray that you just caught the
[1:25:57] thought the conditions characteristics
[1:26:00] trust me we didn't even really get
[1:26:03] started there's so many things when you
[1:26:05] study the Book of Numbers right before
[1:26:08] the Deuteronomy you just find every
[1:26:10] story every characteristic every problem
[1:26:12] every situation you'll see the same
[1:26:15] thing today in this Third Exodus and it
[1:26:18] have to be that way that's why I don't
[1:26:20] get discouraged I said well I've seen
[1:26:22] that before the scripture talk oh I see
[1:26:24] I see where it's going I see where it's
[1:26:25] going God had put it that way you and I
[1:26:28] can judge everything
[1:26:30] by the scriptures
[1:26:32] amen let's buy our hearts
[1:26:34] father we thank you for your word this
[1:26:36] evening
[1:26:37] and we trust and pray father things that
[1:26:39] were said
[1:26:40] to bring people closer to you because
[1:26:42] that's our hearts desire to see you
[1:26:44] glorified to see you lifted up
[1:26:47] and oh God I pray that you will forgive
[1:26:48] us if anything was said with the wrong
[1:26:50] motive wrong objective wrong Spirit
[1:26:53] forgive us for our ignorance Lord
[1:26:55] because you know the Integrity of our
[1:26:57] hearts is to see people break free
[1:27:00] delivered and out of bondage that's our
[1:27:03] hearts desire so father we just commit
[1:27:05] everything to you and to thy hands in
[1:27:08] the name of Jesus Christ we give you the
[1:27:10] glory and the church says amen and I
[1:27:14] tell you
[1:27:15] one of the key things
[1:27:19] in the first Exodus
[1:27:21] they thought
[1:27:23] Moses message it was a burden
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:28] brought us all here to die you've done
[1:27:30] this
[1:27:31] then when it comes to Jesus Christ
[1:27:34] the same thing happened when he said
[1:27:36] except you drink the blood eat the Flesh
[1:27:37] of the son of man they begin to say what
[1:27:40] kind of said did this man is crazy
[1:27:42] what are you trying to do who you think
[1:27:44] you are you think you're God she they
[1:27:46] think Jesus was trying to bring them
[1:27:48] into bondage they said we we free we
[1:27:50] choose to labor him we free
[1:27:52] how can you say whom the sun set free is
[1:27:54] free indeed see they think first X and
[1:27:57] second thank you bondage so the same
[1:27:59] spirit it's in the Third Exodus they
[1:28:02] take the message it's bondage
[1:28:04] but Paul said the Commandments of God
[1:28:07] are not Grievous that's why when people
[1:28:10] leave the words of Life the first thing
[1:28:12] they want to post
[1:28:14] is on free
[1:28:17] and now I feel the love of God
[1:28:20] I can express myself
[1:28:23] no they're not free they love freedom
[1:28:26] and went to bondage
[1:28:28] but the deception of the enemy thank you
[1:28:31] friends
[1:28:32] God brought them out of Egypt from
[1:28:35] bondage
[1:28:36] from the whip of the slave and brought
[1:28:39] him out
[1:28:40] and now they're going to say you brought
[1:28:42] us out here to die
[1:28:45] this message oh yeah I will admit the
[1:28:48] message is designed for you to die
[1:28:52] oh yeah die from yourself
[1:28:55] because when you die from yourself then
[1:28:57] Christ can live so yeah it want to kill
[1:28:59] you they want to kill you not your soul
[1:29:02] but you yourself that's what it wants to
[1:29:04] kill
[1:29:06] he that seek to save his life shall lose
[1:29:08] it but he didn't lose his life shall
[1:29:11] save it for my sake shall save it amen I
[1:29:14] say to you Shalom God bless you
