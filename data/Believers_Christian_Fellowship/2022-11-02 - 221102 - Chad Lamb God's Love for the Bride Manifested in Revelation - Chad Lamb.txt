through these vessels of clay and on that you might gather us home Lord and that great glorious day we love you and we thank you we give you preeminence now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you while we're standing if we could turn in our Bibles to the gospel of Mark chapter 12. amen I'm just doing a remind everybody that we'll have communion service this Sunday for a second service and also that it's the end of daylight savings time so we want to remember Saturday night to push the clocks back amen let's look at Mark chapter 12. verse 29 I'd like to take for a subject tonight God's love for the bride manifested in Revelation but I'm going to start by finishing up something that I didn't finish up on Sunday so this will be just a little uh a capping off of Sunday Mark 12 29 and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these man God bless you as you take your seeds God bless you brother Emmanuel sister Mimi it's good to have you back amen it's good to have you in the service um so we looked at this Sunday and I just wanted to take just a few minutes and cap this off there was a piece that I wanted to add in before we moved from that but the the a scribe comes and asks Jesus what is the greatest commandment or the first commandment and he tells him to love the Lord Our God the the greatest commandment is the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is likened to the first love thy neighbor as thyself and so we know we've looked at the scripture and the whole law hangs on these two Commandments here let's go to Romans chapter 13. and read this scripture Romans 13. both of these scriptures we read on Sunday Romans 13. and eight oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not still Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so the the Commandments that God had given they could be summed up in two things or they could be fulfilled with two actions one is to love the Lord thy God with all thy strength with all thy heart with all thy mind with everything and to love thy neighbor as thyself with those two actions we can fulfill the whole commandment of God and and so we know that when God called Israel unto themselves in Sinai he came down to make a covenant with his people in his Covenant he spoke with his own voice upon the mountain and when he spoke they were supposed to come up unto him but we know they ran away instead but the voice spoke the Commandments the ten what we call the Ten Commandments which is the God's covenant with Israel and in in in Deuteronomy if we could just turn to Deuteronomy chapter 5 I just want to lay this in because I don't want to leave this out Deuteronomy chapter 5. Moses and Deuteronomy is rehearsing the things that the children of Israel have been through and the things that have happened and he comes in in Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 2 and he says the Lord Our God made a covenant with us in Horeb so he goes all the way back this ties all the way back to Exodus 19. so he's discussing the same the same thing the same event when the Lord God made a covenant with us in horeham the Lord may not this Covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mountain they were supposed to go up into the mountain to be United with God but when they saw the fire and they heard the voice and the trumpet sounded long and God spoke to them face to face Moses said they couldn't endure it and they ran away and that's when they spoke to Moses that you go whatever he says come back and now he says you were afraid but this is that that was injected in there but when the Lord God spoke to you face to face out of the mountain in the midst of fire down at verse 5 saying so we drop out what's in parentheses saying I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou shalt have none of their gods before me Thou shalt not make any Graven image so we go right into what is commonly known as the Ten Commandments that's what God spoke to them on Horeb out of the fire when the when the trumpet sounded long when God spoke to them face to face this is his Covenant with Israel do this and we will be United forever we get down to the bottom of this let's go to verse 22. these words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick Darkness with a great voice and he added no more this was all this was going to be the full Covenant between God and his people these kept this is the Covenant amen that to have no other gods before me to make no graven image to not take the name of the Lord in vain to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy to honor your father and your mother to not kill and to not commit adultery do not steal do not bearish false witness and do not covet anything of thy neighbors that was the Covenant if you do that amen when I speak come and Unite with me this is the Covenant that will bring us together amen and God added no more that was all of it but when the people refuse to come to him in his voice amen they ran away and sent Moses and says whatever he tells you will do he already told the Covenant but they could not endure amen God's speaking to them directly and and this Covenant that God was going to make so now God gives Moses a book of law and that book of law was how that you would administer all of these things it was it was an Administration with guidelines and with punishment it was if you borrow your neighbor's uh mule and it dies and this is how you restore it and if you and if you find your neighbor's animal lost this is how you keep it this is how you restore it and if if you and if you have this issue this is how you deal with it and this is the punishment for not doing this and now they're because now they're sets up a whole ritual and ceremony to to coming to God to worship God in the beginning that was not part of the Covenant but but because they refused amen now God now shows them how difficult it's going to be to do this your way amen you do it my way this is all I'm asking you to do but now you want a code of rules now you want something that you can do not to have to face God direct but have an intermediary to have Moses in between now you're going to have a book of law that is going to guide you on how to be good to your neighbor and how to do all of these things and how to approach unto God and with it will come punishments that wasn't the original Covenant but if we look at the original Covenant and the greatest two Commandments that Jesus speaks of you'll find that the two Commandments that brother that Jesus speaks of completely 100 percent fulfill the Covenant of God because the first four things that God listened the Covenant is have no other God before me make no graven image don't take the name of the Lord in vain remember the Sabbath and keep it holy so if you will love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your strength with all your soul with all your mind you will fulfill those first four then the next six in the Covenant is honor your father and mother do not kill do not commit adultery do not steal do not bear false witness and do not covet if you will love your neighbor as yourself you will fulfill the last six the whole Covenant of God is kept in loving God and loving your neighbor that's what God wanted from the beginning that's what God was asking his people to do that's that's why Jesus says this is the first and the next is likened to the and all the law was fulfilled in this love thy neighbor as thyself amen put God first and love your neighbor as yourself and that's what God wanted from his people amen he didn't initially desire a book of law that came at the rejection of Christ the rejection of God speaking to them face to face and we know it had to be that way because this could the the law had to come as a school Master to bring them into Christ so that they could understand how much they needed a Grace Covenant But but so now we find out that when Jesus said was spot on Amen that is the Fulfillment of the Covenant and it's the same thing today amen if we will love the Lord Our God with all of our heart with all of our strength with all of our mind with all of our soul and love our neighbor as ourselves we will be doing what he's asking us to do and if we do that there doesn't need to be ceremony there doesn't need to be ritual there doesn't need to be law and there doesn't need to be punishment we just give give him our all and love our neighbor as ourselves and so that was God's covenant and the Fulfillment of God's covenant is love because God is love now I want to take a look in Genesis chapter 39. that was the peace that I didn't want to leave off from Sunday I wanted to include that and include that understanding what that means when what Jesus said and what Paul teaches now if we go to Genesis 39 in verse 7 this is the story of Joseph Joseph is now Steward and Potiphar's house and we know this is when he's going to be tempted by Potiphar's wife and in Genesis 39 verse 7 it says and it came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master what if not what is it what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand there is none greater in his house than I neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee because Thou Art his wife how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God I love what Joseph says he begins to reason with the woman and begins to tell her uh his position but at the end of the day he says how can I do this great wickedness and sin against God and and that is what made Joseph so special and that's what made so many of the characters in The Bible so unique is that they were god-conscious they were God conscious about their actions they were god-conscious about their deeds amen that that it wasn't just I don't want to get caught amen with Pharaoh I don't want to get caught in this deed I don't want to lose my position as a steward it wasn't just I don't want the consequences for the action it says how can I sin against God Amen it was conscious not of of the negative things about his own person or the negative consequences to the action but it was a love for God that kept him from from Potiphar's wife it wasn't just a fear of consequences but it was a love of God and that's what I I love so much about Joseph is he was conscious of God he was aware of God and he was living for God and and as the Bride of Jesus Christ we should be nothing less amen it is we don't serve God out of fear of punishment that's that's not what God is looking for in this day he's not looking for servants he's looking for a bride he's not looking for people that were cower under his hand he's looking for somebody that will come to his voice [Music] and and he wants somebody that'll come amen because they love him that will obey there's so many people that will serve religious services and religious duties because they want to go to heaven and there's a fear if we don't fulfill the religious duties we'll not go to heaven that that's a denominational idea that is not what God once brought into this bride age he wants something completely different he wants to bring us back amen where Israel was when he was going to give him the Covenant now this bride has come back to God speaking his own voice amen giving his own her heart his own word to his bride and he wants her to come unto him not to get to heaven amen but because she loves him let's look at Acts chapter 13. I want to be in my life more God conscience I don't want to say I don't want to do that because uh there could be legal consequences I don't want to do that because uh uh I could have retribution or somebody could be angry with me or somebody could be upset of course we don't want to make anybody upset and we don't want to break any laws and we don't want to pay any fine I mean that's the reality but I want something motivating me that's deeper than that how can I sin against God Amen if this is a violation of God's word if God told me to give what is uh give Caesar what is Caesar's then I want to give Caesar what is Caesar's because I don't want to commit sin against God I don't want to go against his word I don't want to go against his desire I want to be pleasing to him in all things and so I give unto Caesar what is Caesar's because of him amen I I do what I do because of him not because I'm afraid of what people think or I'm afraid of what might happen amen those are all realities in the life we live in but the greatest reality of all is if no one will ever know if no one will ever see and there'll never be any repercussions I want to do it because God is gone and I love God and I do not want to sin against God that's the bride he's looking for him Acts Chapter 13 Verse 21. it says and afterward they desired a king and God gave unto them Saul the son of kiss a man of the tribe of Benjamin by the space of 40 years and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will amen how would you like for God to speak of you and say this is a man after mine own heart and David says he writes in Psalms 119 he says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee he he hid the word in his heart because he didn't want to sin against God [Music] but we know that that David failed and we picked this up in second Samuel let's turn there together II Samuel we know the issue with Bathsheba and Uriah and the failure and adultery of David and then Nathan comes to expose David's sin in second Samuel chapter 12 verse 13 after the sin is exposed this is David's response II Samuel 12 and 13. and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die David didn't say I have sinned against Uriah I have sinned against joab because he made joab do the Dirty Work I have sinned against Bathsheba all those things are true he sinned against Bathsheba he sinned against his people he sinned against joab he sinned against Uriah but What mattered most to David is I have sinned against the Lord that's what grieved him the most and that's what hurt him the most and that's What mattered the most and when David was able to repent and acknowledge his sin against the Lord as the Lord had put away his sin and so there's unique people in the Bible that are after God's Own Heart are are god-conscious and are motivated by a love for God we see so many other people in the Bible in the world that are motivated by so many other things but they're God's children were motivated by a love for God and a desire to please God we we spoke Sunday about Abraham in Isaiah 41 8 it says but thou Israel are my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend we read that scripture on Sunday and talked about how wonderful it would be for God to call you his friend how wonderful to be if God would say Chad is my friend and especially if he's talking to somebody else you know and you overhear it and God says Chad is my friend all of a sudden something happens on the inside but that's how he spoke about Abraham Abraham God says my friend and so Abraham is a unique individual and and in Genesis 18 I'm not going to turn there but I'm just going to quote it to you Genesis 18 17 after God comes and visits Abraham on the planes of memory they take a walk and they stroll together and it says and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation in all the nations of Earth shall be blessed in him he goes on to say and I know him and he'll raise his children after him and and so God says shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do why will God not hide from Abraham he gave a list of qualities because I know he'll be a great mighty nation why will he be in the great mighty nation because God said he would be a great and mighty nation but he can't hide from Abraham the thing that'll do because Abraham is his friend and when God looked at when Jesus talked to his disciples in John 12 well John 15 will turn to this one John 15. John 15 and 13. in the Gospel of John chapter 15 verse 13 Jesus says greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I tell you not I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you Jesus said I won't call you servants because the servant doesn't know what his master is doing I will call you friend because I've told you everything now now Elohim in a body of flesh is walking with his friend Abraham and he's getting ready to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and he says shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I'll do he can't hide from Abraham because Abraham's his friend amen and and so God is manifesting his his friendship with Abraham through Revelation because he'll not hide from his friend the thing that he is about to do man let's turn to Daniel chapter 9. so it's as if the Friendship of God to Abraham and the friendship of God to the disciples amen would would be confirmed by a revelation by their their lack of servanthood because they're not in ignorance anymore because there's a there's a deeper relationship than that of servant and master the relationship is going into the Realms of Revelation where I now begin to share with you what I'm about to do I now begin to share with you what's in my heart and as he's bringing this Revelation and this understanding the relationship is different now than servant now it's a relationship a friend in Daniel chapter 9. look at verse 21. he says yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandment came forth and I came to show thee Thou Art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision he says now I've come to give you understanding I I Daniel I've come forth to give these skill and understanding of diverse at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandment came forth and I came to show thee for thou art greatly beloved I came to give you the answer to your prayer because you're greatly beloved I came to give you the Revelation you're seeking for because you're greatly beloved you're not the servant you're the greatly beloved amen and because you're the greatly beloved I'm coming to bring you this Revelation amen I've come to give you skill and understanding I was sent to you to show you because you're greatly greatly beloved therefore therefore because you're greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision so God Amen whom he loves he Reveals His mystery to you amen who's greatly beloved of the Lord is the one who's when he's earnestly seeking in prayer in the right time according to the word when he sees the time approaching he begins to pray and make supplication and as soon as he dies God dispatches Gabriel to go and bring him a message and he says I've come to give you skill and understanding I've come to show you the thing you're asking for because Thou Art greatly beloved now therefore hear and understand amen it came not because he was despised not because he was a servant not because he was rejected but because he was greatly beloved so the sign of being greatly beloved for Daniel was the revelation of the mystery let's look at chapter 10 verse 11. chapter 10 verse 11 and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee and my now sin and when he had spoken these words this word unto me I stood trembling So Daniel is a man greatly beloved so now understand the words verse 18. Then There came again and touched me one light the appearance of a man and he strengthened me and said oh man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he had spoken unto me I was strengthened and said let my Lord speak for thou has strengthened me Daniel received the Revelation because he was greatly beloved let's go to Luke chapter 1. chapter 1 verse 26. and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and casted her mind what men are salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus so when it was time to bring a revelation of the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 7 the angel came to the Virgin Mary and says behold Thou Art highly favored amen Thou Art highly favored thou has found favor with God Amen what did what did Mary do to obtain this favor what did Daniel do to be greatly beloved amen Daniel was greatly beloved but what did he do all that we know that he was doing was praying and serving God and obeying God but he was greatly belonged Mary we have we have no we have no knowledge of her actions of her Deeds of what she did to earn this favor with God because she didn't do anything to earn this favor with God when God spoke the word through Isaiah's lips a virgin shall conceive God knew that it was Mary amen God knew who it would be she was favored from before the foundation of the world she was highly favored before before the foundation of the world and because she was highly favored because she was greatly beloved because it was the right time and season she was the right kind of person the angel came to her and revealed the mystery to her that now is the time of the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 7. amen it didn't go to the servants it didn't go to those who who were not highly favored but it came to her amen and so we know that this is God's method let's look at Ephesians chapter 1. Ephesians chapter 1. and verse 3. it says in Ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved he have made us we have not made ourselves but he hath made us accepted this word accepted is the exact same word that the angel spoke to Mary when he said thou are highly favored to make accepted and to be highly favored is the same thing she was highly favored we've been made accepted amen when were we made accepted we were accepted before the foundation were when we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and now he has made us accepted in the Beloved the word beloved is agape it means love God's love we've been accepted in the love of God when we were accepted it says now let's go back and read the verse 4 again according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love God loved us before amen God loved us before and he hath made us highly favored he's made us accepted amen the the to put his grace upon us because he loves us and because he loves us like he loved Daniel because he loves us like he loves Mary when we in our turn come to the right place to the right season with the right desire amen he will also come with an angel messenger and bring us a revelation amen because that's what he gives to the highly favored to the to the greatly beloved amen not to the servant the servant doesn't know what his master's doing amen and the friend has been told all that the father's doing amen the the greatly beloved of God Amen is receiving the revelation of the hour amen because they are highly favored let's go to Second Thessalonians chapter 2. II Thessalonians 2 and 13. but we are bound to give thanks all we to God for you Brethren beloved to the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of spirit and belief of the truth so from the beginning from the beginning of what from the beginning of the beginning from the beginning he has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth where unto he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ so they were chosen to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth and we are chosen from before the foundation of the world to Salvation through the same means through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so if it's going to take belief of the truth for salvation then God is going to have to bring truth and he's going to have to bring a revelation of that truth because from the beginning he chose us unto salvation through sanctification the spirit which he must Supply and belief of the truth and he's the one who has the truth so he holds the elements of our Salvation sanctification by his spirit and belief of his truth which is his word amen and so so we have to have the spirit and we have to have his truth but we have to believe his truth like the Pharisees and Sadducees they had the truth because the truth was contained in the Scrolls they had the scroll so potentially they had the truth but because they had no Revelation on what Moses wrote they could not worship Him in spirit and in truth amen they did not have they held the truth but they did not have the truth amen because the truth was not revealed to them because the truth is revealed to the greatly Beloved the highly favored [Music] in the Samaritan Church age of the church age book The Prophet says that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3 and he quotes Malachi chapter 1 verse 1 to 3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I I have loved you saith the Lord yet we say where in hast thou loved us was not he saw Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountain in his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth Amen brother man quotes that out of uh II Thessalonians so now we we find out that the the evidence of God's love they misunderstood God's love because they were trying to equate God's love by whether Goods or bad things happened to them and so because bad things happen to the nation of Israel they were saying wherein hast thou loved us we're not seeing evidence of your love and and God points them to evidence and the evidence was have not I chosen Jacob and have not I hated Esau that's the evidence that's the evidence of my love so the evidence of my love is an election that I chose you in him before the foundation of the world that you might be perfect Before Me In Love I loved you before and I chose you before that's the evidence of God's love that's why we cannot judge God's love based off answered prayers based off healings based off signs based off whether good things are difficult things happen in our life because we know that God allows good things and difficult things for character moding also for a display of his character amen that God sometimes God must crush a rose to get the fragrance out and sometimes God must let Trials come in our life to get the fragrance of Jesus Christ the perfume to go out that it can have an effect on other people so we cannot judge God's love based off how many good things or how many bad things are happening in my life his love was Secure before the foundation of the world when he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that is the evidence of God's love the fact that we were chosen unto salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth that's a key scripture hold on to that and don't forget that then he goes a little further in the smyrnan church age he's still speaking of the same subject so the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters the signs of his love and approval his approval of any us any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and listen this is the part I want to focus on and manifested that he did love us for he brought us unto himself and gave us of a spirit placing us as Sons so how do we know he love us because he chose us before the foundation of the world how do we know he loves us because he said so that's how we know he loves us but how does he manifest that love to us amen he manifests that love and listen we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons so what is the manifestation of this elective love the manifestation is he drew us to himself and he gave us of his Spirit placing us the sons amen because we have been we have we have been chosen amen before unto salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so how does he manifest that love he manifests that love by by giving us everything we ask for and making only Miracles show up in our life and never letting a trial come our way no he manifests that elective Love by drawing us unto himself and giving us of his spirit whether good things happen or bad things happen he manifest his elective Love by drawing us unto himself let's go to Jeremiah 31. I'd like to just go on records saying that the devil is a liar and he constantly uses the same lies and the same tactics to try to trip up God's children but the word of God is forever true amen and if we have to to believe the devil's lie that because we're in a cycle of negative or negative things are happening in our life or it seems like God didn't answer our prayer or anything like that that somehow is equated to the amount of love that God has for us then we will have to Discount the Apostle Paul is being loved by God because when you start to read about the life of the Apostle Paul amen he was rejected of his brother and he was chased from City to City he was stoned how many times he was left for dead he was Shipwrecked he spent a night and a day in the Deep he has a whole rap list of negative things that happened to him he was forsaken by his friends demons turned his back on him how many he he he had a he had a a a long-term uh long-standing illness that he was never healed of so if we have to take that measuring stick to measure then we have to measure Paul as not being very loved but I would say Paul was greatly beloved of the Lord because God came to him himself amen and called him by his own voice and by the pillar of fire who was Jesus Christ himself speaking to Paul calling Paul unto himself amen what what was that that was the manifestation of his elective love when he came on the scene and he called the Apostle Paul unto himself took him into Arabia and revealed himself to him for three and a half years that was the evidence that was the manifestation of his love his love was Secure before the foundation of the world he was loved because it was elective love God's love was never changing but God manifest that love when he met him on the road to Damascus and say Paul Saul Saul why does thou persecute against why did why does thou kick against the bricks why do you persecute me said who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute and he began to draw Saul to himself and he and he gave Saul his spirit and he began to reveal to him the word that was the manifestation of his elective life no matter how many rejections Paul went through how many stonings how many beatings how many stripes how many Shipwrecked how many a night and day in the Deep how many times he was hungry how many times he was naked how many times he was in prison how many times he locked and had need how many times he was rejected by those who used to walk with him no matter what Demas said about him none of that mattered because God already manifested this elective love to Paul because he drew Paul to himself and he gave Paul of his spirit and he revealed himself to Paul oh if we could just be so sure of his love at the manifestation of his love to us because we didn't draw ourselves to this message we had no power Amen to come God found us and he drew us to himself by his own work he gave us of his own spirit amen and he revealed his own word to us and there was something within us that he placed there before the foundation of the world that could recognize the truth of what he's speaking because we were ordained before to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so that when he would begin to reveal the truth there was a receptor inside that could receive that truth because it was necessary for our salvation and that's the manifestation of his elective love now in Jeremiah 31 verse 3. it says the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee I have love thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn Thee the Everlasting Love was the motivation behind the drawing John 6 44 says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him it's impossible when when we look at John 3 16. says for God so loved the world that's also God's love you know God's love is not just limited to his elect God loved the world and he sent his only begotten son but God also has an elective love for the bride so he is a general love and he has an elective love so God's love was sent into the world but his elective love was expressed through Peter when he says who do men say that I am he says Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed the thing to you his General love sent Christ into the world his elective love gave a revelation to Peter to recognize who this was his General love amen he says in Matthew 5 let's turn to Matthew 5. let's just read this together Matthew chapter 5. verse 44. it says but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust he's instructing you to love the way your father loves love your enemy because God loves his but this is not the same as his elective love this is his General love and in his love he allows the son to continue to come up he takes care of people he feeds and nourishes multitudes of people how many people were healed amen when Jesus was on Earth how many people were fed when the multitudes were fed with the fish and the bread amen how many people were recipients of a general love but how many were recipients of the manifestation of elective love amen so God tells us to have his love to love our enemy to love our neighbor to love mankind to do good to love amen that's part of the the second commandment that's likened to the first commandment to have love but the expression of God's elective love is when God draws you to himself and gives you of his spirit amen this is his elective love from before the foundation of the world so he sees that that God he allows the rain to fall on the good and the bad on the just and the unjust he he provides crops he provides food he provides everything he keeps the world uh sustained amen this is God's love amen but his elective love does more than feed you and clothe you and make sure you're okay and feed you and he feeds the multitudes and heal you when there's a Healing Ministry on the earth amen his elective love does more than that amen his General love will will feed in water the just and the unjust his General love will heal all those that will come in respect to him and respect his word can be healed how many hundreds of thousands possibly more than that were healed in the ministry of of the prophet of God Amen they were healed that's God's General love amen how many were fed the day Jesus broke the bread how many were cared for by my by Christian works and Ministries all over the world Amen but that's God's General love that's not the manifestation of his elective love God allows uh um times of Peace God allows the the seasons to continue God allows the Earth to continue to move in on its axis he keeps gravity in place he keeps all the laws of physics moving so that mankind can prosper and have health and God Amen it was God who allowed man to discover penicillin it was God who allowed man to have wisdom to to have devices for healing and have doctors and all these other things that was the goodness of God that was the General love of God for Humanity so just because God provides for you food and water and shelter and healing and all these things that that's what the general love of God will provide for anybody but the elective love of God is Manifest in a very specific way amen the elected love of God is Manifest in him drawing you to himself amen so that you can walk in the light as he is in the light he's not drawing you to a dispensation he's not drawing you to where he was but the but the but the manifestation of the elective love of God Is He will draw you to where he is amen and he is always the word made manifest in the day and age that you live and that's the elective love of God will draw you to himself which is the message of the hour amen in the Feast of trumpets the prophet says now how how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen her husband is the revealed word he's the one that's drawing her to him he's drawing he's drawing by his elective love he's manifesting that love by drawing his bride to himself and he has to draw her to where he is currently and he's the revealed word and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed Prophet says notice secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you he said look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the Believers God had a great Secret and Daniel's day and that secret was tied up in Jeremiah 70 weeks and God was not going to take his great mystery secret of Daniel 70 weeks and he was not going to put it out there in the heart of all mankind like he does when he sends the rain when he allows the wheat to come up when he allows the sun to continue to shine amen when he allows peace and prosperity to move when he brings up righteous governments and topples unrighteous governments that's his General Life he's not going to take the secret of Jeremiah 70 weeks and he's not going to put it out there like rain over the wheat and the terrors but what he will do is he will put it in the heart of the greatly beloved and that's why the angel came to Daniel to put it in the heart it was greatly beloved he said now what was once God's great Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the Believers that is the body of Christ what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world has now made manifest think of it oh I'm sure we don't get it I can't see it the way I ought to and I'm sure you don't see but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to his church what was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her why is he Whispering secrets to her because she's highly favored because she's greatly beloved he doesn't whisper these secrets amen he doesn't whisper these secrets generally he whispers these secrets specifically oh it may be preached generally but when it's preached generally it's preached as a mystery and goes over the top of the head but it's revealed as a whispering secrets into the heart of his elect amen you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and and love you and everything you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church see he's letting her know the secrets just the secrets not the flirters I mean his wife all right now look by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace oh the grace of God that Grace is his love that Grace is his elective love amen and having the Revelation the secret made known to them by his love it only comes to the recipients of his elective love amen God does not make the revelation of the secret known in the general way of his General goodness to all mankind but this is God's secret of his Revelation that he only makes known to the greatly beloved to the highly favored again in Christ as the mystery of God revealed he says but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride this mystery this threefold purpose that he had in the back part of his mind to gain preeminence in the man which he did in Christ Jesus preeminence in a body which he is doing now through the bride and a restoration Back to Eden this great mystery is revealed only as he promised to the bride in future home he says now you say well look at this priest wasn't he a son of God it proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what did he say I believe the Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that he had been back before him and it's the same thing today see I know that's strong but it's the truth there was the word as spoken exactly for that day and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholar he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination only the predestined it will only be the one who does it only can be why because he was they were chosen in him before that they might be perfect in his life they're the recipients of his love they're the object of his love they're the greatly beloved of the lord they're the only ones that predestinate is the only ones that can receive the revelation of the word this priest thought he was the son of God thought he was studying the word thought he was believing the word and he was to a certain extent he was believing a a certain level of the word a certain layer to the word of God because the word of God is written in layers you can read a layer and that layer is fine that layer is true it's every bit the truth you can catch the history of the of the Jewish church you can find out amen when they came out of Exodus how they came out of Exodus what happened when they went into the promised land where they failed God and it's every bit the truth and it's all profitable and beneficial but you can go another layer deeper amen which the prophet of God could take us deeper and he could show us that that first Exodus was the type of the second Nexus which is the type of the Third Exodus amen and then then Peter can pick that up and Paul can pick that up and say these things that went they went through is for our example amen so you can go layer by layer and the priest on a certain level amen had the word of God Amen but he did not have that word of God that was being made manifest in his day because that word of God that was being made manifest in his day was Jesus Christ the son of God dwelling in flesh right in front of him and he had the paper but he didn't have the word amen and he didn't have representation of predestination so there was no way no matter how no matter what many how many miracles he saw no matter how much he heard Jesus preach and even if he got to sit in on one of the explanations that the disciples got it would never register because he didn't have representation of predestination yeah but the woman at the well had a representation of predestination and though she didn't have understanding she may have been illiterate she didn't have the same teaching as the priest she didn't have the word memorized she had something that the priest could never have amen and when Jesus came to her what was he doing he was drawing her unto himself amen and and what he did is he drew her unto himself he gave her the word for the day and when she received the word for the day amen she was quickened amen and when she was quick and amen that seed that was within her that was a representation of predestination came alive and it proved who she was and that she was part of the elective love of God Amen that she was from the beginning chosen in him what was the evidence not the general goodness of Jesus Christ to heal multitudes and to feed multitudes amen and to speak words amen but the specific revelation nation of the present day word to her as an individual was the was the manifestation of his elective love praise be to God how many people went to a campaign and saw the Miracles and saw the healings and maybe it was healed themselves and ate of the bread and fish and saw the miracle and went home rejoicing skipping singing maybe even writing songs about what they had seen and so happy that day that did not make them part of the elective love that made him recipients of God's General love but what made this woman a recipient of God's elective love what was the manifestation that she was part of that special love and then she was that special group of the Beloved the greatly beloved and the highly favored was because he came to her and Drew her to himself with the word and because she had representation of predestination she could believe it Ephesians 5. let's look at Ephesians 5 together in verse 25 Ephesians 5 and 25. husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word We Know by the message that he is washing his bride by the word by the bleeding word the word that was made flash that died on Calvary that bled for us that same word is present today and that same word it still has fresh blood life the life of Christ flowing from that word amen and it's here to cleanse a bride amen how did it get here he sent it here amen how did you hear about it though Millions have heard about it amen millions and billions never heard about it how was it that you heard about it they're none of the multitudes that heard about it why is it that you received it when others walked away amen because God had an elective love for his elect and that elect of love he was going to manifest did he did he ever not love you no he always loved you were you ever not greatly beloved you were always greatly beloved what did you do to become greatly beloved nothing because when you were a thought in his mind you were greatly beloved amen before you were ever manifest outside the mind of God you were greatly beloved and you were highly favored you didn't earn it you didn't move yourself into it you didn't do anything to make yourself in this position he put you in that position so how do you know that you're in that position because it's free from any of your Works amen it's free from your Deeds it's it's done and decided without your accomplishments without your abilities so how do you know that you're in that group because you can't do something to get there you can't fulfill something keep something obey something to put yourself in that position how do you know you're there you know by this because he drew you to himself amen and he is the Living Word Allah live today at the message of the hour and he came to you and he drew you to himself it wasn't you finding him he found you it wasn't you choosing him he chose you he told his disciples you've not chosen me but I've chosen you and you've never chose God God chose you it wasn't amen it wasn't just your lucky day when you happen to know somebody at work or find a message book or hear somebody or grow up in a home that knew the message that wasn't you just Struck it lucky you just got you were in the right place at the right time by chance God placed you there amen because he's going to draw you to himself amen and when he draws you to himself he's going to give you of his spirit so that you can be saved through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth then if that's what you were chosen to before the foundation of the world he had to come and give you the truth and you had to be able to receive that truth amen so how do I know I'm part of the greatly beloved because he's drawn me to himself he's given me of his spirit he's given me his word and I believe it I believe it with no effort I believe it without trying I believe it when it was inconvenient to believe it I believe that on days that it created hardship for me to believe it I believed it anyways when it caused separation I believed it amen when it caused me to change my conduct I believe it when it brought conviction in my life I believed it when it separated me from family I believed it how did I believe it it wasn't intellectually that I believed it it was a sea Gene of God on the inside a representation of predestination that when he brought the word there was something in me that would receive that word he brought me to himself and I came to him and now I know I'm part of the Beloved he's made me accepted in the Beloved I'm one of the highly favored I'm the one who's greatly beloved and if the wheels fall off the bus tomorrow and everything falls apart nothing has changed in the mind of God because he's already manifest me as a part of his elective love I don't need good things to happen to know that I'm part of his love I love it when good things happen I enjoy the blessings of the Lord and he loves to bless his children that's absolutely the truth but if we put all of our all of our faith in who we are based on what's happening in our lives amen we're going to miss the real manifestation of his elective love and that's him drawing you to himself revealing his word to you and you have a capacity to believe it and him giving you of his spirit that is what proves that you were chosen in him from the beginning Amen Let The Devil's lies fall to the ground they mean nothing in the face of the word he's washing her and the Water by the word we're not even washing ourselves we're just standing where the word is and receiving the word and letting the word wash us purifieth make us clean we're not cleansing ourselves by conducts and deeds the word is cleansing us and when we receive the word the life of the word comes in us when the life of the word comes unto us the word lives itself out of us it's a purification it's a force it has a life it has Spirit the word and the spirit are the same thing you receive the word you receive the spirit then that Spirit of the word lives the word out of you and purifies your life it's not what we do it's what we yield ourselves to it's not a ladder that we climb it's a spout that we stay under it's not what we attain it's what we receive so what we yield to and surrender to he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word verse 27 that he might present it to himself that he might present it to himself a glorious Church I'm trying to be a glorious Church forget trying to be a glorious church he will present to himself a glorious Church how will he do it by the washing of the water of the bleeding word in this day by the word that he sent he when God wanted to unite with the bride first he sent a word to purify the bride so he could Unite with the bride he did it all all we have to do is receive it amen amen and you can't receive it without a receiver you can't give yourself a receiver that was chosen before the foundation in the world that's part of his elective life that he might present to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy and without blemish he wanted to bring us to himself in love this is a work of his elective love this is the desire of his heart our desire is to surrender our motivation our desire our love to him is to surrender into him and let him do his work to stay in the word to receive the word to believe his word to yield to the word to obey his word and he wants the church to be without wrinkle or without spot or without blemish so he sent a word that can produce that kind of church amen and that he's administering this word himself and he's accomplishing this work himself he's not asking us to do anything but surrender to yield to give him preeminence and when he asked preeminence he can finish this work he says so want men to love their wives as their own bodies when Jesus is loving his bride he is loving his own body when Jesus is purifying his bride he is purifying his own body amen this work he's doing Amen to purify to cleanse his own body because this is the body of Jesus Christ so this is a great mystery but I speak of Christ in the church Paul says let's go to Colossians chapter 1. as we finish this evening Colossians chapter 1. and verse 26. even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now was made manifest to his Saints who is it made manifest to the recipients of his elective lives to the greatly beloved to the highly favored they're the only ones that this is this Revelation is Manifest to to whom to who to that group to whom to the Saints to the greatly beloved to the highly favored to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory why is it that serpent seed makes sense to you when you tell it to multitudes and they're confused and they go back and read the Bible and they say it's fruit when they when they say that Eve said I've gotten a man from the Lord and and all of these things but when you go back and read it it's so plain why is it serpent seed make sense to you why is it water baptism in Jesus Christ's name is the only scriptural baptism why is it that you can see that Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 1-7 are the same thing and Luke 17 30 is a son of man revealing the son of man and that William Branham was the Fulfillment of those scriptures how come you can see that who taught you what intellectual book did you read amen you can get it intellectual but that won't work that's not what it is it's when he reveals it to you personally and you know that's the Fulfillment of that scripture you know that's the way it is you know there's no other option if it wasn't for serpent seed this is a confusing book amen because it explains everything else in the Bible why is it you know it's not denomination it's not church that he's after but it's the individual connected to Christ that he's after in this day how come you know that how come you see that and multitudes don't and how come you know that this is the day that he's coming in Bride form that if you want to find Christ you must find him in the formation of the Bride amen because the wheat seed has come back to life in feminine form how come you can see that because he's drawn you to himself and he's given you of his Spirit he's revealed the word to you because you were part of his elective love from before the foundation of the world no matter how many people hear that only a few believe it no matter how many sit in Bible studies have it explained sit under preaching for years only a few can ever grasp that because they had to be part of that elected group from before the foundation of the world if you want security this is the greatest security I know of if you're looking for evidence that you're part of God's plan that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world Amen you're going to have it manifest to you by faith what faith faith in the word that God has placed in me something that knows that this is every bit the truth he has drawn me he has given his Spirit to me he has revealed his word to me it's not a makeup for me it's not a pretend for me it's not intellectual for me it's a reality for me and if that becomes a reality for you the next day amen when something bad happens in your life it doesn't change God's love for you it doesn't change your position in Christ nothing has changed this is just something God is going to do amen God's love his elective love is manifested as he draws us to himself God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son whosoever should believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life he came not to condemn the world through him but those who believe not are condemned already so he sent his world but his love sent his son but his elective love gave a revelation to just a few of who that son was his General love sent the son into the world but his elective love quickened the Revelation in the heart of Peter his elected love quickened the Revelation in the heart of Paul his elected love quickened the Revelation in the heart of his disciples that they would recognize this is the Son of God this is the Messiah this his elective love his General love sent Christ into the world his elective love quickened the woman in Samaria at a well talking to a man in flesh God's love sinner Healing Ministry throughout the world in the end time sparking healing revivals and bringing people back to Faith In God's word that was God's General love but a specific love whispered love secrets in the ear of his bride revealed the hidden Mystery and if you've received that revelation then you should be the happiest person on the planet you should be so secure in God's love because God doesn't whisper these secrets to nobody else not the flirters not the churches not the friends he only Whispers these secrets to his sweetheart the one that he chose before the foundation of the world and the message possessing the Gate of the enemy after the trial to see the Bible is a supernatural book it's written so that it's hid from the school's Theologian how many knows that Jesus thanked God he said I thank thee father thou has hid this from the wise and prude and revealed it unto babes such as would learn it's a book of love when the love of God comes into the heart then you fall in love with God then he reveals himself the Bible meaning how does he reveal himself he gives you the Bible meaning the true interpretation of the word I'm going to read that again it's a book of love it's not a book of love just because it says God is love it's not a love letter just because you can read and say that God is love that's not what makes it a love letter what makes it a love letter is when you understand what he means by what he says it's a book of love when the love of God comes into the heart then you fall in love with God then he reveals himself the Bible meaning the interpretation of the Bible is God himself interpreting his promises but the Bible it's written between the lines when when brother Benham talked about the love letter that his wife would write to him anybody else could read the letter but not catch the meaning because her meaning was between the lines and the Bible is a book of love but you can't get the love story if you only read the surface level of the Bible if you just read the surface level of the Bible you've missed the story of Rahab you've missed you've missed the story of Ruth you've missed Esther you've you've missed it all amen because we've just read we've just read his the history of the church we've just read things that God had done but we didn't catch the story within the story we didn't catch the mystery that was within the pyramid the the unwritten word the mystery secret that was inside the pyramid amen it was written all around the outside and brother Benham went around interpreting the outside of that pyramid giving the correct interpretation where the teachings of the Bible were all scattered he brought it back together and interpreted it but then he peeled off the captive show there's been a secret inside this all the time and the secret is that Jesus Christ wants to be formed as a bride as well male and female there's been a secret into this you can read the love story and never catch the Love Story amen It's Not Your Love Letter unless you can read the mystery between the lines and that only comes to the greatly beloved that only comes to the highly favored the one who was like the woman at the well like Mary is a teenage girl like the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee like the publican like so many multitudes of others that were unlearned unscriptured illiterate ignorant living filthy lives but they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world they were part of his elective love and would never be separated from that love so in due time he would send a messenger to each one amen and that messenger would say hell thou highly favored there would be something inside of each one of God's elected seed that would say that ain't nothing but the truth that's the manifestation of God's elective love the next time your prayers not answered remember Paul's wasn't answered either he wanted to be delivered of his sickness the next time that that that seems like you're in a cycle of negative and everything spiraling downhill just remember it's happened to Saints before and it was never proof for evidence of God's displeasure with them and never removed them from God's elective love sometimes we need to go back to our calling amen sometimes we need to go back to our Awakening and say I didn't awaken myself he woke me up I didn't call myself I didn't give myself the ability to receive this word that came from him he drew me he called me he gave me his Spirit he revealed his word to me why why did he do that for me when multitudes haven't got it why me because I was part of him from before the foundation of the world and chosen him and I'm part of his elective love and he chose Jacob and hated Esau before they ever had a chance to do good or evil it's not my good or evil it's his choice that's moving in my life and now my love for him surrenders all obeys him loves him serves him gives up my mind my past my thoughts my ambitions and just says Lord being unto me according to your word and God bless you let's all stand this evening I hope you understand what I was trying to say we should be the happiest people that ever we should be so secure in God's love and that the devil shouldn't be able to make us insecure by trials and tribulations and troubles and dark cloudy skies and Troublesome times and uh tumultuous water that shouldn't bring us trouble amen because God's already proven his love to us and already declared that we are accepted in the Beloved we should be secure in his love regardless of what happens you can't stop your flesh from getting tossed about but there should be an anchor in the soul amen you can't stop your mind from reeling amen but there should be a reality on the inside that when it gets rough there's a check that comes and says wait a minute he called me he chose me
