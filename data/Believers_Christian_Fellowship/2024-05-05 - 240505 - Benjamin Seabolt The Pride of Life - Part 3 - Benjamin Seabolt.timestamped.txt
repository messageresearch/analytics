[14:31] let me be
[14:34] used oh
[14:37] Lord
[14:41] by let's just pray
[14:44] together precious Lord Jesus
[14:48] we are truly here today for that purpose
[14:52] Lord not to be seen or to be heard but
[14:56] to come and to cast ourselves upon that
[15:00] stone that was heun out of the mountains
[15:02] without
[15:03] hands father that we could be
[15:08] broken but then put back together by you
[15:11] Lord father for we certainly do not want
[15:14] the other option to be ground in the
[15:16] powder and to be blown away as
[15:20] worthless chaff Lord but we want to
[15:24] Humble
[15:25] ourselves in your
[15:27] presence that that you can build us Lord
[15:30] and make us what you would have us be we
[15:33] just thank you for this
[15:36] opportunity father we know this is your
[15:39] ordained way by the foolishness of
[15:41] preaching that your kingdom would be
[15:43] established here on this Earth and in
[15:45] the hearts of your people so we just
[15:48] yield to that purpose although we are
[15:51] fully conscience of our inability and
[15:54] our
[15:56] unworthiness but you chose man as your
[15:59] agent Lord and we're just
[16:02] trusting that you will do what only you
[16:05] can do through man Lord and to come and
[16:07] to take your word and to feed your
[16:10] people we just commit ourselves to you
[16:12] both speaker and hearer and we just ask
[16:15] that you would come and do what you have
[16:18] predestinated the purpose of this
[16:20] service to
[16:22] accomplish we ask this in the name of
[16:24] the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[16:28] this morning morning certainly good to
[16:30] be with you if you have your Bibles
[16:33] we're going to go to the book of
[16:37] Philippians just like to continue on
[16:41] this thought of the pride of
[16:48] life Philippians chapter 2
[17:05] beginning with verse
[17:09] three says and let
[17:12] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[17:16] Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[17:19] esteem other better than
[17:22] themselves look not every man on his own
[17:25] things but every man also on the things
[17:28] of others
[17:29] and let this mind be in you which was
[17:31] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[17:33] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[17:37] equal with God but made himself of no
[17:41] reputation and took upon him the form of
[17:43] a servant and was made in the likeness
[17:48] of
[17:50] man and being found in fashion as a man
[17:53] he humbled himself and became
[17:56] obedient unto death even
[17:59] the death of the Cross God bless you as
[18:01] you would have your seats this
[18:06] morning we'll go from that scripture to
[18:10] Ezekiel chapter
[18:12] 2 verse 2 and this is
[18:16] obviously in contrast to the character
[18:20] that we saw Christ displayed but in
[18:23] Ezekiel 2 it says son of man say unto
[18:26] the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord
[18:28] God
[18:29] because thine heart is lifted up and
[18:33] thou Hast said I am God I sit in the
[18:36] seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet
[18:38] thou art a man and not God though thou
[18:41] set thine heart as the heart of
[18:44] God in verse 17 thine heart was lifted
[18:48] up because of thy Beauty thou Hast
[18:51] corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy
[18:54] brightness I will cast thee to the
[18:56] ground I will lay thee before Kings
[18:59] that they may behold you so we can see
[19:03] very clearly the contrast here between
[19:06] the character of Christ which was
[19:09] appropriate
[19:10] who being worthy of a reputation made
[19:14] himself of no reputation and then we
[19:17] see Lucifer a created being of God who
[19:22] had no right to a reputation made
[19:25] himself of a reputation and we can see
[19:28] how that worked out for each one of
[19:30] those we know that Christ abased himself
[19:33] and was exalted to the right hand of God
[19:35] given a name above all names but Lucifer
[19:38] says here was cast to the ground and to
[19:42] this day has lost his
[19:45] reputation so we see as brother random
[19:49] taught us the way up truly is
[19:52] down in Proverbs 6 just laying a little
[19:55] bit of review and Foundation here for
[19:58] maybe some that hasn't uh caught the
[20:01] first two parts of this we'll just do
[20:03] this very quickly and then we're going
[20:05] to move on but in Proverbs 6 verse 16 it
[20:08] says these six things doth the Lord hate
[20:12] yay seven are an Abomination under him a
[20:16] proud look first on the
[20:19] list I think that's very significant
[20:22] pride is the first thing that he
[20:25] mentions a ly tongue and hands that shed
[20:28] innocent blood and heart that deviseth
[20:30] evil imaginations feet that be Swift and
[20:33] running to Mischief a false witness that
[20:37] speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord
[20:40] among
[20:42] brother moving to First John
[20:47] 2 says love not the
[20:50] world neither the things that are in the
[20:54] world if any man love the world the love
[20:57] of the father is not in
[21:00] him for all that is in the world the
[21:03] lust of the Flesh and the lust of the
[21:06] eyes and the pride of life is not of the
[21:11] father but is of the
[21:18] world the lust of the
[21:20] flesh the lust of the
[21:22] eyes and the pride of life is something
[21:26] that we have got to compat every day
[21:28] it's something as as I said last time we
[21:30] should be actively pursuing in our life
[21:34] it's not a matter of if it's going to be
[21:38] there it is going to be there it's going
[21:41] to be attacking on every every level
[21:43] it's going to be attacking in every
[21:47] situation it's something that we've got
[21:49] to actively pursue because chances are
[21:53] because of the blessings that's been
[21:55] bestowed upon us and because we have a
[21:58] knowledge of the word and because we are
[22:00] so blessed by proper teaching it's
[22:02] probably not going to show up on the
[22:05] black horse or even the red horse we
[22:08] know that's not his tactics it's it's
[22:10] going to come in a in a very subtle way
[22:13] and start working its way in and it's
[22:16] probably going to be a situation that
[22:18] you're right
[22:23] about but remember I can't even believe
[22:26] I'm saying this but remember being right
[22:28] right is not the end all be
[22:30] all you can be right about something and
[22:33] handle it totally
[22:36] inappropriately that's what we've got to
[22:38] be on guard for amen so I just want to
[22:41] read this quote it's obviously become
[22:43] very familiar to you um but this is kind
[22:46] of what's sparked this whole thought
[22:49] process and this this whole uh
[22:52] rearranging of my mind and hopefully
[22:55] that's manifesting somewhat in my life
[22:58] at this point but this quote just really
[23:01] really shook me and brother brandom is
[23:04] referring to Mary and he says so she had
[23:07] Seven Devils cast out of her pride and
[23:11] envy and then he defines what this Pride
[23:14] was he says she thought she was just so
[23:17] pretty and there was no one like
[23:20] her so again now we have our own
[23:23] interpretations of what pride is and how
[23:25] it manifests itself but we have some
[23:28] somebody who has the authority to set
[23:30] the standard of how that actually is and
[23:33] he gives us the example that here's a
[23:35] little lady who no doubt was
[23:38] attractive she had facts to back up her
[23:41] thought process but brother random says
[23:44] that this
[23:46] devil of Pride that was in her displayed
[23:50] itself and manifested itself in her
[23:53] thinking that she was so pretty and
[23:56] there was nobody like her
[23:58] this was a de this was not just you know
[24:01] a bad thought this was not just you know
[24:04] something she needed to get over this
[24:06] was a devil of Pride laying in her life
[24:11] and this is how it manifested so now
[24:13] that we have the standard readjusted and
[24:15] we have an accurate standard when we
[24:17] start comparing oursel to the accurate
[24:20] standard and not the standard that was
[24:21] on our mind now we become as Isaiah and
[24:24] we become as woe as me because we've
[24:27] realized I won't say we I'll say I I've
[24:29] realized over multiple years by
[24:32] comparing myself to a false standard
[24:35] I've had false results I've had wrong
[24:37] results I've conducted myself
[24:39] inappropriately but now that we have a
[24:42] new standard we have an accurate
[24:44] standard woe is me yeah right but
[24:49] remember Isaiah didn't just stay at woe
[24:51] is
[24:53] me he picked himself up he got off the
[24:56] ground and he repented and he made
[24:58] things
[24:59] right and then he heard this call who
[25:02] will go for
[25:04] us God and he says I will go so I'm not
[25:10] saying that you need to rush the process
[25:12] of Woe Is Me In fact I would encourage
[25:14] you to stay in the process of woe is me
[25:17] until it's settled in your mind I'm I'm
[25:19] not encouraging you to take this lightly
[25:22] or to just skim over it certainly stay
[25:25] in woe as me for as long as you need to
[25:27] be there to make things right and to get
[25:30] your standard
[25:32] adjusted but remember that's not where
[25:34] he wants us to stay he has a purpose for
[25:37] us the reason that he would come and
[25:40] reveal these things to us is because he
[25:42] has a purpose for us and that purpose
[25:45] requires us to be thinking differently
[25:48] so he's not a father that he's just
[25:50] going to come and punish us and tell us
[25:52] how bad we are and how we're hopeless
[25:54] and never going to make us he comes and
[25:56] he reveals a new standard to us because
[25:59] he has a purpose for
[26:02] us so we want to allow
[26:07] him to fulfill that
[26:10] purpose but when Jesus spoke and said be
[26:12] thou clean all that left her she became
[26:15] a new person she wasn't so pretty
[26:18] anymore in her own sight remember her
[26:20] outward appearance did not change maybe
[26:24] she dressed differently more modestly
[26:26] I'm not I'm not saying none of that
[26:27] could have changed but I'm saying as far
[26:29] as her facial features and construction
[26:32] there's no record of that
[26:35] changing but what changed was in her
[26:38] heart what changed was in her mind now
[26:40] she did not feel this way
[26:43] anymore but she wrapped herself in the
[26:46] robe of meekness and gentleness and
[26:49] followed the
[26:51] master questions and answers 1957
[26:54] brother random says now let's take a
[26:55] look back at Cain just take the of his
[26:58] daddy the very start Lucifer in the
[27:00] beginning he was jealous of Michael
[27:04] that's what started the whole
[27:07] trouble
[27:08] jealousy started the whole trouble and
[27:12] the reason that we find oursel in this
[27:13] Fallen condition
[27:16] now 57 washing Jesus's feet brother
[27:19] brandom says when a man thinks that he's
[27:23] just a little bit better than somebody
[27:25] else you're on your road out yeah
[27:31] amen well what if you are better than
[27:33] that
[27:35] person remember the facts aren't
[27:37] necessarily the
[27:39] point brother Brandon said Abraham was a
[27:42] silver dollar lot was a
[27:46] penny but how did Abra Abraham Express
[27:53] that he says here we are and we're
[27:56] having contention we're having our
[27:58] servants fight with each
[28:00] other I'm a silver dollar so I obviously
[28:04] get to resolve this how I see
[28:06] appropriately no not at all he says
[28:09] there's a problem here lot you're my
[28:10] nephew and I love you I tell you what
[28:13] you just do whatever you think is best
[28:15] you look and you pick the best and
[28:17] whatever way you choose I'll go the
[28:20] opposite
[28:22] way
[28:25] amen so the facts that they 's different
[28:30] levels of people and I'm not even about
[28:32] to get into that because I I'll just get
[28:36] myself in trouble I have no no way to I
[28:38] could just say what brother ROM says
[28:40] there's silver dollars and there's
[28:41] pennies how God views that and works
[28:43] that out I have no idea but the problem
[28:46] there's that's not the problem the
[28:48] problem is if we take that into our mind
[28:52] and we start thinking that we're the
[28:53] silver dollar and somebody else is the
[28:55] penny right amen it may even be
[28:59] factual how you would prove that
[29:02] factually I have no idea um but it may
[29:05] even be factual that's not the problem
[29:07] the problem is if we allow that thought
[29:09] into our mind it was factual that
[29:12] Abraham was a silver dollar and lot was
[29:13] a penny but that's not what would was in
[29:15] Abraham's mind or he would have never
[29:17] expressed himself the way that he
[29:23] did he says when you think you're a
[29:25] little bit better than somebody else
[29:28] you're on your road out right not up
[29:33] out 58 the door inside the door he says
[29:36] then there's another little door and
[29:38] that door is called Pride oh that is a
[29:40] hard one to get
[29:42] open you know human beings are just
[29:45] prone to think that maybe they're just a
[29:48] little better than the Jones you know
[29:50] especially here in
[29:53] America so we've got a double portion of
[29:55] this right
[29:59] we're prone to think this
[30:03] way this is why I encouraged you that we
[30:06] have to be actively pursuing this we
[30:09] have to be actively hunting this down
[30:12] because this is not something that's
[30:14] going to come and go this is something
[30:15] that has came in
[30:17] hybridization this is something that we
[30:19] are prone
[30:21] to if if you don't understand what that
[30:24] means I'll try to Define it a little bit
[30:27] if you have a fork in the
[30:31] road and you're prone to something that
[30:34] means you're prone to go that way if
[30:36] there's no other Force pushing you the
[30:39] opposite direction so when you come to a
[30:41] situation and there's two ways to handle
[30:44] it I'm sorry to tell you regardless of
[30:48] how spiritual you are you are prone to
[30:51] handle it wrong and you are prone to
[30:54] handle it with the thought I'm just a
[30:57] little bit better than this person I'm
[30:58] dealing
[31:03] with we first need to acknowledge that
[31:07] that we are
[31:09] prone more likely than not to handle
[31:12] this situation wrong and with the wrong
[31:14] mindset unless there is some type of
[31:18] external or maybe internal force that
[31:21] would shift us away from the way that we
[31:24] are prone to think that I obviously am
[31:28] right in this situation and you are
[31:29] obviously wrong in this situation
[31:31] because I'm prone to think I'm a little
[31:33] bit better than you a little bit maybe
[31:37] not better a little more spiritual than
[31:39] you put whatever word you want to in
[31:40] there you're just a little bit higher
[31:44] than this situation and this person that
[31:46] you're dealing with but there can be an
[31:48] internal Force correct
[31:51] that because Jesus didn't think that way
[31:55] and if we are to have the Holy Spirit
[31:57] Within
[31:58] us then we should be thinking
[32:00] differently we should be as the
[32:02] scripture says letting the mind of
[32:04] Christ be in us so when we can view
[32:07] ourselves appropriately then we're
[32:10] probably more apt to handle the
[32:13] situation correctly to take the wrong
[32:16] fork in the road or I'm sorry to take
[32:18] the right fork in the
[32:20] road but he says human beings are in
[32:24] general prone to think that way
[32:29] we've got to come to terms with that
[32:32] we've got to come to terms when we wake
[32:34] up in the morning and our feet Hit the
[32:36] Floor we are prone to do things wrong
[32:40] and we are going to do things wrong if
[32:42] we don't first commit ourselves and our
[32:44] entire being and our thought process to
[32:47] The Sovereign power of almighty
[32:51] God and especially here in America yeah
[32:58] so let's move on to some new material
[33:01] here brother brandham says in the church
[33:03] age book he says speaking of the first
[33:05] church age the fervent desire to please
[33:07] God the passion to know his word the cry
[33:10] for reaching out in the spirit this is
[33:12] how the church begin he says but it all
[33:14] begins to fade and instead of that
[33:16] church being on fire with the fire of
[33:19] God it has cooled off and has became a
[33:21] bit formal that is what was happening
[33:24] back there to the Ephesians they were
[33:26] getting a bit formal
[33:28] the abandonment to God was dying out and
[33:32] the people weren't too careful about
[33:35] what God thought of them as they begin
[33:38] to be careful about what the world
[33:40] thought of
[33:43] them why would you care what the world
[33:48] thought of you if it was not based on
[33:52] Pride what other
[33:55] reason I mean we would read this
[33:57] statement would think you know how
[33:59] ludicrous that is how silly that is you
[34:01] would think more about what the world
[34:04] would think about you than you do about
[34:06] what God would think about you nobody
[34:08] here is going to sign up for
[34:11] that but it'll come so
[34:14] subtle and you'll be in a conversation
[34:16] maybe even a spiritual
[34:18] conversation and now your pride will
[34:22] raise up and you won't handle it
[34:25] correctly because maybe it'll make you
[34:26] look a little bit bad
[34:29] that is manifesting thinking more of
[34:32] what the world thinks about you than
[34:33] what God thinks about you brother brand
[34:36] says this is how Satan came into the
[34:38] first church age and started ruining
[34:40] it a a little
[34:44] Sly not that they wanted to go be bad
[34:46] bad people not that they wanted to go
[34:48] back into sin not that they wanted to be
[34:50] immoral they simply started
[34:54] considering how is my reputation before
[34:57] the world rather than what does God
[35:00] think of me how does the father view
[35:03] this that's how how easily it will come
[35:08] in he says by the end of the first
[35:10] church age the Deeds of the nicians were
[35:13] flourishing in the local falsifying
[35:16] churches with increasing attempts to
[35:19] spread their influence farther than
[35:22] their own
[35:25] body why would you have a desire to
[35:27] spread your influence farther than your
[35:30] own local body if there was not Pride
[35:35] involved he says its influence was felt
[35:38] upon the true church for men like the
[35:40] Vernal polycarp were calling themselves
[35:43] Bishops with a reference to that title
[35:45] which was not inherent in it according
[35:48] to the word there's your answer you he
[35:51] this this Spirit was trying to raise up
[35:54] Pride at an
[35:56] individual to spread his influence
[35:59] farther than the local assembly so that
[36:03] now he can have a self-proclaimed title
[36:05] of Bishop over not only this local
[36:08] assembly but other
[36:14] assemblies this
[36:17] is the results of being more careful
[36:21] about what the world would think of you
[36:22] than what would God would think of you
[36:24] this is what it leads into it's not just
[36:26] going to stay there it's going to
[36:29] continue to grow and continue to
[36:31] manifest itself even polycarp who I
[36:34] would say we would all take a vote and
[36:36] say had a pretty good
[36:38] reputation but brother brandham calls
[36:40] him out and says even he fell subject to
[36:43] this trying to spread his
[36:46] influence and take a title over more
[36:49] than his local
[36:51] assembly now I want to clarify
[36:55] something there is a big difference
[36:58] between your influence affecting
[37:02] somebody
[37:03] else and you trying to have your
[37:06] influence affect somebody
[37:08] else so if your life your daily life
[37:13] lived according to the word of God is
[37:16] influencing people outside of your local
[37:18] assembly you're not wrong this is good
[37:22] this is what is supposed to happen but
[37:25] if you are
[37:26] trying that's right because you think
[37:30] maybe you're a silver dollar and they're
[37:31] a penny if you're
[37:33] trying to exert your influence over more
[37:37] than the local
[37:38] assembly that's where you're
[37:42] wrong if our day daily lives affect
[37:45] people it should affect people even
[37:48] people in other churches there that's
[37:49] not wrong that's not the
[37:51] issue but this would be especially
[37:55] important for somebody in a uh a role in
[37:58] the church or an officer of the church
[38:00] or a minister in the church to try to be
[38:03] affecting other local
[38:06] bodies for the purpose of raising
[38:09] yourself up or even your local body up
[38:12] of how we're right and you're wrong
[38:14] that's the issue
[38:18] here and that can only be driven by
[38:23] Pride brother brandom said we need
[38:26] thousands of lived voices is thundering
[38:28] out we need those lives thundering out
[38:30] we need those influences going forth but
[38:34] the the motivation behind that influence
[38:37] going forth should not be yourself or
[38:42] your position or a title or a reputation
[38:45] it should be to honor God to honor the
[38:49] father to manifest his word to help a
[38:53] brother and sister
[38:55] somewhere he says and humble thyself now
[38:58] surely after all these years on the
[38:59] field and around the world and seeing
[39:01] different people I ought to know a
[39:02] little bit about the gate to enter in at
[39:05] and if you want to get anywhere with
[39:08] God never let an arrogant Spirit come
[39:11] around
[39:14] you anywhere with God that means if you
[39:16] want to get that far with God you will
[39:20] never do that if there is an arrogant
[39:21] Spirit around you you first have to deal
[39:24] with
[39:25] that Palmer one Lo caterpillar and
[39:28] cankerworm 1959 brother brandom says and
[39:31] if it so happens that you do not believe
[39:33] he's speaking to the people as before he
[39:35] starts his sermon he says and if it so
[39:37] happens that you do not believe just the
[39:39] things that we speak as of our church
[39:42] doctrine we trust that it will by no
[39:44] means bring an
[39:45] offense because the very first step to
[39:48] successful Christianity and to show that
[39:51] man has received the Holy Spirit is
[39:54] humility real god-given humility
[39:58] that it must be given humbly so here's a
[40:01] man in his own church in his own pull
[40:03] pit getting ready to preach his own
[40:06] Doctrine and he's saying before I do
[40:09] that please don't be offended by that I
[40:12] don't mean to say anything to offend
[40:16] you a man standing having every right to
[40:21] speak whatever God lays on his heart but
[40:23] he knows I can't just say this any way
[40:26] that I want to say this I just can't say
[40:28] this and come off arrogant this may be
[40:30] absolute 100% truth and Absolute
[40:33] Concrete doctrine that I'm getting ready
[40:35] to lay out but if I would say in such a
[40:38] way that would offend you I don't even
[40:40] have the holy spirit
[40:41] yet because the first sign of a true
[40:45] Holy Spirit in an individual is real
[40:48] god-given
[40:52] humility I think we could learn a lot
[40:55] from that example amen
[40:58] how many times have we
[41:00] been quick to correct
[41:03] something and gave no thought to how we
[41:06] correct
[41:07] it of what humility we should do that in
[41:13] but here is a man standing where he has
[41:15] the authority to say what's on his heart
[41:18] and say it as hard as he wants to say it
[41:20] or as soft as he wants to say it and he
[41:22] would first for the sake of the people
[41:25] say I'm going to preach Doctrine this
[41:26] morning I'm going to tell the truth I'm
[41:28] going to lay out what's on my heart but
[41:30] please don't be offended by that it's
[41:31] not my intent to offend how many times
[41:34] have we just taken the word of God and
[41:36] thrown the word of God out there and
[41:37] shot the word of God out there and let
[41:39] the chips fall where they may and say
[41:40] well whatever I told the truth however
[41:42] they responded to it that's on
[41:46] them but we're on a higher plane now
[41:50] Saints we're on a higher plane it's it's
[41:53] not the days of that
[41:58] in the Masterpiece brother brandham said
[41:59] but standing up there with an education
[42:02] polished you know and so forth he's
[42:04] referencing the man that was trying to
[42:06] pull the Pentecostal Church Into The
[42:07] ecumenical movement he's saying he was
[42:10] standing up there with an education
[42:11] polished you know and so forth that's
[42:14] not the way God polishes his he does not
[42:18] polish his with education he polishes in
[42:23] humility in power of His manifested word
[42:27] he says we believe the bride is getting
[42:30] its last polishing down now do you
[42:34] understand why I scold you that ain't
[42:36] because I don't love you I do love you I
[42:38] want a masterpiece for the master I
[42:41] might have to tear a few out like this
[42:44] but I'll have a masterpiece some of
[42:46] these days if I keep it right on this
[42:48] word so brother brandom is coming in the
[42:51] message Masterpiece we just listened to
[42:53] this all together recently and this
[42:54] struck me but remember the quote that we
[42:57] just read brother brandom says in order
[42:59] to start with God never let an arrogant
[43:02] Spirit come around you in order to even
[43:04] prove that you have the Holy Spirit and
[43:07] an experience with God you first that
[43:09] will first be manifested in real
[43:11] god-given humility so this is the
[43:13] starting point
[43:15] humility but now he comes in the
[43:17] Masterpiece and he says God's finishing
[43:20] his Masterpiece and he polishes you when
[43:23] you're sculpting something you don't
[43:25] begin with polishing yeah
[43:27] you start with usually a large hammer or
[43:29] a chisel and there's chunks falling out
[43:31] of it but where where does polishing
[43:33] come in polishing comes in at the
[43:36] end so now this walk with Christ this
[43:39] real true experience of Christ it begins
[43:42] with humility but then it ends with
[43:50] humility this
[43:53] is the conundrum that I ran into when I
[43:56] read this quote about
[43:57] Mary is because I remember the day when
[44:00] I first came to Christ
[44:03] humble I can remember that day and I
[44:05] think we all can remember that day when
[44:07] he Pricks our heart and it usually comes
[44:10] along the lines of something like we
[44:12] recognize we don't have everything
[44:14] figured out and we was probably wrong
[44:15] about
[44:18] something so when now we realize we're
[44:21] wrong and we need a
[44:25] savior and we're not faking humility
[44:27] when that Revelation
[44:29] hits that day we know we know we need
[44:33] help we need help in a bad way we have
[44:36] no problem with humility on that day but
[44:40] now all of a sudden we go through this
[44:43] process and we started out with true
[44:46] humility but then we start learning the
[44:49] word and we start walking in the word
[44:50] and we start learning Doctrine we start
[44:52] learning things and now all of a sudden
[44:54] here we are I'll just I'm not speaking
[44:56] for anybody else I'll speak for myself
[44:57] here we are we come and we're 39 years
[45:00] old and we read this quote about Mary
[45:02] and how her thought process revealed a
[45:04] devil of Pride that was inside her and
[45:06] we compare oursel back to the real
[45:08] standard now and we have this question
[45:10] where did my humility go I had it at one
[45:14] point in time my walk started with this
[45:16] humility there was no faking that but
[45:18] now why am I so hard and why am I so
[45:21] callous and why am I so prideful and why
[45:23] am I so adamant that I've got to be
[45:25] right about everything and why am I so
[45:28] adamant that I've got to have the proper
[45:30] understanding to be the first to say
[45:36] it see this is the conundrum is if it
[45:39] started with humility and he's going to
[45:43] finish this work by polish polishing
[45:47] with
[45:48] humility what happened in the process
[45:50] between these two
[45:54] gaps I tell you what happened the pride
[45:56] of life rose
[45:59] up the pride of life rose up because we
[46:01] learned a few things and there was
[46:03] nothing wrong with learning a few things
[46:04] we should have learned a few things he's
[46:06] rebuilding that tree back and part of
[46:08] that tree is
[46:11] Doctrine but why just because when the
[46:15] life's coming back into that tree and
[46:17] he's putting truth back into it and he's
[46:20] putting truth back into our Lives why
[46:22] when we started out in this in this
[46:24] humble state of humility of knowing we
[46:27] needed a savior and knowing that we were
[46:28] wrong and knowing that we needed help
[46:30] now all of a sudden we've got a few
[46:32] doctrines and we know who the seventh
[46:33] angel is and what Revelation 10:7 means
[46:36] and Malachi 4 now all of a sudden we've
[46:38] where did Pride come with that that's
[46:41] not in the message it was never
[46:43] delivered in the
[46:45] message but now we find ourselves year I
[46:48] keep saying we I'm saying I I well every
[46:52] time I say we just think I I'm not
[46:53] trying to preach at you amen but if the
[46:56] shoe
[47:00] where but through this
[47:04] process it was never delivered to us in
[47:07] Pride or with arrogance that's right but
[47:10] somehow through this process that has R
[47:12] risen up and taken a
[47:16] hold but I thank God that he polishes
[47:19] with
[47:20] humility because he's got a purpose for
[47:22] this image and he's not going to allow
[47:25] this image to be anything other than
[47:26] what his purpose was so he started that
[47:29] out with
[47:31] humility and I guess just because he's
[47:33] God and he knows how we are and he knows
[47:35] how we're prone to be he recognizes the
[47:38] need look when we get to the end of this
[47:39] after I build them up a little bit I'm
[47:42] going to have to polish them
[47:45] again so he knows this he knows this
[47:51] process but brother brandom laid that
[47:53] principle down in the
[47:55] Masterpiece and he says says that we
[47:57] believe the bride is getting its last
[47:59] polishing
[48:02] down its last polishing down is not
[48:07] coming any other way than by
[48:11] humility it's a last polishing of
[48:14] humility that's what the prophet says so
[48:19] I feel that we should
[48:22] just accept the fact that he is going to
[48:25] Humble our
[48:27] he's he's going to make that happen we
[48:29] should not be resistance to the
[48:31] resistant to the fact that he's humbling
[48:34] us whenever we're experiencing
[48:36] situations in our lives that are
[48:38] humbling we should just say thank you
[48:40] God for polishing me we should not
[48:42] resist those because it is what he's
[48:45] going to
[48:46] do and we don't want to come so far down
[48:50] along the road and get to the final
[48:54] stages to where he's simply needing to
[48:56] polish
[48:58] something but you know how it is when
[49:00] you're working on
[49:02] something like a bolt that won't come
[49:05] loose and it's supposed to come loose
[49:07] and you put a little oil on it and you
[49:09] know twist it a little bit easier and it
[49:11] still won't come
[49:12] loose okay you don't keep twisting on it
[49:15] you go get a hammer you go get a
[49:17] torch we don't want to take a process of
[49:22] Simply
[49:24] polishing and make him go back and get
[49:26] his hand Hammer because he
[49:29] will because he has an image in his mind
[49:33] and we are going to match that image
[49:36] yeah remember God is not a man that
[49:38] would lie and God has said I will have a
[49:41] bride without spot or wrinkle it does
[49:44] not say I will have that unless they
[49:46] just really resist my last polishing
[49:49] down he says I will have a bride without
[49:51] spot or wrinkle so when we come to the
[49:53] last polishing down we do not want to be
[49:58] immature and buck up against
[50:01] God because he's a good
[50:06] father he's a good father and he knows
[50:09] how to raise his children
[50:10] appropriately and he knows how to get
[50:12] the results that he wants and he knows
[50:15] deep within our heart we really do want
[50:18] the results that he wants It's just
[50:20] sometimes we can't get over
[50:23] ourselves so he would even let this type
[50:25] out in the natur natural that he would
[50:27] say any father who has a child that
[50:29] would act that way and they won't bring
[50:30] the rod of Correction they're an evil
[50:34] father the point that I'm
[50:37] making is if we're at this stage of a
[50:39] final polishing let's be mature and
[50:41] let's accept that let's not resist that
[50:45] let's not go back to the days of the
[50:47] hammer and the Chisel those are way
[50:49] worse than polishing sandpaper does not
[50:52] feel good on your
[50:54] skin a chisel on your arm feels a lot
[50:56] worse though you will forget about the
[50:59] irritation of sandpaper on your skin
[51:02] when somebody comes along with a chisel
[51:03] or a pickaxe and drives it through your
[51:08] arm we don't want to be spiritually
[51:11] immature okay so now I'm going to take a
[51:13] pivot and as our Pastor said a couple
[51:16] Services ago we're going to go well I
[51:18] don't have a Cow Shed I've got big old
[51:19] kennel so we're going to go around the
[51:21] bigel kennels for a second but I assure
[51:24] you we're going to come back and it'll
[51:25] be a very clear point just hang with
[51:28] me let's turn our Bibles to Mark
[51:34] 11 because remember there is a purpose
[51:38] for this
[51:39] polishing there is a purpose behind his
[51:43] process there is a purpose for Isaiah
[51:47] coming to the point of woe is
[51:49] me it's not just to stay at woe as me
[51:54] there is a purpose
[51:57] for this process
[52:01] amen Mark 11 CH 22 very
[52:05] familiar and Jesus answering saith unto
[52:08] them have faith in God for verily I say
[52:12] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[52:15] this mountain be thou removed and be
[52:17] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[52:19] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[52:20] that those things which he saith shall
[52:22] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[52:26] saith am remember there is a
[52:31] purpose in this process there is a
[52:34] purpose in this polishing of
[52:38] humility
[52:39] 1959 who is this this is the message
[52:43] right before brother brandham speaks uh
[52:47] preaches speak to this mountain in San
[52:49] Jose California so this is 1959 November
[52:54] 22nd he says so remember this coming
[52:57] week
[52:58] now if the Lord is willing we'll be
[53:00] speaking Monday night the Lord willing
[53:02] upon the issuing in of the new ministry
[53:05] he's referring to the third pole what we
[53:06] commonly know as the third
[53:09] poll now many know that way back from
[53:12] the beginning how the Holy Spirit
[53:14] revealed first before I
[53:16] started on a
[53:18] gift speaking of the sign in the hand
[53:21] and then I came up the west coast and
[53:23] across Canada for three or four years
[53:25] telling you that he said that something
[53:27] else would come which would be far
[53:29] greater than along it came speaking of
[53:32] the second poll of
[53:34] discernment he said then he said just
[53:37] keep
[53:38] humble this is God's instructions for
[53:41] the prophet from the second Pole to the
[53:43] third pole first on the
[53:47] list keep
[53:49] humble keep away from money and all the
[53:53] things of the world remember what all
[53:55] the things of the world are script rely
[53:56] speaking the lust of the eyes the lust
[53:58] of the Flesh and the pride of
[54:01] life don't never try to be
[54:05] big this is God's instructions to the
[54:09] prophet just stay
[54:12] humble God does not need to be redundant
[54:15] this is the voice of God
[54:17] speaking and there'd be something else
[54:20] greater now that's coming
[54:23] now so God's instructions to his Propet
[54:26] from the second pull to the third pole
[54:28] is to be
[54:29] humble don't try to be big and to stay
[54:32] humble just in case he didn't hear him
[54:34] the first
[54:37] time so this message is
[54:42] preached November of 59 this the
[54:45] squirrels were spoken into existence in
[54:49] ooc at the October and the beginning of
[54:51] November 59 he comes to the Tabernacle
[54:55] and preach is my new
[54:58] ministry um at the beginning of O
[55:01] November and then he goes here to San
[55:03] Jose so hopefully hopefully I don't
[55:05] confuse you but that's the pattern here
[55:09] God's dealing with him he puts them in
[55:12] the woods the squirrels are spoken to
[55:14] into existence he has the incident with
[55:16] Hatty Wright he comes and explains the
[55:19] new ministry and what's going on to the
[55:20] Tabernacle and then he immediately goes
[55:22] to San Jose but these people in San Jose
[55:25] I don't know the the whole backstory but
[55:27] these people in San Jose are very
[55:29] special to the prophet um
[55:32] because he you can just tell when you
[55:35] listen to this he's speaking very
[55:36] personal to them and this is a huge huge
[55:41] part of brother brandom's life this is a
[55:44] major Junction in his life and he tells
[55:47] it at the Tabernacle and then he tells
[55:48] it to the people in San Jose and the the
[55:51] best that I can see he really lays
[55:52] silent on it he doesn't go out spreading
[55:54] this out in all of his meetings so these
[55:57] uh in fact he makes a comment to these
[55:59] people in San Jose because he was just
[56:01] there earlier in the spring and he says
[56:04] this was such a nice atmosphere it was
[56:05] such a nice setting all the ministers
[56:08] were um uh collaborating together and he
[56:11] did three nights there and when he came
[56:13] back and he says and I just didn't think
[56:15] three nights was enough for that kind of
[56:17] atmosphere so this is this is a special
[56:21] setting this is a special situation and
[56:23] there may be some I say this
[56:25] respectfully there may be some old
[56:26] timers in here who know more about that
[56:28] than what I do but I can tell just by
[56:30] listening to this the the tape here this
[56:33] is a setting and a group of people
[56:35] brother brandom knows will receive
[56:38] this and appreciate it and are looking
[56:43] for it he makes the comment he says I
[56:44] told you all that this was on the road
[56:46] when I was here last year I could almost
[56:48] reach out and grasp it but now here it
[56:51] is so just with that little bit of
[56:53] context consider that
[56:57] so he tells them that and who is this
[57:00] and that's the message right before
[57:02] speak to this mountain and speak to this
[57:04] mountain is when brother brandham really
[57:07] Dives in to explaining what's going on
[57:10] with his ministry in this third poll and
[57:12] he says it's been about 3 or 4 years ago
[57:15] when I was just reading over it speaking
[57:17] of Mark
[57:18] 11 scripture I noticed that the tree had
[57:22] withered and I thought just a miracle of
[57:25] God
[57:26] but yet there was something begin to
[57:29] pull in my
[57:34] mind I find that very intriguing the
[57:37] terminology that he would
[57:40] use because
[57:42] remember this is a third
[57:46] pull not a third
[57:50] push or a third
[57:53] press brother brandom is is bearing his
[57:58] soul to us in this process of the
[58:01] transition of his ministry and he's
[58:03] saying that it came I was reading the
[58:06] scripture one day on Mark 11 and I just
[58:09] thought well that was just another
[58:10] miracle but now
[58:13] something something or maybe
[58:16] someone starts pulling on him with this
[58:20] scripture not pressing onto him start
[58:26] start pulling him with this
[58:29] scripture he says it began to pull at my
[58:32] mind have you examined that scripture
[58:35] that you can have what you have said if
[58:38] you say and then believe that you have
[58:39] it you can have what you said this is
[58:42] the voice that's speaking to him have
[58:43] you examined that it's pulling on him
[58:46] have you examined
[58:50] this he says now we had been fishing
[58:53] down at Del Hollow again and that night
[58:55] we caught a nice string of fish but had
[58:56] run out of bait and we were standing
[58:58] throwing our flying lines in Catching
[59:00] little bluegills to bait them with and
[59:03] Mr bankswood said to
[59:05] lwood which both of them was Brothers
[59:08] said we ought to go over there to some
[59:09] old lady she's about 90 years old when
[59:11] we were little Jehovah Witness boys we
[59:13] used to go around there and she'd give
[59:15] us bread and butter you remember that
[59:16] old homemade bread Bank said we ought to
[59:19] go tell her that we are
[59:22] saved and brother brandom says that was
[59:25] the right
[59:27] thing now for 's for time's sake I'm
[59:31] going to have to paraphrase some of this
[59:33] but brother branom said that they had
[59:35] been out there fishing and they had been
[59:37] talking about Mark
[59:39] 11 talking about that scripture and now
[59:43] Banks and L are there they're catching
[59:45] bluegills for their bait to go
[59:47] catfishing and they make this comment
[59:49] Banks makes this comment we should go
[59:51] tell that lady that we are saved now and
[59:56] brother R says he that that was the
[59:59] right thing he says now please try to
[1:00:01] catch this it's just the way you say
[1:00:04] things sometimes that changes the whole
[1:00:11] setup I pray that God will help us catch
[1:00:14] that
[1:00:15] Saints the days of just being right are
[1:00:19] gone we have a word that is so precious
[1:00:23] now that is not just about being
[1:00:28] right brother Brandon says just the way
[1:00:31] you say
[1:00:33] things now can change
[1:00:36] everything you can say things and be
[1:00:38] absolutely 100% right and not get the
[1:00:41] result God's wanting
[1:00:46] amen see this is such a higher
[1:00:50] level we just can't be flipp it with our
[1:00:53] tongue
[1:00:54] anymore think the scripture the man who
[1:00:58] ruleth his tongue is better than him
[1:00:59] that ruleth a city that's right more
[1:01:01] powerful than him that ruleth a
[1:01:04] city oh yeah that's a good principle we
[1:01:06] we should no Saints this is literally
[1:01:09] tied to the third pole yes sir this
[1:01:14] principle is directly tied to the third
[1:01:21] poll it's the way that you say things
[1:01:24] sometimes that changes the the whole
[1:01:27] setup they said just the right thing for
[1:01:31] just then the Holy Spirit dropped upon
[1:01:33] me from Heaven somewhere and I said thus
[1:01:35] sayeth the Lord there will be a
[1:01:37] resurrection of a little life of some
[1:01:38] kind of little animal I said I didn't
[1:01:40] see just what the animal was but it was
[1:01:43] something that sprung to Life all at
[1:01:44] once and we'd been talking about this
[1:01:48] scripture he says we fish all night and
[1:01:50] the next morning we hadn't caught any
[1:01:52] fish that night on our Trot lines
[1:01:54] because we changed the bait to those
[1:01:55] bluegill and the catfish were not biting
[1:01:58] on that he says about the time that it
[1:02:01] got daylight we had all of our Trot
[1:02:03] lines run we pulled into a little Cove
[1:02:05] and we were fishing with the fly lines
[1:02:07] for these big brim and that's just a
[1:02:09] little larger bluegill so they're
[1:02:11] fishing for different type of
[1:02:13] bait and he says so we were fishing for
[1:02:16] those brim on a fly line and Mr lwood
[1:02:19] had a reel and a pole and he just
[1:02:22] dropped it in the water with a great big
[1:02:24] long hook and a poor little blue had
[1:02:26] swallowed it plumb down in the bottom of
[1:02:28] his belly so I'm not going to give you a
[1:02:29] fishing lesson here but well maybe I am
[1:02:31] but okay when you're using a fly line
[1:02:33] you're using a little bitty lur so for a
[1:02:36] Blu Gill it can it will usually come up
[1:02:38] to the surface and just suck that in and
[1:02:40] pop it right into his lip you pull them
[1:02:42] in you take it out you put them in the
[1:02:44] bucket to be cut up as catfish
[1:02:46] bait L's fishing with a regular rod and
[1:02:50] pole and he's got a really big hook on
[1:02:53] it so when he drops it down in there
[1:02:54] brother R says he got to talking he
[1:02:56] wasn't paying attention so the bluegill
[1:02:58] comes up eats the bait well obviously
[1:03:00] because he doesn't set the hook it just
[1:03:01] keeps eating the bait so now it's got
[1:03:04] this big hook all the way down inside of
[1:03:05] us L stops talking pulls it up and he
[1:03:08] says I wish you just look at here you
[1:03:10] can't even see the hook and you just
[1:03:12] grabbed the fish like this and just
[1:03:14] pulled and pulled the hook out pulled
[1:03:16] the inters and the gills and everything
[1:03:18] out of it throwed it out on the water
[1:03:20] like this to get his hook out and the
[1:03:22] little fish quivered four or five times
[1:03:25] and spread it little fins out and died
[1:03:26] laying there on the water so he said
[1:03:28] little fellow you shot your last Wad and
[1:03:31] we went on and I said L you you
[1:03:33] shouldn't take the hook out like that
[1:03:35] and I was trying to tell him I said put
[1:03:37] a smaller hook on and he was just a
[1:03:40] Farmer Boy you know he never fish very
[1:03:43] much I find this fascinating I'm not
[1:03:45] here to preach a new doctrine but I find
[1:03:47] this fascinating that at the beginning
[1:03:49] of this third pole which the third pole
[1:03:52] is based on a vision of
[1:03:54] fishing at the beginning of this brother
[1:03:56] brandham is in a boat that's right
[1:03:59] teaching somebody how to
[1:04:02] fish exactly what he said he was doing
[1:04:05] in the vision he was there TR he said a
[1:04:06] group of ministers at that time but he
[1:04:08] was trying to show those ministers how
[1:04:10] to fish he says because I thought I
[1:04:11] could really teach them how to fish I
[1:04:13] find this
[1:04:15] fascinating he's literally doing what
[1:04:17] the vision said and he's trying to
[1:04:20] explain to L don't do that you know
[1:04:23] that's that's not right to do that and
[1:04:25] not in this message but in another one
[1:04:27] La answers back and he said well you
[1:04:28] know that's just the way we do it around
[1:04:32] here God bless him I'm sure he's a fine
[1:04:34] brother but it just totally went over
[1:04:36] his
[1:04:37] head just totally went over his head his
[1:04:40] brother Banks had just said the right
[1:04:43] thing the day before and here's brother
[1:04:45] brandham trying to explain to him L
[1:04:47] don't do that that's not right you know
[1:04:48] you shouldn't just do that to a fish
[1:04:49] that's wrong way to do it use a small
[1:04:51] well that's just the way we do it around
[1:04:52] here I don't care not the right thing to
[1:04:57] say not the right thing not the right
[1:05:00] attitude what is that I'll ask you what
[1:05:03] that is you say well that's just Petty
[1:05:05] that's
[1:05:06] Pride that's the way we do it around
[1:05:08] here yeah right I don't care what you
[1:05:11] have to say about using a smaller
[1:05:14] hook Pride that small
[1:05:21] Pride L you shouldn't take the hook out
[1:05:23] like that and he says
[1:05:27] and we was fishing and I was catching
[1:05:29] and we was catching some pretty nice
[1:05:31] fish so this conversation happens they
[1:05:34] keep on fishing catching this bait and
[1:05:36] he says all of a sudden something
[1:05:39] happened and coming down of anointing
[1:05:42] that I've never felt like something said
[1:05:44] stand up and something said to me speak
[1:05:46] to that little fish and he will live
[1:05:48] again the gills were white was hanging
[1:05:51] out of his mouth and I said little fishy
[1:05:53] Jesus Christ gives you your life and God
[1:05:56] in heaven who's my solemn judge that
[1:05:58] fish turned over and swam down through
[1:06:00] the water as hard as he could go and now
[1:06:04] now L gets
[1:06:05] it if if you read uh compilation of this
[1:06:10] story in multiple Services uh L L gets
[1:06:13] it he's like that that was for me
[1:06:15] because I was being disrespectful and I
[1:06:16] said little fishy you shot your last W
[1:06:18] and I didn't care and I just and brother
[1:06:19] brandom's trying to console him he's
[1:06:21] like no no that's not it that wasn't it
[1:06:24] but he gets it he recogniz is under this
[1:06:26] presence under this anointing I would
[1:06:29] venture to say it's the same presence
[1:06:31] that was Walking In The Garden that made
[1:06:33] Adam and Eve realized they were naked
[1:06:35] when they were
[1:06:36] clothed now all of a sudden under this
[1:06:38] presence now all of a sudden under this
[1:06:40] new
[1:06:42] standard under a proper
[1:06:45] definition La gets
[1:06:48] it I'm
[1:06:51] wrong brother R says now the strange
[1:06:53] thing to me is this how God the Great
[1:06:55] HOV God would use his power to bring a
[1:06:57] little fish for we'd cut up two or 300
[1:07:01] of them the night
[1:07:03] before he would use his power to bring
[1:07:06] that fish to life and I've got at least
[1:07:07] 300 children on the list up
[1:07:10] there praying them for a vision to see a
[1:07:13] vision for them and just about that time
[1:07:16] he says I'm thinking this and he's
[1:07:17] expressing this to the brothers he says
[1:07:19] just about that time something said Mark
[1:07:23] 11:23
[1:07:27] so brother random is confused because
[1:07:29] he's just experienced an anointing like
[1:07:31] he's never experienced before on a
[1:07:35] little fish that they had just cut up
[1:07:37] two or 300 of them the night before and
[1:07:39] used them as catfish
[1:07:43] bait I don't know that I can properly
[1:07:46] Express this but please understand them
[1:07:48] catching the fish the little bluegills
[1:07:51] cutting them up into catfish bait and
[1:07:53] catching fish catfish off of them was
[1:07:55] not wrong them killing them fish cutting
[1:07:58] them up and using them for bait was not
[1:08:01] wrong a man disrespecting that little
[1:08:06] fish that little fish's life and just
[1:08:09] yanking his hook out and pulling his
[1:08:10] guts and his gills out and throwing him
[1:08:12] off on the water like he was
[1:08:15] nothing was absolutely a violation of
[1:08:18] the character of Jesus
[1:08:20] Christ you could take that same fish I
[1:08:23] don't have words to explain the Saints
[1:08:25] you either catch or do you don't you can
[1:08:26] catch that same fish
[1:08:28] respectfully lay it on the board cut it
[1:08:31] up into pieces and use it for bait and
[1:08:33] God doesn't have a problem you can catch
[1:08:36] that same little fish handle it IR
[1:08:40] irreverently not respect its life
[1:08:45] yeah and it will grieve the Holy
[1:08:49] Spirit a little
[1:08:53] fish we can tell take the word of God
[1:08:57] and fet each other with it
[1:08:59] Saints and if it's done in the right
[1:09:01] manner it does not displease God we can
[1:09:05] take the word of God and filet each
[1:09:08] other and not care how it makes the
[1:09:10] other person feel and you've just
[1:09:12] violated the very character and essence
[1:09:14] of God yes using the word to cut is not
[1:09:20] the issue yeah the word of God is a
[1:09:22] two-edged sword it's made to cut right
[1:09:25] amen
[1:09:26] how you're handling cutting that person
[1:09:29] is the
[1:09:31] issue and if that issue is so
[1:09:35] prevalent that God would use it as an
[1:09:37] example in our
[1:09:39] message as a starting point and a
[1:09:42] springboard for the third
[1:09:44] poll this principle of how we would
[1:09:48] handle something that we just view as
[1:09:50] insignificant this is a little fish how
[1:09:53] much more so are brothers and
[1:09:57] sisters maybe not even a brother and
[1:09:59] sister just an unbeliever a human
[1:10:08] being brother Ren says I can't wrap my
[1:10:11] mind around that we' just cut all these
[1:10:13] up and used them as bait but yet God
[1:10:16] cared enough about this one that when
[1:10:19] this one was
[1:10:20] disrespected yeah and his life not
[1:10:24] honored
[1:10:28] yeah he would say I'm going to come on
[1:10:30] the
[1:10:31] scene I'm going to come on the scene for
[1:10:34] that little fishy and I'm going to give
[1:10:36] it back its life it shouldn't have been
[1:10:38] done that way and I'm going to use it
[1:10:42] I'm going to use it to manifest my power
[1:10:44] there's 300 children over here a
[1:10:47] prophets praying and waiting on a vision
[1:10:50] for I'm going to deal with that little
[1:10:53] fishy it shouldn't have been handled
[1:10:54] that way
[1:10:59] I pray that somehow God will allow us to
[1:11:01] truly grasp that Saints because if we
[1:11:04] can grasp that
[1:11:07] principle we'll know how to treat our
[1:11:09] brothers and sisters we'll know how to
[1:11:11] treat unbelievers
[1:11:15] amen people that don't hunt can't wrap
[1:11:17] their minds around these types of
[1:11:19] situations but you'll take somebody who
[1:11:21] hunts and you will go out and you will
[1:11:23] shoot and you will kill an animal and it
[1:11:25] will bleed and it will die and you will
[1:11:27] dress it out and you will take it home
[1:11:28] and you will eat it and that is not a
[1:11:30] problem but the same
[1:11:32] man that will shoot something and kill
[1:11:35] it and it will bleed and it will
[1:11:37] die will lose sleep if he shoots and he
[1:11:40] injures it and it gets away
[1:11:43] amen you were trying to kill it yeah but
[1:11:48] now it's
[1:11:49] wounded you hit a limb or whatever stuff
[1:11:53] happens I I get it I'm not saying you're
[1:11:55] a bad person if that happens stuff
[1:11:57] happens brother random had that happen
[1:11:59] to
[1:12:01] him but people can't people you know the
[1:12:04] anti-hunting community they can't wrap
[1:12:05] their mind around that like you're out
[1:12:06] there you're a killer you're no we're
[1:12:08] not a killer we're
[1:12:09] Hunters it's a big difference between a
[1:12:11] killer and a hunter does a hunter kill
[1:12:14] yes but a hunter a true Hunter is not a
[1:12:18] killer a hunter will lose sleep and
[1:12:22] spend hours on his hands and knees out
[1:12:25] the woods searching for specks of blood
[1:12:27] to Trail this animal so that it doesn't
[1:12:29] go to waste or that he can find it and
[1:12:31] put a finishing shot on it this is the
[1:12:35] principle and character of
[1:12:37] Christ it's not to be irreverent and
[1:12:42] disrespectful even to animal
[1:12:46] life this is not pleasing to God but
[1:12:49] this is a principle in the character of
[1:12:51] God
[1:13:06] he tells this
[1:13:08] story and then he this is still in the
[1:13:11] message speak to this mountain he tells
[1:13:14] this story of the little fish now that
[1:13:16] happened let me try to give you the
[1:13:19] timeline that would have been 1957
[1:13:26] so 1957 this scripture is pulling on
[1:13:29] brother brandom he has they're talking
[1:13:33] about this scripture he has this
[1:13:35] incident where God tells him what to say
[1:13:39] and he speaks life back into a
[1:13:41] fish and then this continues to
[1:13:46] move
[1:13:47] in 1958
[1:13:56] I'm going to get ahead of myself so let
[1:13:58] me just read this but this incident was
[1:14:00] in 1957 just hold that in your mind he'd
[1:14:03] been thinking of this scripture it began
[1:14:05] to pull on him and in 1957 this manifest
[1:14:08] himself itself so brother brandom in
[1:14:12] 1957
[1:14:14] knows what's tied to this
[1:14:17] scripture and furthermore he knows that
[1:14:21] there is an anointing above what he's
[1:14:25] experienced in his first and second
[1:14:27] pools he knows this this is factual
[1:14:29] because it's been manifested now he
[1:14:31] declares this openly that anointing that
[1:14:33] came in that boat that spoke that fish
[1:14:35] to life that was something totally
[1:14:37] different than what we've experienced up
[1:14:39] until this
[1:14:41] point continuing in this message brother
[1:14:44] brandom is relaying to the church in San
[1:14:47] Jose the transition in his ministry and
[1:14:50] he just tells them the story of the
[1:14:51] little fish and now he moves into
[1:14:53] another story he said Fred San a friend
[1:14:56] of mine bosom friend from Canada was
[1:14:58] with me in New England campaign last
[1:15:00] year and we went over in the Adera where
[1:15:04] I was lost at that
[1:15:06] time you remember the first service that
[1:15:09] we preached on this we really labored on
[1:15:12] this this was a huge turning point in
[1:15:15] brother ROM's life is when he got lost
[1:15:17] up on Hurricane Mountain and he realized
[1:15:20] he wasn't The Woodsman he thought he was
[1:15:22] and he came back with a changed mindset
[1:15:24] of Lord I can't can't even hunt without
[1:15:26] you I can't even fish without you I
[1:15:28] can't drive my car without you this was
[1:15:30] a huge turning point in his
[1:15:33] life and this is something he's
[1:15:36] relating as part of the change of his
[1:15:38] ministry he says we were there this
[1:15:40] would have been in
[1:15:41] 1958 after the fish incident in 1958 he
[1:15:45] says we were there in Vermont during the
[1:15:48] meetings and I wanted to take brother
[1:15:50] brother Fred over to where at that time
[1:15:53] it was the only time I was ever lost in
[1:15:55] the woods and I wanted to show brother
[1:15:58] Fred where my wife and Billy was waiting
[1:16:01] for me to come back when I was lost in
[1:16:03] that snowstorm that night and when we
[1:16:05] were standing there by the side of the
[1:16:07] little lint where I'd had M and Billy
[1:16:09] laying in this Linton when I was up
[1:16:11] hunting bear when we were standing there
[1:16:14] I stepped out to one side and the
[1:16:16] Lord this the spirit of the Lord says
[1:16:19] step out to the side and I stepped out
[1:16:21] to one side away from uh brother Fred
[1:16:25] and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me
[1:16:27] and I began to shake and the spirit of
[1:16:29] the Lord said there is a trap set for
[1:16:32] you be careful what thou
[1:16:41] sayest remember the transition that
[1:16:44] we're
[1:16:45] in he's experienced it with the fish
[1:16:48] this scripture is pulling on him and now
[1:16:51] God brings him back to a spefic specific
[1:16:59] location a specific location that is
[1:17:03] directly tied to the most humiliating
[1:17:07] time in his
[1:17:10] life and it's at this specific location
[1:17:14] that the Holy Spirit comes and says
[1:17:16] there's a trap laid for you be careful
[1:17:20] what you
[1:17:22] say I find this a in Saints I find this
[1:17:26] the grace of God because when BR if if
[1:17:29] ever brother brandham is going to catch
[1:17:31] a message from the Lord on
[1:17:34] humility God is orchestrating it so that
[1:17:37] he's at the place to where he was most
[1:17:40] humbled remember brother brandom said
[1:17:42] that that's that was you know he was
[1:17:45] part Indian and that's what his pride
[1:17:47] was is he considered himself a pretty
[1:17:49] good
[1:17:50] Woodsman but he had to come to a point
[1:17:52] to realize he wasn't a pretty good
[1:17:54] Woodsman he wasn't even a pretty good
[1:17:56] wisman like that was his last thread of
[1:17:59] Hope of being a
[1:18:01] man and God snatched that away from him
[1:18:04] you can't even walk in the woods without
[1:18:06] getting
[1:18:07] lost brings him back the best that I can
[1:18:11] tell that would have been sometime
[1:18:13] around
[1:18:15] 1941 this is
[1:18:18] 1958 you all do the math I can't do it
[1:18:20] right here several years later numerous
[1:18:23] years later after he was humbled brings
[1:18:26] him back to that specific location grace
[1:18:29] of God says come over to the side and
[1:18:33] warns him there's a trapla for you be
[1:18:34] careful what you
[1:18:37] say he says we got to the meeting that
[1:18:40] night and I said to the audience
[1:18:42] remember thus saith the Lord there is a
[1:18:44] trap set for me and all of you pray that
[1:18:46] I'll know what to do the right thing
[1:18:49] when this comes to
[1:18:53] pass I love
[1:18:56] this God comes and warns him there's a
[1:18:58] trap coming there's a trap laid for you
[1:19:01] he comes to the pull pit before the
[1:19:02] whole people and says there's a trap
[1:19:04] laid for me and I've got this I'll
[1:19:06] handle it don't you all
[1:19:08] worry no no no no he just came from
[1:19:12] Hurricane
[1:19:14] Mountain he knows he's not even a good
[1:19:17] Woodsman saints of God there's a trap
[1:19:19] laid for me please pray for me that I
[1:19:23] will handle it correctly please pray
[1:19:25] that I will know what to do see the
[1:19:29] change in the
[1:19:30] mindset see the
[1:19:35] humility and the next night it
[1:19:38] happened the devil sent two people a
[1:19:40] young boy and girl to break up the
[1:19:42] meeting and that was in Vermont they
[1:19:44] were both at least 25 years old a peace
[1:19:46] and when I started preaching he would
[1:19:47] just grab her and throw her head back
[1:19:49] and climb up on her and kiss her and
[1:19:50] Carry On and just act awful in the
[1:19:52] meetings and the ushers couldn't make
[1:19:54] him be quiet and I said to him from the
[1:19:56] platform I said young man don't do that
[1:19:58] you're attracting the attention while
[1:20:00] I'm preaching and he just laughed right
[1:20:01] out at me and I thought oh oh there it
[1:20:04] is there's the Trap right there and I
[1:20:07] went right ahead and speaking just the
[1:20:09] same and oh he got so immoral with her
[1:20:11] till I had to stop again and I said
[1:20:13] don't do that sir please I said if you
[1:20:15] want to make love to the young lady then
[1:20:17] you leave the building but this is a
[1:20:18] religious meeting and I said you
[1:20:20] shouldn't do that please don't do that
[1:20:22] while I'm preaching and I started again
[1:20:24] and he just made it worse and then when
[1:20:27] I said
[1:20:28] don't and something said to
[1:20:31] me say what you will and it'll be
[1:20:39] done this is actually the first
[1:20:46] opportunity of the spoken word now I'm
[1:20:49] not trying to confuse you but just
[1:20:51] understand what I said what I'm saying
[1:20:53] or where I'm coming from is the fish
[1:20:57] incident God told him specifically what
[1:21:00] to do what to say for what situation you
[1:21:03] understand what I'm saying same I'm not
[1:21:05] saying it's not the same power I'm just
[1:21:06] saying this is different because in that
[1:21:08] situation God said to him you speak to
[1:21:11] the fish and give it back I give it back
[1:21:13] its
[1:21:13] life amen now this is totally different
[1:21:17] because he says say what you
[1:21:20] will
[1:21:22] amen say what you will and it'll be
[1:21:27] done and I stood there the persperation
[1:21:30] just running from me something said say
[1:21:34] blindness it'll be blind say death and
[1:21:37] they'll pack them out say what you
[1:21:40] will and I couldn't speak and I couldn't
[1:21:44] move and then it just
[1:21:48] left and I thought God what must I
[1:21:51] do and I turned and he stood there
[1:21:54] speaking of the boy in the audience and
[1:21:56] his face white looking at me and I
[1:22:00] thought what must I
[1:22:02] say then I turned and looked like before
[1:22:05] I knowed what I
[1:22:06] said I said I forgive you of your act
[1:22:10] and it must have been just the right
[1:22:13] thing to
[1:22:14] say it was God trying a reaction on an
[1:22:19] action that night it was revealed to me
[1:22:22] that I'd said the right thing I I know
[1:22:24] it was all leading to something but what
[1:22:27] was it what to
[1:22:30] do you know you have to watch with a
[1:22:32] Divine gift what you do with it remember
[1:22:35] what Moses did so remember what Moses
[1:22:39] did he came down he broke the
[1:22:41] Tabernacles uh the tables he came down
[1:22:44] and he smoked the rock
[1:22:46] twice remember what Moses out of out of
[1:22:50] what you say well that was just his
[1:22:51] temper why did he have a temper right if
[1:22:54] it wasn't directly tied to Pride yeah
[1:22:57] that he thought the people should have
[1:22:59] been
[1:22:59] better and should they have
[1:23:02] absolutely but where was Moses before
[1:23:04] God got a hold of him I'm sure there
[1:23:07] were several times God thought about
[1:23:08] Moses you should have done better and he
[1:23:10] forgot that when he's dealing with these
[1:23:12] people yeah brother Brandon points that
[1:23:15] out he says you've got to watch what you
[1:23:17] do with the Divine gift remember
[1:23:20] Moses he says so I must have said the
[1:23:23] right thing I for give you for you know
[1:23:26] young John wanted to burn up Samaria one
[1:23:29] time because they wouldn't feed them
[1:23:31] Jesus says you don't know what kind of
[1:23:33] spirit you are yeah young John a type of
[1:23:37] the Young Bride have we ever wanted to
[1:23:39] burn up a city because they didn't feed
[1:23:41] us you put your own situation in there
[1:23:44] have we ever taken that attitude as as
[1:23:47] the Young
[1:23:49] Bride Jesus says you don't even know
[1:23:51] what Spirit you're of right
[1:23:56] the son of man came to save life not
[1:23:59] destroy
[1:24:00] it and them scriptures just kept pouring
[1:24:04] in all night so after this incident
[1:24:09] brother R says these scriptures just
[1:24:10] keep pouring in reminding him telling
[1:24:13] him you've done the right thing he said
[1:24:15] it was revealed to me that night I had
[1:24:17] made the right decision he says but that
[1:24:19] was a trap set that Satan would get me
[1:24:21] all worked up and then make me say the
[1:24:24] wrong thing Satan would get him all
[1:24:26] worked
[1:24:30] up how many times has Satan got us all
[1:24:32] worked
[1:24:33] up for 3 days prior to the conversation
[1:24:37] with our
[1:24:38] spouse just so we'll say the wrong thing
[1:24:41] Satan does not care how long he has to
[1:24:43] ride a white horse before he can get on
[1:24:45] a red one and before he can jump on a
[1:24:47] black he will ride a white horse and get
[1:24:50] you all tore up and all wound up that's
[1:24:54] right for 30 seconds to take the wrong
[1:24:58] attitude with your friend with your
[1:25:00] spouse with a minister with another
[1:25:03] brother right he will lay a
[1:25:08] trap he's not concerned how long it
[1:25:10] takes him to lay the trap he's concerned
[1:25:12] about the Trap going off and
[1:25:14] working
[1:25:19] right he says Satan would get me all
[1:25:22] worked up and then make me say the wrong
[1:25:26] thing but the Holy Spirit was there and
[1:25:30] told me beforehand to be careful what I
[1:25:33] said all the goodness of God how it was
[1:25:37] just his mercy be careful what you
[1:25:42] said this is what I referenced I think
[1:25:46] last service Saints we it is my goal and
[1:25:50] my ambition to be a mature Christian to
[1:25:54] walk in the way of the word to be
[1:25:55] pleasing to him to be yielded to his
[1:25:58] spirit and be uh Guided by his spirit
[1:26:01] and to do things right and I think that
[1:26:05] we should as the scripture says study to
[1:26:07] show ourselves approved we we should
[1:26:09] learn and we should grow and we should
[1:26:11] be mature but I will never never never
[1:26:15] come to the place to where I will say
[1:26:18] Lord I do not need your Supernatural
[1:26:20] intervention into my life to keep me
[1:26:22] from doing wrong right
[1:26:25] the farther along I go The More I Seek
[1:26:28] that because I realize the insufficiency
[1:26:32] and the inability for me to be mature
[1:26:35] enough to always get it
[1:26:37] right brother Brandon says that Satan
[1:26:40] had laid this trap to get them all
[1:26:43] worked up to make him say the wrong
[1:26:44] thing and the only thing that kept him
[1:26:46] from that was God coming to him by that
[1:26:49] little lintu where he had been
[1:26:51] humiliated years before and telling him
[1:26:54] there's a trap coming and saying be
[1:26:57] careful what you
[1:26:59] say God's supernaturally interjecting
[1:27:03] himself into his
[1:27:05] life I welcome that in my life and if
[1:27:08] that makes me look like an immature
[1:27:10] Christian and if that makes me look like
[1:27:12] I don't know a thing and I haven't got
[1:27:13] anything figured out and I cannot even
[1:27:15] behave myself accordingly then so be it
[1:27:17] but I will take him interjecting himself
[1:27:20] into my life
[1:27:22] supernaturally and holding my hand like
[1:27:25] a little baby and guiding me through a
[1:27:28] situation so that I will come out right
[1:27:30] rather than trying to figure it out
[1:27:32] myself and trying to press and do things
[1:27:34] that's right remember this is a third
[1:27:39] pull not a third leading myself this is
[1:27:44] a third pull let him pull us through
[1:27:49] this process let him pull us through
[1:27:52] each situation let's not try to figure
[1:27:54] it out and press our way into it press
[1:27:57] our way through our daily lives let him
[1:28:00] pull us through our daily
[1:28:06] life this situation we're going to
[1:28:10] listen to this on the
[1:28:13] tape
[1:28:14] because we can skim over this so easily
[1:28:17] and not grasp it but I want it was just
[1:28:21] really on my heart to actually listen to
[1:28:24] this
[1:28:26] situation because brother brandom says
[1:28:29] Satan would get me all worked up and
[1:28:30] make me say the wrong thing you when we
[1:28:32] listen to this you will be able to
[1:28:35] hear this is something that goes on for
[1:28:38] prolonged minutes brother brandom is
[1:28:41] finished preaching he's getting ready to
[1:28:43] call the prayer line and this is going
[1:28:46] on for several minutes and you can hear
[1:28:51] him address it and you can hear the
[1:28:53] frustration start building the Trap that
[1:28:56] Satan had laid to get him all worked up
[1:28:58] so that he would say this is not put on
[1:29:01] like oh hunky dory I'm here getting
[1:29:04] ready to call the you all behave
[1:29:05] yourself now stop it that's not no this
[1:29:08] is in the this is bearing on him the
[1:29:12] audience is aware of
[1:29:14] it the audience is noticing it's
[1:29:17] distracting from what he's trying to
[1:29:19] accomplish and he knows that it's
[1:29:21] grieving to the Holy Spirit and he knows
[1:29:22] he's got to do something but don't know
[1:29:24] what to
[1:29:26] do and it's
[1:29:30] remember this is
[1:29:36] Elijah this is the spirit of Elijah in
[1:29:39] this
[1:29:40] ministry the spirit of Elijah who would
[1:29:44] say you know let's build some altars
[1:29:46] let's see who's God and oh okay your God
[1:29:49] didn't answer now 400 of you are dead
[1:29:52] yeah
[1:29:56] this is
[1:30:00] Elisha go up old bald head go up all
[1:30:03] bald
[1:30:07] head didn't work out too good for
[1:30:10] him this is the see we can accept all of
[1:30:14] the good from Elijah and Elisha and this
[1:30:17] and the spirit that's to be used five
[1:30:19] times we can accept all of the good but
[1:30:22] remember the scripture says he was of
[1:30:23] like P just like me and you
[1:30:25] are there were things that had to be
[1:30:29] dealt with in the spirit of Elijah and
[1:30:31] the spirit of Elijah that were wrong but
[1:30:34] God never quit using that Ministry he
[1:30:36] would still use that but now something's
[1:30:39] going to
[1:30:40] change because where God wants to
[1:30:43] go that can't
[1:30:47] go the image that God is wanting to
[1:30:50] create with a final polishing down that
[1:30:54] aspect that was in Elijah and an
[1:30:56] Elisha can't go there anymore it can't
[1:30:59] be pulled through this
[1:31:01] filter so it's got to be dealt
[1:31:05] with so again this is
[1:31:08] 1958 May the e8th the message is
[1:31:12] expectations the whole thing is from
[1:31:15] paragraph 47- 66 we've drastically
[1:31:19] reduced that for time's sake with the
[1:31:22] help of brother Franco um I don't have
[1:31:24] to stand up here with a tape recorder
[1:31:26] fast forward and
[1:31:28] play so it's just on my heart I feel
[1:31:31] that we should listen to this pay very
[1:31:33] close attention and those listen to the
[1:31:35] message for sometimes pay attention to
[1:31:39] his tone of voice pay attention to his
[1:31:41] voice
[1:31:44] inflection I think it will do us some
[1:31:46] good this was
[1:31:51] not this was not a let me say it this
[1:31:54] way this was not a controlled
[1:31:58] situation even though we know God was in
[1:32:01] control in brother Brandon's
[1:32:04] shoes this was a real
[1:32:09] test very fluid situation what we would
[1:32:13] term in the law enforcement World
[1:32:15] immediate action
[1:32:17] required this was not let's sit down
[1:32:20] have a council figure this out how
[1:32:22] should we hand what what should
[1:32:25] do this was a real test we're going to
[1:32:29] go ahead and play
[1:32:34] this how many has been here at the
[1:32:37] previous meetings and seen the working
[1:32:40] of the Holy Spirit would you just raise
[1:32:42] your hands so that you thank you how

[1:32:48] you raise your hands and you say I'm
[1:32:50] here for my first time I very happy to
[1:32:53] have you tonight in here now I'm saying
[1:32:57] this before I start to pray for the sick
[1:33:00] if there would by chance be someone some
[1:33:03] person who is
[1:33:05] critical now I'm going to pause this and
[1:33:07] just make a couple comments here so he's
[1:33:09] finished his service he's getting ready
[1:33:11] to call the prayer
[1:33:12] line This spirit is already at work no
[1:33:16] doubt this boy and this girl is already
[1:33:20] either acting something out or the
[1:33:22] prophet has detected that Spirit there's
[1:33:26] no doubt about it this is a very
[1:33:29] uncommon statement for him to
[1:33:31] make I have to say this according to the
[1:33:34] law I am not responsible for what
[1:33:37] happens to them from this point
[1:33:40] on now if you're here and you would not
[1:33:44] be reverent I am asking you now when

[1:34:26] trap but God will deal with that

[1:35:36] young couple stop
[1:35:39] that or go out of the building suit
[1:35:42] yourself the god of heaven will curse
[1:35:44] you
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:55] I do not know
[1:35:57] you someday we'll stand in the
[1:36:03] Judgment saints of God that was
[1:36:07] 1958 60 some plus years
[1:36:12] ago I am a
[1:36:14] believer I'm on his
[1:36:17] side and that still terrifies me
[1:36:23] this was not plain
[1:36:26] Church did you notice how long the
[1:36:29] silence was before he spoke to
[1:36:36] them I don't know what was going through
[1:36:39] brother bram's
[1:36:41] mind but that was a long silence
[1:36:55] when
[1:36:56] he says stop it go out of the building
[1:36:59] suit yourself the god of heaven will
[1:37:01] curse
[1:37:06] you he is
[1:37:08] still in the middle of this
[1:37:13] test and please I say this with the
[1:37:16] utmost
[1:37:18] respect but at this point
[1:37:24] he is
[1:37:26] prone to say the wrong
[1:37:30] thing listen to the tone of his voice
[1:37:33] listen to the statement that he made
[1:37:35] there is no mercy in this
[1:37:39] statement none he has already given the
[1:37:43] warning and told them if you're going to
[1:37:45] be disrespectful and irreverent leave
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:48] building they've escalated things
[1:37:54] and
[1:37:55] now he said these things this was not
[1:37:58] done in a quarter I warned the audience
[1:38:00] about this last night there's a trap
[1:38:01] blade for me God will deal with that
[1:38:03] enemy yeah
[1:38:06] right not Mercy in that
[1:38:10] statement I don't want to speak for the
[1:38:12] prophet I don't want to say what was in
[1:38:14] his mind but based on what I know about
[1:38:16] the English language and voice
[1:38:18] inflection and tone of voice when he's
[1:38:20] saying God will deal with that enemy
[1:38:22] he's not saying God's going to come down
[1:38:23] and cuddle
[1:38:27] them they escalate things
[1:38:31] farther and finally it gets to the point
[1:38:34] that he stops everything there's this
[1:38:37] horrendously long uncomfortable
[1:38:43] silence stop that or get out of the
[1:38:45] building suit yourself the god of heaven
[1:38:48] will curse
[1:38:50] you where is he veering to Saints
[1:38:53] he's veering the way of Elijah he's
[1:38:56] veering the way of Elisha he's getting
[1:38:59] ready to call the she
[1:39:03] Bears I don't say these things lightly I
[1:39:05] don't want to put myself in a position
[1:39:07] that I'm not authority to be in but this
[1:39:11] I believe this is what the spirit of God
[1:39:12] is
[1:39:14] saying this is where he's veering
[1:39:19] to and then he says that and there's
[1:39:23] another horrifically
[1:39:25] long horrifically long uncomfortable
[1:39:29] silence and he says I don't know who you
[1:39:31] are but we'll stand in the Judgment
[1:39:34] together
[1:39:35] someday see where his mind is going see
[1:39:37] where his words are going see what he's
[1:39:40] prone to do
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:56] it happened to be that a blessing came
[1:39:58] to the lady with glasses on there at the
[1:39:59] brown coat on who suffering there with
[1:40:02] heart trouble sitting right here looks
[1:40:04] around do you believe the Lord God will
[1:40:05] make you well my sister and have what
[1:40:07] you have asked for if you believe don't
[1:40:14] now just have faith now pray believe
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:27] you are trying to believe sitting there
[1:40:29] on the end of the seat you walk with a
[1:40:31] king it's because part of your foot's
[1:40:34] been taken
[1:40:36] off that is true I don't know you have
[1:40:39] never seen you but that's the truth
[1:40:41] raise up your hand if that's true if
[1:40:44] you'll believe God with all your heart
[1:40:46] you can go out without your can in
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:49] support what did she touch sitting there
[1:40:53] what
[1:40:55] happened what was it rebuked a young
[1:40:58] couple and blessed a aged
[1:41:01] woman now young man are you go to miam
[1:41:04] me young lady you're interfering with
[1:41:06] the Holy Spirit I'm warning you before
[1:41:09] it takes
[1:41:10] place either behave or the Usher will
[1:41:13] come and see that you can go out for the
[1:41:15] police one back
[1:41:17] there now you're in a religious service
[1:41:19] which is 2 years for disturbing it are
[1:41:22] you behave
[1:41:26] not at this time
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:31] officer are there any tones of Mercy in
[1:41:35] those
[1:41:37] statements he says what would heal this
[1:41:40] one and rebuke this young
[1:41:44] couple you can you can hear the detest
[1:41:47] in his voice and since I'm not saying
[1:41:49] this in a judgmental way I would have
[1:41:50] failed the test the first minute
[1:41:54] I mean I'm just being
[1:41:56] honest like if I see somebody sleeping
[1:41:58] in church I don't even have to be
[1:42:00] preaching and I'm W to call fire down
[1:42:02] out of heaven like maybe not to consume
[1:42:04] them but just you know light a little
[1:42:05] fire under
[1:42:07] them so I'm not saying this in a
[1:42:10] judgmental kind of
[1:42:13] way yeah they would have been packed out
[1:42:16] of there if I would have been standing
[1:42:19] there or at the very least the policeman
[1:42:23] that were there would have already
[1:42:24] yanked them out of their seats and had
[1:42:25] them gone oh yeah and I we laugh at that
[1:42:29] you know but I say that to my
[1:42:32] embarrassment like I shouldn't be that
[1:42:33] way that's right that wasn't our example
[1:42:37] but I'm just being honest like I I I
[1:42:40] would like to think where I'm at now in
[1:42:42] the mindset that he's given me now and
[1:42:45] the Revelation that he's instilled in my
[1:42:47] heart now now I would you know make it a
[1:42:49] little longer down the trail before I
[1:42:51] would be rain and fire and brim stand
[1:42:54] down I'm I'm not about to say that I
[1:42:56] would handle it perfect yet I I know by
[1:42:59] his grace I'll get
[1:43:01] there but I'm just being honest so when
[1:43:03] I'm making these statements please you
[1:43:04] know we're sitting 60 some years
[1:43:07] away listening to a tape recording we
[1:43:09] can pause and move and we can judge and
[1:43:12] see and what this is real to him this is
[1:43:16] firing off this is happening this is
[1:43:19] spiritual warfare at its peak with an
[1:43:21] audience right
[1:43:24] but because he was so humble and he
[1:43:25] would come and he would tell us the
[1:43:27] truth about these things we can properly
[1:43:29] discern and see and I I feel that he
[1:43:32] would say the same thing well he did say
[1:43:33] the same thing he said I would have done
[1:43:35] wrong if it wasn't for the spirit of God
[1:43:37] coming on the
[1:43:38] scene so I'm I'm not saying this in a
[1:43:40] judgment way I'm just pointing out the
[1:43:43] fact look where this ship is turning
[1:43:45] look the road it's getting ready to go
[1:43:47] down it's it's going there and it's
[1:43:49] going there hard but now all of a sudden
[1:43:52] he says you stop it you've already we've
[1:43:55] already been rebuked you've already been
[1:43:57] warned you either stop it or the ushers
[1:44:00] are going to deal with you or the police
[1:44:01] are going to deal with you but
[1:44:04] now now something happens and he says
[1:44:09] not at this time
[1:44:11] officers
[1:44:14] why why like you all should be fired for
[1:44:18] d d elction of Duty you should have
[1:44:20] dealt with that 5 minutes ago
[1:44:23] but now he said not at this time
[1:44:27] officers some something
[1:44:30] shifted something has
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:41] shifted you believe God would heal that
[1:44:43] stomach trouble for
[1:44:45] you you're believing that's the reason
[1:44:47] you stood you're believing now the
[1:44:50] reason that I told you last night before
[1:44:52] it come to pass how many was here last
[1:44:55] night that heard me say Satan has done
[1:44:58] some evil has set a trap for me and I
[1:45:00] don't know how to handle it how many
[1:45:02] remembers that it was a young man and
[1:45:04] young woman sitting
[1:45:07] there to curse them they go blind or be
[1:45:11] paralyzed the hold my peace they
[1:45:14] live I before it come to pass I'm
[1:45:17] sparing you
[1:45:23] hard left turn hard left turn getting
[1:45:26] ready to call the she Bears getting
[1:45:27] ready to pronounce judgment getting
[1:45:29] ready to pronounce a
[1:45:30] curse and the break
[1:45:33] Screech God not at this time officers
[1:45:37] now to you that were in the meeting last
[1:45:38] night
[1:45:40] you tell me God didn't come and prick
[1:45:42] his
[1:45:44] memory tell me God did not come and
[1:45:48] supernaturally interject and refresh his
[1:45:51] memory there was a trap lead for you be
[1:45:53] careful what you
[1:45:57] say he declares that to the
[1:46:00] people and then he
[1:46:02] says to curse them they'd go blind or
[1:46:05] paralyzed
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:08] if if I hold my
[1:46:13] peace if I hold my peace
[1:46:23] they'll
[1:46:25] live I wasn't there I can't say for
[1:46:27] certain but I would venture to say this
[1:46:29] is the part where brother Brandon says
[1:46:31] that young man was looking at him and
[1:46:32] his face was
[1:46:34] white he's
[1:46:36] recognized I've went too far I've done
[1:46:40] something that I
[1:46:41] shouldn't I'm now falling into the hands
[1:46:44] of a living
[1:46:48] God he says to curse them that go blind
[1:46:50] or be paralyzed if I hold my peace they
[1:46:56] live there's no hesitation there's no
[1:47:00] long uncomfortable
[1:47:02] silence he immediately once he
[1:47:05] recognizes the situation recognizes this
[1:47:08] was the Trap recognizes I got to be
[1:47:10] careful what I say if I curse them
[1:47:12] they'll be paralyzed they'll go blind
[1:47:15] but if I hold my peace they'll live I'm
[1:47:18] sparing you immediately immediately
[1:47:22] moves into
[1:47:26] Mercy now before it come to pass I'm
[1:47:29] sparing
[1:47:32] you there's no hesitation Saints once
[1:47:35] God pricked his memory prior to that
[1:47:39] it's a man standing there trying to wrap
[1:47:42] his mind about how do I handle this what
[1:47:45] do I do this is a man under frustration
[1:47:49] how in the world can they be doing that
[1:47:51] do they not respect God how is this even
[1:47:54] possible this is so ridiculous
[1:47:56] frustrated genuinely frustrated already
[1:47:59] warned them already told them they're
[1:48:01] going to be cursed of God no effect on
[1:48:06] them this was not a fake test like he
[1:48:09] was faking like he really wasn't
[1:48:13] frustrated this was as real as it
[1:48:16] gets but I find it astounding as long as
[1:48:19] it's taking him to work his way through
[1:48:22] this
[1:48:23] and again we've cut out minutes of this
[1:48:27] process as long as it's Tak him to work
[1:48:31] his way through this and the frustration
[1:48:33] is building Satan had laid that trap to
[1:48:35] get him all worked up and it worked he
[1:48:38] was all worked
[1:48:39] up but the
[1:48:43] second the very second that God Pricks
[1:48:47] his memory do this is what I was talking
[1:48:50] about and be careful what you
[1:48:54] say I ventured to say he remembered
[1:48:56] where he was standing when God told him
[1:48:59] that and he remembered I'm not even a
[1:49:01] Woodsman if God wouldn't help
[1:49:03] me immediately moves into
[1:49:07] Mercy tells the officers not right
[1:49:10] now few sentences later immediately
[1:49:14] moves into Mercy tells them that I'm
[1:49:16] going to spare
[1:49:18] you you people believe that God is your
[1:49:22] not do you that sick bow your heads just
[1:49:24] a moment for prayer believe you hear
[1:49:27] with all your heart the Holy Spirit who
[1:49:29] is near Eternal and blessed God who
[1:49:33] roared from Mount siia you who spoke
[1:49:36] through the Apostle Peter and told
[1:49:38] ananas
[1:49:39] Andi why did you do this to the Holy
[1:49:43] Spirit just because his voice
[1:49:47] spoke one fell dead and the other and
[1:49:49] was packed out in a little bit you're
[1:49:52] still God but you're full of mercy and
[1:49:55] it was foretold to these people before
[1:49:57] it come to pass that they might know
[1:49:59] that your servant tells the truth now
[1:50:02] Eternal God be merciful and Grant
[1:50:05] tonight that as the enemy sent this
[1:50:06] young couple in that you'll forgive
[1:50:08] their
[1:50:09] sins that they will not be harmed but
[1:50:12] you will forgive them you come to spare
[1:50:14] the life of man but the Holy Spirit has
[1:50:17] Sent His blessings to heal the people
[1:50:18] just the same Your Grace has overrode it
[1:50:22] but now the people will know and the
[1:50:23] young couple knows that I had nothing to
[1:50:25] do with them coming here but told the
[1:50:27] night before of their being here now
[1:50:30] Lord God I pray thee to be merciful to
[1:50:33] those who are standing who are sick and
[1:50:35] Afflicted may the great Holy Spirit Come
[1:50:38] into their hearts just now into their
[1:50:41] bodies and let them know that the God
[1:50:43] who lived in the New Testament is alive
[1:50:46] tonight that it is foretold then comes
[1:50:49] to pass and all things are done perfect
[1:50:51] and true through through the Holy Spirit
[1:50:53] we found it so and we love you Lord
[1:50:56] Jesus because that you have loved us and
[1:50:59] has washed us in your blood and has made
[1:51:01] us your children thank you Father for
[1:51:04] these things and we now rebuke the devil
[1:51:06] of sickness from the people that he'll
[1:51:09] depart from them and they may all be
[1:51:11] made well in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:15] Christ all that believe and accept your
[1:51:18] healing from God stand to your feet just
[1:51:21] now as you except without one Shadow of
[1:51:24] Doubt feeling in your heart that God has
[1:51:26] healed you how you ought to give thanks
[1:51:29] to God the Bible said when something
[1:51:32] like this taken place in the Bible time
[1:51:34] there was fear fell on all the people
[1:51:36] throughout all the
[1:51:38] regions what do you think
[1:51:40] tonight I say praise the Lord I say
[1:51:43] praise the Lord for his overriding grace
[1:51:46] and
[1:51:48] mercy because without
[1:51:51] that with without that he would have
[1:51:54] went down the wrong
[1:51:56] road without that they would have been
[1:52:01] cursed now I just want you to think for
[1:52:03] a second remember God is bringing the
[1:52:07] prophet through a process and he's
[1:52:09] bringing him to this point he's brought
[1:52:12] he's pulling on him with this scripture
[1:52:14] of Mark 11 he's already seen it manifest
[1:52:17] that I have the power of God in my
[1:52:19] tongue when he tells me to speak and say
[1:52:21] something that's the way it'll be he
[1:52:22] gave that fish his life back he knows
[1:52:25] see it wouldn't have been a real test if
[1:52:27] he wouldn't have truly known what I say
[1:52:29] is going to come to pass so God had to
[1:52:32] demonstrate to him beforehand you really
[1:52:34] do have this power yeah you understand
[1:52:37] what I'm saying it's it's not a bluff
[1:52:39] yeah right it can only be a real test if
[1:52:43] he knows I can handle this and deal with
[1:52:45] this and when he's told me CU he the the
[1:52:48] Holy Spirit has told him whatever you
[1:52:51] say right yeah that's the way it'll be
[1:52:54] and he knows that'll work right so this
[1:52:58] is a real test it's not well you know
[1:53:01] I'll deal with it this way cuz I don't
[1:53:03] know if it will you know really happen
[1:53:05] if I say it oh no he
[1:53:07] knows but I want you to think of this
[1:53:11] God's been molding his
[1:53:14] character through the incidents that he
[1:53:17] suffered with losing his wife and his
[1:53:19] baby by not listening to God's voice and
[1:53:21] going out the first time
[1:53:23] multiple other things just even his
[1:53:25] childhood how this man was
[1:53:28] broken comes up to he's got one last
[1:53:32] thread of decency and manhood about him
[1:53:36] that I'm still a pretty good Woodsman
[1:53:38] and God snatches that away from
[1:53:43] him and now he's standing in a position
[1:53:47] that God Almighty has says whatever you
[1:53:49] speak to these people that's the way
[1:53:51] it'll be
[1:53:54] there's
[1:53:56] people that have forgotten that he
[1:53:59] forgave these two
[1:54:01] people how many people even the
[1:54:04] naysayers of brother brandom's message
[1:54:07] even in that time how many people do you
[1:54:10] think would have forgot if there was a
[1:54:13] man that was standing behind the pull
[1:54:14] pit and two people were being
[1:54:16] disrespectful and he says I curse you
[1:54:19] and you shall die and they'll pack you
[1:54:20] out and it happened yeah
[1:54:24] right think of The
[1:54:27] credibility that that gives to your
[1:54:30] ministry Peter did it one time and it's
[1:54:32] written in the word of God and it says
[1:54:34] the whole region roundabout said I ain't
[1:54:36] going to church there no no no they
[1:54:38] don't play Church
[1:54:41] there you see what God had to strip from
[1:54:45] him before he even got to this point
[1:54:49] amen and you see the truth
[1:54:53] humility where he's at no doubt he had
[1:54:57] people chirping on his shoulders oh it's
[1:54:59] mind reading it's this it's this was a
[1:55:02] real man in real life going through real
[1:55:05] struggles and real people attacking his
[1:55:07] ministry and now he's got a chance to as
[1:55:10] they say to Silence the
[1:55:15] Critics I think people nowadays would be
[1:55:18] a lot less likely to say anything wrong
[1:55:21] against his ministry
[1:55:22] had he said they'll pack you out of
[1:55:26] here because you got a whole audience
[1:55:28] full of people hundreds of people no
[1:55:31] doubt there's nobody going to dispute
[1:55:33] this like you can say I forgive
[1:55:39] you okay y where's the
[1:55:44] manifestation where's the manifestation
[1:55:47] you say they'll pack you out of here you
[1:55:49] don't have to wonder where the
[1:55:51] manifestation is at you don't have to
[1:55:52] wonder whether he was faking it you
[1:55:54] don't have to wonder where whether he
[1:55:56] was telling the truth but now here's a
[1:55:58] man in the proper character in the
[1:56:01] proper position that he's not going to
[1:56:04] worry about sealing his credibility of
[1:56:07] his ministry he's more concerned about
[1:56:10] God finishing the polishing on him he's
[1:56:14] not concerned about spreading his
[1:56:17] influence outside of this situation he's
[1:56:20] dealing with he's not concerned about
[1:56:23] his worldwide Ministry and his ministry
[1:56:26] and that influence and how he may be
[1:56:28] looked at as a bishop well that's Bishop
[1:56:31] number one of pronounce you dead if you
[1:56:33] disrespect me in the meetings right he's
[1:56:36] not looking for that
[1:56:40] title he's standing there he says
[1:56:44] trembling sweating praying to God what
[1:56:48] do I say and how do I handle this right
[1:56:51] yes amen this is a man that's been on
[1:56:54] Hurricane Mountain
[1:56:57] yeah and knew that he needed
[1:57:00] mercy and he didn't forget that you see
[1:57:04] the process and the years that God Drew
[1:57:08] him through to get to this point release
[1:57:12] the power of the spoken word to heal the
[1:57:14] fish to let him know that it was true it
[1:57:16] was accurate pulling on him with this
[1:57:19] Mark 11 scripture and now
[1:57:22] now there's just one small
[1:57:26] problem and this
[1:57:28] problem was approximately
[1:57:31] 2900 years
[1:57:36] ago a problem one problem 2900 years ago
[1:57:42] that God has to deal with before he can
[1:57:46] move into the third pole the final
[1:57:50] pole and that
[1:57:52] problem was a prophet who got angry and
[1:57:56] said what he wanted to say instead of
[1:57:58] what God wanted to say
[1:58:02] yes you say well you know whatever 2900
[1:58:06] years that's just three days to God of
[1:58:08] course he would remember
[1:58:10] that
[1:58:14] seriously
[1:58:15] 2900 years ago a flaw in the spirit of
[1:58:19] Elijah's character
[1:58:22] and God
[1:58:23] says I have got to deal with that
[1:58:27] because this ministry this man this
[1:58:30] vessel is the vessel that I'm literally
[1:58:33] going to step into as the lamb and pull
[1:58:38] the seals off of the book and I cannot
[1:58:42] understand what I'm saying God's not
[1:58:43] taking a chance but I cannot take a
[1:58:46] chance that when I put the power of the
[1:58:50] spoken word the the creative spoken word
[1:58:54] on his tongue that he will even
[1:58:56] interject himself slightly I've got to
[1:58:59] deal with this one I know it was 2900
[1:59:02] years ago but I've got to make sure
[1:59:04] that's not going to rise up at the
[1:59:06] inopportune
[1:59:10] time I'm going to make a really drastic
[1:59:14] statement not
[1:59:18] Doctrine but I'm going to go here to 19
[1:59:22] 58 May the
[1:59:26] e8th
[1:59:28] paragraph 63 how fetting 63 and he says
[1:59:33] now before it comes to pass I'm sparing
[1:59:38] you may the 8th
[1:59:41] 1958 paragraph
[1:59:43] 63 is literally the hinging
[1:59:47] point of whether the lamb can come and
[1:59:49] break the seals or not
[1:59:52] it's the hinging point because if he
[1:59:55] doesn't pass this test the lamb cannot
[1:59:58] step into this
[1:59:59] vessel what if he comes to the first
[2:00:02] seal and says
[2:00:05] well I don't know what it is but I think
[2:00:08] it's right we're done me and you would
[2:00:12] not be sitting
[2:00:14] here if he comes to these seals being
[2:00:17] loose and he and he doesn't know for
[2:00:20] certainty that I have to to wait for God
[2:00:23] himself to come and speak this word out
[2:00:26] of
[2:00:27] me if I can interject anything of me
[2:00:31] into this me and you are
[2:00:34] doomed we cannot come into the full
[2:00:36] image of Christ amen and remember the
[2:00:40] seals were just not the interpretation
[2:00:41] of the symbols the seals were the
[2:00:43] release of the spirit of God to us it
[2:00:46] was the full not a partial dip but this
[2:00:50] this was the fullness of the spirit of
[2:00:52] God they asked brother random the
[2:00:54] question now that this has been released
[2:00:57] could you come and speak the word over
[2:00:59] somebody and instantly put them into
[2:01:01] rapturing condition and he says
[2:01:04] yes that's right amen amen what has he
[2:01:07] done to us Saints has not the word that
[2:01:11] he has came and spoken over top of us
[2:01:14] put us into rapturing
[2:01:19] condition that would have never happened
[2:01:22] happened if he would have said anything
[2:01:24] else in paragraph
[2:01:28] 63 this was the liftoff point because
[2:01:33] now God has rectified and it wasn't to
[2:01:36] say that brother brandham didn't have
[2:01:38] issues coming up in his life that he
[2:01:40] made mistakes and God had to deal with
[2:01:41] him but we're talking about a issue that
[2:01:44] was 2900 years ago in the spirit of
[2:01:47] Elijah that God is wanting to use to
[2:01:50] fulfill his
[2:01:52] Ministry he's got to root that out of
[2:01:55] there he's got to expose that and he's
[2:01:58] got to get that out of there to go where
[2:02:00] he wants to
[2:02:08] go and the test was real just like mine
[2:02:11] and your test is
[2:02:15] real it wasn't a fake test it wasn't an
[2:02:17] easy test for the prophet and we're
[2:02:19] coming to a close if you'll just bear
[2:02:21] with me for a couple more minutes but
[2:02:22] this is the main thing that I wanted to
[2:02:24] present to
[2:02:25] you brother Rand says it's just the way
[2:02:29] you say things
[2:02:31] sometimes that changes
[2:02:36] everything how many in here would agree
[2:02:38] that the prophet had the literal power
[2:02:41] of the spoken word reinstated to his
[2:02:46] tongue but what about Revelation
[2:02:48] 108 what do we have on our tongue
[2:02:52] if we're saying what he said what do we
[2:03:00] have the issue is not whether we have it
[2:03:04] or not yes we've got it amen the issue
[2:03:10] is how are we going to say
[2:03:14] it are we
[2:03:16] going to skip over the son of man
[2:03:20] Ministry who was sent to the world to
[2:03:22] save lives and go right to the white
[2:03:24] Throne judgment if you don't believe
[2:03:26] this you're doomed you're dead you're
[2:03:27] going to hell you don't see it my way
[2:03:31] you don't stand a
[2:03:32] chance are we going to skip over
[2:03:37] that that's what a young John
[2:03:39] did that's what a Young Bride did
[2:03:44] yes right somebody raised up in
[2:03:46] contention to him well I'll just call
[2:03:48] fire down out of Heaven I'll fix your
[2:03:50] problem yes brother R says A young John
[2:03:53] did that I don't want to be a young John
[2:03:57] amen I want to be a mature
[2:04:00] John I want to be a John that's been to
[2:04:03] the a of
[2:04:05] patmas I want to be a John that's been
[2:04:08] to Hurricane
[2:04:09] Mountain to realize without him I can't
[2:04:13] even
[2:04:14] walk
[2:04:17] properly I want to be a a a mature John
[2:04:22] who's not flippant with my
[2:04:25] tongue I just ask you this question
[2:04:29] Saints we would agree that at this
[2:04:32] juncture in time May the eth 1957
[2:04:35] paragraph
[2:04:36] 63 There was a lot hinging on what came
[2:04:40] out of that man's
[2:04:43] mouth why do we think we're any
[2:04:46] different yes we're in the closing
[2:04:50] moments of time
[2:04:53] if God would deal with something 2900
[2:04:57] years ago before he would move on to
[2:05:01] into a third poll with his Prophet how
[2:05:04] do we think we're going to get by with
[2:05:06] making flippant statements that's based
[2:05:08] on our
[2:05:11] pride just little statement here a
[2:05:13] little statement there protecting oursel
[2:05:15] here protecting our reputation there
[2:05:17] saying something will make me just to
[2:05:18] look a little bit better little more
[2:05:20] spiritual
[2:05:23] if God didn't wink at it for 2900 years
[2:05:28] and came back and dealt with it do we
[2:05:31] think he's going to give us a
[2:05:33] pass if we've got a speck of it laying
[2:05:35] in our
[2:05:37] heart no he's going to come and deal
[2:05:39] with it amen because the image that he
[2:05:42] has saw is a perfect image without spot
[2:05:47] without wrinkle and he is not a man that
[2:05:50] should lie yeah it's going to be as he
[2:05:55] said so I wanted to play that and I hope
[2:05:58] you could grasp
[2:05:59] that and I feel that you caught when he
[2:06:03] went into
[2:06:04] prayer do you hear the tone of his voice
[2:06:09] change this is a fearful thing
[2:06:13] Saints this was not a man playing
[2:06:16] around this was a man speaking in place
[2:06:19] of God
[2:06:22] totally changed his voice
[2:06:27] structure as you roared from Mount
[2:06:32] Si but he moves into mercy and over in
[2:06:37] this short prayer over and over again he
[2:06:39] says be merciful to them he doesn't just
[2:06:41] spare them one time now he comes and
[2:06:43] starts interceding for them that's Lord
[2:06:46] once again be merciful to them don't let
[2:06:48] them be harmed don't let them be touched
[2:06:49] be merciful thank you for your writing
[2:06:52] Grace be merciful to them amen not just
[2:06:56] once but once he caught it once he knew
[2:06:58] where he was at once he recognized the
[2:07:00] test once he knew what needed to be done
[2:07:02] once he knew I got to be careful what I
[2:07:04] say then when he lays on Mercy he lays
[2:07:06] it on thick prise
[2:07:10] why because he'd been to Hurricane
[2:07:13] Mountain and he knew that without Mercy
[2:07:16] in his life he never stood a chance am
[2:07:19] and now he knows that I'm just going to
[2:07:23] extend as much Mercy as I
[2:07:25] needed see once you have yourself
[2:07:28] readjusted once you have a proper
[2:07:30] standard once you recognize that you're
[2:07:32] nothing but 87 cents worth of
[2:07:35] dust it's easy to have
[2:07:37] mercy you know the problem the only
[2:07:41] problem with having grace and mercy for
[2:07:44] somebody is if you think of yourself a
[2:07:46] little more highly than you ought
[2:07:48] to amen cuz the only reason you wouldn't
[2:07:52] extend grace and mercy to
[2:07:54] somebody is if you think they don't
[2:07:56] deserve it and the only way that you can
[2:07:58] come to that conclusion is if you've
[2:08:00] already lifted yourself up into some
[2:08:02] type of position that you don't belong
[2:08:03] in as a
[2:08:06] judge so the way and why would you do
[2:08:09] that if it wasn't based on Pride
[2:08:13] amen but we've had a wave sheath
[2:08:16] come to demonstrate to
[2:08:20] us where we're to come to we don't live
[2:08:23] in the Days of Elijah anymore the actual
[2:08:25] man Elijah we don't live in the days of
[2:08:27] Elisha anymore we're calling the she
[2:08:29] Bears out is
[2:08:32] okay but as Jesus
[2:08:37] said why was the son of man sent to
[2:08:39] Earth Saints why was this message the
[2:08:42] person of this message sent to
[2:08:45] Earth to save life to save me and you
[2:08:49] you say well yeah but it's going to
[2:08:51] condemn all the den it's going to
[2:08:52] condemn all that's on them that wasn't
[2:08:55] the purpose that the scripture says that
[2:08:58] they condemn themselves cuz they believe
[2:09:00] not you know light came into the world
[2:09:02] and they they walked in darkness that's
[2:09:04] on them that wasn't the purpose amen the
[2:09:08] purpose of him coming was to give us
[2:09:12] life
[2:09:15] amen what should our purpose be
[2:09:19] yeah what should our purpose be to our
[2:09:23] brothers and sisters to other assemblies
[2:09:25] to the people we associate with and
[2:09:32] work what should our motivation
[2:09:36] be and again as our pastor taught us a
[2:09:40] couple Services ago this is not a
[2:09:42] wishy-washy oh I can't say anything to
[2:09:44] offend anybody no this is a sheep being
[2:09:47] led by the dove yes that's right if
[2:09:50] there need
[2:09:51] fire called down out of Heaven call it
[2:09:54] down but don't be sitting in a seat of
[2:09:57] judgment thinking there ought to be fire
[2:09:59] called down out of
[2:10:01] Heaven that's the problem remember where
[2:10:04] you were at maybe in a worse situation
[2:10:07] than what this person is that you're
[2:10:08] wanting to judge them for because you've
[2:10:10] been walking in the message for a couple
[2:10:15] years remember where you came from
[2:10:19] remember I'm preaching at you again I'm
[2:10:21] preaching and really preaching at me
[2:10:22] remember where I came
[2:10:25] from when I needed some help when I
[2:10:28] needed some Grace when I needed some
[2:10:33] mercy now there were people and
[2:10:35] Ministries in my life that came and
[2:10:37] called some fire and brimstone down on
[2:10:38] me and I needed it I was deserving of it
[2:10:42] there were things that needed to be said
[2:10:44] to prick my
[2:10:45] heart there's nothing wrong with saying
[2:10:47] something to prick somebody's heart or
[2:10:49] to expose to them that they're wrong
[2:10:52] it's how you do it that
[2:10:56] matters let's not act out of Pride let's
[2:10:59] not act out of arrogance because we've
[2:11:02] got the truth we're message Believers we
[2:11:05] know we know who the prophet is you're a
[2:11:07] heathen you don't even know God sent a
[2:11:10] prophet well did you come out of the
[2:11:13] womb knowing God sent a prophet I mean
[2:11:16] there was probably one day that somebody
[2:11:19] told you that God sent a prophet and he
[2:11:21] had some truth that you hadn't heard
[2:11:28] about I'm I'm not trying to come off too
[2:11:31] hard on that Saints it's just I'm really
[2:11:34] really frustrated at myself that
[2:11:36] somehow from 16 15 16 years of age to 39
[2:11:40] years of age I lost
[2:11:42] that so if you pick up on frustration or
[2:11:45] hardness it's not towards you it's
[2:11:47] towards me like how as the scripture
[2:11:50] says how do we take the Beau this
[2:11:52] beautiful
[2:11:53] Revelation and come to a wrong
[2:11:55] conclusion with it how do we start out
[2:11:59] in pure humility and somehow come 20
[2:12:02] some years later and we've lost that yes
[2:12:07] where did it
[2:12:08] go what
[2:12:10] happened that's not
[2:12:13] acceptable so it's not hardness towards
[2:12:16] you it's it's hardness towards me I want
[2:12:18] to read just a couple scriptures and
[2:12:19] then we're going to close if the
[2:12:20] musician would
[2:12:23] come 2 Kings
[2:12:25] 2:23 this is about Elisha and he went up
[2:12:28] from then un bethl and as he was going
[2:12:29] up by the way there came forth little
[2:12:31] children out of the city and mocked him
[2:12:32] and said unto him go up thou Baldhead go
[2:12:35] up thou
[2:12:36] Baldhead these were children who were
[2:12:39] referencing the Rapture of
[2:12:43] Elijah oh you're following Elijah well
[2:12:46] go on up old Wellhead go on
[2:12:48] uphead like Elisha could been like well
[2:12:51] I'm not angry even for myself they're
[2:12:54] insulting my
[2:12:58] prophet he could have so I don't know
[2:13:01] how he justified
[2:13:03] it but he may have had in his mind
[2:13:06] justification for doing this well I'm
[2:13:08] not upset about myself I don't care what
[2:13:10] they say about my reputation I am bald
[2:13:11] you know who cares but you know you're
[2:13:13] making fun of Elijah my Prophet Elijah
[2:13:15] who was raptured well come on she
[2:13:19] Bears see there's so many ways
[2:13:22] that a man can reason these things away
[2:13:25] but ultimately at the end of the day the
[2:13:26] voice is going to come walking in the
[2:13:27] garden it's going to reveal to us that
[2:13:29] we're naked even though we think we're
[2:13:30] clothed
[2:13:32] yes it's going to stick us up on a
[2:13:34] mountain somewhere where we thought we
[2:13:35] was a good Woodsman and configure a way
[2:13:37] around and realize you know what I don't
[2:13:38] stand a chance here I'm lost I need some
[2:13:44] help brother random says this was not
[2:13:46] the will of God for Elisha to do this he
[2:13:49] says it was an angry prophet
[2:13:54] the other scripture that he referenced
[2:13:55] was Luke 9:46 then there arose arose a
[2:13:58] reasoning among
[2:14:00] them um which of them should be the
[2:14:02] greatest so this is the disciples
[2:14:04] walking along and this is their mindset
[2:14:06] that they're in which of us is the
[2:14:14] greatest and Jesus perceiving the
[2:14:17] thought of their heart took a child and
[2:14:19] set him by him and said to them
[2:14:21] whosoever shall receive this child in my
[2:14:23] name receiveth me and whosoever shall
[2:14:25] receive me receiveth him that sent me
[2:14:27] for he that is least among you all the
[2:14:29] same shall be
[2:14:33] great this is the mindset the disciples
[2:14:36] were in and Jesus perceives it in his
[2:14:38] heart and tries to correct
[2:14:43] it and John answered and said Master we
[2:14:46] saw one casting out devils in thy name
[2:14:48] and we forbid him because he followed
[2:14:49] not with us
[2:14:52] I don't think he caught it I don't think
[2:14:55] I don't think Young John got the
[2:14:59] message Jesus said forbid him not for he
[2:15:04] that is not against us is for
[2:15:07] us and it came to pass when the time was
[2:15:10] come that he should be received up he
[2:15:12] steadfastly set his face to go to
[2:15:14] Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his
[2:15:16] face and they entered into a village of
[2:15:18] the Samaritans to make ready for him and
[2:15:20] they did not receive him because his
[2:15:21] face was as though he would go to
[2:15:23] Jerusalem and when his disciples James
[2:15:26] and John saw this they said Lord wil
[2:15:29] thou that we command fire to come down
[2:15:30] from heaven and consume them even as
[2:15:32] Elias did but he turned and rebuked them
[2:15:34] and said ye know not what manner of
[2:15:37] spirit year of for the son of man is not
[2:15:40] come to destroy men's life but to save
[2:15:44] them here is James and John saying we're
[2:15:48] going to call down fire out of heaven
[2:15:50] and destroy you
[2:15:52] unbelievers but I want you to back up
[2:15:55] two
[2:15:58] polls the first
[2:16:00] poll was they were reasoning among
[2:16:04] themselves which of them should be the
[2:16:07] greatest they didn't repent of that even
[2:16:10] when Jesus exposed it so they moved into
[2:16:13] a second
[2:16:14] poll and
[2:16:16] said these people are using the power of
[2:16:19] God and they're not even part of our
[2:16:20] group we told them stop
[2:16:23] it we all laugh at that I mean that's
[2:16:25] ludicrous but this is their mindset
[2:16:28] right which of us is the greatest oh
[2:16:30] look at them what what stop it you're
[2:16:32] not even you're not even part of
[2:16:35] us Jesus comes and says forbid them not
[2:16:39] if they're not against us they're
[2:16:41] clearly for us yeah amen but look at the
[2:16:46] final stage because of a lack of
[2:16:49] repentance because of a lack of
[2:16:51] recognizing we should not be reasoning
[2:16:52] among oursel who is the greatest and we
[2:16:54] should be humbling ourselves as a little
[2:16:56] child just be grateful that we're in the
[2:16:59] kingdom of God because we failed to do
[2:17:02] that now we're going to shut down any
[2:17:05] believers that's not part of our
[2:17:08] group and somebody that doesn't agree
[2:17:11] with us and make us welcome and
[2:17:13] comfortable all the time we'll just call
[2:17:15] fire down out of Heaven to destroy them
[2:17:21] that's where the pride of life will take
[2:17:23] you CU if it wasn't for the pride of
[2:17:25] life they would have never been having a
[2:17:26] conversation of who is the greatest
[2:17:28] Among
[2:17:36] Us couple quotes and we'll go to close
[2:17:39] in the reproach for the cause of the
[2:17:41] word brother brandom says there is
[2:17:42] nothing happens just accidentally to
[2:17:44] those who love the Lord and are called
[2:17:46] according to his calling we are
[2:17:48] predestinated and everything works just
[2:17:50] right for that because he cannot lie and
[2:17:53] he said that was so and everything has
[2:17:54] its time its season and its way and God
[2:17:57] is behind every move and sometimes you
[2:17:59] think that everything is going wrong
[2:18:01] it's up to
[2:18:03] us those things are put Upon Us trials
[2:18:07] and wonderings it's testing to see how
[2:18:11] we will react on an action how many has
[2:18:15] ever been a place in your life that you
[2:18:16] think everything is going
[2:18:19] wrong it's
[2:18:22] testing to see how we will
[2:18:26] react to that
[2:18:28] action we say well why do I need to be
[2:18:31] tested why do the prophet need to be
[2:18:32] tested
[2:18:34] amen why do you need to be tested is
[2:18:37] because God is going to do the same
[2:18:39] thing that he did to the prophet and he
[2:18:42] is literally going to put the power of
[2:18:44] the spoken word on your tongue
[2:18:49] am he has literally put the power of the
[2:18:53] spoken of word in our daily
[2:18:56] lives we don't need to be sitting around
[2:18:59] waiting on some Supernatural
[2:19:02] anointing and mega manifestation of
[2:19:06] speaking things into existence why don't
[2:19:08] we start speaking the word into
[2:19:09] existence in our own
[2:19:11] life why don't we let that have an
[2:19:14] effect on the people around
[2:19:16] us but you can never project the right
[2:19:20] word to the people you associate with is
[2:19:23] if you don't have the right word in you
[2:19:25] already and you can never get the right
[2:19:28] word in you
[2:19:29] already if you're not first tested to
[2:19:32] make sure you're not going to go the
[2:19:33] direction you're prone to go as a hybrid
[2:19:36] individual
[2:19:38] amen he said some time ago up in
[2:19:42] Vermont so this is in
[2:19:46] 1962 right before the seals open brother
[2:19:50] brandom comes back and reiterates this
[2:19:53] story about this young couple this is
[2:19:56] how important this is and I promise I'm
[2:19:58] going to close right after this but he
[2:20:01] says a couple different things in here
[2:20:02] that just really pop out he says in the
[2:20:06] reproach for the word this is December
[2:20:08] of
[2:20:09] 62 so s what time is this is happening
[2:20:12] he's getting ready to go west he's
[2:20:14] getting ready to come back with the
[2:20:15] seals and he's saying that everything
[2:20:17] happens in our life at a time and a
[2:20:19] season for a purpose and a reason and
[2:20:21] God has to do things in our life to test
[2:20:23] and see how we're going to react and
[2:20:25] then he moves immediately into this
[2:20:27] story some time ago up in Vermont
[2:20:29] brother Fred and I were up there in the
[2:20:30] mountains where we were up on Hurricane
[2:20:31] Mountain where I used to hunt and there
[2:20:33] I remembered when I was
[2:20:38] lost this was when he had the Vermont
[2:20:40] meetings he said when he took brother
[2:20:42] Fred back up there I
[2:20:45] remembered that I was up there lost one
[2:20:48] day and how that God LED me back just by
[2:20:51] the Holy Spirit alone through a storm
[2:20:54] that I would have died perished and so
[2:20:55] would have my wife and Billy down in a
[2:20:57] little Camp miles away and I was turned
[2:20:59] around and I was standing there talking
[2:21:01] to brother Fred and the Holy Spirit said
[2:21:03] get out to yourself and I moved out into
[2:21:05] the bush a little a little place and he
[2:21:07] told me there's a trap set for you be
[2:21:09] careful now but he didn't tell me how or
[2:21:11] what I came back and told Brother Fred
[2:21:14] we went to church that night in the
[2:21:15] auditorium announced it to the people
[2:21:17] and the next night it happened and then
[2:21:20] standing
[2:21:21] there when he told me upon some mockers
[2:21:24] he said it's in your hands do with them
[2:21:27] whatsoever you say it will happen right
[2:21:29] now there you are where somebody
[2:21:32] irreverent ungodly and they were making
[2:21:34] fun and scoffing at the meeting and a
[2:21:37] young man and a young woman and he was
[2:21:38] trying to vulger love make with her in
[2:21:40] the building in everybody's attention
[2:21:42] while I was trying to preach and pull
[2:21:44] her head back and climb up in her lap
[2:21:46] and throw her head back and try to kiss
[2:21:47] her and going old like that in the
[2:21:48] meeting drawing the attention and the
[2:21:50] Holy Spirit says they are in your hands
[2:21:54] what will you do with
[2:21:57] them there was a holy hush we just
[2:22:00] listen to this holy
[2:22:03] hush everybody sat deathly
[2:22:07] quiet and I thought oh God what must I
[2:22:13] do then I remembered if it hadn't been
[2:22:17] for the warning of the Holy Spirit two
[2:22:19] days before that and I said I'll forgive
[2:22:22] you now that was what he wanted me to
[2:22:26] say because after
[2:22:30] all this is the Revelation that comes to
[2:22:32] him now because after
[2:22:35] all I had been
[2:22:40] guilty maybe not of
[2:22:42] that but
[2:22:45] guilty and guilty of the least is guilty
[2:22:49] of whole
[2:22:53] right this is the mindset brother
[2:22:57] Brandon was in when he's able to express
[2:23:00] Mercy how was he able to come to the
[2:23:02] conclusion I need to express Mercy
[2:23:04] because he
[2:23:06] remembered I'm guilty too maybe not of
[2:23:09] that but I've been guilty before and he
[2:23:12] that's guilty of least is guilty at
[2:23:14] whole and I sure want Mercy in my life
[2:23:18] so I'm going to express Mercy amen he
[2:23:21] says so I said I forgive you now you see
[2:23:25] I believe that all these things had a
[2:23:28] meaning what would you do with
[2:23:31] power how would you see the reaction of
[2:23:35] an
[2:23:37] action something that has come as an act
[2:23:40] then how do you react to that action do
[2:23:42] you understand what I mean what would
[2:23:45] you do and maybe all of this
[2:23:51] all of this testing this whole situation
[2:23:54] he comes to the end of 1962 in December
[2:23:57] right before the seals come and he says
[2:23:59] and maybe all of this has worked up to
[2:24:02] where we're at right
[2:24:05] now I would say that's an accurate
[2:24:07] assessment everything that you have
[2:24:10] experienced to mold and to shape your
[2:24:12] character for God himself to come down
[2:24:14] and indwell a human being and express
[2:24:17] the fullness of his word with the
[2:24:18] fullness of his character and the
[2:24:20] fullness of his power on a mortal hybrid
[2:24:23] tongue I would say all of this has
[2:24:27] worked to that point and remember he
[2:24:29] started that out by saying nothing
[2:24:30] happens by chance everything's
[2:24:33] predestinated everything's right on time
[2:24:35] and God does these things for a reason
[2:24:37] so Saints as we would stand together I
[2:24:39] would just encourage
[2:24:41] you we live in a horrific horrific
[2:24:45] worldly
[2:24:47] age pressures on every side things are
[2:24:51] not going to slow down things are going
[2:24:53] to speed up things are going to get more
[2:24:57] difficult things are going to get more
[2:25:04] confusing how to handle situations are
[2:25:07] going to get more difficult
[2:25:14] yes but I wonder if the testings that
[2:25:18] we've went through before this
[2:25:22] has not molded us and shaped us to a
[2:25:26] point that we can approach them
[2:25:29] correctly
[2:25:30] now and
[2:25:34] realize I don't need to press and try to
[2:25:36] figure this out what I need to do is be
[2:25:40] more powerful than he that rules the
[2:25:43] city shut my mouth it's kind of hard to
[2:25:45] preach like
[2:25:47] this shut my mouth
[2:25:50] and let God tell me what to say
[2:25:57] am how and I'm not just saying verbally
[2:26:00] it may you may not say anything and
[2:26:02] handle a situation physically or the way
[2:26:05] you conduct yourself you may not
[2:26:07] verbalize anything but it's still the
[2:26:10] power of the spoken word in your life
[2:26:13] right
[2:26:14] amen amen I would
[2:26:17] say that's what's brought us to this
[2:26:20] point
[2:26:21] and we need to take confidence in
[2:26:25] that we need to take confidence and he
[2:26:28] that started this work can finish this
[2:26:31] work even if it requires a little bit of
[2:26:33] final
[2:26:36] polishing this power that has
[2:26:39] been given to us I find it amazing the
[2:26:43] statements that brother Brandon makes
[2:26:45] even within days of this anointing
[2:26:50] coming to
[2:26:51] him look at his
[2:26:54] mindset same message speak to this
[2:26:56] mountain he
[2:26:58] says and I would ask thee Lord may it
[2:27:01] not be thought by the people because I'm
[2:27:03] referring to an experience that you have
[2:27:05] given me and telling the truth Lord may
[2:27:07] it not be thought that it was meant
[2:27:10] personally but that you were fixing but
[2:27:13] what you were fixing to do for all of
[2:27:15] your
[2:27:17] people here's a man who's manifested the
[2:27:20] spoken word and he's already got the
[2:27:23] mindset Lord I'm going to relay this to
[2:27:25] the people but don't let them think I'm
[2:27:26] trying to Puff myself up this is not
[2:27:28] even directly for me this is for all the
[2:27:30] people let them grasp
[2:27:32] that look look how easy it would have
[2:27:35] went could have went the other way look
[2:27:39] how men are prone to go the other way
[2:27:43] you give how many examples have we seen
[2:27:46] of a man with just a little bit of a
[2:27:47] gift build a major platform and here's a
[2:27:51] man with a real gift a major gift and
[2:27:55] he's immediately saying I'm going to
[2:27:56] express this but don't you all think
[2:27:58] anything of me this is for
[2:28:00] everybody
[2:28:01] amen at the closing prayer he says we
[2:28:04] repent of our sins Lord forgive me of
[2:28:06] all my
[2:28:07] mistakes forgive my ministering brother
[2:28:10] for their mistakes forgive the Church of
[2:28:11] their mistakes Lord God sanctify our
[2:28:14] heart so deeply with love and power and
[2:28:16] with consecration find favor with us
[2:28:18] Lord pour out your power we would not do
[2:28:21] anything
[2:28:22] wrong I believe every man in here would
[2:28:26] have made the same thing that night when
[2:28:29] it was given to speak evil to that
[2:28:33] boy brother brandom is not even trying
[2:28:36] to reserve this gift to himself he's
[2:28:38] wanting it to go in if you listen to
[2:28:40] this message he's wanting every Minister
[2:28:42] there on the platform to experience of
[2:28:44] this and have use of this and he's
[2:28:46] saying Lord I'm interceding for them
[2:28:48] they won't do anything wrong Lord they
[2:28:50] wouldn't do anything wrong if they were
[2:28:52] in that same test that I was they would
[2:28:54] have spoke Mercy to those boy that boy
[2:28:55] and that girl Lord I know they would
[2:29:03] have what
[2:29:05] humility what
[2:29:08] humility a man that's now standing in a
[2:29:12] position that Jesus Christ stood a man
[2:29:16] who could actually make himself a
[2:29:19] reputation
[2:29:21] remember Jesus was the only one that
[2:29:22] came who actually could have made
[2:29:24] himself of a reputation and deserved it
[2:29:26] and now here's a man even though he's
[2:29:28] born in sin shaped in iniquity been
[2:29:30] converted now God has released this
[2:29:33] power to
[2:29:35] him think of the ministry and the
[2:29:38] platform and the reputation he could
[2:29:40] have built you say oh no God wouldn't
[2:29:43] Hey listen God allowed them she Bears to
[2:29:45] come out of the Wilderness yes sir
[2:29:49] absolutely the prophet was acting wrong
[2:29:52] and doing not what God wanted done and
[2:29:54] God still had to honor the office and
[2:29:56] the
[2:30:01] gift don't tell me it wouldn't have
[2:30:03] worked I would I have no capacity to
[2:30:06] believe Within Myself that if he would
[2:30:08] have said those people would have died
[2:30:09] that they would not have
[2:30:12] died it would have
[2:30:16] worked but he is so reversed course
[2:30:20] from what human beings are prone to
[2:30:23] do and now he's not only interceding for
[2:30:26] himself but he's interceding for the
[2:30:27] whole church he's inter interceding for
[2:30:29] all the ministry and saying Lord I've I
[2:30:32] know they want to do what's right they
[2:30:35] will speak mercy and grace to the people
[2:30:38] if you will just release this to
[2:30:45] us questions and answers 1959 he says
[2:30:50] God has a hard time trying to get
[2:30:51] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[2:30:53] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[2:30:56] place until God calls him to do
[2:30:57] something you believe
[2:30:59] that he says as soon as man gets blessed
[2:31:02] and has a little something given to him
[2:31:04] he wants to become a God he wants to
[2:31:06] become an angel he wants to become s
[2:31:09] some great
[2:31:11] person what I do me and me and mine all
[2:31:17] that he says that's the wrong ad
[2:31:20] attitude God's hunting for somebody who
[2:31:23] could be blessed and pour out the
[2:31:26] blessing and the more He blesses the
[2:31:29] little the man will
[2:31:33] become I say that's the age we've come
[2:31:36] to
[2:31:37] Saints we've we've been given a proper
[2:31:40] word with a proper understanding with
[2:31:42] the proper character behind it to do
[2:31:45] what brother Rand says what does the son
[2:31:48] of man Ministry come for
[2:31:50] to reproduce the son of man ministry
[2:31:53] again there was a reason we were giving
[2:31:57] this and that reason is so that we can
[2:32:01] humble ourselves so that he can do what
[2:32:04] he wants to do and that we will hum
[2:32:06] humble
[2:32:09] ourselves the first step is
[2:32:12] humility the final polishing is with
[2:32:16] humility 1 Corinthians 2:1 you don't
[2:32:19] have to turn there I'm just going to
[2:32:20] quote it Paul speaking and he says and I
[2:32:22] Brethren when I came to you I came not
[2:32:24] with Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[2:32:26] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[2:32:28] for I determine not to know
[2:32:34] anything among you saved Jesus Christ
[2:32:37] but he doesn't stop
[2:32:39] there and him
[2:32:43] crucified Paul says the first church
[2:32:45] change messenger the foundation layer
[2:32:47] says there should not be any
[2:32:50] any it's pretty broad word anything
[2:32:54] known among you except for Christ and
[2:32:57] not just Christ but more
[2:33:00] specifically him
[2:33:02] crucified that's what the first church
[2:33:04] age messenger said the foundation layer
[2:33:07] if we want to be successful with God
[2:33:08] we're not going to be able to build upon
[2:33:10] any other
[2:33:12] Foundation Christ crucified in our lives
[2:33:17] crucify
[2:33:18] ourselves to manifest what he
[2:33:21] wants as our pastor would
[2:33:24] come
[2:33:25] Revelation
[2:33:27] 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[2:33:30] God gave unto him to show unto his
[2:33:31] servants the things which must shortly
[2:33:33] come to pass and he sent and signified
[2:33:36] it by his Angel unto his servant John I
[2:33:38] read this scripture last time but
[2:33:40] remember there's only one appropriate
[2:33:43] response to what happens between verse 1
[2:33:46] and verse 17 in the Book of Revelation
[2:33:48] chapter 1 there's only one appropriate
[2:33:51] response God comes through his servant
[2:33:54] and pours out his entire
[2:33:57] Revelation to his
[2:34:01] bride and when I saw him I fell at his
[2:34:05] feet as
[2:34:08] dead that's the only appropriate
[2:34:11] response to this message that we've been
[2:34:14] given this message did not come to Puff
[2:34:16] us up it did not come to make us think
[2:34:19] that we're even a little bit better than
[2:34:20] somebody else this message came to make
[2:34:25] us have a proper
[2:34:29] understanding that I am wrong and he is
[2:34:32] right and I'm going to lay myself at his
[2:34:35] feet because I'm a dead
[2:34:37] man and then I'm going to allow
[2:34:40] him because remember it doesn't stop
[2:34:42] there he comes and he puts his hand on
[2:34:44] us and he says fear
[2:34:47] not I am the first and I am the
[2:34:51] last what's the first and the last the
[2:34:55] polishing fear not I know I know this
[2:34:59] Revelation that you've come to has made
[2:35:01] you realize you don't stand a chance and
[2:35:03] that you're hopeless and not worthy I
[2:35:05] know I get it but remember I'm the first
[2:35:08] one that came to you and make you
[2:35:09] realize that and now that I've
[2:35:11] completely revealed myself to you I'm
[2:35:13] the last one who's just going to polish
[2:35:15] you up a little bit with
[2:35:17] humility and it's going to be okay you
[2:35:19] you are going to manifest and do what
[2:35:22] I've called you to do amen because
[2:35:24] you've come to a proper Revelation let's
[2:35:26] pray together precious Lord Jesus we
[2:35:28] just want to thank you for this time
[2:35:29] that you've given us

[2:35:46] much to not only send your word to us
[2:35:51] Lord but you would love us so much to
[2:35:54] send

[2:36:00] are and put his entire life on public
[2:36:06] display for us Lord the good and the bad
[2:36:09] Lord if you would not have done that we
[2:36:12] would have not have stood a chance there
[2:36:14] is no way that we could have grasp
[2:36:20] there is no way we could have grasped
[2:36:23] what you were doing there is no way we
[2:36:26] could have had
[2:36:27] hope or believed that you could do it in
[2:36:30] us but Lord you were gracious enough not
[2:36:33] only to do it but to give us a wave
[2:36:35] sheef Lord to give us an example to give
[2:36:38] us a man who was so honest that he would
[2:36:41] that he would come and reveal where he
[2:36:44] aired and where he went
[2:36:46] wrong and what he should have done and
[2:36:49] how he made it
[2:36:50] right Lord you revealed It All To
[2:36:55] Us father and
[2:36:57] to we thank you that that man did not
[2:37:02] have to stand there by himself in 1958
[2:37:05] when a hinging point of his ministry for
[2:37:09] the fullness of the word to come
[2:37:12] in to effect was at stake that you
[2:37:15] wouldn't leave him there helpless Lord
[2:37:19] but you would come and you would prick
[2:37:20] his
[2:37:22] memory this is what I spoke to you about
[2:37:26] make sure you handle it
[2:37:28] correctly Lord so that he could come and
[2:37:31] reverse what was done wrong 2900 years
[2:37:35] ago Lord and that you could pick up that
[2:37:38] vessel and complete your ministry and
[2:37:41] complete your work in it so that we
[2:37:44] could come to Perfection Lord you've
[2:37:46] done all of that for us Lord and we are

[2:37:57] we humble ourselves and as you have
[2:37:59] exposed these things and you have
[2:38:01] revealed the real standard may we come
[2:38:03] and may we tow up to the line Lord and
[2:38:06] may we be honest with ourselves may we

[2:40:32] my

[2:40:37] God has laid on our brother's heart on
[2:40:40] pride and I found that I've learned a
[2:40:42] lot I don't know if you have but I've
[2:40:44] learned so much about myself and the
[2:40:46] trappings of life and I want one thing I
[2:40:49] learned
[2:40:50] today is that there's been a trap laid
[2:40:52] for
[2:40:54] us would you agree there's a trap laid
[2:40:56] for you be careful what you say it's a
[2:41:00] message I want to take away from today
[2:41:02] that that in all kinds of circumstances
[2:41:04] in life the devil's trying to bring me
[2:41:06] out of my position and try and get me to
[2:41:08] use my mouth for the wrong thing and
[2:41:10] trying to get me to act in Pride and and
[2:41:12] there's not just one trap there's all
[2:41:14] kinds of traps laid for us friends I
[2:41:17] want to remember from now on I want to
[2:41:18] be careful what I say I want to be
[2:41:21] careful how I act I want to act in the
[2:41:23] same nature of the word that's been
[2:41:25] given to us I want to be a display of
[2:41:27] the word in everything and I know you do
[2:41:30] too amen I don't know about you but I
[2:41:32] just feel like I want to surrender all
[2:41:34] over again and say God I'm so thankful
[2:41:37] for what you did and forgive me forever
[2:41:39] getting puffed up in my own thinking but
[2:41:42] help me to stay humble I think it's
[2:41:44] beautiful that we have an opportunity to
[2:41:46] come and take communion this afternoon

[2:41:50] afternoon we're going to come back for
[2:41:51] communion and feet washing at 4: Lord
[2:41:53] willing and what a reminder of the
[2:41:56] Salvation that we all needed and what
[2:41:59] God had to pay the price had to be paid
[2:42:02] because we were wrong and unable to save
[2:42:05] ourselves and we needed to save you it's
[2:42:08] a good reminder may God bless you as you
[2:42:11] go may the Lord bless you as you come
[2:42:13] back we'll be back together at 4: Lord
