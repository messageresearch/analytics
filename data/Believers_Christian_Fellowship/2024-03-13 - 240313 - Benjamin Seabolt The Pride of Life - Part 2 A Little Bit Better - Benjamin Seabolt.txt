kingom of my heart can we sing that verse four if you're not Lord yes of [Music] everything then you're not Lord at all if you not Lord of everything that you're not Lord thank you praise the Lord very very fitting to what I want to speak on tonight that's such an encouragement let's just bow our heads and pray together precious Lord Jesus we so grateful Lord that you've given us another opportunity to come and to assemble ourselves together as your word has commanded us to Lord father we're once again so grateful that we can assemble here not just as a social Gathering although we love one another dearly Lord but we can come and we can gather together around you our mate the revealed word father may we never take that lightly what may we never lose focus and view of what we're doing when we assemble here Lord and who that you truly are father you've been so kind to give us a profit to come in this closing moments of time and reveal to us of what we should look for and that we're not looking as he said for nail prints or a scar in the side of somebody but we're looking for you in the form of your revealed word Lord for we are a gentile people and that's how you have declared that you would come to a gentile people father we're so grateful for that Insight we're so grateful that you in your grace and your mercy have shown us and told us the appropriate thing to be looking for and as such Lord now that we have seen you we want to recognize you for what you are and we want to yield ourselves to you Lord father not our own ideas but you the word we just ask now that you would come father I stand here as a mortal man tasked with something that no mortal man can do Lord and we're just asking now both speaker and hearer that you would come that you would pick up the book and that you would loose the seals and that you would feed your children Lord father I I believe in my heart if I had anything to offer I would offer it to this people Lord for I know that your there your purchase price father but I have nothing Lord so we're completely dependent and Counting upon you this evening but not in vain Lord for we know that you have told us where two or three are gathered there you would be and we know that you're not like us as a man Lord that would lie but you are God and that you cannot lie and we take comfort in this promise and we commit ourselves to you we ask that you would just come come truly take the preeminence here Lord and do that which you have ordained for this evening we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you if you have your Bibles we're going to go to Philippians chapter 2 greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we certainly want to greet any visitors that we have here this evening you're certainly welcome Public Service Announcement I will not be preaching for two and a half hours tonight so just relax I didn't say 2 hours and 15 minutes I just said 2 and a half hours now I certainly want to in all seriousness thank you for your patience and your attentiveness for the last service it was definitely not pre- orchestrated and had no intentions of going that direction and certainly not that duration but um it happens I I don't know what else to say and sometimes we get too spiritual minded and we think that we've entered into eternity and forget that everybody else hasn't so it can create a issue there but I can say I can say one thing and honestly and I mean this from the bottom of my heart I never felt one Speck of anybody with resentment or anybody trying to shut me down um I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing but I honestly can say when I closed that service that you all were still pulling with an honest heart and that that really says a lot um and I certainly appreciate that um another Public Service Announcement before I get started is I think I need to start with an altar call because we as a congregation have failed our pastor and this hit me right before I came to service when he texted me and told me that he was at Detroit airport with his two daughters getting ready to go to Australia and I thought how in this world did we as a congregation allow our pastor to be in Detroit airport with two young beautiful ladies going to the other side of the planet I mean you read in the Bible what happened with Abraham when he went somewhere out of his country so after I repented I made a couple Clicks in the computer and I've got brother Elmer and brother Gabe I've got you a ticket to go to Australia to ensure that they all three return safely and I also ordered some Halloween masks that should be waiting for the two daughters when they get to the airport there I don't think our pastor will need one um no offense there but just for safekeeping we've ordered them some masks so that uh nobody will dare look at them but sorry to Spring that on your brother Gabe and brother Elmer but I'm sure you're willing and able and won't be any issues to ensure the well-being of our pastor and his daughter and it's for the sake of the congregation as well so it's nothing uh nothing selfish there but we certainly appreciate them and we pray that they'll have a good trip and pray even harder that they come back at the appointed time so let's read here in Philippians chapter 2 beginning with verse one this is the same scripture that we used last time and I just want to continue this thought on the pride of life and I'm pretty certain I'm going to be stuck on this for a little bit so don't be surprised if um there's additional services with the same title says if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even to the death of the Cross God bless you as you would have your seats this evening we certainly request God to add his Blessing to the reading of his word I'm going to do a very brief review for maybe some that weren't here and just to lay a little context of where we're coming from but we're dealing with the pride of life and the scripture says here to let nothing be done through Strife or vain glory and last service we obviously laid a lot of emphasis on this nothing nothing is nothing not one single Speck of anything nothing be done through Strife or vain glory and to let this mind be in you which means a per missive Act of this is what God is trying to do but you need to let this happen let this mind be be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and then it defines to us what mine was in Christ Jesus and that was who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation he made himself self he made himself he humbled himself and made himself of no reputation and again the emphasis is on the no part not one thing because we don't want to come down to the end of the road and made oursel of almost no reputation that's not going to work out good at the ply Gates but of no reputation none whatsoever being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself he humbled himself it is something that he it was an action that he took it was not something that happened naturally it was something that he sought out and brought himself into subjection he humbled himself and became obedient to death even to the Cross Ezekiel 2 we see the exact opposite of this Ezekiel 2:2 son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord because thine heart is lifted up this is the exact opposite of the mind of Christ the what the first is what Christ did and what Christ portrayed the second second is what Lucifer did what Satan did because thine heart is lifted up I find this scripture interesting because it says your heart is lifted up it doesn't say that your body is lifted up that your spirit is lifted up that your reputation is lifted up that the people have lifted you up those obviously would not be good but that's still not the main issue you can have none of that going on and still within your heart be lifted up that is the issue this is verse 17 that I'm reading from thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay before I will lay thee before kings that they may behold you so we see the contrast in the two Spirits one of Christ one of [Music] Satan Proverbs 6:16 these six things do doth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination to him a proud look first of the list the first on the list a proud look I'm not going to go through and read the others for time sake but we get the point there this is at the top of the list of the things that God hates and then 1 John 2:15 you don't have to turn there I'm just uh quoting this to refresh your memory says love not the word world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so I'm pretty confident if we will do a thorough search of the scriptures in regards to Pride you're not going to find one positive thing you're going to find a lot of things against it there's not one positive thing to be said for this attribute I'm going to read this quote as I shared with you last time this was the quote that turned my world upside down several months ago um it's go tell my disciples 1953 speaking of Mary she knew there was something about him speaking of Jesus was different from anyone else she had Seven Devils cast out of her everybody that's ever been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they're standing no one can ever come in his great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore so she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy she thought she was so pretty and that there was no one like her so again when I'm reading this quote we're common with we're familiar with this story as Mary she had Seven Devils cast out of her but now all of a sudden a prophet looks into that realm and he starts listing off what these devils are and he says pride and envy but then he goes a step further and he starts defining what pride and envy is and this is just where I'm at with this you know I can say with an honest heart I never thought I was prideful I never thought I was envious I never wanted that I would never desire that but the problem with that is is it was my own standard of what equals Pride that is the problem because I do not have the authority to Divi to Define what pride is only a Vindicated Prophet can come on the scene and Define what this Spirit really is so now this is what hit me with such impact is when he puts when he adjusts the standard to me this is what happened to me I have my standard but now a prophet comes on the scene and adjusts my standard he adjust it to the correct standard so now everything that I've done for the last 39 years that I didn't think there was an issue with now has to be compared to this new standard and the standard is a little woman who thought she was so pretty and there was nobody like her now I've got 39 years to review of every situation that I've been in that I thought I was a little bit better and there was nobody like me yes I'm still digging in case you were wondering yes I'm still dealing with situations but but that's what happens when the standard is set reset that's what happens when the truth comes in the TR the scripture says the truth will set you free what's it going to set you free it's going to set you free of your own standard it's going to give you an appropriate standard and if you will submit yourself to that appropriate standard then and only then will it set you free but a prophet of God has the authority to reset our standards right questions and answers on Hebrews 1957 says now let's take back to Cain could you tell me where that spirit and that meanness came from if Cain was the son of Adam which was a Son of God where did that evil come from the first thing when he was born he hated he was a murderer he was jealous and now from now take the nature of his daddy the very start in the beginning Lucifer and he was in the beginning he was jealous of Michael that's what started the whole trouble again we've had our own ideas and our own standards and our own thoughts of what caused the trouble what the issue was it was this it was that but now a prophet comes on the scene and reveals this is where it started this is the root of it this is this is the very very beginning of an issue issue and this issue is because he was jealous of Michael when we really grasp this and when we really come to an understanding of this I think it will be shocking to us everything evil and bad and negative that we see around us on a daily basis because somebody was jealous the power of that Spirit we say oh it's just a little pride a lot of times we'll say well that guy just thinks a little bit too much of himself this is the very thing that caused every negative thing that has struck this Earth he thought he was a little bit better than Michael he thought that he could run things a little bit better Saints we're called for a rapture we are called for our atoms to change we before that we are called to be the very image of Christ on this Earth today how do we think that we're going to fulfill the very and manifest the very image of Christ Christ to be him on this Earth to the point that we change Dimension Dimensions with our atams changing if we have even a speck of the thing that started it in the beginning it's just not going to work if this was the issue at the beginning do we think for a second that God is going to allow that issue back in to cause the same issue again he is not going to do it but I thank God because he sent us a word to do this work he has sent us a word to accomplish what needs to be accomplished he sent us a quote that can wreck our lives turn our lives upside down redefine the standard so it's just not something that he's going to say oh you know I'll take care of everything and it won't happen again it's not going to come back into my kingdom he has he has come himself to expose this Spirit to make sure that it doesn't happen again brother random says that the bride will not be deceived we have to remember the bride is not going to be deceived just because he said she's not going to be deceived she's not going to be deceived because he has came himself to ensure she won't be deceived and the way that he has ensured that is he's came and he's told her amen this is an issue deal with it it won't work over here so it's not about us floating around and oh we're the bride we can't be deceived everything's fine no if we do not yield to this word this word is the power and the Avenue and the reason we won't be deceived we cannot not subject ourselves to the word and think we're going to turn out okay it's not going to work he has given us away out but we have to take the way out he has exposed these spirits but we can't you know shut the door of our heart and say well no that part's okay I don't no we we actively and this is what's just on my heart and this is what I've been dealing with for months is we had better be actively pursuing this in our daily lives we should be actively hunting this Spirit down in our daily lives not being naive and thinking that we're okay and that we've got it figured out and that this isn't an issue with us we should be hunting this down in our lives actively pursuing it opening all the doors turning over all the stones I assure you it's in there somewhere amen yes sir it might just be a tiny little speck but it's in there somewhere this came through the fall this was injected into the human race and until our atoms change it's going to be there and you are going to have to deal with it on a daily basis I'm going to have to deal with it on a daily basis it is once this standard was reset and my eyes were open to this the level and the depths and the intertwining and the spider webbing of this Spirit was shocking to me it still is shocking to me it's repulsive but the one thing that I don't want to do is act like I'm okay and act like it's not really there and act like well that's just a petty thing it's no if it's a petty thing you better deal with it cuz it's not going to stay a petty thing remember his goal is not to stay on a white horse his goal is to get on a red horse and then a black horse and then run you into spiritual death by not dealing with the petty things the reason the bride will not be deceived is because the seals were broke we can all say Amen to that but the seals were broke not just as interpret ations of symbols the seals were broke brother Brandon says to reveal the tactics of the enemy you and I will not be deceived because of one thing we know the tactics of the enemy outside of that you will be deceived it wasn't just the interpretation of the symbols but it was revealing to us he's going to come on something that looks like the word first that's what why we won't be deceived not because I'm the bride I just won't be deceived if you do not take this word of God that has been given to us and actively hunt down and actively pursue that white horse rider in your life you will be deceived that's true am and you'll also find yourself fighting for that deception and you find yourself in spiritual famine and if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ before you get on that horse of spiritual death thank God we can't get on that he will come and he will knock you off your horse and I thank God for that I thank God even when I miss it on the first one and miss it on the second and I miss it on the third one I thank God in his grace and his Mercy that he will supernaturally interject himself into my life because Saints I do not have faith in myself to catch it on the first one I don't even have faith in myself to catch it on the second or third one I need him to supernaturally come down and say son you better look around and you better get a grasp on yourself and your situation and I am coming I'm going to pluck you up out of this and if I wouldn't do that look at where you would be I I don't ever want to get so spiritual that I think I don't need that I do want to grow spiritually to where I can start recognizing it as the White Horse Rider and the red horse and God forbid a black horse I do want to grow spiritually I do want to grow to the point that he's not constantly having to come down and pluck me out and rescue me supernaturally that's what we're called for that's what he's given his word for that in and of itself is Supernatural but we are called to grow spiritually and not constantly having that go go on but I never never want that to be unwelcome around me I I want him to constantly come and rescue me I need that brother brandom says and humble thyselves now surely after all these years on the field and around the world seeing different people ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit come around you he doesn't even say don't let an Eric Spirit get on you he says if you want to get anywhere with God anywhere never let an arrogant Spirit even come around you that's how actively hunting down this spirit I want to be that even before it gets on me I want to be recognizing it and casting it away from me I want to to be cognizant of it on a daily basis not if it's coming but how it's coming yes because I assure you it's coming some way same some form some fashion it is trying to work in our lives never let an arrogant Spirit a prideful Spirit come around you in the church age book brother randam says I believe Brother Kyle read this last time he ministered it and it just struck me so profoundly in the church age book he says be zealous and repent now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that he says but it's a wrong Zeal he says they have put the word out for their own ideas this is what Pride does every time like its pattern will not change it this is what it will do every time it will take your own idea over the word of God that's first thing it does he says but God is calling for another Zeal it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong and this is the part that struck me it's the Zeal to cry I am wrong now I'm going to read it to you a little bit different it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong not I handled this wrong I handled that wrong I'm doing this wrong I did that wrong this is the Zeal to cry I am wrong when you see wrong this is me I am wrong because if we can never come to this level of recognition and this level of humility to even recognize that we are wrong amen amen how in the world are we going to recognize that we even need help how are we going yes see if you can't recognize that you're lost how can you recognize you need a savior brother brandom even condemned this in the Divine Healing movement he said you people going around here saying I'm not sick I'm not sick I'm not sick I'm not sick he says no you are sick you do have a problem but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities SS of God if we can't come and I'm not talking about a fake I'm talking about a real true Revelation when we look back and we open up the doors of our life and we open up the doors of our mind and of our spirit and if we can't in genuine genuine genuinely come before God yes with that True Confession I am wrong I'm the very essence of wrome only an arrogant spirit IR will keep you from that that's right to think that you're maybe a little bit right about something somewhat okay no I'm not talking about your soul and I'm not talking about the word of God in your soul we're we're much better taught than that but as Paul said in me that is my flesh in me that is my flesh there is one good thing half of a good thing three4 of a percent of a good thing no good thing amen remember who Paul was Paul was sent to the first church as the first church age Messenger to establish and build the foundation for the church why do you think Paul had to have the proper Revelation I am wrong in me is no good thing that is my flesh because the church buil on any other Revelation would have failed it wouldn't even stood a chance it would have never even got started I would say this is probably the most important Revelation that we can get because without it there can be no spiritual growth and even if you think there's spiritual growth You'll Go 39 years to realize there was no spiritual growth and you got to go back to kindergarten again come on now it is a Zeal to cry remember this is not just a cry this is not just a confession this is a zealous cry a zealous confession I am wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong what is it that all these denominations are based upon who's going to say that they're wrong the scripture says every man in his own eyeses thinks he's right there's denom denominations built on the very essence of not admitting that they're wrong we're talking millions of people we're talking billions of dollars built on something other than the confession I am wrong he says who's going to say that they all claim originality and that of God being original with God they claim that they are all right they all claim that they're all right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right I'm going to let you in a little bit something don't leave this out in the denominational world don't leave it out there Saints we're we're way past that age who in this church building is going to say that they're wrong do we all not think that we're right is that not what all our daily lives is built upon the fact that we all think that we're okay that we're right let's bring it home now you all cannot be right in fact not one of you are right I need to turn around so I can do this not any of us are right they are all Whited sepers full of dead men's bones that's me without your grace in my life that's me dead men's bones they have no life they have no Vindication God has never made himself known in any organization they say they are right because they are the ones saying it but saying it does not make it so right right oh Lord have mercy it amazes me how the simplest statements are so profound since we can say whatever we want to say it doesn't mean that it's so amen they need the indicated thus saith the Lord of God and they don't have it if God backs you up with thus sayith the Lord then you are right and if he does that for all of you then you're all right but if he does doesn't do that then you're wrong and you're all wrong and I am wrong and just because we want to confess something else other than thus sayith the Lord does it make it so and I I honestly feel that there's nobody in here that wants to do that I believe that now let me say this here this is still in the quote this is him speaking just in thought you just in case you thought I was making it up now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false Church to repent in this verse he is talking to his elect amen they have some repenting to do too amen yes saints of God over the last couple months I have found out that I am wrong when I compare my life and my attitude and my being to the new standard the Vindicated standard I came to a real hard conclusion that actually most every situation that I've dealt with in my life I've handled wrong I have found out that I Define the word wrong even when some of the things I did were right that's right because I did them with the wrong attitude this is not a pleasant reality to come to no it's been a very hard reality to come to and especially stand before the purchased blood of Jesus Christ and preach I have not only found out that I am wrong but the real thing that bothers me is I've realized I'm actually so wrong in this Fallen state that I don't even know what I'm wrong about this has so infiltrated this human race over 6,000 years yes I am so wrong I don't even know what part of me is wrong there are things ingrained in My DNA and in my culture and in my upbringing that's been there for Generations well before I even came on the scene they were wrong back then I'm eight Generations down the line and it's been taught and accepted the whole way down through you think I'm going to pick up on it I am so wrong I don't even know where to begin to start being right like where do I start repenting at first I'm four months in over one quote and I still haven't came to the end of it four I'm not exaggerating four months I have been scouring my life and opening doors and looking at situations only to realize I was wrong even when I was right I was wrong because I would have a little bit of pride in my my heart about something or I would handle it the wrong way in my heart not even in an outward manifestation four months I don't see the end of it yet constantly going back over stuff and I'm not stop I'm not talking the fanatical aspect of I'm not even a Son of God and no I Know Who I Am by his grace I know who I am but we also have to deal with the reality and the reality that in me is no good thing that is my flesh amen and let's not get so high on our horse that we think that we're in the spirit all the time saints of God even when you're in the spirit your flesh is tugging on you the seventh angel I remind you was standing behind the pulpit delivering the pure word of God and he would say I take this scripture and tie this man up you don't think he was anointed you don't think he was in the spirit if he can do it behind the pulpit delivering the word of God where am I Monday morning 30 minutes into the conversation with something that should clearly be covered by insurance I wish I wish I had the gift of discernment right now just to tap into a couple examples here we all have them do we not walk out here on Cloud9 Sunday Monday morning 30 minutes into the conversation and they clearly cannot see the problem here and I'm thoroughly convinced that if I just raised my voice a little bit more or if I repeat myself four times it will help the situation and they'll finally see that list of examples could go on well past our two and a half hour bark even when we are in the spirit that white horse is trailing along constantly tugging constantly trying to do something and even in the midst of a service even as a minister the flesh can interject itself that quick it's terrifying who in their right mind would want to stand here and do this knowing that from one minute to the next from one sentence to the next something can strike in your brain and you think it's of the Lord and you can say it and it might even be right and you say it with the wrong spirit because you're purposely trying to cut somebody it's a slick Spirit Saints it is a slick Spirit it is not going to come to you as well taught as you are and try to throw a spirit of on you just to openly go out and denounce your brothers and your sisters and attack their credibility and their character you're not going to do that for a 30 minute conversation what it's going to do is in the midst of that 30-minute conversation or in the midst of that three-hour fellowship with you and your brothers and sisters there's going to be a white horse slip into the room and a piece of conversation is going to come up where you have the opportunity to say three words that demolishes your brother and sister's character and then you'll go on and you'll keep talking about something else but because that person hurt you or because you felt you was justified you'll say those three words in the midst of three hours not even catching but it felt good when you said it on now and you were right and you may have been but because you said it with the wrong spirit and with wrong intentions you were wrong amen that's right brother Ram says we're coming to a honed Razor's Edge I think that it's time we be honest with ourselves because it's the only thing that's going to work and I mean real real honest with ourselves no matter the cost I think we better actively pursue this spirit in our life in our spiritual realm and be real honest with ourselves because if not it's going to find a holding place I don't believe that God is calling un to the false Church to repent in this verse he is talking to his elect they have some repenting to do too as I said I've come to the conclusion that I'm so wrong I don't even know where I'm wrong at and in one sense that terrifies me but in another sense there's nothing I can do about it anyhow so what's being terrified going to accomplish what it does is it makes me very cognant and very aware of my need for this word amen amen I have come to the conclusion that I have zero power and zero ability to discern myself amen that's right our Pastor said this Sunday when he was ministering you know we think we're in this part of the prophecy and maybe we are maybe we're not we think this we think that but the real key to all of that to have a proper understanding is first first recognize maybe we don't have it all figured out let's start there if we can't start there we're probably going to have a skewed picture but if we can start there and really honestly before God admit I don't have things figured out and I need some help yes remember he is our Heavenly Father Like if one of my children come to me and like Hey Dad I can't figure this out I need some help what am I going to do as a good father going to help him it's what we want to do if I can do that in a carnal sense how much more how much more does he want to help us knowing that we're in Fallen flesh knowing that we don't stand a chance so in one sense I'm terrified I don't even know where to begin at in another sense it's a pretty good place to be Lord I'm so wrong I don't even know where to begin at what's a good father going to do he's going to take the next four months and reveal to you over the course of the last 39 years of where all you've went wrong at now you have that option of whether you line up to the word or not he can't force you to do that I can show my boys the proper way to do something I can't force them to do that they've got to make the decision well yeah that looks like a good idea that might work but I'm want to try this instead it may be fine in a spiritual realm that's not going to work out for you it's either going to be this way or no way and until we subject ourselves to that we're going to stay right there and we're going to have that in our life and we're going to have no spiritual growth brother brandom said if you saw him man paraphrasing if you saw a man that was blind out on the street with no clothes on in a horrible condition you would want to go to that man and help him but if that man didn't realize that he was blind naked out in the street wandering around yes if he didn't recognize there was a problem that's right how can you help him that's right you say that's really Elementary I know and I'm sorry it's just where I'm at like I would love to be preaching something higher than this but this is just where I'm at Saints if we don't even recognize there's a problem how can he help us yes he can't we first got to come to the recognition you know you know what there might be some aspects of my life that need some attention there may be some aspects of my life that's not lining up to the message there may be some thoughts in my head that's not true I may not have everything figured out the way that I think I do 1947 experiences [Music] um yeah I'll go ahead and start with this one my subtitle for this is a little bit better little bit better three words lot of power but I'm going to give you my vision our churches will not agree with one another he's speaking at a convention denominational convention he says I'm going to give you my vision our churches will not agree with one another and it's time for you people to agree with one another the church itself you people the church itself our churches out here are not going to agree with each other it's time for the actual Church you people to start agreeing with each other you go right ahead in your s same church your church is all right your or your organization I have nothing against that but brother don't never think you're a little bit better than somebody else or somebody's a little lower than you go ahead in your church go ahead in your organization but I'm going to give you my vision remember that's what he started it with I'm going to give you my vision go ahe on as you are but don't ever think you're a little bit better than somebody you remember we're all on one equality with God we're his sons and daughters if we're Sons and Daughters of god let's act like it let's talk like it live like it be like it Sons and Daughters of God what do Sons and Daughters of God not do I think they're a little bit better than somebody else rule number one 55 position of a believer in Christ who was you a little sinner out there an old stooped out yonder passed by good Holy Ghost meeting said that bunch of Holy Rollers that's who you were are you so aristocratic in your blue Cadillac running down if somebody has a blue Cadillac in here this is for you are you so aristocratic in your blue Cadillac running down the street like that thought you was too good to eat with the rest of the people or something cuz you was just a little bit better than somebody all alien iated from God Amen do you want to be alienated from God think you're a little bit better than somebody it's a powerful Spirit Saints it puts us in positions we do not want to be in it puts us in positions and we think we're still okay thinking you're a little bit better than somebody alienated from God you say I'm just a backslid a little bit no you're alienated from God that's per the standard yes he's the standard not me belong to some of these big churches and hiding behind every Church where you're trying to hide your sins God by Sovereign election remember he started out with the question who was you but now he's saying God by Sovereign election called you into this wonderful Fellowship what did you have to do with that nothing you were a sinner a stooped sinner an aristocratical sinner but God in his Sovereign election amen called you into this wonderful Fellowship so where would you be without the calling of God on your life not in a good place yes alienated from God he says he called you into this wonderful Fellowship you lost all of your pride the first thing that he goes to when God calls you when he truly calls you into Fellowship the first thing that you did was you lost all of your pride you say well I've been in fellowship with God for however many years really if you've had Pride injected into any of that you were not in True Fellowship with him you may have had an experience with him you may have even had some fellowship with him but I'm talking about pure Fellowship total Fellowship pure fellowship and total fellowship with God cannot come until all pride is gone amen he says you lost all your pride everything 1957 washing jesus' feet he says now these Pharisees was long ways from being poor men some of them were exceedingly Rich they got the tithings and the offerings and the cuts from the sacrifice they were rich men and they were looked up to and they had to live an honest life and respected as the clergy men in the city but may I say this that with all of that which is all right but if your heart isn't right with God you're not nothing in the eyes of God yet let's go back and look over those adjectives they were looked up to they lived an honest life and were respected as clergymen in the city it's a pretty good resume not sure that I wouldn't even want to have that resume he says but if your heart isn't right with God you're still nothing meaning your opinion of yourself the opinion of the community and the opinion of the church means nothing means nothing if your heart isn't right with God you're not nothing in the eyes of God yet no matter how religious how respected how good a name you have how honest you are it doesn't mean one thing in the eyes of God he says we're watching this Pharisee and I can see him as he walks back and forth in the great corridors of his home I'm dror so and so in this city you know I'm a well-respected citizen what I say is Law and Order I am a great man remember don't leave this 2,000 years ago and when you get to thinking that in your heart then you're nothing that you ought to be says the Bible this is a man that can stand there say I am honest I am respected I am a man of God and they are all factual it is true but the fact that he thinks that in his heart that that makes him something alienates him from God and means that he is nothing in the eyes of God Amen he says when a man thinks he's just a little bit better than somebody else you are on your road out I I do not have the capacity to reveal the gravity of this to you Saints I can stand here until Kingdom Come and preach it and it has to be a personal revelation between you and Christ there is no way that I have this ability because it would require me going with Discerning power into each and every one of your old's lives and saying see this situation it was right here I don't have that ability I don't have that power you personally have to take the word of God and open yourself to the word of God and let him search this out in your life if not I'm simply going to be standing here preaching and you're going to think is that brother ever going to get off of Pride like do something preach the seals preach the plagues preach the vs if if the gravity of this situation hits you of this Spirit and the intertwinings and the inner workings and the intricate ways it has hold in our lives if it ever if it if the lid ever comes off of that to you I think you'll be of the same opinion to me we better pre be preaching on Pride for the rest of the time amen because it's everywhere and it is in everything the minute you think you're a little bit better than somebody else not even a lot better not even the best just a little bit better than somebody else meaning here's the best here's you 14 spaces down and then you're 14 out of 15 let's make it reality here's a scary thought how many billions of people are on the face of the Earth right now like 7even or8 billion so you're Six Trillion I don't even know the numbers I'm not smart enough I'm sorry but whatever you're one up from 7 billion you're on your way out you say well that's a fanatical approach I say we better take a fanatical approach because Lucifer thought he was just better than one person in the beginning and here we are that's right if There's 7 billion on the planet I better have a real true honest Revelation in my heart I'm Number s billion and without his grace and his Mercy in my life I don't stand a chance that's true honestly not making it up that's really the humility that we have to come to you say well why do we have to go to that extreme why do we have to go to that level why does it have to be that way because my husband yes the revealed word amen Jesus Christ when he was standing on this Earth he made himself of no reputation amen I don't know how many were on the face of the Earth at that time but how many ever they were he was last amen yes and he made himself that way he humbled himself to that level amen if that's fanatical sign me up for fanaticism because that's where we have to come to we have to come to that same level amen abely right still speaking of this Pharisee situation he says that's right we're all the same in the eyes of God Rich poor brown black white yellow whatever we may be we're all on equal basis with God and when this self self styled Pharisee walked up and down the floor and said you know I believe I'll put on a great big party down here you know if I could just put on a big party cause all the people to talk about it I would get probably on the front page of the paper or in the society column if there was such a thing he says we see the same thing today people wanting to put on a show that the outside world would look at them that somebody would think that they would be big they want the biggest tent meeting or the biggest this or the be the best dressed crowd coming to their Church the biggest church the highest steeple the best of pews something big you say well none of that applies to us okay we want the biggest camp meeting in the message we want the most popular preacher in the message to come speak at our event it's the same Spirit fast forward 20 years it'll still manifest itself the same way you say well he was talking about parties and getting in the paper and maybe we just want everybody in the message to talk about it you all got the point I don't need to carry on he says he that will humble himself I'm sorry let me back up the best of few something big he says what we need is more God and not so much of the world he that will humble himself God will exalt but humbleness has to come first that's why this is so important to me because because me personally I've come to that Revelation that if humility is not there first it doesn't matter how up this how high up this message ladder I get Saints it doesn't matter if true humility is not here first as Paul said I come to the end of my road and I find myself Cast Away as one who preached the gospel yeah why because this wasn't first amen remember what the prophet said as the musicians comes I'm just going to have to stop because there is no way I'm going to even get close to finishing this and I had a promise I'm not going to keep you musicians come hurry it up but I'm going to keep going while I'm waiting humility has to come first he says if you want to get anywhere with God so let's just back up I'm not an English teacher again remember but remember anywhere would mean that you're gaining ground you're going somewhere but he says before you can even gain any ground you can never have an arrogant Spirit even around you that's why this is so important that's why we've got to be honest with ourselves and deal with this because this has to be dealt with first all of this has to be rooted out first firstly he says we watch this Pharisees as he as he walks up and down the floor he's trying to think oh if I could only think of some way now that I could get somebody for a drawing card if I could only think of somebody or something that I could put on a Big Show with I want to keep going because I'm getting ready to get in the flesh cuz I've seen some stuff I've seen this Spirit manifested out he says and all at once I see him as he rubs his chubby little hand together and he puts his hand on his rly poly stomach and he says oh why didn't I think of that that's the very idea not only will I be great before the people of the city but I'll be great amongst the other message Believers I mean the Pharisees the pastors of the message the pastors of the city he says you know what I'll do I'm going to send over and invite that little fell called Jesus of Nazareth that Holy Roller and I'm going to get down there and I'm going to expose that guy this will just apply to the ministering Brothers nobody else this will apply to Brothers if we ever set foot behind this pull pit with the intentions of exposing another Minister we're a Pharisee amen and we're on our way out amen am I wish I could tell you that I've never done that amen but I have in righteous indignation with the word of God and with quotes and in what I said I was right but the way I said it was wrong you say well we never know we never picked up on it it doesn't matter whether you did or whether you didn't I know here remember Saints the standard has been adjusted the standard has been adjusted the truth has been revealed as we would stand together only the truth can set us free but the truth can't set us free if we won't let it if we'll slam the door in its face and we say that don't apply to me or we whitewash a situation that we did I believe in my heart of hearts there's nobody in this building who's wanting to go out and live in sin and wanting to go out and live in dirt and smut and those things I believe that but remember that's not the level we're called to saints that is not the level we're called to we are called to be the very image of Jesus Christ on this Earth and that is going to require us to get real with God get real with ourselves first and realize that we've got some problems and that we are not okay yes even thinking you're okay is a problem because that is the problem we are going to have to a come to a real honest conference with ourselves and with God and search our lives and see as as the song says see if there be any wicked way in me and if there is reveal that to me that I can repent of that God forbid any of us would walk out of these doors and find ourselves in that leoan condition wretched blind naked that's bad but that's not the worst the worst is knoweth it not we have a word to know we have a word that can reveal to where we can truly know if we're right or not don't forsake it don't cover stuff up be real with God be real with yourself don't let his word return void he has cast it out on top of us over and over and over let it do its intended purpose it's going to hurt amen I'll tell you right now it's going to hurt it's not going to be pleasant it is not going to be fun but don't let this seventh Angel's message be in vain Saints look at just in that carnal realm look at the sacrifices that he had to go through just to tell us the truth don't let it be in vain brother brandom says we live in a free age there was a cost to this free age don't be unwilling to pay the cost we can quote that quote we're in a bright age we're in a free age praise God AR you am am I am I free yes hey am I free are you free let's just bow our heads please yes are we really or are we just saying that remember just because we say it doesn't make it so I'm not trying to play on your emotions here this evening we're going to close this service but we got to be real with ourselves Saints amen just because we're free of denominational churches are we free you say well I'm not what I used to be praise God i' never take that away from you don't don't back up on that but are you free there has been a free Age come the opportunity lays right before us not in theory but in manifestation and in reality but it is going to come with a cost and it has come with a cost a great cost not just in the seventh angel but all of the generations that have packed this message before us I don't want my daddy's sacrifices and my daddy's life to be in vain did he have everything right no he didn't have everything right but at least he told me God sent a prophet at least he preached the truth of that message yeah I don't want to throw his life away in vain we all have those people in our lives these Generations that have went before us not just brother Brandon but look how many generations have carried this since then for what you say well they just got little bits and little pieces okay that's fine but they did it so that we can come to the final closing moments of time and truly be free let's be real with ourselves let's be real with God we have a word with the power the spirit of Truth is come let's not let it be in vain one more statement and then we're going to close in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 verse one it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel to his servant John we know through proper teaching that Jesus Christ himself gave this to brother brandom and he gave it to the bride that's how the Book of Revelation Begins the revelation of Jesus Christ was given to the prophet and it was given to the bride verse 17 is what our reaction should be and when I saw him oh when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead saints of God if we have any other reaction or any other manifestation to this Jesus Christ that has come we're wrong there is only one appropriate reaction to this message that has come to this God that has come to this Jesus Christ that has come by my way and your way and that is to fall at its feet as dead let's pray together heavenly father I pray Lord that you would help us me foremost Lord to react to your coming the scriptural way God not in partiality not with a little bit of my life left Lord but to react the scriptural way that John did the bride did to completely and utterly die to myself at your feet Lord father for if I don't do that there is no way that I am going to catch the true revelation of Jesus Christ father we thank you for truth we thank you thank you for being our father and for loving us enough to come and reveal truth to us father just to have this truth we are blessed to have a proper understanding of it we are exceedingly blessed above measure Beyond anybody else on the face of this planet to have the opportunity to properly discern ourselves and to repent and to lie up to the word of God what a privilege father I pray that you would help us to pay the price of this free age amen there's only one price youve required you have paid everything else you have simply required us to pay the price of death to self father we're just dealing with one subject the subject of pride and we see how deep and wide and high and low that it goes father please come in your mercy and Grace and help us to root this out of our Lives to find it in our lives and to repent and to make it right father we know you have come to give us this opportunity may we not pass that opportunity may we not be like that that man who wouldn't accept his pardon father you've done everything that you can do if we reject it the blood is not on your hands father may we not reject the pardon that you've sent to us may we grasp it and may we make it a reality in our life so that we may manifest what you want us to father I pray blessings upon this people I pray blessings upon our pastor and his daughters as they're going Lord may you just supernaturally watch over them guide them protect them work through them Lord bring them home safely father we would ask that you would touch Brother Kyle I believe as he's going to be ministering Wednesday father supernaturally anoint him to speak to us Lord father I'm sorry to be brother Simon on Sunday but even the rest of the brothers as they would come and Minister during this time period may you supernaturally anoint them Lord father come and speak to us come and make your word a reality in our life through each and every one of your gifts that you've placed here we love you we appreciate you we worship you we bow down before you the revealed word and submit ourselves to you in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says amen God bless you Saints let's sing that song that we were singing at the beginning of service that was so appropriate I certainly appreciate the spirit working in that let's sing that again Jesus be
