[0:00] so just relax be comfortable in what god
[0:02] has called you to do be comfortable in
[0:04] what god has given you naturally
[0:07] brother branham says most of the time
[0:10] people who have gifts don't even know
[0:12] they have the gift but it's p it's easy
[0:14] for other people to recognize it
[0:16] it's because they just see it and it's
[0:18] well that person just does that
[0:19] naturally
[0:20] but it's a gift
[0:22] they're not necessarily trying because
[0:24] it's god anointing that gift they don't
[0:25] have to try
[0:27] i would be worried about something you
[0:29] have to try to do for god
[0:33] if you're trying to do it i would be
[0:36] worried i would be i would be concerned
[0:38] because if there's not an anointing that
[0:40] just makes it work something's out of
[0:43] place
[0:45] something's not right
[0:47] the holy spirit flows brother and says
[0:48] the holy spirit is timid
[0:50] the holy spirit is not going to come
[0:52] down and just shove something in
[0:54] the holy spirit is going to flow it's
[0:57] going to work it's going to fit it's
[0:59] going to be natural
[1:01] even if somebody else is attacking that
[1:03] and trying to make it deviate or trying
[1:05] to take your place
[1:08] or trying to take away from your purpose
[1:10] god will deal with that
[1:12] if it's god's gift he's given it for a
[1:14] purpose
[1:16] he's not just going to throw it out
[1:17] there for randomly
[1:19] if he's given a gift it's for a purpose
[1:23] he's going to make sure that it finds
[1:24] its place
[1:26] you don't have to do that
