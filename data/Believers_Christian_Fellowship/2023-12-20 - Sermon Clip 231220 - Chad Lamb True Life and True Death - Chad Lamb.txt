TRANSCRIPT
========================================
remember when brother bam went to the side of his dying wife amen he he had to struggle through the flood to find his way to a hospital she had been transported and moved and and he found her just as she had passed away she walks up to her and she's already she's already dead hope is already gone and he calls her back you know she died for what we call death but brother Venom calls her back and the first thing she says to him is oh thank you for saving me thank you for bringing me back to life no the first thing she says this why did you call me back oh praise God I love these things Amen to me this is becoming the reality more and more in my life I'm not afraid to die death is a release I'm living here to serve God's purpose not for my own pleasure not to soak up all I can out of this life and have fun and run around to amusement parks that's not why I'm here I am here to serve God's purpose but when I escape this life I enter into a greater life amen the real life what I've longed to enter into all my life this is a dim reflection of life life is beyond this here comes a woman amen and when she died she's leaving back in this Dimension an 8-month old baby and an baby girl and an 18-month old baby boy can you imagine being a mother a mother who's nursing a baby an 8-month-old baby amen girl and an 18-month old with a husband that she loves dearly amen and when she dies and she goes on beyond the Mortal realm and her husband calls her back she doesn't say oh thank you you saved me I was dead and you brought me back she said why did you bring me back she tells brother B she says you know that life that Holy Ghost you preach about it's real it's more real than in your real life and she said I'm going now amen and she wasn't she wasn't sad she wasn't upset she said you know I'm going she goes that Holy Ghost You Preach stick with it amen promise me you won't leave it it's more real than you realize amen cuz she was entering in to the word amen she was entering into the promise she was entering into what was preached and it was more glorious than anything she had ever experienced in this life the final thing she says she says Bill she said now look honey said I'm going fast but remember that wonderful holy spirit that we received she said it's taking me through she said promise me this honey that you'll never cease you'll never let up you'll always stand true to that then she said she said it's wonderful in death Hallelujah this great Holy Ghost this real life it's it's wonderful in death when you're passing from this side to the next it's wonderful in death the Holy Ghost is what was carrying her through
