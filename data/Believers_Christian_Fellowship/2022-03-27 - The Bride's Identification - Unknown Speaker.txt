TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i was meditating on what to share i just thought of this little thought that i've been dwelling on and thinking about for days and how it blessed me and it was on the thought of identification and i'd like to just share some scriptures and some quotes with you for a few minutes if we look in colossians chapter 1 verse 15 it says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we see here in colossians it speaks that he is the head of the body and that is what i really want to focus in on just for a few minutes just to capture this thought he is the head of the body and there are two if you look at the two parts that are spoken of here if we look at a human being we have a body and on top of that body is the head and brother the the scriptures here that brother paul is referring to is that he is the head of the body and i want to expound upon that if we look at first corinthians chapter 12 verse 27 he says now ye are the body of christ and members in particular so the church is the body of christ but we know from the scriptures that christ is the head of the church so the head of the body is christ and and the body of christ is the church but it's yet all christ amen so the head is christ and the body is christ but but jesus christ the full measure of the word is the head or the full revelation of god is the head and the body the church is the body of christ and all of this together makes up christ so i was thinking on this some statements that brother branham had made in the message and i'll start with the one christ is the mystery of god revealed in christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 5 28 he says therefore it is the word or nothing that's right he the word how do you know what's right he the word is vindicated see he the word properly vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headship so now the prophet is telling us that he is the headship he the word is the headship or the head of the body which is the word and he's properly identified he said he is properly identificate identified vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you don't need creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identification see identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one vindicated headship that is christ the word of god so this great head of the body is christ the word of god and he is the headship of the body and he has been vindicated he has been identified in this last days and we know that he was identified through a messenger through a prophet and there was a son of man revealing the son of man and the son of man is the ministry of jesus christ himself and it was jesus christ himself working through that son of man brother branham and identifying himself to the masses and showing amen that through the sign of the messiah who was present it was jesus christ himself was present and then when it comes time for the opening of the seven seals the prophet of god tells us that only the lamb jesus christ himself can open the seals no man can open these seals no theologian no no great person no school of theology nobody can open the seals only christ himself could open these seals and so in the opening of the seals god would reveal those seals to brother branham brother branham would then reveal the seals the mystery of the thunders amen those seven unknown thunders which is the revelation of the seven seals he would begin to break those down and what was that it was an identification of who was present because the lamb is the only one that can open the seals so the headship has been come down into the body and has been identified there's been an identification of who is present and the one who is present is jesus christ the word of god the headship coming to the body and that identification was made plain through a prophetic ministry where brother branham would say he said my ministry is to declare that he is here and through that ministry christ was identified among us he was present tense he was here he was the mighty angel that came down to open those seven seals so the headship has come to the body and identified himself and in the message it is the rising of the sun from 1965 we come to paragraph 307 and he says look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of man no the quickening power of god see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord i told you was around in the pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew and now he's referring to the clown they didn't know what it was we knew just look this away it's our lord up there you see and brother brandon was referring to the picture of the cloud that was taken in arizona in 1963 and was also displayed in life magazine and sent all over the world and he said they took the picture they they didn't know what it was we knew what was it it was another way that christ was identifying himself uh he said just look this away and it's our lord up there and if you look at the picture you can see the picture as it appeared in life magazine was the headstone was the capstone it was in a pyramid shape and brother branham had taught us that that this god has been building his church building his body amen from the time of christ on building it through seven church ages building it all the way up till it finally comes to the completion of the seventh church age and upon that completion of the seventh church age will come the headstone or the capstone amen and he saw it in the form of a pyramid coming to complete the body of the bride coming to finish the manifestation of the bride or the new testament and we see it here in pyramid form and brother branham says it was those he says it was those uh seven angels that made up his wig seven angels declaring the full revelation of the full seven church ages now being completed now at the end of that those seven angels will outline the head of christ the capstone will be coming down the headship coming to the body but brother branham said in the last quote we read he said look at it this away and we know and we'll read the quote in a moment but he's told to turn the picture to the right and when he turns the picture to the right now that capstone that pyramid shape headstone coming down when it's turned to the right is the outline of the face of jesus christ identifying who this headstone is identifying what this cloud is all about it's the headship the headstone the word coming back to the body to the bride he says it early on and it is the rising of the sun if we back up in this message and read from paragraph 15 he says well if you turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's christ see his eyes look here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turn the picture from this the way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and you can see it he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth amen brother branham pointed to that cloud showing that the capstone was the headstone and it was the headship of christ returning back to the church to open the seven seals to peel away the mystery that has been laying in the bible since the foundation of the world to bring the word back to the people back to the brine and he said this there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth because brother bennett said this message is christ amen and so the vindication of the cloud is to vindicate that the message is true who vindicated it christ himself he's the only one who could put that clown there he's the only one that can make the seven angels make the outline of his face that when you would turn it to the right and brother branham didn't even see that when he first saw the clown later the angel of the lord told him turn it to the right and he says i have it right now he says turn it turn it right and he said maybe i thought to the right and when he turned it to the right he said there it was it was the face of jesus christ vindicating that this message is the truth this message was not vindicated by a man it was vindicated by almighty god himself he said that's the vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it is true and making him not a third person but the only person with the white you see the dark his face his beard and his eyes and if we look at this picture in a black and white form you'll see that this is what brother venom is referring to when it turned to the right you can see his eyes his nose his mouth his beard and his white wig of supreme deity and he and he says again and it is the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals so who opened the seals william branham didn't open the seals jesus christ opened the seals the lamb is the only one who can open the seals he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is opening the seals then revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming so this is his coming down to qui to identify to vindicate it's an identification that the message is true it's an identification of who is coming the mighty angel who is the mighty angel it's none other than christ himself what's he coming down to do he's coming down to open the seals he's coming down as the headship to unite with the body to become one with his bride upon the earth in this end time and he's identifying himself through the signs in the heavens he's identifying himself through the opening of the seals he's identifying himself through the sign of the messiah amen he's identifying himself as the ministry of the son of man working in a son of man amen he what is he doing he's identified he's trying to show his bride who this is that's speaking who this is that's come down who opened the seals what is the seals the seals is christ what is the bible it's christ amen where is he coming he's coming to his body amen who is his body his church amen and so now is not only identification of who's come down he's also identifying where he's coming to and where is he coming he's coming to his wife he's coming to his bride he's coming to his true church and now not only is christ identified now that church is identified by the headship coming to the body brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said but i'm talking about the headship of christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he christ is risen has paid the price and raised up the head or the body who raised up the body it was christ who raised up the body then he came down to identify that body that body is being raised up through seven church ages he's been building a body he's been building it up and bringing up that body through seven church ages and at the end of the seven church ages he comes down as the headship to unite with the body he has built up through seven church ages to identify this is the body this is my body this is my head coming to my body making the complete picture of christ he again says in christ as the mystery of god revealed what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people when we look at the identification of christ in this message christ went to jesus christ went through great lengths to identify himself with that man it wasn't it wasn't the son of man it was it was the son of man it wasn't brother branham he was just a son of man revealing the son of man the son of man is the ministry of jesus christ himself then he showed the sign of a messiah to discern the thoughts and intents of the people's heart brother bam said i can't do that that's him doing that he said you never touched me you never touched him in my garment you've touched the hymn of his garment and it's christ speaking back then he identified himself in the cloud turning it to the right showing his face a perfect depiction of the face of jesus christ identifying who the mighty angel was it's coming down to open the seals and then in the opening of the seals he's showing that he's here because the lamb is the only one who can open the seals but he was so thoroughly identified so that you and i can be thoroughly identified because that head was coming to rest somewhere upon the earth and it was only going to rest on his body that head had a body to come down upon and that body was not methodist that body was not baptist that body was not catholic that body was the bride that had been built over seven church ages now coming to its complete form and that body is identified by the individuals who can receive that headship and that headship is the full revelation of the full word of god and if you in this day can look at that cloud and say that's my lord up there and that message that was preached by that prophet is nothing but the pure word of god and i receive it and i submit to it and i surrender my life to it in every way then that message that cloud those seals have identified you as the body he's resting on so the identification of christ is the identification of you as a member of his bride and if you by a seed gene of god on the inside can look at that manifestation and say that's my lord up there that was god working in that man that was jesus christ who opened the seals and every word of it is absolutely thus saith the lord and i surrender my life to it then that identification has identified you as the body that the headship is resting on and now you've moved into the manifestation of the capstone christ and his bride united in you and you're here to display that identification not only was christ identified not only was that prophet identified but his body was identified there should be no question in our minds anymore who we are we are the bride of jesus christ because the headship has come to us we've received the headship without reservations without questions without doubting and that revelation has identified that we came from god we are here to manifest god and we're going back to god where is the body the body is in his bride who is his bride the ones that can receive the headship because the headship only comes to the body i would like to finish with this with this scripture in colossians chapter 1 verse 26 and verse 27 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory listen friends it's not the it's not christ in you the hope of your glory it's christ in you the hope of all glory because this is the finishing act of god's redemption story to come down and unite with his bride to reverse what we lost in the garden of eden he's restored adam that was the old testament jesus christ came as the restoration of adam then through the new testament he's been restoring back eve bringing the bride back and now the old testament and new testament is bridegroom and bride husband and wife and at the end time he's come down himself in the full revelation of the word and united bride and groom together old testament and new testament with the full revelation of the full word and now it's christ in you the hope of glory all glory all heaven all earth all redemption is waiting on this manifestation to come into the fullness of its manifestation and to end the cycle of redemption and bring us to the millennium friends he's been identified he's identified himself he's identified this message he's identified you and i by uniting with us thank god for our identification say god bless you i love you we appreciate you so much and may these things that god has given us in this message may encourage you may it warm your heart may it give you your identification may this message in this coming of christ to open these seals and reveal this word may it identify you as the bride of jesus christ god bless you friends amen
