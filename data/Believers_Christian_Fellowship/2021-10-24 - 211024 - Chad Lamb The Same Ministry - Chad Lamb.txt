presence with your life god may we have more of you and have more of the eyes have to see lord that we might know you better in this day that we live and might see you more clearly lord god help us to yield ourselves to you in a greater way that you might have full preeminence in each one of us take three minutes in this service lord speak your word as only you can break the bread of life to us lord and feed your sheep we ask for these things in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you can be seated for just a moment amen uh just continue to remember the levy family they went down this weekend uh for a funeral of an uncle and uh they just had the funeral for brother ezra levy's sister the week before and then now this is an uncle uh for for them and just remember to keep them in prayer i know it's been a tough time and especially for ezra ezra was really close to this uncle who just passed away even lived with him for a little while and so they had the funeral yesterday i think they'll be coming back tonight or tomorrow but just remember to keep them in prayer amen and also uh for kelly coli and her family they'll have a funeral on wednesday for her brother who has passed away so there's just a lot of things that have been going on in the assembly but god has been good to us amen there's been a lot of loss but god has been good amen so we we thank god that he's a very present help in a time of trouble we thank him for his word amen which changes everything and changes our perspective on everything that happens around us everything that goes on there's something different about a believer when you know where you came from and you know where you're going and you know that you're in the palm of his hand and nothing can take you out of the palm of your hand there is something that changes the atmosphere around you whether it's in blessing or whether it's in sorrow when you're mourning or when you're rejoicing amen there's something that sustains you through it all and it's the grace of god it's nothing that we've done ourselves but it is the supernatural grace of god so we're thankful for that so that we've had heartbreaking things god's been good but we also have exciting things that happen too so today i'd like to announce one exciting thing i'd like to announce the engagement of caleb schwartz and sister caressa golden would you guys stand [Applause] amen god bless you i never saw that coming praise god we're so happy for them we're happy for the two of you may god bless you amen it's good to be a believer it's good to be a christian it's good to serve god through it all he's doing wonderful things amongst us let's stand again let's read the word we'll stand and read one portion of scripture genesis chapter 1 verse 26 i get a bit of a complex sometimes because i think i start every sermon either in genesis or revelation and i don't mean to do that it just happens that way amen but genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said it and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen god bless you you can be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word as we look into his word this morning amen this is such a familiar portion of scripture to us that that we read it and we know it we've been over it and over it but once god takes the veil off of his word amen these scriptures just keep going and going and going and it's like you can never find the end to it but we know that god when he recreated the earth there in genesis chapter 1 when he reformed it after it was void and darkness and the waters covered the face of the deep amen he he spoke his word and the holy ghost went to work and began to reorder the earth and when he got the earth in a certain order then he was going to create man in his own image to rule over this to have dominion over it and so the man had a commission and his commission was to multiply and replenish the earth and to subdue it and have dominion over it so he is going he is called to be a god over the earth to rule over the earth amen and so so now he he's working in this office and in this position that god's putting them so that's his commission that's going to be his ministry if we could look at it that way let's go to genesis chapter 2 and read verse 7. i want to lay in a few of these scriptures here genesis 2 and verse 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so god is now taking man that he made and now he's placing him into a body of flesh and he's going to rule amen through this body of flesh he's going to be able to interact with creation because he's going to be made in the same form as the creation let's look at verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it verse 18 and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so we know this story amen we've read it so many times but we know god had given the man a commission he had a ministry that he was supposed to administer on the earth and in that ministry he was supposed to multiply and replenish he was supposed to subdue and have dominion over the earth and he was supposed to dress and keep the garden so this is all the ministry of the man the ministry of adam amen but i'd like to look at a quote out of the pergamon church age from the church age book and this is the section that's italicized in the church age book because these aren't brother branham's words this is when the angel the lord told him to pick up his pen and write and he picked up his pen and he just began to write when he was done he had to go back and review what he had written and i quote from this many many times because i read it all the time because it's absolutely amazing my brother venom didn't come from his mind it came from the mind of god and he says here in this section of this pick up your pen and writing says the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she found she fell by hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man made creeds or dogmas and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest so what was the promise to come to the virgin when it came to the virgin mary it was he himself to be made manifest it was the word it was god being made manifest and god is going to repeat that now when he gets a virgin bride that will be united to his son and when this virgin bride when they come to the marriage when they come to the marriage now she is going to reproduce him amen it's going to be his life through her she's going to reproduce like what what eve failed to do what the first church age failed to do this bride is now doing what what they failed to do what the commission was and so when you look at the the ministry that was given to adam adam's ministry when he was ministering in his ministry god said it's not good that you should be alone you need a help meet in this ministry i don't want you to do this by yourself in fact brother branham said he he tells us here uh and pick up your pen and right he was given a bride to reproduce himself to to multiply and replenish the earth however god was going to bring that to pass god saw fit that he needed a complimentary piece of himself he needed in order to fulfill the ministry to complete the commission that god gave him it was not going to be completed amen just in the single unit by itself but he was going to pull out of that singular creation of flesh the ingredients to make another vessel and he was going to unite these two vessels to one so that in the eyes of god they would be one amen so the in our eyes in the eyes of anybody who's not understanding god's way you can look into the garden of eden with your imagination and you can see the man and his wife running around and you will always see two but when god looked down in salt too he declared that they're one so god doesn't do math the same way we do math and he doesn't look with the same eyes we looked with when god saw these two united together as one god saw one it says in genesis 5 1 he says this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man and the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created god saw no need to give two names so that means that the woman did not have her own ministry she was never we never read where god commissioned the woman with a ministry she was commissioned while she was still in adam amen when she was still in adam she was receiving the ministry she was receiving the commission and she came forth from adam to be united back to adam amen so that adam could complete the ministry that was given to him and in order to complete it he needed a help meet he needed something that would come from him that would be opposite but the same now remember we we've talked about this before and if i could just share share re-share this with you amen you know even peter re-shared some things he said i just wanted to stir up your minds by way of remembrance amen though you know these things and be well established in present truth but peter wanted to go over it again amen i like that scripture it gives me a license to go over it again but anything that we use that we take to have power if we have power or a force that'll work it always operates or at least to my my narrow understanding of it it operates off two opposing forces of the same thing so in order to have flow of electricity you have to have a positive and negative so are positive and negative different no they're two ends of the same thing they're both electricity if we're going to have hydraulic power that's going to move something you need high pressure and low pressure hydraulic power and high pressure and low pressure work together to make something work amen but what are they they're two ends of the same thing they're both hydraulic pressure if you're going to use magnetism to turn a motor you need positive and negative forces on your magnetism but it's still magnetism so god has set this world up in such a way that these forces that are working amen they're working they're the same thing amen but they're complementary to each other they're they're they're like opposites like male and female male and female is still the same thing it's still mankind a male and female giraffe is still a giraffe amen a male and female lion's a lion a male and female man is a man it's still it's the same thing but god has structured this he's displayed it because the natural types the spiritual amen and god is displayed in such a way amen that if you're going to move something work with something use something to have power amen you're going to take two opposite forces of the same kind of thing the same substance and you're going to be able to do some work with that amen and so god was doing the same thing in his son adam adam now was going to have a complementary opposing peace come out but not opposing in the way of opposite contradictory but opposing in the way of complementary so that they fit together and they complement one another to make a whole so so we see that god this is this is very much uh the nature of god even brother branham tells us in one quote he says because he was a father he had to become a son of man so why did he have to become a son of man because he was a father and the only way he could express father was to become a son of man so in order to express father you have to have son amen it doesn't matter any young couple who's married amen the man can feel like he's a father i'll be a good father it's in me to be a father but he's not a father till he has a son so in order to express father he's got to have something that's opposite to father which is son do you understand what i'm saying so now there's a picture of father because there's been a son amen and the son gets his identity from the father because he came out from the father so so now god this is how god is displaying himself god is using these these forces god is using male and female god is using father and son amen to to display himself to show his attributes to sow his characteristics to display his power of who he is so because he was a father he had to become a son of man brother brahm says that now brother rem doesn't say this but this is just what i say this is something that i ponder if he was a bridegroom how will he express bridegroom he's a bridegroom but he has no bride amen so how will you express bridegroom he must become a bride it's a complementary part to the bridegroom and it has to be in place to express the bridegroom because the bridegroom can't be expressed without the bride so when we begin to understand this we begin to understand our place in the mystery of god amen because this is the mystery of god being revealed and christ is the mystery of god revealed amen just like adam the first son was was a a revelation of a mystery of god who created all things was expressed in the son who was made in his image and his likeness male and female he made them what's male and female it's expressing the likeness of god so now god is expressing through his creation his likeness or a reflection on earth of who he is or what he is or how he is and so now because amen because his son was to be a husband they had to express a bride praise god and so this is the role that the woman plays in the beginning now the woman doesn't have her own ministry she is a partaker of adam's ministry because the commission was given to adam but yet she was present when the commission was given because before god told them to multiply and replenish she was there with adam in spirit form in theophonic form they were there together what brother man tells us like the holy ghost moving over the creation the invisible amen but it wasn't invisible to god it was only invisible to the material on earth and they were together in this expression male and female amen and that expression received the commandment and that commandment was to multiply replenish to subdue and have dominion over the earth and amen when it was expressed in flesh and put in the garden then it was to to to uh it was to keep the garden all right so now all of that was given you'd say well that was all given to adam yes it was given to adam that's why it's clear when god makes the woman and brings her out and unites the two back together he makes sure that he calls them adam so that the woman know what she's supposed to do if she would if god would have given her another name under another name she wouldn't have a commission she would be lost in the creation because what god gave to adam amen adam now must fulfill it's his ministry amen but but when god gave it to adam she was there then so when she comes out in another expression of adam she's still there to help fulfill the commission that was given because she's a joint heir of creation and if adam is to subdue creation have dominion over it she is also to subdue creation and have dominion over it if adam is the multiplying replenished she is also part of that multiplication for replenishment so now we we understand that her ministry is his ministry and his ministry is her ministry because we realize that the bride in christ have the same ministry it's the ministry of christ and that's why when we take the name methodist and we take the name baptism we take the name when we take other names brother brenham calls them names of blasphemy because under those names you get a different ministry so the methodist will have the methodist ministry the baptist will have the baptist ministry the catholics will have the catholic ministry and they'll be ministering according to a denominational head somewhere fulfilling the ministry of the baptist church because they took another name because eve was given a name after she fell through adultery she was given a name so her name is the name of blasphemy her name is the name of adultery is that right and so now when we take these church names we start to take a church ministry amen and that's where spiritual amnesia begins to set in amen and people don't know what they're on earth for what we're supposed to be doing what the commission is why are we here what are we supposed to fulfill because we don't take a church name we take the name jesus christ amen our identification is our headship our headship is our husband the husband and the wife are one unit so his ministry is her ministry so they have the same ministry brother branham says in jehovah jireh from 1964 he says now as sure as adam and eve had to be the same spirit christ in the church has to be the same spirit the same ministry the things that i do shall you do also you see what i mean they had to unite together flesh and blood and god had to come together to be one spirit and jesus christ in his church is one spirit how can the church deny creation how can the church deny the thing that christ told them to do how can we deny it and then say that we are of christ if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will it will be given to you i am the vine you are the branches and the life that's in the vine goes into the branches to bear the fruit fruit bearers so brother brahma is showing us that that that the christ in the church is the same spirit the same ministry and that ministry together when the vine and the branch come together they become fruit bearers bearing the fruit of the ministry so i want to i want to go all the way back and i want to just look at a few excerpts from the ministry and life of jesus christ so let's go go back to luke chapter 2 and i just want to take a couple little snapshots here just so we can identify his ministry you know there are some commissions that have been given to men through the scriptures and there's commissions that are given to fathers fathers amen bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the lord right but a man cannot do that by himself because he can't be a father by himself and then to bring up the children nurtured ammunition of the lord he's going to need a woman to help him do that is that right so so her ministry is his ministry is that right so when the scripture says fathers amen bring up your children and the nurture and admonition of the lord amen that automatically applies to his wife because his wife has has helped me in that ministry that's her ministry and you know that just because mom and dad don't always do the same jobs in the home dad has to go and he's got to earn he's got to earn bread by the sweat of his brow he's got to he got to go and work to provide amen so that he can bring up in the nurturing ammunition of the lord and mom is able to be there more with the children and she's doing more of these day-to-day trainings and things and dad's doing devotions at night and they're praying together and they're not always doing the same job but they have the same ministry to raise these children amen in the nurture and admonition of the lord amen so she doesn't need a separate commission she needs to understand who she's married to who her head is because her head's commission is her commission that's why when when when uh joshua says you know you serve whichever god you want but as for me and my house we will serve the lord amen nobody looked at his wife and said well what will you do she had already heard what she was going to do we're going to serve the lord amen because she was supposed to be one in unity with her husband amen and if her husband says as for me and my house we will serve the lord then they could look at her and say what are you going to do she's going to say i'm with him his commission's my commission his ministry is my ministry we're going to serve the lord amen and i'm going to help him do that praise be to god luke chapter 2 let's read verse 41. now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast this is jesus at 12 going to jerusalem with his parents and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposed him to have been in the company having been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk an acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions man i would have loved to overheard that conversation i would pay a tremendous sum of money right now if i could get a tape recording of that meeting [Music] hearing the doctors of divinity this 12 year old boy hearing them and asking them questions i would love to hear the question he asked and and i would i would i don't want to tape i want a video because i want to see the expression on their face when this 12 year old asked a doctor of divinity and the jewish law a question and that doctor goes uh um ah go play little boy so he was both sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hostile thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wished you not that i must be about my father's business. we see from a very early age brother branham or not brother brennan jesus knew what his commission was and he knew what his father's business was and that he was to be about his father's business and what was his father's business his father's business was the word amen that's always been his father's business is the word that's still his father's business the word and i would say this christ is still about his father's business that's his commission amen the the fulfillment of the word the word for our day the anointed word for the season amen the word is still amen the father's business and christ is still about his father's business but if we're married to christ whatever is his business is our business whatever is his commission is our commission and our commission is the word amen if he was about his father's business we're to be about his father's business too because that's our business is this word amen i would actually like to take some of our 12 year olds to talk to some doctors of divinity i'd love to hear that conversation and i'd like to hear them answer the questions [Laughter] oh praise be to god mine because jesus christ was the word amen and as being the word he understood the word and he knew that that's his father's business was the word and the fulfillment of the word amen and we are part of christ and our business is the word and the fulfillment of the word amen that's why when we ever get confused in life and we start to get distracted by too many things of this world and we start to chase other dreams and other ambitions and other things we need to come back to who we really are and what our commission really is because i am married to christ in an invisible union this is the marriage of the lamb and i'm united to him and what he is i am my identity is in him his commission is now my commission i'm here amen to work in conjunction with him to pull about the ministry that the father has given him and so when i ever want to wonder what i'm on earth for what am i to do what am i supposed to do hey listen that's what we're supposed to do however god does it through you and however god uses you that's what we're supposed to be doing amen in the in the message the token brother brahman says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride in christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same and remember these former treaties oh theophilus i have wrote to you that jesus began to do and then brother branham adds and continues to do let's go to acts chapter 1 and look at that together acts chapter 1 verse 1 the former treatise have i made of theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and to teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen so brother branham is encapsulating what is taking place in these first two verses amen and when he quotes when he quotes the scriptures he adds an injunction there because he's picking up the truth out of verse two because the holy ghost is continuing the work so he reads the scripture he said the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same and remember these former treaties of theophilus i wrote to you that jesus began to do and continues to do well he misquoted that scripture i beg your pardon he did not misquote that scripture he understood exactly what the scripture was saying his death didn't stop him he goes on to say no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the holy ghost and to continue the work on and continues on said the book of acts jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever that's the token that's the sign amen so now what he begin to do he continues to do and this is the beginning of the book of acts because brother branham said this wasn't the acts of the apostles this was the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles so it was a continuation of the life and ministry of jesus christ the life that was in him now is coming to the disciples and that life and ministry continue on so when he says oh theophilus all that he began to do that was what he began to do but he didn't finish all his earthly ministry while he was here on earth there's more in that ministry that's unfolding in in modern events made clear by prophecy says turning he says when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went into the ground come back to be the bride just the bride and groom is the same flesh and blood the same ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he'd done the spirit let's look at luke 19 and verse 10. luke 19 and verse 10 i'm sorry i went to the wrong one for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost what am i supposed to do lord what's my job on this earth what have you called me for what i'm supposed to do whatever his ministry was your ministry is and he came to seek and to save that which was lost what am i here to do to seek and deceive that which was lost how am i going to do it not everybody has the same role not everybody has the same job not everybody's going to do the same thing but the ministry as a whole is out here looking for the last predestinated seed they're out here looking for the last sheep to come into the fold they're here to seek and to save that which is lost because it's a continuation of his ministry we don't ever want to lose sight of that one thing that i want to be conscious of all the time is that we don't get so wrapped up in in our church walk amen that we forget that the ministry of christ was the seeking to save that which was lost there was a reason you work where you work there's a reason you shop where you shop there's a reason sometimes that your vehicle breaks down and you go to a certain shop or something happens in the house you got to call a certain person in or you have interactions with extended family members and these things happen don't forget that there's still a purpose in your life and there's still a ministry of christ in your life because we can get so narrowed down and the blinders can come on that we can be so focused on going to church sunday and going to church wednesday and learning everything and growing and becoming more christ-like amen that's valid that's important we should be doing that but when we get that narrow vision we forget that there's a ministry of christ on earth today and that ministry of christ is in his bride amen and jesus went to church the scripture says he went into the synagogue as was his custom in nazareth his home town he went to church it was his custom to go to church and he stood up and read amen but but so jesus went to church jesus was in synagogues jesus was in worship places but jesus was also in the market amen he was also in the wilderness he was also by the boats of the fisherman's walking along amen he was interacting with this world because he was looking for those predestinated seeds those sheep that were lost that his father had given to him so so every once in a while it's good for us to be reminded that the ministry of christ continues on and the ministry of christ took place in the synagogue but that's not the only place that that the ministry of christ unfolded and unfolded in the synagogue it unfolded in the market it unfolded in the temple it unfolded everywhere so god has us placed everywhere for a reason and so you we may you know we we lose sight of that because we get into the routine of life and when we get into the routine of life we drive the same roads we go to the same stores we do the same thing amen but every so often god interrupts our routine and we have impact with somebody that was just unusual it was odd we had an opportunity to drop us a seat of the word we had a deep conversation with the family member things happen and they sprinkle in it live then we go right back to driving the same roads getting up at the same time amen eating the same meals going to the same restaurants and ordering the same things having the same church times and all of that and we don't want to forget that i am here amen as a continuation of the ministry of jesus christ and i can't make that happen it has to be his spirit through me but i've got to be conscious of when god is wanting to use me and not be so walled off and be in such blinders on my eyes amen that i forget that i'm not just here to make money and have a home and go to church on sunday and wednesday that i have a much broader existence than that a much broader purpose than that the school you go to the people you're in contact with the neighbors that you have it all matters friends it all for a reason and you don't know which conversation is going to be the one you don't know which neighbor is the one or which person in your workplace in your school is the one that you're there for you may not know until the white throne judgment you may not know until the rapture comes and we all go you may not know amen until it unfolds in a supernatural way but rest assured you're here in the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ it doesn't matter your job doesn't matter your role doesn't matter your status in life amen if you're a part of christ if you've been birthed into the body by the new birth then you are part of the ministry of christ and your purpose here amen is is the work and the ministry of your husband praise be to god i think it's good for us to back up every once in a while and re-examine these things and remind ourselves though you be established in this present truth but i want to stir up your minds by way of remembrance that we're here for more than just the the tunnel vision of going to work making a living saving for retirement cooking the meals going to church we're here for more than that and we do all of those things we do them faithfully because that's part of our commission to raise children unto the lord to be faithful in everything it gives us to do that's part of our commission and in that commission of doing the doing just the things that we do god has all these weird things that happen i don't know if i'm the only person that ever has weird encounters but every once in a while i have a strange encounter somebody asks a question somebody will say where do you go to church and like why did you ask me that i don't know i i i forget where i went you asked me too fast what's happening the ministry of christ continues on every once in a while you get to ask a doctor of divinity a question amen have you ever been in that situation every once in a while and it may not have an actual doctor of divinity on his wall but he's self-proclaimed i mean he went to his own university and has his own doctorate degree every once in a while you get to ask them a question and he gets to scratch his head and be astonished at what you say because he already knows everything and you don't know anything and all of a sudden you asked him a question and now he doesn't know how you who doesn't know anything can stumble him who knows everything what is it it's a continuation of the ministry of christ and it happened so it just slid right into life it just happened we didn't know how it happened it just happened and we didn't realize what it was what i want to say this morning is i want to bring our awareness to what's actually happening she is here she and he are one they have the same ministry the ministry of christ and the ministry of the bride are the same ministry and your life is not in vain your workplace is not uh is not just didn't happen haphazardly the places we go and the things that we go through there's a ministry taking place on the earth and we want to be aware awakened to that jesus would would preach the word to many and only a very few would receive it but he didn't stop preaching because only a very few received it it caused him rejection it caused him all kinds of difficulty amen misunderstandings and all kinds of horrible things were said about him but he never backed down because he was here to do the father's business amen he had a ministry he had a job he had a commission and he kept doing it regardless of what was happening around him and regardless of the reaction of the people and i said god help us to keep giving the word regardless of the reaction of the people because the prophet of god told us we're in a gleaning time amen we're digging around through the sheaves and through the cut uh cut off wheat and cut off barley and we're looking for a little bit here and a little bit there amen it may not be i mean half the people may not be ten percent of the people may not be one percent of the people you've ever talked to amen can actually see what you're talking about but it doesn't mean we're not supposed to be gleaning just because it's hard and there's hardly there's hardly a seed anywhere left on the earth does not mean we're not supposed to still be looking for that seed so just because brother brahm said the revival is over this is a gleaning time doesn't mean well the revival's over i'm going to go sit down and no you it's a gleaning time it takes more effort amen before you used to grab handfuls and cut them and handfuls and cut them but that's over with now you're looking for the one that got lost that fell through the cracks hey amen help us never to lose a burden for souls i pray this all the time because i get so burdened by other troubles and i get so burdened by other people's troubles and my troubles and church troubles and political troubles and government troubles and supply chain troubles that i don't want to forget my commission i don't want to forget this is a gleaning time and ruth's gleaning is what caught boaz's attention and it made her a suitable wife because she was a virtuous woman i don't want to become lazy just because laodicean condition is all around me i want to be found faithful all the way to the end i want to be found faithful when the door of the ark is shut if i don't know it shut i still want to say come into the ark come into the ark god will shut the door at some point he's in charge of that i'm not in charge of that and if he doesn't tell me the door is shut i don't want to say well the door is probably shut i want to act like the door is still open amen i want to talk to somebody as if they would hurt here because jesus you know his ministry went out and he dealt with pharisees and he dealt with sadducees and religious leaders and the elders and he and he dealt with the prostitutes and the tax collectors and and all these other kinds he was just looking for somebody that would listen and whoever would listen and receive he would receive them they didn't have to come from a certain category in life he would even he would even talk to nicodemus although he was rough on him nicodemus an elder and a priest amen but he would also talk to zacchaeus amen who was a swindler in a cheat if they would receive him he would receive them i mean some of these people let's just take for instance the woman who washed jesus feet now i'm not saying this to stir you up i'm saying this to stir me up but the woman who washed jesus feet simon couldn't believe jesus would let this woman wash his feet because the whole city knew she was a sinner and jesus said her sins are mini i wonder what she would look like today i wonder how big the plugs would be in her ears and i wonder how chopped off her hair would be and i wonder how dark the sleep the tattoo sleeves would be on her arms you know every once in a while you want into religious people out there they're nasty aren't they but you know who's super friendly the waitress with tattoo sleeves and big plugs in their ear [Applause] [Laughter] they'll talk to you they're friendly and when you say something about the lord they're like wow i never heard that before but that religious person amen they've got everything right they don't look that no tattoos no there's no nothing they're religious they got it all figured out a modern-day pharisee they don't want to hear anything you got to say they want to shut it down they want to call it wrong they're not friendly not nice i don't know why they go to church because they hate their lives they can't even smile can't even be nice to people amen oh god don't make me one of them i want to be as friendly as the girl with plugs in her ears no i don't want to put plugs in my ears but but i i i want to recognize that there can be a seed of god trapped in any one of these vessels any one of them can have a seat of god on the inside i don't want to already decide who will and who won't based on how they look jesus didn't do that amen he had needs go by samaria to a woman who had been on her sixth husband amen he had a woman that would come and break an alabaster box a prostitute one with many sins that the whole city knew how sinful she was that simon could not believe that he would let this woman jesus would go and eat with publicans and sinners until the pharisees would ask his disciples why is it your master eats republicans and sinners what is he doing i you say you say you think he's a prophet but look at him you ever hear brother dawson riley's testimony and brother nelson writes testimony he starts talking about uh he's up at i think it's called cherry lodge or something like that strawberry lodge or i don't know something like that and in the there was a a a woman and her son or adult son that bought this lodge and he would take hunters there and he would stay there and take meals there amen but the the her son got interested in hunting bought some dogs was gone all the time skipping out on work and his mom had to run the place by herself and she started hating dawson because she saw it was his fault and dawson didn't make anything any better he admits himself he didn't have much use for her anyhow so he warns brother brandon brother bam comes to hunt and they're going to go in and eat and he says oh she's got it pretty rough and he said brother says tell me what's going on and he told him the whole story and he said you know you'll see she'll be rough and sure enough they sat down and this woman comes over and she's she's rough she looks at she she turns her back to dawson like this and looks at brother brandon and takes his order and she looks over her shoulder goes what do you want brother and then she leaves and brother goes yeah it's pretty rough but dawson says by the end of the meal she was sitting at the table next to brother brandon he was talking to her about why she didn't go to church anymore she said i used to go and he said well that's not any good and by the time in the end of the conversation she was convinced she was going back to church and gonna serve god i wish that's where i was right now but i'm praying god will make me like that because if she treated me like that i would just not care but i don't want it to be that way i want to be different than that you ever hear perry green's testimony in perry green's testimony i think it was perry green's testimony they went in somewhere and they were getting terrible service horrible service the waitress was being just terrible and and real cantankerous and real nasty and and brother benham said brother perry let's leave her a real good tip and brother perry wasn't so much interested in that because they had pretty bad service and brother benham says her husband's an alcoholic and she had a real rough morning this morning [Music] boy instantly that changes your perspective you know that woman that strawberry lodge or wherever she was she may never have been a predestinated seed of god and never been able to come to the full truth but that didn't stop brother brennan from treating her good and encouraging her to do whatever she could with the word whatever her capacity was whether she was a penny nickel dime or silver dollar if she was a penny brother brenham wanted her to be a penny he didn't try to make her a silver dollar if she could only take a penny's worth he at least got her to give a pennies worth i mean the woman he left a tip for i mean what whatever happened in her life we don't know we don't know whatever happened in the future but but yet you see that brother branham prayed for thousands and thousands of people were non-elect and when god got when he got rebuked and he got chastened and standing in the gap brother bannon began to be upset he says i let sick people lay and here i am with the gift of healing now we know that the gift of healing could never make them born again and we know that the gift of healing that he was praying for multitudes very very very few of them were actually the elect and we know that that gift that gift was only to attract the bigger fish that was out there so that they could get hooked on the word so we know that that gift was never to catch the rainbow trout it was only to attract their attention but because he had the gift he had a response he felt a responsibility to keep the gift before the people because brother benham said whatever i can do to make somebody's life a little bit better that's what i want to do when i ask you if jesus christ was here on earth what would he do would he would do whatever he could to make somebody's life a little bit better i believe so who was who was jesus rough with wasn't rough with the prostitute he wasn't rough with the woman caught in adultery he wasn't rough with the woman of samaria at the well he was rough with the religious leaders who lied to their people who hid the truth and unrighteousness and who blasphemed the word and and jesus did not have much kind things to say about them and he didn't pull any punches but he wasn't punching zacchaeus or matthew or peter do you understand that that yeah right is right and wrong is wrong amen but if somebody doesn't know they're wrong how about showing them another way before they get condemned you've got people growing up in this generation have no clue not the first clue what the gospel is it's not like it was when i was growing up as a boy as a boy most everybody went to church in the 70s and 80s everybody had some general understanding of of being born in sin and a christ who needed to come and shed his blood for our redemption that message is lost now i said god help me never to become an old religious critic help me god you know just just by just by being christ and giving somebody an opportunity amen just to respond in a positive way to the word that's in you brother banham told us at the white throne judgment when you when you see it there in the scriptures in matthew 25 i believe it is the it separates them as the sheep from the ghosts and tells them when you fed me you fed me when i was hungry you called me when i was naked you visited me in prison they said when lord he said when you did this for the least of these mine brethren you did it unto me and brother branham tells us there'll be those who are given entrance into eternal life solely based on being kind to the elect my question to you is how many of them do you want there on your account none one fine ten hey remember they live outside of the city being non-elected but you live in the city but don't forget the gates are never closed by day or by night the gates are never closed by day or by night so that your neighbor that co-worker stood up for your work that whatever whatever whatever the situation amen they're allowed access into the city and to you anytime they want and when they come rolling up the city and you greet them and see them you're not going to regret taking the time to talk to them amen you're not going to regret the conversations you had the the deed that you did the being a good neighbor amen you're not going to regret not being a cantankerous old religious prank see i think what happens is we forget who we are spiritual amnesia creeps back in and we get back into a laodicean right back into work and back in to making ends meet and back into the troubles all around us and the news reports it's coming out and you forget this is the ministry of jesus christ the ministry of jesus christ can set free the bound set free the captives amen it is the ministry of jesus christ that will sit on the throne at the white throne and be giving entrance to some and not to others amen it's the thing that we'll be judging is the ministry of christ and here you are amen the ministry of christ is going on inside of you amen we cannot forget what power that is going on within us we cannot forget who we are what a disservice what a disservice to be so irritable you talk to nobody what a disservice i'm going to order everything online because i can't stand people anymore that's a tough temptation i'm telling you oh god's good is it a wicked world absolutely does it trouble us to walk through it absolutely but jesus walked through a whole group of infirm halt blame lame blind diseases of every kind laying by the pool of bethesda and he stepped over this one and he ran around this one and every disease imaginable every affliction and he went there because the father led him to one he prayed for that one and that one was healed and he went stepping back over bodies and walking around he went there for one amen could god lead us into some of these nasty places i'm not talking about going into vile places like bars and nightclubs and stuff like that but i mean the vile place of walmart i mean walmart has become a freak show is that right i mean you don't want to take your children in there anymore but would god lead you in there for one i just don't want to rule anything out i don't want to come up with my own idea i don't i don't want to become blind i don't want spiritual needs to creep back and i don't want to forget that i have come to this earth for a purpose and that purpose is to declare him and whatever he wants to do with my life i want to be willing to give it to him brother branham was asked a question in questions and answers on the seals he said with the bride of christ would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture he said sure that's what's going on right now the bride certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she's consisted of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble the pride of a ministry absolutely it's the ministry of the hour i'd like to say this way if i could say it without offending anybody it's the only ministry of christ on the earth i mean i don't mean to offend anybody but it is where christ is he's left the denominations he's united with this bride this is the only place the ministry of christ is so when brother branham was going to go to alaska because he wanted to get away from the people because of rejection he was going to pull the ministry of christ away from the masses and god wouldn't allow him to do that i've entertained thoughts of montana but it's not right any more than it was right for brother and i understand i feel sorry for him like i would be encouraging him yeah i think you should go to alaska brother i mean no man can take what you're going through it's not possible you get away brother go take but that's not what god wanted god wanted that ministry to continue on and even if it was just to pray for the sick that would be healed and thank god for their healing and never be able to receive anything else out of the word but he still had to have that ministry pyramid church age we're back into this section further down and pick up your pen and write so those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time i said god help me to be faithful to that what is that that's my commission that's my calling to be united with him for the completion of his work his ministry is my ministry his commission is my commission what god called him to do is what god called me to do because that's my husband we know colossians 1 really well but i'm going to read it again colossians 1 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now was made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory where is christ in you that's the mystery that's being unfolded today is the is where christ is and where christ is working and and that's the hope of glory that's not the hope of your glory that's the hope of all glory is resting on christ being in you finishing his ministry all glory is hinged on this a minute it's the hope of all glory is hinged on christ finishing his ministry in you let's turn to first john chapter 3. now remember the ministry of christ and the ministry of bride is the same ministry first john chapter 3. and verse 8 first john 3 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil brother man says in spoken word is the original seed christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that now i can't explain all this i'm just going to go through it just quickly now hit the high places so you won't stay too long christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil is that right you all believe that all right what was he god's word which destroys the works of the hybrid the devil is that right he was done to do that he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same why are you here to destroy the works of the devil how are you going to do it well you know i'm not real sure but if i can just yield to him and give him preeminence he can do it through me it's not the works that i do it's the work that he does through me amen i just got to stay yielded to him and he's going to destroy the devil amen through his body and i'm part of that body so what am i here to do destroy the works of the devil how will you do it as he leads i don't have the answers i don't know what i'm going to do tomorrow i don't know what i'm gonna say next i don't even have a clue i i never know what i'm gonna preach next half the time where we're gonna go what we're gonna do or who we're gonna run into but it's christ in us fulfilling that portion that he left for this day it has to happen it has to be fulfilled what is he looking for in this day he's looking for preeminence somebody that'll say god my life is yours my time is your my day is yours my mouth is yours my hands are your whatever you want me to do just lead me god so that i know and i will walk in your will amen jesus in his in his earthly ministry jesus had a theme to his ministry and the theme of his ministry was the kingdom of god is at hand this is the time for the fulfillment of the promise and the traditions of your fathers are dead and keeping you from it what's the bride's ministry this is the time for the fulfillment of the promise the kingdom of god is at hand amen christ is here and the traditions of the fathers are keeping you from it we're preaching the same message it's the same thing jesus come and says you by your traditions you make the gospel of none effect the bride is saying by the denominational traditions you're making the gospel of none effect jesus is saying the kingdom of god is a hand we're saying the kingdom of god is at hand it's here repent amen repent from that denominationalism repent from the traditional understanding and come to the word his ministry was was the word our ministry is the word amen but we're preaching the same thing friends the same exact message that jesus had is the same exact message that you and i have he he said this and he said that if you watch his ministry his ministry is the same that now is the hour for the fulfillment of the promise jesus knew it he knew amen he was standing there and in him was the fulfillment of the promised word for that day he knew it he was declaring it and he was telling the kingdom is come leave the traditions leave the misunderstandings and come to the word and now the bride has been awakened to who she is and she say the promise of the hour is fulfilled it's in flesh it's right here right now it's in me but leave the traditions leave the churches amen leave all of that thinking behind and come to the word for this day it's the same message john 13 3 says jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from god and went to god i ask you is that same revelation come to you the ministry of christ amen in the ministry bride is the same ministry the revelation of who he was in the revelation of who you are lining up let's go to john chapter 6. john chapter 6 and verse 38 for i come down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me can you say that i want that to be true every day in my life when i fail i fail this but i want to come back to it and say god i'm sorry this is my commission this is what i want to do if this was the commission of my husband it's my commission if this was the commission of jesus christ it's my commission as bride of christ for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me then go down to verse 42 and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i come down from heaven oh has anything changed you say i come from god i go to god i've come down from heaven for a purpose i'm part of a ministry of christ i'm here to do the will of the father and people look at you and say but i know where you were born i know your parents i knew the house you grew up in and i know all the mistakes you made as a kid it doesn't change anything i have come down from heaven due to the will of him that sent me i am here with a purpose i'm here under a commission and i'm here to help finish the ministry of jesus christ brother branham says in the fourth seal then god come down he come down to redeem those who would come down so god knew there would be those who were coming down are you one of those who come down have you come down to do the will of the one who sent you that's the reason you're sitting here that's the reason you're in this last day that's the reason you're in the body of flesh you're in you're in the location you're in you're in the church you're in you're in the year you're alive you're like you mean we look around and it's not been a blessing to live in 2020 and 2021. naturally speaking you look ahead and naturally speaking the blessings could be diminishing bit by bit the comforts and all the things that we knew as norms could be going away but i tell you i was placed here for this hour i come down from heaven not to do my will i didn't pick the year i was the year i come i didn't pick the time i would come to earth i come exactly according to his will and my will agrees with his will and i'm happy to be here amen why do you say that brother chad because i've said other things and i'm repenting right now i'm happy to be here i'm happy that i'm alive in 2021. i'm happy i'm here during a global pandemic when people are losing their minds i'm glad i can walk around in my right mind when everybody else is losing their mind because when else can a light shine any brighter amen and if things are going off into oblivion and this world is plunging in the chaos i say thank god for putting me here now not when times were good but when times are bad because somebody's going to listen to what i have to say the hour is becoming right friends amen the atmosphere is becoming perfect amen to spread the gospel to get the message out people have lost confidence in a government or a health system or anything else to give them any kind of help the security has the security rug has been pulled out from under the props are falling so fast and nobody knows what to do chaos is breaking down they're having riots all over the world riots because of lacks riots because of forced vaccination riots because of restrictions governments are losing control people are losing control the supply chain i mean we're supposed to live in america the wealthiest country in the world and there's bare thing bear sections and shelves because we can't get it off a boat and on a track and on the shelf it's it's you think there's so many systems in place there's so many we went for the brothers fellowship breakfast friday amen you went up to panera and it's locked because you can't go into panera because they don't have enough people to open a dining room it's like how can you not open your dining room you're a restaurant we were driving back from coming home from uh levi yoder's last sunday from the church service and you know everything in holmes county closes at 6 00 p.m on on sunday and we're hungry we're gonna start packing a lunch closed closed closed closed dining room clothes dining room clothes dining room clothes dining room clothes and i have an aversion to paying money and eating in my car i don't think it's right you charge me all this and i have to eat i want to at least eat and you clean up afterwards [Laughter] so we're driving along and everybody's looking on their phone and this is close this is close this is closed this is closed finally we go past a gas station with a subway that was the best subway sandwich i've ever ate in my life but their dining room was open because they didn't have a dining room they had a table in the corner of a gas station and you say how in the world are we here that we can't keep fast food restaurants open i mean something that should be like the staple of staples basics that have always been in place are not in place anymore systems that have always worked don't work anymore and you recognize they say well it's because of unemployment because of work stories and labor and blah blah blah i don't care what you say i say it's a spirit of chaos that has broke out it's a spiritual atmosphere you can try to pin it to any one thing you want to pin it to but it won't work because you can't pin it to any one thing it is because you leave the word you go to chaos you leave the word you go to chaos so there is a spirit of chaos that is working in the world and now the the country with all the systems the systems won't hold up anymore they're falling apart under the spirit of chaos [Music] things are not what they used to be and they're i i believe they're going to continue to change i could be wrong though i don't know but if they continue to change and people get more scared and more frustrated and more hopeless and they believe they lose all confidence in anything in this world i'm telling you the gleaning will get better maybe and even if you can't find any more seed you ought to be able to find somebody that'll listen to you and say what you're saying sounds right to me it sounds like the truth i think it's right and they may not be predestinated seed but i'll tell you if they can show respect to the word of god to the living jesus christ and respect it and give honor to it and if they come through that gate amen in the new jerusalem i'm going to run up and hug him and thank him for coming and tell him it's good to see him the atmosphere is getting right when everything goes wrong you know the church has always flourished under persecution when when the apostle paul god i love god he has such a way of doing things he'll use the apostle paul to strike such a heavy blow in jerusalem that it scatters the disciples everywhere preaching the gospel and then after paul's done that he'll go and save paul because he's a good tool whether he's believing or not believing he's a good tool and then god will take him to go around and minister to all those groups you're spreading the word out because when when the atmosphere got right and the trouble came to jerusalem it was just god moving the word out it wasn't a problem it was perfect the the chaos that we're under is perfect it's only a problem if we let it be a problem you know what if i can't get my favorite whatever i'll get something else god will still feed me i can't get my favorite pop tart and that's just going to ruin my life i don't like black beans i want pinto beans no more black beans come on the atmosphere is getting perfect for spreading the gospel people are needing what you have just switch whatever your favorite brand is just which and say there's no problem everything's ticking right on time nothing's out of kilter with the plan of god we're moving into chaos so fast we're seeing tribulation systems set up so quickly all of these systems and the mind control and the fear-mongering and the controlling populations that do whatever the government wants them to do and mandates and blah blah blah blah blah and travel restrictions what is this this is all pre-tribulation set up and there's nothing in me that wants to fight it because when it goes in the full-blown tribulation i won't be here anyways to deal with it we have a promise amen we're watching it go that way why fight it you're fighting against god it's like peter telling jesus be it far from you that ever suffer like that jesus was telling him exactly what was going to happen to him to fulfill the plan of god and now god has told us what's going to happen he said the holocaust was foreshadowing what's coming and before you get to the holocaust you have a government that's clamping down becoming authoritarian taking control limiting certain people's rights and doing all of that stuff to move into the holocaust so that they could pull off what they pulled off then and that's foreshadowing another some more severe holocaust that's coming oh praise god and to fight it we'll begin to be fighting against prophecy i say let the world do whatever they have to do i'm going to do what he's called me to do my ministry is the word not bringing back rights my ministry is not to preserve constitutional rights that is not my ministry i'll get caught up chasing my tail and miss what the ministry really is our ministry is the word it's the ministry of jesus christ we've got to be careful we stay focused on what the ministry is and not chase a bunch of things that it's not i say the world's falling apart again the last time brother branham preached the world is falling apart he added that part the world is falling apart again and again and again and again and what is it it's a sign of our imminent departure so we have to fight the natural man who wants to be sad and discouraged and uncomfortable we have to fight that with what prophecy has told us in our day where we're at in time and what god is doing for us through us and to us and when we can keep ourselves focused on the prophecy that came through an endtime prophet then all of a sudden you realize everything is ticking right on time there's nothing to be upset about i've got to i've got a job to do till my last breath and that job is to finish the ministry that jesus left for this day praise god oh praise the lord let's look at luke chapter 4. so luke chapter 4 verse 16. and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read i'll go down to verse 20. and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scriptural fulfilled in your ears the bride can say the same thing go to revelation 19 let us rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready and you can look at somebody and read that to them and you can close the scroll and you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled it's the same it's a continuation of the same ministry is being fulfilled what is it it's christ amen it's not it's not you and i in our body of flesh that's just the vessel that it's contained inside of but it's the ministry of christ amen his spirit is now here in the bride finishing the work he left for this specific time let us be focused on that let's go to genesis chapter 3. genesis 3 and 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i'll put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel all the way back in genesis chapter 3 there's a prophecy of the seed of the woman that will come forth and be the one that'll bruise the head of the serpent that prophecy was a prophecy of jesus christ all the way back in the fall amen when the judgments are given there's a prophecy laying there of the coming of jesus christ and what his ministry will be in his ministry he was he was made manifest to destroy the works of the devil he was the one who was going to bruise the serpent under his heel but let's go to romans 16. romans 16 and verse 20 and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly what are we seeing the prophecy in genesis 3 is fulfilled in jesus christ but it's still being fulfilled and the bride of christ because that prophecy was speaking of the woman's seed and that woman's seed is christ amen and christ as jesus christ amen he bruised his head when he went to calvary but now all the way in romans paul is telling us that the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly and you're like i thought he was going to do it under christ's feet and the answer is yes he is christ male and female he didn't finish all his works in his earthly ministry he left a portion to finish now and he's doing it through the bride so god and then you've got to look at this you've got to look at this scripture because this scripture is taken so many times and there's an arrogancy and an attitude that comes with this amen we're going to be stomping on devils and i'm a devil stomper and all of this stuff no the the scripture never says that you're going to stop the devil does it say that right it doesn't say you're going to bruise the devil it said the god of peace will brew satan under your feet you're the tool in his hand you're the instrument that he's going to use but you're not going to be able to do it yourself your attitude your your your willpower your mental prowess your ability with scripture is not going to do anything it's you giving preeminence to christ and the god of peace will bruce satan under your feet shortly he's going to use you but it's got to be him doing it through you it can't be you you can't do it most people don't like that kind of preaching you can't do it you're not good enough you're nothing special [Applause] oh that kind of preaching would do us a whole lot better good than all this pump up pump up pump up you're everything you're special and in the flesh you're nothing in your mind you're falling amen you physically have no capabilities amen your mind has failed and flawed amen but if you through a new birth can have another life living inside of you and if the life of christ is living in you and you can stay surrendered to that then he can he can bruise the serpent he can save souls he can find the lost he can heal the sick [Music] we've got to align the attitude and make the attitude right amen but if i'm just expecting him to do it without using this vessel and i'm not surrendering this vessel i want god to do god to do god to do wrong attitude if i'm not depending on him and i'll do i'll do all do wrong attitude but the right attitude is god i know you chose me and i know i came down amen to do your will i know that i am here and you've called me and there's a purpose in my life and i've come to this time and i've come to this age in this body of flesh i'm here for a reason but i can't do it without you and so i'm laying my life bare and i'm asking you to come and take control and then you see two opposing forces going into work negative and positive high pressure low pressure amen and then you see power so the prophecy in genesis 3 is still being fulfilled it's being fulfilled and a bride in the end time but it's not you it's him in you let's go to first john 4. friends whenever i see the bible calls an arrogant hateful attitude there's a wrong spirit there something's not right when i see the the word bring an absolute quiet confidence with a complete dependency on god i say that's somebody who's caught a revelation on the word they know who they are they know where they came from they know why they're here and they know who's the one who has to do the work that quiet steady confidence i know god will and i know he will because i know who i am to me that's right it can't be so humble it's useless i'm nothing i'm nobody never use me i mess up all the time i'm like please get a revelation of who you are because you're wearing me out but then that let me adam let me go i'll pray out i said oh please go somewhere else but when you find that person who by our revelation knows that they're a child of god they just know in the innermost knowing and the knowing and the down in the center of knowing they know they come from god and they know they're going back to god they know this word they hear as they truth they got something that tells them true true true true truth i know this prophet is true i know this is the end time i know and at the same time they know that without him i'm nothing because the vine can do nothing the branch can do nothing without the vine and you take those two things and put them together you have a positive and negative force that's going to move something into motion you'll see mountains move you'll see things change we have to know who we are but we have to know how incapable we are to do anything without his spirit and when we can put those two things together oh what amazing things will happen friends first john chapter 4. first john chapter 4 verse 17. hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment i just want to ask you do you believe we're in the day of judgment we are in the day of judgment so we may have boldness in the day of judgment that means we have boldness in this day because as he is so are we in this world whatever he is we are in this world and when will we have that kind of boldness in the day of judgment hey read the newspaper we're in the day of judgment and we're to have this boldness in the day of judgment that as he is so are we in this world this is boldness not arrogance but boldness confidence in what he showed us confidence in what he's told us that's why moses when moses comes to the conflict with janus and jambers and he throws down his rod he just did exactly what god told him to do he stared standing on the word he went to pharaoh he threw down his rod and became a serpent he couldn't anticipate what was going to happen next what happened next is two others threw down their serpents and brother branham said he didn't get scared he just stood there because he did what god told him to do that's this boldness i'm talking about he wasn't yelling at janice and james he wouldn't say get your snakes out you have no right to do that i'm the only one he just did what god told him to do and he expected god to take care of the rest and here in a few minutes his snake ate up the other two snakes and god told him to pick it up and he picked it up and now he's carrying a rod with two snakes inside did he expect that i don't believe so did he know what was gonna happen i don't think he did did god show him i don't believe he did not the way the prophet explains it i believe the only thing he could do when he got there is have confidence of who he met in the burning bush and believe what the man what that voice in the burning bush told him and he comes and he stands and does exactly what god said i believe brother and sister that we are here because the pillar of fire has called us out as individuals and commissioned us in this day and told us what to do and if we can just have confidence in the one who spoke the voice behind the voice amen we can just stand here and no matter what happens it looks good it looks bad it looks like it's working it looks like it's not working just stand still and that boldness and be confident in the one who called you and watch god work i'm going to read a couple quotes here as we wind down in christ as the mystery of god riviera says when he comes when he come on earth he was the tree of life do you believe that and rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree became a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him i want you to listen to that really close through that through him being chopped down he came as the tree of life they cut it down and hung it on a cross but through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him so what is the what's the bride tree to be the tree of life but i thought we were talking about the bride tree he is talking about the bride tree she will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden oh glory to god by the same word and the same god made manifest in husband and wife the same bride tree back again in 1962 in the messenger uncertain sound he says now it was about a thousand years there there was nothing but a stump but you cannot because the life of the trees predestinated to bring forth a tree up come luther started it growing what did it do organized the husband and pruned the branches come up into methodist what did it do organized just like the mother prune the branches come one up in the pentecostals that done the same thing organize god's prune the branches but that life in the heart of that tree has to live god said i will restore for the evening lights to ripen the middle of that tree stands the heart of god that's the bride true tree to meet the bridegroom tree just like was in the garden of eden originally the tree the two trees of life when when god gave adam his commission amen there was there there was his wife with him and they received that commission together and god would take him and put him in flesh and then he would separate that flesh and separate that spirit and he would it would bring out of adam the wife the bride and he would unite the two back together and the two back together was to continue the commission he received when they were together in the spirit and the same thing is true of christ and his bride she's been separated out into another manifestation but in this other manifestation it's really him in her it's a continuation of his life and he says this restoration of the bride tree to meet the bridegroom tree just like it was in the garden of eden originally the tree the two trees of life he says in the restoration of the bright tree from 62 he says otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right i'll go with you and you will be a part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me i in you and you and me oh i just love that satan just gets so angry at that seed the oneness of god brother madam is talking about the restoration of the bride tree and he's saying first before he gets to that he says the husband and wife are going to be one person just like in eden and when they come to this union to this one person it'll be my life and you amen in that day you're going to know that i am in the father the father and me i in you and you and me oh satan gets so angry about that what is getting what is satan getting so angry about that you recognizing who you really are and where you came from and what is actually going on on the inside of you satan wants to keep us in spiritual amnesia he wants to keep us in lao to see in thinking he wants us to think cardinal feel carnal be troubled by carnal things he does not want us to go deeper and recognize who we really are down in the soul amen that seat on the inside he wants us to keep looking back at a birth certificate and an employment record and a home but that's not who we are the seed is who we are the seed has come to life that's the true you that's the one who is meant to be you from before the foundation of the world that's who god is identifying and that's who god is looking to he says satan gets so angry about that see the oneness of god what oneness of god because he was a father he had to become a son of man which one was god it's the oneness of god expressed in different different expressions because he was a father he had to become a son of man because in the son of man expression he expresses the father what's this the oneness of god was not the way i thought oneness would look and because he's a bridegroom he's going to have to become a bride and satan does not like you to know this he wants you to think that you're a poor old person who was born by some parents and you lived in this life and he was pitiful and and god he felt sorry for you because he saw your pitiful condition and lost and wayward and god felt sorry for you and because he felt sorry for you one day come along and he gave you an opportunity and and because you were pitiful you took him up and said yeah i'll take that and god brings you up and washed you off he felt sorry for you and and now he brings you into the kingdom and now you're lucky to be here that's what the devil wants you to think that's the way the denominations preach the gospel amen so that you're always that you're always this poor pitiful thing that was lifted up and and brought over and and and i i'm so grateful and thankful and then at some point i could always fall away and and it's always dependent on on on whatever so i got to keep doing good and i kept being good and i got to keep i got to keep going to church and i got to keep doing all these things because i barely made it and i was just this pitiful thing i was just there's nothing nobody wanted this cast away and jesus come and took me and i'm so grateful and i better be careful but in this day what god wants us to recognize is you were always the son of god before you come to this earth or you son of god in every condition you were a son of god and at some point he come to wake up the sun that was on the inside and so you could recognize where you came from who you are where you're going and what your purpose is because your purpose is to destroy the works of the devil and he doesn't want to be destroyed so he'll paint a picture and call it the gospel that's not the gospel so he said satan just gets so angry at that see the oneness of god all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church there you are makes them all one look the bride are one tree of life other words like husband and wife as one christ and his bride are one same thing same spirit same works same signs everything else for the works that i do shall you do also how long all the world how much to every creature is that right now in investments he says this is 1963 an investment he says and that great tree that great tree of life when he come to earth they chopped it down by a roman spear and hung it on a roman tree a cruel cursed tree but in there he redeemed a bride tree the bride tree one just like him that eve tree from the garden of eden the tree that had fallen eve in the beginning and adam walked out with her now adam comes the second adam knowing that he had that he had his eyes opened to receive his eve so there was two trees in the garden of eden and brother bam said there's two trees were the tree of life and the eve tree fell and caused adam to come with her but now there was a restoration of the bridegroom tree and that bragram tree was cut down and out of that amenity hung across out of that would come a bride tree and that bride tree would be the tree of life restored back to him again as husband and wife let's go to revelation 22. this is not new to us but i want to review it right now while we're here revelation 22 is a picture of the of the city of god with the throne of god and 22 is going to be describing the river of life and in chapter 22 verse 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river catch that word either and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree refer the healing of the nations so now we're talking about the tree of life amen in the new jerusalem and there's a river of life flowing down from the throne of god and on either side of this river of life is the tree of life so if the river of life is flowing right down through the center of this church on this side is the tree of life that right and on this side is the tree of life when you look as a human being you would look at that saying that's two trees but the scriptures called it the tree of life it's one tree amen because if you go down under the river of life there's one root ball there's one origin there's one beginning and out of that first amen what we've seen through the gospels is one side comes the restoration of the tree of life the bridegroom trees come up amen and then on the other side comes the bride tree amen and they were linked all the way back before the foundation of the world amen and they've come up and it looks like two separate creations but it's two of the same thing and then they grow together in the canopy and come back together where you can hardly distinguish the two again the two become one at the end of time a root ball underneath two trees coming up which is one tree and two manifestations growing back together at the top and what's coming right out of the middle of this tree is the there's the water of life the river of life life is coming from the tree of life male and female coming together tree of life her her fruit she yields 12 manner of fruit her fruit and the leaves of this tree are for the healing of the nations you know what brother bam called you as a believer he said you're a leaf on that tree of life you're here for the healing of the nations because those who come amen to that city from outside the city are not elect predestinated seed there are people who were granted entrance into eternal life with the white throne judgment and some of them were granted interest because of how they treated the word when it was in bride form why because you're a leaf on the tree of life and the bride is the restored tree of life and when they when they come to you now as the tree of life and they receive a leaf from you now it'll give them a right to receive a leaf from the tree of life in that city god keeps everything in continuity friends it's the same whether it's the big picture or the macro uh a picture or the micro picture it's the same thing over and over and over again what happened in eden we see all the way here in revelation 22 those two trees grow back together again a restoration of the tree of life as male and female and from between them those two manifestations or maybe out of their belly will flow a river of living water the scripture keeps telling us the same thing over and over and over again life comes from the body we're not here we're not here for what most people think we're here for our 70 80 90 years on this earth is not it really isn't for what most people spend all their lives trying to achieve but we're really here to receive life and give the opportunity to receive life we're here for life that's why we're here we're here to receive his life and we're here to dispense his life and if we don't keep that in focus we'll get frustrated about the stock market we'll get bent out of shape about gas prices we will lose our minds when we can no longer get our favorite product in the store but if we keep in focus that we're here for life to dispense life to be a leaf on the tree of life to be the bride tree the tree of life restored back to the bridegroom tree again if we keep our focus on that if gas goes to ten dollars a gallon he'll either give me money for gas or he'll give me strength in my legs to pedal the bike but it's not going to change why i'm here it's not going to change my purpose it's not going to change whose hand i'm in it's not going to change anything about my life if anything things are about to get more exciting friends because you're going to have people all around you who want answers there's going to be people all around you who want to know what is going on why does this collapse why is the world falling apart what's going to happen and you can say i know why the world's falling apart and they can say what is this because eve wouldn't obey all the word amen she disobeyed all the way back in the garden of eden amen and she committed adultery with a being called the serpent and brought a hybridization into mankind and god had to come and shed his own blood because the blood of man was polluted amen and when he shed his own blood to restore us back to everything we lost but the rejection of that will send us into chaos like it was when they fell in the beginning and you know what you'd be like somebody could say that sounds crazy but i've had people send me conspiracy theories on what's going on with the vaccine and what's going on in the government and what i said makes more sense than anything those conspiracy theories and people are out there watching that by droves and believing that if to believe that why won't we try the truth amen why don't we just try the truths amen they're going to believe in all kinds of of weird societies and few people controlling the governments of the world and they drink blood out of a human skull and they why waste your time watching that nonsense we already know what it is it's a spirit it's an antichrist spirit it was working in heaven it was working in eden it's working now the world is under a spirit of chaos amen because they've rejected the word so you've got people at your work amen that'll get on youtube and they'll watch a conspiracy theory that is absolutely ludicrous so if they'll listen to that just give them the word amen it's it doesn't sound any weirder than what they've been listening to that's nothing but the truth they're searching for answers and they're willing to grab ahold of any nonsense to try to make sense of what they're seeing because what they're seeing no longer makes sense but listen friends you know the conspiracy theory it was the conspiracy that started in heaven that conspiracy has spilled down the earth and that conspiracy continues on today but you've got the secret amen you've been you've been in the bed chamber of the king of darkness you know his plans and you know what he's doing and you know how he comes as a white horse and then on a red horse then on the black and then the pale horse rise of it all you know his game plan you know his tactics you know how he works cause the seals unfolded the whole plan you already know the conspiracy you don't need a youtube channel you don't need a video you know exactly what's going on so if somebody sells you some nonsense just say hey that sounds interesting let me try this one on you and no matter what he says yours is no more different sounding than his is only yours is true and somebody just might believe it praise god i love god i love his word it unravels our foolishness as human beings our childishness it unravels the whole thing god has given us an open book let's stick with it he's given us the revelation of the word he's opened the seals to show us the plan of satan let's stick with that and let's say that i'm gonna read this next quote in the restoration of the bride tree the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be born the same material the word made flesh in the tree hope you get that it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it was in the bride the works that i do shall you do also is that right amen let's go to second corinthians almost done i just want to read a couple more scriptures second corinthians chapter five second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation so god has reconciled us to himself by the minister of jesus christ and given to us the ministry of reconciliation that's why he said we received right life now we dispense life he's given to us through jesus christ reconciliation now he's given us the ministry of reconciliation to reconcile others we were reconciled so we can reconcile we were given life so we can give life 19 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us he's saying god is calling to you right now through us god is beseeching you he's given the word of reconciliation to us we're ambassadors for christ and we're we're god is he is beseeching you by us we pray you in christ's dead that means in place of christ to be reconciled to god paul is saying we are god speaking to you and we are here in the place of christ telling you to be reconciled to god what is that the ministry of christ in you this is what we're on earth for this is why we're here let's go to 2nd thessalonians chapter 2. second second thessalonians 2 and 7. for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only who and now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way this word let means to hold back so the mystery of iniquity does already work only it's being held back it's being resisted it's being it's being pushed back amen it's being pushed back until he be taken out of the way so it and only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so the mystery of iniquity is working but it's being restricted it's being inhibited by something it's being inhibited by the one who now led us and he who lives will now let tell he be taken out of the way but i want you to listen to how brother branham reads this scripture in the first seal in this in your seals book he says for the mystery of iniquity death already worked deceivers you see deceiving the people off into something see only he god that letteth will let until he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way who's he it's he god it's he the bride [Music] he's the one who's resisting he's the one who's holding it back amen that full-blown beast thing can't break into full power until the bride gets out of the way she's now letting it she's now holding it back who's holding it back he is until he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way amen as long as you're here you're holding that thing in check amen you're keeping it can only go so far amen but when god is done redeeming the last one that he can redeem when everything is finished he's going to take it out of the way and nothing will resist that antichrist spirit then the spirit of iniquity who's he where is he till he brother ben said the church christ the bride it's not you getting on a facebook forum and typing and holding back the devil it's not you calling up some government officials it's not you holding it back it's him in you that's holding it back the spirit that is in the bride is holding that thing in check till god can finish doing what all he has to do and then now he'll take it all up amen and when the spirit goes up that life goes with it because the the tree of life is taken back and then the spirit of iniquity breaks out i say while i'm here i want to be imploring you in god's dead i want to be speaking to you in christ said be reconciled to god i want to be here doing what i'm here to do until he takes me out of the way but i don't want to stop until he takes me out of the way i don't want to quit giving leaves off of the tree of life i don't want to quit giving an opportunity for somebody to come and drink of the water of life that's why all the way at the end of revelation 22 you say the spirit and the bride say come let him as thirsty come and drink of the water of life freely i want to be giving that call as long as i'm here for somebody to come and drink brother brandon said in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word as long as she is here and he's with her that life of that blood is here as long as that life of that blood is here amen something is letting the spirit of iniquity but when it all goes i said god help me to be a clear voice until that time help me not to slack off lord help me not to get lazy help me not to get self-focused self-absorbed worried about self but help me to realize i've only got a few years to do what you put me on this earth to do and i want to be found faithful let's turn to proverbs 11. i want to finish with this musicians if you could come please brother ben if you make your way up i want to finish with this scripture proverbs chapter 11. proverbs 11 and verse 30. proverbs 11 and 30 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that went with souls is wise praise god how do you bear fruit the bridegroom can't bear fruit without the bride the bridegroom can't bear fruit without the bride tree but when the two come together she can yield her fruit and the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life the fruits that you bear which is the life of christ in you when you and christ come together it bears fruit and the fruit that you bear is a tree of life somebody can see that fruit of righteousness somebody could be attracted to the life of god i say god help us to stay faithful let's all stand i have no idea what will happen next some of the conspiracy theories might be true they might be wrong they might be partially true i have no idea but it really doesn't matter to me that's one thing i've never understood how knowing what the illuminati is doing will change my life in one drop because i have no power to change it so if i figured out what the illuminati is doing next what does it matter how am i going to change it they're going to do it anyways and then i can say i knew they were going to do that what does it matter you're still under the effects of it so why worry about that i know what god's doing in this day and that's what really matters i know where life is and i know where the fountain of life is and i know where the tree of life is and i know where you can go to get fruit off of that tree and i know where there's leaves amen off of that tree i know where there's an opportunity to come in contact with jesus christ i know where the source is i know where christ's ministry is and i know what to bring people to i know where i'm standing in the in the water of life and i can say to somebody come come come to where i'm at because i'm drinking from this water of life and you can drink too amen if you'll just get rid of all of your old understanding and drop all of the traditions of the fathers and come to the fountain of life and drink it doesn't matter if you figured out what biden's going to do next it doesn't matter i'm telling you friends it does not matter if you can figure out who's really pulling the strings in the white house and who's really in control who cares i know who's in control of the whole thing there's another layer over that and another layer over that and when you go to the top that's my father amen [Applause] and the prophet told me ed nothing's out of cater everything's ticking just right on time so why am i wasting all my time figuring out what the white house is going to do and what the senate is going to do and what they're doing in europe i don't care my commission is to give life amen my commission is to call to the water of life i am standing here in christ dead bidding you to be reconciled to god because we've been given a word of reconciliation let's not get distracted friends it could get crazier yet the world is falling apart again i've said this before or could get more normal and then crazier who knows i don't know i'm not in the business of predicting but one thing i know for sure is god has given us a word of reconciliation and a ministry of reconciliation and that's what my whole life needs to be focused on that's what we need to be given over to and if we'll be doing that regardless of people say you bunch of dummies you don't know what's going on you fools you're getting i don't care i just want to be found faithful in the calling where what they called me i want when when the when he who let us now take it out of the way i want him to say you were faithful to the last moment you were even testifying to that police officer as you put chains around the door amen oh god help us help us to break out of the cardinal into the supernatural help us to stay in the mind of christ and leave our own thinking behind and stay planted where god has planted us let us bloom and let us flourish and be connected to the bridegroom tree and let us bring forth fruit amen god bless you let's sing a song brother you got a song for i will take you from the nations and bring you to your own land and i'll be sanctified [Music] [Music] clean water on [Music] oh there's [Music] to you [Music] [Laughter] and there are streams of grace that's flowing [Music] received [Music] the spirit of grace [Music] that day what a day that will [Music] shall be opened up [Music] in the days [Music] and there are streams [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] i'd just like to share one more thought when the disciples went into the upper room before the feast of pentecost they were fearful uncertain what would happen next didn't know what to do or how to do it they were fishermen tax collector women all kinds of different if we would know what all they were it would be interesting to know where all they came from and what they were they were fearful of the authorities and uncertain of what would happen next but after they received that life that was promised to come in the baptism the holy ghost and they were quick in the life they ran out and began to preach and peter stands up to preach the gospel and begins quoting the scripture and peter never apologizes for who he is peter doesn't say now uh i i know you probably expected somebody else to be the spokesman i i did too i'm nothing he was so excited about what he had he just gave it out amen he wasn't looking at himself he wasn't apologizing for being illiterate he wasn't apologizing even if he misquoted the scripture he wasn't apologizing for not being able to say it right he had the word he had the life and now he's giving out the word and the people are taking the word amen these these men who were nobodies in society they didn't have pool they didn't have rank they didn't have support amen they weren't anything but they when they came to life and they recognized who they were amen all of a sudden it didn't matter that i was a fisherman it didn't matter that i have no money it didn't matter what other people thought of me all that mattered is i've got the word of reconciliation and it's i have it i'm not questioning the word see so many times the devil gets us to look in the mirror and we look at inabilities and we look at shortcomings and we look at all these things we look in the mirror and we have the word of reconciliation and then we just lay the word of reconciliation down because of what we see in the mirror [Music] don't let the devil pull that trick on you it doesn't matter if you're a child a man a woman it doesn't matter if you're literate or illiterate it has no there's that doesn't matter what matters is have you received the word of reconciliation and is that life in you if that life's in you then give it out we don't have to apologize for who we are peter we don't have any record that peter had an inferiority complex and wouldn't preach he just went preaching then they arrested him they hauled him into the to the council and they began to threaten him and questioning amen he didn't apologize they knew that they were ignorant unlearned men they brought him in to question him he didn't get mad at them he didn't cower to them he he wasn't looking at himself he was looking at what god had done for him he was looking at the word that he was holding the devil trips us up by getting us to look at ourselves forget about yourself it's not about you it's about him [Music] have confidence in what he's done and have confidence in who he is don't have confidence in your flesh and don't let lack of confidence in your flesh cause you not to give out the word of reconciliation just give it out well i can't i can't quote the scripture i can't find it in my bible so what just give the word just share what's in your heart god will work through it god worked through peter you worked through james he worked through john worked through matthew he worked through the mall what we need to do is realize who we are and what's been placed in our hands and forget about everything else don't feel inferior don't feel second class you've been called to be the bride of jesus christ if you know what your husband thinks about you what does it matter what somebody else thinks what does it matter if the whole sanhedrin doesn't want to listen to peter because they think that peter's uneducated and unlearned and has nothing to say his wisdom blew theirs out of the water they listened to stephen stephen just a deacon in the church he preached he preached a message that started all the way back in genesis and brought it all the way through to their day and he totally unraveled them with the message that he preached [Music] why because the word will defeat anything it's the word that we have it's the word that we're manifesting it's the word that he's called us the the be stop worrying about you look at the real you the word how can i be a tree of life i've done i've done it's not what you've done it's what he's done it's not what you will that's what he willed it's not what you said it's what he said we've got to we've got to be sure of who we are we've got to be sure of this word that we're holding in our hands and if we are it's really it's really the only thing that matters if we could just walk that way the way the disciples walk they could take peter and john and they could beat them and tell them not to preach anymore in jesus name and they would run back to the house and they couldn't wait to tell the people that they got beat and they rejoiced that they were considered worthy to suffer for the gospel's sake [Music] friends that's a totally different mindset i mean when somebody at work makes fun of us we go home and cry to our wife and can't hardly take it peter and john ran back and said guess what they beat us i'm so thankful we've been found worthy to suffer for this precious word's sake for our lord that is not carnal thinking that's a whole different way of thinking i said god take your word and give us a whole new way of thinking and a whole new way of seeing and that way we can complete the ministry that you didn't finish in your earthly journey but that portion that you reserved to do now in and through the bride is going to take a different kind of thinking it's going to take the mind of christ i say god give us your mind so that we can think differently and god bless you let's bow our heads and pray [Music] lord jesus we thank you for the privilege o god of hearing your word and god may this word wash away every wrong thought every wrong concept every wrong desire any arrogancy and pride any false humility just wash it all out of us lord and let us be what you've called us to be in this hour lord for it's going to be you not us all you've asked us to do is yield and to surrender help us god to yield and to surrender afresh may you take us up in your hands as tools and use us lord for the ministry of reconciliation for we give you first place lord take your place among us finish the work which you've ordained for this day do what only you can do lord forgot our desires to see many many saved in that day many lord who are given access to the tree of life and new heavens and new earth i pray god you would allow and i pray you would use us use us for your glory i pray in jesus christ's name [Music] amen opening [Music]
