TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He was the provision. He was the answer. ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO WATCH FOR HIM. AND WHEN HE CAME, they received him into the boat. And when they received him into the boat, instantly they WERE AT THEIR DESTINATION. THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THEY WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE PROVISION. AND THE VERY PROVISION SCARED THEM AT FIRST. THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THIS LOOKS SCARY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WHY IS IT HAPPENING THIS WAY? THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAD THING. BUT IT WAS THE VERY THING THAT they needed. It was him coming on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "It is I. Be not afraid. Don't be scared. I've been watching you. Don't be scared. I've got a provision. DON'T BE SCARED. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO DELIVER YOU FROM THIS. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH THIS TRI. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE. AMEN. I TOLD YOU TO GET IN THE boat to GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. I WILL TAKE CARE OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE. Oh my. Hey, listen. We do what we can. We try with the ores and we try with the sail and we try. BUT SOMETIMES WE come to the end of any of our mental power, our ability, even sometimes to the end of our willpower. We've come to the end of all of our reasonings. We've come to the end of our strength. And sometimes you just lay in bed at night with tears rolling down your tree cheek and say, "God, I CAN'T DO IT ONE MORE DAY." AMEN. BUT INSTEAD OF GOING THERE, WHY DON'T WE GO TO GOD? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. YOU HAVEN'T led me here in vain. You've never forsaken YOUR CHILDREN. YOU'VE PROMISED TO LEAD AND GUIDE ME. YOU'VE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME ALWAYS. AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE LAY IN BED AND TURN EVIL INTO GOOD? WHY CAN'T WE TAKE AND BEGIN TO CONFESS THE WORD AND AND AND AND PREDICT GOOD, NOT EVIL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE BE BELIEVERS &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE WORD? Let's believe the word &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF JUST GOING TO A SERMON AND HAVING IT PREACHED AND SAYING, "THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, BROTHER." AND THE NEXT TRIAL WE FALL TO PIECES AND FALL TO A A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE GROUND. WHY DON'T WE GO AND TAKE THE WORD AND SAY, "HE'LL NEVER LEAVE ME. HE'LL NEVER FORSAKE ME. HE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME ALWAYS. He's going to come on the scene. IF HE WALKS ON THE WATER, IF HE OPENS THE RED SEA, if he becomes the meal offering, if he's the TREE IN THE WATER, I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL COME, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR HIM TO come on the scene. YES. &gt;&gt; I'M CALLING FOR HIM TO COME ON THE SCENE. LORD, I NEED RESCUED. LORD, I NEED YOU. GOD, SHOW ME LIKE YOU SHOWED MOSES. WHERE IS YOUR PROVISION? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. There going to come a time this bride's going to be a believer of the word. NOT JUST A CONFESSOR, BUT a believer of the word. And she's going to act LIKE IT AND TALK LIKE IT AND STAND ON IT. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING TO HAVE PATIENCE. patience is going to do a perfect work where she that this BRIDE CAN ENDURE THROUGH EVERY TRIAL BEING STEADFAST AND FAITHFUL TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And you wonder why we go from trial to trial because that's the goal. &gt;&gt; To trust the Lord, to trust his word, to stand fast upon the word of God.
