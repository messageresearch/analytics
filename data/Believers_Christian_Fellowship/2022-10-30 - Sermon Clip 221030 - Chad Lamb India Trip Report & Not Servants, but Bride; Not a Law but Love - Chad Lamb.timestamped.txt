[0:00] we have to walk in the light as he is in
[0:02] the light but in the evening time it
[0:05] shall be light again
[0:06] it's light again friends
[0:08] he's here and we can walk in the light
[0:11] as he is in the light if he's in the
[0:13] light and we walk in the light where
[0:15] once again walking with him
[0:18] come back in the union come back into
[0:20] fellowship and now I mean the prophet of
[0:23] God didn't come to bring us a church
[0:25] order he didn't come to bring us a rule
[0:27] book he came to bring a revelation that
[0:28] you would Knight the two back together
[0:31] and now we are not his servants but we
[0:33] serve him Faithfully now everything I
[0:36] know he wants it's my pleasure to give I
[0:38] my desire is to be pleasing to him but I
[0:41] can't be pleasing without a revelation
[0:43] without faith I can't just be copying my
[0:46] neighbor's works
[0:48] it can't just be I don't cut my hair I
[0:51] don't smoke or drink I go to church I I
[0:54] confess I believe the message it's got
[0:56] to be more than that it's got to be a
[0:58] genuine Revelation that has brought you
[1:00] into Union with the person of the word
[1:02] and then the love of God is shed abroad
[1:05] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and now
[1:07] it's not I'm it's not compulsory for me
[1:10] to keep the message it's not a mandate
[1:12] for me to keep the message I can go to
[1:14] the bank of the river and fish every day
[1:16] of my life and be just as safe but
[1:18] there's nothing in me that wants to do
[1:19] that what I want to do is serve him who
[1:21] loved me so much I want to love him back
[1:23] and if he says this is the way that's
[1:25] pleasing to me everything in me by
[1:28] revelation of who I am and who he is and
[1:30] what he's done for me has brought a
[1:32] desire into me to serve him and to
[1:35] minister unto him with everything that's
[1:36] in me and it's not compulsory
[1:40] it's not because I have to to make it to
[1:42] Heaven it's not I I I by Revelation I've
[1:46] received a revelation that I am a
[1:48] sieging of God my name was on the book
[1:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:51] was laying on the marriage certificate
[1:53] under those seals since before the
[1:55] foundation of the world that I can no
[1:57] more be lost and God can be lost I'm not
[1:59] worried about losing my salvation I'm
[2:01] not worried about being a Castaway I'm
[2:03] not worried about not making the Rapture
[2:05] what I'm worried about is giving to him
[2:07] my full service and my full heart and
[2:09] serving him because I love him
[2:12] because of what he's done for me
[2:15] not jumping through a hoop to make it
[2:17] somewhere I made it before the
[2:19] foundation of the world
[2:21] not trying to attain to something it was
[2:23] attained for me
[2:27] not trying to be good enough look good
[2:29] enough act good enough none of that is
[2:32] any motivation amen all of that I would
[2:34] say is the wrong motivation
[2:37] and if that is any motivation left in us
[2:40] at all to look good at good attain to
[2:43] something be something to climb some
[2:44] ladder to get into good graces with God
[2:47] we need to go back to God and say God I
[2:49] need a revelation from you I need that
[2:51] understanding that I know beyond a
[2:54] shadow of a doubt that I was part of you
[2:56] before the foundation of the world I'm
[2:58] one of those C Gene attributes it's
[3:00] impossible for me to be cast away
[3:01] because I don't want to serve you out of
[3:04] fear I don't want to serve you a
[3:06] compulsory because I have to I want to
[3:09] serve you out of love
