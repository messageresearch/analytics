thank you Lord thank you for the grand privilege we have of being here tonight being assembled together with Saints of like Precious faith God we've come Lord to Feast upon your word to worship your name to give you glory and honor to give you our thanks and give you the praise that you deserve and to feed from your hand to receive the word the portion you have for us today God we've come Lord and I pray we're coming to that part of the service Lord where you would break for us the bread of life Lord may you break it in a special way and Feed Us of your own hand and may we receive that word with joy we love you we ask your blessing I pray you would take this vessel under your control and that you would anoint me and use me for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you it's good to be here together this evening if you'd like to take your Bibles we can turn the book of Acts thank you musicians uh as you can see it's a little bit different up front front tonight and I'm sure that's driving some people crazy I want to know what's happening but I had an inspiration a couple weeks ago just dropped into my heart to do a little object lesson so I'm going to do that tonight I don't think I've ever done that before but by the grace of God we'll see if he'll help us through it amen and uh the deacons met me at the door at night and said what's up what's up front I said so we're just going to have to wait and see and then they asked me again are you really not going to tell us brother dry ass are you really not I said no I'm not going to tell you you're going to have to wait and see so I don't think anybody knows but brother Franco so amen hopefully the Lord just really uh helps us enjoy ourselves in the word tonight and gain something that we can carry with us that will change us amen and I before we read the scripture I wanted to let you know that we have a visiting Minister coming in this Sunday brother Chris take from Idaho will be here ministering for us it was kind of a last minute invitation but he'll be coming in uh for the weekend we'll take the Sunday morning service and his pastors brother Paul halit and Idaho and uh that's where many of you know the dean hars Brother David dehart and his family that's where they attend church so we're looking forward to having him here also I also want to remind you tomorrow night we'll have the church AG book Bible study in the fellowship hall and also we have some visitors here with us this evening all the way from Saskatchewan amen so we've got sisters Audrey and Doris Adele and Sharon and her son Caleb God bless you all they're right back here it's good to have you with us we pray you find welcome here man it's good to have you that's a long journey amen so we're glad you stopped in to see us amen while we're standing together then let's turn to the book of Acts and turn to chapter 13 Acts chapter 13 verse 46 Acts 13:46 says when Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so ha the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation into the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed amen God bless you as you have your seats amen so this is where we want to put our Focus here on this last portion of the scripture as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and so you ask why did they believe because they were ordained to eternal life amen this brings into context predestination the understanding we have that God knew before the foundation of the world we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world our names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and now as the Apostle Paul is coming preaching he's he's coming and preaching the gospel and as he's going from place to place preaching there are some who believe and some who don't believe and and here he is he and Barnabas are here preaching and there's those that are rejecting the word but not everyone rejected the word there was those there that received the word and those who received the word were those as many as were ordained to eternal life amen praise God so let's go turn to John chapter 10 John chapter 10 and we remember the the story we're not this is not the story I'm going to read this scripture but remember the John chapter 4 when he went to the woman at the well and this was the Samaritan woman uh and when we read here in Acts uh Paul was talking to the Gentiles and they were ordained to eternal life the ones that believed were the ones who were ordained eternal life the Jews in this place were rejecting but these uh who they thought were not included were included and they were ordained into eternal life and they believed they received the word gladly now we come to uh in John chapter 4 Jesus goes to Samaria he goes he goes to this well in Samaria and the Samaritan woman comes along also someone that the Jews wouldn't think would be included and as he begins to speak to her amen she she begins to respond to what Jesus is saying and she begins to desire what he's offering and and she begins to ask him questions and and in the course of their dialogue she she comes to the realization to the Revelation that this before me is the Messiah what a I mean it's astounding amen the high priest the Pharisees the the scribes they were all missing it they were contesting him they were accusing him of being be elub he was false he was he was born wrong he was all kinds of things they were accusations they were throwing they were not receiving his word but here they come to a Samaritan woman who had been living in adultery who had a bad reputation who was not included in the even even in the good part of Samaritan Society she wasn't included but when she began to talk amen there was something in what Jesus was telling her and listen what he was telling her wasn't intellectually satisfying because he she she he he he asked for water and she says why are you dealing with me and he says if you knew who you were talking to you would ask me of water and I'd give you living water that you thirst no more and she says well I want this water and he says go get your husband and this is he's not sitting down breaking down the gospel to her in an intellectual way he's just interact the word is interacting with her amen and during the course of the interaction she recognized there's a there's a man here who can tell me about my life this is something special amen amen and then he begins to talk about living water dwelling up in her an artisian well a well of Living Water springing up in her and all of a sudden something in her wanted that water I mean it's not a logical conversation it's it's not intellectually satisfying it's not normal religious rhetoric you understand this conversation is odd are we do we agree this is not religion this is not textbook theology this is not five steps to winning Souls yes sir right try to replicate this he was just there was a soul he had needs to go by Samaria he was on a mission and he knew who he's hunting and he didn't come uh what we would say the typical way amen but he began to talk to her and then he talked about I can give you living water so you thirst no more I want that water then he says the water I give you will be a well of Living Water springing up into her eternal life and then she really wanted that water and then she she had to she had to expose her he had to expose her past life and and then she had to ask about worship and he had to give her the secret to true worship is worshiping in spirit and in truth and that's who the father's looking for and then she goes right to messiah messiah will tell us these things and he says I that speaketh unto you am he and she stood there contemplating what had just happened I mean really put the conversation in context it's weird just imagine your she was going to the well this is nothing out of routine this is nothing out of common this is probably one of the most common activities of her day she was going to the West well she had no expectation there was nothing she wasn't looking for anything she wasn't going to a church service she wasn't trying to find anything she was doing the most mundane and routine of all of her routine activities with no expectation and when she goes there's a man sitting by the well that's a little odd it may not be completely odd amen because that's where everybody goes to get their water but it was a little different then he started talking and she recognized he's a Jew and she says well that's weird he shouldn't be dealing with me they don't normally like to talk to us and and and then it gets stranger and stranger and stranger and stranger and this little trip to the well ends with her meeting a prophet that can tell her her whole life and now she believes with her whole heart she's just met the Messiah astounding friends we go back and we read through the Bible and for us it's just that's just nothing that's normal we just read it it just happened when it was happening then it was the most extraordinary thing that had ever happened it was beyond unusual it was it was unb believable but here she is her the disciples come up and all of a sudden the disciples are wondering why is he talking to this woman what's going on she sitting there and when when all of a sudden the full impact of the last few minutes fell upon her she dropped her water pot and went running into a city and told everybody come see a man that's told me everything I've ever done isn't this the Messiah that will do these things yeah am brother man when he talks about this little woman he says she she could believe but the religious leader the Pharisees the intellectual they couldn't believe here's what he said they had nothing to believe with she had something already in her that could believe what he was saying there was the dividing line she had something to believe with praise be to God now we look at John chapter 10 verse 27 in John 10: 27 he said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me am amen Jesus said that he came to seek and to save that which was lost he came to find the lost sheep and they were his sheep he said my sheep hear my voice that means if they hear his voice they're his sheep and then when he says my sheep hear my voice he's not going to buy sheep or find sheep or gather sheep that are new sheep he's going for his sheep that means they already belong to him they're assigned to him he is already their Shepherd they are already his sheep and they're identified he's identified to them by The Voice they're identified ifed to him by hearing his voice their identification as his sheep is the ability to hear his voice let's turn to Luke chapter 8 Luke Chapter 8:9 Luke chapter 8 verse 9 says and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand so it's given in Parables so that they can see but not see and hear but not hear back to the woman at the well the Pharisees heard but they didn't hear and they saw but they didn't see they saw Miracles they saw uh uh a prophet they saw but they didn't see they heard the teaching they heard the speech they heard but they didn't hear let's go now to John chapter 8 John chapter 8:42 in John 8: 42 he says here Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word this is amazing because we got to keep things in in in context and our understanding why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word they were not deaf they had the sense of hearing and they spoke the same language and they understood mechanically what he was saying right so they were hearing but not hearing amen they were understanding they were understanding they they understood the translation of the words that he spoke but they didn't understand the meaning of what he said why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him that's an important statement there is no truth in him amen when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convince me of sin and if if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is he that is of God heareth God's word ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God kind of amazing so the the devil he says was your father you cannot why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word and they're like I heard everything you said but you did you've heard everything I said but you didn't hear what I was [Music] saying because they didn't have the ears that the woman at the well had and so he says if you were uh of God you would hear my words he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God so he says you're of your father the devil and there is no truth in him that's why he can't receive the truth or believe the truth or act the truth because there's no truth in him for to receive the truth there had to be truth in him let's go to John chapter 18 John chapter 18 in John 18:37 John 18:37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice so if you're of the truth you'll hear his voice so do you hear his voice after you become of the truth or do you hear his voice because you're of the truth so that means you must have something to hear with amen and if you hear then there must be some truth in you already to hear the truth because the devil has no truth in him and you're Children of the devil and you cannot hear my speech because you understand my speech because you cannot hear my word but if you of God you would hear God's word and you would believe me amen so everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice amen so so when do I hear his voice after I become of the truth or do I hear his voice because I'm already of the truth predestination friends it's all through the Bible amen I'm going to come down here to my little table I set that up because we're going to have a really short preacher tonight no I'm just I'm just kidding it's going to be me I really don't know exactly how all this is going to work out I don't really have it all sketched out in my mind but that's okay I just have an inspiration and that's enough for me amen so I don't know why this flashed into my mind like a lightning bolt but we're going to just see what happens amen so the this is a tuning fork this is a box I have no idea why but it's just a box The Tuning Fork goes in now I'm going to I'm going to set up my phone here I've got a tuning app on here that I'm going to put in here I practiced this part today so I could get it right so this tuning fork happens to be set for 440 Hertz 444 440 Hertz is the note a in Middle a on the musical scale now I'm not a musician so I may get something wrong I'm also not a scientist so I may get something wrong so if I get something wrong just say poor brother Chad but try to understand what I'm getting at try to get to the point so this was cast in such a way that this has a a frequency of 440 Hertz so it gives the note a now 440 Hertz is the rate of oscillation or vibration so this these these two prongs they vibrate when you strike them with a mallet so equilibrium is the center the vibration will make it vibrate back and forth one full vibration back and forth is an oscillation all right I'm not a scientist so I might have got that a little bit wrong but I think that's right so the the rate that it vibrates or the oscillation the number of Cycles from one side back to the other back to Middle that's one cycle that's that's rated in hertz one cycle is a hert one cycle per second would be one Hertz so 440 Hertz means this vibrates 440 cycles per second when it's struck that's how we get the note a and you can use this to tune a piano you can use it to tune all kinds of instruments to tune a guitar to tune all kinds of things so can we see the I can't see the thing if we can pull up the um tuner if you can pull up my tuner there we go so you guys can see I want evidence I'm not lying there's no tricks so you can see that strikes a and when I talk I mess it all up if you look on the center here of the scale when it's at zero that means you're right on a 440 HZ is a this is reading 4391 so it's an electronic device pretty close so this will strike every time you strike you get a you get dead center a it's a it's a it's a all the time so this is a this one here is also a it's the it's the same it's been cast the same way it's been shaped the same way it's come from the same Forge the same Foundry so when it comes the same way when you strike it we get the same thing 4391 so relatively it's 440 Herz this is a so these two tuning Forks were cast out of the same cast they were designed the same way they're made in the same shape they come from the same Foundry from the same Forge they're the they're the they're the they give the same tone they resonate the same tone now every object has a natural frequency every object everything you tap you tap a glass there's a certain frequency it's giving a certain tone you you tap a metal cup a plastic cup a glass they all have a tone they all have a frequency everything has a natural vibration or a natural resonance that it that resonates at so this will always resonate when you strike it at 440 Herz every time you strike it and the same thing with a an empty cup that empty Cup every time you strike it it'll resonate the same frequency so everything on Earth everything has a fre frequency and so uh these two things have a frequency but I want to discuss something that's called sympathetic resonance because these two are the same they have the same resonance they have a they'll have a sympathetic resonance that means they resonate at the same rate and because they resonate at the same rate when I strike one because this has a sympathetic resonance it'll resonate at the same frequency as this this one so if I do that you can hear the tone and I can tell you they're both vibrating you don't know they're both vibrating but I'll show you that they're both vibrating so now when I strike this one and I stop it I never touched this one I didn't strike this one I didn't do anything to this tuning fork the only thing I did was strike this this one and because they came from the same Forge because they come from the original place together because they're the same they have the same natural resonance when I when the tone comes from one it influences the other and the influence from the other resonates the same sound it works backwards because they're the same they influence one another they're so perfect in this that we can make the influence go back and forth so I'm going to strike this one I'm going to deaden this so you can hear it here I'm going to take my hand off and let the one that's vibrating not the one I struck I'm going to let it influence the one that I de and then I'm going to D this one and you'll hear the tone over here I got I explained it to you cuz I have to do it quickly so we don't run out of vibration so they can influence each other back and forth cuz we can influence each other back and forth you can influence your brother one day and then something comes along and deadens you but then your brother can influence you right back amen because we all come from the same Source we come from the same Foundry we're all we all all have a part of God we all you remember the teaspoon of uh ocean water coming out of the ocean amen we've all come from the same place if we're brothers and sisters in Christ we all have uh a portion of God within us we have uh We've Come of the truth there's something of Truth within us there was something in us that was in that woman in Samaria that day when she was by the well and God was speaking to her in the form of a man Jesus Christ and something in her amen was moving was vibrating amen because why because she had had something to believe with on the inside she could resonate back when she turned around amen when she turned around and dropped her water pot and ran into the City and said come see a man that told me all things I ever knew is not this the Messiah you know what she was doing Jesus was the one who was struck but she was the Run resonating in town she was one giving the message she was declaring the message of the hour in the city of Samaria he was still back at the well with his discip Les so he rang she was influenced she picked it up she ran into the city she began to ring some of those who could catch the influence came out of the city and come to talk to Jesus themselves praise God Amen God is good amen now there's a little doohickey thing of a bobber here and that's good English if your grandparents are from Kentucky like mine this slips onto one of these tongs and you can slide it up and down and put it on here and what it does is it will change the vibration it'll change the frequency because I've added a weight so that thing will not oscillate at the same frequency that it did so if I strike it I'm getting a G sharp if I move it down I'll still be in the a but I'm a flat I think is that right flat a flat a I'm a flat a every time I sing it's flat so you can see down on the scale on the bottom here how it goes negative because we've changed the frequency by adding that that little thing but it's still it's still a we're still in a but we're not at 440 it's actually reading 430 so I'm at 4 30 Herz 430 to 440 is really close right you're talking 440 so this vibrates at 440 this vibrates at 430 that to me is close enough but with a slight change we're slightly off just a little bit off by 10 Hertz 440 430 let's go a little closer let's go back sorry wrong way here's 435 we're off by between four and five Hertz just a little bit off is off just a little bit off won't resonate these two things can't resonate because something's been added to this one now if I strike this one it won't resonate that one but if I take whatever's been extra an add-on that wasn't there in the original in The Foundry it'll resonate again just because we find we find this little doohickey on here thing I'm a bobber de Bob I'm using them all that doesn't change that this is still original something's been added to it something's got attached that needs to be unattached and when it gets unattached it'll go back to what it was originally intended to do and to the sound that it was originally intended to produce and you strike it and once again it resonates and it even resonates back praise be to God you remember the story brother B tells us of uh the uh Farmer and the eagle he took the little Eagle uh the eagle egg out of the nest and he took it down to a a chicken and he set it underneath the chicken and and that chicken set that eagle uh egg and it hatched out with the other chicks and it went through life thinking that it was a chicken and tried to be a chicken tried to do like a chicken never really fitting in all that well but one day it heard a sound mama and eagle flew over the Barnyard one day and let out a scream and when that when that screamed it resonated something inside of him he had a res it frequency whatever that frequency was and whatever he was deep down on the inside were a match and when that screamed the chickens ran because what was in the chickens is not the same that was in that eagle when Mama Eagle screamed she was operating at a different frequency than the chickens and the chickens scattered because they were afraid of that sound amen but as soon as for the first time that eagle first time in his life heard an eagle scream it resonated at a certain frequency and something inside of him began to vibrate just like something vibrated in the woman at the well when she was talking to Jesus cuz he was the eagle screaming and something in her could respond to the scream when millions of others when the Pharisees had nothing to believe with she had something to believe with because it came from the same Source same Foundry original seed inside of her and it could move praise God I like this amen I hope this helps us all amen I hope this helps the kids and the adults and all of us the res what was it in us what what what what was it that we heard we couldn't help it amen we heard the message we couldn't help it we couldn't stop it it didn't matter if it's inconvenient it didn't matter if it cost us it doesn't matter amen because we were founded this way we were in the original the seed inside of our soul had come from God there was nothing you could do to stop it when you heard the eagle scream something and you said what was that and you had heard so many things from the chickens about false prophets and false this and false that you may have been a little bit unsure I don't know it's I'm not so sure but you couldn't stop the resonation on the what was resonating on the inside you couldn't deny it you couldn't lie it off you could be confused in your mind you could have all kinds of voices trying to scare you you could even back up a little bit and hesitate but you could not stop the vibration down in the soul because you were founded that way amen that's the way you came from God Amen so now switch things up so we know that there's been a word for every age amen and God planted his seed for every age and he intended when that age would come forth and God as he was bringing his word up amen he was moving now don't take this as something negative now our de Bob was bad before but let's make it good now can we change our analogy so as God is is bringing back the word he's getting it more and more and more lined up to the original right and so that tone that came from Luther would attract a certain seed the Lutheran seed the tone as God would move down through time time and the tone would come through Wesley it was there to there was a certain seed for that age to respond to that tone but if we still tried to play the piece reading from Wesley Sheep music nothing nothing nothing am this here is waiting for something it's waiting to be moved it's waiting to be put into action it's got It's it's got a natural frequency that's laying here undiscovered and unrealized but yet it's there it's inherent to the object it's part of it it's built into it it's there already amen we don't have to put it in there it's already there so all we have to do is find the word for the age so that the seed and the word match together yes sir cuz brother bam said in God's only provided place of worship he said if I taught you Methodist message it would take no effect on you right it would have no effect on you uh this is bride time if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught moses' message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are lay are are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's give for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows in so this thing is sitting here waiting One Church another church another church but one day that's it that's what I've been waiting didn't know it amen listen th this if this is has never been struck before if it's never been plucked before this object doesn't even know how it resonates it's never been put in action it's never been struck it's never it's never been played I mean it's been cast it's been sent to the Earth but nothing's happened yet Amen to cause a sound to come out of it it doesn't know if it's an a it doesn't know if it's a b it doesn't know if it's a c doesn't know if it's a d it doesn't know if it's a g it doesn't know what it is and it's sitting here and it comes in contact with all these other things nothing moves but but one day it comes in contact with an eagle scream and then all of a sudden he says I'm an a I'm an a I know what I am I thought I was a Methodist I thought I was a Baptist I thought I was a Pentecostal I thought I was a Catholic but I realized I'm bride amen I'm part of the Bride because there was something that could awaken what I was inherent already built into me I had to come in contact with something that was the same as me so that I could resonate back what I heard and what I heard was matched to what I am and what I resonate back was a match to what I heard praise God praise God now in order to resonate I have to be in close proximity the closer I get the more it will resonate yes do you hear that we're getting a little [Music] closer we're getting a little closer there it is there it is you know what I want to be as close to this message as I can possibly get cuz the influence of this message is bringing the sound out of my life what was already Trapped In My Soul what was already there from the Forge from the master's Forge when he forged my my soul the SE that's in the soul that part that came from him when it came into this Earth the sound was already there it's already built to resonate the word to resonate by the word and to resonate the word amen so now the word strikes I resonate now the word strikes I resonate now somebody else resonates why because whatever whatever this sound was that hit me I have the capacity to resonate the same sound and when I resonate the same sound that's the word and when I resonate the word if somebody else has a c Gene of God in them then my resonation my life living the life of the word can cause a vibration in their soul that'll cause them to begin to resonate Whoever has been molded to a440 will resonate when it comes in contact with a440 that's why the bride becomes the word by receiving the word she becomes the word she becomes a440 praise God Almighty friends it's too good it's amazing I didn't realize we were going to have a science experiment today but God is in science because the laws of God amen we're created by God and they contain truth because he's the Creator and he doesn't create things false he doesn't create things that are a lie and we know that creation has been perverted so sometimes it's hard to still see because of the perversion amen but when you look under it all the creation of God was created by the person of Truth by the truth giver and then the creation still contains his fingerprint amen so now when we put these two together and we strike them both they will give the same note one steady clear note this is what God wants from his bride all of us he wants he wants us all to be giving that clear that clear Ting even the same sound Christ in bright form a Min member body resonating his life problem is sometimes we got stuff attached a Doctrine yeah a complex a fear if I strike this one now with my little extra attached I resonating at 426 Hertz let me see 426 Hertz is about 3% off from 440 approximately I know some of your mathematicians you're like no it's 2.75 I please I'm not a mathematician I'm not a scientist I'm not a musician I'm barely a high school graduate I dropped out of my second semester of University so when you when you see that this we know is 440 now we know this is this is a 3% variance now I don't know about you but 3% I don't think is really bad I mean if I get within 3% of most things I'm happy if I hit a baseball and it gets 3% of going out of the park I will be jumping up and down even if it's not a home run to me 3% is good but here's what 3% very sounds like you hear that w w it's created a beat because they're off the frequencies don't match and it's only a 3% variance see now if I change the tuning a bit see where we're at now now we're at 4:30 4:30 let me go down just a bit more yeah we're at almost 431 we're at a 2% variance this is only two this is only 2% different than this this is 430 almost 1 430.86 or what I said before 4391 2% difference you hear that that is an uncertain sound that's not a clear message to the world now let's change it once again we want to get closer right we always want to be closer so this is 434 let's see yeah this is a 1% difference roughly a 1% difference in tone in frequency so 1% most tolerances everywhere we live and even in engineering is is 1% usually pretty good you're in quality control right brother Gabe is 1% pretty good pretty good it mostly passes right yeah that's right so 1% you hear the whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa who 1% difference listen I'm a human being you're a human being if you're 1% off you're fine with me brother but when you hear it off is off like my mind I don't think it's that far off I can live with 1% as a human I'm just talking in my human nature 1% if you get close brother I see your effort I see your desire hey you're doing a good job we're getting close but when it comes to the sound off is off let's see if we can get a little closer let's go a little closer let's go a little closer so here we're about just over one Hertz difference one Hertz out of 440 Herz I'm about 1.2 off so we're just about one Hertz different one cycle difference between this and this out of scale of 440 whoa whoa whoa it still ain't right and you can tell yeah it may not look like much on paper it may not be a big deal on a lot of other things but the bride is going to stand on the word and the word only this is what God is growing us to this is what God is bringing us to this is where God wants us to be aligned with his word now don't get me wrong don't think brother Chad to never make a mistake I'm not talking about that but I'm talking about coming into an agreement with the word God is bringing us into agreement so that she will be him amen this is what the prophet told us he told us in so many ways she will be him she is his body Jesus Christ in the formation of his bride this is the goal in the end time this is the Capstone coming onto the New Testament Church so the bride will be in his very image and his very likeness so that when you strike both it's the same the word and her is the same the word preached and the word lived [Music] match when the message preaches the word we hear the prophet giving a certain sound and he's preaching to us the true interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication he's brought us back to 440a so that we can tune to this so that we know what the standard is we know what the Mark is we know what the word is amen this is he's restored to us the truth that was lost amen back to the faith of the original fathers he's brought us back to to a at 440 Hertz amen so this is what's preached but sometimes what's lived doesn't match what's preached and this is what gives an uncertain sound Hey listen and we've all been here this is where we've been trying to grow from amen none of us want this but we recognize we've had it in our lives amen and we don't like it it upsets us it disgusts us I don't want to be like this amen but what I'm going to have to do I'm just going to have to stay under the washing of the water of the word and not be influenced by another person like this but be influenced by the word that's this and as I hear it I'll go back and live it a nope God Wash Me by the water of the word and maybe make a little adjustment in life and God opens our eyes to something and we surrender something to him and then we hear the word preached oh God I'm so sorry is this our life that's is the way I live I didn't like the way that sounded Lord I'm so sorry I didn't like the way that happened and sometimes you don't catch it till you reflect back and know God I why did I say that that way why did I do that why did I oh God I'm so sorry and then we come back and we know this is right we know it we know it we know it we know it we know it we know it's right amen and we think this is [Music] right how many of you have perfect pitch and could tell the difference between 1 2% no when you don't have a reference this sounds great it's in the range of a it's on a scale a it's like a message believer it's a a a a it sounds good sounds good sounds good and as long as I come to another brother that's tuned the same way amen and he goes and then he goes H I'm like oh yeah we're the same yeah because we're the same we're okay I wish I had another de Bob but I only got one in my little kit here because I'd like to tune these the same and show you that just because they're the same doesn't mean they're right just because you can come to a church where everybody in the church sounds the same it doesn't make it a at 440 Hertz it's only only a at 440 HZ when it's a at 440 Hertz so everybody sounds like this my mom my dad my pastor the deacons my best friend and we all sound good together and when we all do it together it's beautiful it's a and it is a but this is perfect a this is a this is perfect a so we all get together and we all like the way we sound together and when we're all living our Christian Life and we're all message Believers in a it's beautiful till we play a tape oo still not right you see how perfect it was that God sent us a message to bring us back to a at 440 yeah you know why we have to keep listening to those tapes and keep listening to those tapes and keep coming together in fellowship and keep hearing the preaching of the word is because we've got to come to a at 4:40 now here's the reality of what's been going on and not a condemnation just a reality I wish I had another de Bob cuz what's been happening is the preacher's not been at a 440 and the congregation's not been at a440 and we're always make we're trying to get to a440 all right none of us needs to none of us needs to walk out of here and say I'm at a440 what you need to say is I want to be at a440 be careful be careful because you can be at a 435 but we don't want to be at a435 this is not a close enough game I want to be him she will be him I want to get tuned up and tuned in and changed in whatever way I have to change and shave down and whatever is holding me back I need to have it removed friends this is why for 60 years for some for 60 years for me for 25 years what I've been doing is I've been saying God change me change me change me adjustment adjustment adjustment adjustment adjustment change me God because I want to be at 440a amen I got into a discussion one time with the minister and and the brother was telling me you have to be balanced brother Chad you have to be balanced in your approach to preaching I've shared this with you before you have to be balanced in your approach to preaching and I said well I agree with that brother remember said we should be balanced the problem is what's my reference for balance that's really important because if I believe that I'm balanced then I'm judging balance based off my perspective and my position right that's like me judging a perfect a by this you don't sound like me you're not and when I shared with the brothers I said you you know what brother the problem is I don't know if I'm balanced or not the reality is I don't know if I'm balanced if I'm off by two degrees but I think that I'm balanced then I judge everybody off two degrees so my judgment is no longer correct this is why we have to be careful how we judge one another very careful because if I'm off two degrees this way and you're off two degrees that way we both think each other's off but we don't realize we're both off you look at me and say that brother's pretty far off well I'm closer than you think because you're judging me four degrees away but I'm only 2° off do you understand if I'm 2° this way you're two let's say 10° I'm 10° this way you're 10° that way to you I'm way off to me your way off but we're both closer to Center than we realize that's why we got to be careful how we judge one another because the brother you're judging he's probably off but he may be closer than you realize and he may be closer than you are you understand I'm 10° off and he's 5 Dees off he's closer to right than I am but to me he's way off amen but he's closer than I [Music] am so I can no longer reference where everybody else is based off me I can only reference it by the word the word the word a440 the message that God give us it's the thing we're all trying to line up to every one of us are trying to get to a440 a that's God's goal for his bride and this day that's what he's trying to accomplish in Us in this day is a440 amen amen so it's a big problem friends when we don't have a reference point yes so for years we're going through adjustments is anybody going through adjustments I hope my a sounds more like it did when I cuz I thought I was a but I realize now that I was G sharp I didn't know it then but I know it now cuz I've gotten closer to a and the problem is here's the next thing I really don't know how far off I am yes I just know I'm off I don't know but I trust one thing God sent an a440 for a reason God gave us something to tune by if I want to tune a piano I can use a440 a to tune a piano if I want to tune a guitar I can use an a440 a to tune a guitar if I want a tune a cello I can use an a440 to tune a cello is that right God gave us an a440 A so that we could get tuned into God's frequency so let's say we go back to thinking we're an A or a G sharp giving an uncertain sound when played against a440 it really begins to show how far off I am but you know what the reality is I am still inside an a44 I was cast as an a44 I was fashioned to be in a440 a something along the way got attached to me that is not part of the original mold and guess what something got attached to you and you and you and you and you and you and you amen something got attached to us that wasn't part of the original and we've been striving our whole lives to get all the attachments off all the wrong understanding all the wrong doctrines all the complexes all the fears all the things that cause us to resonate back amen the wrong kind of frequency that's giving an uncertain sound and God by his purging and the washing of the water of the word is promised us in this day that he can wash all of the things away every Dilly bob every thing ofama every doad everything that got attached to us whether our parents put on us or another preacher put it on or a church put it on us or whatever however it got there whether we put it on ourselves by our own foolish decisions God has a washing of the water of the word that'll wash away everything that's not the original so that we can come back to being what we were predestinated to be we were predestinated to be [Music] a440 this is where we're coming to this is our destination this is the goal this is why we pray this is why we fast this is why we come to church this is why we read the books this is why we listen to the tapes this is why we rub shoulders with each other so iron can sharpen an iron this is why amen we have knockdowns and beatdowns and blessings and all kinds of things because we're getting tuned up to play a440 and we get we get knocked about and we have all kinds of things that are going wrong but what God is trying to get us to do is realize I was always meant to be this this is what he intended from the very beginning this is me in my original form things got attached to it that shouldn't have been there amen but God's moving all the attachments away until finally at the end of it all when we can finally ring out a440 the last de Bob to come off is this flesh when these atoms change amen so that we can resonate Body Soul and Spirit the right tone the right sound and the right note amen this this this analogy Works in so many places in our lives if we look at this in a home if Mom's here and Dad's here it just ain't right it just ain't right if my brother's here and I'm here it just ain't right we can hear it you don't even need me to pull up the the tuner you know it's off in a marriage when it gets off it's just off everyone around you knows it it's just off your fellowship with a brother when it gets off it's just off the relationships around is when they're off they're just off they don't give the right tone what we need is to get whatever is attached out of the way we need to get tuned up we need to get brought back into what God originally so our marriage is this our fellowship is this our expression is this the headship of Christ the body of the Bride the word the life amen comes to a place where tell you can't tell the difference is that what the prophet said he's doing in this day he's getting to the place where she will be so much like him she will be him and I am confident that God gave us an a440 so that we all can tune up to that sound we should we should be in the message more than we ever were before we should be in that word constantly because it's it's the tuning fork to match our lives too we should be in the scripture in the the message in Fellowship in the word every opportunity we've got getting as close as we can so that we begin to resonate back this word and this word only until in the end of it all the bride is resonating not oh my goodness where she's resonating 44A right till the word strikes and the bride lives and then there's no difference between the two she is the word think of it this way when the word's preached what comes off of that it's sound waves air is moving take the air as the Holy Spirit the word is preached the spirit moves the spirit strikes your soul and when the spirit strikes your soul guess what comes out of you a440 by what mechanism not because this touched that not because this touched that but because the spirit of the word touched your soul and when the spirit of the word comes into your soul you begin to resonate a440 because this and this are the same because the word and you what you what was intended to be you the C Gene of God and you are the same so now when you come down to the end of it which one's the word what differentiates them what's different what's different between the word and the bride at the end of it all when it's all capped off when God finally has the expression he wants he's got a people on Earth that's submitted and surrendered to him that'll stand on his word and his word only and the word is alive in him what becomes the difference it's the same sound it's the same expression it's the same manifestation it becomes the same thing that's what the prophet has taught us that's what I want more than anything in this world I want to play an a440 I want to be correct I want to be tuned up I want to be part of this word I want to be the word amen I want to look at just I want to wrap up here I'm just going to read a couple couple things to you and then we'll finish says brother B tells this uh story here actually I want to read this scripture and then I'll go to the story let's go to Matthew 11 Matthew 11 16 in Matthew 11:16 he says but where unto shall I liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets calling unto their fellows and saying we have piped unto you and you have not danced we have mourned unto you and you have not lamented it's an interesting scripture and there's a reason I used it what he's saying is you gave no response I piped to you and you didn't resp respond I I I mourned and you didn't lay me what what's he saying that you didn't respond to the call there was nothing in you to respond I piped and you didn't dance let that not be us amen the message is piping let's dance let's respond let's have something inside of us that responds to the sound to the voice of God Amen and so I want to if I could read this here in the message Fellowship from 55 brother B's talking about radio waves and how radio waves are passing through the room right now they're invisible there's voices moving through here but you cannot hear them says the radio coming through the air the words we can't hear them with our ears we can't pick it up but the crystal in the radio picks it up the television the same it becomes positive and when our intellectual faith comes down into the heart and becomes so charged with the Unseen World that every word of God becomes a positive truth you see what I mean when God says it it echoes against it just like it does on the crystal in the radio and makes it perfect so brother B uses this this analogy many times with a radio or TV there's waves that are moving through the air amen you can't see them you can't hear them you can't touch them there has to be something designed to receive those waves and when that something designed receives those waves what it does is it takes the waves through a mechanism that was engineered and prepared ahead of time to pick up the waves it now converts the waves and begin to speak back what the waves say not a different voice not a new voice they don't change it whatsoever so that whatever was coming through the Airways when it strikes the crystal it's reproduced into the ears of The Listener amen what could not be heard now is heard Amen in the TV what could not be seen now is seen well I tell you friends there's an unseen Force that's been Unleashed now and it's the very spirit of God and the world can't see it amen but we've got a crystal that can pick it up on the inside and what are we designed to do we are God's television set we're here Amen to replicate the image that nobody else can see Jesus Christ is not still in the body of Flesh walking on the Sea of Galilee that he can't be touched the woman with the blood issue Can't Touch the Hem of His Garment the blind man can't ask him to spit in clay anymore they can't touch that amen but that unseen life is still here amen it's still moving but there's Crystal sets here there's people amen with something inside that can pick it up and when they pick it up what are they going to replicate not a new picture not a different picture not a distorted picture but the same picture from The Unseen now in manifestation amen we talk about the word amen the word is a person the word is a life amen the word has a spirit amen the world can't see the word amen you can talk you can point Amen to to Ink on paper but that's not seeing the word amen that's seeing words but not the word nobody can see the word amen the only way the world will see the word is when the word strikes something that can receive the word and it translates amen through a mechanism that can be displayed or projected to the world and that happens to be our life amen our bodies as it's surrendered to God can now manifest the very life of Jesus Christ so that the Unseen Force becomes tangible visible Amen on Earth again amen when that gets tuned in amen amen I am not a very old person but I remember things from the past that people think are old I remember as a boy having a television with the bunny ears you know no cable but amen and remember how you had to tune it a little bit to get the signal just right because you had to get the frequency just right to get the picture clear and it would be a little bit fuzzy you could tell there's something there and I could pretty much yeah this is the show that I'm looking for but then you've got a little adjustment and you got to tune it to so that you're you're matched to the frequency and when you match the frequency it becomes clear and you see the picture listen we're picking up the signal but I'm asking God to tune the dial because I want to give the right projection of what's coming and when the dial gets tuned in what's the difference between the Unseen force and what people see it's the word coming and the word expressed the word invisible and the word visible when God's done with this she will be the word amen you say how far away are we brother Chad I have no idea I just know that when it Tings sometimes it just still doesn't sound right getting close but the just to me there's got to be there's got to be some more tuneup I don't I don't ever want to get to the place where I'm sitting here saying I've got it I'm bride I'm this I'm that amen and and putting out a fuzzy picture where people can't even is that Jesus or is it not Jesus I I'm trying to see between all the fuzzy lines and the distorted picture Twisted is that Jesus or is that and I want be walking around saying I'm bride I'm this and people are looking at that kind of a picture it doesn't mean I'm wrong it doesn't mean I'm not it doesn't mean I'm not the receiver said it doesn't mean I don't have the right signal everything's right I'm the one who's made to project it I've got the crystal on the inside the tube is in me that can pick it up I'm catching the right signal the right signal is coming into me from the message I'm the one predestined at and engineered and designed to do it but I'm just not tuned up exactly right I'm really close but just tune me up and I don't want ever get to the place where I don't realize I still need some tuning up because then I'll refuse to hear the word as a tuning fork I'll hear it as my Vindication and say I'm right I'm with that and not even know that everyone around me is hearing wah wah wah wah wah wah wah because when it's off it's off yeah amen amen when it's off it's off but God's going to get it on cuz he's promised he will and I believe we're the generation that's going to see it but it's not going to come by arrogance it's not going to come by Pride it's not going to come by self assurance it's going to come by staying close to that tuning fork all the time and saying God I want to be what that is make me your your word tune Me Up Lord change me and be willing to recognize yeah I need some work I need some work I need some things taken off my tuning fork got a complex here that causes me always to react to Authority this way I can't trust people I get angry whenever I I feel like somebody's hurting my feelings I've reserved and I don't want to talk to anybody because I've been hurt before and all of these little things that got attached to us along the way I don't want to say that's just the way that I am because the way that I'm intended to be is what he predestinated me to be not what not what somebody's attached to me and I'm caring and have to live with that's not God's purpose for me if it's obstructing me if it's stopping me from giving a clear sound if it's hindering me from ringing a true manifestation of Jesus Christ then it's got to go it's got to go and I believe it will go by the washing of the water of the word staying in by the tuning fork and willing to be adjusted and adjusted and adjusted and adjusted again amen I remember one time when Blake was learning to play the uh mandolin I think it was he was playing and we watched the the we we looked up on a video on how to I don't know I don't remember what it was I think it was a workshop somebody was doing on playing the mandolin so I was watching that with them and after every song they tuned their instrument again after every song they tuned the instrument again and when you're watching this it's really boring tingting tingting tingting Ting tingting and when you just wanted to play another song you're just like and the guy stopped and he said somebody asked me one time am I obsessed with tuning cuz that's kind of what I was thinking you got a problem you're OCD you are you obsessed with tuning and he he he he confessed that he doesn't even enjoy the process of tuning he likes playing his instrument he says I'm not obsessed with tuning I'm obsessed with being in [Music] tune praise Lord I think we should get obsessed with being in tune why are you constantly analyzing your life why are you constantly praying why are you constantly allowing uh why are you constantly sitting there taking correction from the pit why are you listening to that tape again why are you saying you're sorry to me again why are you going back and confessing something you've done why are you trying to make something right why because I'm obsessed with being in tune I want to be obsessed with being in tune with him because that's where I'm living that's the day that we live in that's the objective that's why God sent a message that's why God gave us something to reference off of listen he wouldn't have supplied it if it wasn't the day to be a perfect day he gave a perfect day in the season for a perfect day and I I don't know if you've ever tuned to guitar like I said I'm no no musician but when my kids were little and they were first learning stuff they would always say Dad can you help me with this Dad I don't know how to do this and dad doesn't have a clue what he's doing so we just have to watch a video and we have to try it and then we have to get frustrated and so then you get the little tuning app on your phone and you tune it and it's and it's flat okay it's flat and you tighten it it's flat it's tighten it and then ping it pops and now you're way sharp now you loosen it and then you loosen it nothing happens and I'm no musician so I don't know what happen I didn't realize that it still got friction and locked on the the the bridge here so you got to pluck it a little bit so it vibrates so it'll loosen up where you loosened it and so here we're overshooting undershooting overshooting undershooting overshooting undershooting you know what I've been doing for the last 25 years overshooting unders shooting overshooting undershooting but you know what was happening the whole time little bit closer little bit closer little bit closer I won't tell you the time I was in a holy the wrong octave but all I was looking what was a I didn't even know what those little numbers meant why are we in the thousands I don't know this is our life we've been put here to ring a true sound not an uncertain sound a true ring of the word a true tone that matches this Bible so that when you pluck this Bible and you pluck lives what do you get it's the New Testament that's all what is the word bride that's the New Testament that's all she's just the word made flesh she's just The Word Alive amen so that this and this are the same thing man God bless you let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come I pray that that little object lesson was helpful I certainly enjoyed myself looking at it it was fun I want to read to you a quote as the musicians come I want to read two ones out of the invisible union he said oh the spiritual union of Christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flesh what are they doing it's getting tuned up manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day then in the message Shalom I want to leave you with this man could close his mortal eyes to Earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ when you see his word being beat out and the great sympathy he he means symp Symphony that we're living in changing you must begin in the symphony the only thing you can do if you're in the symphony then you start you begin to get into the Rhythm that's the way you do God you don't stand off and look at it you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it into the rhythm of the word when you become part of the word he he's talking about in the in the message Shalom he's talking about the great Symphony and how there's changing Junctions and changing beats and you got to follow the conductor and the sheet music amen which is the Holy Ghost and the word of God and you got to pay attention so you can play your part right and you he says you can't stand off and just stand off from it and wait but you got to get into the rhythm of it so you can feel the music and get in the time and if your part is just to play the little Ting there in one spot brother B said nobody else can take your place if you're going to play the High symbol you got to play The High symbol when the sheet music calls for it and when the conductor signals for it you got to play The High symbol you can't just stand off you can't Mill around you can't go out and get a drink amen you're going to miss the whole thing but you got to be in the Rhythm and the feel and the motion of the symphony this can't be Sunday only this can't be church when it feels good it can't be when I feel like it amen it can't be listening to a tape once in a while that's not going to work we got to get into the rhythm of the music friends amen and then we know how to play our part cuz we're watching the conductor we're watching the sheet music and when everything comes right I'm in the Rhythm I'm feeling the motion the the the EB and the flow brother brother starts talking about crescendos and it's building to a spot and you can feel it building and you know we're getting there amise God do you feel it building yeah we're building to a crescendo friends we've all got our part to play here in the end time let's stay in the rhythm of the music get our instrument tuned up so that we can play our part so that we can manifest Christ the anointed word for this dayen let's bow our heads to pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for your abundant mercy and Grace in our lives God how can we thank you enough when the world is in utter confusion you sent us a clear sound yes when the world is muddled with voices ideas theologies and Concepts you sent a true 440a God we're all trying to get tuned to that you know our hearts Lord that's why we're here tonight that's why we come on Wednesday and Sunday that's why we listen to the message we feed on the Bible that's why we're constantly Lord trying to stay tuned up God we acknowledge we need your help yes sometimes we don't know that we're a little flat or a little sharp we don't realize sometimes Lord so you and your graciousness you send a voice our way whether it be on tape or it be in a pull pit you send a voice whether it be a friend somebody a spouse he send somebody to show us that we're a little bit off God help us to surrender to those calls help us not to fight back or get angry or assume everybody else is wrong but help us to recognize Lord you're only trying to bring us into a perfect note you're trying to get us to play our part in the right Rhythm the perfect time in tune oh that's your goal because it's a marvelous marvelous Symphony that you've laid out it's beautiful music Lord that you want to play at the end time it's the crescendo it's the climax it's the most glorious part and you've called us to take part in this great Symphony in the end time help us Lord to surrender to you and acknowledge Lord that we need you every day that we need you to tune us up to help us to open our eyes sharpen our ear Lord so that we can be critical of ourselves Lord your Bible told us to judge ourselves that we wouldn't be judged give us an ear to hear where we're off the mark and then give us a humble heart to say Lord help tune me up I'm off your mark God we can't do this without you but we believe wholeheartedly that we're here because this is what you want to do that this is not just what you want to do this is what you will do for you've predestinated your bride not to fail in the end time God you already spoke through the mouth of a prophet that this end time bride will be so much like you that she will be you God it's an impossible order it's an impossible task for us to accomplish on our own but you've given us every tool you've given us a true tone to follow a perfect day you've given us the washing of the water of the word you've given us a conductor here your holy ghost that will help us you've given us an understanding of the Sheep music you've given everything we need now all we need to do is surrender and let you keep working on us so that we can become what you intended us to be we love you father I'm asking God that you bring us Lord into that Perfect Image that you had of us before the foundation of the world and we trust that you will as we keep listening to that perfect tone we love you God we ask your blessings over your people as we part in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may God may God bless you as you go and I want to encourage you with just two thoughts if you could leave here just with two things that become part of your understanding part of your vocabulary one I don't know if I'm balanced or not not but I'm seeking balance that's honest friends I'm seeking balance where we get in error is when we believe we're already balanced if we believe that as a church as a ministry as individuals we're going to find ourselves sidelined somewhere off the mark But if we could have the attitude I don't know if I'm balanced if I'm off I don't even know how far off I really am but I am seeking balance with all that's in me if we could walk away with that understanding I don't know if I'm in tune or not but I am obsessed with being in tune if you could walk out of here those those two thoughts I'm obsessed with being in tune and I don't know if I'm balanced or not but I'm seeking balance and let those two things Drive our life I think we're going to get a lot further ahead a lot faster I think we're going to reach that destination I know we're going to reach that destination but I want to reach it with a fewer hiccups than what I've had in the past amen God bless you all may God be with you as we part I feel the pool [Music] I hear the call and I know his spir moving me to give my all he speaks to me and I agree I agree Lord please come and take control I feel the
