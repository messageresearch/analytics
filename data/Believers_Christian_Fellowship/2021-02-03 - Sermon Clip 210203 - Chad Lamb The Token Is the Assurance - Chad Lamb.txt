TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but i've never had an experience that i've been filled with the holy ghost that i can put my foot on all right notice this brother man's gonna he's gonna fix this all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of human being sister bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once but what changed it she says christ there you are sister that's it what's complicated about that amen the holy ghost is for you receive it amen say god i receive it you promised me that gift i've done everything you asked me to do amen you provided the faith to believe your word you're the one who pricked me in the heart and i cried out what should i do you said repent i've repented lord you said be baptized in your name i've been baptized in your name and you told me i shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and i'm here lord receiving your gift [Music] because that's what the word says amen and when that gift comes to you it will change you your soul will change amen it's not just saying well i accept it i believe it those are words words don't mean anything but there has to be an experience amen brother branham was clear on that you have to have the experience of the new birth i mean we don't go back to preaching a baptist doctrine of you you receive the holy ghost when you believe brother branham was dead set against that because there's a lot of intellectual faith saying i believe now saying that i've got the holy ghost because i believe but he said you've got to have an experience there must be an experience of the baptism the holy ghost but he never attached it to any fleshly emotional evidence or sensation he said what is the experience brother brennan makes it clear the experience is a changed life that is the experience that you went through the experience of i was one way and now i'm different and i didn't change myself it wasn't alcoholics anonymous it wasn't a self-help book amen it wasn't willpower it wasn't turning a new leaf at the new year none of that worked amen but there was a supernatural power that changed me from the inside what is that amen that's the experience amen of the baptism of the holy ghost of the new birth and that's what brother bam said you have to have it can't just be a mental acknowledgement and a verbal declaration but you have to have that experience you have to change your desires have to change your thinking has to change your loves have to change
