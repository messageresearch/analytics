[6:10] amen praise god i mean what we're
[6:14] standing let's take our bibles and go to
[6:15] hebrews chapter 11.
[6:17] it's going to say it's wonderful to be
[6:19] together again
[6:21] and thank god for the atmosphere amen
[6:26] hebrews chapter 11 we're going to
[6:27] continue on
[6:29] this would be part 12 of religion versus
[6:31] relationship
[6:32] and i there was some thoughts i touched
[6:34] on at the end of sunday but i didn't
[6:36] really have a time
[6:37] or opportunity to go into it so i just
[6:39] felt today
[6:40] just the inspiration to back up and grab
[6:42] that and just expound on it
[6:44] a little bit and so i'd like to subtitle
[6:46] this the word is in her
[6:49] the word is in her and i would like to
[6:51] begin in hebrews 11
[6:53] and reading verse 11 again hebrews 11
[6:56] 11.
[6:58] through faith also sarah herself
[7:00] received strength to conceive
[7:02] seed and was delivered of a child when
[7:05] she was past
[7:05] age because she judged him faithful who
[7:07] had promised
[7:09] therefore sprang there even of one and
[7:11] him as good as dead
[7:12] so many as the stars of the sky and the
[7:14] multitude
[7:15] and is the sand which is by the seashore
[7:18] innumerable
[7:20] you can see here that the fulfillment of
[7:22] the prophecy that was given to abraham
[7:25] god had promised abraham that he would
[7:27] have seed he promised him he told
[7:30] him to come out and look up in the
[7:31] heavens and count the stars if you can
[7:33] and and he told him so shall thy seed be
[7:36] so there was a prophecy there that was
[7:37] given to abraham
[7:39] and god was going to perform this
[7:40] prophecy amen but we found now that the
[7:43] prophecy was
[7:44] contingent upon a woman
[7:47] and now that's why here in in hebrews it
[7:50] says by faith abraham
[7:52] he he left you know when he was called
[7:54] he left and went into a strange land
[7:57] he did that by faith but when it come
[7:59] time to perform the
[8:01] fulfill the promise of seed coming forth
[8:04] to fulfill that promise
[8:06] god was going to have to through faith
[8:09] he's going to make a way through faith
[8:11] that sarah herself
[8:13] receives strength to conceive seed
[8:16] because when god made the promise to
[8:17] abraham
[8:18] it included sarah
[8:22] praise god let's bow our heads and ask
[8:24] the lord's blessing over the word this
[8:26] evening
[8:27] lord jesus we thank you for the
[8:29] privilege of gathering once again
[8:32] and lord may we never take these
[8:33] opportunities lightly
[8:35] god help us to fight the tendency to
[8:38] make it a tradition or
[8:40] just another wednesday night or just
[8:42] another service a routine of life
[8:44] an obligation on the calendar something
[8:48] we do as a family lord may we fight
[8:49] all of that may we come to you fresh
[8:52] right now saying lord we want to hear
[8:55] from you we come here to worship you
[8:57] we come here to receive from you that
[8:59] way we have need of lord
[9:00] it's not a routine it's not another
[9:02] service lord this is the time this is
[9:04] the moment you've called us you've drawn
[9:06] us
[9:07] this is our life this is where time and
[9:09] eternity meet is in the now
[9:12] and god we're asking that you would come
[9:13] and break the bread of life for us
[9:15] that the eternal things would become the
[9:17] reality for us
[9:19] and all the carnal things would begin to
[9:21] fade away
[9:22] god i pray that you set our affections
[9:24] on things on high
[9:25] and lord that you would lift us lord out
[9:27] of the natural and into the supernatural
[9:30] by your word we ask that you would take
[9:32] control of this vessel
[9:33] lord and speak your word in jesus
[9:36] christ's name we pray
[9:37] amen you can be seated
[9:42] so you can see although the promise in
[9:44] the word was
[9:45] to abraham because sarah was a part of
[9:48] abraham she was
[9:49] also included in that promise because
[9:52] adam was given a bride
[9:53] to reproduce himself that's what the
[9:55] bride was given for
[9:56] christ was given a bride amen to do the
[9:59] same thing
[10:00] and so now we know abraham has a
[10:03] has a bride he has sarah he has a wife
[10:06] but when god made the promise to abraham
[10:08] it included sarah so sarah was going to
[10:11] have to receive faith amen
[10:13] and through faith sarah received
[10:16] strength to conceive seed
[10:18] so god couldn't leave sarah out of this
[10:20] promise
[10:22] she was part of it in fact she was
[10:25] contingent
[10:26] upon the whole fulfillment of the
[10:28] prophecy was dependent upon sarah
[10:31] amen so god was going to have to do
[10:33] something for sarah
[10:34] sarah was going to have to get into the
[10:36] right condition
[10:37] so god by his grace and his mercy and
[10:40] this for ordained plan
[10:41] was going to get her into the right
[10:43] condition let's go back to genesis 21.
[10:47] we went all through this on sunday but
[10:49] we just want to touch this
[10:51] as we take this subject we we now find
[10:54] out that in that in
[10:57] chapter 18 18 1 we know that the lord
[11:00] appeared unto him in the plains of
[11:02] memory
[11:03] and he sat in the tent door in the heat
[11:04] of the dead as he sat in the tender the
[11:06] heat of the day
[11:07] and he lifted up his eyes and he looked
[11:09] and three men so this
[11:10] we know is when the lord comes to
[11:12] abraham and
[11:14] and we he sees three forms but he says
[11:16] lord because he recognizes the lord
[11:19] and now that was a visitation to abraham
[11:21] and in that visitation
[11:23] it was elohim in flesh and that elohim
[11:26] and flesh was discerning the
[11:28] thoughts and intents of the heart the
[11:30] thoughts of the heart and sarah and the
[11:31] tent behind him
[11:33] and so now the now the discernment was
[11:35] being performed upon sarah
[11:37] and he says why did sarah laugh and
[11:38] sarah said i didn't laugh and he said
[11:40] you did
[11:42] and so now there was this whole episode
[11:44] in
[11:45] genesis 18 now this visitation of elohim
[11:49] and flesh
[11:49] and the and the sign of the messiah the
[11:52] discernment
[11:53] amen it gave them faith and by faith
[11:55] they were turned
[11:56] back young again and then we know now in
[11:59] verse 20 they go down into gerar and go
[12:01] and in gerar now abimelech the king
[12:04] wants sarah for his own amen and she's
[12:07] been turned back
[12:08] young again but though she's been turned
[12:12] back young again
[12:13] she even made the statement she said
[12:15] shall i being old have pleasure with my
[12:17] lord
[12:17] him also being old amen so now she was
[12:21] brother graham said they were past the
[12:22] time amen of family relations but
[12:25] that was going to be restored
[12:28] that was going to be restored under this
[12:30] sign of the messiah they were going to
[12:32] be turned back young again
[12:33] and they could go back to what they were
[12:35] when they were first married
[12:37] but yet there still was not a conception
[12:42] so now we come to chapter 21.
[12:46] and in chapter 21 it said in the lord
[12:50] visited sarah
[12:54] the lord visited sarah
[12:58] he had come to abraham in a dream he had
[13:00] come to abraham in a vision
[13:02] he had come to abraham in flesh but now
[13:06] the lord in order to bring this promise
[13:09] amen all
[13:09] to pass amen god was going to give sarah
[13:13] faith to conceive and god god
[13:16] visited sarah as he had said
[13:20] and the lord did unto sarah he had
[13:22] spoken for sarah conceived and bear
[13:25] abraham a son in his old age
[13:27] at the set time of which god had spoken
[13:30] to him
[13:31] this in verse 21 gives us no other
[13:34] details there's no
[13:35] there's no signs there's no
[13:36] manifestations there's no great meetings
[13:39] there's just a private visitation of the
[13:41] lord
[13:43] and in the private visitation of the
[13:45] lord amen he confirms the promise
[13:48] and now the promise is going to be a
[13:50] conception
[13:51] and that conception is going to be
[13:53] inside of sarah
[13:55] and now in sarah is going to be the
[13:58] promised word amen
[14:00] that word is going to begin to manifest
[14:03] and as it begins to manifest it's going
[14:05] to take a private visitation the lord is
[14:07] going to visit
[14:08] sarah and when he visits sarah now
[14:10] there's going to be a conception
[14:12] and that conception is going to be the
[14:13] fulfillment of the promise
[14:15] and the fulfillment of the promise is
[14:17] coming into her
[14:18] and now she is carrying the very
[14:20] fulfillment of the promise
[14:24] and nobody saw anything
[14:27] there was no public show there was no
[14:29] great meeting there was no great there
[14:31] was no great powerful demonstration
[14:33] for the eye to see but the powerful
[14:35] demonstration was something that was
[14:37] coming
[14:38] inside of sarah and it was the
[14:40] confirmation of the promise that god had
[14:42] made
[14:42] now was coming alive inside of sarah for
[14:46] by faith
[14:46] through faith she was given strength to
[14:48] conceive
[14:51] and the lord visited sarah
[14:55] and she conceived and now as she's
[14:57] walking around
[14:59] nobody can tell that something has
[15:02] changed
[15:02] not every nobody around her can tell but
[15:05] she knows herself
[15:08] because she received the visitation
[15:12] now she knows it's changed and then it
[15:14] begins to manifest
[15:15] her whole being begins to change
[15:18] everything around her
[15:19] becomes becomes subject to the life
[15:22] that's on the inside
[15:25] and then we know sarah brings forth and
[15:27] and brings forth the promised son
[15:32] we go on let's continue reading down
[15:34] through here
[15:37] verse 3 and abraham called the name of
[15:40] his son that was born unto him whom
[15:42] sarah bear to him isaac
[15:44] and abraham circumcised his son isaac
[15:47] being eight days old as god had
[15:48] commanded him
[15:49] and abraham was a hundred years old when
[15:51] his son isaac was born unto him
[15:53] and sarah said god hath made me to laugh
[15:55] so that all that hear me will laugh with
[15:57] me
[15:58] and she said who would have said unto
[16:00] abraham that sarah should give him
[16:02] children
[16:03] should give children suck for i have
[16:05] borne him a son in his old age
[16:07] and the child grew and was weaned and
[16:10] abraham made a great feast
[16:11] the same day that isaac was weaned and
[16:14] sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian
[16:18] which she had borne unto abraham mocking
[16:20] wherefore she said unto
[16:22] abraham cast out this bondwoman
[16:25] cast out this bondwoman and her son for
[16:27] the son of this bondwoman shall not be
[16:29] heir with my son even with isaac and the
[16:33] thing was very
[16:34] grievous in abraham's sight because of
[16:36] his son
[16:37] and god said unto abraham let it not be
[16:40] grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[16:42] and because of the bondwoman in all that
[16:44] sarah has said
[16:46] oh praise god and all that sarah
[16:50] sarah was the one who talked to abraham
[16:53] the first time
[16:54] and told him this is how we're going to
[16:56] bring about the word
[16:57] god has he's shut me off from bearing
[17:00] children it's not possible for me
[17:02] and now we're going to take my handmaid
[17:04] and you go into my handmaid and she'll
[17:06] raise up seed for us
[17:07] it was sarah's idea it was sarah's
[17:10] thought
[17:10] it was sarah's way of intellectually
[17:13] bringing the word to pass
[17:16] and it brought corruption amen it
[17:19] brought a hybrid product
[17:20] it brought a corrupt product amen and so
[17:23] she
[17:23] spoke in which she spoke according to
[17:25] her own wisdom according to her own
[17:27] understanding according to what her eyes
[17:29] could see and what she could understand
[17:31] it brought forth an ishmael but now
[17:34] something has changed and sarah
[17:36] sarah has now come in contact with god
[17:39] the lord has visited her
[17:40] amen the mystery has been revealed to
[17:42] her and now she has conceived the word
[17:48] and her whole understanding has changed
[17:51] amen everything that she thought was
[17:52] logical and reasonable
[17:54] and made sense before now she saw the
[17:56] failure of it all
[17:58] because she had come and the lord had
[18:01] visited her
[18:02] and she conceived on the word and now
[18:03] she's brought forth the word
[18:05] now her eyes are open her understanding
[18:08] has changed
[18:09] everything about her is different now
[18:11] and now she knows that these two
[18:13] can't dwell together anymore
[18:17] and that's where god is bringing his
[18:18] bride to amen that she's got a
[18:20] visitation from the lord
[18:22] amen son the word has been quickened
[18:24] inside of this bride
[18:25] and now she knows that what we used to
[18:28] think was okay
[18:29] what we used to the way we used to try
[18:31] to serve god
[18:32] the way we used to try to fulfill his
[18:33] word the way we used to think was right
[18:36] amen it's not right and it won't work
[18:38] and now cast out this bondwoman
[18:42] and when you come in contact with the
[18:44] lord when you come in contact with the
[18:45] seventh seal
[18:46] and the seventh seal mystery is unlocked
[18:48] in your life and you conceive on the
[18:50] word and the word comes into you
[18:52] everything in your understanding changes
[18:55] amen now you realize
[18:57] why it was a failure why it wouldn't
[18:59] work why denominations will never
[19:01] fulfill the word of god
[19:02] why human reasoning and wisdom and
[19:04] intellect will never be god's way
[19:06] now all of a sudden you understand why
[19:11] and you say cast it out lord
[19:16] cast out the bondwoman
[19:20] verse 12 again and god said unto abraham
[19:22] let it not be grievous in thy sight
[19:24] because the lad
[19:25] and because of thy bond woman and all
[19:27] that sarah hath said
[19:29] unto thee hearken under her voice
[19:33] so now sarah has a voice
[19:36] and the voice of sarah is the word of
[19:39] god
[19:41] and god is backing it up and saying that
[19:44] it's right
[19:47] and that sarah has said unto thee
[19:49] hearken unto her voice for an isaac
[19:51] shall thy
[19:52] seed be called
[19:55] let's turn to galatians chapter four
[20:00] i said we've we went through this we
[20:02] touched on this sunday but i want to
[20:03] take a little more time
[20:06] galatians chapter 4
[20:12] verse 30. the apostle paul is speaking
[20:15] now and he says nevertheless
[20:17] what saith the scripture
[20:20] cast out the bondwoman and her son
[20:24] for the son of the bondwoman should not
[20:25] be heir with the son
[20:27] of the free woman the apostle paul is
[20:30] now
[20:30] quoting sarah
[20:33] sarah is the one in the scripture who
[20:35] says this sarah
[20:36] the sarah said this to abraham abraham
[20:39] was troubled but the lord came to
[20:41] abraham and said
[20:42] listen hearken to all that sarah said
[20:45] hearken to her voice
[20:47] and now the apostle paul picks this up
[20:49] and says nevertheless
[20:50] what saith the scriptures
[20:53] after she had as she had a visitation
[20:56] from the lord and she had brought forth
[20:58] the word she conceived on the word and
[20:59] brought forth the word
[21:01] now amen she had become one with the
[21:03] plan of god
[21:04] she had come to a different level of
[21:06] understanding now
[21:07] she knew the promise she knew the word
[21:10] she knew it
[21:11] intimately she had carried it she become
[21:13] one with it she brought it forth
[21:16] and now when she spoke amen the lord
[21:19] told abraham you listen to her and the
[21:22] apostle paul picks it up and says
[21:24] this is scripture
[21:27] does not scripture say
[21:30] now let's turn over to ii timothy
[21:40] 2 timothy chapter 3 this is also the
[21:42] apostle paul
[21:45] ii timothy chapter 3 verse 16
[21:51] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[21:54] god
[21:56] what did paul say that sarah said
[21:59] he said what sarah said with scripture
[22:00] now he's telling you all
[22:02] scripture is given by inspiration of god
[22:04] where did sarah get this
[22:06] it was by inspiration of god
[22:09] and god backed it up amen and all
[22:12] scripture is given by inspiration of god
[22:14] and is profitable for doctrine for
[22:15] reproof
[22:16] for correction for instruction and
[22:18] righteousness
[22:20] brother ben says in the laodicean church
[22:22] age
[22:24] out of the church age book
[22:27] he says well let me find the right spot
[22:30] here
[22:33] he says he quotes revelation 10 7
[22:36] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[22:38] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[22:40] the mystery of god should be finished
[22:42] as he has declared to his servants to
[22:44] prophets
[22:45] there it is he is sending a vindicated
[22:47] prophet he is sending a prophet after
[22:49] almost two thousand years
[22:51] he is sending someone who is so far from
[22:54] organization
[22:55] education in the world of religion that
[22:58] as john the baptist and elijah of old he
[23:00] will
[23:00] hear only from god and he will have thus
[23:03] saith the lord and speak for god
[23:06] he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it
[23:08] is declared in malachi 4
[23:10] 6 will turn
[23:14] sorry he will turn
[23:19] the hearts of the children back to the
[23:20] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[23:23] the last day and they will hear a
[23:24] vindicated prophet give the exact truth
[23:27] as it was with paul
[23:28] he will restore the truth as they had it
[23:31] and those elect with him in that day
[23:33] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[23:35] lord and be his body
[23:38] and be his voice and perform his works
[23:41] hallelujah do you see it a momentary
[23:44] consideration of church history will
[23:46] prove how accurate this thought is
[23:48] in the dark ages the word was almost
[23:50] entirely lost to the people
[23:52] but god sent luther with the word the
[23:55] lutheran spoke for god at that time
[23:57] but they organized and again the pure
[23:59] word was lost for organization
[24:01] tends towards dogma and creeds and not
[24:04] simple word
[24:05] they could no longer speak for god then
[24:08] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[24:10] with the word in his day
[24:12] the people who took his revelation from
[24:14] god became the living epistles
[24:16] read and known of all men for their
[24:18] generation
[24:19] when the methodist failed god raised up
[24:21] others and so it has gone on through the
[24:23] years
[24:23] until in the last day there's there is
[24:26] again another people in the land
[24:28] who under their messenger will be the
[24:31] final voice
[24:32] to the final age
[24:36] man sarah had a voice amen and god said
[24:39] it was right
[24:40] paul said it was scripture amen it was
[24:42] laying down an example
[24:44] because god is now speaking he's still
[24:46] speaking he come and spoke to the
[24:48] prophet the word was given to the bride
[24:50] and now god has a mouthpiece god has a
[24:52] voice and that's his living epistles
[24:54] that's his living word
[24:55] that's his living bride her very life is
[24:59] speaking the word
[25:01] her actions coming subject to the word
[25:04] and obedience to the word
[25:05] is is declaring speaking living this
[25:09] word
[25:12] he said yes sir the church is no longer
[25:14] the mouthpiece of god
[25:16] it is its own mouthpiece so god is
[25:19] turning on her he will confound her
[25:21] through the prophet
[25:22] and the bride for the voice of god will
[25:24] be in her
[25:25] yes it is for it says in the last
[25:27] chapter revelation verse 17
[25:29] the spirit and the bride say come
[25:32] once more the world will hear direct
[25:34] from god is at pentecost
[25:36] but of course that word bride will be
[25:38] repudiated as in the first age
[25:40] now he has cried out to this last age
[25:42] you have the word
[25:43] you have more bibles than ever but you
[25:45] are not doing anything about the word
[25:47] except dividing and hacking it into
[25:49] pieces
[25:49] taking what you want and leaving out
[25:51] what you don't want you are not
[25:53] interested in living it but debating it
[25:57] so what is god interested in the debate
[25:59] or the life he's interested in living
[26:01] this word this is a living word
[26:04] i would sooner you record her hot if you
[26:06] were cold and rejected
[26:07] i could stand that if you could get
[26:09] white hot to know its truth and live it
[26:11] i would praise you for that
[26:13] but when you simply take my word and
[26:14] don't honor it i in return must refuse
[26:17] to honor you
[26:18] i will spew you out for you nauseate me
[26:22] further down in the same court he says
[26:24] oh god still has a voice for the people
[26:27] of the world
[26:28] even as he has given a voice to the
[26:30] bride that voice is in the bride
[26:32] as we have said and we will talk more
[26:35] about that later
[26:36] we will get to that later part so god
[26:38] still has a voice for the people of the
[26:40] world
[26:42] in that voice in god he has given a
[26:45] voice
[26:46] to the bride the voice is in
[26:49] the bride let's turn to revelations
[26:52] chapter 10.
[26:56] these are things that we have been
[26:57] through before they are not new things
[27:00] but i want to bring them in and go over
[27:03] them again at this time
[27:07] in revelations 10 verse 7
[27:12] it says but in the days of the voice of
[27:14] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[27:16] sound the mystery of god should be
[27:17] finished
[27:18] as he had declared to his servants the
[27:20] prophets
[27:21] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[27:23] spake unto me again and said go and take
[27:25] the little book
[27:26] which is open in the hand of the angel
[27:28] which standeth upon the sea
[27:30] and upon the earth and i went into the
[27:32] angel and said unto him give me the
[27:34] little book now this is john but john is
[27:36] the type of the bride
[27:38] and now john is told to go and say to
[27:41] the angel
[27:42] amen give me the book and so he says
[27:46] he said it to the angel give me the
[27:49] little book and he said unto me
[27:50] take it and eat it up and it shall make
[27:53] thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[27:55] mouth sweet as honey
[27:57] and i took the little book out of the
[27:59] angel's hand and ate it up
[28:01] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[28:03] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[28:05] was bitter
[28:06] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[28:10] again before many peoples and nations
[28:13] and tongues and kings
[28:17] so now we know that after the
[28:19] manifestation of revelations 10
[28:21] 7 the mystery of god is finished
[28:25] that that now john typing the bride has
[28:29] to take
[28:30] the little book and get it from the
[28:31] angel amen
[28:33] from the angel who opened the book and
[28:34] had the open book in his hand he goes to
[28:36] the angel says give me the book and he
[28:38] says take it take the book and eat it up
[28:40] amen so the bride has got to take this
[28:43] open
[28:44] book and she has got to feed on it and
[28:46] eat it up eat it up means eat all of it
[28:50] and when she eats all of it it'll be in
[28:52] her mouth sweet as honey
[28:53] but in her belly it's bitter because
[28:55] when she's taking it in she's enjoying
[28:57] it but when she has to
[28:59] when she has to digest it and become one
[29:01] with it and begin to live it
[29:02] now it makes her belly bitter because
[29:04] it's hard to live in a world that
[29:06] rejects the word
[29:09] but he says take it eat it it'll be
[29:12] sweet in thy mouth and
[29:13] bitter in the belly for thou must
[29:15] prophesy
[29:16] again amen so there has to come forth
[29:19] that she has to prophesy again there's a
[29:22] there's the continuation of the giving
[29:24] forth of the word
[29:25] but this word prophesy again it's not
[29:28] more prophecy
[29:32] because you can know you can't add to or
[29:34] take away
[29:35] the message has already been given
[29:37] through the prophet the bride is not
[29:38] here to find more
[29:40] amen to add to her to take away she's
[29:42] prophesying again
[29:44] what has already been spoken amen what
[29:46] has already been given
[29:47] she'll be saying what he says
[29:51] we'll get to that quote in a little bit
[29:52] amen
[29:54] but i'd like to just make a comment on
[29:56] saying what he says when you know when
[29:58] brother branham went beyond the curtain
[29:59] of time
[30:00] and went beyond the curtain of time he
[30:02] was asking could i see jesus and no
[30:04] he'll come to you
[30:05] and you'll be judged for what you
[30:06] preached and we'll be judged with you
[30:08] you remember this and brother man said
[30:12] well what about paul
[30:13] and his group he said he'll be judged
[30:14] with this he said well i preached what
[30:16] paul preached
[30:17] and everybody there said we're resting
[30:19] on that
[30:21] so brother branham preached what paul
[30:23] preached he said what paul said
[30:25] is that true but brother branham did not
[30:28] get into the pulpit every week and say i
[30:31] want to start in the book of romans
[30:32] romans chapter 1 and he read the first
[30:35] chapter of romans closed his book
[30:37] and left and said i'm only going to say
[30:38] what paul says
[30:43] then next sunday he comes back and he
[30:45] reads chapter 2
[30:47] and he closes the book and leaves the
[30:50] next sunday he comes back and reads
[30:51] chapter three
[30:52] and all he does is stand in the pulpit
[30:54] and read exactly
[30:56] what paul said when he said what paul
[30:58] said
[30:59] he preached what paul preached he had
[31:01] the same truth amen
[31:04] and he could go back through the bible
[31:06] the old testament that paul went through
[31:08] and he could find examples
[31:09] he could find amen he could find that
[31:11] word laying all the way through there he
[31:13] could bring it out and preach it
[31:14] and he could even use scriptures paul
[31:16] didn't use
[31:20] so to say what paul says doesn't mean
[31:22] that he can only just
[31:24] repeat what paul wrote he's saying the
[31:26] same thing
[31:27] amen it's what paul had brought it's the
[31:29] truth that was revealed to him
[31:31] amen and brother branham picked it up
[31:33] and now he was carrying that same thing
[31:35] and he and he and he was finding it all
[31:38] through the scriptures
[31:40] so now when the bride says what the
[31:42] prophet says amen that's why we don't
[31:44] just get up
[31:45] and just start reading out of crisis the
[31:47] mystery of god revealed we'll read the
[31:48] first 10 pages today
[31:50] close it and the preacher leaves and we
[31:51] come back next sunday and we pick up the
[31:53] next 10 pages
[31:56] saying well you know we only say what he
[31:57] says no you say what he says amen but do
[32:00] you say what he says in the spirit of
[32:02] what he says
[32:03] you say the same thing he's saying
[32:07] but you can find it through the whole
[32:08] bible
[32:10] that's why brother branham said i'm just
[32:12] hitting the high places amen
[32:14] just enough so that you'll get it so you
[32:16] can go home and study it out
[32:20] so sometimes you get a wrong concept
[32:23] of what it means just to say what he
[32:26] says
[32:28] but you cannot add to
[32:31] or take away from the revelation that's
[32:33] been given to us
[32:35] the prophet brought it god brought it
[32:36] through the prophet we're not here to
[32:39] come up with our
[32:40] own message we've been given the message
[32:45] we must prophesy again amen that say
[32:48] what he said let's go to luke chapter 1.
[33:01] luke chapter 1
[33:05] and verse 38.
[33:12] in luke chapter one mary is going to
[33:15] have a visitation
[33:17] from an angel now
[33:21] there was there was a prophecy
[33:25] given over adam and that was the
[33:27] multiply and replenish and
[33:29] he was given a wife so that he could
[33:31] reproduce himself he was given a bride
[33:34] but that wife she come to her own
[33:36] understanding and her own
[33:38] intellect and by her own human effort to
[33:40] bring forth the word
[33:42] she brought corruption abraham was given
[33:46] a prophecy and under that prophecy
[33:48] abraham had a wife amen and that wife
[33:50] amen through her own understanding
[33:52] and her own intellect and her own human
[33:53] effort tried to bring forth that
[33:54] prophecy
[33:55] and what did she bring corruption
[33:59] every time human beings tries to bring
[34:02] forth the word through human effort they
[34:04] bring
[34:04] corruption but now it's time
[34:08] for god to bring forth the promise of
[34:10] the of the
[34:12] the the seed of the woman and now he's
[34:14] got to come to mary
[34:16] there's nothing mary can do to produce
[34:18] this word
[34:20] there's nothing in her human effort
[34:22] there's nothing in her intellect there's
[34:24] nothing in her wisdom that
[34:25] she can do to make this prophecy laying
[34:28] in isaiah come to pass
[34:31] even though she's the chosen one she's
[34:33] the predestinated vessel
[34:34] she can't make it happen amen god's got
[34:37] a designated time and he's got a
[34:39] designated season
[34:40] and the visitation and the angel will
[34:42] come to her and say now's the season
[34:44] now's the time
[34:45] and in her understanding she doesn't
[34:47] even necessarily understand
[34:49] how that it's physically going to happen
[34:51] and she even questions that but when he
[34:53] gives her an answer it's going to be the
[34:54] holy ghost and she says be it unto me
[34:56] according to your word and now when god
[34:59] comes to confirm the promise
[35:01] now it's perfect
[35:04] now when a human being tries to bring
[35:06] the promise to pass
[35:07] it goes into corruption amen it brings a
[35:10] perversion it brings a corruption
[35:12] but when god does it himself amen it
[35:15] brings forth the word
[35:16] it brings restoration it brings life
[35:22] that's why human effort will never
[35:24] produce the word of god
[35:27] god will produce his own word he's
[35:29] looking for somebody just to surrender
[35:32] and in verse 38 says and mary said
[35:34] behold the handmaid of the lord be it
[35:36] unto me according to thy word
[35:38] and the angel departed from her
[35:41] and mary arose in those days and went
[35:43] into the hill country with haste into
[35:45] the city of judah
[35:46] and entered into the house of zacharias
[35:48] and saluted elizabeth
[35:50] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[35:52] heard the salutation of mary
[35:54] the babe leapt in her womb what babe
[35:58] this is now john the baptist what is
[36:00] john the baptist
[36:01] john the baptist is the word
[36:05] and now the word is in elizabeth
[36:09] right the word of god the prophecy amen
[36:12] that was laying in the word of god
[36:13] now the word is in elizabeth elizabeth
[36:16] now is carrying the word
[36:18] her and the word are one unit together
[36:20] and when she hears the salutation of
[36:22] mary
[36:23] amen that word inside of her left
[36:28] and listen and and elizabeth was
[36:31] filled with the holy ghost and she spake
[36:34] out with a loud voice
[36:36] now elizabeth has a voice
[36:40] and said blessed art thou are among
[36:41] women and blessed is the fruit of thy
[36:43] womb
[36:44] and when says this to me that the mother
[36:46] of my lord should come to me
[36:48] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[36:50] salutation sounded in my ears
[36:52] the babe leapt in my womb for joy and
[36:55] blessed is she
[36:56] that believeth for there shall be this
[36:58] is prophecy friends
[37:01] blessed is she that believeth for there
[37:03] shall be a performance of those things
[37:06] which were told her from the lord
[37:09] now because now because elizabeth was
[37:12] carrying the word amen
[37:14] and the word was inside of her she had
[37:17] conceived amen and she was now carrying
[37:19] the prophecy the word
[37:20] when she come in contact with mary and
[37:22] mary gave her a salutation
[37:24] that babe left with joy she was filled
[37:25] with the holy ghost and now elizabeth
[37:28] began to speak with a loud voice
[37:30] and what elizabeth was speaking was
[37:31] speaking down blessings upon mary
[37:33] and now saying that what was promised
[37:36] shall be performed
[37:39] praise be to god why because the word
[37:41] was inside of her
[37:44] this is the start of the new testament
[37:48] and now these women are conceiving the
[37:51] promise
[37:52] and now they're speaking in verse 46
[37:56] and mary said my soul doth magnify the
[38:00] lord
[38:01] and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my
[38:03] savior for he hath regarded the lowest
[38:05] state of his handmaiden
[38:07] for behold from henceforth all
[38:09] generations shall call me blessed
[38:11] for he that is mighty have done to me
[38:13] great things and holy is his name
[38:15] and his mercy is on them that fear him
[38:17] from generation to generation
[38:19] he has showed strength with his arm he
[38:21] has scattered the proud in the
[38:23] imagination of their hearts
[38:24] he has put down the mighty from their
[38:26] seats and exalted them of low degree
[38:28] he has filled the hungry with good
[38:30] things and the rich he has sent
[38:32] him the rich he has sent empty away he
[38:34] hath hope in his
[38:35] servant israel in remembrance of his
[38:37] mercy as he spake to our fathers to
[38:40] abraham
[38:41] and to his seed forever and now
[38:44] what is mary mary also has the word
[38:48] inside of her
[38:50] elizabeth has the word in her and mary
[38:52] has the word in her
[38:53] amen and now these two women are
[38:55] speaking
[38:57] and what they're speaking is magnifying
[38:59] and glorifying
[39:00] the word for their day they have caught
[39:02] the revelation of the word for their day
[39:04] and what are they speaking they are
[39:06] speaking the manifestation of the word
[39:08] for their day
[39:10] and these two women who have the word on
[39:12] them they know the day they know the
[39:14] hour
[39:14] they know the prophecy and they know
[39:16] what's going on and under the
[39:18] inspiration of the holy ghost they're
[39:19] declaring it now
[39:22] praise god amen there was there was
[39:25] priests and there was rabbis and there
[39:27] was
[39:27] all kinds of religious leaders and
[39:29] scribes all the way around
[39:30] but you've got two humble little women
[39:32] and these two women have the word inside
[39:35] of them
[39:35] and then when they come in contact with
[39:37] one another now they have a voice and
[39:39] what they're speaking is declaring the
[39:41] mystery that is being revealed
[39:43] what they're speaking is declaring
[39:45] what's hidden on the inside of them
[39:46] is the fulfillment of the word for this
[39:48] day
[39:50] and they begin to speak and elizabeth
[39:51] loud voice and mary begins to proclaim
[39:54] all that's taking place in that day
[39:58] praise be to god
[40:01] and this is the beginning of the new
[40:03] testament
[40:05] it's how it starts
[40:08] in the message the spoken word is the
[40:11] original seed
[40:12] so the angel showed abraham who he was
[40:16] that he was the word he said why did
[40:17] sarah laugh so he called her forth and
[40:20] she said i never he said but you did
[40:23] what the grace see right there god would
[40:25] have slew her
[40:26] right there but he couldn't see our
[40:30] stupidity he'd kill every one of us
[40:32] but he can't to kill sarah he had to
[40:34] take abraham
[40:35] because sarah was part of abraham they
[40:38] were one
[40:38] in union this is so important to
[40:41] understand
[40:42] because if the prophecy was for abraham
[40:45] it had to be for sarah too because they
[40:47] were one
[40:49] and to take the church and destroy it he
[40:52] can't do it
[40:53] because it's part of himself christ part
[40:55] of himself the word
[40:57] being made flesh amazing grace how sweet
[41:01] the sound couldn't do it you get it
[41:03] he couldn't kill her he couldn't take
[41:05] her life because she was part of abraham
[41:07] she was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[41:09] his bone in our mistakes
[41:11] don't say well i made a failure no that
[41:13] don't make abraham made failures too
[41:15] see but he couldn't take the church he
[41:18] can't kill the elect
[41:19] he can't take your life because you're
[41:21] part of himself
[41:23] you're the word the word is in you
[41:29] we know revelations 22 17 well i'll just
[41:32] quote him
[41:33] he said in the spirit and the bride say
[41:36] come
[41:36] all the way at the end of the revelation
[41:39] at the end of the bible
[41:40] the spirit and the bride so at the end
[41:43] of the
[41:43] end of the end the bride has a voice
[41:47] and the voice of the bride is speaking
[41:50] in conjunction with the spirit or the
[41:52] spirit through the bride
[41:53] is saying come the spirit and the bride
[41:56] say come
[41:56] what are they saying they're saying come
[41:59] come to what
[42:00] come to the fountain of life amen and
[42:02] what are they saying when you say come
[42:04] there's something you have to leave in
[42:05] order to come you've got to leave and
[42:07] they're crying
[42:08] come out from among them and be ye
[42:10] separate
[42:12] come so in the end time at the end of
[42:15] the revelation
[42:16] of jesus christ the bride has a voice
[42:20] and that voice is saying come
[42:24] come to the fountain of life
[42:29] back in the latest in church age from
[42:31] the church age book
[42:32] it says but thank god at this moment
[42:34] this age is not over
[42:36] he is yet crying and his cry is not only
[42:38] in the spiritual ears of men
[42:40] by his spirit but once again a prophet
[42:42] is in the land once more god will reveal
[42:45] the truth as he did to paul
[42:47] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[42:48] the days of the laodicean age
[42:50] its messenger will reveal the mysteries
[42:52] of god as revealed to paul
[42:54] he will speak out and those who receive
[42:56] the prophet in his own
[42:58] name will receive the beneficent
[43:00] beneficient effect of that prophet's
[43:02] ministry
[43:03] and they that hear him will be blessed
[43:05] and become part of that bride of the
[43:06] last day
[43:07] who are mentioned in revelation 22 17
[43:10] the spirit and the bride say come the
[43:13] corner of wheat the bride wheat that
[43:15] fell into the ground at nicaea
[43:16] has come back to original word grain
[43:19] again
[43:19] praise god forever yes listen to the
[43:23] authenticated prophet of god who appears
[43:25] in this last
[43:25] age what he says from god the bride will
[43:29] say
[43:31] because she has to prophesy again
[43:34] prophesy again what are you going to
[43:36] prophesy what's already been prophesied
[43:42] what he says from god the bride will say
[43:44] the spirit and the prophet
[43:46] and the bride will be saying the same
[43:49] thing
[43:52] listen you can take quotes and you can
[43:56] stand before a group of people
[43:58] and just line the quotes up and just
[44:00] speak just quotes
[44:01] amen you can line it in a way that the
[44:04] people get the wrong
[44:05] understanding of what the prophet's
[44:06] saying
[44:08] and all you're doing is saying what he
[44:10] said
[44:13] but you're not saying what he said
[44:17] do you understand so to say what he said
[44:20] amen is to say what god was speaking in
[44:24] this age the revelation of this
[44:26] hour the full revelation of the word
[44:31] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[44:32] will be saying the same thing
[44:34] and what they will say will have already
[44:37] been said in the word
[44:39] praise god they are saying it now come
[44:41] out from among her now and be
[44:43] separate the cry has gone out the cry is
[44:46] going out
[44:46] how long will the voice cry we do not
[44:49] know but one thing we do know
[44:50] it won't be long for this is the last
[44:52] age
[44:56] in the message the token he says it has
[44:58] to be because a woman and her husband
[45:00] become
[45:01] one they become one and so does the
[45:04] bride and christ become one
[45:06] the ministry of the bride and the
[45:08] ministry of christ
[45:09] is the same i'd like to say
[45:13] the ministry of abraham and the ministry
[45:15] of sarah
[45:16] was the same because the prophecy to
[45:19] abraham was
[45:20] he was going to bring forth from abraham
[45:22] a seed amen
[45:23] and he was going to have a seed and
[45:25] abraham that was a prophecy to abraham
[45:28] but sarah was included because sarah was
[45:30] his wife
[45:32] so sarah and abraham have the same
[45:34] ministry
[45:37] the problem arose when when when sarah
[45:40] tried to use her own
[45:41] intellect and her own understanding to
[45:43] fulfill the ministry
[45:45] it failed amen but if she would have
[45:47] just waited for god
[45:48] to confirm his word she was already
[45:50] included in it it was going to happen
[45:52] she just needed to wait
[45:56] and the ministry of the bride and the
[45:58] minister of christ
[46:00] is the same why are they the same
[46:02] because why is the ministry the same
[46:04] because they are the same they are the
[46:07] word amen
[46:09] he's the word she's the word she's come
[46:11] from the word
[46:12] she's being united back to the word amen
[46:14] there's a prophecy to be fulfilled
[46:18] but she's included
[46:21] she doesn't have to get nervous about
[46:23] that
[46:25] she's part of it in the pergameon church
[46:29] age
[46:30] the section we've read many times on
[46:33] pick up your pen and write
[46:34] when the angel told brother brandon to
[46:36] pick up his pen and write
[46:38] and he has it here italicized
[46:41] in the church age book i'm just going to
[46:42] read a small section it said notice the
[46:44] harmony of the father and the son
[46:46] jesus never did anything until it was
[46:48] first showed him by the father john 5
[46:50] 19.
[46:51] this harmony is now to exist between the
[46:53] groom and his bride
[46:55] he shows her his word of life how did he
[46:58] show her
[46:58] his word of life amen he sent a prophet
[47:00] and then he had to give her a revelation
[47:02] of what that prophet was speaking
[47:06] he shows her his word of life she
[47:07] receives it she never doubts it
[47:10] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[47:12] death for if the seed be planted the
[47:14] water will raise it up again
[47:16] here is the secret of this the word is
[47:19] in
[47:19] the bride there's the secret of it the
[47:22] word is in the bride
[47:24] as it was in mary the bride has the mind
[47:27] of christ
[47:28] for she knows what he wants done with
[47:30] the word she performs the commandment of
[47:32] the word in his name
[47:33] for she has thus saith the lord then the
[47:36] word is quickened by the spirit and it
[47:37] comes to pass
[47:38] like a seed that is planted and watered
[47:40] it comes to full harvest serving its
[47:42] purpose
[47:44] those in the bride do only his will no
[47:46] one can make them do otherwise
[47:48] they have thus saith the lord or they
[47:50] keep still they know
[47:52] that it has to be god in them doing the
[47:53] works fulfilling his own word
[47:57] he did not complete all his work while
[47:59] in his earthly ministry
[48:01] so now he works in and through the bride
[48:04] so as the ministry of christ and mr
[48:06] bride the same ministry
[48:08] absolutely it's christ's ministry
[48:09] through the bride
[48:11] now he works in and through the bride
[48:14] she knows that for it was not yet time
[48:16] for him to do certain things that he
[48:17] must now
[48:18] do but he will now fulfill through the
[48:20] bride
[48:21] that work which he left for this
[48:23] specific
[48:24] time there was a specific time
[48:29] that god was going to bring forth the
[48:30] promised word to abraham
[48:33] and then that specific time he was going
[48:35] to come
[48:36] and he was going to renew them back to
[48:38] youth and he was going to give
[48:39] sarah a man strength to conceive seed to
[48:42] bring forth the promise
[48:43] and it was coming at a specific time and
[48:45] it was something he was going to come
[48:47] and do himself
[48:52] and so when he does it it's perfect
[48:56] and questions and answers on the seals
[48:58] there's a question question number 22
[49:01] say would the bride of christ would the
[49:03] bride of christ have a ministry before
[49:05] the rapture
[49:08] here's brother branham's answer sure
[49:10] that's what's going on right now
[49:12] the bride of christ certainly it is the
[49:15] message of the hour
[49:19] so what's the ministry the message of
[49:21] the hour
[49:23] see the bride of christ sure she
[49:24] consists of apostles prophets teachers
[49:26] evangelists and pastors
[49:28] is that right that's the bride of christ
[49:30] sure she's got a ministry great ministry
[49:32] it's the ministry of the hour so what is
[49:35] the
[49:36] great ministry of the bride it's the
[49:37] message of the hour
[49:40] in birth pains i got several quotes i
[49:42] want to read so just hang with me
[49:44] and birth pangs brother bram said now
[49:45] the word must produce the bride
[49:49] so this is key if the word is in the
[49:51] bride and now
[49:53] there's a ministry in the bride that
[49:54] consists of apostles prophets teachers
[49:56] evangelists
[49:57] the fivefold ministry it's the message
[49:59] of the hour the word
[50:01] must produce the bride so that ministry
[50:04] in this hour
[50:04] must produce a bride the ministry in
[50:07] this hour is not to produce a church
[50:10] it's not to produce another group
[50:11] another movement another
[50:13] segment another section another sect
[50:15] another denomination another
[50:17] another form of thinking amen the word
[50:19] in this hour the ministry of the hour
[50:21] amen the ministry of christ and the
[50:23] ministry of the bride is the same and
[50:24] the ministry of this hour
[50:26] will bring the word will produce a bride
[50:30] and so if it's producing something other
[50:32] than a bride it's not the right ministry
[50:36] because the word must produce the bride
[50:40] that's all that we're after that's the
[50:42] whole point amen that's why we preach
[50:44] and why we have services and why we pass
[50:46] out books and why
[50:47] we do all that we do is because there's
[50:49] got to be a bride amen a bride in the
[50:51] end time and every elect seed has got to
[50:53] come into this bride
[50:55] and be manifest amen that's what we're
[50:57] here for not to build a church not to
[50:59] build a movement not to get a new
[51:01] not to get a new popularity club going
[51:03] in a new circle of
[51:04] whatever the word must produce a bride
[51:09] that's the ministry at the end time
[51:15] it's good that we stay focused on what
[51:17] we're here for
[51:21] if there's a voice at the end of the
[51:24] revelation of jesus christ
[51:26] that voice was saying come
[51:29] that voice wasn't starting a new church
[51:32] a new movement
[51:33] a new denomination new creeds
[51:38] that voice was calling to the elect come
[51:42] and the word must produce the bride
[51:46] and the rapture says she has to be
[51:49] molded and made into the image of christ
[51:51] and christ is the word that's the only
[51:53] thing see it's in there
[51:55] in the word there cannot be one thing
[51:57] added
[51:59] cannot be a woman with one hand like a
[52:00] man in the other hand like a paw like a
[52:02] dog it's got to be exactly the word of
[52:04] the lord like he is the word
[52:06] the bride is part of the bridegroom the
[52:08] woman is part of her husband
[52:09] because she's taken out of the husband
[52:11] eve was a part of adam from his side and
[52:14] so is the bride
[52:15] not taken from a denomination but taken
[52:18] from the bosom
[52:19] of the word of god for this day
[52:23] you catch that what is the bride taken
[52:26] from
[52:27] she's taken from the bosom of the word
[52:29] of god
[52:30] for this day she's taken from the word
[52:32] of god for this day
[52:34] not an old word not a stagnant word but
[52:36] the fresh revelation of the word
[52:40] and choosing of a bride he says and that
[52:43] is the mark of the beast when she forms
[52:45] that world
[52:46] council of churches and she'll give
[52:48] birth to her son the antichrist
[52:51] the other is pregnanted by the word of
[52:52] god and will bring forth the body
[52:54] the finished body of jesus christ which
[52:57] is the bride
[52:59] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[53:00] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[53:02] one
[53:02] and christ is one body the word the
[53:05] bride will have to be the rest of that
[53:06] body and the two together makes the one
[53:08] body again
[53:09] like adam was at the beginning man his
[53:12] wife are one
[53:14] now she the true bride so sold out to
[53:16] him that she uses no mind of her own
[53:18] his mind of course is his will and his
[53:21] will is his word
[53:23] so now she's been impregnated once
[53:26] pregnant is going to bring forth the
[53:28] antichrist but the other is impregnated
[53:30] by the word and will bring forth the
[53:32] body
[53:33] the finished body of jesus christ which
[53:36] is
[53:36] the bride because the ministry of the
[53:38] word in this day will produce a bride
[53:43] in the message the seed does not air
[53:44] with the shock he says
[53:46] cannot do it now it's seed time or
[53:49] bride time the shucks are dead the
[53:53] shucks are dried up
[53:54] the virgin word time not touched
[53:57] it's a virgin remember a virgin word
[53:59] time if you put it in the hands of a
[54:01] denomination
[54:02] it sure won't be virgin it'll be
[54:04] manhandled
[54:06] time you get it to it but god's church
[54:08] is not touched by the nomination
[54:10] hallelujah
[54:11] it's a virgin-born word of god made
[54:13] manifest
[54:15] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[54:18] and forever hallelujah
[54:19] how wonderful i love it i believe it i
[54:21] know that it's the truth
[54:22] it'll not be touched there'll be no
[54:25] denominational man handling in the
[54:27] virgin birth of the bride
[54:30] that's why when this bride that's on
[54:32] earth today
[54:33] amen she's got a voice and that voice is
[54:35] saying come come out from among her
[54:37] come out and be separate come into the
[54:40] fountain of life that's flowing clean
[54:41] from the from the throne of god
[54:43] come and drink come and taste come be
[54:46] united with this word
[54:48] it's got to be pure word amen the
[54:50] brightest calling to a pure word
[54:52] a fountain amen a crystal clear water
[54:55] that's not polluted with man
[54:56] she can't mix her own ideas in it she
[54:59] can't add anything to it amen
[55:01] she can't take anything from it but
[55:02] she's here just to say what he said
[55:04] but he's got a voice in the earth and
[55:06] that voice is his bride and if she's
[55:08] preaching the word the word will produce
[55:10] the virgin-born bride
[55:17] no denomination no man handling
[55:21] in the virgin birth of the bride no sure
[55:24] she's commanded by god to come out of
[55:26] such
[55:28] that's why sarah after she went through
[55:31] all the experiences she went through
[55:33] she went through her denominational
[55:35] ideas she went through her own reasoning
[55:37] and intellect
[55:38] she went through trying by her own
[55:40] effort to produce the promise
[55:42] and then it failed and then then god
[55:45] come
[55:45] and he showed the sign of the messiah
[55:47] and she saw something real and the
[55:48] discernment was done to her
[55:50] and all of a sudden she was turned back
[55:51] to what she was when she was first
[55:53] married to abraham
[55:55] and then somewhere along the line amen
[55:58] the lord
[55:58] visited her and when he visited her she
[56:02] conceived on the promised word
[56:03] and now the word was in her
[56:07] and now she carried this word and she
[56:09] brought forth this word
[56:10] and as this word was coming into
[56:12] maturity she saw the very thing that was
[56:14] her reasoning her very mistake
[56:16] her very error was mocking this word
[56:22] and that's why she said cast out the
[56:24] bondwoman
[56:26] nothing's going to mix with this seed
[56:30] one time we thought it was a good idea
[56:32] it's not a good idea
[56:34] we may have carried a lot of
[56:35] denominational ideas into the message
[56:38] with us
[56:38] but i want to say right now cast out the
[56:40] bondwoman
[56:41] and her son for not be heir with this
[56:44] word
[56:45] we've been given a pure word to come
[56:48] from god and god has brought a
[56:49] visitation to the church that will bring
[56:51] a conception
[56:52] and bring forth the word amen and that
[56:56] word will bring a virgin birth to the
[56:58] bride of jesus christ
[57:02] but it can't be denominational
[57:04] manhandled
[57:06] we can't carry any more ideas
[57:09] everything got to be burnt
[57:13] brother branham was telling us that from
[57:15] one age to the next when the
[57:17] when the lamb was left over and the
[57:19] manna was left over and then they
[57:20] weren't to carry it they weren't to
[57:22] carry it from one age to the next
[57:24] whatever they couldn't eat then had to
[57:26] be burnt
[57:28] totally done away with and then when we
[57:30] when we come in from
[57:31] whatever understanding we had before and
[57:33] whatever idea we had before
[57:35] whatever was in our mind and whatever we
[57:37] thought was right and whatever we've
[57:39] been taught if it's contrary to the word
[57:41] it's got to be burnt
[57:44] it's got to be annihilated because this
[57:47] bride will not be manhandled by the
[57:49] nomination
[57:53] and trying to do god a service without
[57:55] being the will of god
[57:57] says and if the bride is to be the word
[57:59] then she's got to be of christ
[58:01] part of the bridegroom she's got to be
[58:04] the word
[58:05] the word not for his day the word for
[58:08] this day
[58:10] that he promised would be this day that
[58:13] he sent his word
[58:14] forth to mold his bride and make her
[58:17] hope you see it don't get some idea of
[58:19] your own
[58:19] and don't take somebody else's idea take
[58:22] the vindicated word here the bible
[58:26] and the identified masterpiece of god he
[58:28] says he is cutting you out now
[58:30] cutting you down to his word only
[58:34] cutting all the creeds and dogmas and
[58:36] everything away from you
[58:38] trying to get back to a bride for the
[58:40] sun
[58:41] another masterpiece part of the word the
[58:44] word
[58:45] what's god trying to do to us amen week
[58:48] after week as he opens the word
[58:50] he's trying to cut everything down to
[58:52] just the word
[58:53] to all that's left in our thinking and
[58:55] all that our desire there's nothing
[58:57] mixed in anymore
[58:58] he's trying to cut us down to just the
[59:02] word
[59:04] in the message christ is the mystery of
[59:06] god revealed he says
[59:08] how how did he what happened in the
[59:10] pre-figure now
[59:11] he opened adam's side and took part of
[59:13] his flesh which was adam
[59:14] to make eve the bride has to be the word
[59:17] for he is the word
[59:19] she cannot stand on creeds she cannot
[59:21] stand on denominationalism
[59:23] she cannot stand on good behavior she
[59:25] has to stand alone on the word
[59:27] because she is part of it she was taken
[59:30] from christ
[59:32] and the message that is the rising of
[59:33] the sun he says as he
[59:35] being the groom the bride has to come
[59:37] forth
[59:38] because it's part of him and it can only
[59:40] be the manifestation and the fulfilling
[59:43] of all the revelations
[59:44] any others has spoke of the bride it can
[59:47] only manifest if it does something
[59:48] different from the groom and
[59:49] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[59:52] his flesh
[59:53] bone of his bone life of his life power
[59:56] of his power
[59:57] she is him
[1:00:00] that's why there can't be anything else
[1:00:02] mixed in
[1:00:04] and the message the invisible union of
[1:00:06] the bride of christ
[1:00:08] says but to the elected god is calling
[1:00:11] to the elected
[1:00:12] they know it calling the virtuous bride
[1:00:15] the word the last day
[1:00:16] church the elected lady of our lord
[1:00:18] jesus christ
[1:00:20] jesus is the word how many believe that
[1:00:22] all right
[1:00:23] then the bride is always part of the
[1:00:25] bridegroom so the bride will not be a
[1:00:27] denomination
[1:00:29] it'll have to be the word manifested to
[1:00:32] be the bride of christ
[1:00:35] that means in order to attract the bride
[1:00:38] of christ or bring somebody
[1:00:40] to a birth there cannot be anything
[1:00:42] mixed into the word
[1:00:43] it's got to be the word amen because the
[1:00:46] word will bring forth the bride
[1:00:49] god he worked and he worked and he
[1:00:51] worked until
[1:00:52] he got sarah to the place where she now
[1:00:55] realized she now understood
[1:00:57] she now got it it now she understand why
[1:01:01] and when she understood why she can make
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:04] that decree that said cast out the
[1:01:07] bondwoman
[1:01:09] and i hope we've come to the place where
[1:01:11] we recognize why it won't work amen
[1:01:13] why nothing but this word will work none
[1:01:15] of my own ideas are manipulating or
[1:01:17] twisting it
[1:01:18] or making excuses for it nothing will
[1:01:20] work this word is the only thing that's
[1:01:22] going to work
[1:01:24] it's the only thing that'll bring life
[1:01:25] it's the only thing that's the pure
[1:01:26] water that's flowing down from the
[1:01:28] throne of god
[1:01:29] it's the only thing to call people to
[1:01:31] it's the only thing to separate from and
[1:01:33] to come to
[1:01:33] amen don't come from one dirty pool to
[1:01:36] another dirty pool
[1:01:38] don't try to attract the bride of christ
[1:01:40] amen from one dirty mud hole
[1:01:42] to another a mud hole that's a little
[1:01:43] bit cleaner than that mud hole
[1:01:46] and this one's just a little bit cleaner
[1:01:47] and this one's just a little bit cleaner
[1:01:49] but god has brought us a word amen he's
[1:01:51] brought us a pure word
[1:01:53] he's he's bypassed all the denominations
[1:01:55] he's come
[1:01:56] down with a prophet with a mighty sign
[1:01:58] to show us that there's a restoration of
[1:02:00] a pure
[1:02:00] clean word and the bride is going to
[1:02:03] stand on that word and that word alone
[1:02:07] and that's the only thing she's to
[1:02:09] propagate is that word
[1:02:13] she's not to propagate herself
[1:02:17] her church her ministry her people her
[1:02:21] ideas
[1:02:23] but just that word and if we can just
[1:02:26] speak that word
[1:02:27] and live that word and manifest that
[1:02:29] word the word will produce
[1:02:31] a bride that's what we're here for
[1:02:40] let's go to genesis chapter 3.
[1:02:48] genesis chapter 3 and verse 14
[1:02:58] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[1:03:00] because thou has done this
[1:03:02] thou art cursed above all cattle and
[1:03:05] above every beast of the field
[1:03:07] upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[1:03:09] out to eat all the days of thy life
[1:03:12] and i will put enmity between thee and
[1:03:13] the woman in between thy seed and her
[1:03:15] seed
[1:03:16] it shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[1:03:19] bruise his heel
[1:03:22] god had laid down a prophecy and in that
[1:03:24] prophecy there was going to come a seed
[1:03:26] from a woman
[1:03:27] the seed of the woman and that seed of
[1:03:29] the woman was going to bruise the
[1:03:31] serpent's head
[1:03:33] and no matter how many people wanted to
[1:03:36] produce that
[1:03:37] until it was god's time then nobody
[1:03:39] could produce that
[1:03:41] no matter how much they wanted the
[1:03:44] serpent's head to be bruised
[1:03:48] they couldn't produce it they couldn't
[1:03:49] manufacture it you can't
[1:03:51] you can't through intellect and
[1:03:53] reasoning and effort you can't
[1:03:55] you can't produce this promise but in
[1:03:57] due time
[1:03:58] god would send an angel to a little
[1:03:59] virgin by the name of mary
[1:04:01] and he would begin to tell mary now is
[1:04:03] the time now's the season
[1:04:04] you're the one and she would say be it
[1:04:07] unto me
[1:04:08] and when god did it it was perfect and
[1:04:10] it was in perfect time
[1:04:12] and all that he needed was somebody who
[1:04:14] would accept it the way he gave it
[1:04:17] and when she would accept it the way he
[1:04:18] gave it all of a sudden what she had
[1:04:20] faith to believe
[1:04:22] amen as elizabeth said blessed are you
[1:04:25] for it shall be performed in you
[1:04:28] because you believed and god
[1:04:31] raised up the seed from the woman and
[1:04:33] that seed from the woman bruised the
[1:04:35] serpent's head
[1:04:36] and that seed was christ
[1:04:39] let's go to romans 16.
[1:04:48] romans chapter 16 and verse 20.
[1:04:57] and the god of peace shall bruce satan
[1:04:59] under your feet shortly
[1:05:02] the grace of our lord jesus christ be
[1:05:04] with you
[1:05:06] amen now the god of peace
[1:05:09] shall brew satan under your feet
[1:05:12] shortly the devil's going to be bruised
[1:05:17] under feet and the apostle paul says
[1:05:20] it's going to be under your feet
[1:05:23] who's the apostle paul talking to he's
[1:05:24] talking to the church
[1:05:26] he's talking to the bride but who's
[1:05:29] going to do the bruising
[1:05:31] it's going to be god god's going to do
[1:05:34] the bruising
[1:05:35] and he's going to use your feet
[1:05:39] he's going to use the bride in this end
[1:05:41] time amen because
[1:05:43] in the beginning the devil he he took
[1:05:45] the bride that was given to the serpent
[1:05:47] or given to
[1:05:48] adam and the serpent through subduction
[1:05:51] amen perverted that tool that god was
[1:05:53] going to use and brought corruption
[1:05:55] and always down through time it's been
[1:05:56] that way but god
[1:05:58] is going to take the very same thing
[1:06:00] that the devil used for corruption and
[1:06:02] god is going to bring it right back
[1:06:04] and going to bruise him crush him
[1:06:05] destroy him by the very tool that he's
[1:06:08] tried to use to stop the word of god
[1:06:10] and god himself is going to do it amen
[1:06:13] it's not going to be you and i
[1:06:15] we don't have the power we don't have
[1:06:16] the strength all we've got is the
[1:06:18] yielding amen
[1:06:19] all we've got is the ability to say here
[1:06:22] i am be it unto me
[1:06:23] god i'm available but it's he
[1:06:27] god the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:06:29] under your feet
[1:06:31] shortly amen
[1:06:36] it's up to us to stick with the word
[1:06:39] to say what the word says and let god do
[1:06:42] what god's going to do
[1:06:44] because this is the age and this is the
[1:06:47] bride
[1:06:48] that he's going to use to do it
[1:06:51] he said in things that are to be now if
[1:06:54] we are those
[1:06:55] attributes of god we cannot live by
[1:06:58] creeds
[1:07:00] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:07:02] must live by the word because the bride
[1:07:04] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[1:07:06] is part of her husband
[1:07:08] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:07:10] what is the word bride
[1:07:12] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[1:07:17] not a creed or denomination but a
[1:07:20] living oracle of god a living attribute
[1:07:23] of god
[1:07:24] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:07:26] of god in the formation
[1:07:28] of the bride that's to be expressed in
[1:07:30] this hour that we're now
[1:07:31] living friends it is bride time
[1:07:35] what is the manifestation it's the
[1:07:37] manifestation of the virgin bride
[1:07:39] it's the manifestation of the word
[1:07:40] that's been restored back to bring a
[1:07:42] bride back to what she ought to have
[1:07:44] been in the beginning
[1:07:45] to unite with christ and now to bring
[1:07:47] forth the very life
[1:07:48] of the word it's bride time
[1:07:52] that's the manifestation for this hour
[1:07:55] he has called us amen
[1:07:56] he has sent a prophet messenger to us he
[1:07:58] sent the angel to us and called us
[1:08:00] he's not looking for your power he's not
[1:08:02] looking for your strength he's looking
[1:08:04] for you just to believe him and yield
[1:08:06] yourself to him and stay with this word
[1:08:08] and watch the word do all that it was
[1:08:09] intended to do
[1:08:11] and not fall back into the old trap of
[1:08:14] manipulating twisting figuring out
[1:08:16] or sorting it all out ourselves just
[1:08:18] believe it the way he gave it
[1:08:20] stand upon it and stay with this word
[1:08:22] amen and let god do what he's going to
[1:08:25] do
[1:08:27] there's no confusion about what time it
[1:08:29] is
[1:08:31] once mary received that visitation there
[1:08:33] was no confusion about what time it was
[1:08:37] in the message the easter seal he said
[1:08:40] his messianic anointed ones believe that
[1:08:44] what is the messiah what is the messiah
[1:08:47] messiah's anointed one and now if he was
[1:08:50] the messiah by being the anointed one
[1:08:52] for that day to fulfill the word of god
[1:08:55] to be the redeemer and the anointed one
[1:08:56] of god raised up that body
[1:08:59] his bride is the anointed one for this
[1:09:01] day
[1:09:03] his anointing his word in bride form
[1:09:07] the manifestation of this hour
[1:09:11] and i'd say god here i am
[1:09:15] here i am god i can't do it i can't make
[1:09:18] it happen
[1:09:19] but i believe your word i believe that
[1:09:22] you sent that prophet to me he was
[1:09:24] calling me and i believe this is the
[1:09:26] hour
[1:09:26] and this is the time and i believe that
[1:09:28] you will
[1:09:29] you will deal that final blow to satan
[1:09:32] and you will bruise him under the
[1:09:34] bride's feet
[1:09:35] in this day you're going to do it i
[1:09:37] can't do it but i can say be it unto me
[1:09:40] according to your word
[1:09:42] that i believe what that angel said i
[1:09:44] believe what he told me i believe
[1:09:46] amen that you gave me strength to
[1:09:48] conceive
[1:09:50] and now you're bringing forth your word
[1:09:52] from me
[1:09:53] help us to keep it pure
[1:09:57] brother branham said in revelation
[1:10:00] and the message revelation chapter 4
[1:10:05] said all right here was voices
[1:10:09] oh how we need in jeffersonville
[1:10:12] thousands
[1:10:13] of lived voices the bride has a voice
[1:10:18] the bride has a ministry we've been
[1:10:19] through all of that
[1:10:21] but brother man i'm going to start
[1:10:22] talking about voices
[1:10:25] the thousands of lived voices the
[1:10:27] thunder of god thundering out in
[1:10:29] sweetness
[1:10:30] and holiness purity
[1:10:34] undefiled lies walking around
[1:10:39] catch this he's using such strong
[1:10:43] language
[1:10:45] thousands of lit voices the thunder of
[1:10:47] god thundering out in the
[1:10:49] sweetness and holiness
[1:10:53] purity undefiled lives
[1:10:57] walking around the earth today without a
[1:10:59] blemish yes sir real christians
[1:11:02] that's thunder against the enemy
[1:11:05] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:11:07] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:11:10] can jump or how much you can do this
[1:11:12] or shout but what hurts the devil is to
[1:11:14] see that sanctified
[1:11:16] holy life consecrated to god say
[1:11:19] anything to him call him anything
[1:11:21] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:11:23] right on
[1:11:24] oh my that throws him away that's the
[1:11:28] thunder that shakes
[1:11:29] the devil
[1:11:32] we think that we're going to do such
[1:11:34] mighty things and
[1:11:35] and stomp on the devil's head and you're
[1:11:38] going to bruise him under your feet and
[1:11:39] when the bride she's gonna she's gonna
[1:11:41] do this and she's gonna stomp on his
[1:11:43] head and she's gonna defeat him
[1:11:45] how did he say that she was gonna defeat
[1:11:46] him by a sweet humble submissive pure
[1:11:49] life
[1:11:52] not yelling and screaming and acting
[1:11:54] bold and tough and like she can do this
[1:11:56] and she could
[1:11:57] mary couldn't do anything but yet he was
[1:12:00] going to use her
[1:12:01] to bring forth the seed that would
[1:12:03] bruise his head to fulfill the word that
[1:12:05] was going to bring a redemption that was
[1:12:07] going to absolutely
[1:12:08] take away all the power that he had
[1:12:11] and how he's going to do it through a
[1:12:13] simple sweet little humble
[1:12:15] virgin girl that could just take the
[1:12:17] angel at his word
[1:12:18] without even being able to fully
[1:12:20] comprehend the science behind it she was
[1:12:22] going to have something in her that
[1:12:23] could say
[1:12:23] that's the truth be it unto me and
[1:12:25] submit herself to the word
[1:12:27] and god was going to use this vessel to
[1:12:29] bring a destruction to the devil's
[1:12:30] kingdom
[1:12:35] she's gonna use sarah and her old age
[1:12:38] amen when her milk veins were dried out
[1:12:40] when it was in she was incapable and
[1:12:42] impossible for her to bring forth the
[1:12:44] promised word she was an absolute
[1:12:45] weakness amen she was beyond any time
[1:12:48] any possibility of ever producing the
[1:12:50] word amen but that's what he was going
[1:12:52] to use
[1:12:53] he was going to take a broken down
[1:12:54] vessel that was old and unable and he
[1:12:57] was going to come to her
[1:12:59] and he was going to visit her and he's
[1:13:02] going to visit her when he visits them
[1:13:04] through the sign of the messiah he's
[1:13:05] going to turn them back but then he's
[1:13:07] going to come to her privately and he's
[1:13:09] going to give her strength to conceive
[1:13:12] because she didn't have it in herself
[1:13:14] she wasn't capable in herself
[1:13:16] in all of her humanity and all of her
[1:13:18] efforts she was a failure but when god
[1:13:20] come on the scene
[1:13:21] he made her more than able
[1:13:24] what did he bring he brought the
[1:13:25] promised word
[1:13:28] and now it's time that god's going to
[1:13:30] take in his hand
[1:13:32] amen a woman that's going to fulfill the
[1:13:34] word amen that's going to be subject to
[1:13:36] the word
[1:13:37] and he's going to use this woman amen to
[1:13:40] drive a nail down
[1:13:41] a death blow to the devil himself
[1:13:45] but it's not going to be because she's
[1:13:47] able and she's mighty
[1:13:48] and sheik and this and i can talk the
[1:13:50] devils like they're garbage and i can
[1:13:52] speak to satan like he's a
[1:13:57] but how is he going to do it what's it
[1:13:58] going to look like what's going to be
[1:14:00] that
[1:14:00] thunder that shakes the devil and throws
[1:14:02] him off
[1:14:04] what's going to be that power that
[1:14:06] thunder that the devil fears
[1:14:09] what's it going to be somebody who can
[1:14:11] yell threats and
[1:14:13] verbal abuses towards the devil
[1:14:17] act like they're big and tough and can i
[1:14:20] can handle the devil
[1:14:22] he don't know who he's talking to
[1:14:27] do you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:14:28] not what god's looking for
[1:14:30] that's not what god wants he's not going
[1:14:32] to share his glory with any man he's not
[1:14:34] looking for a woman who's going to be
[1:14:35] like sarah says i got this figured out
[1:14:37] i know obviously god wants to do it this
[1:14:39] way
[1:14:41] but he's looking for somebody who
[1:14:43] already realizes i'm washed up
[1:14:45] and incapable and i made a mess out of
[1:14:47] everything
[1:14:50] he's looking for somebody who will come
[1:14:51] finally to us surrender to the word
[1:14:53] and quit manipulating quit playing with
[1:14:55] it quit figuring it out
[1:14:57] quit being smart quit being strong quit
[1:14:59] being able
[1:15:00] and then get to the place where you got
[1:15:02] no ability
[1:15:03] no capability there's no way for you to
[1:15:05] be this strong one
[1:15:08] there's no way for you to be this tool
[1:15:10] that he's going to use
[1:15:11] amen to bruise the devil's head
[1:15:15] because he wasn't going to let you do it
[1:15:17] anyways
[1:15:20] he was going to do it through you
[1:15:28] what's the devil what's the thunder that
[1:15:31] thunders against the devil
[1:15:32] what's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:15:34] what is it that the devil fears
[1:15:38] sweetness and holiness
[1:15:42] purity undefiled lives
[1:15:46] walking around in the earth today
[1:15:48] without a blemish
[1:15:51] what's he afraid of he's afraid of the
[1:15:54] life of christ
[1:15:56] he's afraid amen of that word coming to
[1:15:59] life inside of you
[1:16:01] and changing all your wants and all your
[1:16:03] desires and bringing you in a total
[1:16:05] submission to the word
[1:16:06] until you and the word become the same
[1:16:08] thing and whatever he was
[1:16:10] he now is through you
[1:16:13] in obedience and in sweetness and in
[1:16:15] gentleness
[1:16:16] and in quietness amen in purity without
[1:16:19] a blemish
[1:16:20] how could you be without a blemish
[1:16:21] because you've been turned back virgin
[1:16:23] by a virgin word
[1:16:24] you've been washed with pure water amen
[1:16:27] that flows from the fountain of god
[1:16:28] and washed away all of the effects of
[1:16:30] the prostitutes washed away all the
[1:16:32] spots
[1:16:33] and brought you back to a virgin
[1:16:34] condition by a virgin word
[1:16:39] and those are the people that shake the
[1:16:42] devil
[1:16:45] it's not what we say and it's not how we
[1:16:47] act
[1:16:48] in our ourselves but it's that
[1:16:52] life that the word produces
[1:16:57] the word produces a bride
[1:17:02] and the bride is submissive to her
[1:17:05] headship
[1:17:06] which is her husband which is the
[1:17:08] revealed word of the hour
[1:17:10] and that simple submission to the word
[1:17:12] and humility and surrender to the word
[1:17:15] and allowing the word to come and take
[1:17:17] absolute authority in our lives
[1:17:18] and living through us is the very thing
[1:17:21] that the devil's afraid of and the very
[1:17:22] thing that will defeat the devil
[1:17:26] many times in our lives we want to fight
[1:17:29] the devil and defeat the devil and
[1:17:30] overcome the devil
[1:17:32] amen but the thing is we're still
[1:17:33] playing games with the word
[1:17:36] and the very thing that'll shake him off
[1:17:38] and the very thing that'll throw him
[1:17:39] away
[1:17:39] is our surrender to the word the life of
[1:17:42] christ
[1:17:45] god has brought us to the hour
[1:17:48] where we realized this bondwoman
[1:17:53] and her son can't stay
[1:17:58] i it cannot stay
[1:18:02] and one time i thought it was a good
[1:18:03] idea i know now it's not a good idea
[1:18:07] something has happened to me amen i've
[1:18:09] had a visitation of the lord i've
[1:18:12] i've conceived on the word and i realize
[1:18:14] now that this bond woman and her son
[1:18:16] it ain't going to work anymore
[1:18:19] it's got to go lord it's got to go
[1:18:23] i want just your word and your word
[1:18:26] alone
[1:18:27] i want to be able to be humble and
[1:18:29] submissive to your word i want to be
[1:18:31] reverent to your word i want
[1:18:32] i want to be a submissive to my headship
[1:18:34] which is the revealed word
[1:18:37] and i want to open myself and let that
[1:18:39] word
[1:18:40] have the victory through me
[1:18:45] this is the hour this is the time
[1:18:48] for the greatest victory and he's going
[1:18:51] to use a woman for it
[1:18:54] is that right but he's going to use a
[1:18:57] woman for it like he used
[1:18:58] mary and how powerful and bold and
[1:19:03] strong was mary
[1:19:05] her power was in her faith and her
[1:19:08] ability to yield
[1:19:11] i said god make us just like mary
[1:19:15] totally surrendered to you let's all
[1:19:20] stand
[1:19:22] if we want to see
[1:19:26] if we want to see the rest of the bride
[1:19:30] the word produces a bride
[1:19:34] if we want to have the great victory
[1:19:37] we want to see god win and the devil
[1:19:39] lose
[1:19:40] that it's going to take a full surrender
[1:19:43] and a submission
[1:19:45] to the word of god i thank god for the
[1:19:48] day that we live in
[1:19:50] i thank god that he's brought us a pure
[1:19:52] clean
[1:19:53] unadulterated word
[1:19:57] i said god let me stay true to that word
[1:20:00] help me god
[1:20:01] i surrender to you but help me god keep
[1:20:04] us clean
[1:20:06] keep us pure let's bow our heads
[1:20:10] dear lord jesus we thank you father
[1:20:13] for the privilege lord of standing here
[1:20:16] so many things have been spoken about
[1:20:18] this end time bribe
[1:20:21] you through your prophet as as you have
[1:20:23] revealed us
[1:20:25] you have showed us through the word what
[1:20:27] our position is
[1:20:29] you have opened up that word and you
[1:20:31] called us by name
[1:20:33] you've placed us as a bride you've told
[1:20:35] us what our position is and what you're
[1:20:37] going to do through this bride
[1:20:39] in the end time but god that's what you
[1:20:42] revealed to mary
[1:20:45] and mary had no ability to bring it to
[1:20:48] pass
[1:20:50] but she had something inside of her that
[1:20:52] could believe it
[1:20:54] she had a desire within her to yield
[1:20:59] and receive that word god you've placed
[1:21:02] the same thing inside of us
[1:21:05] no ability to perform it no ability to
[1:21:07] bring it to pass
[1:21:08] but yet we believe with all of our
[1:21:10] hearts that we are
[1:21:12] part of that bride that we are the ones
[1:21:15] that you're going to use to bring that
[1:21:17] final victory
[1:21:18] that's going to reverse the curse so
[1:21:21] reverse that our atoms will change
[1:21:24] i believe lord it's me i believe i'm the
[1:21:26] one
[1:21:29] but god i just want to yield in a
[1:21:31] greater way to the headship of the world
[1:21:34] i want to surrender everything to you
[1:21:36] lord that you might take this vessel
[1:21:38] and use it for your glory help me god
[1:21:42] never to become
[1:21:43] self-sufficient never to be wise in my
[1:21:47] own wisdom and my own thinking to
[1:21:49] to conjure up my own solution or come up
[1:21:52] with my own fulfillment of the word
[1:21:54] god i pray that you would keep us from
[1:21:56] that
[1:21:58] help us to believe what you've given to
