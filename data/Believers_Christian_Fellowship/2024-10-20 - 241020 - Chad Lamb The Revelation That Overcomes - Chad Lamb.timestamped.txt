[21:32] we love you God and we ask it in Jesus
[21:35] Christ's name amen amen amen God bless
[21:40] you all good morning it's good to be
[21:42] here with youen if you could take your
[21:44] Bibles and turn to the Book of Romans
[21:47] say God bless you brother Jim it was
[21:49] certainly good to hear you sing again
[21:50] brother we appreciate that I said when I
[21:54] see him standing singing I thank God
[21:56] that he's healed our brother and
[21:57] continuing to heal our brother amen God
[22:00] is so
[22:01] good amen let's look at Romans chapter
[22:05] 16 together we're going to look at uh
[22:08] read a couple verses while we're
[22:09] standing yet Romans
[22:13] 16 let's begin with verse
[22:17] 25 Romans 16:25 now to him that is of
[22:21] power to establish you according to my
[22:24] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[22:26] according to the revelation of the
[22:28] mystery
[22:29] which was Kept Secret since the world
[22:30] began but now is made manifest and by
[22:33] the scriptures of the prophets according
[22:36] to the Commandment of the Everlasting
[22:37] God made known to All Nations for The
[22:40] Obedience of Faith to God only wise be
[22:43] glory through Jesus Christ forever amen
[22:46] amen amen God bless you as you have your
[22:49] seats praise be to
[22:51] God we look back uh here at verse 25 it
[22:56] says now to him that is of power to
[22:57] establish you this word establish you is
[23:01] is a word that I want to look at for
[23:03] just a moment if we pull it up uh in the
[23:05] concordance it's it's translated
[23:08] established established strengthened
[23:11] steadfastly set that's how it's
[23:13] translated into the King James Bible it
[23:15] means to make stable Amen to place
[23:19] firmly to set fast to fix to set one's
[23:25] face
[23:27] steadfastly amen to strengthen to make
[23:30] firm to render
[23:33] constant
[23:36] amen
[23:38] amen I don't know about you but I like
[23:40] that amen the whole list sounds good to
[23:42] me that's what I want and he and he says
[23:45] he says now him that is of power to
[23:47] establish you so God has the power to
[23:50] establish you but how according to my
[23:53] gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[23:55] and according to the revelation of the
[23:57] mystery which was kept secret since the
[23:59] world began so what is this preaching of
[24:01] Paul revealing the mystery of Jesus
[24:03] Christ what does it do it's what God is
[24:05] using to establish the
[24:08] church and so what what is God what is
[24:10] God doing with the gospel the preaching
[24:13] of Christ the revelation of the mystery
[24:15] what is he doing he's he's making
[24:18] stable his church he's placing it firm
[24:21] he's setting it fast amen he's he's he's
[24:25] setting one's face steadfastly he's
[24:27] making firm he's rendering it
[24:31] constant amen how's he doing it by the
[24:34] revelation of the word being preached
[24:36] amen and so and so we realize that God
[24:39] does not change his ways amen he's still
[24:41] doing the same thing he's still
[24:43] revealing the mystery of Jesus Christ in
[24:45] our day there's still a mystery that has
[24:47] been kept secret in the back part of
[24:49] God's mind but has been revealed amen
[24:51] through another messenger amen and he
[24:53] come back to restore to us all that was
[24:55] lost and to Break Forth that great
[24:58] mystery that was in the back part of
[25:00] God's mind and what is God doing God is
[25:04] establishing us according to the
[25:05] preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[25:08] and the Mystery that's been hid since
[25:09] the foundation of the world and so it's
[25:12] this gospel it's this Revelation it it's
[25:15] this preaching that brought forth amen
[25:17] it's what God is using to set us fast to
[25:20] establish us to make us firm to render
[25:23] us constant amen so so that is to me
[25:27] that is just absolutely amazing that
[25:30] this is the tool in God's hand because
[25:32] he's got the power to establish us but
[25:34] he's doing it according to the
[25:36] preaching according to the
[25:38] mystery let's turn quickly to Judges
[25:41] chapter
[25:50] 3 also want to say as we're turning that
[25:53] I thoroughly enjoyed the last two
[25:55] Services the service with brother
[25:57] Nathaniel was was wonderful what a good
[25:59] lesson it was and then I also very much
[26:03] uh enjoyed Wednesday night with brother
[26:04] Andreas and so many I felt like I left
[26:07] with a pocket full of gold
[26:09] nuggets and and I've been chewing on it
[26:12] meditating on discussing it ever since
[26:15] then amen and so there's some things
[26:17] that he said that even has just been an
[26:19] inspiration even for today and so I I
[26:22] was just disappointed that he
[26:25] stopped and then disappointed we
[26:28] couldn't add another service the next
[26:29] day and so I talked to him about
[26:32] possibly coming back and doing weekend
[26:33] meetings so he has a chance to express
[26:35] more of his thought and he said he would
[26:37] if the Lord allows so just pray that the
[26:39] door opens hopefully sometime this
[26:41] coming year that we can have our brother
[26:43] back according to the will of the Lord
[26:45] but I certainly enjoyed it
[26:48] amen uh Judges chapter 3 Judges chapter
[26:55] 3:31 I'm going to read one verse judges
[26:59] 3:31 and after him was shamgar the son
[27:02] of anith which slew the Philistines 600
[27:05] men with an ox go and he also delivered
[27:09] Israel me we've got a little scripture
[27:11] here there's only really two scriptures
[27:13] in the Bible that I'm aware of that
[27:14] mentioned shamgar here is it where it's
[27:16] directly mentioned and it's mentioned
[27:18] also Deborah mentioned shamgar uh and
[27:21] and as she begins to speak in the next
[27:23] chapter but uh but we see there's just a
[27:27] little blip in the Bible about this
[27:30] shamgar uh who slew the Philistine 600
[27:34] men with an ox go and he also delivered
[27:37] Israel and so we know he became one of
[27:39] the judges of Israel we've got so little
[27:41] information but I thank God that he sent
[27:43] a
[27:44] prophet who could give us more
[27:47] information because God doesn't Place
[27:49] anything in his Bible in vain everything
[27:50] is there for a purpose and it has a
[27:52] meaning and brother Ram taught us that
[27:54] God condenses his truth because the
[27:56] Bible's only so big but the the truth of
[27:58] God is is is unending Everlasting and
[28:01] unfathomable and he's packed the whole
[28:03] revelation of God into the Bible so so
[28:06] many things have to be extracted out of
[28:08] it amen but but in the message convinced
[28:11] and then concerned he says uh he speaks
[28:15] of shamgar he says he was one of the
[28:17] judges of Israel many ministers never
[28:19] even seen that in the Bible but he was
[28:21] one of the judges of Israel one little
[28:23] verse wrote about him but I like him
[28:25] he's a man after my heart now you know
[28:28] the Philistines then every man did what
[28:30] he wanted to do so we find out that the
[28:33] Israelites had raised up a whole lot of
[28:35] crop and the Philistines would set back
[28:37] over there and gambled and let them slay
[28:39] for them and there would there they'd
[28:42] walk right in no Unity among them go
[28:45] right on in and say well take their
[28:47] crops year after year they did that this
[28:49] little old fellow one day he wasn't a
[28:52] Warrior brother REM says he was just a
[28:54] humble
[28:55] farmer he wasn't the Bible doesn't
[28:58] record that he was any any had any
[29:00] special
[29:01] abilities talents Supernatural
[29:05] strengths but he was just a one little
[29:08] fellow he wasn't a warrior only thing he
[29:10] had was his
[29:12] crop and I imagined him standing there
[29:14] after putting his crop in the barn he
[29:16] looked at his little ragged kids and his
[29:18] wife needed a dress and he just got it
[29:21] all laid in nice and he was standing
[29:23] there leaning saying well maybe we can
[29:25] eat this winter one thing I absolutely
[29:28] of love about the ministry of a prophet
[29:30] in our day is he makes the Bible come
[29:33] alive in a way where you can realize
[29:35] these were human beings they had motion
[29:37] and feeling and families and situations
[29:39] and circumstances and if it happened for
[29:42] them it can happen for me amen that
[29:44] we're living amen like the Bible says of
[29:46] Elisha he was a man of like passion such
[29:49] as we are we realize then The Human
[29:51] Experience is The Human Experience and
[29:53] it has been The Human Experience for
[29:55] quite some time so there's nothing
[29:57] different between them and and I me and
[29:59] them it's just the time frame that we're
[30:01] living
[30:02] in but many times the conditions repeat
[30:05] we find ourselves in the in the same
[30:07] situations and we can take strength from
[30:10] what we read what God has
[30:12] done and he's he's now we the situation
[30:15] Comes Alive amen year after year he's
[30:18] farming he's laboring he's working and
[30:20] year after year they come and steal the
[30:22] majority of what he's worked for leaving
[30:24] him just enough to barely sustain he's
[30:27] barely getting by he's barely surviving
[30:29] no thriving and his kids are ragged his
[30:32] wife needs a dress I mean and he's he's
[30:35] got hope that this time it'll be
[30:37] different this time we'll keep our crop
[30:40] amen and this is the this is the
[30:42] situation shamgar finds himself in and
[30:45] he says he he just got it all laid in
[30:49] nice put packed in the barn and he was
[30:51] standing there leaning saying well maybe
[30:53] we can eat this winter he heard
[30:56] something he looked looked out the barn
[30:58] window and here come a thousand
[31:00] Philistines March March March great big
[31:03] plates of armor over them big
[31:04] well-trained men Spears in their hands
[31:07] marching right up to take what he had he
[31:10] looked down at his kids he looked at his
[31:12] wife he was concerned but what was he he
[31:15] was helpless he's not a swordsman now he
[31:18] didn't say now wait a minute maybe I
[31:20] better go to school and learn how to
[31:21] duel the Creeds if he'd had done that
[31:23] that's all he'd have knowed about but
[31:25] there's one thing that he knowed he had
[31:27] happen to think I love when somebody
[31:30] just happens to think you realize we
[31:32] don't ever just happen to
[31:35] think he just happened to think by birth
[31:39] I'm an Israelite and God promised
[31:42] Abraham my father that his seed would
[31:44] possess the gates of his enemy amen
[31:47] that's enough amen he was concerned of
[31:50] his family he was convinced he was an
[31:52] Israelite the first thing he had in his
[31:54] hand he grabbed it he was an ox goat a
[31:56] stick a little piece of brass on the end
[31:58] of it knocked the mud off the plow
[32:00] pushed the and go along go the ox as it
[32:03] went along and a thousand Philistines
[32:05] with armor he he don't see the
[32:08] opposition he was concerned and he was
[32:10] convinced he was convinced and know that
[32:13] he was an Israelite he was convinced
[32:15] that God could couldn't lie he was
[32:17] convinced that the blessing was upon him
[32:19] he knew that it was a promise of God
[32:21] Amen brother I feel religious right now
[32:23] he was convinced that it was God's
[32:25] promise just the same as acts 238 is
[32:28] God's promise he was convinced that God
[32:30] said his seed which he was would possess
[32:34] the Gate of the enemy so he grabbed that
[32:36] Ox goat and stood right out there and
[32:38] beat every one of them
[32:42] down amen listen listen something
[32:46] changed in shamgar but what changed in
[32:49] shamgar was not the strength in his arms
[32:52] what changed in shamgar was not he
[32:54] didn't get extra weapons extra tools
[32:57] extra gifts extra
[32:59] talents none of that changed what
[33:02] changed in samgar is his spiritual
[33:04] Amnesia broke and he caught a revelation
[33:07] of who he
[33:08] was what gave him the strength to resist
[33:11] the Philistines was not a sword was not
[33:13] a spear was not something new amen was
[33:17] actually something old
[33:20] yeah a promise a word of God that he had
[33:23] already made a promise that he had
[33:25] already given that was laying there and
[33:27] it was unchanging it was as unchanging
[33:29] as God was unchanging and what happened
[33:32] is is the situation of Life had beat
[33:34] shamgar and the rest of the Israelites
[33:36] down until they started to forget who
[33:39] they were and they started forget the
[33:41] the what it meant to be a Seed of
[33:43] Abraham and they lost sight of the
[33:46] promise so many negative things had
[33:48] happened so many bad things had happened
[33:50] to them they lost their crops they come
[33:52] under bondage and so many situations
[33:55] begin to Rob them of the revelation of
[33:58] who they were and what it
[34:00] means to be a Seed of
[34:03] Abraham so when it come time for God to
[34:06] bring
[34:07] Deliverance he didn't
[34:09] need he didn't need to send somebody to
[34:12] military
[34:15] training he didn't need to teach him how
[34:17] to forge
[34:20] weapons the the brother B said that he
[34:23] was helpless he was helpless year after
[34:27] after year they had come and robbed him
[34:29] of his crops year after year they had
[34:31] been in bondage and slavery year after
[34:34] year he was helpless to resist them he
[34:38] could do nothing to hold on to his crops
[34:40] he could not do nothing to stop the the
[34:43] Looting and the thievery and he could do
[34:45] nothing to change his condition because
[34:48] when he looked at himself in the flesh
[34:50] there was nothing he could do he was
[34:53] weak yes sir and that remains the
[34:55] reality listen if we look at our flesh
[34:58] we are
[35:00] weak if we look at our talents our
[35:03] abilities our
[35:05] skills our strength our
[35:08] mind everything on the human level is an
[35:11] absolute failure and incapable and
[35:14] weakness of overcoming in the day we
[35:16] live but oh I thank God what changed in
[35:19] shamgar was not anything physical
[35:21] nothing physical changed in shamgar what
[35:23] changed in shamgar was a revelation that
[35:26] came back to him wait a minute wait a
[35:30] minute didn't Moses say didn't God tell
[35:33] us that he's given us this land didn't
[35:35] he tell us that it's ours to possess
[35:38] didn't he tell us we could drive out the
[35:39] enemies didn't he tell us that his
[35:42] Delight would be upon us didn't he tell
[35:44] us that it would bring forth milk and
[35:45] honey didn't he tell us that this
[35:47] promise is to the Seed of Abraham they
[35:49] shall possess the gates of their enemy
[35:52] why am I standing here letting this
[35:54] enemy possess my Gates when there's a
[35:56] promise laying there amen shamgar didn't
[35:59] just think God dropped the Revelation in
[36:02] his heart to connect him back to a
[36:04] promise that had already been made by a
[36:06] prophet of
[36:08] God and shamgar overcame by
[36:20] Revelation shamgar
[36:23] overcame by a
[36:26] revelation not by a new tactic not by a
[36:29] new skill not by a new
[36:33] gift amen he overcame by a
[36:37] revelation and a revelation of what had
[36:39] already been written that's
[36:42] right
[36:45] what I love the
[36:47] Bible I love this message it's life to
[36:51] the children of
[36:54] Goden shamgar didn't have to change one
[36:57] thing about himself to defeat those
[36:59] enemies
[37:03] right he didn't have to go to
[37:07] church he didn't have to offer an
[37:09] additional
[37:10] sacrifice he didn't have to get some
[37:12] Merit from God some he didn't do
[37:14] something to get an extra reward he
[37:15] didn't have to change one thing about
[37:18] himself and he didn't need to do or get
[37:21] anything else all he needed to do was be
[37:23] himself yeah amen and what was shamgar
[37:27] you know you look in the natural shamgar
[37:29] was a
[37:30] farmer shamgar was a nobody he was weak
[37:33] he was he was poor he he had he had been
[37:36] robbed so many times his children were
[37:39] shabby if his children were shabby and
[37:41] his wife needed a dress what did he look
[37:43] like right right what was this estate
[37:46] looking like he had no extra funds to do
[37:49] anything he everything about him was in
[37:51] deterioration he didn't need to get a
[37:53] loan he didn't need to go to school he
[37:55] didn't need to buy weapons he didn't
[37:57] need to go to the church he didn't need
[37:59] to get new gifts he didn't need to
[38:00] change anything about himself what
[38:03] needed to change was his
[38:05] Revelation and it was the only thing
[38:07] that needed to change and when the
[38:08] Revelation changed he took up his Ox
[38:12] go because what was the ox go the ox go
[38:15] was him he was a farmer it was what was
[38:18] in his hand it was who he was it was the
[38:21] it was the position he was in that God
[38:24] had put him in he didn't have to get a
[38:26] new position he could fight like a
[38:29] farmer not like a warrior amen it's so
[38:33] interesting he took the ox goat he took
[38:35] the ox go and went out and slew 600
[38:38] Philistines with an ox go because the ox
[38:40] go represented his position he didn't
[38:43] have to change position he didn't have
[38:44] to wait till he started preaching he
[38:46] didn't have to wait till he got a
[38:47] position in the church he could go as he
[38:50] was he could go with the Revelation he
[38:53] had and who he was and the position God
[38:55] put him in and with that revelation and
[38:57] he can knock down all the Philistine
[38:59] Army that came to Rob him how foolish a
[39:02] farmer with Rags with an ox goat in his
[39:04] hand standing in the middle of the road
[39:06] beating down 600 Philistines and at the
[39:08] end of the day they're all dead and he's
[39:10] standing there with an ox goat in his
[39:12] hand it's completely unreasonable but
[39:15] this has nothing to do with reason it
[39:17] has everything to do with the revelation
[39:19] of the promise of God for the children
[39:21] of God and that is what God has restored
[39:23] in our day he's broke our spiritual
[39:25] Amnesia to bring us back back in contact
[39:28] with who we really
[39:31] are that's why the message
[39:34] came
[39:36] heyen listen friends the message didn't
[39:38] came so we can know who William brandom
[39:40] is
[39:41] because because God Vindicated him we
[39:44] had to have him had to have a messenger
[39:46] had to have somebody who would restore
[39:48] had to have the Fulfillment of Malachi 4
[39:50] had to have the Fulfillment of
[39:51] Revelation 10:7 and we had to know that
[39:53] that's part of our Revelation but that
[39:55] came so you can know who you
[39:58] are because just knowing who somebody
[40:01] else is does not give me the victory
[40:03] what gives me the victory is when I know
[40:04] who I am according to the word and I can
[40:07] take my position in this
[40:09] Bible sir amen almighty
[40:13] god let's turn to First Samuel if you
[40:16] will with
[40:21] me I love the fact that Samuel didn't
[40:25] have to improve himself
[40:30] change
[40:31] himself change his nature change his
[40:35] occupation changes skill
[40:37] set he didn't have to change anything
[40:41] the only thing that had to change was
[40:42] his
[40:45] thinking and when his thinking
[40:48] changed he already was everything he
[40:51] needed to be amen
[40:53] right in order to have Victory he was
[40:56] already everything he needed to be to
[40:59] win the day because he was
[41:02] Israelite amen he was Seed of Abraham he
[41:06] was in the promised land he was a
[41:08] recipient of the
[41:11] promise listen I don't think we have to
[41:14] change who we are our occupation our
[41:19] position I think we just need to move
[41:21] forward with the revelation of the
[41:24] word 1st Samuel 17
[41:28] need to turn there
[41:29] myself 1st Samuel
[41:36] 17:33 this is when Goliath is coming and
[41:38] making his great boast and when he
[41:41] boasts everybody runs away afraid even
[41:43] Saul whose head and shoulders Above the
[41:45] Rest of the army of Israel he's hiding
[41:48] but the little Shepherd Boy comes along
[41:51] to bring cheese and bread and and wine
[41:53] to his brothers and the captain of the
[41:55] host and see how things are going and
[41:57] and uh he becomes a big problem for them
[42:00] and the reason he becomes a big problem
[42:02] for them is he's not
[42:04] afraid they're all afraid but he's not
[42:06] afraid and because he's not afraid he's
[42:08] a big problem for all of them because
[42:09] they're
[42:12] afraid I love it and so word gets up to
[42:15] Saul that there's a there's a little
[42:17] runt in the camp that thinks he can
[42:19] fight
[42:19] Goliath and so uh uh Saul calls for him
[42:25] and has this discussion with him and
[42:27] let's pick it up in verse 331 17 and 33
[42:29] 1 samel
[42:30] 17:33 and Saul said to David Thou Art
[42:33] not able to go against this Philistine
[42:37] to fight with him for thou art but a
[42:39] youth and he a man of war from his
[42:42] youth you are not
[42:46] able what was Saul looking at Saul was
[42:48] looking at the
[42:50] outside he was looking at the flesh the
[42:53] circumstances he was looking at what
[42:55] most people call reality
[42:58] but that reality was not
[43:01] reality the Unseen was the reality the
[43:04] scene was not the reality so he's
[43:06] looking at a Shepherd boy he's looking
[43:09] at a small boy he's looking at him
[43:11] standing there in whatever he would have
[43:13] wore that day no armor no armor plating
[43:16] no weapons he's got a bag a shepherd's
[43:19] bag he's got a sling in that bag he's
[43:21] got a staff maybe sandals and who knows
[43:24] what kind of garment he didn't show up
[43:26] for for
[43:30] battle so he looks at him and he says
[43:33] listen you can't go he's a warrior and
[43:36] you're just a youth and he's been a
[43:37] warrior since he was a youth he's he's
[43:40] you're outgunned he's out he's out
[43:42] you're out trained he he's he's got
[43:44] skill he's got weapons he's got size
[43:47] he's got everything that you don't have
[43:49] yeah right but n David knew he had
[43:52] something Goliath didn't have Goliath
[43:55] had so many things that David couldn't
[43:57] match David couldn't match his armor
[43:59] David couldn't match his stature David
[44:01] couldn't match his strength David
[44:03] couldn't match his skill in war David
[44:05] couldn't match anything when it came to
[44:07] the external he had nothing to match but
[44:10] he had one thing that Goliath didn't
[44:12] have and he knew that one thing was
[44:15] enough he goes to verse 34 and David
[44:18] said unto Saul thy servant kept his
[44:21] father sheep and there came a lion and a
[44:24] bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[44:26] and I went out after him and smote him
[44:28] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[44:30] when he arose against me I caught him by
[44:32] his beard and smote him and slew him thy
[44:35] servant slew both The Lion and the bear
[44:38] and this
[44:40] uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one
[44:42] of them seeing Heath defied the armies
[44:45] of the Living
[44:46] God David had an experience with God and
[44:50] that experience with God was was listen
[44:53] The Experience David had was when David
[44:56] was in his position as a
[45:00] Shepherd amen right that was his
[45:04] position when he was in his position was
[45:06] Shepherd yeah that position he was in
[45:09] was not Warrior that position he was was
[45:11] not captain of the host the position he
[45:13] was in was Shepherd and when he was a
[45:16] Shepherd Faithfully fulfilling the
[45:18] duties of a Shepherd here comes a lion
[45:20] and here comes a bear and so he goes out
[45:23] as he
[45:25] is as a shepherd
[45:28] with a revelation of who he is and he
[45:30] smites the lion and he smites the bear
[45:33] he rescues the Sheep he brings them back
[45:35] to the fold and now he stands and he
[45:37] gives this experience Amen to he gives
[45:41] this experience to Saul and what he's
[45:42] telling Saul is sa listen don't worry
[45:45] about strength don't worry about listen
[45:47] the lion had teeth and Claws I don't
[45:49] have teeth and Claws the bear had teeth
[45:51] and Claws and thick skin they had muscle
[45:53] they had weight they had every advantage
[45:56] over me quit looking at all of that amen
[45:58] there was something else in me that they
[46:00] didn't have amen praise the Lord and he
[46:03] says now then then that here's the this
[46:05] is the key to me he says I slew verse 36
[46:10] I thy servant slew both The Lion and the
[46:11] bear and this uncircumcised Philistine
[46:16] this was what he said all the way back
[46:18] when he first heard Goliath boast and
[46:20] when he boasted and everybody ran and
[46:22] hid David was like where are you guys
[46:24] going why is everybody hiding in their
[46:25] tents as Goliath say is out there
[46:27] boasting send me a man and you know what
[46:29] he says he says what will the King give
[46:32] to the man that slays this uncircumcised
[46:34] Philistine look at the title he gives
[46:37] Goliath he doesn't call him a warrior he
[46:39] doesn't call him a giant he doesn't call
[46:41] him anything what he does is he
[46:43] positionally places Goliath and he
[46:45] positionally places himself this is an
[46:48] uncircumcised meaning he's not part of
[46:50] the word he's not part of the promise
[46:52] he's not Seed of Abraham he has no
[46:54] Covenant with God Amen he's got sure
[46:57] he's 9 foot tall sure he's got a spear
[47:00] like a Weaver's beam sure he's stronger
[47:02] than five men sure he's got he's been a
[47:05] soldier since he was a child sure he
[47:07] knows how to do it but I'm not looking
[47:09] at that I'm looking at a promise of God
[47:11] he sent through a prophet amen and he's
[47:14] uncircumcised and what's David what what
[47:16] is David pointing to when he says this
[47:18] uncircumcised Philistines he's pointing
[47:20] to the fact that he's circumcised he's
[47:22] part of the Covenant he's part of the
[47:24] promised word he's Seed of Abraham
[47:28] he doesn't defeat Goliath by strength he
[47:31] doesn't defeat Goliath by wisdom he
[47:33] doesn't defeat the Goliath by changing
[47:35] his position he defeats Goliath by a
[47:40] revelation what Revelation the
[47:42] revelation of who he
[47:47] is we can we can have all kinds of
[47:51] Revelation that's right revelation of
[47:54] the church age of Messengers revelation
[47:55] of the correct doctrin and and they are
[47:58] all extremely
[47:59] important revelation of the seventh
[48:02] messenger and the seventh angel and
[48:04] revelation of what the mystery of the
[48:06] seals were revelation of the Thunders
[48:08] but all of that came to bring you the
[48:10] greatest Revelation you'll ever have and
[48:12] that Revelation is who you are in God
[48:15] who you are in Christ that's the
[48:17] Revelation that wins the
[48:23] victory brother B says
[48:27] I'm only saying this not to mix up
[48:28] Doctrine but to straighten it out that
[48:31] you might get away from this fear and
[48:34] scare you don't know who you are you're
[48:38] not going to be but now you are the sons
[48:40] of God Amen see you always were the sons
[48:44] of God see for for when God had you in
[48:47] his thinking at the beginning you have
[48:49] to be some part of you your life that's
[48:51] in you now had to be with God before
[48:54] there well when he before he even become
[48:57] material on Earth before there was
[48:58] anything but God you were one of his
[49:01] attributes he knowed what your name
[49:03] would be he knowed the color of hair you
[49:05] would have he knowed all about
[49:09] you is that the truth yeah is it true
[49:13] about you amen not just it's true
[49:15] because I read it not just true because
[49:17] brother bam said it that we know that's
[49:19] true that's a given he's been Vindicated
[49:21] we have faith in that it's true but the
[49:23] reality has to strike home that's true
[49:25] about me
[49:27] be before there was a molecule before
[49:30] there was Stardust before there was a
[49:31] speck of anything I was part of God Amen
[49:34] and that Revelation is what the
[49:36] spiritual Amnesia has to break all of us
[49:38] to bring us back in contact with so that
[49:40] we're not always afraid of everything we
[49:43] face in
[49:46] life turn with me to Ephesians chapter
[49:52] 3 listen friends this message came to
[49:54] set us free
[49:56] this message came to put us back in our
[49:58] position that's right this message came
[50:01] to break the spiritual
[50:04] Amnesia
[50:06] amen oh praise be to God amen
[50:14] amen I find so many
[50:19] times I find so many times that we're
[50:23] sitting

[54:14] which passes knowledge that you might be
[54:16] filled with all the fullness of God now

[54:21] abundantly above all that we ask or
[54:23] think according to the power that

[54:57] amen that you being rooted and grounded
[54:59] in love like listen we have to stop
[55:01] looking at physical things that's right
[55:05] and look at what faith
[55:07] sees
[55:10] amen this is Paul writing this do you
[55:13] believe Paul was a mighty warrior of
[55:17] God do you know Paul was beaten several
[55:21] times he was beaten with rods he was
[55:24] beaten with
[55:25] whips the historians believe that he was
[55:27] beat in his back so his back laid bare
[55:30] and beaten with with rods and with
[55:32] stripes so many times that he walked
[55:36] hunched over because of the scar tissue
[55:38] on his
[55:40] back do you know that he had a thorn in
[55:43] his flesh that was a limitation
[55:45] physically brother Brenham alluded to
[55:47] the fact that it was a problem with his
[55:49] eyesight and he had to have people write
[55:50] letters for him
[55:52] and you know he was rejected and Cast
[55:54] Away and got so one time he didn't even
[55:57] have a coat for the upcoming winter was
[55:59] asking a friend to bring his
[56:02] coat so here's half blind hunched over
[56:07] beat up beat down rejected Paul you know
[56:10] what he is he's a mighty
[56:13] warrior he's an overcomer he's defeating
[56:16] the devil not by his outside appearance
[56:20] and not by the circumstance where is
[56:22] that mighty warrior that's overcoming
[56:23] the devil in his AE he's in jail
[56:26] yes sir he's in prison yes right what
[56:29] the mighty warrior that God was send in
[56:31] that age to help his children overcome
[56:33] the one who would be the example for all
[56:34] the church ages the one who would write
[56:36] the New Testament that all of us would
[56:37] grain strength from the one that the
[56:39] prophet of the end time would turn us
[56:40] back to the teachings of Paul where is
[56:42] that mighty warrior that's defeating the
[56:44] Devil he's in
[56:46] jail he's cold and he wants his coat and
[56:48] everybody's left him all alone and
[56:50] forsaken
[56:53] him we got to stop looking at the
[56:56] outside quit looking in the mirror but
[56:58] look in this mirror and find out who we
[57:00] really are because we are the children
[57:02] of God where is Christ he's in
[57:07] you amen so we need to be that Christ
[57:11] May dwell in your hearts by faith that
[57:14] you being rooted and grounded in love
[57:18] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[57:19] reveal his love for you that's right
[57:22] amen remember we heard it Wednesday his
[57:25] love is a
[57:27] the fact that he chose you before the
[57:29] foundation of the world that you're part
[57:30] of him that's his love and his love
[57:32] can't fade it can't change it's constant
[57:34] it's unchanging and just like our
[57:36] brother Andre was saying on Wednesday it
[57:38] just thrilled my heart to hear him say
[57:39] it and when you were doing the right
[57:42] thing God didn't love you more when you
[57:43] were doing the wrong thing he didn't
[57:44] love you less because God's love doesn't
[57:47] change we have old Armenian ideas about
[57:50] God's love going up and down we're going
[57:52] up and down God's staying constant his
[57:55] promise is constant his love is constant
[57:58] what he thinks of us is constant it's
[58:00] not changing our minds our emotions
[58:03] ourselves are all over the place so we
[58:05] feel like a Son of God we don't feel
[58:07] like a Son of God brother Bram had a
[58:09] question somebody said to him one time
[58:10] brother Bram sometimes I don't feel like
[58:12] I'm saved brother B said sometimes I
[58:14] don't feel like I'm
[58:16] saved but I'm not saved based off my
[58:19] feelings I'm saved by faith in God's
[58:21] promised
[58:22] word it's by faith you are saved
[58:26] and that's a
[58:30] GI so now in Ephesians he wants to root
[58:34] you and ground you in his elective love
[58:37] so that you have a foundation in his
[58:39] love so you're not tossed all over the
[58:41] place because his love is not changing
[58:42] if he ever loved me he always loves
[58:47] me praise
[58:49] God and you being rooted and grounded in
[58:51] love may be able to
[58:54] comprehend so you might comp
[58:56] comprehension is based off my
[58:59] understanding of God's election
[59:01] amen you understand that we have to be
[59:04] rooted and grounded in love that we may
[59:07] comprehend amen yeah I want to know God
[59:11] but you don't know who you are and you
[59:12] don't know how much he loves you right
[59:15] is that right I just whacked this thing
[59:17] right off my
[59:19] ear it's what happens when a fly flies
[59:22] in your ear while you're preaching you
[59:24] get in a fight with yourself
[59:28] so
[59:30] God is trying to root and ground Us in
[59:34] his elective love so that we have a
[59:37] foundation in his love so we can
[59:42] comprehend I wonder if sometimes we're
[59:44] trying to comprehend the bread and
[59:47] length and depth and height what is the
[59:49] breath and length and depth and height
[59:51] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[59:53] the message that been delivered to us
[59:55] and we're trying to comprehend the
[59:57] height and depth and length and breadth
[59:58] we're trying to comprehend all of that
[1:00:00] and how are we trying to comprehend it
[1:00:02] amen we're trying to comprehend it with
[1:00:03] no Foundation of election and
[1:00:05] predestination and we keep getting
[1:00:07] confused and we keep wondering and we
[1:00:08] keep doubting about ourselves we got to
[1:00:10] come back he wants you rooted and
[1:00:12] grounded in his elective
[1:00:14] love that you can be able to comprehend
[1:00:18] the with the Saints what is the breath
[1:00:19] and length and depth and height and to
[1:00:21] know the love of Christ which passes
[1:00:24] knowledge that you might be filled with
[1:00:26] all the fullness of God now unto him
[1:00:28] that is able to do exceedingly
[1:00:30] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:00:32] think according to the power that
[1:00:34] worketh in
[1:00:39] US unto him be
[1:00:42] glory in the church amen that's where he
[1:00:47] wants to be glorified in us that's where
[1:00:50] he wants to show his glory show his
[1:00:52] might that's where he's working
[1:00:53] abundantly he's working in
[1:00:57] us praise be to
[1:01:00] God shamgar had to get a deeper
[1:01:05] Revelation he had to have the spiritual
[1:01:07] Amnesia broke
[1:01:09] off and he needed to believe he
[1:01:12] was it's true and I
[1:01:17] can as long as he didn't believe he
[1:01:20] could he
[1:01:23] couldn't but when he believed he could
[1:01:25] he could
[1:01:28] yeah as long as Saul and the armies of
[1:01:30] Israel believed they couldn't then they
[1:01:33] couldn't but God brought a little
[1:01:34] Shepherd boy who believed he could
[1:01:37] yeah and because he believed he could he
[1:01:40] could
[1:01:42] amen Hey listen there's billions of
[1:01:45] people on the Earth who don't believe
[1:01:46] they can and they
[1:01:49] can't they can't be God's representation
[1:01:52] they can't be Christ manifest on the
[1:01:54] earth they can't be the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:55] Jesus Christ because they don't believe
[1:01:57] they can they
[1:01:58] can't amen and listen that that's that's
[1:02:02] what's so sadome sometimes about even
[1:02:04] those that we fellowship with and go to
[1:02:06] church for years with and sit and listen
[1:02:08] to the preaching of the word because
[1:02:09] they don't believe they can be bride
[1:02:11] they
[1:02:12] can't it doesn't mean they're not
[1:02:14] predestination is predestination but
[1:02:16] they can't move into the promise they
[1:02:18] can't move into the realities they can't
[1:02:20] seem to grasp aold amen of what God has
[1:02:23] done for us and have overcoming faith
[1:02:25] and overcoming power because they don't
[1:02:27] believe they can
[1:02:28] be but oh God break the Amnesia off of
[1:02:32] us and open our eyes so that we realize
[1:02:34] who we really
[1:02:36] are who we really are and what the
[1:02:38] promise really is and it's true and I'm
[1:02:41] part of it and I
[1:02:43] can not because I have ability nothing
[1:02:46] has to change in ability what has to
[1:02:49] change is revelation because God has
[1:02:51] already provided everything we need to
[1:02:53] overcome amen shamgar had the the ox go
[1:02:56] that's all he
[1:02:58] needed listen if he didn't have an ox
[1:03:00] goat and he had a pitchfork he would the
[1:03:02] one with the
[1:03:03] Pitchfork he went with what he had what
[1:03:06] did David go with that Saul tried to arm
[1:03:08] him Saul tried to get him a little bit
[1:03:10] better Theology and you know brother B
[1:03:12] expains I tried to get him a helmet and
[1:03:13] armor and and he got him all looking
[1:03:15] like a warrior and he said I can't do
[1:03:17] this I've never proved any of this he
[1:03:19] went the way he was he went himself he
[1:03:23] went a Shepherd boy amen
[1:03:27] but this Shepherd boy had an anointing
[1:03:28] on him from a prophet to be a
[1:03:31] king and he had an experience with God
[1:03:33] On The Backs side of the desert and he
[1:03:35] knew who he was and he knew the promise
[1:03:37] of God and he knew this was an
[1:03:39] uncircumcised Philistine and I'm a
[1:03:41] circumcised
[1:03:42] Israelite it's all he needed to
[1:03:45] know there was a whole lot of things he
[1:03:47] didn't
[1:03:48] know yes sir how long is the fight going
[1:03:51] to take what is it going to be how will
[1:03:53] he die I don't know if God showed him in
[1:03:54] a vision or not he may have known
[1:03:56] but he didn't have to
[1:03:59] know amen they could have asked him a
[1:04:01] whole bunch of questions and he could
[1:04:02] have answered I don't know to a slew of
[1:04:05] questions but that didn't change
[1:04:07] anything in who he was and where his
[1:04:09] faith was he overcame by faith let's
[1:04:12] turn to First John
[1:04:18] together first John chapter 4
[1:04:31] we've been through the scripture many
[1:04:33] times but it has impact on me every time
[1:04:35] I read it and I want it to have a
[1:04:38] greater impact
[1:04:40] amen first John
[1:04:44] 4:17 hearing is our love made perfect
[1:04:47] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:04:48] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:04:52] this world
[1:04:54] Amen that means
[1:04:56] I'm like
[1:04:57] him in this
[1:05:00] world that's where our love is made
[1:05:01] perfect that's what gives us boldness in
[1:05:03] the day of judgment because as he is so
[1:05:05] are we in this
[1:05:07] world that's a tremendous
[1:05:10] Revelation Verse 18 there is no fear in
[1:05:14] love but perfect love cast out fear
[1:05:17] because fear have torment he that fearth
[1:05:20] is not made perfect in love amen we love
[1:05:23] him because he first loved us
[1:05:26] this Revelation comes right back to
[1:05:28] election again he loved me before the
[1:05:31] foundation of the world he didn't love
[1:05:32] me when I gave my heart to him he didn't
[1:05:34] love me when I did nice things he loved
[1:05:36] me before the foundation of the
[1:05:38] world he loved me because he chose me he
[1:05:40] loved me because I'm part of him he
[1:05:42] loved me and his Love's never
[1:05:45] changing and so
[1:05:47] now this is what makes our love perfect
[1:05:51] this Revelation that as he is so am I in
[1:05:54] the world
[1:05:55] and then with that revelation of love I
[1:05:59] love him because he first loved me so
[1:06:00] this is elective love on display and a
[1:06:03] revelation of what he's called me to be
[1:06:05] and that love cast out fear amen because
[1:06:08] fear have torment you realize telling
[1:06:11] yourself not to be afraid is not
[1:06:14] working whistling in the graveyard is
[1:06:17] not
[1:06:18] working I mean you know and and talking
[1:06:22] big doesn't work
[1:06:24] either we try to sound like we're not
[1:06:26] afraid as hopes that maybe we won't be
[1:06:29] afraid but it doesn't work what cast out
[1:06:32] fear is perfect
[1:06:34] love what is that perfect love that
[1:06:36] perfect love is based off a revelation
[1:06:38] that as he is so am I in the world and
[1:06:40] we love him because he loved me first
[1:06:42] this is his election and this is my
[1:06:44] position and election and position
[1:06:47] brings us into the reality of Love That
[1:06:50] Will cast out fear this is what shamgar
[1:06:52] came to listen don't tell me shamgar
[1:06:55] wasn't afraid
[1:06:56] don't tell me when he heard the troops
[1:06:58] coming Trump Trump trump every year to
[1:07:01] come don't tell me he wasn't afraid you
[1:07:03] can't tell me Gideon wasn't afraid when
[1:07:04] he was behind the wine press threshing
[1:07:06] out a little bit of wheat to have a
[1:07:08] little bit of grain for the year you
[1:07:10] can't tell me he wasn't afraid amen he
[1:07:12] was afraid but what began to change the
[1:07:14] circumstance what began to change his
[1:07:15] fear when he realized what God thought
[1:07:17] of him when he realized God loves you
[1:07:21] God's chose you you're you're a chosen
[1:07:23] vessel of God and he's with you and he's
[1:07:24] going to be in you and he's going to
[1:07:25] work the victory through you and all of
[1:07:27] a sudden he wasn't afraid anymore and
[1:07:29] and brother B tells us shamgar wasn't
[1:07:31] afraid he went out there amen he was
[1:07:33] ready to fight and he wasn't afraid does
[1:07:35] there any sign of fear in David's voice
[1:07:37] when David's talking to Saul when he's
[1:07:39] running out to the battle and Goliath
[1:07:41] starts laughing and mocking at him is am
[1:07:43] I a dog that you come at me with sticks
[1:07:45] and you little boy I'm going to I'm
[1:07:47] going to cast your I'm going to put you
[1:07:49] on my beam and and set you up for the
[1:07:50] birds to eat your flesh and and those
[1:07:52] are those are nasty things amen and this
[1:07:54] is a big dude saying it with a big
[1:07:58] spear you know somebody starts talking
[1:08:00] to you like that in the Walmart parking
[1:08:02] lot with a spear that's 9 foot long he
[1:08:04] me you you
[1:08:08] know you look at him you look at his
[1:08:10] muscles you look at his Spear and you
[1:08:13] look at
[1:08:16] you but there's no sign of fear in David
[1:08:20] yeah cuz David had a
[1:08:22] revelation right
[1:08:26] listen that the doctor can tell you
[1:08:28] whatever he tells you amen you can't
[1:08:32] stop human emotion human emotion's human
[1:08:34] emotion but when that Revelation hits it
[1:08:37] changes
[1:08:39] everything when that Revelation is I'm a
[1:08:41] Child of God and his word is true and
[1:08:43] the promise is true I'm holding on to
[1:08:45] the promise and all of a sudden fear
[1:08:48] starts to take Wings you can't push it
[1:08:50] out by being a bully that's right you
[1:08:52] can't override it by talking tough
[1:08:55] but the when the Revelation begins to
[1:08:57] settle in wait a minute God's word
[1:08:59] hasn't changed in the last five minutes
[1:09:02] when I just heard that that all of a
[1:09:04] sudden I have this terrible terrible
[1:09:06] thing that they're talking about that
[1:09:08] news didn't change God's predestinated
[1:09:10] plan for my life that news didn't change
[1:09:13] who I am that news didn't change the
[1:09:15] Bible that news didn't change the
[1:09:17] promise I'm sticking with the
[1:09:20] word and love cast out fear
[1:09:25] amen when brother Benham comes and he
[1:09:28] preaches the seventh seal when he gets
[1:09:30] to the seventh seal he starts talking
[1:09:32] about the third pool and I'm going to
[1:09:33] talk about that just briefly for a
[1:09:35] minute and and he's in the seventh St
[1:09:37] he's preaching he says and just then he
[1:09:39] picked me up he's going back to the
[1:09:40] vision uh of the three pools and back
[1:09:43] now he's to the part where the big tent
[1:09:45] is and he took me up and set me way up
[1:09:48] high to where I a meeting was going on
[1:09:50] looked like a tent or Cathedral of some
[1:09:52] sort and I looked and there was a little
[1:09:54] box like little place over in the side
[1:09:57] and I seen that light was talking to
[1:09:59] somebody above me that light that you
[1:10:01] see there in the picture it Whirled away
[1:10:03] from me like that and went over to that
[1:10:05] tent and said I'll meet you in there and
[1:10:07] said this will be the third pool so he's
[1:10:11] tying the tent Vision the little room in
[1:10:13] the tent and the little box he's tying
[1:10:15] it together with the third pool and he
[1:10:17] says this will be the third pool and you
[1:10:19] won't tell it to nobody amen then he
[1:10:22] goes to Sabino Canyon in the Sabino
[1:10:24] Canyon he just just a short time before
[1:10:26] he's preaching this amen just a month or
[1:10:29] I think a month before he's in Sabino
[1:10:31] Canyon praying and he's got his hands up
[1:10:33] and a sword strikes his hand and when
[1:10:35] that sword strikes his hand he looks at
[1:10:37] it and it's real he's holding in his
[1:10:39] hand said it just fit his hand it was
[1:10:40] glistening and he had all these thoughts
[1:10:42] about it but God told him he said that's
[1:10:44] the king
[1:10:46] sword and here's what brother B said
[1:10:48] that it talk goes back to the tent to
[1:10:50] the little room and he says I'll meet
[1:10:51] you in there this will be the third pool
[1:10:54] and you won't tell it to nobody and in
[1:10:55] sainia Canyon he said this is the third
[1:10:58] pool amen so there's no question about
[1:11:01] what the third pool is the third pool
[1:11:03] amen what whatever the tent was in the
[1:11:06] little room and people going in the tent
[1:11:08] amen and the angel of the Lord being
[1:11:10] there that Pillar of Fire being in there
[1:11:11] was the same thing that happened in
[1:11:13] Sabino Canyon when the sword hit his
[1:11:15] hand that will be the third pole this is
[1:11:18] the third
[1:11:19] pool amen so we don't need to question
[1:11:23] what the tent is in the little room it's
[1:11:24] the third
[1:11:26] pull he's showing it in symbol form just
[1:11:29] like the sword is symbol form just like
[1:11:32] the tent in little room and the pillar
[1:11:33] of fire and people going symbol form so
[1:11:36] don't get hung up on the symbols again
[1:11:40] seven seal he still I'm still reading he
[1:11:42] says the voice shook down through there
[1:11:44] and Rock The Rocks it's the sword of the
[1:11:46] king and then I come out of it the sword
[1:11:48] of the king not if it said a sword of a
[1:11:51] king but it said the sword of the king
[1:11:53] and there's only one the king and that's
[1:11:55] God and he has one sword that's his word
[1:11:58] that what I live by that so help me God
[1:12:02] standing over this holy desk here with
[1:12:04] this holy word laying here it's the
[1:12:07] word amen so what is the third pull it's
[1:12:10] the word it's the opening of the word
[1:12:13] it's the word coming into the hands of
[1:12:15] the prophet and he said it just it's the
[1:12:17] king's sword and we know that the sword
[1:12:19] of the spirit is the word of the Lord
[1:12:21] amen and it just fit my hand so it's the
[1:12:23] word coming to the prophet of the hand
[1:12:25] the hand of the Prophet so that he can
[1:12:28] dish it out and give it out to the bride
[1:12:30] amen so we know that the third pool is
[1:12:32] the word and in the in Sab again it's
[1:12:34] the word coming to the hand of the
[1:12:36] Prophet but the third pool was also
[1:12:38] people lined up around the corner going
[1:12:41] into a little room one by one and coming
[1:12:43] out on the other end different than they
[1:12:45] came in amen amen so don't be afraid to
[1:12:48] let the symbols amen be symbols and
[1:12:50] don't let the third pull amen don't
[1:12:52] don't make it simplistic don't don't
[1:12:55] fail to miss what God's trying to show
[1:12:56] us under this third pool Ministry am and
[1:13:00] and if I I'm going back to 1956 and I'm
[1:13:03] going to read to you the in February of
[1:13:05] 1956 the first time brother bam talks
[1:13:07] about this
[1:13:09] vision and he says there was a nice
[1:13:11] smooth spoken gentleman stepping out and
[1:13:14] said now while brother branham's
[1:13:15] arresting a little bit we'll line the
[1:13:17] prayer line up I think that's kind of
[1:13:20] interesting while brother bren's resting
[1:13:22] a little bit we'll line the prayer line
[1:13:25] line up said you all with prayer cards
[1:13:27] beginning at a certain place line up to
[1:13:29] my right and so I looked over that would
[1:13:31] be to my left from where I was standing
[1:13:33] and there was a little building sitting
[1:13:35] in there little building that's built
[1:13:37] like that and all the people were old
[1:13:39] just looked like went around the tent
[1:13:41] and out a city block or more a great
[1:13:43] line of people they were all standing
[1:13:45] around there with their prayer card just
[1:13:47] when I seen a woman in an ambulance
[1:13:49] stretcher was laying and a man behind
[1:13:51] her was standing on crutches so they
[1:13:54] were standing there waiting for their
[1:13:55] turn there was a lady taking down their
[1:13:57] names and things and and then there was
[1:14:00] a canvas stretched here and no one could
[1:14:02] get around that
[1:14:03] tent and just then now I want you to
[1:14:06] watch this and listen now it listen how
[1:14:09] it is now so you watch the difference
[1:14:12] then I heard something whip around a
[1:14:14] were were were like that always going
[1:14:17] every time we have a healing service
[1:14:18] that's just what happens that's the way
[1:14:20] it has always sounded sounded that way
[1:14:23] in the bush that time when I heard it
[1:14:24] it's always been that way and I felt it
[1:14:26] I heard it rather going moving and I
[1:14:28] looked and here went that real soft
[1:14:31] light moving away from me and went down
[1:14:33] and went into that little building and
[1:14:35] there's a there's something different
[1:14:38] between the light and the angel cuz he
[1:14:40] was still here with me and that light
[1:14:41] had went into the building and this
[1:14:43] Angel still speaking behind me which is
[1:14:45] a big man he said I will meet you in
[1:14:47] there so then I said I don't understand
[1:14:50] why in there he said watch and this
[1:14:53] woman when she come out of there there
[1:14:55] an ambulance stretcher she was pushing
[1:14:57] the stretcher out the other side so he
[1:15:00] had seen her in the vision standing
[1:15:02] there on an ambulance stretcher going in
[1:15:05] and he watched her come out the other
[1:15:07] side and she was pushing the stretcher
[1:15:08] and walking yeah
[1:15:13] amen goes on to say and the lady the
[1:15:16] lady asked her what happened she said I
[1:15:20] don't know it just happened amen she
[1:15:25] said' I've been in this stretcher said
[1:15:26] I've been down in bed for years and here
[1:15:28] come the man out packing his crutches
[1:15:30] and they asked him what said he said he
[1:15:34] he said he didn't know and he was coming
[1:15:36] to the platform to testify and I said I
[1:15:38] don't understand that in there and I
[1:15:41] watched he's now watch he's always
[1:15:42] scripture he said did not our Lord say
[1:15:44] when you thou prayest be not like the
[1:15:46] Hypocrites that make a show enter into
[1:15:48] the secret closet and when you've done
[1:15:51] so close the door then pray to your
[1:15:53] father which seeth in secret and he that
[1:15:54] see in secret shall reward thee openly
[1:15:57] he said you remember that name that you
[1:15:59] were hunting that time you dreamed about
[1:16:01] said yes he said I'll meet you in there
[1:16:03] and this time it won't be a public Show
[1:16:06] and The Vision left
[1:16:08] me amen I just love these
[1:16:12] things because to me they become more
[1:16:15] and more real all the time we've talked
[1:16:18] about them for years we've looked at
[1:16:19] them and we've looked at them with
[1:16:21] confusion we've looked at them with
[1:16:22] misunderstanding and still today I don't
[1:16:24] know that I can completely understand
[1:16:25] everything that he said but it's
[1:16:27] becoming more of a more of a reality
[1:16:30] that that is the third pole he said that
[1:16:33] will be your third pole and you won't
[1:16:34] tell to nobody and Sabino can and the
[1:16:37] sword in his hand this is your third
[1:16:38] pull so whatever that is and whatever
[1:16:40] the sword is is linked together in the
[1:16:42] third pool amen it has something to do
[1:16:45] with the with the pillar of fire Christ
[1:16:48] himself in that little room and people
[1:16:50] going in one way and coming out hole the
[1:16:52] other way oh my I think think that the
[1:16:55] third pole has something to do with the
[1:16:57] word coming to the prophet and that word
[1:16:59] coming to the prophet brings us into an
[1:17:01] individual introduction to Jesus Christ
[1:17:04] the same way Paul met him amen spiritual
[1:17:07] union he met him as a pillar of fire on
[1:17:09] the road to Damascus and now that
[1:17:11] presence was in that room and they went
[1:17:12] in one by one this isn't church this
[1:17:15] isn't group this isn't family this is
[1:17:17] you coming in contact in the third pool
[1:17:20] with Christ himself The Living Word of
[1:17:23] God and when you meet Christ in the
[1:17:25] little room amen it's not a public show
[1:17:28] amen it's not anything somebody can copy
[1:17:30] it's not anything that even anybody can
[1:17:32] explain it's not to be replicated it's
[1:17:34] not to be a formula it's to be a living
[1:17:37] reality inside of you that you have come
[1:17:39] in contact with the person of the third
[1:17:41] pool which is the word that has been
[1:17:43] restored in this
[1:17:44] hour and it changes you everybody in
[1:17:49] that line is Afflicted with some sort of
[1:17:51] Affliction crutches and wheelchair and
[1:17:53] all of that but they come out and and
[1:17:54] she's pushing the the wheelchair the man
[1:17:57] in the crutches doesn't need his
[1:17:58] crutches anymore amen listen don't think
[1:18:02] physical think
[1:18:04] spiritual if you're looking for the
[1:18:06] third pool to produce a prayer line
[1:18:08] where people don't need crutches and
[1:18:10] wheelchairs anymore listen God has
[1:18:12] already done that he did that in the
[1:18:13] first and second pole that's not the
[1:18:15] third pull the third pole goes deeper
[1:18:17] than flesh the third pole is fixing your
[1:18:20] spiritual condition the afflictions
[1:18:22] through the soul what was holding us
[1:18:24] back where the Holy Ghost have been
[1:18:25] bound by these denominational Rivers for
[1:18:27] all this time but is loosed in the
[1:18:29] evening time by the evening time message
[1:18:31] the Holy Ghost backing the people your
[1:18:34] spiritual condition that came through
[1:18:35] the church AE and den nomination and
[1:18:37] man's ideas and all kinds of confusion
[1:18:40] is under this third pool going to be
[1:18:44] [Applause]
[1:18:46] healed brother brenon went through the
[1:18:48] third pool do you believe that yes do
[1:18:51] you believe he was in a little room all
[1:18:53] by himself when the angel came to him
[1:18:54] every day amen said I've been alone in
[1:18:58] that little
[1:19:02] room and he come out on the other side
[1:19:05] and he said my Bible's a new
[1:19:07] book something changed in him
[1:19:10] spiritually he was the same stature he
[1:19:13] was still baldheaded he was still 50
[1:19:15] some years
[1:19:16] old he would go on to say uh uh I'm
[1:19:20] getting old now that brother gave me a a
[1:19:22] cane looks like I'm going to have to use
[1:19:23] it now after after the seals he says I
[1:19:25] wake up and you always got a new pain a
[1:19:27] new Creek and new that he still had a
[1:19:29] nervous condition he still got the blues
[1:19:31] he still had tension he still got
[1:19:34] depressed so the third pole is not
[1:19:37] fixing all of your natural problems
[1:19:39] you're still living a natural life the
[1:19:41] third pole is fixing your spiritual
[1:19:43] problem it's fixing the soul it's
[1:19:46] bringing you back into what God always
[1:19:48] meant for you to be a son or daughter of
[1:19:50] God it's Awakening what woken shamgar
[1:19:53] what was awakened David amen under the
[1:19:55] anointing of this prophetic Ministry
[1:19:57] it's bringing you to the realization of
[1:19:59] who you are and what you're destined for
[1:20:01] you're anointed to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:03] Christ you're anointed to be the queen
[1:20:05] that sits with him and rules and
[1:20:09] Reigns and now will I'm coming into that
[1:20:11] position I know who I am I know where
[1:20:14] I'm at I know the word that's promised
[1:20:16] to me and if I face Goliath I can face
[1:20:19] Goliath because I know who I am amen
[1:20:22] that's the amen not because when I come
[1:20:25] to this Revelation all my problems went
[1:20:29] away listen my problems didn't go
[1:20:34] away you
[1:20:36] know
[1:20:38] still sometimes wake up and limp in the
[1:20:42] morning because I got a stiff heel and
[1:20:44] there's a tendon that's
[1:20:46] whatever and you know you just keep
[1:20:48] walking because you know it'll work
[1:20:49] itself
[1:20:51] out still have all kinds of things that
[1:20:54] happen in life life still listen the the
[1:20:57] the meeting of Christ in the little room
[1:21:00] when Christ is revealed personally to
[1:21:02] you that's right it doesn't take all
[1:21:04] your problems
[1:21:06] away it gives you the ability to
[1:21:09] overcome every
[1:21:11] problem it gives you strength
[1:21:14] establishes you and Roots you and
[1:21:16] grounds you in
[1:21:17] love so that you might know the the
[1:21:20] height and depth and breadth and width
[1:21:23] of this revelation
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:27] that he might do a mighty
[1:21:29] work in
[1:21:31] you that's what the purpose of the third
[1:21:33] pool is and because he wants to show
[1:21:35] himself Mighty and he wants to overcome
[1:21:37] and he wants to overcome in you like he
[1:21:39] did shamgar like he did David then guess
[1:21:41] what's going to happen to you all kinds
[1:21:44] of problems sir piles and piles of
[1:21:48] problems tons and tons of
[1:21:52] trouble why cuz greater is he that's in
[1:21:55] you than he that's in the world and he's
[1:21:57] going to prove it he's going to manifest
[1:22:00] it he's going to prove it he's going to
[1:22:01] show there's a people that'll stay with
[1:22:03] my word there's a people who won't back
[1:22:05] down from the promise there's a people
[1:22:07] regardless of the circumstances will
[1:22:08] still say God is good I know the truth
[1:22:11] and I'm pressing
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:14] on Amen almighty god brother BM says in
[1:22:19] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:22:20] says you know now you see the seals now
[1:22:23] you see the seals
[1:22:25] when he was in his mediatorial work back
[1:22:26] there redeeming but someday he comes
[1:22:28] forth to get this book that he's
[1:22:30] redeemed and all that's in the book
[1:22:32] would be
[1:22:35] him so it's the Lamb's Book of Life all
[1:22:38] that's in the book is
[1:22:42] him then he goes on to say all that's in
[1:22:45] the book would be him do you believe
[1:22:47] that amen am everything that's in that
[1:22:49] book of redemption is him then he says
[1:22:52] for that's the believer the words in the
[1:22:55] book
[1:22:56] am the book I thought everything written
[1:22:59] in the book was him but yet the words in
[1:23:01] the book is
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:05] me oh does 2 + 2 equal
[1:23:10] 4 what brother B said when he's sitting
[1:23:12] in the woods and he's got his little
[1:23:14] tablet he's waiting there and the spirit
[1:23:15] begins to move and all a sudden it's
[1:23:16] like this 2 plus 2 equal 4 2 plus it
[1:23:19] gets louder 2 plus 2 = 2+
[1:23:21] 2 I love the way he says that he may
[1:23:24] have grabed just anything that come to
[1:23:25] his mind he may have used just any
[1:23:27] analogy but the analogy is giving you a
[1:23:30] proper conclusion that this plus this
[1:23:33] equals this right this plus this equals
[1:23:37] this if everything in the book is himym
[1:23:40] and the Believers is the word in the
[1:23:41] book then what are the
[1:23:43] Believers 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4
[1:23:49] 2 + 2 = 4 2 + 2 = 4 and tell brother bom
[1:23:54] jumps up and runs and runs and runs
[1:23:56] around the tree because 2 plus 2 equals
[1:23:58] 4 and now we know who we are and why we
[1:24:01] cannot lose it has nothing to do with my
[1:24:04] mind my temperament my abilities uh my
[1:24:06] experiences who I grew up with what my
[1:24:09] name is has nothing to do with that it
[1:24:11] has everything to do with the fact that
[1:24:13] I'm one of the words in the book and all
[1:24:16] that's in the book is him and he cannot
[1:24:18] lose
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:24] praise
[1:24:25] God this is how we overcome not the
[1:24:29] delusional idea that if I'm a bride of
[1:24:32] Christ everything I say is going to make
[1:24:34] everything better and I'm going to have
[1:24:35] power and with that power I'm going to
[1:24:37] make sure I never have a problem again
[1:24:39] and the refrigerator breaks and I smack
[1:24:41] it and it comes working again and my car
[1:24:43] breaks down I said no no not today
[1:24:45] listen friends you're going to pay a
[1:24:48] mechanic you're going to buy a new
[1:24:52] refrigerator it's not a illusional
[1:24:54] Pentecostal idea it's the reality of
[1:24:56] overcoming overcoming what adversity
[1:24:59] overcoming everything Satan's Eden can
[1:25:01] throw at the bride she'll overcome not
[1:25:04] by power not by might but by thy Spirit
[1:25:06] sayeth the Lord by a revelation that God
[1:25:09] is in me working through me if I can
[1:25:11] just hold steady and stay with the
[1:25:13] promise God is going to work a
[1:25:16] victory what happens is fear sets in and
[1:25:19] under fear we are doing all kinds of
[1:25:21] crazy
[1:25:21] things but if we could just have an
[1:25:24] Awakening of real faith and Hold Steady
[1:25:28] and remember who we are and remember
[1:25:30] what he promised and remember the hour
[1:25:33] we live in and remember where he's
[1:25:36] working and just say I don't know
[1:25:39] how I have no idea how but it's going to
[1:25:42] work out for the glory of God we will
[1:25:45] overcome this
[1:25:47] situation amen not because I have the
[1:25:50] faintest idea how it's going to
[1:25:52] work but it can't fail because his word

[1:26:30] secret and now oh I love when he amen he
[1:26:34] pointed back to what happened at the
[1:26:36] resurrection of Jesus Christ but he
[1:26:37] didn't leave it there that's the problem
[1:26:40] every denominational teaching leaves it
[1:26:42] 2,000 years ago but not then
[1:26:46] now but now God by his holy spirit has
[1:26:50] broke the seal from around our lives
[1:26:54] and Christ is revealed as he lives in

[1:27:05] him you know what we need we need a
[1:27:07] revelation of Jesus Christ amen that's

[1:27:20] because that's what the message came to
[1:27:22] show us yes sir amen is where he would
[1:27:25] be in the end time when the head comes
[1:27:27] and unites with the
[1:27:29] body that he would be in her amen that's
[1:27:34] the Revelation that we need
[1:27:36] friends we need to
[1:27:38] realize that by the Holy Spirit he has
[1:27:40] broke to seal from around our lives and
[1:27:43] Christ is revealed as he lives in US
[1:27:49] amen what Resurrection seal is broke
[1:27:51] this time the seal that was around my
[1:27:54] life that veiled my understanding the
[1:27:57] Amnesia seal the denominational seal the
[1:28:01] human seal the the mental
[1:28:03] seal was broke from around my life so
[1:28:07] that I could see
[1:28:09] Christ revealed that's right in me
[1:28:18] am praise
[1:28:20] God then brother Brenham sings a song We
[1:28:24] shall rise Hallelujah we shall rise amen
[1:28:29] when death's bars are broken we shall
[1:28:31] rise Hallelujah we shall rise and listen
[1:28:33] to what he says aren't you glad I'm so
[1:28:36] glad Way Back Down Yonder in a little
[1:28:38] old Coal Shed one morning the seals were
[1:28:41] broken and I raised with him a new
[1:28:46] creature brother BR know when the seal
[1:28:48] broke for him but as the seal broke for
[1:28:51] you that's right not I don't mean the
[1:28:53] break breing of the seal to understand
[1:28:55] that God sent a prophet and that there's
[1:28:57] a message know sir but a further
[1:29:00] breaking of the seal where the seals
[1:29:02] broke from your life and you see Christ
[1:29:05] revealed as he lives in you to where you
[1:29:09] come to the great Revelation at the end
[1:29:11] time Christ in you the hope of
[1:29:15] glory brother benam says in the message
[1:29:17] adoption from 1960 when he's coming to
[1:29:20] preach adoption he says this this is the
[1:29:22] first part of adoption says Bible
[1:29:25] teaching is usually a little treacherous
[1:29:27] a little you know kind of walking out on
[1:29:30] thin ice we call it but we just feel
[1:29:32] that maybe at this point at this time it
[1:29:35] might be good to kind of bring the
[1:29:36] church to what I think is a complete
[1:29:39] understanding positionally of what we
[1:29:41] are in Christ Jesus what's he preaching
[1:29:43] adoption ad positional placing of sons
[1:29:47] and he says now I think we need to come
[1:29:49] to a complete understanding positionally
[1:29:52] of what we are in Christ and some
[1:29:54] sometimes I think that preaching is a
[1:29:55] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[1:29:57] brother beer that teaching goes beyond
[1:29:59] that especially to the church now
[1:30:01] preaching usually catches The Sinner
[1:30:02] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:30:05] word but teaching places a man
[1:30:08] positionally what he
[1:30:11] is what he is in God's mind yeah
[1:30:17] amen teaching places a man positionally
[1:30:19] what he is now listen to The Nest
[1:30:22] statement and we can never never rightly
[1:30:24] be able to have faith until positionally
[1:30:27] we know what we
[1:30:30] are what gave David the faith to
[1:30:32] overcome positionally he knew what he
[1:30:34] was well gave shamgar the victory I mean
[1:30:37] the power of Victory positionally he
[1:30:38] knew what he was that's what gave
[1:30:40] brother brandom the power to go and do
[1:30:42] the things that he had to do that's what
[1:30:43] gives you and I the power to overcome is
[1:30:45] when we position we have faith because
[1:30:47] positionally we know who we
[1:30:50] are listen I Know Who I Am by natural
[1:30:53] birth
[1:30:55] I I understand it you know I I know my
[1:30:58] parents I lived with them I talked to
[1:31:00] them they show me the pedigree I've got
[1:31:02] my document from the hospital I know
[1:31:04] where I am by that birth but that hasn't
[1:31:05] done me a bit of
[1:31:09] good that's caused all my
[1:31:14] problems but I need to know who I am by
[1:31:16] another birth certificate by the Lamb's
[1:31:19] Book of Life birth certificate I need to
[1:31:21] know who I really am so that I can
[1:31:25] overcome the
[1:31:27] trials amen I want to I want to close
[1:31:30] out and just look at job for a minute as
[1:31:31] we finish up here if you can turn with
[1:31:34] me to the Book of Job
[1:31:42] please praise God
[1:31:51] Almighty in the Book of Job
[1:31:54] we're going to go to chapter one we're
[1:31:56] going to start right at the
[1:32:04] beginning Job chapter
[1:32:07] 1 verse
[1:32:11] 6 now there was a day when the sons of
[1:32:14] God came to present themselves before
[1:32:15] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[1:32:18] and the Lord said unto Satan whence
[1:32:20] comest thou then Satan answered the Lord
[1:32:23] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:32:26] earth and from walking up and down in it
[1:32:28] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[1:32:30] considered my servant job that there is
[1:32:32] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[1:32:34] upright man one that feareth God and
[1:32:37] esth Evil just pause for a minute God
[1:32:41] calls him
[1:32:43] perfect a perfect man that means he's
[1:32:46] come to the stature of a perfect
[1:32:49] man just watch our types this is an Old
[1:32:51] Testament type he says perfect means
[1:32:54] fully mature or
[1:32:56] complete so he's come to the stature of
[1:32:58] a perfect
[1:33:00] man and the Lord said unto
[1:33:03] him uh said unto Satan hast thou
[1:33:05] considered my servant job that there is
[1:33:07] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[1:33:08] an upright man one that feareth God and
[1:33:11] esth Evil then Satan answered the Lord
[1:33:13] and said do job fear God for not Hast
[1:33:16] not Thou made a hedge about him and
[1:33:18] about his house and about all that he
[1:33:19] hath on every side thou has blessed the
[1:33:22] work of his hands and his substance
[1:33:23] increased in the
[1:33:25] land but put forth thou thine hand now
[1:33:28] and touch all that he hath and he will
[1:33:30] curse thee to thy face and the Lord said
[1:33:32] unto Satan behold all that he hath is in
[1:33:34] thy power only upon himself put not
[1:33:37] forth thine hand so Satan went forth
[1:33:39] from the presence of the
[1:33:41] Lord and
[1:33:44] so I don't know about you but if God was
[1:33:47] having that discussion about
[1:33:49] me when he said he's a perfect and
[1:33:51] upright man oh man
[1:33:54] you know your heart would be
[1:33:56] glowing your feet would be lifting off
[1:33:58] the ground this is what God is
[1:34:01] saying and then when Satan says yeah I
[1:34:03] know but but it's because you blessed
[1:34:05] him I would look at Satan and be like
[1:34:07] shut
[1:34:11] up but he says you know just touch his
[1:34:15] life take all his stuff and he'll curse
[1:34:18] you you know if you were listening to
[1:34:20] that conversation is about you you'd be
[1:34:21] like tell him no
[1:34:25] God tell tell him
[1:34:29] no and God says go
[1:34:33] ahead that was the whole point from the
[1:34:35] beginning
[1:34:38] yeah you remember
[1:34:41] when Wednesday when brother Andreas said
[1:34:44] that we always look at silence when the
[1:34:46] father's silent is a negative but when
[1:34:48] the father silent is a
[1:34:49] positive job was getting ready to enter
[1:34:52] into the trial of his life
[1:34:54] and God was not going to speak to
[1:34:57] him no vision no dream no Audible Voice
[1:35:02] nothing in fact all of his feelings were
[1:35:05] going to go the opposite
[1:35:06] direction he was going to go through the
[1:35:08] trial of his life and God was going to
[1:35:11] speak to
[1:35:13] him and we realize by reading the
[1:35:15] scripture and understanding that first
[1:35:18] God allowed Satan to to afflict him and
[1:35:22] he lost all of his wealth he lost all of
[1:35:23] his camels all of his donkeys all of his
[1:35:26] sheep all of his servants and all of his
[1:35:30] children in one
[1:35:32] day and one day he lost
[1:35:36] everything and in verse 20 let's look at
[1:35:41] chapter 1 verse 20 after he lost
[1:35:44] everything says then job arose and rent
[1:35:46] his mantle and shaved his head and fell
[1:35:48] down upon the ground and
[1:35:52] worshiped water response
[1:35:55] friends you know why he worshiped
[1:35:57] because he was a perfect man and upright
[1:36:01] yeah this is the way we're supposed to
[1:36:06] act
[1:36:07] amen he fell down upon the ground and he
[1:36:09] worship and said naked came I out of my
[1:36:11] mother's womb naked shall I return there
[1:36:14] the lord gave and the Lord hath taken
[1:36:15] away blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:36:18] amen and all this job sin not nor charge
[1:36:21] God foolishly
[1:36:25] amen it's very evident by the story that
[1:36:28] God was not angry with
[1:36:31] job he was not punishing
[1:36:34] job he he in no way was mean angry upset
[1:36:40] job had not done anything
[1:36:44] wrong
[1:36:46] actually if we can wrap our minds around
[1:36:49] it God was proud of job
[1:36:53] amen right and God thought a lot of
[1:36:56] job and he let the worst trial of his
[1:36:59] life come upon him because he was proud
[1:37:01] of him and he thought a lot of him and
[1:37:04] he knew what was in
[1:37:08] him you see how carnal thinking is never
[1:37:10] going to win the
[1:37:11] day carnal thinking will derail us every
[1:37:14] time friends cuz every time our life
[1:37:16] starts to unravel and fall apart and we
[1:37:18] have a series of events in our life that
[1:37:20] keep taking us down we keep thinking
[1:37:22] Lord what's wrong with me where am I
[1:37:23] wrong why are you angry with me what
[1:37:24] have I done wrong if you just show me
[1:37:26] I'll fix it just show me I'll fix it
[1:37:27] just show me I'll fix it and there's
[1:37:30] nothing wrong with that prayer we should
[1:37:31] search Our Lives there's nothing wrong
[1:37:33] with that but in reality because bad
[1:37:36] things happen doesn't mean because
[1:37:37] you've done something wrong it does not
[1:37:39] mean God's angry there's a very good
[1:37:41] chance that when really bad things
[1:37:43] happen to you that God's actually kind
[1:37:45] of proud of
[1:37:47] you and he knows what's inside of you
[1:37:50] and he knows that he can manifest
[1:37:52] himself in you through this somebody
[1:37:55] else couldn't do it they may collapse
[1:37:57] they may say something wrong they may
[1:37:59] they may bring a reproach but not
[1:38:02] you sometimes people say things like you
[1:38:05] know they get they get a diagnosis the
[1:38:06] doctor will say you've got heart disease
[1:38:08] you've got cancer and you say you you
[1:38:10] say say the the first thing pops out of
[1:38:12] mind why me God why did you let this
[1:38:15] happen to
[1:38:17] me I mean that's not bad question I
[1:38:19] don't even think God gets angry at that
[1:38:21] so don't misunderstand me we live a
[1:38:22] human life
[1:38:23] with human
[1:38:25] emotions amen we say why
[1:38:28] me listen we if we stop and think for a
[1:38:30] minute you say who else would I rather
[1:38:33] him put this
[1:38:35] on my brother my sister and my
[1:38:38] spouse if somebody has to carry this
[1:38:42] burden why do I wish it on somebody
[1:38:46] else
[1:38:48] amen why
[1:38:50] me why why' you let this happen to me
[1:38:53] why me
[1:38:54] me somebody's got to overcome all of the
[1:38:57] devil's tricks
[1:39:00] amen and maybe it's you because he knows
[1:39:03] that you won't lose faith that you'll
[1:39:06] keep believing that you'll keep pressing
[1:39:08] that's right and he knew this about Job
[1:39:11] brother Brenham says in Victory Day says
[1:39:13] now remember God has counted you worthy
[1:39:16] when you have a test now don't fail this
[1:39:19] to get this when you have a trial or a
[1:39:21] test that shows the grace of God has
[1:39:23] found you you found favor with
[1:39:27] God the Lorden thank you God thank you
[1:39:31] for telling me the truth yeah thank you
[1:39:33] for reminding me of the truth you know
[1:39:35] this isn't the first time you and I have
[1:39:36] heard it but every time we hear it it
[1:39:38] does something for us because the the
[1:39:40] devil's lying to us all the time our
[1:39:41] minds are lying to us circumstances are
[1:39:43] lying to us and we have to constantly be
[1:39:45] brought back in contact with God's truth
[1:39:47] that's not his disapproval that's right
[1:39:50] right he says listen he says when you
[1:39:53] have a trial or a test it shows the
[1:39:55] grace of God has found you you found
[1:39:58] favor with God and God believes that you
[1:40:00] can stand the test remember he's never
[1:40:03] done anything to to you to destroy you
[1:40:05] he's only putting it on you to declare
[1:40:06] his glory through you amen so that he
[1:40:08] can manifest himself through
[1:40:11] you and that he can show himself to you
[1:40:14] and show himself to others through
[1:40:16] you and and he goes on to say he says
[1:40:19] remember he did the same thing by job
[1:40:21] Satan said oh yes I see job down there
[1:40:24] God said he's a perfect servant there's
[1:40:25] none in the earth like him there's
[1:40:27] nobody like job he's a perfect man now
[1:40:30] he's my pride and
[1:40:33] joy I don't know about you but this is
[1:40:35] not how I've pre treated my pride and
[1:40:39] joy because man's thoughts are not as
[1:40:42] high as God's
[1:40:45] thoughts Satan said oh sure he gets
[1:40:48] everything he asked for said let me have
[1:40:50] him once said I'll make him curse you to
[1:40:52] your very faith face said I'll just make
[1:40:54] him curse you God said he's in your
[1:40:56] hands but don't you take his life God
[1:41:00] had confidence in
[1:41:02] J listen when the devil told God when
[1:41:05] when God told the devil hey have you
[1:41:07] thought about job have you considered
[1:41:09] him he's perfect there's none like
[1:41:11] him and and the devil says it's just
[1:41:14] because you put a hedge of protection
[1:41:15] around him you you let me touch him
[1:41:17] and'll curse you to his face you know
[1:41:20] God didn't
[1:41:22] say okay okay and God didn't say oh I
[1:41:25] hope job makes
[1:41:29] it you can touch him you can afflict him
[1:41:31] just don't God was not worried God was
[1:41:34] not nervous God was not upset God was
[1:41:38] not biting his nails hoping that job
[1:41:40] made it
[1:41:41] through God knew what was in him God
[1:41:44] knew what he built him for God knew what
[1:41:45] he could do he knew better than job knew
[1:41:48] and God knows better than you know he
[1:41:50] knows better than I know sometimes we go
[1:41:52] through things we think that are
[1:41:54] absolutely breaking us to bits there's
[1:41:56] times that the pressure is so great and
[1:41:58] sometimes it's not physical pressure
[1:41:59] it's emotional pressure is so great that
[1:42:01] we think we're absolutely going to break
[1:42:03] and snap and collapse under this
[1:42:05] pressure and we say things to God like
[1:42:06] God I can't take anymore I can't take it
[1:42:09] I'm falling to pieces amen that's just
[1:42:11] our own perspective from our human realm
[1:42:13] but God was never once worried about you
[1:42:15] falling to pieces and not making it and
[1:42:17] collapsing he knew you would come
[1:42:19] through and if something has to be broke
[1:42:21] out of you then it's going to be broke
[1:42:22] out of you but you're going going to
[1:42:24] overcome when the lessons is learned
[1:42:26] when what has to come out comes out
[1:42:28] you're going to come out of the trial
[1:42:29] because he always knew you would there's
[1:42:31] nothing taking God by
[1:42:35] surprise so he
[1:42:38] says God had confidence in job when he
[1:42:40] looks like everything has gone wrong God
[1:42:43] is giving you a trial he's got
[1:42:45] confidence in you he don't have to baby
[1:42:47] you around you're not a hot bed plant a
[1:42:49] hybrid you're a real Christian God is
[1:42:52] giving you a test SE what you'll do
[1:42:53] about it to see what you'll do about it
[1:42:55] amen no wonder Peter said these fiery
[1:42:58] trials which counted Joy it's more
[1:43:00] precious to you than gold and many times
[1:43:03] we hum and haul and oh well well that
[1:43:06] well that's something God give you to
[1:43:08] overcome he knows you'll do it he's put
[1:43:11] his trust in you
[1:43:13] amen oh God let that Revelation change
[1:43:17] me because listen friends a trial is
[1:43:20] always going to end it's going to end
[1:43:23] you're you're it's going to be a
[1:43:24] different day you're going to come out
[1:43:25] of it on the other end you're going to
[1:43:27] go through you're going to learn
[1:43:28] something you're going to manifest
[1:43:29] something you're going to demonstrate
[1:43:31] something you're going to come out on
[1:43:32] the other end and when you come out on
[1:43:33] the other end you're going to kick
[1:43:35] yourself and feel like a heel for all
[1:43:36] the things that you said while you're in
[1:43:38] there so let's catch a revelation right
[1:43:40] now and say next time God puts trust and
[1:43:43] confidence in me I'm not going to
[1:43:45] complain I'm not going to Grumble I'm
[1:43:47] not going to accuse God foolishly what
[1:43:49] I'm going to do is say God if you give
[1:43:51] me strength and you believe can go
[1:43:53] through this Lord just direct my steps
[1:43:55] guide me one step at a time show me how
[1:43:58] to overcome by your word and manifest
[1:44:00] your life in me now I Surrender oh I
[1:44:04] surrender to your will I Surrender Lord

[1:47:07] material Goods lost his
[1:47:10] children but then when that didn't work
[1:47:12] he worshiped God Satan comes back before
[1:47:16] God
[1:47:18] again and you know Satan didn't mention
[1:47:22] to God that job was doing
[1:47:26] good he didn't go back and give a report
[1:47:28] you know job he he's
[1:47:31] unbreakable no he just was quiet he
[1:47:34] presented himself before God again he's
[1:47:36] probably hoping the subject wouldn't
[1:47:37] come
[1:47:39] up cuz God said have you considered him
[1:47:42] try him touch
[1:47:44] him and he was so confident if you let
[1:47:47] me do this I'll curse you do and it
[1:47:48] didn't happen I'm pretty sure he didn't
[1:47:50] want God to mention it again yeah in the
[1:47:53] next
[1:47:54] meeting he comes up and and you know
[1:47:58] everybody's reporting you know we're
[1:48:00] just

[1:48:43] his
[1:48:45] life you talk about mind
[1:48:48] battles job had to go through mind
[1:48:50] battles you know later in the book job
[1:48:53] he begins to express some of those mind
[1:48:54] battles he said he begins to express and
[1:48:57] what's he expressing I have no idea what
[1:48:59] God's doing I don't know why this is
[1:49:02] happening he gets he gets three really
[1:49:04] nice buddies who come to him to comfort
[1:49:07] him you know God provides everything you
[1:49:10] know even the brothers and sisters who
[1:49:12] say the wrong thing at the right time
[1:49:14] for the right reason because it's the
[1:49:16] wrong thing but it's the right thing
[1:49:18] it's all wrong but it's still
[1:49:21] right praise Lord
[1:49:23] does that ever happened to you somebody
[1:49:24] come along to try to comfort and console
[1:49:26] you and everything they said was
[1:49:29] wrong but somehow it's still right in
[1:49:33] God's plan yeah right that's why you
[1:49:35] can't even be bitter towards them God's
[1:49:37] just trying to work something out in us
[1:49:38] and demonstrate something in US amen
[1:49:40] there's no reason to be bitter and hurt
[1:49:42] and upset at everybody else who's ever
[1:49:43] done us wrong God allows everything to
[1:49:46] happen in our life for a reason he wants
[1:49:48] to display himself he wants to mold us
[1:49:50] he wants to make us he wants to break us
[1:49:51] he wants to train us wants to form us
[1:49:53] let God do his work quit being bitter at
[1:49:56] everybody who said something about
[1:49:59] you all you're doing is just destroying
[1:50:02] your own testimony by suling and
[1:50:04] bitterness and hurt and they hurt me
[1:50:07] yeah they hurt you everybody's been hurt
[1:50:09] but it was somebody in the church yeah

[1:50:22] did it cross God's desk or

[1:54:31] way God doesn't do this to his children
[1:54:33] God doesn't allow these hard trials God

[1:55:17] helpful have you considered that maybe
[1:55:19] you did this wrong and this wrong and

[1:55:23] that job says I am not a sinner sir and
[1:55:27] job is not saying I've done everything
[1:55:29] perfect job is not saying I have no air
[1:55:32] brother brandham said job was looking at
[1:55:34] the sacrifice God's required word for
[1:55:36] that day was that I slay an innocent
[1:55:39] lamb to cover my sins I slayed the lamb
[1:55:42] not only for myself but for my children
[1:55:44] I have no sin not because I haven't done
[1:55:47] anything wrong but because I met God's
[1:55:49] requirement and God was so proud of that
[1:55:52] no matter what he went through and no
[1:55:53] matter what he was accused of he stood
[1:55:56] fast on the word for his day the
[1:55:58] revelation of his day was the same
[1:56:00] revelation God showed in Eden that a
[1:56:02] lamb will cover your sins and he slayed
[1:56:04] the lamb his sins were covered and he
[1:56:06] had faith in God's
[1:56:09] word and God was so pleased with job
[1:56:12] because job never deviated from that
[1:56:14] Revelation
[1:56:16] whatsoever job didn't know what was
[1:56:18] going on he was confused about why it
[1:56:20] happened he began to say things that
[1:56:21] even God told him he shouldn't have said
[1:56:23] saying God's being unfair with me he
[1:56:25] should have never said that but he never
[1:56:27] doubted the word of God he never
[1:56:29] compromised on the word he never stepped
[1:56:31] back on the promise that if I do what
[1:56:33] God says I'm doing I have no
[1:56:37] sin God loved him because he stood with
[1:56:41] the
[1:56:43] word amen job didn't have everything
[1:56:45] right he didn't say everything
[1:56:47] right but God was pleased because he
[1:56:50] stayed with the word
[1:56:53] amen
[1:56:57] oh Amen brother B
[1:57:00] says and the message look from 63 he
[1:57:03] said job when even all of his friends
[1:57:07] had turned him down everything was wrong
[1:57:09] job kept looking towards the sky some of
[1:57:12] them said you're a secret sinner you're
[1:57:13] look you're you're looking job what are
[1:57:15] you looking up that way for because
[1:57:17] you've done sin God has done proved what
[1:57:20] he's done to you you're a secret sinner
[1:57:23] job knowed he wasn't a sinner he had met
[1:57:25] exactly every word god required that
[1:57:28] burnt sacrifice that burnt offering was
[1:57:31] all God asked for now listen friends are
[1:57:34] you
[1:57:35] listening God only asked for the burnt
[1:57:38] offering and job knowed he had made the
[1:57:40] burnt offering
[1:57:43] sacrifice God only asked you to believe
[1:57:46] his
[1:57:48] word not to live perfect not to never
[1:57:50] make a mistake not to have up ups and
[1:57:52] downs what is God asking you to believe
[1:57:54] his word and what is that word it's the
[1:57:57] bleeding bloody word that washes you
[1:57:59] from all your sins and washes you and
[1:58:00] cleanse you from The Prostitute spirits
[1:58:03] of these denominations and makes you
[1:58:05] clean and virtuous and pure virgin bride
[1:58:08] of Jesus Christ what is it the washing
[1:58:10] of the water of the word he's not asking
[1:58:12] you for perfect conduct he's asking you
[1:58:14] to believe his
[1:58:16] word God only ask you to believe his
[1:58:19] word amen he don't ask all these isms
[1:58:21] and Creeds and and everything else he
[1:58:23] asked you to believe
[1:58:26] him
[1:58:28] am listen it's perfectly okay to say I
[1:58:32] have no idea why this is happening sure
[1:58:34] you know sometimes in our spiritual
[1:58:36] immaturity we try to be spiritually
[1:58:38] mature yeah so when travesty happens or
[1:58:41] tragedy travesty is the wrong word my
[1:58:44] family informed me of that I've used it
[1:58:46] wrong several times and God knows how to
[1:58:50] fix Pride
[1:58:53] thank you I love you
[1:58:59] all it's so
[1:59:02] sad that we can so quickly be derailed
[1:59:05] off of the word and feel like I've done
[1:59:08] wrong God's mad at me but all those
[1:59:11] things happen God's just asking us to
[1:59:13] take him at his
[1:59:15] word I called you my bride believe it I
[1:59:19] sent a prophet to call you out believe
[1:59:21] it I told you what I think of you
[1:59:23] believe it I told you I chose you before
[1:59:26] the foundation world just receive it
[1:59:28] just stay with it just don't change
[1:59:30] don't go up and down don't go back and
[1:59:32] forth don't alter anything just say I
[1:59:35] believe
[1:59:36] it what's happening to you I don't
[1:59:39] know you know we used to say well this
[1:59:43] is happening because of this because I
[1:59:45] said that and did this and God's doing
[1:59:47] this and God God's trying to do
[1:59:48] something with my neighbor and God's
[1:59:49] trying to do something with my
[1:59:50] co-workers and it's like how do do you
[1:59:52] know
[1:59:53] that that was spiritual immaturity
[1:59:55] trying to act like we were spiritual
[1:59:57] mature trying to give an explanation for
[2:00:00] every trial we go through well maybe
[2:00:02] this is happening for the medical
[2:00:04] staff
[2:00:06] maybe maybe
[2:00:07] not it could be maybe not we don't have
[2:00:11] to have answers let's get beyond having
[2:00:14] to have answers because what we do is we
[2:00:16] start manufacturing
[2:00:17] answers we don't need any answers God
[2:00:20] can do with us whatever he choos to do
[2:00:22] because what he does is perfect and with
[2:00:24] a purpose and the reason that we're on
[2:00:26] this planet is to manifest him
[2:00:29] regardless of what we think about it
[2:00:31] what God does is perfect what God allows
[2:00:33] is right what God predestinated for us
[2:00:35] to overcome is exactly what we're going
[2:00:38] to overcome because he predestinated
[2:00:41] it so we don't have to have answers job
[2:00:44] got to the place he says he works on my
[2:00:46] right but I can't find him behind me I
[2:00:47] don't know where he's at I have no idea
[2:00:49] what's happening to me
[2:00:52] actually as we close let's read that I
[2:00:53] wasn't going to read it I try to shorten
[2:00:55] stuff and be good and all that stuff but
[2:00:58] let's go to back to
[2:01:01] job I just can't help it it's too good

[2:01:30] order my cause before him and fill my
[2:01:32] mouth with arguments I would know the
[2:01:34] words which he would answer me and
[2:01:36] understand what he would say unto me
[2:01:38] will he plead against me with his great
[2:01:40] power no but he would put strength in me
[2:01:44] if I could just talk to him he would
[2:01:45] strengthen me there the righteous might
[2:01:48] dispute with him so should I be
[2:01:49] delivered forever from my judge
[2:01:52] behold I go forward but he is not there
[2:01:54] and backward but I cannot perceive him
[2:01:56] on the left where he does work but I
[2:01:58] cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on
[2:02:00] the right hand that I cannot see him but
[2:02:03] he knoweth the way that I take and when
[2:02:06] he hath tried me I shall come forth as
[2:02:09] goldone my foot hath held his steps his
[2:02:13] way have I kept and not declined neither
[2:02:15] have I gone back from the Commandment of
[2:02:17] his lips I have esteemed the words of
[2:02:19] his mouth more than my necessary food
[2:02:22] where was job where did job get to job
[2:02:25] got to the fact where I wish I could
[2:02:26] talk to him I wish I could ask him if I
[2:02:28] did he would strengthen me he would
[2:02:29] deliver me I know he loves me but I
[2:02:31] don't know he's working here I can't
[2:02:33] perceive it he's on my right I can't see
[2:02:35] it behind me I don't know where he's at
[2:02:37] I'm completely confused to why this is
[2:02:39] happening but one thing I know for sure
[2:02:41] is he knows the way that I take I don't
[2:02:43] know what's happening but he knows
[2:02:45] what's happening in my life and when I
[2:02:47] am tried I shall for come forth as gold
[2:02:50] why because I've help held his word more
[2:02:53] than my necessary meat I've loved his

[2:04:03] always know what's happening in their
[2:04:05] life I did this so God allowed this and
[2:04:08] this and this and they make you feel
[2:04:09] like a
[2:04:10] heel because you're going through all
[2:04:12] kinds of trouble and you don't know
[2:04:15] why and if you did something wrong you
[2:04:17] don't know because you've asked God and
[2:04:18] he hasn't showed you anything so all you
[2:04:21] know to do is keep moving forward and
[2:04:22] believing his
[2:04:24] word but they say well this happened to
[2:04:26] me but it was because my cooworker
[2:04:27] needed and my wife and then blah blah
[2:04:29] blah blah
[2:04:31] blah the end of the day they don't know
[2:04:34] right but they just don't want to say I
[2:04:37] don't
[2:04:39] know job was to the point where he said
[2:04:42] I I haven't got a
[2:04:43] clue you asked me hundreds of questions
[2:04:46] I don't have the answer the only thing I
[2:04:47] know is I haven't left the
[2:04:50] word yes amen you say I'm this and you
[2:04:54] say I'm that and you give me examples
[2:04:55] and you come around and you tell it
[2:04:57] again and you try to convince me listen
[2:04:59] they were what were they doing they were
[2:05:01] trying to get him to lose his hold of
[2:05:03] the
[2:05:04] word by
[2:05:07] reasonings by fleshly things by things
[2:05:09] he could see but he held fast to the
[2:05:12] promise of the word listen the devil and
[2:05:16] sometimes friends and coworkers they're
[2:05:17] going to try to get you to lose your
[2:05:19] grip on the word maybe in the devil will
[2:05:21] come in year well maybe it's not for you
[2:05:23] it seems to work out for everybody else
[2:05:24] it's not working out for you listen just
[2:05:27] go read job okay the next time he tells
[2:05:29] you that that's not
[2:05:33] true why was why was Peter hung upside
[2:05:38] down and persecuted in prison why was
[2:05:40] Paul chased from City to city and beaten
[2:05:43] multiple times stoned left for dead
[2:05:46] Shipwrecked cast out of cities why was
[2:05:49] that because he was wrong because he
[2:05:51] sinned CU he didn't believe the word cuz
[2:05:54] he wasn't Bri listen friends let's read
[2:05:57] the Bible and come in contact with the
[2:05:58] real
[2:06:00] reality God is proving himself he's
[2:06:04] doing it through us he sent a message to
[2:06:06] open our eyes to the truth because the
[2:06:08] truth will make us
[2:06:10] free because the truth will root us and
[2:06:13] ground Us in love amen and perfect love
[2:06:16] will cast out
[2:06:19] fear to me that's why why the message
[2:06:22] came so that I could pass through
[2:06:26] whatever God's allowed me to pass
[2:06:27] through but I could do it with the right
[2:06:29] attitude and I can never let go of this
[2:06:31] word help me God to never let go of this
[2:06:34] promised word this
[2:06:37] message God bless you let's all stand
[2:06:40] musicians if you please
[2:06:44] come the next time somebody says what's
[2:06:47] going on you can say I don't know
[2:06:52] why do you think this is happening I
[2:06:54] have no
[2:06:56] idea and before they say anything to you
[2:06:59] you might just be better off saying and
[2:07:00] you don't
[2:07:05] either but I'll give you the short
[2:07:08] answer God allowed
[2:07:11] it does he have to correct me quite
[2:07:15] likely is he trying to teach me
[2:07:16] something probably is he trying to
[2:07:19] display something yes probably is he
[2:07:22] trying to manifest himself in some way
[2:07:24] to somebody else likely could be all
[2:07:27] could be some I don't know but I know
[2:07:31] this he knows the way that I tell and
[2:07:34] when I am tried I shall come forth as
[2:07:35] gold because I have determined that this
[2:07:38] message is more than my meat more than
[2:07:41] life to me and I'm never letting go of
[2:07:44] it praise God let's bow our heads
[2:07:47] together dear heavenly father we thank
