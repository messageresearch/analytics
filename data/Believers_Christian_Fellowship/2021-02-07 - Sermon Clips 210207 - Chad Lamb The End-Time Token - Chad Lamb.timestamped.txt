[0:00] it's not about getting every conduct
[0:02] right amen it's an
[0:03] attitude it's an approach amen it's an
[0:05] understanding of what's been given us in
[0:07] this day
[0:07] that word is christ amen how can i want
[0:10] christ to dwell in me
[0:11] when i will not even surrender to christ
[0:14] the message of the hour that was
[0:15] preached through a prophet
[0:16] when he says women don't cut your hair
[0:18] and i cut my hair and don't wear makeup
[0:20] i wear makeup amen those things seem
[0:22] like simple things but they're huge in
[0:23] the eyes of god
[0:24] because it shows where your heart is
[0:26] amen because when you start to ask well
[0:28] what does it matter and why and how long
[0:30] is long and all these questions
[0:31] all you're doing is saying i want you
[0:33] but i want you as long as i can have
[0:35] some of me
[0:38] that's the real problem the real problem
[0:41] with the question is how long
[0:42] is long amen is not the question how
[0:44] long is long and because the holy ghost
[0:46] will reveal to you how long is long
[0:48] the real question is is how much of
[0:50] myself can i bring into this
[0:52] relationship
[0:54] so we think like these seem like trivial
[0:56] issues why is it trivial when brother
[0:58] branham preaches all through 63
[1:01] 64-65 because he's showing
[1:03] you want christ but you want christ
[1:05] according the way cain wanted christ
[1:07] according to his own will amen but you
[1:09] don't come to this word
[1:10] trying to hold on to your own idea amen
[1:13] your own desires and your own will
[1:15] but you come to this word not
[1:16] legalistically like if i don't cut my
[1:18] hair and don't wear makeup he'll give me
[1:20] the holy ghost that's not what he's
[1:21] talking about
[1:23] he's talking about a full surrender to
[1:24] the full word of god
[1:26] an absolute acknowledgement of who is
[1:28] here
[1:29] who is present amen it's not a message
[1:32] of brother branham this is jesus christ
[1:34] amen
[1:35] and if it's just brother brethren's
[1:37] message it's subject to my
[1:39] opinions and my alterings and my
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] see the whole problem with with dress
[1:46] and
[1:47] attitude and conduct and dirty jokes and
[1:49] and
[1:50] watching worldly movies and all that
[1:52] stuff listen friends it has nothing to
[1:54] do with that
[1:54] it's not like if i can cut out all the
[1:56] worldly movies and wear my hair right
[1:58] and dress right i'm going to get the
[1:59] holy ghost
[2:00] that's not it but it displays your
[2:02] attitude towards jesus christ
[2:10] i hope that strikes home because we've
[2:13] made it too much about the hair
[2:15] and about the makeup and about the
[2:17] movies and about that
[2:18] it's not about that it's about your
[2:20] heart and no condition to receive him
[2:23] until you hate it all amen until you're
[2:26] willing to give it all up amen
[2:28] i hate amen i hate any desire that i
[2:31] have that's contrary to the word i hate
[2:32] it amen
[2:33] i want it going i want it washed out of
[2:35] me because all i want
[2:36] this word is so beautiful it's so
[2:38] magnificent this message is so perfect
[2:41] that's the only thing that i want and i
[2:42] want everything else to go away
[2:44] [Music]
[2:46] you may not yet have the strength or the
[2:47] capacity to make it go away but there
[2:49] sure ought to be a desire
[2:51] not not ought to be there must be a
[2:53] desire in you
[2:54] amen for all of it to be gone and just
[2:56] that word to live in me
[2:58] that's coming with the right approach
[3:00] that's the right attitude amen that's
[3:02] the right desire
[3:03] and when you come to god that way all
[3:05] you have to do is ask for your father
[3:06] for the holy spirit he'll give it to you
