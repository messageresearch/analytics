Lord do you believe that the Holy Spirit changes things amen amen is good to be in the house of the Lord could we just by our hearts father we just want to thank you this morning and we believe that your holy spirit is definitely in our midst and that's what our heart long for Lord that when we come to the services we come to church we know that there's a promise where two or three are gathered in our name you will be in our midst and that's what we come oh God to hear from you and be into your presence because in your presence things happen things change in your presence that's why we want to enter ourself content into just like the holiest of holies where there is life there's nothing artificial everything is real because it's your presence and then that brings the change and we remember the scripture that how Aaron didn't put a rod in there that Rod was dead but yet when it got into your presence it brought a resurrection it brought life and that's the same thing with us Lord sometimes we can feel dead we can feel down we can feel depressed we can have many things going on in our hearts in our lives but if we can just get back into your presence it'll bring us a Revival back down into our soul so that we can have a clearer understanding of the challenges and to face things that we have to face in this day and time so Lord as we go into your word we pray that you just give us understanding and you just open our hearts to receive and uh do we can be drawn closer to you father as the words of Life Goes Forth so we commit everything through your hands not now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we go to Exodus chapter 3. and we pray the Lord be with brother Chad plus they're having some wonderful service I think in the Philippines and uh it's a privilege to be here this morning and uh in Exodus chapter 3 we'll go to verse 5. he said draw not hither put off thy shoes for off thy feet for the place wherein thou standards is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction on my people which are in Egypt and I've heard they'll Cry by reason of the attached Masters for I know their sorrows I really like that scripture God said for I know their sorrows he know their sorrows he knows our sorrows amen in verse 8 and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land that you're a good land into a large into a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the High Tides amorites parasites and the High bikes and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is coming to me and I have also seen the oppression which the Egyptians oppressed them verse 10 come down therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt amen you may be seated in this verse of scripture here I'm taking this uh when the prophet of God preached the Third Exodus when he began to look into the scripture he said when God said I come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and then he said in verse 10 come therefore and I will send thee he said God said I'll come down but Moses I'm sending these so what is it God going in the form of a man can we say praise the Lord amen so this morning if the Lord would help us I want to just take a thought on the the characteristics and conditions of a Third Exodus that's what we would like to minister on Amen and uh I appreciate brother Sergey I don't know where he at where you at brother yeah God bless you brother I appreciate it driving me down he drove to he's pretty fast but we made it brother so amen we just had a good Fellowship last night with the Brethren and the omniscient Saints uh really just enjoy sharing the word of the Lord but we're here this morning I pray that you just remembering me in your prayers yesterday the enemy really tried to bother me in my eye a little bit there but by God grace we just keep pressing on amen now uh I want to uh read a quote here this coming from the message the Third Exodus and uh he says excuse me he said we are in an exodus no let's go this isn't a message to Third Exodus he said the first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land he said the second Exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter and he I like how he put it same pill of Fire by the same anointed system the same God doing the same things and the same word declared the first one declare the second one the same word declared the second one has declared the third one and here we see it amongst us now he said come out oh come out of this chaos come to the Living God come to the word and the Word was made flesh and amongst us and now he's in our flesh dwelling amongst us come out and serve the Living God now he just explained each three Exodus now I want to go and read a scripture and we'll go back into this quote I want to go to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4 and we want to go to verse 13. the scripture says in leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast and the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim he said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah's the prophet saying the land of Zebulon and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them what sat in the region in the shadow of death light is sprung up they said from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand now I want to go to first Thessalonians chapter 4. thank you and we'll go to verse 14 very familiar scriptures so for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so dim which uh which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of an unchanging Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead of Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen so if you ever feel uncomfortable and going through something just start thinking about the rapture amen that one day we'll be leaving here by his grace and we have something to look forward to amen now like I said I want to preach on the characteristics and the conditions of the Third Exodus amen and uh I know I won't finish but I just want to maybe hit some highlights and if the Lord would help us there's a lot of things going on and a lot of things happening today but I do believe by the way of the message of the hour God had committed in a way that for us to even understand the Third Exodus we'll have to understand the first and the second then we can understand the third because it's actually it's the same amen but now we want to talk about this morning is characteristics and conditions and I believe it's the Lord will help us we'll see a lot of things that are happening today I think sometimes we see a lot of things happening and going on we get overexcited sometimes and be like wow and so forth but when it comes to the reality of these things there's nothing new Under the Sun everything that's happening now has already happened before so we condensed I might not I'm not preaching nothing different or nothing new things that we literally already know but I guess I could do like Peter said this morning I know that you know these things but I stir your mind up by the way of remembrance because sometimes we forget sometimes praise the Lord that prophecy is being fulfilled into what's happening now like I said there's nothing literally nothing new in front of the sun that's why I'm so thankful we can go back into the Bible go back into the scripture and see what has already been then we can see what is going on now amen that's why Jesus Christ announced himself also in the Book of Revelation he said he which was which is and which is to come it's the same yesterday today and forever and I thank God uh for the pattern of the scriptures like the prophet said in Christ with mystery God revealed when he was speaking about the opening of the seventh seal he said that you know we can study these things how God have revealed himself through the Seven Seals in the lives of Believers and stories and characters he said just look into them things it was all alone the hidden mysteries of God was led to these things still unveiling himself revealing this great Plan of Redemption that's why when we read about Ruth we read about Esther in the book of Jeremiah when we read these things it still is God unfolding himself showing us the pattern and plan that you and I have a wonderful opportunity to see today the bride got it all we see it all it's been given all to us and we thankful that for that because God wants his people to not be tossed and turned with every Farm win and Doctrine he want us to be stable is that right praise the Lord you know uh I was sitting in the uh I do a little bible study back home and and and when I went to go do it we've been on the subject of the mark of the beast and I noticed uh it was a young girl who didn't show up to the Bible study and they they began to explain to me why I said they said she's not here today she's went she went to Kentucky or to Asbury I'm pretty sure y'all don't heard about what's going on at the college up in Asbury they said this Great Big Revival and all these things is taking place and I said so okay so she took off and skipped the Bible study and went there I said I'm not offended about that but you know we have to understand something brothers and sisters the the way they say that is a Revival that is actually not a Revival that's just another move is what that is but in all respect I do believe there there are some people are actually sincere because I watch some of it they actually really are sincere but what they're actually they're thirsting and actually hungry for the Holy Ghost but if you can look at the whole scenery there it's just a bunch of entertainment and it's about your singing because there's no Revival without the opening of the word but in respects I give them respect for that but in my mind they saying how they want the move of God and they want the the Holy Spirit I look at that that's nothing but the foolish virgins because you remember the prophet said when they went to go out to buy the uh that's when the bridegroom comes so all of these things that's happening and I believe God is doing something and those things you and I need to look at that if they crying for the Holy Spirit we need to go back to what the prophet said you got to remember that's where the time when the bridegroom come see people in their mind they say they want the Holy Ghost that's what they say they want but they don't want the word you'll find out if somebody really want the Holy Ghost by giving them the word because then you give them the word they say I don't want to believe that I don't receive I don't receive this well you don't want the Holy Ghost because if you get the Holy Ghost that's what it's going to take you back it's to the word can we say praise the Lord so but I have respect for those things I'm not a Critic some people say oh look at them no I don't I don't do things like that I'm just trying to see look into the what's been prophesied and see what God is doing and what God is actually showing us amen so now one thing about this Third Exodus I might not I might preach it a little different but same Revelation it's just an angle that I was looking at some things or things that happening now doesn't happen and it's it's all nothing new like I said so I might have a little different approach to it but it's the same Revelation amen so we'll understand when we look back what's happening in the first Exodus there's some things that I want to point out because remember before they got in the first Exodus they went from a natural land to a natural land but before they got there it was a Wilderness Journey can we say man and a lot of things happen in the wilderness Journey praise the Lord so that happened before they got into the promised land now the same when Jesus Christ came when Jesus Christ was talking with the disciples they was following him they was walking with him really that was they haven't Jesus having taken them into their land that he came to take them to which was the day of Pentecost but before they got there a lot of things took place before they got there so it was just like when he was with the disciple that was their little portion of a Wilderness Journey can we say Amen praise the Lord now you and I we also know that the promised land today for us is also the baptism of the Holy Ghost we understand that but in the reading the quote you gotta also remember too as he put it in the quote he said that we also been promised uh the the let me just read that to you real right quick for you again so you'll see exactly what I'm saying because I'm not trying to interject nothing but I just want to know he said now he's talking about the Third Exodus now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost that means we already got it can we say man but that's not it's not the complete the journey to where we're going can we say Amen now if you're born again yeah you're in your Promised Land what God had given you but for according to this quote to complete everything listen what he said he said right back to the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter so that let us know that there's more to even come with this can we say amen and we haven't gotten into the Millennium yet we might be born again but we haven't got there yet so that means things still had to happen before we even get there the same as things had to happen before they got the cannon the same thing happened before they got to Pentecost there's some things still gonna have to happen before we get to to fulfillment the fullness of this quote can we say Amen so there's things happen in between we need to see what happened in the past we'll understand what is happening now so in the first Exodus there's many things that was taking place we will find that in the first Exodus there was some uh uh uh laws were introduced Pharaoh has changed his laws he had to make Commandments and did we see that there was pressure on the Believers then we see that there was a prophet then we see it as a focus on children then we see then that first Exodus signs and wonders then we also see in that Exodus the pillar of fire and we also see impersonators had to happen in that Exodus and then I put down most importantly it's the lamb can we say Amen because there's no completion of no Exodus without the lamb without the shedding of the blood there's nothing no complexion can we say Amen so let's just kind of I just want to just kind of talk about these things so what I read in Exodus 3 Matthew chapter four and first Thessalonians is to me it's the three key scriptures of each Exodus amen and we'll go back into these things if the Lord permit amen now he says here uh in the message of Exodus this is not the Third Exodus it's the message called an exodus he said finally there came a time for The Exodus The Exodus means a calling out of the separation it comes a time where God had to separate his people that was in bondage a beautiful type of today is I think the church means to call out and then he says here in the voice of the sun which is a very wonderful quote to me he said The Exodus was at hand and just listen carefully how he put this he said exodus mean to be taken out brought out he said now we find excuse me now we find out that usually just as those joint Crossroads other Exodus the unusual begins to happen amen he said the crossroads of an ex unusual things begin to happen can you see just in the last past years unusual things been happening give me say man well we called them unusual but when we see something happening then we can take it back to the word it's no longer unusual because now we see amen he said unusual begin to happen he's I believe we are there again I believe we're there at The Exodus of the Bride to go meet the bridegroom I believe the Exodus is ahead so now he's talking about the Exodus is to go meet the bridegroom but then when he said in the Third Exodus bringing the completion of the third exit to that great Eternal place of the Millennium so it all Blends in together and there's a lot of things inside of here can we say Amen so now we was going to deal with these things first of all we see in the beginning of the first Exodus hell we see how God was behind everything how God I like how God planned things when God planned something he don't he don't have to rethink it can we say man his thoughts are Eternal and when he lays it out he lays it out and when God lays things out he don't have no counselor with him give me say Amen he's there by himself he lays it all out he lays out his great plan and God just sit and watch how his plan that he had in the backside of his mind just coming to pass amen now um in the first Exodus we understand uh when you go to the third message Third Exodus we find the children of Israel was down in Egypt if you will let's just turn to that scripture Exodus chapter one foreign and we want to go to verse six Exodus chapter 1 verse 6 it said and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation he said the children of Israel was fruitful and their creatures abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceedingly Mighty and the land was filled with them first of all you go back the prophet said why he said if they uh he said it's there in Egypt not in their Promised Land we need to find out what got them down there why did this happen he said why it happened is because they rejected Joseph he said they rejected Joseph which is the spiritual part they reject the spiritual thing that will cause them to be down there in an exodus amen but no we also know it goes even back further than that it goes all the way back even with Abraham because remember God told Abraham your children were so John in a straight country which is not theirs 400 years amen so we know when God speaks something it makes no difference how many years it takes it's going to come to pass once he's spoken it and God man it's already finished so now look at he giving Moses Abraham the promise now God is orchestrating everything for the promise to come to pass I just like that when God promised something he is the great orchestrator he brings everything put it in his place for his promises to come to pass amen so now we see that we're just going to do a little quick little history here we see that Joseph no Joseph typing Christ amen and we see how his Brethren begins to hate him I know you all know the story but we're just going to go over it again we know his brothers begin to hate him they begin to like him because Joseph telling them the things that God showed him and so forth they just didn't like him at all you know they man ain't nothing like nothing too different today in it sometimes you want to talk about some things that Gotham showed you and you just rejoicing sometimes people get mad at you why they get mad at you because ain't nothing happening in their life and you trying to Rejoice what God is doing in your life they get mad at you they shouldn't get mad because the same God that can stir you up it's the same God can stir them up amen but think about it there was nothing Joseph could do to stop his brothers from hating him because there was a promise there was a prophecy God had to get Joseph down in Egypt so nothing that he could do but this I'm just looking at how God just do things and now so we see they get down to Egypt and I know you know the story I'm just saying this fast so I can get to my message we see Joseph he get down to Egypt we know the story the children of Israel was actually in a comfort zone down in Egypt Joseph made sure they had the best amen the Egyptians wouldn't bother them they had the best because Joseph was still alive so now after Joseph died we see now God said I still got to fulfill my promise that they're going to be that 400 years and they're going to be led out with a mighty hand so what happened God had to start make things change to make the children of Israel uncomfortable because if that if pharaoh oh if that first pharaoh never died he still would have had respect to the children of Israel because of Joseph so God had to let him die let a pharaoh come up that didn't know Joseph other words he didn't know Joseph so he said why do I have to respect these people this is our land they are Hebrews they come to our land on our turf hey we're going to do what we want to do with them so God put a spirit of hate upon them to hate the children of Israel and what another purpose what this was for causing them to hate the children of Israel to make the children of Israel cry cry out to God so that's why sometimes things happen in your life God permit things to happen to make you cry to make you pray to make you come closer to him God is I can restrain things also in your life to make this happen can we say praise the Lord now we see down here in the scripture amen I said Joseph died in all his brothers and all that generation that had to happen so God can set everything in motion the way that he wanted it to be amen now let's go to verse 8. am I going too fast we're excited but I can slow down amen verse 8 now that Rose of a new king over Egypt with new not Joseph and we know how to profit uh interprets this he said there had to be like he said just like a new king grew up come up that did not know Joseph he said that's why we got a new king now that don't know the freedom of religion see he's bringing all things in praying that you're our Third Exodus are you following me now just keep following me so now verse nine he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we he began to look around and realize it's a lot of these message Believers out here they're more than we they're mightier than we can we say man Heaven you know the Bride of Jesus Christ is mightier what makes us mightier is Christ in US Christ in his bride that makes us mightier and the devil knows that we are mightier to me say Amen don't you know the devil even though you are more than a conqueror the devil know that but do you know that you got to remember he's a bluff he's a deceiver like I was telling the brother yesterday after the devil sister deceiver to he believe in one God but he get people to believe in three now that's the deal before you right there can we say praise the Lord now so this had to happen they're mightier than we verse 10. he said come on let us deal wisely with them at least they multiply and it come to pass that when they're falling out any War they John also to our enemies and fight against us so let them let's get them up out of the land let's deal wisely with them see the devil is no different today he's dealing wisely can we say Amen he's dealing wisely I'ma tell you there's different kind of way how he's dealing wisely and Lord willing will try to get into some of these things so what happened in verse 11 he said therefore they said over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for ramuses Treasure cities pythons and Ramesses so now we're seeing pressure coming into this situation and they put taskmasters over there so I don't if the devil put pressure upon them in the first Exodus past message over them in the first Exodus he had to do it in the second and he also had to do it in the third that's why pressure and the things that we go through in this day shouldn't Shake us what it should do is mold you pressure should mold you not shake you can we say man because remember God he is the he is the Potter we are the clay can we say Amen but clay and pottery could never be formed without pressure amen the Potter puts the clay sticks it on the wheel the wheel spins he could water on his hand what did he do he get in the clay he squeezing when he squeezed the clay it starts shaping it and it started forming it amen so when you and I are going through things it's nothing but that great Potter got his hands on your life shaping you informing you to what he wants you to be not what you wanted to be but what he wants us to be amen so if pressure in the fresh Exodus pressure in the second Exodus it has to be the same characteristic and conditions and this Exodus and it ain't gonna get no lighter it's going to always be pressure but what pressure should do amen I can say make you better not worse praise the Lord amen verse 12. it says but the more they Afflicted them the more they multiply and grew and they would grieve because of the children of Israel this this chapter is just really my favorite one of my favorite chapters in the Bible I said God let me be like that the mom get Afflicted the more hard times I go through let me grow not decrease amen but let me grow Lord help me grow amen praise the Lord that's the way it's supposed to be and then we see they got offended because the children of Israel was growing so the devil said we need to change attacked it when this when Satan see any of us growing in our spiritual life he would change the tactic on your life to try to stop you from growing he don't care what he got to bring in he don't care who he has to use huh sometimes he can use children mama daddy friend sister he can use them amen he used Joseph's brother can we say Amen what brought David pressure his nephews his family pressure so there's different ways pressure can come but I'm so thankful that when things happen when I believe now brothers and sisters I watched myself out of everything that's happening going on I look for character in people I look how they respond back when something happened how do you respond back what is your reaction to an action can we say man do you believe we're in adoption time what entitles a boy to adoption what the prophet said his behavior his behavior entitles him to an adoption so myself I watched my behavior and I watch the behavior of others then it tells a lot where we're at hello praise the Lord and you're still you've been married 30 30 and 25 and 20 years and still throwing Sticks and Stones something wrong let me get a couple more amens or do I need to repeat that again you're supposed to grow not only in Christ but you're supposed to grow in your marriage [Music] and I see today is such an attack on marriages now around the messages so hard so much pressure but the thing of it is with that attack and stuff coming on people start thinking of divorce get rid of one another get separated from one another that's what the devil wants you to think it ain't time to think like that when you see the enemy trying to come in you they say wait a minute we need to we need to see where the devil where he's working at trying to destroy our marriage let's not attack one another let's go see where the evil one is lying and deal with him yes right right hello I'm just going to be blunt with you I'm just gonna be real with you it's hard for you to get brother Burley to believe that both of you got the Holy Ghost and you can't put your marriage in order something wrong if I'm born again my wife born again problems come up we should be able to get the word of God and solve that problem get rid of our selfishness our own personal feelings and let the word be king amen the Holy Ghost is a keeper he's not only a keeper of your soul he's a keeper of your marriage if you give it to him praise the Lord so you know people want to talk about all the other stuff so I'm sorry as a god son that's a perfect word so he can have some perfect Believers and now that word perfect means mature because this is maturing time amen if the elders can't get their lives together what are the young people going to look up to ah I was just a Nicaragua not too long ago and I asked the question I said who want to get married all of the boys raise their hand none of the girls did it was really shocking to me I said who want to get married none of the boy raised their head and all of a sudden when they raised their head all of them look at the girls now girls doing General like this I said sisters for you not to raise your hand something wrong I said something is wrong I said probably what it is you don't see so much bad marriages because you don't put it in your heart I don't want to get married but let me tell you something friends what God joined together let no man put asunder marriage is Honorable in the sight of God because you seem bad that got nothing to do with you you get your life right with God you got to desire to get married let God bring it together exactly right shocking the Holy Ghost is a cable brothers and sisters people want to enter into things when put God out of it and then when things go wrong they want to put God in it no you put God in it first and when things go wrong still put God in it he'll bring you out of it [Applause] Lord have mercy all of these things pressures happening now it don't happen before amen let's go on a little farther they said verse 12 but the more they Afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they would grieved because of the children of Israel amen hey praise the Lord that ought to help every one of us out right now they would grieved with the children of Israel because the Lord had got Afflicted the more they grew amen the world this allowed to see an ace out to be grieved with you hello it ought to be grieved with you let me tell you something when the world loves you something wrong something is wrong well brother brother you know I want to be friends with everybody and I want to be happy I do too but I'm not going to compromise what I believe to be a friend with nobody praise the Lord let's keep going on here so we see here verse 13. and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor they make their lives bitter with heart bondage and Martyr and brick in all manners of service in the field all their service wherein they made them served with rigor can you see the effects of that today that's why all the pressure is hitting the bride you got to remember now the world got Precious too yes we got pressures too but the only difference you and I hasn't have an antidote we have someone we can go to to deal with depression we don't have to go to pills hello I'm not against pills but we don't have to go to peel I'm not against medical but what bothers me when people start relying on those sorts of things depression pill anti-depressant pills all these things here I want to give you some gospels that God can take care of all of those situations science want us to depend on them but I want to depend on God amen so with pressure today it is the enemy trying to break people down that's why I'm so thankful God gave us a message how to let off of depression know how to let It Off cast all your burdens given to the Lord Jesus Christ he cares for you amen he says and the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was chakra in the name of the other poor he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrews women see them upon the stew if it be a son then you shall kill him but if it be a daughter then shall she then she shall live now we know all of this repeated again I'm gonna read something to tell you what the prophet said he said notice this in the Third Exodus he said notice the king that new king that raised up that didn't know Joseph he said what was his first scheme to destroy the power of Israel notice he said what was his first scheme to destroy the power of Israel was with their children now did you hear what he said to describe the power of Israel was with their children can we say amen and so what do you want to do he wanted to kill the children to stop them from multiplying that's why we see the same thing in the second Exodus what did Herod do he tried to kill the children because whatever he's trying to do is find that seed right so if that happened in the first Exodus in the second Exodus why you think pressure now is on young people it's that same devil putting pressure on the young people why to try to destroy the effects of the message because the world says this is what the world says it's the statistics when children get 18 years old they leave the church I think we need to defy that the only reason why they left the track because they never was born again I think that's why we need to leave our children to the baptism of the Holy Ghost when they get 18 they still serve God they need to serve God the very time God deal with their heart that's what they need to give it to him amen praise the Lord he's trying to destroy the Young Generation now amen that's what he's trying to do now how is he doing through music through movies through entertainment amen that's how he's doing it and save not just young people older ones too hello I was just asking a question recently I said listen they said what can we do turn the lights on for the lights could turn on to the young people ain't nothing you can do but live a life preach the gospel because there's only one man can turn on the light that's God can we say Amen you know I have to preach against this stuff when young people get it in their mind now it's just so much out here so much trouble so much distraction you know I get out of them conversations because you keep they keep talking like that they building the world and then all of a sudden you're like oh honey I understand yeah it's so hard for you I I don't talk like that I'm sorry I I can't I can't do that when they start doing it's so hard and stuff like that really that's what Jesus is good God is good hey man he's a deliverer he's a comforter he's a savior he's a sustainer of the soul I want to talk about Jesus pull them away from the natural thing bringing to spiritual things if you got the Holy Ghost nobody makes you turn on a tape nobody makes you come to church you do it because you want to can we say praise the Lord amen now there's two things I would never do you can ask my son he'll testify I will not wake somebody up to go to work and I will not wake them up to go to church [Music] if it ain't there it ain't there keep me say praise the Lord you can ask my son because many times he was working for him I leave him I go on the job I'll be working he called me an hour and a half later dude where you at duh my new job I'm on a job why you didn't wake me up for what you're looking for a company do they call you and wake you up no so you disrespecting your daddy that's just my daddy no that's my job that's not my hobby no I'm not going to wake you up it got to be in you nobody got to wake me up to come to church because I'm already up early expecting to go to church I'm not going to sleep to the last minute and say oh let me get a little bit more and then I'm maybe make it to church on time no I'm going to be in church on time because I prepared myself the day before before I go to church amen praise the Lord amen we get we living in a generation of time people can go to job sick but they can't come to church sick hello they can go to work sick but won't come to church sick I'd rather skip work sick and then come to church sick because come to church sick I can leave out with some healing Jesus excuses of the flesh we got to overcome these things by the grace of God put God first amen notice oh let me finish reading this he tried to destroy their children now listen close the same devil in a different form of kingship try to destroy God's only son get rid of the children first before they get a start the devil is real smart shrewd bird he knows how to hit the thing before it gets start he knows it the only thing that you can ever do to beat him I like how God's gonna give us a remedy here the only thing that you can ever do to beat him is to rely on Christ amen and humble yourself and let him lead you you'll never do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it you've got to believe it just rely on him he is the shepherd it ain't the Sheik's business to keep the wolf away I like that it's the shepherd's business but the Sheep must stay with the Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my safety zone is in Christ and Christ is the word that's the safety zone now you hope you know you catch that about the shepherd right in one part it is this pastor duty to keep the Sheep safe and mainly protecting who comes to the pulpit hello I didn't preach on certain things what the enemy tried to do but you know the chief Shepherd is Christ which is the word and the word is what keeps us safe the word of God inside of you is direct you to tell you what not to do where not to go what nothing to watch what not to see what not to hear the word will teach you those things that's what keeps us safe if the Holy Ghost Inside of us leading us into the right places where we can Shine the very appearance of evil [Music] I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit I believe he's a keeper until the day of our Redemption I believe God can keep us do you believe that I believe with all of my heart amen wow almost all we ain't even got started don't worry I ain't gonna drag you to death we see here even in this first Exodus attack on the children we see it in the second exits now we see it in the third yeah it's pretty hard on the Young Generation but you got to show them the way that is in Christ amen they got to come the same way we did and I hate to say this but I got to say it the problem with the young people growing up in the message today since they growed up all around the world word and grown up in church they think they automatically born again right no exactly you got to meet him yourself personally you've got to meet him yourself the message did not come to produce religious sinners it come to produce Sons and Daughters of God and not grandchildren but Sons and Daughters of God amen that's young people there you're born again I go to so-and-so Church are you born again my dad is a deacon are you born again uh my dad is the pastor no no no no are you born again take me to your experience in the word show me where you're at can we say praise the Lord you got to meet that's why I said the most important of both all three Exodus is the Lamb amen because it made no difference well all of the characteristics all the things that happen through all of the Exodus is there never was the shed in the blood there was no Deliverance remember all of the Miracles that Moses did took place down in Egypt they were still in Egypt they did not be able to leave out to Exodus 12 when they had to be the sacrifice of a lamb so then in the second Exodus it had to be the lamb himself to lead them out and this Third Exodus the lamb had to come again can we say Amen in the form of a son of man Ministry it had to come again to take us back to the land because in this Exodus we were we grew up in denomination we thought church was the salvation but it's not it's the Christ it's Christ the lamb is salvation so God in this Third Exodus amen that's why amen Revelation 10 had to descend himself to bring his bride out of an exodus that's why first Thessalonians when he said the Lord himself shall descend with a shout to bring us to an exodus that's why Revelation 10 1 and verse Thessalonians they go together the descending of the Lord amen with a shout with a message to prepare us for an exodus it all works together so it has to be a lamb that's why Revelation 5 John's they said behold the law you know the tribe of Judah but when John look he's seen the lamb it wasn't time for lion yet it was time for the lamb a bloody lamb to show I am the kids from the Redeemer I paid the price to bring my people to her inheritance Lord right amen can we say praise the Lord so we see in this Exodus Pharaoh changing his laws we see it in the second Exodus Herod made a law kill all of the children invest in him in Rhema you know them this designated places because Jeremiah said had quoted that that was going to happen see everything working according to God's program is that right laws change that's what today laws have to change they have to be the same pattern in this Third Exodus why do you think Obama passed that hate crime law there had to be God permitting laws to change it's going to constantly be like that laws are going to be changed to God guess what the scriptures to go against the word of God laws have to be changed to do that so there's no difference what we're seeing now today than what has already been done amen now even in the Exodus in the first Exodus you had murmurers and complainers in the second answer this you had murmurs and complainers you don't think they're gonna happen in the third yes there was David and Korra first Exodus can we say man second answer that was judas's carrier and the Pharisees so what you think gonna happen in the Third Exodus make Believers amongst message believers they have to be the exact same thing amen that's right let me read some of these conditions right quick in the first Exodus telling me to Exit the 16. um let's go to Exodus 16 verse 2. it says in the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness did not lay Mama against Jesus huh yeah so what makes you think they ain't going to marmor now what do you think all this is happening with a mama against the prophet it's the same spirit that comes from the first two Exodus murmuring against the prophet oh he told a lie he prophesied a lie he said something he's confused all this nonsense it has to be but let me go ahead and jump ahead of myself you never seen Joshua and Caleb complain can we say Amen Jocelyn Caleb didn't complain because really what they were looking at as a promise not looking at a man's fault looking at the promise that he spoke out of his mouth that's what Joshua and Caleb looked at you don't think they seen Moses problems sure they did have you seen Moses lose his temper I could see Joshua and Caleb Mosley leaves in his temper and power of dramatizing all children in Israel look what he did look what he did and Joshua Kayla said Lord bless you sir he going through a lot there's a lot of pressure on him Lord bless him sir amen hello we have a servant today told a lie but brother told a lie do we say oh he got to be a false prophet no we said oh God thank you for the honesty of that Prophet a lot of pressure was over him on them taxes and he just lost it for a little moment thank God for an honest man thank you Lord I don't complain [Music] but the moment complaining look at it look at look at that that's not it's an honest man the biggest problem people missed out on the message I believe they never let brother Berlin be a human Elijah a man of light precious passions just like you and me think about this here's a man God take him into different dimensions different Realms seeing the Monograms seeing people lie past present future look at all that pressure on the man and then he come out of service the next day out there cutting grass people rocking the road hello a human but yeah the prophet you know when somebody want to put all the prophet mistakes out ask them to talk about theirs you don't have no mistakes yeah yeah I got some mistakes I said well well he without saying let him catch the first stone then but I'm not here to help brother Branham let me tell you friend I refuse to go around the world trying to vindicate brother Brennan I refuse to do that I don't have to do that God did that I just preached the message so I don't get into the ministerial fights I don't get into that kind of stuff God took care of the Prophet because you got to remember whatever you say or do Ain't Gonna Change where he's at so let them talk that's what they've done to Moses that's what they've done to Jesus it had to happen today but Joshua and Caleb Lord bless your servant verse 3. and the children Israel is saying this to them what to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt see their own Revelation is messed up they think God's trying to kill him in other words they're saying that he could have just killed us an Egypt why are you going to bring the light here to kill him just let us stand easy and then we'll just die there God ain't trying to kill them that's what the spirit put around a lot of people in this message they think the mess is trying to kill him no it's not he's trying to save you but look at the message I can't do this I can't wear this I can't hear this I can't go there that's why they look I can't I can't I can't I can't that's a sign they said you're killing me do not let me live my life I want to live my life go right on live your life go right on but what is that Gonna Leave You living your life mean you die but losing your life for the Lord means you live [Applause] but listen what they said what's your God we have died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pot when we did eat bread to the full notice they're saying yeah he would could have killed us in Egypt but at least we was eating good feeling good and happy then just let them kill us Same Spirit Satan let's go back out in the world enjoy yourself live your life do what you want to do fulfill your pleasures what's wrong with that do it but Satan don't tell you if you never be right with God you're going straight to hell amen that's the hard word to say to people today you go into hell you feel like oh that's so harsh you shouldn't say things like that why not why not it's in the Bible you either gonna go to heaven or you're gonna go to hell you're gonna go one another and either which way you go you fight your way you're gonna have to fight you got to fight your way to heaven you got to fight your way to Hell either way it's a fight I want to fight for what's right we don't got so soft oh brother prophesied to be smooth painless no sir no I don't seem too much or came too far I know what God is doing I know what the power of God is I know how God can keep people and I know what the prophecy is how this bride supposed to be a conquering bride not a bride defeated I know that and I believe it yes sir for you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with Hunger they hold Revelation when messed up why because pressure hits them when they sing the signs and the Miracles they were just happy as they could be this is a Revival this is it but now when the pressures of Life begin to come now the enemy attacking the mind and who they blaming Moses in the Lord same characteristics today my my my all right let's keep going could I have a few more minutes right then he says verse 4 then said the Lord unto Moses behold I will reign bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove them whether they would walk in my law or no so they actually they were hungry God said I feed him it seems like when God fed them manna that should have solved the problem but it didn't see there are some people you can't you can't satisfy them you give it to them give them things give it give it it's just their satisfaction the only Satisfaction come is the rest of the Soul because when he got rest in the soul you'll be content with the things God give you Until then people are going to want want one see that's why you got girls and boys jump to one relationship to another that's trying to find happiness but they're looking at it the wrong way if they get that happiness first in Jesus Christ he'll give them the companion that he want to give hello you know these days around the message you preach courtship people get mad at you they really for the priest dating dating if you really look at it has no intentions for marriage dated in the jump from one partner to another to test the fields courtship you got one person on your mind one and praying Lord is just it but dating oh you play the field I know this ain't popular but I see this stuff special in Youth Camp all the time you can see Mr pretty boy think he's the only one on the camp and every girl looking at it and then you get girls get it in her mind like it's just only one boy on the camp all of them locked on that one because he's supposed to be what you call popular popular for what popular for what I'll tell you what he's popular for he's popular for sinning sneaky things doing things wrong undercover he's popular for that and he's also popular that when he can be in church he can Shine Like An Angel so yeah he's popular hello girl's no different see these things need to be exposed ungodliness things like that need to be exposed God don't want you to be that way God wants your heart give it to him first everything else lines up the way that he wants it divorce around the message you would think that would never be but it is in this journey because you got to remember also in the first Exodus it was a mixed multitude second Exodus mixed multitude Third Exodus mixed multitude you would think they would have been satisfied God gave them bread right now let's go to Numbers Chapter 21. numbers 21 verse 5. it said the people spake against God and against Moses wow the very one that delivered them now they speak against them wherefore how you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness say the same thing again for there is no bread but yet it was there is no bread neither is there any water I was so low this light bread so that was bread but they wanted another bread that's our soul loath this light bread they got tired of the matter it's the same thing today I am tired first you rejoice when you come into the message But as time goes by I am tired of you quoting brother Brown I'm tired of hearing it quote something there give me some Dr Dobson give me some TD Jake that man of God too we're tired of hearing this we're tired of this message Same Spirit first Exodus second Exodus third exit Jesus tried to tell them Moses didn't give you that bread my father give you that bread I am the true bread that come down from heaven they didn't want that bread but there was a few electric on it Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus said what are you going to go to where can we go if you leave this word of the hour tell me where you're going I'll tell you where you're going you're going down because God ain't bringing nothing else this is it God don't the devil don't release hell everything that he got and God will release having everything that he got it ain't no more we just have to take what God has given us and whack that devil down with it praise God tired of this bread give us some more bread people want more different they want to eat on something different so they go to entertainment that goes through movies that goes through all these kind of things they'll go through that let me tell you something friends I believe exactly what the prophet said the biggest problem we've done when we took the altar out of the house now dad come from home from work as soon as you get home eat a little dinner get on this phone he's on YouTube Mama on Facebook children on games then when everybody don't hurt their fool after four hours then they come good night good night make sure you pray that's it the devil just infiltrating the home right and you wonder what's wrong with the Young Generation amen praise one he's killing family structure that's what's happening today when young people here that's what liquor going on in that family that husband wife when they hear that stuff it pollutes their mind let the devil say and this message right and people getting divorced and stuff like that and this message supposed to be right giving people young people mind yeah is it right let me tell you something the message is right people are wrong but the devil got to attack the message he had to attack the message to get people to lose confidence in that because he knows I can get it to lose confidence in the word I got him that's why I don't put my faith and my hope in people I put it in Jesus Christ that's where my faith that's what my hope is that is in the word of God bless you I I can't finish it there's no way there's just really no way I got a whole slew of things here but there's no way I could finish how many of you give me five more minutes Hold Up Hold Your Hand up 10 15 20 25 30 30. according to what I'm seeing I got at least three more hours praise the Lord my brothers and sisters I'm just coming bringing it down really but this Third Exodus the characteristics and the conditions if we just understand the first and the second we'll understand the Third we can even go with the prophet's life and bring in the Third Exodus what did it start with Moses being a proper child can we say Amen Jesus Christ himself started God come down started as a baby you can go right to the prophet life with that visitation the light came in at his birth you can go all of that God donate the program for a Third Exodus they're all the same when you catch the pattern so there have to be complaint against the message today is not the Joshua and Caleb that's complaining it's to make Believers let's complaining the unbeliever that's complaining not Joshua and Caleb because they believed the promise that's what the Bride come in we hear a lot of things I'm a one preacher there'll be honest with you I cannot explain everything brother Branham did and said I can't and I ain't gonna try to I'm not I just say I don't know Peter you've been in this message 35 years you don't know I said let me repeat that one more time to you I don't know that don't make me no bigger no smaller I just don't know but I said I know the person that does know and he'll let me know what I need to know what I need to know until then I ain't worrying about it that's the way it's supposed to be hear me say praise the Lord so all this thing pressure on the children impersonators we have to have all that happening today now I ain't going to do that I'll finally get into something else happening around the message but there's things that you probably already see yourself but you know all this stuff has to be fanaticism has to be clicks have to be groups have to be all this have to be it's a shame whenever we get to a place to cataract category categorize Ministries or this group is different from this group this ministry difficult I think every Ministry that is called of God born again should be respected [Music] whether they preach simple preach High it don't matter lonely that is a god gift call it should be respected can we say praise the Lord you know you know when you come to church with the right spirit and right expectation you can get a preacher can get right up here and preach to you God bless you saints of God I want to go ahead and take my subject and preaching the word of life here and they can start reading the quotes lining up scriptures and just voice don't even go high and the power of God can come down come down yeah right because that minister is in his place his position not trying to be like somebody else then you can get somebody here preach Lively power God can come down different minister same power but when you put categories when you yourself don't selected your favorite minister you ain't gonna listen to nobody else it ain't the Menace of fraud sometimes the people fall they got they selected ones I don't want to hear that brother uh he don't shout enough what brother I don't have a lot of them shouting ain't saying nothing [Applause] anybody's you shout what are you saying are you preaching what God gave you is it coming from your heart do you see it yourself these categories now I'll tell you one person dude and I wish he would I well I can't calm him down Michael Teague 82 years old I'd be nervous for him when he preached he thinks he's 40. he gets up down all night no he himself but when he get through everybody but no the power of God falls upon him he stays in his space then I can see another one just simple as can be with deep Revelation power guard just fall I just say praise God I've seen ministers young ministers they could preach something preach you feel the presence of God and then they can even say something wrong but the integrity in their heart was right that's the type of preacher when he's over I talk to him say brother I want to talk to you something about something you said you might want to look at it this way that's not condemning them he just preached the error but now when you get one got a little Doctrine that he think is right but it can't be proven through the message of scripture will he want to push it to the congregation then the type I take care of before they leave the pulpit because if you're going to be that bold to throw it out I'm going to be that bold to expose you [Music] but the categories we got now friends it shouldn't be that way every God gift Ministry should be respected because we go back to the message respect if you don't respect the man office he can't even do nothing for you anyway that's just the bottom line you can't do nothing for you anyway praise the Lord can we get the Lord a hand God bless you musicians could come I really appreciate you continue to keep praying for me uh we still pressing on and back and forth to these doctors don't drove me crazy but you got to do it you know once a month they stick that needle right down in the eye to inject medicines behind it I have to do it but they talking about six months but I'm still believing that it don't go that long I just still keep believing and uh I Just Gotta Eat Right do right and keep myself right not come out right praise the Lord but you know that that sweet stuff is killed it's a killer sugar sweetly kills you kills you sweetly can we say Amen but you know but I'm thankful I pray that you just caught the thought the conditions characteristics trust me we didn't even really get started there's so many things when you study the Book of Numbers right before the Deuteronomy you just find every story every characteristic every problem every situation you'll see the same thing today in this Third Exodus and it have to be that way that's why I don't get discouraged I said well I've seen that before the scripture talk oh I see I see where it's going I see where it's going God had put it that way you and I can judge everything by the scriptures amen let's buy our hearts father we thank you for your word this evening and we trust and pray father things that were said to bring people closer to you because that's our hearts desire to see you glorified to see you lifted up and oh God I pray that you will forgive us if anything was said with the wrong motive wrong objective wrong Spirit forgive us for our ignorance Lord because you know the Integrity of our hearts is to see people break free delivered and out of bondage that's our hearts desire so father we just commit everything to you and to thy hands in the name of Jesus Christ we give you the glory and the church says amen and I tell you one of the key things in the first Exodus they thought Moses message it was a burden [Music] brought us all here to die you've done this then when it comes to Jesus Christ the same thing happened when he said except you drink the blood eat the Flesh of the son of man they begin to say what kind of said did this man is crazy what are you trying to do who you think you are you think you're God she they think Jesus was trying to bring them into bondage they said we we free we choose to labor him we free how can you say whom the sun set free is free indeed see they think first X and second thank you bondage so the same spirit it's in the Third Exodus they take the message it's bondage but Paul said the Commandments of God are not Grievous that's why when people leave the words of Life the first thing they want to post is on free and now I feel the love of God I can express myself no they're not free they love freedom and went to bondage but the deception of the enemy thank you friends God brought them out of Egypt from bondage from the whip of the slave and brought him out and now they're going to say you brought us out here to die this message oh yeah I will admit the message is designed for you to die oh yeah die from yourself because when you die from yourself then Christ can live so yeah it want to kill you they want to kill you not your soul but you yourself that's what it wants to kill he that seek to save his life shall lose it but he didn't lose his life shall save it for my sake shall save it amen I say to you Shalom God bless you so keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true let's all stand oh keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true there's a race that I must run there are victories to be won give me power every hour it's oh keep me true Lord [Music] [Applause] give me power every hour once more oh keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me true Lord Jesus
