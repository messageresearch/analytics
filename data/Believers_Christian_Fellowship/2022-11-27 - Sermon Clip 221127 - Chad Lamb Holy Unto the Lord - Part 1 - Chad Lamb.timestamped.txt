[0:00] all of a sudden Jesus taught him a very
[0:02] valuable lesson
[0:04] you're worried about a man defiling
[0:06] himself by eating with unwashed hands
[0:08] it's not the eating with what not what
[0:11] goes into a man that defiles him it's
[0:13] what comes out of his heart that defiles
[0:15] him
[0:16] it's the condition of the heart being
[0:18] expressed as what's defiling the man not
[0:20] what he's putting in but what's coming
[0:22] out amen so God Christ is showing them
[0:25] that what you need is a change in your
[0:27] heart amen not all of these ordinances
[0:30] to try to keep everything outside from
[0:32] coming inside you need the thing that
[0:34] really defiles a man is the wickedness
[0:37] inside coming outside that's what
[0:39] defiles him
[0:41] amen this is the fallacy of the Holiness
[0:44] movement this is the fallacy of any
[0:47] legalistic movement the Pharisee
[0:49] movement the Holiness movement the the
[0:52] fallacy is that we can weaken through
[0:55] conduct and Order keep any evil from
[0:57] coming in
[0:59] and defiling ourselves we dress right
[1:02] talk right go to church do all these
[1:03] things and and we don't watch anything
[1:05] and we don't we don't listen any bad
[1:07] thing we don't do any bad thing we won't
[1:09] let any bad thing come in the problem is
[1:11] the thing that's defiling you is
[1:13] unregenerate hearts
[1:15] the thing that's defiling you is not
[1:17] being born again the thing that is
[1:19] corrupting you is that which is coming
[1:20] out of you amen you need the word to
[1:23] come in and be a sanctifying process and
[1:25] the Holy Ghost to come in and burn out
[1:28] all of that and bring you into the
[1:30] position the word has for you
[1:34] amen
[1:36] that's why putting on will never work
[1:40] that's why doing will never work amen
[1:43] it's got to be his doing our surrender
[1:46] to his doing that'll come in and bring a
[1:49] change on the inside because the
[1:51] corruption that is in man is in the
[1:53] heart of man
[1:56] so I rule keeping won't do it
[1:58] but I tell you one thing if the Holy
[2:01] Fire of God has burned out the old
[2:02] nature and burn out the old men and the
[2:04] seed of God has sprung the line amen and
[2:06] you become Holiness unto the Lord it'll
[2:08] change the way you dress it'll change
[2:10] the way you talk it'll change your
[2:12] attitudes and that which starts coming
[2:14] out of you will not be what defiles you
[2:16] but what comes out of you will be the
[2:18] very life of God will be coming out of
[2:19] your mouth amen when your kindness and
[2:21] your sweetness and your temperament
[2:23] change and all of these things that are
[2:24] taking place is because we've come
[2:27] surrendered to the word
[2:29] and it washed us and he purified us and
[2:32] he burned us and he changed us
[2:35] and then when we become Holiness unto
[2:38] the Lord
[2:40] we will dress holy talk holy walk holy
[2:43] think holy
[2:46] feel holy you understand
[2:49] that's the Holiness we need
