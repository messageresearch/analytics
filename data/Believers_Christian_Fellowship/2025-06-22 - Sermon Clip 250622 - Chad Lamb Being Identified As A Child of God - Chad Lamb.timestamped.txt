[0:01] You never believed because you wanted to
[0:02] believe. You couldn't help but believe
[0:04] this message. You believed this message
[0:06] when it was inconvenient. You believed
[0:07] this message when your heart was broken.
[0:09] When you were rejected, when you were
[0:11] dejected, when you were cast out, when
[0:13] all your friends turned against you, you
[0:14] couldn't help but believe.
[0:18] Peter gets to a place, amen, where
[0:21] everything is falling apart. Everything
[0:23] was going so good in the ministry of
[0:25] Jesus Christ. The crowds were big. The
[0:27] people were healed. Jesus was putting
[0:29] the Pharisees uh to rest. I mean, they
[0:32] they couldn't answer him. They finally
[0:33] got to the point where they ask him, "No
[0:35] more questions." Yeah. Can you imagine
[0:37] Peter? Peter with his chest stuck out.
[0:39] I'm with him. Right. I'm the campaign
[0:42] manager on this campaign. Yeah.
[0:46] And all of a sudden, everything started
[0:47] falling apart. People started leaving.
[0:49] Jesus started saying things and and and
[0:52] the more people left, the more odd
[0:54] things Jesus said. Can you imagine
[0:57] Peter? This is how this is the way
[0:58] brother Brandon describes it to us.
[1:00] Peter says, "Listen now, you can't say
[1:02] it like that. You can't say that. People
[1:04] aren't understanding. They're leaving."
[1:06] Right? And Jesus says, "Well, if you
[1:09] stumble at that, what about this?"
[1:13] Because it was never about intellect. It
[1:15] was never about conduct. It was never
[1:16] about will. It was never about
[1:18] understanding. It was always been about
[1:20] faith from the beginning to the end.
[1:22] It's about faith. And faith is not
[1:24] something that you conjured up. You
[1:27] worked up, you manipulate, you have
[1:29] faith is a gift from God. It is embedded
[1:32] into that seed gene of God that was
[1:35] placed in you before the foundation of
[1:36] the world was placed in your soul and
[1:38] come to life after the hearing of the
[1:40] word. Amen. That is involuntary. You
[1:43] didn't decide to get it. God decided
[1:45] before the foundation of the world.
[1:47] Amen. And and now the only thing that
[1:48] you can do is just surrender to it and
[1:50] yield to it and give over to it. Amen.
[1:55] Amen. It got so bad. Amen. That Jesus
[1:59] finally turned to the 12 because
[2:01] everybody else was gone and say, "Will
[2:02] you go also?" And that's where Peter
[2:04] says, "To whom shall we go?"
[2:07] Where am I going to go? Thou believe
[2:09] that thou alone have the words of
[2:10] eternal life. Amen. There was something
[2:12] in him. He didn't comprehend. He didn't
[2:15] understand. And he didn't like what was
[2:16] happening. Listen, friends. We don't
[2:20] have to understand what's going on. We
[2:22] don't have to like what's going on in
[2:24] our lives. We don't have to enjoy the
[2:26] trials, the tribulations, the things
[2:28] that are going on. They don't have to be
[2:29] fun. They don't have to be enjoyable.
[2:31] They don't even have to be
[2:32] understandable. But there's one thing
[2:34] that'll hold when nothing else will
[2:36] hold. And that's that involuntary faith
[2:38] to believe the word of God. That's why
[2:40] when you're feeling low, when you're
[2:42] feeling down, when you're discouraged,
[2:43] the worst thing you can do is stay home
[2:45] and miss a service. The very worst thing
[2:47] you could ever do if you got trouble in
[2:49] your mind and trouble in your life and
[2:50] trouble in your home, the worst thing
[2:52] you can do is bail out. Because what you
[2:54] need is a good dose of the word to bring
[2:56] that faith that's in your soul back up
[2:58] to overcome the problems in the mind, to
[3:00] overcome the problems that are all
[3:01] around you. Because you're not going to
[3:04] overcome by taking a mental break and
[3:06] get mentally sorted out. You're never
[3:08] going to get mentally sorted out. And
[3:09] the more you stay away from fellowship
[3:11] and stay away from the word, the worse
[3:12] you're going to get mentally. What you
[3:14] need to do is get right back into the
[3:16] thing that attracted you in the
[3:18] beginning. Right back to the thing that
[3:19] gave you life. Right back to the thing
[3:21] that birthed you. And that's this
[3:23] message of the hour that called you out
[3:25] and connected you back to your father
[3:26] and gave you a positive identity of who
[3:29] you really are.
[3:31] Everything else is a lie.
[3:37] Amen. And that's the thing that
[3:39] identifies who you are.
