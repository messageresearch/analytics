[13:51] to Acts chapter 3 amen while you're

[13:56] and Sister Irene made it home safely
[13:58] they sent us a text this morning they
[14:00] made it back home and they thank
[14:01] everybody for your warm welcome and
[14:03] hospitality and we sure enjoyed the
[14:05] service this past Sunday man really
[14:08] learned a
[14:09] lot amen I'm going to read one scripture
[14:12] here out of Acts chapter 3 and I'd like
[14:16] to read from um verse 19 Acts 3:
[14:21] 19 says repent ye therefore and be
[14:24] converted that your sins may be blotted
[14:27] out when the time of ref refeshing shall
[14:29] come from the presence of the Lord amen
[14:32] God bless you as you have your
[14:34] seats amen I'd like to speak on a
[14:37] subject this evening of repent and be
[14:39] converted amen repent and be converted
[14:43] amen I I um I've been meditating on this
[14:46] and it's just keeps coming and coming
[14:48] over the last 2 three days I actually I
[14:51] sat down and I got some inspiration I
[14:53] started working on uh thought and I was
[14:55] jotting it down really fast and I
[14:56] thought I was going to go that direction
[14:58] and and this was part of it but uh as I
[15:00] sat down today more and more and more
[15:02] started coming and so like I say so many
[15:05] times I don't want to blow through it
[15:06] I'm going to slow down and I'm going to
[15:07] take just this part amen tonight amen we
[15:11] don't have any visitors coming that I
[15:12] know of for a while so I can take the
[15:14] services I I can take my time amen and
[15:17] uh we can take this over the next
[15:19] service or two however it comes but I
[15:22] want to talk about repent and be
[15:23] converted and the reason I want to go
[15:25] into this is because so many times we
[15:27] use terms and because we've grown up in
[15:29] Christian culture and around a Christian
[15:31] Society even if we didn't grow up in the
[15:33] message it was still in a Christian
[15:34] Society of sorts we use terms and I
[15:37] think uh uh from the abundance of use
[15:40] sometimes they lose meaning or the
[15:41] meaning gets muddled amen and so I don't
[15:44] want to I I don't want that to be the
[15:46] case I want to understand what it means
[15:47] to be repent and be converted because
[15:50] that's the Commandment that was given uh
[15:52] by Peter repent and be converted and so
[15:55] we're going to look at those terms and
[15:56] then we're going to look at the things
[15:57] that brother brandham taught and then
[15:59] we'll move from there let's go back now
[16:01] to Acts chapter 2 verse
[16:05] 37 this is the familiar inaugural
[16:08] address of the New Testament Church at
[16:10] the day of Pentecost and in Acts 2:37 he
[16:14] says now when they heard this they were
[16:15] pricked in their heart and said unto
[16:17] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[16:19] men and Brethren what shall we do then
[16:21] Peter said unto them repent and be
[16:24] baptized every one of you in the name of
[16:25] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[16:28] and you sh shall receive the gift of the
[16:30] Holy Ghost this is amazing uh this is a
[16:34] promise that's been given to us if we'll
[16:36] repent and be baptized everyone in the
[16:38] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[16:40] of sins you shall receive the gift of
[16:42] the Holy Ghost brother brandham said if
[16:44] you truly repent and are baptized in the
[16:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and do not
[16:48] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[16:49] makes God a
[16:51] liar that's right so we just take him at
[16:54] his word and believe that God will honor
[16:56] his word if we truly repent and are
[16:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[17:00] Christ amen and then we shall receive
[17:02] and we just receive it as a gift from
[17:04] God and say God I'm open to receiving
[17:07] your gift and God will fulfill his word
[17:09] in our
[17:10] lives so when we talk about
[17:13] repent here when we look at this passage
[17:16] of scripture I I I've talked about this
[17:18] before but who is it's important to know
[17:20] that who is Peter addressing because
[17:23] Peter is not addressing prostitutes he's
[17:26] not addressing drug dealers he's not a a
[17:28] a addressing uh Roman centurions or
[17:31] Roman officials or Roman citizens or
[17:33] Greeks amen th this is the Feast of
[17:36] Pentecost and in the Feast of Pentecost
[17:38] The Devout Jews from all over the world
[17:40] and it lists here how many nations heard
[17:42] them speaking in their own tongues so we
[17:44] know that we have a record of Jews
[17:46] Gathering from all around the world and
[17:48] all these nations why are they coming
[17:50] back because they believe the word of
[17:52] God they believe what Moses taught amen
[17:56] they're they're coming back in obedience
[17:58] to what Moses had taught to the prophet
[18:00] that was before amen and they're coming
[18:02] back so these are these are good church
[18:04] members let's say they're not staying
[18:06] back in their country they're coming
[18:08] according to what was commanded in Moses
[18:10] they're returning back at the Feast of
[18:12] Pentecost because there was three times
[18:14] in the year that every male in Israel
[18:16] must report to Jerusalem to present
[18:18] himself before the Lord amen and it was
[18:20] the Feast of Passover the Feast of
[18:23] Pentecost and the uh Feast of
[18:25] Tabernacles right so now these the this
[18:28] group that were here amen when they
[18:30] Spilled Out Of The Upper Room amen
[18:32] speaking in tongues all these Jews heard
[18:34] them in their own language because they
[18:37] had gathered to the Feast of Pentecost
[18:39] because they were worshippers and
[18:40] Believers of the Bible
[18:44] amen so this is the ones who asked Peter
[18:48] what should we do and Peter says
[18:51] repent repent first repent and so when
[18:56] when when growing up all my life I used
[18:59] to think of repentance because I grew up
[19:01] in Pentecostal churches I thought
[19:03] repentance was uh saying I'm sorry for
[19:06] wrong
[19:07] Deeds but that's not exactly what
[19:10] repentance is that that's asking
[19:13] forgiveness and asking forgiveness is
[19:15] not the same as repentance right and so
[19:18] I I wrote this down so I wouldn't lose
[19:19] track of it I said uh asking
[19:22] forgiveness is to ask someone to release
[19:25] or pardon you for doing wrong that's to
[19:28] ask forgiveness so when I when I begin
[19:30] to express my remorse and regret for my
[19:33] wrong Deeds I'm asking God to forgive me
[19:35] amen I'm asking him to pardon me or to
[19:38] release me if I ask forgiveness from
[19:40] somebody else I'm asking them to pardon
[19:42] me or Release Me amen from doing a wrong
[19:45] deed
[19:46] amen but that's not what repentance is
[19:49] because this word repentance that's used
[19:50] here in Acts chapter 2 and then the
[19:52] first verse we opened with when he said
[19:53] repent ye therefore and be converted
[19:55] this word in the Greek means to change
[19:58] change one's
[20:00] mind to change one's mind and so you can
[20:03] see how repentance is different than
[20:05] asking for forgiveness because you can
[20:07] ask for forgiveness amen but you're just
[20:10] sorry for doing wrong but unless your
[20:13] mind changes you're going to repeat the
[20:16] offense but repentance is a changing of
[20:18] your thinking concerning the
[20:21] offense so so asking forgiveness is is
[20:26] uh saying you're sorry asking for a
[20:28] pardon or a release for wrongdoing but
[20:31] repentance is actually Ching changing
[20:33] your thinking about the
[20:35] wrongdoing and repentance actually
[20:38] prevents you from repeating because your
[20:40] whole understanding your whole thinking
[20:41] about it has changed so now he comes to
[20:45] uh on the day of Pentecost and now these
[20:47] devout Jews they stand up are they're
[20:50] there they're hearing them and and he's
[20:51] telling what must we do you must repent
[20:54] you've got to change what you think
[20:56] about God you've got to change your
[20:58] understanding you must repent amen you
[21:00] think this is false you think this is a
[21:02] cult you think this is some work up a
[21:04] man you've got to change all your
[21:06] thinking you didn't understand who Jesus
[21:08] was you didn't understand who John the
[21:10] Baptist was you didn't even understand
[21:12] really what Moses was
[21:14] [Music]
[21:16] teaching amen because what what began to
[21:19] prick their heart when their hearts were
[21:21] pricked what was their hearts pricked
[21:22] over because Peter stood up on the day
[21:25] of Pentecost and began connecting Old
[21:27] Testament scripture to Modern events I
[21:30] like I said before he was preaching
[21:31] modern events made clear by prophecy
[21:33] amen he kept saying what Joel said this
[21:35] is what you're seeing is what Joel said
[21:37] amen and this is what David said and
[21:39] this Resurrection was referred back to
[21:41] when David said he'll not leave my soul
[21:43] in Hell amen neither shall my Holy One
[21:45] see corruption he begins to tie all the
[21:48] Old Testament Promises to the present
[21:50] day amen what's he doing amen he's
[21:52] disrupting their whole understanding of
[21:54] what they knew about their religion what
[21:56] they knew about their
[21:59] faith and then their heart was pricked
[22:02] said what we do repent he wasn't say
[22:06] telling them stop drinking stop Mo
[22:09] smoking
[22:12] right stop the prostitution and Stop The
[22:16] Killing that wasn't what this repentance
[22:18] was this repentance was you've got to
[22:21] change your understanding you got to
[22:23] change your
[22:24] thinking we've been seeing this all
[22:26] wrong and then repent in the name of the
[22:29] Lord Jesus Christ because if you change
[22:31] your understanding of who Christ was you
[22:33] can get baptized in his
[22:35] name
[22:37] right
[22:38] amen you can be baptized in his
[22:42] name and for the remission of sins and
[22:44] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[22:47] Ghost so you can see how brother bam
[22:50] said a true
[22:51] repentance is necessary for This
[22:55] Promise because you can see
[22:59] how
[23:02] um you can see how you could
[23:05] even baptize in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:09] but have the wrong understanding amen
[23:12] and not receive the baptism of the Holy
[23:14] Ghost
[23:16] amen because it takes repentance a
[23:20] change of mind and then baptism in the
[23:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[23:25] remission of sins and you shall receive
[23:27] the gift to the Holy Ghost this is the
[23:30] pattern this is the
[23:31] method so let's go to Acts chapter
[23:41] 8 Acts chapter
[23:48] 8 and I'm going to use two examples of
[23:50] the scripture to show you how repentance
[23:54] is is a change of mind acts
[23:56] 8:18 he says and when Simon saw that
[24:00] through laying on of the Apostles hands
[24:02] the Holy Ghost was given he offered them
[24:04] money saying give me also this power
[24:06] that on whomever I lay hands he may
[24:09] receive the Holy Ghost but Peter saith
[24:12] unto him thy money perisheth with thee
[24:13] because thou H has thought that the gift
[24:15] of God may be purchased with money thou
[24:17] has neither part nor lot in this matter
[24:19] for thy heart is not right in the sight
[24:21] of God repent therefore of this thy
[24:24] wickedness and pray God if perhaps the
[24:27] thought of thine heart may be forgiven
[24:29] thee what was wrong with Simon Simon had
[24:32] the complete wrong
[24:34] understanding and he was he says the
[24:36] wickedness in your heart and repent that
[24:37] the wickedness in your heart may be
[24:39] forgiven he had the complete wrong
[24:41] understanding so let's go to the the
[24:42] next one then uh Acts chapter
[24:47] 17 Acts chapter
[24:56] 17
[24:59] acts
[25:03] 17:22 said then Paul stood in the midst
[25:06] of Mars Hill and said ye men of Athens I
[25:08] perceive that in all things you are too
[25:10] superstitious for as I passed by and
[25:12] beheld your devotions I found an altar
[25:14] with this inscription to the unknown God
[25:16] whom therefore you ignorantly worship
[25:18] Him declare I unto
[25:20] you he's he's finding them in ignorant
[25:23] worship but now he's going to declare
[25:26] this one that they don't understand
[25:28] God that made the world and all things
[25:30] therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven
[25:32] and Earth dwelleth not in temples made
[25:34] with hands neither is worshiped with
[25:37] men's hands as though he needed anything
[25:40] seeing he giveth to all life and breath
[25:41] and all things and hath made of one
[25:44] blood all nations of men for to dwell in
[25:46] all the face of the Earth and to
[25:47] determine the times before appointed in
[25:49] the bounds of their habitation that they
[25:52] should seek the Lord if happily they
[25:54] might feel after him and find him though
[25:57] he be not far from every one of us for
[26:00] in him we live and move and have our
[26:02] being as certain also of your own poets
[26:04] have said for we are also his offspring
[26:07] for as much then as we are The Offspring
[26:10] of God we ought not to think that the
[26:12] God has his like under gold or silver or
[26:14] stone Graven with art and man's device
[26:17] see what's Paul doing Paul's starting to
[26:19] tear away all their understanding about
[26:22] God their idolatry and their multiple
[26:25] God worship and and making up setting up
[26:27] stones and statues and all of this to
[26:29] represent God he's talking about all
[26:31] that then he comes to verse 30 and the
[26:33] times of this ignorance God winked that
[26:36] but now commendeth all men everywhere to
[26:40] repent amen because he has appointed a
[26:43] day in which he will judge the world in
[26:45] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[26:47] ordained whereof he hath given Assurance
[26:49] unto all men and that he hath raised him
[26:52] from the
[26:53] dead Paul now coming to the Gentiles and
[26:56] Mars Hill amen the great place of
[26:58] philosophy and discussion and and they
[27:00] had so much uh talk and they had worship
[27:03] of multiple gods and they had idolatry
[27:06] and he begins to explain all this but he
[27:08] says amen you were ignorantly worshiping
[27:10] this uh unknown God I come to declare
[27:13] him to you amen because you don't have
[27:15] any understanding amen and ignorantly
[27:17] you began to worship with stones and
[27:20] man-made objects and all of these things
[27:22] he said which ignorance God winked at
[27:25] for a time but not anymore more now he's
[27:28] calling you to repentance now you have
[27:30] to change all your understanding
[27:32] whatever you thought you knew about God
[27:34] all the philosophy and all the
[27:35] understanding now that the message has
[27:37] come you have to repent from all of that
[27:40] and you have to believe the message that
[27:42] Paul is preaching that's right amen amen
[27:46] that's what Paul says he says I'll read
[27:48] 30 again in the times of this ignorance
[27:49] God winked at but now commandeth men
[27:52] everywhere to repent God's not going to
[27:55] let it be okay anymore now the truth is
[27:58] coming amen you must repent from that
[28:00] and accept the
[28:02] truth
[28:04] amen because Heath appointed a day in
[28:07] which he will judge the world in
[28:08] righteousness by that man whom ye hath
[28:10] ordained whereof Heath given Assurance
[28:12] unto all men that Heath raised him from
[28:14] the dead why do you have to repent
[28:16] because there's coming a judgment day am
[28:19] and now that the truth has come you're
[28:20] held
[28:23] accountable now you must
[28:26] repent am
[28:28] amen let's go to Acts 26
[28:35] now Acts 26:
[28:39] 19 this is where we're going to get our
[28:41] first glimpse of be converted because we
[28:44] read the opening scripture says uh
[28:45] repent ye therefore and be converted so
[28:48] this is a commandment to repent and be
[28:52] converted right and so here we find this
[28:55] word in Acts 26:
[28:58] 19 whereupon oh king of grippa I was not
[29:01] disobedient to the heavenly vision but
[29:03] showed first unto them of Damascus and
[29:06] at Jerusalem and throughout all the
[29:07] coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles
[29:09] that they should repent and turn to God
[29:12] and do Works meet for repentance so this
[29:15] word repent is the word we've been
[29:18] talking about to change your mind this
[29:20] word turn is the same word that's used
[29:23] converted almost everywhere else in the
[29:26] Bible
[29:28] so repent and be converted or turn to
[29:31] God Amen and so we're going to look at
[29:34] this even more specifically because
[29:35] brother Bram gives us more information
[29:37] and and so does the bible uh brother
[29:40] Frank if you could pull up the
[29:41] Whiteboard I'm going to go to the
[29:42] whiteboard in just a minute go to John
[29:45] chap 12 with me while we
[29:47] turn I forgot to tell you to keep your
[29:49] Bibles handy we're going to go through a
[29:50] lot of scriptures but I think you
[29:52] figured that out by
[29:53] now I haven't given you a chance to put
[29:55] them down John chap
[30:01] 12 John chap 12 and let's go to verse
[30:06] 39 John
[30:09] 12:39 therefore they could not believe
[30:12] because that Isaiah said again Heath
[30:14] blinded their eyes and hardened their
[30:16] heart that they should not see with
[30:17] their eyes nor understand with their
[30:19] heart and be converted and I should heal
[30:24] them so you can see how under
[30:27] understanding leads to conversion amen
[30:31] right let's read again so we understand
[30:32] because you're to repent and be
[30:34] converted repent means to change your
[30:36] thinking so he he's telling us that
[30:39] their eyes were blinded and their
[30:40] understanding darkened so that they
[30:42] could not
[30:44] convert so that they could not repent
[30:47] and they could not be converted so I
[30:48] read it again he has blinded their eyes
[30:50] and hardened their heart that they
[30:51] should not see with their eyes nor
[30:53] understand with their heart and be
[30:55] converted so if they would see with
[30:56] their eyes and understand with their
[30:58] heart then they would be converted so if
[31:00] they were able to repent they could be
[31:02] converted yeah amen you can see how even
[31:06] in Repentance it's going to take a
[31:08] revelation from God because you're not
[31:10] going to be able to change your own
[31:11] thinking unless God gives a revelation
[31:13] so it's going to take a work of God even
[31:15] to bring you to repentance and if God
[31:18] gives you eyes to see and ears to hear
[31:19] and a heart to understand then you have
[31:21] the ability to repent to change your
[31:24] understanding and to be
[31:26] converted
[31:28] Hallelujah I like that so I'm going to
[31:32] write down these words just so we have
[31:35] them right out of the
[31:43] Greek
[31:47] repent the concordance says to
[31:51] change
[31:54] one's
[31:56] mind
[31:58] and then to
[32:01] convert or to be
[32:08] converted
[32:09] to
[32:11] turn
[32:13] to now this is an interesting word to
[32:16] turn
[32:17] to in the in the scripture that we read
[32:20] before in Acts that they would be uh
[32:22] repent and turned to God this word that
[32:26] is is translated converted the one that
[32:28] we're going to be using uh that this
[32:31] Greek word is not just to turn not like
[32:34] a random turning like you just turn any
[32:36] direction you want but it's actually a
[32:38] specific turning it's turning to a
[32:40] position or turning to a destination and
[32:43] I'm going to explore more of that but
[32:45] it's very very specific because there's
[32:47] another word that's just a turn you can
[32:48] just turn this way you can turn that way
[32:50] but this word is a specific turning a
[32:53] turning to it's also used as to
[32:59] to
[33:01] cause
[33:03] to
[33:06] return or to
[33:10] bring
[33:13] back and it also means
[33:16] to
[33:19] revert so I already hear some people
[33:21] saying
[33:25] amen you can always see the truth amen
[33:29] the message has opened our eyes amen
[33:32] it's not just turning randomly turning
[33:35] but you're turning to something turning
[33:37] back amen and you turn to God Amen many
[33:40] times in the Bible it's used to turn but
[33:43] it's always something specific to turn
[33:45] unto the Lord but many many times it's
[33:47] means to turn back again to to to turn
[33:50] back around and talk to who you were
[33:52] talking with before I'm going to show
[33:54] you just a couple of examples let's go
[33:56] to Luke chap
[33:58] two we're going to look at the same
[34:00] exact word the Greek word is epist stro
[34:03] I know that sounds fancy but EP epist
[34:06] stfo because there's another word that
[34:08] means converted it's just sto that just
[34:10] means turn but Epi is like epicenter
[34:13] it's a specific Place amen so it's episo
[34:17] turn specifically or turn to amen so
[34:20] that that it's really important that we
[34:22] understand that well I'm not just
[34:23] throwing out Greek words just to sound
[34:24] smart because I'm probably pronouncing
[34:26] it wrong so but there's a real reason
[34:28] behind it so so act uh Luke Chapter
[34:33] 2 Luke chapter 2:
[34:39] 19
[34:41] says um and Mary kept all these things
[34:44] and pondered them in her heart and the
[34:46] Shepherds
[34:49] returned guess what that's
[34:53] episo same word that means
[34:55] converted and be converted and the
[34:58] Shepherds returned glorifying and
[35:00] praising God for all the things they had
[35:02] heard and seen as it was told them let's
[35:05] go to let's go to Luke
[35:08] 22 I'm sorry not luk I don't want to go
[35:10] to Luke 22 I want to go to 1 Peter 2 but
[35:13] we're going to come back to Luke so Sav
[35:14] your space in Luke 1 Peter chapter
[35:19] 2 and I'm not going to go to a bunch of
[35:21] places there's there's several more but
[35:23] I'm just going to show this so we can
[35:25] see it in the scriptures first Peter
[35:27] chapter
[35:29] 2 verse
[35:34] 25 says for you were sheep going astray
[35:38] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[35:40] and Bishop of your souls so have you
[35:43] figured it out the word returned is the
[35:45] word converted the same word that's
[35:47] translated converted in other places or
[35:49] turned to it's it's it's converted it's
[35:52] translated returned amen or turn about
[35:55] or return again amen even Jesus when he
[35:58] went to pray for the 12-year-old girl
[36:00] gyrus his little girl amen and he prayed
[36:03] for her her spirit came again this word
[36:05] came again is
[36:07] epos she came back again so you can see
[36:10] there's a whole uh uh usage in this word
[36:13] of to return or to turn back or to turn
[36:16] or to to revert amen and that's going to
[36:18] be really important amen because
[36:20] converting a being converted may not be
[36:23] turning back to turning to something new
[36:25] but it may be turning back to something
[36:28] previous
[36:30] amen let's go to Luke chap
[36:36] 22 Luke chap
[36:40] 22 verse
[36:46] 31 in Luke
[36:49] 22:31 he says and the Lord said Simon
[36:53] Simon behold Satan hath desired have you
[36:57] that you may sift you as wheat but I
[37:00] have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
[37:02] not and when thou art converted
[37:04] strengthen thy brethren we know that
[37:08] here
[37:09] Peter Simon Simon Peter the Lord changed
[37:12] his name to Peter but Peter had been
[37:15] walking with the Lord been part of the
[37:16] ministry been part of the campaigns been
[37:18] part of all of that and and and Jesus
[37:21] begins to tell them that things are
[37:23] going to begin to transpire and Peter
[37:25] doesn't like to hear this and and and he
[37:27] says Simon the the devil has desired to
[37:30] sift thee like weat but I prayed for you
[37:32] that your faith fail not and when you
[37:34] are converted amen so that means that PA
[37:37] that Peter all through the campaigns and
[37:39] all through the ministry he wasn't yet
[37:41] converted he was not yet converted and
[37:44] here's what brother bam says about this
[37:46] in 1960 he says you're not converted
[37:48] until you receive the Holy Ghost the
[37:51] Bible said so after Peter had been been
[37:54] saved and Sanctified given power to cast
[37:56] out unclean spirits and to preach the
[37:58] gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not
[38:01] converted until he received the Holy
[38:03] Ghost and he said after you're converted
[38:05] then strengthen your brethren that was
[38:07] on the night of the Betrayal that he was
[38:09] not yet converted and no man is truly
[38:12] converted until he's been
[38:15] changed and died to himself and the Holy
[38:18] Spirit is control of that person so now
[38:22] uh uh conversion is very very
[38:24] interesting now when we see what the
[38:26] prophet says to repent Amen to change
[38:28] your understanding and be converted Amen
[38:31] to turn what are we turning to well
[38:33] we're turning away from everything else
[38:35] we're turning only to one thing and
[38:36] that's God but we're going back to our
[38:38] originality amen because that's what the
[38:41] new birth does it brings us back to our
[38:43] Original
[38:46] Seed in
[38:48] 1964 in the message why I had to be
[38:50] Shepherds he said and when you're born
[38:52] again it isn't just because you believe
[38:55] you say you're born when when you
[38:56] believe but the Bible said the devil
[38:59] believes also now notice it's not that
[39:02] it's not that it's an experience and
[39:05] brother brandham is very consistent in
[39:06] this that that the baptism of the Holy
[39:08] Ghost the new birth is an experience
[39:10] amen and and and it's and brother B
[39:13] explains it so many different ways and
[39:15] so many people have explained it so many
[39:17] different ways but he boils it down to
[39:19] this from if I could just make it as
[39:20] simple as I can understand how to make
[39:22] it it's the experience of a changed life
[39:25] that there was the power that came into
[39:27] you and changed you from what you were
[39:29] into something else you've been born
[39:31] again by the power of God and you're a
[39:33] new creature in Christ Jesus amen it's
[39:36] the experience of the new birth that
[39:38] experience of the new birth can have all
[39:40] kinds of other experiences or Sensations
[39:43] that go with it amen and even brother
[39:45] brandham said the mystery in the end
[39:46] time is The Mystery of the baptism of
[39:48] the Holy Ghost without sensation now
[39:50] brother brandom's not saying there'll be
[39:52] no sensation or or then in the last time
[39:54] you only have the baptism without
[39:56] sensation that's not what he's saying
[39:58] what he's saying is there's a mystery
[39:59] here coming out of the Pentecostal age
[40:01] coming into the bride age we have to
[40:04] understand that because the Pentecostals
[40:06] believe that there must be a specific
[40:08] sensation and namely speaking in tongues
[40:11] amen that you don't have the baptism of
[40:13] Holy Ghost unless you have this
[40:14] sensation but brother brandham saying
[40:16] the mystery in the end time is the
[40:18] baptism of Holy Ghost without sensation
[40:20] it doesn't it's not tied to a sensation
[40:22] it doesn't require a sensation it's not
[40:24] Vindicated by a sensation amen the
[40:26] initial evidence isn't a
[40:29] sensation that's what he's teaching us
[40:31] amen but are there Sensations many many
[40:34] times I say there Sensations many of us
[40:37] have experienced Sensations in the
[40:39] baptism of Holy Ghost as something
[40:40] begins to change us as as we come in
[40:42] contact with another life another Power
[40:45] another Force sometimes it's very
[40:46] tangible sometimes it's very physical
[40:49] sometimes there's gifts that begin to
[40:53] operate but can also come so subtle
[40:57] that you don't have a sensation that you
[40:59] pick up in the
[41:02] flesh but you must have an
[41:06] experience there must be an experience
[41:09] where where you experience a change amen
[41:13] where you experience a new birth where
[41:16] where something in you has shifted amen
[41:19] it's not what it was amen you where you
[41:22] can say I'm not what I ought to be I'm
[41:24] not even what I want to be but I'm sure
[41:26] not what I used to be amen something in
[41:28] me has taken hold and something inside
[41:31] of me has changed and now there's
[41:33] another Power that's beyond the power I
[41:35] used to have because because when the
[41:37] Holy Ghost comes he'll do you with power
[41:38] to be his witness amen that's power to
[41:41] live the word that's power to manifest
[41:43] that's that's the power to live a
[41:44] Christian Life
[41:46] am
[41:49] amen I
[41:51] remember as a boy growing up in the
[41:53] Pentecostal Church seeking the baptism
[41:55] of the Holy Ghost and I I mean I saw a
[41:58] little bit of everything I think that
[41:59] you can
[42:00] see I've I've stood and cried and cried
[42:04] and cried I've had people shake my jaw
[42:07] and tell me to repeat something over and
[42:08] over again while they shake my jaw to
[42:11] try to loosen my
[42:13] tongue I mean that's what they say they
[42:16] tell you to repeat a phrase over and
[42:18] over and over again I don't think on the
[42:20] day of Pentecost they had to do any of
[42:23] that I think it was a natural outflowing
[42:25] of the Holy Ghost I think it was the
[42:27] power of God not the workup of a
[42:31] man
[42:33] amen but I would be so discouraged and
[42:36] so disappointed because I I even
[42:38] remember going to a meeting one time and
[42:40] I got to the front and I stood there and
[42:42] and they went down and prayed for him
[42:44] and and nearly everybody up there was
[42:46] slain in the spirit and when I opened my
[42:48] eyes and done praying I was about the
[42:50] only one
[42:52] standing and I thought I am a
[42:55] failure
[42:58] but one thing I could never do was
[43:00] pretend one thing I can never do was
[43:02] fake it amen that's something in me I
[43:04] couldn't just go along I remember being
[43:07] I remember being down at the altar and
[43:09] what would have been almost described I
[43:11] I hate to use these terms but almost
[43:13] described as a mosh pit as all these
[43:15] kids were bouncing around and bumping
[43:16] into each other and my step brother
[43:18] started bouncing up and down and jumping
[43:20] up and down and my cousin and my step
[43:22] brother I heard him tell my other cousin
[43:24] I mean these are close close
[43:26] people to me and he says just start
[43:28] jumping it feels so good and they
[43:30] started jumping amen and it changed
[43:32] their life what not one degree closer to
[43:35] God when they left that meeting they
[43:37] were exactly the same as they had always
[43:39] been amen and I couldn't make myself
[43:42] jump up and down I just stood there and
[43:44] watched and I felt like a
[43:49] failure but then I came to the
[43:52] message and I come in contact with a
[43:54] living Jesus Christ yeah and something
[43:57] happened to me amen something happened
[43:59] that I knew something happened that was
[44:01] tangible was there Sensations there was
[44:03] loads of Sensations there was times his
[44:05] presence would come so near that my skin
[44:07] would would would my the hairs on my
[44:09] body would stand on in I was coming in
[44:11] contact with the living present real
[44:13] life Jesus
[44:15] Christ and many times I'm reluctant to
[44:18] to share my experiences because I do not
[44:20] want anybody to say if that happened
[44:22] that way it's got to happen this way to
[44:23] me it doesn't happen it doesn't have to
[44:25] happen the same way for anybody what's
[44:27] got to happen is there's got to be a
[44:29] power that comes in and quickens a seed
[44:31] of God that's in the soul amen and
[44:34] brings a change in our life but there
[44:36] must be an experience amen there has to
[44:39] be an experience that actually changes
[44:41] [Music]
[44:44] us
[44:48] amen I
[44:50] knew nothing that I experienced at an
[44:53] altar call in Pentecost changed me
[44:56] I had no power to overcome I could not
[44:58] resist temptation I couldn't overcome
[45:00] lust I I had no
[45:02] power and the older I got the more
[45:05] discouraged I got the more worldly I
[45:10] got but this
[45:13] change this this
[45:16] experience I could overcome what I can
[45:19] never overcome before I began having
[45:22] Victory upon Victory more victories and
[45:24] and it began to change me and it wasn't
[45:26] a put on it wasn't a pretend and there
[45:28] was Temptations and some Temptations
[45:30] were hard to resist and some were worse
[45:32] than others but there was another Power
[45:34] I wasn't depending on human will anymore
[45:36] because my human will could only hold
[45:38] out so long before I collapsed and now
[45:40] there's something holding beyond the
[45:42] human will beyond my strength when I was
[45:44] collapsing something else was holding me
[45:46] up amen
[45:49] amen
[45:51] amen and anytime that I would begin to
[45:54] fail or fault
[45:56] or or or or do wrong there was something
[45:59] that brought me to an immediate quick
[46:01] repentance and would actually cause me
[46:03] to expose myself and confess and do
[46:06] things that I never did before I always
[46:07] hid now there's another Power that's
[46:09] causing me to confess and to
[46:12] repent there must be an
[46:15] experience the experience brother's
[46:17] consistent in this as he goes through
[46:19] the message especially in the last few
[46:20] years it's the it's the experience of a
[46:24] changed life
[46:27] now we could probably testify all night
[46:29] and how it was for you and how it was
[46:31] for others and some will have distinct
[46:33] things that they remember some will have
[46:35] periods of time of change some won't be
[46:36] able to describe it very well it'll be
[46:39] subtle it'll be powerful it'll be all
[46:40] kinds of different things amen and we're
[46:42] not here Amen to try to make one form or
[46:44] another form or one sensation or another
[46:46] sensation preferred or better even no
[46:49] sensation is fine with me as long as
[46:51] there's a
[46:54] change amen
[46:57] and so we're talking about repentance
[46:59] and being converted and being converted
[47:01] is being born again in the smon church
[47:04] age out of the church age book brother B
[47:07] says now then here we are coming to a
[47:10] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[47:13] manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt
[47:16] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[47:17] and that Eternal one was the father
[47:19] manifest in flesh and thereby gained the
[47:21] title of son even so we Eternal in his
[47:25] thought in our turn became the many
[47:27] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[47:30] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[47:33] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[47:36] even as we are so called we did not
[47:39] become seed by
[47:41] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[47:44] reborn for only the elect can be
[47:49] reborn
[47:50] amen so tell me who can be converted
[47:54] right amen amen
[47:56] amen only the elect can be reborn
[47:59] because we because we were seed is the
[48:02] reason we could be quickened and nonseed
[48:05] there is nothing to
[48:06] Quicken he told Peter when you're
[48:09] converted Peter was a Peter was
[48:11] believing Peter had a revelation the
[48:14] Revelation in Peter was Thou Art Christ
[48:16] the son of the Living God Amen and he
[48:17] got that from the father he believed
[48:19] Jesus was the Messiah he followed the
[48:21] ministry he did all that he says but yet
[48:23] you have to be converted and brother Ram
[48:26] tells us that conversion was the new
[48:29] birth and he goes on to tell us that
[48:31] only the seed can be
[48:35] reborn so I ask you again who can be
[48:39] converted
[48:43] Amen in Matthew
[48:47] 18 let's look at
[48:54] this
[48:56] it gives a whole new understanding to
[48:59] the term born again
[49:01] Christian because only the seed can be
[49:03] born again
[49:06] Christian
[49:08] amen sometimes when we say these things
[49:10] it it upsets so many people but we're
[49:13] not here to upset anybody all we're here
[49:14] is say what the prophet said there's a
[49:17] living reality and when we say this
[49:19] we're not saying there's no hope for
[49:20] anybody else we're not saying that
[49:21] nobody else will be saved at the white
[49:23] Throne judgment we know that multitudes
[49:25] will will give entrance into eternal
[49:26] life we thank God for that but we're
[49:28] dealing with the reality of the new
[49:30] birth amen there must be a seed there
[49:33] for there to be a new birth and if
[49:35] there's a seed there then you're the
[49:36] predestinated seed Gene of God you're
[49:38] the elect you're part of the Bride so
[49:40] the new birth who are the who are the
[49:42] Born Again Christians the Born Again
[49:44] Christians can only be those who can be
[49:47] born again who can be born again only
[49:49] those who have the seed of
[49:52] life amen Matthew
[49:58] 181 at the same time came at the same
[50:01] time came the disciples un Jesus saying
[50:04] who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
[50:07] and Jesus called a little child unto him
[50:08] and set him in the midst of them and
[50:10] said verily I say unto you except you be
[50:12] converted this means to
[50:14] turn and become as Little Children You
[50:18] shall not enter into the kingdom of
[50:20] heaven what's he saying we're going to
[50:23] turn what which direction should we turn
[50:26] what is this turning you need to be
[50:29] converted you need to turn turn to what
[50:32] to one of these little children you need
[50:33] to he's speaking of the new birth you
[50:35] need to become a child again amen amen
[50:39] you need to turn to be converted and
[50:42] become as a little little children or
[50:45] you shall not enter the Kingdom of
[50:47] Heaven amen this is what he tells
[50:49] Nicodemus Nicodemus comes to him at
[50:51] night and he says uh uh he says he asked
[50:54] him how can can I be saved basically and
[50:58] that's John 3:1 he says there was a man
[50:59] of Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of
[51:01] the Jews the same came to Jesus by night
[51:03] and said unto the rabbi we know thou art
[51:05] a teacher come from God for no man do
[51:07] these Miracles that thou doest except uh
[51:10] God be with him Jesus answered and said
[51:13] unto him verily verily I say unto thee
[51:14] except a man be born again he cannot see
[51:17] the kingdom of God is that right so what
[51:20] do you have to do to see the king of go
[51:22] you got to be born again and then you'll
[51:23] see it why you'll get the eyes SA you
[51:25] begin to see it
[51:27] amen you must be born again so when we
[51:31] look at at at uh Matthew 18:3 again
[51:37] unless you're converted and become as a
[51:39] little children you shall not enter into
[51:41] the kingdom of heaven and except you're
[51:43] born again you cannot see the kingdom of
[51:46] God so what is this turning to what is
[51:48] this conversion when we turn back to God
[51:51] when we go back we must go back to be
[51:54] like children
[51:56] we must go back to be born again because
[52:00] when we go back and we're born again
[52:02] when we turn back to our origin when
[52:04] we're born again we reconnect with who
[52:07] we really are we reconnect with our
[52:09] origin and we have a new birth amen we
[52:11] start over again the old life is now
[52:14] dead to us now there's newness of Life
[52:17] what have we done in our conversion amen
[52:19] we have surrendered our life and we now
[52:22] have a new life and now we're starting
[52:24] from the beginning as a child and what
[52:26] is a child a child is somebody who
[52:28] doesn't know anything doesn't have it
[52:30] figured out isn't proud and arrogant
[52:32] isn't leading themselves we go all the
[52:34] way back to say I'm starting over I
[52:36] don't know anything God you've got to
[52:38] teach me everything new
[52:40] again this is what it means to be
[52:43] converted Amen to become like one of
[52:45] these little children
[52:46] amen hallelujah this is what had to
[52:49] happen to the Apostle
[52:51] Paul this is this is what had to happen
[52:54] to Peter amen amen Peter was so proud
[52:57] Peter was so self-confident amen Peter
[53:00] was so sure amen because God had
[53:02] promised him the keys and and he had got
[53:04] the revelation of who Jesus was and he
[53:07] had cast out demons and he had done all
[53:08] these things this is what brother bam
[53:09] tells us amen but he had not yet been
[53:13] converted and in his pride he's looking
[53:16] for who's the greatest Among Us and in
[53:18] his pride he's trying to exalt himself
[53:19] over his brother in his pride he's
[53:21] rebuking Jesus saying surely this thing
[53:24] won't happen to you yeah what is he he's
[53:28] self-sufficient he's proud he's
[53:33] knowledgeable but what does he need he
[53:35] needs to be converted and be like a
[53:37] little child again Peter needs to get to
[53:39] the place where he says I don't know
[53:41] anything I'm a failure I can't do it
[53:44] amen I tried I got to go back to being a
[53:46] little child a little baby again because
[53:49] Jesus says I thank you Father that
[53:50] you've hid this from the wise and The
[53:52] Prudent but revealed it unto babes why
[53:55] cuz the Revelation are going to come to
[53:57] the children am and when we're converted
[54:00] we're going back and starting life over
[54:04] doesn't matter if we're 10 doesn't
[54:06] matter if we're 100 when we're converted
[54:08] we're going back and starting life
[54:11] over everything we had learned is
[54:15] foolishness all the education we had is
[54:18] worldly and we're going back to being
[54:24] converted amen let's turn to First Peter
[54:26] chapter 1 just look at a few scriptures
[54:29] associated with
[54:37] this 1 Peter chapter
[54:40] 1 verse
[54:46] 23 being born again not of corruptible
[54:50] seed because what is the corruptible
[54:53] seed that is our first birth amen our
[54:56] seed was our natural seed was
[54:57] corruptible it's been corrupted through
[55:01] hybridization so not being born again
[55:03] being born again not a corruptible seed
[55:05] this is what Nicodemus said must I go
[55:07] back into my mother's womb a second time
[55:09] no that would be corruptible seed birth
[55:12] again not born again born again not of
[55:15] corruptible seed but of
[55:19] Incorruptible what's The Incorruptible
[55:21] seed it's the seed Gene of God amen amen
[55:24] the new birth is not going back to the
[55:26] corruptible seed again it's The
[55:28] Incorruptible seed and how is the new
[55:30] birth going to come by the word of God
[55:34] which liveth and abideth
[55:36] forever when the word comes amen it's
[55:39] going to give us the ability to be born
[55:42] again amen let's go to Titus Chapter
[55:52] 3 Titus Chapter 3
[55:58] in verse
[56:06] 4 says Titus
[56:08] 3:4 after that the kindness and love of
[56:10] God our savior toward man appeared not
[56:13] by works of righteousness which we have
[56:14] done but according to his Mercy he saved
[56:18] us by the washing of regeneration and
[56:21] renewing of the Holy Ghost this wash of
[56:25] regeneration regeneration means New
[56:27] Birth reproduction renewal Recreation
[56:31] regeneration that's what that word
[56:34] means then the the the next word there
[56:38] renewing means renovation or a complete
[56:41] change for the better so what has the
[56:44] Holy Ghost done for us it's made us a
[56:46] new creation completely changed and
[56:48] better amen that's the new birth amen
[56:52] that's what the New Birth has done amen
[56:54] it it it it is by the washing you know
[56:58] he says not by works of our
[57:00] righteousness which we have done we
[57:02] couldn't do this we couldn't earn this
[57:03] but according to his Mercy he saved us
[57:05] how by the washing of regeneration what
[57:08] making us a new creature amen re being
[57:11] reborn or rebirthed amen and being
[57:14] fashioned renovated made completely
[57:16] better and completely different now it's
[57:19] an actual new life amen that is the
[57:23] renewal this is the regener generation
[57:25] and the renewal of the Holy Ghost which
[57:27] is shed on us abundantly through Jesus
[57:29] Christ Our
[57:31] Savior brother M says in the identified
[57:34] masterpieces of God I was reading this
[57:36] the other day and it really struck me
[57:39] said and as Jesus said one time consider
[57:41] the lies and yet I say unto you that
[57:44] Solomon in all of his glory was not
[57:45] array like one now he's going to take
[57:48] this analogy that Jesus used and he's
[57:50] going to explain something to us he says
[57:52] Solomon in all his glory was a magnific
[57:54] ient sight there's no doubt he was a
[57:58] great thing to the world and a great man
[57:59] before God but Solomon's robe did have
[58:02] no didn't have no life in it it was a
[58:05] piece of material probably sheared off
[58:07] of a sheep's back but the Lily had
[58:12] life what we need today is the Life of
[58:14] Christ inside of us that's what purifies
[58:17] not the outward a turned around collar
[58:19] or a degree of psychology or something
[58:21] it takes the power of the resurrected
[58:23] Christ to make make us what we should be
[58:26] God has no other plan than let the Holy
[58:28] Spirit Rule and reign in the church amen
[58:31] that's God plan amen consider the lies
[58:34] Solomon and All His glory wasn't array
[58:36] as one of these Solomon's AR rail amen
[58:39] was man-made it was magnificent it was
[58:41] beautiful but it was man-made but the
[58:43] Lily amen had beauty that came from
[58:45] inside there was the life of the Lily
[58:47] and now in Christianity we're not to be
[58:49] have a put on Glory but an inside out
[58:52] Glory that comes from the life of Jesus
[58:54] Jesus Christ in The
[58:58] Believer amen
[59:01] amen so let's go back to Luke 22 let's
[59:05] pick
[59:06] up Peter's
[59:11] story Luke
[59:22] 22 in verse 60 Luke 2 verse
[59:28] 16 Jesus had told him he prayed for him
[59:31] that his faith fell not said when you're
[59:34] converted go strengthen the Brethren
[59:37] then we know on that fateful night that
[59:39] the guards came Peter and all his his
[59:42] glory cut off the ear of the high priest
[59:46] because he was trying to defend the Lord
[59:48] actually was trying to defend his own
[59:49] self and his own
[59:53] belief and he followed them into the uh
[59:58] into the house of the high priest where
[59:59] they were having the trial it was in the
[1:00:01] outer Court they kept asking him if he
[1:00:03] was a galileon and he kept denying the
[1:00:05] Lord and here we come to the last time
[1:00:07] in verse 60 and it says Peter said man I
[1:00:10] know not what thou sayest and Matthew it
[1:00:13] says he curses and
[1:00:15] swore I know not what thou sayest and
[1:00:18] immediately while he yet spake the cck
[1:00:20] crew and the Lord turned and looked upon
[1:00:23] Peter and Peter remembered the word of
[1:00:24] the Lord how he had said unto him before
[1:00:27] the Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice
[1:00:31] and Peter went out and wept
[1:00:36] bitterly I think this is so important of
[1:00:40] scripture for tonight
[1:00:43] especially
[1:00:45] Peter he was a child of God he was
[1:00:49] predestinated seed of
[1:00:51] God he he loved the Lord he genu genely
[1:00:54] loved the Lord he went along with the
[1:00:58] ministry he had certain
[1:01:00] Revelation but yet he hadn't been born
[1:01:03] again but Peter thought that he could
[1:01:07] withstand Temptation Peter thought that
[1:01:11] he was man enough or Christian enough or
[1:01:15] however we would say it he thought he
[1:01:17] was but when the pressure came on he
[1:01:20] found out that he didn't have anything
[1:01:22] inside his will crumbled
[1:01:25] his strength
[1:01:26] failed his his his you know his bravery
[1:01:31] was
[1:01:32] empty when it came down to it Peter in
[1:01:35] himself didn't have what it took to live
[1:01:38] the
[1:01:40] life he needed to be
[1:01:43] converted so when Peter realized that he
[1:01:46] had utterly failed the Lord he went out
[1:01:48] and wept
[1:01:50] bitterly I think that's the best thing
[1:01:52] he could have ever
[1:01:53] done
[1:01:55] then you go out and weep bitterly
[1:01:56] because he realized he's
[1:01:58] failed all his pride amounted to nothing
[1:02:01] all his efforts amounted to nothing he
[1:02:06] failed you
[1:02:07] know this might begin to be the first
[1:02:10] time Peter really starts to be honest
[1:02:12] with
[1:02:15] himself I think it would do us all a
[1:02:17] world of good to be honest with
[1:02:21] ourselves sometimes we've been in church
[1:02:23] raised in Church raised around the
[1:02:26] message we know so much been part of the
[1:02:28] ministry part of the campaign but in our
[1:02:30] secret lives we know what we really are
[1:02:33] yes we know what we're not overcoming we
[1:02:35] know what vices we have no power to
[1:02:38] overcome we know no matter what we Bluff
[1:02:40] and say and no matter what we put on we
[1:02:43] know what's really going on on the
[1:02:45] inside some I think the best thing we
[1:02:47] can do when we keep failing secretly you
[1:02:50] know it's not publicly secretly keep
[1:02:52] covering and failing and covering and
[1:02:53] failing I think the the best thing we
[1:02:54] can do is just go weep bitterly
[1:02:56] somewhere and say God I cannot do this
[1:02:58] anymore I'm an absolute failure on my
[1:03:01] own I I can not I thought I could but I
[1:03:05] cannot what did he needed he needed to
[1:03:07] be converted but he was eligible to be
[1:03:10] converted because he was a child of God
[1:03:12] Amen and after that Peter was converted
[1:03:15] we find out that Peter no longer is
[1:03:17] hiding in the upper room he's no longer
[1:03:19] running away amen ashamed of the Lord
[1:03:22] but after he receives the baptism of the
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost he runs right out and becomes
[1:03:25] the spokesman on the inaugural day he's
[1:03:27] not ashamed anymore to declare his
[1:03:29] allegiance to Jesus Christ he was before
[1:03:32] but he's not
[1:03:33] now what happened something
[1:03:36] changed there was a conversion that took
[1:03:39] place there was a birth that came amen
[1:03:41] and we find that Peter doesn't even
[1:03:43] become a perfect believer after that
[1:03:45] because it's not about flawlessness amen
[1:03:47] it's about following the Lord is about a
[1:03:49] new birth and we find him in Antioch
[1:03:52] separating from the brothers creating a
[1:03:53] dissension amen and and playing the part
[1:03:56] of a hypocrite a little bit and Paul
[1:03:57] withstands him to his face amen but
[1:04:00] guess what Peter's correctable because
[1:04:02] Peter's been changed amen Peter doesn't
[1:04:04] cut his head off Peter doesn't accuse
[1:04:06] him Peter doesn't break Fellowship but
[1:04:09] later Peter actually admonishes them to
[1:04:11] believe Paul and actually it takes the
[1:04:14] writings of Paul and makes them equal to
[1:04:20] scriptures why he wasn't perfect but he
[1:04:22] was changed that was a changed man and
[1:04:25] later we find him amen Peter is the one
[1:04:28] who who who who was Brash who was bold
[1:04:31] who was proud who was arrogant who
[1:04:33] corrected everybody who wanted to be the
[1:04:35] best amen when he found out he didn't
[1:04:37] have the goods he wept bitterly amen he
[1:04:40] he he absolutely changed his thinking
[1:04:42] about himself he repented he realized
[1:04:45] I'm not what I thought I
[1:04:48] was and then the new birth came right
[1:04:52] and now he went out and he never tried
[1:04:54] to be anything
[1:04:56] anymore now when the lame man was healed
[1:04:59] at the gate beautiful a me he went
[1:05:01] lumping leaping and jumping into the
[1:05:03] temple and they gathered around and
[1:05:04] began to to almost worship amen Paul uh
[1:05:07] Peter and John Peter and John John Peter
[1:05:09] says why look you at us as though some
[1:05:12] power of us has made this man whole it's
[1:05:14] not us amen but it's faith in Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ it's faith in his name that this
[1:05:18] man is everywhere whole Peter now has no
[1:05:21] desire to take the credit he a changed
[1:05:24] man amen that because why because he
[1:05:27] repented and he was converted amen his
[1:05:29] thinking changed he was converted and he
[1:05:32] comes out different this is the man amen
[1:05:34] that God would allow to preach the
[1:05:36] stature of a perfect man and the virtues
[1:05:38] of
[1:05:41] God Amen I would not have called him
[1:05:44] eligible before to preach on Temperance
[1:05:47] or patience or brotherly
[1:05:51] kindness but the new birth changed
[1:05:55] he was renewed he was renovated he was
[1:05:58] regenerated amen he was a new creature
[1:06:00] he went back to being a child he went
[1:06:02] back to being a babe amen he went back
[1:06:05] to knowing nothing and starting all over
[1:06:07] again and going from the from the New
[1:06:09] Birth unto
[1:06:11] adoption a new life amen starting as
[1:06:21] nothing the Apostle Paul
[1:06:25] thought he was a
[1:06:27] Believer the Apostle Paul thought that
[1:06:31] he knew the word been to the best school
[1:06:35] and he thought he was working for the
[1:06:37] Lord yeah right he was the smartest he
[1:06:41] was the wisest he had the most skill and
[1:06:45] ability he was in good standing with the
[1:06:48] priest and the high priest and the
[1:06:51] elders but he had an encounter with a
[1:06:54] living Jesus
[1:06:55] Christ and the pillar of
[1:06:57] fire and that encounter smoted him to
[1:07:00] the ground yes humbled humbled and
[1:07:06] broken he finds out that the one that he
[1:07:09] had been persecuting he thought they
[1:07:11] were people that had a false religion
[1:07:13] and a false idea and were ruining the
[1:07:16] the
[1:07:17] Bible when he come to find out in that
[1:07:19] encounter that he was persecuting Jesus
[1:07:21] Christ himself who was living in the
[1:07:24] people amen and now his whole world
[1:07:27] changes amen does he come to repentance
[1:07:30] he absolutely comes to repentance
[1:07:32] because his whole thinking changed
[1:07:35] amen when he gets up from that
[1:07:37] experience he can't even see to walk he
[1:07:40] has to be led by the hand into the City
[1:07:45] and he's led by the hand into the city
[1:07:47] the Bible says he lays there for 3 days
[1:07:52] with no sight and no no food
[1:07:56] yeah I wonder what he thought about for
[1:07:59] 3
[1:08:01] days I wonder how many things he
[1:08:06] regretted for three
[1:08:08] days I
[1:08:10] wonder with this Revelation that just
[1:08:12] hit him as a literal light out of
[1:08:15] Heaven changed his whole world his whole
[1:08:18] Paradigm all his
[1:08:21] understanding you know when it all
[1:08:22] changed it left him humble and
[1:08:26] broken it wasn't
[1:08:29] flippant it wasn't oh yeah I see that
[1:08:32] I'll take no it wrecked his
[1:08:36] Universe amen yeah yeah this is why
[1:08:41] brother B says in one place I doubt a
[1:08:43] dry-eyed
[1:08:45] confession it's not that you have to cry
[1:08:48] to be converted that's that's not what
[1:08:50] he's
[1:08:51] saying but back in his day there was so
[1:08:53] many decisions for Christ and raising
[1:08:55] your hand if you agree and you want to
[1:08:57] be saved and and and fill out a card or
[1:08:59] come forward and repeat after me prayer
[1:09:02] amen but there was there was none of
[1:09:03] this Brokenness none of this weeping
[1:09:06] bitterly none of this realizing I'm not
[1:09:08] what I thought I was I thought I was a
[1:09:09] Christian but I'm not really a Christian
[1:09:11] I thought I was a message believer but I
[1:09:13] see now I'm not really got the change
[1:09:16] that I was projecting to other people
[1:09:18] because inside I have no power to
[1:09:21] overcome yeah right that's not something
[1:09:24] to take lightly that's not something to
[1:09:26] move on Beyond we don't keep pretending
[1:09:28] we don't keep moving on in our own Pride
[1:09:30] amen we need to come to a weeping
[1:09:32] bitterly we need to come to a place when
[1:09:34] we're flat on our back broken and
[1:09:36] humiliated with a couple days to think
[1:09:38] about
[1:09:39] it and I'm sure he was thinking about
[1:09:42] how could I been so wrong how could I
[1:09:44] miss it and I'm sure he was thinking
[1:09:45] about Steven
[1:09:52] stoning
[1:09:55] amen amen sometimes what we need is to
[1:09:59] realize we're not what we thought we
[1:10:02] were Lord and we need a bit of humility
[1:10:05] and
[1:10:06] Brokenness and some weeping some
[1:10:09] Contrition some quiet time to sit and
[1:10:11] say God you've got to help me because I
[1:10:16] can't help
[1:10:19] myself what we don't need to do is just
[1:10:21] keep moving on and hope everything works
[1:10:27] out in 2 Corinthians 7:10 it says and
[1:10:31] for Godly sorrow worketh repentance yes
[1:10:35] to Salvation amen for Godly sorrow
[1:10:38] worketh repentance to Salvation not to
[1:10:41] be repented of not to be
[1:10:44] regretted but the sorrow of the world
[1:10:46] worketh
[1:10:47] death Godly sorrow worketh
[1:10:51] repentance this is why I believe for the
[1:10:53] prophet said I doubt a dry-eyed
[1:10:55] confession like I said I I don't want I
[1:10:58] don't think you need to pour out floods
[1:11:00] of
[1:11:01] tears just to prove that you've
[1:11:06] confessed but you may right but I
[1:11:10] believe one thing there'll be a
[1:11:11] conviction in your heart that'll tear
[1:11:13] you up there'll be something to cause
[1:11:16] you to realize I got to have more than
[1:11:18] what I have now am there'll be something
[1:11:21] that begins to wreck your world am me
[1:11:24] I've seen it even even in children I've
[1:11:26] seen when they begin to go through that
[1:11:28] time where they're just unsettled and
[1:11:29] they're Disturbed and something's eating
[1:11:31] at them and it's tearing them up what is
[1:11:33] it amen there's there's Godly conviction
[1:11:35] that has come and there's a sorrow and
[1:11:37] there's a concern for their
[1:11:40] soul I don't think that should ever go
[1:11:45] away I think we need genuine real
[1:11:48] conversions amen
[1:11:51] amen we need to to have our world
[1:11:55] wrecked we need to weep bitter tears we
[1:11:58] need to
[1:11:59] realize am I need something that I don't
[1:12:03] have right
[1:12:04] now because what I have right now isn't
[1:12:09] working and we need to cry out to God
[1:12:11] and say God you made a promise in your
[1:12:14] word that if I will repent and be
[1:12:18] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:19] Christ for remission of sins I shall
[1:12:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:12:23] I have been baptized according to your
[1:12:25] word and I have repented and I'm
[1:12:27] repenting now all my understanding is
[1:12:29] changing God come and fill me with your
[1:12:31] spirit change me almighty God do the
[1:12:34] work in me that I can't do myself do in
[1:12:37] me what my willpower failed what my
[1:12:39] strength has failed what my intellect
[1:12:40] has failed to do do something in me Lord
[1:12:43] I invite you I ask you I implore you God
[1:12:46] change
[1:12:47] me I think it should be
[1:12:50] serious should be Earnest not flipping
[1:12:53] and
[1:12:54] light-hearted but there should be some
[1:12:56] Earnest
[1:12:59] repentance brother B says in the message
[1:13:01] the token said don't just come this far
[1:13:04] say I believe the message you obey the
[1:13:07] messenger come into Christ you say well
[1:13:10] I believe every word said brother
[1:13:12] Brenham that's good but that's just
[1:13:15] being able to
[1:13:17] read he's not talking about a genuine
[1:13:19] Faith from your heart he's talking about
[1:13:20] a mental acceptance of what you've heard
[1:13:22] or been God right but that mental
[1:13:25] acceptance is not enough that's a good
[1:13:27] thing it's not a bad thing you should
[1:13:30] you should recognize it to be true you
[1:13:31] should accept it at true amen but it's
[1:13:33] got to go deeper than a mental
[1:13:35] acceptance amen or an agreement he said
[1:13:39] that's just being able to read said take
[1:13:41] the message take it into your heart that
[1:13:43] you must have the token amen the very
[1:13:46] life that was in Christ be in you when I
[1:13:49] see that I will pass over you until you
[1:13:52] have the token you're not safe from the
[1:13:54] pending destruction amen the pending
[1:13:57] destruction is coming but the only
[1:13:59] safety is the token amen and the in on
[1:14:01] the in Egypt amen at the Passover the
[1:14:04] token was the literal blood that they
[1:14:06] put on the lentil and on the doorpost
[1:14:08] and and and the Death Angel would pass
[1:14:10] by and recognize that token is symbolic
[1:14:14] amen that they have taken the lamb
[1:14:16] inside and they slay the lamb as a
[1:14:18] substitute for them and the token is
[1:14:20] evidence that they're safe amen yeah
[1:14:23] they've obeyed the word and they're
[1:14:25] sealed under the token mother B said the
[1:14:27] token today is not physical blood the
[1:14:30] token today is the life that was in the
[1:14:32] blood amen the life that was in the
[1:14:34] blood with that that that blood that was
[1:14:36] shed at Calvary the life was released
[1:14:38] and the life now can come back upon the
[1:14:40] believer and that life in us that's the
[1:14:43] thing that changes us that's the thing
[1:14:44] that quickens us that's the new birth
[1:14:47] that brings us back to our origin and
[1:14:48] starts us as a child again on the road
[1:14:50] to
[1:14:52] adoption and that token that changed
[1:14:54] life that literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:14:56] in The Believer is the
[1:15:01] token and will keep us from the
[1:15:04] impending
[1:15:06] judgment and it's the only thing yes
[1:15:09] that
[1:15:11] will but praise God it's for the
[1:15:14] children of God it's absolutely for the
[1:15:17] children of God brother Bram said God
[1:15:20] wants to fill you more than you want to
[1:15:21] be filled it's his desire it's his plan
[1:15:24] it's his word it's his promise amen what
[1:15:27] does he need he needs somebody who will
[1:15:29] repent yeah he needs somebody who will
[1:15:33] lay themselves out and say God I can't
[1:15:36] do this I'm not going to pretend another
[1:15:38] day I need the indwelling power of the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost to live this life I need a
[1:15:42] new birth experience I need an
[1:15:44] experience that changes
[1:15:47] me it's what he needs it's what we need
[1:15:51] it's what we all need
[1:15:55] and you
[1:15:57] know even those of us who've received
[1:16:01] this
[1:16:03] experience sometimes we need to turn
[1:16:05] back again
[1:16:09] yes sometimes we wander away a little
[1:16:14] bit make a misstep here or there pick up
[1:16:17] our own idea about
[1:16:20] something sometimes we need to make a
[1:16:22] turn back
[1:16:24] ourselves brother man refers to this and
[1:16:27] and Jesus mentions this in Revelations
[1:16:29] chapter 2 let's go to Revelation Chapter
[1:16:38] 2 Revelation
[1:16:44] 2:4 said nevertheless I have someone
[1:16:47] against thee because thou has left thy
[1:16:48] first
[1:16:50] love this is the Ephesian Church age
[1:16:54] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[1:16:56] fallen and
[1:16:58] repent and do the first works or else I
[1:17:01] will come unto thee quickly and remove
[1:17:03] thy Candlestick out of his place except
[1:17:06] thou repent this repent is the same word
[1:17:09] repent change your
[1:17:12] thinking the Ephesian church had he says
[1:17:14] you've lost your first love what was
[1:17:16] their first love that first experience
[1:17:18] they had when everything was fresh and
[1:17:21] new they were committed to God and in a
[1:17:24] relationship with the Lord and brother
[1:17:25] Braham said formalism begin to creep
[1:17:28] in man they they they lost their Zeal
[1:17:31] and their fire and their ability to
[1:17:33] reach forth in the spirit and a little
[1:17:34] bit of formality had begin to creep in
[1:17:38] is that
[1:17:39] right and he tells them you've left your
[1:17:41] first love now repent and go back to the
[1:17:44] first
[1:17:46] works oh this isn't just for a new
[1:17:48] conversion this is for all of us
[1:17:51] friends sometimes we we we we we think
[1:17:54] we're okay and everything's going along
[1:17:56] fine but reality we begun to grow cold
[1:17:58] amen we begun to grow a little formal
[1:18:00] and every once in a while he needs to
[1:18:02] tell us repent and go back to your first
[1:18:05] Works amen when you were first bornn
[1:18:06] again when everything was about Christ
[1:18:09] and nothing
[1:18:10] else when nothing else mattered when
[1:18:13] rejection didn't matter when the rest of
[1:18:14] the world didn't matter the only thing
[1:18:16] mattered is that something's changed in
[1:18:17] me I've met God and that's all I want
[1:18:21] am
[1:18:24] amen he says repent and do the first
[1:18:27] Works what do he mean repent and go
[1:18:31] back and brother BR says in the fourth
[1:18:33] seal he says look she was asked to
[1:18:35] repent go back to where she fell from
[1:18:37] and where did she fall from the word hey
[1:18:40] where did he fall from where did the
[1:18:42] denomination fall from the word there
[1:18:44] you are seeing no other way just every
[1:18:46] time it's come right back to the word
[1:18:48] right back to the word and they get into
[1:18:50] a system that runs them back away from
[1:18:52] the word runs them from the word instead
[1:18:53] of to the word notice look she was given
[1:18:56] a space to repent go back repent means
[1:18:59] to go back turn back about face repent
[1:19:02] go back brother brandom is now taking
[1:19:04] this term repent and he's using it in
[1:19:06] this in this way according to the
[1:19:08] scripture repent and go back and mean we
[1:19:10] know repentance in the Bible means
[1:19:12] change your mind conversion means to
[1:19:14] turn back and now he's coming to the
[1:19:16] church who's already the church but he's
[1:19:18] saying Turn Back amen repent and turn
[1:19:21] back amen
[1:19:23] say God help
[1:19:25] us to not lose our first
[1:19:28] love help us not to lose our first
[1:19:32] experience I say God what I want is I
[1:19:35] want a freshening of my
[1:19:38] experience I want a fresh relationship
[1:19:40] that stays fresh I don't want to grow
[1:19:43] formal when I feel it growing formal I
[1:19:44] want it to come right back amen I want
[1:19:46] to go right back to when when you you
[1:19:48] feel the Lord's so close you know he's
[1:19:50] there amen I want to go back to that I
[1:19:52] want to I want to to stay in those
[1:19:53] refreshing times I want to be refreshed
[1:19:55] again and again and again I don't want
[1:19:57] to just preach this for new people to be
[1:19:59] converted amen and and turn to the Lord
[1:20:01] and Born Again am mean after I've had
[1:20:03] the experience of the new birth I don't
[1:20:05] want to stray too far away from it amen
[1:20:07] I want to stay in the refreshing of the
[1:20:09] Lord amen and and walking in him in my
[1:20:12] first love
[1:20:15] amen if it goes 40 50 60 70 years we go
[1:20:19] mature all the way into adoption I don't
[1:20:21] want to leave leave my first
[1:20:23] love when it's so real and so powerful
[1:20:26] it means everything to
[1:20:29] us praise
[1:20:34] God
[1:20:36] Amen just want to finish with this
[1:20:41] scripture that I quoted
[1:20:43] before but Jesus said I thank thee oh
[1:20:46] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[1:20:49] I was hid these things from the wise and
[1:20:51] prudent amen and revealed them unto
[1:20:54] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:20:57] in thy
[1:20:59] sight who's he revealing himself to his
[1:21:04] babes the ones that can be born
[1:21:07] again not the ones that are
[1:21:11] all self-sufficient and wise have the
[1:21:15] message all figured out and has all the
[1:21:18] answers but he reveals it to the
[1:21:21] babes amen
[1:21:23] amen those that have been turned back
[1:21:27] and become like little children so that
[1:21:29] they can see the Kingdom of
[1:21:31] Heaven those have been born again so
[1:21:34] that they can see the kingdom of
[1:21:37] God that's who he's revealing this to
[1:21:40] you we don't need to
[1:21:42] get
[1:21:44] self-inflated proud we don't need to
[1:21:47] become know- it alls because we've
[1:21:49] believed 20 30 40 years
[1:21:54] what we need is to keep laying in the
[1:21:56] presence of the Lord and saying Lord
[1:21:57] change my thinking change my thinking
[1:22:01] change my
[1:22:04] thinking you
[1:22:06] know I I I come in contact with the
[1:22:09] living Jesus Christ so many years ago 24
[1:22:13] 25 years
[1:22:15] ago and for 24 25 years however long
[1:22:19] it's been he's been constantly changing
[1:22:21] my thinking amen that's right you know
[1:22:24] what I've been doing for 24 years I've
[1:22:26] been
[1:22:27] repenting for 24 years I've been
[1:22:30] repenting amen and I don't think my time
[1:22:33] of repenting is over but I want his mind
[1:22:37] in every situation his mind in every
[1:22:40] decision his mind and everything I don't
[1:22:42] want to repent just once and be
[1:22:44] converted I want to keep repenting and
[1:22:46] keep repenting and keep repenting and
[1:22:48] anytime I find myself straying away and
[1:22:50] getting cold I want to turn back amen
[1:22:52] and get right back close to him again
[1:22:55] because that's the only place that I'm
[1:22:56] happy and that's the only place I can
[1:22:58] survive and that's the only place I can
[1:23:01] grow amen we have to repent and be
[1:23:06] converted be turned back to a child
[1:23:10] again to be born again repent it's a
[1:23:14] commandment repent and be
[1:23:17] converted let's all Stand
[1:23:20] Together musicians if you can come
[1:23:22] brother John if you can
[1:23:23] come I just had a desire to do a little
[1:23:26] word
[1:23:27] study because I want to understand what
[1:23:30] it means to repent and be
[1:23:34] converted we can come and we can ask
[1:23:37] forgiveness we should ask for
[1:23:39] forgiveness we should confess our sins
[1:23:41] we should ask for
[1:23:43] forgiveness but real repentance goes
[1:23:46] beyond that it actually changes our
[1:23:49] thinking amen it takes us from remorse
[1:23:51] and sorrow for sin and remorse because
[1:23:54] Godly sorrow worketh repentance because
[1:23:57] when you're really sorry about something
[1:23:59] you change the way you think about it
[1:24:01] when you really regret the way you've
[1:24:03] lived and you regret your
[1:24:04] misunderstandings and you regret your
[1:24:05] selfishness and you regret your pride it
[1:24:08] changes the way you think about
[1:24:11] yourself Peter I'm sure had a lot of
[1:24:14] changing to do in his thinking Paul
[1:24:17] certainly had a lot of changing to do I
[1:24:20] know I had a tremendous amount
[1:24:23] and I'm still
[1:24:25] repenting but I want to
[1:24:28] repent and I want to be turned
[1:24:31] back I want
[1:24:33] everyone every child of God to have the
[1:24:37] opportunity to repent and be turned back
[1:24:40] repent and be converted go back to be
[1:24:44] born again go back it doesn't matter how
[1:24:46] old old you are and it certainly doesn't
[1:24:48] matter how long you've been in the
[1:24:49] church and it doesn't matter how long
[1:24:51] you've been in the message
[1:24:54] M repent and be
[1:24:56] converted let's be born again let's have
[1:24:59] that experience where you can say I I
[1:25:02] may not be able to explain it it may not
[1:25:04] have happened to me the way it happened
[1:25:05] to you but one thing I'm sure of there's
[1:25:07] been a an effective change in my life
[1:25:10] something real has happened to me and
[1:25:13] changed my
[1:25:15] life amen amen let's just bow our heads
[1:25:19] together dear heavenly father I Trust
[1:25:22] You Lord in all
[1:25:25] things I Trust You Lord in your
[1:25:28] leadership your Holy Ghost anointing

[1:25:36] this message
[1:25:38] tonight because I trust your
[1:25:41] leadership I trust your ways I've seen
[1:25:43] you work so many times in so many
[1:25:46] ways it's always been perfect
[1:25:49] Lord when you take control
[1:25:52] it's always perfect and always
[1:25:56] effective God this message might only be
[1:25:59] for one
[1:26:01] Soul only one Soul under the sound of my
[1:26:04] voice that needed to hear
[1:26:06] this but if that's true you directed me
[1:26:09] for that
[1:26:10] Soul God if you've given me the
[1:26:13] anointing to preach it I pray that you
[1:26:14] bring the anointing to receive it Lord
[1:26:17] that you would touch that life that you
[1:26:19] would touch that
[1:26:20] Soul God no no matter where that
[1:26:24] individual has been that seed's been
[1:26:25] laying there from before the foundation
[1:26:27] of the world you've been waiting Lord
[1:26:30] for a time that you can Quicken it to
[1:26:33] life maybe the individual who's carrying
[1:26:36] that seed has been playing
[1:26:38] Church pretending going with the motion
[1:26:41] caught in the Stream and flow of life
[1:26:44] with parents or loved ones or
[1:26:47] spouse maybe theyve just been carried
[1:26:49] along through the church and they have
[1:26:51] no objection to the message but they
[1:26:54] they know inside of themselves there's
[1:26:57] never been that
[1:26:59] change that new
[1:27:01] birth that really gives them the power
[1:27:04] even in their secret life to
[1:27:07] overcome God I pray if there's an
[1:27:09] individual that's like that Lord I pray
[1:27:11] that you'd go to them
[1:27:14] now for God you said through the
[1:27:16] foolishness of preaching you would save
[1:27:19] Sinners you would save the Lost Lord
[1:27:21] through this mechanism and I trust that
[1:27:23] it'll work according to your ways
[1:27:27] Lord God I pray that you would move on
[1:27:30] the hearts and lives of your children
[1:27:32] that you would bring genuine repentance
[1:27:34] genuine conversions
