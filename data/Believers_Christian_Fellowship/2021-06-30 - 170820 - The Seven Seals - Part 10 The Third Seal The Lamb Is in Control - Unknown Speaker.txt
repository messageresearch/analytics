========================================

hallelujah praise the lord certainly a privilege to be with you here this morning it's been a wonderful worship service i appreciate just appreciate the lord amen appreciate the specials and all that god's doing just appreciate what he's doing in us amen it's it's not as though we're having to really work hard to make a sacrifice of praise he's drawing it right out of us and the revelation is lifting us on a higher plane and we're connecting to him in a greater way than we ever have before and praise is just flowing out of us unto him what a wonderful thing friends it's just a beautiful place to be and you know i was preparing yesterday and i knew somebody was praying i didn't know who and i didn't know but i knew somebody was praying because the presence of god came down so strong in my study i was just weeping i couldn't even study i couldn't do anything but walk around in circles and and i if i could live right there i would stay there every moment of my life it's the most wonderful thing when he when he comes and just does something personal and i just loved it and i just i was just relishing in it and i just wanted it so whoever's been praying thank you keep it up i love it you know i just want us all to be in that atmosphere to be more spiritually tuned in than we ever have before god's wanting us to be dedicated unto him he's calling for a spirit-led life a spirit-filled life i mean not to go through the motions not to have a form of religion but to be amen the manifestation of the word to be a living word in our day to have god within living his life yes that's what he's called for in this hour and and i long for it more and more and more every day let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah 46 we're going to continue in the third seal and then the more i look in the seal the bigger it gets and i thought you know it might be one part or two parts and it's getting to be i think the third part on the third seal and we'll see what the lord does if we can finish up or not but we will we will do our very best to follow the leading of the lord amen it's good to have brother craig bower back amen god bless you brother i talked to him this morning he said he had a very exciting trip a lot of things happening so he's going to take this wednesday service for us and give us an update and minister for us and i'm very excited to hear what's happening because he was very excited amen and that's that's wonderful god's really moving and then i want to remind you that this coming sunday brother esther um brother nestor espanola from the philippines will be here ministering for us and then camp starts next wednesday praise god it's hard to believe it comes so fast but i'm i'm excited to see it come and everybody's working hard there's a flurry activity right at the end and if you find yourself with a little bit of time and no job to do and you want to get involved see brother dean or somebody else and ask hey what what do you need the most and and i'm sure brother dean will sign you up quick for something amen god bless you let's uh read isaiah 46 and verse 9. isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure amen it's amazing that god has his own counsel and he's able to declare things from ancient times that have not yet come to pass amen and he has declared it and he declared it to daniel and it was sealed and he told daniel to be sealed he declared it in the thunders and he told john not to ride it but we're we're living in the day that the seals have been broken the thunders have been preached and we're here seeing and hearing those things that were foretold of ancient times that some have not even yet come to pass so we're looking forward to those and we're seeing the day of rapid fulfillment and now what i love about this is we know that his council shall stand and if you have a position in that council and you're part of that council you shall stand his counsel shall stand amen and he says and i will do all my pleasure if your pleasure is his pleasure then those are good words for you amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and as we approach unto you lord we're just so grateful that we can come again noah we're so grateful that we have a place where we can gather together with our brothers and sisters and we can worship you lord and we know you're here because you promised it lord you promised in your word where two or three are gathered in your name you'll be in their midst and here we are and we know you're here also lord while we pray that you'd make yourself known to us by the breaking of your bread lord that you would feed your sheep this morning pray that you would take this vessel of clay lord and by the power of your holy ghost that you would operate a gift that's laying inside to minister your word to your people lord use lips of clay to speak eternal words we ask for these things now as we lord just feed on your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats we'll bring up the powerpoint amen we've we've done quite a bit of review so we're just going to launch in and go go very quickly we're going to talk about the third seal and show that the lamb is in control this is what i think is one of the greatest revelations of this seal is the fact that the lamb is in total control amen let's go to revelations chapter six just refresh ourselves on the seal revelations chapter 6 verse 5 and 6. and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine i want to really emphasize here that that there was a voice in the midst of the ford beast that said a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine we're going to take a look at this in just a couple slides real quick i want to show right at the beginning of the third seal i've read the first half of this uh the last two services that there was another part that i wanted to add tonight he said in this great hour that we're now living we see yearly it gets darker and darker to the world and the coming of the lord gets brighter and brighter as he reveals himself in his word and in his manifestation this is a synopsis of the third seal the world is getting darker and darker and darker because there's gross darkness there's a famine of hearing the word of god and then the word of god is not being preached in its purity it's not being preached in its wholeness it's bringing peace together by the minds of men to make it comfortable for those who are living in compromise to stay in compromise it's made the the preaching of the gospel is made to make people comfortable in their pews it is not preached in a way to line people to the word amen because people don't want to line to the word they want to be comfortable and have religion just like cain wanted to have religion amen so now there's a famine in the land of hearing the word of god amen because people just want to do what they want to do and they heap together themselves teachers having itchy ears amen they just want their ears scratched they just want to have a form of religion but deny the power thereof but through the man age anointing amen there was light coming revelation coming amen the oil and the wine was coming and it was getting brighter and brighter and now we're talking about the third seal and the third seal we know brother brenham takes it and shows that how this was the the darkest hour for the word of god but how through a man anointing out coming from luther through wesley and on up it would begin to restore back to the word amen but by the anointing of the wisdom of god would come and he typed it with a man typing the the intellectuals the right understanding the revelation of the word would pour back into the church bringing it out of the dark ages and so he types this back but then he makes a statement that's very interesting this is right in the beginning right in the opening statements in the third seal we have come again tonight lord to attempt this meeting and to pray thee to open to us lord this third seal of this book that it might be known to us that we would know what to do and how to live and how to be better christians so he's not asking for the seal to be open so we understand what happened in the church ages the purpose of the seal being revealed was not to understand what happened in the church ages so but though that we would know what to do and how to live and how to be better christians hallelujah it has to do with the church ages absolutely amen this is a pattern that this is a pattern that patterned itself out through the church ages but brother branham is not asking for just to see the pattern he's asking for the pattern to show us how we should be living today how we should be better christians today by understanding the third seal hallelujah is the black horse was the antichrist was riding on his black horse which is spiritual famine and dark ages amen and people believe that we have come out of the dark ages we most certainly have not come out of the dark ages spiritually speaking the world is steeped where amos put them in a spiritual famine not for bread and water but hearing the word of god amen their minds are darkened to the gospel amen it's never been a darker time for the gospel than it is right now there's churches on every corner amen but it's not the abundance of steeples that you see across the landscape that have anything to do with light all they're doing is sowing more darkness because they perverted the word of god amen the only thing they'll bring light is the pure word of god the perverted word of god will bring more darkness more famine for hearing the word of god hallelujah the scriptures are replete with this the new testament speaks of this amen so it's a dark ages the third seal he said this he was starting writing him in the time of dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left now we see our battle plan we know now as we've been studying this and watching it we're seeing the devil's tactics we're understanding how he operates and brother branham said if you want to if you want to fight somebody in a war you need to understand your enemy and understand his tactics so you know how to fight against him and that's what the seals are doing is it's revealing the enemy exposing his tactics so now we understand what's happening in our lives we know why something's coming against me this way and why it's happening this way because that's the way he operates he's laid down a pattern and he will always operate by that pattern the pattern's not changing then he sends out a competing power the power of the man now the third beast that went out from the devil was this black horse now the third beast that went out power from god to combat him to combat the powers of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of god and we've we know too that he had oil and wine oils the holy spirit wine is the stimulation of revelation and so now this wisdom of god this intellectuals that come from god is spiritual understanding by revelation not spirit spiritual understanding by education spiritual understanding by revelation we could give you a message quiz book and sit down and train you until you could answer all the questions on the message quiz book but that doesn't mean that you've received revelation and actually know in your heart what all this means amen doesn't mean that you've ever met jesus christ personally to you but what it means is that you're able to recite back what you've heard in your ears and comprehended in your mind that's not what's going to get it there's got to be a spiritual revelation that takes place amen and that's what this man that's what this man age anointing amen represents praise the lord the fourth seal the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts but now you start bringing the word now that's the thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on pentecost when the word was vindicated now you see what what was it what was happening at pentecost is they already had received promises jesus had already unlocked their understanding by the scriptures amen but they were waiting for a promise to be fulfilled amen and when they saw that promised word come into manifestation they got so stimulated they were drunk on new wine and spilled out into the street so excited they just had to tell somebody about it and that's what happened at pentecost it was the stimulation of revelation when they saw the word coming to pass in their day they got excited about it amen that's why if you don't see the manifestation of the word in your day you're not going to be very excited amen you'll sit in church and there won't be a whole lot of hallelujahs or amen just kind of stoic sitting there rehearsing god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet god sent a prophet but what did the prophet say and what was the purpose of his ministry amen we live in a day where we know god sent a prophet but god also took a prophet off the scene and what that prophet left the words that he brought was more important than himself what he introduced was more important than the person himself and now we have to be united not with malachi 4 but we have to be united with the mighty angel that came down in revelations 10. it's not the seventh angel that we unite to amen it's the mighty angel that we unite to and then catch those revelations as they peel themselves open in our day and then you'll get stimulation with new wine and that's why when when we're just rehearsing over and over what god did what god did what god did it's hard to keep the youth excited amen it's hard to keep him from running out for movies and videos and some other entertainment it's hard to keep the families together it's hard to keep dad sitting next to mom because there's nothing to be excited about i've heard this before we're talking about what god did 50 years ago and every service is what god did 50 years ago but i tell you if you want to get a believer excited you show them in the word what god's doing today right now then they'll spill out of the upper room and have to go tell somebody about it hallelujah stimulation by revelation drinking new wine hallelujah praise the lord now just as that church is kind of antichrist church progresses she's showing how the antichrist church progresses from white horse to red horse to black horse and then the pale horse he says just as he progresses so has the bride come along with different things through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost just moving right on see just like that only they've taken the revival first and the church is taking it the last there's a principle here that we'll hopefully get into in the next few weeks i don't have time to get into it today but we see that this cycle repeats itself through the through the church ages we always see whatever time god lays down a pattern that pattern you'll find it repeating over and over and over again and so the church has progressed through the false church through white horse red horse black horse and you'll find that that rolls right on all the time so you get a new false doctrine that'll start it'll come out in innocency under white horse can't harm anybody it's just a saying amen it's just a way of fellowshipping together and then it'll move the red horse and start division amongst brethren and start war and then it'll go to black horse and leave the people in spiritual famine and it'll start to measure out the word amen and bring control back to the mother church it happens every time the same way and so god is showing that there's a pattern there but there's another god bless you isabella it's good to see you here today hallelujah i i just happened to see you there my wife sometimes asked me why don't i don't say hi to people when i see him i say because i'm so lost in space when i get up here if i if i see you half the time i don't even know what your name is praise the lord so we see there's a pattern and the church went first and then god come down through and he said the pentecostal message was the last message which justification sanctification the baptism of holy ghost the last three messages the last three church ages formed the complete birth so he's showing the birth of the church not not just the individual but those three church ages brought the church all the way back into birth amen so they could unite with the headship and so we see this pattern that the lion is justification amen because you hear the word what happens when you first hear the word you run out and you're roaring and roaring and roaring like a lion amen and and you catch the word and it makes you bold and it makes you independent and oh praise the lord it's a wonderful thing but then you realize you've got to eat the book amen and the book becomes bitter in your belly because it's not just talking now there's a life that has to be lived amen you can come out excited about what you hear and go talking about it but there has to come where the rubber meets the road that this word has to translate into a life lived and so then we have to come into sanctification which is the ox anointing which is you bear under the burden of the word and you sacrifice your life hallelujah but then you come to a greater revelation amen come to a new birth experience where it's revealed to you amen brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed what is the new birth then well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you now let me be clear it is not the revelation of who he was it's the revelation of who he is there's a ton of people who can tell you who he was but how many people know who he is today and we know that he is the word and he said his he is the word i mean the word was with god the word was god we know the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when that flesh died and resurrected and went he never stopped being the word he is still the word he was always the word that came out from god he always will be the word and he says the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life if people want to get in the spirit and they want to have a spiritual show and a spiritual service and they want to feel the spirit of god and jam up the music and play and dance around a bit but if you don't have word you don't have spirits because my word is spirit and life you can get a spirit you can get a spiritual anointing on your on your spirit and you can get excited about that but that that that could be a false spirit altogether amen amen because without the word you don't have the right spirit without the word you don't have jesus christ so what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ today manifesting his word who he is right now at this moment amen personally revealed to you not you joined a church you shook hand you'd done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation the church was built upon it says now same same message now paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is the only is only the only way you could know him not say i'm a methodist that means nothing i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm a catholic that means nothing i go to a message church that means nothing amen that's no more than just another form of worship amen if that's the deeper all the deeper it goes it don't mean nothing amen but by revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you hallelujah super sign the solar sun up there s-u-n has control of all botany life when a seed is laying there and that sun strikes it it'll come to life yes sir and the s-o-n of god is the controller of all eternal life and you've got a seed of life in you brother and when the s-o-n strikes there and shows you what he is it comes to life there is no way of keeping it from it hallelujah praise the lord i want to read a little bit out of the fourth seal if you've brought your book i'm going to read out of paragraph 76 and the fourth seal says yes you you can accept it by faith you have to accept christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the holy spirit by faith but then let the holy spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he's accepted your faith you see then so abraham believed god and it was reputed to him for righteousness now i i have to stop here and i just pray for me folks because we could preach four or five hours today amen and if you all leave in one of your stays i'll still feed whatever sheep stay behind so so it says abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so if abraham's imputation of righteousness was based on what he believed what was he believing on was he believing on something that abel had said or something that adam had said but or was he believing on a fresh revelation from god was he believing old word or was he believing the word that was manifest for his day see there was a promise that came to abraham for abraham for the day abraham lived in and it didn't matter how much he believed what adam had said or what abel had said or what enoch had said none of that at this point matters doesn't matter if he believed what noah had said and done it doesn't matter at this point all that matters for the imputation of righteousness is that he believes god today god could come to him and say you're going to have a sign and he says no no no no no that's not happening this day i'm building an ark because that's the last word that i saw that's in my bible i'm just going to do what's in my bible and nothing else he would have never had the imputation of righteousness because imputation of righteousness is based on believing god hallelujah and you can't it doesn't do you any good to believe what was in the past amen we should believe what's in the past but anybody can believe what's in the past amen even jesus he's looking at the pharisees and he's saying he's saying your fathers killed these prophets and now you're out there recognizing those prophets and whitewashing their tombs what good is it going to do you amen it didn't do your father's any good because they rejected what good is it doing you polishing that because everything that those prophets dead is now standing in front of you in a body of flesh and you're rejecting it you're doing the same thing your fathers have done it doesn't do one ounce of good to recognize the past amen even the pharisees who were standing jesus in the face and calling him beelzebub they had no problem with isaiah no problem with ezekiel no problem with jeremiah they had the old testament and they believed every word of it so far amen so far as they knew but when the word itself that all that old testament come into flesh and was standing there living in front of them they rejected it thereby cutting them off from any any resource any ability or any effect of that word it now meant nothing to them friends we stand in the same place today we can believe in prophets and polish their tombs and visit jeffersonville all we want but what good is that going to do if we deny jesus christ manifest in the formation of the bride today the full word manifestation and a many membered bride if we're rejecting that it doesn't matter if you get your picture taken beside the tombstone it won't do you any good it won't do any more than it did for the pharisees in that day if you had believed moses you would receive me if you had believed in what the prophet told us you would receive the manifestation of the word for this hour so abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness we're back in the fourth seal but god gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he'd accepted his faith so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the holy spirit till it's done something i want you to get this so much confusion on the holy spirit baptism because we take a pentecostal idea amen and we've got to actually understand what the prophet is teaching us about the baptism of the holy ghost amen abraham received it in a type of circumcision and he didn't receive it and dancing and shouting and speaking in tongues he received it in a sign of separation of cutting off amen and a separating out we must wait on the holy spirit until it's done something not necessary not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we have danced or we got emotional we shouted until we were changed until something actually happened i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing it says though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity it profit me nothing see though i could do it so those things doesn't mean that you have the holy spirit but when he the person the immortal spirit of christ comes becomes your personal savior and changes you and throws your views right straight into calvary to this word something's happened yes sir something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know it when it happens and the new wine when it brings revelation then it's revealed and that's the way it was at pentecost so he's not saying see brother branham said you must receive it by experience right but then you have to yourself what experience i mean is it a tingling sensation a shiver up my spine will i speak in tongues do i have to do one of 10 different things i mean could it be 10 different emotional outbursts could it be 10 different forms of things do i have to do one of them you don't have to do any of them it can come without any sensation whatsoever the experience does not mean it's sensation the experience means you've gone through the experience of a changed life the baptism of the holy ghost is an experience where you were going one way living one way and then god revealed himself to you and opened up to you the word for this hour and it actually changed you and you started going another way you started thinking different feeling different acting different there was an actual change in your life you you know sometimes young people grow up in the message and they have questions about the baptism of the holy ghost because you know what i've always believed this and and i've always lived in a in a holy manner and i've always been under mom and dad's rule and i've never went wild drinking smoking cussing swearing i mean none of these things but but see it still has to come a change amen where all of a sudden it's not mom and dad's faith anymore i'm not here because of my friends anymore it's not a social religion for me anymore it's not the place i've always been the place i'm comfortable but now there's a desire for it to be personal to me to now if the whole church disbands something's changed in me now i want the word for me now i don't want it to listen to woman mom and dad said i don't want it to be a good boy i don't want it to be in good standing in the church i want that word for me change something changed and change your desires and now you don't want to be just floating along just drifting along just part of a church and go back out and do whatever you wanted before but it changed your actual desires you don't want to do anything else but what god wants you to do doesn't mean you've come to sin as perfection you'll mess up all the time that's not a problem for god god's already got an atonement laying there for that but your desire is not to mess up your desire is to be right but in trying to do right going along living in a fallen cursed body in a cursed world you stumble and fall brother branham said the devil's got traps laid for you and you're going to fall into them it's going to happen but that's what the atonement's for friends but there's got to be a an experience of a change something in you has to change that's the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost not a reformation not i'll do better next time not i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be bad anymore now i'm gonna be good that's not it friends it's a personal encounter with jesus christ and an awakening in the soul that actually changes you let's go on and read in the in the fourth seal now look at the promise of the last days and here we see it vindicated right before us the present coming of the holy spirit and works that he was supposed to do and we find it right among us see oh my now how could we hear something takes place i tell you friend when the real true sincere predestinated believer when that light strikes upon that seed something bursts forth to a new life that little woman at the well when those scholar priests had said well that's the devil he's a fortune teller he he is telling those people their fortune he's a devil but when that little woman with that predestinated seed amen here the priests they see the manifestation of the word for their hour and they call it the devil and here there's a woman who's living in a terrible life and a terrible condition but yet there's something inside of her that was there before the foundation of the world she didn't even know it was there she couldn't have explained anything about it but when she came in contact with jesus christ it came to life and it wasn't because she rubbed against him amen when the crowded streets and they were jostling about they rubbed against him the the the the evil wicked soldiers who beat him they punched him in the face and ripped his beard out and they touched him all over the place that didn't do them any good amen but it was when it was when he began to reveal something to her it awakened the seed inside it's not just touching jesus amen it's not just coming in contact it's a revelation and a revelation is based on understanding something about the word hallelujah further down i'll skip down just a little further and says in the day that we're living in why it should bring joy unspeakable and full of glory that little old woman as soon as that struck her my the seed burst forth hallelujah further down in the fourth seal he says now remember the bible says it in the last day now i want you to watch real close brother brother branham's going to tell a story amen and he's he's talking about the seed coming to life he's talking about the woman at the well and the pharisees rejecting but her receiving and he's continuing that same thought and so don't lose it because you're going to jump to something and jump back and i'll point it out to you but i want you to catch it now remember the bible says that in the last day that this antichrist would deceive the whole world there'd only be a small number whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and when that true vindication of the revealed truth of god's word strikes that heart he will strike the water and out yander with the holy ghost just as hard as he can and you can't stop him from doing it because the new life work worked forth and i was talking to a person not long ago he was trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that god created the heavens and the earth three in six days now what in the world is he saying he's talking about when the light when the truth of god's word strikes that heart he'll strike the water and out yonder and the holy ghost just as sure as you can you can't stop him from doing it because the new life's working and then he says somebody asked me aren't i ashamed to say that the world was created in six days pay close attention he's going back to genesis back to creation he's continuing the same thought he's not changing his mind i said that's what the bible said he said well we've got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old i said that didn't have anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning god created heavens and earth period see that's all now the world without form and void and i said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light struck it up come the trees and everything now he's talking about the new birth he's talking about the the revealed word coming to life then he goes to somebody questioning him about believing genesis and how could these things be when the world's millions of years old and he says that's true it is millions of years old but we find out in genesis 1 2 that it's covered with water and he said underneath there there's seeds laying there from another civilization or something and when the water parts and the light strikes it it comes to life now listen the same thing with the human being it's a type the mist is moved away and the revealed truth to the real seed laying there still germatized and the light of the gospel can strike it by true a vindication of the word it'll live it's got life in it outside of that it can't live it hasn't got no life in it them names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world will come forth just as certain as anything now you've got to catch the significance of what he's saying here friends your new birth has nothing to do with your crying out your new birth has nothing to do with your desperate pleading and fastings and all of that your new birth has everything to do with the seed gene of god an eternal predestinated seed laying in your soul that when the mist is moved away and the light strikes that seed it comes to life that's the new birth friends it may come with all kinds of sensations it may come with no sensations but that's exactly what the new birth is the new birth is that portion of god that he portioned out for this day that winds up in your body of flesh your clump of dirt that light laying there dormant amen it's germatized it's got life inside of it already amen it's just waiting for something it's waiting for the conditions to get right when god would move back the mist the waters from over your life and the part the darkness and let the word amend that eternal word of the s-o-n strike that seed and it'll come to life because it's already a dermatitis seed and it's already been planted in your dirt that is the new birth that's why we don't talk people into the new birth we don't beat them on the back of the altar for hours amen we don't have all-night prayer meetings for the new birth the new birth comes by revelation of the word of this hour and when that conditions are right when god moves back all the midst of your wrong thinking all the midst of your own ideas and he brings to light the true word for this hour and hits that seed it will come to life you may have sat in church all of your life and you wonder why i didn't receive the baptism holy ghost why i wasn't born again when i was 8 10 12 20 25 because the conditions weren't right yet god first has to get the conditions right he's got to move the water aside the mist from your life the fogginess and your thinking and the misunderstandings of the message the misunderstanding of your life move it aside and then then he'll let the revealed word of the hour hit that seed and it will come to life the new birth isn't speaking in tongues this is why brother branham could stand against the the whole pentecostal world in his day he knew exactly what the new birth was it's not speaking in tongues it's not dancing and shouting it is when that life that's laying there quickens and springs forth hallelujah he says in the third seal paragraph 236 what was it the light struck that seed that had been laying there that was spoke by god the seed was on the earth when god moved the water away and the sun hit it it come up that's right that's all it needed was sun it needed light and when the holy spirit in him moved away her past life and showed it her that light struck it and she said sir i perceive you're a prophet she said now i know that when messiah comes that's what he's going to be and we ain't had a prophet for hundreds of years we have never had a true prophet for hundreds of years and she said you tell me about my husband and told me how many i've had and so forth i don't understand this when messiah cometh well he's going to do that but who are you he said i am he that was it a harlem what was it a personal revelation of jesus christ she saw the word she saw what it was able to do and she said but who are you amen and he says she said are you the messiah she says i am he what did she receive a personal revelation of jesus christ in her day how come the pharisees couldn't receive that there was no seed in there but this little woman living in an adulterous condition there was a seed of life laying in there and when that light hit it oh it begins to quiver under the revelation and the mist is moving back and it's getting it's get the fog is lifting and all of a sudden the words are reminding her of her former life the words are reminding her of a previous civilization remember friends brother branham said those seeds were laying there from a previous civilization hallelujah you have come that seed gene of god inside of you has come from a previous civilization and it's laying here dormant in the earth waiting for the condition to get right and when the condition gets right it comes to life amen and begins to express the former life not the current life the former life that tree that was laying there in genesis 1 1 amen and 1 2 when covered over there's a palm tree laying under there the seed's been germatized it's in the ground it's laying there when the conditions are right it'll come up the same thing it was before it came from a palm tree it's got to be a palm tree it's got to express a palm tree and it's got to give palm tree life amen you have come from god as a seed from god come and planted in this earth and when you come forth you have to come forth as a son of god as an amateur god in the image of god giving forth the seed of god i love how the prophet can take something so simple and explain your whole life hallelujah jesus was speaking to her words from another civilization and it was moving back the mist he said he said that he said i am he that was it a harlot and the priest looked around and said well they'd have to answer to their congregation said don't fool with that fella he's possessed with the devil now that's the difference that's the the same thing today same thing today it's just exactly yep yes sir she knew it because the light struck it them fishermen woodsmen farmers tax collectors harlots they seen in him what the simple scripture said he would do and the pharisees couldn't see because of their tradition they couldn't see because they're traditions but the prostitute the farmers and all them they saw it all that was predestinated when the doubts rolled away the seed went to growing hallelujah can i read a little more these are the kind of quotes that get me stimulated this is like drinking new wine friends questions and answers on the seals now remember jesus come to be a witness as a savior of the world is that right why there was just people after people after people after races after people that never even know nothing about it it went right on just like the world know nothing about it but all the time that was going on in the world see why didn't he let them know he came and the ones that was predestinated to eternal life was the ones that received him it had been no good to say anything to the rest of them because he could not have redeemed them because they wasn't even redeemable say that again it had been no good to say anything to the rest of them because he could not have redeemed them because they wasn't even redeemable why the only way you could be redeemable is to be bought back and brought back to a former condition if their former condition wasn't in god they're not redeemable and if your former condition is not in god you're not redeemable that doesn't mean you can't be saved that the white thunder doesn't mean you can't enter into eternal life but the only thing being redeemed is the seed that came from god his redeeming back to himself so he didn't he doesn't have an obligation amen get this jesus christ does not have an obligation amen to to make sure that every human being that ever walked on the face of the earth here's the gospel message he's not obligated to that he's already put it in the stars he's already put it in the pyramid he's already showed it in his nature amen if people will just live true to what they see there can be mercy extended to them amen because he's given enough of himself enough of his word for them to line up to it but he's not obligated to give his secrets amen to them he only gives his secrets to the bride he only gives the secrets to that which is redeemable and by the secrets he redeems them back he draws them back into redemption which he paid for with his blood but he pulls them back by revealing the secrets nobody else can get the secrets friends the mysteries are still mysteries they're not believable they're fairy tales they're odd stories to most people but to you and i when we begin to hear what other people call fairy tales or false doctrine or doctrines of devils when we begin to hear that something inside began to quiver and to shake because there was words from another civilization that was words from my former life that was words from my origin because i come from god i go back to god when i hear the word of god it reminds me of where i came from like you sitting here this morning when you hear the pure unadulterated word of god something inside just gets stimulated all over again why because it's speaking of that other civilization it's speaking of your origin [Applause] something in you remembers not your brain amen not your human but the seed remembers amen and when it hears the word of god and comes contact with the living word it springs to life again friends hallelujah hallelujah where was i reading amen yeah there's people after people that know nothing about him there wasn't even redeemable why was it when these priests stood there he had to come to the spot because the predestinated was plotted out in there all around so he had to preach to them as a group amen see he's casting the net again he has to preach as a group because the predestinated is plotted out in there in israel so he's got to throw the net amen but it's not for some it's only for a few hallelujah he said no man can come to me unless my father draws him and the great scholars that should have known him said this man is beelzebub we'll not have this man rule over us and so forth will not do it but a little old prostitute with a life in her get this with a life in her this is before her new birth this is before she was born again there was a life inside of her because if you've got eternal life when did you get it because if you ever got it it's not eternal if it ever started it's not eternal life it could be perpetual life amen it could be life for eons and eons of time but that's not eternal life eternal life has no starting point so if you had an eternal seed gene of god down on the inside of you then it had to come from god and there's no beginning for god there's no beginning for you and so now she's laying there with a german thai seed friends you have to understand this she's laying there with a germatized seed with life in it ready to spring forth oh we're just gonna i just i've got to share something with you you know that we have to be virgin born and we have to be a virgin bride how are we going to be virgin born and a virgin bride when we came the wrong way naturally amen and we've believed all kinds of wrong things and lived a polluted life how can we be called a virgin bride we've believed false doctrines we've been in false systems of man we've we we have come up with our own doctrine sometimes and believe their own funny ideas amen how can we be virgin born and how can we be a virgin bride brother banham told us that this germatic seed was in the womb of your soul and it was sealed off to everything else friends you were already carrying a germatized seed when you came into this life and that means nothing else could get into that wound of your soul nothing else could get in there because it was already sealed it was already germatized you could flirt and have fornications and all kinds of stuff but all that's doing is polluting your mind your spirit realm is accepting false things your intellectual understanding of catholic doctrine and methodist doctrine and some of you might have been into hindu stuff in eastern religions it doesn't matter because that just went as deep as your mind but it never touched the womb of your soul because there was already a planted seed in there and because that seed was already planted your soul is virgin amen and when you hear the virgin word the pure word it brings you to virgin birth amen because it brings that virgin seed to life amen not what man had done in your mind when a man had polluted up with you when you're raising in your education none of that matters because there was already something sealed inside the soul when that word comes to that that word doesn't germinate the seed that word quickens it to life he came the first adam came amen a living soul the last adam came a quickening spirit and he's a quickening spirit here to quicken you and quicken you and quicken you and quicken you and quicken you how by the word hallelujah that's how your virgin bride not because you've lived a clean moral life that's not how your virgin bride your virgin bride because down inside of you was a predestinated seed of god and it was sealed away from the world but at the right time you would come in contact with your maker you would come in contact with your mate and it would bring forth that seed that was already planted there and that is the evidence of your virgin birth and that is the evidence amen of your virginity and now you can be married to him because the seed life proves your virgin hallelujah that should make you shout and dance especially if you've lived a filthy life especially if you've been caught up in false doctrines and false systems of man you should be as happy as happy could be because it's not what i did it's what he did amen he's always done it i've never done it he's always done it this is what grace has done god wanted a virgin bride so he made sure he would have a virgin bride amen hallelujah not because i was good enough not because i was strong enough but because there was already a seed germatic seed planted in my soul i could never be anything but the virgin bride of jesus christ because he will his counsel shall stand and he will do all of his will amen we're not changing his will by our conduct we're not changing his will amen by our lifestyle or by intellectually accepting that this is the message you're not going to change his counsel his counsel will stand and all he'll he will do all of his pleasure and it was his pleasure to have a virgin bride in this last day and it was his pleasure that i would be part of that and because of that he had to secure that from before the foundation of the world and he secured it by writing my name in the lamb's book of life and seeing to it that that portion of himself that would come out of him would be planted in this portion of the dirt right here and he made sure that i would come in contact with the s-o-n light it's all god's doing it's not your doing it's not what we've done it's what he's done because it's his pleasure it's his good will it's his purpose we're caught up in a plan so much bigger than our individual selves amen you could have been a prostitute on the street you could have been in prostitute religion amen you could have been a catholic priest serving out false doctrine all the time but if there's a predestinated seed of eternal life laying in there when that light comes to and it springs forth it's the evidence that you're virgin virgin bride to jesus christ hallelujah i don't know about you but that makes me happy that little prostitute with life in her predestinated to eternal life and her name is immortally in the word of god walk up there and the first time the light struck that little seed quickly she knowed it brother bam says in thinking man's filter notice the word cannot deny itself then it's satisfied or it's it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed that was eternal life that seed was already eternal life it already had life in it it was just laying dormant sleeping waiting for the appointed time in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there friends this is the message that was always in there that seed of eternal life was always amen was always in there all that the father hath given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost a thinking man's taste when a thinking man hears the word of god my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow for down in there is life and life connects with life that's why the word comes it connects with the life on the inside the word comes to the word the word quickens the word life comes to awaken life hallelujah that's why when you heard this message something inside of you stirred there was an attraction amen and it may have felt like the wrong kind of attraction to you at the time amen when i first heard this message i didn't want to be attracted to it i didn't want to believe it i didn't want it to be right amen it was inconvenient for me for this to be the truth i wanted to prove it wrong i wanted to fight against it amen i wanted to show that it was false but the more i read the more life came and the more i read more life came and finally that word that predestinated that that pure word awakened a predestinated seed lying inside of me i didn't go looking for it it found me that little seed that's laying in the earth it doesn't really know what it needs the german to come to life it's germatized it doesn't really know what the conditions are it's just laying there dormant sleeping inactive but it's got all the ingredients for life the conditions just have to get right it wasn't it wasn't the seed that found the sun it was the sun that found the seed it wasn't you that found the message it was god jesus christ found you and awakened you let's turn to first peter chapter 1. with all these quotes in our mind i want to read now first peter chapter 1 and take a fresh look at it first peter chapter 1. first peter 1 and 22. for i'm sorry let's go to 23. being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever let's read that again being born again not of corruptible seek see that's how you were born the first time you were born the first time if corruptible again so you have to be born again but you can't be born again the same way you were born the first time nicodemus asked this question and and the lord shot him down he says so so you're born again not of incorruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god that means your new birth is the incorruptible seed that's already there amen being born again by the word of god coming to the incorruptible seed and the incorruptible seed springing to life you're born again not of corruptable like you were before but you're born again of incorruptable by by the word of god it's the word of god that brings this to life and brings the new birth praise the lord hallelujah i think i have some more slides now you understand why brother branham typed this man age this wisdom this understanding with the new birth because you have to see the word for your age it's the word for your day the illumination the light the understanding that's bringing to bringing the seed to life modern events made clear by prophecy he says then if you are a son of god or a daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted so now you're made a creature a son of god manifested son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's right you was done there before the foundation of the world if it wasn't if you wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it so we we find out now you're made a creature son of god manifest son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour remember he knew what bed and ground you would be planted in and he planted you here not for not for your pleasure not according to your counsel but he planted you in this ground and in this time knowing what bed and ground you'd come forth he did it by his counsel for his pleasure and you're here to meet the challenge of the day that's why you're here you're not here for a three-bedroom house and two cars and a retirement account that's not why you're here if you get those things in life that's fine but that's not your purpose for existing your purpose for existing is to meet the challenge of this day hallelujah you see how distracting the devil constantly wants to distract from our main purpose because our main purpose is eternal life coming to manifestation as a son or daughter of god and it will influence this world and the devil wants to stop that if at any cost at all cost just don't let them manifest go to church just don't manifest go say whatever you want to say just don't live the real life amen don't let that seed life come to life please because nothing can stop that ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 says but god who is rich in mercy for this great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and this kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast what in the world have you got to do with any of this abraham believed god it was imputed on him for righteousness and he received the seal you believed god but not because of what you've done you were saved by but you were saved by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god and so now righteousness is imputed unto you because you believe god because of grace amen he's given you faith to believe his word and then he seals you into the kingdom it's what he's done not what you've done not of works unless any man should boast now listen for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them there's a purpose for you being here you as an individual person right now each one of us there's a purpose for you being here and that purpose is an eternal purpose and that is to manifest the word for your day that is the meet the challenge for your day so god when he portioned himself out amen he portioned out and he made he made it come forth amen in an hour and a day that this portion would meet the challenge for that day and this portion would meet the challenge for that day like i've said before you would have been a miserable christian if you came forth in luther's day you have been totally unsatisfied if you came for in the wesley's day because the attribute of god in you is desiring something more amen than a reformation is designing something more than sanctification it desires the full manifestation of the full word of god and nothing but that will satisfy amen no distraction of the world no other idea is going to satisfy what god has planted there the only thing that will satisfy the desire that's in that seed is the full word that's why you were planted in this day that's why you didn't come up in luther's day and why you didn't come up and known unto god are all his works from before the foundation of the world he knew where you'd be he knew what you would come forth he knew what he was going to do it's not a mystery to god hallelujah god hath before ordained that we should walk in them for his pleasure according to his counsel you're here in this hour to manifest him the amen says now i've got another thing here i want to notice notice i was not one of the four beasts that said don't touch the oil and the wine did you notice that the four beasts had been talking but watch let me just read out here just a little bit said now a measure of penny for a wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine the wine and the oil now look here and i said i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts what what was it the lamb amen it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said it why he's going to take his own that belongs to him he's redeemed it amen don't you touch that oil no sir not the four beasts but the lamb was the one that said it now oh my the lamb not the four beasts didn't announce this the lamb said itself when the four beasts said come and see and then they went and they seen it like that and he said a measure of wheat for a penny and four see so much this and so much barley but then the lamb cried out right among them and said don't but don't hurt the oil the wine and the oil amen i just i just put this on here because this is where i want to finish up today we want to show that that your being here is predestinated amen the seed inside of you came from god and your birth your new birth is nothing more than that seed coming to life period that's it what happens with it anything can happen with it any kind of sensation or none at all but the thing that matters is that seed came to life that's the new birth you can dance and shout and run the aisles and do anything you want amen it doesn't matter for not if there's no seed there there's no new birth amen that is why there's no new birth and denominationalism there's no new birth outside the message because it takes the word it takes the life to bring forth the life it takes jesus christ the quickening spirit who is the word to quicken those to quicken all those seeds to life there's no new birth outside the message amen there's only new birth amen where where that seed is coming to life that's the new birth hallelujah amen but here the lamb he's he's saying now this is the first time he speaks in the first three seals it's always one of the four beasts who are saying come and see come and see they're the announcers of the seal but now we get to a place where now they're announcing the seal but then jesus is saying wait a minute amen he's putting limitations on the dark horse rider think about this the dark horse rider goes out with a scale in his hands and he's going to strip the world of its economy and he's going to strip the believers of everything they have amen he's going to sell them natural life in place of spiritual life and he's going to strip them down to a famine condition and god and jesus christ knows that he's going he declared this before it ever happened amen this black horse this seal that was broken it was broken when john was on earth amen and this wasn't going to happen for hundreds and hundreds of years so jesus is sitting there looking at it knowing that it's going to come to the dark ages for the believer knowing that he's going to ride he's going to have a scale that he's going to measure out natural life he knows all of that but in doing that he says you can sell that for a penny and you can sell this for a penny i'm going to let you sell your natural life i'm going to let you substitute but do not touch the oil and the wine that means the lamb is in absolute control of the horse riders and we find it that to me is one of the greatest revelations in the seals one of the greatest in the third seal amen is not what the black horse is or what the man is the greatest revelation to me is that black horse rider cannot do anything outside of the boundaries that the lamb put on it when the lamb said you don't touch it he can't touch it when the lamb said you can do this then he can do that but he cannot do what the lamb did not give him permission to do hallelujah we know now that our lives are orchestrated our trials are under control there's no horse rider going to ride in your life outside of the boundaries that god has placed there he cannot outwit god he cannot outdo god he cannot outflank god but god is already predetermined before it happened these are the boundaries you'll not cross these boundaries remember we're here for his purpose his pleasure to manifest his word to meet the obstacles of our day that means there's going to be obstacles let's go to romans together i want to read through romans just a little bit hallelujah friends these are the greatest revelations we have ever seen if i can find romans i'll turn to it romans 8. romans chapter 8 verse 26. i tell you what friends we know this bible we've heard it we've read it but oh my now when i read it it's just different this is opening more and more and more romans chapter 8 verse 26 likewise the spirit also helped with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god now listen he doesn't make intercessions on the saints according to your will because if he did you wouldn't go through any trials but your trials are ordained how else will you be an overcomer how else will you meet the obstacle for your day the challenge for your day how else will you manifest the word jesus manifests the word against opposition noah manifests the word against opposition amen abraham manifest the word against opposition moses manifest the word against opposition amen the the disciples manifest the word against opposition how are you going to manifest the word without opposition it's impossible verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose not called many are called but few are chosen but there is the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified whom he justified then he also glorified friends for you it's a finished work you're already justified you're already called you're already chosen you're already glorified so when jesus comes to the place where he can say father glorify me with the glory that i had with you before you can say the same thing because in the mind of god you're already been glorified you're not going to be lost you're not going to fail you're not going to miss anything friends all that he's calling for is a greater surrender a greater surrender but you're not going to miss a thing friends it's already finished in the mind of god you've already been glorified and when we get to the end of our earthly journey we can say god would you glorify me with the glory that i had with you before hallelujah what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us hallelujah does that scripture mean more to you now than it did before amen of god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us oh how shall he not with him also freely give us all things whom shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth amen how can you lay anything to my i'm virgin born i've come to the virgin birth amen by the pure word has brought me back into a virgin condition just like i was in the beginning he's brought me back to my ought to be conditioned amen in my soul he's returned me back to my ought to be conditioned to my virgin condition what about all those sins what sins i have no sins well i saw you do something wrong i didn't do it amen because it can't a man cannot sin because the seed remaineth in him i cannot disbelieve this word amen you can see all kinds of manifestations and false but i cannot disbelieve this in my soul my mind can get confused i can have doubts in my brain but that doesn't have anything to do with what really matters what matters is that portion that came from god that's dwelling inside this tabernacle of flesh that's the part that god's watching that's what god cares about that's what's being redeemed friends that that came from god and that part of me cannot disbelieve the word of god no matter what you see on the outside i have no sin i have no more consciousness of sin because the seed has been quickened to life and i believe and accept and receive the word of god amen remember when when we come to the pure blood of jesus christ amen the blood that's flowing fresh and clean this morning not that dry not the blood that dried on a post amen in galgotha not that blood not the blood that dried amen in the ground but when we come to the blood the life of the blood the life that was in that blood that's flowing today that's flowing this morning by the by the word being preached when we come to that life when you receive that blood life that blood life is the clorox bleach amen and your sin drops into that clorox bleach and it disbands and it goes right back to the originator of sin which is the devil himself so when you've come to that life friends when you've come under that fresh atonement when you've come under that blood of jesus christ which is the spirit of god today when you've come under that it's taken your sins and it put it back to the devil [Applause] it's not yours anymore that's why there's no record of your sin because the record of your sin transferred to the originator of sin and you've gone back to your original ought to be conditioned in your soul there's a transfer that takes place by the redemptive blood of jesus christ and it doesn't do you it doesn't do you any good to try to scrape dried blood off of a post everybody knows there was bloodshed there but where is his blood now where can i be covered in the atoning blood of jesus christ today where is it it's in the spirit friends the spirit is the life that was inside of that blood when jesus walked that life has come back to us and that is atoning for us it is washing us it is removing our sins away and that brings me back to a virgin condition and that puts my sin on the devil the originator of the world oh praise god the things this prophet has told us friends why does he fight against you because he has to bear now finally after all of these years he now has to bear the iniquity for his own crimes he now has to be he's the transgressor before he comes down and he does crimes and everybody else has to pay for it right amen eve falls adam leaves the word amen they they fall from what they were told to do and now everybody else has to suffer and the devil comes down and he shows his unbelief and he works and everybody suffers but now when we come back to the true atonement in this age it brings us back to our ought to be conditioned and puts all of the crimes back on him and now he's caught red-handed friends that's why he hates this word that's why he hates this revelation that's why he hates you because now he has to bear all that stuff he's put on you all that manipulating your human spirit manipulating your thinking manipulating people around you to get you to fall to get you to sin to get you to do things you ought not to do amen he's the one who does it he sows it into you then he stands back and lets you pay for it but through the pure atonement through the true true atonement now he's got to pay for his own crimes hallelujah only through the atonement does he have to pay without the atonement he doesn't have to pay your sin remains on you you go to a judgment with your own sin but through atonement he has to pay that's why he hates this message it's this message that will defeat him in this day who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect verse 33 it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yet rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as is written for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter name and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord you know what that tells me that the devil will try famine and nakedness and sword and peril and pestilence and that means that we will overcome famine and nakedness in perilous times amen this god has not called us to live an easy life he's called us to be overcomers and manifest his word in this day none of these things shall separate us when you go read hebrews 11 go read hebrews 11 at the end it said those who who who received their dead back to life they stopped the mounds of lion they stopped the flames amen they were sawn asunder they were persecuted they were chased from the they were hid in the rocks and the dens of the caves they went about in sheepskins and goat skins destitute and afflicted hebrews 11 is a chapter about overcoming faith the the heroes of the faith amen the heroes of the faith you want to see a hero of a faith he's in a camel skin hid in the cave chased from place to place persecuted afflicted stone they threw rocks at him they spit on him they mocked him they scourged him how did he how was he an overcomer because he never left his faith he was a manifest son of god despite the trials despite the circumstances no matter what happens he was going to overcome hallelujah friends oh mine jeremiah 1 4 says then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations do you know jeremiah was referred to as the weeping prophet jeremiah wrote the book of lamentations jeremiah's life was a difficult life of affliction persecution imprisonment and rejection and here's what god says before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee before his earthly tabernacle was even formed in the belly god knew him and before he came us forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the nations if he would say that to you and i we'd walk around like this to hear what he said about me he knew me i'm predestinated i'm elected i'm called to be a prophet to the nations but he was called to manifest the word in his day against all obstacles against all odds in the face of all persecutions amen he did what god asked him to do regardless of what god asked him god asked him to lay naked on his side he lay naked on his side god asked him to go say something to a king he said it to a king if many went in prison he went in prison amen he stayed true to the word of god and he manifest his word for his day no matter what happened to him why because before he was even formed god and his mind had already ordained the works that he would do we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them there's a work for you to do there's a work for me to do and it doesn't matter obstacle it doesn't matter what we have to overcome we are made to overcome god put him on the earth to overcome god put jeremiah on the earth to be afflicted to be rejected to write the book of lamentations god had already ordained all of that for jeremiah so he put something inside of jeremiah that would overcome against all lives god has called you to overcome every kind of situation known to man the bride of jesus christ is not coming always out of pink decorated rooms they're coming through all kinds of marriage situations all kinds of children situations all kinds of things and sometimes you scratch your head on why why did i go through that and why did i go through this and why was my childhood this way and how come my daddy didn't love me and how come somebody abused me and beat me and why was i neglected and why did nobody in school love me why didn't i ever have a home think about it friends god has ordained it so god has called it to be this way listen to job i'm going to read from job chapter 1 verse 6. now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and the skew with evil then satan answered the lord and said does job fear god for not hast thou not made a hedge about him about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face now here's a challenge that god gives to satan yes saying where have you been i've been roaming to earth you're walking up to and fro and and he says have you ever considered job you're out there tempting and trying and people are falling away and you're having your successes over there and you're having your successes over here but i've got one that you won't beat i've got one that you cannot defeat have you ever considered job do you think god didn't know what was inside of job do you think he didn't already know what would happen if he come under persecution if he'd come under extreme pressure what was going to happen to job god already knew amen he knows known to god are all his works from before the foundation that's either true or it's not true friends we were ordained amen unto good works amen so job he says jobs everything's going right and god put a hedge of protection about him and he's got massive wealth and he's got children he's got respect and why does he have all of those things god is just setting him up god's just moving in a position so that he can demonstrate the seed life so he can demonstrate a life of faith these things can go along so well for us so long sometimes and everything's just cruising right along and families happy kitties are happy job is good everything's going good and all of a sudden a series of things can happen in your life boom boom boom boom and all of a sudden the car's broke down you can't make the mortgage payment lost the job everything's falling apart and all of a sudden we start saying what did i do wrong what did i do wrong what did i do wrong god just brings you up so that he can bring you down so that he can show the world nothing can defeat a seed of god he asked him if you consider job he says if put you put forth thine hand now this is satan talking to to god put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny don't touch the oil and wine all that he has in your hand don't touch him it's the same god all the time friends the same one that's here in job directing the trial for job is the same one that's directing through the dark ages and the third seal is the same one that's directing the trial in your life he's the same one who's put the limits on satan he's the same one who's called for called for the manifestation of the word in your life who's ordained you into good works who has allowed the devil to have certain access and has put boundaries on his access it's the same god all through the bible he's not changing he says in deuteronomy i want you just to listen deuteronomy 8 verse 1 all the commandments which i command thee this day shall you observe to do that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee god led them through all kinds of trials for 40 years to humble them and to prove them to know what was in thine heart whether thou would us keep his commandment or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger god would suffer you to hunger suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live he suffered you to hunger why so he could give you a revelation that's what he says i proved you through the wilderness journey to see whether you loved me or not whether you would keep my commandments he told abraham to go crucify isaac and to go sacrifice isaac and he goes to sacrifice isaac and at the last second before he plunges the knife into his heart he stops him he says now i know that thou lovest to me god knew all along he was just proving abraham when he called when he called paul i'm just trying to lay out some things here just pay close attention when he called paul he says he told agabus against was afraid to go up and and talk to him and he says go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me he's a chosen vessel unto me inside of him is a seed there's an attribute that's got to be expressed and he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer from my name's sake what a calling friends god when he called paul he didn't make no bones about it he called paul and he says i will show him what things he must suffer for my name sake why because he's a chosen vessel and because the chosen vessel he has to suffer this isn't good american doctrine this is good christian doctrine he has to suffer because he's a chosen vessel he looks at peter he says peter when you were young you girded yourself and went where you want but when you were old you'll stretch forth thy hand and another will gird thee and lead you where you would as not signifying what death that he should die from he told us he told his disciples before he departed he says amen he says in this world you shall have tribulation that's a promise he's not telling them a flowery bed of ease he's not telling them rosie tells what's he telling him he's telling him you'll be afflicted tormented stoned run from city to city when paul starts rehearsing his life and he starts telling about i was i was went from city to city stoned and i received stripes this many times and all of these horrible things happened to me he wasn't complaining he was boasting of what faith and god would do he was boasting what god was able to do through a human being that though you'd be beaten smitten left in the deep it doesn't matter you can't kill this seed you can beat it you can stone it you can reject it you can spit on it you can laugh at it but you cannot stop the seed from believing the word and you cannot stop the seed from manifesting the word there's nothing the devil can do to you to get you to stop he can take your loved one he can take your child amen he could upset your whole world and though he slayed me yet will i serve him that's the seed life coming forth that's a faith life amen coming forth brother ma'am said in the message believeth thou this and i just want to read a few quotes then then wrap it up here now zechariah is getting himself in order getting his church ready zechariah is the high priest or great priest rather he was to burn incense he had he had a home that was consecrated to god god give us some more homes like that yes sir they believed god and waited on god and elizabeth his wife was barren she was way past the age now and she was barren and had prayed for years for god to give them children but seemingly he had not done it sometimes god holds off to the very last moment just to see what you will do about it it says and be certain of god and the woman as she's seen the crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up and said lord i've done all that i know to do when you've done everything that you know how to do and met every requirement that god has required that's where faith takes hold that's where faith comes in if you've met every requirement that god required you to do then sometimes god tests your faith to see what kind of reaction you'll have on your action oh he's good at that just it just proves whether you really believe what you think you believe you know he does that many times in the message when your eyes were open they knew him notice as they went now two of them cleopas and his friend was on their road to emmaus it was sunday morning so they was on their road over there talking they was going along the road real sad my they were really let down with something looked like a veil and god lets things happen like that he does that purposely just to test you now let me get this before you straight so that you understand that every son that cometh to god has to be child trained he's got to be tested every son if you've never tested you're not a son if you if you can't stand the chi tasman of god then you're illegitimate and not a child of god you claim god is your father you say oh i can't believe well that just shows that god is not your father see you would get it now notice the testing god tests every one of his children all that come to him must first be tested tried proved it says and how can i overcome in the days of daniel time there were four overcomers that could stand the test of fire and lion now we're expected to be tested are you expected to be tested don't be disappointed then when it comes when everything goes wrong don't get disappointed you expected it says johan who expects to be tested all right then don't complain because you expected it to be tested and it's not you being tested as that seed life on the inside that's being tested god's proving his children and he's manifesting himself we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson my brother back there he that cometh to god must first be tested tested with the word that's god's test you believe it he that cometh to god must be tested the only show that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes on you when the test comes on you can't overcome unless there's a test given to you and when test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you i believe it it's written in the scriptures peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time it's one good evidence to us that god is with us when we're tested for all children of god are tested and tried job says when i am tested i shall come forth as gold how many has that kind of faith that when i'm tested i shall come forth as gold see so many times test comes into people's lives and and things happen that they never expected to happen never planned for never anticipated amen there's death that sets in and sickness and and abandonment and all kinds of things and they get tested and they never expected it to come this way and then all of a sudden you see that they just can't hold to god anymore they just can't believe the word because it didn't happen the way i expected it friends the word believes i mean faith the seed believes whether it happens like you expect it or not it doesn't matter if it happens according to the way you desire it it doesn't matter if it happens opposite to the way you thought it would be belief faith always believes the word of god the seed gene of god will always come back to the anchor and the word of god and will anchor itself there and hold on no matter what happens in my life we don't come to christianity to have an easy life amen we come here because we believe the word amen we give our life to god we surrender to him because we're part of him we've come from him we're going back to him and now god when he wanted to display himself on the earth he did it through one man that was jesus christ and look at the life of jesus christ no riches no wealth no place to lie his head right roaming around from place to place amen loved and then hated accepted and rejected amen until they wanted to kill him amen they called him beelzebub they called him a false prophet they said he was mad they said he was illegitimate born what was happening god wanted to display his attributes god wanted to be on display and the only way that he could do it was when negative was unleashed when the enemy was unleashed on jesus christ then jesus christ manifest the word and the only way that he can be manifested in this day is when evil is unleashed upon the children of god and they overcome by faith in the word only they don't overcome by their credit card they don't overcome by their favorite doctor they overcome by the word and the word only and they hold the faith despite everything else it doesn't matter what they say it doesn't matter what they do i believe the word of god and that is what god is looking for in this day [Music] amen the prophet of god said god always has overcomers he's had overcomers in every age they're always every time and every age that there's been on the earth god has always had somebody he could put his hand on as a witness in the earth look at that as a witness in the earth i want you to hold on to that he's never been without a witness though sometimes just one but somebody overcome now like the saints of old it says in the message i know it's those crucial hours that press us on those sacred sands it was in the bible and remember no matter how great the distress is satan cannot take your life until god is finished with you there is nothing can happen to you unless god permits it penny of wheat a measure wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou touch not the oil in the wine unless god permits it there's no evil can come unless god permits it and it's for your good he's working that let's think there when the floods come to destroy the world it could not destroy noah noah could not be destroyed because that god had a work for him to do and one day down in a great nation under a great bondage there was some hebrew children that we know as shadrach meshach and abednego and it came to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done their faith was put to a test and when their faith is put to a test they won't fail stay right with what you believe and when their face faith was put to a test they went through a crucial hour and not only did they go to an ash heap but they went to a fiery furnace but satan could not destroy them for god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope i know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope here we are assured that god is able to deliver us from thy fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to the image if god doesn't answer your prayer will you still serve him if he doesn't heal your body will you still serve him if he takes your family member from you will you still serve him that's what he's looking for friends satan could not take them he could not drown no in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god do you ever thank god for your trial thank them thank you god for this trouble that's come upon me thank you for this affliction thank you for this rejection because i know you're in control of all things and if you say that i need to go through this now i'm happy to go through there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i've liked that poem or psalm must i be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas we ask for comfort and peace god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our conference is just beyond the river it wasn't until the hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of man stand among them think about it friends a manifestation of jesus christ before jesus was a baby in a manger when was he manifest when they went to the fire think about that their troubles produced the son of god standing among them in breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went to the fire did the comforter appear not until you went into sickness did the healer appear not until you went to financial ruin did the provider appear not until amen not until you lost loved ones not until not until you were in distress that the comforter show up not until you were absolutely down to the last wire when there was nothing left of yourself that the el shaddai show up amen god allows these things to show himself amen god allows these things to prove his word but it's god doing it friends god's doing it why he wants to see your reaction he wants the the life to be made manifest it was daniel had purposed in his heart that he not defiled himself with the things of the world and he was forced through a trial whether he'd pray to god or go to the lion's den but it was after the heat was put on and he was thrown into a lion then that after that he saw the angel of the lord standing in the midst of him keeping away that great pillar of fire standing between him and the lions and the lions could not get him because he went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his god was able to deliver him from that it was abraham after he'd seen the ground get barren and the drought come and lot separate himself and go down to live deliciously in the world it was after he had heard the whines and cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained the land that god gave him and told him to sojourn in and as on that day after he'd been tried to his patience was at the end it was on that day that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with elohim under the oak that day it was after he'd suffered his trials after he went through the troubles that he'd been through that god appeared to him in a form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was sarah and said she laughed at him in the tent it was there that abraham called him elohim it was after the trial in tribulation oh if the church could only wake to itself today to find that after the troubles and trials and laughs and made fun of the things the church has been through the pentecostal church that was that we see god in our midst doing great signs and wonders all these great men that would take much of our morning service to go in to mention that they went through trials and saw god they went through trials and saw angels they went through trials revelations and saw signs and wonders and things but oh none of them saw what job saw all of the men after seeing angels and seeing god and all these things they never saw nothing give them hope beyond the grave but job saw the resurrection he saw easter he saw the thing that comforts every heart then when he did oh that the words would be printed in a book oh that they would be engraved with iron pen on a rock why because i know that my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms destroy this flesh but in my flesh yet will i see him all of these things friends are ordained of god the situations that you come through were ordained of god their mom and dad's situation whether you even had a mom or dad it was ordained by god amen god is manifesting himself in this world amen through his seed and his seed is overcoming every obstacle by the word the word will overcome everything that you've ever faced everything that you've ever been through the word will overcome it friends it's the word that will give you victory this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our faith that's in what faith in the sanctuary of the word of god faith on the firm foundation of the word why does he let these things come why is it coming to you to prove you why was elizabeth barren all those years so god could prove that he could open a womb why did the three hebrew children go to the fire furnace so he could show himself as a deliverer a friend that sticketh closer than a brother why did the things happen in your life the thing that you scratched your head over all your life why did this happen he did it to prove you he did it to prove himself it was when they were in the fiery furnace that they saw the son of god it was when daniel was in the lions then he saw the pillar of fire amen it's when you've been through your darkest hour that you've seen a deliverer it's when you've been down to the last wire when sickness has got you wrung out amen when disease has taken its toll that you've come to your last hour that you see god how many people have come come amen through the prayer line brother branham they are the last moments the last moments before they die and god is showing i can heal cancer i can heal epilepsy i can heal they had to have it so he could show that he could heal it there had to be impossible for doctors to heal people had to come to situations that were impossible for doctors to heal so that god could show in this day that he could heal impossible situations and if that was god's lot for me if he wanted me to be the one that got down to 50 pounds amen had no more moisture in my body couldn't even blink my eyes because i was so close to death if god wanted me there so that he could show his mighty power then i say let me be there whatever god desires is what i want for my life whatever is proportioned to his counsel amen according to his pleasure that's what i want if he wants me to go through dark ages and dark nights and suffer i'll suffer for him because if i suffer i shall reign we get the wrong idea of christianity get the wrong idea of the message just because the profit could come and cancer could be healed and diabetes could be healed and epilepsy could be healed we think that he was here just to deliver us from all of our troubles that's not what he came for that's not what the word came for the word came to call out the seed god wants to use you that thing that you've suffered with all your life because it happened to me when i was a child and it never should have happened can the word overcome that see remember when we come to the revelation of the hour into that clorox bleach where does the sin go back on the head of the one who originated it in heaven now he's bearing the iniquity for it not me now he's holding the blame not me god has a desire to defeat the devil i want you to listen real close for just a minute god has a desire this whole life is planned by god for a purpose the fall in the garden was planned by god whatever happened before and we find the earth void and without form it's in a form of judgment and god has judged it for whatever reason we don't understand we know there's been a war that broke out in heaven and and and and that war now is going to spill on the earth in the garden of eden and god creates a paradise and he puts his children there he gives them his word and he knows that they're going to fall he created them in such a way that they were able to fall why because he does it all by his own counsel according to his pleasure he can't make him fall but he sets him up in a situation where he knows that they'll fall why because there's something he's got to accomplish there's something god wants to do in this life he wants to manifest himself he wants to be known he wants to be proved he wants to be demonstrated in mighty power as a mighty conqueror so he's got to let things fall into ruin so that he can be a conqueror and see the devil takes the battle from heaven and he brings it down to earth now remember when we first started in the seals we showed that the false vine started in heaven but the false vine will have an end there's judgment coming to the false vine now think friends think with me god has to stay righteous and holy and he has to work according to his own laws when war broke out in heaven he didn't just take the devil and kill him you wonder why why didn't he just absolutely destroy him he has the power to but god does everything according to his laws he does everything in justice and and so now god's got this plan and it's all working according to his plan he has a desire in his mind he has something he wants to accomplish and it's all working but now his seed would be sown into the earth friends and that seed would be tried and tested and persecuted but it would overcome every situation everything that the devil would put against it it would overcome the devil would try this it would overcome then he would try this and it would overcome there was nothing that the devil could do that the seed couldn't overcome see friends that's part of the plan that's part of the purpose you and i are soldiers in this bottom we have signed up for the army of the lord and there's two great forces fighting and it's christ and it's the devil and now we're on christ's side and we're attributes of christ and when we overcome we seal his doom when we take faith in the word overcome the situations we seal and signify his destruction god is depending on you and i this whole battle is depending on you and i if the devil can defeat one attribute of god he's defeated god if the devil can stop one son of god one expressed attribute that peace of the father that came off of the father that landed in your flesh whether you be 13 or 14 or 15 or a 17 year old young man it doesn't matter where it falls if it falls in you if he can stop that defeat that seed move it to unbelief then he has beat god so where is the battle now right here if he can stop one part of god he stopped god if he can defeat one he's defeated god that's why he'll unleash every bit of tarot he's permitted to unleash against you he wants to stop one but if god can overcome he's defeated if the devil can win on one attribute god's defeated if all of the attributes of god can win he's destroyed now do you see where you're at do you see your part in the battle it's not about here or over there or over there it's about me the portion of god that's in me overcoming every obstacle and now you're going to stand as a witness on the day of judgment friends when somebody comes up and their judgment's not fair and said you just don't understand you don't understand your word wouldn't work i had no daddy to raise me you could stand and say i had no daddy to raise me and the word works but you don't understand i was neglected and abused as a child there'll be somebody that will be able to stand up and say i was neglected and abused as a child but the word works but you don't understand i lived in laodicea and you could stand up and say i lived in laodicea but you don't understand i mean the doctors told me there was no hope how could i have faith and you can stand up and say the doctors told me there was no home but i waited for 25 years for my healing abraham can stand and say i waited 25 years for the promise of a baby see friends all these things has to be why so that god can destroy your enemy and he's allowing he's allowing you to fall into every situation imaginable because god's got to overcome the devil in every way you had a hateful dad you had an unloving mom you had no mom and dad you were abused you were beat up as a kid you were mocked and you laughed at god's going to overcome everything and the devil's going to be utterly defeated amen he didn't put you through that for you to be defeated and downtrodden and downcast all your life god has allowed his seed to come that way so that you can be an overcomer and you can be a witness on that day and you will stand there on that day when that final judgment is met out to lucifer himself and you will be a witness amen that he is defeated some through the fire some through the flood some through great trials but all through the blood see suffering is instrumental in defeating the devil things go wrong and you toss up your hands and say oh why is god oh it's just an opportunity for you to win again it's an opportunity for god to defeat the devil on one more battlefield and one more obstacle you were put here to be an overcomer when you read through genesis or revelations chapter two and three you read the church ages every every church age has a message message to the overcomers because every age has overcomers in this age will have overcomers too praise the lord what have you gone through in your life has it been unfair has it been unrighteous has it been terrible those all may be true but has it been for no purpose is it just suffering for no reason just to suffer does it make no sense i'm telling your friends it makes sense it's for a reason it's for a purpose the lamb is in complete control of your trial nothing's going to happen unless god has provided for you unless god has allowed it if you've been waiting 10 15 years to be healed keep waiting if you've been waiting for loved ones for 10 15 20 years keep waiting whatever you let faith have its final victory it doesn't matter what the test is jesus looked at peter one day said peter the devil desires as sifty as wheat he never said but i've stopped him the devil desires as sifty as we but you know i told him he's not allowed he permitted it why because peter had to come forth as gold all the gold that's locked down inside of you has to come forth some through the fire some through the flood some through great trials but all through the blood the seals are here friends not just to unlock the mystery of the church ages but it's unlocked the mystery of your life we have to stop thinking as victims we're not victims how can god's attribute be victimized how can how can god's children be victims in this world amen god is just setting the devil up for destruction do you think jesus when jesus stood before pilate and his visage was so marred above any man that he could not be recognized as a man they had ripped his beard out they had put a crown of thorns on his head they had beat him 39 times with a web do you think he was downcast do you think he was defeated do you think he was pitiful do you think he was sorry do you think god felt sorry for him the scripture says it pleased god to bruise him every time they beat him the devil was getting that much closer to defeat every stripe that they put on his back was for my healing every stripe was victory over the devil every time they mocked him victory over the devil when they took him and they nailed him to the cross amen before that when they rejected him they called him up and he said behold thy king and they rejected him and they wanted a murderer instead he was getting victory god was winning every step of the way every blow every strike every situation god was defeating the devil and the same thing's true in your life every affliction you go through every bit of torment from the devil every demon that oppresses you he's going to be utterly defeated every time he comes against you you're going to have victory every time he afflicts you you're going to win god is going to prove that the seed will come through indestructible undefeated amen it'll never be defeated when they went through the trials they saw angels they had revelations it was the affliction that bought the manifestation when they were in the fiery furnace they saw the they saw the son of god when they were in the lions then they saw the angel of the lord the pillar of fire all these things happened when they needed to happen friends but there's another time of pressure coming upon the bride called the squeeze what a little produce the spoken word manifestation of god we're not afraid of those things it's the final destruction of the devil from the bride age is his final loosing of his powers the final defeat of him and we're not afraid to face it friends when persecution comes when trials come when mocking and scourging when they close this church you better get excited because all the pressure will do is manifest the son of god again and the pressure will come and it will squeeze down and it'll tighten up and persecution will come and god will manifest himself again you think god's going to stop it he's not going to stop it he's already prophesied it's coming he won't stop it but what will he do he will use it for a great manifestation of himself again and we will see the lord high and lifted up in the in the in in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says then they've laughed at her they've mocked her the churches have rejected her but then he'll take her and lift her up here and say this was her and then away he'll go with him what's he going to do trap the devil by his own devices when they were crucifying jesus he was trapping the devil by his own devices and when he's afflicting you god is trapping him by his own devices he will be defeated don't don't lose faith friends hold on with faith you're built to be an overcomer these things have to be so that there's a witness on the earth in this age that the word works in every situation the word works and you can stand there on that day and say i can testify it works let's stand musicians if you could please come the greatest revelation of the third seal to me is that the lamb's in control of it all when you slip into your dark ages and everything around you is dark the lamb's in absolute control he's put limits he's put boundaries and that's only there so he can be made manifest let's just pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and for this word lord we just ask god that you would reveal to us lorn as you have through the preaching of the word your purpose and trials your purpose and our sufferings lord if there's any here lord that they just don't understand why things in their life has been the way it is why they've had to suffer why they've had to be afflicted i pray that you'd go to them now lord and let the dove of your holy spirit coo in their ear and reveal to them that it has to be this way so that you can get victory over the devil so that the end of the age is when the lucifer is taken and cast into the lake of fire and annihilated completely lord let us realize it'll be worth it all then god does he punches and he kicks and as he whips and as he nails to the cross he's being defeated every blow give us a great lord a great vision a great revelation

overcome there was no situation there was no trial there was no dynamic there was nothing that this seed did not overcome and if he's chosen you to be a witness on that day then you'll be a faithful
