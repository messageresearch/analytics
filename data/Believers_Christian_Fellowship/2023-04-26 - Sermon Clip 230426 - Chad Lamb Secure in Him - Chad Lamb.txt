TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I love him because he first loved me and now because I love him there's nothing I need to do in the way of Works to earn his love amen or or to or to Merit salvation amen but now because I love him amen now I want to do things that please him not so that he'll love me and save me but because he loved me amen he extended his grace to me and saved me because he first loved me and now there's a reciprocation in my heart that loves him and now my works is not a merit to attain anything in God my works are simply a love token back to him praise God and so now you know we've been talking on this line for uh several Services now how does kills legalism because legalism to me legalism kills Freedom amen because now everything we do we do to get we do because we do out of fear of like I'm afraid of if I don't do this I'll be lost if I don't do this I'll be rejected if I don't do this a curse will come in my life or if I do this I'll be blessed if I do this I'll receive if I do this I'll get and when we when we come that way then there's really no unselfish love because all of our love is based on ourself so legalism is a disaster because if if my wife only did for me because she was afraid I would reject her that she's not doing for me because she loves me she's doing for me for her or if one of my children only comes and does an act of kindness and service to me so that in the next breath they can ask for five bucks to go do something then they never brought me a cup of coffee because they loved me they brought me a cup of coffee because they love themselves that makes sense so now that this the genuineness of Revelation amen takes us back into the genuine love of God that I don't need to do anything to earn his love neither can I do anything to remove me from his love my I'm secure in him
