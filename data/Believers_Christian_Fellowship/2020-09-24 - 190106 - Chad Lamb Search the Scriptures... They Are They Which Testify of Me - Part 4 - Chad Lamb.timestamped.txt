[5:40] bit of a break without having service on
[5:42] wednesday so
[5:43] i'm eager to be together again amen
[5:46] let's take our bibles while we're
[5:47] standing and turn to the gospel of john
[5:50] john chapter 5 verse 39 search the
[5:52] scriptures for in them you think you
[5:54] have eternal life
[5:56] and they are they which testify of me
[5:58] we've heard this scripture before
[6:00] so now we're on part 4 on this the lord
[6:02] just opened up some more and
[6:04] i can't get away from it so we're just
[6:06] going to stay with it amen
[6:07] and not try to get away from it let's
[6:09] bow our heads
[6:10] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:12] jesus for this day and
[6:14] for all that you're doing for us lord as
[6:16] your children how you keep revealing
[6:18] yourself to us and opening your word
[6:20] and letting us see you more and more and
[6:22] god you're showing us ourselves in the
[6:24] mirror of your word
[6:25] well we just pray now that the
[6:26] reflection that you get back out of our
[6:28] lives will be a true one lord
[6:30] that you would mold the character lord
[6:32] that you for ordained to be there that
[6:34] you had molded in us lord that you let
[6:36] that life lord and the seed
[6:37] have preeminence over everything else we
[6:40] commit ourselves to you and ask that you
[6:41] would speak through these human lips
[6:43] today and have preeminence in this place
[6:45] anoint us to hear to receive to perceive
[6:48] all that you have for us today
[6:50] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[6:53] you can be seated man i just wanted to
[6:56] thank sister debbie for that special
[6:58] that was
[6:58] very nice i enjoyed that very much very
[7:00] encouraging
[7:02] praise the lord i was looking here
[7:05] at part four
[7:09] just because the the more i meditate on
[7:12] this the more it just becomes real amen
[7:14] the more
[7:15] you just get sucked into it and god
[7:17] keeps opening more and more and more
[7:19] so we're going to stay here and we've
[7:21] been talking about this for a little bit
[7:23] of time now
[7:24] search the scriptures for in them you
[7:27] think you have eternal life but they are
[7:28] they that testify of me
[7:30] and we know that that's words that jesus
[7:32] is speaking
[7:33] and he's speaking to religious people
[7:35] he's speaking to people
[7:36] who knew the old testament had read it
[7:38] and had studied it amen and
[7:40] they were basing their eternal
[7:42] destination on the things that they were
[7:44] reading so they had absolute confidence
[7:46] in this word
[7:47] this is what jesus is pointing out
[7:50] search the scriptures for in them you
[7:52] think you have eternal life
[7:53] so the thing that you're willing amen to
[7:56] base your eternal destination on
[7:58] the thing that you hold in tremendous
[8:00] value amen that you would cherish
[8:02] that you're willing to fight for and
[8:04] that you're willing to
[8:05] to make sacrifices for he said the very
[8:08] thing
[8:09] that makes you think you have eternal
[8:10] life is the very thing that testifies of
[8:13] me
[8:14] and now they were rejecting him amen
[8:18] they were rejecting him and claiming a
[8:20] belief in the scriptures
[8:22] but he's pointing out you can't do that
[8:24] because the scriptures are the ones
[8:26] testifying of me
[8:28] you can't have it where you reject me
[8:31] and you take the scriptures
[8:32] because he is the scriptures made alive
[8:35] he's the manifestation of the scriptures
[8:37] so to reject him is to reject the
[8:39] scriptures by which you think you have
[8:41] eternal life
[8:42] [Applause]
[8:44] and so jesus is really
[8:47] i mean he's really turning the picture
[8:50] back on them
[8:52] and then they're they're rejecting him
[8:53] and they're they're claiming
[8:55] uh they're they're claiming uh um a
[8:58] birthright they're claiming an
[8:59] inheritance they're claiming
[9:01] a religious pedigree amen and jesus is
[9:03] saying
[9:04] everything that you everything that
[9:06] you're basing everything you're
[9:07] rejecting me
[9:08] on is the very thing that testifies of
[9:10] who i am
[9:11] now we've come to the place where the
[9:13] bride now can look through the
[9:14] scriptures and she sees christ
[9:16] all the way through amen but we know now
[9:19] that that
[9:19] by the by the opening of the seals the
[9:21] seventh seal in particular
[9:23] shows that that christ is both male and
[9:26] female
[9:27] that there's a male expression of christ
[9:29] in a female expression of christ
[9:31] and this is the masterpiece family when
[9:34] brother branham is preaching the
[9:35] masterpiece
[9:36] he's not preaching a singular
[9:38] masterpiece if you go back and listen to
[9:40] masterpiece or read it
[9:41] brother branham is talking about a
[9:42] masterpiece family
[9:45] that's why in the garden amen that's why
[9:48] back in the beginning when man was
[9:50] there alone he was looking for him to
[9:51] help me and there was no suitable help
[9:53] me
[9:54] amen because to help me was within him
[9:56] so god took the help meat
[9:57] out of him put in another body and
[9:59] joined the two together
[10:01] amen and then what was not good became
[10:04] very good we got that
[10:08] brother branham said that's the crowning
[10:09] act of creation him and that's the
[10:11] that's the moment that's when
[10:12] he looked at everything and everything
[10:14] was very good
[10:17] so we find out that that that's the
[10:19] mystery man that's the mystery of adam
[10:21] there was a greater mystery to the man
[10:24] than when he was made
[10:25] flesh and began to walk around amen to
[10:28] the creation that was a mystery revealed
[10:31] because he before was hovering over
[10:34] working like the holy spirit
[10:35] the invisible the spirit man who was who
[10:38] had dominion
[10:39] who had rulership as a god over the
[10:41] earth he was ruling in spirit form
[10:43] and the animals and all of creation they
[10:45] couldn't see they could maybe feel his
[10:47] presence maybe see him orchestrating
[10:49] things
[10:50] he brother man said he was like the holy
[10:51] spirit
[10:53] so there was a mystery to creation of
[10:56] who this god was that's having dominion
[10:58] over the earth
[10:59] amen but then god would reveal the
[11:01] mystery by taking the man
[11:03] and forming him into flesh making him in
[11:06] the same
[11:06] fashion as the rest of the creation on
[11:08] earth and now
[11:09] that was a mystery revealed and there
[11:11] was a revelation of the mystery
[11:14] of this man who was running everything
[11:16] amen but then as the man began to walk
[11:18] around
[11:18] amen they began to rejoice because now
[11:20] the lion wouldn't just feel his presence
[11:22] but the lion could actually brush up
[11:24] against him
[11:25] amen and rub against another being like
[11:27] him
[11:28] that he could touch amen but there was
[11:30] another mystery a deep mystery yet
[11:33] and there was another mystery of adam
[11:35] and that was the mystery
[11:36] of the woman that was inside of him
[11:40] and then god's appointed time there
[11:42] would come a time
[11:43] that another great mystery which was
[11:46] wrapped up in this mystery
[11:48] amen would be revealed and now the
[11:51] animals wouldn't see
[11:52] just one form of adam they would see two
[11:55] forms of
[11:56] the same atom they would see male and
[11:58] female
[11:59] and god called their name adam
[12:02] there was only one and that one was adam
[12:06] and adam was male and female
[12:09] and that was a greater mystery amen so
[12:12] when jesus christ was here
[12:14] the word made flesh amen when he was
[12:16] when he was walking the earth amen it
[12:18] was a mystery a great mystery revealed
[12:21] amen
[12:21] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[12:23] us now he could be handled amen now he
[12:26] could be seen
[12:27] they could hear an audible vocal cords
[12:29] coming out
[12:30] amen of this great creation it was a
[12:32] mystery but yet there was a great
[12:34] mystery laying inside of that man
[12:36] because the word was made flash and the
[12:38] brightest part of the word
[12:39] and she was there in that creation when
[12:42] the word was made flesh
[12:43] she was right there with jesus christ
[12:46] walking this earth amen you've already
[12:50] walked by the sea of galilee amen you've
[12:53] already
[12:53] calmed the storm you have already faced
[12:56] the dissenters and the pharisees and
[12:58] you've already done it all amen all
[13:01] you're doing is repeating what's already
[13:03] be done
[13:04] because you did it when you were with
[13:05] him there in that creation
[13:08] you walked on the water you spoke to the
[13:10] storm you spoke to the fig tree
[13:12] amen do you believe that
[13:15] [Applause]
[13:16] amen so now why is it
[13:20] so difficult to think that it can happen
[13:22] again it's already happened amen
[13:24] when we were there there was a great
[13:26] mystery laying there
[13:28] and that mystery that was that in that
[13:30] body of flesh
[13:31] was the ingredients for the bride
[13:35] and at calvary he would separate out the
[13:37] ingredients amen and he would go to
[13:38] start forming the bride amen
[13:40] and he's been forming her through seven
[13:42] church ages
[13:43] and now he gets he gets that he gets
[13:45] reformed and now he speaks life into her
[13:48] and now she's here expressing the very
[13:52] life of jesus christ
[13:56] hallelujah a great mystery
[14:00] that's why that's why brother branham
[14:02] said when you go to say
[14:05] i and my father are one and these other
[14:07] things the shock begins to pull away
[14:09] amen why it's just a realization of the
[14:12] reality
[14:13] of who i am amen when i say who i am i'm
[14:16] not talking about the man in the mirror
[14:18] i realize that this flesh has come
[14:21] through corruption amen
[14:22] that's why there's been a price of
[14:24] redemption paid and that price of
[14:26] redemption would redeem me back
[14:28] then put me back in my ought to have
[14:29] been conditioned amen where this flesh
[14:32] will actually change into a glorified
[14:33] body
[14:34] it's already redeemed it's already
[14:36] working in my body amen
[14:38] the the redemption amen the resurrection
[14:40] the transformation
[14:42] is already taking place because where
[14:44] this body
[14:45] amen used to be addicted to cigarettes
[14:47] this body used to be addicted to
[14:49] all kinds of hideous things amen there's
[14:52] another life
[14:53] inside that has grabbed this body and
[14:56] making the body
[14:57] subject to the life that's on the inside
[15:00] showing that there's a transforming
[15:01] power
[15:02] that's already at work
[15:06] praise be to god and so now
[15:10] it's a reality of what's taking place
[15:13] will allow her to say my father and i
[15:15] are one why
[15:16] jesus could say my father and i are one
[15:19] amen he says
[15:20] before abraham i was and they took up
[15:22] stones to stone him
[15:23] they didn't want to hear that that's
[15:25] impossible amen how could you say such a
[15:28] thing like that
[15:31] because it's true that's how he can say
[15:32] it it's true he doesn't have to explain
[15:35] it
[15:35] he doesn't have to make anybody
[15:36] understand it he doesn't have to qualify
[15:38] his statement
[15:39] it's just the truth before abraham was
[15:42] i am they took up stones to stone him
[15:45] amen he didn't say
[15:46] put down your stone i'll explain it to
[15:48] you i'll draw you a diagram
[15:50] amen if you'll just give me a couple of
[15:52] hours i'll break it down so that you can
[15:54] easily understand it
[15:55] he wasn't here to make unbelievers
[15:58] easily understand the word
[16:00] he was here calling for the genuine
[16:02] believers
[16:03] and he didn't have to qualify his
[16:05] statements he didn't have to explain
[16:07] what he was going to say
[16:08] all he had to do was speak the truth
[16:11] [Applause]
[16:12] and the seed will come to the seed amen
[16:15] the word to the word
[16:17] as long as it's truth amen they'll come
[16:20] together
[16:22] and when you when you go to say brother
[16:24] ben says when you go to say
[16:26] i and my father are one in these other
[16:28] things
[16:31] there's a lot of other things
[16:35] then the shock begins to pull away
[16:38] hallelujah
[16:40] just to believe the message makes you
[16:44] crazy
[16:45] in the eyes of a carnal world
[16:50] say i don't have to go into judgment
[16:54] i've passed from condemnation from
[16:55] judgment
[16:57] when did you pass i was already judged
[17:00] in him on calvary i can't be judged
[17:02] again
[17:05] that's a that's an insane statement to
[17:08] somebody with a carnal mind
[17:10] but yet it's the truth they say i was
[17:14] in the thoughts of god an attribute of
[17:16] god there
[17:18] amen before the foundation of the world
[17:20] waiting for my time to be expressed here
[17:22] on this earth
[17:23] amen that's the truth
[17:26] but it doesn't sound logical it doesn't
[17:29] sound reasonable
[17:30] amen because it defies human logic and
[17:33] human reasoning
[17:34] it's another kind of logic it's another
[17:36] kind of reasoning
[17:38] so so jesus says search the scriptures
[17:41] and now the bride
[17:42] can say search the scriptures search the
[17:45] scriptures they
[17:46] are they that testify of who i am i can
[17:48] point to numerous scriptures that shows
[17:50] the day i'm living in
[17:52] and what's happening right now that
[17:54] there are there is a female expression
[17:55] that there's a bride and there's been a
[17:56] mystery of the bride all the way through
[17:58] the scriptures
[18:00] search the scriptures they are they that
[18:01] testify
[18:03] of us brother branham said in adoption
[18:08] he said what happened i ask you now i'm
[18:10] a typologist
[18:12] and any man that knows the bible is a
[18:14] typologist
[18:17] this is good friends he said i'm a
[18:20] typologist
[18:22] now the very thing that he'll get
[18:24] criticized for and you and i will get
[18:25] criticized for
[18:26] brother brandon makes a statement and
[18:28] any man that knows the bible
[18:31] is a typologist now if you go to
[18:33] seminary they don't want to teach
[18:35] typology because
[18:36] i mean it's it's too uh it's too subject
[18:39] to opinion
[18:40] it's too random and then you could you
[18:42] can mess it up
[18:43] they want to teach terms like exegesis
[18:46] and
[18:46] and and what other hard words uh
[18:49] hermenetics or whatever
[18:51] i don't even know what they mean i'm
[18:52] just saying things that i've heard
[18:54] you go to bible class and they they they
[18:56] say you've got to study the scripture
[18:57] verse by verse by verse you can't take
[18:59] anything out of context
[19:00] you can't just grab one portion of a
[19:02] verse or one verse and pull out of
[19:04] context
[19:05] and and my argument to that is jesus
[19:08] never taught by exegesis jesus never
[19:10] taught verse by verse
[19:11] he would pull a little piece out of
[19:13] something david said here a little piece
[19:15] out of most a little piece out of there
[19:17] and he would bring him together and say
[19:18] it's right here
[19:20] so you go to a seminary and teach
[19:22] somebody how to preach contrary
[19:24] to the way jesus preached contrary to
[19:27] the way the apostle paul preached
[19:31] hallelujah i mean just ideas of man amen
[19:34] and some of those things unfortunately
[19:36] weave their way into the message amen
[19:38] and we
[19:39] want to start taking seminary ideas and
[19:41] and way the word has been broke down and
[19:44] the way the things have been defined
[19:46] through seven church ages
[19:47] and i say forget it amen let the message
[19:50] teach us how
[19:51] to handle the word let the prophet teach
[19:54] us how to handle the word
[19:55] let's look at how jesus handled it how
[19:57] did paul handle it how did peter handle
[19:59] it how did
[20:00] how did john handle it hallelujah
[20:06] he said i'm a typologist and any man
[20:08] that knows the bible
[20:09] is a typologist further he says in
[20:12] abraham and a seed after him from 1961
[20:17] whether i can satisfy you with it or not
[20:19] i do not know but to me it certainly
[20:21] satisfies me
[20:22] in being not efficient in education
[20:24] therefore i approach the scriptures from
[20:26] the
[20:26] standpoint of a type and more like a
[20:29] typologist to type what has been
[20:31] that will be because we know that the
[20:33] scripture each have compound meaning
[20:36] that like in matthew 3 it said out of
[20:38] egypt i've called my son
[20:39] now if you'll run that reference back
[20:41] you'll find out that it meant jacob his
[20:42] son and
[20:43] also jesus his son so in typing we see
[20:47] where the old testament types the new
[20:49] and all these different shadows and
[20:51] types like the moon and the sun and
[20:53] type of christ in the church and as the
[20:55] sun goes down the moon gives light and
[20:57] the absence of the sun
[20:58] just like as the s-o-n left the earth to
[21:01] go into glory to the father then the
[21:03] moon the church gives the light
[21:04] how the moon gets its light is
[21:06] reflecting the sunlight to the earth
[21:08] for a lesser light and all these things
[21:10] it may seem more like a baby form for
[21:12] great theologians
[21:13] but i don't believe i'm talking to many
[21:15] of those and if i am then you excuse me
[21:18] my illiterate way of trying to present
[21:20] it
[21:20] but i would ask you that you search it
[21:22] thoroughly before you rudely disagree
[21:24] with it
[21:26] brother bam showing he's just pulling
[21:29] out types and
[21:30] and this types this and this type stat
[21:32] and this type staff
[21:33] and he begins to explain the revelation
[21:36] of the
[21:37] hour by showing the types the way it's
[21:40] come down through history
[21:42] and i want to take a look we can turn to
[21:44] john chapter 6 together
[21:47] i want to look at this as a as i just
[21:49] lay down a foundation
[21:51] here on on this kind of teaching
[21:55] i'm going to look at jesus and we want
[21:57] to look at the apostle paul and see how
[21:59] they handle the word
[22:03] in john chapter 6 verse 32
[22:11] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[22:13] i say unto you moses gave you not that
[22:15] bread
[22:16] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[22:18] true bread from heaven
[22:20] for the bread of god is he which cometh
[22:22] down from heaven and giveth life into
[22:24] the world
[22:25] now they had just asked him to show a
[22:27] sign
[22:28] he had just fed multitudes he had
[22:30] crossed the leg they come to him and
[22:32] they said will you show us a sign
[22:34] and they said moses gave us bread
[22:37] in the wilderness and so now they're
[22:39] pointing back amen to a literal thing
[22:42] that happened
[22:43] when there was literal bread that would
[22:45] fall like dew upon the ground
[22:46] and they would go out in the morning in
[22:48] the exodus journey and they would gather
[22:50] what they needed for that day
[22:51] and they would actually physically eat
[22:53] of that bread amen and now jesus is
[22:56] going to take
[22:57] that he's going to take that bread
[22:59] falling from heaven that heavenly manna
[23:01] and manna means what is it literal
[23:04] translation is what is it i mean they
[23:06] come out in the morning and they looked
[23:07] at it
[23:08] and they said what is it amen that's the
[23:10] same thing they did to jesus christ when
[23:12] he was the bread of god that came down
[23:13] from heaven
[23:14] he come on earth and all the religious
[23:16] leaders looked at him and said what is
[23:17] it
[23:18] where did you get your authority how do
[23:19] you say these things where was your
[23:21] schooling amen what is it we don't it
[23:23] don't make any sense
[23:24] that's what the manna is like when it
[23:26] comes down from heaven
[23:28] the people are like what is this i don't
[23:30] get it
[23:31] that was the message it come down amen
[23:33] the living bread of life from heaven and
[23:35] everybody's like what is this i mean i
[23:37] don't get it
[23:37] it doesn't make sense it's heavenly
[23:40] manna
[23:42] so here they're they're starting to talk
[23:44] about a literal event that took place in
[23:46] the bible
[23:47] and now jesus is going to take that
[23:49] story and he's going to bring it up a
[23:51] notch into a spiritual level
[23:53] amen and if you have amen if you would
[23:56] have
[23:56] today jesus doing the same thing if we
[23:59] could just
[23:59] transport ourselves back to that day and
[24:02] we could be standing there
[24:04] and all the religious leaders of that
[24:06] day had been through training
[24:07] the the priesthood the levites have been
[24:09] through training amen and they knew the
[24:11] word
[24:12] they knew it exactly they knew it word
[24:14] by word
[24:15] they had it memorized because the word
[24:17] was very valuable to them
[24:19] but all they had was the word amen they
[24:21] were missing the life but they had the
[24:23] word they had the hard
[24:25] fast word and they could not flex
[24:28] on that whatsoever so they didn't
[24:30] understand
[24:31] what that word was actually representing
[24:34] all they knew
[24:35] was literal bread that felt like dew in
[24:37] the morning
[24:38] literally go out and eat it and that's
[24:40] all the farther that example could go
[24:43] it couldn't go anywhere else it couldn't
[24:46] be taught any other way
[24:48] except god's provision in the wilderness
[24:50] and a heavenly bread
[24:51] you physically ate it sustained us in a
[24:54] journey it was a miracle
[24:55] and that's it period done we can't do
[24:57] anything else with that
[25:00] and here comes jesus and he's going to
[25:02] take the same thing
[25:03] if you could just put yourself in the
[25:05] same spot jesus starts to do things with
[25:07] the word
[25:08] that they're not allowed to do
[25:12] he starts taking that and saying that
[25:14] was only a type
[25:15] that wasn't the real bread from heaven
[25:17] but the real bread from heaven is he
[25:18] that's come down from heaven
[25:20] and all of a sudden they're like how can
[25:22] you say that by what authority to you
[25:23] say
[25:24] what school have you been to amen nobody
[25:27] can do that
[25:28] with the scriptures
[25:31] jesus can
[25:32] [Applause]
[25:34] hallelujah man and that's why brother
[25:37] brennan can be a typologist say any man
[25:39] that knows the bible is a typologist
[25:40] because that's what jesus
[25:42] was jesus was a typologist
[25:45] [Applause]
[25:47] verily verily i say unto you moses gave
[25:49] you that not the bread from heaven
[25:51] but my father give you through the true
[25:53] bread from heaven for the bread of god
[25:55] is he which
[25:56] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[25:58] unto the world
[26:00] then said they unto him lord evermore
[26:02] give us this bread
[26:04] it's amazing that god will do something
[26:07] to lay a shadow down
[26:10] so the bread falling from heaven the
[26:12] exodus journey all it was was laying a
[26:14] shadow down
[26:16] it even wasn't it wasn't even the thing
[26:19] that god had in his mind he wanted to
[26:21] accomplish
[26:22] it was laying a shadow down to point to
[26:25] the thing he had in his mind he wanted
[26:26] to accomplish
[26:28] if we could just understand this in the
[26:30] bible that god is working his great love
[26:33] story brother ben said the bible is a
[26:34] love story
[26:36] it's not individual verses in individual
[26:38] chapters and individual books
[26:39] no sir it's one book one story one great
[26:43] love story one big love letter that's
[26:46] meant to be read between the lines
[26:48] [Applause]
[26:51] amen so now he comes down and
[26:54] and now we realize that what was
[26:56] happening with moses and
[26:58] and the fire on mount sinai and the
[27:00] mountain
[27:01] shaking and the man of falling and red
[27:03] sea parting
[27:04] and you just go down through the bible
[27:06] and all these things that wasn't
[27:08] even the thing that god had in his mind
[27:10] to do
[27:12] it was just laying a shadow
[27:15] to the thing that he had in his mind
[27:17] that he wanted to do
[27:18] so that when he came and did it he could
[27:20] point back to the shadow
[27:22] and see this is that and this is that
[27:25] we're living in the day when everything
[27:28] he wanted to do
[27:29] is coming to fruition amen all the
[27:31] shadows are coming to today
[27:33] every shadow every type everything
[27:36] that's laid down in the bible is
[27:37] coming to life today amen and we can
[27:40] look back and say
[27:41] that's this that's this that's this
[27:44] that's this
[27:44] because that wasn't even what he wanted
[27:46] to do this is
[27:48] what he's always wanted to do and he had
[27:50] to lay a shadow so that when we get here
[27:53] we have some authority to preach by
[27:55] [Applause]
[27:58] so the prophet of god could pick it up
[28:00] amen and he began to explain
[28:03] by what by the shadow
[28:06] explaining the reality
[28:10] oh praise be to god we can't be children
[28:14] anymore amen tossed about
[28:16] using our carnal mind we've got to come
[28:18] to the real revelation of the word
[28:20] let it be revealed to us amen
[28:26] so jesus is here
[28:29] telling them trying to tell them
[28:33] the reality of what they've always
[28:34] believed
[28:36] they always believed they were in an
[28:39] exodus and
[28:40] god brought them out and moses fed them
[28:42] bread and they always
[28:44] believed that but jesus is trying to
[28:47] tell him
[28:47] why they've always believed that
[28:51] and they didn't want to believe what god
[28:53] was doing today
[28:55] they only wanted to believe what he had
[28:57] done
[29:00] it's easy to believe what he has done
[29:03] the hard part is to believe what he's
[29:05] doing
[29:05] today right this moment
[29:09] i'm not even talking 50 years ago i'm
[29:11] talking right this
[29:12] moment if you want to talk where the
[29:14] challenge is the challenge is to find
[29:16] out
[29:16] and believe and accept what he's doing
[29:18] at this moment in time
[29:21] there's a whole slew of people that can
[29:22] accept what god did 50 some years ago
[29:25] but you have to accept what god is doing
[29:28] today
[29:30] and so all those were shadows all of
[29:32] those foreshadowed what was happening
[29:34] and now jesus comes and he begins to
[29:36] tell them amen that wasn't the real
[29:38] bread
[29:38] amen but my father gave the real bread
[29:41] and the bread is he that come down from
[29:42] heaven
[29:43] and now they're so carnally stuck in a
[29:46] carnal mind
[29:47] i say god fix this carnal mind of mine
[29:50] because my biggest problem is this old
[29:52] carnal mind this old carnal nature
[29:55] that wants to see amen that always
[29:57] thinks one and one plus one equals two
[29:59] amen that's just earthly things that's
[30:01] just natural things amen but with god
[30:04] one plus one can equal whoever knows
[30:06] what number
[30:08] stop thinking with an education stop
[30:11] thinking with a carnal mind
[30:13] we've got to stop thinking with natural
[30:15] things
[30:18] we will never understand the bible with
[30:20] a carnal mind and an intellectual
[30:22] understanding
[30:23] neither will we understand the message
[30:27] he's telling them amen about the real
[30:29] bread he that come down from heaven
[30:31] and they said oh give us this bread
[30:34] and they're still looking for something
[30:36] that they can put in their mouth into
[30:38] and swallow and digest and they're
[30:40] missing the entire thing
[30:42] because he's speaking spiritual and
[30:44] they're looking
[30:45] natural we're in the same
[30:48] day friends because when it came time to
[30:51] move from the
[30:52] jews to the gentiles the transition was
[30:54] from natural
[30:56] to spiritual brother man said everything
[30:58] that happened naturally to the jews
[31:00] happened spiritually to the bride
[31:02] these are spiritual happenings these are
[31:04] spiritual things
[31:06] this is a spiritual bread this is
[31:08] spiritual water
[31:09] amen this is spiritual everything is
[31:12] spiritual
[31:13] [Applause]
[31:15] sometimes we still want to say oh
[31:17] where's the bread at
[31:20] hold your hand out i'll take some bread
[31:24] it doesn't come like that it's not the
[31:27] kind of eating you do with your teeth
[31:30] it's not the kind of drinking that you
[31:31] do from a jug or a glass
[31:33] it's not that kind of food and drink
[31:38] so when they said they to the lord
[31:40] evermore give us this bread in verse 35
[31:43] and jesus said unto them i am
[31:46] the bread of life he cometh to me shall
[31:50] never hunger
[31:51] and he that believeth on me shall never
[31:53] thirst
[31:55] oh praise god
[31:59] let's read that again 35 jesus said unto
[32:01] them i am the bread of life he that
[32:02] cometh to me shall never
[32:04] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[32:07] never thirst but i said unto you
[32:09] that you also have seen me and believe
[32:11] not all that the father giveth me shall
[32:13] come to me
[32:14] and him that cometh to me i will in no
[32:15] wise cast out
[32:17] so he gives him the secret ingredient
[32:19] you can't see it unless the father calls
[32:21] you
[32:22] i mean i'm telling you plainly but you
[32:24] can't see it and i
[32:26] am that bread and if you eated this
[32:28] bread you'll neither hunger
[32:29] any more neither shall you thirst
[32:32] so now it's just like when he's talking
[32:35] to the samaritan woman by the
[32:36] by the well amen in samaria he comes to
[32:40] her
[32:40] and he asks her to give a drink and she
[32:42] says you know i'm a samaritan you're a
[32:43] jew he said if you knew who you were
[32:44] talking to you would ask me of drinking
[32:46] i would give you drink of living waters
[32:48] that you never thirst no more neither
[32:49] come here to draw and she says
[32:51] sir give me of those no first she says
[32:54] but the well is deep and you have
[32:55] nothing to draw with
[32:58] so the waters i give are waters of
[33:00] everlasting life
[33:02] she says sir give me this water
[33:05] he's not talking about the water in the
[33:08] well he's not talking about the h2o
[33:10] liquid
[33:11] he is he is preaching typology
[33:18] amen because brother jesus sits here and
[33:20] tells him
[33:21] if you come to me you'll never hunger
[33:23] nor thirst no more
[33:24] amen but it doesn't make any sense
[33:27] because the disciples come to him
[33:29] amen after after pentecost amen when he
[33:32] breaks himself up on the feast of
[33:33] pentecost and he
[33:35] comes into them and shows it as licks of
[33:37] fire amen and now they have god living
[33:39] inside
[33:40] they're eating and they're drinking but
[33:42] yet in their natural body they become
[33:44] hungry again
[33:46] and have to eat food and in their
[33:48] natural body they have to become thirsty
[33:50] again
[33:51] and they have to drink amen because he's
[33:53] not talking about
[33:55] natural when he says you'll neither
[33:56] hunger no more or thirst
[33:58] it had nothing to do with their flesh
[34:00] body
[34:02] it had nothing to do with natural
[34:04] anything he's speaking purely
[34:07] spiritual and all their hearing is
[34:09] natural
[34:13] jesus was a typologist
[34:16] this woman thought she wanted some
[34:19] natural water
[34:21] that would never make her come to the
[34:23] well again
[34:25] for natural water that sounded pretty
[34:27] good
[34:28] i mean back then it wasn't like going
[34:30] over to the tap and you're flipping it
[34:32] open it comes down
[34:33] this woman had to haul water every day
[34:35] back and forth to the well
[34:36] who knows how long of a walk it was if
[34:38] it was cold if it was hot if it was
[34:39] raining
[34:40] you still go haul water so now she's
[34:42] heard about water
[34:43] that you'll never thirst and either come
[34:44] here to draw and she says
[34:46] i'll take it give it to me
[34:50] he says go get your husband
[34:56] go get your husband what's he gonna do
[34:59] he's going to give her the water
[35:04] go get your husband i don't have a
[35:07] husband
[35:08] he said what you said is true because
[35:09] you've had five and the one you're
[35:10] living with is not yours
[35:12] she says sir i perceive you're a prophet
[35:17] what's he doing he's giving her the
[35:18] water
[35:21] not natural water or spiritual order sir
[35:24] i perceive you're a prophet she said
[35:25] give me the water he says go get your
[35:27] husband.
[35:28] so the first thing he's going to do is
[35:29] give the sign of the messiah through a
[35:31] prophet
[35:34] discerning her situation and she says
[35:37] i perceive you're a prophet
[35:40] and then her next question
[35:44] our fathers say in this mountain we
[35:45] should worship
[35:48] but you say in jerusalem is the place of
[35:50] worship
[35:53] see jesus realized she was thirsty
[35:59] she didn't even realize how thirsty she
[36:01] was
[36:03] she was coming to get natural water
[36:06] and she didn't know that she was going
[36:08] to get the living water that day
[36:11] that she would never thirst again
[36:16] see jesus is a typologist
[36:21] he says where's worship and he says we
[36:24] know what you worship you don't know
[36:25] where you worship
[36:26] but i tell you the time has come and is
[36:28] now
[36:29] when they that worship him shall worship
[36:31] in spirit and
[36:32] in truth for the father seek as such to
[36:35] worship him
[36:39] you know what she says next
[36:42] i know that when messiah comes
[36:48] that woman was desperately thirsty
[36:51] she was thirsty all along because when
[36:54] she meets a prophet
[36:55] looking for natural water where's your
[36:57] husband tells her her condition
[36:59] she says you're a prophet when she says
[37:02] you're a prophet she says
[37:03] where are we supposed to worship god she
[37:06] is
[37:06] thirsty she is hungry she wants to know
[37:10] god
[37:10] she wants to worship god she wants to be
[37:12] right with god
[37:13] she's hungry and she's thirsty not for
[37:16] what she can get out of the well
[37:17] and not what she can bake with cornmeal
[37:19] she's thirsty and hungry for something
[37:21] else
[37:22] her spirit the life inside of her is
[37:24] hungering
[37:25] and thirsting for something else
[37:28] and here he is the manna amen the
[37:31] fountain of living water he's standing
[37:33] there right with her and he's going to
[37:35] give her this drink he's going to give
[37:36] her this meat
[37:40] she said when messiah comes
[37:44] he'll do these things he said
[37:48] i am he i speak it to thee
[37:52] what did she get a personal
[37:55] revelation of jesus christ
[37:58] what did brother branham said the new
[37:59] birth was a personal revelation
[38:02] of jesus christ that woman just got the
[38:05] new birth she just got the personal
[38:07] revelation of jesus christ she just
[38:09] found the well
[38:10] she found the manna amen she sits there
[38:12] the disciples come that time
[38:14] they're wondering about why she's there
[38:15] she sits there and then she drops her
[38:17] pot
[38:20] and she runs into the city because now
[38:23] she's got water and she's got food amen
[38:26] and she's willing
[38:26] she says come and see a man that's told
[38:28] me everything i've
[38:30] ever done it's not just the messiah
[38:35] you see jesus was not talking about
[38:38] water and meat but he was talking about
[38:41] water and meat
[38:44] you just have to have eyes to see and
[38:46] ears to hear only those who the father
[38:49] draws can see
[38:50] only who the father brings can
[38:51] understand everybody else looks at it
[38:53] and it's crazy
[38:54] it doesn't make sense it doesn't always
[38:56] add up amen i see this and this and this
[38:58] and the message but i see this and this
[39:00] and i can't get them to correlate
[39:01] because it's not for
[39:03] the unbelievers amen it's only for
[39:06] the bride the message is for the bride
[39:10] it's not to be intellectually understood
[39:12] it's not to be pieced together it's not
[39:14] to be categorized it's not to be
[39:15] diagrammed it's not to be explained
[39:18] it's to be received and believed
[39:23] doesn't have to be explained there's
[39:25] some unexplainable parts to the message
[39:29] praise god i believe anyways
[39:33] the hard parts i believe the
[39:34] unexplainable parts i believe
[39:36] which part do you believe i don't know i
[39:38] just believe
[39:41] what about this statement this statement
[39:42] i believe them
[39:44] which one both of them
[39:47] [Applause]
[39:48] how do they fit brother ted i don't know
[39:50] how they fit
[39:51] but they're true
[39:56] don't have to explain it just believe it
[40:00] we come back to john chapter six
[40:03] let's skip down to verse 48.
[40:06] jesus says i am that bread of life
[40:11] your fathers that eat man in the
[40:12] wilderness and are dead
[40:14] this is the bread which cometh down from
[40:16] heaven that a man may eat thereof
[40:19] and not die he says i am the living
[40:22] bread which come down from heaven if any
[40:24] man eat of this bread he shall live
[40:26] forever
[40:27] and the bread that i will give is my
[40:28] flesh which i will give for the life
[40:31] of the world amen that's when the
[40:33] dialogue just goes
[40:35] even more nutty
[40:39] i mean it goes from odd to totally
[40:42] insane because he says i'm the bread
[40:45] and then they said well let me have that
[40:47] bread he says no i'm the bread
[40:49] and he says now the bread that i give
[40:51] for the world
[40:52] is my flesh that i shall give
[40:56] for the for the world
[40:59] so i shall live forever more in the
[41:00] bread that i will give as my flesh
[41:02] which i will give for the life of the
[41:04] world
[41:05] then he goes in to eat my flesh and
[41:06] drink my blood and now they go right
[41:09] back right back right back to literal
[41:12] eating and literal drinking
[41:15] he just tried to break him from that
[41:17] amen and say
[41:18] no i'm the bread of life that came down
[41:22] amen and then he says now the bread that
[41:25] i'm going to give is my flesh which is
[41:27] the word made flesh
[41:28] it's the word made flesh what is the
[41:30] bread the living word
[41:34] is there bread available today
[41:36] absolutely there's living word available
[41:38] today
[41:39] there's still bread to be feasting on if
[41:41] you're hungry
[41:42] spiritually there's a meat here that you
[41:45] can eat
[41:45] and it is the living word that has come
[41:48] down from god out of heaven
[41:49] it is the flesh amen it is the body
[41:52] it is the word of jesus christ on
[41:55] display
[41:56] it's the word of god on display
[42:01] hallelujah amen
[42:05] now they're still literally looking to
[42:08] eat something and to drink something
[42:11] and when he says my flesh and my blood
[42:13] the only thing they can get in their
[42:15] brains
[42:16] is actually cutting the man up into
[42:18] little pieces
[42:19] and eating his flesh and chewing on it
[42:21] and blood squirting out the corner of
[42:22] their mouth
[42:25] cannibalism is the only thing they can
[42:27] see vampirism drinking blood is the only
[42:30] thing they can see
[42:31] amen because they don't have eyes to see
[42:34] and they don't have
[42:34] ears to see and that's why he said it
[42:37] that way
[42:44] good thing he looked at peter and said
[42:46] you're going to go too
[42:48] everybody's like this is hard i can't
[42:49] deal with this
[42:51] will you go too peter said
[42:54] where will you where will we go peter
[42:57] could even be thinking
[42:59] i don't want to eat his flesh
[43:03] brother man said they didn't understand
[43:04] what he was saying
[43:07] peter himself can be struggling within
[43:10] himself thinking
[43:11] i don't really want to drink human blood
[43:13] i i don't understand what he's saying
[43:15] and he's struggling within himself and
[43:17] he turns and said well you guys go also
[43:19] and he says where will i go
[43:21] thou alone have the words of eternal
[43:23] life i don't know what you're talking
[43:25] about
[43:25] i'm not necessarily liking what i'm
[43:27] hearing
[43:30] but i know you alone have the words of
[43:32] eternal life
[43:33] and this message is christ amen it
[43:36] is the living bread of life that's come
[43:39] down out of heaven
[43:40] amen and it's the truth
[43:44] hallelujah and
[43:47] it is the rising of the sun 1965 brother
[43:50] brennan said
[43:52] blessed art thou see son of jonas bless
[43:54] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[43:56] you
[43:57] my father which is in heaven has
[43:58] revealed it upon this rock
[44:00] i'll build my church the gates of hell
[44:02] can't prevail against it
[44:03] and i give unto thee the keys whatever
[44:05] you bind on earth i'll bind it in heaven
[44:08] what you loose on earth that's the
[44:10] divine
[44:11] revelation of the word made flesh
[44:15] so what did what did uh
[44:18] peter catch from god it was the divine
[44:21] revelation of the word made flesh you
[44:24] can say he caught that jesus christ was
[44:26] the son of god
[44:26] but what he really caught was the divine
[44:29] revelation of the word made flesh
[44:33] because this is what brother ben says
[44:34] next that's the divine revelation of the
[44:37] word made flesh
[44:38] if it was flesh and that day by the sun
[44:40] the groom it's fleshed today
[44:43] by the bride so what is the revelation
[44:47] that we need from the father today
[44:49] we need to know where amen where the
[44:52] divine
[44:53] word is being made flesh
[44:59] hallelujah and that's where the rub
[45:00] comes
[45:03] that's where the problem comes because
[45:05] it's fine to say
[45:07] he was right there walking on earth amen
[45:09] peter got it amen what peter
[45:11] got was the divine revelation of the
[45:14] word made flesh
[45:15] and only the father could give that to
[45:16] him amen and when he got that he was
[45:18] given the keys amen
[45:20] he was recognized as guarding the right
[45:21] revelation remember we need the same
[45:24] thing today
[45:25] not the divine revelation of the word
[45:27] that was made flesh
[45:28] but the divine revelation of the word
[45:31] made
[45:32] flesh today and if it was flesh in that
[45:36] day by the groom
[45:37] then it's fleshed today by the bride
[45:40] and it is going to take a divine
[45:43] revelation
[45:44] from the father to recognize that
[45:48] amen because what are you looking at
[45:50] when you look at the bride what are you
[45:51] looking around and see you're seeing
[45:53] people with
[45:53] problems amen you're seeing faults amen
[45:56] you're seeing different things
[45:57] you're like how can that be amen it's
[46:00] not me
[46:00] amen it's not this amen don't look
[46:02] around and get too tied up with what you
[46:04] see on the outside amen
[46:06] what is the life that's coming through
[46:08] amen what is the life that's taking over
[46:10] what's happening in the lives of the
[46:12] people as they change from glory
[46:14] unto glory unto glory
[46:18] what is it the divine revelation of the
[46:20] words being made flesh again
[46:22] in my flesh in your flesh hallelujah
[46:28] brother said the word is becoming flesh
[46:31] and the flesh is becoming the word
[46:34] that's a monumental task to do all by
[46:37] yourself
[46:39] that's why you don't do it by yourself
[46:41] it's not a life that we live with the
[46:42] life he
[46:43] lives through us it's a yielding it's
[46:46] not a working it's not a laboring it's
[46:48] not a running it's a resting
[46:49] it's something that he must do himself
[46:54] that's why the second photo of his
[46:56] threefold plan that's tied to the
[46:57] seventh seal
[46:58] amen that's been in the back part of
[47:00] god's mind all of this time his whole
[47:01] plan
[47:02] his whole desire was a three-fold
[47:04] purpose
[47:06] so his whole desire wasn't an exodus out
[47:09] of egypt
[47:13] his whole plan amen his whole plan
[47:16] wasn't isaiah the prophet his whole plan
[47:19] amen was not deliverance from jezebel
[47:21] through elijah that wasn't his whole
[47:22] plan
[47:23] his whole plan wasn't elisha with a
[47:25] double portion
[47:26] they were shadowing pointing to what his
[47:29] plan was
[47:30] they were laying down a shadow laying
[47:32] down a type so we can see the plan
[47:34] all the way through but there's only
[47:36] been one plan there's only been one goal
[47:38] there's only been one thought in god's
[47:40] mind and everything has been working
[47:42] and pointing towards this one thought
[47:43] they get preeminence under man he did
[47:45] that in christ jesus
[47:46] they get preeminence in the people he's
[47:48] doing that now in the bride
[47:49] to restore them back to an eden-like
[47:52] condition
[47:53] that's the whole plan of the bible
[47:56] that's the whole theme of the scriptures
[47:57] and we're standing here
[47:59] in the second fold of a threefold plan
[48:02] about ready to step into the third fold
[48:05] of this threefold plan amen and
[48:07] everything that's been in the bible
[48:09] everything that's been written and
[48:10] everything that's happened is trying to
[48:12] show us where we are today
[48:16] hallelujah they're not flannel graph
[48:19] bible stories
[48:22] i like flannel graphs so i'm not
[48:24] knocking flannel graph
[48:27] they're not bible stories they're not
[48:29] things that happened to people a long
[48:31] time ago
[48:32] they're things that are happening to us
[48:33] today
[48:35] and it was late there was a shadow so we
[48:37] could see it today
[48:40] but only if you have eyes to see and
[48:42] ears to hear
[48:44] let's turn back to john chapter 3.
[48:49] john chapter 3 verse 12.
[49:03] if i have told you earthly things and
[49:05] you believe not how shall you believe if
[49:07] i tell you heavenly things
[49:10] and no man hath ascended to heaven but
[49:12] he that come down from heaven even the
[49:14] son of man which is in heaven
[49:16] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[49:18] the wilderness even so must the son of
[49:20] man be lifted up
[49:22] that whosoever believeth in him should
[49:23] not perish but have eternal life
[49:26] so what was god's great goal in the
[49:28] wilderness was it to lift up the brazen
[49:30] serpent
[49:32] no it was to lift up christ
[49:35] to take away the sins of the world so
[49:37] what did he do
[49:38] in the exodus journey when the people
[49:40] were being bitten by fiery serpents
[49:43] what was the problem in the beginning
[49:44] amen eve was bitten by a fiery serpent
[49:48] there was a poison life hybrid life
[49:51] injected
[49:52] into the into the life of god's children
[49:55] and there was a hybridization taking
[49:57] place so there was a there was a biting
[49:58] of the serpent
[49:59] amen the the deception of his mouth laid
[50:02] a poison trap
[50:04] and now they were dying by this poison
[50:07] of these fiery serpents
[50:08] but if they would look amen to the
[50:10] serpent wrapped around the pole
[50:12] if they would look to that amen they
[50:13] would look and they would live amen
[50:16] so what was the point of coming to this
[50:18] place in the exodus journey
[50:19] what was the point of the murmuring of
[50:21] the people what was the point of the
[50:23] fiery
[50:23] serpent the whole point was so that when
[50:26] christ was lifted up
[50:27] he could point back and say see like he
[50:30] did there
[50:30] that's what's got to happen again it
[50:33] wasn't for them
[50:34] amen it was for those that would see
[50:36] christ lifted up
[50:37] that they could live amen from the
[50:39] effect of the poison from the serpents
[50:44] hallelujah now we just took a big word
[50:47] like exegesis and just crumpled it up
[50:49] and threw it in the waste past
[50:53] and i don't even really know what it
[50:54] means for sure i might be using it wrong
[50:57] but i don't think you care and i
[50:58] certainly don't care
[51:01] as long as we use the scriptures right
[51:04] that's what matters
[51:05] so jesus now takes a physical thing that
[51:07] happened and said that's only a type
[51:10] you think that was important but the son
[51:13] of man must be lifted up
[51:14] and whoever looks on him will live
[51:18] let's go to hebrews chapter 12.
[51:24] i just really wanted to slow down we've
[51:26] been talking about this for some time
[51:27] but i want to slow down and actually
[51:29] look at this
[51:30] so that we're all equipped immensely we
[51:32] all know where we stand in the
[51:34] scriptures
[51:37] hebrews chapter 12 we're going to look
[51:41] at the writings of the apostle paul
[51:44] as he's preaching here to the hebrews
[51:46] now the hebrews knew the scriptures
[51:48] right these were the jews they knew the
[51:51] scriptures they knew the old testament
[51:53] and here here comes the apostle paul in
[51:55] chapter 12
[51:56] we'll begin at verse 18 for you are not
[51:59] coming to the mount that might be
[52:01] touched it burn with fire
[52:03] nor into blackness and darkness and
[52:04] tempest and unto the sound of the
[52:06] trumpet and the voice of words which
[52:07] voice
[52:08] that they that heard and treated that
[52:10] the word should not be spoken to them
[52:11] anymore
[52:12] for they should not endure that which
[52:14] was commanded and if so much as
[52:16] a beast touched the mountain it should
[52:18] be stoned or thrust through with a dart
[52:20] and so terrible was the sight moses said
[52:23] i exceedingly fear and quake
[52:25] so now he's going back into the old
[52:28] testament
[52:29] and he's pointing to a time when they
[52:30] were all gathered around mount sinai
[52:32] and there was instructions given to
[52:34] moses and a fire that fell and an
[52:36] earthquake that come
[52:37] and nothing was supposed to come up to
[52:38] the mountain he's pointing back to there
[52:40] and he's going to use it as a type
[52:44] and he comes here verse 22 he says but
[52:46] you you're not come to that mountain
[52:49] but ye are come unto mount zion
[52:54] visible or invisible
[52:57] invisible spiritual
[53:00] he pointed that everything was natural a
[53:03] mountain
[53:04] buried around the mountain thrust
[53:06] through with the dark earthquake
[53:08] fire voice natural natural natural
[53:11] natural
[53:11] and he's turning on them and say you
[53:14] haven't come to one thing natural
[53:17] but what you've come to is all spiritual
[53:20] you're coming to mount zion unto the
[53:22] city of the living god
[53:24] now he's not saying you're coming to it
[53:26] you have come to it
[53:30] you're not at the mountain you're at
[53:32] mount zion
[53:35] where is it paul i think i missed it
[53:38] where is it i don't see it i can't touch
[53:39] it he says you've not come to the
[53:41] mountain that can be touched
[53:44] this mountain can't be touched with
[53:46] these hands
[53:47] but yet you've already come to it
[53:53] you've come to mount zion to the city of
[53:55] the living god the heavenly jerusalem
[53:57] to an innumerable company of angels
[54:00] to the general assembly in the church of
[54:02] the firstborn which are written
[54:04] in heaven and to god the judge of all
[54:06] and to the spirits of just men made
[54:08] perfect
[54:09] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[54:11] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[54:12] that speaketh better things than able
[54:15] amen see that you refuse not him that
[54:18] speaketh
[54:19] for if they escaped not who refused him
[54:21] that spake on earth
[54:23] what's he saying now refuse not him that
[54:25] speaketh
[54:26] i don't hear him speaking he's pointing
[54:29] back
[54:30] and say they refused him that spoke
[54:31] before on earth amen what was it
[54:34] it was a voice a thundering loud
[54:36] trumpeting voice
[54:37] and they all heard it but now he's
[54:39] saying don't refuse him that's speaking
[54:40] now
[54:42] i don't hear thunder i don't hear a
[54:44] trumpet i don't hear a loud voice
[54:46] no he was speaking through paul he was
[54:48] speaking through
[54:49] john he was speaking through james he
[54:51] was speaking through timothy but he was
[54:53] speaking
[54:54] right then right there and you can't
[54:57] refuse
[54:57] him that speaketh now
[55:02] because his voice is in the bride
[55:09] see that you refuse not him that
[55:10] speaketh speaketh
[55:12] speaketh present tense speaking
[55:17] not had spoke will speak him that
[55:19] speaketh
[55:21] this is all spiritual friends the the
[55:25] gentiles come to everything
[55:26] spiritually that's why the gentiles have
[55:30] a greater faith amen
[55:32] because when he comes to the when he
[55:34] comes to the the soldier the soldier
[55:36] comes to him and says i've got one of my
[55:37] servants is sick
[55:38] and and and jesus comes or he sits
[55:41] fetches somebody to go get jesus
[55:43] jesus says i'll come he says no don't
[55:44] even come just speak
[55:46] the word because he didn't need jesus to
[55:50] come
[55:50] physically lay hands on him brother said
[55:52] that was a jewish tradition
[55:57] here's a gentile and jesus says i've not
[55:59] seen faith like this no not in all of
[56:01] israel
[56:02] because you won't find that faith in
[56:03] israel until we get to the 144
[56:06] 000 this is the kind of faith the
[56:07] gentiles have that they don't have to
[56:10] see
[56:10] to believe
[56:15] amen praise god
[56:18] that's the gentile faith
[56:24] see that you refuse not him that
[56:25] speaketh for if they escape not who
[56:27] refused him that spake on earth
[56:29] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[56:31] away from him that speaketh from
[56:34] heaven
[56:38] he's talking about christ who is
[56:41] currently
[56:42] speaking not from
[56:45] earth but he's speaking from heaven
[56:49] and how is he speaking through little
[56:52] human beings standing on the earth
[56:55] and when they preach the gospel he's
[56:57] speaking from heaven
[57:01] and when god spoke before on the
[57:03] mountain
[57:04] it trumpeted a blast so fearful that the
[57:08] mountain quake
[57:09] and and moses said i quaked and feared
[57:12] exceedingly it was a voice that actually
[57:15] moved the mountain it was a voice that
[57:17] they all could hear
[57:18] it was a voice that they all ran away
[57:20] from there was no mistaking they could
[57:22] heard it
[57:22] amen and he calls that speaking from
[57:25] earth
[57:28] a lower level of revelation but
[57:31] this speaking that doesn't shake a rock
[57:34] that you cannot feel
[57:35] that you cannot hear this speaking is
[57:37] speaking from heaven
[57:39] and this speaking from heaven is going
[57:41] to shake
[57:42] everything and you'll never see a rock
[57:45] move or a piece of dust fall off
[57:47] it's all spiritual that's being shaken
[57:56] he says for if they escaped who not who
[57:58] refused him that spake on earth
[58:00] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[58:02] away from him that speaketh from heaven
[58:04] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[58:06] he has promised saying yet once more i
[58:08] shake not the earth today
[58:09] not earth only but also heaven
[58:13] hallelujah that's going on right now
[58:18] but you can't see the chair shake and
[58:19] you can't see any insulation fall from
[58:22] the roof
[58:22] but but the speaking from heaven is
[58:25] shaking all things
[58:30] you can't see it with these eyes you
[58:31] can't feel it with these hands you can't
[58:33] perceive it with a carnal mind
[58:36] this is for the elect only
[58:41] and that's not anything that's mean
[58:43] that's the nicest thing that we can say
[58:45] because if he didn't save son all would
[58:47] be lost the only hope that the foolish
[58:49] virgin have
[58:50] the only hope amen that those who are
[58:51] kind to the bride the only hope they
[58:53] have is that god would choose some
[58:55] so that he could redeem so that he could
[58:57] save so that he doesn't annihilate the
[58:59] earth it's the nicest thing we could
[59:01] ever say
[59:01] is this is only for the elect amen
[59:04] because it's for the elect that
[59:05] redemption came
[59:06] it's for the elect that the earth was
[59:08] redeemed it's for the elect amen that
[59:10] will be a new heavens and a new earth
[59:11] for those that are granted entrance at
[59:13] the white throne judgment to come into
[59:15] if he didn't save some if he didn't
[59:17] choose some none would be safe
[59:19] all would be lost
[59:27] praise god hebrews chapter 10
[59:31] verse 1 still laying a foundation
[59:36] a deep foundation might be a big
[59:38] building
[59:41] we've got to dig deep to lay the
[59:42] foundation
[59:44] hebrews 10 1 for the law
[59:48] having a shadow of good things to come
[59:51] and not the very things
[59:53] not the very image of the things can
[59:55] never with those sacrifices which they
[59:57] offered year by year continually make
[59:59] the comers there and too perfect
[1:00:01] so he's saying the law has a shadow of
[1:00:03] good things to come
[1:00:04] and not the very image of the things
[1:00:08] so the whole law and all the sacrifices
[1:00:10] and all the feasts
[1:00:11] amen they were only showing an image of
[1:00:15] what was to come
[1:00:17] so did god want a levitical priesthood
[1:00:19] did he want an aaronic priesthood
[1:00:21] amen did he want animal sacrifices did
[1:00:23] he want a tabernacle did he want a
[1:00:26] temple
[1:00:26] amen did no he didn't want all of that
[1:00:29] what he wanted was his threefold purpose
[1:00:31] what he wanted was preeminence and a man
[1:00:33] preeminence and restoration back to the
[1:00:35] even condition
[1:00:36] and everything is pointing to that
[1:00:40] everything is pointing every sacrifice
[1:00:42] is pointing to christ
[1:00:44] all the feast is pointing to the plan of
[1:00:46] redemption amen what's he doing
[1:00:48] he is shadowing foreshadowing what's in
[1:00:51] his heart to do
[1:00:54] now you can see why the pharisees and
[1:00:56] the sadducees and the herodians and the
[1:00:58] scribes
[1:00:58] they totally missed it when jesus came
[1:01:01] because everything in the old testament
[1:01:02] was laying as a shadow
[1:01:04] pointing to his coming amen pointing to
[1:01:07] the time that when he would be here
[1:01:09] fulfilling the purpose that all those
[1:01:10] shadows pointed down and when he come
[1:01:12] they rejected him and wanted to hold the
[1:01:14] shadow
[1:01:16] he said i believe this but i don't
[1:01:17] believe you you can't have it that way
[1:01:20] you can't say i believe this but i don't
[1:01:22] believe you he is that
[1:01:24] that is pointing to him he's the greater
[1:01:26] revelation of the thing you're digging
[1:01:28] your nails into
[1:01:29] and holding on to the he's the greater
[1:01:32] revelation of that
[1:01:33] amen you can't hold this and refuse this
[1:01:38] the same thing's true true with the
[1:01:39] bright coming of christ amen the new
[1:01:41] testament is pointing out
[1:01:43] christ and the bride christ and his
[1:01:44] bride amen i'm speaking about a husband
[1:01:46] and wife
[1:01:47] but really this is a great mystery i'm
[1:01:49] talking to you christ in the church
[1:01:50] and then it's laid down and you say i
[1:01:52] want to hold on to paul amen that thing
[1:01:54] that you've got your nails dug into
[1:01:56] is trying to show us a bride coming of
[1:01:58] christ
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:01] say i refuse that i refuse what that
[1:02:03] prophet taught i refuse what those
[1:02:04] people are preaching about amen
[1:02:06] that's what paul is trying to tell us
[1:02:09] amen that's what john is trying to show
[1:02:11] us
[1:02:12] and then the thing you're holding on to
[1:02:13] the thing that you think you have
[1:02:15] eternal life with
[1:02:16] is the thing that is talking about this
[1:02:18] happening today
[1:02:20] this divine revelation of the word made
[1:02:22] flesh today
[1:02:24] is the very thing you're basing your
[1:02:25] eternal salvation on
[1:02:27] and rejecting the very happening that's
[1:02:30] referred to
[1:02:31] in the book that you love so much
[1:02:36] because we're looking for natural things
[1:02:38] to happen
[1:02:39] a natural mountain and a natural voice a
[1:02:42] naturalness
[1:02:44] and it's all spiritual
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:53] when the son of man came brother
[1:02:57] says the son of man well we know the son
[1:03:00] of man is jesus christ
[1:03:03] the one that walked and dressed and ate
[1:03:05] and all that
[1:03:06] but when the son of man came it came in
[1:03:08] the ministry of william branham
[1:03:11] and you couldn't see that
[1:03:14] body that walked on the sea of galilee
[1:03:19] but you could see the sign of the
[1:03:22] messiah
[1:03:24] you could see the sign of the myth you
[1:03:26] could see it if you have
[1:03:27] eyes to see but it's the son of man
[1:03:31] but not the same way they saw the son of
[1:03:33] man last time they saw him
[1:03:36] is that fair the son of man came but he
[1:03:39] didn't come
[1:03:40] the same way the first time he came in a
[1:03:44] body a singular body of flesh
[1:03:46] was raised up was baptized went into the
[1:03:49] ministry
[1:03:50] but when the son of man come this time
[1:03:52] amen the son of man the person
[1:03:54] of the holy ghost himself came he came
[1:03:56] to work through a ministry of a prophet
[1:04:00] and you couldn't see him in the same
[1:04:03] form he was in the first time
[1:04:05] when he said the son of man must be
[1:04:06] lifted up
[1:04:08] do you understand that
[1:04:12] types shadows pointing to something else
[1:04:18] let's go to galatians chapter 4.
[1:04:23] sticking with paul here
[1:04:29] galatians chapter 4 verse 22.
[1:04:43] for it is written that abraham had two
[1:04:45] sons
[1:04:46] the one by a bond made the other by a
[1:04:48] free woman
[1:04:50] but he who was of the bondwoman was born
[1:04:52] after the flesh but he of the free woman
[1:04:54] but was by promise he's talking about
[1:04:57] hagar and he's talking about sarah the
[1:04:59] story that we know
[1:05:00] so well all the jews knew this story
[1:05:03] amen it was well known but it comes to
[1:05:05] the next verse he says
[1:05:07] which things are an allegory
[1:05:13] you know the whole deal with abraham
[1:05:17] being called out amen if abraham was
[1:05:21] really living this word amen he was
[1:05:24] really called away and separated from
[1:05:26] his father's house
[1:05:26] separated into a strange land separated
[1:05:29] from law
[1:05:30] amen then he had this issue and then he
[1:05:32] had a promise of a son but his wife
[1:05:33] couldn't bring
[1:05:34] forth and then she came up with the idea
[1:05:36] of hagar he accepted her idea
[1:05:38] went into hagar had ishmael amen now
[1:05:41] ishmael is not the one
[1:05:42] now it's got to come through sarah now
[1:05:44] she meets elohim on the plains amen and
[1:05:46] elohim begins to tell him
[1:05:48] about the destruction of sodom reveals
[1:05:50] the the the mystery in the heart of
[1:05:52] sarah
[1:05:52] amen all of these things are taking
[1:05:54] place amen
[1:05:56] and this isn't even the thing god wants
[1:05:57] to do
[1:05:59] this isn't even thing what's he doing
[1:06:01] he's laying down an
[1:06:02] allegory because when he comes to do it
[1:06:06] he wants to point back and say see
[1:06:08] now this is what i really have been
[1:06:10] wanting to do
[1:06:14] it wasn't that it was real for abraham
[1:06:16] it wasn't that he was really walking
[1:06:17] he was really walking and he was really
[1:06:19] living in it it was a reality amen
[1:06:22] but that reality was just a shadow
[1:06:25] just a type just an allegory so that the
[1:06:28] apostle paul would get back
[1:06:29] up here and he would say now these
[1:06:31] things are just an allegory it's not
[1:06:33] really about hagar
[1:06:34] it's not really about sarah it's not
[1:06:36] really about abraham
[1:06:39] listen to what he says
[1:06:43] i'll be in verse 23 again but he who was
[1:06:45] of the bondwoman was born after the
[1:06:47] flesh but he of the free woman was by
[1:06:49] promise
[1:06:50] which things are an allegory for these
[1:06:52] are the two
[1:06:53] covenants they're not even two births
[1:06:57] they're not even two babies they're two
[1:07:00] covenants
[1:07:02] how can paul do this to the scriptures
[1:07:07] because he has the mind of christ he's
[1:07:10] saying
[1:07:11] it's not what you think it is it's not
[1:07:13] about the babies
[1:07:14] it's not about abraham it's not sarah
[1:07:16] it's not hagar
[1:07:17] these are two covenants
[1:07:22] these are two covenants the one from
[1:07:24] mount sinai which gendereth the bondage
[1:07:26] which is
[1:07:27] agar for this agar is mount sinai in
[1:07:29] arabia and answers to jerusalem
[1:07:31] which now is is in bondage with her
[1:07:34] children
[1:07:34] but jerusalem which is above is free
[1:07:37] which is the mother of us all
[1:07:40] what what's paul
[1:07:43] what's paul even saying haggar
[1:07:46] is really two covenants haggar is really
[1:07:49] talking about
[1:07:50] amen uh sinai and sinai is pointing to
[1:07:53] jerusalem jerusalem is the old jewish
[1:07:55] religion we've been brought out of
[1:07:56] jerusalem
[1:07:57] into the new and living way into the way
[1:07:59] of grace amen
[1:08:00] and now the one is pointing to jerusalem
[1:08:03] natural
[1:08:04] the other one is pointing to jerusalem
[1:08:05] which is the mother of us all
[1:08:11] he's not talking natural he's speaking
[1:08:15] spiritual
[1:08:16] and he's taking cold hard facts
[1:08:20] that happen in the old testament and
[1:08:23] he's showing
[1:08:24] that's only a shadow that's only a time
[1:08:26] that's only
[1:08:27] that was only there so that i can come
[1:08:29] today
[1:08:30] and point to it and tell you the truth
[1:08:32] behind it
[1:08:33] praise god brother branham says
[1:08:39] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:08:41] he vindicated himself in daniel
[1:08:44] and in moses and in jeremiah what were
[1:08:46] they
[1:08:47] the prophets which the word came to see
[1:08:48] them great men
[1:08:50] see you've heard the story told of
[1:08:51] dreaming joseph you've seen
[1:08:53] in daniel and the lion's den and all
[1:08:54] these other ones you know them
[1:08:56] that that what they what were they
[1:08:58] prophets see but the
[1:09:00] the main one god was just temporarily
[1:09:03] typing
[1:09:03] in them he typed himself in adam
[1:09:07] knowing what was right but walked out to
[1:09:09] redeem his wife because she was wrong
[1:09:11] christ didn't have to be sin
[1:09:13] but he walked out and took sin to redeem
[1:09:15] his lost child
[1:09:16] see he typed he he typed himself
[1:09:20] so all of these men all these prophets
[1:09:22] all these patriarchs
[1:09:24] is just christ typing himself
[1:09:29] praise god sometimes
[1:09:33] sometimes we've got bible study down to
[1:09:35] where we know who birth to and what
[1:09:36] their name was and where you find them
[1:09:38] in the bible and what chapter joseph
[1:09:40] comes in
[1:09:41] and everything that happened to him and
[1:09:42] we can get in chronological order and
[1:09:44] have no
[1:09:45] idea what the story's about
[1:09:48] not a clue what it's actually about
[1:09:52] because it's not about amen it's not
[1:09:54] about joseph
[1:09:56] being sold into slavery it's about jesus
[1:09:58] christ being sold for 30 pieces of
[1:10:00] silver amen
[1:10:01] it's not about him going into prison
[1:10:03] it's about jesus going into this prison
[1:10:05] house on the cross
[1:10:06] it's not about his ascension to the
[1:10:08] right hand of
[1:10:09] pharaoh it's about christ's ascension to
[1:10:11] the right hand of god
[1:10:12] amen it's not about joseph it's about
[1:10:15] christ
[1:10:16] [Applause]
[1:10:18] and if we get stuck in joseph and we get
[1:10:20] stuck in abraham we're stuck in sarah
[1:10:22] and all we're looking at is ink blotches
[1:10:24] on paper and discerning it with an
[1:10:26] intellect
[1:10:27] we have no idea what the bible's really
[1:10:29] about but it's a
[1:10:30] love story that's showing us the
[1:10:32] threefold purpose of god
[1:10:36] we've come to the end time amen where
[1:10:38] these things are revealed where we can
[1:10:40] look back
[1:10:41] with eyes our eyes of understanding
[1:10:43] being open and we know it's nothing to
[1:10:44] do with joseph it's everything to do
[1:10:46] with christ
[1:10:47] nothing to do with moses everything to
[1:10:49] do with christ not about being bitten by
[1:10:51] an earthly snake amen
[1:10:53] and looking to an earthly image of brass
[1:10:56] and being healed it's about christ being
[1:10:58] lifted up
[1:10:59] amen to free us from the death sting
[1:11:01] that had come in the garden of eden
[1:11:03] amen it's not about what we think it's
[1:11:05] about it's about what we know by
[1:11:07] revelation it's about
[1:11:10] and the whole bible is about what we're
[1:11:12] living out today
[1:11:17] he goes on to say in christ the mystery
[1:11:18] of god revealed i've just pulled quotes
[1:11:19] from different spots they're not in
[1:11:21] order all these things typed him just in
[1:11:25] time but yet the
[1:11:26] mystery was hid them men didn't know
[1:11:28] what they were doing
[1:11:30] they only knew that they were led by the
[1:11:32] spirit to do some
[1:11:34] now holding it back in the last days for
[1:11:36] the great revelation
[1:11:40] but expressing it expressing himself in
[1:11:42] moses and david and joseph and elijah
[1:11:45] and on down through we we could take
[1:11:48] each one of those prophets and bring
[1:11:49] their lives out and show it express
[1:11:51] jesus christ perfectly exactly
[1:11:55] yet never give his secret in full
[1:11:58] waiting for to make it known in the last
[1:12:02] days as he promised waiting for it to be
[1:12:04] fully comprehended see
[1:12:05] before he could express it he told the
[1:12:08] whole thing
[1:12:09] if he told the whole thing because the
[1:12:11] bible is written in mysteries
[1:12:13] jesus thanked the father for it see that
[1:12:16] it was wrote in mysteries
[1:12:19] hallelujah even today when the mystery's
[1:12:22] been revealed
[1:12:24] it's still a mystery unless you have
[1:12:26] eyes to see and used to hear
[1:12:30] another quote out of christ is the
[1:12:32] mystery he has showed
[1:12:34] or revealed it in every type that's in
[1:12:37] the bible
[1:12:38] what's he talking about the seventh seal
[1:12:40] the coming of the lord
[1:12:42] he has showed it he has showed or
[1:12:44] revealed it in every type that's in the
[1:12:47] bible
[1:12:48] did the prophet say every type
[1:12:53] not just a few every type
[1:12:56] that's why when the seals opened it
[1:12:59] opened the entire bible
[1:13:01] this is why brother branham could say
[1:13:03] after the seals are open he says my
[1:13:05] bible has become a new book
[1:13:08] now listen listen friends this is a
[1:13:10] prophet of god
[1:13:12] with prophetic insight into the word who
[1:13:15] had received interpretations of
[1:13:17] scriptures
[1:13:18] by the word of god verbally to him
[1:13:21] telling him what these scriptures mean
[1:13:22] before the seals opened
[1:13:25] before the seals of god would say this
[1:13:27] is the interpretation of that scripture
[1:13:29] he'd have him the wind flipped to a
[1:13:30] certain page and ask a question
[1:13:32] and god would interpret it god told him
[1:13:34] before the seals opened
[1:13:36] jesus of the old testament jehovah's the
[1:13:38] old testament is jesus of the new.
[1:13:41] all of these things amen brother branham
[1:13:44] i was given an interpretation divinely
[1:13:46] by god
[1:13:47] on the scriptures he had a prophetic eye
[1:13:49] so that when we look at the scriptures
[1:13:50] he would see it through a prophetic eye
[1:13:52] amen when he's preaching in 53 my bible
[1:13:54] is becoming a new book
[1:13:57] when he's preaching in 55 my bible
[1:13:58] bible's becoming preaching in 60
[1:14:00] all of these times amen it's making the
[1:14:03] bible live
[1:14:04] but the prophet of god after all of that
[1:14:06] the gift of the prophecy
[1:14:08] preaching the word for so many years he
[1:14:10] can come to the opening of the seals
[1:14:12] and something in the opening of the
[1:14:14] seals change to where he says my
[1:14:16] bible has become a new book
[1:14:22] praise god he must have seen something
[1:14:24] in those seals
[1:14:26] since it must have struck him a
[1:14:28] particular way
[1:14:30] amen because he preached serpent seed
[1:14:31] godhead water baptism all those things
[1:14:33] he preached before the seals
[1:14:36] but something happened at the seals
[1:14:38] where he says my bible became a new book
[1:14:42] and he says when when the seals were
[1:14:44] taken off the bible it opened up the
[1:14:46] entire
[1:14:48] bible if it opened up the entire bible
[1:14:52] it's not
[1:14:53] just the parts he talked about
[1:14:57] but if it opened the entire bible it
[1:14:59] opened the entire
[1:15:00] bible and brother branham points
[1:15:04] he starts showing us that that title
[1:15:05] deed in the right hand of him that sits
[1:15:07] on the throne
[1:15:07] sealed with seven seals he tells us what
[1:15:09] that is he says
[1:15:10] that's the title deed of redemption
[1:15:12] that's the marriage certificate
[1:15:14] that's the bible that's
[1:15:17] that's the abstract title that's all of
[1:15:20] these he gives it all these names
[1:15:22] for that and he calls it the bible and
[1:15:24] he calls it whatever
[1:15:26] but then we see in revelations 10 that
[1:15:29] the seals are tore off and now that's an
[1:15:31] open book amen
[1:15:32] and the mighty angel comes down and he
[1:15:34] has it in his hand
[1:15:35] amen and john who's a type of the bride
[1:15:37] is told go to the angel with the open
[1:15:39] book
[1:15:40] and take it out of his hands and eat it
[1:15:42] up
[1:15:44] so now where is the open book the open
[1:15:48] bible amen the marriage certificate the
[1:15:51] title deed of redemption the abs
[1:15:52] where is it now it's in the bride it's
[1:15:55] in those who have eaten the book
[1:15:57] it's in her and she's told to prophesy
[1:16:00] again amen
[1:16:01] and she's not told to go outside of
[1:16:03] brother bennett's ministry she's not
[1:16:04] told to rise higher than brother
[1:16:06] branham that's not what she's told but
[1:16:07] she's told to take what he
[1:16:09] said and say it again
[1:16:12] amen we have no authority without a
[1:16:14] prophet
[1:16:16] we don't even understand the scriptures
[1:16:18] unless the prophet broke it down
[1:16:19] it's not it's not leaving the prophet
[1:16:21] it's taking what the prophet said
[1:16:23] what he showed us amen and he says i'm
[1:16:26] just hitting the high spots
[1:16:27] just enough so that you'll know it
[1:16:31] he said you search these things out
[1:16:36] that's why the bride is not afraid of
[1:16:38] the bible
[1:16:40] i said that before but she's not afraid
[1:16:42] she's not afraid of the book of exodus
[1:16:43] she's not afraid of the book
[1:16:44] ecclesiastes she's not afraid of
[1:16:46] proverbs she's not afraid of psalms
[1:16:47] she's not afraid of the song of solomon
[1:16:49] she's not afraid of revelation she's not
[1:16:51] afraid of galatians
[1:16:52] she's not afraid of leviticus
[1:16:55] there's no part in the bible that she
[1:16:57] stays away from and she's afraid of
[1:16:59] amen she's eaten the book amen the
[1:17:01] revelation
[1:17:02] with the threefold plan and this whole
[1:17:04] bible is sharing the same revelation
[1:17:07] one revelation one goal that he had in
[1:17:09] his mind from before the foundation of
[1:17:11] the world and everything in the bible's
[1:17:13] been typing
[1:17:13] every character has been bringing it
[1:17:15] forth
[1:17:19] hallelujah
[1:17:22] he showed it or revealed in every type
[1:17:24] that's in the bible therefore the entire
[1:17:26] bible
[1:17:28] is the revelation of god's mystery in
[1:17:30] christ
[1:17:32] hmm the entire bible
[1:17:35] is an expression of one goal that god
[1:17:37] had
[1:17:39] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:17:41] entire bible
[1:17:45] now can you see why brother bannon's
[1:17:46] bible became a new book
[1:17:48] now it's not old and new testament don't
[1:17:50] talk to me about old new testament
[1:17:52] it's one book with one purpose don't
[1:17:55] talk to me about to the jews and to the
[1:17:57] gentiles
[1:17:58] no no no not after the seals don't talk
[1:18:00] to me that way
[1:18:02] don't talk to me about that was for the
[1:18:04] book of hebrews was just for hebrew
[1:18:06] believers for messianic jews
[1:18:07] don't talk to me about the old testament
[1:18:09] or the levitical law was just
[1:18:11] don't you dare talk to me that way
[1:18:13] because this is my love letter
[1:18:15] amen this is my book amen that talks
[1:18:18] about the one purpose god had in his
[1:18:19] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:18:21] and when i read it
[1:18:22] i'm not looking for laws that apply amen
[1:18:25] there i'm looking for the revelation of
[1:18:27] the mystery
[1:18:29] to identify me in the day that i'm
[1:18:31] living in
[1:18:34] that's why brother branham's bible
[1:18:35] became a new book i believe
[1:18:40] you read this again the entire bible is
[1:18:42] an expression of one goal that god had
[1:18:43] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:18:45] entire bible
[1:18:46] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:18:48] bible has been in type
[1:18:50] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:18:53] all the acts of the believers
[1:18:57] there was some horrible acts of the
[1:18:59] believers
[1:19:01] but they're all working in this plan
[1:19:03] somewhere
[1:19:07] all the acts of the believers in the
[1:19:08] bible has been in type and expressing
[1:19:10] what god's great goal is
[1:19:12] and now this is my favorite part of the
[1:19:15] whole quote
[1:19:16] and now can you say now
[1:19:20] now in this last day
[1:19:23] he has revealed it
[1:19:27] and shows it
[1:19:31] so what are you waiting for a great
[1:19:34] revelation to come it's already come
[1:19:37] where is it how about digging in those
[1:19:39] tapes in those books and finding out
[1:19:41] because the revelations already come
[1:19:46] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:19:50] it and shows it
[1:19:53] and god's help well you'll see it right
[1:19:56] here this morning
[1:19:57] that's the only way you're going to see
[1:19:59] it is with god's help
[1:20:01] with god's help you'll see it right here
[1:20:02] this morning what the lord has had
[1:20:04] in his mind all along and has expressed
[1:20:07] it
[1:20:08] what do you think christ is the mystery
[1:20:09] of god revealed is all about it's all
[1:20:11] about the seventh seal
[1:20:13] it's all about the great mystery the one
[1:20:15] purpose that god had in his mind and he
[1:20:18] typed it in moses and he typed it in
[1:20:20] david he typed it in joseph he typed it
[1:20:22] he typed it typed it typed it typed it
[1:20:24] what's he doing he's showing one purpose
[1:20:26] one goal
[1:20:27] one plan that he's had all along that's
[1:20:30] the
[1:20:31] only way to read the bible
[1:20:35] with that one purpose in mind
[1:20:38] he goes on to say
[1:20:42] what's his purpose now express himself
[1:20:46] as a son see
[1:20:48] and now that in him might dwell the
[1:20:49] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:20:52] i've got colossians laying right laying
[1:20:54] here right before me see
[1:20:56] that all through the scripture that's
[1:20:57] what god's purpose was what was that the
[1:21:00] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:21:03] they're all through the scripture that's
[1:21:04] what god's purpose was then through this
[1:21:06] life of his son his cross the blood it
[1:21:09] says here
[1:21:10] of his cross that he might reconcile to
[1:21:12] himself a body a bride which is eve
[1:21:15] second eve and god give it in a type
[1:21:18] like he did moses and all of them
[1:21:20] the same thing he did in adam and eve
[1:21:21] giving a type that they were
[1:21:23] christ and the bride he is the second
[1:21:26] adam the church
[1:21:27] is the second eve hallelujah
[1:21:31] and adam was given a bride
[1:21:34] for what purpose for adam to reproduce
[1:21:37] himself on earth again
[1:21:38] and christ is given a bride for what
[1:21:40] purpose for him to reproduce himself on
[1:21:42] earth again
[1:21:44] i wrote this down if you've got a pen
[1:21:46] and paper and taken notes you might just
[1:21:48] want to drop these couple things down
[1:21:49] this is just something that meant
[1:21:50] something to me
[1:21:51] man it might not mean anything to you
[1:21:53] but it meant something to me
[1:21:56] brother branham says in the quote at a
[1:21:59] feast of the trumpets from 1964
[1:22:03] he says now how will the messiah the
[1:22:05] people that's believing him know it
[1:22:08] unless they're constantly in the word to
[1:22:10] know amen
[1:22:12] now lock that down because
[1:22:16] that's a reality
[1:22:20] you can't just take what the preacher
[1:22:22] says on sunday
[1:22:24] and on wednesday that is not enough
[1:22:27] you could be totally deceived by that
[1:22:29] and not know it
[1:22:31] how will the people that believe him
[1:22:33] know it unless they're constantly in the
[1:22:34] word to know
[1:22:36] what he is that's a key statement
[1:22:40] unless you're constantly in the word to
[1:22:42] know
[1:22:43] what he is
[1:22:52] the why daniel said the wise shall know
[1:22:55] but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know
[1:22:57] they shall know their god now how he
[1:23:00] shall appear in the last days
[1:23:02] is to bring the people back to the word
[1:23:05] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:23:07] know her mate the revealed word
[1:23:10] that's why this has to happen so who are
[1:23:13] you married to
[1:23:15] jesus christ but sometimes when we say
[1:23:19] jesus
[1:23:20] christ there's an image that flashes in
[1:23:21] our head of a man
[1:23:24] and that is jesus christ that's the body
[1:23:26] that he lived in that's a reality
[1:23:27] but brother branham's wanting us to
[1:23:29] catch another picture
[1:23:31] a deeper revelation of a greater truth
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] back to the words of the bride will know
[1:23:36] her husband
[1:23:38] know her mate the revealed word
[1:23:41] so who's your husband jesus christ who's
[1:23:44] jesus christ the revealed word
[1:23:47] you're marrying the revealed word you're
[1:23:50] in an invisible union with the revealed
[1:23:52] word
[1:23:52] amen the union today is between you in
[1:23:55] the revealed word
[1:23:58] that's why you can want jesus the man
[1:24:01] from galilee
[1:24:02] all you want amen but if you refuse him
[1:24:05] the revealed word
[1:24:06] you can't marry him unless you transport
[1:24:08] back two thousand years
[1:24:09] and bow at his feet and claiming as your
[1:24:11] savior you can't do that you've got to
[1:24:13] accept him in whatever form he's in
[1:24:15] today
[1:24:17] and today our husband our mate is the
[1:24:20] revealed word
[1:24:23] but brother branham tells us that the
[1:24:24] bride is the predestinated word
[1:24:27] is that true how many believe you're the
[1:24:30] predestinated word for the sound
[1:24:34] so the revealed word comes together with
[1:24:37] the predestinated word
[1:24:40] word comes to word life comes to life
[1:24:42] seed comes to seed
[1:24:45] so the revealed word comes to the
[1:24:47] predestinated word
[1:24:49] to what to bring a conception and what
[1:24:52] will they produce
[1:24:53] the manifested word
[1:24:57] so the revealed word comes to the
[1:25:00] predestinated word
[1:25:01] and only to the predestinated word
[1:25:04] and that's the bride the revealed word
[1:25:07] comes the predestinated word
[1:25:09] to bring forth the manifested word
[1:25:15] you can't the egg won't hatch unless
[1:25:17] it's been with the mail
[1:25:19] it can be right hand the right hand the
[1:25:22] hen is right
[1:25:23] the hint is correct she's producing eggs
[1:25:25] all the time there's no life inside of
[1:25:26] him unless she's been with the male
[1:25:28] but when she comes together with the
[1:25:30] male then that little egg will hatch and
[1:25:32] what will you get
[1:25:32] you'll get something else that looks
[1:25:34] like its father
[1:25:36] and this bride can be the predestinated
[1:25:39] word the predestinated word the
[1:25:40] predestinated word but until she's been
[1:25:42] with the male
[1:25:43] the revealed word there's never going to
[1:25:46] be a manifested word
[1:25:49] but when the when when when the
[1:25:52] predestinated word meets her husband
[1:25:55] the revealed word her mate and the
[1:25:57] revealed word and the predestinated word
[1:25:59] come together
[1:26:00] then you're going to have a
[1:26:02] manifestation of that union
[1:26:03] then you're going to have the
[1:26:04] manifestation manifestation of the word
[1:26:07] for this hour
[1:26:10] praise be to god
[1:26:14] let's turn to matthew chapter one
[1:26:18] i just want to end with a thought as we
[1:26:22] wind down i say words like that to
[1:26:24] encourage your heart
[1:26:27] to wake you up straighten up get the
[1:26:29] bible get excited
[1:26:32] because he said wind down wrap up
[1:26:36] that gives me another 15 20 minutes
[1:26:41] god bless you
[1:26:44] we started off talking about this i
[1:26:46] don't know a week or two ago
[1:26:48] in revelation uh sorry matthew chapter
[1:26:50] one
[1:26:51] in matthew chapter one the beginning of
[1:26:53] the new testament the beginning of the
[1:26:55] new testament starts off with the book
[1:26:56] of the generation of jesus christ
[1:26:58] the son of david the son of abraham we
[1:27:01] know that that includes two covenants
[1:27:02] the davidic covenant and the abrahamic
[1:27:04] covenant
[1:27:05] so it says abraham begot isaac isaiah
[1:27:07] begot jacob jacob begot judas
[1:27:09] and his brethren and judas begot pharas
[1:27:12] and zara of tamar
[1:27:14] so we're looking at this right at the
[1:27:17] opening of the new testament
[1:27:19] now the old testament closes out with
[1:27:22] behold i send
[1:27:23] you elijah the prophet before the great
[1:27:25] and dreadful day of the lord to turn the
[1:27:27] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:27:28] the heart of the children to the fathers
[1:27:30] so it ends the last two verses in the
[1:27:32] old testament
[1:27:33] ends with a prophecy predicting elijah
[1:27:37] coming to the bride the end time prophet
[1:27:41] so the end of the old testament has an
[1:27:44] end time prophet
[1:27:45] has god and has the bride behold i send
[1:27:48] you
[1:27:48] elijah the prophet and then the new
[1:27:52] testament opens up
[1:27:53] and it opens up with the generation of
[1:27:55] jesus christ
[1:27:56] and when you look at the generation of
[1:27:58] jesus christ it's going like every
[1:28:00] generation does
[1:28:01] male to male father to son father to son
[1:28:04] until it hits four women in this
[1:28:07] genealogy
[1:28:08] and these four women are tamar first
[1:28:13] so in verse three judas begot pharas and
[1:28:16] zero of tamar
[1:28:17] and pharaohs begot ezram and ezra and
[1:28:19] begot abraham and aram begot aminadab
[1:28:22] and amin ada begot niacin and nayasan
[1:28:25] begot solomon and solomon got
[1:28:27] boaz of rahab number two
[1:28:31] where he have the harlot and boazby got
[1:28:33] obed of ruth
[1:28:34] ruth to moabitus and obama begot jesse
[1:28:37] and jesse begot david the king
[1:28:39] and david that came begot solomon of her
[1:28:41] that had been wife of uriah
[1:28:43] bathsheba number four and solomon begot
[1:28:47] rehoboam and rehoboam began ebia and
[1:28:49] abia begat esa and it goes all the way
[1:28:51] through
[1:28:52] all the way down to verse 17 going
[1:28:54] through the genealogies
[1:28:56] so we find that the new testament opens
[1:28:58] up with a mystery
[1:29:00] and there's a mystery in laid right from
[1:29:02] the beginning in the generations of
[1:29:04] jesus christ
[1:29:05] and that mystery is a mystery of four
[1:29:07] women
[1:29:08] one two three four tamar
[1:29:12] rahab ruth and bathsheba
[1:29:16] now i just want to leave a thought with
[1:29:17] you i won't have time to get into
[1:29:19] everything
[1:29:20] that i wanted to lay down but i just
[1:29:21] want to i want to show
[1:29:24] that these women didn't always have a
[1:29:28] good reputation they didn't always come
[1:29:30] through a clean life
[1:29:31] there was some things with all four of
[1:29:33] them that was a
[1:29:34] it was a bit of a mystery a bit of a
[1:29:36] hard pill to swallow
[1:29:37] we know the life of tamar tamar married
[1:29:40] judah's oldest son er
[1:29:41] amen and judas was wicked and god
[1:29:44] despised him and god killed him
[1:29:46] so then she was given to the second son
[1:29:49] i think onan was his name
[1:29:50] and ona was to raise up seed for for his
[1:29:52] brother but he didn't want to do that
[1:29:56] so he refused to give her seed and then
[1:29:58] she was sent back to her father's house
[1:30:00] and judah said
[1:30:01] when my third son is older amen i'll
[1:30:03] give him to you
[1:30:04] you to him the wife to raise up seed for
[1:30:06] the dead amen but then when he was older
[1:30:09] she saw that he was
[1:30:10] she was not given to him when he was
[1:30:12] grown and she heard that
[1:30:14] judah had come down amen to
[1:30:17] come down to near her town and she went
[1:30:19] up there and played the part of a harlot
[1:30:23] when she played the part of a harlot
[1:30:25] judah come into her
[1:30:27] and she conceived and she bear
[1:30:32] twins what's the story telling us
[1:30:36] there's only one purpose there's only
[1:30:38] one thought of god
[1:30:39] there's there's only one thing god's
[1:30:41] trying to accomplish in all of this
[1:30:43] i don't want to dwell on that i want to
[1:30:45] get to that later but but then you come
[1:30:47] to
[1:30:48] rehab rahab is a harlot
[1:30:51] rahab is knowing all kinds of different
[1:30:53] men
[1:30:54] amen and no no no number of how many men
[1:30:57] that she had known and
[1:30:58] and she she comes to a place where she
[1:31:02] desires the god that she's hearing about
[1:31:05] she she tells the two spies that come in
[1:31:07] i have heard
[1:31:08] of what your god did everybody here
[1:31:10] trembles in fears
[1:31:12] we know what he's done amen and she's
[1:31:13] given a true token amen
[1:31:15] so each one of these women are
[1:31:16] representing redemption in one way or
[1:31:18] another
[1:31:19] she's given a true token and we realize
[1:31:22] that that we find out later in the bible
[1:31:24] that she marries solomon after she saved
[1:31:27] and the destruction of jericho
[1:31:29] she marries solomon and after she
[1:31:30] marries solomon and then she produces
[1:31:33] boaz boaz didn't have any problem taking
[1:31:37] ruth
[1:31:39] he was the product of solomon and rahab
[1:31:41] the harlot
[1:31:44] that didn't bother him a bit he saw in
[1:31:47] her righteousness
[1:31:50] and then you come to ruth and ruth is a
[1:31:52] moabitess and
[1:31:53] we have a man leaving the land with his
[1:31:55] wife and his two sons and the two sons
[1:31:56] marry women
[1:31:57] when they're in moab and they come back
[1:31:59] and the one refuses orpha refuses and
[1:32:02] and ruth comes along and we find out
[1:32:04] ruth is working and all the things that
[1:32:05] transpire
[1:32:06] but ruth amen has a righteous desire
[1:32:09] amen to give herself
[1:32:11] amen so that there can be redemption
[1:32:13] claims for naomi
[1:32:16] and so boaz takes her she has a child
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:19] we know that child is obed and obedient
[1:32:21] begets jesse and jessica gets david
[1:32:23] and then david at a time when kings go
[1:32:26] to war
[1:32:27] and david sends off his army sends all
[1:32:28] his troops stay home amen and
[1:32:30] he gets tempted by bathsheba and he
[1:32:33] calls for
[1:32:33] and they have an adulterous relationship
[1:32:36] she becomes pregnant he has uriah
[1:32:38] these are not clean stories these are
[1:32:41] not pleasant stories
[1:32:43] these are not the things that make the
[1:32:44] children's books
[1:32:48] these aren't the things you teach to
[1:32:50] your toddlers in detail
[1:32:53] but what's happening these this is the
[1:32:56] generation of jesus christ
[1:32:59] these women are predestinated
[1:33:02] ordained women to be in this line amen
[1:33:06] you believe that god orchestrates
[1:33:08] everything everything's ordained
[1:33:09] nothing's out of killer
[1:33:11] these were predestinated vessels to be
[1:33:14] placed in the position they were in
[1:33:17] but i looked at this and as i was
[1:33:19] reading through this something struck me
[1:33:23] tamar has a husband er
[1:33:26] god kills him no children
[1:33:29] no conception onan refuses next one
[1:33:32] refuses
[1:33:34] she doesn't have conception until she
[1:33:36] goes back to the original seed given
[1:33:39] she has to go through four stages of
[1:33:41] redemption justification sanctification
[1:33:43] baptism holy ghost to get to the baptism
[1:33:45] to the holy ghost himself she goes
[1:33:49] through the three stages of growth
[1:33:50] stalk tassel shuck to get back to the
[1:33:53] seat again
[1:33:54] she goes through lion ox man and eagle
[1:33:56] to come to the four stage
[1:33:58] what's the fourth stage back to the seed
[1:34:00] the original seed giver himself which is
[1:34:04] judah
[1:34:05] she married the firstborn the promise of
[1:34:07] the firstborn should have come through
[1:34:09] her womb
[1:34:11] the birthright should have come through
[1:34:12] a room the genealogy of jesus christ
[1:34:14] should have come through a room but he
[1:34:15] was wicked god killed him
[1:34:16] own and refused god killed him the
[1:34:18] second one was refused her so the only
[1:34:20] way that she could stay in her
[1:34:22] predestinated position
[1:34:23] was to go back to the original giver of
[1:34:26] seed
[1:34:27] himself do you see your story
[1:34:32] and then at the appointed time in the
[1:34:35] appointed place
[1:34:36] while she's playing the part of a harlot
[1:34:42] she's playing the part of a harlot and
[1:34:45] deceiving her
[1:34:46] father-in-law into giving her seed
[1:34:50] that's when god brings forth his
[1:34:52] appointed
[1:34:53] purpose that was in his mind all along
[1:34:58] how can this be right it's god
[1:35:04] look at rahab rahab is a harlot
[1:35:10] a harlot who's been with how many men
[1:35:14] no children no conception
[1:35:19] how can there be no conception because
[1:35:22] that's a predestinated wound
[1:35:26] that's a predestinated room reserved to
[1:35:29] bring
[1:35:30] forth the firstborn birthright
[1:35:33] in the line of the genealogy of christ
[1:35:36] it's almost as if when she comes to
[1:35:40] union with solomon now because the
[1:35:42] birthright's coming through solomon
[1:35:44] now as she comes into union with solomon
[1:35:46] it's almost as if god doesn't care about
[1:35:49] her past life
[1:35:51] it's almost as if god doesn't care how
[1:35:54] many men she slept with
[1:35:55] how many false doctrines she believes
[1:35:57] how many denominational churches she'd
[1:35:58] been in
[1:35:59] how many wrong ideas she's had and she's
[1:36:01] all of a sudden she's come to the time
[1:36:02] where now she's joined with the one and
[1:36:04] the right line and the genealogy of
[1:36:06] jesus christ was solomon in the
[1:36:07] birthright
[1:36:08] she's been pre-destinated for that
[1:36:10] position
[1:36:12] why was it she had a hungering in her
[1:36:14] heart when she heard about the red sea
[1:36:16] opening
[1:36:16] when she heard about the destruction of
[1:36:18] beijan and all her heart
[1:36:20] stirred within her everybody else
[1:36:22] trembled but she was getting excited
[1:36:25] what was it she's moving into her
[1:36:26] predestinated position
[1:36:28] amen when the two spies come when the
[1:36:30] witnesses come to her
[1:36:31] and begin to tell her the message she
[1:36:33] receives it amen she hides them and
[1:36:35] sends them out another way
[1:36:36] and she's given a true token
[1:36:39] for her and whoever will believe her
[1:36:43] and come under that token
[1:36:46] but there's no conception until the
[1:36:49] predestinated time
[1:36:52] and the predestinated place
[1:36:56] think about ruth ruth the moabitess
[1:37:00] she was married into the right line
[1:37:04] she was married into judah
[1:37:07] but they were outside the promised land
[1:37:10] they were outside the homeland and she's
[1:37:13] the predestinated vessel
[1:37:14] she's married to a man amen
[1:37:18] in judah but god takes the life of that
[1:37:21] man and her and naomi come back
[1:37:23] amen and she cannot conceive although
[1:37:26] it's her purpose
[1:37:27] it's her position amen she is the
[1:37:29] predestinated womb to bring forth the
[1:37:31] giant
[1:37:32] the furtherance of the genealogy of
[1:37:34] christ
[1:37:36] but until she gets to the right place
[1:37:40] and she gets in the right line which is
[1:37:43] boaz
[1:37:45] nothing's going to happen no conception
[1:37:51] you look at bathsheba bathsheba was
[1:37:54] married to uriah
[1:37:58] married living as married people
[1:38:01] no conception what's happening
[1:38:04] she has a predestinated position there
[1:38:07] is a predestinated womb right there
[1:38:10] to bring forth christ to bring forth
[1:38:13] solomon
[1:38:14] amen and all that happens amen i mean
[1:38:18] david does wicked david does wrong amen
[1:38:20] and he has
[1:38:21] he takes her to himself before the
[1:38:22] appointed time he has uriah killed and
[1:38:25] when ryan is dead he takes her and he
[1:38:26] marries her and then the first child
[1:38:28] that came through that relationship
[1:38:30] god took it died but he went into her
[1:38:32] again and he conceived and she brought
[1:38:34] forth what
[1:38:34] at the appointed time in the appointed
[1:38:36] place with a predestinated wound
[1:38:38] in an unlikely position and an unlikely
[1:38:41] person
[1:38:41] brings forth what brings forth solomon
[1:38:45] a type of jesus christ
[1:38:49] and you look at this and you begin to
[1:38:51] realize
[1:38:53] there's a chance for me
[1:38:57] i've believed wrong things
[1:39:01] i've been in wrong places
[1:39:04] i've been in denominations i've believed
[1:39:06] wrong things
[1:39:07] i've even been in this message and
[1:39:09] believed the wrong things
[1:39:13] i believe the wrong i believe the untrue
[1:39:15] amen i've been in the wrong spot
[1:39:17] in the wrong place in the wrong time but
[1:39:20] there's a predestinated womb in my soul
[1:39:22] and there's a place for this seed to
[1:39:24] come forth into life amen
[1:39:26] and it doesn't matter how many twists
[1:39:27] and how many turn and how many things go
[1:39:29] awry
[1:39:30] he's showing right here at the very
[1:39:32] beginning of the new testament
[1:39:33] that it doesn't matter the past life it
[1:39:35] doesn't matter which way you've come
[1:39:37] but there's only one thing that matters
[1:39:39] and that's the predestinated plan of god
[1:39:41] and when that right womb that
[1:39:43] predestinated vessel
[1:39:44] comes in contact with the right lineage
[1:39:46] then there's a conception where there
[1:39:48] was no conception before
[1:39:51] no babies to rahab no matter how many
[1:39:53] men she sleeps with no babies to ruth no
[1:39:55] matter how long she was married to her
[1:39:56] husband
[1:39:57] no baby's the bathsheba no matter how
[1:39:58] long she was married to uriah
[1:40:02] no baby for tamar why is the
[1:40:06] predestinated plan of god
[1:40:10] brother brahm says in the invisible
[1:40:12] union of the bride of christ
[1:40:14] you are the pure virtuous sinless
[1:40:19] bride of the son of the living god
[1:40:24] not because you've never made a mistake
[1:40:27] not because you have
[1:40:28] because you're a predestinated womb
[1:40:33] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:40:34] spirit of god and washed in the blood of
[1:40:36] jesus christ and believes every word of
[1:40:37] god stands
[1:40:38] as though you never sinned at the first
[1:40:41] place
[1:40:42] you are perfect
[1:40:45] how could bathsheba bring forth solomon
[1:40:48] amen because she was predestinated to
[1:40:51] bring forth solomon
[1:40:52] there's nothing going to stop god's
[1:40:54] predestinated plan
[1:40:55] bathsheba sin david's sin nobody else's
[1:40:58] sin
[1:40:59] is going to stop the predestinated plan
[1:41:01] again of god
[1:41:02] neither is your mistakes or your sins or
[1:41:04] your affairs going to stop the
[1:41:06] predestinated plan of god
[1:41:10] further in the invisible union says
[1:41:12] you're standing
[1:41:13] completely you never sinned at the first
[1:41:17] place
[1:41:17] don't god even know god don't even know
[1:41:20] it's in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:41:22] you never did it you were accused of it
[1:41:24] by the accuser
[1:41:25] but really from the beginning you were
[1:41:27] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:41:29] of god
[1:41:30] you're standing there washed and your
[1:41:32] old book of divorcement is put away
[1:41:34] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[1:41:36] even in the mind of god
[1:41:39] you're the virtuous bride of christ
[1:41:41] washed in the blood of christ
[1:41:42] precious virtuous sinless son of god
[1:41:45] standing with a pure
[1:41:46] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[1:41:49] by the water of his own blood
[1:41:51] that became flesh and manifested that he
[1:41:53] might take you
[1:41:54] which were predestinated in the bosom of
[1:41:56] the father before the beginning
[1:41:59] the same as he was
[1:42:03] you're just as predestinated as jesus
[1:42:06] christ
[1:42:12] both have come from the bosom of the
[1:42:13] father
[1:42:16] both have come from the mind of god
[1:42:20] both have been placed in your position
[1:42:23] in your time for a certain manifestation
[1:42:26] to portray
[1:42:27] this one goal that he had in his mind
[1:42:32] and nothing is going to stop that one
[1:42:34] goal
[1:42:36] that's why you come into the new
[1:42:37] testament you start reading right here

[1:42:42] through the church ages through the
[1:42:43] first four seals

[1:43:47] these women after they had come into
[1:43:49] their predestinated plan
[1:43:50] and they had received the right seed
[1:43:52] from the right lens from the right sword

[1:44:34] you understand christ and his alone
[1:44:36] already finished
[1:44:37] the seed was there the seed was all
[1:44:38] ready when was it put there
[1:44:40] before the foundation of the world has
[1:44:43] predestinated us into eternal life
[1:44:45] that seed that was laying down in you
[1:44:47] that came to life when the word came to
[1:44:49] the word
[1:44:50] amen and sprung to life it was put there
[1:44:52] before the foundation of the world
[1:44:55] it wasn't there it didn't come in when
[1:44:57] you come to the altar amen
[1:44:58] it was there it was the thing driving
[1:45:00] you to the altar
[1:45:03] hallelujah it was the thing that god was
[1:45:05] pulling on
[1:45:07] i mean he wasn't pulling on your
[1:45:08] emotions he was pulling in that seed
[1:45:11] that's on the inside
[1:45:12] pulling himself back to himself again
[1:45:18] but before the foundation of the world
[1:45:19] has predestinated us into eternal life
[1:45:21] and as soon as the life forgiving flow
[1:45:23] that seed laying there
[1:45:24] other seeds that just would come in
[1:45:27] wouldn't take hold
[1:45:29] just couldn't do it like but when that
[1:45:31] seed come in quickly it stopped up the
[1:45:33] womb
[1:45:34] all the rest of the seed was drove out
[1:45:35] see like that
[1:45:39] amen amen how can he say you're the
[1:45:42] sinless
[1:45:43] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:45:46] when we know our past when we know
[1:45:50] what we've believed and how we've acted
[1:45:52] and how we've made
[1:45:53] mockery of the things of god and how we
[1:45:55] knew better and did wrong anyways
[1:45:57] and how we had premeditated sin in our
[1:45:59] life and all of these other things
[1:46:00] how we know that but now he says you're
[1:46:03] the sinless spotless
[1:46:04] amen and we believed false doctrine and
[1:46:07] we believed trinitarian and we had taken
[1:46:08] trinitarian baptisms and we had done all
[1:46:10] of these other things how
[1:46:12] can we be the sinless spotless bride of
[1:46:14] jesus christ
[1:46:16] i'll tell you how none of those seeds
[1:46:18] took hold
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:20] trinitarian didn't take hold amen and
[1:46:23] then false doctrine didn't take hold
[1:46:25] wrong ideas
[1:46:26] it never took hold the only thing that
[1:46:28] could took a hold is
[1:46:29] something that's the same species
[1:46:34] amen only the same species no
[1:46:36] hybridization can bring forth life
[1:46:38] and if that life and the inside of your
[1:46:40] soul is hybrid you can come to life
[1:46:42] through hybrid seed
[1:46:43] but if it's not hybrid seed if it come
[1:46:46] from the original source if it come from
[1:46:48] god and it's laying in the soul
[1:46:49] when that original seed hits it again it
[1:46:52] doesn't matter how many seeds have been
[1:46:53] trying to flush over
[1:46:54] and how many seeds have been trying to
[1:46:56] impregnate there could be no
[1:46:58] impregnation
[1:46:59] until the original seed comes in and the
[1:47:02] original seed is the same
[1:47:04] species and you can't reproduce
[1:47:06] hybridization
[1:47:08] it's got to be the same species
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:13] cat seed can never impregnate a dog
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:17] cow seed can never impregnate a deer
[1:47:22] it's got to be the same seed
[1:47:25] no matter what we've been through no
[1:47:28] matter where we've been
[1:47:29] there's a predestinated wound there
[1:47:31] there's a predestinated seed laying
[1:47:33] there and no matter what was trying to
[1:47:35] flush
[1:47:36] through what was trying to bring forth
[1:47:38] life nothing happened
[1:47:39] nothing happened nothing happened
[1:47:41] nothing happened amen married to this
[1:47:43] and married to that
[1:47:44] and living in adultery living a
[1:47:46] heartless life nothing was taking place
[1:47:48] nothing was taking place but then you
[1:47:50] come in contact with the original seed
[1:47:52] giver again
[1:47:53] you've come back amen to the holy ghost
[1:47:56] himself
[1:47:57] and then when he comes in all of a
[1:47:58] sudden it's the original seed
[1:48:00] striking the original seed and the two
[1:48:03] come together
[1:48:04] and there's conception and now christ is
[1:48:06] coming forth
[1:48:12] that's why these women there's no record
[1:48:13] of any babies
[1:48:16] they have she cries out for her father
[1:48:19] and her mother and her family but not
[1:48:20] for her children
[1:48:23] tamar no record of children ruth no
[1:48:26] record of children but
[1:48:27] bathsheba no record of children
[1:48:31] because it was the wrong source
[1:48:35] that's why the wrong source
[1:48:38] oh it tried to find its way in
[1:48:42] come into the womb of your mind and
[1:48:44] tried to pollute your mind with all
[1:48:45] kinds of ideas
[1:48:47] but there was another womb of that soul
[1:48:50] and then there laid the original seed
[1:48:53] and nothing could take hold to that
[1:48:54] original word come back
[1:48:57] and the original word on the original
[1:48:59] seed
[1:49:00] brought it to life then quickly all
[1:49:02] other seeds were flushed out the wound
[1:49:04] was sealed
[1:49:04] and now you cannot commit adultery
[1:49:08] why by the revelation of the word we
[1:49:10] know the truth we know now
[1:49:12] none of these women go backwards they
[1:49:14] stay
[1:49:15] in the generation of jesus christ
[1:49:21] brother says in the spoken word is the
[1:49:23] original seed
[1:49:25] and when this bride comes she'll be the
[1:49:27] same product that he is
[1:49:29] virgin you mean living the way i lived
[1:49:33] he's not talking natural he's talking
[1:49:35] spiritual
[1:49:39] did christ belong to a denomination to
[1:49:41] jehovah neither does his bride she is
[1:49:43] part of him
[1:49:44] she needs no dogma she won't have any
[1:49:46] shall be absolutely virgin
[1:49:48] how by the word
[1:49:52] amen she'll punctuate every word of god
[1:49:54] say with amen
[1:49:56] amen oh be it unto me according to thy
[1:49:58] word amen

[1:50:09] have a virgin womb because she'll be
[1:50:11] birthed
[1:50:11] out of a virgin womb which is the word
[1:50:14] what were you birthed by trinitarian
[1:50:17] baptism
[1:50:18] no that didn't birth you were you
[1:50:19] birthed amen
[1:50:21] under sectarianism were you birthed
[1:50:23] under the baptist were you birth
[1:50:24] no the only way you can have a virgin
[1:50:27] womb
[1:50:27] is to be birthed by the word and if
[1:50:30] you're birthed by the word
[1:50:31] then you're birthed with the virgin womb
[1:50:33] and now you receive the word and the
[1:50:35] word comes forth from a virgin womb
[1:50:38] not physical spiritual
[1:50:44] having a virgin womb what will she come
[1:50:46] out of a virgin womb the word
[1:50:48] what did jesus come out of a virgin womb
[1:50:50] see

[1:50:53] pregnant she had done something
[1:50:55] she was mixed she was hybrid the child
[1:50:57] and it died
[1:50:58] but when joseph come to his bride she
[1:51:00] was pregnanted
[1:51:01] but with life adam's wife or adam's
[1:51:04] bride

[1:51:22] but when joseph the human came to his
[1:51:24] wife glory can't hardly hold her

[1:51:28] god flesh
[1:51:29] in her womb bring back that spoken word
[1:51:33] bring
[1:51:34] back that word of god which was word
[1:51:35] there came through
[1:51:37] a human's womb amen god will do it
[1:51:40] anyhow he's spoken
[1:51:41] and it's got to be so amen
[1:51:46] there's a predestinated womb
[1:51:49] and in that womb is a predestinated seed
[1:51:53] and only in god's appointed time
[1:51:57] in god's appointed place when you meet
[1:52:00] the male
[1:52:02] your mate the revealed word
[1:52:08] that's your predestinated position
[1:52:11] that's what you had
[1:52:12] the part you had to play in the mind of
[1:52:14] god before the foundation of the world
[1:52:16] was to bring forth christ in this
[1:52:17] generation and the only way you could do
[1:52:19] it is to come into this life
[1:52:21] and wait and wait and wait
[1:52:24] for your mate the revealed word
[1:52:28] and when that comes in the revealed word
[1:52:31] to the predestinated word
[1:52:35] now you have manifested word manifested
[1:52:38] where
[1:52:39] in the flesh of the bride
[1:52:44] aren't you happy that you're a
[1:52:46] typologist
[1:52:50] aren't you happy you can read the first
[1:52:53] six verse
[1:52:54] seven six verses in the new testament
[1:52:56] and see yourself
[1:52:58] right there i've been wrong i've done
[1:53:01] wrong i've traveled wrong rows
[1:53:04] but it wasn't any of that that mattered
[1:53:06] anymore
[1:53:07] what changed every one of these women
[1:53:09] what changed their future we know their
[1:53:11] past
[1:53:11] what changed their future when they came
[1:53:13] into a correct union with the correct
[1:53:15] seed giver
[1:53:16] everything in their life changed and now
[1:53:19] according to the new testament
[1:53:20] nothing in the old the old matters
[1:53:22] anymore it doesn't matter anymore
[1:53:24] now what matters is at the right time
[1:53:25] they came into the right union with the
[1:53:27] right seed giver and they brought forth
[1:53:29] the right seed
[1:53:31] and that changes the narration of the
[1:53:33] bible
