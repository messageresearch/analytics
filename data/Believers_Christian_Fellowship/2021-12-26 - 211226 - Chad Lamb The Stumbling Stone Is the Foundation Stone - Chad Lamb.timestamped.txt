[14:21] [Music]
[14:28] [Music]
[14:31] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[14:34] dear lord jesus we thank you father
[14:37] for the privilege of gathering together
[14:39] like this once again and lord as we sing
[14:41] your praises
[14:43] we believe by your word that you're here
[14:45] abiding in the praises of your people
[14:47] for you told us you would be
[14:50] and while we pray you'd find welcome in
[14:51] this place this morning and welcome in
[14:53] our hearts of the lord as we yield
[14:55] ourselves into you as we worship you
[14:57] lord
[14:58] now as we look into your word we pray
[15:00] god that you would do what no man can do
[15:03] but that you would come and break the
[15:04] bread of life with your own hands lord
[15:07] that you would feed your waiting sheep
[15:08] that we might receive the portion that
[15:10] we have need of god that you might lead
[15:12] us in the way that is right and that you
[15:14] might be glorified in all we say or do
[15:16] for we commit this service into your
[15:18] hands we commit ourselves into your
[15:20] hands and pray that you would take
[15:21] preeminence among us
[15:23] be blessed be glorified and may your
[15:25] children be edified
[15:26] we ask in jesus christ's name
[15:29] amen
[15:31] man god bless you all it's good to see
[15:32] you this morning while we're standing if
[15:34] we could turn to matthew chapter two
[15:36] we'll begin with that verse
[15:38] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[15:40] judea and the days of herod the king
[15:43] behold there came wise men from the east
[15:45] to jerusalem
[15:46] saying where is he that is born king of
[15:48] the jews for we have seen his star in
[15:50] the east and are come to worship him may
[15:54] the lord add the blessing to the reading
[15:55] of the word as you seeded may god have
[15:57] his way
[16:00] amen i wanted to start in the scripture
[16:02] this is not exactly where i'm heading to
[16:04] but i'd like to take for a text this
[16:06] morning by the grace of god the
[16:08] stumbling stone is the foundation stone
[16:11] so if we can
[16:12] register that in our minds it's a simple
[16:14] message but is this something that's
[16:15] heavy on my heart the stumbling stone is
[16:18] the foundation stone
[16:20] so we see here
[16:23] and we know so much about christmas and
[16:25] this is christmas season and and so you
[16:27] know you see that the wise men they
[16:29] journeyed from the east because they
[16:30] were led by a star and a star was
[16:33] leading them uh leading them to christ
[16:35] they knew by the star that christ was on
[16:38] earth and he was born king of the jews
[16:40] and so they went to jerusalem because it
[16:42] seemed like the most logical place to go
[16:44] so
[16:45] if there's a star that's indicating that
[16:48] that christ is born then you would go to
[16:50] the headquarters of the religion of the
[16:52] world in that day and you would go to
[16:54] the to the main headquarters of the main
[16:56] system and you would go there to look
[16:58] for this christ that's come
[17:00] amen but when the wise men got there it
[17:02] seemed as nobody knew what they were
[17:04] talking about they had seen the star the
[17:07] wise men had but those in the system
[17:09] hadn't seen the star
[17:10] they were blinded to it amen others
[17:13] could see it from outside the system but
[17:15] the ones who were in the system that was
[17:17] supposed to be god's system they were
[17:18] blind to the star that was indicating
[17:21] that christ was on earth
[17:23] and brother venom says
[17:25] in the message there is a man here that
[17:26] can turn on the light
[17:28] said oh we have seen his star in the
[17:30] east and we come to worship him
[17:32] and when they lined up in jerusalem the
[17:34] denominational headquarters they didn't
[17:35] have the answer they went up and down
[17:37] the streets crying where is he born king
[17:39] of the jews they know nothing about it
[17:42] so they called on the word to find out
[17:44] they had followed know that star was
[17:46] leading them to eternal light
[17:49] again brother brahm says in god's rap
[17:51] gift as long as they was in them
[17:53] denominational realms that star never
[17:55] did appear to them
[17:58] it went out of the gates of jerusalem
[18:00] and stayed out brother stayed out as
[18:02] long as they walked through those
[18:03] denominational realms where is he surely
[18:06] you pastors ought to know something
[18:07] about it what's this all about you
[18:09] rabbis and you priests and you
[18:11] methodists and baptist presbyterian
[18:12] catholics and you old churches like that
[18:15] surely you got an answer for it where is
[18:17] he oh my see they know nothing about it
[18:21] and them that were in there stayed in
[18:23] darkness till they came out of it
[18:26] so when the wise men were there they
[18:27] lost sight in the denominational church
[18:30] when they went into jerusalem into the
[18:32] walled city into the denominational
[18:34] walls they lost sight of that star so
[18:36] they were depending on the rabbis and
[18:38] the religious leaders to tell them they
[18:40] knew that that star was indicating
[18:42] christ was on earth and they followed
[18:44] the leadership of that star to come to
[18:46] the headquarters of the religion of that
[18:48] day and surely in here they would know
[18:52] where this christ where this fulfillment
[18:54] of the word for our day is taking place
[18:57] and when they were in the walled city in
[18:59] the denominational walls they lost sight
[19:01] of the star and they could not see it
[19:03] until they walked back out of the gate
[19:05] and when they left that system the star
[19:07] appeared again
[19:10] and we know that we followed a star in
[19:12] this day the seventh star amen the
[19:14] seventh angel the messenger amen and
[19:17] that messenger has led us to christ and
[19:19] that messenger indicated that christ is
[19:21] on the earth again amen
[19:23] and in the walled cities they know
[19:25] nothing about it amen they don't know
[19:26] what you're talking about you go to the
[19:28] to the religious systems to the
[19:30] headquarters of religion in this day and
[19:32] you ask them amen that star amen i saw
[19:35] that star amen the seventh star showing
[19:38] me that christ is coming this day amen
[19:41] and you asked them about that and they
[19:42] blank stairs we don't know we didn't see
[19:44] any star we don't know what you're
[19:45] talking about
[19:49] and as long as they stayed in there they
[19:51] stayed in darkness till they came out
[19:53] and as soon as they got out of the city
[19:54] there stood the star again
[19:57] let's look here in matthew chapter 2
[19:59] down to verse 9.
[20:03] this is the wise men again when they
[20:05] heard the king they departed and lo the
[20:07] star which they saw in the east went
[20:08] before them till it came and stood over
[20:11] where the young child was
[20:13] when they saw the star they rejoiced
[20:15] with exceeding great joy
[20:19] it wasn't that the star was not able to
[20:21] lead them all the way to christ is when
[20:23] the star appeared amen from the east to
[20:25] the west and it appeared amen it was
[20:27] near jerusalem and because bethlehem was
[20:30] not far from jerusalem amen then
[20:33] because they knew christ was here they
[20:35] went to the most logical place to find
[20:37] him but he wasn't there because christ
[20:39] can't be born in the system he has to be
[20:41] born outside the walls of the system
[20:44] and when christ came in this day he did
[20:46] not come in the system he had to come
[20:48] outside the system
[20:50] you have to find him outside the systems
[20:52] of man and outside the religious orders
[20:54] of the day amen because he's not going
[20:56] to be found in such he's not going to be
[20:58] bound by such amen but where did they
[21:00] find him they found him amen where the
[21:03] where the where the word said they would
[21:05] find him and bethlehem the house of
[21:07] god's bread because he was the manna
[21:09] that came down from god out of heaven he
[21:11] was our portion to feast on and in this
[21:14] day he's the manna that's come down from
[21:16] heaven again amen in our portion of the
[21:18] word for this day to feast on amen and
[21:21] he was not born amen in a system he was
[21:24] not born in a walled city praise god
[21:27] brother brahma says in the message of
[21:29] guide
[21:30] so you see these wise men remember when
[21:33] they entered into jerusalem the star
[21:35] disappeared
[21:36] and as long as you look for creeds and
[21:38] denominational men to lead you to god
[21:40] the help of god will leave you
[21:42] but when you get sick and tired of it
[21:45] and left them left the creeds and
[21:46] denominations of those jews and went out
[21:49] of jerusalem then the star appeared
[21:50] again and they rejoiced with exceeding
[21:53] great joy
[21:55] you know when when the prophet of god
[21:57] was here the seventh angel that star and
[22:00] the hand of god amen he was shining and
[22:03] as he began to shine he began to
[22:05] indicate that now it's time for christ
[22:07] to return
[22:09] to the church
[22:10] and he was shining that star was shining
[22:13] over jerusalem trying to get the
[22:15] attention of the church but they didn't
[22:17] see it and they testified to the wise
[22:19] men that they didn't know what they were
[22:21] talking about amen and it was shining
[22:23] over them trying to get their attention
[22:25] and the prophet of god in our day amen
[22:27] he was shining that light over all the
[22:30] denominations amen but they were blind
[22:32] and could not see what the star was
[22:34] showing amen they saw a movement they
[22:37] saw a work they saw healing campaigns
[22:39] they saw discernment and they heard
[22:41] testimonies but they didn't recognize
[22:43] what the star was for
[22:46] they couldn't see
[22:48] the position of the star and the timing
[22:50] of the star and the appearance of the
[22:52] constellation showing what time we are
[22:55] on earth and it's time for him to appear
[23:00] and so the systems missed it they didn't
[23:02] know anything about it amen because he
[23:04] didn't show up in the systems he was
[23:06] just shining over them to get their
[23:08] attention but but you couldn't find him
[23:10] there
[23:12] for he was outside the walls
[23:16] and in order to be united with him do
[23:18] you brother bam told us you have to go
[23:19] beyond the camp you have to go outside
[23:21] jerusalem
[23:23] for he was born outside jerusalem and he
[23:25] was crucified outside jerusalem amen he
[23:28] was rejected and he was cast out and he
[23:30] was crucified and now to be united with
[23:33] the one who came to save us to be united
[23:36] with the one who came to redeem us he
[23:38] was born outside the system and he was
[23:40] crucified outside the system in order to
[23:42] be united with him you yourself have to
[23:44] go outside of the system
[23:47] and when you step outside of the system
[23:49] sure enough that star that seven star is
[23:51] there to lead you all the way to christ
[23:53] because christ is the same as he was in
[23:55] that day he is today for he's jesus
[23:58] christ the same yesterday today and
[24:00] forever what was he in that day he was
[24:02] the very word of god the prophecy for
[24:04] that day made manifest in flesh that's
[24:07] what he was what is he today the very
[24:10] same thing he was in that day he is the
[24:12] word of god the prophecy for this day
[24:15] made flesh and manifest in this day what
[24:18] he was then he is today he's the same
[24:21] yesterday today and forever
[24:24] then he was a baby laying in a manger
[24:27] now he's being formed into the bride
[24:31] but what is it the same jesus christ the
[24:33] same
[24:34] yesterday today and forever what has he
[24:36] always been he has always been the word
[24:39] made flesh in your day
[24:41] that's what he was in moses day that's
[24:43] what he is today making him the same in
[24:45] moses day as he is in this day
[24:48] not the same actions not the same thing
[24:51] you see with your eyes but the very same
[24:54] christ that was with moses is the very
[24:56] same christ that's with the bride
[24:58] today he's the same yesterday today and
[25:01] forever
[25:03] that's what makes him the same he is the
[25:05] word made manifest in the day and the
[25:07] hour that we live in
[25:10] people want to see the same they want to
[25:11] see the same picture the same image the
[25:13] same nail prints in the hands the same
[25:16] scar upon the brow the same shoulder
[25:18] length hair the same beard they want to
[25:20] see jesus christ the same in the same
[25:23] physical appearance in the same image
[25:25] and that's why they can't see him
[25:27] because he's the same
[25:29] but not in the same manifestation he was
[25:32] in the proper manifestation for that day
[25:34] and now he's in the proper manifestation
[25:36] for this day making him the same
[25:39] yesterday today and forever
[25:42] if you want to find him
[25:45] that was born king of the jews you want
[25:47] to find him that is the head and the
[25:49] husband to the bride amen you have to go
[25:51] outside the city and you got to let the
[25:53] star lead you to him
[25:56] praise be to god
[26:00] let's go to luke chapter 2.
[26:12] it's interesting when you get into
[26:14] christmas time and christmas season and
[26:16] hear you know so many people talk about
[26:19] christmas and christmas stories and and
[26:21] i'm sure in churches all over america
[26:23] last sunday and wednesday and this
[26:24] sunday there's christmas sermons and
[26:27] but but there's so much that is missed
[26:29] when the star hasn't led you to christ
[26:33] we're talking about tradition and we're
[26:35] talking about things that have come and
[26:37] things that have gone
[26:38] and been things that where christ was
[26:41] but nobody's talking about where christ
[26:43] is or at least there's very few that's
[26:45] talking about where christ is today
[26:47] we're talking about a christmas story
[26:48] that happened 2000 years ago and not
[26:50] realizing that he came now
[26:53] that he's here among us amen
[26:55] that we're not looking back amen we're
[26:58] looking to the day that we live in to
[26:59] find christ
[27:02] and so the christmas story for us is not
[27:05] an old story
[27:07] and the christmas story for us is not a
[27:09] one time of your story
[27:11] but the christmas story for us is god's
[27:13] wrapped gift
[27:15] and god's wrapped gift is still here
[27:16] it's just in a different package
[27:18] it's just in a different wrapping it's
[27:20] not wrapped the same way it was wrapped
[27:22] in that day when his gift showed up
[27:23] there was a wrapping in that day and he
[27:25] was wrapped in swaddling cloth amen that
[27:28] was the rapping that day a baby in a
[27:30] manger and that body of flesh amen but
[27:32] it's the same gift that was there is the
[27:34] same gift that's here amen this is
[27:36] christmas for us too but it's just a
[27:38] different package it's wrapped in a
[27:39] different wrapping amen so don't let the
[27:42] rapping throw you off it's the same gift
[27:45] for us every day is christmas
[27:51] amen
[27:53] amen we're living because this gift is
[27:56] now wrapped in you and i
[28:00] that swaddling cloth brother venom said
[28:02] that they wrapped that first christmas
[28:04] gift in they said he goes i was told it
[28:07] was a it was an old cloth taken off a
[28:09] yoke of an ox just an old dirty cloth
[28:11] put there to to to put a cushion between
[28:14] the wooden yoke and the ox's neck so it
[28:17] was dirty it had ox hair in it smelled
[28:19] like hot ox and had ox sweat
[28:24] and that was what was taken and and
[28:27] that's what brother ben tells us that he
[28:28] was told he'd taken and wrapped jesus in
[28:30] that and that swaddling cloth amen
[28:33] and if god amen could allow himself to
[28:36] come into flesh and be birthed as the
[28:38] son of god upon this earth and allow
[28:40] that precious son to be wrapped in such
[28:43] a dirty such a such an unwanted and
[28:46] undesirable rapping can he wrap himself
[28:49] in you today amen amen how can he not
[28:52] use you if he can use a a a yolk a cloth
[28:55] out of a yoke for a swaddling cloth can
[28:57] he wrap himself in you and i today
[29:00] amen they're still he's here amen the
[29:02] gift is here but but don't look at the
[29:05] package look what's inside the package
[29:09] the gift isn't the wrapping
[29:12] the gift is inside
[29:15] amen
[29:16] let's look at luke chapter 2 verse 21
[29:25] and when eight days were accomplished
[29:27] for the circumcision of the child his
[29:28] name was called jesus which was so named
[29:31] of the angel before he was conceived in
[29:32] the womb
[29:34] and when the days of her purification
[29:35] according to the law of moses were
[29:37] accomplished they brought him to
[29:39] jerusalem to present him to the lord as
[29:41] it is written in the law of the lord
[29:43] every male that opened at the womb shall
[29:45] be called holy to the lord and to offer
[29:47] a sacrifice according to that which is
[29:49] said in the law of the lord a pair of
[29:51] turtledoves or two young pigeons and
[29:54] behold there was a man excuse me in
[29:56] jerusalem
[29:58] whose name was simeon and the same man
[30:00] was just and devout waiting for the
[30:02] consolation of israel and the holy ghost
[30:04] was upon him
[30:05] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[30:08] ghost that he should not see death
[30:10] before he had seen the lord's christ and
[30:12] he came by the spirit into the temple
[30:14] and when the parents brought in the
[30:16] child jesus to do for him after the
[30:18] custom of the law then took he up in his
[30:20] arms and blessed god and said lord now
[30:23] let us thy thou thy servant depart in
[30:25] peace according to thy word for mine
[30:28] eyes have seen thy salvation which thou
[30:30] has prepared before the face of all
[30:32] people
[30:33] a light to lighten the gentiles and the
[30:35] glory of thy people israel
[30:37] and joseph and his mother marveled at
[30:39] those things which were spoken of him
[30:42] and simeon blessed them and said unto
[30:44] mary his mother behold this child is set
[30:47] for the fall and rising again of many in
[30:48] israel and for a sign which shall be
[30:51] spoken against
[30:52] yea a sword shall pierce through thine
[30:54] own so also
[30:56] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[30:58] revealed
[31:00] so i want to pay attention to those last
[31:02] two verses that we read verse 34 and 35
[31:06] i want to look at this
[31:07] if you look at the beginning of verse 35
[31:09] there's a there's a statement in
[31:11] parentheses and the state in parentheses
[31:13] is is another thought it's an injected
[31:15] thought injected into the sentence and
[31:17] is telling that yeah a sword shall
[31:18] pierce through thine own so also amen
[31:21] because she was going to see the
[31:22] sufferings of christ
[31:24] but but so i don't want to read that
[31:26] when i read the context of what simeon's
[31:28] saying because that's an injected
[31:29] thought so i want to go back and pick
[31:31] this up and i'm just not going to read
[31:33] that part
[31:35] he says behold this child is set for the
[31:37] fall and rising again of many in israel
[31:41] so when when simeon picks up this baby
[31:45] and we know that this is the christ
[31:46] child when he picks up this this
[31:49] prophesied word this word made flesh and
[31:52] he's holding in his arms
[31:54] when we
[31:55] listen to christmas stories and nominal
[31:58] denominational teaching on christmas
[32:00] amen it was jesus who come to to save
[32:03] the world and that that's absolutely the
[32:05] truth but simeon says this child is set
[32:08] for the fall
[32:10] of many
[32:13] he didn't just come for blessings but he
[32:15] also come for the fall
[32:20] that's why the denominational
[32:21] understanding will never give you the
[32:22] full picture because they water the
[32:24] gospel down so much to where the only
[32:26] thing they ever talk about is what's
[32:28] pleasant to hear
[32:31] the the blessings of what god gave and
[32:34] and how we're saved but this child was
[32:37] set for the fallen rising again in many
[32:39] in israel
[32:40] that because christ came israel was
[32:42] going to fall
[32:44] and god was going to turn from them to
[32:46] another people
[32:48] because of this child
[32:50] this child is going to be the
[32:51] downfalling of israel
[32:55] because he's prophesied to be
[32:56] enlightened to the gentiles
[32:58] so this child amen when
[33:01] we sing the songs and you go into stores
[33:03] and hear all the songs but people don't
[33:05] realize when the word is made flesh amen
[33:08] in the word amen comes and makes and
[33:10] makes himself flesh and is manifest
[33:12] among us amen it accomplishes two things
[33:15] it brings judgment to some and liberty
[33:17] to others
[33:19] and simeon picks up this child and say
[33:21] this child is set for the fall and
[33:24] rising again of many in israel because
[33:26] israel has to fall so that he can be a
[33:28] light to lighten the gentiles but by his
[33:30] grace he'll raise israel again under the
[33:33] prophetic under the two witnesses under
[33:35] the prophetic ministry in revelations
[33:37] 11. so this child is set for the fall
[33:40] and rising again of many in israel
[33:43] that wasn't the part of the christmas
[33:44] story we wanted to talk about
[33:48] this child is set for the fallen rising
[33:49] again in many many in israel
[33:52] and for a sign which shall be spoken
[33:55] against
[33:57] he's also come he's set he's established
[34:00] he's placed here to be a sign that will
[34:03] be spoken against
[34:06] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[34:07] revealed
[34:10] now when he says that the thoughts of
[34:11] many hearts might be revealed he's not
[34:13] talking about the gift of discernment
[34:16] that jesus would discern their thoughts
[34:18] he's not talking about that what he's
[34:20] talking about is that this child this
[34:23] manifested word this promise for this
[34:25] day coming into manifestation is set
[34:28] here to be for the fall and rising again
[34:30] and many of israel is set here to be a
[34:33] sign that will be spoken against that
[34:35] the thoughts of many hearts will be
[34:36] revealed amen because when they speak
[34:38] against this sign it'll show that
[34:40] they're unbelievers and not part of
[34:41] christ
[34:43] this sign is set here to expose the
[34:46] thoughts of the hearts
[34:48] they were in a religious system and that
[34:50] religious system amen and had come to
[34:53] the pinnacle amen and it had it had
[34:55] man's ideas mixed in and separated into
[34:58] denominations but they had a great
[34:59] system a powerful system amen they were
[35:02] influential in politics they had
[35:04] jerusalem as their headquarters they had
[35:06] all of this amen and god was going to
[35:08] set amongst them a sign a virgin shall
[35:11] conceive this shall be a sign a virgin
[35:13] shall conceive
[35:16] and this sign
[35:18] shall be spoken against
[35:21] that the thoughts of many hearts will be
[35:23] revealed amen
[35:26] because when they begin to speak against
[35:27] the sign they showed that they were not
[35:30] part of the word
[35:31] that they did not believe moses and they
[35:33] didn't love god
[35:36] and that sign was set he was set for the
[35:39] fall
[35:42] i don't know anybody who preaches like
[35:44] this on christmas
[35:47] merry christmas he came for the fall
[35:50] of israel
[35:51] and for the rising again of many
[35:54] americans he came so israel will fall so
[35:57] the gentiles could rise
[35:59] and later so the gentiles could fall so
[36:01] he could turn to the jews again
[36:04] he came for the falling of some for the
[36:07] raising of others
[36:09] he came to be a sign that would be
[36:11] spoken against amen god knew he was
[36:14] prophesying the holy ghost speaking
[36:15] through simeon knew that they were not
[36:18] going to accept this sign they were not
[36:19] going to accept this gift and he came as
[36:22] such he came for such he came to do the
[36:24] dividing and the separating
[36:27] because when the word is made manifest
[36:28] it automatically begins to separate
[36:32] and for a sign which shall be spoken
[36:34] against
[36:35] that the thoughts of many hearts
[36:37] may be
[36:38] revealed so if you want to know why
[36:40] jesus came and was set up on the earth
[36:42] this is why simeon tells us
[36:47] amen isaiah 7 14 is the prophecy that we
[36:50] referenced it says therefore the lord
[36:52] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[36:54] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[36:57] shall call his name emmanuel
[37:00] emmanuel means god with us
[37:02] and so here's the sign the sign is that
[37:05] god is with us
[37:08] and this sign of god with us will be
[37:10] spoken against
[37:13] so that many of the hearts
[37:15] many hearts the thoughts of the hearts
[37:17] may be made may be revealed
[37:21] so
[37:22] i want to turn to isaiah chapter 8
[37:25] together
[37:28] i just want to build on this thought
[37:48] brother branham says in the message c
[37:49] does not heir with the shock he said
[37:51] soon lord we're all going to pass that
[37:53] way
[37:54] i too must go that way every man and
[37:56] woman boy or girl in here has to go that
[37:58] way
[37:59] and we will be accountable for what we
[38:01] do with the word of god
[38:04] amen that's what that what's what he
[38:06] he was saying through simeon when he
[38:08] said he shall be a sign that shall be
[38:09] spoken against what were they speaking
[38:11] against they were speaking against the
[38:13] word of god
[38:14] and it was manifesting revealing what
[38:16] was in the heart
[38:18] isaiah 8 13
[38:20] let's read this together
[38:23] sanctify the lord of hosts himself and
[38:25] let him be your fear and let him be your
[38:27] dread
[38:28] and he shall be for a sanctuary but for
[38:30] a but for a stone of stumbling
[38:33] and for a rock of offense to both the
[38:36] house of israel for a jinn and for a
[38:39] snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem
[38:42] and many among them shall stumble and
[38:45] fall and be broken and be snared and be
[38:48] taken
[38:52] how
[38:53] because the lord will come
[38:55] according to his word
[38:58] and the lord will be for a sanctuary for
[39:00] some for others
[39:02] he will be
[39:04] he will be a stone of stumbling
[39:08] and for a rock of offense
[39:11] because he will be a sign that's spoken
[39:12] against and when they speak against that
[39:15] sign that sign becomes a stumbling stone
[39:17] to them
[39:19] a stone of stumbling in a rock of
[39:20] offense to both the house of israel for
[39:23] a jinn a jinn as a trap for a gin for a
[39:26] snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem
[39:27] and many
[39:29] among them shall stumble and fall and be
[39:31] broken and be snared
[39:33] and be taken
[39:35] man let's go over to isaiah 28.
[39:43] isaiah 28
[39:46] and verse 16
[39:48] isaiah 28 16
[39:50] therefore thus saith the lord god behold
[39:52] i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a
[39:55] tried stone a precious cornerstone a
[39:57] sure foundation he that believeth shall
[40:00] not make haste
[40:02] we're talking about two stones
[40:05] no we're talking about one stone
[40:07] this is the same stone to one he's a
[40:10] stone of stumbling a rock of offense to
[40:13] the other he's a sure foundation
[40:16] to the one he's a sign that's spoken
[40:18] against amen to reveal their hearts to
[40:21] the other there's going to be some
[40:22] simple people upon the earth who are
[40:24] uneducated and not high ranking in the
[40:26] religion but they're going to recognize
[40:28] that this is christ the son of the
[40:30] living god and it's going to reveal that
[40:31] there's something in their heart that's
[40:33] not in the pharisee's heart
[40:36] amen so the the stone of stumbling
[40:40] is the foundation stone
[40:42] it's the same stone
[40:44] one will trip over the stone and fall
[40:47] the other will stand upon the stone and
[40:49] be unmovable
[40:51] to one it is their demise to the others
[40:53] they're building up amen to one it is
[40:56] the rejection to the other it's going to
[40:57] be their acceptance
[40:59] it depends on what's down inside of you
[41:02] and what you do with the word when you
[41:03] come in contact with it for some the
[41:06] word the word is a revelation a
[41:08] revelation is a stone in the bible for
[41:10] some the stone of the revelation of the
[41:12] word is always a stepping a tripping
[41:14] stone a stumbling stone and they're
[41:16] constantly falling over the word that's
[41:18] made manifest in this hour stumbling
[41:21] over christ
[41:23] but for others amen who have something
[41:25] inside of them that was placed in them
[41:27] before the foundation of the world
[41:29] they've got a faith that they didn't
[41:30] conjure up that's not intellectual or
[41:32] mental but there's a part of god a part
[41:34] of that word and when they come to the
[41:36] stumbling stone for them it's not a
[41:38] stumbling stone for them it's a sure
[41:40] foundation
[41:42] a rock a true stone a tried stone amen
[41:45] and it makes them not to stumble but it
[41:47] keeps them from stumbling
[41:50] it prevents them it's one for one it
[41:53] creates the fall for the other it
[41:54] prevents the fall
[41:57] it's not two stones one
[42:00] stone remember when israel was coming
[42:03] out of egypt amen and they they came
[42:05] down to the red sea and they got
[42:07] themselves in a in a bind in a corner
[42:09] they couldn't get out amen and the
[42:11] egyptian army was coming down to slay
[42:12] them the pillar of fire moved behind
[42:14] them and became a wall between them and
[42:17] to the egyptians to the egyptians it was
[42:20] darkness to them it was light
[42:22] amen it was not darkness and light two
[42:25] objects it was the same christ the same
[42:27] pillar of fire the same angel of the
[42:29] covenant to the chosen elected it was
[42:32] light to the non-elect it was blackness
[42:35] and darkness
[42:37] amen
[42:38] and god amen plays both parts amen he's
[42:41] to one darkness he's the one judgment
[42:44] he's the one condemnation but to the
[42:46] other he's salvation he's redemption
[42:49] he's their vindication
[42:53] just depends on which side you
[42:56] find yourself
[42:57] let's go to matthew 16.
[43:07] matthew chapter 16. we know this really
[43:09] well but i want to read
[43:10] it together
[43:19] i'd say it this way
[43:23] that first christmas which we know was
[43:25] in march or april not december
[43:28] because the season when lambs were born
[43:33] for some
[43:35] it was the greatest day in the greatest
[43:37] event of their lives
[43:40] for others it was the beginning of the
[43:42] end for them
[43:44] the same birth
[43:46] the same announcement from angels the
[43:48] same prophecy being fulfilled the same
[43:51] the same thing that came amen to be the
[43:54] greatest event that ever happened for
[43:56] one group of people became the worst
[43:58] thing that ever happened for another
[43:59] group of people
[44:02] amen we have to understand that this is
[44:05] the word
[44:06] that this is christ
[44:09] matthew 16
[44:11] 13.
[44:16] when jesus came into the coast of
[44:18] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[44:20] saying whom do men say that i the son of
[44:23] man am and they said
[44:25] they said say some say that thou art
[44:27] john the baptist some elias and others
[44:29] jeremiah are one of the prophets
[44:32] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[44:34] i am that's when we really get to the
[44:37] question
[44:38] not who do men say that i am there's all
[44:41] kinds of ideas and people say all kinds
[44:43] of things amen and jesus asked the
[44:45] question who do men say that i am he
[44:47] asked him the question he wanted to know
[44:49] their response and they could identify
[44:52] what other people said about him but he
[44:54] wanted to move past what other people
[44:56] said about them and wanted to know what
[44:58] they said about him
[45:01] because you know there's a lot of people
[45:02] around us who have things to say amen
[45:05] about the message of the hour about the
[45:06] coming of the prophet amen the ministry
[45:08] of william branham and the ministry of
[45:10] christ the son of man in this day they
[45:12] have all kinds of things to say about it
[45:14] amen there's people all over the world
[45:16] who have something to say amen and you
[45:19] can repeat what somebody else is saying
[45:21] somebody says that the message is this
[45:23] and somebody says brother branham was
[45:24] this and he fulfilled that amen but
[45:26] christ wants to come down to your seat
[45:28] and say who do you say this
[45:30] is amen not what mom and dad said not
[45:33] what the pastor said not what everybody
[45:35] else my church believes amen you might
[45:37] as well throw that dialogue right out
[45:39] the window because it doesn't matter to
[45:41] god what your church believes what
[45:43] matters to god is what you believe
[45:47] amen
[45:48] and what your church believes may be
[45:50] fine and it may not be fine amen god's
[45:52] the one who'll determine that but god he
[45:54] may ask what does your church believe
[45:56] well we believe brother brennan was this
[45:58] and we believe that christ has come and
[46:00] we believe this and this and this is the
[46:01] hour of this manifestation beautiful now
[46:04] what do you say amen can you from your
[46:07] heart say the same thing that they're
[46:09] saying are you just repeating again what
[46:11] you've heard
[46:14] because you can see when they begin to
[46:15] talk about what everybody else said
[46:17] about christ there was mass confusion
[46:20] some say john the baptist some say elias
[46:22] some say jeremiah some say one of the
[46:24] other prophets if you're going to take
[46:26] what everybody else around is saying
[46:28] you're going to get caught up in mass
[46:29] confusion because was it jeremiah's is
[46:31] it john the baptist amen is it is it one
[46:34] of the other prophets who is it amen
[46:36] we've heard all of these voices
[46:38] we heard he's come we heard he's coming
[46:40] we heard the millennium's already on we
[46:42] heard that there's no physical rapture
[46:44] it's only a spiritual we've heard all
[46:46] kinds of things
[46:51] who do you say this is
[46:54] who do men say well there's some
[46:56] churches believe this and there's some
[46:57] ministries believe that and some people
[46:59] say this
[47:01] we're going to keep going down that line
[47:03] we're going to be utterly confused amen
[47:05] but he wanted to go deeper than that
[47:07] below the ability to hear what somebody
[47:09] says he wants to get down to the root
[47:12] amen because this christ came he was set
[47:15] and established upon this earth this
[47:17] baby to reveal the hearts of many
[47:21] and what's he doing now with peter he's
[47:23] about to reveal what's down inside of
[47:25] peter amen
[47:29] because that's why he came
[47:32] to reveal the thoughts of meaning
[47:34] that he would be assigned spoken against
[47:36] to reveal the thoughts of many
[47:40] peter and the disciples they'd heard so
[47:42] many things
[47:44] but jesus said but whom say ye that i am
[47:47] and simon peter answered and said hour
[47:49] to christ
[47:51] the son of the living god
[47:53] and jesus answered and said unto him
[47:55] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[47:57] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[47:59] unto thee but my father which is in
[48:01] heaven you can never get this by natural
[48:05] ears you can never get this by hearing
[48:07] and repeating you did not get this by
[48:10] flesh you got this from my father which
[48:12] is in heaven
[48:15] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[48:17] and upon this rock i will build my
[48:18] church and the gates of hell shall not
[48:22] prevail against it
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] brother branham says in christ is the
[48:28] mystery of god revealed he says now
[48:30] now say my church my church has nothing
[48:32] to do with it it's an individual one
[48:34] person all hell is against this teaching
[48:37] all hell is against this truth but it is
[48:39] the truth
[48:40] jesus never said now peter you and john
[48:42] and all the rest of the people you've
[48:43] got the revelation now the whole church
[48:45] is safe no it was to him personally i
[48:48] say to thee not to them to thee thou art
[48:50] peter upon this rock i'll build my
[48:52] church and the word peter means a stone
[48:54] a stone means to confess one or a
[48:56] separated one upon a certain stone upon
[48:59] a certain thing sia called out the
[49:01] church called out upon this stone upon
[49:04] this revelation
[49:07] flesh and blood never revealed it to you
[49:09] but upon the revelation called out group
[49:11] i'll build my church in them and all the
[49:14] gates of hell shall never be able to
[49:16] withstand it
[49:19] what was he
[49:20] he was the rock of offense
[49:23] what was who was the one speaking to the
[49:25] disciples the stumbling stone
[49:29] the stumbling stone the rock of offense
[49:32] he was the one speaking to the
[49:33] multitudes he was the one now speaking
[49:36] to his disciples and when he spoke to
[49:38] his disciples he was the rock of offense
[49:42] but he was also the sure foundation
[49:45] a tried stone a sure stone an unmovable
[49:48] stone
[49:49] and so now he's testing peter to see
[49:52] whether to peter he'll be a rock of
[49:54] offense or to peter he'll be a sure
[49:56] foundation
[49:58] because it depends on the revelation
[50:00] peter has as who he is
[50:02] and that revelation didn't come from
[50:04] peter that revelation came from the
[50:06] father
[50:07] because that revelation was in the
[50:09] father and now that revelation that was
[50:11] in the father a part of the father is
[50:13] now in peter
[50:17] and so that revelation can only be of
[50:19] the father
[50:21] and so he's looking to find out amen to
[50:24] peter
[50:25] am i a stone of stumbling or am i a sure
[50:27] foundation
[50:30] and peter said
[50:31] he said we believe
[50:34] that thou art christ the son of the
[50:36] living god
[50:38] he said flesh and blood never revealed
[50:40] this to you but my father which is in
[50:41] heaven
[50:42] thou art peter and upon this rock i'll
[50:46] build my church what rock the rock of
[50:49] revelation of who the word is
[50:52] the sure foundation right then he was
[50:55] becoming to them the sure foundation the
[50:58] tried stone the immovable rock amen and
[51:01] he says and i'll plant my church upon
[51:04] this rock
[51:07] and the gates of hell
[51:09] shall never prevail against
[51:13] amen the gates of hell shall never
[51:16] prevail against it that means the gates
[51:18] of hell will come against it but the
[51:20] gates of hell shall never prevail
[51:22] against it
[51:23] it did not say the gates of hell shall
[51:25] never come near it he said the gates of
[51:27] hell shall never prevail
[51:29] against it so the gates of hell will
[51:32] come against it that's why you cannot
[51:34] have your house built upon the sand but
[51:36] your house must be built upon the rock
[51:38] that rock of the revelation of who jesus
[51:41] christ is he is the word made manifest
[51:43] in our day
[51:45] and upon that rock
[51:49] the gates of hell shall never prevail
[51:54] so to one he's a stumbling stone
[51:59] to the other
[52:00] he's the sure foundation
[52:03] and when the church is founded upon this
[52:06] sure foundation
[52:08] the gates of hell cannot prevail
[52:11] for those who are not
[52:14] those who are not founded upon this
[52:17] revelation
[52:19] the same revelation
[52:21] that makes
[52:22] you firm
[52:24] on a foundation that cannot be shaken
[52:27] that same foundation without revelation
[52:30] becomes a stumbling stone
[52:32] and you fall
[52:40] let's turn to ephesians chapter two
[52:48] ephesians chapter 2.
[52:56] in verse 19. i want to read several
[52:58] scriptures back to back here ephesians
[53:00] chapter 2 verse 19.
[53:04] now therefore you are no more strangers
[53:06] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[53:08] the saints and of the household of god
[53:10] and are built upon the foundation of the
[53:12] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[53:13] himself being the chief cornerstone
[53:16] and whom all the buildings fitly framed
[53:18] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[53:20] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[53:22] together for a habitation of god
[53:25] through the
[53:26] spirit so jesus christ in this
[53:29] foundation he is the chief cornerstone
[53:32] he is the first and the last he's the
[53:34] alpha omega he's the beginning of this
[53:36] structure the sure foundation
[53:39] and the cornerstone the cornerstone is
[53:41] what sets the rest of the building amen
[53:43] when you set the cornerstone its angles
[53:46] and dimensions will set the rest of the
[53:47] building so everything must be built off
[53:50] of jesus christ
[53:52] the sure foundation the tried stone he
[53:56] was the perfect representation of god on
[53:58] the earth he was the perfect god man he
[54:01] became the cornerstone he became the
[54:03] measurement he became the he became the
[54:06] beginning the setting stone that sets in
[54:09] place that everyone else must measure
[54:11] off of this stone
[54:13] and when we build up this tabernacle
[54:15] this habitation for god what's he
[54:17] building he's building a bride but that
[54:18] bride must begin with the perfect image
[54:21] of god
[54:22] the perfect man the perfect god man sets
[54:25] the dimensions for that building that
[54:27] building is built off the example of
[54:29] christ
[54:31] and he is the sure foundation he is the
[54:34] tried stone he is the
[54:36] cornerstone and off that foundation
[54:39] there's a building that's being built
[54:42] let's go to first corinthians chapter 3.
[54:50] first corinthians chapter 3
[54:53] and verse 10.
[54:59] according
[55:01] according to the grace of god which is
[55:03] given unto me as a wise master builder i
[55:06] have laid the foundation and another
[55:08] buildeth thereon but let every man take
[55:10] heed how he buildeth thereupon for other
[55:12] foundation can no man lay then that is
[55:15] laid which is jesus christ now if any
[55:17] man build upon this foundation gold
[55:19] silver precious stones hay or stubble
[55:21] every man's work shall be made manifest
[55:24] so now paul's saying i as a master
[55:27] builder have laid the foundation so paul
[55:30] the apostle amen he set the foundation
[55:33] with christ as the chief cornerstone
[55:36] amen the chief cornerstone and paul the
[55:39] apostle laid out the foundation of this
[55:41] building that's why when we find the
[55:44] building in ruin when we find amen the
[55:46] the the uh the the bride tree in ruin
[55:50] amen at the end time there's going to be
[55:52] a prophet who has to go back to the
[55:53] foundation because paul the wise master
[55:56] builder laid the sure foundation and he
[55:59] laid it true and he laid it straight
[56:00] what this church is supposed to be but
[56:03] paul
[56:04] never claimed that he finished this
[56:05] building paul laid the foundation he
[56:07] said another man builds upon
[56:11] so when brother benham comes to bring us
[56:13] back to the sure foundation that the
[56:16] apostle paul had laid to establish the
[56:18] church to set forth the bride amen he's
[56:21] got to bring us back and lay the stones
[56:24] back in place and bring it back to the
[56:27] foundation that the wise master builder
[56:29] laid that's why he says i preached what
[56:31] paul preached
[56:32] he had to come back and lay it back
[56:35] right again and build the church ages
[56:37] back upon that correctly leaving out
[56:39] what was added on
[56:42] but see paul never finished that
[56:43] building paul laid paul knew that if i
[56:47] lay the foundation correctly and i get
[56:49] the cornerstone in place amen the
[56:51] cornerstone guarantees that the building
[56:54] will be finished correctly because
[56:56] everything must be built to the
[56:57] dimensions of christ the god-man
[57:00] god and flesh
[57:02] so when remember brother bennum comes
[57:04] back and begins to rebuild amen and
[57:07] becomes comes back and takes us back to
[57:09] the foundation and lays the stones in
[57:11] place according to the proper foundation
[57:13] restoring the church back to the
[57:15] original word the original faith of the
[57:17] fathers amen from there he can go on to
[57:20] complete the building because the
[57:22] building was meant to be completed but
[57:24] paul didn't complete it that's why you
[57:26] can't just go back there and stay back
[57:28] there you've got to go back to the
[57:30] foundation lay everything straight again
[57:32] man you got to move to the capstone
[57:35] friends you can't stay with the building
[57:37] incomplete the goal was to have a
[57:39] complete building but the cornerstone
[57:41] told you what the complete building was
[57:42] going to look like
[57:44] the complete building was going to look
[57:46] like the cornerstone
[57:50] every stone was going to match
[57:53] every stone was going to fit into its
[57:54] place and it was going to make when it
[57:57] was finished the whole building would
[57:58] reflect the cornerstone the cornerstone
[58:00] was foreshowing the building
[58:03] amen
[58:05] let's go to romans chapter 9.
[58:19] romans chapter 9 verse 32.
[58:26] wherefore because they sought it not by
[58:28] faith but as it were by the works of the
[58:30] law for they stumbled at that stumbling
[58:33] stone
[58:34] as it is written behold i lay in zion a
[58:36] stumbling stone
[58:37] and rock of offense and whosoever
[58:39] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[58:43] so he's laying out a stumbling stone
[58:46] but if you believe on that stumbling
[58:47] stone you'll never be ashamed
[58:50] you'll never be moved you'll never be
[58:52] ashamed let's go to first peter chapter
[58:54] 2.
[58:59] first
[59:00] peter chapter 2 verse 4.
[59:08] to whom coming is unto a living stone
[59:11] [Music]
[59:12] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[59:15] god and precious
[59:17] ye also as lively stones or built up a
[59:19] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[59:21] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[59:24] to god by jesus christ wherefore also it
[59:27] is contained in the scriptures behold i
[59:29] lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect
[59:31] precious and he that believeth on him
[59:33] shall not be confounded
[59:35] unto you therefore which believeth he is
[59:37] precious but unto them which be
[59:39] disobedient the stone which the builders
[59:41] disallowed the same is made the head of
[59:43] the corner and a stone of stumbling and
[59:46] a rock of a fence even to them which
[59:48] stumble at the word
[59:51] being disobedient
[59:53] where unto also
[59:55] they were appointed
[59:58] they were appointed to stumble at the
[1:00:00] stumbling stone
[1:00:01] that's why simeon could say what simeon
[1:00:03] said
[1:00:04] because he is set for the fall and
[1:00:07] rising again of many in israel and for a
[1:00:09] sign that shall be spoken against that
[1:00:11] many of the thoughts of the hearts shall
[1:00:13] be revealed
[1:00:15] and so
[1:00:16] it's saying here to us
[1:00:19] and therefore to do which believe he is
[1:00:21] precious
[1:00:22] he is the foundation stone he is the
[1:00:25] precious stone he is the tridestone but
[1:00:27] other than which be disobedient the
[1:00:29] stone which the builders disallowed the
[1:00:31] same as made the head of the corner and
[1:00:32] a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[1:00:34] offense
[1:00:35] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:00:39] being
[1:00:40] disobedient when they were stumbling at
[1:00:43] christ they were stumbling at the word
[1:00:47] when they were stumbling at the
[1:00:48] manifestation in that day the man christ
[1:00:51] jesus when he was on earth they were
[1:00:52] stumbling over one coming from nazareth
[1:00:54] they were stumbling over you being a man
[1:00:57] make yourself god they were stumbling
[1:00:59] what were they stumbling over they were
[1:01:00] stumbling over the word
[1:01:02] and they were supposed to be the
[1:01:03] guardians of the word the oracles of god
[1:01:06] amen the great church that was guarding
[1:01:08] the truths of god amen and here come the
[1:01:11] truth and the manifestation and that
[1:01:13] truth for them that they thought they
[1:01:14] were guarding they began to trip over
[1:01:16] and fall
[1:01:19] but to harlots and prostitutes and tax
[1:01:21] collectors and fishermen he became a
[1:01:23] sure foundation a tried stone he became
[1:01:26] the setting stone that set them
[1:01:28] immovable unshakable amen
[1:01:31] set them undefeatable
[1:01:34] against the enemy
[1:01:38] because they were stumbling at the word
[1:01:42] he says uh in hebrews chapter four
[1:01:47] let's turn there together hebrews
[1:01:48] chapter four
[1:01:51] i'm going to start reading from verse
[1:01:52] 12.
[1:01:58] for the word of god
[1:02:00] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:02:02] any two-edged sword
[1:02:04] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:02:07] a soul and spirit and the joints in the
[1:02:09] morrow and is a discerner of the
[1:02:11] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:02:14] what is the discerner the word
[1:02:17] so when the word comes in the
[1:02:18] manifestation just like in that day when
[1:02:21] simeon said he shall be a sign that sign
[1:02:24] was the word made flesh
[1:02:26] shall be a sign that shall be spoken
[1:02:28] against at the hearts of many the
[1:02:29] thoughts of many hearts shall be made
[1:02:31] manifest amen what was making them
[1:02:33] manifest the word the word was the one
[1:02:35] that was sharper quicker than the
[1:02:37] two-edged sword it was the word that was
[1:02:39] dividing it was the word that was
[1:02:40] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:02:42] the heart because jesus christ was
[1:02:43] standing there the word and when they
[1:02:45] stumbled over the word it was discerning
[1:02:48] their hearts
[1:02:50] see you don't
[1:02:53] you don't necessarily have to have amen
[1:02:55] the gift of discernment in this day all
[1:02:57] you have to have is the true word and
[1:02:58] the word will do the discerning
[1:03:01] you preach the true word and its full
[1:03:03] power and the true word and its full
[1:03:04] power will begin to discern because as
[1:03:07] you preach the full word in this day it
[1:03:09] becomes a stumbling stone to some and a
[1:03:11] rock a foundation a sure stone a tried
[1:03:14] stone of precious stone to some that
[1:03:16] they can climb upon and be secure
[1:03:19] but for others it takes all the security
[1:03:21] away and they stumble and they fall
[1:03:26] and you don't necessarily need to have
[1:03:28] the gift of discernment to have
[1:03:30] spiritual discernment all you have to
[1:03:32] have is the true manifested word for
[1:03:34] your day
[1:03:35] and the true manifested word for your
[1:03:37] day will do the dividing amen will
[1:03:39] expose the thoughts and the intents of
[1:03:41] the heart
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:47] let's go to john chapter 8.
[1:04:00] i love when the word says things in a
[1:04:02] way you didn't expect
[1:04:06] and it begins to shift your paradigm and
[1:04:08] change your thinking
[1:04:11] because when we were in the
[1:04:12] denominational churches you thought that
[1:04:15] that god when he sent down jesus and
[1:04:19] and he was looking down and saying i
[1:04:21] love this whole world so much
[1:04:26] that i'm going to put this baby here
[1:04:28] it's going to be such a wonderful thing
[1:04:31] but we know simeon has caught the mind
[1:04:33] of god
[1:04:35] and simeon is not using that kind of
[1:04:37] language he's not using that kind of
[1:04:38] dialogue amen simeon saying amen this
[1:04:42] child amen this this child shall be for
[1:04:45] the fall and rising again of many in
[1:04:47] israel
[1:04:48] that god through this manifested word is
[1:04:50] going to accomplish what he's had in the
[1:04:52] back part of his mind he's going to use
[1:04:54] this to separate he's going to use this
[1:04:56] to call his sheep and to himself he's
[1:04:57] going to use this to bring judgment to
[1:05:00] the world but he's going to bring life
[1:05:02] amen unto those that are his
[1:05:05] he's going to be a sign god when simeon
[1:05:08] catches the mind of god he knows now
[1:05:10] what god is thinking when god amen is
[1:05:12] sending this sign unto the earth a
[1:05:14] virgin shall conceive and bring forth
[1:05:16] the sign and she shall be emmanuel he
[1:05:18] shall be emanuel and you know the
[1:05:20] thoughts of god is thinking this is a
[1:05:21] sign that shall be spoken against that
[1:05:23] many of the hearts shall be exposed
[1:05:27] see this is why
[1:05:29] this
[1:05:30] things like this and all these things in
[1:05:32] the scriptures is why the
[1:05:34] nominal denominational teaching will
[1:05:36] never bring you to the realization of
[1:05:38] who god really is
[1:05:41] because it takes a man's perspective
[1:05:44] looking up to god and only displaying
[1:05:46] what what the man wants to
[1:05:48] display but with a revelation of the
[1:05:51] word takes us into the back part of
[1:05:53] god's mind and begins to show us god's
[1:05:55] plan from before the foundation of the
[1:05:57] world all the way to new heavens and due
[1:05:59] to earth and it begins to display the
[1:06:00] very character of god
[1:06:05] god
[1:06:06] is not judging man man is judging
[1:06:08] himself
[1:06:12] because jesus didn't come to the world
[1:06:13] to condemn the world
[1:06:16] but that the world through him might be
[1:06:17] saved
[1:06:20] but those who believe not are condemned
[1:06:22] already
[1:06:24] he didn't have to send him to the world
[1:06:25] to condemn the world the world's already
[1:06:27] condemned
[1:06:28] he didn't send him for condemnation he
[1:06:30] sent him for salvation but refusing
[1:06:32] salvation keeps you in condemnation
[1:06:35] so god didn't send christ down thinking
[1:06:37] now i'm going to get him he says i have
[1:06:39] a way out amen for whoever will take the
[1:06:41] way out mine will take the way out and
[1:06:44] those that are not mine will stumble
[1:06:45] over this sign
[1:06:50] because you're already in condemnation
[1:06:54] but jesus provided a way out of
[1:06:56] condemnation not a way to be condemned
[1:07:00] but when they sent the sign that would
[1:07:02] free from condemnation they begin to
[1:07:04] stumble and fall over the sign
[1:07:07] instead of climbing up on it and saying
[1:07:09] i am saved so wonderfully wonderfully
[1:07:12] miraculously saved i'm saved from all
[1:07:14] sense past present and future climb upon
[1:07:16] the stone and realize that he didn't
[1:07:18] send him for condemnation but that the
[1:07:20] world through him might be saved
[1:07:22] but you've got to stand upon that stone
[1:07:24] and not stumble over it
[1:07:27] john chapter 8 verse 42
[1:07:34] john chapter 8 verse 42 jesus said unto
[1:07:37] them if god were your father you would
[1:07:38] love me
[1:07:40] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[1:07:42] neither came i of myself
[1:07:44] but but he sent me
[1:07:46] why do you not understand my speech even
[1:07:48] because you cannot hear my word
[1:07:50] year of your father the devil and the
[1:07:52] lust of your father you will do he was a
[1:07:54] murderer from the beginning and abode
[1:07:56] not in the truth because there is no
[1:07:58] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:08:00] speaketh of his own free as a liar and
[1:08:02] the father of it
[1:08:04] and because i tell you the truth you
[1:08:06] believe me not
[1:08:08] so why didn't they believe him because
[1:08:09] he said the truth
[1:08:11] if he had lied they would believe him
[1:08:13] because they're of their father the liar
[1:08:16] so jesus is saying
[1:08:18] you're of your father the devil he was a
[1:08:20] liar from the beginning
[1:08:22] so if i had come and lied to you you
[1:08:24] would believe me
[1:08:26] but why don't you believe me because i
[1:08:28] told you the truth
[1:08:32] praise god almighty
[1:08:34] that's why you can tell tons of people
[1:08:36] the truth and they won't believe you but
[1:08:37] you tell them a lie they'll believe you
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:42] you can preach the truth of this gospel
[1:08:44] and people will turn it down and stumble
[1:08:46] over it but if you make it some lie some
[1:08:48] amen jesus loves you just the way you
[1:08:50] are you don't have to change or do
[1:08:51] anything just repeat these line after me
[1:08:53] and come to church and pay your tithe
[1:08:55] and jesus will surely accept you you
[1:08:56] tell them that lie they'll believe it by
[1:08:58] the billions
[1:09:00] but you tell them the truth they won't
[1:09:02] believe the truth they'll stumble over
[1:09:03] the truth
[1:09:08] man it says
[1:09:12] all right because of verse 45 and
[1:09:14] because i tell you the truth you believe
[1:09:16] me not which of you convinces me of sin
[1:09:18] and if i say the truth why do you not
[1:09:20] believe me
[1:09:21] he that is of god heareth god's words ye
[1:09:24] therefore hear them not because you are
[1:09:27] not of
[1:09:28] god
[1:09:32] then answered the jews and said unto him
[1:09:34] say we not well that thou art a
[1:09:37] samaritan
[1:09:38] and ask the devil
[1:09:42] why because he told them the truth
[1:09:44] he told them exactly 100 the truth and
[1:09:47] they said didn't we say well you're a
[1:09:48] samaritan they didn't believe the virgin
[1:09:50] birth from the beginning
[1:09:53] they're pointing right to his birth and
[1:09:55] they're denying the sign they're
[1:09:57] speaking against the sign
[1:10:01] that a virgin shall conceive and now
[1:10:03] they're accusing him of being a
[1:10:05] samaritan pointing right to his birth
[1:10:08] now they're speaking against the sign
[1:10:12] which is what simeon said they would do
[1:10:15] and hast a devil
[1:10:18] jesus answered i have not a devil
[1:10:20] but i honor my father and you do
[1:10:22] dishonor
[1:10:24] me
[1:10:26] praise god
[1:10:29] i love it
[1:10:30] jesus knows where he's standing
[1:10:33] he knows what the truth is and he's
[1:10:34] offering the truth but he knows that
[1:10:36] that truth will be a stumbling stone
[1:10:38] to some
[1:10:39] and a sure foundation
[1:10:41] to others
[1:10:46] let's go to matthew 21.
[1:11:05] matthew 21
[1:11:07] and verse 42
[1:11:11] jesus saith unto them did you never read
[1:11:13] in the scriptures the stone which the
[1:11:14] builders rejected
[1:11:16] the same has become the head of the
[1:11:18] corner
[1:11:19] this is the lord's doing and it is
[1:11:21] marvelous in our eyes
[1:11:23] therefore say i unto you the kingdom of
[1:11:25] god shall be taken from you and given to
[1:11:26] a nation
[1:11:28] bringing forth the fruits thereof
[1:11:30] and whosoever shall fall on this stone
[1:11:32] shall be broken but on whomsoever it
[1:11:34] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[1:11:39] jesus now bringing another another
[1:11:41] picture of this stone the stone that's a
[1:11:43] stumbling stone is also the foundation
[1:11:45] stone but that foundation stone is also
[1:11:48] the capstone the head of the corner
[1:11:50] and whoever falls upon this stone will
[1:11:52] be broken but whoever this stone falls
[1:11:54] upon will be ground in the powder and
[1:11:56] he's pointing right back to daniel
[1:11:58] chapter 2 to the stone that is cut out
[1:12:00] of the mountain without hands and that
[1:12:01] stone that is cut out of a mountain
[1:12:02] without hands amen is is a depiction of
[1:12:05] christ and in the end times he smites
[1:12:07] the image amen the image that
[1:12:09] nebuchadnezzar saw of the fur
[1:12:11] for gentile world powers he smites it in
[1:12:14] the feet and when he smites in in the
[1:12:16] feet it is broken up and it blows away
[1:12:18] as the chaff from the winter threshing
[1:12:20] floor
[1:12:22] so jesus is now showing that this
[1:12:25] cornerstone this stumbling stone is a
[1:12:27] foundation stone as a cornerstone has
[1:12:29] become the head of the corner and
[1:12:31] whoever can fall upon this amen they'll
[1:12:33] be broken amen that's a good thing
[1:12:37] you want to fall upon this stone this
[1:12:39] word and be broken so that he can put
[1:12:41] you back together amen but if you refuse
[1:12:43] to fall upon the stone to be broken the
[1:12:45] stone if the stone falls on you it
[1:12:48] destroys you but if you fall on the
[1:12:50] stone it'll make you amen
[1:12:53] glory
[1:12:54] you'll be undone so that you can be put
[1:12:56] back together
[1:12:59] and the message the identification of
[1:13:00] christ in all ages the prophet of god
[1:13:02] says you've told the truth you've had
[1:13:04] five and the one you're living with now
[1:13:05] is not yours he's out of john 4 the
[1:13:08] samaritan woman at the well
[1:13:10] look at that little woman see she had
[1:13:11] fallen from god's thoughts
[1:13:14] where did that little woman come from
[1:13:17] did she come from
[1:13:18] parents in samaria i mean she was called
[1:13:20] a samaritan but that's only this
[1:13:22] dimensional amen that's only a title
[1:13:25] that works for this dimension where did
[1:13:27] she come from she didn't come from
[1:13:28] samaria she didn't come from a mother
[1:13:30] and father who were samaritan she didn't
[1:13:32] come from sakkar or whatever city she
[1:13:34] was in she had fallen from the thoughts
[1:13:36] of god
[1:13:39] there was something down inside of her
[1:13:41] amen that was in god was in the thoughts
[1:13:43] of god and then fallen she had fallen
[1:13:46] from the thoughts of god and landed amen
[1:13:49] as a little baby given to two little
[1:13:51] parents in samaria and she had the label
[1:13:53] of being a sumerian but she wasn't a
[1:13:55] sumerian she was a daughter of god
[1:13:58] that's why we're not americans
[1:14:02] we're not americans we're not germans
[1:14:04] we're not africans we're not whatever
[1:14:05] nationality that you might be that's not
[1:14:08] who you are amen if you're a child of
[1:14:10] god you've fallen here from the thoughts
[1:14:12] of god
[1:14:14] amen and god is bringing his word to try
[1:14:16] to collect back all of his thoughts amen
[1:14:18] and with what for millions of people has
[1:14:20] been a stumbling stone called the
[1:14:22] message of the hour a prophetic gift
[1:14:24] that's been on the earth through a man
[1:14:25] named william branham who brought us
[1:14:27] back in contact with a living jesus
[1:14:29] christ for many it's a stumbling stone
[1:14:31] for you it's a sure foundation it's a
[1:14:34] precious stone and then it's a rock that
[1:14:36] you can base your whole life upon
[1:14:39] its foundation goes clear back to the
[1:14:41] mind of god where you tumbled from is
[1:14:43] where this rock came from
[1:14:45] and where this rock is rooted too amen
[1:14:48] for some they've stumbled over the
[1:14:50] message and stumbled over the prophet
[1:14:51] and stumbled over the signs
[1:14:55] but for those who have fallen from the
[1:14:57] thoughts of god amen he sent that very
[1:15:00] word to expose the thoughts of many's
[1:15:02] hearts
[1:15:04] oh sometimes it's not a bad thing to
[1:15:06] have the thought of your heart exposed
[1:15:08] sometimes it's even exposing it to you
[1:15:11] god is bringing this word to peel away
[1:15:13] layers that don't belong to you layers
[1:15:15] of hybridization layers of
[1:15:17] denominational thinking he's bringing
[1:15:19] the word what's he trying to do he's
[1:15:21] trying to expose what's in your heart so
[1:15:23] you can see what's in you
[1:15:27] we've lived so long in the intellectual
[1:15:30] realm being taught and being trained and
[1:15:32] coming through life and having
[1:15:34] circumstances and experiences and bible
[1:15:36] training but he sent a powerful word in
[1:15:38] this day to penetrate past the mind to
[1:15:41] get down into the heart amen so that he
[1:15:43] can see there's something there that
[1:15:45] fell from the thoughts of god
[1:15:48] [Music]
[1:15:50] and that seed will not stumble over that
[1:15:52] word
[1:15:55] but it becomes
[1:15:57] a sure foundation
[1:16:01] see if
[1:16:03] if this is you
[1:16:05] man you're just like peter was
[1:16:08] peter
[1:16:09] he didn't know who he was he was a
[1:16:11] fisherman
[1:16:12] peter was a fisherman
[1:16:14] the son of jonas
[1:16:16] that's all he was a jew of the tribe of
[1:16:19] whatever tribe he was a fisherman by the
[1:16:22] sea of galilee that was his whole
[1:16:23] identification all of his life until the
[1:16:26] sign that was spoken against came his
[1:16:28] way
[1:16:30] until the stumbling stone came across
[1:16:32] his path amen to see whether he would
[1:16:34] stumble or whether he would stand
[1:16:37] and when the stumbling stone came across
[1:16:39] his path he stood upon it he didn't
[1:16:41] stumble
[1:16:43] and he got a new identification because
[1:16:45] he thought that he was one thing when he
[1:16:47] realized then he was something else and
[1:16:49] on the day of pentecost the power came
[1:16:51] into him to quicken the seed to make him
[1:16:54] all that god intended for him to be and
[1:16:56] from then on he goes off preaching the
[1:16:58] word and now peter the fisherman from
[1:17:01] galilee is the spokesman on the day of
[1:17:04] pentecost he's the main preacher that's
[1:17:06] preaching in the new testament church
[1:17:07] when it first is formed now he's boldly
[1:17:10] proclaiming the truth the man who was
[1:17:12] running afraid afraid of a damsel on the
[1:17:14] night of the crucifixion or the night of
[1:17:16] the arrest
[1:17:19] but something he's now on a sure
[1:17:22] foundation amen he's now standing upon a
[1:17:26] rock amen he's been lifted up above the
[1:17:28] heads of his enemies now he's in psalms
[1:17:31] 27.
[1:17:34] he's been lifted up upon a rock
[1:17:37] all his enemies are around him is peter
[1:17:39] surrounded by enemies he's right in the
[1:17:41] middle of everybody who hates christ and
[1:17:44] hates the christian life
[1:17:46] he actually wasn't even christian in
[1:17:47] that day he didn't even have that term
[1:17:49] amen they were just the ones who were
[1:17:51] following jesus
[1:17:53] and they thought when they they thought
[1:17:55] when they crucified the stumbling stone
[1:17:57] they got it out of their way they didn't
[1:17:59] realize that that stelling stone came
[1:18:00] right back into a people and he was
[1:18:03] still a stumbling stone upon the earth
[1:18:05] living in peep a body on the earth and
[1:18:07] they were still stumbling over the
[1:18:09] stumbling stone
[1:18:11] they thought they could kick it away
[1:18:12] they thought they could put in the
[1:18:13] catapult and cast it away through
[1:18:15] crucifixion they didn't realize that
[1:18:17] thing boomeranged right around back and
[1:18:19] came right into a group of people
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:23] and now the stumbling stone was still on
[1:18:25] earth and they were still stumbling over
[1:18:27] the stumbling stone
[1:18:31] and peter
[1:18:33] now
[1:18:34] peter who was afraid peter who's an
[1:18:36] illiterate fisherman all these
[1:18:37] identifications he has he and the day of
[1:18:39] pentecost he gets a new identity
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:44] and now
[1:18:45] he's on a sure foundation
[1:18:48] and the pharisees are stumbling
[1:18:52] the tide has turned
[1:18:55] peter knows who he is
[1:18:57] he knows who the lord is he's got a
[1:18:59] revelation of who christ is he's got a
[1:19:01] revelation and a new birth experience
[1:19:03] telling him who he is and now he's
[1:19:05] unmovable now they they arrest him
[1:19:08] because he and john amen they pray over
[1:19:10] the lame man by the gate called
[1:19:12] beautiful and he goes leaping and
[1:19:14] jumping and praising god and they begin
[1:19:16] to preach they come to arrest them and
[1:19:17] they take him to jail and they begin to
[1:19:19] threaten them now they take the
[1:19:21] illiterate fisherman
[1:19:24] who doesn't know anything this poor guy
[1:19:26] amen who ran scared amen they now take
[1:19:29] him and bring him before the council to
[1:19:31] intimidate him
[1:19:34] and they found out that this man was
[1:19:36] standing upon a rock and that rock was
[1:19:39] going to become their stumbling stone
[1:19:41] they're facing the stumbling stone again
[1:19:44] in another package
[1:19:47] and they looked at him and they said
[1:19:49] we we command you
[1:19:52] not to teach or preach or pray or do
[1:19:55] anything in this name
[1:19:57] and peter standing on a rock listen
[1:19:59] there's the one stumbling now he's the
[1:20:02] one who's solid
[1:20:05] he says will you tell me
[1:20:08] is it better to serve god or serve man
[1:20:11] a or b
[1:20:15] when they realized they couldn't do
[1:20:17] anything with them they said they
[1:20:18] further threatened him
[1:20:21] and sent him away and what did he do
[1:20:23] after the further threat he ran right
[1:20:25] back to the house where they were
[1:20:26] praying for him and they began to
[1:20:28] rejoice and praise god that they were
[1:20:30] found worthy to suffer for his name's
[1:20:32] sake they weren't afraid of the
[1:20:33] suffering they weren't afraid of the
[1:20:34] persecution they weren't afraid of the
[1:20:37] trouble they weren't afraid of the
[1:20:38] rejection they weren't afraid because
[1:20:40] they were on a sure foundation
[1:20:43] something had changed
[1:20:46] and now the rest of jerusalem is
[1:20:48] stumbling over them
[1:20:51] because the word is in them
[1:20:54] back to this quote about the little
[1:20:55] woman in samaria
[1:20:58] she had fallen from god's thoughts
[1:21:01] that does something for me friends
[1:21:05] because where you came from is where
[1:21:06] you're going back to
[1:21:11] if brother brennaman came from ellen
[1:21:12] charles branham
[1:21:14] he could have been a nervous boy as he
[1:21:16] got to the end of his life
[1:21:18] he said great was the day when i
[1:21:19] realized i'm not the son of charles and
[1:21:21] alabama
[1:21:22] but i'm a son of god
[1:21:25] amen once you realize you're a son of
[1:21:27] god you've climbed upon a sure
[1:21:28] foundation not even death can separate
[1:21:31] you from his love not even death is a
[1:21:33] bad thing anymore it's just a release
[1:21:34] into the dimension you long to be in
[1:21:38] you're on a sure foundation she had
[1:21:40] fallen from god's thoughts she could be
[1:21:42] she could be redeemed why should could
[1:21:44] she be redeemed because she fell from
[1:21:46] his thoughts
[1:21:48] she could be redeemed she was a subject
[1:21:51] she had
[1:21:52] representation in heaven
[1:21:56] she had a theophany
[1:21:59] she had representation in heaven an
[1:22:01] angel that always beheld the father's
[1:22:03] face
[1:22:06] she didn't know it
[1:22:08] she was the woman who had too many
[1:22:10] husbands
[1:22:12] she was the woman who was rejected in
[1:22:13] her society she was the woman who had to
[1:22:15] go to the well at the wrong time at a
[1:22:17] different time of the day and because
[1:22:19] she had lived unclean she couldn't get
[1:22:21] her act together she couldn't get out of
[1:22:22] the cycle that she was in amen but
[1:22:25] inside of her we can tell by the
[1:22:26] dialogue was a desire to worship the
[1:22:28] true god
[1:22:30] and god knew where she was and there was
[1:22:32] something down inside of her she was
[1:22:34] going to have to come in contact with
[1:22:36] the sign that was spoken against so the
[1:22:38] sign that was spoken against could
[1:22:40] reveal her heart
[1:22:44] she could be redeemed
[1:22:47] she had representation
[1:22:49] in heaven
[1:22:52] i don't know about you but that makes me
[1:22:54] so
[1:22:55] happy friends
[1:22:57] it's not anything we've done it's not
[1:22:59] our power it's not our mind it's not you
[1:23:02] know in our strength but i i believe
[1:23:04] amen by the grace of god that he's given
[1:23:07] to me to have faith to believe it that i
[1:23:09] have fallen from the thoughts of god
[1:23:10] then i'm not the son of my earthly
[1:23:13] parents but i'm a son of god that's been
[1:23:15] put on this earth for a season to
[1:23:17] accomplish something he wants to
[1:23:18] accomplish and i believe i've come in
[1:23:20] contact with the sure stone the precious
[1:23:22] stone the foundation stone and i'm
[1:23:24] standing upon that stone and i believe
[1:23:27] that i've heard from my theophany
[1:23:30] why because when i heard this message i
[1:23:32] recognized it was eagle's food i left
[1:23:34] the others brother branham said if
[1:23:36] you've done that you heard from your
[1:23:37] theophany if you have heard this message
[1:23:40] and recognize that it's eagle food and
[1:23:42] you left all the others then you heard
[1:23:44] from your theophany if you heard from
[1:23:46] your theophany you've got representation
[1:23:49] already on the other side there's no
[1:23:51] chance that you'll miss it amen it's not
[1:23:53] your strength it's not your will it's
[1:23:55] not your intellect amen it's god's
[1:23:57] predestinated plan you have fallen from
[1:23:59] the thoughts of god now you're here and
[1:24:01] the stumbling stone is a foundation
[1:24:03] stone inside of you
[1:24:07] and others are coming in contact with
[1:24:09] you
[1:24:11] and they're either stumbling
[1:24:13] or finding a foundation
[1:24:20] she had representation in heaven she
[1:24:22] turned around look at the difference
[1:24:24] between her and them preachers her
[1:24:26] priest them preachers when they saw it
[1:24:28] they said well this man is a fortune
[1:24:30] teller they didn't know the word he was
[1:24:32] a sign spoken against
[1:24:38] look what she said well now sir you must
[1:24:40] be a prophet
[1:24:42] they said you're of beelzebub she said
[1:24:44] you're a prophet
[1:24:47] someone will look at the prophet of god
[1:24:48] in this generation well he's a false
[1:24:50] prophet he's a charlatan he said this
[1:24:51] but you look at it and said that's a
[1:24:53] prophet of god
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:24:56] how because you have representation in
[1:24:58] heaven
[1:25:00] you're hearing
[1:25:01] you're hearing from yourself
[1:25:05] something somewhere else is saying it's
[1:25:07] okay
[1:25:09] it's good
[1:25:13] amen
[1:25:14] you know sir you must be a prophet we
[1:25:16] haven't had one for hundreds of years
[1:25:18] and we know when the messiah cometh
[1:25:19] that's what he is going to do oh my
[1:25:22] she could teach birmingham something she
[1:25:24] could teach the rest of the world
[1:25:25] something yes sir she could teach those
[1:25:27] theological seminaries something same
[1:25:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:25:34] let her teach us something today
[1:25:36] let's go to zechariah chapter 4.
[1:25:51] zechariah chapter 4.
[1:25:57] and we're going to read from verse 6.
[1:26:03] zechariah 4 and 6
[1:26:07] then he answered and speaking to me
[1:26:09] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[1:26:11] zerubbabel
[1:26:12] saying not by might nor by strength but
[1:26:14] by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:26:17] how's anything going to be accomplished
[1:26:19] for the kingdom of god
[1:26:20] this is how it's going to be
[1:26:21] accomplished
[1:26:24] not by might
[1:26:26] nor by power
[1:26:28] not say not by might nor by power but by
[1:26:31] my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[1:26:34] who art thou o great mountain before
[1:26:36] zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain
[1:26:38] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:26:40] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[1:26:42] grace unto it
[1:26:43] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[1:26:45] me saying the hands of zerubbabel have
[1:26:47] laid the foundation of this house his
[1:26:49] hands shall also finish it and thou
[1:26:51] shalt know that the lord of hosts hath
[1:26:54] sent me unto you
[1:26:56] brother branham comes to the message of
[1:26:58] grace in 1961 and this is what he says
[1:27:00] about this portion of scripture
[1:27:02] he says there are
[1:27:03] we are all acquainted with this
[1:27:05] scripture that that reads the bible we
[1:27:07] know that this was during the time of
[1:27:09] the preparation of the restoration of
[1:27:10] the temple
[1:27:12] and zerubbabel was a great prince among
[1:27:14] the people who had laid the foundation
[1:27:16] of the building
[1:27:17] and the set the context we know that
[1:27:19] israel has been taken captive into
[1:27:21] babylon
[1:27:23] they've been held in babylon for
[1:27:24] generations but now is the time that was
[1:27:26] prophesied by jeremiah that they are
[1:27:29] going to come back amen they're going to
[1:27:31] come back into the land and when they
[1:27:33] come back into the land to rebuild
[1:27:34] jerusalem they're going to rebuild the
[1:27:36] temple again they're going to restore
[1:27:37] the worship of jehovah again amen and
[1:27:40] this is
[1:27:41] this is typed in the church ages where
[1:27:44] the church has been carried away to
[1:27:45] babylonian system to to that mystery
[1:27:48] babylon the great
[1:27:52] but there's going to come a time amen
[1:27:54] that's prophesied i will restore again
[1:27:57] saith the lord
[1:27:59] that there's going to be a return back
[1:28:01] to the original and a restoration back
[1:28:04] of the worship of god
[1:28:06] and so zerubbabel but here he is showing
[1:28:09] in type when they went got carried away
[1:28:11] babylon but now they're coming out of
[1:28:12] babylon and now they're going to build
[1:28:14] again amen and zerubbabel is going to
[1:28:16] lay the foundation but he's also going
[1:28:18] to bring forth the headstones with
[1:28:19] cryings of grace grace unto him
[1:28:22] and that's what brother bannon is
[1:28:23] referring to now
[1:28:26] as we read further we find out that god
[1:28:28] says zerubbabel has laid the foundation
[1:28:30] with his hands he also shall bring forth
[1:28:31] the headstone i want you to notice he
[1:28:33] never said he shall bring forth the
[1:28:35] cornerstone he shall bring forth the
[1:28:36] headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:28:38] says that jesus is the chief cornerstone
[1:28:41] he's also the headstone now if we will
[1:28:43] think for a few minutes that's the
[1:28:45] seventh church messenger was to restore
[1:28:47] the faith of the children back to the
[1:28:49] fathers
[1:28:50] who is he talking about now
[1:28:53] in other words rebuild the church again
[1:28:55] under the power of the spirit
[1:28:57] who's he talking about now
[1:28:59] who's he typing cerubal with now
[1:29:02] not by power not by my but by my spirit
[1:29:05] saith the lord
[1:29:08] not by organization not by denomination
[1:29:10] but by the holy spirit god will bring
[1:29:12] forth the church in this last days
[1:29:15] zerubbabel the prince with joshua was
[1:29:17] the one that was to bring forth this
[1:29:18] headstone he had laid the foundation he
[1:29:21] took the people back to the foundation
[1:29:23] in type
[1:29:25] further down a couple paragraphs further
[1:29:27] he says but now according to the
[1:29:29] prophecy there will come the headstone
[1:29:31] and i want you to notice that when the
[1:29:33] headstone comes the prince that's going
[1:29:35] to cry out the message will cry out
[1:29:37] grace grace for it's by grace are we
[1:29:40] saved and not of works lest any men
[1:29:42] should boast
[1:29:43] so brother ben is now talking about amen
[1:29:46] zerubbabel who laid the foundation amen
[1:29:48] he's going to finish the work he's going
[1:29:50] to bring the headstone down the
[1:29:51] completion of it all and brother
[1:29:53] branham's saying this in time is the
[1:29:55] seventh angel is coming back to bring
[1:29:57] him back to the foundation bring him
[1:29:59] back to the foundation that paul laid
[1:30:02] bring him back to christ the chief
[1:30:04] cornerstone bring him back to the right
[1:30:06] dimensions of the church the right word
[1:30:08] the right layout the right pattern bring
[1:30:11] it all back amen and when he brings it
[1:30:13] all back the same one who brings it back
[1:30:15] is the same one who's going to call for
[1:30:17] the headstone
[1:30:19] and the headstone is going to be the
[1:30:20] capping stone to cap it all off
[1:30:24] and the message the future home brother
[1:30:26] van says
[1:30:28] is there a way brother branham
[1:30:31] he said yes
[1:30:32] become part of the word a part of the
[1:30:34] word of today
[1:30:36] can't be a part of the word of moses day
[1:30:38] that part is done made up that was
[1:30:39] defeat we're at the head now this is
[1:30:42] christ not the arm's time back in luther
[1:30:44] no this is the head time christ the
[1:30:46] headstone comes to the body
[1:30:49] this is the time amen through that
[1:30:51] prophetic ministry he restored us back
[1:30:53] to the original faith of the fathers
[1:30:55] brought us back to the right foundation
[1:30:57] brought us back to the correct
[1:30:58] cornerstone brought us back to the right
[1:31:00] teaching the right doctrine tying
[1:31:02] together all the loose ends and when he
[1:31:04] built it back now it was time to call
[1:31:06] for the headstone but the calling of the
[1:31:08] headstone would be grace
[1:31:10] grace
[1:31:12] not anything anybody did but what god
[1:31:14] has done amen it's his grace unto us
[1:31:19] and the message christ has revealed in
[1:31:20] his own word
[1:31:22] he said god was in the beginning and he
[1:31:23] kept coming down through the prophets
[1:31:25] and on down until god himself became
[1:31:28] human like us
[1:31:29] plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a
[1:31:31] baby born in a manger hated rejected
[1:31:33] despised a bad name and everything he
[1:31:36] was
[1:31:37] then he started rising seeing from the
[1:31:38] feet he began to build the church
[1:31:41] the bride
[1:31:42] coming back and on back and now coming
[1:31:45] out into the headstone
[1:31:47] brother branham now he's saying god was
[1:31:50] building all the way through that old
[1:31:51] testament until he finally came and the
[1:31:54] baby in the manger and from there he
[1:31:55] started building again up through the
[1:31:57] feet he was building the groom now he's
[1:32:00] building the bride
[1:32:02] and he's bringing the bride all the way
[1:32:04] up to the headstone where it all joins
[1:32:06] together and makes the one great
[1:32:08] transfigured body of jesus christ
[1:32:12] so zerubbabel
[1:32:14] who brought us back to the foundation is
[1:32:16] the rubal who brings the headstone
[1:32:19] the capping off
[1:32:21] in the message christ is the mystery of
[1:32:22] god revealed he says we have satan's
[1:32:24] answer
[1:32:25] god has vindicated himself god proves
[1:32:27] himself to his promise in this day
[1:32:30] hallelujah the headship is here
[1:32:36] is it coming
[1:32:37] no the headship is here
[1:32:40] amen he's done the work amen he's been
[1:32:43] here the son of man amen has come to do
[1:32:45] what to unite the the bride and the
[1:32:47] bridegroom the head and the body
[1:32:48] together to do what to reproduce the son
[1:32:51] of man again the headship is here the
[1:32:53] capstone has come amen that which was a
[1:32:56] sure foundation has become the capping
[1:32:58] stone
[1:33:00] that was the head of the corner has
[1:33:01] become the headstone
[1:33:05] see
[1:33:05] when you start off with the cornerstone
[1:33:07] the cornerstone
[1:33:09] we're looking at a pyramid because
[1:33:10] brother branham showed us this great
[1:33:12] city is the pyramid that cornerstone
[1:33:14] already has the angles for the entire
[1:33:16] pyramid
[1:33:17] the angle is in the stone
[1:33:20] the angles on the corner the right angle
[1:33:21] in the corner shows the stone shows the
[1:33:23] dimensions everything has to fit to this
[1:33:25] angle
[1:33:27] and you can build and build and build
[1:33:28] and build but you never know you've
[1:33:30] built right until the headstone comes
[1:33:33] and vindicated because if you've got the
[1:33:35] angle off the headstone will never fit
[1:33:37] if you were wrong in the word anywhere
[1:33:39] down here if the loose ends didn't tie
[1:33:41] together if the doctrines weren't laid
[1:33:43] out right if you didn't have it back
[1:33:45] zeroed into the cornerstone jesus christ
[1:33:48] by the time you got to the top it was
[1:33:49] going to be out of kilter somewhere and
[1:33:51] that headstone wouldn't lock in it would
[1:33:53] never come down and fit so the
[1:33:55] cornerstone amen is the one who starts
[1:33:57] it the alpha stone becomes the omega
[1:34:00] stone the beginning and the end the
[1:34:02] alpha stone is the one who lays the
[1:34:04] foundation and sets the pattern but the
[1:34:06] omega stone is the one who proves that
[1:34:09] this is it
[1:34:10] [Applause]
[1:34:11] [Music]
[1:34:12] you've got to build off the corner so
[1:34:14] brother branham brought us back to the
[1:34:16] sure foundation to the word of god jesus
[1:34:18] christ the word made flesh and he
[1:34:20] brought us back to the fullness of the
[1:34:21] word and brought us back to the gospel
[1:34:23] that paul preached when he laid out the
[1:34:25] pattern for the church
[1:34:27] he restored the stones that had fallen
[1:34:29] down he brought it back amen but he was
[1:34:32] powerless to do anything amen until he
[1:34:35] got everything in order and god decided
[1:34:37] i'm going to vindicate that this man was
[1:34:40] right i'm going to vindicate that this
[1:34:42] is my message that this is the truth and
[1:34:44] he came down himself as the headstone
[1:34:47] and when the headstone came down when
[1:34:49] you see that cloud from 1963 it's the
[1:34:52] brother banh said that cloud is the
[1:34:54] vindication that this message is the
[1:34:56] truth
[1:34:58] because the capstone vindicates the
[1:35:00] building
[1:35:02] that the angles are right the doctrines
[1:35:04] are right you've gone back to what paul
[1:35:06] said you've tied together the loose sins
[1:35:08] you've got the godhead right water
[1:35:10] baptism right marriage and divorce right
[1:35:12] you've got it right
[1:35:15] and when you see that headstone coming
[1:35:17] down amen it's the vindication that this
[1:35:20] message is the truth
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:25] amen
[1:35:27] it comes down to unite with you
[1:35:31] to vindicate that you're on the
[1:35:33] foundation
[1:35:35] and the ones are on the foundation
[1:35:38] the headstone becomes the vindication
[1:35:40] that you were built on the foundation
[1:35:46] what is a stone
[1:35:47] a revelation
[1:35:49] what is jesus christ the revelation of
[1:35:51] god
[1:35:54] and that revelation of the word became
[1:35:56] the cornerstone
[1:35:58] so what became the headstone
[1:36:00] the revelation of the word
[1:36:03] the revelation of the word the word made
[1:36:06] flesh and that day became the
[1:36:08] cornerstone what is the headstone the
[1:36:10] word made flesh in this day the bride is
[1:36:12] built up into the head she's coming to
[1:36:14] the headship
[1:36:18] vindicating that this message is right
[1:36:24] see when you see
[1:36:25] people doubt the cloud attack the cloud
[1:36:27] question the cloud
[1:36:29] listen don't forget what simeon said
[1:36:31] he's coming to be a sign that'll be
[1:36:33] spoken against
[1:36:35] to what to reveal the thoughts in many
[1:36:38] hearts
[1:36:40] so when god sends the sign that he
[1:36:42] promised the sign of the coming of the
[1:36:44] son of man amen the sign in the clouds
[1:36:46] when he brings that sign upon the earth
[1:36:49] amen when somebody begins to stumble
[1:36:51] over the stumbling stone amen you can
[1:36:53] say praise god you're stumbling over the
[1:36:56] stumbling stone a sign that is spoken
[1:36:58] against is a vindication to me that this
[1:37:01] message is right
[1:37:03] to you it's a stumbling stone to me it's
[1:37:05] the capping stone to you you stumble
[1:37:08] over it again to me it vindicates that
[1:37:10] what i believe is the truth
[1:37:13] it is my seal it is my it is my tying it
[1:37:17] together it is my vindication
[1:37:20] to you it's a question mark to me it
[1:37:22] answers all questions
[1:37:26] to you it's a further stumbling to me it
[1:37:28] ends all my stumbling about it is it's
[1:37:31] the high tower it's the strong tower
[1:37:33] it's the capping off it's the ceiling
[1:37:34] it's the securing it's the finishing
[1:37:36] it's the capping it all off and it's
[1:37:38] done it is done
[1:37:44] what else are you looking for he's here
[1:37:47] we've come into the headstone the
[1:37:49] headstone has come down under this
[1:37:51] ministry in this last day what else are
[1:37:53] we waiting for amen he's sealed it off
[1:37:56] he's vindicated it it's become a sign
[1:37:58] spoken against to reveal the hearts of
[1:38:00] many let it reveal the hearts of many
[1:38:02] let that sign spoken against reveal your
[1:38:05] heart
[1:38:08] don't try to stop people speaking
[1:38:10] against it
[1:38:12] because they have to
[1:38:16] don't try to stop people from stumbling
[1:38:18] over the stumbling stone they have to
[1:38:22] it's the same stone that was in the
[1:38:24] corner it's the same stone that's in the
[1:38:25] head
[1:38:28] if they stumbled at the cornerstone they
[1:38:30] stumble over the headstone
[1:38:34] if the world stumbles let them stumble
[1:38:37] but friends don't let that be your
[1:38:38] stumbling
[1:38:40] because you fell from the thoughts of
[1:38:42] god
[1:38:43] you can be redeemed
[1:38:45] you've got representation of heaven when
[1:38:47] you see that sign amen be be like the
[1:38:50] foolish shepherds who were uneducated
[1:38:52] they didn't know anything
[1:38:54] them shepherds didn't know they had no
[1:38:55] education they had no bible training
[1:38:57] they didn't know anything but one thing
[1:38:59] they knew is they could spot a sheep
[1:39:01] from a mile away when a lamb was born
[1:39:03] they knew what a lamb being born looked
[1:39:05] like so god why did it have to be
[1:39:08] shepherds because they're the only ones
[1:39:09] that would understand the birth of the
[1:39:11] lamb of god
[1:39:13] amen why did it have to be fishermen and
[1:39:15] tax collectors and harlots and
[1:39:17] prostitutes and all of these nobody why
[1:39:19] did it have to be them because everybody
[1:39:21] else was stumbling over the sign and
[1:39:23] speaking against it but there had to be
[1:39:25] a people on earth that weren't relying
[1:39:27] on their intellect but there was
[1:39:28] something deeper on the inside that had
[1:39:30] fallen from the thoughts of god when
[1:39:32] they come in contact with a sign spoken
[1:39:34] against they could say i don't have a
[1:39:36] problem with that i believe that's the
[1:39:37] truth
[1:39:39] their family speaks against it they're
[1:39:41] going to have
[1:39:42] pastors speak against it churches speak
[1:39:44] against it they can have people leave
[1:39:46] the message and speak against it but
[1:39:47] there's a sign spoken against
[1:39:51] to reveal the thoughts of the hearts of
[1:39:53] people
[1:39:55] so let the signs spoken against reveal
[1:39:58] what's in your heart
[1:40:01] what's in your heart i hope a sure
[1:40:03] foundation
[1:40:05] i hope a tried stone i hope a true stone
[1:40:08] i hope a precious stone
[1:40:10] is in your heart the revelation
[1:40:13] of jesus christ
[1:40:15] not just the revelation of christ 2000
[1:40:17] years ago but the revelation of christ
[1:40:19] today
[1:40:20] the alpha the omega the corner and the
[1:40:23] head
[1:40:24] all united together to cap off this
[1:40:27] bride
[1:40:28] to show his glory on the earth in this
[1:40:30] end time
[1:40:32] brother ram says again in christ is the
[1:40:34] mystery of god revealed what is it not
[1:40:36] them people
[1:40:38] the headship in the body has become one
[1:40:42] the headship in the body has become one
[1:40:45] unit
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:47] you can say
[1:40:49] i don't see that cloud anymore
[1:40:55] where's the sign
[1:40:57] see the cloud
[1:40:59] was a real sign it was the sign of his
[1:41:01] coming
[1:41:02] when brother man was told to take the
[1:41:04] picture and turn it to the right he saw
[1:41:05] the image of christ
[1:41:08] and he said that's our lord up there
[1:41:11] but god never sent the sign
[1:41:15] for us to put a picture on the wall and
[1:41:17] sit here by the sign and say i believe
[1:41:18] this sign this sign went somewhere
[1:41:22] just like the sign that was given to the
[1:41:24] there was a sign that was given to the
[1:41:26] shepherds and that sign was you'll find
[1:41:27] a babe wrapped in a swaddling cloth
[1:41:30] lying in a manger that sign was so that
[1:41:32] they could see that christ was here
[1:41:35] but 10 years later they can't go find
[1:41:38] the babe wrapped in swelling gloss lying
[1:41:40] in the manger
[1:41:41] that babe 12 years later was now
[1:41:43] disputing in the temple now what was
[1:41:46] there is there
[1:41:49] the sign was a true sign but the life
[1:41:52] and the sign is now the life there and
[1:41:53] the twelve-year-old and the temple
[1:41:55] confounding them with their wisdom
[1:41:58] and then what was in the manger amen is
[1:42:00] now standing by the sea of galilee
[1:42:03] breaking loaves of fish to feed 5 000
[1:42:06] men and women and children amen the
[1:42:07] shepherds could go every year they could
[1:42:09] go back and light candles in the cave
[1:42:12] where he was and say this is where the
[1:42:13] sign was and they could miss where he's
[1:42:15] at
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:18] but the sign was to indicate he's come
[1:42:22] but when he's come you stay with him
[1:42:26] the sign of that cloud was to tell us
[1:42:28] the headship has returned to the body
[1:42:30] now where did the headship go the
[1:42:32] headship has been united with the body
[1:42:34] the head and the body are one unit now
[1:42:37] now the headship the headstone the
[1:42:39] capping stone is in the bride
[1:42:43] and he's here manifesting himself in the
[1:42:45] formation of the bride
[1:42:49] we can stay with the sign it's a sign
[1:42:51] spoken against
[1:42:53] let it be
[1:42:55] when jesus was standing there in john
[1:42:57] chapter 8 speaking to pharisees
[1:43:00] and the religious leaders and scribes
[1:43:02] amen he was that sign now he's in he's
[1:43:05] in an adult form
[1:43:08] and they're still speaking against the
[1:43:10] sign
[1:43:11] say did we not well say of you you're of
[1:43:13] samaritan
[1:43:15] you're a little legitimate birth
[1:43:18] still speaking against a sign listen
[1:43:20] friends there's still people speaking
[1:43:21] against the sign let them speak against
[1:43:23] the sign the reality of the signs here
[1:43:25] in my heart
[1:43:28] amen what that sign represented is here
[1:43:30] in my heart amen christ has come to
[1:43:33] unite himself with me to live in me and
[1:43:35] i'm trying every day to give him a
[1:43:37] greater preeminence trying every day to
[1:43:39] surrender my life in a greater way to
[1:43:41] him that he might have a greater
[1:43:42] manifestation now it's not whether you
[1:43:44] believe the sign or not now i'm i'm
[1:43:47] totally absorbed in trying to give him
[1:43:49] preeminence i'm totally absorbed in
[1:43:50] trying to give him first place because
[1:43:52] the headship is here but i'm trying
[1:43:54] every day to stay out of the way so that
[1:43:56] the headship can manifest himself
[1:43:59] now i'm not concerned whether you
[1:44:00] believe the sign or not you can believe
[1:44:02] the sign or not believe the sign but i'm
[1:44:04] trying to manifest the sign with all
[1:44:06] that's in me and not get in the way and
[1:44:08] not hinder his walk not take my own idea
[1:44:10] not get consumed in this world i'm
[1:44:12] trying to beat this body into subjection
[1:44:14] and bring it into subjection to the sign
[1:44:16] that's in me
[1:44:22] and that sign in this end time has
[1:44:23] become another stumbling stone
[1:44:27] these people
[1:44:29] the coming of the lord
[1:44:30] the lord is present
[1:44:32] in you
[1:44:34] what does that become another stumbling
[1:44:36] stone
[1:44:38] but it's not just a stumbling stone
[1:44:40] friends
[1:44:41] it's also a sure foundation
[1:44:44] it's also a precious stone
[1:44:46] it's a tried stone a true stone
[1:44:49] that we can rest upon
[1:44:54] the headship and the body has become one
[1:44:56] unit
[1:44:58] it's god manifested in his people that's
[1:45:00] the reason the husband and wife is no
[1:45:02] longer twain they're one
[1:45:04] god and his church is one christ in you
[1:45:08] god's great revelation
[1:45:12] what is god's great revelation christ
[1:45:14] and you as one
[1:45:19] i was trying to get great revelations
[1:45:20] the greatest revelation is christ in you
[1:45:22] as one
[1:45:24] as one person together the husband and
[1:45:26] the wife united as one that's the great
[1:45:28] revelation of god
[1:45:32] god's great revelation glory to god even
[1:45:34] bearing his name his name is jesus
[1:45:37] the anointing
[1:45:39] excuse me
[1:45:40] let's look at one more scripture luke
[1:45:41] chapter 18 and i would like to finish
[1:45:43] with this
[1:45:47] if the musicians would like to come
[1:45:49] forward and brother ben if you'll make
[1:45:50] your way up
[1:45:54] matthew matthew 20 i'm sorry luke 18.
[1:46:01] luke 18 and i'm going to begin reading
[1:46:03] in verse 8.
[1:46:10] i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:46:11] speedily nevertheless
[1:46:14] when the son of man cometh
[1:46:16] shall he find faith on the earth
[1:46:20] that was the question we're talking
[1:46:21] about the coming of the son of man
[1:46:24] when the son of man cometh will he find
[1:46:26] faith on the earth
[1:46:31] how many of you can speak affirmatively
[1:46:32] and say yes
[1:46:35] because he's put the faith in me
[1:46:37] it was a gift of faith it was a seed
[1:46:39] gene of god
[1:46:40] will he find faith on the earth he's not
[1:46:42] he's not talking about mental faith
[1:46:45] he's not looking about for somebody who
[1:46:46] will agree with him
[1:46:48] that will sympathize with him he's
[1:46:50] looking for somebody who has something
[1:46:51] on the inside that will believe
[1:46:54] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:46:57] faith on the earth
[1:46:58] and i can say yes
[1:47:00] because of grace
[1:47:03] grace
[1:47:04] god's wonderful grace
[1:47:07] if he wanted to find faith on the earth
[1:47:09] he was going to have to plant seeds of
[1:47:10] faith
[1:47:12] he couldn't have found faith on the
[1:47:13] earth unless he had planted seeds of
[1:47:15] faith and if he had planted seeds of
[1:47:16] faith then he was going to use a sign
[1:47:18] spoken against to reveal the heart to
[1:47:19] find where the faith was
[1:47:22] and the faith was in the heart of his
[1:47:24] children
[1:47:26] say oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm
[1:47:29] one of them
[1:47:31] not by might not by power but by his
[1:47:34] spirit
[1:47:36] god has done a great work for me god has
[1:47:38] done a wonderful thing for me i could
[1:47:40] never amen i could never come up with
[1:47:43] the concept of hearing from my theophany
[1:47:45] amen it had to happen it had to be
[1:47:47] something that god did it had to be a
[1:47:49] voice that could penetrate down to the
[1:47:51] inside of me that would tell me that
[1:47:53] this is nothing but the truth amen
[1:47:55] there had to be something else besides
[1:47:57] me and man it couldn't have just been me
[1:47:59] a human being it had to be something
[1:48:01] with me more in me than just a human
[1:48:04] being because millions and billions of
[1:48:05] human beings have walked away and
[1:48:07] stumbled over the stumbling stone why
[1:48:09] for some this message is a stumbling
[1:48:11] stone but for me it's my sure foundation
[1:48:15] why does summit make them uncomfortable
[1:48:16] why does it make me so comfortable why
[1:48:19] for some does it seem so foreign and why
[1:48:21] for me is it so familiar
[1:48:23] why for others is it like something from
[1:48:25] another planet but for me it's a voice
[1:48:27] from home
[1:48:29] it's a familiar sound it's the original
[1:48:31] language i used to speak somewhere else
[1:48:33] at another time
[1:48:35] why is that it's not me it's something
[1:48:38] god has done amen and god has sent these
[1:48:40] signs he's done these works he's come
[1:48:42] into the earth and the way he's coming
[1:48:44] to the earth to be a sign spoken against
[1:48:46] that he might reveal what's in the heart
[1:48:49] and i say god reveal yourself in me
[1:48:53] find faith right here
[1:48:56] because you've planted it there i
[1:48:57] believe it with all my heart you've
[1:48:59] planted it there
[1:49:01] and i can only respond to you
[1:49:04] see when
[1:49:06] god
[1:49:07] is his voice is in the earth today
[1:49:09] because his voice is in the bride
[1:49:11] and god is calling out for something
[1:49:14] what's he calling out for
[1:49:16] many will stumble many will fall many
[1:49:18] will reject and he already knows that
[1:49:19] but what's he calling out for he's
[1:49:21] calling out for himself
[1:49:24] the word is calling to the
[1:49:26] word an eagle screaming to an eagle see
[1:49:30] it wasn't you that got a hold of god
[1:49:34] you never got a hold of god
[1:49:36] the god in you got a hold of god
[1:49:39] when god came along there was god on the
[1:49:41] inside god on the inside recognized god
[1:49:44] coming along and god got a hold of god
[1:49:46] word came to word eagle scream came the
[1:49:49] eagle scream amen it was god looking for
[1:49:51] god and god finding god and god holding
[1:49:54] on to god you haven't held on to
[1:49:56] anything it's the god in you that's held
[1:49:58] on to god
[1:50:00] if it wasn't for that there's nothing we
[1:50:02] can do just live as best in life as we
[1:50:04] can be as nice as we can do the best
[1:50:06] work we can for christian works and hope
[1:50:08] that it works out in the end but we've
[1:50:09] got something other than that a face
[1:50:11] seat on the inside that says that
[1:50:13] whatever he said it's the truth amen
[1:50:16] i've never heard it before but it's the
[1:50:17] truth what that prophet taught is the
[1:50:19] truth what this scripture says is the
[1:50:21] truth and i believe it and that sign was
[1:50:25] the sign of his coming
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:29] god hunting up god
[1:50:33] looking for his children his attributes
[1:50:35] that are sowed into the earth
[1:50:39] when you reach out for god it's not
[1:50:41] these hands
[1:50:43] it's not this mind
[1:50:45] but it's something in the soul reaching
[1:50:46] back and getting ahold
[1:50:49] say i'm here lord
[1:50:51] i'm here father i hear your voice
[1:50:53] that's a familiar sound to me
[1:50:56] here i am lord
[1:50:58] god help me climb up on the precious
[1:51:00] stone
[1:51:02] on the shore foundation
[1:51:04] and help me lord to plant my feet
[1:51:07] on solid ground
[1:51:09] god bless you let's all stand friends
[1:51:11] and let's just pray
[1:51:17] you know when that headstone comes down
[1:51:20] jesus says
[1:51:22] the
[1:51:23] cornerstone has become the head of the
[1:51:25] corner of the headstone
[1:51:28] and whoever falls on it will be broken
[1:51:29] whoever it falls on will be ground in
[1:51:31] the powder because we know according to
[1:51:33] daniel's prophecy in daniel chapter 2
[1:51:35] that stone cut out of the mountains of
[1:51:36] my hands will grind in the powder all
[1:51:38] the systems of man
[1:51:40] all the gentile systems of this world
[1:51:42] it'll grind it'll destroy so that stone
[1:51:44] is a destroying stone
[1:51:48] but that what is a destroying stone for
[1:51:50] one is a vindicating stone for another
[1:51:54] the one that that ends world gentile
[1:51:57] powers
[1:51:59] brings you into power with the king of
[1:52:02] kings and the lord of lords
[1:52:04] one brings judgment to you it saved you
[1:52:07] from judgment
[1:52:09] to one it brings condemnation to you
[1:52:11] it's freed you from condemnation to the
[1:52:13] one that brings destruction to you it
[1:52:14] brings life amen to one it ends the
[1:52:16] world system to you it brings you into
[1:52:18] your system amen which is the system of
[1:52:21] the son of god
[1:52:22] the son of david
[1:52:24] it just depends on which side you're on
[1:52:26] and i say god by grace you've put me on
[1:52:28] your side and i can never be more
[1:52:30] grateful more thankful i can never stop
[1:52:33] worshiping you worship can go on for
[1:52:35] eternity because of what god has done
[1:52:37] for us friends not what we've done for
[1:52:38] ourselves
[1:52:40] and that capstone has come down with
[1:52:42] shoutings of grace grace not just grace
[1:52:45] for salvation but now grace
[1:52:48] for a body change
[1:52:50] to go to the right condition we were
[1:52:52] always meant to be in
[1:52:55] the headstone has come down with
[1:52:56] shoutings of grace
[1:52:58] grace double grace
[1:53:00] oh let's just worship him let's just bow
[1:53:02] our heads and tell him how much we love
[1:53:04] him oh father we love you lord we thank
[1:53:07] you jesus for this day for your word
[1:53:09] lord which means so much to us god for
[1:53:12] when the realization of what you've done
[1:53:14] lord when we see the world trembling and
[1:53:15] the world shaking and the rejecters
[1:53:17] rejecting and speaking against your
[1:53:19] signs and speaking against your ministry
[1:53:22] speaking against your word god we're so
[1:53:24] thankful that we can say to them what's
[1:53:26] stumbling to me is a solid rock
[1:53:30] god it's by your grace
[1:53:32] god i pray if there's any amongst us
[1:53:34] that are still stumbling
[1:53:36] i pray god that you would turn the dial
[1:53:37] inside their heart that you would wake
[1:53:39] up that seed gene on the inside and they
[1:53:41] could realize this is not a stumbling
[1:53:44] stone but this is a foundation stone
[1:53:47] and this message isn't something to
[1:53:48] question or to flounder over to wonder
[1:53:51] about or ponder over or to speculate on
[1:53:55] but this message is a sure foundation a
[1:53:57] precious stone
[1:53:59] that we can set our feet upon and be
[1:54:01] grounded
[1:54:02] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:54:04] against us
[1:54:06] god i pray that you'd help us to stay
[1:54:08] firmly planted on this rock
[1:54:10] this revelation of who you are a
[1:54:12] personal revelation to each individual
[1:54:15] what if there's an individual amongst us
[1:54:17] that that you have not revealed yourself
[1:54:19] to lord in this way i pray you go to
[1:54:22] them now
[1:54:23] for we can do nothing without you lord
[1:54:26] and i pray god that you would begin to
[1:54:27] penetrate deep into the heart
[1:54:30] and find that portion of the word laying
[1:54:32] there waiting to come to manifestation
[1:54:35] lord i pray that you would open every
[1:54:37] heart lord and reveal the thoughts that
[1:54:39] are deep in the heart
[1:54:41] that we might know were your children
[1:54:42] lord and where we came from
[1:54:44] and where it is you're taking us to and
[1:54:46] what our purpose is on this earth
[1:54:48] we love you lord we thank you father
[1:54:51] so thankful that we can say that by
[1:54:53] grace
[1:54:54] you're my foundation stoned by grace
[1:54:56] you're my capping stone
[1:54:59] by grace you've saved me by grace you've
[1:55:01] kept me low and sealed me and i can say
[1:55:04] lord of the full heart that i love you
[1:55:06] lord
[1:55:07] that your work is good and your word is
[1:55:09] perfect and it's beautiful and i love
[1:55:12] you for it lord
