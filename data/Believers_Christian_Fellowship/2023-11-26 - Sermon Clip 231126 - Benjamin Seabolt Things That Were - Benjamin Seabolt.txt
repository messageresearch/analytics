========================================

he has been kind enough to send me a prophet to come in the form of a prophet and reveal himself to me as his son what he hath taught me before he is teaching me now what more could I ask for amen I find it astounding that this is a son that could stand there and look his father in the eye and say I have done all of your Commandments and I have not aired one time time and his father didn't correct him he didn't say well there was this time you did he stands there and he says I have done everything and I've kept all your Commandments but he still had jealousy laying in his heart he was still more concerned about his brother's position and his brother's reception than he was about his own position that's why I say getting all the teachings and all the doctrines to me that's not it that comes with it and I will never say that that's not important because it's extremely important but I believe that you can have such an intellectual power and an intellectual understanding and a legalistic ability to do what is right and what is what is uh true and I like I said I don't belittle any of that I should I say we should be more like that but at the end of the day the problem here with this son even though he can say I've done everything you've asked me to do the problem was he still had something laying in his heart he still had jealousy laying in his heart and the father had to come and deal with that he had to come and remind him it doesn't matter about anybody else what matters is you're my son and all that I have is thine quit worrying about your brother and I would just say me personally that I don't ever want to find myself in that position I don't want to ever find myself in the seat of the scornful of somebody who's went Wayward and somebody who's lost track but they would come with a repentant heart I I pray to God that I would never have that in my life that I would come and say well Lord I've served you for x amount of years and I've done this and I've sacrificed this and you're blessing that person and you know they just they just came back two weeks ago and look at all that they've done I want to be there putting the robe on him putting the ring on his finger helping Phil dress that cow I want to be cooking the meat for him I want to be rejoicing and I want to be merry regardless of how Wayward and how long that it's been I want to respond with the power of the Revelation that I am a son of this father and a wayward son has returned what can I do to help him what can I do to assist him how can I encourage him or her I want to respond correctly
