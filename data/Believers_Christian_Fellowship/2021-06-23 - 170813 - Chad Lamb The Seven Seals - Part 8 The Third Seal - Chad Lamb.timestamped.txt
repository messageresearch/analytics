[0:00] let's read daniel chapter 12 verse 8.
[0:08] it says and i heard but i understood not
[0:10] then said i
[0:11] o my lord what shall be the end of these
[0:14] things
[0:15] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[0:17] words are closed up and sealed till the
[0:19] time of the end
[0:21] many shall be purified and made white
[0:23] and tried but the wicked shall do
[0:25] wickedly
[0:26] and none of the wicked shall understand
[0:28] but the wise
[0:29] shall understand amen this is the time
[0:33] for understanding friends we've come to
[0:36] the time of the unsealing of these words
[0:38] that were sealed up to daniel
[0:39] sealed up to the time of the end they've
[0:42] now been unsealed
[0:43] and the wicked will do wickedly and
[0:45] shall not understand
[0:46] but the wise shall understand
[0:51] let's bow our heads dear heavenly father
[0:53] we thank you lord for this day and for
[0:55] this opportunity lord to look into your
[0:57] word
[0:58] no we don't take it lightly but we look
[1:00] seriously into these things
[1:02] this means more to us than this life
[1:04] that we're living in the natural lord
[1:06] because this is what's going to produce
[1:07] eternal life for us lord this is what's
[1:09] going to take us
[1:10] from this life to the next life i pray
[1:13] lord that you would just quicken your
[1:14] word to us anoint us lord with your word
[1:16] just take this vessel and speak your
[1:18] words across these lips of clay
[1:20] lord we ask that you take preeminence in
[1:22] this place we receive you lord in jesus
[1:25] christ's name we pray
[1:26] amen you can all be seated
[1:30] i also want to welcome back our our
[1:32] brothers who've been away ministering
[1:34] brother mike allen's been gone two
[1:35] sundays in a row
[1:36] so it's good to have him back he
[1:37] preached for brother steve hamilton two
[1:39] weeks ago
[1:40] which is where my mom attends down in
[1:42] springboro and then last sunday he was
[1:43] with his uncle jerry right
[1:45] in hamilton so it's good to have you
[1:47] guys back it's been a while
[1:48] and it's good to have brother benjamin
[1:50] sebolt and his wife back they were going
[1:52] last week
[1:53] in arkansas right for david morse yeah
[1:56] so it's good to have the brothers back
[1:58] and we miss you when you're gone but we
[2:00] understand you gotta go
[2:02] we support you when you go but we're
[2:03] glad to have you back it's nice to be
[2:05] here together and
[2:06] look at this seal together i've got
[2:08] quite a few
[2:10] slides i want to go through and i'm
[2:11] going to go through the first part very
[2:12] quickly
[2:13] because it's a lot of review and so we
[2:16] want to make sure that
[2:18] we stay we stay up as these things build
[2:21] these seals have a way of building and
[2:22] progressing and one moving to another
[2:25] so we want to stay with these as we go
[2:29] you see here i got the clicker i like
[2:32] the clicker
[2:37] in the breach he says now we go to break
[2:39] these seals you're going to see it goes
[2:41] plumb back in the scripture all the way
[2:43] back for each one of those seals
[2:45] the whole thing together the whole
[2:46] mystery lays right here
[2:48] in these seals every mystery of the
[2:50] bible lays in these seals
[2:52] and the seals cannot be broken until
[2:54] that time
[2:56] so this is this is why we've been
[2:57] focusing on this because he says
[3:00] it goes plumb back into the scriptures
[3:02] in every mystery of the bible lays in
[3:04] those seals
[3:05] so this is a very important subject when
[3:08] brother branham came to break this this
[3:09] wasn't just
[3:10] one of the things he ministered on this
[3:12] wasn't just one of the
[3:14] highlights of his ministry this was the
[3:16] highlight of his ministry
[3:18] amen unlocking this was the book of
[3:20] redemption to show redemption
[3:22] who who's included in redemption who's
[3:24] for redemption
[3:25] how he's been working out redemption
[3:27] amen and for you and i that are the
[3:28] redeemed
[3:29] this is the most important subject that
[3:31] we will ever face that we will ever come
[3:32] in contact with
[3:34] because if it wasn't for redemption we
[3:36] would be separated from god
[3:38] and we come from god and we're going
[3:40] back to god but the path
[3:42] back to god is in this book of
[3:44] redemption and it explains how we fell
[3:47] away and
[3:47] what happened in the beginning and what
[3:49] god's been doing to restore us
[3:51] back to bring us back into that perfect
[3:54] place that we fell from
[3:56] that's why this is an important book
[3:58] this isn't this isn't just we're not
[4:00] wasting our time
[4:01] going over this book and we're not
[4:02] wasting our time going through the seals
[4:05] because it's opening up all of
[4:07] redemption to us
[4:10] now i want to look at this drawing that
[4:11] we had drawn that
[4:13] this seven sealed scroll because
[4:16] i come to find out we had this drawn
[4:18] wrong
[4:19] a brother a brother approached me one of
[4:21] the ministering brothers here at the
[4:22] church with a quote
[4:23] and when i read this quote he was
[4:25] absolutely right and this explains a
[4:27] tremendous
[4:28] mystery so i want to go through this
[4:30] when we were first
[4:32] having this drawn up we pulled together
[4:34] all the quotes and brother branham
[4:35] explains about
[4:36] rolling it up and putting a c on the end
[4:38] and the end stuck out and they put
[4:39] another seal and
[4:40] when you would break the first seal you
[4:42] would unwind it and read it and then you
[4:43] break the next seal and unwind it
[4:45] so we pulled all those quotes together
[4:48] but but we had a question and i was
[4:50] talking to franco i said the question is
[4:52] i don't know
[4:53] if we should put the seventh seal on the
[4:55] outside or the inside
[4:59] because we know the seventh seal is a
[5:01] person amen it's jesus christ who comes
[5:03] and takes the books and loose it
[5:05] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[5:06] he's the open seal to us
[5:08] is the coming of the lord and so now
[5:11] does that have to happen first and you
[5:12] open the other seals
[5:13] or is it in the inside and brother
[5:15] branham starts talking about breaking
[5:16] them in chronological order so you break
[5:18] the first one you undo that
[5:19] then he comes to the second one and then
[5:21] the third one and so
[5:23] i said by default let's put it in the
[5:25] middle because we don't know it's just a
[5:26] picture right
[5:28] and now this brother gives me this quote
[5:31] and now i know why we were having such a
[5:33] problem trying to figure this out
[5:34] because here's the quote and the sixth
[5:36] seal says remember
[5:38] remember these hidden mysteries in the
[5:40] sixth seals together all together is one
[5:42] great big book just six scrolls
[5:46] rolled together not seven
[5:49] scrolls rolled together six scrolls
[5:52] rolled together and it unwinds the whole
[5:55] book of redemption that's how the whole
[5:57] earth was redeemed
[5:59] now let's look at this in the scriptures
[6:01] let's go to revelations
[6:03] chapter 6.
[6:08] we'll explain why this is a big deal to
[6:10] me it may not be a big deal to you but
[6:13] this is a big deal to me
[6:17] let's go to revelations chapter 6
[6:24] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[6:26] the seals and i heard as it were the
[6:27] noise of thunder and one of the four
[6:29] beasts saying come and see
[6:31] and i saw and behold a white horse and
[6:32] he that sat on him had a bow
[6:34] and a crown was given unto him and he
[6:36] went forth conquering and to conquer
[6:38] when he opened the second seal i heard
[6:40] the second beast say
[6:41] come and see and there was and there
[6:44] went out another horse that was red and
[6:46] power was given to him that sat there on
[6:48] to take
[6:49] peace from the earth and they should
[6:50] kill one another and there was given
[6:52] unto him
[6:53] a great sword that's the second seal now
[6:55] we come to the third seal that's what
[6:56] we're going to deal with this morning
[6:58] when he had opened the third seal i
[6:59] heard the third beast say come and see
[7:01] and behold
[7:02] and lo a black horse and he that sat on
[7:04] him and a pair of balances in his hand
[7:06] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[7:08] four beasts saying a measure of wheat
[7:10] for a penny and three measures of barley
[7:12] for a penny
[7:12] and see thou heard not the oil and the
[7:14] wine when he had opened the fourth seal
[7:17] i heard the
[7:18] voice of the fourth beast say come and
[7:19] see and i looked and behold a pale horse
[7:22] and his name that sat on him was death
[7:24] and hell followed him and power was
[7:26] given unto them over the fourth part of
[7:27] the earth to kill with the sword
[7:29] with hunger with death and the beast of
[7:31] the earth
[7:32] so we see the same pattern goes all the
[7:34] way through chapter six and
[7:36] the then he opens the fifth seal and i
[7:38] saw souls under the altar and he
[7:40] describes that
[7:41] and then verse 12 and behold when he
[7:42] opened the sixth seal
[7:44] and though there was a great earthquake
[7:45] and the sun became black a sackcloth and
[7:47] hair and moon
[7:48] and so now every time he opens a seal
[7:51] there's a description and under this
[7:52] description
[7:53] is the symbolic meaning of what's in the
[7:56] seal what's written under that seal
[7:58] but if you turn over to chapter 8
[8:01] verse 1
[8:05] it says then when he opened the seventh
[8:06] seal there was silence in heaven about
[8:08] the space of half an hour
[8:11] there's no symbol there's no riding
[8:15] there's nothing when he opens the
[8:17] seventh seal there's nothing
[8:19] he doesn't even open the seventh seal
[8:21] the same way that he opens the six
[8:23] because in revelations chapter 6 he
[8:25] opens all six
[8:27] so you have six open in the sixth
[8:29] chapter amen
[8:31] and god as always you're seeing six come
[8:33] all the way through
[8:34] there's six scrolls rolled together as
[8:36] the whole book of redemption
[8:37] it's the six seals that reveal the
[8:39] seventh seal and we went through that
[8:41] the six revealing the seventh
[8:43] all the way through you find six and the
[8:45] seventh is revealed in the six
[8:47] remember when jesus did his first
[8:49] miracle in cana
[8:50] he turned six pots of water into wine
[8:53] because it was the seventh seal that was
[8:55] doing the work in the sixth
[8:57] right and so we find out also that
[9:00] that when when boaz was measuring out
[9:03] barley
[9:04] amen because he made a covenant with
[9:06] ruth and he was measuring up barley he
[9:08] gives her six measures
[9:09] and there was no seventh because the
[9:11] seventh was the one dealing out the six
[9:14] amen we find pilate when he calls jesus
[9:17] to come forth he brings him forth in the
[9:18] sixth hour
[9:19] and he says behold thy king. see the
[9:22] king is
[9:22] proclaimed in the sixth hallelujah
[9:26] and so now now we find out
[9:30] also it was the sixth hour of the day
[9:32] that he came to the woman of samaria and
[9:34] sat upon the well
[9:35] and as he began to talk to her he began
[9:36] to realize she had six husbands amen
[9:39] and he was going to free her from his
[9:40] condition because he was the seventh
[9:43] amen
[9:43] so the seventh is never declared openly
[9:46] the seventh is the one doing the
[9:48] declaring
[9:51] so there's six measures there there's
[9:54] six
[9:54] days amen and the sixth deal
[9:58] is when the when the seventh seal is
[10:00] revealed it's in the sixth seal
[10:02] because we're we're in the days of the
[10:04] sixth seal now because the sixth seal
[10:06] began
[10:07] at the time of hitler brother branham
[10:08] says at world war ii the sixth seal and
[10:10] the sixth trumpet
[10:11] sound at the same time and the sixth
[10:14] trumpet amen is world war
[10:15] ii so we're in the days of the sixtieth
[10:18] and in the days of the sixth seal which
[10:20] happens to be the sixth thousandth year
[10:22] since the fall of man and man is number
[10:25] six it's all
[10:26] revealing the seventh
[10:32] so it is a six
[10:35] scrolls rolled together
[10:38] to make up this whole document
[10:42] the six scrolls rolled together it
[10:44] unwinds the whole book of redemption
[10:47] because the seventh is the one doing the
[10:49] unwinding
[10:51] this is all the way through the bible
[10:52] and you know that
[10:54] solomon we know was a perfect type of
[10:56] christ in the millennium before he fell
[10:59] and solomon is the son of david he takes
[11:01] the throne of david
[11:03] he brings israel into their golden age
[11:05] and it's a type of the church coming
[11:07] into the millennium
[11:08] and we know that solomon built himself a
[11:11] throne
[11:11] and if you go back and read solomon had
[11:14] a white throne
[11:16] solomon judged from a white throne
[11:18] because it said solomon
[11:20] built a throne made out of ivory
[11:23] what color is ivory it's white
[11:26] so solomon and sat upon a white throne
[11:30] amen and when he built the throne there
[11:32] was six steps
[11:33] on the throne because when you go up the
[11:36] six steps
[11:36] you come to solomon
[11:40] amen all through the bible is telling
[11:43] the same thing
[11:44] the six revealed the seventh when god
[11:47] made man in his image he made them male
[11:49] and female in the image of god he made
[11:51] them he made them on the
[11:53] sixth day the six days of creation
[11:56] declare
[11:56] the seventh the creator himself on the
[11:58] seventh he doesn't do anything
[12:01] he doesn't reveal anything he doesn't
[12:03] make anything
[12:04] he doesn't declare anything because he's
[12:06] been the one declaring it all along
[12:08] in the six days of creation declare him
[12:13] so that's why this is a big deal to me
[12:16] that we get this picture right
[12:18] amen so now we called up joel and and
[12:21] brother franco sent him the text and
[12:22] joel's a superhero because he fixed it
[12:24] in like one day
[12:25] and he comes back and he gave us a
[12:28] six scroll document there is a seventh
[12:32] seal
[12:32] absolutely and the seventh deal has to
[12:34] be broken but the seventh seal is the
[12:36] person brother branham said
[12:38] the seventh seal is jesus christ amen in
[12:41] christ
[12:41] is the whole book
[12:45] not a revelation he's not a revelation
[12:49] he is the revelation
[12:52] he's the one doing the revealing he's
[12:55] the whole thing
[12:56] that's the seventh seal hallelujah
[13:00] oh i love it when you find a mistake
[13:03] like that
[13:04] praise god now we climb up the six steps
[13:07] and come in contact with solomon himself
[13:11] so we're going to review a little bit
[13:12] the first seal the lamb came forth and
[13:14] went over to him that sat upon the
[13:16] throne
[13:16] that held the complete title deed of
[13:18] redemption and the lamb
[13:20] goes and takes the book out of the hand
[13:21] of him that sat upon the throne
[13:23] and and was took and opened the seals
[13:26] and
[13:26] opened the book what book
[13:30] the book of redemption brother branham
[13:32] said your bible is a book of redemption
[13:34] when he opened the seals he opened the
[13:36] book and that's why brother benham said
[13:38] my bible has become
[13:40] a new book to me hallelujah
[13:46] so now he tore the seals off and he
[13:49] opened the book
[13:52] you see the book actually was planned
[13:54] and written before
[13:55] the foundation of the world this book
[13:58] the bible was really written before the
[14:00] foundation of the world
[14:02] and christ being the lamb was slain
[14:04] before the foundation of the world
[14:06] and the members of his bride their names
[14:08] were put in the lamb's book of life
[14:09] before the foundation of the world
[14:12] but it's been sealed up and now it's
[14:14] being revealed whose names were in there
[14:16] all about it
[14:18] what a great thing hallelujah
[14:21] so so this was written before the
[14:23] foundation of the world
[14:25] this was written before you had done
[14:27] good or evil
[14:29] before your great great great great
[14:31] grandfather your great great great great
[14:33] grandmother was ever on this earth
[14:34] before you ever did anything right or
[14:37] wrong
[14:38] before you made any choice at all this
[14:40] book was already written
[14:42] the bible was finished before the
[14:43] foundation of the world the the sixth
[14:45] scroll
[14:46] document of the book of redemption was
[14:48] already sealed up
[14:49] before before there was one molecule one
[14:52] atom before anything ever happened it
[14:54] was already done
[14:57] you and i aren't going to change what's
[14:59] written in that book
[15:02] it doesn't matter what the devil tries
[15:03] to tell you how much he tries to cause
[15:06] you to
[15:06] to be disrupted in your mind or or fall
[15:09] or
[15:09] fall lay a trap for you and you fall
[15:11] into it and try to tell you
[15:12] it was never for you it doesn't matter
[15:14] what he says it doesn't even so much
[15:16] matter what you do
[15:18] all that matters is what was written and
[15:20] recorded before the foundation of the
[15:22] world
[15:22] and that's what he's revealing now
[15:25] how's he doing it he's revealing the
[15:27] names that were in this book
[15:29] and he says how does he reveal him he
[15:31] reveals the mysteries
[15:33] that's calling the name
[15:36] and when you hear the mysteries revealed
[15:38] and it resonates in you he's
[15:40] calling your name not an intellectual
[15:43] understanding not being able to read
[15:45] through it but when he begins to
[15:47] break it down it becomes real to you it
[15:49] becomes personal to you
[15:51] and you find your identification here in
[15:53] the message
[15:54] then he's calling to you that means your
[15:57] name was written there before the
[15:59] foundation of the world
[16:03] what a great thing isaiah 46
[16:07] verse 9 remember the former things of
[16:09] old for i am god and there is none else
[16:12] i am god and there is none like me
[16:14] declaring the end from the beginning and
[16:17] from ancient times the things that are
[16:19] not yet
[16:19] done saying my counsel shall stand and i
[16:22] will do
[16:23] all my pleasure i'm glad
[16:26] it was his pleasure to redeem me i'm
[16:29] glad it was his pleasure to call me and
[16:31] justify me
[16:32] call me out and choose me and glorify me
[16:35] because i'm already in a glorified
[16:37] condition
[16:39] because the word says so i'm not waiting
[16:42] i'm already glorified i'm just dropped
[16:45] down into this brother venom said this
[16:47] little hickey called time
[16:48] to measure out some things to accomplish
[16:50] something god's want to accomplish
[16:52] but if you get out of this hickey and
[16:53] get back into eternity i am
[16:55] already there glorified
[16:59] that's what the word says he says this
[17:02] here
[17:02] is just a negative reflecting the
[17:04] positive amen when he said the life you
[17:06] live here is just reflecting another
[17:07] life that's over there
[17:10] praise the lord he already has it all
[17:13] mapped out
[17:14] brothers and sisters and he's giving us
[17:16] his word
[17:17] to reveal who we are
[17:21] so we find out that there were two vines
[17:24] the war
[17:25] started in heaven and then came down to
[17:28] earth
[17:29] the second vine started in heaven it
[17:32] didn't start in the garden of eden
[17:34] amen the cane line actually did not
[17:37] start in the garden of eden it
[17:39] started in heaven when the falling away
[17:41] amen
[17:43] it's amazing that that we live in a day
[17:46] where we can see these things where
[17:49] there's been a prophet on the scene and
[17:51] a prophet doesn't just
[17:53] take the word and study it like a
[17:55] theologian studies it
[17:56] he takes the word and god begins to
[17:58] break visions and he starts to see it
[17:59] connected and interlaced
[18:01] and when he comes and he brings you the
[18:03] meaning of this word
[18:04] he brings it from the back part of god's
[18:06] mind
[18:08] he doesn't bring it from his mind he
[18:10] brings it from god's mind
[18:12] and that's why we don't want to trust
[18:13] intellectual study
[18:15] we don't even want to trust our own
[18:16] study in our own mind that means
[18:18] every time we come to this word and
[18:20] study this word we check it with the
[18:22] message
[18:22] why do we check it with the message
[18:24] because i don't want my mind i want the
[18:26] mind of god
[18:29] hallelujah i want to know what god
[18:33] thought about this bible verse i'm not
[18:34] so interested in what matthew henry said
[18:38] because matthew henry could be right 80
[18:40] of the time
[18:41] he might be right 20 of the time and i'm
[18:43] not going to use my intellect to decide
[18:45] where he's white right and where he's
[18:47] wrong
[18:47] i'm going to take what came from the
[18:49] mind of god through a prophet because a
[18:51] prophet is
[18:52] just he is just a microphone
[18:56] and it's the spirit of god speaking
[18:59] through that microphone
[19:00] and i'm going to take that for the
[19:03] correct
[19:03] and perfect interpretation of the word
[19:08] anything besides that would lead you
[19:10] down the wrong path
[19:12] matthew henry was a wonderful man
[19:14] clarence larkin was a wonderful man
[19:15] uriah smith was a wonderful man
[19:17] mother venom talked about those and the
[19:19] contribution they made said many men
[19:21] probed at these things
[19:22] some of them did a pretty good job but
[19:24] nobody got it a hundred percent right
[19:28] so i'm not going to spend my time with
[19:30] something that's not a hundred percent
[19:32] accurate
[19:33] but i'm going to spend my time with that
[19:36] that was delivered by the mind of god
[19:38] through a prophetic ministry
[19:40] given to us in the last day to bring us
[19:42] into that full understanding
[19:44] so that we can be rapture ready pure
[19:46] white lily white washed by the water of
[19:49] the word
[19:49] and standing ready for the rapture we're
[19:52] a privileged people we're a blessed
[19:54] people
[19:55] we're the most blessed people that have
[19:56] ever walked the face of this earth
[19:58] i'd be rather be standing here now i'd
[20:00] rather be here now this moment
[20:02] than be walking with abraham
[20:06] because abraham was looking for a city
[20:08] amen
[20:09] whose builder and maker was god and
[20:11] we're part of that city and we're seeing
[20:13] the city begin to materialize
[20:16] we're going to be the ones who slip from
[20:18] this dimension to that
[20:21] hallelujah prophet of god says in the
[20:25] fourth seal look what this is all coming
[20:26] to what is it
[20:27] it's going right back the way it did it
[20:29] started in heaven it's coming to the end
[20:31] time battle
[20:32] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[20:34] lucifer was kicked out and come to the
[20:36] earth
[20:37] then he polluted eden then he's been
[20:39] polluting ever since
[20:40] and now from the battle in heaven it's
[20:42] come to the battle on earth
[20:44] and it is to be finished on earth at the
[20:46] time in the battle
[20:47] called armageddon now anyone knows that
[20:49] the battle started in heaven
[20:51] so they kicked them out michael and his
[20:53] angels overthrew them just run out
[20:55] and when they did dropped right down in
[20:57] eden and here started the battle down
[20:59] here
[21:00] god had his children are fortified up by
[21:02] his word and eve stuck her neck out said
[21:05] i believe you're right
[21:06] maybe and there it went and it's been
[21:09] ever since
[21:10] so what caused what caused the fall in
[21:13] the garden of eden
[21:15] it was unbelief or disbelief of god's
[21:18] word
[21:20] eve's sin was not adultery that was the
[21:23] attribute of sin
[21:24] but sin was unbelief and brother bam
[21:28] starts talking about
[21:29] how satan had had taken his tail and
[21:32] gathered a third of the angels
[21:33] brother brandon said not his physical
[21:35] tale but the tale that he told
[21:39] amen the lie that he weaved together
[21:41] what was it he brought them to unbelief
[21:44] in the word of god
[21:45] so the same thing that happened in
[21:47] heaven happened in eden
[21:48] is the same thing that's happening today
[21:52] it's the same thing again and again and
[21:54] again it just keeps rolling down and
[21:56] unfolding
[21:56] and the further it goes the more it
[21:58] unfolds and the more it unfolds and the
[22:00] more it unfolds
[22:01] and every time you see the cycle of
[22:03] redemption repeating
[22:04] it's more clear and more clear
[22:07] and more clear hallelujah
[22:11] this is not a news story friends this is
[22:13] the old story
[22:15] being told over and over and over and
[22:17] over again
[22:18] hallelujah brother branham said
[22:21] something that's very interesting in the
[22:23] seals
[22:23] i just feel to go into it but i'm not
[22:25] prepared i don't have notes on it
[22:27] i i'm just going to go off the cuff but
[22:30] you can find this
[22:31] in the seals i can't remember even which
[22:33] one but just read it it's all good
[22:35] you'll find something but brother
[22:38] branham said
[22:39] when when the woman first fell when she
[22:41] fell
[22:42] uh by disbelieving the word then the
[22:44] promise was
[22:46] that the word would come again her seed
[22:48] which would be the manifested word and
[22:50] flash
[22:50] would come again and reverse what was
[22:52] done wrong
[22:54] and so now there's a prophecy that says
[22:58] thy seed shall bruise his head and that
[23:00] seed was going to be
[23:01] a physical creation of god it was going
[23:03] to be god in human flesh
[23:05] and that was the seed of the woman and
[23:07] that seed was the word
[23:09] made manifest and when the word comes
[23:11] full fully into manifest
[23:13] it was to bring redemption amen
[23:16] so that's what they were looking for
[23:17] from that promise and he said he built
[23:19] it through the patriarchs he built it
[23:21] through the
[23:22] kings he built it through the prophets
[23:23] and the psalms he built it all the way
[23:25] till finally the head came
[23:27] and jesus christ the man was standing
[23:29] there the word
[23:30] he said but when he came they rejected
[23:33] the word
[23:33] and stuck with the substitutes
[23:37] because while he was building back to
[23:39] the full measure of the word
[23:40] he allowed a substitute offering to take
[23:43] the place
[23:44] so that you could have a goat or an ox
[23:46] or a lamb or turtle doves or something
[23:49] take the place for your sin and that
[23:51] innocent blood being shed for you
[23:53] god would allow that as a substitute for
[23:55] you that but it's supposed to bring you
[23:58] into the full word when the lamb of god
[24:01] would come
[24:03] but when the lamb of god came they
[24:05] rejected the seed of the woman
[24:07] because they wanted their substitute
[24:09] religion they got used to it
[24:11] they got tied down to their own carnal
[24:13] understanding of
[24:14] what was happening in the law and they
[24:16] wanted it and they didn't want him
[24:22] and so the lamb was slain and and then
[24:25] those who held true to the word and
[24:27] never deviated from the revelation for
[24:29] their day
[24:29] they were redeemed they were resurrected
[24:31] they were caught up with him into heaven
[24:33] and then he starts to cycle over again
[24:36] now he's going to deal with the gentiles
[24:38] this is all according to his plan
[24:40] but he said brother bam said then
[24:41] there's another promise amen
[24:43] there's another promise and that promise
[24:45] is the word would come back again
[24:49] he told the woman i see that was a
[24:50] promise of the word amen coming back
[24:53] but when when when the pentecostal
[24:55] church began to fall
[24:56] there was a promise of the word coming
[24:58] back again
[24:59] and he said now at the opening of the
[25:01] seals amen
[25:02] he's come back in full measure of his
[25:05] word what is it
[25:06] it's the word that has come back
[25:09] it was the word that was made flesh in
[25:12] jesus christ and they rejected the word
[25:14] and took the substitutes
[25:15] and now while he's building this this
[25:18] next
[25:18] masterpiece the bride tree while he's
[25:21] been working on that he's allowed a
[25:22] substitute of denominationalism
[25:25] he's worked with it and he's worked in
[25:27] it and he's had a covering for blood for
[25:29] those that were genuine
[25:30] and real and held to the truth and he's
[25:32] allowed the substitute religion of
[25:34] denominationalism
[25:35] but now with the opening of the seals
[25:37] when the word comes back again
[25:39] now they wanted the denominationalism
[25:42] the substitute they didn't want him
[25:46] the cycle keeps repeating over and over
[25:48] and over again
[25:49] and now there's no salvation in the
[25:51] nominational system amen
[25:53] there is this just as much as when jesus
[25:55] came amen there was no longer salvation
[25:58] in the blood of bulls and goats anymore
[26:00] but after he came it was a
[26:02] dispensational change
[26:04] brother branham said john the baptist
[26:06] was there standing between two
[26:08] dispensations
[26:10] the old dispensation of the law and the
[26:12] new dispensation of grace
[26:14] and brother branham comes he's another
[26:16] john the baptist he's another forerunner
[26:18] he comes and he's standing between two
[26:21] dispensations
[26:22] the old dispensation of the church
[26:24] system and the new dispensation of the
[26:26] word
[26:27] and the word only
[26:30] just like john the baptist bridged the
[26:32] gap brother branham bridged the gap
[26:34] and the true seed crossed and went over
[26:36] into the pure word
[26:39] but the false vine stayed with the
[26:41] denominational system
[26:44] because when he came they didn't want
[26:46] him
[26:47] they fell in love with the system
[26:51] and if you had known moses you would
[26:53] know me
[26:54] if you had known the church age
[26:56] messenger you would know me if you had
[26:57] known the true revelation coming down
[26:59] through each age you would know me
[27:01] but they fell in love with the system
[27:04] they built and didn't love the word
[27:08] hallelujah you see the cycle friends
[27:12] keeps repeating over and over and over
[27:14] again
[27:17] so this is war and the seals reveal the
[27:20] battle plan
[27:22] this book there's two stories that run
[27:26] through the theme of this book
[27:28] there's two stories there's a love story
[27:32] for god and his elect seed and there's a
[27:36] war story
[27:37] between the false vine and the true vine
[27:40] and this book is the record of those two
[27:42] stories
[27:43] that are going on simultaneously why is
[27:46] it that every movie that's successful
[27:47] and every book that's successful does
[27:49] the same thing
[27:50] they intertwine a story of war and
[27:52] battle with a love story
[27:54] they're following the pattern if you
[27:57] want to be successful follow the pattern
[27:59] that will always sell tickets that will
[28:01] always be successful
[28:02] because when you take a love story of
[28:04] redemption and getting the
[28:06] the poor humble woman who's been
[28:08] destitute and neglected and forsaken
[28:10] and the king comes in and he rescues her
[28:12] and he fights off the enemy
[28:14] and evil's defeated and good wins
[28:16] that'll always sell tickets in the box
[28:18] office
[28:19] why because the knowledge of that is
[28:21] locked in the human heart
[28:22] because that's the original story
[28:26] now hollywood's making money by
[28:28] perverting the original story
[28:30] but there's two stories running through
[28:32] that a love story
[28:33] amen is running through that the story
[28:35] of redemption of the loved one of god
[28:38] and the story of war the battle between
[28:40] false vine
[28:41] and the true vine so he comes out first
[28:45] as a white horse rider in the first seal
[28:48] and he has a bow but no arrows he
[28:50] receives a crown
[28:51] and he comes forth to conquer let's read
[28:54] that in revelations chapter 6
[28:56] keep revelation chapter 6 open for a few
[28:58] minutes i'm trying so bad to hurry
[29:02] i really want to get through the third
[29:03] seal but if not we'll pick it up
[29:04] wednesday
[29:10] revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and i saw
[29:13] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[29:15] and i heard as it were the noise of
[29:16] thunder
[29:17] one of the four beasts saying come and
[29:19] see and i saw him behold a white horse
[29:21] and he that sat on him had a bow
[29:23] and a crown was given unto him and he
[29:25] went forth conquering
[29:27] and to conquer so the purpose of the
[29:30] white horse rider is
[29:31] to conquer
[29:34] but he comes with a bow with no arrows
[29:37] and he doesn't have a crown
[29:40] how's he going to conquer he can only
[29:42] conquer through deception not by force
[29:45] he's come seemingly innocent brother
[29:47] brenham said he seems to be innocent
[29:50] because he he can't hurt you right he
[29:52] has no authority over you doesn't have a
[29:53] crown
[29:54] he has no arrows he cannot do you any
[29:56] harm so he comes white just like christ
[29:58] comes on a white horse
[29:59] and this is deception brother branham
[30:01] said who is that white horse rider
[30:03] you're not blind you see who it is it's
[30:05] that antichrist that deceitful spirit
[30:07] that's gone now
[30:08] and crept in so he comes in
[30:11] he comes in innocent he comes in
[30:14] harmless
[30:14] he comes in with no authority but the
[30:17] purpose that he comes is to conquer
[30:20] that's the deceptive part of it because
[30:22] it looks like it can't hurt you
[30:24] it looks like this little compromise
[30:26] can't be hurtful can't be painful
[30:28] since the white horse rider went out
[30:30] he's mighty
[30:31] in his conquering power you want me to
[30:34] tell you who he is
[30:35] he's the antichrist that's exactly what
[30:37] he is now because you see
[30:39] jesus said that the two would be so
[30:41] close together until it would deceive
[30:42] the very elect the bride
[30:44] if it was possible antichrist is the
[30:46] antichrist spirit
[30:48] so now he comes as the antichrist but
[30:50] he's coming
[30:51] so close to deceive the elect if it was
[30:54] possible
[30:55] not a million miles away but so close
[30:58] that it would deceive you and i
[31:00] if it was possible so when we're
[31:02] watching for this white horse i gotta
[31:04] we've been through this but i just can't
[31:05] stress it enough we're not looking for
[31:07] the white horse out there in the world
[31:10] we're not trying to be wary that we
[31:12] don't go uh we don't go to the movie
[31:14] theaters and we don't go down to the bar
[31:16] that's not where the white horse is
[31:18] working because that's not deception for
[31:20] the bride
[31:21] he's not deceiving you with alcohol
[31:23] drugs prostitution gambling
[31:25] that's not the deception there's no
[31:26] deception there but the deception is on
[31:29] a white horse amen
[31:30] purity righteousness just a slight
[31:33] deviation from the word just something
[31:35] slightly different than the scriptures
[31:37] just something slightly different than
[31:38] the message
[31:41] that's the only way that he could
[31:42] deceive the bride if it were possible
[31:45] it's got to be that close why because
[31:47] he's vying for the same throne that
[31:49] god's on
[31:51] you got to realize the the lucifer when
[31:54] the war broke out in heaven
[31:56] lucifer wasn't looking for his own
[31:58] throne
[32:00] he wasn't trying to build a kingdom amen
[32:02] he was trying to
[32:03] take the kingdom we've got that
[32:08] so he's not trying to build a serpent
[32:10] kingdom or a cain kingdom
[32:12] he has no interest in those things amen
[32:14] he is trying
[32:15] to usurp god's throne he's trying to
[32:18] take god's kingdom
[32:21] and where is god's throne it's in the
[32:24] human heart
[32:25] of those that are redeemed that's where
[32:27] he's trying to place his seat
[32:29] that's where he's trying to sit as a
[32:31] king he's trying to come on god's throne
[32:34] which is in the bride so where is the
[32:37] white horse going to ride
[32:38] he's going to try to ride in the bride
[32:42] that's why it comes back to judging your
[32:44] own life
[32:46] where was the deception back in the
[32:48] church ages when the white horse began
[32:50] to rise
[32:50] it came right into the true church
[32:54] it came right into that church that paul
[32:56] had established
[32:57] where he had written epistles amen all
[32:59] the way to all of these churches
[33:01] it was that church that he came in and
[33:04] that's where he began to conquer and
[33:05] begin his deception
[33:07] he didn't come through paganism amen he
[33:09] didn't come through
[33:10] through false false religions he didn't
[33:12] come the white horse when he came
[33:14] he came into the true church that paul
[33:17] established
[33:20] if he's going to come today where is he
[33:22] going to come
[33:23] he's not going to come to pentecostalism
[33:25] or the baptist he's going to come
[33:28] amen to the true church that was
[33:29] reestablished on paul's teaching
[33:33] that's where he's going to try to come
[33:34] in our day that's why we've got to
[33:36] constantly watching for him
[33:38] it's easy to stop the white horse
[33:42] easy to stop the white horse because he
[33:44] has no crown
[33:46] he has no authority over you and he has
[33:48] no arrows he can do nothing to you
[33:50] all you have to say is boo back
[33:53] resist the devil and he shall flee with
[33:55] you how do you resist him with the pure
[33:56] word
[33:57] amen with the restored faith of the
[33:59] fathers with the teaching back to what
[34:01] the apostles taught
[34:02] and just preach the word and he has to
[34:05] flee
[34:07] he's easy to stop as a white horse it's
[34:10] harder later
[34:14] white horses compromise slight change of
[34:16] the word
[34:18] deception
[34:24] now what was he given then first he had
[34:26] a bow but he didn't have any arrows but
[34:28] now he's got a mighty sword in his hand
[34:30] he can do something now then he jumps
[34:32] off his white horse
[34:34] the white horse rides on out
[34:37] now this is very important we realize
[34:39] this and just in case you thought that
[34:42] that that we were hijacking what was
[34:44] meant for the church ages
[34:46] the white horse we know that there was a
[34:49] there there was a time that brother
[34:50] branham takes these four horse riders
[34:52] and he lays them over the church ages
[34:54] and he shows us it rode here and it rode
[34:56] there and it changed
[34:57] and it's the same writer all the time
[34:59] just changing his power
[35:00] or changing his tactic or method of
[35:02] operation and so the antichrist gets off
[35:05] a white horse and gets on a red
[35:06] gets off a red and gets on a black gets
[35:08] off a black and gets off a pail
[35:10] but when he gets off the white and gets
[35:12] on the red the white horse rides on
[35:14] out it doesn't stop riding friends he's
[35:17] still
[35:17] using that power to deceive it's still
[35:20] coming in through the church ages
[35:21] that doesn't stop just because now he
[35:25] moved through the church ages
[35:27] that white horse rides on out it's
[35:30] riding today
[35:34] but god sent the lion to combat that
[35:36] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[35:38] lord will raise the standard against it
[35:39] and he raised the lion which was the
[35:41] pure word which is christ is the
[35:43] teachings of paul
[35:44] amen when they roared out like a lion
[35:46] and when they just took the word
[35:48] amen nothing could stand against that
[35:50] word
[35:52] i'm going to try to just move quickly
[35:54] we've been through this in detail
[35:55] the red horse you find that in
[35:58] revelation
[35:59] chapter 6 verse 3 when he had opened the
[36:02] second seal i heard the second beast say
[36:04] come and see
[36:05] and there went out another horse that
[36:07] was red and power was given to him
[36:09] that sat there on to take peace from the
[36:10] earth and that they should kill one
[36:12] another and there was given unto him
[36:14] a great sword the red horse takes peace
[36:18] causes war and killing and brother
[36:21] branham says in several places
[36:22] starts a political war
[36:26] in the church
[36:29] has anybody ever seen that starts a
[36:32] political war
[36:34] in the church amen
[36:37] he's going to try where is he coming to
[36:40] the church
[36:42] not the false behind the true vine and
[36:45] he brings
[36:46] political war in the church
[36:49] starts to divide brethren against
[36:52] brethren and so they start to take the
[36:54] sword and fight one another
[36:55] it's not supposed to be that way
[36:58] the second seal he says now notice that
[37:01] they should kill one another
[37:03] they should kill each other his bow had
[37:05] no arrows at first but his great sword
[37:07] did he done his killing later
[37:09] and changed from white horse to red
[37:11] horse the same exactly devil with the
[37:13] sword
[37:14] what did jesus say they that take the
[37:16] sword will perish by it don't
[37:18] fight back jesus that night
[37:22] he said that and peter took his sword
[37:24] and just do like he did just go ahead
[37:27] now now remember he's got a sword he's
[37:30] going forth a sword in his hand
[37:32] riding red horse wading through the
[37:34] blood of everybody that disagrees with
[37:37] him
[37:38] how many times have you killed somebody
[37:40] because they disagreed with you
[37:44] amen how many times because they didn't
[37:47] follow the doctrine you followed or
[37:48] see it the way you saw it or didn't
[37:51] believe in the standard you believed in
[37:53] how many times
[37:54] did you take the sword and kill your
[37:56] brother
[37:58] hallelujah this is coming right
[38:02] here not looking out there i'm looking
[38:05] right
[38:05] here for the for the devil the battle
[38:08] is right here remember there's two vines
[38:12] that that coming from the from the from
[38:14] the battle in heaven
[38:15] all the way through to be destroyed in
[38:17] the end of the book of revelations
[38:18] and those battles are entered those
[38:20] vines are intertwined
[38:23] and they're intertwined in you and i
[38:26] with the outside man and the inside man
[38:29] you don't have to look very far amen you
[38:31] don't have to look very far to find
[38:32] trouble in the church you can find it
[38:34] right here
[38:35] that's the man that has to be killed
[38:37] that's why paul say i die daily
[38:39] he's trying to keep that man dead
[38:42] because that's where satan's trying to
[38:43] come in and work amen
[38:46] he's got a sword he's going forth with a
[38:48] sword in his hand riding a red horse
[38:50] wading through the blood of
[38:51] everybody that disagrees with him now do
[38:54] you understand it
[38:54] how many understands what the seal is
[38:56] now
[38:58] all right what did jesus say they that
[39:00] take the sword will perish by the sword
[39:02] is that right
[39:03] so how many understands now how many
[39:05] understands
[39:06] what the seal is now don't fight back
[39:13] so there's an anointing that comes to
[39:14] combat this is war
[39:16] combat so the anointing that comes to
[39:18] combat this is the ox anointing
[39:22] and the ox anointing is a burden-bearing
[39:24] beast
[39:25] he bears down under the load and he's a
[39:28] beast of sacrifice
[39:30] now i want you to notice he doesn't
[39:32] fight back
[39:33] you can put more on him and more on him
[39:35] and more on him and he'll just bear the
[39:36] load and bear the load and bear the load
[39:38] and you can even come and make him a
[39:40] sacrifice upon your altar and he'll lay
[39:42] down his life willingly
[39:44] but there's one thing about the ox the
[39:46] ox is
[39:47] very strong
[39:50] you will not get the ox to compromise
[39:55] he won't give in for peace he won't give
[39:59] in
[39:59] for peace he won't give in
[40:03] and because he won't give in he won't
[40:05] have peace
[40:08] because you can compromise and give in
[40:09] to have peace but the ox doesn't
[40:12] compromise
[40:12] the ox is strong enough to stay with his
[40:15] commitment to the word
[40:16] no matter what you do to me no matter
[40:18] how much you pile on me
[40:19] whether or not you kill me i will not
[40:22] change
[40:22] from the my confession in the word
[40:26] the ox is strong enough to take it
[40:30] brother madam said now the second beast
[40:33] that the antichrist sent out was a red
[40:34] beast
[40:35] which he rode on was to take peace from
[40:37] the earth in war now the second one that
[40:39] went to combat him was the
[40:40] ox beast the ox means labor a beast of
[40:42] burden
[40:43] and another thing the ox is also a beast
[40:45] of sacrifice
[40:47] they give their lives just as freely as
[40:49] they could give them
[40:51] in the dark ages a thousand years there
[40:54] the catholicism controlled the world and
[40:56] they just went right in yes or no
[40:58] they didn't mind dying if it was death
[41:01] that's all right they went and died
[41:04] anyhow
[41:08] if to stand on the word of god
[41:11] if it means somebody will attack your
[41:14] character
[41:14] if it means somebody will speak evil
[41:16] against you if it means somebody
[41:18] will go around the church and start
[41:20] gathering allies together
[41:21] to wage a war against you because they
[41:23] disagree with what you're saying
[41:24] they disagree with your stand then you
[41:26] don't fight back
[41:28] because you can give your life just as
[41:30] freely and willingly
[41:32] what are you giving it for you're giving
[41:33] it for the word
[41:36] hallelujah you just give up your life
[41:39] it doesn't matter don't compromise but
[41:42] just give up your life
[41:46] we're going to show this we're going to
[41:48] show this
[41:49] in the life of jesus christ here shortly
[41:52] so all three of these
[41:54] beasts the black horse
[41:57] this is the third seal we're finally
[41:58] coming to now
[42:00] when he had opened the third seal i
[42:02] heard the third beast say come and see
[42:04] and i beheld and lo a black horse and he
[42:06] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[42:08] in his hand
[42:09] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[42:10] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[42:12] penny
[42:13] and three measures of barley for a penny
[42:15] and see thou heard not the oil
[42:17] and the wine
[42:21] brother branham says right at the
[42:23] beginning of the seals write in this
[42:24] opening prayer
[42:26] he says in this great hour that we're
[42:28] now living and we see yearly
[42:30] it gets darker and darker to the world
[42:35] and the coming of the lord gets brighter
[42:37] and brighter as he reveals himself
[42:39] in his word and in his manifestation
[42:42] that right there is the third seal
[42:45] so lock in on that that's the third seal
[42:49] he says it right in his opening comments
[42:51] it's so miraculous how many times right
[42:53] in his opening comments right is closing
[42:55] he tells you what the whole seal means
[42:56] to you the word
[42:58] the hour that we're living in is getting
[43:00] darker and darker
[43:02] to the world but the coming of the lord
[43:04] gets brighter
[43:06] and brighter as he reveals himself now
[43:09] we'll study this as we go and you'll see
[43:10] how true that statement
[43:12] is the sixth seal he says
[43:15] perfect just exactly oh i like to make
[43:17] the scripture answer itself don't you
[43:19] the holy spirit wrote it all but he's
[43:21] able to reveal it now let's notice
[43:24] the third seal now this is famine
[43:28] and he takes that out of matthew 24 when
[43:30] they ask him when what shall be the sign
[43:31] of the end and when shall these things
[43:33] come to pass and he starts to break down
[43:34] the seals in matthew 24
[43:36] and when he gets to the third seal he
[43:37] says they'll be famine
[43:39] and brother branham picks that out of
[43:40] there and says see now
[43:42] this is famine amos
[43:46] 8 11 says behold the days come saith the
[43:48] lord god that i will send a famine in
[43:50] the land
[43:51] not a famine of bread nor a thirst of
[43:53] water but of hearing
[43:54] the words of the lord i want you to take
[43:56] special note because this is going to
[43:57] become important as we study this
[44:00] it says in amos there's going to come a
[44:03] famine in the land
[44:05] not a famine of bread nor thirst for
[44:07] water but of hearing the words of the
[44:09] lord
[44:10] so this is a terrible famine a famine
[44:12] where you don't get
[44:13] hungry because you don't have food to
[44:15] eat a famine be where you
[44:17] spiritually wither away because you
[44:20] don't have
[44:20] the word you don't have the hearing of
[44:24] the word
[44:25] so spiritually you wither away in the
[44:27] spiritual
[44:28] famine but i want you to take special
[44:30] note who
[44:32] sent the famine
[44:36] is really important behold the days come
[44:38] saith the lord god that
[44:40] i will send a famine
[44:43] in the land remember when he starts
[44:47] talking about
[44:48] in the palmer worm the kangaroo and the
[44:51] caterpillar and the locust
[44:53] and i mean i have those in order but
[44:55] that's i think that's the right for
[44:57] so he starts talking about them and how
[44:59] they're going to go down and eat this
[45:01] down and how he's going to restore all
[45:02] that they ate but when he refers to them
[45:05] he says the palmer and the kangaroo and
[45:07] the caterpillar locust mine
[45:09] great army that i send
[45:14] don't think god's not in control of all
[45:16] of this don't think he doesn't have the
[45:17] whole thing in his hand
[45:18] when he had to deceive ahab to go up
[45:20] into battle to make his word work
[45:22] he sent a lying spirit
[45:25] don't forget he asked god asked who will
[45:28] go
[45:28] amen who will go and deceive them that
[45:31] they come up amen and unlying spirit
[45:33] said
[45:33] micaiah he unveiled the whole thing he
[45:36] said
[45:37] god sent a lying spirit
[45:40] who sent the famine i send the famine
[45:45] we can't we can't think as redeemed
[45:48] children of god
[45:49] that the devil has anything to do with
[45:50] this we can't think that he's
[45:52] controlling the situations that are
[45:54] going on in our lives
[45:55] that somehow if there's a if there's
[45:57] four that there's four critters that are
[45:59] going to eat the bride tree down to
[46:00] nothing
[46:01] those four things were sent by god to
[46:04] eat it down to nothing
[46:05] that wasn't the devil's work that was
[46:07] god's will
[46:08] [Music]
[46:09] and there's going to come a famine in
[46:10] the land where there's going to be a
[46:11] want for hearing the word of god
[46:13] it wasn't because the devil brought a
[46:14] famine in the land god sent a famine in
[46:17] the land
[46:20] this is revealed this is revealed in
[46:23] this seal let's go back to revelations
[46:25] chapter 6
[46:27] verse 5. i'm going to get a little head
[46:30] of schedule but
[46:31] but just bear with me and when he had
[46:35] opened the third seal
[46:36] verse 5 chapter 6 i heard the third
[46:38] beast say come and see and behold a low
[46:40] a black horse and he that
[46:42] sat on him had a pair of balances in his
[46:44] hand
[46:45] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[46:47] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[46:49] penny and three measures of barley for a
[46:51] penny
[46:52] see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
[46:54] so we find out that this is going to be
[46:56] spiritual famine
[46:57] there's a balance in his hand he's
[46:59] measuring out the weed
[47:00] wheat and the barley we're going to get
[47:02] to that in a minute but notice in verse
[47:04] 6
[47:04] i heard a voice in the midst of the four
[47:08] beasts
[47:10] this is the work of the devil with the
[47:12] the with the balance in his hand
[47:14] it's the work of the devil to measure
[47:15] out wheat for a penny barley for a penny
[47:18] it's the work of the devil but it's the
[47:20] it's a voice from the middle of the four
[47:22] beasts that say
[47:24] you can measure out you can measure out
[47:27] wheat for a penny and barley for a penny
[47:29] but don't touch the oil and wine and
[47:32] brother brennaman the seal says
[47:33] that was the lamb that cried out from
[47:35] the midst of the four beasts
[47:37] the lamb said so who's in control
[47:40] of this famine who's in control of the
[47:43] dark ages
[47:44] who's in control of the black horse
[47:49] what a revelations laying right here in
[47:51] the seals that god has
[47:53] everything under control it's all
[47:55] working according to his plan
[47:57] nothing's out of kilter everything's
[47:59] ticking just right on time
[48:01] there's nothing happens in the life of a
[48:03] believer but first it has to come across
[48:05] god's desk for approval it was
[48:08] it was god who suggested job to the
[48:11] devil to be tempted
[48:12] it was god who set the limits of his
[48:14] temptation it was god who moved back the
[48:16] barriers every time satan came
[48:18] satan couldn't do anything without
[48:20] permission
[48:23] and that's revealed in the seal who's
[48:26] controlling the dark ages
[48:28] who's controlling the measure by which
[48:30] the catholic church can strip the world
[48:32] amen it's the lamb who's controlling it
[48:35] he's the one who says a measure of wheat
[48:37] for a penny three measures of barley for
[48:39] a penny but he also says
[48:41] see thou that thy you don't touch the
[48:43] oil
[48:44] and the wine the oil and wine wasn't
[48:47] even for sale
[48:50] comes without price they can't put a
[48:54] price on the oil and the wine
[48:57] hallelujah one of the great revelations
[49:00] under the third seal is that the lamb is
[49:01] in control
[49:03] he's absolutely in control that's why
[49:07] we get down and get depressed and get
[49:09] angry and get upset about life
[49:11] circumstances
[49:12] what i have and what i don't have and
[49:13] what's happened to me and the people
[49:15] who's mistreated
[49:16] me amen don't don't you forget that the
[49:18] holocaust was the tender hand of jehovah
[49:22] and the holocaust is the sixth seal and
[49:23] the sixth seal was meant to bring the
[49:25] 144 thousand
[49:27] back into position so that they can
[49:28] receive the christ
[49:30] the lamb the messiah the tender hand of
[49:33] jehovah would allow a holocaust
[49:36] to bring redemption back to israel
[49:39] so that they could be blessed in their
[49:41] land so that they could receive their
[49:42] two witnesses under the
[49:44] seventh trumpet so that they could come
[49:46] back
[49:47] into redemption
[49:51] you can't shake your fist and say why or
[49:53] the devil
[49:54] oh the devil was the instrument god used
[49:57] amen just like he sent nebuchadnezzar to
[49:59] destroy the temple to destroy jerusalem
[50:02] he said nebuchadnezzar my servant
[50:07] nebuchadnezzar was not satan's servant
[50:10] nebuchadnezzar was god's servant
[50:16] if you went through a holocaust in your
[50:18] life
[50:19] then the reason was he had mercy on you
[50:26] because he's driving you to your
[50:28] homeland
[50:30] he's driving you to the word brother
[50:33] branham said
[50:34] i've had this tension all my life
[50:37] i used to think this tension was a
[50:39] terrible thing you know this tension is
[50:41] what would cause his reoccurring stomach
[50:42] condition
[50:43] he suffered with it since he was a child
[50:45] he talks about it in the message on the
[50:46] wings of a snow white dove he goes in
[50:48] detail how he suffered
[50:50] and suffered and suffered so this
[50:51] tension i thought it was a bad thing
[50:53] but because i come and realize this
[50:55] tension is a good
[50:56] thing
[50:59] he said it was this tension that drove
[51:02] me to jesus christ
[51:04] and i got to thinking without this
[51:06] tension where would i be
[51:09] see friends nothing's out of kilter with
[51:10] god if you were neglected if you were
[51:13] abused if you were mistreated if people
[51:15] lied about you
[51:16] and told wrong about you if you lost
[51:18] jobs and went into bankruptcy and all of
[51:20] these things that happen
[51:22] god works it all to bring you here down
[51:25] you're here now hearing the word of god
[51:27] by his
[51:28] tender hand that has driven you to this
[51:30] place what would have happened if
[51:32] everything would have been easy
[51:33] there had been no trial that you would
[51:34] never have come into desperation because
[51:36] you needed god
[51:37] where would you be now you have no idea
[51:41] we always think oh if life would just be
[51:43] easy and everything would work out i
[51:45] would serve god with all my heart no you
[51:48] wouldn't
[51:51] proverbs says he says give me neither
[51:53] riches nor poverty
[51:55] because i might be rich and i might
[51:57] forget you or i might be poor and steal
[51:59] and blaspheme your name give me neither
[52:01] riches nor poverty but keep me somewhere
[52:03] in the middle
[52:04] i don't want to fall either way you
[52:06] think rich's riches wouldn't do you one
[52:08] ounce of good.
[52:10] unless he's gifted you to take care of
[52:12] it riches wouldn't do you one bit of
[52:14] good
[52:15] what you need is exactly what you've had
[52:20] those things that you wonder about in
[52:22] your life why did this happen
[52:24] why did i lose this family member why
[52:26] did this circumstance happen
[52:28] why couldn't that have been prevented it
[52:30] was needful to bring you here
[52:34] and if you like where you're at thank
[52:36] god for the trials
[52:38] there's going to come a time that 144
[52:41] 000 are going to be awakened to what god
[52:42] had been doing
[52:43] the trumpets are going to reveal to them
[52:45] what the seals revealed to us
[52:47] and the seals revealed to us the plan of
[52:48] redemption what god's been doing through
[52:50] all these church ages
[52:51] to bring us here to reveal himself to us
[52:53] and the trumpets are going to be
[52:54] those two prophets in revelations 11 are
[52:57] going to teach them what's been
[52:58] happening all down through
[53:00] to bring them to the land to bring them
[53:02] to the feast of atonement to bring them
[53:04] to messiah
[53:04] and they're going to look back and say
[53:06] thank god
[53:11] amen that would end the need for a whole
[53:14] bunch of counseling if we would just
[53:15] look back on our life and thank god
[53:18] thank you god whatever i needed you did
[53:20] if i needed spank there corrected there
[53:22] whatever i needed if i was going the
[53:24] wrong way and you had to
[53:25] flatten me to bring me back over here i
[53:28] say thank you lord
[53:29] you know what's best you know what i
[53:31] needed there was no time in my life that
[53:33] i was not a redeemed son of god
[53:37] why because the book was sealed before
[53:39] the foundation of the world there was
[53:40] never a question of whether or not you
[53:42] would be redeemed you were always a
[53:43] redeemed son of god
[53:46] you just had to come to the revelation
[53:48] of it at some point
[53:49] and the seed in you had to be quickened
[53:51] to life but the seed was already there
[53:55] that seed was there before the book was
[53:57] written
[53:59] not in your tabernacle of flesh but in
[54:01] god
[54:03] and that seed come out predestinated to
[54:05] be in your tabernacle of flesh
[54:06] and that seed was already redeemed
[54:08] because that seed was never lost in the
[54:10] first place
[54:11] that's why brother branham said when you
[54:12] come back to this pure virgin word
[54:14] it brings you back to your virgin
[54:16] condition you've never sinned in the
[54:18] first place
[54:19] it drops it in the blood of the the
[54:22] blood of the clorox bleach
[54:24] and then drops into there and sends it
[54:26] right back to the originator of sin
[54:28] which is satan himself and then he'll
[54:30] stand the judgment
[54:31] for all the sin of the world
[54:35] he's going to be judged for my sin not
[54:37] me
[54:40] because my sin by confession in the
[54:42] blood and believing the word
[54:44] and receiving it for my day that takes
[54:46] my sin
[54:47] and puts it right back to the originator
[54:50] of sin which is lucifer himself
[54:53] it's not on my record it's not on me
[54:55] it's on him
[54:56] because in me me the me that's down on
[54:59] the inside the sea gene of god that's
[55:01] been quick and the life
[55:02] that me was in god before the foundation
[55:04] of the world
[55:05] and by receiving the pure word of god
[55:07] puts me back
[55:08] in my previous condition in my soul
[55:11] which is 100
[55:13] sinless
[55:16] you are just as righteous as god
[55:20] is right
[55:24] so the question is how righteous is god
[55:27] [Laughter]
[55:29] oh see what the seals mean to us friends
[55:33] it's everything we have to recognize who
[55:35] we are
[55:36] in our position and where we are if we
[55:38] just take away the whole fear of sin
[55:40] then sin loses its hold but if you're
[55:43] constantly afraid of falling and not
[55:45] being saved and not making the rapture
[55:47] then
[55:47] your mind is going to become bound with
[55:49] all these fears and you're going to fall
[55:51] right into the trap you're afraid of
[55:54] the devil is is wrapping your mind and
[55:56] fears and anxiety because
[55:58] i'm not going to make it what if i'm not
[56:00] in the right condition what if i don't
[56:01] go in the rapture
[56:02] whether you make it in the rapture or
[56:03] not was predetermined friends
[56:06] your do's and don'ts are not going to
[56:08] put you in the rapture if you're an
[56:10] attribute of god which is he calling
[56:12] back in the rapture
[56:13] he you were in him before the foundation
[56:15] of the world and that
[56:16] sinless spotless pure as righteous as
[56:18] god is righteous
[56:19] you can no more be lost and god can be
[56:21] lost
[56:25] so just put it back on lucifer and
[56:27] forget about it and walk as a redeemed
[56:29] son of god
[56:30] sanctified by the word cleansed by the
[56:32] blood forget about the do's and don'ts
[56:35] and when you set your course amen and
[56:36] your affections on things that are above
[56:38] and forget about all those things
[56:40] they're just going to fall away friends
[56:43] but if you're constantly worried about
[56:45] falling you're going to constantly be
[56:46] falling
[56:50] brother branham said that this this
[56:53] bleach of the blood of jesus christ
[56:55] will take the sins so far away from the
[56:57] believer
[56:58] back to its original source which is one
[57:00] who deceived the angels in heaven
[57:02] amen back to that original place until
[57:04] you have no more consciousness of sin
[57:12] truth is i didn't sin
[57:17] now this body that i live in that's
[57:19] controlled by a human spirit
[57:23] that thing has sinned a whole bunch
[57:26] but that seed of life down on the inside
[57:28] that's been quickened by the new birth
[57:30] that thing has never sinned once
[57:35] and he cannot sin for his seed remaineth
[57:38] in him that seed can't sin
[57:43] that body you live in it can sin all the
[57:45] time but when that seeds quicken the
[57:47] life now the life that's in that seed is
[57:49] supposed to control your body
[57:51] not your human spirit not your human
[57:53] mind but the life that's inside that
[57:55] quickened by the holy ghost that holy
[57:57] ghost life
[57:58] is supposed to control the body
[58:01] hallelujah how do i get that to happen
[58:04] get more of the word
[58:06] we're going to see that in a minute
[58:10] spiritual food and due season now we're
[58:12] going to type that with the spiritual
[58:13] drought of today
[58:15] now we all know we are very aware that
[58:17] there is a great spiritual drought in
[58:18] the land today
[58:19] spiritually speaking you know that was
[58:21] predicted by the prophets just before
[58:23] the second coming of christ would be
[58:25] said
[58:25] there will come a famine in the land and
[58:28] it won't be for bread alone but for the
[58:30] hearing
[58:30] of the word of god and that day is now
[58:33] hearing the true word of god
[58:35] now this types the natural drought with
[58:37] the spiritual drought
[58:40] and so so we'll get to a few more quotes
[58:43] here because they're really important
[58:45] the third seal i put the paragraph
[58:47] numbers in here because if you want to
[58:48] use the black
[58:51] seal book i was going to read out of
[58:53] them but so many people have so many
[58:54] different versions of the seal book
[58:56] that that half our crowd was getting
[58:57] lost so i put the paragraph number so if
[59:00] you're in the new seal book
[59:01] this is the paragraph 300. thank you
[59:04] lord oh my i'm so glad yes sir all right
[59:07] it's been his grace that's all all right
[59:09] it's a midnight time do you understand
[59:11] that now
[59:12] and here he is charging for the kind of
[59:14] life that he that's his
[59:15] that's this barley and stuff natural it
[59:18] wasn't spiritual now
[59:20] it was barley see and barley bread and
[59:22] wheat bread
[59:23] he was charging for that kind of life
[59:25] that he was giving to his subjects
[59:28] bringing the wealth of the world to
[59:31] himself
[59:33] into the church itself and he's still
[59:35] writing oh sure he is
[59:36] yes sir still riding
[59:40] so he says this this third this third
[59:43] seal this black horse he's charging
[59:46] for the the wheat and for the barley for
[59:49] the kind of
[59:49] natural life he's giving them and
[59:51] brother rams types that with
[59:53] the catholic church selling novenas and
[59:55] penances and
[59:56] and and uh services masses for purgatory
[59:59] and all of this where they started
[1:00:00] charging for this
[1:00:01] he said what's he doing he's gathering
[1:00:03] the wealth of the world into himself
[1:00:07] the prophet of god says no catholic
[1:00:09] country is self-sustaining
[1:00:11] he said because the catholic has went in
[1:00:13] there and stripped all their resources
[1:00:15] out
[1:00:16] what's he doing he's gathering all the
[1:00:18] wealth of the world
[1:00:19] why because he's going to bring back his
[1:00:21] kingdom friends
[1:00:23] and he's gathering under the black horse
[1:00:26] he's gathering
[1:00:27] all the wealth of the world he's still
[1:00:31] gathering the wealth of the world how by
[1:00:34] handing out
[1:00:35] natural food natural life
[1:00:38] natural things not spiritual things
[1:00:44] see you've got to pay for the natural
[1:00:46] things
[1:00:47] but the spiritual things come without
[1:00:49] price
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:56] he was started writing him in the time
[1:00:58] of the dark ages that's
[1:01:00] what the dark horse represents the dark
[1:01:02] ages for it was a time of midnight to
[1:01:04] the true believers
[1:01:06] that was left so we want to we want to
[1:01:09] get into here and
[1:01:10] see this black horse rider for now
[1:01:13] for ourselves the black horse rider is
[1:01:16] spiritual famine
[1:01:18] in its dark ages you see if you follow
[1:01:21] the progression through
[1:01:23] he comes in as deception a slight
[1:01:25] deviation a slight compromise
[1:01:27] something that seems to be good but is
[1:01:29] not and he comes in and slips in
[1:01:31] and after he comes in you yourself take
[1:01:33] a crown and put a crown on his head
[1:01:35] because it was the early church that
[1:01:36] crowned the
[1:01:37] crown this antichrist and you crown him
[1:01:40] and then he takes a sword
[1:01:41] and then you begin to fight for your
[1:01:43] compromise defend your actions
[1:01:45] and start war and fighting and it brings
[1:01:48] it takes away even your own peace you
[1:01:50] start even
[1:01:51] warring within yourself sometimes your
[1:01:53] battle is not even outside of yourself
[1:01:55] sometimes there's a compromise that
[1:01:56] you're living with and in your mind
[1:01:58] you're constantly reasoning and you're
[1:02:00] trying to stop the still small voice
[1:02:02] that keeps rising up to say is that
[1:02:03] exactly right
[1:02:04] is that what the prophet said and you're
[1:02:06] at war in yourself
[1:02:09] it takes your peace away there's no more
[1:02:12] peace in your heart because you're
[1:02:13] living in compromise and you know it
[1:02:17] and as he moves through from
[1:02:20] from deception coming into getting a
[1:02:22] crown to taking a sword and taking away
[1:02:25] peace
[1:02:27] then he comes to the black horse
[1:02:31] and he brings you into spiritual famine
[1:02:35] now every every false denomination every
[1:02:38] false doctrine has followed the same
[1:02:40] path
[1:02:41] all the way through you come in from
[1:02:44] deception
[1:02:45] you move into war taking away peace
[1:02:47] splitting brotherhood splitting churches
[1:02:50] all kinds of nonsense that would happen
[1:02:52] that never should be in the church of
[1:02:53] god
[1:02:54] and then it brings you into spiritual
[1:02:55] famine to where now you don't even have
[1:02:57] the spiritual life
[1:02:58] now we're living living dry all dried up
[1:03:02] and just living on a glare from a
[1:03:03] previous age no fresh manna
[1:03:05] no fresh life amen and those who have
[1:03:08] the false teaching they keep
[1:03:09] selling the same old natural bread
[1:03:13] but he said don't touch the oil and the
[1:03:15] wine
[1:03:17] so the goal is to bring you into
[1:03:19] spiritual famine
[1:03:21] because famine will bring death
[1:03:25] remember he doesn't want to stay on on
[1:03:28] on the first three horses
[1:03:30] the antichrist goal is to get to the
[1:03:33] pale horse
[1:03:34] it's been his goal from when he started
[1:03:36] when he comes to you with that little
[1:03:37] bit of compromise
[1:03:38] that that just that little bit of
[1:03:40] texting with a guy who's not a believer
[1:03:42] or flirting with a girl who's not a
[1:03:44] believer that little bit of
[1:03:45] it's innocent it's not going to hurt
[1:03:47] anything his whole purpose
[1:03:49] is to bring you from there and then you
[1:03:50] start the relationship
[1:03:52] now you put a crown on his head now
[1:03:53] you're fighting mom and dad now you're
[1:03:55] fighting other people who are warning
[1:03:57] you against this relationship
[1:03:58] now you're fighting because you're
[1:03:59] unequally yoked you're off the word and
[1:04:01] now you're fighting with people
[1:04:03] and after you fight you go into the
[1:04:04] marriage and you move along and you'll
[1:04:06] come right into spiritual famine
[1:04:09] you will move right into your spiritual
[1:04:10] dark ages amen
[1:04:12] you might have a house and a car and
[1:04:13] everything else going fine
[1:04:15] just like the world the world gets more
[1:04:16] glittery and more glittery and more
[1:04:18] glittery and getting darker
[1:04:19] and darker and darker they have no
[1:04:21] natural light so they come up with all
[1:04:23] kinds of led light
[1:04:24] cfl light look at all the lights they're
[1:04:26] producing
[1:04:28] because they don't have any natural
[1:04:29] light so they keep producing more
[1:04:31] advanced light more advanced light and
[1:04:33] it's all darkness friends
[1:04:36] the compromise moves through and it
[1:04:38] brings you
[1:04:40] to spiritual famine and now
[1:04:44] you're dried up spiritually you're
[1:04:46] anemic
[1:04:47] you're poor miserable blind and naked
[1:04:53] hallelujah but god has a beast to combat
[1:04:57] that
[1:05:00] the fifth seal says now the third beast
[1:05:01] that went out from the devil was that
[1:05:03] black horse sea
[1:05:04] now the third beast that went out power
[1:05:06] from god
[1:05:07] to combat him to combat the powers of
[1:05:09] the black horse was a man
[1:05:11] cunning smart with the wisdom of god
[1:05:15] now we've got to be careful that that we
[1:05:16] get this right
[1:05:19] that he's bringing this anointing of a
[1:05:22] man to combat
[1:05:23] the dark ages and we see in the church
[1:05:26] ages how he did this by inspiring luther
[1:05:28] and wesley and all the men that come
[1:05:29] through those
[1:05:30] reformation revivals they started
[1:05:32] catching the word amen
[1:05:33] the word was being printed in their
[1:05:35] language they were reading it they were
[1:05:36] catching inspiration
[1:05:37] but you have to understand it's wisdom
[1:05:38] from god not man's wisdom
[1:05:41] god symbolizes it by a man because when
[1:05:43] you look at the beast as you move
[1:05:45] each beast has a characteristic and he's
[1:05:47] capitalizing on the characteristic
[1:05:49] and the lion has a characteristic of
[1:05:51] being noble and
[1:05:52] a king and strong and powerful
[1:05:55] and able to devour all of its enemies
[1:05:58] that's what the pure word will do
[1:06:00] but then he takes the beast of an ox and
[1:06:02] he shows that now he's got a sacrificial
[1:06:04] animal that can bear burns that can bear
[1:06:06] under a load that can sacrifice itself
[1:06:08] for the word
[1:06:10] now he comes to the beast of a man
[1:06:12] because a man is superior to all these
[1:06:15] other beasts and his intellects
[1:06:17] in his wisdom and this is not a man's
[1:06:20] wisdom this is god's wisdom
[1:06:23] be careful god's not ever telling us go
[1:06:25] to intellectual understanding
[1:06:26] he's typing it he's showing the strength
[1:06:29] of the man as his intellect
[1:06:32] bill graham says so here in the next
[1:06:34] quote now the next thing went out to
[1:06:36] combat that was the beast was the face
[1:06:37] of a man
[1:06:38] smart educated shrewd fine anointed with
[1:06:41] the spirit of that day you notice it
[1:06:43] now he went to combat him with the
[1:06:44] cunningness of god's wisdom
[1:06:46] with him he knew how to take that word
[1:06:50] and defeat that black horse he knew how
[1:06:54] to preach against the bread
[1:06:55] and the barley he knew how to take the
[1:06:58] oil and the wine and he knew how to
[1:07:01] to present it so that it would free
[1:07:02] people from spiritual famine
[1:07:05] and the physio says now notice the beast
[1:07:07] come to combat it now
[1:07:09] was man and we all know that this beast
[1:07:11] of man this power of man
[1:07:13] is his intellectuals
[1:07:16] now oil typifies spirit and wine
[1:07:20] symbolizes stimulation of revelation
[1:07:22] remember
[1:07:23] it was the lamb who said a measure of
[1:07:25] wheat for a penny three measures of
[1:07:27] barley but see
[1:07:28] thou touch not the oil and the wine
[1:07:31] so so yes you're going to do this yes
[1:07:34] it's permitted
[1:07:35] but you're not going to touch the oil
[1:07:37] and the wine so the oil in the wine
[1:07:39] is what is what is going to anoint the
[1:07:42] man
[1:07:44] amen he said now oil typify spirit and
[1:07:47] wine symbolizes stimulation of
[1:07:49] revelation boy
[1:07:50] i like to run all over the place it's a
[1:07:52] wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood
[1:07:53] when the lord showed me that stimulation
[1:07:56] of revelation
[1:07:57] oil and wine and the bible's associated
[1:07:59] together always
[1:08:00] i got the concordance and looked and
[1:08:02] there's a string of them like that
[1:08:04] where wine and oil goes together all the
[1:08:06] time when the truth of a promised word
[1:08:08] of god has been truly revealed to his
[1:08:10] saints
[1:08:11] that's filled with oil they all get
[1:08:13] stimulated
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] let's read that again when the truth a
[1:08:19] be promised word of god like the opening
[1:08:21] of the seven seals like the mighty angel
[1:08:23] coming down
[1:08:24] like the days of the voice of the
[1:08:25] seventh angel like malachi 4
[1:08:27] what like revelations 10 8-11 when the
[1:08:30] truth of that
[1:08:31] of the word of god has been truly
[1:08:33] revealed to his saints
[1:08:34] that's filled with oil they all get
[1:08:36] stimulated
[1:08:39] wine is a stimulation glory i feel it
[1:08:41] right now amen
[1:08:43] stimulated with joy shouts amen
[1:08:46] and when when and wine does upon a
[1:08:49] natural man because when the revelation
[1:08:51] has been
[1:08:52] given of truth of god and the true
[1:08:53] believer filled with oil and the
[1:08:55] revelation is revealed
[1:08:56] the stimulation becomes so great that it
[1:08:59] makes him behave himself
[1:09:00] unnormal how many likes to get a little
[1:09:04] unnormal once in a while
[1:09:06] hallelujah you know it's just why
[1:09:09] this is where pentecostalism failed amen
[1:09:12] in the pentecostal revival i don't mean
[1:09:13] the original pentecost that fell
[1:09:15] but i mean the pentecostal revival fell
[1:09:18] because they put
[1:09:19] everything in the reaction of
[1:09:21] stimulation right
[1:09:23] so the the stimulation by wine it causes
[1:09:26] dancing and shouting and joy
[1:09:28] and ecstatic worship and all of these
[1:09:30] things come out of it
[1:09:31] and then they begin to think that was
[1:09:33] what was important amen
[1:09:35] and they'd left off amen what brought
[1:09:37] what brought about the stimulation which
[1:09:39] was the revelation of the word
[1:09:41] so they left off the revelation of the
[1:09:43] word and kept trying to keep the things
[1:09:45] stimulated by the outward works of a
[1:09:47] drunken man
[1:09:50] but what are they drunk on they were
[1:09:51] drunk on emotionalism
[1:09:54] that's why that's why amen we don't have
[1:09:57] to
[1:09:58] we don't have to manufacture and pump up
[1:10:00] and run the aisles during the song
[1:10:02] service and shout and holler
[1:10:03] to feel like we've had something from
[1:10:05] god that's why a church
[1:10:06] amen a church under the revelation of
[1:10:09] the word they'll sit here
[1:10:10] and as they see that word and it's
[1:10:12] breaking right before their eyes
[1:10:13] they'll say amen hallelujah praise god
[1:10:16] what is it it's stimulation of
[1:10:18] revelation friends
[1:10:20] that's what caused the outpouring of the
[1:10:22] stimulation of revelation on azusa
[1:10:24] street
[1:10:24] they saw the promise in the word of
[1:10:27] gifts come back into the church
[1:10:29] and that's what stimulated them it was
[1:10:32] the promised word coming back as what
[1:10:34] was stimulating them
[1:10:36] but then when it was time for more
[1:10:38] promised word all they wanted was the
[1:10:40] stimulation with no wine
[1:10:44] a manufactured stimulation but when you
[1:10:47] get so excited about the word in this
[1:10:49] day
[1:10:50] when you see redemption you start to
[1:10:51] catch what the prophet's telling us
[1:10:53] it brings an absolute stimulation that
[1:10:55] brings joy
[1:10:56] unspeakable and full of glory when you
[1:10:59] see your position in him before the
[1:11:00] foundation of the world
[1:11:01] and that you're never never never never
[1:11:03] going to be lost it brings such a joy of
[1:11:06] stimulation
[1:11:06] you could tap your foot just a little
[1:11:08] bit raise your hand
[1:11:10] say amen just a little bit why it's not
[1:11:12] stimulation with no wine
[1:11:14] it's the wine that's bringing the
[1:11:16] stimulation
[1:11:18] hallelujah the revealed word
[1:11:24] hallelujah
[1:11:28] so the man we see has
[1:11:31] oil the holy spirit whine the
[1:11:34] stimulation of revelation
[1:11:36] and spiritual understanding by
[1:11:38] revelation
[1:11:41] see friends daniel
[1:11:44] said the wicked will not understand
[1:11:50] the whole idea of you don't have to
[1:11:54] understand
[1:11:55] is true you don't have to have an
[1:11:57] intellectual understanding you have to
[1:11:59] believe
[1:12:01] but how can you believe what you don't
[1:12:03] see
[1:12:07] like i could tell you that i've got a
[1:12:09] new doctrine i got a revelation from the
[1:12:10] lord
[1:12:11] and and i found this scrap scripture in
[1:12:14] uh this
[1:12:15] scripture in the bible and i got it
[1:12:16] wrote down on here and it is absolutely
[1:12:18] pure it's absolutely perfect
[1:12:20] now you don't need to understand it you
[1:12:21] just need to believe it
[1:12:23] do you all believe it
[1:12:27] you have to see it to believe it it's
[1:12:29] got to be revealed to you
[1:12:31] and it's going to be revealed to you
[1:12:32] under teaching under the word under the
[1:12:34] anointing under the oil anointing
[1:12:36] is going to bring stimulation of
[1:12:38] revelation you can't just say
[1:12:40] you don't have to understand it just
[1:12:41] believe it you've got to see it
[1:12:44] man you've got to actually have
[1:12:46] something explained or something
[1:12:47] quickened or
[1:12:48] some word brother branham comes and he's
[1:12:50] teaching he's teaching
[1:12:51] he's never saying just believe he is
[1:12:53] saying just believe but not like we
[1:12:55] think he's saying just believe
[1:12:57] he's saying you don't have to figure it
[1:12:58] out you don't have to say well how does
[1:13:00] that work and i don't have all the
[1:13:01] details just right
[1:13:02] this has to add to that you don't have
[1:13:04] to add it all up
[1:13:06] you don't have to add it all up you
[1:13:07] don't have to make the equation come out
[1:13:08] just right
[1:13:09] but once he shows it to you you can
[1:13:11] believe it because you see it's true
[1:13:12] you've got a witness in the heart
[1:13:14] you don't have to have intellectual
[1:13:15] understanding but you have to base your
[1:13:17] faith on something
[1:13:18] and your faith is based on the word of
[1:13:20] god
[1:13:22] and god wants you to understand
[1:13:26] he absolutely wants you to understand
[1:13:29] with the wisdom of god not with
[1:13:32] man's intellectual understanding but
[1:13:34] with the wisdom and understanding
[1:13:35] that comes by revelation but he
[1:13:38] absolutely wants you to understand
[1:13:40] he went through a lot of effort for us
[1:13:42] not to need to understand
[1:13:46] daniel he says the wicked shall not
[1:13:48] understand we read this at the beginning
[1:13:50] shall not understand he said but
[1:13:55] but the wise will understand
[1:14:00] i said god make me wise
[1:14:03] give me stimulation by revelation lord
[1:14:06] reveal your word to me let me see it god
[1:14:08] like i've never seen it before
[1:14:10] oh god stimulate me by a revelation of
[1:14:13] your word
[1:14:15] amen praise god that's
[1:14:18] what makes us strong that's what that's
[1:14:21] what combats the enemy
[1:14:23] is when we know what word we're standing
[1:14:26] on
[1:14:29] the third seal so now i've got another
[1:14:32] thing here i want you to notice
[1:14:34] it was not one of the four beasts that
[1:14:35] said don't touch the oil and the wine
[1:14:37] did you notice that
[1:14:38] the four beasts had been talking but
[1:14:40] watch let me just read out there just
[1:14:42] a little bit a measure of a penny for a
[1:14:45] wheat for a penny and three measures of
[1:14:46] barley for a penny see thou hurt not the
[1:14:48] wine and the oil
[1:14:49] now look here and i heard a voice in the
[1:14:52] midst of the four beasts what was it the
[1:14:53] lamb
[1:14:55] amen it wasn't the four beasts the lamb
[1:14:57] said it
[1:14:58] why he's going to take his own
[1:15:01] that belongs to him he's redeemed it see
[1:15:04] don't you touch that oil
[1:15:07] no sir not the four beasts but the lamb
[1:15:09] was the one who said it
[1:15:10] now oh my the lamb not the four beasts
[1:15:12] didn't announce this
[1:15:14] the lamb said itself when the four bees
[1:15:16] said come and see and they went
[1:15:17] and they seen it like that and he said a
[1:15:20] measure of wheat for a penny
[1:15:22] see much like this and so much barley
[1:15:24] but then the lamb cried out right among
[1:15:26] them and said but don't
[1:15:27] hurt the wine and the oil
[1:15:31] because the oil and the wine is
[1:15:33] essential
[1:15:35] for overcoming the black horse rider
[1:15:39] you're not going to overcome him without
[1:15:41] the oil and wine
[1:15:44] what was it that woke you out of
[1:15:45] spiritual family
[1:15:48] what was it that brought you out of your
[1:15:50] dark ages we come into the world
[1:15:53] darkened dead into sin under a cloud of
[1:15:55] darkness not
[1:15:56] understanding anything but there come a
[1:15:58] time there was an awakening in our life
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:01] and what was it it was the oil and the
[1:16:03] wine that's why he said don't touch the
[1:16:05] old and the wine because the only thing
[1:16:07] that'll break the power of the black
[1:16:08] horse
[1:16:09] when he brings you into spiritual famine
[1:16:10] in the dark ages the only thing that
[1:16:12] will break that is
[1:16:13] oil and wine that's why friends when you
[1:16:16] find somebody
[1:16:17] steeped in a denominational system or
[1:16:19] trapped in darkness of a false doctrine
[1:16:21] it doesn't do you any good to fight with
[1:16:23] them it doesn't do you any good to argue
[1:16:24] or tell them how bad they are
[1:16:26] all you got to do is give them a little
[1:16:28] wine
[1:16:30] amen just give them a little revelation
[1:16:33] that god's revealing to you
[1:16:34] share with them something that's
[1:16:35] stimulating you and see if they can get
[1:16:37] stimulated
[1:16:39] don't argue about how wrong the system
[1:16:40] is don't go back and show them the
[1:16:42] origin of it and where it fell away
[1:16:44] blah blah blah blah blah they don't need
[1:16:45] that they need the stimulation they need
[1:16:48] the oil
[1:16:49] and the wine and there you are
[1:16:52] full of oil full of new wine then you
[1:16:55] just try to give them a little bit of
[1:16:56] that wine and see if they're thirsty
[1:17:00] because if if god brings them oil and
[1:17:02] wine they'll come right out of that
[1:17:03] black horse system
[1:17:05] doesn't do any good to debate
[1:17:07] intellectual debate isn't going to do
[1:17:09] you one ounce of good
[1:17:10] going tis for tad on the doctrines
[1:17:12] that's not going to do you one bit of
[1:17:14] good
[1:17:14] the only thing that will bring anybody
[1:17:17] out of spiritual famine
[1:17:18] is the revelation of the hour is the oil
[1:17:21] and the wine hallelujah
[1:17:24] and if you want somebody to awaken out
[1:17:26] of spiritual famine give them a little
[1:17:28] wine
[1:17:30] just share with them say this lord's
[1:17:31] been showing me so many things and i see
[1:17:33] this in the bible and listen to this
[1:17:35] have you ever heard of that before
[1:17:38] oh there's a seat on the inside
[1:17:40] something's going to quiver just a
[1:17:41] little bit
[1:17:43] the outside mind might shut it down real
[1:17:45] quick but you just keep sowing in there
[1:17:47] that stimulation that's stimulating you
[1:17:49] and that seed on the inside is going to
[1:17:51] quiver just a little bit
[1:17:53] quiver just a little bit more until all
[1:17:55] of a sudden there's an awakening of the
[1:17:56] seed
[1:17:57] and they receive their own oil and their
[1:17:58] own wine
[1:18:01] the only thing that will bring you out
[1:18:02] of your spiritual funk
[1:18:05] your spiritual dark ages your spiritual
[1:18:07] famine is to get back to the word
[1:18:11] you can't work your way out of it
[1:18:13] friends
[1:18:14] you can't you can't work your way out of
[1:18:17] that
[1:18:18] it's going to take another inspiration
[1:18:20] from heaven to break you out of that
[1:18:23] it's going to take another little bit of
[1:18:25] that word that quickened something
[1:18:26] inside of you that brings you back to
[1:18:28] life
[1:18:29] to bring you out of your spiritual
[1:18:30] darkness
[1:18:32] hallelujah the third seal he says now we
[1:18:36] find out he
[1:18:37] he measures it out and charged for it
[1:18:39] exactly wheat
[1:18:40] natural natural life that was living on
[1:18:43] but symbolizing spirit
[1:18:44] oil and joy of the wine that spirit life
[1:18:47] don't hurt
[1:18:48] that leave it alone now
[1:18:51] we've been talking about this quite a
[1:18:53] bit but i want to want to show you
[1:18:55] that this this black horse rider
[1:18:58] is totally content with you going
[1:19:00] through the religious motions of church
[1:19:04] totally completely content
[1:19:07] in fact prefers it that way
[1:19:11] if you just go through the religious
[1:19:13] motions of church
[1:19:14] come to church and i pay my tithes and
[1:19:16] i'm a good christian
[1:19:18] that's not what god wants the lamb
[1:19:21] didn't say anything the lamb said you
[1:19:24] can measure out the wheat and the barley
[1:19:25] the natural
[1:19:26] just going through the natural part of
[1:19:27] church there's a natural part of church
[1:19:29] life you can go just through the natural
[1:19:31] part of church life but that's not what
[1:19:33] it takes
[1:19:33] it takes the oil and the wine
[1:19:36] you can go you've got to do the natural
[1:19:38] part of church life there's nothing
[1:19:39] wrong with that but if that's all there
[1:19:41] is there's no life yet
[1:19:43] he wants you to have a spiritual life a
[1:19:46] life
[1:19:46] full of the oil with the stimulation
[1:19:49] that comes from the wine
[1:19:51] you can go to church every sunday it
[1:19:52] doesn't mean a thing
[1:19:54] it's good to come to church every sunday
[1:19:55] we believe that that's the word but if
[1:19:57] there's no spiritual life there
[1:19:59] you're gonna have to get an anointing
[1:20:00] from the word an inspiration that comes
[1:20:02] from the message of the hour
[1:20:04] to quicken something on the inside to
[1:20:05] stimulate my revelation to give a little
[1:20:08] life
[1:20:08] back in there you need to get drunk a
[1:20:11] little bit amen
[1:20:12] too stagnant on old stagnant waters and
[1:20:14] old things and just living a dry life
[1:20:17] living a black life living a famine life
[1:20:19] where spiritually
[1:20:20] you don't have enough spiritual faith to
[1:20:22] pray for your own family that they'll be
[1:20:24] healed
[1:20:24] not enough spiritual faith to stand on
[1:20:26] your own word amen
[1:20:30] dry anemic
[1:20:33] and spiritual famine and you can be that
[1:20:37] way
[1:20:37] sitting in the church wanting the other
[1:20:41] brothers and sisters to do it for you or
[1:20:42] the preacher to do it for you
[1:20:44] but god wants you to have the spirit
[1:20:46] life he wants you to have the oil and
[1:20:48] the wine he wants you to have the fresh
[1:20:50] revival going in inside
[1:20:52] he wants you to get a little bit drunk
[1:20:54] on this revelation
[1:20:55] and let it stimulate you into action
[1:20:57] where you actually get up and shout a
[1:20:58] little bit say amen once in a while
[1:21:00] clap your hands or go out on the street
[1:21:02] and start sharing it with other people
[1:21:06] not dead formal religion but a spirit
[1:21:08] life drunk on the wine of revelation
[1:21:11] hallelujah that's what i want friends
[1:21:14] it's a lot funner to be drunk on wine
[1:21:16] than it is be sitting around dead on old
[1:21:18] stale bread
[1:21:19] i want to be drunk on the wine of that
[1:21:21] revelation that stimulates that gives
[1:21:23] life
[1:21:24] that excites us all over again amen
[1:21:26] remember when you first come to the
[1:21:28] message how excited you were
[1:21:30] oh i found a source of life i've never
[1:21:33] heard these things before
[1:21:34] it's everything inside of me is coming
[1:21:36] to life well don't you go through this
[1:21:38] paralysis of of compromise to the red
[1:21:41] horse to the black horse spiritual
[1:21:43] family
[1:21:43] come back to that first love and say
[1:21:45] lord i'm going to dive into this word
[1:21:47] right here
[1:21:48] and i pray that you would stimulate me
[1:21:50] with new wine
[1:21:52] get me a little bit drunk and get me
[1:21:53] back into action where i lose my
[1:21:55] inhibition i lose my old stale thought
[1:21:57] process and i just get into action
[1:22:01] hallelujah
[1:22:05] the four series says now the power of
[1:22:07] revelation
[1:22:08] brings stimulation to the believer for
[1:22:11] the power of the wine natural wine is to
[1:22:14] stimulate
[1:22:15] to bring a person that's all slumped
[1:22:17] down to a stimulation see
[1:22:19] when they now know they're a power of
[1:22:21] the revelation of the word
[1:22:23] gives stimulation of joy to the believer
[1:22:25] stimulation of satisfaction
[1:22:27] the stimulation that it's vindicated
[1:22:29] it's proved
[1:22:31] it's called in the scriptures we want to
[1:22:32] refer to it as new wine they always
[1:22:34] like to that these are drunk on new wine
[1:22:37] see
[1:22:38] all right spiritual wine i think the
[1:22:39] best interpretation would be
[1:22:41] on spiritual wine as the natural wine
[1:22:44] reveals itself
[1:22:45] in a and stimulating power so does the
[1:22:49] new
[1:22:49] wine as it reveals the word of god which
[1:22:52] is spirit
[1:22:54] see the word itself is spirit
[1:23:00] that's what brings the life that's what
[1:23:03] brings the stimulation is the revelation
[1:23:05] of the word
[1:23:08] see he says the word itself is spirit
[1:23:12] it's spirit in word form
[1:23:16] jesus said my word that i speak unto you
[1:23:18] they are spirit
[1:23:19] and they are life the word itself
[1:23:23] is spirit it's a spirit in the word form
[1:23:26] and then you see when it's quickened or
[1:23:28] brought to life the spirit of the word
[1:23:30] goes to work and
[1:23:31] acts it's the spirit of the word that
[1:23:34] goes to work in your life
[1:23:36] it's not you that goes to work you don't
[1:23:39] wake up in the morning and
[1:23:40] and get out your tool bag and say i'm
[1:23:41] going to work on this old pesthouse and
[1:23:43] i'm going to clean it up and fix it up
[1:23:45] and shape it up
[1:23:45] and make it ready for the rapture it's
[1:23:47] not you that does that
[1:23:49] it's the word that does that when the
[1:23:51] word's been quickened because the word
[1:23:53] is spirit
[1:23:54] when that when you receive that word
[1:23:55] that spirit comes with it and it begins
[1:23:57] to work and act
[1:24:01] all we have to do is submit to the word
[1:24:04] we can't neglect the word we can't
[1:24:06] neglect the message we can't neglect
[1:24:07] these things and expect to overcome
[1:24:10] because it takes the oil and the wine
[1:24:14] but now you start bringing the word now
[1:24:16] that's the thing that actually brings
[1:24:18] life is the word
[1:24:19] and that brings the joy of stimulation
[1:24:21] of new wine and that's what it was on
[1:24:23] pentecost when the word
[1:24:25] was vindicated i'll tell you friends i
[1:24:28] read in this book
[1:24:30] and i'll be reading down and i've got
[1:24:31] all kinds of things marked up
[1:24:33] and i'll be reading all of a sudden i'll
[1:24:34] go to stomping my foot
[1:24:36] and i'll say oh praise god
[1:24:40] what was it stimulation by revelation
[1:24:43] something struck me i just saw myself
[1:24:45] another way
[1:24:46] i just saw a clear picture of jesus
[1:24:48] christ oh that's redemption that's what
[1:24:50] redemption is
[1:24:52] i'm seeing it it's coming to me by
[1:24:54] stimulation by revelation
[1:24:56] i get more excited about that oh my
[1:24:59] people will go they'll go get stimulated
[1:25:02] at a ball game
[1:25:04] and and you know what it's fine to be
[1:25:06] excited for whatever
[1:25:08] you stimulated a ballgame and can't find
[1:25:10] any stimulation in the seals book
[1:25:14] how can you be so excited when somebody
[1:25:17] carrying
[1:25:18] a piece of pigskin crosses a certain
[1:25:20] line
[1:25:21] that you'll stand to your feet in your
[1:25:23] house and put both hands over your hair
[1:25:24] and say all right way to go but when the
[1:25:27] message is coming across and god's
[1:25:29] revealing the word
[1:25:30] you just sit there with no life and
[1:25:32] spiritual famine it doesn't mean
[1:25:33] anything
[1:25:36] i read the message like it's a stale
[1:25:38] book just like it's a textbook i'm
[1:25:39] reading
[1:25:40] my math book or i'm reading my history
[1:25:42] book or the history of the church ages
[1:25:44] oh my goodness that's life that should
[1:25:46] bring life
[1:25:47] if it's not bringing life we say god do
[1:25:49] something in me that this brings life to
[1:25:52] me
[1:25:52] stimulation where i go to patent my foot
[1:25:54] a little bit i slap my hand on my knee i
[1:25:56] say oh that's good
[1:25:59] listening to a tape going down the road
[1:26:00] and you start pounding on your steering
[1:26:02] wheels anybody ever done that
[1:26:04] gets so excited you start pounding on
[1:26:06] your steering wheel next thing you know
[1:26:07] you're
[1:26:08] speeding up and slowing down and
[1:26:09] speeding up and the people all around

[1:26:50] raised his hand and the little boy he
[1:26:52] didn't say mama
[1:26:54] that's me when he caught the revelation
[1:26:58] of what that was
[1:27:00] that was a reflection of himself he went
[1:27:02] running mama mama mama
[1:27:04] that's me oh when i see this word

[1:27:45] worth being excited about
[1:27:49] hallelujah i can't think of any other
[1:27:51] reason to get beside yourself
[1:27:54] brother branham said i started looking
[1:27:55] at that and talking about that i go to
[1:27:57] cutting up a little bit
[1:28:00] hallelujah why
[1:28:04] stimulation of revelation
[1:28:10] let's turn to luke
[1:28:13] chapter 15. we'll look at just a couple
[1:28:15] stories as we wind down
[1:28:17] and we'll close
[1:28:24] one thing i've noticed about people who
[1:28:25] drink and get stimulated
[1:28:28] they like it
[1:28:32] and you don't ever have to beg them to
[1:28:35] come to the bar
[1:28:38] friday night saturday they're going to
[1:28:41] be there
[1:28:42] why they like the effects of the wine
[1:28:46] they like the way it feels they're going
[1:28:49] to be there you don't beg them nobody
[1:28:51] sends out special invitations
[1:28:52] amen nobody goes oh would you please
[1:28:54] please please come tonight
[1:28:56] they're there they're first ones in line
[1:28:58] they're there every time
[1:28:59] they know their name because they're
[1:29:00] always here every friday bill's here
[1:29:02] larry's here why
[1:29:03] they love it somebody who gets
[1:29:06] stimulated by revelation you don't
[1:29:08] beg them to come to church you don't
[1:29:09] have to coax them in if they like that
[1:29:11] wine they're going to be here
[1:29:12] you don't have to beg them to listen to
[1:29:14] a tape they like drinking wine
[1:29:16] they like the effects of the stimulation
[1:29:18] they like the revelation that comes
[1:29:19] forth
[1:29:20] they're going to drink and drink and
[1:29:21] drink and drink and drink
[1:29:25] no begging a drunk to drink amen
[1:29:30] after those disciples spilled out of the
[1:29:31] upper room you didn't have to coax them
[1:29:33] into another meeting
[1:29:35] they had tasted the stimulation by
[1:29:37] revelation in the upper room and they
[1:29:39] spilled out
[1:29:39] as those that were drunk on new wine and
[1:29:43] what was it
[1:29:44] they talked to peter they said these are
[1:29:46] drunk
[1:29:47] on new wine and they mock them peter
[1:29:49] stood up these men are not drunk as you
[1:29:50] suppose
[1:29:51] but this is the fulfillment of
[1:29:54] scriptures
[1:29:55] what was it that was causing them to act
[1:29:57] like that the fulfillment of scriptures
[1:30:00] friends
[1:30:00] peter peter stood up on that first day
[1:30:03] and started breaking out the word to
[1:30:05] them
[1:30:05] and brother branham said what was it
[1:30:07] that got them so excited
[1:30:08] when they see the promised word come to
[1:30:10] pass in their life
[1:30:11] that's what was stimulating them to
[1:30:13] dance and the shout and to run about in
[1:30:15] the street
[1:30:15] and to speak with other tongues it
[1:30:17] wasn't something that just the spirit
[1:30:19] just picked them up and moved them about
[1:30:21] and they had no control of themselves
[1:30:22] they were stimulated by a revelation
[1:30:25] coming to pass
[1:30:26] right now they could see the prophecy of
[1:30:30] joel
[1:30:30] they could see what david had talked
[1:30:32] about that's what that was what peter's
[1:30:34] referring to in that first sermon
[1:30:36] he said this is what joel said this is
[1:30:38] what this is what
[1:30:39] david said and they could see the word
[1:30:42] fulfilled
[1:30:43] then and then they got to cutting up and
[1:30:46] acting crazy and running around why
[1:30:48] they were stimulated by the revelation
[1:30:50] of the word
[1:30:51] now hallelujah
[1:30:55] that revelation of that word now should
[1:30:58] be stimulating us
[1:30:59] friends it should be exciting us
[1:31:02] because it's happening now
[1:31:06] luke chapter 15
[1:31:10] verse 11.
[1:31:16] you're so stimulated i forget what
[1:31:18] scripture we're going to read and i
[1:31:19] forget what we're supposed to do
[1:31:22] but i like it you don't have to beg me
[1:31:25] to take another drink
[1:31:27] i'll take another drink
[1:31:30] luke chapter 15 verse 11 and he said a
[1:31:34] certain man had two sons
[1:31:36] and the younger them said to his father
[1:31:38] father give me the portion of goods that
[1:31:40] falleth to me
[1:31:41] and he divided unto him his living and
[1:31:44] not many days after the younger son
[1:31:46] gathered all together
[1:31:47] and took his journey into a far country
[1:31:49] in their way and there wasted his
[1:31:51] substance with riotous living
[1:31:53] when he had spent all their there arose
[1:31:55] a mighty famine
[1:31:56] in the land see this boy he moves out
[1:32:00] and he finds himself in the third seal
[1:32:04] and there's a mighty famine in that land
[1:32:08] and he began to be in want and he went
[1:32:10] and joined himself to citizen
[1:32:12] of the country and he sent him into the
[1:32:14] fields to feed swine
[1:32:16] and he would feign have filled his belly
[1:32:18] with the hust that the swine did eat
[1:32:20] and no man gave unto him so here we find
[1:32:23] a man who leaves his father's house
[1:32:26] and he goes into a far country and he
[1:32:27] finds himself in famine
[1:32:30] he finds himself in the third seal and
[1:32:33] while he's in the third seal
[1:32:35] amen he he he is so low down
[1:32:41] in the third seal that he is about ready
[1:32:44] to eat
[1:32:44] pig food
[1:32:48] friends when you get away from god
[1:32:52] and get to such a spiritual famine
[1:32:54] condition
[1:32:55] that you're about to eat pig food
[1:32:58] hollywood entertainments of the world
[1:33:02] that's pig food friends you can solo
[1:33:06] down such in a famine condition famine
[1:33:09] from he's away from israel
[1:33:11] away from his father's house in such a
[1:33:12] famine condition so low down
[1:33:14] he's about to start eating pig food
[1:33:19] when you get into that condition wake up
[1:33:22] when you're just about to be tempted to
[1:33:23] go to the movie theater about to be
[1:33:25] tempted to go
[1:33:26] feast on hollywood wake up you're about
[1:33:28] to eat pig food
[1:33:31] and this scripture will determine where
[1:33:33] you're at you're just about to feed on
[1:33:35] pig slop
[1:33:36] that's how much in spiritual famine this
[1:33:38] man was
[1:33:41] why because he wasn't feeding on
[1:33:43] anything that would sustain him
[1:33:46] he didn't have any nourishment or any
[1:33:48] sustenance so the only thing that he
[1:33:50] could get was pig food for a little
[1:33:51] stimulation
[1:33:54] when you have to go to pig food to
[1:33:56] stimulate you
[1:33:57] there's a problem when pig food is what
[1:34:01] will excite you and stimulate you
[1:34:03] and get you to the next weekend is a
[1:34:05] little more pig food there's a problem
[1:34:07] you're in spiritual
[1:34:08] famine
[1:34:11] verse 15 we'll read it again and he
[1:34:13] joined himself to the citizen of the
[1:34:15] country and he sent him into the fields
[1:34:16] to feed swine and he would feign have
[1:34:18] filled his belly with the hust that the
[1:34:20] swine did eat
[1:34:21] and no man gave unto him and when he
[1:34:23] come to himself he said
[1:34:25] how many hired servants of my fathers
[1:34:27] have bread enough to eat
[1:34:28] and to spare and i perish with hunger
[1:34:32] i will arise and go to my father and
[1:34:34] will say unto him father
[1:34:36] i have sinned against heaven and before
[1:34:38] thee
[1:34:39] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:34:41] son make me as one of thy hired servants
[1:34:44] friends when he got into this condition
[1:34:46] where he was about to eat pig food
[1:34:49] verse 17 said and when he came to
[1:34:52] himself
[1:34:54] when he caught a revelation this
[1:34:57] is not what i was born for this is not
[1:35:00] what i'm here for
[1:35:02] this is not where i came from when he
[1:35:05] came to himself
[1:35:06] oh if you're in the if you're in the
[1:35:08] third seal come to yourself now
[1:35:10] if you're in spiritual famine come to
[1:35:12] yourself awaken now
[1:35:14] and say this isn't what i was born for i
[1:35:16] wasn't put on this earth
[1:35:17] to tend to the things of the world and
[1:35:19] eat pig food i was i'm
[1:35:21] from my father's house i'll go back to
[1:35:23] my father's house
[1:35:26] come back to where the food is good amen
[1:35:29] come back
[1:35:30] to where the source is pure yes he said
[1:35:32] i will go to my father's house
[1:35:34] but he went humbly broken
[1:35:38] in humility he passes through the
[1:35:40] judgment seal and says i'm not
[1:35:42] even worthy i'm not worthy
[1:35:46] father just make me a servant he didn't
[1:35:48] come back
[1:35:49] proud having conquered the world he'd
[1:35:50] come back recognizing what he needed
[1:35:54] verse 20 and he arose and came to his
[1:35:57] father
[1:35:58] but when he was yet a great way off his
[1:36:00] father saw him and had compassion
[1:36:02] and ran and fell on his neck and kissed
[1:36:04] him and the son said unto him father i
[1:36:06] have sinned against heaven in the sight
[1:36:08] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:36:10] son
[1:36:11] said to his servants bring forth the
[1:36:13] best robe amen
[1:36:16] and put it on him and put a ring on his
[1:36:18] hand and shoes on his feet
[1:36:20] what did he do he brought him to
[1:36:22] adoption
[1:36:25] put a robe on him and a ring on his
[1:36:26] finger he brought him to holy ghost
[1:36:28] baptism to adoption
[1:36:33] bring he said and bring hither the
[1:36:36] fatted calf and kill it let us eat and
[1:36:37] be merry
[1:36:38] for this my son was dead and is alive
[1:36:41] again he was
[1:36:42] lost and is found and they began to be
[1:36:45] merry
[1:36:46] friends this is the story of our lives
[1:36:50] this is the story of our lives the son
[1:36:53] was lost when was he a son he was always
[1:36:55] a son
[1:36:56] when he was down in the far country
[1:36:58] living for the world he was a son
[1:37:01] when he got so low down he would eat the
[1:37:03] pig food he was a son
[1:37:04] when he came to himself he was a son
[1:37:08] he come back in repentance to his
[1:37:09] father's house what was it it was the
[1:37:11] man anointing when he came to himself
[1:37:13] caught revelation
[1:37:14] the man anointing brought him to the
[1:37:16] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:37:18] to adoption put the robe on him and put
[1:37:21] the ring on his finger
[1:37:25] come to ourselves now say i'm from my
[1:37:28] father's house
[1:37:31] i don't have to live this way
[1:37:34] samson had gotten the condition
[1:37:38] where he began to compromise see samson
[1:37:42] goes all the way through the seals
[1:37:43] friends
[1:37:45] samson sees a woman that's not of israel
[1:37:50] and he wants her to be his wife there
[1:37:52] was a commandment that he wasn't
[1:37:53] supposed to take
[1:37:54] of the children of the land and make his
[1:37:57] wife there was a commandment
[1:37:58] but he could probably reason in a way
[1:37:59] because moses did it and it was fine
[1:38:03] right joseph did it and it was fine and
[1:38:06] it's happened before and it's fine
[1:38:07] he didn't even understand the word of
[1:38:09] god that joseph and moses were types of
[1:38:11] christ who had to take a gentile bride
[1:38:14] so now he could probably reason away
[1:38:16] because he saw somebody else do it
[1:38:18] not looking at the word but looking at
[1:38:19] what somebody else did
[1:38:21] and he began to reason because other
[1:38:23] people have done it and i saw moses and
[1:38:24] i saw joseph and
[1:38:26] it'll be okay for me and so he begins to
[1:38:28] compromise but that compromise
[1:38:30] takes him all the way to destruction
[1:38:32] friends
[1:38:33] because he compromised instead of taking
[1:38:35] a wife from the daughters of his people
[1:38:36] he takes a wife from the philistines
[1:38:38] and after he takes that wife we know the
[1:38:40] story gets in the conflict and next
[1:38:42] thing you know he's in the red horse
[1:38:43] anointing
[1:38:45] god was using it it was part of the plan
[1:38:47] of god but now he's at absolute war
[1:38:50] then he comes in contact with a woman
[1:38:52] delilah it always progresses sin always
[1:38:54] progresses
[1:38:56] and she wants to know the secret of his
[1:38:58] strength and the secret of the strength
[1:38:59] was a covenant with god
[1:39:02] seven locks of hair as a nazarite vow a
[1:39:05] seven seal covenant
[1:39:07] and now he's passing just like the early
[1:39:09] church they come out
[1:39:10] under a covenant with god but they begin
[1:39:12] to lose their covenant when they
[1:39:14] compromise on the word through the
[1:39:15] church ages
[1:39:17] he begins to lose and he begins to
[1:39:20] dabble with the world and go into
[1:39:21] compromise and go under the red
[1:39:23] red horse anointing and then they come
[1:39:25] and they they
[1:39:26] they start to tempt him with what's the
[1:39:29] secret what's the secret
[1:39:30] she asked him multiple times and he goes
[1:39:33] through four stages of a fall
[1:39:36] first he says you buy me with green with
[1:39:38] and i'll be as any man they bind him and
[1:39:39] he breaks them
[1:39:40] you tie me with new robes he's going
[1:39:42] through all four of them friends
[1:39:45] palmer worm canker room caterpillar
[1:39:46] locust it's always the same thing
[1:39:48] through the whole bible
[1:39:49] same thing four stages of destruction
[1:39:52] then they come and he says if you plant
[1:39:54] my hair together and pin it to the beam
[1:39:56] or you pat my hair together in a web she
[1:39:57] does it pins it to the beam he arises
[1:39:59] and pulls it out
[1:40:00] then finally in that fourth one
[1:40:04] she says he says if you cut my hair they
[1:40:08] cut his hair
[1:40:09] and he was weak as any man and they poke
[1:40:12] out his eyes
[1:40:14] next you find him grinding in the mill
[1:40:17] what is he he's an absolute spiritual
[1:40:19] famine
[1:40:21] let's read this in judges turn to judges
[1:40:36] judges chapter 16.
[1:40:46] judges chapter 16 verse 19.
[1:40:52] 19 he started talking about put him to
[1:40:54] sleep she cuts his hair
[1:40:58] and she's she made him sleep upon her
[1:40:59] knees and she called for a man and she
[1:41:01] caused him to shave off
[1:41:02] the seven locks of his head she began to
[1:41:05] afflict him and his strength went from
[1:41:06] him
[1:41:07] and she said the philistines be upon
[1:41:09] thee samson and he awoke out of his
[1:41:11] sleep and said i will go out as at other
[1:41:13] times before
[1:41:14] and shake myself and he wished not that
[1:41:16] the lord was departed from him
[1:41:19] but the philistines took him and put his
[1:41:21] eyes put out his eyes and brought him
[1:41:23] down to gaza
[1:41:24] and bound him with fetters of brass and
[1:41:26] he did grind in the prison house
[1:41:28] how be it the hair of his head began to
[1:41:30] grow again
[1:41:31] after he was shaven so here he comes
[1:41:34] through the seals and he gets down here
[1:41:36] and he's in spiritual famine
[1:41:37] he's working the works he's grinding at
[1:41:39] the mill he has no
[1:41:41] eyesight he's in his dark ages
[1:41:44] but when he's in his dark ages brother
[1:41:47] branham says something very
[1:41:48] interesting and i'll read this as we
[1:41:51] finish
[1:41:56] he says he says samson
[1:42:00] prayed this is out of once just once
[1:42:02] more lord 1963.
[1:42:04] samson prayed right when he said lord
[1:42:06] let me die with these philistines he had
[1:42:08] failed
[1:42:09] but let me die you must be ready to die
[1:42:11] in the enemy that's got this victory
[1:42:12] over you must be willing
[1:42:14] to surrender your own ideas samson was
[1:42:17] willing to pay the price
[1:42:18] to get the power of god again
[1:42:25] he said
[1:42:34] yeah i don't want to go into this next
[1:42:37] part but i want to finish this
[1:42:39] brother branham says in the message i
[1:42:41] can't remember i think it's once more
[1:42:42] he says now samson
[1:42:46] he said a new shock of hair began to
[1:42:48] grow back
[1:42:50] and he says maybe there's a possibility
[1:42:53] that i can be restored what's a new
[1:42:56] shock of hair
[1:42:57] it's the covenant coming back friends
[1:43:00] it's the covenant coming back he's
[1:43:03] coming back to a realization of where
[1:43:04] he'd fallen from
[1:43:06] where his strength really was samson had
[1:43:08] deceived himself in thinking that maybe
[1:43:10] i could
[1:43:11] maybe it's my muscles maybe maybe it's
[1:43:13] my strength maybe it's
[1:43:14] my my good battle skills maybe it's my
[1:43:17] intellect but it was none of that
[1:43:19] it was the covenant it was the first
[1:43:21] love it was the consecration and after
[1:43:24] he comes down here to blindness
[1:43:25] and all of a sudden the revelation comes
[1:43:27] back the seals start coming back friends
[1:43:30] and at the end of the church ages after
[1:43:32] it's all fallen and cut off
[1:43:34] now the seals start coming back and he
[1:43:36] says maybe there's a possibility
[1:43:38] brother starts talking to this and once
[1:43:40] more maybe that church could rise again
[1:43:44] maybe that church could come back to its
[1:43:46] first place
[1:43:47] and and now he says samson now is
[1:43:50] willing to pay the price
[1:43:53] samson wasn't willing to pay the price
[1:43:55] before
[1:43:56] he wasn't willing to live pure to the
[1:43:59] word
[1:44:00] without defilement without compromise he
[1:44:02] wasn't willing to pay the price but now
[1:44:04] he's willing to pay the price he said
[1:44:08] maybe there's a possibility that god
[1:44:11] will have mercy
[1:44:12] and it can all come back and i tell you
[1:44:15] friends
[1:44:17] there's a possibility
[1:44:20] you find yourself moved into spiritual
[1:44:22] famine
[1:44:23] the message just wasn't what it used to
[1:44:25] be and i just don't get excited like i
[1:44:27] used to be
[1:44:27] there's a possibility friends that that
[1:44:31] fresh shock of hair can grow out again
[1:44:34] all that strength and power of the word
[1:44:37] can come back again
[1:44:38] all that anointing of the oil and the
[1:44:40] wine can come back again
[1:44:42] there's a possibility here friends this
[1:44:44] morning there's a possibility
[1:44:46] but you sampson had to be willing to pay
[1:44:49] the price
[1:44:52] samson was willing to pay the price to
[1:44:55] get the power of god again
[1:44:57] and what was the price he said let me
[1:45:00] die
[1:45:02] let me die we've got to die to the
[1:45:05] things of the world
[1:45:06] die to all these other thoughts all
[1:45:08] other ideas
[1:45:09] we've got to consecrate ourselves back
[1:45:11] to our nazarite vow
[1:45:13] and our nazarite vows being pure
[1:45:15] separated to him alone
[1:45:17] let's all stand musicians if you could
[1:45:19] come
[1:45:22] quite a bit more here but we'll get into
[1:45:24] it wednesday night we'll continue on in
[1:45:26] the third seal
[1:45:27] this felt like i wanted to stop right
[1:45:29] there
[1:45:31] say you know what
[1:45:35] spirit spiritual death is the forced
[1:45:37] horse i'll just let the cat out of the
[1:45:39] bag
[1:45:40] spiritual death but the children of god
[1:45:43] never go to the fourth horse
[1:45:48] the fourth horse rider is spiritual
[1:45:50] death eternal separation from god
[1:45:52] and the seed of god never go to the
[1:45:54] fourth horse rider
[1:45:56] they may find themselves in the journey
[1:45:58] they may have got caught up in something
[1:46:00] they may be coming out of the black
[1:46:01] horse but friends sampson could never go
[1:46:04] to eternal separation from god
[1:46:06] you can never go to eternal separation
[1:46:08] from god but if you find yourself
[1:46:11] in a famine condition there is a
[1:46:13] possibility this morning
[1:46:16] a new shock of hair can grow out
[1:46:19] stimulation of revelation can come back
[1:46:21] again
[1:46:22] the power of the word can come back
[1:46:24] again the enthusiasm
[1:46:25] excitement for the word can come back
[1:46:27] again there is a possibility friends
[1:46:31] this is power heads dear heavenly father

[1:55:37] i'm so tired of the world i'm so
[1:55:40] tired of living under my privileges i've
[1:55:43] caught such a revelation beyond he
[1:55:45] shouldn't
[1:55:45] any shadow of a doubt my position in him
[1:55:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:55:50] that i know who i am and where i come
[1:55:53] from and where i'm going and what he's
[1:55:54] called me for
[1:55:55] and i'm absolutely so tired of living
[1:55:58] below that
[1:56:00] when he's called for the super church i
[1:56:02] know he's talking about me
[1:56:04] when he's talking about the restoration
[1:56:07] back to what the church was in the first
[1:56:08] place i know he's talking about me
[1:56:11] and i'm so tired of not having it
[1:56:13] friends that i want it amen
[1:56:15] i'm opening myself and saying oh god
[1:56:18] i know the possibilities have come back
[1:56:21] you're a loving father
[1:56:22] you're restoring back almighty god just
[1:56:25] take me lord let me die cut me up shred
[1:56:29] me to pieces and build me back the way
[1:56:31] you want me father
[1:56:33] oh i'm so tired friends of what the
[1:56:36] world has labeled me i'm not that
[1:56:38] what the what i've been trained to
[1:56:40] believe all my life i don't believe it
[1:56:42] anymore
[1:56:42] but i believe what the word says
[1:56:46] i can feel it i get up in the morning
[1:56:50] and shake my head and i can feel it
[1:56:52] see the problem with samson was he lost
[1:56:55] confidence in the covenant
[1:56:58] and he started becoming self-confident
[1:57:01] it's always work god's always blessed
[1:57:04] and i can play around with my
[1:57:05] consecration and it won't matter
[1:57:08] and he woke up and he shook himself as
[1:57:11] before
[1:57:11] the scripture says he said i will shake
[1:57:13] myself as before
[1:57:15] now tell me if you had never cut your
[1:57:17] hair in all of your life until you're an
[1:57:20] adult male
[1:57:21] and you have seven locks of hair all
[1:57:23] down your back
[1:57:24] tell me that you don't wake up every
[1:57:26] morning and feel it
[1:57:29] he woke up and shook himself don't tell
[1:57:32] me he didn't know his covenant was gone
[1:57:33] he knew it was gone
[1:57:34] but he thought it was him
[1:57:38] he thought he could do the job he
[1:57:40] thought he was the one doing it
[1:57:41] he forgot it was his consecration
[1:57:45] [Music]
[1:57:46] and he gets down and finally he comes to
[1:57:48] humility
[1:57:49] in the sixth seal he finally comes to
[1:57:51] repentance and recognizes
[1:57:53] it wasn't me it never was me it was
[1:57:55] always god
[1:57:58] i've got nothing to do with this it's
[1:57:59] him and in repentance
[1:58:02] he comes and he says once more lord
[1:58:07] take me to i'll die
[1:58:10] just let it come back brother bam said
[1:58:13] he felt a new shock of hair going out
[1:58:16] he said the possibilities of return
[1:58:20] all shake yourself this morning it's not
[1:58:24] you
[1:58:25] shake yourself until you feel the
[1:58:26] covenant coming back
[1:58:29] separated to him into him only
[1:58:32] consecrated to his word
[1:58:34] separated from the world living his word
[1:58:37] true to it as i know how to be
[1:58:39] feel it coming back friends when the
[1:58:42] consecration comes back
[1:58:43] the manifestation comes with it it's a
[1:58:47] promise for our day

[1:58:51] church

[1:58:55] now
[1:58:57] that you feel the shock of hair you can
[1:58:59] feel it when you shake yourself when the
[1:59:01] word's coming forth you can feel it
[1:59:03] and you believe there's a possibility
[1:59:05] how many believes there's a possibility
[1:59:07] he's a gracious god
[1:59:08] that we can come back to what the
[1:59:10] picture of of us was in his mind before
[1:59:12] the foundation of the world
[1:59:14] what the church fell from the beginning
[1:59:16] that we're coming back to that picture
[1:59:17] of a perfect church

[1:59:23] and i'm excited about the possibilities
[1:59:26] stay consecrated friends be willing to

[2:00:06] mistaking you for the same thing

[2:00:10] consecrated life under the power of the
[2:00:12] holy ghost
[2:00:12] that you walked according to the word so
[2:00:14] perfectly that when you spoke it came to
[2:00:17] pass
[2:00:19] and people were curious whether or not
