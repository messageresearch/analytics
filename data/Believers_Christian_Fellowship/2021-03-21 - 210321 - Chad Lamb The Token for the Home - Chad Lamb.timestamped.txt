[13:41] go to the word
[13:47] let's go to hebrews 11.
[13:53] hebrews chapter 11.
[14:07] okay let's read verse 28 hebrews chapter
[14:10] 11 verse 28
[14:13] through faith he kept the passover and
[14:16] the sprinkling of blood
[14:18] lest he that destroyed the firstborn
[14:20] should touch them
[14:22] let's bow our heads and ask the lord's
[14:24] blessing lord jesus we thank you lord
[14:26] for this word
[14:28] nor we just ask now as we come to this
[14:30] part of the service lord where
[14:32] there's the preaching of the word we
[14:33] pray that you would take preeminence
[14:35] lord
[14:36] and god that you would yourself by your
[14:38] own hand break the bread of life to us
[14:40] lord
[14:41] for we come to worship you to sing your
[14:42] praises to glorify
[14:44] your name and lord we come to feast from
[14:46] your hand and
[14:47] eat the fresh man and i pray you would
[14:49] provide it now lord i prayed you'd work
[14:51] through this vessel as i yield myself to
[14:53] you and
[14:53] may your holy spirit have free reign in
[14:55] our hearts and our lives
[14:57] and may you change us lord by your word
[14:59] and may you equip us by your word and
[15:01] may you grow us by your word
[15:02] we ask that you would have first place
[15:04] in all things this morning in our lives
[15:07] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[15:10] you can each be seated and when you're
[15:12] seated let's turn to exodus
[15:16] exodus chapter 12.
[15:23] and in exodus chapter 12 we'll begin at
[15:25] the beginning
[15:27] uh verse chapter or chapter 12 verse 1
[15:30] and we'll read down to verse 13.
[15:33] and for a text for this morning i'd like
[15:36] to
[15:36] talk about the token for the home and
[15:39] there's a few very
[15:40] specific things that i'd like to
[15:41] highlight and talk about for much of
[15:43] much of this will be review we know a
[15:45] lot of these things but i want to talk
[15:47] about
[15:47] the the things that we understand and
[15:49] the things we know and go over those
[15:50] things again so that we have confidence
[15:52] in what god has given us this day
[15:54] and we want to talk about the
[15:55] application of the token and the token
[15:57] for the home
[15:58] in the effect of that and we want to
[16:00] rehearse these things again
[16:02] so let's go to exodus chapter 12 verse 1
[16:04] and begin there
[16:06] and the lord spake unto moses and aaron
[16:09] in the land of egypt saying
[16:10] this month shall be unto you the
[16:12] beginning of months it shall be the
[16:14] first month of the year to you
[16:16] speak you into all the congregation of
[16:18] israel saying in the tenth day of this
[16:20] month
[16:20] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[16:23] according to the house of their fathers
[16:25] a lamb for a house and if the household
[16:27] be too little for the lamb let him and
[16:29] his neighbor next unto his house
[16:31] take it according to the number of the
[16:32] souls every man according to his eating
[16:35] shall make your count for the lamb
[16:38] your lamb shall be without blemish a
[16:40] male of the first year
[16:42] you shall take it out of the sheep or
[16:44] from the goats
[16:45] and you shall keep it up until the 14th
[16:47] day of the same month and the whole
[16:49] assembly of the congregation of israel
[16:51] shall kill it
[16:52] in the evening and they shall take of
[16:54] the blood and strike it on the two
[16:56] sideposts and on the upper doorpost
[16:59] of the house wherein they shall eat it
[17:01] and they shall eat the flesh
[17:02] in the in the in that night roast with
[17:05] fire and unleavened bread and with
[17:07] bitter herbs they shall eat it
[17:09] eat not of it raw nor sodden or all with
[17:11] water but roast with fire his head with
[17:14] his legs
[17:14] with the pertinence thereof and ye shall
[17:17] let nothing of it remain until the
[17:18] morning
[17:19] that which that which remaineth of it
[17:21] until the morning you shall burn it with
[17:23] fire
[17:23] and thus shall you eat it with your
[17:25] loins girded your shoes on your feet and
[17:27] your staff in your hand
[17:28] and you shall eat it in haste it is the
[17:31] lord's passover
[17:32] for i will pass through the land of
[17:34] egypt this night and will smite all the
[17:35] firstborn in the land of egypt both man
[17:38] and beast and against all the gods of
[17:40] egypt i will execute judgment
[17:42] i am the lord and the blood shall be to
[17:44] you for a token
[17:46] upon the houses where you are when i see
[17:48] the blood
[17:49] i will pass over you and the plague
[17:51] shall not be upon you to destroy you
[17:53] when i smite
[17:54] the land of egypt this is a lengthy
[17:58] reading but
[17:58] we want to highlight from there that
[18:01] that the lamb was for the house
[18:03] that's what the prophet or that's what
[18:05] the prophet moses here is saying
[18:06] god is saying that every household take
[18:08] a lamb the lamb was for the house
[18:10] and he said in the in verse 13 in the
[18:13] blood shall be for you a token
[18:15] upon the houses where you are when i see
[18:17] the blood i will pass over you
[18:19] we know that the death angel was going
[18:21] to strike and
[18:22] and death was coming in the land and
[18:24] this was the promise that
[18:26] if the token was applied then the death
[18:28] angel would pass over and not strike in
[18:30] that house
[18:31] and so god was giving them a a token to
[18:34] given
[18:34] a means of escape from the death angel
[18:37] but
[18:38] you know that was very natural in that
[18:40] day but it's very spiritual
[18:42] in our day because the brother banh said
[18:44] there's really only one kind of life
[18:47] and there's really only one kind of
[18:49] death and real the only real life
[18:51] is eternal life and the only real death
[18:54] amen is spiritual death amen and death
[18:56] is in the land today but there's a way
[18:58] for the death angel to pass amen
[19:00] there is something that we have been
[19:02] given amen that we can be
[19:03] applied there can be a token for the
[19:06] house and the death angel will pass and
[19:08] death will not strike
[19:10] in our lives amen the real death we're
[19:13] worried about i'm not so much worried
[19:15] about going out and
[19:16] passing away today or tomorrow or the
[19:18] next day that's not my concern
[19:21] amen because i have life and because i
[19:24] have life i cannot die
[19:27] this this body can cease to breathe this
[19:30] body can cease its existence upon this
[19:32] earth
[19:32] but i can't die amen
[19:36] but also the only real death is
[19:38] spiritual death amen
[19:39] and the only real life is spiritual life
[19:41] for eternal life and that's what we put
[19:43] all of our focus on but god has given us
[19:45] in this day
[19:46] a token a guard a true token an
[19:49] assurance
[19:50] against the death angel that's marching
[19:52] in this land amen
[19:53] and so we want to apply that with faith
[19:55] let's go to joshua
[19:58] turn forward to the book of joshua
[20:00] chapter 2.
[20:10] as i was saying this is a lot of this is
[20:12] review we've been through these things
[20:14] before
[20:15] but there's just something highlighted
[20:16] in my heart that i really want to gather
[20:18] out of this and
[20:19] and just remind you of again amen and in
[20:22] joshua 2
[20:23] verse 12
[20:26] it says now therefore i pray you swear
[20:29] unto me by the lord since i have showed
[20:31] you kindness
[20:32] that you will show kindness unto my
[20:34] father's house and give me a true token
[20:36] now rahab the harlot of of jericho
[20:40] has received the messengers that she
[20:42] received the spies
[20:44] they've brought into her house the
[20:45] message and she has received it and she
[20:47] has believed it
[20:48] and she's guarding them and now she's
[20:49] sending them out and she's asking them
[20:52] for a true token
[20:53] she's asking for the same thing they had
[20:55] a token
[20:56] that saved them in the day that the
[20:58] death angel the destroying angel was
[21:00] passing
[21:01] and brother branham tells us that joshua
[21:03] was the death angel in that day
[21:05] isn't that amazing joshua was not the
[21:07] death age but the destroying angel he
[21:08] was coming to destroy
[21:10] all the heathen but there was one who
[21:11] wanted protection amen from the
[21:13] destruction that was
[21:14] imminent in her day she saw that was
[21:16] coming amen she knew that it was
[21:18] justified
[21:19] but she wanted a protection and that
[21:20] protection would be a true token
[21:23] and she asked the messengers for a true
[21:25] token and then we go to verse 13
[21:28] and that you will have alive you that
[21:30] you will save alive my father and my
[21:32] mother
[21:33] my brethren and my sisters and all they
[21:36] have and deliver our lives from death
[21:38] and the men answered her our life for
[21:40] yours if you utter not
[21:42] this our business and it shall be when
[21:44] the lord hath given
[21:45] us the land that we will deal kindly and
[21:48] truly with thee
[21:49] then she let then she let them down by a
[21:52] cord through the window for her house
[21:53] was upon the town wall
[21:55] and she dwelt upon the wall and she said
[21:57] unto them
[21:58] get you to the mountains lest the
[22:00] pursuers meet you and hide yourselves
[22:02] there three days
[22:03] until the pursuers be returned and
[22:05] afterward may you go your way
[22:08] and the men said unto her we will be
[22:09] blameless of this thine oath which thou
[22:12] has made us swear behold when we come
[22:14] into the land thou shalt bind this line
[22:16] of scarlet thread in the window
[22:18] which thou just let us down by and thou
[22:20] shalt bring
[22:21] thy father and thy mother and thy
[22:23] brethren and all thy father's household
[22:25] home
[22:26] unto thee and it shall be that whosoever
[22:29] shall go out of the doors of thy house
[22:31] unto the street his blood shall be upon
[22:33] his head and we will be guiltless and
[22:35] whosoever shall be with thee
[22:37] in the house his blood shall be on on
[22:39] our head
[22:40] if any hand be upon him and if thou
[22:43] utter this our business then we will be
[22:45] quit of thine oath which thou has made
[22:47] us to swear
[22:49] and she said according to your words so
[22:50] be it and she sent them away
[22:52] and they departed and she bound the
[22:54] scarlet line
[22:56] in the window now we see these are two
[22:59] instances of a token that's been given
[23:00] for salvation in the face of destruction
[23:03] amen one was the token of the the lamb
[23:06] being slain and the blood being applied
[23:08] to the lentil and to the doorpost amen
[23:10] and when the death angel that was
[23:11] striking the land
[23:12] saw the token applied and it's important
[23:16] to realize that brother branham
[23:18] he was very he was very careful of in
[23:20] emphasizing that the token must be
[23:22] applied
[23:23] he said they could take the lamb they
[23:24] could believe in the lamb they could
[23:26] have the right kind of lamb
[23:27] they could see the lamb slain and they
[23:29] could collect the blood
[23:30] but if they left the blood in the bucket
[23:32] and put it by the door it would do no
[23:34] good
[23:35] because that blood had to be applied on
[23:37] the outside of the house
[23:39] and so these are important things that
[23:41] brother bram was bringing to our
[23:42] attention and we
[23:43] we want to pay attention to those and be
[23:44] reminded of them again and again
[23:46] because it was the token that was
[23:48] applied and so it was for the home and
[23:50] now rahab
[23:51] amen the harlot she sees destruction
[23:53] coming in the day of destruction
[23:55] and the day of death amen she wants
[23:57] salvation for her
[23:59] and for her family and they tell her and
[24:01] she received the message she believed
[24:03] the message she believed in the god that
[24:05] they were talking about
[24:06] and she received it by faith amen and
[24:09] then she said i want a token amen a true
[24:12] token
[24:12] and they said take this scarlet thread
[24:14] and bind it on in my window so that we
[24:16] can see it amen
[24:18] you got to put the token you have to
[24:19] apply it on the outside so that it can
[24:21] be seen and it can be visible
[24:24] and when a token is applied and the
[24:26] token is on display
[24:27] amen when the destruction when the
[24:29] destroying angel passes by
[24:31] that home will be under protection no
[24:34] death or destruction will come
[24:36] because they have a token but they have
[24:38] a token applied
[24:40] see it's really interesting to note for
[24:42] me that where did the scarlet
[24:45] thread come from amen she
[24:48] she had a scarlet thread she had a
[24:50] scarlet card
[24:51] that she let them down by amen and there
[24:54] was something that was in her house
[24:56] and i presume it was in her house i
[24:57] don't know maybe the spies brought it
[24:59] but
[24:59] but the way the text reads it looks as
[25:01] if she already had this cord
[25:03] and she let them out of the window by
[25:05] this cord so she had something in her
[25:07] home
[25:08] amen that could be salvation for the
[25:10] home when it was applied
[25:13] when it was displayed when what she let
[25:15] them down by
[25:16] amen what she aided them by and helped
[25:19] them by when they she would
[25:20] they would take that cord and bind it to
[25:22] the outside of the window
[25:24] now when the token was on display when
[25:27] the token was applied
[25:28] and on display it meant now salvation
[25:31] for this home
[25:33] so we don't ever want to we don't ever
[25:36] want to miss these points because
[25:38] they're important because
[25:39] you know it's not so much it's not just
[25:42] what we believe that matters because
[25:44] there's a lot of people who say they
[25:46] believe i believe this and i believe
[25:48] that
[25:48] i believe the message and but it's the
[25:50] application of the token
[25:52] it's the it's the token we're going to
[25:54] talk about what the token is in a minute
[25:55] but
[25:56] it's the token that's put on display
[25:58] it's the token that's applied
[26:00] and put on display and then that becomes
[26:02] the protection for that house
[26:06] so talk is cheap we can say we believe
[26:08] we can say
[26:09] that we believe we can say that uh you
[26:11] know i believe the message and i believe
[26:13] that god sent a prophet i believe in the
[26:15] message of the seventh angel
[26:16] amen but there has to be a token applied
[26:19] and that token has to be on display
[26:22] and that token is for the house that
[26:24] token is for the home
[26:27] and so these these is where i'm drawing
[26:29] my context out of these two
[26:31] scriptural passages brother bennett says
[26:33] in the message the token
[26:36] and remember israel come through many
[26:38] things but it was evening time when the
[26:40] token was required
[26:41] not in the morning not in the
[26:43] preparation the 14 days of keeping up
[26:45] the lamb israel knows something was
[26:47] coming
[26:47] so did luther know it so did wesley know
[26:50] it so did finney
[26:51] knox calvin know it this is it they knew
[26:54] there would come a time that
[26:56] the pillar of fire would return back to
[26:58] the church they know there would come a
[26:59] time that these things would happen
[27:01] but they didn't live to see it and they
[27:03] looked forward to it
[27:05] israel knew something was coming but it
[27:07] was in the evening time
[27:08] when the lamb's blood the token was
[27:10] placed on the door yet the lamb was
[27:12] already put up
[27:14] you know we've talked about this many
[27:16] times but just to bring it fresh to our
[27:18] minds and our memory amen that
[27:20] that brother brahma is now telling us
[27:23] he's going back and he's picking up the
[27:25] the he's picking up the passover and
[27:27] he's showing that there was a lamb and
[27:28] the lamb had to be kept up
[27:30] and it had to be a lamb without blemish
[27:31] and without spot it had to be kept up
[27:33] and it had to be watched over to make
[27:35] sure
[27:35] that it was a good lamb a healthy lamb a
[27:37] perfect lamb and once it was
[27:39] identified and kept up and held in place
[27:42] and proved to be
[27:43] a perfect lamb without spot without
[27:45] blemish there was no weakness there was
[27:47] no sickness there was no problem with
[27:49] the lamb
[27:50] then once that was taken that taken
[27:52] place in the evening time
[27:53] they took and they slew the lamb and
[27:56] they took the blood
[27:57] and they applied the blood the blood
[27:58] became a token and that token was a
[28:00] display on the outside of the home
[28:03] amen and that was for salvation
[28:06] so brother brahma is telling us it
[28:08] wasn't in the morning it was in the
[28:10] evening time
[28:11] and what brother ben was pointing to is
[28:12] the evening time message he's pointing
[28:14] to this day that we live in now
[28:16] and he said he goes back says luther
[28:18] knew wesley knew
[28:19] calvin and knox and finney they all knew
[28:22] this was coming
[28:24] and he says israel knew
[28:28] something was coming because they were
[28:29] holding this lamb
[28:31] they knew something was coming but it
[28:33] was in the evening time when the lamb's
[28:35] blood
[28:35] the token was placed on the door yet the
[28:38] lamb was already put up
[28:40] it's been the lamb all the way through
[28:42] it was the lamb in luther's time
[28:44] it was the lamb in wesley's time but now
[28:46] is the token time that
[28:48] each house must be covered by the token
[28:51] each house of god must be covered by the
[28:54] token
[28:55] now brother van is now he's making a
[28:57] distinction and a distinct point
[28:59] and the place we've come through the
[29:01] church ages and the time that we're now
[29:02] in he said they had the lamb and
[29:04] luther's time they had the word
[29:06] they had christ the word amen they were
[29:08] holding it up making sure it was a
[29:09] perfect word as god was building it back
[29:11] through justification and sanctification
[29:13] and the baptism holy ghost
[29:15] they were watching it making sure there
[29:16] was no blemish there was no spot
[29:18] that it was a good word it was a perfect
[29:20] word but in the evening time
[29:22] amen that lamb was slain and the blood
[29:25] that come from that lamb
[29:26] amen was going to be a token because a
[29:28] token was required in the evening time
[29:31] when the time of destruction was upon
[29:32] the earth their hat and the judgment was
[29:34] coming
[29:35] amen there had to be a token that they
[29:37] could take in display
[29:39] by an application and display that would
[29:41] mean salvation
[29:43] in that day and you know they had the
[29:46] lamb he says it's been the lamb
[29:47] the lamb's been there the word's been
[29:49] moving through amen the lamb's been
[29:51] there
[29:51] but but in the evening time
[29:55] now is the token time that each house
[29:57] must be covered by the token each house
[29:59] of god
[30:00] must be coverted by the token so when we
[30:02] talk about this token for the home
[30:04] i'm going to highlight two different
[30:05] things and they run on parallel tracks
[30:07] and
[30:08] and i hope that you can you can stay
[30:09] with me on this we want to talk about
[30:11] the application of the token in our
[30:13] homes in our homes as families and our
[30:15] homes as individuals
[30:16] and then we want to talk about the
[30:17] application of the token because it's
[30:19] very pertinent things that brother
[30:20] branham says
[30:21] in the application but also in our home
[30:25] the house of god where the the temple
[30:27] of the holy ghost us as individuals
[30:29] that's why brother branham said each
[30:30] house of god must be covered by the
[30:32] token
[30:32] that's each individual amen so if you
[30:35] sit here today and you don't have a wife
[30:37] and children or a husband and children
[30:38] this still applies to you amen this is
[30:41] for the single this is for the families
[30:43] this is for the old this is for the
[30:44] young
[30:45] this is for every age in between and
[30:46] every status of life
[30:48] this applies amen but there'll be times
[30:52] that i'm referring to family life amen
[30:54] but they run on parallel tracks they
[30:56] work just the same for the individuals
[30:58] they do for the family
[31:01] each house of god must be covered by the
[31:03] token all that's inside of it must be
[31:05] covered by the token
[31:06] and the house of god is the body of
[31:08] jesus christ and by one spirit we're all
[31:10] baptized in this token
[31:12] and become part of it that god said when
[31:14] i see this token displayed i'll pass
[31:16] over you
[31:17] what an hour that we're now living
[31:20] a blood identified identified the
[31:22] believer because the life had gone out
[31:24] could not come back so he had to have a
[31:26] chemistry he had to have a pain
[31:28] a blood a chemistry that showed that
[31:30] life went from it
[31:32] now the very spirit itself is the token
[31:35] the holy spirit itself is the token not
[31:38] the blood
[31:40] the blood was shed at calvary that is
[31:42] true but the blood as far as it is went
[31:44] back into the elements from which it
[31:45] come
[31:46] from the food that he lived on but you
[31:48] see inside that blood cell was a life
[31:50] and that started the blood cell to
[31:52] moving it was the chemistry had no life
[31:55] in it itself and therefore it could not
[31:57] move
[31:58] but when the life come into the
[31:59] chemistry of the blood it formed a cell
[32:01] it formed its own cell then cell after
[32:03] cell then it become a man
[32:05] and that man was god a manual in flesh
[32:07] but when the life returned back
[32:09] the chemistry went to it but the token
[32:12] is the holy ghost upon the church
[32:14] that they see christ the brotherhood is
[32:17] telling us now
[32:18] it's not a physical blood there was
[32:21] physical blood that was shed at calvary
[32:23] and that blood was the was the price the
[32:25] exchange
[32:26] price paid for our redemption but he's
[32:29] saying in this time in this age in this
[32:32] token time
[32:33] now the life that was inside of that
[32:35] blood
[32:36] that life has been released now he said
[32:39] in the
[32:39] in the passover all they had was
[32:41] chemistry all they could do is take
[32:43] physical blood and paint it on a door
[32:46] to make it red so that there was a
[32:47] display and application
[32:49] and that application proved that they
[32:51] were a genuine believer
[32:54] they believed the message because they
[32:56] obeyed the message
[32:59] amen we say we believe but don't obey
[33:01] then everything's in question you know
[33:03] but
[33:03] they they obeyed the message showing on
[33:06] the outside of the house
[33:08] that they believed what the prophet had
[33:09] said because they did
[33:11] exactly what he said to do they took the
[33:14] blood and they applied the blood the way
[33:16] they were told
[33:17] amen and it left a distinction a display
[33:20] of the there was a life that there was a
[33:22] lamb and that life of that lamb was
[33:24] given in exchange for redemption and
[33:26] salvation and now in order for us to be
[33:29] saved
[33:29] remember it is so important in the
[33:31] evening time when the death angel is
[33:33] passing
[33:34] is they they if they slayed the lamb if
[33:37] they took
[33:38] the perfect lamb without blemish and
[33:40] slayed the lamb and collected the blood
[33:42] amen and they kept the blood by the door
[33:45] there was still no salvation for that
[33:47] house
[33:47] although they come part way amen they
[33:49] had to obey
[33:50] every word they had to believe the whole
[33:53] message
[33:55] partial partial faith didn't bring
[33:58] salvation in that day
[34:02] but a complete faith brought a complete
[34:04] obedience and now
[34:06] there was a display of faith amen there
[34:08] was a display that that there was a life
[34:11] that was given in exchange and that life
[34:13] now is on display
[34:14] and on display the application put it on
[34:17] display
[34:17] and now the death angel would pass
[34:20] so that's why brother brahma is telling
[34:22] us now we've come to the day
[34:23] and it's amazing he said it was the lamb
[34:26] and luther's day the lamb and wesley's
[34:28] day
[34:29] he said but now it's token time
[34:32] the token the life amen the life of the
[34:36] word the life that was in the lamb
[34:38] amen the life that was in the blood now
[34:40] that has to come back upon the church
[34:42] and it has to be on display it has to be
[34:46] applied
[34:47] and it has to be on display
[34:50] brother mum said in desperations
[34:52] desperations was the evening message he
[34:54] preached token
[34:55] the first time he preached token he
[34:57] preached it in the morning
[34:58] and in the evening he comes in preaches
[35:00] desperations and in the beginning of
[35:02] that message he refers back to the
[35:04] morning message
[35:05] he says now the same thing about this
[35:09] token the token we have talked to the
[35:11] token
[35:11] all all the way along
[35:15] but now is the manifestation of the
[35:18] token
[35:20] we've talked about the token we've
[35:21] talked about the baptism holy ghost we
[35:23] talked about the life of jesus christ
[35:25] but now is the manifestation of the
[35:27] token that it has to be made manifest
[35:30] now we have sometimes allowed it the
[35:32] lutherans allowed it to accepting the
[35:33] word accepting christ's personal savior
[35:36] the methodist said when you get happy
[35:38] enough to shout that's it the
[35:39] pentecostals say speak in tongues
[35:41] then you got it and we find out that all
[35:43] of it was wrong see
[35:45] the token is the token it's you and
[35:48] christ as persons together see it's the
[35:50] holy spirit his life in you
[35:52] working his own life through you and
[35:54] it's for the rich the poor or for
[35:56] whosoever will receive it
[35:58] so now we know clearly what this token
[36:01] is in this day
[36:02] amen and that token has got to be
[36:05] applied
[36:05] it's the life of jesus christ in you
[36:08] it's you and christ together as persons
[36:10] and his life living through you and that
[36:12] has to be on display it's got to be
[36:14] applied and it's got to be on display
[36:16] on the outside of this house not just
[36:19] something we believe on the inside but
[36:21] it has to be on display on the outside
[36:25] let's turn to revelation chapter 5 and
[36:28] grab another scripture here
[36:42] revelation chapter 5 and verse 6
[36:49] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[36:51] throne
[36:53] into the four beasts and in the midst of
[36:54] the elder stood a lamb
[36:56] as it had been slain having seven horns
[36:59] and seven
[36:59] eyes which are the seven spirits of god
[37:01] sent forth into all the earth
[37:03] and he came and took the book out of the
[37:05] right hand of him that sat upon the
[37:07] throne
[37:09] brother bam was referring to the
[37:10] scripture in the breach but i wanted to
[37:11] read this scripture and show
[37:13] that that when we saw the lamb we saw
[37:17] him as a bloody lamb
[37:19] when he comes to take the book of
[37:20] redemption he's a bloody lamb
[37:23] brother ben refers to this in the breach
[37:27] the message the breach he says now he
[37:29] said the line of the tribe of judah why
[37:31] out of judah a judah a lawgiver shall
[37:33] not go before
[37:35] or between thy knees until shiloh comes
[37:37] but he will come through judah and the
[37:39] lion the symbol of tribe of judah has
[37:41] prevailed
[37:42] he's overcome and when he looked around
[37:44] to see where the lion was he saw a lamb
[37:47] strange he looked for a lion and he see
[37:49] a lamb
[37:50] the odor called him a lion but when john
[37:52] looked he saw a lamb a lamb as it had
[37:54] been slain from the foundation of the
[37:55] world a lamb
[37:56] having been slain what was it what was
[37:59] that lamb
[38:00] it was bloody wounded a lamb that had
[38:02] been slain but was alive again
[38:05] and he was bloody oh my how can you look
[38:08] at that folks and remain a sinner
[38:10] a lamb stepped up the elder said a lion
[38:13] has overcome the lion of the tribe of
[38:15] judah
[38:15] and john looked to see the lion and
[38:17] there come a lamb
[38:18] shaking blood on him wounds he had
[38:21] prevailed
[38:21] he could tell he's been in battle he's
[38:23] been slain but he was alive again
[38:26] john hadn't noticed this land before you
[38:28] know here he hadn't been mentioned
[38:30] before nowhere had it been mentioned
[38:32] john didn't see it all over the heavens
[38:34] as he was looking
[38:35] but here he come forth notice where it
[38:37] came forth where did it come from
[38:39] it come from the father's throne where
[38:41] he had been seated since he had been
[38:42] slain and raised again
[38:44] he raised up and set on the right hand
[38:46] of god ever living to make intercessions
[38:48] amen
[38:49] raised there today as an intercessor
[38:51] with his own blood to make intercession
[38:53] upon the ignorance
[38:54] of the people no that's the one i'm
[38:56] depending on he still
[38:58] was covered with bleach the bleach of
[39:00] the forgiveness of sins
[39:01] john looked at the lamb and the lamb
[39:03] looked like he'd been slain
[39:05] and then he noticed he was wounded and
[39:07] cotton bruised and bleeding
[39:09] a bloody lamb that's what took our place
[39:12] it's amazing when we come to this breach
[39:14] amen and the lamb steps forward
[39:17] then we know that he was the word made
[39:19] flesh
[39:20] amen he was the logos the word and the
[39:22] word was made flesh and he was the word
[39:24] made flesh and
[39:25] and he gave his life and he gave us
[39:27] blood amen and when the blood was shed
[39:29] the life was released so that the life
[39:31] could come back into us
[39:32] but when we look at that picture now of
[39:34] him standing there in the breach to take
[39:36] the book
[39:36] amen he's still a bloody lamb amen he
[39:39] was bloody all the way through and
[39:42] we're gonna read some more things that
[39:43] brother branham said but i want you to
[39:44] catch this image in your head
[39:46] that he was always a bloody lamb he was
[39:48] the bloody
[39:49] the bleeding lamb because we need the
[39:53] blood
[39:55] and we get to the message things that
[39:56] are to be it says oh but the other one
[39:59] is called my father's house
[40:01] i'll go and prepare a place for you take
[40:03] you out of this pesthouse and deliver
[40:05] you into my father's house
[40:07] amen there you are take you out of this
[40:08] old earthly pest house
[40:10] he's gone to prepare a place a perfect
[40:12] place where no evil exists no sickness
[40:14] exists no old age exists no death exists
[40:17] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[40:20] perfection
[40:21] and you have to be perfect to get there
[40:24] the bible said so jesus said be there
[40:26] for perfect even as your father in
[40:28] heaven is perfect
[40:29] it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a
[40:31] perf a perfect people come
[40:33] because you have to stand and be married
[40:35] to the to a perfect son of god
[40:37] and you must be a perfect bride so how
[40:39] can you do it through anything else but
[40:41] the perfect word of god
[40:42] which is the waters of separation that
[40:45] washes us from our sins
[40:46] amen that's right the blood of jesus
[40:48] christ think of it
[40:49] the dripping bloody word
[40:53] now these are statements brother brennan
[40:55] makes and just hold on to them amen
[40:57] don't
[40:57] don't try to process them on your mind
[40:59] we're going to talk about these things
[41:00] but
[41:01] he was a bleeding lamb amen and we have
[41:03] to have the dripping bleeding word amen
[41:06] amen and because there's got to be an
[41:08] application of the blood
[41:09] of the blood life the life that was in
[41:11] the blood has got to be applied
[41:13] amen so there's got to be a fountain
[41:15] springing forth in our day there has to
[41:17] be a bleeding lamb
[41:18] somewhere there has to be a fresh blood
[41:21] somewhere
[41:21] so that there can be an application of
[41:23] the blood
[41:27] the dripping bloody word amen the blood
[41:30] the word of god bleeding blood to wash
[41:32] the bride in
[41:34] he just said we're washed by the water
[41:36] of the word amen and the word was made
[41:38] flesh
[41:38] and the word bled for us the lead the
[41:41] word died for us
[41:42] amen he was a it was a sacrificial lamb
[41:44] and he was bleeding
[41:45] and as he was bleeding he was giving out
[41:47] the life amen
[41:48] and the life was coming out as he was
[41:50] bleeding so that the life could come
[41:52] back in us to be the token in this day
[41:54] and that token can be applied in our
[41:56] lives and be on display
[41:58] so it come from the bleed as he was
[42:01] bleeding amen the life was coming out
[42:04] so he has to be a bleeding a bloody word
[42:08] a bleeding the word of god bleeding
[42:10] blood to wash the bride and amen
[42:12] yes sir she stands perfect virgin
[42:14] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[42:16] first place amen
[42:17] she was trapped into it
[42:21] in the message the invisible union of
[42:23] the bride of christ is what is sin
[42:25] sin is unbelief unbelief in what the
[42:27] word unbelief in god which is the word
[42:31] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[42:34] soon for the skies amen standing ready
[42:37] think
[42:37] your garments washed by the water of the
[42:39] bleeding word
[42:41] the word become blood the word bled for
[42:43] you and you are washed in bleeding word
[42:46] now listen to what brother ben is saying
[42:48] i mean we've heard these things so many
[42:49] times
[42:50] and i don't want to become common i
[42:51] don't want to skip over it amen but but
[42:54] i want to find where that bleeding word
[42:56] is because where the bleeding word is
[42:57] there's a life coming forth amen
[42:59] because that was the purpose of the
[43:00] blood the blood came forth to
[43:02] physically pay a price of redemption but
[43:04] so that a life could come forth
[43:06] and that life could come forth and be a
[43:08] token in this day
[43:11] so it's important that the the word is
[43:13] bleeding amen
[43:14] the life of god in the word and the word
[43:16] is bled for you that you might be washed
[43:18] from the filth of these prostitutes and
[43:19] be cleansed and sanctified by the
[43:21] washing of the water of the word
[43:23] and makes your mind and heart stayed on
[43:25] god and on his word
[43:29] it's interesting to know that brother
[43:30] branham he was preaching and he was
[43:32] you i don't have notes on it but just
[43:34] comes to mind that he was
[43:36] he was talking about you know jerusalem
[43:39] was the the the the place the center
[43:43] amen of god's church the center that god
[43:46] established for worship
[43:47] and but jerusalem became the seat of the
[43:49] nominate of the denomination amen
[43:52] and man got in and corrupted god's ways
[43:54] and added his own reasoning and it
[43:56] became the seat of denomination
[43:58] for the jews and and jerusalem was in
[44:00] effect and it remained in effect until a
[44:02] change came
[44:03] and that change is when the word was
[44:05] made flesh and the word the lamb of god
[44:08] amen that taketh away the sin of the
[44:10] world that lamb was there and they were
[44:12] keeping up the lamb for a period of time
[44:14] watching him to make sure that he didn't
[44:16] fail on any of the word
[44:17] and he kept all of the commandments of
[44:19] god
[44:20] and after he was proved to be a perfect
[44:22] lamb with no spot
[44:24] no blemish amen the high priest took him
[44:27] and they slayed him he became the
[44:29] passover lamb for the nation
[44:30] amen and they slayed that lamb and and
[44:33] the blood came out
[44:34] amen for the remission of our sins and
[44:37] that life went forth amen from that body
[44:39] and
[44:39] and now you know now brother branham
[44:42] said jerusalem was in effect because it
[44:44] was established by god
[44:45] but jerusalem was in effect till that
[44:47] day and after that day then it was the
[44:50] lamb of god
[44:52] there was a change in that day and
[44:54] brother brenham comes into his day
[44:56] and he says now there's another change
[44:57] amen he said it's been
[44:59] you know it it's it's been the word it's
[45:02] been the lamb
[45:03] amen but but now they've taken and
[45:05] they've crucified afresh the son of god
[45:09] he preaches this in the indictment and
[45:11] he says now they've taken this word
[45:13] brother branham had given the word
[45:14] he had given the perfect interpretation
[45:16] the word with divine vindication
[45:18] he had been the he'd done what he was
[45:20] supposed to do as the seventh angel
[45:22] and under the seventh angels message
[45:23] there was a a revelation of the mystery
[45:26] of god
[45:28] and it was rejected and as it was
[45:30] rejected they took and they
[45:32] slew amen he says i condemned this
[45:35] generation
[45:37] for the second crucifixion of jesus
[45:39] christ
[45:40] jesus christ in what form in the form of
[45:42] the word
[45:44] he come forth in the word and they took
[45:46] the word and they
[45:47] slew it again amen and i tell you
[45:50] friends it proves that there's still a
[45:52] blood
[45:52] flowing from that lamb today and he said
[45:54] after that day
[45:56] now it's the word and the word only amen
[45:59] now it's no longer he would work through
[46:00] denominations he would work through
[46:02] systems because like he worked through
[46:04] jerusalem
[46:04] was it perfect in jesus day no was it
[46:07] perfect 20 years before he got there
[46:09] no there was corruption in it it was
[46:11] mixed amen but god
[46:12] but jerusalem was still in effect until
[46:15] they slayed the lamb
[46:17] until they took the son of god the lamb
[46:19] of god and they slayed it
[46:20] you could still find god through
[46:22] jerusalem you could still come
[46:24] in obedience to the commandments and
[46:25] find forgiveness of sins
[46:27] and all of these things because
[46:28] jerusalem was in effect until they took
[46:30] the lamb
[46:31] until they took jesus christ and
[46:33] crucified him and the blood was shed
[46:35] and the life was released and that that
[46:37] day it switched from jerusalem
[46:40] to christ to the lamb
[46:45] but in this day amen they took jesus
[46:48] christ again the word that came in
[46:50] fullness
[46:50] he was the fullness of the word made
[46:52] flesh amen and he come back the fullness
[46:55] of the word
[46:57] and they took the fullness of the word
[46:59] and they rejected it and they slayed it
[47:01] and when they slayed it
[47:02] now the denominations is no longer in
[47:05] effect these systems of man is no longer
[47:07] in effect
[47:08] now it's the word and the word only
[47:13] no more partial no more mixing now
[47:16] it's the word and the word only amen
[47:20] it's very important because after the
[47:22] crucifixion of jesus christ
[47:24] amen now to go back to the old system in
[47:27] the old way
[47:28] what was accepted and what would bring
[47:30] salvation
[47:31] and repentance and forgiveness of sins
[47:33] was no longer in effect
[47:35] and now you had to move and find where
[47:37] the life was where you could have a
[47:39] token now
[47:40] amen where you could be forgiven
[47:43] and in this day it's the same thing the
[47:46] old system is not working anymore
[47:48] amen because there's been a change at
[47:50] the second crucifixion of jesus christ
[47:52] and now it's the word and the word only
[47:55] and we've got to come to the full word
[47:57] amen to find the token to find the true
[48:00] token
[48:00] to find the assurance for salvation in
[48:02] this day
[48:04] because destruction is in the land
[48:06] judgment is here again
[48:09] there's got to be an application of a
[48:11] token
[48:12] to save us from destruction in this day
[48:16] and it has to come from the bleeding
[48:18] word
[48:21] the word was crucified in this
[48:24] generation
[48:26] but the life of the word was restored to
[48:29] the church
[48:31] the life of the word came back again
[48:36] and that is a token to the church
[48:39] it's the word bleeding the life of god
[48:43] in the word and the word is bled for you
[48:46] you know when i look at this i just
[48:48] can't help but say
[48:50] that there's a continual fountain
[48:53] that's flowing that's giving out blood
[48:57] that's giving out the life of the word
[49:00] amen is it rejected in this day
[49:02] yes is it pierced in this day absolutely
[49:04] but but through all the piercing and all
[49:06] the rejection
[49:07] amen there's a life that's coming from
[49:09] the word there's a blood that's coming
[49:11] out from the word amen that can be a
[49:12] token in this day and that token can be
[49:14] applied and the applied token is on
[49:16] display
[49:17] and it's an assurance against the death
[49:19] angels and assurance against the day of
[49:21] destruction
[49:24] but we have to have the fresh bleeding
[49:28] word
[49:31] let's go back to leviticus 17. i want to
[49:33] read two scriptures back to back
[49:35] the first one will be from leviticus
[49:45] leviticus 17 and 13.
[49:58] leviticus 17 and 13.
[50:06] we're going to read 13-14 and whatsoever
[50:08] man there be of the children of israel
[50:10] of the strangers that so join among you
[50:13] which hunteth and catcheth any beast or
[50:15] foul that that may be eaten
[50:16] he shall even pour out the blood thereof
[50:18] and cover it with dust
[50:20] for it is the life of all flesh the
[50:22] blood of it is for the life thereof
[50:25] therefore i said unto the children of
[50:26] israel you shall eat the blood of no
[50:28] manner of flesh
[50:29] for the life of all flesh is the blood
[50:31] thereof whosoever eateth it shall be
[50:34] cut off that's where this principle
[50:37] comes from
[50:38] it comes from god god is the one who
[50:40] established this he said the life is for
[50:42] the blood thereof
[50:43] and you're not to eat the the blood and
[50:45] any in any beast any animal anything you
[50:47] kill
[50:48] pour the blood out to god because the
[50:50] blood represents the life
[50:51] and god's the one who's given all life
[50:53] and you're not to take of the blood
[50:55] you're to pour it out amen because
[50:58] because
[50:59] it's the life and it represents the life
[51:01] so don't
[51:02] drink the blood let's go to john chapter
[51:06] 6.
[51:14] john chapter 6 and verse 53.
[51:21] john chapter 6 53 then jesus said unto
[51:25] them verily verily i say unto you accept
[51:26] you eat the flesh of the son of man and
[51:28] drinketh his blood
[51:29] you have no life in you now you
[51:32] understand
[51:34] now that we see the picture this is what
[51:37] jesus was talking to jews he was talking
[51:39] to jews who understood the law
[51:41] they knew what was in leviticus what we
[51:43] just read that they were forbidden
[51:45] amen to drink the blood of anything
[51:47] because the blood represents the life
[51:50] the blood is for the life and that blood
[51:52] has to be poured out and not taken
[51:54] because god gives a life and here comes
[51:56] jesus christ standing here talking to
[51:58] jews who had heard this their whole life
[52:00] and had practiced it the whole life of
[52:01] pouring it out and now he stands here
[52:04] and he's telling them i say unto you
[52:05] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[52:07] man
[52:07] and drink his blood you have no life
[52:11] in you why because the blood is for the
[52:14] life amen now
[52:15] to get the life you have to drink the
[52:17] blood amen and what is the blood
[52:20] amen the blood is for the life so when
[52:22] the blood was shed
[52:23] it represents the life coming forth and
[52:25] the life comes
[52:27] out and now you have to drink the life
[52:30] amen
[52:34] unless you drink his blood you have no
[52:36] life in you no wonder they protested
[52:40] because they knew amen they knew they
[52:42] weren't to do this because it
[52:44] the blood represents the life and it
[52:46] would be an abomination to god because
[52:48] god gave life
[52:49] amen but but it was god's life that was
[52:51] in jesus christ
[52:52] and he's standing there saying unless
[52:54] you drink my blood amen you have no
[52:56] you have no life you have no life
[53:00] unless you drink my blood you have no
[53:02] life in you
[53:06] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[53:08] blood hath eternal life
[53:10] and i and i will raise him up at the
[53:12] last day for my flesh
[53:14] is meat indeed and my blood is drink
[53:16] indeed
[53:17] he he that eateth my flesh and drinketh
[53:20] my blood
[53:20] dwelleth in me and i in him
[53:26] amen jesus knew what he was saying
[53:30] and he meant what he was saying you know
[53:33] we we know that he was the word made
[53:35] flesh and he said you must eat my flesh
[53:36] you must eat the word
[53:38] but you also must drink my blood and if
[53:40] you don't drink my blood you have no
[53:41] life in you
[53:42] it's not enough amen just to play the
[53:44] tapes and read the bible
[53:46] and agree with it but there has to be a
[53:48] receiving of the blood a receiving of
[53:50] the life
[53:50] the life has to come amen and if you
[53:53] don't drink my blood you have no life in
[53:55] you
[53:56] you can eat the flesh but if you don't
[53:58] drink the blood amen in leviticus they
[54:00] could eat the flesh but not drink the
[54:02] blood
[54:02] but now jesus is saying i am the
[54:05] sacrifice i
[54:06] am the lamb amen and now you have to eat
[54:08] the flesh and drink the blood
[54:10] because you have to have the word and
[54:12] you have to have the life of the word
[54:14] [Music]
[54:16] it was the lamb the word and luther's
[54:18] day the word in wesley's day
[54:20] but now is token time amen now you have
[54:24] to receive the life not partial
[54:28] but in fullness
[54:31] let's turn to matthew 26.
[54:46] matthew 26 and verse 26
[54:51] this is the passover meal
[54:55] jesus is in the last supper with his
[54:58] disciples
[55:01] and as they were eating jesus took bread
[55:04] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[55:06] to his disciples and said take eat
[55:08] this is my body and he took the cup and
[55:11] gave thanks and gave it to them saying
[55:13] drink ye all of it for this is my blood
[55:17] of the new testament which is shed for
[55:18] many
[55:19] for the remission of sins
[55:23] he's now sitting with his disciples and
[55:24] he's giving them bread he said this is
[55:26] my body
[55:27] amen it's not his literal body he's
[55:29] giving them a representation amen
[55:31] that's where the catholic church and so
[55:33] many have picked it up and went wrong
[55:35] amen they've made uh they've made a
[55:37] ceremony and a prayer of the priest
[55:39] amen to have an effect where it can turn
[55:42] uh pieces of bread
[55:43] or the bread into the literal life of
[55:45] the body of jesus christ so that they
[55:47] break it or they give it to you
[55:48] and you you now have received the word
[55:51] or you have to receive the body
[55:53] and they have a wine that they drink and
[55:54] now you receive the blood
[55:56] jesus was just giving this as a token he
[55:58] was giving this as a representation
[56:00] amen because that's why uh you'll just
[56:03] put it this way
[56:04] you can eat all the bread you want and
[56:06] drink all the wine you want
[56:07] amen but if you don't have that life the
[56:09] destroying angels still going to destroy
[56:11] you
[56:13] but when he says eat my flesh and drink
[56:16] my blood that means you're holy
[56:18] partaking of the lamb amen
[56:20] you're receiving all of the word you're
[56:21] feasting on the word and you're
[56:23] receiving the life of the word the life
[56:25] of the blood
[56:25] amen is coming into you and and that
[56:28] will be a token
[56:29] unto you when it's on display when it's
[56:31] been applied
[56:32] when it's on display and you will not be
[56:34] destroyed in the season of the
[56:36] destroying angel
[56:39] you got to have the right blood the
[56:42] right life
[56:44] it has to be a bleeding word i mean the
[56:46] uh it would say it
[56:47] if i could say it this way it must be a
[56:51] bleeding word
[56:53] it can't be a word where all the blood
[56:57] has already spilled out
[57:03] you understand it can't be the old order
[57:08] of just just taking
[57:11] the animal without the life but there's
[57:15] got to be a bleeding word in our day
[57:17] so that we can have the word and the
[57:19] life of the word
[57:22] we have to find a bleeding word
[57:27] it's got to be a word that's dripping
[57:29] with blood
[57:31] it's got to be the lamb that steps
[57:33] forward and is bloody
[57:35] it is bleeding there's got to be
[57:38] a bloody word so that we can receive the
[57:41] life of the word
[57:43] because we're supposed to take the body
[57:46] and the blood i hope this is hitting
[57:50] home
[57:50] i hope it's making sense i hope it's
[57:52] showing our day i want us to understand
[57:55] what we have in this day
[57:57] this this is not a sermon where i'm
[57:59] trying to get you to get to something
[58:01] i'm trying to show you what we have
[58:04] amen because we have to have confidence
[58:06] in what's been given to us and what we
[58:08] have
[58:08] amen you know rahab had to have
[58:11] confidence in that scarlet thread
[58:14] amen israel had to have confidence in
[58:16] that blood that they painted over the
[58:17] length on the door but
[58:18] they had to know that it would do the
[58:19] job amen because they had faith in it
[58:21] she had to have
[58:22] faith for the saving of her household
[58:24] amen and we have to have faith in what
[58:26] god has given us we have to know what
[58:28] god has given us and have faith in what
[58:29] god has given us
[58:30] and not chase after some other means of
[58:32] salvation and deliverance in the day of
[58:34] judgment but he's already given us what
[58:36] we have need of
[58:38] the word has been put into effect it's
[58:40] still a bleeding bloody word
[58:42] there's still as he's bleeding there's
[58:44] still a life that's coming from this
[58:46] word
[58:46] it's still a fountain that's open amen
[58:48] for cleansing
[58:49] and healing and deliverance and
[58:51] salvation there's still a fountain open
[58:53] friends
[58:55] there's still a bleeding word in our day
[59:00] in god's only provided place of worship
[59:02] the prophet says now
[59:04] there is a way a pure holy way an only
[59:06] meeting place
[59:07] that god will meet you not because you
[59:08] say god now i'm a good methodist i'm a
[59:10] good baptist i'm a good pentecostal
[59:12] no because that you are in jesus the
[59:15] word
[59:16] the part of the word that's being
[59:18] manifest today
[59:20] this day's message
[59:25] not luther wesley's pentecostal but your
[59:27] jesus the reflection
[59:29] that has come up into this you can't go
[59:31] back to that that's adding leaven to
[59:33] your bread
[59:34] amen man shall live by every word that
[59:36] proceeded out of the mouth of god
[59:38] in its season further down in the
[59:42] message god's only provided place of
[59:43] worship
[59:44] i guess further up i got them out of
[59:46] sequence
[59:47] jesus said i come in my father's name
[59:49] and you receive me not
[59:50] you want the scripture on that saint
[59:52] john 5 43 i come in my father's name and
[59:54] you receive me not
[59:56] then the father put his own name which
[59:58] is jesus in the son
[1:00:00] and he is the way he is the door he is
[1:00:02] the house
[1:00:03] he's where god chose to put his name god
[1:00:05] never put his name in me
[1:00:06] he never put it in the church he never
[1:00:08] put it in the methodist baptist catholic
[1:00:10] but he put it in christ the anointed
[1:00:12] emmanuel
[1:00:14] and the name is in the word
[1:00:18] now listen everything you do both in
[1:00:20] word and do do all in the name of jesus
[1:00:22] christ
[1:00:24] where's his name his name is in the word
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] millions of people can recite a name
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:31] they can say that name in multiple
[1:00:32] languages with different dialects
[1:00:34] they can say the name but they have
[1:00:36] nothing it doesn't produce anything
[1:00:38] amen they're supposed to do everything
[1:00:40] in that name but all they have is a
[1:00:42] vocabulary
[1:00:43] all they have is air passing over vocal
[1:00:45] cords
[1:00:47] an air passing over vocal cords won't
[1:00:49] produce anything
[1:00:50] amen it has to be a revelation it has to
[1:00:52] be the the right word and the right
[1:00:54] season in the right time by the right
[1:00:56] revelation
[1:00:57] which is faith and then it will produce
[1:00:59] what it's supposed to produce and where
[1:01:01] is the name
[1:01:01] the name is in the word
[1:01:04] so without the word how can you take the
[1:01:08] name
[1:01:11] and the name is in the word because he
[1:01:13] is the word amen
[1:01:14] what is he then the word interpreted
[1:01:18] is the manifestation of the name of god
[1:01:23] you understand what we have in this day
[1:01:27] the word interpreted we've got the
[1:01:28] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:01:30] divine vindication
[1:01:32] we have the word interpreted the word
[1:01:34] interpret is the manifestation of the
[1:01:36] name
[1:01:36] amen and it didn't change the name the
[1:01:38] name is still jesus christ we still
[1:01:40] pronounce it the same
[1:01:41] amen but it doesn't have the same effect
[1:01:44] now it comes with the life with the full
[1:01:46] revelation
[1:01:47] because with the full word his name is
[1:01:49] in the word when we have the word for
[1:01:52] our season and for our day it brings the
[1:01:54] life with it and now when we say that
[1:01:56] name
[1:01:57] it has life behind it
[1:02:00] because the word interpreted is the
[1:02:02] manifestation of the name of god
[1:02:06] not that somehow we secretly get a new
[1:02:09] pronunciation
[1:02:11] and if you hold your mouth right and say
[1:02:13] it rest right and
[1:02:16] it's the same name that we've known all
[1:02:18] through the church ages amen
[1:02:20] but now he comes in the fuller it is the
[1:02:22] mighty god unveiled before us
[1:02:24] it is god who has taken the veil off the
[1:02:26] mystery of god is now revealed
[1:02:28] and the interpretation of the word is
[1:02:29] the manifestation of the name of god
[1:02:31] and now we've got something more than a
[1:02:33] pronunciation we've got an
[1:02:34] understanding we've got a knowing we
[1:02:36] have a personal knowledge of jesus
[1:02:38] christ he's been made personal to us
[1:02:41] he's revealed personally to us
[1:02:45] and the in the name is in the word
[1:02:48] see we're talking about the token is for
[1:02:50] the home amen when we go to our homes
[1:02:52] and establish our homes on the token
[1:02:54] it's not hocus pocus it's not
[1:02:56] incantation it's not enchantments amen
[1:02:59] it's not
[1:02:59] well i believe the message everything's
[1:03:01] fine no it's got you got to have this
[1:03:03] word you've got to have this life
[1:03:05] amen it's got to be on display there's
[1:03:07] got to be an application of this life
[1:03:09] and when it's on display
[1:03:10] then the death angel will pass it's got
[1:03:13] to be real it's got to be genuine it's
[1:03:16] got to be the reality of the message
[1:03:18] not a not an acknowledgement of the
[1:03:20] message and not
[1:03:21] not being friends with the message but
[1:03:23] it's got to actually
[1:03:24] the message has got to be alive inside
[1:03:26] of you
[1:03:29] because his name is in the word i mean
[1:03:32] there's all kinds of
[1:03:33] token words given and i believe brother
[1:03:35] there was a prophet i believe this and i
[1:03:36] believe that
[1:03:37] but there's absolutely no manifestation
[1:03:39] of the life and if there's no
[1:03:40] manifestation of the life
[1:03:42] there is no guard against the day of
[1:03:44] destruction friends
[1:03:45] but it's got to be an application of the
[1:03:48] life
[1:03:48] that is on display
[1:03:55] without hypocrisy
[1:03:59] what kills families what kills young
[1:04:01] people what kills churches
[1:04:03] is hypocrisy that what happens at home
[1:04:06] is not the same as what happens at
[1:04:08] church
[1:04:09] and the things we say around believers
[1:04:11] and the way we act and the things we do
[1:04:13] is not the way we act in the things we
[1:04:15] do and how we
[1:04:17] around unbelievers
[1:04:24] we want we want a token for our home
[1:04:28] we want to bring our children under the
[1:04:30] token and we'll talk more about that
[1:04:31] later we want to bring everybody around
[1:04:33] us under the token
[1:04:34] but there's got to be a true token
[1:04:37] and it's got to be applied by faith
[1:04:41] it's got to be real it's got to be
[1:04:43] genuine it's got to be the same token
[1:04:46] at church it's got to be the same token
[1:04:48] at home because remember when we read
[1:04:50] in exodus and we we read also in joshua
[1:04:53] that the token
[1:04:54] was for the home
[1:04:58] that's why i'm so encouraged by the
[1:05:01] things that i see
[1:05:02] i was here wednesday night and wednesday
[1:05:05] night we played a tape
[1:05:07] many of you were here we played a tape
[1:05:08] we played the second part
[1:05:10] that we're listening to it is the rising
[1:05:11] of the sun and afterwards we had a
[1:05:13] worship service started singing songs
[1:05:15] and and the worship was sweet and
[1:05:17] then as we sang more songs people
[1:05:18] trickled out one by one as they had need
[1:05:20] to go
[1:05:22] and i sat over here because the
[1:05:23] atmosphere was good and i just wanted to
[1:05:25] sit and
[1:05:25] i was sitting there and worshiping and
[1:05:28] pretty soon you know another would go
[1:05:29] another would go another would go
[1:05:31] until i looked around and the majority
[1:05:32] of who was sitting here
[1:05:34] worshiping standing with their hands
[1:05:35] lifted up was our young people
[1:05:38] teenagers and young adults
[1:05:42] i said thank you god there's something
[1:05:45] real in those homes
[1:05:48] because teenagers catch hypocrisy like
[1:05:50] that
[1:05:52] i mean fast and they won't stand for it
[1:05:56] but when i looked around and i seen
[1:05:57] young men young women girls and boys
[1:06:01] mom and dad's already gone sorry young
[1:06:04] people i don't say this to make you feel
[1:06:05] bad
[1:06:06] or make you feel awkward but mom and dad
[1:06:09] was gone
[1:06:11] most of the adults were gone but there's
[1:06:14] young people standing there lifting
[1:06:15] their
[1:06:16] eyes closed heads up worshiping god
[1:06:19] that's what i want something that
[1:06:20] produces
[1:06:21] reality it's a token that brings
[1:06:24] something real into the hearts and lives
[1:06:26] of
[1:06:26] of young people our children amen not
[1:06:29] hypocrisy not a double standard not
[1:06:32] something that causes confusion and
[1:06:33] questioning
[1:06:34] amen but something that they they can
[1:06:36] look at and say that's real
[1:06:39] amen there's many many of you who are
[1:06:42] older than me has had to suffer with
[1:06:44] with children you've done everything
[1:06:46] right you applied the token at home you
[1:06:47] lived the word
[1:06:48] amen and they still left amen but but
[1:06:51] don't believe that that token didn't
[1:06:53] take effect amen don't allow yourself to
[1:06:55] believe that
[1:06:56] no matter what you see amen no matter
[1:06:57] what your eyes declare
[1:06:59] don't doubt the fact that if you lived a
[1:07:01] genuine life before them
[1:07:02] and i'm not talking about a perfect life
[1:07:04] i'm talking about a genuine life
[1:07:06] not a double standard not hypocrisy but
[1:07:08] you nobody lives a perfect life
[1:07:10] everybody fails and makes mistakes but
[1:07:12] they saw repentance they saw forgiveness
[1:07:14] they saw
[1:07:14] a dad a mom who would line back to the
[1:07:16] word and line back to the word and line
[1:07:18] back to the word
[1:07:20] if they saw something genuine if they
[1:07:22] saw a token on display
[1:07:23] amen don't ever doubt the power and
[1:07:25] effect that we'll have friends
[1:07:27] amen don't let the devil discourage you
[1:07:29] because when things get bad
[1:07:30] amen when things fall to pieces they
[1:07:33] know what truth is and they know what
[1:07:34] reality is and they know where it was
[1:07:36] real remember the prodigal son had got
[1:07:40] away from his father's love he had gone
[1:07:41] away from his father's house and under
[1:07:43] his father's protection and under his
[1:07:45] father's token
[1:07:47] but when he got down to nothing he knew
[1:07:50] he knew he could go back to his father's
[1:07:52] house
[1:07:52] there was no doubt that his father would
[1:07:54] be gone there was no doubt that his
[1:07:55] father would
[1:07:56] have backslid he had no doubt that
[1:07:57] father would have disappeared he knew
[1:07:59] dad would be there because he must have
[1:08:01] seen something real and dad
[1:08:02] there must have been a reality a life a
[1:08:05] genuineness where he
[1:08:06] knew that dad would be there doing what
[1:08:08] he's always done because dad is faithful
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:14] amen we have to have confidence in what
[1:08:15] god given us this day
[1:08:17] if we put the life on display amen and
[1:08:19] we've done all that
[1:08:20] that god had required we've done it all
[1:08:22] with the best of our heart with pure
[1:08:24] intentions with pure motives with our
[1:08:25] heart in the right place
[1:08:27] don't don't lose confidence in the power
[1:08:29] of the token
[1:08:34] it doesn't matter what we see
[1:08:37] we will see what we need to see in due
[1:08:39] season
[1:08:41] but we must believe the promise for our
[1:08:43] day we must believe the word for this
[1:08:45] day and the power
[1:08:46] that that word brings and the life of
[1:08:49] that word
[1:08:50] what it will produce
[1:08:54] so i was encouraged on wednesday night
[1:08:57] listen friends we play the tape
[1:09:00] we play the tape we didn't whoop it up
[1:09:05] we didn't we didn't preach it up
[1:09:09] we played a tape and we began to worship
[1:09:15] and there was teenagers in laodicea
[1:09:20] who would stay and raise their hands
[1:09:23] and worship god
[1:09:26] we underestimate the power of the token
[1:09:30] but let's not do it let's know what god
[1:09:33] has given us let's understand what god's
[1:09:34] put in our hands
[1:09:35] and let's have faith in it rahab had
[1:09:38] faith in that scarlet thread because it
[1:09:41] was
[1:09:41] she was obeying what she was commanded
[1:09:44] to do and when she did what they said do
[1:09:46] took it and put it on display amen then
[1:09:48] she could go run around and
[1:09:50] gathering all her house and bringing
[1:09:51] them under her token
[1:09:53] because she had confidence that this
[1:09:54] token will hold
[1:09:57] in the day of destruction this will hold
[1:09:59] amen the fathers who would paint the
[1:10:01] little and the doorposts amen
[1:10:03] in egypt that day they had confidence
[1:10:06] that the token would hold
[1:10:08] the death angel would pass and we're in
[1:10:10] a day of destruction friends
[1:10:12] and then we see destruction all around
[1:10:14] us but the destruction i'm worried about
[1:10:15] is
[1:10:16] not that kind of destruction where you
[1:10:18] lose money and there's wars and bombs
[1:10:19] are falling
[1:10:20] the destruction i'm worried about is the
[1:10:22] destruction of souls amen where the
[1:10:23] death angel is coming in
[1:10:25] and bringing spiritual death into lives
[1:10:28] what's the guard against that amen you
[1:10:30] may raise a boy or a girl to be
[1:10:31] successful in this life they may hold
[1:10:32] down a job they may be good parents
[1:10:34] they may be able to have a house and and
[1:10:36] then pay their bills and be good
[1:10:38] citizens and do all of that
[1:10:39] but if the death angel strikes spiritual
[1:10:41] death in their lives what
[1:10:42] good did it do friends
[1:10:46] but what they need is they need to know
[1:10:48] what the token is and see it on display
[1:10:50] this this is the day for the
[1:10:52] manifestation of the token not to talk
[1:10:54] about it
[1:10:55] but to manifest the token
[1:10:58] and it brings a power with it because
[1:11:01] it's the life of jesus christ
[1:11:05] he said the word interpreted is the
[1:11:08] manifestation of the name of god
[1:11:10] no wonder flesh and blood has not
[1:11:12] revealed this to you but my father which
[1:11:14] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[1:11:16] who i am and upon this rock i'll build
[1:11:19] my place of worship
[1:11:20] and the gates of hell can't shake it
[1:11:22] down amen a living church of god
[1:11:24] standing in firm foundation on jesus
[1:11:26] christ alone
[1:11:27] you can sing the song but if you're not
[1:11:29] on christ the word you're on teetering
[1:11:31] faltering
[1:11:32] sand but upon this rock christ my word
[1:11:38] let's go to revelation 19.
[1:11:45] all of these are familiar scriptures but
[1:11:48] they mean so much to us
[1:11:51] in this day that we live in they're
[1:11:52] familiar yes we know what they say
[1:11:54] but they mean so much to us let's not
[1:11:57] let them lose their meaning
[1:12:00] revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven open
[1:12:04] and behold a white horse
[1:12:06] he that sat upon him was called faithful
[1:12:08] and true and in righteousness he'd
[1:12:10] judge and make war his eyes were as a
[1:12:12] flame of fire and on his head were many
[1:12:14] crowns
[1:12:14] and he had a name written that no man
[1:12:16] knew but he himself
[1:12:17] and he was clothed with the vesture
[1:12:19] dipped in blood and his name is called
[1:12:22] the word of god his name is called
[1:12:26] the word of god and the word
[1:12:30] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[1:12:34] name
[1:12:36] he jesus christ absolutely but his name
[1:12:39] represents his person his person
[1:12:41] represents his personal presence
[1:12:43] and his personal presence is here with
[1:12:45] the word
[1:12:47] he came when the word was restored the
[1:12:49] life came back
[1:12:51] and the presence of god is here among us
[1:12:54] and the word interpreted
[1:12:56] is a manifestation of the name of god
[1:13:04] the anointed ones at the end time
[1:13:08] brother brahma says jerusalem jerusalem
[1:13:10] how oft i would
[1:13:11] would i from the beginning of time not a
[1:13:13] third person somebody else but i
[1:13:15] i would have hovered you as a hen did
[1:13:17] her brood but you would not
[1:13:19] but now your hours come see where the
[1:13:22] carcasses the eagles will gather
[1:13:24] but after the carcass is rotten then the
[1:13:26] buzzards gather see
[1:13:28] notice moses he never give the children
[1:13:30] of god moses was an
[1:13:31] eagle and he never gave the children of
[1:13:33] god noah's leftovers
[1:13:34] he had the fresh word of god the
[1:13:38] lord god met him in the wilderness and
[1:13:39] confirmed his word and sent him down
[1:13:41] there
[1:13:41] to call to call you out then they were
[1:13:44] coming
[1:13:45] impersonators around impersonating at
[1:13:47] sea but he had the word of the hour
[1:13:50] because god said to abraham the one who
[1:13:52] had the promise your seed shall so join
[1:13:54] in a strange land for
[1:13:55] 400 years but i'll visit them and take
[1:13:58] them out with a mighty hand moses said
[1:14:00] now
[1:14:00] the lord god will speak to me and show
[1:14:02] me and as
[1:14:04] told me what to do and i tell you said i
[1:14:06] am sent me
[1:14:07] i am not i was or will be i
[1:14:11] am the present tense the word now not
[1:14:14] the word that was
[1:14:15] or word that will come the word that's
[1:14:17] noun see you get it
[1:14:19] i am i am is the word
[1:14:23] let that statement soak in
[1:14:26] i am is the word
[1:14:30] he said not not the word that was or the
[1:14:32] word that will be
[1:14:33] i am is the word if i want the word
[1:14:37] and the life of the word i have to find
[1:14:39] the i am
[1:14:42] that i am is the word in the beginning
[1:14:45] was the word and the word was with god
[1:14:47] is that right i am
[1:14:48] god sent me as this prophet to vindicate
[1:14:50] this to be true i am the answer to this
[1:14:52] word
[1:14:53] to this word told me come down here and
[1:14:56] do this
[1:14:57] and when he did it pharaoh said well we
[1:14:58] got plenty of boys in our group can do
[1:15:00] that too impersonators
[1:15:02] jesus said now that's going to repeat
[1:15:03] again in the last days see
[1:15:05] claiming the same thing watch who come
[1:15:07] down first watch who stayed with the
[1:15:08] word
[1:15:09] that's it that's how it's known see you
[1:15:12] see
[1:15:13] we notice moses never give them what was
[1:15:15] noah's time
[1:15:16] we'll build an ark now because that's
[1:15:18] the word you know noah built an ark one
[1:15:20] day
[1:15:20] no vultures was eating on that
[1:15:24] let's think now think of today he said
[1:15:27] moses couldn't say
[1:15:28] and you know let's build an ark and that
[1:15:31] that's the word it it was the word amen
[1:15:34] what is the word is always the word
[1:15:36] that's the eternal word of god he don't
[1:15:38] know how to build an ark but that word
[1:15:39] was for
[1:15:40] that day and he could not bring it to
[1:15:42] this day he said buzzers was feeding on
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:46] but he started off this by saying where
[1:15:48] the carcass is there the eagles will
[1:15:50] gather
[1:15:51] not buzzards
[1:15:56] vultures was eating on that no no no
[1:15:59] this is a promised word notice
[1:16:01] for this message he had from god he had
[1:16:03] the genuine
[1:16:04] predestinated word of god for that hour
[1:16:08] neither did jesus serve them moses is
[1:16:10] left over
[1:16:12] moses had the word for that hour but
[1:16:14] moses was a prophet here is god himself
[1:16:16] see
[1:16:16] he never served them moses is left over
[1:16:20] you know how offensive that kind of
[1:16:22] statement was to the jews
[1:16:28] they studied moses and they had the word
[1:16:31] of moses and it was the word of god it's
[1:16:32] what god gave them it's what
[1:16:34] god gave them to move them forward in
[1:16:35] the program of god amen the word
[1:16:37] always came to move them forward in the
[1:16:39] program of god he would send a fresh
[1:16:41] word for that day
[1:16:42] the eagles would gather that word and he
[1:16:44] would move forward his program
[1:16:45] amen the problem was not that that was
[1:16:47] good word the problem was when they
[1:16:49] moved forward
[1:16:50] amen the life was always in the present
[1:16:52] tense word
[1:16:54] the fresh kill of the word with the
[1:16:56] blood with the life
[1:16:58] was always in present tense amen but
[1:17:00] when they would go back to the old
[1:17:02] and vultures would go back to that and
[1:17:03] you know how offensive that was to the
[1:17:05] jews
[1:17:06] it's just offensive today when say we're
[1:17:08] not going back to pentecostal teaching
[1:17:10] we're not going back to baptist teaching
[1:17:12] we're not going back to catholic
[1:17:13] teaching
[1:17:14] amen the buzzers are feeding on that but
[1:17:16] where the carcass is the eagles will
[1:17:17] gather
[1:17:18] that's an offensive statement to many
[1:17:20] but if they would just turn and look at
[1:17:22] it differently
[1:17:23] it's the most liberating statement in
[1:17:25] the world because there's a place today
[1:17:27] there's a fountain today there's a
[1:17:29] bleeding word today
[1:17:31] bleeding out life
[1:17:34] and his name is in the word and the word
[1:17:36] interpreted is the manifestation of his
[1:17:38] name
[1:17:38] amen you can have him and know him and
[1:17:40] unite with him and have his name
[1:17:42] when you have the word interpreted for
[1:17:44] your day
[1:17:47] what's been given to us everything we
[1:17:50] need
[1:17:54] neither did jesus sir then moses left
[1:17:56] over moses had the word for that hour
[1:17:57] but moses was a prophet here's god
[1:17:59] himself
[1:18:01] he never saw them moses left over but
[1:18:04] just look at the vultures there in that
[1:18:05] organization was glutting over it
[1:18:07] we know we got moses we don't have to
[1:18:09] have you he said if you'd have known
[1:18:11] moses you would know me
[1:18:12] because moses spake of me oh my
[1:18:16] where the carcass is the eagles will
[1:18:17] gather eagles the fresh
[1:18:20] kill of the word here's another one of
[1:18:22] brother benham's statements and i want
[1:18:24] it to be
[1:18:24] not just a statement we've heard but i
[1:18:26] want to come home now this morning like
[1:18:28] it's never come home before
[1:18:30] he's talking about the bleeding word a
[1:18:31] bloody word a dripping word
[1:18:34] and he's talking about the fresh kill of
[1:18:36] the word
[1:18:37] amen it all all these statements go
[1:18:39] together
[1:18:41] where the carcasses the eagles will
[1:18:43] gather eagles the fresh kill of the word
[1:18:45] the word that raised up and and fattened
[1:18:48] and made
[1:18:48] and made manifest and give out to the
[1:18:51] food for the children
[1:18:52] now the old carcass that's laid there
[1:18:54] for hundreds of years there
[1:18:55] it'll be same now luther had a message
[1:18:58] of repentance
[1:18:59] but you bunch of lutheran buzzards
[1:19:01] baptist had a message but you baptist
[1:19:03] buzzard see
[1:19:04] the pentecost had a message come home
[1:19:06] now pentecostal buzzards
[1:19:08] but where the carcass is there the
[1:19:10] eagles will gather
[1:19:11] remember you couldn't feed lutheran back
[1:19:13] in them days
[1:19:14] uh catholic a carrion no sir
[1:19:17] he had fresh meat that was that church
[1:19:20] age
[1:19:21] you couldn't feed methodist lutheran
[1:19:23] message oh no he didn't want that
[1:19:25] carrying this rotten see
[1:19:26] the life had then left it and went into
[1:19:28] something else but that's the old stalk
[1:19:30] that's dead back there the life is
[1:19:31] moving on
[1:19:32] neither can you feed the bride of jesus
[1:19:34] christ pentecostalism
[1:19:36] no indeedy maggot blown organization
[1:19:38] nothing doing no
[1:19:40] no for the promises and before that
[1:19:43] great and terrible day shall come i will
[1:19:45] send unto you elijah the prophet
[1:19:46] he will restore the hearts of the
[1:19:48] children back to the faith of the
[1:19:50] fathers again
[1:19:51] all these promises has been made in the
[1:19:53] bible i will do it
[1:19:55] and there the eagles will gather
[1:20:00] all that the father has given me will
[1:20:02] come to me
[1:20:04] where will the eagles gather wherever
[1:20:06] that elijah ministry brought us back to
[1:20:07] the faith of the fathers
[1:20:10] and there the word has been restored and
[1:20:12] the mystery of god has been unveiled
[1:20:14] amen and the eagles will feed on the
[1:20:17] fresh
[1:20:17] kill of the word and the fresh kill of
[1:20:19] the word is a
[1:20:20] bloody word
[1:20:24] there's a token available
[1:20:27] from the bloody word
[1:20:31] let's turn to matthew 24.
[1:20:45] matthew 24 and we'll start at verse 27.
[1:20:56] matthew 24 and 27 for as the lightning
[1:20:58] cometh out of the east and shineth even
[1:21:00] into the west
[1:21:01] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:21:03] man be
[1:21:04] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[1:21:07] will the eagles
[1:21:08] be gathered together this is where
[1:21:11] brother bran was talking about this
[1:21:12] scripture and where the
[1:21:14] carcass is the eagles will be gathered
[1:21:15] and you can find it again in luke 17.
[1:21:18] but when you read this it reminded me of
[1:21:20] a verse in job if you'll turn with me
[1:21:22] back to job
[1:21:35] job 39.
[1:21:43] job 39 and 27
[1:21:50] let the eagle mount up a thyme command
[1:21:53] and make her nest on high
[1:21:55] she dwelt and abideth on the rock upon
[1:21:58] the crag of the rock
[1:21:59] and the strong place now listen friends
[1:22:02] take this home
[1:22:04] where does the ego go on high
[1:22:07] the eagle maker she abideth on the rock
[1:22:10] the rock of revelation upon the crag of
[1:22:13] the rock
[1:22:14] and the strong place because christ is a
[1:22:18] uh he's a mighty tower the word of the
[1:22:19] lord is a tower that the righteous run
[1:22:22] into and are safe
[1:22:24] from then she seeketh the prey in her
[1:22:26] eyes behold afar off
[1:22:29] her young ones also suck up the blood
[1:22:31] and where the slain
[1:22:32] are there is she
[1:22:36] this is the same thing that they're
[1:22:37] saying over in matthew where the carcass
[1:22:39] is there the eagles will gather
[1:22:41] but i thought it was so interesting the
[1:22:42] description of the eagle that god is
[1:22:44] giving to job
[1:22:45] amen the eagle mounts up on high
[1:22:49] on the rock and the crag of the rock and
[1:22:51] the strong place from there she seeketh
[1:22:53] her prey
[1:22:53] where does she seek her prey from the
[1:22:55] high rock of revelation where she can
[1:22:57] see
[1:23:01] her young ones also suck up blood and
[1:23:06] where the slain are
[1:23:07] there she is where the carcass is the
[1:23:11] eagles are gathered
[1:23:13] and i want to i want to say her young
[1:23:16] ones amen she's taken her young ones to
[1:23:18] the fresh kill
[1:23:21] she has taken her young ones to the
[1:23:22] fresh kill of the word or
[1:23:24] brought the fresh kill of the word back
[1:23:26] to her young ones but her young ones
[1:23:28] amen as they're feeding on the fresh
[1:23:30] kill of the word are sucking up the
[1:23:31] blood
[1:23:33] and in our homes amen we want to feed
[1:23:35] our children the right diet amen
[1:23:38] so that they can receive the blood we
[1:23:39] want to give them the fresh
[1:23:41] kill of the word for this day amen we
[1:23:44] want to talk about the message we want
[1:23:45] to demonstrate the message we want to
[1:23:47] live out the message before them
[1:23:48] we want to bring them the fresh kill of
[1:23:50] the word so that our children can be
[1:23:52] feeding on the fresh kill of the word
[1:23:54] and that they can suck up the blood
[1:23:56] because this is a bleeding word
[1:23:58] friends the eagle the eaglets can take
[1:24:02] it amen the eaglets can receive it amen
[1:24:05] the eaglets of all the ages and all the
[1:24:07] anointings on the ages you have
[1:24:09] lion and ox and man and eagle lion oxen
[1:24:12] man start on milk but a little eagle
[1:24:14] starts on meat amen
[1:24:17] eaglets can handle the meat it may be a
[1:24:19] smaller portion
[1:24:20] it may be bite-sized they may not be
[1:24:22] able to take the portion that mama eagle
[1:24:23] can
[1:24:24] but they start on meat and they drink up
[1:24:26] the blood
[1:24:29] and in our homes and with other people
[1:24:31] amen let's give them the fresh kill of
[1:24:33] the word
[1:24:35] because it has the blood the fresh kill
[1:24:39] of the word
[1:24:40] is the bleeding bloody word the word
[1:24:42] that's bleeding
[1:24:44] the fresh kill of the word has the life
[1:24:47] of the word
[1:24:50] in it
[1:24:53] and the message the oddball brother bam
[1:24:56] says i don't believe i was ever
[1:24:58] in any sweeter worship and fellowship
[1:25:01] brother man's going to start talking and
[1:25:04] he's going to start talking about
[1:25:05] atmosphere
[1:25:08] he says i don't believe i was ever in
[1:25:09] any sweeter worship and fellowship
[1:25:11] as these songs and things that i sit
[1:25:13] there and bit my lips and shake my feet
[1:25:16] and try
[1:25:16] to hold myself back from screaming out
[1:25:19] when i heard those old songs
[1:25:21] saying in the way i think they ought to
[1:25:23] be sung
[1:25:24] and that's sung in the spirit and that's
[1:25:27] the way he ought to be sung
[1:25:29] sung in the spirit now that's why paul
[1:25:32] said if i sing i'll sing in the spirit
[1:25:34] now i can't imagine the spirit as being
[1:25:36] screaming to the top of our voice
[1:25:38] i think the spirit of christ is love and
[1:25:40] gentleness and peace
[1:25:42] and that brings something to our souls
[1:25:44] that feed us i think there
[1:25:45] that's the way them songs should be
[1:25:47] saying
[1:25:49] i'm going to go back and read this again
[1:25:50] because you can talk about the old songs
[1:25:52] that sung right in the right way they're
[1:25:54] sung
[1:25:54] in the spirit and he says i and he
[1:25:57] records paul if i sing i'll sing in the
[1:25:59] spirit
[1:25:59] now i can't imagine the spirit as being
[1:26:01] screaming to the top of our voice
[1:26:04] i think the spirit of christ is love
[1:26:06] gentleness
[1:26:07] and peace and that brings something to
[1:26:09] our souls that feed us
[1:26:11] i think there that's the way them songs
[1:26:13] should be saying
[1:26:17] and to be here with you i dedicated
[1:26:19] people to a cause
[1:26:21] cause of christ there's just so many
[1:26:23] things i could say
[1:26:25] that time would wouldn't permit me i
[1:26:28] come i thought well i'll run up and
[1:26:29] visit brother leo and the church up
[1:26:31] there and the portion of the body of
[1:26:32] christ that's waiting
[1:26:33] for his coming and part of the bride
[1:26:35] that's so joining here
[1:26:37] and how you've separated yourself from
[1:26:38] the rest of the world and come over here
[1:26:40] to live this way
[1:26:42] i was thinking even the little creek
[1:26:43] you're on the side of jordan now
[1:26:45] you're in the land here you're come over
[1:26:48] on an exodus
[1:26:49] coming out of the world into a place
[1:26:51] where you can congregate yourselves
[1:26:52] together
[1:26:53] and worship god really according to the
[1:26:55] dictates of your conscience
[1:26:57] and that's what we stand for as a
[1:26:59] democracy as a nation we stand for this
[1:27:01] very thing that each man can worship
[1:27:04] and it's just too bad we don't have more
[1:27:05] like this that's right
[1:27:07] where that let the world be in their
[1:27:09] place in god's people in their place
[1:27:11] where we can have this
[1:27:13] and i certainly if i said amen and
[1:27:15] walked out the door i'd say
[1:27:17] it would pay me every sunday to drive up
[1:27:20] here or have my children even to come up
[1:27:22] to set under an atmosphere like this
[1:27:24] because it's always the atmosphere that
[1:27:26] brings the results
[1:27:29] remember we want the token applied for
[1:27:31] the home
[1:27:32] and and brother bam was talking about a
[1:27:33] church a small group that was set aside
[1:27:36] and separated from the world and many he
[1:27:38] loved the worship and the consecration
[1:27:40] and the dedication and the separation
[1:27:42] and they had the right atmosphere that
[1:27:44] he wanted to get his children into that
[1:27:46] atmosphere
[1:27:48] because it's always the atmosphere that
[1:27:49] brings the results
[1:27:51] you can lay a seed out there in the
[1:27:52] ground no matter how much that seed is
[1:27:54] dermatized and lay it there
[1:27:55] it's got to have an atmosphere to make
[1:27:57] it live that sun has got to come
[1:28:00] a certain power before and bring it to a
[1:28:02] certain atmosphere
[1:28:03] an egg has to have an atmosphere or it
[1:28:05] won't hatch no matter how fertile it is
[1:28:07] it's got to have that atmosphere and i
[1:28:09] think that in a group like this
[1:28:11] christians hatch out are born again in
[1:28:14] such an atmosphere as this
[1:28:17] that encourages me because we can set an
[1:28:20] atmosphere
[1:28:22] we can set an atmosphere around us we
[1:28:23] can set an atmosphere in our homes we
[1:28:25] can set atmospheres we gather here in
[1:28:27] the church
[1:28:28] and if there's a if there's a fertile
[1:28:30] egg there under the right atmosphere
[1:28:32] it'll hatch out and brother branham said
[1:28:34] in a group like this
[1:28:35] christians hatch out are born again in
[1:28:39] such an atmosphere as this
[1:28:40] this kind of atmosphere i was born under
[1:28:43] no matter where i go and visit the cold
[1:28:45] world and mission fields and so forth i
[1:28:47] can even stand and close my eyes and
[1:28:48] think of this atmosphere
[1:28:50] this reminds me when i was just a boy
[1:28:52] preacher and just starting out
[1:28:53] we had a little groups to meet from
[1:28:55] house to house we separated ourselves
[1:28:56] from the things of the world too
[1:28:58] that's what made my heart the way it is
[1:29:00] today in love with christ
[1:29:02] where we can dwell together listen
[1:29:05] brother ben put a lot of emphasis on
[1:29:07] atmosphere and you cannot
[1:29:10] you cannot create a seed gene of god in
[1:29:14] your children
[1:29:16] you can't do it if it's there it was
[1:29:19] there before the foundation of the world
[1:29:21] you can't fertilize the egg once the
[1:29:24] egg's already
[1:29:25] out
[1:29:29] but if there's a seed there
[1:29:32] if there's a fertile egg there if you
[1:29:34] keep it in the right atmosphere
[1:29:36] it'll hatch out atmosphere is so
[1:29:39] important he said doesn't matter how
[1:29:40] fertile the egg is
[1:29:41] in the wrong atmosphere brother brandon
[1:29:43] said i would have given my heart to the
[1:29:44] lord earlier
[1:29:45] but i run with the wrong crowd it kept
[1:29:47] me from it he was in the wrong
[1:29:48] atmosphere
[1:29:49] but when he got in the right atmosphere
[1:29:51] he was born again
[1:29:53] and we want to keep the right atmosphere
[1:29:55] here as we congregate together as a
[1:29:57] church as we fellowship amongst
[1:29:58] believers
[1:29:59] but more importantly we want to keep the
[1:30:00] right atmosphere in our homes we want to
[1:30:02] keep the right atmosphere around
[1:30:03] us i mean if we can keep an atmosphere
[1:30:05] around us and in our homes
[1:30:07] amen the atmosphere can bring about a
[1:30:10] birth amen
[1:30:10] it can't change what was written on the
[1:30:13] land's book of life
[1:30:14] amen as far as a predestinated seed but
[1:30:16] the right atmosphere
[1:30:18] can help bring that seed to life
[1:30:22] and that's something we can do for our
[1:30:23] children is keep the right atmosphere at
[1:30:25] home
[1:30:26] not compromise not confusion not
[1:30:29] hypocrisy
[1:30:30] amen not they hear something preached at
[1:30:32] church and they go home and see
[1:30:34] something completely different amen what
[1:30:35] are we doing we're ruining the
[1:30:37] atmosphere amen
[1:30:38] we're going to hinder the birth amen but
[1:30:40] for our children's sake
[1:30:41] we can live the life and apply the token
[1:30:44] and create an
[1:30:44] atmosphere and our children can lay in
[1:30:46] that atmosphere and if there's a seed
[1:30:48] there they can come to life in that
[1:30:49] atmosphere
[1:30:57] brother graham said in elijah in the
[1:30:59] meal offering he said talk about running
[1:31:00] around with the world and flirt with the
[1:31:02] world
[1:31:02] and then expect to see angels and have
[1:31:04] miracles done it's out of god's program
[1:31:07] you must live right clean up the house
[1:31:10] clean up your habits
[1:31:11] clean up the things of the world get rid
[1:31:13] of your cards and your worldly
[1:31:14] association get ready
[1:31:16] and then the angel of god can speak and
[1:31:18] say fear not it is i
[1:31:19] then things take place but the man says
[1:31:23] we expect supernatural we expect to see
[1:31:25] an angel and hear all that
[1:31:27] when there's compromise no he says now
[1:31:29] you know listen friends i'll tell you
[1:31:32] you can get rid of everything and clean
[1:31:33] everything up it doesn't guarantee that
[1:31:35] you're gonna have a supernatural
[1:31:36] visitation
[1:31:37] but one thing brother benham said is is
[1:31:39] if you don't clean up you won't have it
[1:31:44] i want to keep the atmosphere right
[1:31:46] where angels are welcome in my home
[1:31:49] all the time i don't want to grieve them
[1:31:52] away i don't want to create an
[1:31:53] atmosphere
[1:31:54] where the holy angels of god are not
[1:31:55] welcome where the holy spirit is not
[1:31:57] welcome
[1:31:57] in me in my life in the environment
[1:31:59] around me in my home
[1:32:01] but i want an environment where the
[1:32:03] angels of god the ministering spirits of
[1:32:05] god
[1:32:05] are welcome in my home that can minister
[1:32:07] to me but can minister to my children
[1:32:15] the token he says remember there was a
[1:32:18] lot of them came
[1:32:19] by them women that night said hey gertie
[1:32:21] lily some of you come on out
[1:32:22] we're going to the party tonight
[1:32:26] huh i'm under the blood i'm under the
[1:32:28] token to stay here
[1:32:30] my love is to my baker death is in the
[1:32:32] land tonight
[1:32:33] and death is in the land today judgment
[1:32:35] is waiting she's pending
[1:32:36] atomic and hydrogens and all kinds of
[1:32:38] disaster is waiting for the nations
[1:32:40] and god is moving his church and showing
[1:32:42] all we
[1:32:43] we've been keeping the lamb up now for
[1:32:45] quite a while
[1:32:47] this is brother ramsey we've been
[1:32:48] keeping the lamb up for quite a while
[1:32:50] watching seeing what he's doing watching
[1:32:53] his nature and everything
[1:32:55] but now the token has got to be applied
[1:32:59] when brother bam come and he preached
[1:33:00] the token and when he got the
[1:33:02] desperation he said we've talked about
[1:33:03] the token all along but
[1:33:04] now is the manifestation of the token
[1:33:07] the token has got to be applied
[1:33:10] it's no more holding the lamb and saying
[1:33:12] yes this is the word this is the word
[1:33:14] and the blood is in the word and the

[1:33:19] amen that's wonderful until you get to
[1:33:21] the time where the token has got to be
[1:33:23] displayed
[1:33:24] and you can't keep holding up the lamb
[1:33:30] that was proper for a season that was
[1:33:32] appropriate action for a season
[1:33:34] but there came a time in the passover
[1:33:36] where the appropriate action was to take
[1:33:38] the life that was in that lamb and the
[1:33:40] blood represented the life
[1:33:41] and put it on the outside of your house
[1:33:43] apply it the way the prophet said apply
[1:33:45] it
[1:33:45] amen and know that the death angel was

[1:48:38] see if we have confidence in the token
[1:48:40] we have confidence in the life
[1:48:43] then we won't allow ourselves to
[1:48:47] mar that token
[1:48:51] by living hypocrisy before others by
[1:48:54] by you know if we have confidence in the
[1:48:57] token we need to live to the token and
[1:48:58] let the token be on display and nothing
[1:49:00] else
[1:49:02] we've got to be careful that in our
[1:49:03] homes we don't we have confidence that
[1:49:06] the token will work the life will work
[1:49:08] and i've got so much confidence in it
[1:49:09] that i'll preserve that life and i'll
[1:49:11] keep surrendering myself to that life
[1:49:13] i'll keep dying daily as paul said i die
[1:49:16] daily
[1:49:16] i'll keep dying paul said i keep under
[1:49:18] my body and bring it to subjection
[1:49:20] unless when i preach to others i might
[1:49:21] be a cast away
[1:49:22] i'm going to keep this thing subdued so
[1:49:24] the life of christ can come because i've
[1:49:26] got confidence in that token
[1:49:28] i've got confidence that it'll take an
[1:49:30] effect it'll create an atmosphere
[1:49:32] it'll create an atmosphere that others
[1:49:33] will come in contact with and if there's
[1:49:34] a predestinated seed there it'll have an
[1:49:36] effect
[1:49:39] and then god will do whatever god will
[1:49:40] do
[1:49:42] what's the motivation to clean out
[1:49:44] what's the motivation to surrender
[1:49:45] what's the motivation to
[1:49:46] obey you know for many times we have a
[1:49:49] motivation i want to be right
[1:49:51] i just want to go to heaven i want to be
[1:49:52] right but now the way brother branham
[1:49:54] brings it home here
[1:49:55] it's not just for me but it's for others
[1:49:57] amen
[1:49:59] when rahab got that true token amen as
[1:50:02] soon as she got that token she said i
[1:50:04] want a token amen so my
[1:50:06] family can be saved for my my mother for
[1:50:08] my father for my sisters i want them to
[1:50:11] be safe too
[1:50:12] amen her display of a toca was not only
[1:50:14] so she could say i'm safe
[1:50:15] but she knew how to get other people
[1:50:17] saved they had to get under the same
[1:50:19] token
[1:50:22] now i want to live this life i want a
[1:50:25] token for my home
[1:50:27] i want an atmosphere in this home i want
[1:50:29] an atmosphere in my physical home for my
[1:50:31] children and for my wife but i want an
[1:50:32] atmosphere in this home too
[1:50:34] amen so that there could be an effect of
[1:50:36] the life and i want to keep in obedience
[1:50:38] and keep
[1:50:39] under this body so that it doesn't mar
[1:50:41] the effect of that life
[1:50:42] why because it's not just for me it's
[1:50:44] for others
[1:50:47] it'll create an atmosphere it'll take an
[1:50:49] effect and i want to live that life
[1:50:52] i want to live that token life i know
[1:50:54] where the bleeding word is i've fed on
[1:50:56] the bleeding word i've received the life
[1:50:58] of that word
[1:50:58] and i want that life now to live out of
[1:51:00] me and i don't want anything to hinder
[1:51:02] it because it's not just so i can say
[1:51:04] i'm safe i'm okay the death angel will
[1:51:05] pass
[1:51:06] but i want my household saved i want my
[1:51:08] family safe i want my associates saved i
[1:51:10] want anybody
[1:51:11] who can believe to be saved
[1:51:15] and i want to walk in this life with
[1:51:16] confidence that greater is he that's in
[1:51:18] me than he that's in the world
[1:51:20] and believe that god will touch
[1:51:24] will reach out will have an effect
[1:51:27] through my life
[1:51:31] people are looking for something real
[1:51:36] people are looking for a real
[1:51:38] christianity
[1:51:40] a real christ something genuine in this
[1:51:43] day
[1:51:45] last wednesday when i looked and i saw
[1:51:47] those young people raising their hands
[1:51:49] no prompting no prodding
[1:51:52] no workup no fear of hell
[1:51:56] no condemnation nothing
[1:52:00] just a real genuine worship from the
[1:52:02] heart
[1:52:03] i say that's the christianity i want
[1:52:07] i want it real and i want it from the
[1:52:08] heart and you think that doesn't take an
[1:52:10] effect
[1:52:11] that takes an effect friends you think
[1:52:14] our families and our lives
[1:52:16] and it doesn't have an effect on the
[1:52:17] associates with it has an effect
[1:52:20] do you think when you go back and visit
[1:52:22] family and you're the only believing
[1:52:23] family you think it doesn't have an
[1:52:24] effect
[1:52:24] it has an effect you think when you go
[1:52:27] to work and you don't
[1:52:29] run the same shenanigans everybody else
[1:52:30] does and you're honest and
[1:52:32] you do what you ought to do you think it
[1:52:33] doesn't take an effect it takes an
[1:52:35] effect
[1:52:37] how did you come in what life did you
[1:52:41] see
[1:52:42] what influenced you i would say
[1:52:45] there was somebody around you that had
[1:52:47] the token on display
[1:52:49] i would imagine there was somebody in
[1:52:51] your life whether the parent or relative
[1:52:53] a co-worker a friend
[1:52:54] whatever it was there was somebody
[1:52:56] around you that had the token on display
[1:52:58] that's how you got to where you're
[1:53:00] sitting now
[1:53:03] did the token take effect on you yes it
[1:53:06] did
[1:53:07] will the token in your life take effect
[1:53:09] on somebody else yes it will
[1:53:12] i want to have confidence in that token
[1:53:15] because the token's for the home
[1:53:18] let's go to galatians chapter 2 we'll
[1:53:20] read this scripture and then we'll be
[1:53:21] done
[1:53:22] galatians chapter 2.
[1:53:41] galatians 2 and verse 20 i am crucified
[1:53:44] with christ
[1:53:46] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:53:49] but christ liveth in me and the life
[1:53:52] which i now live
[1:53:53] in the flesh i live by the faith of the
[1:53:57] son of god
[1:53:58] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:54:02] this life of christ is to be lived in
[1:54:04] the flesh
[1:54:06] and i say lord live it in this flesh
[1:54:08] here
[1:54:10] we found the bleeding word
[1:54:14] are you confident of that have you found
[1:54:17] the bleeding word
[1:54:19] have you feasted on the word have you
[1:54:21] ate his flesh and drank his blood
[1:54:23] if you evade his flesh and drank his
[1:54:24] blood then his life is in you
[1:54:26] if you've been crucified with christ you
[1:54:29] live but not you it is christ that
[1:54:31] liveth in you
[1:54:32] and that life is a token on display
[1:54:36] it's got to be applied it's got to be on
[1:54:38] the display but if it is
[1:54:40] it'll take effect amen let's all stand
[1:54:51] musicians if you'd come
[1:54:56] i want the word to take effect in my
[1:54:59] life
[1:55:01] we don't like put the light under a
[1:55:02] bushel basket but we put it on a hill
[1:55:04] for all to see
[1:55:05] and that's the life of christ on display
[1:55:08] we live it
[1:55:08] i see it in you i see it in your
[1:55:10] families i see it in your lives
[1:55:12] but don't doubt the effect of that token
[1:55:14] being on display
[1:55:16] it'll save if you can if somebody can
[1:55:19] come
[1:55:20] under the token under the same token
[1:55:22] with the same faith and come under the
[1:55:24] token
[1:55:24] they'll be saved too we're out there
[1:55:28] we we may you know we may be running
[1:55:31] around
[1:55:32] and saying come maybe all of rahab's
[1:55:35] family didn't come maybe they did maybe
[1:55:36] they didn't i don't know
[1:55:37] i don't know how many came how many
[1:55:39] friends how many associates but you know
[1:55:40] what
[1:55:41] some came we don't we can't control
[1:55:45] everything but one thing i can believe
[1:55:47] is that the token will have an effect
[1:55:49] that the life of christ
[1:55:50] will have an effect on the seed of
[1:55:52] christ and i don't want to doubt that
[1:55:55] i don't want to forsake that i don't
[1:55:56] want to hinder that in any way
[1:55:59] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:56:03] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[1:56:05] word
[1:56:06] we thank you lord and we ask god that
[1:56:08] you would just make it real in our lives
[1:56:12] god you had put somebody to cross our
[1:56:14] path there was somebody
[1:56:16] in our lives lord and there was
[1:56:17] something about their life that affected
[1:56:19] us
[1:56:20] whether it was a parent or a family
[1:56:23] member
[1:56:24] or friend some associate somehow each
[1:56:28] one of us has been affected by a life
[1:56:30] that was lit for you
[1:56:32] a token on display and god it had an
[1:56:36] effect on us
[1:56:37] and it brought us under and we've got
[1:56:39] the same token that they had
[1:56:42] and god now i pray lord that you would
[1:56:45] use us and use our lives
[1:56:47] wherever we go and wherever we do lord
[1:56:50] let it be your light that's shining
[1:56:52] through us and may it take an effect
[1:56:54] may it take an effect on our co-workers
[1:56:56] may it take an effect on our associates
[1:56:57] may it take effect in our families
[1:57:00] god let us have confidence in that
[1:57:03] little confidence in your life
[1:57:05] in your name for we've come to the
[1:57:08] fountain
[1:57:09] where the life is still flowing i pray
[1:57:12] god that you'd help us to feed on that
[1:57:13] life
[1:57:14] but that also our lives would make it
[1:57:16] available to others

[1:59:41] and there is a prodigal out there

[2:00:02] could he do

[2:00:05] can do but what did he do in the
[2:00:07] meantime between when his son left and
[2:00:09] his son came back
[2:00:10] no doubt he continued to pray for him
[2:00:12] but he stayed consistent amen
[2:00:15] he stayed where he was he stayed in
[2:00:17] obedience he's lived the same life
[2:00:19] that he lived when his son was at home
[2:00:22] and if you've got
[2:00:23] somebody that's there that's gone amen
[2:00:25] don't let the devil lie to you and
[2:00:27] bring doubts into your heart you believe

[2:01:10] saw the reality before
