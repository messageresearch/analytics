TRANSCRIPT
========================================
watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told them to go baptized in the name of father son holy ghost he knowed they knowed who he was look how brother benham tied this thing together he's saying now now he got a right sharp balling out from a woman because of what he had said but brother bannon prefaced what he said was this is only to my people only to those that are staying with this word and on this word the ones who are believing the manifested revealed word for the day the ones who have accepted christ amen the ones who have got who have accepted amen the word made flesh he said it's only for those people so brother brethren preface that he comes down and he says now he told peter whatever you bind i'll buy what you loose i'll lose amen that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh and he goes on to say whosoever sends your remit to them to remit whoever sends you retain to them to retain and he says not like the catholics where the catholic priest says you're forgiven and you're not and you confess it to me no he says watch it's the spiritual revealed word that did it that's why he told them to baptize that way what he's showing that the revelation of who the father son and holy ghost was he told him to baptize that way because he knew that they caught the revelation of who he was and would come preaching the right baptism and when the right baptism would only be accepted by the eagles and when it was accepted by the eagles when they accepted the word for their day their sins would be remitted it wasn't a hocus pocus or casting a spell or an incantation or you said this and i say this and you're forgiven because of this no they just gave the revelation of the word for their day what must we do to be saved repent amen and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and they accepted it they believed it and then they repented they were baptized and they were filled with the holy ghost and their sins were remembered that's how the apostles remitted sin by giving the revealed word for their day and when it was accepted and acted upon the sins were remitted how is the sins remitted in this day the exact same way it's no different the revealed word of the hour is given out amen it's accepted by faith and acted upon amen and the baptism of the holy ghost comes and the sin is washed away
