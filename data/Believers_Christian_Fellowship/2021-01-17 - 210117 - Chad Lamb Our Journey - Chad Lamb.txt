hear from him let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to john chapter 13. i have a little thought the lord has laid on my heart that i just want to express the way he's given it to me and we'll just trust the lord to lead us this morning in his word we'll look at the gospel of john chapter 13 and i'm going to begin with verse 3. jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feed and to wipe them with the towel where with he was girded this is bower heads and pray lord jesus we ask as we take this word lord and look into it i pray father that you would just break the bread of life into us that you would feed us lord on your word your fresh manna from heaven and may this word strike our hearts lord and bring forth fruit may we see what it is you want us to know in this day and how you want us to live and act and how we can represent you lord in this life we ask that you bless us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated we'll keep looking at this scripture for just a minute uh for a title i just wanted to title this our journey and i just wanted to talk about this this is uh not anything that's going to be brand new for many of you but it's something the lord has laid on my heart to share and go back over again but but when we look at this it says jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and he went to god i would say that's quite a revelation jesus had come to quite an understanding quite a revelation where he knew that the father had given all things into his hands i mean that's a position friends that's a absolute amazing position to be in where the father has given all things into his hands and he knew that he come from god and he went to god and when we look at revelation and the effect of revelation you can see right here in the scripture you have a revelation in the effect of that revelation and the effect of the revelation it says he rises from supper and laid aside his garments he humbled himself because you know uh you're we're striving in this life to be like jesus he was an example to us of a son of god and the son of god was the example and laid the example down for us and he had come to the to the end of his ministry here and he knew that the father had given all things into his hands he knew that he came from god and then he goes back to god i'd say that's a that's an ultimate revelation amen and that's the revelation in the end time the same revelation that god has given to his bride amen because she's a joint heir of all things whatever he inherits she's a joint heir with christ and we know that in this day he's called us for those that overcome to sit on this throne with him as he has overcome and sitting his father's throne and that we are a joint heir and given a position and that we've been given the revelation in this hour that we come from god and that we go to god and the effect of that revelation was not arrogance it was not pride amen it was not it was not puffed up he didn't go to build a kingdom on earth for himself amen the the very effect of that of that revelation was that he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded that very revelation i mean it's amazing how the bible's written i always love how the bible is written it refers to the fact that he knew these things and as he knew these things he rises from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself and what did he do he became a servant of all the highest of revelations produced the greatest amount of humility the highest rev the highest of revelations brought him to a place where he would serve his brethren and he would serve his brethren who have not yet come to the same revelation he's come to boy if we could just take this attitude it would it would really deal with a lot of divisions that have been in the message in the past and finding that i have this revelation and now you have to come up to my revelation jesus didn't act that way jesus had the ultimate of revelations and the ultimate of revelations would give him the ability to condescend amen to come down to humble himself to unrobe himself to take a servant's towel amen to pour water into a basin and begin to wash his brethren's feet because he knows as much as he is the word amen they must be a manifestation of the word too and so what is christ doing christ is serving the word amen he is serving the word and and and and he was not writing them off for not having the right revelation i mean just just days before this they're fighting about who's the greatest in the kingdom i mean he's going to come to peter and peter has not yet caught the symbology of what's happening and the effect all around him and he's forbidding jesus to watch his feet i mean he's still immature he's still not to a place where he should be and jesus just washes his feet and he says what i have done you don't understand now but you'll understand later and i if your lord and master have washed your feet you ought to wash one another's feet this is why we have feet washing but not just for once a month to get our feet wet that's the symbology that's the that's that's the sacrament that he's left us so we can stay in the right frame of mind all the time to remind ourselves that we're here to serve one another we're here to serve the body of christ and so now we we see that jesus has i would say an ultimate revelation that's just my phrase that's not anybody else's but he has an ultimate revelation that god the father has given all things into his hand and then he come from god and he goes to god that to me is an ultimate revelation and in that revelation he begins to act with humility to serve the rest of the body the rest of the word with humility and patience and giving himself for them i say god that's the approach i want to have that's what i want more than anything i want that life of christ to be in me i'm so tired of old human natures i want it all to die and i want to serve god now we just started here because i want to talk about our journey for just a minute because this revelation that jesus came to was not only for him it was for the rest of the body as well and we've come to the hour where god has opened these things to us so that his bride can realize that she's come from the same place he's come from and i want to talk about that for a minute in the message the fifth seal when we go to the fifth seal brother bannon starts off with this prayer i'm just starting right at the beginning of the fifth seal paragraph one i'm just going to read this prayer to you it says let us bow our heads now for prayer gracious heavenly father the almighty god who brought again jesus christ from the dead and has presented him to us in this last day and the power of the holy spirit we are grateful for these mighty visitations of the immortal god and now father we are facing another hour an hour which might change the eternal destination of many people and to approach this lord we are insufficient because it is it is in the scripture that the lamb took the book and opened the seals o lamb of god come forward we pray we call on you lord the great redeemer come forth and show us your plan of redemption that's been hid through these years breaking this fifth seal for us tonight so brother branham now he knows what the fifth seal is because an uh angel came early in the morning and revealed it to him the morning of this day so he knows what the seal is and now he's praying and listen to how he prays he's saying lord you must come and break for us this fifth seal to show us your plan of redemption that's hid through the years breaking this fifth seal for us tonight father and revealing what's beneath that seal for us so he who's he's speaking to he's speaking to the gentile church is that right and he's speaking to the gentile churches gathered to the message he's speaking to the bride and he's talking about the fifth seal and he's saying lord break this fifth shield to show us your plan of redemption father in revealing what's beneath that seal for us so there's something beneath the fifth seal for the bride hang on hang on with me that we might go listen that we might go away better christians than we are now so there's something under the fifth seal for the gentile bride that will help them go away and be better christians than we are now it might be better fit for the task that lays ahead we ask it in jesus name amen so those of you who know the fifth seal and we've studied the seals and we know we know these quite well but under the fifth seal when brother ben begins to preach about the fistile he starts to show that this fiscal souls that are under the altar amen and they're crying out how long o lord until they'll avenge us of our blood then brother ben begins to break this down and he begins to show that the mystery under the fifth seal is that these souls under the altar are jews they're not gentiles they're they're jews they're crying out for vengeance and he says the the gentile church does not cry out for vengeance they cry like stephen father forgive them and he's showing that that this group under the altar and he says now they're under the martyr altar they're under the sacrifice altar and he says the they're the jews amen that the jews that have died from the time of christ on and he's showing that because they held the word of god and their testimony he said not the testimony of jesus christ but they held the word of god in their testimony amen they were under grace because their names were in the lamb's book of life and god had to blind those jews he had to blind them so that he could get a gentile bride because his heart purpose the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing amen and he had to fulfill his own word he had to turn from the jews to the gentiles but because there was predestinated seed that was laying there and was going to come through that way amen those whose names were on the last book of life he had to blind them so that they wouldn't accept it because if they would accept it he would not have been justified in turning to the gentiles so because he blinded them because he forced a blindness upon them he is justified amen in acting in grace to give them white robes because because they did not reject the word on their own they were blinded by god so that god could fulfill his own purpose so we understand this this is the this is the the fifth seal the fifth seal motherboard says this is the revelation under the fifth seal amen and uh that that and they were given white robes and they said you must wait until your uh your fellow servants the brethren must be slain as you are and he's referring to the 144 000 that will be killed during the tribulation period and so he's laying all this out under the seal but remember there's a mystery under that seal a plan of redemption that that has something to do with us not just the jews i hope you can understand what i'm saying because the whole time brother is preaching he's laying this down it's jews it's jews and we understand they were blinded for us we understand that they're given white rose because of god's justice because he blinded them he can give them white robes and they were in the lamb's book of life they're in the book of grace amen they're part of the plan of god we understand all that but then there's something else for us and let's turn to second corinthians we'll lay this scripture in here ii corinthians let's go to chapter five lay this down and then we'll start moving forward we've addressed these things before none of these is brand new i just want to go over it again as we move forward here i want to lay this good foundation second corinthians 5 2 corinthians 5 1 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven and there's a reason i went to this scripture because in the fifth seal brother better refers to this scripture when he gets to the end of the fifth seal and in the fifth seal he's coming down towards the end and he says all of that that i just said about the jews he talks about the the group that was persecuted under eichmann hitler and stalin those that come from christ all the way through this time that held truth to the word of god and their testimony they were true jews and they held true to what they had and then he says now my times exactly up so he's done with the physio maybe or he might just be done with the jewish part right my time is exactly up if i let out a little early but i got a few more little things to say if you can stand it i know it's hot and i'm sweating but listen i just got something to tell you it's so good it's just burning right in my heart i hope you haven't forgot it see let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let me see my people not long ago in white robes you remember you remember the story not long ago the gentile bride there there now they all was in white robes amen so brother bam is coming to the end of the fifth seal and he tells us all about the jews and all about the blindness and the white robes that will be given to them and a future tents and and he talks about their position and all that but then he says but there's something burning me up that i gotta get to you under this fifth seal now if i let out early but but if i got some more things to say if you just let me go he's not done amen preaching john was able to look over and he was able to see his group under the sacrifice altar but brother branham said god let me see my group one day amen i seen them and they was already in white robes amen they already amen had bodies they were already in a place they were already gathered together and he says just burning me up to get this i hope you remember not longer the gentile bride there there now they always in white robes and he goes on down in paragraph 445 said notice the bible says if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved that's why i read that scripture he brings it up in the fifth seal if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where i seen those saints what did he see the saints he's seen them in their theophany bodies he's seen them in their body amen their eternal body he's seen it and brother benham is placing this under the fiscal because remember his prayer all the way back at the beginning of the physio he said lord show us your plan of redemption lord and give us something that we have need of now to help us know how we need what we need to do in this end time let me read that again because i just butchered it he said show us your plan of redemption that he's hid through the years breaking this fifth seal for us tonight father and revealing what's beneath that seal for us that we might go away better christians than we are now might be better fit for the task that lays ahead there was a great revelation there that brother branham is trying to show that that the bride amen but the the the the bride the gentile bride the predestinated seed of god already has a theophany already has a theophany body and he saw his gathered over there amen and there's a great mystery there that for us now that helps us to be better christians and prepare us for the task that lays ahead there was some revelation we needed at the end time for the task that lays ahead and we needed to know amen we didn't need to be stuck in denomination hoping someday that we make it and we're good enough and we've believed the right thing and accepted the right thing and by our accepting and knowing and our merit and the right church and the right plan of salvation that we can finally get somewhere but there's a revelation that we needed to catch in this end time to be better christians and we needed it now and we need it for the task that lays ahead and we needed to know that i'm not going to arrive i've already arrived because i have a body eternal in the heavens and i can't be the right kind of christian now in the environment that we're moving into and i can't be prepared for the task that lays ahead if i'm still under a denominational system of hoping someday i'll get to the judgment and find out i'm okay we needed something different in this hour we needed to know the plan of redemption in a greater way we needed to realize amen that i come from god and i go to god we needed to realize something more than what the denominations were teaching and i still say friends without that revelation we can't be the right kind of christian now and we can't be prepared for the task that lays ahead because things are dark amen things are not they're not getting easier they're getting more difficult and i don't know how much more difficult they may get and then short term long term long term we know they'll get more difficult yet we don't know how the cycles will cycle and and and how they'll ebb and they'll flow we don't know but we do know that there's a lot of prophecy that the brother venom laid down about tightening up and squeezing and persecution he laid down a lot of that as a foundation and we don't know what part of the cycle we're in and where and how all of that works out to the detail but we know one thing for the task that lays ahead we have to know this under the fifth seal amen that that i have a theophany i already it's already there i'm not hoping to arrive i've arrived friends amen and i arrived in the thinking of god before i ever started i had arrived amen i'm on i mean the redemption plan of god goes in a great big circle because eternity goes in a circle and i arrived when i was there with god before the foundation of the world when he was there alone with his attributes when he wasn't even worshipped as god yet i was there amen i come from god i go back to god and what about that god giving all things into my hands he's given it to the hands of my husband and i'm becoming one with my husband so i have no need of nothing amen so we see brother branham under the fifth seal when he got to the end he had something he just was burning to get to us praise god i'm going to read this again at the end of the fifth seal if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where i seen those saints see watch when a baby excuse me sisters for this plane talk before a young a woman but look when a mother has conceived and that little bunch of muscles is twisting and jumping you understand it is a natural body and just as nature is performing the natural body did you ever notice your wife before the little one was born she always right along at the last becomes real sweet if she hasn't been all her life hopefully she has been all her life if she hasn't been all her life she will be then did you ever notice how saintly or kind of a feeling you notice a mother and you see some sinner out there making fun of a mother that's a pregnant woman i think that's ridiculous that's life coming to the world but did you notice around the mother seems to be a sweet feeling what is it it's a little spiritual body spiritual life waiting to come into that little body as soon as it's born brother tells us that's a that's a carnal spirit a spirit of the world spirit of the earth that's going to go in now it's only begotten but when it's born it's born the spiritual body unites with the natural body and then the bible teaches that we are now begotten of god so brother branham is taking the same analogy to us that we now by the new birth are begotten of god we're begotten of the holy spirit that in us is christ the son of god being formed in us and when this earthly body is dissolved now he's talking about now the baby that was in the mother when it come forth there was a there was a a spirit of the earth a carnal spirit to catch that baby but now he's saying there's were begotten of god within this earthly tabernacle is christ growing a son of god is forming in us and when this earthly body be dissolved this spiritual body comes from the bowels of the earth now catch this this spiritual body comes from the bowels of the earth from what earth from this earth what is it it's a spiritual body something is quickened to life amen there's a new creation amen the sea gene of god has come to life and when this body is dissolved that spiritual body which is nothing more than your regenerated soul the seed life the seed of god come to life that spirit body comes from the bowels of the earth there is another body waiting to receive it what's that your theophany if this earthly tabernacle was dropped there was another body to receive it that's the bodies that brother branham saw amen those saints that were coming to hug him that's where they had went amen but what life did they take there amen they took the life of the zoe life of god that was in their soul that had been quickened to life by the new birth amen in that spiritual body when this earthly tabernacle dissolved that spiritual life went into another body and that was your theophany body he's still in the fifth seal this is what we need to know to be better christians amen to be prepared for this day if this mortal body i'm sorry if this earthly tabernacle was dropped there was another body to receive it this mortal body puts on immortality this terrestrial puts on celestial see what i mean there is a natural body that's sinful but in its making just like it is another body that we go to and i'm so grateful to god that i can say as your pastor and brother i seen those people so help me in that body and handled them with my hands this is a revelation to us under the fifth seal we needed to know about the jews we needed to know about how the jews were going to be redeemed god turning from the jews and blinding them we needed to know those things that's part of the plan of redemption that's part of the the seed that's in the lamb's book of life but there's a part in there that we need too under the fifth seal to recognize that we're not striving to make something we've already made it amen we're trying to surrender to the life that's in us to be formed into the perfect image of jesus christ we're not hoping to be something someday we're not hoping to make it somewhere someday we're not hoping to make it to heaven but if there's a seed gene of god birthed inside of me there is a part of me a body that this life goes through that's already made it in heaven it's already there i'm not trying to get to heaven there's a part of me that's in heaven and that's a revelation we need in this hour that's a revelation that we need to be better christians in this hour amen so that we're not tossed about and hoping and struggling but there's got to come a revelation of quickening to take all the fear and the scare away brother rem says in the rising of the sun and one day when i was weary myself i said if boy you'd better go ahead if you're 50 years old if you're going to do anything for the lord you'd better hurry up and do it brother brett was speaking about the same experience when he went beyond the curtain of time and seeing those those saints said you're getting old and there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain of time and i seen all of you over there no i i i i'm not even going to try to explain that statement i'm just going to believe it he's talking to a group of living people on the earth do you believe that it's in the message the rising of the sun he's saying i was there amen i was i was i was saying to myself you're 50 if you're going to do anything you're getting old and he tells the story many times and he's caught away amen beyond the curtain of time and he said that and there that morning that quickly power come and he let me look over the curtain and i seen all of you over there he was talking to people who hadn't died yet but they were over there brother bam said it looked like there was millions he said there's millions i couldn't see amen i'm not going to try to explain the statement i'm just going to say what the prophet said and say i believe this amen i believe when he said it to that group i believe he meant it amen i don't understand it i don't know how it works mechanically but i know it works and i know it's true and i know that this revelation is what we need to be better christians and be prepared for the what lays ahead and we're gonna we're gonna read some things that support this statement brother bram said and who is this melchizedek he said then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to but a man called it a natural body that's really interesting because it's made in the fashion of this one only this one at your best 19 to 20 years old amen in a perfect condition what god the image god had of you in his mind before the foundation of the world amen and he saw that he saw that body and he calls it a natural body because brother branham was always afraid to die remember he said i didn't want to be a spirit or a spook i didn't want to float by ormond neville and there i knew it was him some way of knowing it was him but he had no hand to shake his hand was rotten in the grave and then had no i couldn't hug his neck i couldn't say god bless you brother we would just be two spirits two vapers missed these are different ways he describes this brother bam didn't like that he he he he's always known as a man he's always interacted as a man and that's what brother ben was talking about now he was so happy when he over there and he found out there's a body in fashion like this one and brother man calls it a natural body one that you can touch you can shake you can feel shake hands feel it hug its neck talk to it see the face see the resemblance the facial structure amen have have visual recognition have understanding of who it is that's the mystery under the seventh or the fifth seal for us a natural body further in who is this melchizedek he says see he had become here and was part of the word he's speaking of samuel now when the witch of endor called up samuel he'd become here and was part of the word entered from the flesh life back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world he entered into the theophany which was the word you get it that's where all believers go when they turn from here and then another paragraph down he says now notice praise god for these opening seals is my prayer to know these things brother brahma gets so excited because he says this lays under the opening of the seals this understanding to know these things what happens to us where we come from where we're going amen all about our journey in life that's what he's preaching on and who is this melchizedek so that we would understand our journey in life again in who is this melchizedek he says here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember you join the church and join that church you try this and nothing satisfied that's right but one day you just recognized it and from here brother bam starts going to the story of the little eagle in the chicken yard he tells it over and over again this little eagle was hatched out under a hen and tried to act like a chicken thought it was a chicken until one day it heard an eagle scream and when it heard an eagle scream it recognized whatever that is i am amen there was a familiarity there was a sense of belonging there was an understanding that was in the scream that wasn't in the clucking of the chickens so brother man says one day you just recognize and then he goes right into that story then after that story he says then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the living god by the new birth you've been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany if this body be dissolved we have one waiting brother bam goes through the same scripture that he did in the fifth seal amen he says when when you you just recognize it one day you heard an eagle scream you recognize it he said when you when you when you recognize the very word of god was eagle food you left the other thing then you have been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany now this is what i want to point to pointing back to what he said and it is the rising of the sun when he says i seen all of you over there because if you're going to hear from your theophany amen you have to have a theophany to hear from if you're going to hear from your theophany there must already be a theophany for you to hear from before while you're still in the chicken yard before your new birth amen when you're still confused about who you are when you're still in denominational system still eating meal worms and crack corn when you're still there amen you have to hear from a theophany that must be there while you're still here before you're born again [Music] so it had to be there to call to you you had to be there for you to hear from it and there has to be a way in which your theophany communicates to you and i'm not going to explain that either because i have no desire to get off into some some ideas of man i'm just going to say i heard from my theophany i heard from my theophany amen and i recognize when i heard from my theophany i recognized that this was eagle food i recognized that i was an ego i left the others and was formed into the living image of the living god i heard from my theophany so now you can see why brother branham can come to a crowd of people amen who have heard an eagle scream and have gathered to a ministry and they're sitting there and he said i've seen all of you over there they have to be over there amen there's nothing to hear from nothing for them to gather to if they didn't have representation in heaven these are just the words of a prophet we know that body is eternal in the heavens and that body is your body i'm not like i said i'm not going to try to explain everything because when we try to start explaining everything we're going to start arguments we're going to get into tangents and we're going to get something wrong amen because the carnal mind is trying to understand something so far above the carnal mind but i'm just going to tell you i heard from my theophany and without that all i would have heard was noise the chickens heard an eagle scream but they weren't an eagle so they ran and hid from the very thing that was calling out the eagle amen there was nothing in me to go and hide amen there was something in me that said what is that what is that that sounds so familiar amen that's that's what i've always wanted to be a real christian when we saw the ministry of brother brandon when we saw that life on display amen you can say that's what i always wanted to be a real christian amen like that a real one that believes the word a real one that stands on the word a real one that has manifestations in their life a real christian that's what i want to be one that's honest one with integrity one that stands on the word one that not back down for one iota that's what i want to be a real christian and this eagle may not even know the terms it may not even know how to describe it i remember whatever it heard was what it was down deep on the inside and i know that i heard from my theophany and so many times i think the mistake we make is trying to explain what brother branham was saying in a mechanical way and i have no desire to explain it in a mechanical way i just want to accept it the way he said it when he come to those people who were gathered to the word he said i saw you all over there when i saw the theophanies and i saw the bride i saw you over there amen and when you heard the eagle scream and you recognized this eagle food and left the others you were formed in the living image of the living word you heard from your theophany and i want to say that's the truth brother because that body is eternal in the heavens and it's waiting for me now i want to i keep moving because remember i'm talking about our journey jesus now in the beginning of our the scripture reading from when we first began this morning he knew that the father had put all things into his hands and he knew that he come from god and he knew that he went to god he had come to what i was just calling an ultimate revelation but that ultimate revelation gave him a certain conduct a certain attitude a certain approach and i would like to say the same thing is true today we saw it in brother branham did you see it did you see the ultimate revelation bring a response bring an attitude bring an approach an approach to people who disagree with him approach the people who didn't understand him approach who were more spiritually immature than him is that right we saw it we saw it demonstrated that was what that was part of the attraction amen for us it was not just the miracles the signs and the wonders amen that was to get our attention amen but there was a life amen there was other people that could do miracles maybe not as much and maybe not to the same degree but there was other men out there that could work miracles there was other signs there was other healings but there was something about that life that voice that life that was on display that was different than all the rest there was a son of god that had come to maturity and we heard that eagle scream and that's the life we wanted brother ram says in the message god does god ever change his mind about his word he said it started at the beginning when the natural and spiritual yet cain and abel worship the same god they both built the same kind of altars and they both worshiped the same god at the same church same altar but cain by carnal reasoning brought in the fruits of the land and laid them upon the altar as a sacrifice thinking that surely that this would answer to god for an atonement now i'm talking about our journey so i want us to back up because i i i started at the finish line because the finish line is the starting line i hope you understand where you started is where you finish so the starting line is the finish line so i had to start at the end because the end is the beginning now let's drop ourselves down now that which was part of god an attribute of his thinking that it has come now and was sown into the earth and now is is there in a human heart amen with spiritual amnesia not aware amen not awakened to who it really is but they're living a natural life in the chicken yard all right now we're all in the chicken yard the seed the egg whatever has been taken down and placed on earth and now it's coming forth and and trying to live like a chicken and he starts comparing this to cain and abel cain uh laid upon an altar of sacrifice thinking that surely this would answer to god for an atonement and i'd like to say any of us who were christians before we came to the message did this very same thing this wasn't just unique to cain but this is how i tried to serve god this was my approach to god trying to to do things for god trying to earn his favor trying to be right do right and he said surely that that this would answer to god for an atonement so he must have brought in as people think today apples that adam and eve took and caused them to sin and whatever i think now they got it down to pomegranate or something now someone said not long ago it was something else but abel had the right sacrifice he know that it was blood that did it so he brought a lamb and when god received his now abel by faith by revelation no other way there was no bible written so you see the beginning of righteousness is god's revealed truth i'm going to i'm going to read that slowly again so that we can catch it because for us we were going through the motions doing what the chickens did in the chicken yard trying to be a christian because there was something in our heart that longed for god amen your brother man said remember that little spark of life was down in there then amen you wanted to go to church you want to do that but nothing yet would quite satisfy some of us remember what that was like amen amen and trying and going about and doing like the rest of them do and make things nice and do good works and all of this but nothing would satisfy until something you heard amen you heard a word and there was a revelation that clicked in your heart and said this is it and abel was waiting upon god he had no bible to read amen he had no bible to read he had no church to follow amen he was waiting on god for the proper way of worship and god gave him the proper way of worship he gave him a revelation of what really took place in the garden of eden and he knew that it was blood and it would only take a blood of an innocent one to atone for his sins and so when god received his now able by faith by revelation no other way there was no bible written so you see the beginning of righteousness is god's revealed truth the beginning of righteousness is god's revealed truth amen they were sown in unrighteousness amen they were born wrong there was a fall in the garden they were cast out of the garden but the beginning of righteousness was god's revealed truth amen and the entire church of the living god is built upon that amen upon that upon what upon upon the the god's revealed truth that's the beginning of righteousness and for us when we were out living however we were living unaware of what was the truth amen but when we heard the truth and something resonated in us we came to it for us that was the beginning of our righteousness let's go to hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11. we know these things quite well but it's good for us to rehearse these hebrews 11 4 by faith abel offered in god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous that the right revelation acted upon was evidence that he was righteous listen this is amazing no bible no church to follow amen but he caught the right revelation and that rock revelation when he acted upon that revelation it showed that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh so let's take that to ourselves friends because really we we were born no different than anybody else right you come of a father and a mother you were born and some of us were born into all kinds of different situations we were born into good homes bad homes broken homes homes that were intact we we were born to parents who loved us parents who didn't maybe love us we were born into a safe home or an abusive home we all come the way the world comes you understand i mean it's not exclusive just to the world and just you know the bride always comes nice no we come to this world like everybody else comes to this world amen and when we come to this world amen there's there's what is the separating factor amen amen there's there's seeds sown into the earth some of these babies that were born amen have a sea gene of god inside and some do not and what's the separating factor friends what is going to prove where righteousness really lays amen it's going to be the ability to catch revelation and act upon it that was the beginning of righteousness all the way back in the beginning and it is still the same thing today god is not changing his ways amen his ways yet remain the same there is an ability in the sieging of god the children of god to catch revelation from god and to act upon that revelation and when they act upon that revelation it's a testimony that they are righteous god ever keeps his plan the same he ever remains the same from the beginning of the book to the end of the book he remains the same let's go to romans chapter 4. romans chapter 4 let's look at verse 16. therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not that only which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all so god was going to make the requirement faith so that it could be by grace so that he could give it to the seed to make sure the promise would be sure to the seed of god through the seed of the faith seed he had to make it by faith amen so it could only be apprehended by faith because only the seed of god had the faith to believe in the revealed word of god so that it could be by grace he made it by faith that it could be by grace so that the promise would be sure to deceive verse 18 who would get well let me finish reading 16 sorry the faith of abraham who is the father of us all 17 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore was imputed to him for righteousness what was imputed to him what was put on him for righteousness the fact that he believed that god would do what he said he would do the fact that no matter how weak sarah got how weak he got how long it took he didn't grow weak through unbelief but he grows strong in the faith amen and it was imputed unto him for righteousness it was put on him for his righteousness that he believed god see god's not changing his ways we are children of abraham by faith amen and god is doing the same thing for us let me keep reading now verse 22 and therefore it was puted unto him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification so this isn't just a special uh appointment or imputation for abraham so abraham believed so abraham believed god he believed that what god said god was able to do no matter what the circumstances or what the time frame was he was still capable of believing god and that was imputed unto him for righteousness it declared that he was righteous so now if i want to be like abraham i have to believe that god was going to give abraham a young body or give abraham a seed and you understand that was the promise for abraham's day and abraham believed the promise for his day what god spoke in his day and it was imputed unto him for righteousness it was a declaration that he was righteous amen but i can believe what god did in abraham's day amen but for me to have righteousness imputed unto me i must believe the word that's given to me today billions believe what abraham believed because it's already happened amen billions believe that that abraham had a son in his old age and that son was isaac and he became a father of many nations amen that's easy to believe because it's already happened amen but in abraham's day that wasn't so easy to believe he only had capacity to believe it because he was a seed of god because he was the elect predestinated for that day he had the ability to believe that word that day and when he believed the word for his day what god had told him that day and revealed to him that day when he believed that it was imputed in him for righteousness but not for him only but for anybody that will believe in god that means i have to believe god present tense amen not believe what he was or what he did but believe what god is and what he's doing amen see that's why uh hebrews says those that without faith it is impossible to please god for those that come to him must believe that he is present tense that god is well i believe god exists and i believe no i believe he is he is what he is the word he is the word made manifest he is present today he is moving today he has word that's being fulfilled today he is today and i believe it is today i believe the i am god not that i was god or thy will be god but we believe the i am god that god is he is today he is present today his word is manifested today he is doing something today he is working today and we believe that today so it wasn't just imputed to abraham for abraham alone but for all of us who would have the same kind of faith that abraham had it's easy to say oh i believe what abraham believed and you know i believe you know what peter believed because he saw jesus die on the cross and i believe that but what about today do we believe the god that is i'm going to continue on with this quote now i stopped this was out of does god ever change his mind about his word i stopped with the statement there was no written there was no bible written so you see the beginning of righteousness is god's revealed truth oh i love that statement there's something to it friends there's something more than i can express now with words but the beginning of rice's is god's revealed truth and god still has a revealed truth for us and the entire church of the living god has built upon that so i i read these two scriptures and i'm going to finish this this quote jesus one day coming off the mount said to disciples who does man say that i the son of man am one said you're moses and the other one said you're elias and you're jeremiah's or one of the prophets he said but who do you say that i am that's when the apostle peter inspired of god quickened by the spirit made the tremendous statement thou art christ the son of the living god notice the statement blessed are simon son of jonas flesh and blood has not revealed this to you my heavenly father has revealed this to you thou art simon upon this rock what rock now the catholics say upon peter the rock little stone and the protestants say upon christ the rock not to be different but it was upon the revelation that peter had who he was no man can come to me said jesus except my father draws him and all the father has given me will come to me thou art christ the son of the living god blessed out there simon son of jonas flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it spiritual revealed word of god [Music] because if we if we just take the statement and we just repeat what peter repeat repeated for that day and we say thou art christ the son of the living god and and then we we can say what peter said we can recognize that jesus in the bodily form was christ the son of the living god and he remains yet today christ the son of the living god amen you can say what peter said amen but but we can be in a day now to say what peter says and reject what god says now puts us in a bad place but we have to accept what peter said we don't reject peter we accept what he said but we have to accept the same spirit of revelation amen that moved upon peter to recognize the word in his day the same spirit of revelation has to move upon us to recognize the word for our day. and if we can recognize the word for our day we can have the same reward amen that the church had then we can we can be said blessed art thou and upon this rock the rock of what the rock of the revealed word the spiritual revealed word of god that's what the church is built upon that is the foundation because the beginning of righteousness is the word of god revealed and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone he's talking about the truth in the bible it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone it only picks up the predestinated seed that god predestinated before the foundation of the earth the same thing came through in the days of noah same thing came through in the days of moses days of elijah days of prophets days of jesus on down to this very hour it's been the same story all through the bible cain and abel but you go all the way down through there was a there's always been a seed of god on earth that's able to catch what god's doing in their day and by that there's an imputation of righteousness and their sins are not imputed unto them we're going to read some more things but but we have to understand this is the journey of our life we come from god and we go to god and we come down here in flesh no different than anybody else but there was something embedded down in us that was different there was a life form a part of god a gene of god a part of zoe life there was something in us that was different and that something in us amen was was whatever the word is it was whatever god was it was it was a peace of god it was a part of the word amen and god put it there and embedded it there because he wanted a world filled with sons and daughters he wanted to have fellowship with his attributes upon the earth and he's got a plan of redemption that will explain display all of his attributes his healer redeemer father a restorer he's going to he's going to display all of this amen and he's not going to lose himself and he's not going to lose his plan and he's not his plan is not going to be thwarted so god is going to divide himself his attributes and he's going to place that down inside of his sons and daughters because he knows that when that piece of the word comes in contact with the word for their day that's going to be like a lightning strike amen it's going to bring life to it and this is our journey friends we're not sitting in this church because we're lucky we never heard the message because we were in the right place at the right time the truth is you were in the right place at the right time but it wasn't by happenstance it wasn't by luck and then it wasn't by your or your proper thinking god placed you where he placed you he made sure he watched over your steps until he could get that lightning strike to hit the right spot amen he he knew where he sowed his seed and he knew what bed and ground it would come forth and what time it would come forth and he had to make sure that he got the light to strike the seed he had to get the conditions right he had to get the atmosphere right he was working amen to get it right because he would impute righteousness because the beginning of righteousness is the word revealed amen and he would know that i can declare them righteous i can put impute righteousness upon them i can dissolve all of their sins when they believe me amen and the message jehovah jireh 1964 he says now listen close to this quote now we notice no matter what the others done how they walked away those disciples were predestinated they were ordained to eternal life you know what i love i love it when life gets so rough and churches get so bad that you have a golden opportunity to walk away you might think that those things that happened in the past were horrible those things that we went through and falling away and splits and and and whatever doctrinal fights and all of that but what i love is the fact that god has so much confidence in the seed that he'll put that seed and it can go through what the disciples went through everything can go wrong it can go upside down it can go backwards but i thank god that no matter how many things went wrong amen there's something amen there that will recognize the word and stay with it through it all even without the ability to explain what's happening there's things happening we don't understand what's happening amen things went wrong we made it still to this day not be able to explain what went wrong in the situations in the past but it doesn't matter amen because god's got a seed that'll go through all of it amen and it'll come forth like gold this is the journey of our lives friend amen it's not that we had a pristine life or a perfect life or that everything we ever ever everything we went to do turned out right and it all came out gold and every church we were part of was wonderful but it just goes to prove that there's something in you that when the circumstances go wrong you still believe when other people fall away you still believe amen when they say horrible things about you and what you believe and about the messenger you still believe amen because there's the there's a receiver on the inside to receive truth you believe because of that not because of your mind and not because of the circumstances around you you don't believe and listen our children are not going to believe because we made everything perfect around them and they had a perfect youth group and they had a perfect church and they had perfect opportunities and a perfect camp and a perfect fellowship and a perfect desk that's never going to produce faith amen because they can go through the most imperfect of the imperfect situations but if there's a seed of god on the inside when they hear that word they're going to say that's it that's the truth no matter how imperfect it is and it's not that we're going to try to sow our seed to troubles our children to trouble to prove them i'm not proving that god will do the proving we protect them we feed them we give them the word amen we shelter them amen but it's not going to be that that produces life it's only going to be if there's life already on the inside and when word comes the word and life comes to life it'll quicken the life he says now the disciples were predestinated others done how they walked away that those disciples were predestinated they were ordained to eternal life no they couldn't explain it they couldn't explain it no more than the rest of them could but there was something in them that representation in heaven [Music] there is something in them that representation in heaven a thought that god had of them before the foundation of the world and manifested itself here and they were connected with god and was sure that was god's promise vindicated and nothing is going to change it from them i'm going to read that again because of the next statement so i'm going to leave you in anticipation brother is getting ready to say something wonderful but he said there was something in them that representation in heaven a thought that god had of them before the foundation of the world and manifested itself here and they were connected with god and was sure that was god's promise vindicated and nothing is going to change it from them that's real genuine christianity what's real genuine christianity a representation in heaven a connection with god that's real genuine christianity see listen brother branham wasn't making it about actions and about conduct and about about you know they went to the right church and they believed the right thing and they did all this those things are important friends i'm not discounting that but real genuine christianity is being connected with god coming from god having heavenly representation having a capacity to receive the word when everything around you is falling apart and when you have no explanations for anything when everything was falling away and those few disciples were holding on amen they had a connection with god they had representation in the heavenlies a thought of god that was manifested and that was true christianity and see we we sometimes want to make true christianity i'm good to my neighbor and i and i worked at the soup kitchen and i did those things and there's not one thing wrong with those those are good things and if we all did them it wouldn't hurt us one ounce but that's not true christianity true christianity is coming from god going back to god amen being a part of god amen understanding the word of god by a revelation from god that is true christianity see i want to i want to talk about our journey because that's the revelation that brings life and that's who we truly are and that's true christianity and i try to i'm trying to paint the picture separate from merit like i did this and i did that and i go here and i i pay my tithe and i do that and that's not true christianity true christianity is is being connected to god and having representation in heaven and believing the word that's true christianity now all those things are outcroppings of true christianity i hope you can understand that so you can have the outcroppings and not have the genuine thing amen the important part is to know we got the genuine and the life on the inside will produce all of those things but we can't get the cart before the horse friends we can't you know i think so many times that we've gotten discouraged over the years because because true christianity was painted as a as a set of uh conductor actions right uh works let's say these certain works are true christianity and if we do all of these works we're really christians and if we have these manifestations in our life we're true christians but you can have some of those things in your life or have many of those things and not be the genuine article and we've seen it amen we've seen people with gifts and abilities and kindness and good temperaments and paying tithes and spiritual gifts and they'll turn and walk away from the message and call the prophet a liar and say it's not true there was no new birth there there was no baptism of the holy ghost there so you see what looked like true christianity we've seen it with our own eyes friends what looked like true christianity proved not to be true christianity it was a masquerade of christianity so that's why we've got to move away from the works amen and get down to the reality of what true christianity is it's a revelation that i come from god i go to god it is a revelation that i am now connected to god where's the connection i don't know i can't show it to you i don't have the cord or the certificate but there's a connection between me and god and god has a way of speaking to me and there's things that i know that have come from god and i know this message is true i know this was god's prophet and i know i'm a child of god see that revelation has to come apart from merit and the reason it's got to come apart from merit is because we live in this life and we've got a sticky caulker-borne nature and there's traps set for us and we're going to fall into them those are all things the prophet of god said and even the prophet of god fell into one of those traps when he had lawyers and he was getting tired because of a tax case and he got his wife to lie to the to the uh to the lawyers for him and if we were basing true christianity off america there's no way you could look at that and say that was true christianity but how could you look at that prophet say he wasn't truly a christian so we've got to separate the two just temporarily not for a long term we've got to get the first things first i want to know who i am by a revelation from god i want to know who i am because god told me who i am i want to know this message true because god told me it's true because something in me quickened the life that there's a reality inside of me there's a matching part in me for this message for this revealed word of the hour it's a matching part but there's a matching part in me and we click together like a hand in the glove like two puzzle pieces locking together this mystery revealed and the mystery in me locked together like two pieces of a puzzle that's what we have to have established and that is that is the foundation for us amen that's the foundation we're put on that's the beginning of righteousness is believing the word for your day that's real genuine christianity now don't think i'm done i'm not done hang on and the fifth seal we're going back to the fifth seal brother braham said the one the ones that the lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's block no the sacrifice altered the martyrs but had received white robes by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word and we'll say it again because sometimes first time we miss pieces but they weren't under the sacrifice altar this bride the group i saw but had received white robes how do you get those white robes amen by living right doing right being nice treating my neighbor good going to the right church and paying your tithe no you get the white robe by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word i have accepted the living word amen and that's the pardoning grace in my life it's a sign of righteousness imputed unto me he will not impute sent to me because i believe him amen i believe him as he is i believe him the i am i believe him today i believe him now i believe jesus christ present tense so they had white rose by accepting the pardoning grace of the living word in luther's day they accepted luther's message in wesley's day they accepted wesley's message but in our day we've got to accept more than luther's wesley and more than wesley's message we have to accept the message for our day and that's our pardon grace of the living word in future home brother bram says now you say well look at this priest wasn't he a son of god he proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what did he say i believe the bible sure but he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour brother baby said those priests you couldn't touch their lives they just lived such a life you couldn't touch their lives the morality their obedience they meant all the things that they've done their piousness and all of the religion and then you couldn't touch their lives but he says was he a son wasn't he a son of god he proved he wasn't a son of god how did he prove he wasn't a son of god by rejecting the word when he was faced with the word he rejected the word and he proved he was not a son of god no matter how much he looked like one he wasn't one he says i believe the bible sure he couldn't recognize the expressword of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that he had been back before him that's a zinger think about it all he had was an intellectual learning from some group that had been back before him we could be standing in the same place today we could have an intellectual learning of a group of people that was back before us that saw the prophet and saw all the miracles and we're in the meetings and could tell us i had this happen to me and i saw this and my friend was told where he lived and my this and this and that amen and if we're not careful we could all we could have in the message today is an intellectual learning of somebody back before us but that won't produce for us anything more than it produced for the scribes and priests and pharisees sadducees in that day amen we have to accept the living word today for ourselves and it's the same thing today see i know that's strong but it's the truth there was the word as spoken exactly for that day and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholar he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination what is it the link with god the representation in heaven my predestination he had all the credentials he had a good life he had morality he had faith in the bible he believed amen what what had happened in the days before him he was a good boy but what he didn't have was representation by predestination he had everything else friends he he has things you and i don't have but he didn't have representation by predestination he didn't have representation in heaven he wasn't from the thoughts of god amen we've got something different than what that priest had and what we have gives us the ability to say that ain't nothing but the truth when we listen to brother branham on tape say when you heard the eagle scream you recognized it was eagle food and left all the others you've been turned into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany you can say amen amen when you're looking listen to brother branham look look at a group of living people and say i was over beyond the curtain of time and i seen them all over there and i seen you all over there you can say that's nothing but the truth why because i got something the pharisee doesn't have i got something the theologian doesn't have what i have is i have a connection with god amen i've got a link to god i've got some way to hear amen some connection to the heavenly to the eternal that says that's true when the prophet says something in your heart it says that's true and he says something else it doesn't matter what your head your head can be saying what where was that i didn't hear that scripture amen don't tell me mine's the only head that does that i'm going to have to go back and pray now your head your head can be saying your mind you're into like me saying what scripture is that i don't think he quoted that scripture right i don't remember it that way but didn't he say over here this way your head can be doing that but something in your heart's saying amen amen amen that's the truth explain it to me i don't know but it's the truth hallelujah if we got that friends we should have confidence amen we should be happy people we should say praise be to god but i got this problem in my life and i and i don't seem to overcome amen just focus on the thing that you got amen and the thing that you got will change everything else we spend so much time trying to be a pharisee that we won't be a disciple look at peter trying to compare his life with the pharisee peter the ignorant unlearned fisherman who really couldn't keep his mouth shut and got himself in a lot of trouble even with the lord imagine him trying imagine him trying to compare himself with judas you see this is where we make our mistake we don't put our focus on the most important thing we get deceit by the devil to try to become a pharisee i don't want to be a pharisee i want to be a real raw rugged true believer and i want god to take that life that's inside of me and i want him to live his own life in me i don't want to decide what he wants i don't want to try to be something i'm not i want the reality living in me to push out and make everything the way god wants it he didn't have i'm still in future home talking about this priest he he still didn't have representation of predestination see only the predestinated will only be the one who does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you got eternal life you had to be part of god at all times because he's the only ones eternal then he goes through trying to do god's service he says he only reveals his word in the predestinated now listen listen what he said he didn't say to the predestination catch this quote exactly he said he only reveals his word in the predestinated is he revealing his word in you amen that's the point today amen we can have an intellectual understanding of what happened before us and miss what he's doing today because he's here in the formation of the bride amen he's here revealing his word in the predestinated and the predestination can catch it and the message only god's only provided place of worship now think these men who was they called and was put in his condition these pharisees by jesus said in vain you worship me worship him genuine worship true worship from their hearts catch that in vain you worship me why teaching for doctrine or tradition of man therefore you make the commandments of god of no effect to the people if i taught you methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bride time amen if moses taught the message of no it would take no effect if jesus taught moses message it would take take no effect because the predestinated cedar laying there will only be watered by the type of water that was give for that seed it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition that grows it see good church attendance and a good this and a good that won't do anything it's got to be the revealed word of the hour if there if you're a child of god predestinated for this hour there's a portion of god laying in you a seed a part of the word that's laying there and that part of the word is meant to be expressed in this hour it wasn't for noah's day it wasn't for the methodist day it wasn't for the pentecostal day it was for this day 2021 don't say i was born out of season don't say it was better back then don't say i wish i would live some other time you be grateful that you've got something in you to live in this day there's something in you that can take all the nonsense amen all of the darkness and all of the confusion and all the different messages that are out there but there's something in you that can navigate all of that because god ordained it for this hour to be watered by the word that's falling in this season to bring it to life and that's the only thing that'll grow that seed you see we want to grow in christ we want to be more like him but so many times we're using a human effort to be more like him we're straining and we're pushing and we're trying to be self-reformers and you know there's nothing wrong with recognizing this is wrong i'm not going to do it there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with recognizing you can recognize you know what this app on my phone is a problem for me i'm going to delete it there's nothing wrong with that that's good i encourage you to do that but if that's all you have that's not it we can delete them all amen we can all go back to dial phones we can all go back to rotary to be even safer but unless there's a seat on the inside it's going to amount to nothing unless there's something on the inside that'll catch the word amen and be birthed by the word and catch the word and grow by the word amen the word what word the word for this day amen will grow the seed that's predestinated for this day and so that's what we need is we need the word and we need more of the word and we need more of the word preached in revelation for this day amen that's what we need friends to grow this seed the the human efforts have failed us for how long how long how how how tired have we become pushing i want to i want to when i get to this level when i'm like this when this is gone when i no longer struggle with this listen friends we're focusing on the wrong thing the devil is putting a carrot on the end of a stick amen just to get you to march around and get really tired i would say the thing that grows the seed inside of me if there's a seed in me that was built to overcome 2021 then i want that seed to grow now how am i going to get that seed to grow well in 2021 we should probably do this and this is probably a better activity than forget it friends feed it the word for this hour amen feed that seed all of the water and all of the light that god is dropping down from heaven for this very hour he has anointed the preaching for this hour he's anointed a message amen it's laying on tape for today it's there friends it's there he put things there 60 years ago that were for today you believe that he's not bringing another message we don't need new tapes we need the same tapes because there's something laying in that tape for today because god knew this messenger this latter rain that would fall would be the final rain that would come all the way through to the harvest so he had to drop it all in this rain so it's all there amen but god amen through gifts in the body is taking and pulling it out and saying look it's there it's there it's there it's already there he already told us what to do he already told us how to overcome we need to feed on this word and then let the seed grow because there's already listen god's not surprised that 2021 is difficult god's not shocked that everything's falling apart it's amazing how sometimes we have to catch ourselves friends we we as human beings we have to catch ourselves and remember i have a father like i have a father i don't have to worry i don't have to make plans for myself i don't have to become a prepper i don't have to get a bug out bag and right i hope you don't think you need to do all those things because i have a father two sparrows are sold for a penny and not one falls to the ground but my father knows it see the lily neither toils nor spins but solomon in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these do you think he doesn't know how to take care of you he can care for the sparrow and the lily how much more can he care for you jesus trying to teach his disciples he says go forth into the cities two by two and take neither script nor bag and only one change of clothes and you're going to find out that my provision is enough we live in an hour where we're trying to find out what do we do with our money and do we need a steward of this and what's going to happen next and what what's what's the conspiracy what's the government up to listen we're going to waste our time protecting ourselves providing for ourselves amen listen god's got it already programmed in he already has the solution he already knows and guess what he's already programmed it into your spiritual dna the overcomer is in you amen by the new birth the overcomer's there inside of you he's built you for this hour he's built you to overcome and if it goes worse from here he's built you for it so we need to stop looking around and reading articles and preparation how to prepare what we need to do is be feeding on the word amen so this seed can grow and grow and grow and bear the fruit that it's supposed to prayer in this atmosphere remember certain seeds only come forth in certain times do you believe that wheat comes forth at a certain time barley comes forth at a certain time your corn gets planted at a certain time you have an early season and a late garden and you understand certain seeds comes forth at a certain time well the seed was in you was only ordained to come forth in this time so the attributes that are locked inside of you that god wants to express can only be expressed when things get bad brother chad hey listen the millennium is coming don't try to live it now it's coming amen there's certain things there there's been a bride there's been a chosen predestined people reserved for this hour why wasn't i born 100 years ago because what's in you needed to be expressed in the time that you live and if the condition gets worse out there then it's only god making the season right for the seed to bear fruit i want to bear fruit well you know you're the kind of seed that only bears fruit when everything else goes dark and winter out there or however god wants to do it in your life i don't know but we keep thinking it it's got to be a certain way no it's got to be the way that he predestinated for it to be we've got to quit trying to achieve and gain and fix and and just focus on the word and let the word do all the work in our lives that the revealed word that god has given to us let it bring forth the fruit let it grow the seed let it let it bring forth the overcomer that's already on the inside ii peter 3 18 says but grow in grace and in knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen see we have to catch a revelation of who we are we have to catch a revelation but we have to grow when we catch this revelation it doesn't mean that we're done but we're growing into the image of jesus christ we're growing something's growing within us for a manifestation and we grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord brother rem says in things that are to be said i got the baptism in the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of god and that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there you grow up from there you grow up amen first don't try to grow up until you've caught the revelation of who you are and been born again by the spirit of god get the first things first and from there grow up then you're a son and daughter of god you're a child of god and these things as you come up like the mother now you're in the bowels of the earth trying to come forth you're a son of god coming forth and you see the word say i shouldn't do this i should be born again. and he goes on to talk about you just come to the word you don't reject it you grow up and the message things that are to be again he says we as an as an old man a minister i preach around the world got millions of friends but i know i've got to stand with you yonder get away from the things of the world and if there is something in you that you still want to act the way you act if you do have the things of the world and you remember you're none of god you're just a church member until that call that deep calling to the deep you're until you get a deep calling to the deep you're just a church member but once you get the deep calling to the deep you might still go to the same church but you're not just a church member anymore remember once the deep calls to the deep once the deep calls you out amen you're not just a church member anymore from there you grow up like before there was a listen like before there was a fin on a fish's back there had to be a water for him to swim in first or he'd never have a fin before there was a tree to grow in the earth there had to be an earth there would have been no tree to grow in there would be no reason for the tree and to make it coexist before there was a creation there had to be a creator blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness see there is something in us if there's something in us that's longing for god there had to be a god first to long for if there's something calling out for righteousness and a manifested life there has to already be a manifested life if there's a life of christ to be lived it already has to be available or we wouldn't even have the desire for it so we get to realize that we're created for that amen and god has put a matching part in us and a desire in us for what's attainable but it's going to take the word let's go to ephesians chapter 4. we're going to wind down and i'm going to read this scripture in another couple quotes ephesians chapter 4. ephesians 4 and 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god and to a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of them and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ so we are growing up friends we are growing up to be just like christ growing in the head to be him in christ the mystery of god revealed he says god is known by simplicity and of the revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person not your theology it's a revelation of jesus christ upon this rock i'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things no other things accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new birth he's born in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people but they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of us not even called to it at all watch god's great revelation unfolding he says again in christ the mystery of god revealed now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no not nothing else follow him you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she is ripening ripening into christ-like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him hope you see it i want to take this and i'm going to go all the way back to john 13. when jesus knew that god had given all things into his hand and he come from god and he went to god he laid aside his garment he took a towel and he girded himself he poured a basin with water and he began to wash the disciples feet he had come to ultimate revelation and ultimate revelation put him in service for his brother brought him into humility to express the word of god see when we come into christlike ripeness brother ben says we're growing and ripening into christ-like fruit the light is at the top of the tree and it's not going to bring forth an arrogant showmanship an attitude of exaltation and self-exaltation that is not what this life is going to produce we've come to the revelation of who we are we come from god we go to god and god has made us joint heir of all things it doesn't bring a condescending attitude it doesn't bring a self-righteousness it doesn't bring an arrogance amen what it does when it ripens it ripens into christ like fruit bringing forth the same mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him i hope you see it and i want to say i hope you see it i hope you see it all around you i hope you see it in the bride of jesus christ i hope you see it because if you don't see it we're looking at the wrong thing if we don't see it growing in our brothers and sisters we don't see this christ-like nature this humility this sweetness this gentleness this obedience to god this humility this desire to serve the word if we don't see it and of all we see is arrogance and contention i say god that's not the seed you planted but you planted a bride to be just like you you planted a bride to to be just like you amen the feminine version of you upon the earth and i want to drink the water i want to lay in the sun until it bakes out all the greenness and brings me to that ripe life what i saw on the prophet i want to see in me we saw miracles and signs and wonders i would love to see that daily in my life but if i had that and still had an arrogant spirit if i had all the signs and all the wonders and i still uh i was still bitter and harsh towards my brother and sister and i still was arrogant and rude and i had no humility and no sweetness i would say god take the gifts and give me your life your attitude your approach i want to live the way christ lived i want to live the way i saw him live in that prophet i want to grow up into that amen not i don't want to come like the rich young ruler i pay my tithes i've kept all the commandments see the rich young ruler he was trying to prove that he was a christian i paid my tithe i i i attend the church i've done all of the commandments and jesus says one thing that lack what did he lack he lacked a pure love for god when it comes down to it he says he says what must i have to have eternal life i mean that's the greatest thing ever he had everything else he had he had his religion in a bag and he had everything else he said what can i have to inherit eternal life he says one thing that lack is sell all that thou has given to the poor and come follow me and i shall have treasures in heaven and he went away greed because he had much treasures see what he lacked was a pure love for god he had religion he had a desire to serve god he wanted to look right he wanted to be right he wanted to make sure he was going to get eternal life he desired eternal life but he didn't desire god because if he wanted to know how to please god if god come and says this is how you please me sell everything he should have been thrilled that i got the answer from jesus christ he told me what i must do and if this is what god wants happy am i to do it for him i don't want to be like the rich young ruler lord i've paid my tithes and i've been faithful to the church and i listen to a tape every day but i want the genuineness of my heart i want the reality of the message in me i want to be whatever this message is supposed to be i want to be the example of that i want it to flow out of me i want it to live out of me i want to i want to grow into christ like fruit baked into the ripeness of the sweetness and melaness of the spirit when the people can look at you and they say well you know they may not know very much but they're sure are nice people do they know there's something different that is christ and they attracted to christ brother says in the message it is the rising of the sun and i want to finish with this quote it is the rising of the sun now the very essence of the message that was sent he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to that's the part i want to end with we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to if we don't like the reflection the question is what are we pointing to what are we focused on what do we focus our time and attention in our mind and our energies what are we what are we focused on are we focused on the right thing because if we get focused on the message it'll reflect if we get focused on other things it'll begin to reflect we say we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he's the only one and the only one that was lot that has life he that has the son has life and in the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived oh that's the key friends yeah i want to do amen we want to do everything jesus christ did then we've got to be pointed to jesus christ the manifest word for this day same life he lived if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of that one man into the other he would absolutely be that type blood and if your spirit that's in you is wrecking dead and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you romans 8 11 said if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body that same life that same power is the same beneficiaries that he had here on earth from god he redeemed you and a seed that was foreknown by god whose name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world if you want to if you don't like the reflection check at what you're pointing to this message will reflect the life of jesus christ this message we saw it in the prophet he reflected the life of jesus christ in his day but there's got to be a reflection in this day and this reflection is in the formation of the bride the many member bride reflecting the life of jesus christ how can she do it only when she's pointed at the right thing we've got to take the scare away of will i make it well i mean you've already made it you've already made it if you've heard from your theophany then you have a theophany you know what that means if you heard from your theophany then you have a theophany if you have a theophany you don't have anything else to worry about do you believe you've heard from your theophany then take the scare away there is no scare of not making it there is no scare of not being with god of not being raptured of not being redeemed that scare is now gone now that we take that pressure off it's not that i'm going to fail and god will never have me back and he's not going to rapture me because i messed up the other day listen i already heard from my theophany meaning i have a theophany he's not going to look at my theophany because i messed up and say you get out of here you say funny it's a joke we laugh but listen that the reality of it god already has this secure he already understands he's not going to lose himself so all this fear of i'll make a mistake or i'll believe something wrong or i'll go the wrong direction listen those are all legitimate fears and if that happens you will suffer for it but theophany's going nowhere it's not getting kicked out of heaven you're not losing your predestinated position you have a connection with god take our eyes off of the scary talk amen and now it's not up to us to protect ourselves in this dark age it's going to get darker friends it's not up to us to prepare it's not up to us to make our own way but we're to be like the sparrows we're to be like the lily and say i have a father and it doesn't matter how bad it gets and how rotten the government becomes and how much pressure comes i have a father and what you do can you can never do anything to me unless it's given to you from above jesus could walk wherever god led him to walk because he had a father he didn't have to worry about his provisions he didn't have to worry about to do what to do once he got there he didn't have to have an escape plan or plan b he just went as he was led because he had a father who would do the rest amen and we have a father in this day and we don't have to worry about preparing for ourselves or protecting ourselves or having a safe haven you don't need a bunker house in new zealand amen you need to be in the tower of the word of god and jesus christ that's the tower that the righteous run into in our save we need to make sure our bunker's secure what is our function it's the word it's the word that's been given to us in this hour amen it's our it's our bomb shelter friends and then we need to drink in the word and grow and grow take away all the fear and all the worry all the strain to be something i'm not to have to measure to this measuring stick throw it all away how can you measure higher than a theophany in the presence of god throw it away all the need to be something make yourself suddenly prepare for something protect yourself throw it away and then let the peace of god that passes all understanding in your heart and with love in your heart feed on this word with everything you've got and this word will produce exactly what's already in the word to produce what's in you and the message has been given to this hour are going to interlock there are two pieces of the chinese laundry ticket and when they come together it'll produce the life of jesus christ for this hour we need to forget about all the noise forget about all the churchianity and all the religion and get down to just loving our husband the revealed word of the eye and let that change us mold us make us what we need to be let's all stand musicians if you'll come brother ben if you'll come see there was a woman at the well one time she didn't have any answers the samaritan woman her life was a wreck she didn't have a lot of answers she didn't have a good reputation she really didn't have anything going for her that would make her a child of god and a representative of god on the earth but what she did have was representation in heaven she didn't even have a husband that was her own she was on her six and it wasn't her own she didn't have a good reputation a good life she didn't have theology she may not have been able to read or write we don't know she could even go to the well at the time of the day when the respectable women go she had to go at a different time of day she as far as earthly things go she had nothing but the one thing she had was something that no pharisee could make himself have she had representation in heaven and that representation in heaven knew how to trigger a revelation in her heart and you know what that little eagle was trying to live in a chicken yard trying to you know she didn't know if the samaritans had the right religion or the jews had the right religion but when she saw a prophetic gift come on the scene all of a sudden you you realize by reading the story that that little seed was thirsty as soon as he says uh uh you know you've had five and the one you're living with is not your own she says i perceive you to be a prophet she says in this mountain is where our fathers say we should worship she didn't say do you think i could ever be saved do you think god would accept me because i've had so many husbands there was something deeper than that there was something down on the inside that wanted god amen and wanted to worship god and wanted to know how to get to god they said our father is saying this mountain you say in jerusalem and he says woman the time cometh and now is for the father is seeking such that will worship him in spirit and in truth amen and all of a sudden all she wants is this water she wants this life she wants what this man is talking about she could never have produced a pharisee life but a pharisee life could have never got her revelation you may not in your own self have been able to produce the perfect life and the perfect upbringing the perfect situation amen but those who've had a perfect life and a perfect religion and god all the t's crossed and the eyes dotted they may not be able to get the revelation you can get amen it's not you press your way into it it just comes you just say that's the truth you've heard from your theophany amen amen i saw all of you over there amen you know what let that revelation change your life let that seed on the inside grow and take over and let that seed bear fruit feed it point to christ stay in the word and let the word produce the life let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you god for your word and the confidence you give us this day lord i know there's a lot of voices out there lord we hear all kinds of things but lord none of it matters for lord we know that we have representation in heaven because you've dropped a revelation in our hearts of who we are god may we live that life that you've called for us in this day lord the words that we speak that doesn't scare the devil too much but it's the life that's what he's afraid of lord i pray god that you would take so control of us let us surrender so to you quit worrying about one thing and quit worrying about the other or trying to prove something to one group and something to another but let us just dive into your word and surrender to you and let you have your own way in us and by preeminence lord may you live your own life through us and manifest to the world who you really are let us walk in humility lord and in reverence let us walk in obedience and subjection lord serving your word let us live the kind of life you live lord and may it take effect on the people around us but i thank you that you put us in a day where under the fifth seal there was going to come a revelation that would show us how to be better christians and how to overcome in the day that we now live the things that we're facing and that revelation was we were secure before we ever arrived that we come from god and we go to god and that you've made us joint heirs of all things oh god what a revelation what a security we have oh god what a foundation you have put us on in this hour an unshakeable unmovable foundation though the storm winds blow and and the waves beat vehemently against the house lord this house that is based on the rock of revelation of where we come from and who we are this house will not fall you made sure we had the foundation stone that would keep this bride afloat when all the storm comes crashing down we know who we are we know who we come from we know that we're joint heirs god now let us let us walk in humility as you did and in service to our brethren until we all come into the unity of the faith god we love you we surrender our lives afresh to you lord we like to repent lord and say we're sorry for being anxious about things we shouldn't have been anxious about we're sorry for focusing on things that were a waste of time god give us that that burning desire to feed only on your word to stay united only with you lord to stay focused only on our husband the revealed word of the hour go on may we reflect back what we're pointing to lord made me as a minister and all the other ministers in the church may we be pointing to the right thing so that the people can reflect the right image god help us lord to stay true to you because you promised to stay true to us may we reflect lord in this life and we reflect lord you to this dying world we love you lord keep us i pray that you pull all anxiety out of the hearts of your children all fear of failure all fear lord remove it by a revelation plant deep within the hearts of your believing children who they are who you are in this hour may it dispel every fear and anxiety every fiery dart of the devil and may there be a joy raised up within us in the midst of blackness and chaos may there be a joy that resonates in our heart a song that's on our lips because all is well with my soul we love you god we ask that you would keep us in this hour that you would use us for your glory that you would have preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen
