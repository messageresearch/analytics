TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice &gt;&gt; in the evening time. &gt;&gt; In the evening time after he repaired the altar of the Lord when the fire revival fires died down there was a drought and when God had sent him back because there was going to be rain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see why, brother? Do you see why the Holy Spirit pointed him to this? &gt;&gt; In the e time of the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the ministry of Elijah at the end times? To turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 38. Then the fire of God fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and they said, "The Lord, he is God. The Lord, he is God." &gt;&gt; God showed himself. Amen. Let's go to verse 41 now. And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up, eat, and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain." &gt;&gt; Amen. When it were when the word was restored, when Elijah came out of hiding, when he come to Mount Carmel showdown, when he brought him back to the original faith, when he brought him back from mixed religion to pure religion, Amen. And he did it all at God's word and the impossible was done. Then he says, "Now the rain's going to fall." So Ahab went up to to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to top of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees. And he said to his servant, "Go up now. Look toward the sea." And he went up and he looked and he said, "There's nothing." He said, "Go again seven times." &gt;&gt; And it came to pass at the seventh time in the seventh church age. This &gt;&gt; has to do with the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; The seventh time that he said, "Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea like a man's hand." And he said, "Go up, say unto him, prepare thy chariot and get thee down, that the rain stopped thee not." Amen. What was the sign that the rain was coming? There was a cloud. Amen. There was a cloud. Amen. When And the seventh time, the seventh time he looked and the seventh under the seventh seal in the seventh church, there was a cloud that announced that rain was coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Amen. God mean by the Holy Spirit. Brother Brandham is sitting in this spot where he doesn't know what the next step is. He doesn't know how to get there. He doesn't know what's going. So the Holy Spirit says, "Listen, you're just in a place like Moses was." Amen. Waiting for something. You're in a place like John the Baptist was waiting to come out and announce the Messiah. You're where Paul was waiting to come out with the true word. Amen. You're where Elijah was waiting to come and bring the Mount Carmel showdown so that the rain can fall again because it's time for the latter rain revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, the spirit knew what he was saying when he told brother man. And brother Ben picked it up and said, "That's exactly what I was looking for. That's just it. That's the answer to my question.
