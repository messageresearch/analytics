[9:51] the bride just keeps moving on
[9:54] we're happy and we're a free people you
[9:56] know we're not going to come under the
[9:57] same
[9:58] anxiety and the same fears the rest of
[10:00] the world
[10:01] why because we have a heavenly father
[10:04] who watches over us
[10:06] you know that that brother branham
[10:08] quoted that
[10:10] uh a couple of times in the message
[10:12] where the
[10:13] one robin and the or one bird in the
[10:16] garden said to another bird why do these
[10:18] people
[10:19] run about and are so anxious and the one
[10:22] bird looks to the other and says
[10:23] it must be that they have no heavenly
[10:25] father that watches over them like you
[10:27] and i
[10:29] you know when when everything's falling
[10:32] apart and news is coming out fast and
[10:34] i opened the the curtains on the patio
[10:38] door and i looked out
[10:39] and there's two little squirrels eating
[10:41] out of the bird feeder
[10:43] and uh you can't convince them the
[10:44] world's falling apart
[10:47] they're happy why because they have a
[10:50] god who takes care of them
[10:53] amen let's all stand and we'll read a
[10:55] scripture together
[10:57] at a second timothy so yeah i never
[11:00] thought i'd see the day my son is
[11:02] engaged
[11:04] i was hoping that we'd all be in new
[11:06] bodies in a new place
[11:07] by now he may have had other wishes but
[11:10] this
[11:11] my wishes we'd all go up in a bunch
[11:13] together but
[11:14] god has a plan and we're excited for
[11:16] them proud of them
[11:18] and man it's good to see our young
[11:20] people growing up i remember josiah
[11:22] when we first moved up here he was the
[11:24] little guy eight nine years old helping
[11:26] us mow grass and help me work on a fence
[11:28] and
[11:29] now he's getting married he's got his
[11:30] own house and
[11:32] my own son time moves fast
[11:35] i remember old people talking like this
[11:42] so and i was like that's old people talk
[11:47] and now i'm starting to use old people
[11:48] talk i don't like it
[11:52] amen praise the lord also kyle mentioned
[11:56] it but remember this wednesday he and
[11:58] his family and the
[11:59] seven of our young people will be
[12:00] traveling up and then
[12:02] talk to a couple of the parents and kyle
[12:04] and everybody feels free in their heart
[12:06] to continue on
[12:08] and i said well just keep moving forward
[12:09] and if god closes the door god closes
[12:11] the door but if not he's got a purpose
[12:13] there's no reason for us to figure
[12:15] things out we need to be led by the
[12:17] spirit of god
[12:19] also thursday on the 19th myself my wife
[12:22] and myself and the young adults
[12:24] will be going to the young adults
[12:25] retreat over in indiana so remember that
[12:27] in prayer
[12:28] we'll be back saturday evening but
[12:30] brother john kadeem is going to be
[12:31] preaching for us this sunday so
[12:33] i'm sure he would covet your prayers and
[12:35] appreciate you remembering him as well
[12:38] man let's look at second timothy
[12:43] chapter one and let's look at verse
[12:46] seven
[12:50] second timothy 1 7 for god has not given
[12:53] us the spirit of fear
[12:55] but of power and love and of a sound
[12:58] mind
[13:00] let's bow our heads and pray dear
[13:01] heavenly father we thank you lord jesus
[13:04] for all that you have given to us and we
[13:06] thank you for your provision for us lord
[13:09] we just ask now that you would begin to
[13:11] speak to us lord by your provided way
[13:14] we've come in obedience to your word and
[13:15] we've come expecting to hear from you
[13:18] and i pray god that you would take these
[13:19] lips of clay that you would take control
[13:22] and you would speak your eternal words
[13:24] give us all ears to hear and a heart to
[13:26] perceive all you have for us in this day
[13:28] we give ourselves to you and ask you
[13:30] take preeminence among us
[13:32] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[13:35] you all can be seated
[13:40] amen i took for a subject today the
[13:42] pandemic of fear
[13:46] for obvious reasons we just want to talk
[13:50] about
[13:51] the pandemic of fear because this is
[13:54] we're coming to showdown time we're
[13:57] moving into proving time
[14:00] and the cycles brother benham taught us
[14:02] in birth pains that
[14:04] that when he preached birth pains he
[14:05] preached birth pains after he declared
[14:07] judgment striking beginning at the west
[14:10] coast and
[14:11] and you know he was the one who
[14:12] initiated that cycle
[14:14] and after he initiated that cycle there
[14:17] was an earthquake in uh
[14:18] in alaska in the following year there's
[14:20] one in seattle and brother bam started
[14:22] showing us it was the beginning
[14:23] of the cycle of the end of the
[14:25] destruction of the earth preparing it
[14:27] for a millennium
[14:28] but when he preached birth pains he
[14:30] shows that all these contractions
[14:32] they they get closer together and more
[14:34] intense that's it's time for the baby to
[14:36] be
[14:36] born and he begins to speak that way
[14:39] about
[14:40] this this earth this earth is groaning
[14:42] in travail
[14:44] because it's going to bring forth a
[14:45] bright new world for a millennium
[14:48] and the earth now you know you see the
[14:50] timing
[14:51] uh the birth pains increasing in
[14:54] intensity
[14:55] and the contractions getting closer
[14:56] together it tells you that the baby's
[14:59] coming the baby's coming the baby's
[15:00] coming
[15:01] amen and before the baby can come the
[15:04] bride has to
[15:05] get a translation and go to a wedding
[15:07] supper so
[15:08] actually the severity of the
[15:10] contractions the intensity and the
[15:12] frequency
[15:12] is an indication of the ripeness of the
[15:15] seed
[15:17] when we see these things happening amen
[15:19] it says look up for thy redemption draw
[15:21] us nigh
[15:22] it is it is it is showing it's not that
[15:25] the bride is catching up with the earth
[15:27] the earth is catching up with the bride
[15:29] amen it's god's work in his people
[15:32] that's moving
[15:32] everything so it's exciting
[15:36] this is an exciting time to be alive
[15:40] let's turn to second peter i want to
[15:41] read quite a few scriptures here
[15:43] so keep your bibles handy let's go to
[15:45] second peter
[15:48] ii peter chapter 3
[15:52] verse 1.
[15:57] ii peter 3 and 1
[16:02] the second epistle beloved i i now write
[16:05] unto you
[16:05] in both which i stir up your pure minds
[16:07] by way of remembrance
[16:09] that you may be mindful of the words
[16:11] which are spoken before
[16:13] by the holy prophets and of the
[16:15] commandment of us the apostles
[16:17] of the lord and savior knowing this
[16:19] first that there shall come in the last
[16:21] days scoffers
[16:22] walking after their own lust so i read
[16:24] this to show you
[16:25] he he's he's stirring up
[16:28] in your pure minds by way of remembrance
[16:31] all that was written
[16:32] the things i'm going to talk about today
[16:34] are nothing new we know these scriptures
[16:36] we know these quotes we know this but i
[16:38] want to take the opportunity to stir up
[16:39] your pure minds by remembrance
[16:42] because we're human beings and human
[16:44] beings you know and the greatest battle
[16:45] ever fought is fought between our ears
[16:48] all of our battles are mind battles and
[16:50] we've got to keep the word
[16:51] forefront in our minds all the time
[16:53] because there's always
[16:54] other messages trying to get their way
[16:57] into our mind
[16:58] amen and and if you're like me the
[17:01] messages have been coming hard and fast
[17:03] in the last few days
[17:04] through the news and we need to hear the
[17:06] true report
[17:08] because what you're hearing on the news
[17:10] is not the true report
[17:13] but this word is the true report and we
[17:15] need to pay attention amen and make
[17:18] sure that we're feeding on the word that
[17:20] we're listening to the message
[17:21] that we're hearing the true report those
[17:23] things that will build faith in time of
[17:25] trouble
[17:26] amen and so we stir up in your minds by
[17:28] way of your pure minds by way of
[17:30] remembrance what has been written
[17:33] brother menom said in the message be not
[17:34] afraid it says
[17:36] now i want to take a subject to take a
[17:39] subject for this testimony meaning of
[17:41] be not afraid there's two elements that
[17:44] control the entire human race in the
[17:46] world
[17:47] one of them is fear the other is faith
[17:50] now it's either faith fear or faith
[17:52] controls every nation
[17:53] every denomination every individual
[17:56] you're either fear or faith
[17:57] that controls you and my question is
[18:00] this morning
[18:01] what controls you fear of faith
[18:05] amen because you know we we live we
[18:08] live on this earth and we live in bodies
[18:11] amen
[18:12] that are susceptible that are fallen a
[18:14] mind that is corrupt
[18:16] amen but there's something on the inside
[18:18] amen there's faith that comes from god
[18:20] himself
[18:21] god's own faith is laying there ready to
[18:24] be released in the time of need
[18:26] amen and it takes the word of god it
[18:28] takes the light of the hour
[18:29] amen to shine on that and encourage you
[18:31] it takes the holy ghost to keep bringing
[18:33] those things
[18:34] out but it's there amen and what is
[18:37] going to control us is it going to be
[18:39] the outer man or the inner man
[18:40] what are we going to be controlled by
[18:42] because the outer man can be swayed
[18:44] amen by my winds of of
[18:47] news and troubles and all kinds of
[18:49] things can sway the outer man
[18:50] but the inner man has an anchor that's
[18:53] tied to a rock
[18:54] and that's a revelation in the word and
[18:56] it's not going to move
[18:59] amen oh
[19:02] i get excited in one week
[19:06] the world has changed for us
[19:11] all my life and it's not been that long
[19:19] i have never seen what i've seen in one
[19:21] week
[19:23] in this country i remember
[19:27] having a conversation with brother frank
[19:29] i'm going to throw him under the bus
[19:33] but we would have conversations over the
[19:35] last couple years and i said
[19:36] you know brother franco things are going
[19:38] to change they're not going to stay this
[19:39] way there's going to be a persecution
[19:41] the things brother ben said is going to
[19:42] happen
[19:43] things are not going to stay the way
[19:44] they are and brother franco says i know
[19:46] you say that brother chad but how i
[19:48] don't see it
[19:49] how can things change that fast and i
[19:51] kept saying things can fall like
[19:53] dominoes they can change
[19:54] fast and he said how so i think it was
[19:57] friday thursday or friday he comes in my
[19:59] office he goes brother chad
[20:03] he was ready to repent
[20:07] because now you see things can change
[20:10] faster than we ever imagined
[20:12] what the world is realizing is the whole
[20:15] system is fragile
[20:16] [Applause]
[20:17] it's not solid it's not stable
[20:20] everything that we
[20:21] thought was tangible and solid and
[20:23] unmovable with things that we begin to
[20:25] rely on
[20:27] like paychecks and account balances and
[20:31] government help and we're beginning to
[20:34] realize that these things were fragile
[20:37] but we knew they were fragile we knew
[20:39] they were temporal we knew the word of
[20:40] god tells us
[20:41] not to put our confidence in the things
[20:43] of man not to lean to the arm of flesh
[20:45] god has already told us this these
[20:47] things but now he's allowing us to see
[20:49] just how fragile this whole system is
[20:53] the whole thing is propped up by
[20:55] popsicle sticks
[20:59] and we feel so safe and so secure
[21:03] because the traffic lights work and the
[21:05] streets are paved and
[21:09] but just in a moment's time
[21:12] a matter of a few weeks you knock out a
[21:14] couple popsicle sticks
[21:17] and you realize the whole thing can
[21:19] collapse
[21:24] and the world is gripped in fear
[21:29] brother of them told us years ago
[21:30] america is whistling in the graveyard
[21:34] trying to convince themselves that
[21:35] they're not scared and everything's fine
[21:38] well nobody's whistling in the graveyard
[21:40] now
[21:42] and it's just the tip of the iceberg
[21:44] this is just the beginning
[21:46] there's more to come so
[21:50] so for me all my life
[21:53] there's been a certain steadiness a
[21:56] certain stability
[21:57] i mean as much as my life went up and
[22:00] down there were certain things that
[22:01] stayed fast
[22:03] stayed concrete stayed steady around but
[22:05] now we're reeling
[22:06] you can't put confidence in any of those
[22:08] things there's only one thing that we
[22:10] can have confidence in and that's
[22:12] god himself everything else will be
[22:15] shaken
[22:16] everything else will be shaken down amen
[22:18] but god and god is his word
[22:20] is going to be unmovable unshaking and
[22:23] it's the
[22:23] rock that we can run to it's the it's
[22:26] the it's the place it's the strong tower
[22:28] that we can run to
[22:29] and the time of trouble and we will be
[22:31] perfectly completely
[22:33] safe amen
[22:36] we will not be motivated by fear we will
[22:39] not
[22:39] you know we will not uh we will not
[22:42] follow the pattern of the world in the
[22:44] time of calamity because we don't need
[22:46] to
[22:49] amen we've got a god who's promised and
[22:52] made precious promises that
[22:54] belong to us and we're not going to
[22:56] forfeit those promises to take care of
[22:58] ourselves
[22:58] amen we're going to let him take care of
[23:00] us because he said he would
[23:05] let's look at when we looked here at
[23:08] second timothy 1
[23:09] 7 we don't have to turn back we're going
[23:10] to go to romans next but it says
[23:13] he has not given us the spirit of fear
[23:16] so you realize fear is a spirit
[23:20] and because it's a spirit it can be
[23:22] resisted like any other spirit can be
[23:24] resisted
[23:25] like the spirit of lust or the spirit of
[23:28] greed or the spirit of anger
[23:30] or all these other spirits that try to
[23:32] cause us to fall
[23:34] cause us to go to error speak things
[23:36] that are wrong and do things that are
[23:37] wrong
[23:38] those are all spirits that are trying to
[23:40] motivate us but fear
[23:41] is a spirit amen if we've watched the
[23:44] news we've watched the world
[23:45] amen come under the grip of the spirit
[23:48] of fear
[23:49] there's a spirit of fear on the world
[23:51] amen but there should be no spirit of
[23:53] fear
[23:54] in the bride and when you feel that
[23:57] thing coming in like a wave
[23:59] we need to be able to say satan i resist
[24:03] you
[24:03] in the name of jesus christ because it's
[24:06] a spirit
[24:08] we can cast off spirits we can resist
[24:10] spirits we can bind spirits
[24:12] we don't have to give in to spirits and
[24:15] if we give
[24:15] in to spirits amen will be overcome by
[24:18] the spirit
[24:20] so we we have to give the spirit a
[24:22] position amen and we choose not to give
[24:24] it a position
[24:26] we actively choose not to allow the
[24:29] spirit of fear to influence our mind
[24:30] amen we bring every thought captive to
[24:34] the obedience of christ
[24:36] every thought every thought that comes
[24:38] through our mind we have to be judges of
[24:40] these thoughts
[24:41] because there's a spirit of fear running
[24:43] rampant out there that will try to bring
[24:45] thoughts into our mind and brother bam
[24:46] said you can't
[24:47] stop him from putting thoughts in your
[24:49] mind but you don't let the birds build a
[24:51] nest in your hair
[24:53] and when the thought comes you say that
[24:55] thought is contrary to the scriptures
[24:58] that is contrary to what my lord has
[25:00] told me amen i don't have to fear this i
[25:03] don't have to fear
[25:04] that and i don't have to worry about
[25:05] this everything's going to be okay
[25:08] why because he told me everything's
[25:10] going to be okay
[25:11] in fact he told me all these things are
[25:13] coming already
[25:14] he told me in the scriptures and he told
[25:16] me in the message and he's already told
[25:18] me
[25:18] so this is what we've been expecting
[25:22] we've been expecting this and more
[25:25] [Applause]
[25:26] so when it comes there's all of a sudden
[25:29] from fear faith has this little tremor
[25:32] on the inside
[25:33] there's an expectation there's an
[25:35] excitement on the inside and the bride
[25:38] amen that excitement is why because the
[25:41] word's coming to pass
[25:42] any time the words coming to pass it's
[25:44] an enthusiastic thing for the bride
[25:47] she's excited we're not excited because
[25:49] people are suffering we're not excited
[25:51] because of difficult circumstances
[25:53] we're excited because he told us this
[25:55] would be here and he told us these would
[25:57] be the conditions like this
[25:59] and more amen as we get closer and
[26:01] closer
[26:02] to our to our rescue
[26:06] and when you see the word of god
[26:07] advancing something inside says
[26:10] praise god i'm excited
[26:14] let's go to romans chapter 8.
[26:24] romans chapter 8 and verse 14.
[26:38] for as many as they're led by the spirit
[26:40] of god they are the sons of god
[26:42] if you have not received the spirit of
[26:44] bondage again to fear
[26:47] because that a spirit of bondage was to
[26:50] fear
[26:52] but we've been released from that that
[26:54] fear brings a bondage
[26:57] you have not received the spirit of
[26:58] bondage again to fear but you have
[27:00] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[27:02] we cry abba father
[27:04] the spirit of self-bearing witness with
[27:06] our spirit that we are the children of
[27:07] god
[27:08] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[27:10] and joint heirs with christ
[27:11] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[27:13] may be also glorified together
[27:16] so this spirit that comes to witness in
[27:18] us that we are the children of god
[27:20] is we've got a different spirit not one
[27:22] to bring us back to bondage again of
[27:24] fear
[27:25] but one that liberates us to the
[27:26] realization we're sons of god and joint
[27:28] heirs with christ
[27:29] and if i be a son of god and a joint
[27:31] heir of christ what do i have to fear
[27:34] what do i have to worry about because if
[27:36] i'm a joint heir of christ
[27:38] everything that belongs to christ also
[27:39] belongs to me
[27:41] and every privilege that's extended to
[27:42] christ is also extended to me
[27:44] all protection and all provision in all
[27:47] things amen that has been delivered to
[27:49] him i'm also a joint heir
[27:50] and i'm also a son of god amen how many
[27:53] sons of god does god lose
[27:56] how many sons of god does he not provide
[27:58] for how many sons of god
[28:00] amen does he lose in the shuffle losing
[28:02] the mix and lose track of
[28:04] see this spirit is what brings peace to
[28:06] us to realize
[28:07] that there's nothing to be afraid of i
[28:10] have a heavenly father
[28:12] who watches over me amen and he's made
[28:16] promises in his word
[28:18] i don't have to worry about it all i
[28:20] have to do is believe
[28:22] let's go to hebrews chapter 2.
[28:32] hebrews chapter 2
[28:39] verse 14
[28:42] for as much then as the children are
[28:43] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[28:45] himself likewise took part of the same
[28:47] that through death he might destroy him
[28:49] that had the power of death
[28:51] that is the devil and deliver them who
[28:53] through fear of death were all their
[28:55] lifetimes subject to bondage
[28:57] this was the bondage that was talking
[28:58] about in romans because of fear of death
[29:01] amen there is subject to bondage but
[29:03] there is now
[29:04] no fear and death in fact
[29:08] if you would die right now it would be
[29:10] the greatest thing that ever
[29:12] happened to you because you would
[29:14] instantly go to the sixth dimension and
[29:16] be rejoicing in the place that brother
[29:17] branham said
[29:18] so instantly now there's no more fear
[29:20] and death
[29:21] and brother branham said in the message
[29:23] it is the rising of the sun
[29:25] but when the abstract has come it struck
[29:27] off omitted everything
[29:29] i'm an abstract holder then amen and as
[29:32] sure as the spirit that raised christ
[29:34] from the dead i have an abstract deed
[29:36] that i'm part of
[29:37] that body with the abstract of the holy
[29:39] ghost making that body
[29:41] of word live out just exactly like it
[29:43] did in him
[29:45] he as he promised in the last days the
[29:47] abstract
[29:48] all my sins are struck out all your sins
[29:51] are struck out by the blood of jesus
[29:53] christ and the holy ghost has come as an
[29:55] abstract to the title deed
[29:57] that god given me by grace by foreign
[29:59] knowledge oh my
[30:00] what are you scared about no wonder he
[30:03] said fear not
[30:04] i am he that was dead and alive again
[30:06] and i'm alive forevermore and have the
[30:08] keys of death and hell
[30:10] don't worry about nothing even death
[30:12] ain't going to hurt you
[30:14] what are you scared about he he he
[30:17] purchased
[30:17] back through shedding of his own blood
[30:20] redemption all that adam lost amen
[30:22] all that mankind lost in the fall has
[30:25] been purchased back
[30:26] and now he's laid claim of the title
[30:28] deed book and he's done more than that
[30:31] through his seventh church age messenger
[30:32] he sent it down to his bride remember
[30:36] where the title deed book
[30:38] went yes it went down amen to the hands
[30:42] of a seventh church age messenger
[30:43] who gave it out to the bride amen and
[30:46] when john
[30:46] went and took that book he ate the book
[30:50] that means the title deed book is in the
[30:53] bride
[30:56] all the inheritance lost is restored
[30:58] everything that was given up is come
[31:01] back
[31:01] every provision amen the blood that
[31:03] purchased us back and paid the price of
[31:05] redemption and erased our sins
[31:07] is the same one that takes care of the
[31:09] effect of sin
[31:10] and sickness is the effect of sin
[31:13] everything that's in a fallen condition
[31:15] is an effect of sin and when he paid the
[31:17] price for sin
[31:18] he paid the price for all the effects of
[31:20] sin and now we have a way
[31:22] where we can overcome all the effects of
[31:25] sin
[31:27] even death
[31:30] so what are you scared about
[31:34] let's go to first john
[31:40] first john chapter four
[31:50] first john chapter 4 and verse 17.
[31:59] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[32:02] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[32:05] this is a judgment day we're in a season
[32:09] of judgment
[32:10] here is our love made perfect that we
[32:11] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[32:13] because as he is so are we in this world
[32:18] what are you scared about as he is
[32:21] so are we in this world
[32:25] there is no fear in love but perfect
[32:28] love casts
[32:29] out fear because fear hath torment
[32:33] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[32:35] love
[32:36] we love him because he first loved us
[32:40] it's a revelation of predestination
[32:43] it's an understanding of we were part of
[32:46] him we were in him we were with him in
[32:48] the beginning
[32:48] we belong to him we've come out from him
[32:51] we love him because he first loved us
[32:53] it's the revelation of predestination
[32:55] that settles our heart
[32:56] if he predestinated us and he placed us
[32:58] here all
[32:59] things are in his control
[33:03] furthermore brother branham says i'm
[33:05] going to find this quote
[33:08] i've got to skip ahead of ways
[33:12] in the super sign 1963 he says god
[33:15] knowed the end from the beginning
[33:17] therefore he could plan everything that
[33:19] it would work out just to his glory
[33:21] and that gives us courage to know that
[33:22] no matter what comes or goes god is
[33:24] making everything
[33:25] the clock is ticking just exactly on
[33:27] time
[33:30] is it yes and when you see the clock
[33:33] tick a stroke and you say i've never
[33:35] seen this before
[33:36] it's right on time it's right perfect
[33:40] sometimes we get weary upset we get
[33:42] hasty we think
[33:43] oh we must do this or do that but
[33:45] remember god's clock will be just
[33:47] exactly on time all these things has to
[33:50] be this way
[33:51] it has to all be done according to his
[33:53] great knowledge
[33:54] his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge
[33:56] he could predestinate
[33:57] not by his desire but by his knowledge
[34:00] god doesn't predestinate by his desire
[34:02] he's not willing that any should perish
[34:04] but by his foreknowledge he knew who
[34:06] would accept it and who would not
[34:08] therefore he can make everything work
[34:10] according to his big time clock
[34:12] that's ticking away for he could
[34:14] foretell the end from the beginning and
[34:15] therefore
[34:16] he knew that we would live in this day
[34:19] bring this home
[34:21] right now today to this sunday morning
[34:24] amen in 2020 he knew that we would live
[34:27] in this day
[34:28] he knew this would be our day he had
[34:31] plans for this day
[34:33] he has had plans for every day and never
[34:36] has one of his plans
[34:37] ever failed he is always on time
[34:41] hey who put you here did
[34:44] who put you here amen you come
[34:47] amen in spiritual amnesia with no with
[34:50] no no choice in this life that
[34:52] i would be placed here in this time he
[34:54] placed you here by his predestination
[34:56] you're here in this time and it's not
[34:59] that god didn't know the challenges that
[35:01] we would be facing in this time
[35:03] we didn't quite understand the
[35:05] challenges we'd even be facing this last
[35:07] week
[35:10] just because it escaped our
[35:12] understanding and foresight
[35:13] didn't mean it ever escaped his and he
[35:16] chose
[35:16] you to be here now
[35:20] and if he chose you to be here now then
[35:23] he's put inside of you
[35:25] exactly what you need amen to overcome
[35:28] in this place
[35:29] now today under the current conditions
[35:32] or all conditions in worse conditions
[35:35] the most horrible of conditions
[35:37] he placed you here now and if he placed
[35:41] you here now
[35:42] he's got confidence in that attribute
[35:44] that he's placed inside of you
[35:46] and he knows that it'll overcome
[35:49] he knows it so there's no fear in those
[35:52] things
[35:54] see whatever i face he foresaw
[35:58] whatever i have to walk through he
[36:01] foresaw
[36:01] any and within me he placed within me
[36:06] all that i need and he sent his word in
[36:09] due season to quicken it out of me
[36:13] praise be to god i'm so glad
[36:17] amen when god was making the earth
[36:20] when he was first forming the earth he
[36:22] was laying out the ingredients for your
[36:24] body
[36:26] so his foresight is unmeasurable
[36:31] he says brother brother man said god
[36:33] doesn't run his business like you and i
[36:35] or some others would run it just
[36:36] haphazardly amen but
[36:38] like a contractor he would lay out so
[36:40] many two by fours and so many of this
[36:42] and so much of that
[36:43] because he knew what material would take
[36:44] to build the house and he laid it all
[36:46] out ahead of time
[36:47] and god did that when he created this
[36:49] world to take your body out of
[36:50] he already foresaw you standing here now
[36:53] and put the ingredients in the earth
[36:55] whenever the earth was formed
[36:57] however many billions and millions or
[36:59] whatever years ago
[37:00] your body was laying here then
[37:03] and he ordained it to come to
[37:05] manifestation in this
[37:06] hour to meet the need of the hour
[37:12] that's why he said a super race because
[37:15] it's going to be
[37:16] super bad super trouble
[37:19] super bugs super disturbances super bad
[37:22] news
[37:23] just so there'd be a super race here to
[37:25] meet it
[37:28] predestinated for this hour remember
[37:30] friend we've been
[37:31] no matter what the news report says
[37:33] you've been predestinated for this hour
[37:36] and if you weren't you would have
[37:37] manifested in another hour but you're
[37:39] the seed of god the children of god the
[37:41] part of god
[37:42] amen remember it's not just you this
[37:44] flesh that we're talking about
[37:46] this flesh can get troubled this flesh
[37:48] can get nervous amen but it's the peace
[37:50] of god on the inside
[37:51] and when god parted himself out he
[37:54] placed so many of himself
[37:55] with certain characteristics to meet the
[37:57] need of each day
[37:58] but there was a portion he had to hold
[38:01] back for the last day
[38:02] because it's a part of his nature it's a
[38:04] part of his makeup
[38:06] it's a part of himself that he wants to
[38:08] be displayed in a certain way
[38:10] at a certain time and that's the part
[38:12] that's in you and i
[38:14] and god will not be defeated by anything
[38:17] that's coming
[38:18] nothing will defeat god
[38:23] hallelujah friends
[38:26] with that being said the news gets
[38:27] exciting
[38:30] it's not fearful it's exciting
[38:33] because the news is only responding to
[38:35] the life on the inside
[38:38] god god desires
[38:42] to prove himself it's his desire
[38:46] to prove himself he's been building and
[38:49] maturing
[38:50] and building and maturing amen this seed
[38:53] because he wants to prove it god's not
[38:57] afraid of the test
[39:02] are you god's not afraid of the test
[39:07] don't let anybody make you afraid of the
[39:09] test
[39:10] because god's not afraid he wasn't
[39:12] afraid to send the three hebrew children
[39:14] to the fiery furnace he wasn't afraid of
[39:17] the test
[39:19] and they finally got to the point amen
[39:21] they said god our god is more than able
[39:24] they didn't know what was going to
[39:26] happen they couldn't predict what was
[39:28] going to happen
[39:29] they couldn't presume it was going to
[39:30] happen but they knew one thing
[39:32] our god is more than able to deliver us
[39:34] from this but if he doesn't i'll still
[39:37] die standing on his word i'll believe
[39:39] him to the bitter end
[39:41] and if i die i die a believer
[39:44] i'm not going to die fearful a coward
[39:46] bowing down trying to make
[39:48] some sort of appeasement to the politics
[39:50] amen so that i can spare my natural life
[39:52] a little longer
[39:53] no they were willing to they were
[39:55] willing to give it all for the word of
[39:57] god
[39:57] and if they die they die
[40:02] it's always a word test friends
[40:05] it wasn't they god wasn't afraid to put
[40:08] them to that test because he knew what
[40:09] was in him he wasn't afraid to put job
[40:11] to the test because he knew it was in
[40:12] job
[40:15] god knew the outcome he wasn't going to
[40:19] lose a son
[40:20] but there were some things he wanted to
[40:22] teach job and some things he wanted to
[40:24] prove to satan
[40:26] and he was accomplishing both at the
[40:28] same time and there's some things he
[40:29] wants to teach us
[40:32] and some things he wants to prove to the
[40:33] devil and he's going to do both at the
[40:35] same time
[40:41] let's go to psalms 27. i'm still
[40:45] trying to lay a foundation i like the
[40:48] foundation
[40:50] oh i can't help but be excited
[40:55] i can't help it no matter
[40:59] no matter what i just can't help but be
[41:04] excited
[41:09] psalms 27
[41:12] verse 1
[41:16] the lord is my light and my salvation
[41:18] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[41:20] strength of my life of whom shall i be
[41:22] afraid
[41:23] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[41:25] foes come upon me to eat up my flesh
[41:28] they stumbled and fell though a host
[41:31] should encamp against me my heart shall
[41:33] not fear
[41:34] the war shall arise against me and this
[41:36] will i be confident
[41:37] one thing have i desired of the lord and
[41:39] that will i seek after
[41:41] that i may dwell in the house of the
[41:42] lord all the days of my life
[41:44] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[41:46] inquire in his temple
[41:48] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[41:50] in me in his pavilion
[41:52] and the secret of his tabernacle shall
[41:54] he hide in me
[41:56] this is the inner chamber friends this
[41:58] is back to the bedroom
[42:01] in the inner and the of the inner and
[42:03] the holy of the holies
[42:05] in the pavilion and the seek in the
[42:08] secret of his tabernacle
[42:11] let's keep reading for in the time of
[42:12] trouble he shall hide me in this
[42:14] pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle
[42:17] shall he hide in me
[42:18] he shall set me up upon a rock what's
[42:21] that rock the revelation of god the
[42:23] revelation of the word
[42:26] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[42:28] my enemies around about me
[42:30] why because of revelation set me on a
[42:33] rock and my head's lifted up because of
[42:35] revelation
[42:36] why is it my head's lifted up above all
[42:39] my enemies
[42:39] everybody else is going crazy and losing
[42:42] their minds amen but the bride's not
[42:43] because she's been lifted up in
[42:45] revelation
[42:46] she understands who she is who god is
[42:49] and what the relationship between the
[42:50] two is and what the word says
[42:52] about the hour we live in her head is
[42:54] lifted up
[42:56] above her enemies round about me
[42:59] therefore will i offer in his tabernacle
[43:01] sacrifices of joy i will sing
[43:05] yeah i will sing praises to the lord
[43:08] in the time of trouble the wicked
[43:11] gathered about
[43:12] foes around about desiring to eat up his
[43:14] flesh armies and camped around about him
[43:16] in the time of trouble what's he going
[43:18] to do because he set up on a rock
[43:20] because he's in the inner chamber
[43:22] because he's on a rock of revelation
[43:24] because his head is lifted up by
[43:26] revelation
[43:26] he will sing with joy
[43:30] happiness not not downtrodden not
[43:33] nervous
[43:33] not but happy and joyful
[43:37] because we're tucked away in christ
[43:42] i was when i was thinking on this i was
[43:45] i was reflecting back on the biography i
[43:48] read of john wesley one time
[43:51] and john wesley was an anglican minister
[43:53] and he decided that he was going to
[43:55] evangelize the native american indians
[43:57] so
[43:57] he took a boat ride a ship across the
[44:00] atlantic to come over to georgia
[44:02] to evangelize the indians and on that
[44:05] boat ride a terrible storm came up
[44:08] and he writes about in this diary you
[44:10] can go read it in his diary but
[44:11] a storm comes up and the ship was tossed
[44:14] about and i believe the sail was torn or
[44:16] the mast was broken i saw it was a
[44:18] really
[44:18] terrible storm and he said there was a
[44:21] group of christians on there called the
[44:22] moravians
[44:24] and if you read about moravians they
[44:25] were the real deal
[44:27] they were the real christians of the day
[44:29] amen you can follow their
[44:31] lineage all the way through they're the
[44:33] ones who resisted the catholic church
[44:34] and the waldenses all the way through
[44:36] you can find this true strain of
[44:37] christians
[44:38] and that was the moravians in that day
[44:41] and it says during the storm
[44:43] they began to sing joyfully to the lord
[44:47] they were singing in the midst of the
[44:48] storm they're singing joyfully to the
[44:51] lord
[44:51] well everybody else is terrified and he
[44:53] said a great wave
[44:55] comes over the top of the of the ship
[44:57] and breaks over the ship
[44:59] and starts running down the boards in
[45:00] the deck amen and flooding the bottom
[45:03] and he said oh he called them in his
[45:05] journal he calls them the germans the
[45:06] moravians
[45:08] and he says the english were screaming
[45:10] and the moravians were singing joyfully
[45:13] and they kept
[45:14] when the wave broke over they kept
[45:15] singing praises to the lord
[45:18] and john wesley asked one of the
[45:19] moravian ministers one of the men
[45:21] and he says why aren't you afraid he
[45:23] says
[45:25] he said aren't you afraid he says thank
[45:26] god no
[45:28] he says what about your women and
[45:29] children he said our women and children
[45:31] aren't afraid to die
[45:36] that was the thing that turned john
[45:37] wesley's heart he had never been
[45:39] converted yet
[45:41] anglican minister never been converted
[45:43] and he realized
[45:44] he was terrified and he didn't have what
[45:46] they had
[45:48] they had something in the face of
[45:50] trouble they had something in the face
[45:51] of death that he was lacking
[45:53] amen he went down to georgia and it was
[45:55] a disaster it didn't work out good they
[45:57] practically ran him out
[46:01] comes back and in his journal entry he
[46:03] says i went to save
[46:04] the indians in america but who would
[46:07] save john wesley
[46:10] realize he'd never been converted but
[46:12] what was the thing that turned his heart
[46:13] when he saw in the face of trouble when
[46:16] he saw in the face of
[46:18] a pending doom possible death amen he
[46:21] saw that there was no
[46:22] fear no fear and death but there was a
[46:25] joyful singing to the lord
[46:27] praises and songs of joy and gratitude
[46:29] why
[46:30] because they had something real on the
[46:32] inside that says if this is my last
[46:34] breath let me go
[46:35] singing his praises if this is the last
[46:38] thing i get to do on this planet
[46:39] let me lift a joyful noise into the lord
[46:43] amen i i want so bad for that to be my
[46:46] testimony
[46:47] i went if it's my last breath on earth
[46:49] it's the last action i take
[46:51] please don't let it be curled up in a
[46:53] ball in the corner under the bed but let
[46:55] it be singing praises oh god
[46:57] i thank you and i love you for what
[46:59] you've done and what you're doing
[47:02] why because it's coming to showdown time
[47:04] because everything's moving into
[47:05] extremes
[47:07] i mean there's the middle ground is
[47:09] disappearing all over the place and
[47:11] we're moving into extremes
[47:13] to the place where now amen you you can
[47:16] you can almost slip through society
[47:19] unnoticed in many ways
[47:20] but that day is coming to an end
[47:26] when they see you smiling in the grocery
[47:29] store
[47:31] when everybody else is frantic to get as
[47:34] many things as they can possibly get in
[47:36] their cart
[47:40] and you're going up to the toilet paper
[47:48] and there's one pack left
[47:51] you see the lady she's making a beeline
[47:56] and you back up and say go ahead
[48:02] you realize fear is gripping the people
[48:07] but there's got to be a people who begin
[48:10] to rise and shine
[48:13] for thy light has come
[48:16] not fearful not grabbing not
[48:19] taking not but just trusting
[48:23] my father will take care of me
[48:27] you realize in lima ohio
[48:30] people have emptied the shelves they've
[48:33] gone to walmart
[48:34] gone to meyer gone to aldi and have
[48:37] emptied the shelves
[48:40] and not one of them is sick or know
[48:42] somebody who's sick
[48:45] not one of them but scared
[48:52] terrified completely terrified
[48:57] say god help me never get into that
[49:00] condition
[49:05] you know what i want to do i want to
[49:07] take god at his word
[49:10] i think god's giving us opportunities to
[49:13] take him at his word
[49:14] and i think the opportunities will get
[49:15] better
[49:19] matthew 14 and 22.
[49:26] and straightway jesus constrained his
[49:27] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[49:29] before
[49:30] him unto the other side while he sent
[49:32] the multitudes away
[49:34] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[49:35] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[49:38] when the evening was come he was there
[49:39] alone but the ship was now in the midst
[49:41] of the sea
[49:42] tossed with waves for the wind was
[49:44] contrary and in the fourth watch of the
[49:46] night jesus went unto him walking
[49:48] unto them walking on the sea and when
[49:50] the disciples
[49:52] saw him walking on the sea they were
[49:54] troubled saying it is a spirit
[49:55] and they cried out in fear but
[49:57] straightway jesus spake unto them saying
[49:59] be of good cheer it is i be not afraid
[50:03] so many times we see these circumstances
[50:06] rise up in
[50:07] tumultuous situations and storms and
[50:09] it's just god
[50:10] trying to come to us and it's trying to
[50:13] reveal something to us
[50:16] and he could say the same thing today
[50:18] it's i be not afraid
[50:21] what about this virus in this plague
[50:22] what about this it's i
[50:24] be not afraid can't you see my hand
[50:27] can't you see me working in this
[50:29] can't you see me furthering my kingdom
[50:32] it's i be not afraid
[50:36] be of good cheer
[50:40] go back to psalms 27 i will rejoice with
[50:43] joy
[50:44] and sing praises to the lord win in the
[50:46] midst of trouble
[50:48] and trouble sometimes with foes gathered
[50:51] about
[50:51] i will sing joy amen in the middle of
[50:54] the storm
[50:54] amen they were crying and fearful and
[50:57] thought they would die
[50:58] and he says be of good cheer it is i
[51:02] be not afraid i'd like to say the same
[51:05] thing to you today
[51:06] be of good cheer it's him this is him
[51:09] this is his hand
[51:10] this is his word don't start saying oh
[51:12] the devil this and the devil that
[51:14] god's got his fingerprint all over this
[51:19] what's god doing god is taken a chaos in
[51:22] our hearts
[51:24] and by the bright light of the word of
[51:25] the hour he has turned the chaos
[51:28] in our lives into a garden of eden
[51:31] but now he's taking satan's eden and
[51:34] turning it into chaos
[51:36] it's moving in the opposite direction of
[51:38] the bride the bride's going up
[51:40] satan's kingdom's coming down the bride
[51:43] is coming to peace
[51:44] amen saint zine is going into chaos
[51:48] it's a there's an exact reflection in
[51:51] the opposite
[51:52] of what's going on be of a good cheer at
[51:56] his eye be not afraid
[51:57] and peter answered him and said lord if
[51:58] it be thou if it be thou
[52:01] bid me come unto thee on the water and
[52:03] he said come
[52:04] and when peter was come down out of the
[52:06] ship he walked on the water to go to
[52:08] jesus
[52:11] it's working the word
[52:15] is working he said if a jew bid me come
[52:18] jesus said come that's the word of the
[52:20] lord
[52:21] and the word is working amen peter is
[52:24] standing on the water
[52:26] not by physical properties he's standing
[52:30] on the word
[52:33] the word is holding him up because jesus
[52:36] said come
[52:37] and the word is working
[52:40] praise god and while the word is working
[52:44] he walked on the water to go to jesus
[52:46] but when he saw the wind boisterous
[52:49] he was afraid and beginning to sink he
[52:53] cried saying lord
[52:54] save me and immediately jesus stretched
[52:57] forth his hand and caught him
[52:59] and said in him oh thou of little faith
[53:02] wherefore did
[53:03] thou doubt
[53:07] the word was working the word was
[53:09] working
[53:10] perfect but he looked
[53:14] at the conditions
[53:17] and got his eyes off of the thing that
[53:19] was working
[53:21] and when he looked at the conditions he
[53:23] began to sink and jesus tells us why
[53:25] he's saying
[53:26] he said why did you doubt
[53:32] the word works by faith but doubt
[53:33] destroys it
[53:35] when he began to doubt he began to go
[53:38] down
[53:41] said god help us help us we've seen the
[53:44] word work how many seen the word work
[53:47] you've seen the word in your life hold
[53:49] you up heal your body
[53:50] deliver you from trouble you've seen the
[53:52] word work over and over and over again
[53:55] now don't look at the boisterous waves
[53:57] and the and the contrary wind
[53:59] don't look to anything else but the very
[54:01] thing that caused you to walk through
[54:03] the previous circumstances
[54:04] will cause you to walk through the next
[54:06] don't look around
[54:08] amen keep focused on this word
[54:12] believe the true report you know
[54:16] the news is not going to help your faith
[54:23] and whenever things happen we become
[54:25] news junkies
[54:27] i put myself in the same mix what's
[54:30] happening you know
[54:31] you know things aren't changing week by
[54:32] week
[54:34] hour by hour
[54:39] but you're looking at vanities
[54:43] and lying vanities and circumstances
[54:47] i'm not saying shouldn't watch the news
[54:49] that's not the point
[54:51] the point is if you stay there and you
[54:54] don't feed on the word
[54:57] if you don't stay in fellowship with the
[55:00] brethren
[55:00] if you don't stay feeding in prayer and
[55:03] feeding on the word of god
[55:05] listening to the message reading your
[55:06] bible in prayer communing with the lord
[55:09] you are going to become overwhelmed by
[55:11] the circumstances
[55:14] we've got it's fine to check the news
[55:16] this is we live in an hour where
[55:19] you better check it you know
[55:23] but you know what if the internet access
[55:25] went off tomorrow
[55:29] and you wake up and the sun's shining
[55:30] and the birds are singing
[55:35] and you got no news feed telling you
[55:36] things are bad
[55:39] you'd have a hard time believing it
[55:43] i like to be like that little squirrel
[55:45] [Applause]
[55:47] i found some corn in this feeder
[55:52] i would have one corn say what one one
[55:54] squirrel says to the next squirrel
[55:56] uh what if it runs out those people keep
[55:59] filling it up
[56:07] and if the feeder goes dry he'll go back
[56:10] to the forest
[56:12] god's made a provision the squirrel's
[56:15] not worried why are we worried
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] the bird can still sing in the morning
[56:21] why can't we
[56:25] we should have a greater revelation than
[56:27] the bird
[56:29] the bird doesn't have a soul
[56:33] we should have greater faith we should
[56:35] wake up singing
[56:36] we should wake up with a song on our
[56:37] heart we should be merry and cheerful
[56:40] because everything we've ever longed for
[56:42] is coming to pass
[56:43] everything our hearts have ever desired
[56:46] amen as we're moving into the cycle
[56:48] we're beginning to see things that we've
[56:49] never seen before
[56:51] amen it's going to bring about amen this
[56:53] cycle plus
[56:54] more and more or however or however long
[56:57] i don't know
[56:58] i don't care but watching things change
[57:00] amen
[57:01] in just a matter of weeks is the most
[57:03] thrilling thing that i've ever
[57:04] experienced in my life
[57:05] amen because we've read the word and
[57:07] we've listened to the message and we've
[57:09] preached it
[57:09] but now we're seeing it
[57:12] [Applause]
[57:14] that's why you go to the grocery store
[57:16] no bread that's okay
[57:19] why is it okay because if i run out of
[57:20] bread i know somebody who can break
[57:22] bread and make more bread there's
[57:25] nothing to be afraid of
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:29] amen and even if there's no bread i know
[57:31] one who can say
[57:32] speak to the squirrels and create where
[57:34] there's nothing
[57:35] [Applause]
[57:37] there's nothing to be afraid of
[57:40] you walk down amen they're out of this
[57:42] that's okay they're out of this that's
[57:44] okay
[57:44] they're out of this where are you gonna
[57:45] get it i don't know but i don't need to
[57:47] know
[57:48] because the word promises me i've never
[57:51] seen the righteous forsaking or god's
[57:53] seed begging for bread
[57:56] why can't i expect him to come on the
[57:58] scene
[57:59] remember the worst of times brought the
[58:01] greatest miracles
[58:04] [Music]
[58:05] we want to see the hand of god moving
[58:07] miraculous ways part the red sea
[58:09] if you were there the day the red sea
[58:11] parted you would have been
[58:12] you would have been in a tumultuous
[58:14] storm your emotions would have been
[58:16] running rampant
[58:20] they would run they freed from the freed
[58:23] from the slavery
[58:24] free from bondage freed from the egypt
[58:26] and now they're in the exodus journey
[58:28] playing tambourines and singing amen and
[58:30] moving along
[58:31] a great company and the pillar of fire
[58:33] leading them everything is perfect
[58:36] amen they've went through the trial in
[58:38] egypt they've been rescued out according
[58:40] to the word of god
[58:41] and that pillar of fire that holy ghost
[58:43] leads them right to a death trap
[58:48] no way to escape no way out
[58:53] but they had no idea that the scripture
[58:56] said
[58:57] the eternal word of god says his ways
[59:00] are in the water
[59:03] his path is in the sea they didn't know
[59:06] but god had already laid a path
[59:09] through the red sea just because you
[59:13] can't see it
[59:13] doesn't mean it's not there
[59:18] i don't see how this is going to work
[59:19] that don't mean a thing
[59:22] i don't see how i'm going to get out of
[59:22] this jam that doesn't mean anything
[59:25] just because you see it doesn't mean
[59:26] it's not there the eternal word of god
[59:28] says
[59:29] his ways are in the waters path is in
[59:31] the sea he had a path
[59:33] in the red sea and nobody knew it but
[59:35] him
[59:36] and but when it was the right time amen
[59:38] when everything
[59:40] when everything got impossible now
[59:46] begin to cry amen and moses doesn't know
[59:48] what to say but he says
[59:49] you just just listen you're going to see
[59:52] the hand of god
[59:53] move and this army fairs over you'll see
[59:56] it no more
[59:57] but everybody said he had no idea what
[59:59] was going to happen
[1:00:00] but he knew one thing god had said you
[1:00:02] take this people and bring him back to
[1:00:04] this mountain
[1:00:06] somehow he had to get to that mountain
[1:00:09] and somehow the bride's got to get
[1:00:11] through
[1:00:11] every one of these obstacles the bride's
[1:00:14] got to overcome
[1:00:15] everything that we're going to face how
[1:00:18] i don't know how but just because i
[1:00:20] can't see it
[1:00:20] amen they may freeze your bank account
[1:00:26] money may crash to nothing
[1:00:29] it's happened in other countries
[1:00:30] recently
[1:00:35] i don't see how i'm going to do this
[1:00:36] praise god that means you're
[1:00:38] you're you are set for a miracle
[1:00:43] it's no longer wringing our hands and
[1:00:46] worrying about
[1:00:47] how this is going to happen but the
[1:00:48] bride has got to come to the place in
[1:00:50] faith in the word of god
[1:00:51] when we get to a place where it's
[1:00:52] impossible then we start to believe for
[1:00:54] the impossible
[1:00:57] and all of a sudden from fear it turns
[1:00:59] to anticipation saying
[1:01:00] i can't see how oh this is good i can't
[1:01:03] wait to see what he's going to do now
[1:01:06] because we're in a pickle now lord
[1:01:10] we're sharing a fix now lord you realize
[1:01:12] you're never going at it alone
[1:01:15] i'll be with you in you
[1:01:20] to the end of the world
[1:01:23] it's you and him together you're not
[1:01:24] doing this by yourself
[1:01:28] why are you going to deliver now i don't
[1:01:30] know
[1:01:32] but his ways are past finding out
[1:01:36] one of the greatest miracles this world
[1:01:38] has ever seen is the parting of the red
[1:01:40] sea
[1:01:41] but it come at one of the greatest times
[1:01:43] of trouble in peril
[1:01:47] we should be excited
[1:01:51] whatever happens next god's in control
[1:01:55] whatever happened yesterday he was in
[1:01:56] control whatever's happening now he's in
[1:01:58] control whatever happens tomorrow
[1:02:00] he's in control
[1:02:03] i've given him my life i'm not going to
[1:02:05] take it back
[1:02:07] start running it myself i don't know
[1:02:09] where that path in the sea is he does
[1:02:13] you understand i don't know
[1:02:17] where to cast a line to pull out the
[1:02:19] fish with the coin in its mouth
[1:02:21] he does he knows there's a fish there
[1:02:25] with a coin in its mouth and he knows
[1:02:28] just when to tell peter
[1:02:29] peter you know it's time to pay taxes we
[1:02:33] ain't got no money
[1:02:36] jesus didn't start looking at the the
[1:02:38] newspaper or we don't do newspapers
[1:02:40] anymore he didn't go to the internet job
[1:02:42] post and say i need to get a second job
[1:02:49] because he had a heavenly father and he
[1:02:51] was there in commission
[1:02:54] we've been commissioned to be here this
[1:02:56] day
[1:02:57] if there's needs we can't meet then
[1:03:00] god's obligated to meet them
[1:03:02] he may do it by giving us work that's
[1:03:04] wonderful we'll do it
[1:03:06] but we don't need to start making
[1:03:07] provisions for ourselves
[1:03:10] god will provide he's promised to
[1:03:12] provide
[1:03:13] why that's such a neat story about that
[1:03:15] fish in the coin's mouth it came at a
[1:03:17] time of need
[1:03:19] and it came through somebody who
[1:03:20] believed that god would meet the need so
[1:03:22] he told peter
[1:03:23] go cast the line in now's the time go
[1:03:26] cast a line
[1:03:27] pull out the fish and in this mouth
[1:03:28] you'll find a coin
[1:03:30] praise be to god i can't wait to hear
[1:03:33] the testimonies that are going to be
[1:03:34] coming soon
[1:03:36] i can't wait to hear what god's going to
[1:03:37] do for you and for me and for all of us
[1:03:40] in our individual circumstances i'm
[1:03:42] excited to see what god will do
[1:03:44] i think we're going to see we wanted to
[1:03:46] see we've wanted to see
[1:03:48] what what we've been told would happen
[1:03:50] all of our lives we've been wanting to
[1:03:51] see greater manifestation
[1:03:53] we've been wanting to see it and you
[1:03:54] can't manufacture it
[1:03:56] you can't make things happen you can't
[1:03:58] manufacture it but when it's god's time
[1:04:01] and when god wants to show himself
[1:04:02] mighty
[1:04:03] amen he says he sets the circumstances
[1:04:06] so perfectly
[1:04:07] that only he can get the credit he puts
[1:04:11] things in such an
[1:04:12] order that no man can glory and no man
[1:04:15] can share in his glory that nobody can
[1:04:17] point to themselves
[1:04:18] god gets it so impossible and so
[1:04:20] difficult
[1:04:21] amen and so beyond human ability that
[1:04:24] when he does it
[1:04:25] everybody says that's god
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:28] and that's what we want that's what
[1:04:29] we're looking for that's what we're
[1:04:30] longing for
[1:04:31] but we got to be willing to go through
[1:04:33] the press to get to the miracle
[1:04:35] we've got to be willing to go amen
[1:04:37] before
[1:04:38] peter could ever witness an angel
[1:04:40] opening prison doors
[1:04:42] he had to get in prison
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:47] before they ever witnessed jesus
[1:04:50] breaking bread and multiplying creation
[1:04:52] they had to get to a place where there's
[1:04:54] no way to feed this crowd
[1:04:56] we're out in the wilderness the people
[1:04:57] will faint along the way we're in an
[1:04:59] impossible situation
[1:05:00] we send them home they're going to be
[1:05:02] dying we don't have enough money to buy
[1:05:04] enough food we're out here in the
[1:05:05] wilderness
[1:05:05] when he got to the need then he supplied
[1:05:08] the need
[1:05:09] don't be afraid to get a need
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:14] now don't put yourself in need
[1:05:17] so i'm gonna rack up all my credit cards
[1:05:19] right now and the system will crumble
[1:05:21] and god will take care of me
[1:05:23] no we gotta act like christians all the
[1:05:25] way through
[1:05:28] but don't be afraid
[1:05:38] praise the lord mark 4.
[1:05:50] mark 4 35
[1:05:58] in the same day when the even was come
[1:06:00] he saith unto them let us pass over to
[1:06:02] the other side
[1:06:04] key phrase let's hold on to that phrase
[1:06:08] key phrase let us pass over to the other
[1:06:11] side
[1:06:12] you know what that is that's the word of
[1:06:13] the lord
[1:06:15] so he just gave them the word of the
[1:06:17] lord let us pass over to the other side
[1:06:20] all right
[1:06:24] and when they had sent away the
[1:06:26] multitude they took him even
[1:06:27] as he was in the ship and they were also
[1:06:30] with them other little ships and there
[1:06:31] arose a great storm of wind and the
[1:06:33] waves beat into the
[1:06:35] the waves beat unto the ship so that it
[1:06:37] was now full
[1:06:38] and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:06:39] ship asleep on a pillow
[1:06:44] i don't think he was worried
[1:06:48] asleep on a pillow and they awake him
[1:06:51] and say unto him master carest thou not
[1:06:53] that we perish
[1:06:54] what an accusation
[1:06:57] do you see what fear does
[1:07:01] fear causes us to blame god
[1:07:04] instead of turning to god in faith and
[1:07:06] saying god i trust you in this storm
[1:07:08] but fear will turn you say god why did
[1:07:10] you let this happen
[1:07:12] what a horrible statement to make what a
[1:07:15] terrible thing to say to god of all
[1:07:17] creation
[1:07:18] how dare we as human beings turn to an
[1:07:20] almighty righteous and perfect god and
[1:07:22] say god
[1:07:23] how could you let this happen my
[1:07:25] goodness he does everything perfect he
[1:07:26] does everything right amen they should
[1:07:28] have never looked at jesus and said
[1:07:30] don't you care that we perish what a
[1:07:32] horrible thing to say to the lord of
[1:07:34] glory the one who had provided for them
[1:07:36] the one who had taken care of them the
[1:07:38] one who instructed them
[1:07:40] but you see how deadly fear is it'll
[1:07:43] have you
[1:07:44] making accusations against god
[1:07:48] instead of operating by faith and say
[1:07:50] god i trust you and i know your word
[1:07:51] says and in every situation i'm going to
[1:07:53] trust in you
[1:07:54] because you're the mighty god because
[1:07:56] you're the all-powerful one because
[1:07:57] you've done
[1:07:58] greater things than this in the past and
[1:08:00] i'm standing on you because you're
[1:08:02] big you're strong you're powerful you're
[1:08:04] mighty
[1:08:06] not you're unjust and you're uncaring
[1:08:09] and you're unfeeling
[1:08:13] you see the difference we've got to grow
[1:08:17] up and quit being children
[1:08:19] we've got to start acting like a bride
[1:08:20] amen the bride who's come to full
[1:08:22] maturity
[1:08:23] and quit acting like little kids
[1:08:25] throwing accusations towards god
[1:08:28] god is perfect in all of his ways and
[1:08:31] everything has to be this way
[1:08:33] the clock is ticking right on time
[1:08:38] when we get in trouble let's just cry
[1:08:40] out to his majesty
[1:08:42] let's acknowledge his glory let's recite
[1:08:46] all the things he's done for us in the
[1:08:48] past let's talk about all the wonder
[1:08:50] let's speak back to god all the
[1:08:52] wonderful things he's done for us and
[1:08:54] all that he means to us
[1:08:55] and how perfect and beautiful he is and
[1:08:57] all that he's done through the ages and
[1:08:59] all that he's done in the bible
[1:09:00] i'm telling you we'll get somewhere
[1:09:03] we'll get a whole lot farther than
[1:09:05] crying out saying god why did you do
[1:09:06] this and why did you do that and what
[1:09:09] yes sir we need to repent for that kind
[1:09:11] of praying
[1:09:12] [Applause]
[1:09:16] they said charist thou not that we
[1:09:18] perish and he arose and rebuked the wind
[1:09:20] and said unto the sea
[1:09:21] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[1:09:24] there was a great calm
[1:09:25] and he said unto them why are you so
[1:09:27] fearful
[1:09:29] how is it that you have no faith
[1:09:36] he's asking a question because they've
[1:09:38] already seen
[1:09:39] miracles they've already seen him speak
[1:09:42] and it happens
[1:09:43] speak and it happens they've seen him
[1:09:46] heal the sick
[1:09:47] they seen him do all these things and
[1:09:49] now they come to a great crisis in their
[1:09:51] life
[1:09:51] and they have stay they go back to
[1:09:53] amnesia and forgot everything that
[1:09:55] they've seen him do
[1:09:56] and they start to say how is it that you
[1:09:58] don't even care about us
[1:09:59] my he already gave you his word and he
[1:10:01] said let us pass to the other side
[1:10:04] nothing was going to stop that boat from
[1:10:06] getting to the other side
[1:10:07] because the lord said let us us us
[1:10:10] i would include myself and us when he
[1:10:12] said let us pass to the other side
[1:10:14] if i'm in that boat today i said he
[1:10:16] promised me i'm getting to the other
[1:10:17] side
[1:10:18] because i'm part of us
[1:10:21] there's got to come a spiritual maturity
[1:10:23] where we can take the word that way
[1:10:25] he said if he said let us pass i'm as
[1:10:27] safe as if he gets there i get there
[1:10:29] he's going to go there i'm going to stay
[1:10:31] next to him
[1:10:32] i might just lay down next to him
[1:10:35] because all my efforts are not working
[1:10:37] the boat's still filling up i can't bail
[1:10:39] it fast enough i can't row it fast
[1:10:40] enough i can't fight the wind there's
[1:10:42] nothing else i can do
[1:10:43] i might as well rest with him because he
[1:10:45] said let
[1:10:46] us pass to the other side i'm part of us
[1:10:49] and we're going to the other side
[1:10:52] it's not my responsibility to keep water
[1:10:54] out of the boat
[1:10:56] i've done all i can do i can't do any
[1:10:58] more
[1:11:00] you see god gets us to places where
[1:11:02] we've done all that we can do
[1:11:05] we can't do any more
[1:11:09] that's when he shows up on the scene but
[1:11:12] let's go to him in faith
[1:11:14] let's go to next time we have a need a
[1:11:17] deep need something difficult we're
[1:11:20] facing
[1:11:21] why don't we go to him and start saying
[1:11:24] god you healed the leper
[1:11:26] you opened the blinded eyes you healed
[1:11:29] me when i was sick
[1:11:30] you fed me and clothed me all these
[1:11:33] years
[1:11:34] you've given me a home and you give me a
[1:11:36] family and you've watched over me i've
[1:11:38] never lacked a thing in my life
[1:11:40] that's your great provision why is it we
[1:11:43] forget the breaking of bread
[1:11:45] why is it we forget the healing why is
[1:11:47] it we forget all that he's ever done
[1:11:50] we've got to grow up we've got to be
[1:11:52] mature this is a different season in a
[1:11:54] different time and he ordained you to be
[1:11:56] here
[1:11:58] childish things are not going to work
[1:12:00] anymore it's over with
[1:12:01] it's time for maturity says in awakening
[1:12:08] jesus
[1:12:09] could you imagine job enjoying being
[1:12:11] broke out with boils and all these
[1:12:12] things
[1:12:13] losing all of his wealth and his
[1:12:14] children and everything it wasn't very
[1:12:16] easy but god was proving to satan that
[1:12:17] he had somebody he could put confidence
[1:12:19] in
[1:12:20] maybe he's trying to do the same thing
[1:12:22] in your case and the rest of you oh
[1:12:24] they'll forsake you oh no job they
[1:12:26] couldn't make job do that no sir
[1:12:28] he's only trying to prove them remember
[1:12:31] in a few minutes he said
[1:12:33] oh ye of little faith couldn't you
[1:12:34] understand about the breaking the bread
[1:12:36] and feeding 5000
[1:12:37] don't you know i'm the same jehovah that
[1:12:39] fed them for 40 years out there in the
[1:12:40] wilderness
[1:12:41] out of ovens out of heaven when i poured
[1:12:43] it out every night
[1:12:44] what you so scared about don't you know
[1:12:47] i dried up the red sea one day
[1:12:48] don't you know i opened the earth and
[1:12:50] swallowed the unbeliever one day i
[1:12:52] measured the earth and spurred it off
[1:12:53] out in space yonder
[1:12:54] and he's the he's in the ship now that's
[1:12:58] not
[1:12:58] mythical that's the truth
[1:13:04] the same holy ghost who was brooding
[1:13:07] over the earth
[1:13:10] and took the word of god when it was
[1:13:12] spoken and brought it to pass
[1:13:16] brother brennan said he pulled up
[1:13:17] mountains and trees what was it the
[1:13:19] brooding of the holy ghost
[1:13:21] the same one that turned a judgment and
[1:13:24] chaos of a world into an
[1:13:26] eden that same holy ghost is in the
[1:13:27] bride
[1:13:29] he's in the boat the same one that
[1:13:32] brought to pass the full word of god in
[1:13:34] creation
[1:13:35] amen when we read it in genesis the same
[1:13:37] one is in the boat
[1:13:46] see same now he tries to prove us
[1:13:49] and see where we'll stand or not
[1:13:52] take a revival away start an argument in
[1:13:54] the church just to see what you'll do
[1:13:56] turn satan loose among you see how
[1:13:59] you'll stand
[1:14:00] let him strike you with something see
[1:14:01] what kind of stand you'll take
[1:14:03] job said though he slayed me yet i'll
[1:14:05] trust him amen that's
[1:14:06] it shadrach meshach and abednego our god
[1:14:09] is able to deliver us from the fire but
[1:14:10] nevertheless we will not
[1:14:11] give up praise be they're gone
[1:14:16] let's turn to job just want to look at a
[1:14:19] few more scriptures here
[1:14:21] let's look at job
[1:14:25] 3 job chapter 3.
[1:14:32] he lays down a fantastic principle
[1:14:36] out of job and the prophet comes and
[1:14:38] will read what he says about it
[1:14:40] job chapter 3 and verse 25
[1:14:45] for the thing which i greatly feared has
[1:14:47] come upon me
[1:14:49] and that which i was afraid of is come
[1:14:51] unto me
[1:14:53] lock that in your heart for the thing
[1:14:56] which i greatly feared has come upon me
[1:14:57] and that which i was afraid of has come
[1:14:59] unto me brother man says in perfect
[1:15:03] faith in the book of job it says here
[1:15:04] joke feared and what he
[1:15:06] what he feared it actually happened
[1:15:10] do you realize that there's a power of
[1:15:13] creation
[1:15:14] in the children of god
[1:15:18] there is a power of creation brother
[1:15:20] branham said
[1:15:21] inside of you if you are a seed of god
[1:15:24] inside of you is enough power to speak
[1:15:26] another world into existence and go live
[1:15:28] a private life on it
[1:15:31] but that power is controlled by faith
[1:15:36] you know there's a power brother man
[1:15:38] said you have a power
[1:15:40] to create an atmosphere around you that
[1:15:42] others can step in
[1:15:45] that power has been entrusted into the
[1:15:48] bride
[1:15:49] we've got to be careful how we use it
[1:15:52] because we can create a negative
[1:15:54] atmosphere
[1:15:55] just as much as a positive atmosphere
[1:16:00] and sometimes we get what we believe we
[1:16:06] believe it's not going to work out it's
[1:16:08] not going to work out if we believe
[1:16:11] we're going to be rejected we're going
[1:16:12] to be rejected
[1:16:14] if we believe amen we're going to get
[1:16:16] sick we're going to get sick
[1:16:20] i've seen it happen i've seen it in my
[1:16:22] own family somebody gets sick the other
[1:16:23] person's not sick but they start working
[1:16:25] they're going to say go
[1:16:26] to and you say you're not going to get
[1:16:27] sick you're going to be fine and next
[1:16:28] thing you know they're getting sick
[1:16:30] and there's nothing wrong with them and
[1:16:32] they started to worry and get fearful
[1:16:34] and get scared and they begin to
[1:16:35] manifest the thing they believed
[1:16:38] i've also seen them i've also seen the
[1:16:40] opposite happen one sec the other arms
[1:16:42] feeling saying oh god
[1:16:43] you're not sick you're fine everything's
[1:16:44] okay let's go do this and
[1:16:46] nothing ever happens
[1:16:51] we get what we believe let's make sure
[1:16:54] we believe the word
[1:16:57] what he feared it actually happened what
[1:16:59] brought it his fear
[1:17:02] what made it happen his fear what
[1:17:05] brought it his fear
[1:17:06] that's what made it happen his faith
[1:17:09] would have kept him from it but his fear
[1:17:11] brought him brought it to him
[1:17:14] oh now's the time to say god take away
[1:17:16] my fears
[1:17:18] oh god rid me of this fear i denounce it
[1:17:21] you know and it's one thing
[1:17:22] uh i'll just i'll inject this here it's
[1:17:24] one thing to say god take away the fear
[1:17:26] take away the fear take away this
[1:17:28] but you realize that you've got to fight
[1:17:30] for every inch of ground that you gain
[1:17:31] this promised land is ours but we've got
[1:17:33] to fight for it
[1:17:34] and there's no longer going around
[1:17:35] fearful ringing your hands bringing your
[1:17:36] hands scared all the time and saying god
[1:17:38] take it away from me no
[1:17:39] you've got to fight for it you've got to
[1:17:41] actually do battle with the devil
[1:17:43] because that's a spirit of fear
[1:17:44] and you say well i've got anxiety
[1:17:46] anxiety is fear
[1:17:48] it's the same thing anxiety well i've
[1:17:50] got to say don't ever say you've got
[1:17:52] anxiety
[1:17:53] never ever say you've got anxiety
[1:17:56] or say i've heard people say well my
[1:17:58] anxiety is high you
[1:18:00] you just owned it you just claimed it as
[1:18:04] yours and laid claim to and say my
[1:18:06] anxiety
[1:18:07] don't have anxiety you don't have to
[1:18:09] have anxiety you don't have to live with
[1:18:11] anxiety
[1:18:12] you don't have to live with fear those
[1:18:13] things come from demons and we don't
[1:18:15] have to live with the influence of
[1:18:17] demons
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:19] but we've got to actually fight back
[1:18:21] according to the word
[1:18:23] and you say he's not given me the spirit
[1:18:25] of fear
[1:18:28] this is not this is not my portion this
[1:18:30] is not my life
[1:18:31] lord i'm not standing in line for this
[1:18:33] but but we've got to actually do battle
[1:18:35] with the devil
[1:18:36] and when you feel that anxious spirit
[1:18:38] coming on because it's not your anxiety
[1:18:40] it's an anxious spirit it's a
[1:18:42] demon spirit and when you feel that
[1:18:46] demon spirit getting close
[1:18:47] amen and those who've struggled with
[1:18:49] that you know what it's like when you
[1:18:51] feel that demon getting close
[1:18:54] and when you begin to feel like it's an
[1:18:56] inevitable conclusion it's inevitable
[1:18:58] i know the path this comes i get worried
[1:19:01] and fearful and i start to get depressed
[1:19:03] you don't have to go down the usual path
[1:19:06] anymore
[1:19:06] don't take it as an inevitable outcome
[1:19:09] when you start feeling this anxious
[1:19:10] demon
[1:19:11] say i recognize that's a devil and god
[1:19:14] has not given me the spirit of fear
[1:19:16] and i resist you satan in the name of
[1:19:18] jesus christ
[1:19:19] evoke the name of god stand on your
[1:19:21] privileges and on the promises give you
[1:19:23] and do battle with the devil
[1:19:26] don't just roll over and say oh my
[1:19:29] anxiety
[1:19:30] you're going to have it for the rest of
[1:19:32] your life if you talk like that
[1:19:34] and the whole time you'll be saying god
[1:19:36] take it away god take it away god take
[1:19:37] away but you're not doing what he told
[1:19:39] you to do
[1:19:40] amen to cast down reasoning
[1:19:44] that's what he told us to do not him to
[1:19:47] do he told us to cast down reasoning
[1:19:50] amen and bring every thought captive to
[1:19:53] the obedience of christ
[1:19:56] we don't just because it's a thought
[1:19:58] doesn't mean we have to dwell on it
[1:19:59] we're supposed to take that thing
[1:20:00] captive arrest it handcuff it
[1:20:02] and prison and bring it to the obedience
[1:20:03] of christ and say that thought does not
[1:20:05] match this word and i reject it in jesus
[1:20:07] name
[1:20:08] and i would say it out loud if you
[1:20:10] struggle with anxiety or fear i would
[1:20:12] say it out loud
[1:20:13] because there's fearful things moving
[1:20:15] upon the earth and if you don't conquer
[1:20:16] this now
[1:20:17] you're going to be overwhelmed by it now
[1:20:20] is the time to overcome
[1:20:22] overcome anxiety now is the time to
[1:20:24] overcome fear and it's a
[1:20:25] spiritual warfare
[1:20:27] [Applause]
[1:20:28] we've got to fight it with the word of
[1:20:31] god
[1:20:32] not think a happy thought i'll think
[1:20:35] anxiety's come i'm thinking of a happy
[1:20:37] place with daisies and
[1:20:39] little deer running around the field no
[1:20:42] we take the word of god which is the
[1:20:43] sword
[1:20:45] and we press it with a strong hand of
[1:20:46] faith to the heart of the enemy and we
[1:20:48] keep driving that word and driving that
[1:20:50] word and driving that word
[1:20:52] to the heart of the enemy it takes a
[1:20:54] strong hand of faith to say
[1:20:55] he said i don't have he has not given me
[1:20:58] the spirit of fear and i'm
[1:21:00] bringing this thought captive to the
[1:21:02] obedience of christ
[1:21:03] satan i reject you in jesus name
[1:21:07] now it's time to rise up with everything
[1:21:09] he could what more could be given to us
[1:21:11] we've got the whole book has been
[1:21:13] unsealed we've got the whole bible
[1:21:15] and we've been demonstrated before us on
[1:21:17] the wave sheep we know exactly what to
[1:21:19] do with the word
[1:21:20] we've seen it demonstrated we've heard
[1:21:22] it preached we've watched
[1:21:23] miracle after miracle you can listen to
[1:21:25] tape and prayer lines there is no excuse
[1:21:27] anymore friends
[1:21:28] for living in immaturity this is time to
[1:21:31] rise up
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:35] amen this is the time
[1:21:40] praise be to god
[1:21:44] but chad i there's no buts but my second
[1:21:48] there's no buts
[1:21:50] but you don't know god knows he wrote
[1:21:52] the word
[1:21:53] he made the provision if there's not
[1:21:55] something in this word to help you
[1:21:56] overcome
[1:21:57] then the word is failed if the spirit of
[1:22:00] god cannot deliver you then it's failed
[1:22:04] don't make excuses for your condition
[1:22:08] don't accept it it doesn't matter if you
[1:22:10] have to fight it every day
[1:22:11] it doesn't matter if you have to fight
[1:22:12] it every five minutes fight it
[1:22:14] fight it fight it until when until it's
[1:22:17] gone
[1:22:21] we've got this is a mighty marching army
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:24] this is not time to be children
[1:22:28] to be adults god had gave us a message
[1:22:32] 50 some years ago
[1:22:35] i mean how long are we going to wait
[1:22:39] how long is it going to take to come to
[1:22:41] maturity how long is it going to take to
[1:22:43] overcome the obstacles laid before us
[1:22:47] he didn't give us his word so we can be
[1:22:48] overcome he gave us the words for we
[1:22:50] could overcome
[1:22:56] doesn't mean things won't be hard things
[1:22:58] are supposed to be hard
[1:23:03] remember when it was time for a showdown
[1:23:04] on mount carmel
[1:23:06] god didn't look for an easy showdown
[1:23:09] they were in the time of drought
[1:23:13] they had problems they had false
[1:23:15] teaching the
[1:23:16] the nation was split between serving bao
[1:23:19] and
[1:23:20] serving god so he's going to have a
[1:23:23] showdown and
[1:23:24] he lets the 400 prophets go first and
[1:23:26] he's just got one prophet standing here
[1:23:30] he lets 400 against one god really likes
[1:23:33] those odds
[1:23:35] remember when he sent job to be the
[1:23:38] judge over israel to fight the battle
[1:23:40] and then they gathered all that they
[1:23:41] could gather and it was like 30 some
[1:23:42] thousand 32 or 33
[1:23:44] 000 people amen and it was it was a
[1:23:47] minuscule army compared to what they
[1:23:48] were fighting against but it was the
[1:23:49] best they can do
[1:23:50] and the first thing god says is there's
[1:23:52] too many here send home
[1:23:53] everybody who's afraid
[1:23:57] amen god doesn't need people he needs
[1:24:00] people who believe
[1:24:03] he doesn't need numbers he needs one
[1:24:05] person who can believe
[1:24:08] and that day he sent home everybody that
[1:24:10] was fearful and 22
[1:24:11] 000 leaves leaving like 10 000 or 11 000
[1:24:14] people
[1:24:15] they lost two-thirds of their army
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:22] oh god's not afraid to be in the
[1:24:24] minority because god's always the
[1:24:26] majority he created
[1:24:27] everything amen he's in control of
[1:24:29] everything he just needs somebody to
[1:24:32] believe
[1:24:32] he doesn't need numbers amen he just
[1:24:34] needs somebody to take him at his word
[1:24:39] oh praise god amen
[1:24:44] let's go to psalms 91.
[1:24:50] oh i love the word of god
[1:24:58] can you see why satan wants to shut down
[1:25:01] churches
[1:25:03] because he knows what you know what he
[1:25:05] wants you to do we're to gather to
[1:25:07] provoke one another
[1:25:09] let's poke each other along to love and
[1:25:12] good works
[1:25:14] the forsaken not the assembling together
[1:25:15] of ourselves even the more so you see
[1:25:17] why you'd like to create scenarios that
[1:25:19] keep us from gathering together
[1:25:22] because it's an encouragement to the
[1:25:23] believers to stand on the word of god
[1:25:25] you know what he'd love to do shut it
[1:25:27] down send everybody back
[1:25:28] and give you free internet access to
[1:25:30] watch all the news you could watch
[1:25:32] binge on the news but don't come
[1:25:34] together to encourage each other in the
[1:25:36] word
[1:25:38] because the word will defeat all the
[1:25:40] lies of the enemy any place
[1:25:43] any time under any condition
[1:25:48] amen that's why we've got to gather
[1:25:50] together no matter what happens we have
[1:25:51] to gather together
[1:25:53] it's a scriptural mandate praise be to
[1:25:56] god
[1:25:58] psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in
[1:26:01] the secret place of the most high
[1:26:04] shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:26:06] almighty
[1:26:08] what other shadow do you want to be
[1:26:09] under
[1:26:12] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[1:26:14] and my fortress my god
[1:26:16] in him will i trust surely he shall
[1:26:19] deliver thee from the snare of the
[1:26:20] fowler and from the noise and pestilence
[1:26:23] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:26:24] and under his wings shalt thou
[1:26:26] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[1:26:28] buckler
[1:26:30] his what his truth shall be your shield
[1:26:34] and buckler
[1:26:36] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:26:38] by night nor for the arrow that flieth
[1:26:39] by day
[1:26:40] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:26:42] darkness nor for the
[1:26:43] destruction that wasted at noonday a
[1:26:46] thousand shall fall at thy
[1:26:48] side and ten 000 at thy right hand but
[1:26:50] it shall not come nigh thee
[1:26:54] put this on your refrigerator
[1:26:58] put it on your phone screensaver
[1:27:00] whatever you need to do
[1:27:01] until this becomes part of your language
[1:27:06] only with thine eyes shalt thou behold
[1:27:08] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:27:10] because thou has made the lord which is
[1:27:12] my refuge even the most high
[1:27:14] thy habitation there shall no evil be
[1:27:16] fail thee
[1:27:17] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:27:19] dwelling
[1:27:22] praise be to god you've got the word on
[1:27:24] it
[1:27:25] now let's just stand on the word and
[1:27:27] believe the word
[1:27:31] let's not be afraid
[1:27:35] remember god had secretly
[1:27:39] anointed a new king in israel
[1:27:43] and it was undercover it was just in one
[1:27:46] family and one house
[1:27:48] only the members of that family
[1:27:49] witnessed it and he anointed
[1:27:51] he had anointed little david king over
[1:27:54] israel
[1:27:56] and david knew and his brothers knew it
[1:27:58] but his brothers probably had some
[1:28:00] doubts
[1:28:02] samuel wasn't doubting and david wasn't
[1:28:04] doubting
[1:28:07] and there come a time where the armies
[1:28:09] of the philistines were gathered against
[1:28:10] israel and
[1:28:11] they were going to wage war and saul you
[1:28:14] know who was head and shoulders above
[1:28:17] i mean a full head and shoulders above
[1:28:19] the rest of the israelites he was their
[1:28:21] champion he was their mighty warrior
[1:28:23] mighty man
[1:28:24] but there was another champion greater
[1:28:26] than him
[1:28:28] do you realize there's always somebody
[1:28:31] bigger
[1:28:34] somebody's always got a bigger gun
[1:28:38] a better weapon a better defense you
[1:28:41] know it
[1:28:42] it's always when you think you've made
[1:28:44] to the top then you see there's another
[1:28:46] top
[1:28:48] but god's not looking for that that's
[1:28:51] what the devil's looking for
[1:28:55] he brings this champion who's goliath
[1:28:58] and
[1:28:58] you know saul's a giant but he's a giant
[1:29:00] among giants
[1:29:02] and and david's father sends him up to
[1:29:05] check on the battle and check on his
[1:29:06] brothers and he does
[1:29:08] and he hears i want to look at this
[1:29:10] scripture let's look at this scripture
[1:29:12] together
[1:29:13] let's look at first samuel 17.
[1:29:16] let's just go through this one together
[1:29:24] first samuel 17 10.
[1:29:35] in first samuel 17 10 it says and the
[1:29:37] philistines said i defy the armies of
[1:29:39] israel this day
[1:29:40] give me a man that may that we may fight
[1:29:43] together
[1:29:44] when saul and all israel heard those
[1:29:46] words of the philistine
[1:29:47] they were dismayed and greatly afraid
[1:29:54] they had a promise they had a promise
[1:29:57] that goes all the way back to abraham
[1:30:00] said thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:30:03] their enemy
[1:30:06] they had the word of god on it they had
[1:30:08] a promise
[1:30:10] but the giant to them was bigger than
[1:30:12] the promise
[1:30:16] see that's always the problem when the
[1:30:18] cancer
[1:30:20] when the debt when the financial trouble
[1:30:22] when
[1:30:23] when these circumstances whenever they
[1:30:25] start to look bigger than the word of
[1:30:26] god
[1:30:27] we are in big trouble big trouble we're
[1:30:31] set up defeat we'll be hiding in the
[1:30:32] tents
[1:30:34] but little david who had no armor who
[1:30:36] had no skill
[1:30:37] who had no weaponry he just had an
[1:30:40] anointing
[1:30:42] and under a prophet who had called him
[1:30:44] out and anointed him
[1:30:46] under a calling and under an anointing
[1:30:48] he had
[1:30:49] faith in his circumcision which was the
[1:30:51] seal of god
[1:30:52] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:54] and he knew that baptism of the holy
[1:30:56] ghost that seal
[1:30:57] put him in the covenant with abraham and
[1:31:00] he's in the abrahamic covenant
[1:31:02] by the seal amen which is sealing the
[1:31:04] faith of abraham
[1:31:05] and now that sign makes him part of that
[1:31:08] covenant
[1:31:08] and they all had it saul had it
[1:31:12] the rest of the camp had it but they had
[1:31:14] lost confidence
[1:31:16] in the promise of god in the word of god
[1:31:18] and they lost confidence in the seal of
[1:31:20] god
[1:31:23] remember if we've got the baptism of the
[1:31:25] holy ghost we've got the very life of
[1:31:26] jesus christ on the inside
[1:31:28] how could we lose confidence in that how
[1:31:30] can we be overcome how can we be
[1:31:32] overtaken
[1:31:33] how can we be destroyed with the very
[1:31:35] literal life of jesus christ on the
[1:31:37] inside
[1:31:39] they had the seal but they had lost
[1:31:41] confidence in the seal
[1:31:43] they begin to doubt to seal because in
[1:31:46] their eyes
[1:31:47] goliath was more powerful than the
[1:31:49] covenant
[1:31:51] but i'm telling you there's nothing more
[1:31:53] powerful than the covenant
[1:31:55] and this covenant is a new covenant
[1:31:57] sealed by the blood of the creator
[1:31:59] himself
[1:32:00] his created blood when he made his own
[1:32:02] body spilt that blood
[1:32:03] amen and that became the seal of the
[1:32:05] covenant and we're sealed under by the
[1:32:07] baptism of the holy ghost to that
[1:32:09] covenant and the purchase price has been
[1:32:11] paid and everything that adam lost has
[1:32:13] been restored
[1:32:14] and it's inside of us now
[1:32:19] if we start to look at the goliaths out
[1:32:21] there and they start to look bigger than
[1:32:23] that promise
[1:32:24] we're in big trouble it's time to repent
[1:32:26] it's time to find a place
[1:32:28] to crawl down on our hands and knees and
[1:32:30] say god forgive me
[1:32:31] i've been i've been giving more favor to
[1:32:34] goliath than i have to your promised
[1:32:36] word
[1:32:39] i'm part of the covenant of christ i'm
[1:32:41] part of the seed of christ
[1:32:43] i'm by faith the royal seed of abraham
[1:32:45] and the promises that was natural to
[1:32:47] abraham is spiritual to me now
[1:32:49] and i shall possess the gates of my
[1:32:52] enemy
[1:32:54] this is not time to let news get bigger
[1:32:57] than god
[1:32:58] and news hey you guess what it's just a
[1:33:00] few little ink marks on a piece of paper
[1:33:02] but if you take
[1:33:03] faith in those ink marks on a piece of
[1:33:05] paper it'll live and it'll destroy any
[1:33:07] goliath that stands before you
[1:33:10] remember it wasn't david who destroyed
[1:33:12] goliath it was the promise that was in
[1:33:14] his life
[1:33:15] amen it was a covenant that was given to
[1:33:17] abraham god had to take that little rock
[1:33:19] and smash it between the eyes of that
[1:33:21] devil because he was standing
[1:33:23] on the word of god he said how can this
[1:33:27] uncircumcised philistine
[1:33:29] defy the armies of the living god
[1:33:32] to him size didn't matter capacity
[1:33:34] didn't matter
[1:33:35] armament didn't matter the only thing
[1:33:37] that mattered is he's uncircumcised
[1:33:39] we're circumcised he's not in the
[1:33:41] covenant we're in the covenant he has no
[1:33:44] promise
[1:33:44] i have a promise you realize he didn't
[1:33:48] look at his ability he didn't look at
[1:33:49] his strength he didn't look at his armor
[1:33:51] he didn't calculate
[1:33:53] any measure
[1:34:01] it's not our job to calculate how
[1:34:06] but to take what he's given us and
[1:34:07] brother ma'am said what did he have a
[1:34:08] little slingshot of faith
[1:34:11] it had worked before
[1:34:15] and it worked with the lion and then it
[1:34:16] worked with the bear and this little
[1:34:18] face he said
[1:34:19] not some great big faith just that
[1:34:21] little common faith you already got
[1:34:24] the one that's already in your hand
[1:34:26] shamgar didn't need a new weapon he
[1:34:28] needed the one that he'd been using
[1:34:30] all along amen it worked as a cattle
[1:34:32] prod it worked all
[1:34:34] and all of a sudden he had to realize
[1:34:35] whatever i've got in my head
[1:34:37] is enough
[1:34:40] whatever god has given us is enough
[1:34:43] that faith that got us through sickness
[1:34:45] in the family that faith that's got us
[1:34:47] this far
[1:34:48] amen that's the faith that will carry us
[1:34:50] all the way through if we don't lose
[1:34:51] confidence in what's in our hands
[1:34:54] and don't lose confidence in the word of
[1:34:56] god amen
[1:34:59] you realize when little david
[1:35:03] i mean little david shows up big men
[1:35:07] big armies big armor big everything
[1:35:12] and they're all greatly afraid
[1:35:16] when david starts to speak it creates
[1:35:19] such a different atmosphere
[1:35:23] that everybody starts to notice
[1:35:26] and some people get angry
[1:35:32] they get angry because it's exposing
[1:35:34] their unbelief
[1:35:37] iliad his oldest brother should have
[1:35:39] believed he should have ran out there
[1:35:41] and tackled that giant because he had
[1:35:42] the same promise david had
[1:35:47] got angry with him but some took notice
[1:35:52] and his faith and the atmosphere he
[1:35:54] created went all the way to the top
[1:35:57] all the way to the king and you know how
[1:35:59] much faith he had he had so much faith
[1:36:01] that the king was willing to let him go
[1:36:03] fight the giant
[1:36:04] you realize this is a ridiculous
[1:36:06] scenario the whole picture is absolutely
[1:36:09] absurd
[1:36:10] but he has such confidence in such faith
[1:36:12] and they couldn't talk him out of it and
[1:36:14] they couldn't persuade him i mean saul
[1:36:16] was using the best
[1:36:17] reasoning and logic of the day so i was
[1:36:19] saying you're but a youth he's the
[1:36:21] warrior from his youth he's got all this
[1:36:23] you've got nothing
[1:36:24] he's been trained you've got no training
[1:36:26] what's he he's hitting him with
[1:36:27] reasoning
[1:36:27] and david's coming back with faith a
[1:36:31] faith that worked in the wilderness a
[1:36:32] faith that worked with the bear a faith
[1:36:34] that worked with the lion
[1:36:35] and the same god who delivered them into
[1:36:38] my hands
[1:36:38] will deliver this uncircumcised
[1:36:41] philistine into my hands
[1:36:45] praise god don't lose confidence in this
[1:36:48] hour don't get scared don't let the news
[1:36:51] sway
[1:36:52] you one bit we've already heard the good
[1:36:54] news what's what the gospel is the good
[1:36:56] news you've heard the gospel you've
[1:36:58] heard the true report you've heard the
[1:36:59] good news
[1:37:00] don't believe the rest of it it's lying
[1:37:04] vanities god will deliver us
[1:37:07] from every child brother ben said
[1:37:10] don't fear fear is of the devil
[1:37:14] that should make it easier to rebuke it
[1:37:19] everything jesus would say fear not fear
[1:37:21] not constantly fear not fear not is that
[1:37:23] right always fear not
[1:37:25] now god don't want you to fear he wants
[1:37:27] you to believe
[1:37:29] he goes on another message after through
[1:37:31] the service of this week i try to show
[1:37:33] people that there's no need of being
[1:37:34] scared
[1:37:36] the worst thing the devil can put upon
[1:37:38] you is fear
[1:37:40] did you hear that friends worse than
[1:37:43] cancer
[1:37:44] is fear of cancer because we've got a
[1:37:47] god who's already healed of cancer
[1:37:50] he's healed people in this assembly
[1:37:52] that's been prayed for
[1:37:53] right here healed them of cancer cancer
[1:37:56] is nothing to be afraid of
[1:37:59] the worst thing he can put on you is not
[1:38:01] cancer it's not diabetes
[1:38:03] it's not heart disease it's not
[1:38:05] blindness the worst thing he put on you
[1:38:06] is fear
[1:38:07] because with fear you can never overcome
[1:38:10] but with
[1:38:10] faith you can overcome every one of
[1:38:12] those things
[1:38:15] the worst thing he could put on us is
[1:38:16] fear
[1:38:20] the worst thing the devil can put upon
[1:38:21] you is fear if you have had cancer and
[1:38:24] didn't fear you'd believe god would heal
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:25] you wouldn't be in too bad of shape god
[1:38:28] take care of that
[1:38:29] if you were sick whatever if you didn't
[1:38:31] fear so fear is one of the worst things
[1:38:33] that satan can place upon the person
[1:38:36] another message that there's only two
[1:38:38] faculties that govern a human
[1:38:40] one of them is faith which brings
[1:38:42] results
[1:38:46] and the other is fear which has no value
[1:38:48] in it at
[1:38:49] all faith is of god
[1:38:54] fears of the devil you know what you'll
[1:38:57] find out when anxiety and fear comes and
[1:38:59] if you're predisposed to that because
[1:39:01] some human beings are because of the
[1:39:02] genetic makeup
[1:39:04] if you're predisposed to that you really
[1:39:07] what happens is you feel like you're
[1:39:10] nervous or anxious or fearful all the
[1:39:12] time
[1:39:12] and you feel like you have no faith but
[1:39:15] that's a lie of the devil
[1:39:17] you have faith you've got plenty of
[1:39:19] faith you've got good faith
[1:39:21] the problem is the fear is overshadowing
[1:39:23] the faith
[1:39:24] if we would resist and reject properly
[1:39:26] by the word the spirit of fear
[1:39:28] when that fear left you'd realize you've
[1:39:30] got plenty of faith
[1:39:31] you don't need more faith amen we need
[1:39:33] the faith we already have to come out
[1:39:35] from under the shadow of fear
[1:39:37] out from under the bondage of fear we
[1:39:39] need to cast away fear so that faith can
[1:39:41] take its place
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:47] brother baby goes on to say the greatest
[1:39:50] thing that i find against the church
[1:39:51] tonight is fear
[1:39:53] everybody's scared to death about
[1:39:55] something what are you scared about
[1:39:58] if a man's born again he should be happy
[1:40:01] carefree
[1:40:02] just like these fellows singing up here
[1:40:04] and the brother testifying back there
[1:40:05] just free
[1:40:06] there ain't nothing can harm you nothing
[1:40:08] present nothing future
[1:40:10] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:40:12] god that's in christ
[1:40:13] god has promised
[1:40:17] you realize there's nothing to be afraid
[1:40:20] of
[1:40:22] nothing let's turn to matthew 6.
[1:40:26] we'll close with this scripture the
[1:40:28] musicians would like to make their way
[1:40:30] up
[1:40:30] brother tommy and do so at this time
[1:40:33] let's read matthew 6 together
[1:40:45] matthew 6 and 25.
[1:40:51] wherefore i say unto you take no thought
[1:40:53] for your life
[1:40:55] what you shall eat or what you shall
[1:40:56] drink
[1:40:58] oh what a challenge friends
[1:41:02] but guess what very likely
[1:41:05] in the near future we're going to see
[1:41:08] this come to pass
[1:41:11] how when where i don't know
[1:41:14] i can't predict but it's likely
[1:41:17] that you and i will see the time where
[1:41:20] we live this scripture
[1:41:24] therefore i say unto you take no thought
[1:41:27] for your life
[1:41:29] what you shall eat or what you shall
[1:41:32] drink nor yet for your body what you
[1:41:34] shall put on
[1:41:34] is not the life more than meat in the
[1:41:36] body than raiment
[1:41:38] behold the fowls of the air for they so
[1:41:40] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:41:42] barns
[1:41:43] yet your heavenly father feedeth them
[1:41:45] are you not much better than they
[1:41:48] which of you by taking thought can add
[1:41:50] one cubit into your stature
[1:41:52] and why take ye thought for raymond
[1:41:54] consider the lilies of the field how
[1:41:55] they grow
[1:41:56] they toil not neither do they spin and
[1:41:58] yet i say unto you that even solomon in
[1:42:00] all of his glory was not arrayed like
[1:42:02] one of these
[1:42:03] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[1:42:05] the field which today is
[1:42:07] and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall
[1:42:09] he not much more clothe you
[1:42:10] o ye of little faith therefore take no
[1:42:14] thought saying what shall we eat or what
[1:42:15] shall we drink or
[1:42:17] what with all shall we be clothed for
[1:42:19] after all these things do the gentiles
[1:42:21] see
[1:42:22] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:42:23] you have need of all these things
[1:42:25] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[1:42:27] his righteousness and all these things
[1:42:29] shall be added unto you
[1:42:32] take therefore no thought for tomorrow
[1:42:34] for the moral shall take thought for the
[1:42:36] things of itself
[1:42:37] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:42:40] thereof let's all stand
[1:42:45] i say god let me live that kind of faith
[1:42:50] i want this is the hour i've been called
[1:42:53] to
[1:42:55] do you believe that you've been called
[1:42:57] to be on earth at this time
[1:42:59] to display god and manifest his word and
[1:43:02] god
[1:43:02] loves to prove his word he enjoys it
[1:43:06] like when we get down into the squeeze
[1:43:08] and it tightens up and and
[1:43:10] god's getting excited because he's just
[1:43:11] getting ready to do something you know
[1:43:14] they got down to the red sea and the
[1:43:16] pillar fire led them down there and they
[1:43:18] all got gathered around
[1:43:19] and and and god he loves to prove his
[1:43:21] word
[1:43:22] and and he loves to prove himself mighty
[1:43:24] on our behalf and he gets them down
[1:43:26] there and they start getting nervous and
[1:43:27] he gets more excited
[1:43:29] and they get a little more nervous and
[1:43:30] he gets more excited he's got to prove
[1:43:32] himself
[1:43:34] don't wring your hands at this condition
[1:43:36] god's getting excited
[1:43:37] he wants to prove himself he wants to
[1:43:39] prove himself mighty on our behalf he
[1:43:41] wants to prove the word to the world
[1:43:43] amen he wants to prove who where the
[1:43:45] word is and where it's not
[1:43:49] remember when david started talking it
[1:43:51] was different than the language
[1:43:52] everybody else in the camp was using
[1:43:54] and when he started using that kind of
[1:43:56] language it took notice amen
[1:43:57] and when he went out there and did what
[1:43:59] he said he could do it gave them all
[1:44:01] strength to go out and kill the
[1:44:04] philistines
[1:44:06] don't be scared this is exciting times
[1:44:11] don't be afraid we have lived our whole
[1:44:15] lives for the hour that we're moving
[1:44:16] into
[1:44:18] every message book we've read every
[1:44:20] prayer we've prayed every time we've
[1:44:22] been to church has been preparation for
[1:44:23] the hours that we're moving into

[1:44:35] satan's eden there's going to be a
[1:44:38] showdown there's going to be a final
[1:44:39] battle on this earth
[1:44:40] between the gentile bride and the
[1:44:42] kingdom of darkness and god
[1:44:44] is going to brew satan under your feet
[1:44:48] shortly don't give up now it's just
[1:44:50] getting good
[1:44:52] don't lose heart now it's just getting
[1:44:54] good do you realize
[1:44:56] prophets and sages and men of old and
[1:44:58] patriarchs they would have sold
[1:45:00] everything they had to stand
[1:45:02] in your place now and fight this battle
