[6:38] emuel to take the service after I spoke
[6:41] to him in the forye but uh brother
[6:43] Manuel had told me several weeks ago
[6:45] that he had the potential there was a
[6:47] opportunity that he would um be taking
[6:50] that he would need to leave and relocate
[6:53] to Washington DC for a short period of
[6:55] time to work on a short-term project and
[6:58] so he he's accepted that offer and that
[7:00] challenge and he'll be leaving here soon
[7:03] for 6 months to a year it's a short-term
[7:05] thing and I'll let him explain more
[7:07] about it but uh I just found out Sunday
[7:10] that it's actually coming quicker than I
[7:11] thought and that he would begin the
[7:13] moving process this week so I wanted him
[7:16] to I wanted him to come and talk to
[7:18] everybody and Minister before he went
[7:22] amen I'm glad he told me it was
[7:24] temporary in short term amen if he had
[7:27] told me it wasn't I would be in tears

[16:25] everybody you may be seated for a little
[16:27] while brothers and and sisters thank you
[16:30] God bless
[16:34] you it is a cold
[16:39] outside and if anyone loves snow when
[16:43] the snow is uh is coming down know that
[16:47] brother you may not where he is he is
[16:49] not happy snow buries
[16:54] me I like 85 86°
[17:00] so God bless you and
[17:04] uh I know brother Chad has uh just
[17:06] announced
[17:08] it uh this is something I was actually I
[17:12] was foreseeing it uh by May June of this
[17:15] year so uh just to put it U um on simple
[17:21] terms I know a couple of years been a
[17:23] couple two years now that I've been uh
[17:26] um laid off and I didn't feel any
[17:30] pressure to go back to work for a couple
[17:32] of years and the Lord has provided for
[17:35] for me and the family and uh so I had
[17:38] some offers even within the LI area
[17:41] within the Columbus area I didn't feel
[17:43] led to take anything because uh I just
[17:47] wanted to be available for mostly
[17:50] Mission field and I'm still
[17:53] available and so I I just put it in
[17:57] God's hand and said I just don't want to
[17:59] take something because I want to take it
[18:01] I know it can provide for my family or
[18:03] whatever but it seems like the level of
[18:06] uh um the way we we see things and the
[18:10] desire as I usually tell some brothers I
[18:13] said something has happened in in my
[18:16] life I don't have any
[18:19] need only need I have is of
[18:22] him any natural
[18:24] need I can boil the eggs and and be fine
[18:29] I'd be fine so the only need I has have
[18:33] is God I just want you more of you
[18:36] within me amen so it's it's something
[18:39] it's something that is craving me it
[18:41] makes you odd sometimes even to your own
[18:44] family it makes you odd but that's the
[18:47] reality that uh we come and say God
[18:50] wherever you want to place me I would be
[18:54] fine I would be fine and you will find
[18:57] that we're going to be reading a couple
[18:58] words here brother R says that love is
[19:03] the ultimate God's love to to us so um
[19:09] um my brother Works in in the government
[19:12] within the president of the Dr cono um
[19:15] in Africa so he's he's talked to me
[19:19] about probably about a year seeing any
[19:21] consideration in probably uh doing some
[19:24] diplomatic project uh with them um
[19:28] within the DC area uh we've talked more
[19:31] than a year ago but we thought probably
[19:34] by May June things could be start
[19:37] finalizing but he surprised me um
[19:40] probably a couple of weeks ago that he
[19:42] want things to to be done so there's
[19:45] certain things to be done there just a
[19:47] little projects as brother Chad said an
[19:49] assignment that uh will require me to be
[19:52] away uh to be close to the DC area with
[19:55] the family
[19:57] uh the time frame is probably 6 to a
[20:00] year to see uh what would uh would
[20:03] happen then but uh just uh request your
[20:06] prayers it's not easy it's never been
[20:09] easy even to leave just to know that
[20:11] Wednesday and Sundays I won't be here on
[20:15] that uh corter there it's
[20:19] uh it's it's it's very difficult for the
[20:23] love that uh you have for usen and we
[20:27] have for youen and uh this is home home
[20:30] to to us home to me and it's it's it's
[20:34] not been easy even right now it's it's
[20:36] still kind of uh something that's it's
[20:40] it's not easy just pray for me even
[20:42] going so I don't see anything that uh
[20:45] it's just that things have turned out
[20:48] the way they are to be now so planning
[20:51] to move out to drive the first U-Haul
[20:54] truck by
[20:55] Friday and I only my my left arm is is
[20:58] no longer working good so I thought
[21:01] Brothers could live nearby Columbus can
[21:04] help me maybe load a couple of items in
[21:07] the truck but I know it's far away from
[21:09] you guys about an hour and 30 minutes CU
[21:12] I want probably Micah and my wife there
[21:15] and my daughters to to help me carry
[21:18] some beds in to the truck so I can take
[21:20] off Friday morning because I had to open
[21:23] the office by Monday uh it's a new
[21:26] office and just to be able to sit on
[21:28] things there to start working
[21:30] on many many many assets there and just
[21:34] keep us in your prayers and then once I
[21:36] move out I take the first truck uh this
[21:39] Friday morning uh and then we'll come
[21:43] back again my family will be here for
[21:44] the weekend service I'll be in the DC
[21:47] because I need to open the office on
[21:48] Monday so they'll be able to attend the
[21:51] service on Sunday here and then the
[21:52] following week at
[21:55] um weekend also so we'll be Tak taking
[21:58] out the the second truck so but we'll be
[22:02] here so we'll be tuning in uh every
[22:05] we're streaming in every time and if I
[22:07] have a couple of three days or two days
[22:10] I'll be this way yeah it is it's our
[22:12] house thank you God bless you and you
[22:15] may stand up with milk can read
[22:18] the scriptures I know Sister Mary and
[22:22] sister W on the road as our pastor has
[22:25] prayed we're praying for them and also
[22:28] remember remember the brothers and
[22:29] sisters in the GMA area this is in the
[22:31] Congo the east of the
[22:34] Congo uh there there's a kind of war
[22:37] going on in the area the area we know
[22:40] very well we've been there with brother
[22:43] um brother um
[22:46] SAS um and um with uh brother Burley
[22:51] also and myself so just pray for the
[22:53] Believers so they are stuck there they
[22:55] don't have electricities for a couple of
[22:57] days in town
[22:58] and just remember
[23:00] them all right okay we're going to be
[23:03] turning uh
[23:05] searching and read the word of God and I
[23:08] know that uh our pastor could not uh
[23:11] announce it before days so you could be
[23:14] praying for me I know everybody prayed
[23:16] for him so now could you please change
[23:21] your prayers while we're reading the
[23:23] scriptures turn them towards me that God
[23:26] will help me help me stand and speak I I
[23:30] had some scriptures the the the good
[23:32] thing the confidence is my pastor was
[23:35] even encouraging me is what you love is
[23:37] what I love we all love the word of God
[23:40] as I'm going to be even reading some
[23:42] scriptures or the
[23:45] quotations probably pay less attention
[23:48] to me pay more attention to the holy
[23:50] spirit inside of you who's going to be
[23:53] telling more than I can tell so he's
[23:56] he's going to be revealing it to you as
[23:57] I'm we read it he's going to be probably
[24:00] five times giving you what I can even
[24:02] add in one word so just p and amen God
[24:08] bless you let's read go to the scripture
[24:12] in the Book of
[24:15] John uh St John chapter 11 and this is a
[24:20] familiar scripture about uh
[24:25] Lazarus and uh his two sisters
[24:38] uh John chapter 11 we're going to be
[24:41] start reading the the first five verses
[24:44] then we'll be sitting
[24:46] down now a certain man was sick named
[24:50] Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and
[24:54] her sister Martha it was that Mary which
[24:58] anointed the Lord with ointment and
[25:00] wiped his feet with her hair whose
[25:04] brother Lazarus was
[25:06] sick therefore his
[25:08] sisters sent unto him saying Lord behold
[25:14] he whom thou lovest is
[25:17] sick when Jesus heard that he said this
[25:21] this sickness is not unto death but the
[25:24] glory but for the glory of God that the
[25:27] son of God God might be glorified
[25:31] thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her
[25:35] sister and Lazarus let's have a word of
[25:38] prayer
[25:39] you precious Lord we are again so
[25:45] blessed to be finding ourselves in this
[25:48] very moment at this very hour in front
[25:51] of your precious word we could have been
[25:54] uh at different places at this time we
[25:58] could have been probably laying in the
[26:01] hospitals maybe having to be checked
[26:04] every every five minutes for oxygen
[26:07] level or we could be in an emergency
[26:10] room or we could be stuck or father but
[26:14] your grace and your love has proceeded
[26:16] us and they provided a way that we can
[26:20] be finding
[26:21] ourselves in the best place ever where
[26:25] two or three can gather and father we de
[26:29] so blessed and fortunate to to be so to
[26:32] be that kind of people that you allowed
[26:34] out to and father now as we have read
[26:37] these uh few blessed words of
[26:42] yours Lord you you know there's nothing
[26:45] in man that could even come closer to
[26:47] interpret you are your only interpreter
[26:50] would you come and bless us in the
[26:51] reading of a few scriptures we have we
[26:54] have already prepared here and the
[26:57] quotation
[26:58] and father you're the one who would
[27:00] interpret to each and every one of us we
[27:03] just commit and submit Lord this service
[27:05] unto you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[27:08] amen you may be
[27:11] seated so I took the um title of our
[27:16] little uh Bible study tonight is uh when
[27:22] Jesus said this
[27:25] sickness is not un to death but for the
[27:29] glory of God so the title is this
[27:32] sickness is but for the glory of God and
[27:36] this as I'm reading this uh scripture
[27:40] here reading it it seems like that uh
[27:44] not seems but Lazarus was
[27:48] sick and now he had two sisters as we
[27:51] know Mary and Martha they must have seen
[27:54] not noticed that uh the health of their
[27:57] brother was just
[27:59] deteriorating
[28:01] deteriorating and then they uh they
[28:05] decided to do something they said we we
[28:08] we have a solution here we used to have
[28:11] uh his friend here Jesus used to stay
[28:13] with us who treated him and we know that
[28:16] that man is a prophet we've seen things
[28:18] he said and how he had acted so they had
[28:22] well good intention and of who Jesus was
[28:26] they knew that he was a prophet
[28:29] and they treated him very well and they
[28:31] thought in this scenario Jesus is the
[28:34] one who could could uh bring help who
[28:37] can help their brother he can say a word
[28:39] he can say something and Lazarus would
[28:42] be would be would be healed and we as
[28:45] the Bible mention it we don't have any
[28:47] record of their parents so they must
[28:50] have been living about themselves
[28:53] parents might have been dead and there's
[28:55] no record that Mary and Martha was
[28:57] married Mary and Martha were married so
[29:00] they might have been maybe did not uh um
[29:04] get married and they only have their
[29:06] brother there who was representing a man
[29:09] in their house representing too much for
[29:12] them to lose him and then to stay just
[29:16] two single
[29:18] sisters so it was something going on
[29:22] there and as I'm reading going back to
[29:25] the chapter 10 you find that the things
[29:27] started in the winter it could have been
[29:29] winter there that's what I don't like
[29:33] winter but you those who like it I'm
[29:36] fine with you so you remember that in
[29:39] the chapter 10 before the chapter 11
[29:43] Jesus was in Jerusalem and he went to
[29:45] the the temple for the dedication it was
[29:47] in the
[29:48] winter as he was disputing with the with
[29:51] the the the priest and the Sadducees
[29:54] Pharisees he they kicked him out now he
[29:57] had had to run away and to hide himself
[30:00] in bethabara which is where John the
[30:03] Baptist used to baptize it's east of
[30:07] Jordan so he went there to hide for a
[30:10] little while but as he went there he
[30:13] cannot hide people were still following
[30:15] him I'm pretty sure it was still in the
[30:18] winter time that this sickness
[30:22] struck Lazarus and as these things are
[30:25] happening it's happening in the winter
[30:29] and these two ladies had no one else to
[30:33] go to Lazarus were like their parent
[30:36] like a father to them like a brother
[30:38] more than a brother to
[30:40] them and at this moment they they are
[30:42] sending you notice that in the chap in
[30:45] the first in the third verse of the
[30:48] chapter
[30:50] 11 they didn't go
[30:53] out they are sending
[30:56] somebody Maybe
[30:58] Mary and Martha tried to find a cousin
[31:01] of theirs maybe a
[31:05] neighbor somebody who could relate to
[31:08] Jesus
[31:10] what was going on in their their little
[31:13] home now they are sending
[31:17] somebody and from their
[31:19] place from Bethany to bethar that's a
[31:23] day
[31:24] walk in the winter don't know how many
[31:28] hours it took for the career to walk
[31:31] there living from the west side and
[31:35] headed up there to
[31:37] bethar to find Jesus and after the
[31:41] person the one who was sent got there
[31:46] he's now telling Jesus what Mary and
[31:49] Martha had uh asked and requested him to
[31:54] say the person is telling Jesus
[31:58] about the sickness and Jesus is just
[32:02] giving the word in verse
[32:06] four when Jesus heard it because it was
[32:09] added to him he heard that he said this
[32:13] sickness is not unto death but for the
[32:16] glory of God that the Son of God might
[32:19] be glorified
[32:21] thereby now between the verse four and
[32:24] the verse five
[32:29] could you just imagine what happened
[32:33] there how that man who might have heard
[32:37] a good testimony about Jesus being a
[32:41] gentle man being a good Prophet being
[32:44] the the god the man that was so full of
[32:47] compassion if he hears he would come
[32:48] right away to to come and heal the sick
[32:51] and he's been in many places has been
[32:53] invited he always
[32:56] goes what was going in his mind have no
[33:00] idea even by the time he's leaving where
[33:03] Jesus was another day walk back to
[33:08] Bethany what was going on people that he
[33:10] was encountering asking about Lazarus
[33:13] what what are you doing on this side I
[33:15] came I was sent Lazarus very sick and
[33:18] then I went to find his friend Jesus the
[33:21] the Nazareth good Mighty Prophet look
[33:24] what he told me he didn't even he didn't
[33:27] even come he just said that word he
[33:29] looked maybe he was talking to other
[33:31] people what was going on in Martha's
[33:34] mind what was going on in Mary's mind so
[33:37] between the the verse four and verse
[33:41] five there are too many things going on
[33:44] there too many
[33:47] murmurings too many things being
[33:50] spoken because we're humans we can
[33:53] reason out things why didn't he come you
[33:57] just come here here to see our pastor
[33:59] and said brother Chad would you would
[34:01] you pray for my daughter something is
[34:04] going on she's just maybe in the
[34:06] accident in the hospital oh she she'll
[34:08] be fine he doesn't even come with you he
[34:11] didn't come to pray so many things
[34:13] happening
[34:15] there but you know the greatest thing
[34:18] John the writer knew that any of those
[34:21] things could not be in
[34:24] the uh being a part of uh the chapter
[34:27] the the the verse five right he's
[34:31] putting it there yeah now Jesus loves
[34:36] Martha and her sister and Lazarus period
[34:39] praise amen meaning that it is the love
[34:44] it that is the greatest don't even talk
[34:47] about you don't even know what this
[34:48] what's
[34:49] happening and the prophet of God said
[34:52] this in uh the remembering the Lord
[34:54] preaching
[34:56] 1962 he said love is the ultimate of
[35:04] Grace so while they were murmuring Marth
[35:08] and Mary they were human being like us
[35:11] the Korea murmuring speaking why didn't
[35:14] questioning
[35:15] themselves something greater than what
[35:18] they were murmuring went forth before
[35:21] them the love of God preceded
[35:26] them love is is the ultimate Grace love
[35:30] is God's ultimate for us after all other
[35:36] gifts and things has
[35:39] vanished our prophecy our tongues our
[35:44] interpretations all that we've ever done
[35:47] or what more When Love Comes it's the
[35:53] ultimate it's above all cause all other
[35:57] will
[35:59] fail it's the Supreme Court
[36:04] decision praise
[36:06] God when they were
[36:08] murmuring questioning themselves had no
[36:12] idea a supreme decision has been made
[36:15] for us and I like the way the the writer
[36:19] writing it he said he doesn't he didn't
[36:21] say that Jesus loved them love is not a
[36:25] bulk love it's a person personal
[36:28] individual Jesus loved Martha her sister
[36:32] Mary and Lazarus right now in this area
[36:36] God doesn't love
[36:38] BCF God loves you loves her loves him
[36:43] loves the me and because we are part of
[36:46] BCF then BCF is loved but it's you
[36:52] individually and it's and then the
[36:54] prophet of God says again something I
[36:56] just want to to bring you up in the the
[36:58] message beyond the curtain of time I we
[37:01] don't have time to go that it's
[37:02] Wednesday the prophet is giving how when
[37:05] he went beond the curon of time and the
[37:08] ladies and the people he saw there he's
[37:10] coming up with summarizing something I'm
[37:13] just it's just two sentence of summary
[37:16] he said see we must approach God through
[37:20] that channel of love and
[37:23] faith faith take takes us to the the
[37:29] channel Faith takes us to the channel
[37:32] that's right but love is the one that
[37:35] takes us
[37:37] in amen because faith will end one day
[37:43] but love will take us
[37:46] in and as I was looking at this said
[37:49] this is strange that is Jesus spoke he
[37:54] didn't even go but the writer is com
[37:57] coming up with something that is just so
[38:00] tremendous in Simplicity we don't even
[38:02] see it that's right Jesus loved Martha
[38:05] that's right her sister Mary amen and
[38:08] their brother Lazarus amen individual
[38:12] love the prophet of God says in the do
[38:14] you believe in preaching 1955 he said
[38:18] now there are two different kinds of
[38:20] love he he wants to tell us about the
[38:22] filo love and the agapo
[38:25] love there's human love which is a Greek
[38:29] word is filio love and the agapo love is
[38:33] the high love of divine love now you
[38:36] take the little you take like the filio
[38:39] love when we have that love a mother for
[38:42] her baby will drive her right straight
[38:45] to a flaming fire to save that baby's
[38:48] life it will make a man for his
[38:51] sweetheart lay down his life anytime
[38:55] that's ail Your Love see see what I mean
[38:58] that's just human love and I believe
[39:01] somewhere in the Bible it said could a
[39:04] mother forget her little suckling
[39:06] babe said you may but I can never forget
[39:11] you for you are engraved on the palm of
[39:15] my
[39:16] hand don't leave it on the on the screen
[39:19] here that's you and to me you and I we
[39:25] are engraved on the the palm of his
[39:29] hand cuz you will realize that Lazarus
[39:33] was there sick and Jesus said this
[39:36] sickness is but for the glory of God you
[39:39] might be having something right now that
[39:42] you are going through yes a situation
[39:45] that has been probably for you unsolved
[39:48] for years right maybe 20 years maybe 15
[39:53] years but listen Jesus is telling you
[39:56] that why whatever you going
[39:58] through it's for the glory of God and
[40:03] we'll we'll see it later on it's for the
[40:06] glory of God whatever you are going
[40:09] through right now that that is taking
[40:12] your sleep away at
[40:15] night or you questioning how is he going
[40:19] to turn around or how with the solution
[40:22] where would it be coming from right just
[40:25] you know it yourself I know
[40:27] myself just know that that that very
[40:31] thing
[40:32] there Jesus says it's for the glory of
[40:35] God amen amen and following that he
[40:40] loves
[40:43] you he has given his Supreme decision on
[40:47] your behalf
[40:49] am he
[40:52] said how could God ever forsake us or
[40:58] anything as long as he loves us like
[41:01] that prise God see filo means
[41:05] Fellowship it's the love that you have
[41:08] for your wife and for your
[41:10] husband that would make you kill a man
[41:13] for your wife you'd love uh you'd love
[41:16] her so if he insulted your wife you
[41:19] would take a gun and kill him that's F
[41:21] your love but a agapo love is so much
[41:26] different it would make you pray for his
[41:30] sinful
[41:31] Soul that's the difference see the goap
[41:35] of Love indicates that Jesus loved them
[41:40] more than they ever knew
[41:44] yeah Jesus loved Martha more than Martha
[41:49] ever knew that's right amen Jesus loved
[41:52] Mary more than Mary ever knew Jesus
[41:56] loved la
[41:58] more than Lazarus ever
[42:02] knew don't stop it there amen that's the
[42:05] same thing with
[42:07] you he loves you more than you ever knew
[42:13] about he's the same God he cannot do it
[42:16] to Lazarus and then then not doing it
[42:18] for
[42:21] you and remember mtha might have treated
[42:24] him very well when the Jesus was staying
[42:26] with them
[42:27] them cooking for
[42:30] him washing his
[42:33] clothes providing doing the bed so he
[42:36] can be comfortable at their
[42:38] home little did she know that that man
[42:42] was more than a prophet yeah she only
[42:44] knew that he was a prophet they were ex
[42:48] Pharisees the prophet of God said they
[42:50] were ex-
[42:51] feres even believing in the resurrection
[42:54] you will see that you had no issue
[42:56] believing in that she used to be a
[42:58] Pharisee they used to be
[43:01] Pharisees but she had no
[43:05] idea who was living with them they had
[43:09] no
[43:12] idea and they could not know what kind
[43:14] of love that standing on two feet there
[43:19] loved them
[43:21] with more than they ever knew
[43:26] about and even if they knew that he was
[43:29] God let's put that they might have known
[43:32] that he was
[43:37] God what good would it have done to them
[43:42] if they did not have any need that's
[43:45] right we can know that he's God yeah but
[43:49] if you don't have any need how are we
[43:52] how are you going to bring him on the
[43:55] scene that's right
[43:57] amen the prophet of God gives a little
[43:59] story of uh and you know that and I
[44:03] might might be chopping it off up the
[44:06] little girl in uh in Canada and uh the
[44:10] King George was to visit Canada with the
[44:13] queen and then the school arranged to
[44:17] let out the the the kids out they can go
[44:20] see the king and the queen before they
[44:23] they went there the teachers the
[44:28] gave them
[44:30] Flags little flags that when you go out
[44:33] just to show your uh loyalty to our King
[44:36] you can go see the king and and when you
[44:39] see the king wave your flag and then you
[44:42] come you you we'll come uh gather you
[44:45] and we can come back to school as they
[44:47] weren't there you you know it very well
[44:50] there was a little girl
[44:52] there the king passed and she waved her
[44:55] flag everybody waves their flags and
[44:57] they were happy and with joy but she
[45:00] stayed there she couldn't go in the
[45:03] classroom different from other girls
[45:06] other kids everybody went there
[45:09] everybody saw the king she did see the
[45:12] king
[45:13] too everybody waves waved their flag she
[45:18] did wave her flag too but she had
[45:21] something that no one else
[45:24] had she had a need
[45:28] there was something there she wanted to
[45:31] be related to the king she want the king
[45:33] to pay attention to her there was a
[45:36] craving within her that yes I did wave
[45:39] my I did see the king I did Wave My Flag
[45:43] but the king didn't see me I'm too
[45:45] little and you know how the prophet of
[45:47] God says we have our
[45:49] King you cannot be too little for him to
[45:52] pass you don't think you are too
[45:55] little don't think your Fai your little
[45:58] your faith my little faith is too
[46:00] little there's a king that sees
[46:04] that and then the teacher when they went
[46:07] to school they couldn't find her started
[46:09] looking for her outside and they came
[46:13] found her on the telegraph poll how many
[46:16] less than 20 years knows what telegraph
[46:18] mean means
[46:22] here
[46:25] Telegraph so so she the
[46:29] teacher came and found her around the
[46:32] telegraph pole
[46:36] weeping she approached to
[46:38] her start asking her she was still
[46:41] holding her
[46:43] flat did you see the
[46:45] king yes I did like everybody else did
[46:50] you wave your
[46:51] flag yes I
[46:54] did but what's the matter
[46:57] I was too little the king didn't see me
[47:00] and listen what the prophet says in this
[47:02] he said in hearing him in
[47:05] 1962 now many times God meets in the
[47:09] Realms of great
[47:12] congregations he meets with small
[47:16] congregations one time he met with
[47:20] 500 again he met with
[47:22] 70 he met with 12 he met even with
[47:29] one no matter how small the congregation
[47:33] is God always will meet when you have a
[47:40] [Music]
[47:42] need know
[47:45] sometimes just to myself when I come I
[47:48] said God don't let me to be in a in a in
[47:51] in a state of I don't need
[47:54] you that's the worst thing to be in
[47:58] everything is paid off this is paid off
[48:00] this is paid off I'm fine have no need
[48:03] I'm my my bill of health is perfect
[48:08] brother that's a slow dying that's
[48:13] right the prophet of God God always will
[48:16] meet when you have a need and believe
[48:20] that he will be there because most time
[48:24] he calls us through a need need that's
[48:27] right and the prophet of God says that
[48:30] he usually calls the people when he's
[48:33] got something great to tell them a need
[48:38] is an open door because God has
[48:42] something great to tell
[48:47] you he's got something
[48:51] real and I like how the prophet of God
[48:54] starts a prayer a servy
[48:57] in
[48:58] 1962 before he could start the service
[49:02] he's telling the congregation to to Bow
[49:05] their heads and listen to this prayer
[49:08] before he can start the
[49:10] service 1962 we would see Jesus he said
[49:14] now with our heads bowed and our hearts
[49:20] likewise I wonder if in the building
[49:24] tonight before we start
[49:27] if there would be those here that would
[49:29] like to just raise up their hand to God
[49:33] and say God now during this
[49:38] meeting I have a need
[49:43] amen I have a
[49:46] need would you supply my need
[49:50] Lord I'm going to raise up my hand in
[49:54] just by this God bless you every were
[49:58] and that service if you listen to it
[50:02] there was he he set it up that way the
[50:05] people were so needy that that service
[50:09] was one of the greatest in just the
[50:14] the uh healing and and and and
[50:17] Discerning the thoughts because
[50:19] everybody came anticipating had a need
[50:23] every time I walked there I said Lord I
[50:26] am needy I'm walking those doors because
[50:31] I am in
[50:32] need and I know that you can do more
[50:35] than what what I can even ask for
[50:38] amen so God usually calls us by creating
[50:41] a
[50:45] need remember one time the prophet God
[50:49] of of God said that so God is in the
[50:53] counil of man in 1957 hearing him
[50:57] no matter where it is or how many if you
[51:01] have a
[51:03] need he will come
[51:06] prise if you have a need it's a blessing
[51:10] praise God more blessing that we will
[51:13] even even realize
[51:15] it God is dealing with the needy people
[51:19] you will see that if time allowed us
[51:23] allows us you will see that if you go in
[51:25] the Book of Revelation
[51:28] chapter chapter 3 verse 15-1 17 we can I
[51:32] can read it you don't have to turn on
[51:34] the thing that is mostly hurting this is
[51:38] Jesus himself saying it he said I Know
[51:41] Thy works that thou are neither cold nor
[51:44] H I would thou were cold or heart so
[51:49] then because thou are look warm and
[51:51] neither cold nor hot I will spew you I
[51:54] spew thee out of my mouth
[51:57] because thou sayth I am rich and
[52:01] increase with good and I have need of
[52:05] nothing this
[52:07] is this is the
[52:11] darkest generation we're going in we've
[52:13] been taken out but the most thing that
[52:16] is God is summarizing Jesus summarizing
[52:18] that the worst of the worst of any
[52:21] age which is leod deia it's because they
[52:25] have need of nothing
[52:27] yes that's true amen need of nothing
[52:31] doors are closed yeah they don't need
[52:36] him Cain didn't need God to move on his
[52:41] with his life he had no need of God said
[52:44] you stay behind I can go I can marry
[52:45] myself I can work he he he he knew
[52:47] everything he could do right but we see
[52:52] that God
[52:56] the prophet of God is mentioning again
[52:58] about the the maniac of
[53:00] GAD he said he
[53:03] crossed the sea
[53:06] overnight to go to the maniac of GAD
[53:10] because that Maniac was in need right
[53:14] the the priests in his town had no need
[53:16] of him because they kicked him out they
[53:18] loved their Hogs more than their they
[53:20] pigs more than they they lack the the
[53:22] presence of the of the of God the
[53:25] almighty God and the prophet of God says
[53:27] again in the healing of J gyus he said
[53:30] now we see him crossing the waters had
[53:33] just left another side where a great
[53:36] Revival could have taken place over in
[53:38] gther but instead of the Revival taking
[53:41] place the people didn't want no Revival
[53:45] see if you don't want
[53:48] Christ he won't push himself on you he
[53:53] certainly won't you have to want him
[53:58] first blessed are they that hunger and
[54:00] do thirst after righteousness for they
[54:03] shall be
[54:04] filled that's it when you hunger even a
[54:08] blessing to hunger and a thirst for
[54:13] righteousness in the same message he
[54:15] said you have to want
[54:18] him you have to have a
[54:23] need so we see that a need
[54:27] is an
[54:29] opportunity when Mary and Martha coming
[54:32] back to the reading of the
[54:34] scripture they had a need of their
[54:37] Lazarus of their brother Lazarus to be
[54:40] healed but that need was not he it did
[54:43] not come to its
[54:45] climax what did they do they send
[54:49] somebody a go
[54:52] between sometimes we send a go between
[54:55] Christ and our
[54:57] eles we want the pastor to pray for us
[55:01] we want the husband to pray we want the
[55:03] wife to pray parents to
[55:07] pray God doesn't like go between cuz
[55:10] Christ is always the go between God and
[55:12] us so we don't want any go between
[55:14] between Christ and us we go directly to
[55:17] him and Jesus knew that as they send
[55:20] that person Jesus knew that the need has
[55:22] not has not come to the crescendo yet
[55:28] had to
[55:30] wait because they still had some hopes
[55:33] maybe he can get he can be healed
[55:36] everything will be all right we'll see
[55:38] but let's let's try but when every Hope
[55:43] Was Gone amen right Lazarus was
[55:51] dead now the scene
[55:54] changed you will come and if we open up
[55:57] to go to uh John we can go start at uh
[56:02] 17 John 11 verse
[56:17] 17 a long way to to come to
[56:22] this then when Jesus came he found that
[56:25] he had had
[56:27] Lain in the grave for 4 days
[56:32] already now Jesus stayed if we remember
[56:35] in verse 7 he 6 or S he stayed in in
[56:39] that place for 2 days after he announced
[56:42] him that Lazarus is sick said hey that
[56:45] sickness is for the glory of God he
[56:48] remained in on that in that place in
[56:51] bethar two days and he knew that Lazarus
[56:55] was going to be
[56:56] dying now after 2 days he knew that
[57:00] Lazarus was dead now Jesus is
[57:05] coming he is coming from
[57:08] bethabara your East Jordan is here I
[57:12] know brother Chad is he draws very good
[57:14] he has beautiful handwriting we don't
[57:16] even have compliment him for
[57:18] that
[57:20] so Jordan was here bethar is this place
[57:25] J Jerusalem is up
[57:28] there and Bethany is down
[57:31] here it was closer for Jesus to come
[57:34] from Beth to Bethany to where Lazarus
[57:37] was Jesus didn't do that he's coming
[57:41] this way he's coming up to
[57:43] Jerusalem Beth Beth Bethany is uh 154
[57:48] Longs which is about a mile 1.8 miles
[57:52] Jesus coming to
[57:54] Jerusalem cuz he wanted to give them an
[57:57] opportunity to go meet him themselves
[58:02] amen he came because he knew that it was
[58:05] in
[58:06] winter this lady poor lady because he
[58:09] knew that something is now stirring in
[58:11] MAA in Mary he knew that so he's coming
[58:15] to
[58:16] Jerusalem and when MTH is hearing
[58:20] 18 now Bethany was n unto Jerusalem
[58:24] about 15 furong
[58:26] off and many of the Jews came to Martha
[58:30] and Mary to comfort them concerning
[58:32] their
[58:33] brother then Martha as soon as she heard
[58:37] that Jesus was
[58:39] coming she didn't send
[58:41] anybody amen the need was so great
[58:46] am that she had to go by herself and
[58:50] remember the prophet of God says that
[58:52] she was a
[58:53] dilatory dilatory meaning that she was
[58:56] was always
[58:58] late just late Mary Mary believed
[59:02] quicker she was always in the back
[59:05] working not considering things right
[59:08] away just kind of putting off putting
[59:10] off but this time the Lord is working on
[59:13] this one he knew he loved her he knew
[59:16] that within her there was a seed for
[59:19] eternal life amen but you know what the
[59:22] love of God Is the Love unto salvation
[59:26] Martha had to be saved amen right she
[59:30] had to be saved and you cannot be saved
[59:33] by doing good work amen right she was
[59:36] cooking for Jesus she was doing washing
[59:39] her his clothes she could not be saved
[59:41] by doing that salvation is by faith
[59:45] something had to be brooding somewhere
[59:49] that Martha could come and express her
[59:51] faith her belief into that amen Jesus is
[59:55] giving her her an
[59:58] opportunity then Martha 20 then Martha
[1:00:02] as soon as she heard that Jesus was
[1:00:04] coming went and met him but Mary sat
[1:00:07] still in the house then said Martha unto
[1:00:11] Jesus Lord if thou had been here my
[1:00:14] brother had not died I I I have too many
[1:00:16] notes probably 10 more pages if I go
[1:00:20] there kids will be late in school let's
[1:00:21] go to the
[1:00:24] Bible then said unto Jesus 21 Lord if
[1:00:28] thou had been here my brother had not
[1:00:30] died she's saying it because she knew
[1:00:34] somewhere that this man was a Prophet
[1:00:37] this man was different from other
[1:00:40] men right literally she did not know
[1:00:44] that this man was God
[1:00:47] yeah she had no no
[1:00:50] idea but I 22 but I know that even now
[1:00:54] whatsoever you will ask God God will
[1:00:57] give it thee but she was talking to God
[1:01:03] himself 23 Jesus said unto her now Jesus
[1:01:07] is not even showing himself that hey I'm
[1:01:10] I'm
[1:01:11] God Jesus is going in a way of only God
[1:01:15] could do that Jesus said unto her thy
[1:01:18] brother shall rise again now Mara as I
[1:01:22] told you they were Pharisees she had no
[1:01:25] no doubt believing that there was a
[1:01:26] resurrection they believed in
[1:01:29] angels Mara said Sith unto him I know
[1:01:33] but he shall rise again in the
[1:01:35] resurrection at the last day looking at
[1:01:39] the resurrection is a further
[1:01:42] event not knowing that the resurrection
[1:01:45] was a
[1:01:47] person and not only that 25 Jesus said
[1:01:52] unto her he's not even saying I'm life
[1:01:55] he's saying
[1:01:56] I am the resurrection even the life
[1:01:59] after the
[1:02:02] resurrection I'm not only the
[1:02:04] Resurrection The Life After the
[1:02:06] resurrection I am so what you see as an
[1:02:09] event a further event I am it even the
[1:02:14] life after the resurrection I am that
[1:02:18] it's and he that believeth in me though
[1:02:22] he were dead yet shall he live live I
[1:02:27] have a a quotation here for the time
[1:02:29] sake I don't know where it is but the
[1:02:31] prophet of God says that when sometimes
[1:02:34] even us we still have some Pentecostal
[1:02:37] background in Baptist when we see the
[1:02:40] Son of God we see a lower son there's a
[1:02:44] father somewhere with a long
[1:02:48] beard when we say this Jesus is the son
[1:02:51] of God there are tendency there's always
[1:02:54] a tendency to think that there's a
[1:02:56] father somewhere with the white long
[1:02:59] beard and Jesus is a son out down here
[1:03:03] the prophet of God says that a Son of
[1:03:06] God Jesus being the Son of God means the
[1:03:10] word wrapped with
[1:03:13] flesh there's no a father sitting
[1:03:15] somewhere with a beard it's the fullness
[1:03:18] of the word of God came down and for men
[1:03:22] to see it it wrapped itself with the
[1:03:24] flesh amen
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:29] 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth me
[1:03:33] shall never die believeth thou
[1:03:37] this that was the spoken word and Martha
[1:03:42] had an
[1:03:45] opportunity to be born again
[1:03:49] praise Martha had an opportunity for
[1:03:52] that seed that was inside of her that
[1:03:55] Jesus Jesus loved her so much that she
[1:03:58] couldn't even knowing that within me
[1:04:01] there's a seed of deity in that seed
[1:04:05] there in this very moment quickened
[1:04:10] amen whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:04:14] me shall never die believeth thou this
[1:04:18] she said unto him yay Lord I believe
[1:04:21] that thou are the Christ she never knew
[1:04:24] that this is by revelation amen and if
[1:04:26] you see it's the very the
[1:04:29] same statement amen that Peter right by
[1:04:34] the Holy Ghost
[1:04:37] declared amen it's Christ
[1:04:41] said I believe that thou are the Christ
[1:04:44] the son of God which should come into
[1:04:48] the world and when she had said she had
[1:04:52] so said know what she did she never she
[1:04:56] she for the the the her work was done
[1:04:59] she just declared that and walked away
[1:05:03] everything was perfect from that time
[1:05:06] on Bible said she said unto yay and 28
[1:05:11] and when she had she had so said she
[1:05:13] went her her way and called Mary her
[1:05:17] sister
[1:05:19] secretly saying the master is come and
[1:05:24] corth for thee
[1:05:26] no question Jesus are you coming to uh
[1:05:30] rise my raise my brother
[1:05:32] up right because she was in a such a
[1:05:36] level that the Revelation was so struck
[1:05:39] her in such a way that all was
[1:05:43] well didn't say come with me mm come and
[1:05:47] resurrect Lazarus nope something has
[1:05:50] happened in my life turned
[1:05:53] away and just went
[1:05:56] Mary he call for
[1:06:00] you this message is a
[1:06:04] secret
[1:06:05] calling Martha is coming when you see
[1:06:09] our pastor here every day Wednesday
[1:06:11] Sunday it's just Martha telling Mary he
[1:06:15] cth for you amen
[1:06:23] amen as soon as she heard that she arose
[1:06:26] quickly this is Mary and came unto him
[1:06:29] now Jesus was not yet come into the town
[1:06:32] Jesus was still in that town in
[1:06:36] Jerusalem still there everything is
[1:06:38] happening outside of
[1:06:40] Bethany these ladies are walking Bethy
[1:06:44] 1.8 miles how long it would take a lady
[1:06:47] to walk there in the cold of
[1:06:52] winter and then she went and she came
[1:06:55] back maybe 45
[1:06:56] minutes and things happened there and
[1:06:58] she's backing again going back again and
[1:07:01] telling Mary and Mary's walking out the
[1:07:03] same same could you imagine how critical
[1:07:07] people were CR criticizing
[1:07:10] them of things that were happening you
[1:07:13] have Lazarus dead here what what are
[1:07:15] what's going on with you guys you just
[1:07:17] one goes and comes back and the other
[1:07:19] going and they didn't know that
[1:07:21] something
[1:07:23] Celestial Something Heavenly
[1:07:26] was being unfold on the earth in the
[1:07:28] lives of these three two
[1:07:34] people 30 now Jesus was not yet coming
[1:07:38] into the town but was in that place
[1:07:40] where Martha met him the
[1:07:43] Jews were then which were with her in
[1:07:46] the house and comforted her when they
[1:07:49] saw Mary that she rose up hly and went
[1:07:53] out followed her saying she goes on to
[1:07:55] the Grave to weep then when Mary was
[1:07:58] come where Jesus was and saw him what
[1:08:02] did she do Martha came Martha was
[1:08:06] standing yeah because the Revelation
[1:08:09] didn't struck struck her early that
[1:08:12] after the Revelation she she left but
[1:08:15] Mary because she was already born again
[1:08:20] when she's approaching she's kneeling
[1:08:22] down yeah amen two different scenarios
[1:08:25] MH she fell down at his feet saying unto
[1:08:29] him Lord if thou had been here my
[1:08:31] brother had not died I know a a few
[1:08:35] minutes kids give me 10 more minutes
[1:08:40] 8:30 the prophet of God says
[1:08:45] something in the the presence of God
[1:08:49] unrecognized he
[1:08:51] said first you've got to recognize him
[1:08:56] you might have a
[1:08:58] need but if you don't recognize him it
[1:09:00] would do you any good Marth Mary they
[1:09:04] had a need Lazarus was sick but did not
[1:09:07] recognize that this man was great more
[1:09:09] than a prophet but when they recognize
[1:09:13] it things were perfectly well they
[1:09:16] didn't even force it Jesus said where
[1:09:18] have you buried followed them and the
[1:09:21] prophet of God says that now when he is
[1:09:24] not recognized
[1:09:26] IED his power is always not
[1:09:33] revealed Marth and Mary did not
[1:09:36] recognize him when they were cooking for
[1:09:38] him when they were taking care of him
[1:09:42] and his power could not be
[1:09:44] released but when they did recognize him
[1:09:47] that he was the Christ the son of the
[1:09:49] Living God things start unfolding
[1:09:53] opening up for them and the the prophet
[1:09:55] of God says that when he is not
[1:09:57] recognized his power is always not
[1:10:01] revealed no matter how much God Is
[1:10:04] Standing present you've got to believe
[1:10:07] it some place he said you can do
[1:10:10] pennant 40 days you can fast for 40 days
[1:10:14] you can you can walk on on your knees
[1:10:17] you can do you can harm yourself he
[1:10:20] doesn't do you any good until you
[1:10:23] recognize him that's right
[1:10:26] he said like the woman with the blood
[1:10:29] issue all them people passing by all of
[1:10:32] them standing up saying there goes the
[1:10:35] rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a
[1:10:37] Prophet this is The Fanatic in all such
[1:10:41] uh as that but what happened this little
[1:10:44] woman had an issue of blood she had a
[1:10:48] need and she had heard about him and
[1:10:51] when she come down regardless of what
[1:10:54] anybody said
[1:10:56] said she recognized who he was that's
[1:11:00] that that made the difference everybody
[1:11:03] else was critici criticizing him some
[1:11:07] else believed that he was a prophet but
[1:11:10] her something struck her inside her said
[1:11:13] no no this is not a Prophet this is your
[1:11:17] creator this is the one who can who can
[1:11:20] create something new he created your
[1:11:22] body he created all that's inside of you
[1:11:25] he can create something
[1:11:27] new and when she come down there I read
[1:11:31] that she recognized who he was and she
[1:11:33] said if I can only touch His
[1:11:37] Garment but when she touched Jesus
[1:11:40] didn't feel it it was the heart her her
[1:11:43] faith that touched
[1:11:46] Jesus and the prophet of God says and
[1:11:49] when that genuine faith in God became a
[1:11:52] positive thing that's what what we need
[1:11:55] all of us amen that Faith within us
[1:11:59] let's let's let let it become a positive
[1:12:02] thing let it recognize him and become a
[1:12:06] positive thing and when it became a
[1:12:09] positive thing to her what did it
[1:12:13] release it released his power to heal
[1:12:19] her it touched him in such a way he
[1:12:23] turned around and told her what was
[1:12:25] wrong with
[1:12:26] her and said your faith has saved you
[1:12:30] what did it
[1:12:34] faith faith after recognizing
[1:12:39] him other others standing there might
[1:12:43] have been sicker than she but you see
[1:12:46] she recognized his presence she know
[1:12:49] that was her opportunity in the prophet
[1:12:52] of God in the same message he goes he
[1:12:54] said if if we could only do that tonight
[1:12:57] I'm I'm winding
[1:13:00] down can we do that
[1:13:02] tonight can we recognize his presence in
[1:13:06] this little place where I'm standing
[1:13:08] here I have seen him speak to me day
[1:13:12] after day at this place I'm standing
[1:13:18] here I have seen him real this place
[1:13:22] than any other place
[1:13:24] amen have we recognized him don't look
[1:13:28] at the people that coming back here he
[1:13:30] might be fra sitting there but have you
[1:13:33] recognize him
[1:13:35] here could we do that
[1:13:40] tonight he said if we could only realize
[1:13:44] that he is appearing to us in these
[1:13:47] meetings he has been appearing to
[1:13:51] us if we could only realize that he is
[1:13:56] appearing to us in these meetings for
[1:13:58] one
[1:14:02] purpose he said that that one purpose is
[1:14:07] to release our desires that we have in
[1:14:11] him to
[1:14:12] us it might sound a little bit too much
[1:14:16] it's to release our
[1:14:19] desires we have desires we have needs
[1:14:23] that we have in him that are within us
[1:14:26] he wants those to be released back to
[1:14:32] us but we've got to recognize his
[1:14:36] presence and
[1:14:37] now how you recognize his
[1:14:41] presence is when the promised word of
[1:14:44] this age is made manifest right not the
[1:14:48] promised word of of Moses age of any
[1:14:52] other
[1:14:53] ages the age of the word for this age
[1:14:58] let us stand there too much to go too
[1:15:01] many to go but as
[1:15:15] we in the message
[1:15:18] absolute preached 1963 the prophet of
[1:15:21] God
[1:15:22] says now we have times that we have
[1:15:25] great
[1:15:27] scholarships and nothing against
[1:15:29] that that's all
[1:15:31] right all that
[1:15:33] goes goes good but you
[1:15:38] personally have got to meet God amen
[1:15:43] amen because the love of God is personal
[1:15:47] to you
[1:15:48] amen he loves you more than you will
[1:15:51] ever know
[1:15:55] loves you more than you would ever know
[1:15:57] just him to allow you to be even
[1:16:01] attending this place maybe maybe you
[1:16:04] came by
[1:16:07] chance that's not a
[1:16:09] chance amen that's his great love his
[1:16:13] Supreme decision wanted you to be in
[1:16:16] this place amen that you can hear from
[1:16:20] Heaven directly don't don't look at the
[1:16:23] the the the man flesh here
[1:16:25] right but you personally have got to
[1:16:29] meet God to a place that no one can
[1:16:33] twist any

[1:16:50] amen and something happened she didn't
[1:16:53] even ask for Jesus to go and raise up
[1:16:56] Lazarus because all became a
[1:17:02] reality you were
[1:17:04] there you you the one that met him don't
[1:17:08] let mother meet him for you amen don't

[1:23:50] months to 6 months one day something
[1:23:52] like
[1:23:53] that we love our brother and uh he's
[1:23:57] already visited brother Mike Wall's
[1:23:58] Church in Washington DC they've got
[1:24:00] acquainted that's where they'll be
[1:24:01] attending while they're there so I know
[1:24:03] that there'll be a huge blessing for the

[1:24:07] remember to be praying for brother
[1:24:08] Emanuel and sister Mimi their children

[1:24:12] God will bless him through his work God
[1:24:14] will bless him there and the fellowship
[1:24:16] of saints there in Washington DC and and
[1:24:20] I've already asked him to take a service
[1:24:21] coming up here in a couple months so I'm
[1:24:23] already working on a date trying to get
[1:24:25] him back so we'll just be praying that

[1:24:30] and forth but I thank God for every
[1:24:33] brother and sister here thank God for
[1:24:35] the fellowship that we share we don't
[1:24:37] really recognize it till we have a
[1:24:39] parting and this is a temporary party in

[1:24:43] what value there is in every soul and
