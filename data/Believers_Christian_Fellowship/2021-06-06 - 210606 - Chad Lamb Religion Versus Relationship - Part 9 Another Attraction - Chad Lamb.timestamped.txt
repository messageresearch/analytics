[6:48] again
[6:49] amen let's look at genesis chapter three
[6:55] we're going to continue on with the the
[6:57] series we've been on with religion
[6:59] versus relationship
[7:00] this is part nine and i want to minister
[7:03] on the subtitle
[7:05] another attraction another attraction
[7:08] i'm going to back up and we're going to
[7:09] do just a little bit of review
[7:11] and get caught back up and then move
[7:13] from there genesis chapter 3 verse
[7:16] 6 and when the woman
[7:19] saw that the tree was good for food and
[7:21] that it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[7:23] tree to be desired
[7:24] to make one wise she took her the fruit
[7:27] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[7:29] her husband
[7:30] with her and he did eat and the eyes of
[7:32] them both were open
[7:34] and they knew that they were naked and
[7:36] they sewed fig leaves together
[7:38] and made themselves aprons and they
[7:40] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[7:43] in the garden in the cool of the day
[7:45] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[7:47] from the presence of the lord god among
[7:49] the trees
[7:50] of the garden and the lord god called
[7:52] unto adam and said unto him where art
[7:54] thou
[7:55] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[7:57] garden and i was afraid
[7:59] because i was naked and i hid myself
[8:02] and let's just bow our heads and ask the
[8:03] lord to bless his word this morning lord
[8:06] jesus we thank you father
[8:08] for the privileged lord to come into
[8:10] this place
[8:12] for it's by your grace lord that you've
[8:14] allowed us to gather like this
[8:16] and lord your mercies have been good
[8:17] unto us and your grace is abounded
[8:20] and lord we consider ourselves a
[8:21] privileged people
[8:23] and as we take this bible lord anybody
[8:26] with literacy can open it and read it
[8:28] but lord only you can open it by
[8:30] revelation
[8:32] that we might know lord what you're
[8:33] trying to speak to us in this day
[8:36] we pray god that you would come and
[8:37] break the bread yourself
[8:39] that you would feed us your sheep as we
[8:41] come expecting we come hungry
[8:43] we come lord needing from you that would
[8:46] that portion
[8:47] that you have allotted for us in this
[8:48] day we ask that you would bless the
[8:50] vessel
[8:51] that would speak only truth and god that
[8:53] you would anoint our ears to hear
[8:55] that we might perceive and receive all
[8:57] that you have for us in this day
[8:59] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[9:03] you can be seated it's a few things that
[9:06] we've been going over out here but i'd
[9:07] like to just
[9:08] bring to your attention out of this
[9:10] reading
[9:12] that we know here that the serpent is
[9:14] tempting the woman and as he's tempting
[9:15] the woman
[9:16] he's asking her questions about this
[9:18] tree that they had a commandment not to
[9:20] partake of
[9:22] and when he begins to ask her and begins
[9:24] to reason with her
[9:26] she moves she moves from faith
[9:29] in the word of god over to reasoning
[9:33] she's always been walking by faith
[9:36] because god said don't partake of this
[9:37] tree
[9:38] and she believed god and she didn't
[9:40] partake of the tree
[9:41] but now under the questioning of the
[9:43] serpent the serpent
[9:45] begins to speak to her reasoning and he
[9:48] begins to entice her
[9:50] and then by reasoning she takes a look
[9:52] at the tree
[9:53] and and she cannot discern with her
[9:56] reasoning what is wrong with the tree
[9:59] it looks good for food it's pleasant to
[10:01] the eye a tree to be desired to make one
[10:03] wise
[10:04] when she moves from faith to reasoning
[10:07] she is
[10:07] trapped under human reasoning and she
[10:10] falls
[10:11] she takes the tree that she was told not
[10:13] to take and she eats and gives to her
[10:15] husband
[10:16] he eats and immediately their eyes were
[10:18] open amen and they knew that they were
[10:20] naked before they were naked but their
[10:22] eyes were closed
[10:23] it wasn't that they were blind but they
[10:24] were under a veil of innocency
[10:26] that they could look upon each other and
[10:28] there was no lust there was no
[10:30] wrong desire there was there was no
[10:33] shame there was no
[10:34] awareness of nakedness that
[10:37] understanding had not been opened unto
[10:39] them
[10:39] until they partook of this tree
[10:42] and then their eyes were open amen and
[10:44] they knew good from evil
[10:46] and immediately adam
[10:50] goes to sow fig leaves adam and the
[10:53] woman they sow fig leaves
[10:55] and cover themselves and brother venom
[10:57] tells us
[10:58] in the message god hiding himself in
[11:00] simplicity he said in the beginning when
[11:02] man sinned it showed the nature of man
[11:05] he always trying to hide from god
[11:08] and make himself a way that he can feel
[11:11] justified
[11:12] a religion that's been a religion means
[11:14] a covering so he tried to make his own
[11:16] religion
[11:17] and so uh adam now begins to take these
[11:20] fig leaves and sew them together
[11:22] to cover his nakedness because that's
[11:25] what was opened under partaking of this
[11:27] tree he tried to cover his sin
[11:29] he tried to cover his shame with
[11:31] something he made himself his own
[11:33] covering
[11:35] and his own covering is his own religion
[11:37] he makes his own religion
[11:38] to try to cover himself amen but then
[11:41] when they recognizes the presence of god
[11:44] amen how does he recognize the presence
[11:46] of god this is so important for us to
[11:48] understand
[11:49] he does not recognize the presence of
[11:51] god by the simultude or the form
[11:55] he recognizes him by the voice
[11:59] he hears a voice and god coming he hears
[12:03] a voice
[12:03] in the garden and he hides himself from
[12:06] the presence of god so when he hears the
[12:08] voice
[12:08] he knows that god is now present and now
[12:11] he's hiding from the presence of god
[12:13] he didn't have to see something with his
[12:15] eyes to know that god was present
[12:16] when he heard his voice he knew god was
[12:18] present
[12:21] and under the voice of god adam hid
[12:24] himself
[12:26] and god said where are thou and he said
[12:28] i hidden myself because i was naked
[12:30] amen technically he was not naked
[12:33] because he had made fig leaves to cover
[12:35] himself
[12:36] he had made his own religion he made his
[12:38] own covering he made his own buffer
[12:40] between him and god
[12:41] amen but when he heard the voice of god
[12:44] under the recognizing of the presence of
[12:46] god and the voice of god
[12:47] he realized that his fig leaves were
[12:49] insufficient to cover his nakedness
[12:52] he had a fig leaf covering but he was
[12:54] naked
[12:56] because religion will never cover
[13:00] our sin
[13:04] then let's go to verse 21 chapter 3
[13:07] verse 21
[13:12] unto adam also unto his wife did the
[13:15] lord god make coats of skins
[13:17] and clothe them so now god
[13:22] god slays the first animals that have
[13:25] been slayed in this creation
[13:30] god himself comes down and he takes an
[13:33] innocent substitute that's going to
[13:35] substitute for the life of his children
[13:37] because they have sinned
[13:39] they deserve to die but god is the judge
[13:41] is going to come down
[13:43] and he's going to make a reconciliation
[13:45] and if he's going to get a coat of skins
[13:48] he has to get the skin
[13:49] off the animal so he has to slay the
[13:52] animal
[13:53] amen and he's showing what he's going to
[13:55] do when he brings his own lamb the son
[13:58] of god
[13:58] as god's lamb and he slay that lamb amen
[14:01] to cover the sins of his children
[14:03] so this is a foreshadow of what's coming
[14:06] and so
[14:06] god slays the first beast amen and he
[14:10] slays the first beast
[14:11] to reconcile his children back to them
[14:14] to make an atonement for them
[14:16] and to cover their nakedness to cover
[14:18] the shame of their sin
[14:20] they couldn't come up with their own
[14:21] covering god as the good father
[14:24] he provided a bloody atonement and he
[14:26] provided skins for the covering so man
[14:30] is not going
[14:31] to make his own religion that'll be
[14:33] sufficient god will provide for him a
[14:35] covering
[14:36] and the only covering that's sufficient
[14:38] is the god-provided covering
[14:41] that's why in this day a prophet came to
[14:44] clothe the bride
[14:45] in the word and the word is the only
[14:48] appropriate covering
[14:51] because the word is himself
[14:56] in in the message fellowship from 1960
[14:58] he said in closing i might say this in
[15:00] the garden of eden when god saw that his
[15:02] children had sinned
[15:03] and had gone from him god himself who is
[15:05] a supreme judge
[15:07] made a reconciliation so that he could
[15:09] restore that fellowship to his creatures
[15:12] by the shed blood of an animal so we've
[15:15] been talking about everything begins in
[15:17] genesis everything
[15:18] that we see going on today started in
[15:20] genesis
[15:22] everything that winds up in revelation
[15:23] began in genesis genesis is the seed
[15:25] chapter of the whole bible
[15:26] everything starts there and moves its
[15:28] way through and comes to full
[15:30] fruition amen so god laid down a pattern
[15:33] his fallen children now he would come
[15:36] down himself
[15:37] as a voice expose the nakedness of the
[15:42] of their fig the insufficiency of their
[15:44] religion
[15:46] then he would offer a substitute of an
[15:48] innocent one the shedding of blood for
[15:50] the remission of sins
[15:52] and then he would provide a covering
[15:53] that he would cover them with
[15:55] so that he can restore fellowship with
[15:57] his creation
[15:59] this is the story of the whole bible
[16:03] and god foreshadowed it right here at
[16:04] the beginning because
[16:06] god god wants to restore what satan
[16:09] tried to destroy
[16:10] which was fellowship and harmony between
[16:12] god and his children
[16:15] now let's move over to genesis chapter
[16:17] four like i said we're just doing a
[16:18] quick review and moving through
[16:20] genesis chapter 4
[16:25] verse 3 and in the process
[16:28] of time it came to pass that cain
[16:32] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[16:33] offering unto the lord
[16:34] and abel he also brought of the first
[16:36] things of his flock and of the fat
[16:38] thereof
[16:39] and the lord had respect unto abel into
[16:41] his offering but unto cain and to his
[16:43] offering
[16:44] he had not respect and cain was very
[16:46] roth
[16:47] and his countenance fell
[16:51] hebrews 11 4 tells us by faith abel
[16:55] offered unto god a more excellent
[16:56] sacrifice than cain
[16:58] by which he obtained witness that he was
[17:00] righteous
[17:01] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[17:04] being dead yet speaketh
[17:06] so hebrews tells us that faith abel
[17:09] offered a more excellent sacrifice by
[17:11] faith amen
[17:12] faith in it was a revelation god gave a
[17:15] revelation to abel
[17:17] of what it would take to bring a
[17:18] reconciliation amen and by faith abel
[17:21] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[17:24] cain
[17:26] by which he obtained witness that he was
[17:29] righteous
[17:29] it proved he was the righteous one
[17:32] because he could receive
[17:34] by faith what cain could not even follow
[17:37] by instruction
[17:39] because god tried to instruct cain and
[17:41] said just do well send life at the door
[17:44] if you do well amen amen want to be well
[17:46] with thee
[17:47] and cain could not even repeat abel's
[17:50] offering
[17:51] but abel caught it by faith by a
[17:54] revelation
[17:55] amen a you know noah built an ark by
[17:58] faith amen god revealed to him the plan
[18:00] of salvation for his day
[18:01] he believed it he went into action
[18:04] amen by faith all these characters in
[18:07] hebrews 11
[18:08] operated by faith god revealed something
[18:10] in each age
[18:11] and each day he revealed to noah the
[18:14] plan of salvation was an ark
[18:15] i mean he revealed to abraham his plan
[18:18] of redemption was through a promised
[18:19] seed
[18:20] i mean he brought he keep giving
[18:22] revelation for the
[18:23] for the message of their day and they
[18:25] were able to receive
[18:26] that revelation and that revelation
[18:29] testified that they were righteous
[18:30] and by faith they went into action upon
[18:33] the revelation
[18:35] and in the message god of this evil age
[18:38] he says now notice
[18:39] cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice
[18:41] he came down and offered the fruit the
[18:43] fields of beauty upon his altar
[18:45] very religious done everything that just
[18:47] exactly like abel done
[18:49] offered a sacrifice fell down before god
[18:52] in worship obedient every way
[18:54] but without the revelation of the word
[18:57] now we're going to begin to see why
[18:59] faith is so essential
[19:01] and faith is not a concept that's taught
[19:05] you cannot teach somebody and instruct
[19:08] them to have faith because faith
[19:10] is not intellectual amen faith is a gift
[19:12] that comes from god
[19:14] for by grace you're saved through faith
[19:19] and that not of yourselves it is the
[19:21] gift of god
[19:23] so the ability that abel had to believe
[19:26] wasn't an
[19:26] education wasn't a seminary instruction
[19:29] and it wasn't a workbook amen it wasn't
[19:32] anything like that it wasn't even a
[19:34] memorization of scripture
[19:35] or attendance to church abel had
[19:38] something that was a gift from god
[19:42] and cain did not have that same thing he
[19:44] was not able to believe
[19:45] but but abe or cain was not able to
[19:48] believe abel was able to believe
[19:50] because he had faith and when you look
[19:51] at hebrews 11
[19:53] these are all we call them the heroes of
[19:55] faith
[19:57] heroes of faith amen but the question
[20:01] the question remains how were they
[20:03] heroes amen
[20:04] what did they do amen they
[20:07] only believed what god told them
[20:10] and acted upon their faith and that
[20:13] faith was not their own it was a gift
[20:15] from god
[20:17] proving that they were the children of
[20:19] god the seed of god
[20:20] always operated by faith in hebrews 11
[20:23] comes to
[20:24] to accentuate that to show you that it
[20:26] was by faith and by faith and by
[20:28] all the way down through it's been by
[20:30] faith
[20:33] faith in want not faith in what had been
[20:35] done faith in the plan of redemption and
[20:37] salvation for your day
[20:41] and abel was able to receive that and
[20:42] cain was not and so
[20:44] now it's testifying right here at the
[20:47] beginning
[20:48] these are two forms of worship amen
[20:51] and in these two forms of worship amen
[20:54] one is cain who's worshiping according
[20:58] to his
[20:58] own intellect in his own desire
[21:04] now it's not that he had a bad offering
[21:07] because the scripture says abel had a
[21:09] more excellent
[21:10] it didn't say that cain's was not a good
[21:13] offering
[21:13] because he offered first fruits and that
[21:15] would be established later
[21:16] as a good offering
[21:20] but it was not the offering that would
[21:23] bring redemption it was the
[21:24] substitutionary lamb
[21:28] that would bring redemption and
[21:29] reconciliation
[21:32] so cain had a form of worship
[21:35] and abel had a form of worship
[21:39] and both of them were sincere in their
[21:42] worship
[21:45] we have to understand cain wanted to
[21:48] worship god
[21:50] and abel wanted to worship god
[21:54] king went through great efforts to
[21:57] provide the offering that he provided
[22:01] laboring tilling in the soil growing the
[22:03] garden building
[22:04] the altar presenting what he had grown
[22:07] what he had labored for what he had
[22:08] produced
[22:09] and he worked really hard abel didn't
[22:12] work
[22:12] all abel did was caught a revelation of
[22:15] god
[22:16] what god wanted and took one of the
[22:18] lambs that were there
[22:19] one of the flock and he took it and he
[22:21] hacked it to pieces and
[22:22] and let the blood flow all over the
[22:24] place and that was what god accepted
[22:26] but abel did not put forth as much
[22:29] effort
[22:31] as cain proving that religious works
[22:35] will
[22:35] not produce faith and religious works in
[22:39] itself
[22:40] does not equal exception by god
[22:44] but we get so many religious forms and
[22:46] these religious
[22:47] forms will produce a system of works a
[22:50] church order
[22:51] amen because there's a comfort in doing
[22:54] something that will get
[22:57] me recognized or find favor with god
[23:02] and if you can do something to produce
[23:05] that
[23:06] it's no longer by grace but now by debt
[23:08] now if you do the work that you're
[23:10] supposed to do
[23:12] then god can no longer save you by grace
[23:15] he saves you by debt he owes you
[23:17] salvation
[23:21] but it's not by debt it's by grace
[23:26] so because it was by grace god required
[23:29] faith to come in contact with his grace
[23:34] it wasn't going to be by works by effort
[23:38] by beauty or even by sincerity
[23:43] because you can be sincerely wrong
[23:46] cain was sincerely wrong
[23:49] cain was rejected and he becomes so roth
[23:52] he eventually killed his brother
[23:55] because he couldn't stand the truth
[23:58] now abel had the voice of truth in the
[24:00] voice of truth and made cain's worship
[24:02] nakedness and cain became angry
[24:06] and he killed his brother what did he
[24:09] kill him over
[24:10] it was all over worship
[24:16] now further on in this god of this evil
[24:18] lady he said and the word
[24:20] was from the beginning god's plan
[24:25] but god revealed by revelation the very
[24:28] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[24:30] that was right
[24:31] not religion not an altar not belonging
[24:34] to church
[24:35] not making a sacrifice not being sincere
[24:38] but by the revelation of the word of god
[24:42] that brings accepted worship
[24:46] now i want to move on we reviewed we
[24:48] just touched a review
[24:49] to bring everybody up to speed and now
[24:51] we're let's begin to move forward
[24:53] i'm going to read several quotes from
[24:54] the god of this evil age
[24:56] the prophet of god says notice closely
[24:58] now as we study the word god of this
[25:00] evil age
[25:01] that we're now living may seem strange a
[25:04] very strange thing in this age of grace
[25:06] when god is taking a people for his
[25:08] name's sake that is his bride
[25:10] in this evil age that should be called
[25:13] the age of evil
[25:14] the very age that god is calling a
[25:16] people for his name's sake by grace
[25:19] calling them out and is called an evil
[25:21] age
[25:22] so brother man is going to start laying
[25:23] down a principle here he's going to
[25:25] start showing
[25:26] that the very age of grace
[25:29] perfect grace coming to the to the
[25:31] completion
[25:32] of the work of grace is going to be the
[25:34] very age of evil
[25:37] they're going to run on parallel tracks
[25:40] he goes on to say in the god of this
[25:41] evil
[25:42] age what would god call a people out of
[25:44] this age for
[25:45] his name the reason it is is to try her
[25:49] his bride when she has made manifest
[25:52] been tried been proved proved to satan
[25:55] like it was at the beginning
[25:57] so shall it be at the end so why would
[26:00] god call out a bride
[26:02] in such an evil age and satan's eden and
[26:04] the pinnacle of all satan's been trying
[26:06] to do
[26:07] bringing everything that he imagined
[26:09] about till he is the god
[26:11] of this world is that what the bible
[26:14] says
[26:15] he is the god of this world he has
[26:18] control when he took jesus up
[26:20] amen on the pinnacle or on the mountain
[26:22] he showed them all the kingdoms and he
[26:23] said i'll give them all to you if you
[26:25] bow to me
[26:26] he was over them all jesus never rebuked
[26:28] him and said you don't have the
[26:29] authority to do that
[26:30] he has the authority because adam fell
[26:33] adam lost the title deed of all creation
[26:35] amen and now
[26:36] the devil comes as a squatter to set
[26:38] himself up as the god of this world
[26:42] he's the prince of the power of the air
[26:46] and now
[26:50] in this evil age when we've come to the
[26:52] pinnacle of satan's eden
[26:54] we know that god spent six thousand
[26:57] years to create his eden now
[26:59] now the devil satan has made six
[27:01] thousand years to create his eden
[27:03] but in the pinnacle of his creation when
[27:05] he gets to the height of his power
[27:07] when he has control of all the world
[27:09] amen that's when god is going to call a
[27:11] bride out
[27:12] and it seems like a such contrast but
[27:14] god loves the contrast
[27:17] god loves the contrast amen god loves
[27:20] little david
[27:21] a boy who's not even old enough to fight
[27:23] in the army yet amen he loves
[27:25] that little boy killing the greatest
[27:27] soldier amen that ever was
[27:29] what was in that valley god loves the
[27:32] contrast
[27:35] so now in this evil age he's going to
[27:37] call a bride why
[27:38] to try her now listen he
[27:42] brother brahm said it's coming right
[27:44] back to the beginning again
[27:46] because in god's eden the bride was
[27:48] tried
[27:49] the woman was tried and she fell
[27:52] but now in satan's eating listen the
[27:55] woman
[27:55] fell in a realm of perfection
[27:58] in eden was eden perfection perfect love
[28:02] perfect peace
[28:03] perfect creation perfect harmony with
[28:05] nature perfect relationship
[28:06] perfect fellowship perfect everything
[28:09] imperfection she come face to face
[28:11] amen with temptation with the trial and
[28:13] she fell
[28:14] but now god in order to have victory
[28:17] he's going to go to the opposite extreme
[28:19] now not in perfection but in
[28:22] imperfection with
[28:23] and perfect imperfection and perfect
[28:26] perversion
[28:28] when everything that god ordained has
[28:29] been perverted by the devil when the
[28:31] whole society and culture and everything
[28:33] has been perverted by the devil
[28:34] when the devil has absolute control over
[28:36] everything in the world and everything
[28:38] is under a perversion
[28:39] and everything lays in wickedness
[28:43] it's in the face of that he's gonna call
[28:45] out a bride
[28:46] and let her stand the same test that the
[28:48] first one test
[28:49] because god loves to overcome he loves
[28:52] to show his power
[28:53] he loves to show his might amen and if
[28:56] you think
[28:56] that you are able in yourself to
[28:59] overcome
[28:59] in this satan's eden you are mistaken
[29:02] it's not you
[29:03] it's greater is he that is in me than he
[29:05] that is in the world
[29:06] god is going to show himself mighty
[29:09] in this evil generation because he'll
[29:11] have a bride that won't take her
[29:13] reasoning won't take her own thinking
[29:15] but she'll stay with the word of god
[29:18] and won't exchange it for any idea any
[29:24] reasoning
[29:27] continuing on in the same message we
[29:29] find now this evil ages to prove
[29:32] to satan she is not like eve
[29:36] prove to satan why would god do that
[29:40] why would he call us in such a wicked
[29:42] world and let it get into such
[29:43] wickedness
[29:44] amen to prove to satan did did god not
[29:47] already do this once in the bible
[29:49] what about job who was god proving job
[29:54] to
[29:54] to satan the devil comes
[29:58] amen and satan presents himself with the
[30:00] sons of god
[30:01] amen and they have a dialogue and god
[30:04] says what have you been doing i've been
[30:05] roaming to and from and back and forth
[30:06] over the face of the earth and he said
[30:08] have you considered my servant job
[30:10] there is none like him
[30:13] who was god proving job to to the devil
[30:19] and he's going to do the same thing with
[30:20] his bride she is not like eve
[30:24] she is not that type of a woman she will
[30:27] be tried by his word the bride as adam's
[30:29] bride was tried by the word
[30:31] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[30:33] the word all but confused on one promise
[30:36] that he's the same yesterday today and
[30:38] forever today see but failed on one
[30:40] promise under the temptation of the
[30:42] enemy
[30:42] face to face and now the people that's
[30:44] called for his name
[30:45] of course is his bride she is to come in
[30:48] contact again by the same
[30:50] thing not by just denominational truth
[30:52] or something
[30:53] but every word and she will keep
[30:57] every word again in the god of this evil
[31:01] age he says the
[31:02] two spirits one of them god's holy
[31:05] spirit the other one the devil spirit
[31:07] working
[31:08] in deception the people of the earth are
[31:11] now
[31:11] making their choice the holy spirit is
[31:13] here calling out a bride for christ
[31:15] he is doing it by vindicating his word
[31:17] of promise to her
[31:19] for this age showing that it is christ
[31:22] if the finger is supposed to move in
[31:23] this age the finger will move if the
[31:25] foot is supposed to move in this age the
[31:26] foot will move
[31:27] if the eye is to see in this age the eye
[31:29] will see
[31:31] the spirit of god as is growed into the
[31:33] full
[31:34] stature of god is the age that we're now
[31:36] living in
[31:38] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[31:39] message of the hour
[31:41] and the holy spirit is doing this so
[31:42] that the people that believe god will be
[31:44] called
[31:45] out of this chaos the devil's unholy
[31:48] spirit is here calling
[31:50] his church by the error as usual by
[31:53] perversion of the word of god
[31:55] like he did at the beginning see it
[31:57] coming right back to that seed time
[32:00] again from eden
[32:01] here it is again so we see here that
[32:06] the spirit of god is calling out a bride
[32:08] but the spirit of devil
[32:09] he's calling his church by the error
[32:12] as usual by perversion of the word of
[32:14] god amen because the battle is
[32:16] always around the word of god the devil
[32:19] is always working
[32:20] and trying to disrupt what god is doing
[32:23] amen the devil is not
[32:25] he's not any longer working in the bar
[32:27] room in the house of prostitution
[32:28] they're so given over to those spirits
[32:30] that's not where he's trying to win the
[32:32] battle he's trying to win the battle
[32:34] over god amen
[32:35] the war is between god and satan amen
[32:39] that's what the battle this great
[32:40] showdown is between god and satan
[32:42] and has everything to do with the word
[32:44] of god
[32:46] so that's why when he come to eve he
[32:48] perverted the commandment
[32:50] and he and he caused her to fail by a
[32:52] perverted commandment
[32:55] and today he's causing millions to fail
[32:58] by perverting the word of god by their
[33:00] reasonings changing it
[33:02] amen and adapting the word to their own
[33:04] understanding to their own liking to
[33:06] their own feeling to their own desire
[33:08] and they're adjusting the word of god to
[33:10] fit their
[33:11] own desire and plan and thinking and the
[33:14] devil is deceiving
[33:15] millions who go to church
[33:20] pray to mary do rosary beads baptizing
[33:23] father son
[33:24] and holy ghost changing the word to fit
[33:26] their own desire
[33:32] but god is going to in that day raise up
[33:34] a bride who will stick with the word
[33:37] stay with the bible let's go back to
[33:40] genesis chapter 3.
[33:52] chapter 3 and i want to go back to verse
[33:54] 1.
[33:59] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[34:00] beast of the field
[34:03] so he was wise to the ways of life
[34:07] he had wisdom and craftiness now the
[34:10] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[34:12] of the field which the lord god had made
[34:14] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[34:16] said you shall not eat of every tree
[34:19] of the garden and the woman said unto
[34:22] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[34:23] the trees of the garden
[34:25] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[34:26] the midst of the garden god has said you
[34:28] shall not eat of it
[34:29] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[34:33] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[34:34] shall not surely die
[34:37] now he's contradicting the word of god
[34:41] verse 5 for god does know that in the
[34:44] day ye
[34:44] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[34:47] opened and you shall be as gods
[34:49] knowing good and evil
[34:55] now imagine the woman
[34:58] she's not yet eve she doesn't get a name
[35:00] till after adultery
[35:03] she's just woman here her name is adam
[35:07] because genesis chapter 5 says in the
[35:09] day he created them he created the male
[35:10] and female and called their name
[35:12] adam she is mrs adam he is mr adam her
[35:16] name is adam
[35:17] she does not get a name until she
[35:18] becomes the mother of all living
[35:23] and so now the woman is living in a
[35:25] realm of god's perfection
[35:29] everything is at her fingertips she is a
[35:32] joint heir with adam and she is a
[35:33] co-ruler with adam
[35:36] is that true she came from adam she's
[35:39] part of adam
[35:41] her and adam are one god had separated
[35:44] from adam a rib and he formed a woman
[35:46] and united them back together and these
[35:47] two shall be one flesh
[35:49] and god looked down and called them one
[35:53] they were ruling and reigning together
[35:56] in eden she had dominion
[36:01] she had a perfect climate
[36:04] a perfect atmosphere a perfect union and
[36:07] fellowship with her husband
[36:09] a perfect fellowship with god in the
[36:11] cool of the evening when you've come
[36:13] walking in the garden
[36:15] everything was in harmony around her
[36:18] everything was in perfection
[36:19] and she had no need
[36:23] is that true she had no need
[36:28] until the sceptility of the serpent
[36:31] who's anointed by the devil begins to
[36:33] speak to her
[36:34] and he begins to ask questions about the
[36:36] commandment
[36:38] and as he's asking questions about the
[36:39] commandment he begins to sow a doubt
[36:42] about you know you'll not surely die
[36:46] for god doth know that in the day you
[36:50] eat thereof
[36:51] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[36:52] shall be as gods knowing good
[36:55] and evil she was already a god upon the
[36:59] earth
[37:00] she was already had dominion and
[37:02] rulership and power and authority
[37:04] and everything was subject to her and
[37:06] her husband amen but now
[37:08] the devil amen showed a doubt in her
[37:12] heart
[37:12] and then created a need
[37:17] then all of a sudden she was no longer
[37:21] satisfied
[37:22] with what god gave her
[37:25] now she began to want something
[37:29] that god told her not to have and in
[37:32] wanting it
[37:34] her heart began to lust
[37:37] she had never lusted for evil before
[37:40] until the conversation with the serpent
[37:43] and now he begins to open the lust veil
[37:45] and she begins to desire this thing that
[37:49] god is holding
[37:50] back from me for god doesn't know see
[37:53] the serpent he he goes right to her
[37:57] logic and right to her reasoning
[37:58] and he creates in her desire but he also
[38:01] creates in her a lack
[38:03] she has never known lack before she has
[38:05] never
[38:06] lacked anything before but now he
[38:09] creates through his lie
[38:11] a lack
[38:14] and now she feels she has a need
[38:20] then after this conversation
[38:24] the woman looks at the tree and when the
[38:27] woman saw that tree was good for food
[38:29] that was pleasant to the eyes and the
[38:32] tree to be desired to make one wise
[38:34] she took her the fruit thereof and did
[38:36] eat
[38:39] see she was in perfection
[38:44] what would cause her to leave perfection
[38:48] to move there had to be
[38:52] an attraction the devil created an
[38:56] attraction of something more and then
[38:58] all of a sudden
[38:59] she began to have the lust of the eyes
[39:01] the lust of the flesh
[39:03] and the pride of life see you would
[39:06] never leave perfection
[39:08] without an attraction and then the
[39:10] attraction
[39:11] becomes more appealing than the
[39:13] perfection that you live in
[39:16] this is how the devil brings deception
[39:18] let's look at first john together
[39:28] first john
[39:34] chapter 2 verse 15.
[39:40] first john chapter 2 verse 15
[39:44] love not the world neither the things
[39:45] that are in the world if any man love
[39:47] the world the love of the father is not
[39:49] in him
[39:50] for all that is in the world the lust of
[39:52] the flesh the lust of the eyes
[39:54] and the pride of life is not of the
[39:57] father
[39:57] but as of the world and when she began
[40:00] to look at this tree
[40:01] she began to express all three of these
[40:03] lust of the eyes
[40:04] lust of the flesh and the pride of life
[40:07] she saw that it was a tree good for food
[40:09] pleasant to the eyes
[40:11] and desirable to make one wise and she
[40:13] began
[40:14] to have new thoughts and then she'd
[40:17] begin to have new thoughts about god
[40:19] she began to lean to her reasoning
[40:21] instead of just simple faith in the word
[40:23] of god
[40:24] and she began to reason through and why
[40:27] would she reason
[40:28] why would she even begin to reason this
[40:31] out is because
[40:32] now there was something in her that
[40:34] wanted that tree
[40:37] the devil had to paint the picture in
[40:39] such a way that she wanted the tree so
[40:41] that she would go
[40:42] back and reevaluate the word of god with
[40:44] her reasoning
[40:45] so that she could go forward and feel
[40:48] justified
[40:49] to have what lust had now caused her to
[40:51] want
[40:54] and the devil is working in the same
[40:56] pattern
[40:57] all the time let's look at this in james
[41:00] james chapter 1.
[41:06] james chapter 1 verse 13
[41:15] let no man say that when he is tempted i
[41:17] am tempted of god
[41:18] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[41:20] neither tempteth he any man
[41:22] but every man is tempted when he is
[41:24] drawn away of his
[41:25] own lust and enticed
[41:28] then when lust hath conceived it
[41:30] bringeth for sin and sin when it is
[41:32] finished bringeth forth death
[41:34] do not air my beloved brethren god
[41:38] don't say i'm tempted of god but every
[41:40] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[41:42] his
[41:42] own lust amen who is your greatest enemy
[41:46] this man right here amen so i probably
[41:48] said my the greatest enemy i got is
[41:50] william branham
[41:51] he's the one that's always getting in
[41:53] god's way
[41:55] this man this the this body of death
[41:58] that i live in it's got to come
[41:59] subject to the word but it's the thing
[42:02] that always wants
[42:03] what it wants amen it has lust it has
[42:05] desires and it wants what it wants
[42:07] amen and the human mind is also fallen
[42:10] and that human mind under the cravings
[42:12] of
[42:12] of a fallen nature begins to try to
[42:15] reason
[42:16] to have what it wants and it'll even
[42:18] take the word of god
[42:20] and begin to reason the word of god to
[42:22] be to fulfill the lust of the flesh
[42:26] so god doesn't tempt you
[42:30] were drawn away of your own lust
[42:34] let's go back to genesis chapter 6.
[42:44] genesis chapter 6 and verse 1
[42:50] and it came to pass when men began to
[42:52] multiply on the face of the earth and
[42:54] daughters were born unto them
[42:55] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[42:57] of men that they were fair
[42:58] and they took them wise of all they
[43:00] chose and the lord said my spirit shall
[43:02] not always strive with man
[43:03] for that he also is flesh yet his day
[43:06] shall be a hundred
[43:07] and twenty years now all of a sudden the
[43:10] sons of god which are supposed to live a
[43:11] separated life
[43:12] amen they begin they begin to get
[43:15] enticed with the daughters of men the
[43:17] lineage of cain
[43:18] and they're supposed to live separated
[43:20] but all of a sudden they're enticed
[43:22] they're led away of their own lust
[43:23] and they begin to take unto them women
[43:26] all which they chose and
[43:27] god now said i'm finished i will my
[43:30] spirit will not always dwell with man
[43:31] there'll be 120 years and i'll destroy
[43:33] the thing
[43:34] because the devil's always working with
[43:37] lust
[43:39] bam said in in the message united under
[43:43] one head so remember beauty is deceitful
[43:48] it was satan's idea to make a better
[43:50] more brighter kingdom than michael's
[43:52] beauty was the downfall to begin with
[43:54] and the devil has used that ever since
[43:56] what a thing it is today to see that
[43:58] kingdom of the devil is made so pretty
[44:01] and a lot of people fall for it now
[44:03] remember the devil
[44:04] is religious let's say amen
[44:08] the devil is religious
[44:11] he's not the sinister one down in the
[44:13] corner trying to sell
[44:14] drugs to your school kids amen that's
[44:16] the product of the fall of man
[44:18] amen that's demons that have been
[44:20] unleashed amen but the devil is
[44:22] religious
[44:22] he was part of worship in heaven part of
[44:25] the true worship of god
[44:26] he participated in that worship amen
[44:30] and he is religious amen he's the one
[44:33] that was anointing cain
[44:34] he's the one that was anointing all the
[44:36] pharisees and sadducees that withstood
[44:38] jesus the day that jesus christ was here
[44:40] when the word was made flesh when
[44:41] everything that moses wrote about was
[44:43] now standing in front of them
[44:45] it was the religious devil that had
[44:47] gotten into the pharisees and sadducees
[44:49] and chief priests and elders
[44:51] that were now calling jesus christ
[44:53] beelzebub
[44:55] and they called jesus christ beelzebub
[44:57] and they have a secret meeting on how
[44:59] they can kill him and then they walk out
[45:00] and they pray prayers and they burn
[45:02] incense and they drop some money in the
[45:03] offering
[45:05] totally anointed by devils and going
[45:08] through all the motions that moses had
[45:10] set out in the law
[45:11] keeping the law and judging other people
[45:13] according to the law
[45:19] that's the deception
[45:23] that's what trips up that's what the
[45:25] devil's trying to use to trip up the
[45:27] children of god
[45:27] and stop the progress of god's plan
[45:31] is religion religion is the problem
[45:35] now remember the devil's religious many
[45:37] people like to go down to church that's
[45:39] got great big high steeples on it
[45:41] and seats set so plush no wonder the
[45:43] preacher can't preach but 15 minutes
[45:45] you'd go to sleep in such a place and
[45:47] with a great big million dollar pipe
[45:49] organ and with the pastor with his
[45:50] collar buttoned in the back and a
[45:52] long robe on with some kind of little
[45:54] ear tickling something of some society
[45:56] or about some politics what we we don't
[45:59] want that
[46:00] the real child of god if he has to stand
[46:02] on the street corner on a little mission
[46:03] and hear the word of god preach
[46:05] and the power and demonstration of the
[46:07] holy ghost he'll pick it amen
[46:10] he won't go for the beauty he'll go for
[46:12] the character of the word
[46:15] i want to read two places in the in the
[46:17] scriptures let's go to ezekiel and then
[46:18] we'll go to isaiah
[46:19] let's go to ezekiel first i want to
[46:21] contrast these two
[46:23] places in the scripture ezekiel 28.
[46:31] all these things are very familiar to us
[46:33] but i want to build them together
[46:35] and get to where my heart is pointing me
[46:37] this morning
[46:39] ezekiel 28 and 11
[46:43] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[46:44] me saying son of man take up a
[46:46] lamentation against the king of tyrus
[46:48] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[46:50] thou seelest up the sum
[46:52] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[46:56] who is he talking about lucifer
[47:00] perfect in beauty thou has been in
[47:03] eden the garden of god who is in eden
[47:07] amen it was the devil thou
[47:10] has been in eden the garden of god every
[47:12] precious stone was thy covering the
[47:13] sardis the topaz the diamond the barrel
[47:15] the onyx
[47:16] the jasper the sapphire the emerald and
[47:18] the carbuncle and the gold
[47:20] the workmanship of thy taverns and thy
[47:22] pipes was prepared in the in the day
[47:23] that thou was created
[47:24] thou art the anointed cherub that
[47:26] covereth and i have set thee so
[47:28] thou wast upon the holy mountain of god
[47:31] thou hast walked up and down in the
[47:32] midst of stones of fire
[47:34] listen you think by intellect and wisdom
[47:36] that you're going to overcome
[47:38] this creature
[47:41] look at where he was look at what he saw
[47:43] look at what he understood
[47:44] look at his proximity to god
[47:47] in the creation in the garden of eden
[47:50] amen he was a covering cherub he was
[47:52] right there
[47:52] over the throne of god amen you think by
[47:56] intellect and wisdom you're going to
[47:57] outreason him you'll never
[47:59] outreason him but there's got to be a
[48:01] gift of faith that my predestination has
[48:03] been dropped into your soul
[48:04] that when you come in contact with the
[48:06] living word of god something inside says
[48:08] that's the truth
[48:11] because you're not god wisdom in schools
[48:13] and all of these things
[48:14] you're never going to discern you're
[48:16] never going to understand
[48:17] he's wiser he's he's full of wisdom and
[48:20] perfect in beauty
[48:24] and he's religious
[48:33] verse 15 thou was perfect
[48:36] in thy ways from the day that thou was
[48:40] created till iniquity was found in thee
[48:43] iniquity is knowing to do good and not
[48:46] doing it
[48:51] by the multitude of thy merchandise i
[48:53] have filled the midst of thee with
[48:55] violence
[48:55] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[48:57] cast this profane out of the mountain of
[48:59] god
[48:59] and i will destroy the old covering
[49:01] cherub from the midst of the stones
[49:03] of fire thine heart was lifted up
[49:06] because
[49:07] of thy beauty
[49:12] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[49:15] of thy brightness or illumination
[49:20] i will cast it to the ground i will lay
[49:22] thee before kings
[49:23] that they may behold thee
[49:27] lucifer himself
[49:30] was corrupted by his own beauty
[49:33] think about this he was so beautiful
[49:38] and so wise he corrupted
[49:41] himself by his own beauty in his own
[49:44] brightness
[49:48] that's the deception the deception
[49:51] is beauty and enlightenment and wisdom
[49:55] knowledge these are the deceptions by
[49:58] which he deceived by
[50:00] those are the deceptions why which he
[50:01] deceived himself by
[50:04] he he became deceived by his own beauty
[50:07] and by his own brightness and that's the
[50:09] very tool that he deceived himself
[50:11] is the very tool that he's using to
[50:12] deceive this world
[50:15] by wisdom by brightness and by beauty
[50:20] now let's go to isaiah 53.
[50:26] isaiah 53
[50:33] this is a prophecy of the coming of
[50:34] jesus christ
[50:39] isaiah 53 1 who hath believed our report
[50:42] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[50:45] revealed
[50:46] for he shall grow up before him as a
[50:48] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[50:51] he has no form nor comeliness
[50:54] and when we shall see him there is no
[50:56] beauty that we should desire
[50:58] him
[51:02] oh my he is despised
[51:05] and rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[51:08] acquainted with grief
[51:09] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[51:12] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[51:17] see the contrast between christ and
[51:20] lucifer
[51:23] christ comes in humility
[51:26] there was listen i want to i want to
[51:28] read this again
[51:31] verse 2 he shall grow up before him as a
[51:33] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[51:34] ground
[51:35] he has no form nor comeliness and we
[51:37] will
[51:38] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[51:40] shall desire him
[51:42] amen you realize
[51:46] that jesus christ he was not desirable
[51:50] because of his beauty that's what the
[51:53] scripture says
[51:55] but what made him beautiful was the
[51:57] character
[51:58] that was in him what made him desirable
[52:02] was the very life of god was living
[52:05] through that vessel
[52:06] and that is what became desirable it was
[52:09] the word of god
[52:10] on display it was the word of god being
[52:12] manifest
[52:13] it was the word made flesh and dwelt
[52:16] among us
[52:16] the beauty was the character of the
[52:19] father reflected in the sun
[52:21] it wasn't the outside form amen that's
[52:24] why he was rejected and that's why he
[52:25] was despised
[52:26] because he didn't he had he didn't have
[52:30] the same luster that lucifer had
[52:34] he had something greater than what
[52:37] lucifer ever could have
[52:39] he had the very character and life of
[52:41] god
[52:44] what was the attraction to christ
[52:48] the attraction was the word made flesh
[52:52] was the life of god what was the
[52:54] attraction to lucifer
[52:55] wisdom and beauty
[53:00] see jesus wasn't trying to attract
[53:03] people to his wisdom
[53:05] and he wasn't trying to attract him amen
[53:07] to
[53:08] his flesh he wasn't he was trying to
[53:10] connect them to god
[53:12] and he so was not trying to use his
[53:15] wisdom to attract him
[53:17] because he would say things that didn't
[53:19] make sense
[53:21] and lucifer when he's trying to use
[53:23] wisdom he tries to make
[53:25] the gospel so understandable that that
[53:28] you can't miss it
[53:30] water it down and simplify it until you
[53:32] begin to translate bibles and the bible
[53:34] translations are so watered down they
[53:36] have no meaning anymore
[53:38] because where the goal is to make it so
[53:40] simple nobody can miss
[53:42] it but jesus when he talked to nicodemus
[53:44] he said unless a man be born again he
[53:46] cannot enter to the kingdom and
[53:48] nicodemus says born again what do you
[53:50] mean born again
[53:51] do i have to go back as an adult enter
[53:53] into my mother's womb be borne out
[53:57] and jesus didn't explain it to him he
[53:59] said you're a master in israel and you
[54:00] don't even understand this
[54:04] he wasn't enticing by wisdom he wasn't
[54:07] enticing the intellect
[54:08] he wasn't there to to convince nicodemus
[54:11] he wasn't there to entice his intellect
[54:13] he wasn't there to make it so perfect
[54:15] nicodemus had no choice but to say
[54:17] that's it
[54:18] he jesus christ gave the truth and he
[54:20] gave it so
[54:21] difficult that the intellect was so
[54:23] baffled
[54:27] he looked at a group of disciples that
[54:28] we're following one time he says unless
[54:30] you drink the
[54:31] blood of the son of man and eat his
[54:32] flesh you have no part with him
[54:35] listen if you were standing there that
[54:37] day and you were a common human being
[54:39] with common human being understanding
[54:41] and
[54:41] all he said was unless you eat the flesh
[54:44] of the son of man and drink his blood
[54:46] you have no part with me what would you
[54:49] think
[54:50] here we are 2 000 years later looking
[54:52] back saying oh he's speaking of
[54:53] communion he's speaking of the spirit
[54:55] that's in him he's speaking of the word
[54:58] but in that day they didn't know that
[55:00] and he didn't stop and explain it
[55:04] he didn't give an explanation that would
[55:06] be easy to understand
[55:07] he didn't water it down
[55:10] so that unbelievers could be receiving
[55:12] it
[55:14] he just said it and he let the truth
[55:18] fall
[55:25] and many said we must go this is a hard
[55:27] saying
[55:30] and he said well if you think that's
[55:32] hard
[55:33] what if you see the son of man ascend up
[55:35] to where he was before
[55:39] what many of his disciples left him
[55:44] because he wasn't there to entice
[55:48] their intellect he was seeking for lost
[55:52] sheep
[55:53] and lost sheep have a secret ingredient
[55:58] the lost sheep have a secret ingredient
[56:00] they have a capacity
[56:02] to believe even when they don't
[56:04] understand
[56:06] there's something in them there's
[56:07] something in them that'll say
[56:10] i don't understand what you just said
[56:13] but i know you're telling the truth
[56:17] that's exactly what peter said
[56:20] he looked at this 12 and he said well
[56:22] you go also he said where would we go
[56:25] you alone have the words of eternal life
[56:27] and peter had no
[56:28] comprehension of what he meant my eat my
[56:30] flesh and drink my blood
[56:32] and ascend up where he was before that
[56:34] came later under the ministration of the
[56:35] holy ghost when he began to break the
[56:37] word down to them
[56:39] but that day he had a revelation he knew
[56:42] that was the son of god
[56:43] and he knew he had the words of eternal
[56:45] life
[56:46] but lucifer comes in and
[56:49] and he tries to use wisdom
[56:54] and beauty in a religious way
[56:59] to overtake the church of god
[57:03] brother rem said in marriage and divorce
[57:05] he said notice now
[57:06] but god is featured in character there
[57:09] is no beauty we should desire
[57:11] jesus but there never was a character
[57:13] like him
[57:14] on the earth now we find out today that
[57:17] the church character satan and his group
[57:19] look after big beautiful churches
[57:20] beautiful thing that's what the world
[57:22] looks at today
[57:23] oh it's the pastor the great so and so
[57:26] time so and so so priestly and godly
[57:28] walk out with his big robes and things
[57:30] like that they call that beauty
[57:32] but the real saints of god look for the
[57:33] character of the vindicated word
[57:36] that's what the saints did in that day
[57:38] when they seen jesus he wasn't nothing
[57:40] to look at
[57:41] but they seemed god was in him they seen
[57:44] god
[57:44] was in him and because they were
[57:47] children of god
[57:48] they were attracted to god
[57:53] and god in his word is the same thing
[57:56] and because they're children of god
[57:57] they're attracted to god and the word of
[57:59] god
[58:00] was god was with god it was made flesh
[58:03] and dwelt among us and when they saw
[58:05] the word of god made flesh because they
[58:07] were children of god they were attracted
[58:09] to god
[58:11] and they may not have been able to
[58:12] understand it it may not have been
[58:13] intellectual
[58:14] and it may not have been beautiful as
[58:16] carnal beauty is considered
[58:19] but there was something in them that was
[58:21] attracted to that
[58:23] until they would leave family they would
[58:25] leave businesses they would leave and
[58:27] they would begin to follow jesus
[58:30] and then when everybody see when they
[58:32] began to follow jesus it was exciting
[58:34] because they got on board and the
[58:36] movement began to grow
[58:37] rapidly you know there's healing
[58:38] campaigns and going from city to city
[58:40] and feeding five thousand all this it
[58:42] was exciting
[58:43] amen but the thing that attracted them
[58:46] was not the big meeting
[58:50] they were attracted to god so when the
[58:53] big meetings begin to fall apart
[58:55] amen and they begin to reject jesus
[58:57] christ more and more as he got closer to
[58:59] the crucifixion
[59:00] he became more and more rejected till
[59:02] his disciples walked away
[59:04] amen this group walked away that group
[59:06] walked away and when they were all
[59:07] walked away
[59:08] that group that was still attracted to
[59:10] god was still attracted to god
[59:15] because god hadn't changed whether the
[59:17] meetings were big whether the meetings
[59:18] were small where there was a lot of
[59:20] miracles where there was few miracles
[59:21] whether it was widely accepted or
[59:22] whether it was rejected
[59:24] god hadn't changed and the place god was
[59:27] dwelling hadn't changed
[59:28] and the word of god hadn't changed and
[59:30] what they were originally attracted to
[59:31] they
[59:32] were still attracted to
[59:35] and it shows those that came on board
[59:38] later when the campaigns were going out
[59:40] and the healing ministry was going out
[59:41] and all of israel was running after him
[59:43] amen when all of israel began to leave
[59:46] him and he began to have hard sayings
[59:50] they walked away because they weren't
[59:52] attracted to god
[59:53] they were attracted to whatever they
[59:55] were seeing
[59:56] there was another attraction
[1:00:02] but for the children of god there's got
[1:00:05] to be one attraction in our life
[1:00:07] that is greater than every other
[1:00:09] attraction
[1:00:11] and that's the attraction to god himself
[1:00:14] like a magnet pulling you through
[1:00:18] the attraction you're polarized to be
[1:00:20] attracted to god
[1:00:24] let's turn to exodus 32.
[1:00:44] exodus 32 and verse 1.
[1:00:58] when we look at verse one i want to read
[1:01:01] from one down to eight
[1:01:04] he said and when the people saw that
[1:01:05] moses delayed to come down out of the
[1:01:07] mount
[1:01:08] the people gathered themselves together
[1:01:10] unto aaron and said unto him
[1:01:12] up make us gods which shall go before us
[1:01:15] for as for this moses the man that
[1:01:17] brought us up out of the land of egypt
[1:01:20] we walk not what has become of him
[1:01:24] i want you just to note that
[1:01:29] they had been led this far by moses
[1:01:34] or seemingly by moses was it moses or
[1:01:38] was it god and moses
[1:01:41] wasn't moses strength because when moses
[1:01:44] and his strength tried to deliver them
[1:01:46] he killed one egyptian and he got run
[1:01:48] out of town
[1:01:49] so was it moses or was it god through
[1:01:51] moses
[1:01:53] see but they got their eyes on the
[1:01:55] vessel
[1:01:57] and now the vessel was absent
[1:02:00] now moses was out of sight and they got
[1:02:03] accustomed to
[1:02:04] you know when they when they when they
[1:02:06] had trouble and and pharaoh wouldn't let
[1:02:07] him go moses showed up lifted his hand
[1:02:09] said let there be flies and then flies
[1:02:11] would show up
[1:02:11] and then when again when the cycle
[1:02:13] repeated moses would show up and he said
[1:02:15] let there be frogs and there was frogs
[1:02:16] and all the plagues came
[1:02:18] and then they went out with a mighty
[1:02:19] hand and then when they got to the red
[1:02:21] sea
[1:02:21] they saw moses lift up the rod
[1:02:25] and the waters apart and they walked
[1:02:26] across on dry land i mean when they come
[1:02:28] to the
[1:02:29] bitter waters amen they saw moses
[1:02:31] throwing a stick
[1:02:33] and the waters turned sweet amen when
[1:02:35] they ran out of bread
[1:02:37] they heard they saw moses go to pray and
[1:02:39] they saw manna fall from heaven
[1:02:42] so these were carnal believers
[1:02:47] because they needed something that they
[1:02:49] could see
[1:02:51] or touch or hold on to
[1:02:55] and now when moses is out of sight
[1:02:58] amen they have no faith in the god
[1:03:02] who's led them this far their faith is
[1:03:04] only skin deep
[1:03:05] they had faith when moses was there now
[1:03:07] when moses is gone
[1:03:08] then all of a sudden they begin to
[1:03:09] wonder and waver
[1:03:12] and it tells aaron make us gods that
[1:03:15] shall go before
[1:03:16] us for as for this moses the man that
[1:03:18] brought us up out of the land of egypt
[1:03:19] we what not what has become of him
[1:03:21] and aaron said unto them break off the
[1:03:23] golden earrings which are in the ears of
[1:03:25] your wives of your sons and of your
[1:03:27] daughters
[1:03:27] and bring them unto me and all the
[1:03:30] people break off the golden earrings
[1:03:31] which were in their ears
[1:03:33] and brought them unto aaron and he
[1:03:35] received them at their hand
[1:03:36] and fashioned it with grape with a
[1:03:38] graving tool after he had made it a
[1:03:40] molten calf and
[1:03:42] they said these be thy gods o israel
[1:03:44] which brought thee
[1:03:45] up out of the land of egypt and when
[1:03:48] aaron saw it he built an altar before
[1:03:50] and aaron made a proclamation
[1:03:52] and said tomorrow is a feast to the lord
[1:03:55] that word lord is jehovah
[1:04:00] aaron is making an idol
[1:04:04] so that the people have something to
[1:04:06] worship something to see
[1:04:08] something they could lay their hands on
[1:04:10] something that they could lay in
[1:04:11] oblation
[1:04:12] before they wanted something physical
[1:04:16] and aaron made that but still believing
[1:04:18] they were going to worship
[1:04:19] jehovah
[1:04:24] and they rose up early in the morning
[1:04:25] offered burnt offerings and
[1:04:27] and brought peace offerings and the
[1:04:29] people sat down to eat
[1:04:31] to eat and to drink and rose up
[1:04:34] to play and the lord said unto moses go
[1:04:38] get thee down for thy people which
[1:04:40] thou brought us out of the land of egypt
[1:04:41] have corrupted
[1:04:43] themselves they have turned aside
[1:04:45] quickly out of the way which i command
[1:04:47] them
[1:04:48] that they have made them a molten calf
[1:04:50] and have worshiped it
[1:04:51] and have sacrificed therein too and said
[1:04:54] these be thy gods or israel which have
[1:04:56] brought thee up out of the land
[1:04:58] of egypt
[1:05:02] see as long as moses was present they
[1:05:05] had something to look at
[1:05:08] and they could have faith as long as
[1:05:10] there was a physical
[1:05:11] image something there that they could go
[1:05:13] to and
[1:05:14] what that vessel could then uh go to god
[1:05:17] and and
[1:05:18] and they could be represented through
[1:05:19] this intercessor
[1:05:23] but god's great goal was to bring this
[1:05:25] people to himself so that he would have
[1:05:26] a people that would love him
[1:05:28] and he would have people would worship
[1:05:29] him and he would have a people that
[1:05:30] would be married to him
[1:05:33] that's what god desired god was bringing
[1:05:35] them out of egypt to bring them into a
[1:05:37] personal relationship with himself
[1:05:39] that they would be a peculiar people
[1:05:40] that they would be a nation of priests
[1:05:42] that he would dwell in their midst and
[1:05:44] they would have fellowship with him
[1:05:46] god wanted their fellowship god wanted
[1:05:48] the relationship
[1:05:51] but they got so used to what they saw
[1:05:53] down in egypt
[1:05:55] that they were now bringing the
[1:05:56] perversion of egypt so
[1:05:58] quickly into the exodus journey
[1:06:02] because they had already seen this form
[1:06:04] of religion in this form of worship
[1:06:06] now they're out on their own they're
[1:06:07] moving to a promised land they're going
[1:06:09] to become a great nation
[1:06:10] the last time they were in a great
[1:06:11] nation this is what they saw so now
[1:06:13] moses isn't there but we need
[1:06:15] some form of worship we need something
[1:06:18] we need a
[1:06:18] a ritual we need something to see we
[1:06:21] need we need a church building we need a
[1:06:23] priesthood we need a
[1:06:27] so they begin to make the idol and
[1:06:29] believing that through this idol they
[1:06:31] could still have a feast to jehovah
[1:06:36] see man needs something he can
[1:06:39] manipulate
[1:06:41] something carnal something he can see
[1:06:43] something he can make something he can
[1:06:44] worship before
[1:06:45] something that that is tangible to him
[1:06:47] but god doesn't want that
[1:06:49] god wants your heart and he wants you to
[1:06:51] be connected to him
[1:06:54] you see they had been through the
[1:06:58] plagues and they seen the mighty hand of
[1:07:01] god
[1:07:02] they'd come out and spoiled egypt they
[1:07:04] had all of the spoil
[1:07:05] of war amen then they come through the
[1:07:08] red sea crossing they had the the waters
[1:07:10] turned sweet
[1:07:11] they had the manna they had all of this
[1:07:14] and and still they needed something
[1:07:18] more something
[1:07:21] that they could have confidence in
[1:07:23] something they made another
[1:07:25] form of fig leaves
[1:07:30] you say look at what you've been through
[1:07:32] look at what god's brought you through
[1:07:34] couldn't you just wait and sit still
[1:07:37] a little bit longer but they began to
[1:07:41] lust
[1:07:41] now look at the now look it looks
[1:07:44] religious it's religious on its surface
[1:07:48] they got tired of waiting on moses to
[1:07:51] come back down on the mountain
[1:07:53] they got a little bit restless and what
[1:07:55] they really
[1:07:56] wanted was to satisfy their own lusts
[1:08:01] they didn't really just want to worship
[1:08:03] jehovah
[1:08:05] they just wanted to worship
[1:08:08] because the scripture says they sat down
[1:08:12] to eat
[1:08:14] and they rose up to play
[1:08:18] they wanted to worship in a way that was
[1:08:21] gratifying
[1:08:23] to themselves
[1:08:27] they didn't want to wait for moses to
[1:08:29] come back they got a little restless
[1:08:31] and they had seen worship in egypt for
[1:08:32] how many years and how exciting was the
[1:08:34] worship in egypt and how appealing to
[1:08:36] the flesh was the worship in egypt
[1:08:40] and now in the absence of moses rather
[1:08:42] than sitting and waiting and do what he
[1:08:44] said
[1:08:45] and trust in god that brought you this
[1:08:47] far now all of a sudden they begin to
[1:08:48] get restless
[1:08:49] and they wanted they wanted to religion
[1:08:52] to appeal to the carnal senses
[1:08:56] because as soon as they made a golden
[1:08:58] calf they declared a feast
[1:09:00] and in that feast they sat down to eat
[1:09:02] and drink and they rose up to play
[1:09:04] what did they want they wanted to
[1:09:05] satisfy their flesh
[1:09:07] through religion
[1:09:10] and still be okay and still worship and
[1:09:13] still enjoy the feast
[1:09:18] see that's what's wrong with the
[1:09:19] american church
[1:09:21] it's what's wrong with the church in the
[1:09:22] world they still want to be entertained
[1:09:25] and call it religion
[1:09:26] they still want societies they still
[1:09:29] they still want to
[1:09:30] have dance routines on the platform and
[1:09:32] dress any way they want and have social
[1:09:34] affairs
[1:09:35] and have all of these things and and
[1:09:37] bring rock and roll music into the
[1:09:38] church and
[1:09:39] have a form of worship that's appealing
[1:09:41] and appetizing and they
[1:09:42] they get restless and they want to feed
[1:09:44] the flesh amen and so what do they do
[1:09:46] they make themselves a religious system
[1:09:48] an order where we can worship jehovah
[1:09:50] this way
[1:09:51] but really all they wanted to do was
[1:09:53] raise up and play
[1:09:55] what they really wanted was not to just
[1:09:57] sit there and wait for moses to come
[1:09:59] back and tell us what god wants
[1:10:00] we want to have worship because there's
[1:10:02] a craving in the heart of man worship
[1:10:04] but man wants to worship according to
[1:10:06] his own desire
[1:10:07] and his own fleshly lusts
[1:10:10] cain wanted to worship god abel wanted
[1:10:13] to worship god
[1:10:14] abel wanted to worship god the way god
[1:10:16] wanted to be worshipped
[1:10:18] so he waited for a revelation on what
[1:10:21] was acceptable and he realized
[1:10:23] that blood is the covering that god
[1:10:25] wants and he offered blood by
[1:10:26] faith but when cain wanted to worship he
[1:10:30] had a desire to worship and wanted to
[1:10:32] worship god
[1:10:33] he worshiped god according to his own
[1:10:35] desires what he thought was wise
[1:10:37] what he thought was beautiful what he
[1:10:39] thought was an acceptable offering
[1:10:42] and he labored and he worked and he
[1:10:44] toiled and he brought of the fruit of
[1:10:46] the field to the labor of his hands and
[1:10:47] he brought something beautiful he
[1:10:49] brought something enticing
[1:10:50] and when he offered it he liked the
[1:10:53] offering
[1:10:57] he enjoyed the offering
[1:11:02] do you think abel enjoyed his offering
[1:11:07] taking the choicest lamb
[1:11:11] of his flock the very
[1:11:14] best he cared for he protected
[1:11:18] he was probably there when it was born
[1:11:21] he may have assisted in the birth
[1:11:25] he took the choicest of what he had
[1:11:30] and he had to lay it down and put his
[1:11:31] knee upon it and take a sharp rock and
[1:11:33] hack its throat
[1:11:36] because he caught a revelation that god
[1:11:38] will take a substitute
[1:11:40] an innocent substitute for my sin
[1:11:45] it wasn't that abel wasn't satisfied
[1:11:48] after he worshipped that he had done
[1:11:49] what god told him
[1:11:50] it wasn't that there wasn't satisfaction
[1:11:54] but the question is who enjoyed their
[1:11:57] worship most
[1:12:01] one was worshiping a living god
[1:12:03] according to what god desired
[1:12:06] the other was worshiping a living god
[1:12:07] according to what
[1:12:09] the worshiper decided
[1:12:12] and the question is to give god proper
[1:12:14] worship do you worship according the way
[1:12:16] the worshiper wants to desire
[1:12:18] or do you worship according to the way
[1:12:19] the worship he wants to be
[1:12:22] worshipped
[1:12:25] this is where the devil cunningly gets
[1:12:26] into religion
[1:12:28] and he begins to satisfy hungers and
[1:12:31] cravings and desires
[1:12:32] because man has a desire to worship he
[1:12:36] has a craving to worship he was made to
[1:12:38] worship
[1:12:38] and the devil will get in here and begin
[1:12:40] to pollute worship
[1:12:41] amen and he'll begin to change it to a
[1:12:43] worship that becomes satisfying and
[1:12:45] appealing to the flesh
[1:12:48] and when he mixes the worship of god
[1:12:51] with carnal satisfaction he's got a
[1:12:54] program that will win
[1:12:56] millions you can build mega churches
[1:13:00] on this platform is that what they've
[1:13:03] done
[1:13:05] you can build mega churches on the
[1:13:06] platform of mixing a man's craving to
[1:13:09] worship a true god
[1:13:10] with the lust and desires of man to
[1:13:12] worship according to his own heart's
[1:13:14] desire
[1:13:16] and if you mix those two things together
[1:13:18] you have a recipe for success
[1:13:20] that they have written books about
[1:13:23] and begin to propagate
[1:13:33] why would they leave what god was
[1:13:36] bringing them to
[1:13:38] why would they go back to idolatry
[1:13:42] god was rescuing them out of an
[1:13:44] idolatrous nation
[1:13:46] he was bringing them into their own land
[1:13:48] why would they bring this perversion
[1:13:50] with them
[1:13:50] when they had a pillar of fire they had
[1:13:53] a they had a pillar of fire they could
[1:13:55] see leading the camp
[1:13:56] they had a cloud they had the pillar of
[1:13:58] fire that would come and stand between
[1:13:59] them
[1:14:00] and the egyptians they had a way of dry
[1:14:03] ground through
[1:14:04] through the red sea why why would they
[1:14:07] bring that old idolatry and bring it
[1:14:08] into this system
[1:14:10] it's because they wanted it
[1:14:16] remember
[1:14:20] you're enticed when you're drawn away
[1:14:24] by your own lusts it's what james tells
[1:14:27] us
[1:14:28] let's go to numbers 22.
[1:14:42] numbers 22
[1:14:48] and verse 1.
[1:14:53] and the children of israel set forward
[1:14:56] and pitched in the plains of moab on
[1:14:58] this side jordan by jericho
[1:15:00] and balak the son of zappor saw all that
[1:15:04] israel had done to the amorites
[1:15:06] and balak the son of support saw that
[1:15:08] israel done for the amorites and moab
[1:15:10] was so afraid of the people
[1:15:12] because they were many and moab was
[1:15:14] distressed because of the children of
[1:15:15] israel
[1:15:16] and moab said unto the elders of midian
[1:15:19] now
[1:15:19] shall this company lick up all that are
[1:15:21] round about us as the ox looketh up the
[1:15:23] grass
[1:15:24] of the field and balak the son of zippor
[1:15:26] was
[1:15:27] king of the moabites at that time he
[1:15:30] sent
[1:15:30] messengers therefore into balaam the son
[1:15:32] of beor to pethor
[1:15:34] which is by the river of the land of the
[1:15:36] children of his people to call him
[1:15:38] saying behold there is a people come out
[1:15:41] from egypt behold they cover the face of
[1:15:43] the earth
[1:15:44] and they abide over against me come now
[1:15:46] therefore i pray thee
[1:15:48] curse me this people for they are too
[1:15:50] mighty for me
[1:15:51] per adventure i shall prevail that we
[1:15:54] may smite them and that i may drive them
[1:15:56] out of the lamb
[1:15:56] for i walk that he whom thou blesses is
[1:15:59] blessed and he whom now curses
[1:16:01] is cursed we know this story quite well
[1:16:06] as they're marching in the in the exodus
[1:16:08] journey going to the promised land they
[1:16:10] they come up against moab and now balak
[1:16:12] the king of the moabites he becomes
[1:16:14] nervous and he doesn't want to give them
[1:16:15] passage through
[1:16:16] he's afraid because they wiped out the
[1:16:18] amorites he's afraid
[1:16:20] he's going to be wiped out so he's going
[1:16:21] to go sin for a prophet of god
[1:16:23] and he's going to ask this prophet of
[1:16:24] god to come down and curse this people
[1:16:26] because he knows
[1:16:27] that he's a prophet and if he what he
[1:16:29] curses will be cursed and when he
[1:16:30] blesses will be blessed
[1:16:33] and so he sends down and we know the
[1:16:34] story we're not going to go into that
[1:16:36] but
[1:16:36] he goes the first time he's refused god
[1:16:38] told him not to goes the second time
[1:16:40] god told him to go but that wasn't the
[1:16:42] original plan of god
[1:16:44] and he goes down and three times he
[1:16:46] tries to curse israel
[1:16:48] three times they offer seven bullocks
[1:16:51] and seven rams on seven altars
[1:16:55] brother bam said showing that
[1:16:56] fundamentally
[1:16:58] they had the fundamentals of the faith
[1:17:02] moab was a church like israel was a
[1:17:05] church
[1:17:06] the moabs had seven clean offerings
[1:17:10] seven rams seven bulldogs speaking of
[1:17:13] the coming of christ
[1:17:15] they had a prophet who could genuinely
[1:17:17] hear from god
[1:17:19] they had a church they had a church the
[1:17:22] church of the israelites
[1:17:24] had moses a prophet the church of the
[1:17:26] moabites had balaam a prophet
[1:17:29] they had altars they had burnt offerings
[1:17:32] they had worship
[1:17:36] now this church was afraid of that
[1:17:42] church
[1:17:45] why did cain kill abel
[1:17:48] because abel was a threat to cain's fig
[1:17:51] leaf
[1:17:51] religion there was a reason you don't
[1:17:54] kill somebody
[1:17:56] unless they're a threat to you somehow
[1:17:59] why did cain kill abel because his deeds
[1:18:02] were evil
[1:18:04] is what the bible says
[1:18:08] this church was afraid of that church so
[1:18:12] balak calls up balaam says curse them
[1:18:14] and they have the three times
[1:18:15] seven bullocks seven rams from seven
[1:18:17] altars fundamentally brother better said
[1:18:20] they were correct
[1:18:22] quoting scriptures having services
[1:18:29] and three times he failed to curse them
[1:18:32] because he could only say what god put
[1:18:33] in his mouth and every time
[1:18:35] the curse turned into a blessing
[1:18:38] and so balaam the prophet was forbidden
[1:18:41] by god to lay a curse upon what god had
[1:18:44] blessed
[1:18:48] so there's fear the moabites
[1:18:51] fear the israelites this is the church
[1:18:53] of the called out
[1:18:54] amen with the prophet for their age
[1:18:56] following the word for their day
[1:18:57] the moabites here have a perverted word
[1:19:02] and they're afraid of this nation that
[1:19:05] god's in
[1:19:08] and now they have to come up with a plan
[1:19:12] balak gets angry at balaam and he says
[1:19:14] these three times now
[1:19:16] i called you to curse my enemies these
[1:19:17] three times you have blessed them and
[1:19:19] not cursed them
[1:19:20] the whole plan was failing because you
[1:19:22] cannot curse what god has blessed
[1:19:27] but let's go to numbers 25. i want to
[1:19:30] read a couple scriptures that will
[1:19:31] explain something here
[1:19:33] numbers 25.
[1:19:37] verse 1 and israel bowed and him
[1:19:40] and the people began to commit whoredom
[1:19:42] with the daughters of moab
[1:19:46] and they called the people into the
[1:19:47] sacrifices of their gods
[1:19:49] and the people did eat and bowed down to
[1:19:51] their gods and
[1:19:52] israel joined himself and developed peor
[1:19:55] and the anger of the lord was
[1:19:56] kindled against israel
[1:19:59] now there's three attempts at cursing
[1:20:02] three failed attempts and instead of a
[1:20:04] cursing comes a blessing
[1:20:05] bailey gets angry at balaam but balaam
[1:20:08] has another approach
[1:20:11] the direct approach of attacking and
[1:20:13] cursing
[1:20:15] is not working so they're going to try
[1:20:19] another approach
[1:20:20] let's look down at verse 16. same
[1:20:22] chapter 25 16
[1:20:24] and the lord spake unto moses saying vex
[1:20:26] the midianites and smite them
[1:20:28] for they vex you with their wiles their
[1:20:30] craftiness
[1:20:32] and they were coming there was something
[1:20:34] sneaky
[1:20:35] and crafty and wily about what they were
[1:20:38] doing
[1:20:39] it wasn't as straightforward as it
[1:20:41] appeared
[1:20:44] where they vex you with their wiles
[1:20:45] therefore they have beguiled you
[1:20:47] that's deceived seduced beguiled you in
[1:20:51] the matter of peor
[1:20:52] and in the matter of cosby the daughter
[1:20:54] of the prince of the
[1:20:55] midian their sister which was slain in
[1:20:58] the day of the plague
[1:20:59] for peor's sake now let's go over
[1:21:03] the numbers 31
[1:21:11] and verse 15.
[1:21:15] and moses said unto them have you saved
[1:21:17] all the women alive they went out to
[1:21:18] destroy
[1:21:20] the midianites and they saved the women
[1:21:22] alive moses and then have you saved all
[1:21:24] the women alive
[1:21:25] behold these caused the children of
[1:21:27] israel through the council of balaam
[1:21:31] to commit trespass against the lord in
[1:21:33] the matter of peor
[1:21:35] and there was a plague among the
[1:21:37] congregation of the lord
[1:21:40] now all of a sudden moses is saying
[1:21:42] there's been a council
[1:21:45] the cursing failed but the council will
[1:21:47] work
[1:21:49] and balaam began to counsel balak and
[1:21:52] counsel the moabites and the midianites
[1:21:54] on how they might accomplish their task
[1:21:57] a different way
[1:21:58] because trying to just curse them was
[1:22:00] not going to work try to just come
[1:22:02] against them openly was not going to
[1:22:04] work but there's a council they've been
[1:22:05] taking
[1:22:06] and it causes them to be wily
[1:22:10] in their approach in revelations 2 14
[1:22:14] in the pergamus church age he says but a
[1:22:17] few things i have against thee because
[1:22:19] thou has their
[1:22:20] them that hold the doctrine of balaam
[1:22:24] what is doctrine teaching so now there's
[1:22:26] a teaching
[1:22:28] of balaam what is that his counsel
[1:22:31] now the doctrine of balaam who taught
[1:22:33] balak to cast a stumbling block before
[1:22:36] the children of israel
[1:22:37] to eat things sacrificed to idols and to
[1:22:40] commit fornication
[1:22:42] here's what the prophet of god says
[1:22:44] about this whole thing
[1:22:47] in the pergamian church he says now what
[1:22:49] did balaam do when he found out that he
[1:22:51] couldn't
[1:22:51] that he couldn't curse israel he told
[1:22:53] balak it would be a good idea then for
[1:22:55] him to invite these people
[1:22:58] to the festival of the gods they had a
[1:23:00] great festival up there
[1:23:01] where they were going to have the
[1:23:03] festival called the feast of baal pior
[1:23:06] it was a feast to worship and balaam
[1:23:09] said now i'll
[1:23:10] i'll tell you balak i'll give you a good
[1:23:12] idea
[1:23:13] if you god won't curse them that's all
[1:23:15] there is to it so
[1:23:16] i'll tell you what we'll do we want we
[1:23:19] can't get rid of them
[1:23:21] but if you'll just invite them over
[1:23:23] you'll swing the whole thing your way
[1:23:26] so exactly exactly what constantine did
[1:23:30] perfectly that's the reason the doctrine
[1:23:32] of balaam what did they do
[1:23:34] balak's teaching came down amongst
[1:23:36] israel and they invited all the
[1:23:37] israelites up to this big feast the big
[1:23:39] blowout they had
[1:23:40] oh some big party shindig of something
[1:23:43] up there they had
[1:23:44] and when they got up there why these
[1:23:46] israelite people begin to see
[1:23:48] these pretty sexy dressed moabite women
[1:23:50] yes
[1:23:51] wasn't like they're common girls down
[1:23:54] there
[1:23:56] now he's using beauty
[1:23:59] and wisdom and craftiness to entice them
[1:24:02] they were beautiful moabitus they were
[1:24:05] attracted to something other than what
[1:24:07] god gave them
[1:24:10] what god gave them may have been common
[1:24:12] in the eyes of man
[1:24:13] amen but it was beautiful in the eyes of
[1:24:15] god if it had the character of god in it
[1:24:20] and now he begins to entice them oh they
[1:24:23] look so pretty
[1:24:24] my how they were made and oh how they
[1:24:26] could show themselves and they fell for
[1:24:28] it and began to commit adultery and
[1:24:30] balaam knowed if god wouldn't curse them
[1:24:32] he'd take them over on this
[1:24:33] denominational side
[1:24:36] and cause the anger of god to kill them
[1:24:38] anyhow
[1:24:40] let god kill them himself if he could
[1:24:42] ever get them out of the way
[1:24:44] of the truth and we know that's exactly
[1:24:45] what happened when they begin to go up
[1:24:47] to the feast of beopeora and commit
[1:24:48] whoredoms with them amen god allowed a
[1:24:50] plague to come and that plague began to
[1:24:52] kill
[1:24:53] thousands of them
[1:24:56] why because they brought a corruption on
[1:24:58] themselves because god wanted this
[1:24:59] nation to stay
[1:25:00] isolated and separated to him alone and
[1:25:03] now they begin to mix with another
[1:25:05] religion
[1:25:06] bringing in what we're a church you're a
[1:25:08] church the moabites came
[1:25:10] amen from lot lot laid with his oldest
[1:25:12] daughter
[1:25:13] she had she had moab moab was a cousin
[1:25:16] to them
[1:25:18] they were related
[1:25:22] they they believed in jehovah
[1:25:26] they got that from lot
[1:25:30] they were fundamental but when they
[1:25:32] began to mix themselves together
[1:25:35] that's when god began to bring a
[1:25:36] punishment he says i'm not going to have
[1:25:38] that mixing
[1:25:39] god hates that mixing in 1965
[1:25:44] and god does does god ever change his
[1:25:46] mind about his word he said there
[1:25:47] we find out that balaam went down there
[1:25:49] and he began to teach the people and he
[1:25:51] had an
[1:25:52] error and he run the way of balaam how
[1:25:54] they
[1:25:55] that he did and taught balak and the
[1:25:57] children of israel committed adultery
[1:25:59] and a plague struck the nation of israel
[1:26:01] and people and thousands of them died in
[1:26:02] one day
[1:26:04] and while they were all there before the
[1:26:05] altar of god praying here come an
[1:26:07] israelite man with a midianite woman
[1:26:09] a denominational woman and went into the
[1:26:11] tent and the priest's son walked over
[1:26:13] there
[1:26:14] and took a javelin and killed them both
[1:26:15] and that stayed god's wrath
[1:26:19] you know that scripture is that right
[1:26:24] everything that was natural to israel
[1:26:26] spiritual to the church
[1:26:30] god hates that fornication with those
[1:26:33] denominational spirits
[1:26:36] he hates the mixing of the pure word
[1:26:38] with man's idea about the word
[1:26:41] we're christian they're christian we're
[1:26:43] all the same
[1:26:45] it's not the same moab and israelites
[1:26:47] were not the same
[1:26:48] god was calling a nation out of a nation
[1:26:50] to separate him to himself
[1:26:51] and he was revealing himself to them
[1:26:54] amen and there was a perversion form of
[1:26:56] jehovah worship over here
[1:26:58] mixed with idolatry and they were
[1:26:59] wanting to blend the thing together
[1:27:02] it's exactly what's happening in this
[1:27:04] day and that's the way constantine found
[1:27:06] to trip up the christians amen couldn't
[1:27:08] curse them tried to kill them amen
[1:27:11] and then just kept growing their faith
[1:27:12] kept growing tried to kill them out
[1:27:14] tried to torture him in coliseums so
[1:27:16] what did constantine try to do he
[1:27:18] decided just to mix them in with the
[1:27:20] pagan religion of rome
[1:27:24] and his plan was successful
[1:27:32] he said
[1:27:36] but what happened balaam he succeeded in
[1:27:38] weakening israel
[1:27:41] what was the strength of israel their
[1:27:44] separation
[1:27:47] what was the strength of samson
[1:27:50] his nazirite vow what is the nazarite
[1:27:52] vow it's a vow of separation
[1:27:54] separation unto god but when he cut the
[1:27:57] locks of his vow
[1:27:58] he lost his strength what was the
[1:28:01] strength of israel there's separation
[1:28:03] from all other nations
[1:28:05] what is the strength of his bride church
[1:28:07] today her separation from all
[1:28:12] denominations
[1:28:14] denominations are man-made not god-made
[1:28:17] the word is god's plan and the
[1:28:19] revelation on the word is god's plan
[1:28:28] he let them weaken their camp and
[1:28:31] polluted the whole camp
[1:28:32] and when some doctrine starts it's not
[1:28:34] the bible truth it pollutes the whole
[1:28:36] camp
[1:28:36] somebody raise up with a different idea
[1:28:38] like cora and say well this that and the
[1:28:40] other and i got a different idea it
[1:28:42] pollutes the whole camp
[1:28:43] and that's what's done the whole church
[1:28:45] camp today
[1:28:46] teaching as he did weakening the whole
[1:28:48] camp for kadish barnia
[1:28:50] the word showdown when they got to
[1:28:52] katie's barnea then the weakening of the
[1:28:54] camp they came back
[1:28:55] they had went right after remember they
[1:28:57] had eaten angels food
[1:28:59] they had the word of god every night
[1:29:01] made manifest
[1:29:02] that they eat food they drank from the
[1:29:04] rock they did all seen the miracles they
[1:29:06] watched moses
[1:29:07] and seen his words seen as prophecies
[1:29:09] everything and then finally
[1:29:11] when they listen to this false teacher
[1:29:12] come in among them and teach wrong
[1:29:14] he weakened the camp and prospered by it
[1:29:18] you have to understand when what did
[1:29:21] these israelites have
[1:29:22] that went up to the feast of bail pior
[1:29:24] what did they have what did they lack
[1:29:26] what did they need
[1:29:27] they had everything god had provided
[1:29:29] food in the wilderness he provided water
[1:29:31] when they needed it
[1:29:32] he gave them protection what did they
[1:29:35] need
[1:29:36] they had no need they were just as
[1:29:38] secure
[1:29:39] as eve was in the garden of eden
[1:29:43] they were under god's leadership they
[1:29:45] were under his divine protection
[1:29:47] they had a prophet in their midst amen
[1:29:48] they had a pillar of fire
[1:29:50] they had manna that fell every morning
[1:29:53] they had a smitten rock that was
[1:29:54] producing water
[1:29:56] they had quail that would even show up
[1:29:58] amen they even had
[1:29:59] when when they even when they began to
[1:30:01] murmur and they were bitten by the fiery
[1:30:03] serpents
[1:30:04] god even gave them an atonement he even
[1:30:06] gave them a serpent on the pole that
[1:30:07] they could look to and be healed
[1:30:10] they had divine healing they had
[1:30:11] supernatural provision they had
[1:30:13] supernatural protection
[1:30:14] they had supernatural leadership
[1:30:17] what did they need they didn't need
[1:30:20] anything
[1:30:21] why did they go to the feast of baal
[1:30:23] pior what was lacking in the camp of
[1:30:25] israel
[1:30:26] i tell you nothing was lacking in the
[1:30:28] camp of israel
[1:30:29] nothing was lacking in eden
[1:30:34] god was not lacking he was not holding
[1:30:38] anything back from his children in eden
[1:30:39] and god was not slack
[1:30:41] in providing everything that the
[1:30:42] israelites needed in the exodus journey
[1:30:45] they had everything what would move them
[1:30:49] there must have been another attraction
[1:30:52] that was greater than the attraction in
[1:30:54] the camp of israel
[1:30:56] the only way to get you to leave
[1:30:58] something that's good
[1:30:59] is if you find something that's better
[1:31:08] there was something in them
[1:31:11] that liked what they saw
[1:31:15] there was something in them that craved
[1:31:17] that kind of
[1:31:19] worship
[1:31:23] that they would leave everything
[1:31:27] to go and take corruption
[1:31:31] to satisfy the wants of their own flesh
[1:31:37] it's a sad story
[1:31:40] but the story continues today
[1:31:45] let's go to second timothy
[1:31:55] ii timothy
[1:31:58] verse four
[1:32:04] second timothy verse four and or chapter
[1:32:07] four i'm sorry
[1:32:08] chapter four
[1:32:13] let's read verse 9.
[1:32:17] this is paul writing he said do thy
[1:32:18] diligence that comes shortly to me
[1:32:21] for demeth has forsaken me having loved
[1:32:24] this
[1:32:24] present world
[1:32:27] demas left the apostle
[1:32:32] of the age he left the light to the
[1:32:35] gentiles the prophecy from isaiah
[1:32:38] he left the man with the revelation of
[1:32:40] the word he left the man
[1:32:42] who would write the new testament he
[1:32:45] left the man
[1:32:45] who was taking law and now he's bringing
[1:32:48] it into grace and he was showing through
[1:32:50] the old testament christ
[1:32:52] you had a man the messenger of the age
[1:32:54] the man who was breaking down the word
[1:32:56] what what was there in paul's ministry
[1:32:59] that was lacking
[1:33:01] what was there lacking in the word that
[1:33:03] paul was bringing
[1:33:04] amen paul was bringing a true revelation
[1:33:06] of the true god
[1:33:07] and god would use paul to write the
[1:33:10] almost the entire new testament
[1:33:12] amen what was it demas could not hang
[1:33:15] with paul anymore
[1:33:16] not because there was a lack in paul but
[1:33:18] he left paul because he loved this
[1:33:20] present world there was something
[1:33:24] enticing and the prophet of god said
[1:33:26] demas never stopped being religious
[1:33:28] he was just as religious as he always
[1:33:30] was
[1:33:33] but he wanted he wanted to satisfy the
[1:33:35] flesh
[1:33:36] and worship god at the same time
[1:33:43] brother brahm said in the god of this
[1:33:45] evil age the children of obedience and
[1:33:46] disobedience has nothing in common
[1:33:49] the disobedience worship their god they
[1:33:51] say we believe
[1:33:52] yes it's a mixed tree they add the word
[1:33:55] and the knowledge to it satan's tree mix
[1:33:57] see she took from satan's tree good and
[1:34:00] evil
[1:34:00] oh we believe the word sure but not all
[1:34:03] of it
[1:34:04] eve believed the word too let satan take
[1:34:07] his tree and pervert it a little bit
[1:34:08] that's what it is
[1:34:10] whosoever shall have one word or take
[1:34:11] one word from him he is still the same
[1:34:14] yesterday today and forever
[1:34:15] notice all right this evil age is of
[1:34:18] darkness yet belongs to church
[1:34:21] do you believe that this evil age is
[1:34:24] full of darkness yet
[1:34:25] belongs to church and see that belonging
[1:34:28] to church becomes the covering
[1:34:31] i belong to church i believe in god
[1:34:34] but it's not believing in god that
[1:34:37] brings salvation because the devils
[1:34:39] believe in god and tremble
[1:34:41] but it's believing god
[1:34:45] the whole world believes in god the
[1:34:47] devils believe in god
[1:34:49] but there's got to be a people that
[1:34:51] believe god and when god speaks they
[1:34:53] believe it
[1:34:53] when god reveals they receive it there's
[1:34:55] got to be people not just believing in
[1:34:58] god
[1:34:58] but believe god that's what the heroes
[1:35:01] in
[1:35:02] in hebrews chapter 11 all had that was
[1:35:05] different than the rest of the world in
[1:35:06] their day
[1:35:07] amen the rest of the world in their day
[1:35:09] believed in god
[1:35:11] in abraham's day they believed in god in
[1:35:12] noah's day they believed in god and
[1:35:14] daniel's day they believed in god
[1:35:18] is that true but daniel believed god
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:22] abraham believed god noah believed god
[1:35:24] what god
[1:35:25] said in that day for salvation noah
[1:35:27] accepted it and he acted upon it
[1:35:31] the whole world believes in god but you
[1:35:33] have to believe
[1:35:34] god and god is the word he and the word
[1:35:37] are the same thing the word came out
[1:35:39] from god
[1:35:40] it's a part of god it's god expressed
[1:35:44] the word of god is not something that we
[1:35:46] just mix and match with our own thinking
[1:35:48] for our own lustful desires to worship
[1:35:49] any way we want
[1:35:50] it's something that that reflects the
[1:35:53] very character of god
[1:35:54] and if we love god we love his word if
[1:35:57] we love his word we love him
[1:36:00] this evil age is of darkness yet belongs
[1:36:03] to church their god they love him for it
[1:36:05] they
[1:36:05] the way he lets them do they have no
[1:36:07] condemnation nothing bothers them as
[1:36:09] long as they belong to church
[1:36:11] balaam taught the church the same thing
[1:36:13] let us unite we're all the same
[1:36:15] it was the last trick god never forgave
[1:36:18] them for believing such a lie
[1:36:23] brother branham he has a vision or a
[1:36:25] dream and he's in
[1:36:27] in this dream and he's going to see the
[1:36:28] preview of the bride
[1:36:31] so familiar with this but but he sees
[1:36:33] the first new testament church coming
[1:36:35] through the fresh church out of
[1:36:36] pentecost he watches them move through
[1:36:38] all clean and all marching in step and
[1:36:41] they they go off
[1:36:42] then he sees the worldly laodicean
[1:36:44] church moving through and he said oh
[1:36:46] they were vulgar and dirty and hardly
[1:36:48] had any clothes on at all
[1:36:49] and twisting to rock and roll music
[1:36:53] and they went off into oblivion they
[1:36:54] began to fall down into the abyss
[1:36:57] and he was he was heartbroken because he
[1:37:00] thought of all the labor of all the
[1:37:01] preaching
[1:37:02] of all i've done that's the church that
[1:37:03] i have to present to you lord
[1:37:07] and then he began to hear marching
[1:37:10] and a beat and onward christian
[1:37:13] soldiers and soon he saw another bride
[1:37:18] coming by that was just like
[1:37:20] the first one marching in step to time
[1:37:24] to the word
[1:37:27] but right in the back at the end right
[1:37:29] at the tail end
[1:37:32] this church was getting out of step
[1:37:34] getting out of line
[1:37:36] because as they were walking through
[1:37:38] they were supposed to be living at the
[1:37:39] review stand
[1:37:41] and on the review stand was the angel of
[1:37:43] the lord and the prophet of god
[1:37:46] and their eyes were supposed to be fixed
[1:37:47] where the angel of the lord was
[1:37:49] and working through a prophet of god but
[1:37:52] they got their eyes off and began to
[1:37:53] look at the worldly church
[1:37:55] that was undressed marching the time of
[1:37:57] rock and roll music moving off into the
[1:37:58] abyss
[1:37:59] and as they began to focus on that and
[1:38:00] get their focus off the review stand
[1:38:04] they begin to misstep and they begin to
[1:38:06] get off course and brother benham wakes
[1:38:08] up screaming get back in line
[1:38:10] get back in line amen because he's going
[1:38:13] to have a bride
[1:38:14] without spot or wrinkle she's going to
[1:38:17] be washed by the water of the word
[1:38:19] and this pure word is going to wash away
[1:38:21] all the ideas of man
[1:38:23] all the fallacy of religion all the
[1:38:25] foolishness of denominationalism
[1:38:29] there's over 40 000 denominations in the
[1:38:31] world
[1:38:34] are they all right are they all wrong is
[1:38:37] some right some wrong
[1:38:38] who decides who's right who's wrong
[1:38:43] who has the authority to pass the
[1:38:44] judgment on which one's right and which
[1:38:46] one's wrong
[1:38:48] it's all man-made god sent a prophet in
[1:38:52] this day
[1:38:53] to pull us out of that nonsense
[1:38:56] and bring us back to the word
[1:39:02] and the devil's so slick
[1:39:05] that he tries to get the very bride that
[1:39:07] he's pulled out and got her marching
[1:39:09] with the word
[1:39:10] trying to get her to interested in what
[1:39:12] the worldly church is doing
[1:39:17] what's that music they're listening to
[1:39:22] there's something about it i kind of
[1:39:24] like
[1:39:29] keep focusing and all sudden
[1:39:33] that i like that dress it's kind of cute
[1:39:38] they're christians i'm christians
[1:39:40] they're believers i'm a believer
[1:39:44] how did the israelites walk
[1:39:47] out of the camp of israel with a
[1:39:51] tabernacle and a pillar of fire how did
[1:39:54] they walk out of their tent that morning
[1:39:56] and gather up an overfull of manna and
[1:39:58] go inside and eat it
[1:40:00] and think you know what i think i'm
[1:40:02] going to go up to that feast of baal
[1:40:03] pure
[1:40:07] how how could they do such a thing
[1:40:10] they begin to watch the moabites and
[1:40:12] they begin to watch the millions
[1:40:14] until something inside of them a lust a
[1:40:17] craving for that kind of worship
[1:40:19] was awakened and they left what was pure
[1:40:22] and good and clean
[1:40:23] and under god and they began to go to
[1:40:25] worship in a way that was appealing to
[1:40:27] the flesh
[1:40:32] i say god scream out in this day get
[1:40:34] back in step
[1:40:36] get back and step to the word forget
[1:40:38] what the worldly church is doing
[1:40:40] forget what the denominations are doing
[1:40:42] there's a camp here there's a king in
[1:40:44] the camp
[1:40:44] a shout of the king is in the camp the
[1:40:46] atonement is here
[1:40:47] the pure food from heaven is here the
[1:40:49] pure water from the rock of christ is
[1:40:51] here
[1:40:52] everything that you need is here there's
[1:40:54] no reason to leave this camp of the
[1:40:56] message
[1:40:58] there's no reason to get wondering and
[1:41:00] curious about what they're doing and
[1:41:02] they're doing this and well they're
[1:41:03] cousins to us
[1:41:04] if they can do it i can do it it doesn't
[1:41:06] matter what anybody else is doing
[1:41:08] amen you keep your eye on the review
[1:41:10] stand where that a that pillar of fire
[1:41:12] was
[1:41:13] present with that prophet
[1:41:18] that's how they marched in step
[1:41:22] remember the first church when pro when
[1:41:25] brother benham saw in that dream when he
[1:41:27] saw that
[1:41:28] original church come by those original
[1:41:30] little ladies from pentecost
[1:41:32] none of them looked away from that
[1:41:33] review stand
[1:41:37] let that be an example for us today
[1:41:39] friends
[1:41:41] look to the review stand
[1:41:44] don't take your own idea and own
[1:41:46] reasoning
[1:41:50] as soon as you begin to look at the
[1:41:53] worldly church
[1:41:54] and say well all of a sudden reasoning
[1:41:57] starts to kick in
[1:42:02] is it really that bad i mean what's bad
[1:42:04] about it
[1:42:06] what makes it bad i know brother branham
[1:42:08] said but i don't really
[1:42:09] i don't really see that in the
[1:42:12] scriptures
[1:42:15] just because you don't see in the
[1:42:16] scriptures don't mean it's not in the
[1:42:17] scriptures
[1:42:20] the prophet of god is always preaching
[1:42:22] the scriptures
[1:42:24] always preaching the scriptures he may
[1:42:27] not quote the verse
[1:42:28] but you be diligent you'll find it
[1:42:30] because it's in the bible
[1:42:32] this message is the word of god restored
[1:42:35] back to the church in the end time man
[1:42:38] ruined it the catholic church took the
[1:42:40] bibles from the people amen
[1:42:41] they stripped them down and didn't let
[1:42:43] them have the word of god but god
[1:42:45] was faithful through luther's age he
[1:42:46] began to restore and bring the word back
[1:42:48] and what is god's goal been he's trying
[1:42:50] to bring an exodus out of
[1:42:52] denominationalism and bring people
[1:42:53] back to the camp of himself amen so that
[1:42:56] he can reveal himself
[1:42:57] to his bride and so that he can be
[1:42:59] unified with her and they will be
[1:43:01] unified with him
[1:43:02] and him only and not mix it with
[1:43:06] ideas of man and concepts by groups of
[1:43:09] men
[1:43:10] and theological seminaries and
[1:43:12] understandings and all of that
[1:43:13] i tell you
[1:43:17] i think it's shameful to be in the camp
[1:43:21] of israel that day
[1:43:24] to wake up and eat the manna stretch
[1:43:27] and see the cloud over the tabernacle
[1:43:32] and ask your neighbor what are the
[1:43:34] moabites doing
[1:43:36] did you hear about this feast of baal
[1:43:38] pure what'd you hear
[1:43:40] well i heard this and i heard they do
[1:43:41] this and i heard they had that
[1:43:43] yeah i mean that's that can't be all
[1:43:44] that bad what do you think
[1:43:47] i don't know i i mean they're worshiping
[1:43:50] jehovah we worship jehovah
[1:43:54] when they close in prayer they say jesus
[1:43:56] christ
[1:43:59] and hate his word and rebel against his
[1:44:04] commandments
[1:44:08] well you know they say they believe but
[1:44:11] do
[1:44:11] contrary to what the prophet taught us
[1:44:17] i said let's wake up in the morning and
[1:44:20] eat some manna
[1:44:23] and look out at the pillar of fire and
[1:44:25] say thank you god
[1:44:27] this is all i want i want nothing more
[1:44:31] than your word i want nothing more than
[1:44:32] the
[1:44:33] revealed word i want all that you have
[1:44:35] for me
[1:44:36] i don't want my own idea i don't want my
[1:44:38] own desire i don't want to worship just
[1:44:40] in a way that feels good to me
[1:44:42] god i want to bring you a worship that
[1:44:43] you desire i want to bring you a worship
[1:44:45] that's pleasing to you
[1:44:46] i want to bring you a worship that
[1:44:48] matches every word in this book that
[1:44:50] you've given me
[1:44:54] god did not restore this bible back to
[1:44:57] his church for us to reject half of
[1:44:59] what's in there
[1:44:59] he restored it to us and he sent a
[1:45:01] prophet in this day to prove that it's
[1:45:02] still true
[1:45:03] it's still applicable and the revelation
[1:45:05] of today will still keep you
[1:45:07] and he went through great extents to
[1:45:08] bring us a bible and bring us a prophet
[1:45:10] with vindication that will bring us back
[1:45:12] to the right interpretation of this word
[1:45:15] not so that we could wonder what the
[1:45:16] moabites are doing and look at the
[1:45:17] church going off in oblivion and be like
[1:45:19] i don't know that may not be so bad
[1:45:21] he wants us to wake up every morning and
[1:45:23] say i am so satisfied
[1:45:25] i am so thankful this is the only thing
[1:45:27] i've ever wanted all my life i just
[1:45:29] wanted god
[1:45:31] from the time i was a child i can
[1:45:33] testify to you from the time i was a
[1:45:35] little boy
[1:45:35] the only thing i wanted was god i never
[1:45:39] wanted a church
[1:45:40] i never wanted a religion i wanted god
[1:45:42] but i didn't know what it was
[1:45:45] so i thought i had to go to church and
[1:45:47] find him and i thought i had to believe
[1:45:48] like my parents to find him and i
[1:45:49] thought i had to do what the preacher
[1:45:50] said to find him
[1:45:54] but god planted a seed down inside of me
[1:45:58] and that seed wanted him and him only i
[1:46:01] didn't want anything mixed with it i
[1:46:03] didn't want a hybridization by man
[1:46:05] i didn't want anything that even come up
[1:46:07] from my own thinking
[1:46:08] all i wanted was god
[1:46:14] and if all you want is god well i got
[1:46:17] good news
[1:46:19] this is the unveiling of god this is the
[1:46:22] revealing of his plan in the last day
[1:46:25] this is the revealing of the mystery of
[1:46:27] god
[1:46:29] why do we as believers want to even look
[1:46:33] at what
[1:46:35] someone else is doing
[1:46:38] we should be so consumed
[1:46:41] with the manna
[1:46:44] so consumed with the sweet water
[1:46:50] so attracted to the pillar of fire
[1:46:54] that there's no other attraction
[1:46:57] see when you're attracted to the word
[1:47:00] you don't need legalism you don't need
[1:47:02] rituals you don't need rules you don't
[1:47:03] need a church order
[1:47:06] none of that is necessary you don't need
[1:47:08] to say well to go to this church you got
[1:47:09] to dress this way and you got to look
[1:47:10] this way and you got to do that
[1:47:12] you don't need that if all you're
[1:47:15] attracted to is the word of god
[1:47:18] then the word of god is available
[1:47:21] and if you're attracted to the word of
[1:47:22] god and you see the word of god said
[1:47:24] just where you say amen
[1:47:25] you see the word of god says conduct
[1:47:26] yourself this way amen the word of god
[1:47:29] says go to church
[1:47:31] you say amen not because i have to in
[1:47:34] order to be a believer but because i'm a
[1:47:36] believer
[1:47:39] i'm so attracted to the word that i i
[1:47:43] can't be distracted
[1:47:46] have you ever seen a couple a teenage
[1:47:48] couple
[1:47:49] that is engaged in getting ready to be
[1:47:51] married
[1:47:55] they're not distractible you're sitting
[1:47:58] in the same room
[1:48:00] everybody's a talking and you're like
[1:48:02] hey hey hey
[1:48:03] there's people here
[1:48:07] and they're looking at each other and
[1:48:08] one will say
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:11] like fill us in can we be part of your
[1:48:14] conversation
[1:48:17] all their other friends they don't get
[1:48:19] the same text messages they used to get
[1:48:22] they don't get all the visits they
[1:48:25] something's
[1:48:25] changed because there's an attraction
[1:48:29] and that attraction eliminates
[1:48:32] distraction
[1:48:37] not a have to not a forced religion not
[1:48:40] a
[1:48:40] beating it over somebody's head so you
[1:48:42] better not do this you better not do
[1:48:43] that you better not do that
[1:48:44] oh if you ever get attracted to jesus
[1:48:47] christ you won't be distracted by all
[1:48:48] the things of the world
[1:48:50] all the movies and entertainments and
[1:48:52] fashions and entertainment places and
[1:48:55] what every other church is doing
[1:48:56] it doesn't matter anymore i'm so
[1:48:58] satisfied with this i haven't even
[1:49:00] looked up to see
[1:49:07] but there's an attraction
[1:49:11] that can lead to a distraction
[1:49:14] away from the things of god and that is
[1:49:17] what the devil is attempting to do
[1:49:20] in this day
[1:49:23] let's go to numbers 23.
[1:49:27] we'll read this as we wind down to a
[1:49:40] close
[1:49:44] numbers 23 9
[1:49:50] this is god speaking through balaam as
[1:49:52] balaam was trying to curse
[1:49:56] israel chapter 23 verse 9
[1:50:00] says for from the top of the rocks i see
[1:50:03] him
[1:50:04] and from the hills i behold him lo the
[1:50:07] people shall dwell alone
[1:50:09] and shall not be reckoned among the
[1:50:11] nations
[1:50:14] when god looked down that's what he saw
[1:50:18] when god looked down that's what he
[1:50:20] wanted
[1:50:21] he wanted a nation that would stand
[1:50:23] alone and not be reckoned with the other
[1:50:25] nations
[1:50:28] what does god want now he wants a bride
[1:50:30] that will come out of the churches
[1:50:32] and not be reckoned with the
[1:50:34] denominations
[1:50:35] that will stay alone with god with his
[1:50:38] word
[1:50:39] and let his word be her guiding light
[1:50:47] amen brother baby says in the pergament
[1:50:49] church age
[1:50:51] now in spite of the fact that balaam
[1:50:53] knew the proper approach
[1:50:55] to god and could bring forth a
[1:50:56] revelation from the lord by means of a
[1:50:58] special enduman of power
[1:51:01] he was still for all of that a bishop in
[1:51:03] the false group
[1:51:05] for what did he do now in order to win
[1:51:06] favor with balak he formulated a plan
[1:51:08] wherein god would be forced to deal with
[1:51:10] israel and death
[1:51:12] just as satan knew that he would begow
[1:51:14] eve cause her to fall in fleshly sin
[1:51:17] thus causing god to pass his pronounced
[1:51:19] sentence of
[1:51:20] death against sin so balaam knew that if
[1:51:23] he would
[1:51:24] if he could get israel to sin god would
[1:51:26] have to deal with him in death
[1:51:28] so he planned a way to get them to come
[1:51:30] over and join in sin
[1:51:31] he sent out invitations to come to the
[1:51:33] feast of baal pior come over and worship
[1:51:35] with us
[1:51:36] now israel no doubt had seen the feast
[1:51:38] of the egyptians
[1:51:40] back in the denominations that they were
[1:51:42] brought out of
[1:51:45] so they did not feel it was too wrong to
[1:51:47] go and just look on and perhaps eat with
[1:51:49] the people
[1:51:51] just a little participation a little bit
[1:51:54] of mingling
[1:51:58] where did they see that back in egypt so
[1:52:00] it's
[1:52:01] they were desensitized to it
[1:52:07] what's wrong with fellowship anyway
[1:52:09] we're supposed to love them aren't we
[1:52:10] or how can we win them being friendly
[1:52:12] never hurt anyone or so they thought
[1:52:14] but when the sexy moabitish women began
[1:52:16] to dance and undress while they whirled
[1:52:18] around doing their rock and roll twist
[1:52:20] the lust rose up in the israelites and
[1:52:22] they were drawn into adultery
[1:52:24] and god and wrath slew 42 000 of them
[1:52:29] and that and that is what constantine
[1:52:31] and his successors did at nicaea and
[1:52:32] after nicea they invited the people of
[1:52:34] god
[1:52:34] to the convention and when the church
[1:52:36] sat down to eat and rose up to play
[1:52:38] partaking of the church form ceremonies
[1:52:40] pagan feasts named after christian rites
[1:52:43] she was trapped she had committed
[1:52:44] fornication and god walked out
[1:52:48] when any man turns from the word of god
[1:52:50] and joins a church instead of receiving
[1:52:51] the holy spirit that man dies
[1:52:55] dead that is what he is don't join a
[1:52:57] church don't get into an organization
[1:52:59] and get taken up with creeds and
[1:53:01] traditions or anything that takes the
[1:53:02] place of the word
[1:53:03] and the spirit or you're dead it's all
[1:53:05] over you're dead eternally
[1:53:07] separated from god that is what has
[1:53:10] happened in every age sense god delivers
[1:53:12] the people
[1:53:13] they come out by the blood sanctified by
[1:53:15] the word walk through the waters of
[1:53:17] baptism and get filled with the spirit
[1:53:19] but after a while the first love cools
[1:53:21] off and someone gets the idea
[1:53:23] that they ought to organize in order to
[1:53:25] preserve themselves and make a name for
[1:53:26] themselves
[1:53:27] and they organize themselves right back
[1:53:29] in a second generation
[1:53:31] and sometimes even before then they no
[1:53:34] longer have the spirit of god just a
[1:53:35] form of worship
[1:53:36] they are dead they have hybridized
[1:53:38] themselves with creed and form and
[1:53:40] there's no life in them
[1:53:42] so balaam got israel to commit
[1:53:43] fornication
[1:53:45] do you know that physical fornication is
[1:53:47] the very same spirit that lies in
[1:53:49] organized religion
[1:53:52] that's why these that's why these
[1:53:54] stories from the old testament are so
[1:53:56] pertinent
[1:53:56] to us amen they happen naturally to
[1:53:58] israel but these are spiritual
[1:54:00] these same spirits are alive today
[1:54:02] spirits don't die
[1:54:05] what happened to israel as a physical
[1:54:07] nation has happened to the church
[1:54:09] amen by these same spirits coming in and
[1:54:12] causing spiritual fornication
[1:54:15] and adultery
[1:54:20] as i said the spirit of fornication is
[1:54:22] the spirit of organization
[1:54:24] and all fornicators will have their
[1:54:26] place in the lake of fire that is what
[1:54:27] god thinks of organization yes sir
[1:54:29] the and her daughters will be in
[1:54:31] the lake of fire
[1:54:33] denominations are not of god they never
[1:54:35] have been and never will be
[1:54:37] it's a wrong spirit that separates the
[1:54:39] people of god into hierarchy and laity
[1:54:42] and it's therefore a wrong spirit that
[1:54:43] separates the people from the people
[1:54:45] that's what organization and
[1:54:46] denominations do in organizing they
[1:54:49] separate
[1:54:50] themselves from the word of god and
[1:54:51] bring themselves into spiritual
[1:54:54] adultery
[1:54:58] why because their husband is jesus
[1:55:01] christ the word
[1:55:04] and when they begin to flirt around with
[1:55:06] something else
[1:55:08] they begin to want something other than
[1:55:11] christ
[1:55:14] now they don't want to throw away christ
[1:55:16] they still want christ
[1:55:18] because they need him to get to heaven
[1:55:19] and deliverance when they're sick and
[1:55:21] they need all the benefits of being
[1:55:23] married to christ
[1:55:26] but still want to flirt around a little
[1:55:29] bit like they did before they were
[1:55:30] married
[1:55:31] because of the way it makes them feel
[1:55:35] satisfying and gratifying and i enjoy
[1:55:40] but christ wants a bride that's reserved
[1:55:42] to him only
[1:55:48] let's go to john chapter 6.
[1:55:55] the gospel of john chapter 6.
[1:56:01] i quoted this but i'd like to read it
[1:56:02] together
[1:56:10] verse 6 or chapter 6 verse 67
[1:56:17] jesus had already said unless you drink
[1:56:20] the flesh
[1:56:21] drink the blood of the son of man in his
[1:56:22] flesh you have no part with me they said
[1:56:24] it's a hard saying
[1:56:26] and he says what and if you see the son
[1:56:28] of man ascend to where he was before
[1:56:31] and they left and jesus then
[1:56:34] said jesus unto the twelve will you go
[1:56:36] will you also
[1:56:37] go away then simon peter answered him
[1:56:40] lord to whom shall we go
[1:56:42] thou hast the words of eternal
[1:56:46] life what was attracting
[1:56:50] peter
[1:56:54] peter was attracted to the word of
[1:56:56] eternal life
[1:56:58] and we believe and are sure that thou
[1:57:00] art the christ
[1:57:02] the son of the living god jesus answered
[1:57:05] them
[1:57:06] have not i chosen you 12 and one of you
[1:57:08] is a devil
[1:57:10] he spake of judas iscariot the son of
[1:57:12] simon for he it was that should betray
[1:57:14] him being one
[1:57:15] of the twelve jesus had made some hard
[1:57:18] statements without explanation
[1:57:21] and in the hard statements that couldn't
[1:57:23] be comprehended intellectually
[1:57:26] they walked away hundreds and dozens and
[1:57:29] they walked away and finally he got down
[1:57:32] to his 12 and he turned and he says will
[1:57:34] you go away also
[1:57:35] and peter because he had a revelation of
[1:57:38] who jesus christ was
[1:57:39] he said unto whom will we go thou alone
[1:57:45] have the words of eternal life what he's
[1:57:48] saying is
[1:57:49] there's no other place to get what i'm
[1:57:52] attracted to
[1:57:53] there's no other place to go to have the
[1:57:56] thing that i want amen
[1:57:57] what was peter declaring he wanted the
[1:58:00] words of eternal life
[1:58:01] where should i go thou alone has what i
[1:58:04] want
[1:58:05] you alone have the thing i'm craving you
[1:58:07] alone have the thing that i'm desiring
[1:58:14] where shall i go to find the mind of god
[1:58:16] the message of the hour
[1:58:17] where else will you find the word of
[1:58:19] eternal life
[1:58:21] the bible come alive the word restored
[1:58:24] to its proper place
[1:58:27] peter when they were leaving
[1:58:31] masses of people leaving rejection
[1:58:34] coming on on every hand
[1:58:36] pressure building everywhere
[1:58:39] jesus was not trying to keep anybody
[1:58:43] he wanted them to come by faith by
[1:58:45] revelation not by enticement
[1:58:48] not by intellectualism not not by a pool
[1:58:51] of emotion
[1:58:52] amen jesus wasn't working on any of
[1:58:54] those things he was just giving the word
[1:58:56] and letting it fall giving the word and
[1:58:57] letting it fall
[1:58:59] and as he did all of that without trying
[1:59:02] to save his congregation without trying
[1:59:03] to pull people
[1:59:05] he looked at his 12 he got down to 12.
[1:59:09] he wasn't nervous he wasn't afraid
[1:59:12] because he knew all that the father has
[1:59:14] given me shall come to me and all of you
[1:59:16] given to me i will lose none
[1:59:21] peter he looked at them will you guys go
[1:59:23] also
[1:59:24] he didn't say please stay he said
[1:59:28] you want to go peter said
[1:59:31] there's no place else i can go
[1:59:34] to get what my heart is hungering for
[1:59:40] the same thing's true today you and i
[1:59:42] can go anywhere we want
[1:59:44] there's no strings attached there's no
[1:59:46] hold on us we can go anywhere i want
[1:59:48] but i've only ever found one place
[1:59:52] i've only ever found one place and
[1:59:54] that's in this restored word in this
[1:59:55] hour
[1:59:56] this message that god gave us i've only
[1:59:58] found one place that satisfies what i've
[2:00:00] been longing for all my life
[2:00:02] there's only one place amen that when
[2:00:05] when this word opens up it begins to
[2:00:07] draw
[2:00:07] life out of the inside of me where it's
[2:00:10] not a put on it's not a religion it's
[2:00:12] not fig leaves but there's an actual
[2:00:14] life on the inside of me being unlocked
[2:00:16] by the word of god
[2:00:17] and it's not a life i live anymore it's
[2:00:18] a life he lives through me
[2:00:21] there's only one place and the only
[2:00:23] place is in christ and christ is the
[2:00:24] only one that has the word
[2:00:26] of eternal life
[2:00:29] let's become so satisfied so in love so
[2:00:31] hungry with that
[2:00:32] that it doesn't matter how many people
[2:00:34] are walking away
[2:00:35] how many people are saying what they're
[2:00:37] saying and how enticing this is and
[2:00:39] how beautiful that is
[2:00:43] there was no beauty that we should
[2:00:45] behold him
[2:00:47] and when we saw him he was despised and
[2:00:49] rejected
[2:00:50] that's what peter saw in the carnal but
[2:00:53] there was another attraction for peter
[2:00:59] let's go to jeremiah 15. i'm just going
[2:01:00] to read a few scriptures right in a row
[2:01:02] as we close
[2:01:05] jeremiah 15.
[2:01:21] jeremiah 15 and 16
[2:01:24] thy words were found and i did eat them
[2:01:29] and thy word was unto me the joy in
[2:01:31] rejoicing
[2:01:33] of mine heart for i am called by thy
[2:01:36] name o lord god
[2:01:38] of hosts is this scripture talking about
[2:01:42] you
[2:01:43] let's read it again and you tell me if
[2:01:45] this scripture's talking about you
[2:01:47] thy words were found and i did eat them
[2:01:51] and thy word was unto me the joy and
[2:01:54] rejoicing of mine
[2:01:55] heart for i am called by thy
[2:01:58] name o lord god of host
[2:02:02] if his word is the rejoicing of your
[2:02:04] heart don't worry
[2:02:05] there'll be no other attraction amen
[2:02:08] let's go to psalms 119.
[2:02:12] and i would recommend to you this week
[2:02:14] just read through all of psalms 119.
[2:02:16] it's the longest book in the bible
[2:02:20] but what i found it to be about the
[2:02:21] entire time
[2:02:23] is love for the word of god the whole
[2:02:25] chapter of 119
[2:02:27] is a respect of reverence a love and a
[2:02:29] fear for the word of god
[2:02:32] the longest chapter in all the bible is
[2:02:34] talking about how much
[2:02:36] the writer loves the word of god stands
[2:02:39] by the word of god
[2:02:41] rejoices in the word of god feeds on the
[2:02:43] word of god
[2:02:44] meditates on the word of god
[2:02:47] let's look at verse 72
[2:02:53] the law of thy mouth is better unto me
[2:02:55] than thousands of
[2:02:56] gold and silver let's go to
[2:03:00] verse 103 how sweet are thy words unto
[2:03:04] my taste
[2:03:04] yea sweeter than honey to my mouth
[2:03:09] verse 127 therefore i love thy
[2:03:12] commandments
[2:03:13] above gold yea above
[2:03:16] fine gold
[2:03:20] this is somebody who's attracted to the
[2:03:23] word
[2:03:25] and they found the greatest attraction
[2:03:27] of their life
[2:03:28] it's worth more than gold it's worth
[2:03:30] more than silver it's
[2:03:31] sweeter than honey in my mouth
[2:03:35] this is what peter had found did peter
[2:03:39] understand it in the day that he spoke
[2:03:40] it no but peter had found the thing that
[2:03:42] was satisfying what was inside of him
[2:03:46] he said thou alone whom will i go thou
[2:03:48] alone has the words of
[2:03:49] eternal life
[2:03:52] but he says have not i chose you twelve
[2:03:54] in one of you
[2:03:56] is a devil judas was
[2:03:59] chosen by jesus christ
[2:04:03] but he was a devil from the beginning
[2:04:06] and he didn't have what
[2:04:08] peter had peter
[2:04:11] seemingly the ministry was losing
[2:04:13] everything but peter said i have no
[2:04:15] place
[2:04:16] else for me to go there's only one
[2:04:17] satisfying plow there's only one well
[2:04:20] that gives me this clean water
[2:04:24] but judas ran and exchanged the word of
[2:04:28] eternal life
[2:04:29] for 30 pieces of silver
[2:04:34] judas was attracted by something else
[2:04:37] the greatest attraction in his life
[2:04:40] was not christ
[2:04:44] i don't want to be a judas
[2:04:49] we've known of people who have sold
[2:04:51] christ for a lot less
[2:04:53] than 30 pieces of silver they sold him
[2:04:57] for a man
[2:04:57] sold him for a woman sold him for a job
[2:05:02] sold him for family members is that true
[2:05:06] left the word of god and rejected it for
[2:05:08] far less than 30 pieces of silver
[2:05:13] but there's a people in this earth that
[2:05:15] can find nothing else satisfying
[2:05:18] but this smitten rock this manna from
[2:05:21] heaven
[2:05:23] this word that has been restored to us
[2:05:25] in this hour
[2:05:27] let's all stand musicians if you'll come
[2:05:31] with blake if you'll come
[2:05:38] i just want to tell you whatever you're
[2:05:40] attracted to will finally manifest
[2:05:44] when i say god i'm attracted to your
[2:05:47] word
[2:05:49] keep me all gone
[2:05:52] the greatest thing in my life is this
[2:05:55] manna
[2:05:57] the greatest thing that i've ever tasted
[2:05:59] is this fresh clean water
[2:06:01] flowing from the throne of god
[2:06:04] this word is our portion this word is
[2:06:06] our meat this word is our life
[2:06:10] let's not be distracted by anything else
[2:06:14] let's not worry about the moabites this
[2:06:17] or that let's look up every morning in
[2:06:20] the camp of israel
[2:06:22] and say there's no place i'd rather be
[2:06:26] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[2:06:30] we thank you
[2:06:32] for your word lord that is so rich
[2:06:36] god i want to say i'm thankful lord
[2:06:39] that you put down inside of me
[2:06:42] something that i could have not
[2:06:44] pretended made up
[2:06:46] intellectually received but you put
[2:06:49] faith down in my heart
[2:06:52] you gave me the capacity to believe you
[2:06:54] lord
[2:06:57] and god i want to stand like peter
[2:07:01] and i want to declare whom should i go
[2:07:04] lord

[2:07:12] life of the word living in me
[2:07:15] i want to be united with you i want you
[2:07:17] and you only
[2:07:19] god i pray that you'd preserve us from
[2:07:21] man's ideas
[2:07:23] preserve us from the lust of the flesh
[2:07:26] the lust of the eyes
[2:07:27] the pride of life as we follow after you
[2:07:31] and eat your manna that you're raining
[2:07:33] down upon us daily
[2:07:34] and drinking from the smitten rock i
[2:07:37] pray god that you would take every
[2:07:39] desire
[2:07:40] for the world out of us that our
[2:07:43] greatest desire would be you and you
[2:07:45] alone
[2:07:47] god help us to resist the temptation to
[2:07:49] look what any other group of people are
[2:07:51] doing
[2:07:52] lord let us just follow after you as
[2:07:54] individuals
[2:07:57] let us not look to the right or to the
[2:07:58] left but lord let's keep our eye

[2:08:20] life but the traction of the word it's
[2:08:23] greater to us
[2:08:24] than thousands of gold and silver it's
[2:08:27] sweeter to us than the sweetest
[2:08:29] honeycomb
[2:08:30] it is our life god bless your people
[2:08:34] i pray god that you move with us as we
[2:08:36] go and may we go rejoicing
