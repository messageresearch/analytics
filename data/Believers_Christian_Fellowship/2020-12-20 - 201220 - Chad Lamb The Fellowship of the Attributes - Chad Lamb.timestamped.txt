[7:37] jesus
[7:42] to reach out and

[8:52] oh
[8:55] [Music]
[9:01] thou art good
[9:09] i am
[9:34] why
[9:42] [Music]
[9:46] praise the lord man let's all take our
[9:49] bibles where we're standing
[9:52] let's look to first john
[9:56] pleasure to be with you we appreciate
[9:58] the atmosphere and appreciate each one
[10:00] being here
[10:01] as we just look into the word i i'd like
[10:03] to take for a title today
[10:05] the fellowship of the attributes the
[10:08] fellowship of the attributes
[10:10] and i'd like to jump back to where we
[10:12] were last sunday and kind of do a little
[10:13] bit of review and maybe move a little
[10:15] bit forward
[10:15] but i want to really capture this
[10:17] thought and i don't want to go too fast
[10:19] and breeze too fast through it
[10:21] so if you allow me just a little bit of
[10:22] time to readdress that
[10:25] first john chapter 1
[10:28] verse 5.
[10:33] this then is the message which we have
[10:35] heard of him and declare unto you
[10:37] that god is light and in him is no
[10:39] darkness at all
[10:40] if we say that we have fellowship with
[10:42] him and walk in darkness we lie
[10:45] and do not to truth but if we walk in
[10:47] the light
[10:48] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[10:50] one with another
[10:52] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[10:54] cleanses us from all sin
[10:57] let's ask the lord's blessing over the
[10:58] reading of the word lord jesus we thank
[11:00] you
[11:01] that we can once again be here lord that
[11:04] we can gather in this fashion lord with
[11:05] our brothers and sisters
[11:07] and all we've sung lord we've sung
[11:09] praises and worship to you
[11:11] and you told us that you abide in the
[11:13] praises of your people
[11:15] lord we believe that you're here because
[11:16] your word says wherever two or three are
[11:18] gathered in your name you'll be in their
[11:19] midst
[11:20] and i pray now you would find welcome
[11:22] here lord that we receive you lord in
[11:25] the way that you come
[11:26] that you would find a welcome in us lord
[11:28] that we would listen to your word and
[11:30] hear it lord that you would feed us by
[11:32] your own hand
[11:33] that we might grow stronger in this day
[11:35] and age that we live
[11:36] open our eyes lord that we might see and
[11:38] give us a heart to perceive
[11:40] and receive all of your word in jesus
[11:42] christ's name we pray
[11:44] amen you can all be seated
[11:47] i would like to keep looking at the
[11:49] scripture for just a minute and i want
[11:51] to look at verse six
[11:52] if we say that we have fellowship with
[11:54] him and walk in darkness
[11:57] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[11:59] walk in the light as
[12:01] he is in the light this is a super
[12:04] important scripture that we catch and
[12:05] understand this
[12:07] as we walk in the light as he is in the
[12:09] light
[12:10] so that's present tense current light
[12:12] amen
[12:13] and that light is the revealed word for
[12:15] our day for the day and age that we live
[12:17] in
[12:18] that is light amen the revealed word for
[12:20] our day is light
[12:21] so we must walk in the light as he is in
[12:24] the light amen
[12:26] so let's read that again but if we walk
[12:27] in the light as he is in the light we
[12:29] have fellowship
[12:30] one with another so we realize without
[12:33] this revealed word amen walking in the
[12:36] light of the revealed word we do not
[12:37] even have fellowship
[12:39] with each other there's not even there's
[12:42] not even a basis for fellowship
[12:44] outside this revealed word
[12:48] you know because sometimes a lot of
[12:49] things gets called fellowship that's not
[12:51] fellowship
[12:52] and and there are things that are not
[12:54] wrong i mean there's a lot of things
[12:55] that we do when we get together and
[12:56] visit with one another and catch up
[12:58] that's not fellowship but it's also not
[13:00] bad you know it's not
[13:01] wicked to find out how works going for a
[13:03] brother and how the family is doing and
[13:05] things like that
[13:06] we should know about each other and love
[13:07] each other that's part of the family of
[13:08] god
[13:09] but when we really get down to
[13:11] fellowship fellowship is not just dinner
[13:13] fellowship is
[13:14] is not just volleyball it's not getting
[13:16] together for games or for recreation
[13:18] fellowship is walking in the light as he
[13:21] is and the light
[13:21] will give us fellowship with one another
[13:24] because we are children of the light
[13:26] and the children of the light can only
[13:28] fellowship in the light
[13:30] of the age that they live in so let's
[13:33] read this again
[13:34] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[13:36] the light we have fellowship one with
[13:38] another
[13:38] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[13:42] cleanses us from all sin so the
[13:45] cleansing
[13:46] the cleansing of the blood is in the
[13:47] washing of the water by the word amen
[13:50] brother brahm ties those things together
[13:51] it's by the washing of the water by the
[13:53] word
[13:54] because we're sanctified by the spirit
[13:56] which is the life that was in that blood
[13:57] amen and if we walk in the light as he
[13:59] is in the light then we have fellowship
[14:01] with one another
[14:02] and the blood of jesus christ will
[14:04] cleanse us from all sin
[14:06] so it's imperative that the that the
[14:09] children of god walk in the light of god
[14:12] that's why it's so important to preach
[14:14] the revelation the hour and preached the
[14:15] prophet's message amen
[14:17] there's no way there's no way to
[14:19] reconcile
[14:20] anybody back to god without this word
[14:23] amen
[14:23] it's an impossibility you can get
[14:26] somebody's heart
[14:28] turned towards a historical jesus and i
[14:31] know i don't say that derogatory i don't
[14:32] mean that bad in any way so
[14:34] just hang with me you can get their
[14:35] heart turned to the story of what god's
[14:37] done
[14:38] and how god has always worked and
[14:40] brought us through and how god has paid
[14:41] the price of redemption
[14:42] but the way to get them reconciled back
[14:44] to god is to bring him to the word for
[14:46] their day
[14:49] because that's who he is he is the word
[14:53] he is the revealed word so we have we
[14:56] have to preach
[14:57] the gospel the good news what is the
[15:00] good news the message of the hour
[15:02] it is the good news so i want to look at
[15:05] this word fellowship just for a minute
[15:07] we have fellowship one with another and
[15:09] this fellowship in the greek
[15:11] it's interpreted many different ways
[15:12] fellowship communion
[15:14] communication and as they give
[15:16] definitions at the bottom say fellowship
[15:19] association a community a communion
[15:22] a joint pers uh participation
[15:26] the share which one has in anything
[15:28] participation
[15:29] so if we have fellowship with one
[15:30] another it's something that we're
[15:32] joining in
[15:33] and we have a part in and a
[15:35] participation in
[15:37] and so this walking in the light as he
[15:39] isn't a lie will give us fellowship with
[15:41] one another because we become
[15:42] part of we have a share in we begin to
[15:45] participate
[15:46] in the same thing that's what fellowship
[15:49] is friends
[15:50] it's participating in this same thing
[15:52] together let's turn over to first
[15:54] corinthians chapter 1.
[16:02] first corinthians chapter 1
[16:06] and verse 9.
[16:12] god is faithful by whom ye were called
[16:15] unto the fellowship of his son
[16:16] jesus christ our lord so you're not
[16:20] called to the fellowship of a church
[16:22] you're not called to the fellowship but
[16:23] you're called to the fellowship
[16:25] of his son jesus christ our lord you're
[16:28] called to
[16:29] that joint participation you have a
[16:31] share in that you're part of
[16:33] that community amen the fellowship
[16:37] of his son jesus christ our lord so i
[16:39] want to i want to read this is a little
[16:41] bit of review here but i want to read
[16:42] from satan's eden it says now that's the
[16:45] way god was in the beginning
[16:47] every son of god and every daughter of
[16:48] god was in god at the beginning
[16:50] you don't remember it now but you were
[16:52] there he knowed it and he wanted you to
[16:55] become so he could contact you
[16:57] speak with you and love you and shake
[16:59] your hands
[17:01] this is an amazing statement god had a
[17:03] plan and god had a desire
[17:05] and part of that desire amen in his
[17:08] thoughts we'd be
[17:09] we were sons and daughters of god we
[17:10] were attributes of him
[17:12] in his thinking before the foundation of
[17:14] the world but he
[17:15] wanted a further manifestation amen for
[17:19] another level of fellowship together
[17:22] amen so god in his thinking we know his
[17:24] thoughts or his attributes
[17:26] and his attributes god wanted fellowship
[17:28] with the attributes
[17:31] in the message spiritual amnesia he says
[17:33] now to be a true christian
[17:36] you have to be the same we don't want to
[17:38] forget that all that
[17:39] he was i'm identified with him i'm
[17:41] identified with him
[17:42] notice he is in me and i in him notice
[17:46] then every christian that's a real
[17:48] genuine christian
[17:50] was with him when the morning star sang
[17:52] together
[17:53] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[17:55] before there was a foundation of the
[17:57] world
[17:57] we were identified in the mortal in the
[18:00] immortal realms with god
[18:01] 10 million years before the world was
[18:03] ever formed i was back there with him
[18:06] if i got eternal life i was there with
[18:08] him i was identified with him when the
[18:10] morning stars sang together and the sons
[18:12] of god
[18:12] shouted for joy question is were you
[18:15] there
[18:16] amen if you were there you had
[18:18] fellowship with god before
[18:20] they meant and god's great desire was
[18:22] fellowship
[18:24] to be a family to have fellowship with
[18:25] his attributes and he had
[18:27] fellowship with the attributes in his
[18:29] thinking and he wanted another
[18:30] expression
[18:31] and more fellowship in the other
[18:33] expression
[18:35] so this is really important this is why
[18:37] god is doing what he's doing
[18:39] friends it's when when we have by the
[18:41] message of the hour
[18:42] the ability to go back amen that's why i
[18:45] enjoyed brother tell us the song it was
[18:47] very timely amen
[18:48] we go back further back amen go back
[18:52] before the story started on earth and
[18:54] back before the fall in the garden of
[18:56] eden back before the war in heaven
[18:58] to go back and realize that god had a
[19:00] desire
[19:01] and that desire god had was to have
[19:04] fellowship with his attributes amen and
[19:06] so he was going to
[19:07] he was going to divide himself up now
[19:10] now these are just human terms
[19:12] because god divide himself up makes him
[19:14] no less god amen
[19:16] it's not like he portions a piece off
[19:18] here and now there's only 60 percent of
[19:20] god 30
[19:21] over there god's not changing amen how
[19:23] he does it i don't quite understand
[19:25] but god is is his attributes a portion
[19:28] of himself
[19:29] he's going to have come out in a
[19:30] manifestation to unite back with himself
[19:33] because that's what he wants
[19:36] so your existing started not when your
[19:38] mom and dad got married amen not when
[19:41] your birth certificate
[19:42] announced your arrival amen but your
[19:44] existence started back there
[19:46] when you had fellowship before with god
[19:53] now remember the basis of fellowship
[19:55] amen with one another is walking in the
[19:57] light as he is in the light
[20:01] amen god is so good
[20:05] now we were there
[20:09] now if you can say from the bottom of
[20:11] your heart i was there
[20:12] like i don't understand it amen i don't
[20:15] comprehend it i don't remember it
[20:17] amen but there's some witness in my
[20:20] heart that says that's the truth amen i
[20:22] believe what the prophet's saying
[20:23] amen i see that that is true amen then
[20:26] what on earth do you have to worry about
[20:29] friends
[20:30] what problem will take you what thing is
[20:32] there that's too big that's not going to
[20:34] be handled
[20:35] what's not already been addressed in the
[20:37] mind of god you were there before amen
[20:39] your destination is secure
[20:41] your name was written in the lamb's book
[20:43] of life before the foundation of the
[20:44] world and it was sealed
[20:45] and that seal wasn't removed to the end
[20:47] time and the only time that the seal was
[20:49] removed
[20:49] was not to put your name in jeopardy but
[20:51] to give you a revelation of who you
[20:53] really are
[20:55] so you were secure from before the
[20:57] foundation of the world
[20:58] and your security didn't change at the
[21:00] opening of the seals the opening of the
[21:02] seals was to show you how secure you've
[21:04] always been
[21:06] so now why do we cower so much when the
[21:08] devil begins to fume
[21:10] and when the devil begins to threaten
[21:12] and begins to stomp and scare us with
[21:14] symptoms and scare us with circumstances
[21:16] amen why is it we cower so badly i mean
[21:19] we've got to stop
[21:20] acting like i mean so i'm acting like we
[21:22] just existed here on this earth and we
[21:24] only have capacity
[21:25] as human beings we've got to realize
[21:27] where we came from where we're going and
[21:29] who's in charge
[21:30] and control these circumstances are
[21:33] nothing outside the mind of god
[21:34] these things these afflictions these
[21:36] symptoms amen they're not
[21:38] beyond god's knowledge and god had a
[21:40] plan before the foundation of the world
[21:42] and it wasn't for me to be a loser it
[21:44] was for him to overcome through me
[21:47] because he's got a goal in mind and he
[21:49] had a goal in mind from before the
[21:51] foundation amen when i was a thought in
[21:53] his mind
[21:54] he showed us the goal
[21:58] and we rejoiced and sang
[22:01] and shouted and clapped our hands amen
[22:04] that's why brother ben tells that story
[22:06] we told last sunday about
[22:07] about the old preacher event in
[22:09] mishawaka said you don't have room for
[22:10] me to preach
[22:11] he says you call this this is a quote
[22:13] that brother quotes this preacher this
[22:15] old preacher 90
[22:16] some years old he says you say i got
[22:19] this new religion
[22:20] he said it's the oldest religion there
[22:22] is this singing shouting clapping
[22:24] dancing religion
[22:25] started all the way back in the mind of
[22:27] god when the sons of god
[22:29] shouted for joy hey amen
[22:33] that enthusiasm you have now it's not
[22:36] new friends this revelation that's
[22:38] coming forth
[22:38] that's stirring your heart and making
[22:40] you a thrilled and shouting amen and
[22:42] clapping your hands
[22:43] amen it's not new it's old
[22:49] actually it's not even old it's eternal
[22:54] it didn't have a time it began it didn't
[22:57] have a start
[22:58] amen it was always there and when god
[23:00] was was fellowshipping with his
[23:02] attributes in his mind
[23:03] now i know that sounds funny but we're
[23:05] going to read some quotes so you can
[23:06] understand what i'm saying amen when god
[23:08] was fellowshipping with the attributes
[23:10] in his mind
[23:10] you were one of those attributes and
[23:13] it's not so much the material out of the
[23:16] earth that you're made of now
[23:18] that'll be redeemed that'll be the
[23:20] vessel that this attribute lives in
[23:22] but it's the attribute the seed the
[23:24] german god the gene of god
[23:25] the portion of the word the part of the
[23:27] life i mean brother man there's so many
[23:29] terms for that
[23:30] don't get caught up in terms what it is
[23:32] is a part of god
[23:34] a part of that life a part of that word
[23:36] a part of that thought
[23:39] and that was you amen and that's the
[23:42] genuine you that's the real you that was
[23:44] to be you
[23:46] and what brings such confusion is
[23:49] hybridization
[23:50] in the fall because now what was to be
[23:52] you
[23:53] this was supposed to be the whole
[23:54] regulating force of you
[23:56] of your triune being you were supposed
[23:59] to be you were supposed to have a soul
[24:00] with this germ of life in it
[24:02] amen you were supposed to have a
[24:04] theophany body
[24:05] or a theophany spirit that was perfect
[24:08] and a body that was not fallen
[24:09] so everything was in harmony amen but
[24:12] because of the fall of man
[24:13] amen now your outer man is in disharmony
[24:16] with your inner man
[24:19] and that's what creates so much
[24:20] confusion because it all depends on what
[24:23] you identify with
[24:24] i mean if you identify with the outer
[24:26] man then you're no good
[24:27] and you're not worthy and you're not
[24:28] capable and how could he choose me and
[24:31] oh mia me a worthlessness and me
[24:35] a worthless dad i don't see how god
[24:37] could choose me
[24:42] well he didn't wake up in the morning
[24:44] and say um
[24:46] him her him her
[24:51] i don't know some days yes some days no
[24:55] but that's exactly how we act
[24:59] and when we ask questions like that how
[25:01] could he choose me
[25:02] i mean there's nothing wrong with that
[25:04] realization that the outer man is
[25:06] worthless amen
[25:07] cannot attain to god cannot get it right
[25:09] and there's a there's a hopelessness and
[25:11] a despair
[25:12] when looking at the outer man and
[25:13] there's nothing wrong with that because
[25:14] it brings the right kind of humility
[25:17] but if we stay there we never realized
[25:19] that it wasn't
[25:20] based off conduct merit performance
[25:23] outerman anything
[25:24] it was based off his forward knowledge
[25:26] because he knew what ground
[25:28] what dirt his his seed was going to land
[25:31] in
[25:32] and that was what was predestinated that
[25:34] germ of life was what was predestinated
[25:39] and so that's the part that he sees is
[25:42] perfect that's the part that he's
[25:44] redeeming back
[25:45] but god in his mind wanted us in a
[25:47] triune being because god is manifest in
[25:50] a triune being and he wants his
[25:51] attributes manifest in a triune being
[25:53] and he wants fellowship and triune
[25:55] beings
[25:57] why brother chad i don't know
[26:00] but that's what he does that's what he
[26:02] wants that's the way he wants it
[26:04] and so that was foiled that plan was
[26:08] foiled
[26:08] it was it went into corruption in the
[26:11] garden
[26:12] but god is bringing it back because that
[26:14] was his purpose from the beginning
[26:16] so so many times we hear
[26:20] we we defy our own
[26:23] faith by the words that come out of our
[26:24] mouth
[26:27] we identify with the fallen creature and
[26:30] we don't identify
[26:32] with the seed gene of god amen
[26:35] and like i said before there's nothing
[26:37] wrong with the right
[26:38] understanding that i in my flesh and in
[26:41] my mind
[26:42] am incapable that should always be a
[26:45] part of our understanding
[26:47] if not we'll get lifted up in pride
[26:48] we'll have too much self-confidence and
[26:50] we will get flattened
[26:52] so there's a good healthy dose of of of
[26:55] an inability in the outer man and it's
[26:57] healthy to understand
[26:59] that me as a person me as a human being
[27:02] me as this creature the outer man realm
[27:04] i'm
[27:05] i'm just toast i'm finished that's why
[27:08] you can say god without you i can do
[27:09] nothing
[27:10] i can never get it right i will never
[27:12] get it right i've never been able to get
[27:14] it right
[27:15] amen but i'm so glad that before the
[27:16] foundation you saw that it would become
[27:18] right
[27:19] and you made every you made every
[27:22] everything that needed to be fixed you
[27:24] fixed and everything that needed to be
[27:26] set
[27:26] you set and everything that need to be
[27:28] tuned you tuned so that we could get
[27:30] there
[27:31] because you knew i couldn't do it
[27:34] that's why he came to abraham with an
[27:36] unconditional covenant
[27:37] because no conditional covenant with
[27:39] human beings was going to work so he
[27:41] come with an unconditional covenant
[27:43] because it was the only way that god can
[27:45] guarantee the promise
[27:47] to the seed was to make it unconditional
[27:51] not you if you do i will but i have
[27:54] already
[27:56] done it
[28:00] let's go on here serpent seed
[28:03] and from 1958 he says dear god the great
[28:06] and mighty god who formed all things by
[28:08] the power of spirit and has brought
[28:09] jesus christ his only begotten son
[28:12] who freely died for we sinners the just
[28:14] for the unjust to reconcile
[28:16] us back into his marvelous fellowship
[28:18] that we have
[28:19] again with god we had a marvelous
[28:22] fellowship
[28:23] and he wants to reconcile us back to
[28:25] fellowship
[28:27] that we have again with god as we are
[28:29] taught in the blessed word
[28:30] that we had fellowship with him before
[28:32] the foundation of the world
[28:34] when the morning stars sang together and
[28:35] the sons of god shouted for joy
[28:37] way back before the foundation of the
[28:39] world how do we know that that wasn't
[28:41] at the same time that the lamb was slain
[28:43] that when god in his great thinking seen
[28:45] us shouting and rejoicing in our
[28:47] salvation
[28:48] through jesus he had we had
[28:51] fellowship with him as attributes in his
[28:55] thinking before the foundation of the
[28:56] world
[28:58] and the only way to have fellowship
[29:02] restored is to come to the light
[29:05] to the present day light and the present
[29:08] day light
[29:09] will restore us to fellowship that we
[29:12] had with him
[29:13] amen and we live listen we live in such
[29:15] a special time
[29:16] i know we talk about 2020 and the world
[29:19] falling apart in chaos
[29:20] but this as far as the gospel is
[29:22] concerned is the most special time
[29:24] that we've ever had on the face of the
[29:25] earth who else besides us
[29:28] knew what was going on in the mind of
[29:30] god before the foundation of the world
[29:31] who else had such a security amen who
[29:34] else had such an
[29:35] understanding of what went wrong in the
[29:37] garden what went wrong in heaven what
[29:40] he's doing to restore it all
[29:41] and how secure the whole thing is at the
[29:43] opening of the seals
[29:44] nobody no other generation has had what
[29:46] we have
[29:50] so the world's falling apart let it fall
[29:52] apart amen there's something better
[29:54] that's been opened to me amen
[29:55] i'm not putting stock in this world
[29:57] anymore because i realize that i've got
[30:00] a greater inheritance amen
[30:01] that everything that i'm walking on will
[30:03] belong to me as a joint heir one day
[30:06] and i don't want it this way anyhow
[30:09] buy a piece of land i wanted this and i
[30:11] want to go i i don't want any of this
[30:13] the way it is
[30:14] it's rotten it's karate man it's it's
[30:16] degrading itself
[30:18] day by day amen but everything that was
[30:21] made by god
[30:22] amen is going to be renovated by the by
[30:25] fire
[30:25] amen and i will become a possessor of
[30:27] this earth a joint heir of the whole
[30:29] thing
[30:32] so if it all goes away amen of tomorrow
[30:35] amen the laws change and we lose
[30:37] privileges and they take things away
[30:39] so what this isn't the one that i'm
[30:41] hoping for anymore
[30:42] amen the opening of the seals the
[30:44] opening of the word has brought such a
[30:46] revelation
[30:47] amen that the devil should be losing his
[30:49] ability to trouble
[30:50] us
[30:54] you know we we like i said before we say
[30:57] things we ought not to say
[30:59] and we identify with the wrong realm
[31:05] and it's habit because we've done it all
[31:07] of our existence on earth all of our
[31:09] lives in this flesh
[31:10] we've identified with this outer man but
[31:13] but the prophet of god says such
[31:14] marvelous things to us
[31:16] and in fact when he said i quoted before
[31:18] but he said
[31:19] you've never really seen me
[31:23] oh praise god amen amen i can say the
[31:26] same thing you've never really seen me
[31:29] you've only seen the vessel the tent the
[31:32] tabernacle that i've got a temporary
[31:34] dwelling in
[31:37] so if it goes it goes let it go
[31:43] but i don't want it anymore defy
[31:47] the revelation of the word by
[31:49] identifying with the outer realm and
[31:51] saying things that i shouldn't say
[31:55] but i with all my heart want to say what
[31:58] the word says
[32:01] and what this revelation of the hour the
[32:03] way it describes me
[32:05] is the way i want to be described in the
[32:07] way i want to believe
[32:10] i want to identify with what the
[32:14] messenger has taught i don't want to
[32:15] identify
[32:17] what what the devil is trying to to
[32:19] condemn with
[32:20] me with or trying to uh point out in
[32:23] flaws and in failures
[32:24] you know because i realize i never did
[32:26] it in the first place
[32:28] but the prophet said he may have a rap
[32:30] sheet a mile long but the prophet of god
[32:32] said you never did it in the first place
[32:36] he said he said you come into this world
[32:38] married to that of no
[32:40] fault of your own you were trapped into
[32:42] it
[32:46] i say thank you lord thank you lord that
[32:50] i can throw all of that away
[32:51] and say i never did in the first place
[32:53] because in the first place i was in the
[32:55] mind of god in the first place i was one
[32:57] of those attributes shouting and dancing
[32:59] and rejoicing at the plan of god
[33:00] in the first place the first thought he
[33:03] had the first desire
[33:04] was not this form and i'm going back to
[33:07] the first place
[33:09] i will go back to that first place to
[33:11] that original condition in the mind of
[33:13] god
[33:14] what he wanted what he thought will
[33:15] become materialized and i am going to
[33:18] move to that place
[33:21] what's going to move there whatever this
[33:23] life is inside of me that he's
[33:24] designated to be me
[33:27] is going to move there you can call it
[33:30] whatever you want to call it
[33:32] brother calls it lots of things i don't
[33:34] always know what to call it but at the
[33:36] part of god that he that he
[33:38] designated to be me my portion
[33:43] now i want to read a quote out of the
[33:46] smyrnan church age
[33:47] i'm trying to hold back and go slow so
[33:50] that we can just really understand what
[33:52] the prophet's saying
[33:53] and not just understand what he's saying
[33:55] but the implication it should have in
[33:57] our lives
[33:58] that's the thing that i get so troubled
[34:00] with with myself
[34:02] is it takes absolutely nothing
[34:05] nothing to get me so bothered and so
[34:08] troubled
[34:09] and so despondent and discouraged and
[34:11] depressed
[34:12] and and wondering what's wrong and why
[34:14] everything's falling apart
[34:16] and i and i'm like what is wrong with me
[34:18] amen we've had a message like no other
[34:20] time on the face either to give us a
[34:22] true identity
[34:23] what am i worried about nothing is wrong
[34:26] everything
[34:26] is fine and i want to stay with that
[34:30] revelation and the implication of that
[34:32] revelation
[34:33] so that i quit getting tossed about
[34:35] tossed to and fro with every wind of
[34:38] trouble and every wind of discouragement
[34:40] and every every difficulty amen i want
[34:42] to stay with the word so that i can keep
[34:45] marching forward
[34:46] and that he can overcome through me
[34:48] because i'm not i'm not i'm not
[34:50] circumventing my own success by all the
[34:52] words that i say and all the things that
[34:54] i
[34:55] allow the the stay in my mind
[34:59] i want to just believe what he's taught
[35:01] us in this day and what the scriptures
[35:02] say about us
[35:05] in the spartan church age out of the
[35:06] church age book he says now according to
[35:08] the word of god the bride was chosen
[35:10] before the foundation of the world
[35:12] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[35:14] in himself
[35:15] ephesians 1 9. this is one of the most
[35:18] amazing
[35:19] to me it's one of the most amazing
[35:20] scriptures that he purposed this in
[35:21] himself
[35:23] that means he didn't ask your opinion he
[35:26] didn't check with you first
[35:29] he didn't wait to see how you would do
[35:36] he already purposed in himself that this
[35:39] is what he's going to do he
[35:40] chose us in him before the foundation of
[35:43] the world
[35:44] according to his own will he purposed it
[35:47] within himself
[35:48] he has already determined it and he is
[35:50] not going to change his mind
[35:52] and it doesn't matter how many times my
[35:55] mind changes
[35:57] doesn't matter how confused i get or how
[36:00] many times
[36:01] this belief passes through my mind his
[36:04] purpose his plan
[36:05] his will is not changing
[36:11] oh praise god and in romans 9 11 it says
[36:15] that the purpose of god according to
[36:16] election
[36:17] might stand you can't read it any other
[36:20] way
[36:21] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[36:24] god
[36:24] was take a bride of his own choosing
[36:29] oh the heart purpose of god the eternal
[36:32] purpose of god
[36:33] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[36:35] now we all say amen that's the truth
[36:38] but i want to ask you are you a bride of
[36:40] his own choosing
[36:41] you as an individual has he chose you
[36:44] has he given you the revelation of his
[36:46] choosing
[36:46] do you know that your name was on that
[36:49] book before the foundation of the world
[36:50] that you're part of that bride that he
[36:52] chose
[36:53] amen that's the revelation we need to
[36:55] overcome in this hour
[36:58] not just say yeah the bride was chosen
[37:00] yeah there was names on the book but say
[37:02] my name was on that book before the
[37:04] foundation world i was in his mind he
[37:06] chose me according to his own purpose
[37:07] and he's not going to lose me he's not
[37:09] going to leave me behind he's not going
[37:11] to throw me away but he's going to
[37:13] fulfill his purpose
[37:16] and i just want to believe it his
[37:19] heart purpose the eternal purpose of god
[37:22] was take a bride of his own choosing
[37:25] and that purpose was in himself and
[37:26] being eternal was decreed before the
[37:28] foundation
[37:29] of the world watch carefully now and see
[37:32] this
[37:32] before there was ever a speck of
[37:34] stardust before god was god
[37:36] god is an object of adoration and no one
[37:39] was there to worship him
[37:40] so he was at the time only potentially
[37:42] god
[37:43] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[37:46] the bride was already
[37:47] in his mind yes she was she was
[37:51] existing in his thoughts i want you to
[37:54] catch this
[37:55] she was existing in his thoughts amen
[37:58] this isn't
[37:59] he's going to go on to say this i'll
[38:01] just read more because i'm going to mess
[38:02] it up
[38:03] she was existing in his thoughts and
[38:04] what about those thoughts of god
[38:06] they are eternal are they not the
[38:08] eternal thoughts of god let me ask you
[38:10] are the thoughts of god eternal
[38:12] if you can see this you will see many
[38:14] things
[38:16] say lord let me see this let me see this
[38:19] so that i can see many things
[38:22] god is unchangeable in both essence and
[38:24] behavior
[38:26] we have studied that and proven that
[38:28] already god is
[38:29] infinite in his abilities so therefore
[38:31] he he as god must be omniscient
[38:34] if he is an omniscient then he is not
[38:35] now learning nor is he taking counsel
[38:38] even with himself
[38:39] nor is he at any time adding to his
[38:41] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[38:43] then he is not omniscient
[38:45] the best we could say is that sometimes
[38:47] he will be but that is not scripture
[38:49] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[38:52] thought about anything because all his
[38:54] thoughts
[38:55] he has he has always had and always will
[38:58] have
[38:59] and knows the end from the beginning
[39:01] because he is god
[39:02] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[39:05] they are
[39:06] real
[39:10] they are not simply like a man with a
[39:11] blueprint he has drawn up in which one
[39:13] day
[39:14] will be translated into substance and
[39:15] form but they are already
[39:17] real and eternal and part of god
[39:20] now i'm not even going to try to explain
[39:23] how that works because i
[39:24] i only have a human brain and understand
[39:27] as a man
[39:28] but god's is not his thinking is not
[39:30] like our thinking his thoughts
[39:31] are so much higher than our thoughts is
[39:33] what he says
[39:34] so his thoughts are not like a man so we
[39:37] cannot even
[39:38] we cannot even relate to this in our
[39:40] human existence
[39:41] but god it says she
[39:44] the bride she was existing in his
[39:47] thoughts
[39:48] listen friends she was there in
[39:51] existence
[39:52] real eternal not a fleeting thought
[39:55] that you you know i have thoughts all
[39:57] the time and five minutes later i'm like
[39:59] what was that i was just thinking about
[40:01] it i can't remember i should have wrote
[40:04] it down
[40:04] i've lost that thought amen that's not
[40:06] how god's thoughts are
[40:08] but god's thoughts are a part of himself
[40:12] you understand god's thoughts are a part
[40:14] of his being
[40:15] amen it's not like us we can have a
[40:17] thought and a thought passes through our
[40:18] mind that didn't come from us
[40:21] that happens all the time but god's not
[40:25] like that
[40:26] god's thoughts are a part of himself and
[40:28] when he had these thoughts these eternal
[40:30] thoughts
[40:31] of his bride amen this was his eternal
[40:33] purpose to have a bride of his own
[40:34] choosing
[40:35] and these thoughts existed in his mind
[40:38] before time so you can say if i am one
[40:40] of those thoughts
[40:41] i existed and before the foundation of
[40:44] the world
[40:45] because they are real they are eternal
[40:47] they're not fleeting they're not an
[40:48] imagination
[40:49] they they are they are real they are
[40:51] eternal they are
[40:52] existing now we're just going to have to
[40:56] accept that because i don't think any of
[40:57] us can understand it or explain it
[40:59] and if you can explain it come see me
[41:01] later because i don't have a clue
[41:03] how to explain that but something in me
[41:06] says
[41:07] amen it's the only way it's the only way
[41:10] that this can work because men will fail
[41:12] every time it's the only way friends
[41:18] in the message possessing the gate of
[41:20] the enemy after the trial
[41:22] he says and remember if you never was in
[41:25] god's thoughts
[41:25] you'll never be with god how many knows
[41:28] that he
[41:29] was a redeemer well then anything
[41:32] redeemed has to come
[41:34] back to where it fell from so if he come
[41:36] to redeem us
[41:37] how could he was one time didn't was one
[41:40] time
[41:40] didn't have to be redeemed one time you
[41:44] didn't have to be redeemed
[41:45] but now you have to be redeemed that
[41:48] means you were in a position or a place
[41:49] that didn't need redemption at one point
[41:52] but now you need redemption
[41:55] so god and redemption is going to bring
[41:57] you back to that place where you don't
[41:58] need redemption
[42:01] praise god
[42:06] at one time didn't have to be redeemed
[42:08] and we were all born in sin shaped in
[42:09] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[42:11] it shows that the real christian is an
[42:13] attribute of god's thinking
[42:15] before there was a world or a star or
[42:17] air
[42:18] or anything else it's eternal and he
[42:20] come to redeem us back it's god's
[42:22] thoughts spoken to a word
[42:24] made manifest and brought back to his
[42:26] thought
[42:28] that's redemption brought back to his
[42:30] thought what he was thinking of what he
[42:32] desired
[42:33] in 1965 and the message leaned not to
[42:36] thine own understanding
[42:37] he said so you see if you were in the
[42:39] foreknowledge of god
[42:41] then you are becoming a part of god in
[42:44] the only way you can be a son of god or
[42:46] a daughter of god you had to be a part
[42:47] of god and god
[42:49] isn't complete without you
[42:52] i want you to understand this i want to
[42:55] understand i should say i want to
[42:57] understand this better
[42:58] because god isn't complete without you
[43:00] because whatever that thought was that
[43:02] was existing
[43:04] that was real that was eternal that
[43:06] thought has
[43:07] moved down into me
[43:11] so listen this this is
[43:14] showing us how real those thoughts are
[43:18] it was a thought but that thought that
[43:20] portion of god
[43:21] that attribute of god that gene of god
[43:24] that germ of god
[43:26] that thought that word whatever that
[43:29] thought
[43:29] was predestinated to be in me and that
[43:31] part is in me and it is the true me
[43:35] and now without that part god is
[43:39] incomplete
[43:41] so how real is that thought
[43:44] it's pretty real so now without that
[43:48] portion that's that that is in your soul
[43:51] without that portion
[43:53] god is incomplete so
[43:56] is in god i just want to ask you is god
[43:59] in jeopardy of remaining incomplete
[44:05] is there a chance that at the end of the
[44:09] story god will have miscalculated
[44:13] and a few pieces get lost somewhere
[44:17] and he has to continue on incomplete you
[44:19] see i say that in jest but
[44:21] but we act as though we talk as though
[44:24] we conduct ourselves as though
[44:25] that at some point i could just be cast
[44:27] away i may not even be one of them
[44:29] i don't even know i just failed and i'm
[44:30] not it no more
[44:32] if you were ever it you're always
[44:36] amen if you were ever if you were ever
[44:38] redeemed if you were ever redeemable
[44:41] you're always redeemable you're always
[44:42] redeemed in the mind of god
[44:44] you cannot be lost you cannot be
[44:46] separated because you're a part of god
[44:47] and god is incomplete without you
[44:50] so we got to quit acting like i'm in one
[44:53] day out the next in one day out the next
[44:55] if you were ever in you're always in
[44:59] sometimes what we got to do is just tell
[45:00] the devil to shut
[45:02] up
[45:05] we don't have to identify with every
[45:07] thought that comes in our mind the only
[45:09] thought that we identify is the one that
[45:11] matches the word
[45:16] brother branham said he said the
[45:18] non-elect don't even want this position
[45:21] don't even ask for it don't even they're
[45:23] not troubled about it all the time
[45:24] they're not turning turmoil about am i
[45:27] pleasing god
[45:27] am i one of the like in my bride the
[45:29] non-elect aren't even
[45:30] asking those questions they're just
[45:33] going on
[45:34] going to the denominators of church
[45:35] assuming everything's fine and happy
[45:37] that way
[45:43] so just tell the devil to shut up
[45:48] if god's given you a revelation of who
[45:50] you are hold on to that revelation if
[45:52] the revelation you got matches the word
[45:54] hold on to it
[45:58] amen we have had
[46:01] we have had something no other age has
[46:04] ever had
[46:06] let's not take it lightly let's take the
[46:08] full implication of what's been said
[46:10] and the full value of what's been
[46:12] delivered to us
[46:14] we shouldn't be acting like they acted
[46:16] in luther's day
[46:18] we shouldn't be we shouldn't be speaking
[46:20] things that they spoke in wesley's day
[46:24] we shouldn't be talking like they talked
[46:25] in the pentecostal day
[46:27] amen we should be speaking like they
[46:29] speak in the bride aj man
[46:30] because there's been an eagle anointing
[46:32] this fly higher than all the
[46:34] denominations and showed us the whole
[46:35] plan of god
[46:36] from before the foundation of the world
[46:37] to the new heavens and new earth and
[46:39] he's also revealed to us
[46:41] our place in that by the end of by
[46:43] individually jesus christ revealing
[46:45] himself to you
[46:46] as an individual placing you in that
[46:48] plan don't ever let the devil's lies
[46:51] pull you out
[46:54] if you're ever there you're always there
[46:59] so god let's read this again and lean
[47:01] out their understanding
[47:02] you're a daughter of god son of god
[47:04] daughter of god you had to be part of
[47:06] god and god
[47:06] isn't complete without you has to be
[47:09] that's right
[47:10] because there is one only one source of
[47:12] eternal life and that is god
[47:14] and him alone has eternal life now you
[47:16] were a part of him
[47:17] in so much that you're an attribute or
[47:19] in his thinking in the beginning
[47:22] and that because he thought of you in
[47:24] the beginning it gives that little tug
[47:26] towards him that what
[47:29] that's what has to be quickened some of
[47:32] them will never be quickened
[47:33] they just don't have it that's all
[47:40] have you felt a little tug towards god
[47:43] has the message of the hour pulled at
[47:45] your heart
[47:46] then you should be able to raise your
[47:48] hand and shout and rejoice and say
[47:50] praise god
[47:50] amen i feel like shouting because
[47:52] there's something in there that god can
[47:54] tug on
[47:55] because there's souls out there there's
[47:56] nothing to tug on
[47:58] there's nothing that the message can tug
[48:00] on there's nothing to get a hold of
[48:02] nothing to pull on
[48:03] amen but if there's something that's
[48:05] pulling us it won't let us go and won't
[48:07] turn us loose no matter how much we fail
[48:10] no matter how much
[48:11] we backslide or doubt remember
[48:13] something's there that keeps tugging
[48:15] we should raise our hands and thank god
[48:17] because that something there was not
[48:19] something we put there
[48:20] it doesn't come from our minds amen it
[48:22] came from the mind of god
[48:24] and it was implanted there by
[48:26] predestination and it's to guarantee
[48:28] that he's going to make sure
[48:29] that grace comes to his seed
[48:35] amen don't discount those things don't
[48:38] throw them away
[48:39] amen we have those i mean god deals with
[48:42] us
[48:42] so powerfully god deals with us so
[48:44] personally amen and the devil will come
[48:46] in and trouble our mind
[48:47] and we're willing to throw this thing
[48:49] away for some thought in our mind
[48:54] but what the prophet told us the way he
[48:56] explained it and the realization we have
[48:58] in ourselves and the experience we have
[49:00] with god that matches that message that
[49:01] matches that word
[49:02] and the devil will come in and tell you
[49:05] that you were wrong the other day when
[49:06] you said that and
[49:07] and you actually lied about that and you
[49:09] should have never spoke this one you
[49:10] didn't have said that you should have
[49:12] never looked at that
[49:13] amen you might not even be one of them
[49:19] show me that in the word
[49:25] you say devil you're right i shouldn't
[49:28] have done that i should have done that
[49:30] and i shouldn't have done that
[49:31] that that that and that but god put
[49:34] something in me to believe
[49:36] and i didn't put it there and i can't
[49:38] take it out
[49:39] i believe
[49:43] something deep deeper than my mind
[49:46] deeper than the confusion that comes to
[49:47] mind deeper than the questions there's
[49:49] something deeper
[49:50] that believes that's that seed gene of
[49:52] god
[49:55] that's what has to be quickened that
[49:57] part that he's tugging at is the part
[49:59] that he's making alive
[50:04] brother says satan's in and so god knew
[50:07] that we would be here
[50:09] but then he put us in flesh so we
[50:12] so we would be we would be contacted in
[50:15] order he could contact
[50:17] he became one of us when he became jesus
[50:19] christ the son of god himself
[50:20] the fullness of the manifestation of god
[50:23] therefore that was god's purpose to
[50:24] display his
[50:25] attributes in fellowship so one of god's
[50:28] purposes was to display his
[50:30] attributes in fellowship god
[50:33] wants to fellowship with his attributes
[50:35] he wants to display
[50:37] his attributes in fellowship
[50:40] when i was in my father i knew nothing
[50:42] about it but when i became his son and
[50:44] was born of him i was an attribute a
[50:46] part of my father
[50:47] and you're a part of your father and as
[50:50] children of god we are part of god's
[50:52] attribute that was in him
[50:54] made flesh like he was made flesh so we
[50:57] can have fellowship
[50:58] one with the other as a family of god
[51:00] upon the earth
[51:01] and that was god's purpose at the
[51:03] beginning yes sir
[51:05] that's what god wanted at the beginning
[51:08] what did god want god wanted amen
[51:11] he wanted us to come into flesh he
[51:14] wanted us to be a family on the earth
[51:16] to have fellowship with one another
[51:19] why because when i have fellowship with
[51:21] you
[51:23] if you have that seed gene of god on you
[51:25] it's been quick in the life
[51:26] when i have fellowship with you i'm
[51:28] having fellowship with god
[51:33] i understand god
[51:36] wanted his attributes he wanted to
[51:38] manifest his attributes in fellowship
[51:41] that's why we can only have fellowship
[51:42] one another if we walk in the light as
[51:44] he is in the light
[51:46] amen because if we get outside of that
[51:47] word amen we're outside of the
[51:49] fellowship but we have to be in the word
[51:51] as he is in the word the message for our
[51:54] day brings us to a place of fellowship
[51:56] the attributes of god are fellowshipping
[51:59] how are they fellowshipping they're
[52:00] fellowshipping by the revelation of the
[52:02] word
[52:04] so that when i fellowship with you amen
[52:07] you you realize now when i begin to
[52:09] fellowship with you
[52:10] i'm fellowshipping with my bridegroom
[52:16] because it's christ in you the hope of
[52:18] glory
[52:21] you understand when i when we have
[52:24] fellowship
[52:26] together in the light of this age amen
[52:29] it is
[52:29] christ coming together because
[52:32] we are the body of christ amen united
[52:35] together in fellowship
[52:37] under the banner of the word amen and
[52:39] when this body unites it is christ and
[52:41] every member is christ
[52:44] so when i have fellowship with you i'm
[52:46] having fellowship with christ when
[52:47] you're having fellowship with me
[52:49] you're having fellowship with christ and
[52:50] you may see oh this is what this is
[52:53] where we have to go beyond human
[52:55] thinking
[52:55] because you'll see me and you'll see my
[52:57] little mannerisms that i picked up from
[52:59] dad
[53:00] and you'll see my little sense of humor
[53:01] i got from mom and you'll see even some
[53:03] ways that that it's a little bit
[53:05] irritating
[53:08] we'll be honest
[53:12] i wish i liked brother chad but i just
[53:14] wish he wasn't so
[53:19] every once in a while it just gets on my
[53:21] nerves
[53:26] i use me because if i use somebody else
[53:27] i'd be in big trouble
[53:30] but you can use your imagination
[53:34] but you see what i'm saying we see the
[53:36] flesh part
[53:37] that come through hybridization that
[53:39] come from a mom and dad
[53:40] we can see you you can see there's a
[53:42] little bit of irritability there's some
[53:44] irresponsibility here there's a
[53:45] flightiness in here there's a dogmatism
[53:48] there
[53:52] and we see those things amen but you got
[53:54] to realize
[53:56] that package is packaged because of the
[53:58] fall
[54:00] but there's another life inside that
[54:02] wants to bloom out in that package
[54:06] and take control and we've got to move
[54:09] beyond
[54:10] all the little things of the flesh we've
[54:11] got to go deeper and say that's my
[54:13] brother
[54:14] if that was on my brother then we were
[54:16] in god
[54:17] in the beginning and when god's thoughts
[54:19] were material and real
[54:21] him and i were shouting together she and
[54:24] i were shouting
[54:25] when we saw the plan of redemption when
[54:27] we had a conference with god
[54:28] in the mind of god as attributes of god
[54:30] we were shouting together
[54:32] amen we come from the same place we're
[54:34] part of the same material
[54:36] we are part of the same thing the same
[54:38] substance
[54:41] and if god allowed this hybridization to
[54:44] bring this one down
[54:45] and this one's a little more dogmatic
[54:47] and this one is is a little short with
[54:49] the fuse and this one's a little flighty
[54:53] then god wants to use it for a purpose
[54:55] there's something he wants to display
[54:57] he wants to display it here and here and
[54:58] here amen and he's still going to have
[55:01] his way through
[55:02] everything because it's the attributes
[55:03] of god coming up through
[55:07] and so we have god what does god want
[55:09] god
[55:10] wants a family of god on earth
[55:11] fellowshipping with one another
[55:13] and that fellowship is based on walking
[55:15] in the light as he is in the light
[55:17] brings us into this fellowship together
[55:19] and now we realize
[55:21] that you are part of me and i'm part of
[55:23] you that's why jesus could say in that
[55:25] day you'll know that i am you you and me
[55:27] i am the father of the father and me
[55:30] well listen if you can take yourself and
[55:33] put yourself
[55:34] let's just say i'm going to put myself
[55:36] in that equation
[55:38] i in you you and me i and the father
[55:40] father and me brother i said making them
[55:42] all one
[55:45] well if brother bran and brian can put
[55:47] himself in the same place
[55:50] then where's he and where am i
[55:54] and who's he and who am i now if i'm
[55:57] looking at the outer man i'm looking at
[55:58] two different people
[55:59] but if i'm going to the root amen if i'm
[56:02] tracing the root of this organism all
[56:04] the way back
[56:04] i'm looking at one life amen one eternal
[56:08] life from one eternal source with one
[56:10] plan of god amen we are part of the same
[56:13] thing
[56:14] which will be the family of god manifest
[56:17] in different manifestations upon this
[56:19] earth and perfection
[56:22] and then that thing about me that used
[56:23] to irritate you will not irritate you in
[56:25] the new heavens and new earth
[56:27] because god will finally have polished
[56:29] it clear out of me
[56:32] so you better start loving me now
[56:37] that's why fellowship is so critical
[56:39] friends because when we reject
[56:40] fellowship and run off by ourselves
[56:42] we are actually rejecting the body of
[56:44] christ
[56:46] and when we want to say you know this
[56:48] this and that that just forget
[56:50] all of the little nuances and all of the
[56:52] little attitudes and all the little
[56:54] forget all of that and go deeper this is
[56:56] my brother this is my sister
[56:58] at some point none of these things will
[57:00] matter anyways
[57:02] at some point our little different ideas
[57:05] and our little differences
[57:06] they will not matter at some point but
[57:09] that is my brother that is my sister
[57:11] i will embrace them as part of christ
[57:19] and when we dismiss fellowship you know
[57:22] sometimes
[57:23] you listen the reality is we can get our
[57:26] feelings hurt
[57:28] it can i'd rather say will
[57:32] have and will and will again.
[57:36] i mean this is a this is a human life in
[57:38] a fallen outer man
[57:40] you can get your feelings here things
[57:42] can go different to your liking
[57:44] you can have people step on you not even
[57:46] be intentionally maybe or maybe it was
[57:48] intentionally it doesn't matter
[57:49] whatever happens but the devil is trying
[57:52] to pull us away from fellowship and get
[57:54] us over in isolation all by ourselves
[57:56] and then then we begin begin to believe
[57:58] all kinds of lies that way
[58:00] we begin to believe lies like like
[58:03] they're all wrong
[58:04] i'm the only one who knows and they
[58:05] don't see it
[58:10] but god has got a body on this earth
[58:15] and these attributes should be connected
[58:18] in fellowship
[58:20] because it's part of the same body
[58:24] we need one another we need to
[58:28] hold on to one another embrace one
[58:30] another
[58:32] because it's not just you
[58:36] the outer exterior flesh but there's
[58:39] something
[58:39] in you that i love there's something
[58:42] in you that i love with without emotion
[58:48] it brings emotion but there's something
[58:49] that's agape love there's something
[58:50] that's high
[58:51] there's something in you i love because
[58:53] whatever it is that's in you
[58:54] i loved when we were together
[58:58] existing as real in the thoughts of god
[59:02] you and i were standing next to each
[59:04] other and we loved each other there
[59:06] [Music]
[59:08] and that's why we have the ability to
[59:10] love each other here
[59:11] amen because we can go deeper than the
[59:13] skin deeper than the mind
[59:15] deeper than all those things and i can
[59:16] see there's a life in there
[59:18] amen it's the same life that i have
[59:21] it comes from the same source we have
[59:23] the same father we're part of the same
[59:25] family
[59:26] we're both walking in the light as he is
[59:28] in the light amen that puts us in
[59:30] fellowship together
[59:31] as the attributes of god fellowshipping
[59:33] on the earth
[59:35] listen that's what his purpose was from
[59:38] the beginning
[59:39] why can't we start fellowshipping on the
[59:41] earth now
[59:44] attributes of god in fellowship walking
[59:46] in the light as he is in life
[59:47] embracing one another amen as as
[59:50] both being part of the same thing
[59:55] praise god in the message sirs we would
[59:59] see jesus from 64. he says now
[1:00:02] if you were in his thinking at the
[1:00:03] beginning if you've got eternal life
[1:00:05] there is only one form of eternal life
[1:00:08] eternal life had no beginning and it has
[1:00:10] no ending
[1:00:10] so if you have eternal life you were an
[1:00:12] attribute of god's thinking before there
[1:00:14] was anything
[1:00:15] but him
[1:00:18] you understand that brother branham said
[1:00:22] at this stage he wasn't even god yet
[1:00:25] because god is an object of worship
[1:00:29] i mean he was the same person he was the
[1:00:30] same substance but he didn't have the
[1:00:32] title
[1:00:35] before there was angels to worship and
[1:00:37] before he had the title of god
[1:00:39] you were there
[1:00:43] so tell me what can take you away from
[1:00:46] your position
[1:00:49] what demon you were before demons
[1:00:55] you were before lucifer
[1:00:59] you understand there's no force that can
[1:01:02] remove you
[1:01:03] from the love of christ from the love of
[1:01:05] god that's in christ jesus there's no
[1:01:07] force there's no demon power there's no
[1:01:09] foreseen or unseen
[1:01:11] that can separate you away amen because
[1:01:13] you were chosen in him before the
[1:01:15] foundation of the world
[1:01:16] that is secure his love was set his love
[1:01:19] was secure
[1:01:19] that is the expression of his grace
[1:01:25] so don't say something different than
[1:01:27] that
[1:01:31] can anything separate us from the love
[1:01:32] of god
[1:01:34] well the next time you mess up
[1:01:38] and condemnation comes you did this and
[1:01:41] you did that
[1:01:41] and you did that we start to believe
[1:01:44] that our
[1:01:45] conduct has separated us from the love
[1:01:47] of god
[1:01:50] you understand we begin to believe in
[1:01:54] our minds
[1:01:55] that because of this action in this
[1:01:57] action in this section i have separated
[1:01:59] myself from the love of god
[1:02:03] the love of god was set before the
[1:02:05] foundation of the world before you did
[1:02:07] right or wrong he said east so have i
[1:02:09] love
[1:02:09] or jacob have i loved and esau have i
[1:02:12] hated
[1:02:13] before either was born before either had
[1:02:15] a chance to do good or evil
[1:02:19] so don't don't change the word of god
[1:02:22] amen by your own wrong thinking amen
[1:02:25] your actions aren't separating from you
[1:02:27] the love of god the love of god is fixed
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:29] your actions are putting you outside of
[1:02:31] blessings they're causing you to remove
[1:02:33] yourself from the word
[1:02:34] and remove yourself from the source of
[1:02:36] blessings but it's not changing the love
[1:02:37] of god
[1:02:38] or your position in god
[1:02:43] so what do you do brother chad repent
[1:02:47] repent say god that was wrong i'm sorry
[1:02:50] i shouldn't have done that
[1:02:51] but don't lose your sonship over it
[1:02:54] don't throw away all the promises in the
[1:02:56] bible don't lose your security
[1:02:58] that was revealed in the seals amen
[1:03:00] don't re don't lose the rejoicing the
[1:03:02] shouting
[1:03:03] the clapping the singing when you see
[1:03:05] the plan of salvation
[1:03:06] don't lose that fellowship you had with
[1:03:08] god from before the foundation of the
[1:03:09] world
[1:03:10] don't lose that joy that thrilled your
[1:03:12] heart at the opening of the seals
[1:03:15] what thrilled you at the opening of the
[1:03:16] seals what was it that was so exciting
[1:03:18] was it that you now knew what a white
[1:03:20] horse was
[1:03:23] i now know what i want whoa i'm a new
[1:03:26] man
[1:03:28] what changed you is you realize that
[1:03:30] this revelation coming to you was
[1:03:31] calling your name
[1:03:32] that you believed it and he was saying
[1:03:34] you're part of this you're the name that
[1:03:36] was there
[1:03:37] all of these things i'm showing you what
[1:03:38] i've done how i've redeemed my whole
[1:03:40] plan because now i've come to the
[1:03:42] end of that plan and i'm showing you
[1:03:44] what the plan was
[1:03:46] so that i can open the book and show you
[1:03:48] your name is on this book
[1:03:49] that's what thrilled our hearts at the
[1:03:51] opening of the seals
[1:03:55] don't let anything change how can you
[1:03:57] change that you can't
[1:03:58] change what's in that book
[1:04:04] so
[1:04:07] just stick with the word just believe
[1:04:11] what he said
[1:04:12] say what the tapes say say it
[1:04:16] i mean if they hook you to a lie
[1:04:17] detector and the lie detector goes off
[1:04:19] red red red red red he's lying
[1:04:21] i'd say it anyways
[1:04:26] i believe that word before i believe my
[1:04:28] own thoughts and my own flesh body
[1:04:30] and my own ability to perspirate and get
[1:04:32] nervous when i begin to say things the
[1:04:34] word is still true
[1:04:35] regardless of my reaction regardless of
[1:04:37] my thoughts regardless of my mind
[1:04:39] the word is true always true always will
[1:04:41] be true
[1:04:42] i want to say what the tapes say i want
[1:04:44] to say what the scriptures say
[1:04:45] and not say what i'm feeling right now
[1:04:49] because if you wait 15 minutes your
[1:04:51] feelings will change amen but this word
[1:04:53] will never change
[1:04:55] god's feeling for you won't change his
[1:04:57] love for you won't change
[1:04:58] your position in him won't change but
[1:05:00] your feelings will change your thoughts
[1:05:02] will change
[1:05:03] your understanding will change
[1:05:07] so stick with the word
[1:05:12] praise god we're still reading in sirs
[1:05:14] we would see jesus from 1964.
[1:05:17] i said this is review there's a lot of
[1:05:18] review but this is so important friends
[1:05:21] this is a revelation this is something
[1:05:23] we've heard and heard and heard
[1:05:25] but the implication has got to change
[1:05:27] our lives
[1:05:28] the implication has got to be manifest
[1:05:30] in the way we speak
[1:05:31] and the way we act and the way we view
[1:05:33] things around us this
[1:05:35] this is statements with implications the
[1:05:37] implications have to become tangible
[1:05:40] it's got to it's got to stop being
[1:05:41] conceptual it's going to stop being an
[1:05:44] idea that's exciting it's going to stop
[1:05:46] being something brother branham said
[1:05:47] that i can say amen to or the preacher
[1:05:48] gets everybody riled up by saying these
[1:05:50] things
[1:05:50] it's got to move from conceptual a
[1:05:52] thrilling concept it's got to be
[1:05:54] tangible in our lives where i say
[1:05:56] that's me that's the truth that's the
[1:05:58] reality and everything else is a lie
[1:06:01] so we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it
[1:06:03] and we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it
[1:06:05] till something inside clicks and say
[1:06:07] that's not a neat idea
[1:06:08] that's who i am
[1:06:12] it's not a neat concept it's not
[1:06:13] something i say amen to it's exciting
[1:06:15] it is something that's real inside of me
[1:06:22] praise god he says your form your shape
[1:06:26] and what you're
[1:06:27] in now is just a negative when you come
[1:06:30] up to round 20
[1:06:31] 22 years old you were a negative and
[1:06:34] death develops now listen
[1:06:36] i don't want to contradict brother
[1:06:37] branham but i started losing my hair
[1:06:39] when i was 19.
[1:06:43] 22 is not a good number for me
[1:06:48] but the point is what you were at your
[1:06:50] best
[1:06:52] in perfection
[1:06:55] it's just a negative and
[1:06:58] death develops the picture to the
[1:06:59] positive
[1:07:02] that when this earthly tabernacle be
[1:07:04] dissolved we have one
[1:07:05] already waiting
[1:07:08] this life was just a negative reflecting
[1:07:11] that one
[1:07:13] and the negative was made off the
[1:07:15] positive
[1:07:16] in god's mind
[1:07:20] and it's come down here in the negative
[1:07:22] form and it's going through the dark
[1:07:24] room process right now
[1:07:26] amen and after it passes through the
[1:07:28] darkroom process amen
[1:07:30] it'll be formed into the positive image
[1:07:32] of the positive thought
[1:07:35] and i will go to my theophany
[1:07:40] he said now this just to display now it
[1:07:44] shows
[1:07:45] what's being done like god becoming god
[1:07:47] when he created angels he becomes son
[1:07:49] when he created christ jesus
[1:07:51] he becomes savior when jesus died he
[1:07:53] becomes healer when he is wounded for
[1:07:55] our transgressions with the stripes we
[1:07:56] were healed see
[1:07:57] all these things are attributes of god
[1:07:59] just so that in the
[1:08:01] end the bible said jesus said you will
[1:08:03] know that i am in the father
[1:08:04] the father and me i and you and you and
[1:08:07] me
[1:08:08] it's god becoming tangible
[1:08:14] next time you hug your brother
[1:08:18] oh it may be in a negative form it may
[1:08:22] have not come to the positive form yet
[1:08:24] it may have not gone through the process
[1:08:25] to go back amen to the positive form
[1:08:28] but in its negative form it's god
[1:08:30] becoming
[1:08:31] tangible that's why
[1:08:35] we have to be so careful what we say
[1:08:36] about a brother and sister
[1:08:40] so very careful
[1:08:44] we have to be careful how we treat one
[1:08:45] another how we speak about one another
[1:08:47] and when we embrace one another we have
[1:08:48] to realize this is part of god becoming
[1:08:50] tangible
[1:08:54] it's god becoming tangible your own wife
[1:08:56] you and your husband is just a shadow
[1:08:58] and negative of god and his wife
[1:08:59] the church see it's just god's attribute
[1:09:02] being displayed in shadows and types
[1:09:04] like the old testament was to the new
[1:09:06] then in the end it all winds up
[1:09:08] god tangible god in christ tangible made
[1:09:11] flesh god dwelt among
[1:09:12] us and in that great millennium to come
[1:09:16] god in the form of christ sits upon the
[1:09:17] throne of david and the church's bride
[1:09:20] husband
[1:09:20] and wife together all tangible
[1:09:26] now let's turn i want to read a
[1:09:27] scripture here out ephesians chapter 3
[1:09:29] together and this ephesians chapter 3 is
[1:09:33] a unique scripture
[1:09:34] and i've read it many many times and
[1:09:36] pondered over and looked at it but now
[1:09:39] just by the grace of god i just see it
[1:09:41] differently
[1:09:44] ephesians 3 and 8.
[1:09:52] unto me whom less than the least of all
[1:09:55] saints is this grace given that i should
[1:09:57] preach among the gentiles
[1:09:59] the unsearchable riches of christ and to
[1:10:01] make all men
[1:10:02] see what is the fellowship of the
[1:10:04] mystery
[1:10:05] which from the beginning of the world
[1:10:07] has been hidden god who created all
[1:10:08] things by jesus christ
[1:10:10] so there's a fellowship or there's a
[1:10:12] joint participation
[1:10:14] there there is a a shared part
[1:10:17] in this fellowship this fellowship of
[1:10:19] the mystery
[1:10:20] or of the secret that was in god from
[1:10:22] the beginning
[1:10:24] so you have a part of that fellowship
[1:10:27] so make all men see what is the
[1:10:28] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:10:30] beginning of the world
[1:10:31] has been hidden god who created all
[1:10:33] things by jesus christ
[1:10:34] to the intent that now unto the
[1:10:36] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:10:38] places
[1:10:39] might be known by the church to manifold
[1:10:41] wisdom of god
[1:10:43] now i i struggled with this verse verse
[1:10:46] 10 because of the way it's worded it's
[1:10:48] very complicated
[1:10:50] but but by the grace of god i see the
[1:10:52] understanding of it now
[1:10:54] to the intent that now unto the prince
[1:10:55] of eyes and powers in heavenly places
[1:10:57] might be known by the church the
[1:10:59] manifold wisdom of god
[1:11:01] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:11:03] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[1:11:06] and what what this verse is actually
[1:11:07] saying if we if we go back and we look
[1:11:10] at in the literal greek you begin to
[1:11:12] understand
[1:11:14] first i want to interpret a word for you
[1:11:18] verse 9 is the fellowship of the mystery
[1:11:21] which from the beginning of the world
[1:11:23] that world means ages and be from the
[1:11:26] beginning of the ages
[1:11:28] have been hidden god who created all
[1:11:29] things by christ jesus
[1:11:31] to the intent that now unto
[1:11:32] principalities this word principalities
[1:11:35] means
[1:11:35] beginnings or origins or or
[1:11:38] the first or that which was in the
[1:11:40] beginning
[1:11:42] and powers means jurisdiction or
[1:11:44] rulership
[1:11:45] in heaven so to the originals to the
[1:11:49] beginning the first
[1:11:51] those with jurisdiction in heaven might
[1:11:53] be known by the church
[1:11:55] the manifold wisdom of god that means
[1:11:58] maybe known by the church
[1:12:00] the literal word means through the
[1:12:01] church
[1:12:03] that now what god is doing through the
[1:12:06] church
[1:12:06] is revealing the manifold wisdom of god
[1:12:09] to principalities and powers in heavens
[1:12:12] this was a secret even in heaven
[1:12:16] brother branham said he said the angels
[1:12:18] didn't even know this
[1:12:19] i mean they didn't know what the seventh
[1:12:21] seal was it was a total secret
[1:12:22] but now is being revealed through or by
[1:12:25] the church the manifold wisdom of god
[1:12:27] and who is catching this manifold wisdom
[1:12:30] principalities and powers in heavens
[1:12:32] what's happening on earth amen is is
[1:12:35] reflecting in heaven
[1:12:36] what's happening on earth is part of a
[1:12:38] redemption cycle amen that's reconciling
[1:12:41] earth
[1:12:41] and heaven so it's not
[1:12:45] it's not that the church is catching the
[1:12:47] manifold wisdom but
[1:12:48] through the church is the manifold
[1:12:50] wisdom being expressed
[1:12:51] to principalities and powers in heavens
[1:12:56] because they couldn't imagine him doing
[1:12:58] it this way
[1:13:01] they couldn't imagine him being so
[1:13:03] humble amen they couldn't imagine him
[1:13:05] doing his way
[1:13:05] to manifest his wisdom this great secret
[1:13:08] that god kept in himself
[1:13:09] and we know that that revelation was
[1:13:11] jesus christ
[1:13:12] and we know that he come down as a baby
[1:13:14] in a manger and they were awed by that
[1:13:16] and he was beaten and he was slain amen
[1:13:19] but the most amazing part was that he
[1:13:21] would take from himself and form a bride
[1:13:24] and then he would allow that bride to go
[1:13:26] through the church ages and at the end
[1:13:28] he would come down himself
[1:13:29] into that bride form amen so that he
[1:13:31] could unite the two back together
[1:13:33] amen this is the manifold wisdom of god
[1:13:35] that's being revealed through the church
[1:13:37] [Applause]
[1:13:39] and heaven didn't even know it
[1:13:43] and now it's being manifest by the
[1:13:46] church
[1:13:47] the manifold wisdom of god how god will
[1:13:49] come in humility
[1:13:50] how god will come down amen through his
[1:13:53] attributes because he'll never
[1:13:54] lose himself he can send it in weakness
[1:13:57] he can send in humility
[1:13:59] he can send it in a broken condition he
[1:14:01] can send it in such a way that nobody
[1:14:03] will believe that this is god this is an
[1:14:06] attribute of god and this is god
[1:14:07] bringing about a reconciliation he can
[1:14:09] do it that way because
[1:14:10] god knows what he is and he knows where
[1:14:13] his seed in germa is
[1:14:14] and that will never be lost because it's
[1:14:16] a part of god
[1:14:19] and god can sow it into absolute
[1:14:23] weakness
[1:14:27] in an absolute weakness
[1:14:30] he can overcome and reconcile
[1:14:34] all things into jesus christ
[1:14:38] so now what are we doing manifesting
[1:14:42] the manifold wisdom of god in what form
[1:14:47] in bride form
[1:14:50] god had a secret he had a secret
[1:14:55] he showed it from the beginning in the
[1:14:57] garden of eden
[1:14:59] but that plan that secret amen he's been
[1:15:02] unfolding now
[1:15:03] for thousands of years but he's revealed
[1:15:06] that secret to you and i
[1:15:09] he says in
[1:15:13] the smyrnan church age now then
[1:15:16] here we are coming to a conclusion as
[1:15:19] the eternal logos god was manifest in
[1:15:21] the sun
[1:15:22] and in jesus what all the fullness of
[1:15:23] the godhead bodily and that eternal one
[1:15:26] was the father manifesting flesh and
[1:15:28] thereby gain the title of son
[1:15:30] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[1:15:32] our turn became the many members spoken
[1:15:34] word
[1:15:35] seed just like he became seed and son
[1:15:39] we became spoken word seed and son but i
[1:15:42] want you to understand
[1:15:43] spoken word though now manifest in the
[1:15:46] flesh are the
[1:15:47] those eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:15:49] the flesh are sons of god
[1:15:50] even as we are so called
[1:15:54] amen i want to i want to read another
[1:15:55] quote then i want to go to revelation
[1:15:57] 10. now compare god's eden to satan's
[1:15:59] now after 6 000 years of perverting of
[1:16:01] the true interpretation of god's
[1:16:03] promised word to the age
[1:16:05] let's compare it now and see where we
[1:16:06] get like he did to the church
[1:16:08] in christ's time in jesus trying to keep
[1:16:11] back god's loyal sons from knowing the
[1:16:13] truth
[1:16:13] that's that that's god's god put his
[1:16:16] sons here his attributes
[1:16:17] to fellowship with him by hearing the
[1:16:20] word
[1:16:24] catch that i want to fellowship with god
[1:16:26] how do you fellowship with god you
[1:16:28] fellowship with him
[1:16:28] by hearing his word
[1:16:32] amen that's why the message in this day
[1:16:34] has restored our fellowship back to god
[1:16:37] because god has revealed his plan of
[1:16:39] redemption god has revealed
[1:16:41] at the opening of the seals his whole
[1:16:42] plan amen and by hearing the word it
[1:16:44] restores us back to fellowship with god
[1:16:47] what's he restoring us back to the same
[1:16:48] kind of fellowship we had
[1:16:50] in his mind when the sons of god shouted
[1:16:52] for joy
[1:16:55] now let's go to revelations chapter 10.
[1:17:09] revelation chapter 10
[1:17:14] and verse 7.
[1:17:18] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:17:20] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:17:21] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:17:23] finished
[1:17:24] as he had declared to his servants the
[1:17:26] prophets
[1:17:28] so in this day of the voice of the
[1:17:30] seventh angel
[1:17:31] we shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:17:34] god
[1:17:35] the mystery of god there's a great
[1:17:37] mystery of god and we have fellowship in
[1:17:39] this mystery
[1:17:40] this is where we fellowship is in this
[1:17:42] mystery in this secret
[1:17:44] that's what brings us together that's
[1:17:45] what unites the attributes and
[1:17:46] fellowship
[1:17:47] sharing a common purpose and a common
[1:17:49] participation is in this mystery
[1:17:52] that is where our fellowship is and he
[1:17:55] says
[1:17:55] in this mystery of god should be
[1:17:57] finished as he had declared to his
[1:17:59] servants
[1:17:59] the prophets this term as he declared to
[1:18:03] his servants to prophets
[1:18:04] his servants the prophets had wrote the
[1:18:06] entire bible
[1:18:09] who wrote the bible the prophets
[1:18:12] so they wrote the entire bible that's
[1:18:14] why when brother branham comes to christ
[1:18:16] is the mystery of god revealed
[1:18:18] he is preaching revelations 10 7 he is
[1:18:20] preaching the seventh seal
[1:18:22] but he says and he's preaching
[1:18:23] revelation 10 7 the mystery of god
[1:18:25] christ
[1:18:26] is the mystery of god revealed so this
[1:18:29] is the revealing of the mystery of god
[1:18:30] and it's going to show christ
[1:18:32] and he says christ and he said in order
[1:18:34] to do this
[1:18:35] i'm going to take from my context the
[1:18:36] entire bible
[1:18:39] what's he doing he's preaching
[1:18:40] revelations 10
[1:18:42] 7. that statement is coming right out of
[1:18:45] revelation 10
[1:18:46] 7 he has to preach the mystery of god
[1:18:49] out of the whole bible because god has
[1:18:50] declared it to the prophets
[1:18:53] so that mystery is laying in this bible
[1:18:56] and that mystery is revealed in christ
[1:18:58] amen and don't forget that you're in
[1:19:00] christ
[1:19:03] that mystery is not just the male part
[1:19:05] but it's the male and female part
[1:19:07] because within
[1:19:08] adam was the woman amen and part of the
[1:19:10] beginning the mystery in the beginning
[1:19:12] the foreshadow
[1:19:13] when he told the end from the beginning
[1:19:15] he had male and female in his son adam
[1:19:18] and in adam was the part that was going
[1:19:20] to come out to manifest woman
[1:19:22] and they were going to be united as one
[1:19:23] flesh and he was declaring the end from
[1:19:25] the beginning
[1:19:26] what is this the mystery of god god
[1:19:29] becoming tangible
[1:19:31] wanting to fellowship as a family upon
[1:19:33] the earth
[1:19:34] what is that that's the seventh seal
[1:19:36] that's the mystery of god
[1:19:38] that's revelation 10 7 and in order to
[1:19:40] preach it he's got to take the whole
[1:19:42] bible
[1:19:42] because he had declared the mystery to
[1:19:44] all the prophets
[1:19:46] he declared the mystery to all the
[1:19:47] prophets but all the prophets didn't
[1:19:49] know what the mystery was
[1:19:53] it was laying in mystery form in the
[1:19:55] bible so a prophet could come at the end
[1:19:57] time
[1:19:58] and he could say there it is in adam and
[1:19:59] eve there it is in ruth and boaz
[1:20:01] there it is amen in rahab there it is in
[1:20:04] tamar
[1:20:05] amen there it is in mary do you see it
[1:20:07] do you see it
[1:20:08] do you see it what is it it's the
[1:20:10] mystery of god
[1:20:12] amen he come forth as his son the last
[1:20:14] adam
[1:20:15] restored the fallen sun redeemed back
[1:20:18] all that adam had lost
[1:20:19] but within him was a woman just like in
[1:20:22] the first time
[1:20:22] and he had to take that woman out she
[1:20:24] had to come into manifestation and he
[1:20:26] had to be united back to her again
[1:20:28] what's he doing he's reconciling back in
[1:20:31] the plan of redemption
[1:20:33] and this is the great mystery of god why
[1:20:36] because it was in this thought from
[1:20:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:39] and you're part of that thought and
[1:20:40] you're part of this plan
[1:20:46] you made a mistake yesterday
[1:20:50] so did i and the day before
[1:20:55] and the day before and the day before
[1:20:59] but how am i going to change this how am
[1:21:02] i going to stop this force from moving
[1:21:04] in my life
[1:21:05] how will i will stop the unstoppable god
[1:21:08] from working his purpose and his plan
[1:21:10] and his own will in my life i just have
[1:21:12] to repent and yield to him and say god i
[1:21:14] want to give you more than i gave you
[1:21:16] the day before
[1:21:17] and tomorrow i want to give you more yet
[1:21:18] lord i don't want this hybrid flesh to
[1:21:20] rule me
[1:21:21] i don't want wrong thoughts i don't want
[1:21:22] to be swayed by the enemy but what i
[1:21:25] want to do is lay my life down i want
[1:21:26] you to have preeminence because i love
[1:21:28] your plan
[1:21:29] i love to be for the foundation the
[1:21:31] world i loved it in the opening of the
[1:21:32] seals and i still love it today
[1:21:35] it's my identification it's who i am
[1:21:37] it's why i'm here
[1:21:39] and i love it just as much as i did when
[1:21:40] i shouted in your mind before the
[1:21:42] foundation of the world
[1:21:44] go on anything i do amen contrary to
[1:21:47] that i hate and i lay it down and say
[1:21:49] god forgive me
[1:21:51] but i'm not giving up what he's given me
[1:21:55] i can't give up what he's given me it
[1:21:58] was his eternal purpose
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:05] brother says i'm going to finish with
[1:22:06] this i don't want to go any further
[1:22:08] we'll pick it up some other time i want
[1:22:10] to finish with this
[1:22:11] and the feast of trump is he says go
[1:22:12] into the prophet's chamber and watch
[1:22:14] them seven steps
[1:22:16] where where did the guard meet the
[1:22:17] challenge to bring the comer
[1:22:20] into the presence of the king at the top
[1:22:22] of the steps
[1:22:23] so at the top of the seventh step on the
[1:22:25] seventh step there's going to be
[1:22:26] somebody who's going to bring the comer
[1:22:28] into the presence of the king
[1:22:30] who's that
[1:22:35] it's the forerunner ministry it's
[1:22:37] eliezer it's the one introducing to
[1:22:39] isaac
[1:22:39] uh he says here now come up the seventh
[1:22:42] step when you come up to the seventh
[1:22:43] step there's a seventh church aged
[1:22:44] messenger
[1:22:45] and now that will bring you into the
[1:22:46] presence of the king how will he bring
[1:22:48] you into the presence of the king
[1:22:50] the king is the word
[1:22:53] the king is the eternal word with the
[1:22:56] eternal purpose
[1:22:57] amen and he brings you into the presence
[1:22:59] of the king by bringing you into the
[1:23:01] revealed word
[1:23:03] and then you meet your bridegroom your
[1:23:04] husband your mate jesus christ the word
[1:23:11] at the top of the steps was in the
[1:23:13] seventh step
[1:23:14] there shows that we've got to come again
[1:23:16] with the same spirit that was on john
[1:23:18] he introduced the messiah he was greater
[1:23:20] than all the prophets he introduced it
[1:23:22] and we've got to come to a place again
[1:23:24] to something that's going to introduce
[1:23:26] the messiah
[1:23:27] what's introducing the messiah bringing
[1:23:29] the person coming to the seventh step
[1:23:30] into the presence of the king
[1:23:34] next paragraph and how will the messiah
[1:23:36] how will the people that believe him
[1:23:38] know it
[1:23:38] unless they're constantly in the word
[1:23:42] to know what he is daniel said the wise
[1:23:44] shall know but the foolish the unwise
[1:23:45] wouldn't know
[1:23:46] they shall know their god now now now he
[1:23:49] shall appear
[1:23:50] in the last days is to bring the people
[1:23:52] back to the word
[1:23:54] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:23:57] know her mate
[1:23:58] the revealed word
[1:24:01] how are you going to have fellowship
[1:24:03] with god by hearing his word
[1:24:06] how are you going to be united into the
[1:24:07] fellowship you had before the foundation
[1:24:09] of the world
[1:24:10] by the revealing of the word will bring
[1:24:12] you in contact with your bridegroom with
[1:24:14] your may
[1:24:15] with your husband the revealed word
[1:24:17] it'll bring you into the presence of the
[1:24:18] king
[1:24:19] it'll not unite you back to who you
[1:24:21] really are
[1:24:23] and bring us back to the basis of
[1:24:26] fellowship we had there
[1:24:29] and that should bring us to fellowship
[1:24:31] with one another
[1:24:34] see we can try to manufacture fellowship
[1:24:38] we need to have a fellowship meeting and
[1:24:39] we had more we need more fellowship in
[1:24:41] the church and
[1:24:42] and so we need more fellowship in the
[1:24:44] church so we're going to have a
[1:24:45] volleyball contest
[1:24:50] that's not fellowship that's friendship
[1:24:53] that's fine there's not
[1:24:54] i'm not against friendship but let's not
[1:24:56] call it fellowship that's not fellowship
[1:24:59] fellowship is walking in the light as he
[1:25:01] is in the light
[1:25:03] brings us back into that unity with our
[1:25:05] bright our
[1:25:06] our bridegroom our mate the revealed
[1:25:08] word and that's what brings us together
[1:25:10] in fellowship friends
[1:25:13] the friendship is part of it the the
[1:25:15] knowing one another caring for one
[1:25:17] another
[1:25:18] amen that's all part of it amen but the
[1:25:20] real fellowship between the attributes
[1:25:22] of god is
[1:25:23] fellowship on the revealed word
[1:25:26] fellowship with god is hearing his word
[1:25:29] fellowship with christ is coming to
[1:25:31] christ your mate the revealed word
[1:25:33] fellowship with one another is when we
[1:25:35] meet each other there
[1:25:40] i hope you understand that if we got
[1:25:44] the only way to have fellowship is to
[1:25:45] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:25:47] you can't manufacture it you can't make
[1:25:49] it happen it happens
[1:25:51] amen if you unite with christ and i
[1:25:53] unite with christ
[1:25:54] guess what we're going to have
[1:25:56] fellowship
[1:25:58] you go up through that seventh step and
[1:26:00] you get ushered in amen by
[1:26:02] by by eliezer into the presence of the
[1:26:05] king
[1:26:05] guess what that's where i'm at
[1:26:09] hey brother you're here amen we're
[1:26:12] sitting here
[1:26:13] united with the king we're sitting here
[1:26:14] talking to the king together
[1:26:16] that's the basis for our fellowship
[1:26:18] friends that's the basis for fellowship
[1:26:20] in our homes that's basis for fellowship
[1:26:22] in our marriages that's the basis for
[1:26:23] fellowship in our church
[1:26:26] is to get united in christ amen to be
[1:26:29] part of the fellowship of this great
[1:26:31] mystery
[1:26:33] that unites us together with an eternal
[1:26:35] bond
[1:26:37] the things that are only temporal the
[1:26:40] things that are only earthly
[1:26:42] they'll fall away but these bonds that
[1:26:46] are eternal that go back to the mind of
[1:26:48] god
[1:26:48] they'll stay
[1:26:52] you have a marriage that has that kind
[1:26:53] of fellowship where both the husband and
[1:26:55] the wife
[1:26:56] are linked to christ have been ushered
[1:26:58] through the seventh step into the
[1:26:59] chamber
[1:27:00] of the king i'm telling you they'll
[1:27:02] weather every storm friends
[1:27:05] they will weather every storm it doesn't
[1:27:07] mean that on the friendship
[1:27:09] side and then the outside man it doesn't
[1:27:10] mean there won't be turmoil or conflict
[1:27:12] or difficulty or
[1:27:13] or he said she said your mom your mom i
[1:27:16] mean
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:21] sorry but that's the reality
[1:27:26] but if the fellowship is only based on
[1:27:29] those things that fellowship will go up
[1:27:30] and down and up and down and up and down
[1:27:33] but if you take two people who've made
[1:27:35] it into the inner chamber
[1:27:38] amen they may still have family
[1:27:40] pressures and outside pressures and
[1:27:41] financial pressures and disagreements
[1:27:43] and
[1:27:44] that's all fine but they will weather
[1:27:46] every storm because they have true
[1:27:47] fellowship
[1:27:49] you take a church and the people in the
[1:27:51] church that are in harmony with the word
[1:27:52] amen they've all entered into the inner
[1:27:54] chamber amen you're going to have
[1:27:56] fellowship you don't have to manufacture
[1:27:58] it it will be there
[1:28:00] you do the same thing in your home with
[1:28:01] your children amen you can't manufacture
[1:28:04] it you love them you take care of them
[1:28:05] but if they start to enter into the
[1:28:07] place you're you're going to have
[1:28:08] fellowship for the rest of your lives
[1:28:13] this is the basis for fellowship
[1:28:16] going in to the inner chamber together
[1:28:21] finding ourselves as joint participants
[1:28:24] and the same thing in the same mystery
[1:28:28] participating in the community of the
[1:28:30] same thing we each have our own part
[1:28:33] but we have our part of the same thing
[1:28:37] i'm going to finish reading this quote
[1:28:38] to feast the trumpets
[1:28:43] so the bride will know her husband know
[1:28:45] her mate the revealed word that's why
[1:28:47] this has to happen
[1:28:48] it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in
[1:28:50] luther wesley and in pentecost and them
[1:28:52] scripture says it wasn't
[1:28:54] but it will come that is his promise for
[1:28:57] this age we're living in this age that
[1:28:59] is coming will be
[1:29:00] in she must be identified in him
[1:29:04] any woman must be identified with her
[1:29:05] husband for the two or one
[1:29:07] and christ's bride has to be identified
[1:29:09] with him for the two or one
[1:29:11] and he is the word not the
[1:29:12] denominational the word
[1:29:14] we are to be children of the light and
[1:29:16] the light is the word which is made
[1:29:17] light for this age
[1:29:19] how do we know light except it comes
[1:29:21] from the word all right the word made
[1:29:23] flesh
[1:29:24] is the light of the age when you see it
[1:29:26] and the bible said so
[1:29:29] so if you walk in the lightest he is in
[1:29:31] the light your fellowship with one
[1:29:32] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:29:34] will cleanse you from all sins
[1:29:36] but the word made flesh is the light of
[1:29:39] the age
[1:29:40] what is the word made flesh
[1:29:48] can you raise your hand are you the
[1:29:51] light of the age
[1:29:52] are you the word made flesh are you that
[1:29:55] thought that he had before the
[1:29:56] foundation of the world of a bride in
[1:29:58] this end time
[1:29:59] is that you is that attribute inside of
[1:30:01] you that portion of him that he
[1:30:03] portioned to be here in this day
[1:30:04] to be that part of the word made
[1:30:06] manifest in a bride in jesus christ in
[1:30:09] the formation of the bride can you say
[1:30:10] i'm part of that
[1:30:13] that is the that is the light of the age
[1:30:16] that is the word made manifest that is
[1:30:17] the light of the age amen and if you
[1:30:19] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:30:23] you have fellowship with one another i
[1:30:26] tell you friends i'm happy with this
[1:30:28] fellowship that we have
[1:30:30] i don't want to manufactured i don't
[1:30:32] want to put on i don't want to make
[1:30:34] believe
[1:30:34] but i want the real fellowship that goes
[1:30:36] all the way down to the core
[1:30:38] so that when i irritate you so bad
[1:30:42] and you irritate me we'll just flip it
[1:30:46] now
[1:30:48] we're not going anywhere because we're
[1:30:50] in the same inner chamber
[1:30:52] we're part of the same program we're in
[1:30:54] the same fellowship of the mystery
[1:30:56] we were in his mind we were the one in
[1:30:58] his mind that when he laid out the plan
[1:31:00] he said this group over here
[1:31:03] i'm holding you now i'm just dramatizing
[1:31:05] okay
[1:31:07] i'm holding you back for the last
[1:31:12] here's my plan for you he showed him the
[1:31:14] plan
[1:31:16] you'll be this and you'll be that and i
[1:31:18] want you to go down and i want you to go
[1:31:20] at the very end
[1:31:23] and i want you to have a unique
[1:31:25] manifestation
[1:31:28] and guess what friends you were there
[1:31:30] and i was there
[1:31:32] that puts us in a bond of fellowship
[1:31:34] that can't be broken
[1:31:38] when we disagree we agreed there
[1:31:43] if we disagree today on what color to
[1:31:45] paint a wall
[1:31:46] it won't change the agreement we had
[1:31:48] there
[1:31:50] it won't change the agreement that we
[1:31:51] have in our hearts amen that this is
[1:31:53] christ and we love him and he's our mate
[1:31:55] he's your mate and he's my mate that
[1:31:57] makes you and i
[1:31:58] connected he's my husband and he's your
[1:32:01] husband that makes you and i
[1:32:02] connected he's my lover and your lover
[1:32:05] he's my king and your king amen i meet
[1:32:07] him in the inner chamber you meet him in
[1:32:09] the inner chamber that makes you and i
[1:32:11] won amen
[1:32:14] makes him the whole thing
[1:32:18] praise god
[1:32:23] this is finish this is finishing up in
[1:32:25] god's power to transform many times
[1:32:27] man said well now man wrote this bible
[1:32:29] no the bible says itself that god wrote
[1:32:31] the bible
[1:32:32] it's the word of god and it never can
[1:32:34] fail jesus said heavens and earth will
[1:32:35] fail pass away but my word shall never
[1:32:38] fail
[1:32:38] and it cannot fail in being god because
[1:32:41] it's part of him
[1:32:42] and then you being you being a son or
[1:32:44] daughter you are part of it
[1:32:46] and that makes you a part of him so
[1:32:49] that's why we come together
[1:32:50] that's why we come to fellowship
[1:32:52] together around the word of
[1:32:54] god why do we fellowship you're part of
[1:32:57] him
[1:32:57] i'm part of him this is him
[1:33:02] this is the basis of our fellowship
[1:33:05] we fellowship with god by hearing his
[1:33:07] word we fellowship with one another by
[1:33:09] uniting with that word
[1:33:10] you're the word i'm the word he's the
[1:33:12] word
[1:33:16] he's the word you're the word i'm the
[1:33:18] word
[1:33:20] i and you you and me i in him
[1:33:23] he and me father me i am the father i
[1:33:25] and you you're making them all one
[1:33:27] where do you find yourself in that
[1:33:29] equation wherever you find yourself
[1:33:30] is where i find myself and that puts me
[1:33:33] and you together as one
[1:33:37] that's why i love you that's why you
[1:33:41] love me
[1:33:42] not because we always are in perfect
[1:33:44] agreement on
[1:33:45] every decision not because we don't have
[1:33:47] flesh and we don't have
[1:33:49] characteristics but we love one another
[1:33:51] because we
[1:33:52] are united together in an inseparable
[1:33:54] bond that we can't get away from each
[1:33:56] other
[1:33:58] and i like it that way
[1:34:01] god is good let's all stand musicians if
[1:34:03] you come i'm just going to stop i just
[1:34:05] feel to stop right there
[1:34:07] i don't want to get in anything else i'd
[1:34:09] like to stop with us loving each other
[1:34:14] inseparable and united together and
[1:34:16] loving one another through a bond that
[1:34:18] cannot be broken
[1:34:21] that's why john would say by all this
[1:34:24] but jesus would say
[1:34:25] well this they will know you're my
[1:34:26] disciples we have loved one for another
[1:34:28] and john said my little children love
[1:34:29] each other
[1:34:30] with a fervent love i don't think he's
[1:34:34] telling you to manufacture anything i
[1:34:35] think it's an outcrop
[1:34:36] of realizing who we are i think it comes
[1:34:40] why is it when you meet a new believer
[1:34:42] and you sit down and you start to talk
[1:34:43] to them
[1:34:44] all of a sudden it doesn't take you very
[1:34:46] long and you it feels
[1:34:48] like they're family it feels like
[1:34:51] i have always known this person all of
[1:34:53] my life where did i meet him how do i
[1:34:55] know him
[1:34:56] how do i know her she's i know i know
[1:34:59] her
[1:35:01] she would've never met we never met were
[1:35:03] you over here no i wasn't there i was at
[1:35:05] did you go to that camp no i wasn't
[1:35:06] there how do we know each other
[1:35:08] because we were there you're in the mind
[1:35:11] of god
[1:35:12] we're linked with the word we come from
[1:35:14] the same family inside we're the same
[1:35:17] thing
[1:35:22] that's what unites us together friends
[1:35:25] if they
[1:35:26] if the government breaks this house
[1:35:28] breaks this building
[1:35:30] closes the doors whatever happens it
[1:35:32] cannot break that fellowship
[1:35:36] amen if we get scattered if the door is
[1:35:38] closed or whatever happens it doesn't
[1:35:40] matter
[1:35:40] he cannot break that fellowship
[1:35:44] and i'll tell you the name on the
[1:35:46] outside of the church can't break that
[1:35:48] fellowship either
[1:35:49] it doesn't matter which one you drive to
[1:35:51] on a sunday morning this fellowship is
[1:35:53] bigger than a church building
[1:35:55] this fellowship is bigger than a
[1:35:56] location this fellowship
[1:35:58] goes all the way back to the mind of god
[1:36:00] and we'll go all the way to new heavens
[1:36:01] and new earth and we'll be dwelling
[1:36:03] together in the new jerusalem amen
[1:36:05] it doesn't matter which building you
[1:36:07] walk into to worship god on sunday amen
[1:36:09] if you
[1:36:10] were there i was there if you'll be
[1:36:11] there i'll be there you and i
[1:36:13] love one another
[1:36:17] i say praise god lord i say give me more
[1:36:19] of that
[1:36:21] more of that don't let me get hung up by
[1:36:23] where somebody drive to church or
[1:36:25] or some little disagreement on the way
[1:36:27] to do this or do that
[1:36:28] amen let me go deeper than that and say
[1:36:31] were you in the mind of god before the
[1:36:32] foundation of the world
[1:36:33] and that brother says yes i said let me
[1:36:35] hug you brother amen
[1:36:42] praise be to god friends that's the
[1:36:44] basis for fellowship
[1:36:48] amen well praise god let's just stop
[1:36:53] let's sing
[1:36:53] brother been saying i'll stop preaching
[1:36:56] as you start saying
[1:36:57] we'll walk in the light
[1:37:03] it's such a beautiful
[1:37:09] comes where the dew drops
[1:37:20] all around us
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:43] it's such a beautiful
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:38:00] oh
[1:38:11] the light of the world
[1:38:17] amen i thought i stopped reaching you
[1:38:20] started singing but
[1:38:22] i got a little something more to say
[1:38:26] so many times what breaks our fellowship
[1:38:31] and causes us to mistrust another
[1:38:33] brother or sister
[1:38:36] is really our own insecurity
[1:38:40] let me just give you an example
[1:38:42] [Music]
[1:38:43] somebody disagrees with you on a
[1:38:45] doctrine in the message
[1:38:48] and they have a a different
[1:38:49] understanding not
[1:38:51] not perverting the word but just a
[1:38:53] different understanding of what brother
[1:38:54] benham said
[1:38:55] if we're not secure in who we are we
[1:38:59] need them to be wrong and in order for
[1:39:02] ourselves to be right
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:04] and that attitude breaks fellowship
[1:39:09] because face it friends we're all
[1:39:10] growing in the knowledge of jesus christ
[1:39:14] we're all seeing the message more
[1:39:15] clearly than we saw it a year before
[1:39:17] there are things that god is continually
[1:39:19] opening to us
[1:39:20] and we're getting clearer understanding
[1:39:22] not changing the whole message but
[1:39:24] clearer understanding of what the
[1:39:25] prophet
[1:39:26] said but so many times we're willing to
[1:39:29] break fellowship
[1:39:30] and and break harmony with other
[1:39:32] believers and
[1:39:33] other churches because well they believe
[1:39:35] this and they believe that
[1:39:38] but you know what i don't care
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:42] because what i believe is based off
[1:39:44] revelation
[1:39:46] well god has revealed to me if we are
[1:39:48] secure in who we are
[1:39:50] there's nothing to fight about
[1:39:54] you don't we don't need for somebody
[1:39:56] else to be wrong even in the church
[1:39:58] sometimes in our own church
[1:39:59] we'll have two ideas on how to manage
[1:40:01] something how to accomplish a task
[1:40:03] amen and all of a sudden we have to make
[1:40:05] one wrong for us to be right
[1:40:07] and then what's worse is with something
[1:40:09] totally natural that doesn't mean
[1:40:10] anything
[1:40:11] amen we'll have to spiritualize it
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:16] trust me friends trust me what to
[1:40:20] spiritualize it to find some spiritual
[1:40:22] reason for why mine's right
[1:40:23] and yours is wrong and you know because
[1:40:26] the devil has this many letters in
[1:40:28] lucifer's name and i
[1:40:32] it all comes off in security
[1:40:36] insecurity where when you're really
[1:40:38] secure in your position with christ
[1:40:40] and then you're really secure in your
[1:40:42] calling and your election
[1:40:44] even if somebody disagrees with you say
[1:40:45] okay
[1:40:47] okay i think we should do that way okay
[1:40:52] and then they're going to look at you
[1:40:54] like you're not going to argue no i'm
[1:40:55] not going to argue if that's the way you
[1:40:56] want to do it do it
[1:40:56] i i personally feel this way but that's
[1:40:59] okay
[1:41:00] when this message well you know brother
[1:41:02] bram said this and it means this
[1:41:03] you've got to see it that way and you
[1:41:05] say okay that's fine
[1:41:08] god bless you brother i love you you're
[1:41:10] not going to fight with me why would i
[1:41:12] fight with you i just see it differently
[1:41:14] but but see if you know that you were
[1:41:17] there in that conference
[1:41:19] if you know you were there if you know
[1:41:22] god is not complete without you
[1:41:25] then even if i got it wrong today
[1:41:29] he has to show it to me right
[1:41:32] if it's imperative that i get the right
[1:41:34] understanding of this
[1:41:35] and i've got it wrong today he'll make
[1:41:37] it right but so many times we fight
[1:41:39] because we feel like i've got to have it
[1:41:41] right in order to be
[1:41:42] right i don't have to have it right to
[1:41:44] be right i was made right before the
[1:41:46] foundation of the world
[1:41:47] i will come out right in the end even if
[1:41:50] my understanding is off
[1:41:51] god will tweak my understanding i don't
[1:41:54] have to fight for anything
[1:41:57] i don't care sharing with you what i
[1:41:58] believe and hearing you share what you
[1:42:00] believe
[1:42:00] amen but the minute you try to force me
[1:42:02] into your mode or i force you into mind
[1:42:04] i mean you're going to break fellowship
[1:42:06] over what
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:11] god's in control my question to you is
[1:42:14] were you in the mind of god before the
[1:42:16] foundations in the world
[1:42:18] did you sing and shout with the sons of
[1:42:20] god
[1:42:22] then you're my brother then you're my
[1:42:24] sister we're going to wind up in the
[1:42:25] same spot
[1:42:28] he said brother chad how can you say
[1:42:29] that what if they're wrong well if
[1:42:30] they're wrong that has nothing
[1:42:32] there's no bearing on me making it there
[1:42:37] and even me telling them even me
[1:42:39] believing or somebody says yeah i was
[1:42:41] there brother i'm a child of god
[1:42:42] even me agreeing with them has no
[1:42:44] bearing on where i'm going
[1:42:46] even if they're wrong even if they're
[1:42:48] lying i'll just take them at their own
[1:42:50] testimony at their own confession
[1:42:51] you're a son of god praise god i love
[1:42:53] you brother
[1:42:56] well what if they're not what if they're
[1:42:58] not
[1:42:59] i mean who cares i'm still going to be
[1:43:01] in the city singing and shouting and
[1:43:03] dancing
[1:43:04] when the king of kings sets upon the
[1:43:05] throne of david it has no bearing on my
[1:43:08] outcome it has no makes no difference on
[1:43:10] my origin
[1:43:11] my origin secured my outcome what am i
[1:43:14] worried about what anybody else
[1:43:16] thinks or believes
[1:43:19] please i mean i hope you understand what
[1:43:21] i'm saying i don't mean to be frivolous
[1:43:23] with that but so many times we break
[1:43:25] fellowship over our own
[1:43:26] insecurity instead of just saying god is
[1:43:28] my god
[1:43:29] he is my father my position is secure if
[1:43:32] i need to know something he'll reveal it
[1:43:34] to me
[1:43:34] if what you're saying is true god will
[1:43:36] confirm it to me
[1:43:38] i don't have to fight to make you wrong
[1:43:39] you don't have to make me wrong
[1:43:42] let's just love each other let's just do
[1:43:45] what john says this is love each other
[1:43:47] with a fervent love
[1:43:49] and let god sort it all out let's stay
[1:43:52] in the word together
[1:43:54] there's so many things that we know are
[1:43:56] true that stay in them
[1:43:58] most of the things we fuss about are
[1:43:59] things that we'll never know anyways
[1:44:03] a piece of this and a piece of that
[1:44:06] let's just say let god reveal it if he
[1:44:08] wants us to know it it'll get clearer
[1:44:10] it'll get clear and clear and clear but
[1:44:12] let's just love each other
[1:44:13] let's stay with the word hey brother are
[1:44:15] you in the inner chamber
[1:44:18] hey sister have you gone beyond the veil
[1:44:21] well praise
[1:44:22] god we're together
[1:44:24] [Music]
[1:44:25] we love each other oh
[1:44:28] i pray that god will give us a security
[1:44:32] a real security in the soul that takes
[1:44:35] away
[1:44:35] all indifference and all just a real
[1:44:37] security and a real
[1:44:39] joy my name was on that lamb's book of
[1:44:43] life and before the foundation of the
[1:44:44] world

[1:46:23] you god for your goodness to us
