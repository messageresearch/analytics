[9:26] this
[9:27] evening dear heavenly father we thank
[9:29] you Lord once again for your privilege
[9:31] that you've given us and God may we
[9:34] always take it as a privilege to gather
[9:36] together and God we've come to sing your
[9:39] Praises but we've come to hear from you
[9:42] now we've entered into that part of the
[9:43] service Lord where we're asking you Lord
[9:46] to come on the scene and break the bread
[9:48] of life may you feed us by your own hand
[9:51] Lord I pray you would take this vessel
[9:53] to mine under your control as I
[9:55] surrender to you may you come and speak
[9:58] your word of eternal life Lord for we
[10:00] are utterly completely dependent upon
[10:02] you for everything Lord we're trusting
[10:05] in you also Lord to keep your word and
[10:07] do what you told us you would do we've
[10:09] gathered together now we trust Lord that
[10:12] through the foolishness of preaching
[10:13] you'll save us Lord that you'll restore
[10:16] us and heal us and train us up in the
[10:18] way that is right we commit ourselves to
[10:21] you Lord and we want to receive your
[10:23] word give us ears to hear and a heart to
[10:25] perceive all that you have for us we ask
[10:28] it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[10:32] bless you all while we're standing let's
[10:33] take our Bibles thank you musicians
[10:36] we're going to turn to the book of
[10:38] Ephesians as most of you know they were
[10:40] predicting uh some uh maybe freezing
[10:43] rain or ice possibly tonight looked like
[10:45] all the models were showing uh 10:00 or
[10:48] thereafter somewhere around there so
[10:50] we're going to try our best to shorten
[10:52] the service and get out early so
[10:53] everybody can get home before anything
[10:55] begins so I'm going to say God bless you
[10:57] for being here but we're going to do our
[10:59] best to keep it short amen so pull fast
[11:02] and pull short amen we're going to work
[11:05] together and we thank God that we're
[11:07] able to be together also uh Sunday
[11:10] evening I let you know that brother Jim
[11:12] Swanson was going to be preaching over
[11:13] at bible Believers uh uh in two weeks on
[11:17] the February the 16th but I just found
[11:19] out also that Brother Kyle wer is going
[11:20] to be preaching there this Sunday the
[11:22] 9th so he'd appreciate your prayers I'm
[11:24] sure so pray for both of those brothers
[11:26] that'll be back toback Sundays this
[11:28] Sunday and then the following Sunday so
[11:31] we want to remember them and the Saints
[11:32] there in
[11:34] prayer and let's look at Ephesians
[11:36] chapter
[11:42] 4 Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[11:48] 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[11:51] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[11:53] vocation wherewith you are called with
[11:56] all loneliness and meekness with
[11:58] longsuffering for bearing one another in
[12:00] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[12:02] the spirit in the bond of Peace for
[12:06] there is one body in one Spirit even as
[12:08] you are called in one hope of your
[12:09] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[12:13] one God and Father of all who is above
[12:15] all and through all and in you all amen
[12:19] God bless you as you have your seats may
[12:21] God bless us as we look at his word
[12:24] amen so I want to go back and look at
[12:27] the the beginning of this uh reading
[12:31] here in verse one I therefore the
[12:33] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[12:34] you walk worthy of the vocation
[12:36] wherewith you are called with all
[12:38] loneliness and meekness with
[12:40] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[12:42] love me there's a there's a thought that
[12:45] I had I've been actually dwelling on
[12:47] this thought for a couple weeks and uh
[12:50] it's actually very fitting tonight
[12:51] because it's just a simple short thought
[12:53] for a a night when we need a simple
[12:55] short service amen so I feel like it's
[12:57] very fitting that we Minister on this
[12:59] tonight amen and I want to preach on
[13:01] forbearing and
[13:03] longsuffering forbearing and
[13:04] longsuffering and we realized that last
[13:07] Sunday we started preaching on the the
[13:09] divine nature the attributes of Christ
[13:11] and how that it actually is God's Own
[13:14] nature that he empowers us with it's not
[13:16] our nature but his nature but we find
[13:18] also that there's a command for us to be
[13:20] long-suffering and forbearing amen and I
[13:23] think we're going to need his help with
[13:24] that
[13:25] too but he said with longsuffering and
[13:27] forbearing one another in love
[13:29] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[13:32] spirit in the bond of Peace So I want to
[13:34] look at these words longsuffering and
[13:37] forbearing and the word longsuffering
[13:40] can mean patience or endurance or
[13:42] constancy but there's another meaning
[13:44] which I think is implied here because he
[13:46] he's talking about longsuffering and
[13:48] forbearing one another in love
[13:49] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[13:52] spirit and the bond of Peace So This is
[13:54] in relation to keeping unity and peace
[13:57] so there's a definition of this word
[13:58] long suffer uing that means forbearance
[14:01] longsuffering slowness and avenging
[14:05] wrongs slowness and avenging
[14:08] wrongs think about that when we read it
[14:11] again with longsuffering forbearing one
[14:12] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[14:15] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[14:17] I think that's the definition that
[14:18] applies here and then
[14:21] forbearing means to bear with to hold up
[14:24] to hold oneself erect and firm to
[14:26] sustain to Bear to endure
[14:30] so we are supposed to do that for one
[14:33] another not just holding up ourselves
[14:35] and and holding ourselves direct and
[14:37] bearing under the low but we're supposed
[14:39] to Bear one another bear for forbearing
[14:43] one another in love endeavoring to keep
[14:46] the unity uh of the spirit in the bond
[14:48] of Peace so that's what I want to speak
[14:50] on Long uh forbearing and longsuffering
[14:53] there's other applications of those
[14:54] words but I want to have the application
[14:56] that I that's referred to here when it
[14:58] has to do with us deal dealing with one
[14:59] another we're going to need we're going
[15:01] to need forbearing and
[15:03] longsuffering so why if we all have come
[15:06] to Perfection do we need forbearing and
[15:08] longsuffering I think maybe because as
[15:10] long as we're in this flesh and we're
[15:12] human beings and we're striving amen for
[15:14] the Mastery that we're going to need
[15:16] forbearing and longsuffering for one
[15:18] another that's why the Commandments here
[15:20] in Ephesians amen because we all know
[15:22] that we're struggling in this life and
[15:24] what are we struggling with we're
[15:25] struggling with ourselves and we're
[15:26] struggling to overcome and Reign the
[15:28] outer man in to the to the to the
[15:31] control of the inner man so that Christ
[15:33] can have his way in all of us and so
[15:36] we're going to need some forbearing and
[15:38] longsuffering let's turn to Colossians
[15:40] chapter
[15:48] 3 Colossians chapter
[15:52] 3 and verse
[15:54] 12 put on therefore as the elect of God
[15:57] holy and beloved bows of Merc Mercy
[15:59] kindness humbleness uh humbleness of
[16:02] Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing
[16:04] one another and forgiving one another If
[16:07] any man have quarrel against any even as
[16:09] Christ forgave you so also do
[16:13] ye U I want to read the other next verse
[16:15] too and above all these things put on
[16:18] charity it's love which is the bond of
[16:20] perfectness and let the peace of God
[16:22] rule in your hearts to the which also
[16:24] you are called in one body and be ye
[16:27] thankful pray praise God so so we see
[16:31] here this word longsuffering and
[16:32] forbearing again referring to one
[16:34] another and forgiving one another If any
[16:37] man have a quarrel against any even as
[16:40] Christ forgave you so also do ye so this
[16:43] is amazing I want to take this verse and
[16:45] put it in the light of the message that
[16:47] we've been hearing on forgiveness the
[16:49] one brother Gabe preached and the one I
[16:50] preached myself then it says here that
[16:53] if any have a quarrel against any If any
[16:55] man have a quarrel against any what's he
[16:57] supposed to do forbearing one another
[16:59] forgiving one another If any man have a
[17:01] quarrel against any even as Christ
[17:03] forgave you so also do
[17:05] ye so we're supposed to forgive each
[17:07] other the same way Christ forgave us oh
[17:11] that's really good because that's really
[17:14] hard that's why it's so good because
[17:17] who's he referring to here he's not
[17:19] referring to you with a quarrel with
[17:21] somebody in the world right he's talking
[17:24] about in the church you say there's no
[17:26] way that could be in the church oh okay
[17:28] well you haven't been in the church very
[17:31] long amen so we supposed to forgive one
[17:36] another as Christ forgave
[17:39] us well how did Christ forgive
[17:42] me did Christ wait for me to repent or
[17:45] did he forgive me
[17:48] before
[17:50] amen Christ forgave me before before I
[17:54] even came to him to repent before I even
[17:56] asked his forgiveness he forgave me
[17:58] before amen he forgave the whole nation
[18:01] of Jews father forgive them they know
[18:02] not what they do it before they had a
[18:04] chance to ask for forgiveness he forgave
[18:06] them freely he forgave them willingly
[18:09] and then here's the next thing did Jesus
[18:11] ask me to pay for my wrongs or did he
[18:14] pay for my wrongs yeah
[18:17] amen so how are we supposed to forgive
[18:19] one another even as Christ forgave us
[18:23] we're supposed to forgive forgive our
[18:24] brothers forgive them they you don't
[18:26] even have to require a repentance we
[18:28] should for give them anyways we
[18:30] shouldn't require they make it right or
[18:32] they pay the price or they make it up to
[18:34] me because Christ didn't forgive us that
[18:36] way we should forgive each other freely
[18:39] and we should Bear all the consequences
[18:41] of whatever wrong was done just let it
[18:43] go just bear the consequences and let
[18:45] them let let your brother off of the
[18:47] hook because that's the way Jesus
[18:49] forgave me yeah and so and in order to
[18:53] do that it's going to take longsuffering
[18:55] and forbearance with one another it's
[18:57] going to take humbleness of mind Mercy
[18:59] meekness all of these attributes are
[19:01] going to come together amen for us to
[19:03] live together we need this in our homes
[19:06] we need this in a church we need
[19:08] wherever you have a a a lumping of
[19:10] people together how big of a lumping
[19:12] well I guess two people in a home a
[19:13] marriage you're going to need this amen
[19:16] so this is something that we're going to
[19:18] need and we're going to need the
[19:19] attributes of Christ in our lives for us
[19:21] to be able to live this out to make it
[19:23] flesh right the brother bham said in the
[19:27] message the church and its condition
[19:29] from 1956 he said but look if that Dove
[19:32] of meekness is gone from you brother
[19:34] there's something wrong there's
[19:36] something wrong when you can't bear with
[19:38] one another when you can't forgive every
[19:40] person from the very depths of your
[19:42] heart no matter what they've done or
[19:44] what they've said if you can't forgive
[19:46] them from the death Jesus said if you
[19:48] don't forgive everyone man his
[19:49] trespasses from your heart neither does
[19:51] your heavenly father forgive you so this
[19:54] is a serious
[19:55] subject but but he said there's a
[19:58] problem if we can't bear with one
[20:00] another and there's a problem if we
[20:03] can't forgive every person from the very
[20:04] depths of our heart that's a
[20:08] problem so what's the problem the
[20:11] problem is there's still too much of me
[20:14] that's the problem because guess what
[20:16] there are some hurts that are hard to
[20:17] get over there are some things that are
[20:20] extremely painful there are some things
[20:22] it's not just trivial it's not something
[20:24] you just lightly toss off amen it's
[20:26] going to take the very nature of Jes
[20:28] Jesus Christ coming into us to give us
[20:31] the heart the meekness the love amen his
[20:34] love so that we can forbear so that we
[20:36] can suffer long so that we can
[20:39] forgive and there's something wrong when
[20:42] we can't bear with one another amen just
[20:46] note that there's something wrong and
[20:48] you say well what's wrong well obviously
[20:50] if I can't bear with that person it's
[20:52] their fault they're being super
[20:56] difficult I say you know there's a
[20:58] problem we can't bear with one another
[20:59] and the person we should look at is the
[21:01] person in the mirror and say God why
[21:02] can't I just die to myself why can't I
[21:05] stop defending myself why can't I stop
[21:07] getting offended why can't I stop being
[21:09] so hurt yeah I mean there's reasons but
[21:12] we need God to heal us we can't just
[21:14] stuff these things down and put a jar a
[21:17] lid on the jar and act like they're not
[21:18] there but we need actual Deliverance
[21:20] ourselves in order to be F be able to
[21:22] flesh this out we need God's help and
[21:25] that's why it's so good to look at these
[21:27] things and say you know what this is the
[21:28] Commandment this is what Paul's telling
[21:30] us this is how we need to act with one
[21:32] another and if I can't come to this I
[21:34] need something more from God to work on
[21:36] me so that I can come to fulfillment of
[21:38] this scripture because this is the word
[21:41] and the word has to be made flesh and
[21:42] where is the word going to be made flesh
[21:44] in the bride amen are you part of the
[21:47] Bride then this word has to be made
[21:49] flesh in you and I it can't just stay on
[21:51] the pages of the Bible it can't be a
[21:53] good teaching it can't be a good idea it
[21:56] has to actually become flesh amen and
[21:58] how many of you think God wants us to
[22:00] flesh out this word this commandment
[22:02] from the Apostle Paul for the Saints do
[22:04] you think God wants us to flesh that out
[22:06] then how are we going to flesh it out
[22:08] unless somebody needs
[22:10] forgiven
[22:13] amen like we've been saying I I want I I
[22:16] want so bad for my attitudes to change I
[22:18] I'm praying about it all the time that
[22:20] God will get a hold of this vessel and
[22:22] help me die to the outer man because I I
[22:25] I I always look at offenses and it then
[22:27] it always is the same Story how could
[22:29] this be happening and why is this
[22:31] happening and why did they do this to me
[22:32] and blah blah blah blah blah and and I
[22:35] need to get past that where I can
[22:37] actually die to myself and it doesn't
[22:39] matter anymore for if God allows it it
[22:41] has a purpose and it gives me an
[22:43] opportunity to flesh out the very nature
[22:45] of Jesus
[22:47] Christ and what happens too often is I
[22:49] flesh out the nature of the old man of
[22:51] Chad Lamb and I'm tired of that guy I
[22:54] want to flesh out the very nature of
[22:56] Jesus
[22:57] Christ so God God's going to give us
[22:59] lots of
[23:02] opportunities how many have had lots of
[23:04] opportunities well just hold on you're
[23:06] going to get some more because this has
[23:08] to be made
[23:09] flesh it has to be made flesh and you
[23:11] can say why did my brother do that to me
[23:14] well in order for you to forgive your
[23:15] brother you to F to fulfill the
[23:19] scriptures that's a scripture that has
[23:21] to be fulfilled in order you to forgive
[23:23] a brother you have to some point along
[23:25] the way have to have a brother who needs
[23:27] forgiven amen righten so you mean the
[23:31] very fact that I have a brother needs
[23:33] forgiven is part of the word
[23:37] yes we can't fulfill the word unless we
[23:40] have the opportunity to fulfill the
[23:42] word so we look at everything as a
[23:45] negative but we got to stop looking at
[23:47] everything as a negative and look at
[23:49] them as the potential for God to
[23:50] manifest his word every situation no
[23:53] matter how hard it is there's situations
[23:55] that break our hearts there's situations
[23:57] that destroy us there's situ situations
[23:58] that mess us up on the
[24:00] inside we can't help it they do you know
[24:03] there was situations that mess up
[24:04] brother brandham on the
[24:07] inside right they're there but they're
[24:10] an opportunity for God to manifest
[24:13] himself and I want God to take that
[24:16] opportunity and I want him to manifest
[24:18] himself if you could turn with me to 1
[24:20] Timothy 1
[24:41] 1 Timothy
[24:43] 1 and verse
[24:47] 12 the Apostle Paul is writing here to
[24:50] Timothy and he says and I thank Christ
[24:52] Jesus our lord who ha enabled me for
[24:55] that he counted me faithful putting me
[24:57] into the ministry who was before a
[24:59] blasphemer and a persecutor and injurers
[25:02] but I obtained Mercy because I did it
[25:04] ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of
[25:06] our Lord Jesus was exceeding abundant
[25:08] with faith and love which is in Christ
[25:11] Jesus that is a faithful saying and
[25:14] worthy of all acceptation that Christ
[25:16] Jesus came into the world to save
[25:17] Sinners of who I am the chief how be it
[25:20] for this cause I obtained Mercy that in
[25:23] me first Jesus Christ might show forth
[25:25] all longsuffering for a pattern to them
[25:28] which should Hereafter believe on him to
[25:31] everlasting life so Paul starts off
[25:34] saying I was a rotten
[25:36] person I was rotten and you know the
[25:39] Christian World especially around uh uh
[25:42] Judaism around uh the Middle East there
[25:44] they knew it they knew in Damascus they
[25:46] knew it in Jerusalem they knew what kind
[25:48] of person he was when he was on the road
[25:50] to Damascus he was stricken down amen
[25:52] and God wants to take ananas to go speak
[25:54] to him anas say you know what I've heard
[25:56] what manner of man this is how he's
[25:58] persecuting and doing all these wrong
[26:00] things and Paul
[26:02] said this is beautiful I want to go back
[26:05] to verse 16 how be it for this cause I
[26:08] obtained Mercy this is why God had mercy
[26:10] on me that in me first Jesus might show
[26:13] forth all
[26:15] longsuffering amen all
[26:18] longsuffering for a pattern to them
[26:21] which should Hereafter believe on him
[26:23] for the life Everlasting what did God
[26:25] what what is Paul saying I was a rotten
[26:27] scoundrel ever everybody knew I was a
[26:29] rotten scoundrel I was doing everything
[26:30] wrong but God showed mercy on me for
[26:32] this one reason so that you can believe
[26:34] he'll show mercy on you and show the
[26:36] longsuffering of God because God has
[26:39] been longsuffering with all of us God
[26:42] has been patient with me he's covered my
[26:45] sins he has forgiven me he's been slow
[26:47] to wrath and slow to
[26:52] punish amen and this is what Paul's
[26:54] saying now he said now I'm an example of
[26:56] the longsuffering of God
[26:58] so that you could
[27:01] believe let's go to Second Peter
[27:05] now second Peter chapter
[27:16] 3 second Peter chapter 3 we'll look at
[27:20] verse
[27:23] 13 said nevertheless we according to his
[27:26] promise look for a new heavens and new
[27:28] Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[27:30] wherefore beloved seeing that ye look
[27:33] for such things be diligent that you may
[27:35] be found of him in peace without spot
[27:37] and blameless and account that the
[27:39] longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation
[27:42] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[27:45] according to the wisdom given unto him
[27:47] hath written unto you so what's Peter
[27:50] saying Peter saying this longsuffering
[27:52] of the Lord is
[27:53] salvation where would we be if he wasn't
[27:56] longsuffering where would we be if he
[27:58] wasn't forbearing where would we be if
[28:00] he wasn't merciful if he wasn't kind if
[28:03] he wasn't loving where would you and I
[28:04] be and if that's what Christ has done
[28:07] for us what should we do for others
[28:09] because we should be the example of what
[28:11] was done for us we should forgive the
[28:14] way he forgave us we should love the way
[28:15] he loved us we should be longsuffering
[28:17] with others the way he was longsuffering
[28:19] with us we should forebear others the
[28:20] way he forbear for
[28:24] us
[28:26] amen Jesus modeled forbearing and
[28:29] longsuffering when he was here on the
[28:31] earth cuz all around him were people who
[28:34] weren't understanding they weren't
[28:36] getting the program he was there and and
[28:39] good things were happening and they
[28:40] loved him but they they just were
[28:42] missing the mark all the time let's go
[28:44] to chap uh Luke Chapter N I want to pull
[28:47] out just a couple of these and show
[28:50] Christ in his Earthly Journey here
[29:02] all right Luke chapter
[29:06] 9 Luke chapter 9 verse
[29:11] 54 9 and 54 when his disciples James and
[29:15] John saw this they said Lord wil thou
[29:17] that we command fire to come down from
[29:19] heaven and consume them even as Elias
[29:20] did but he turned and rebuked him and
[29:22] said ye know not what manner of spirit
[29:25] you are of for the son of man has not
[29:27] come to destroy 's lives but to save
[29:29] them and they went to another Village so
[29:32] here they got the whole wrong program of
[29:34] what's going on but he's got to be
[29:35] patient with these guys they don't
[29:38] understand he's got to be longsuffering
[29:40] and and they think he's going to set up
[29:42] his Earthly Kingdom immediately and he's
[29:43] going to banish all the Romans and cast
[29:45] them all out and set up the Throne of
[29:47] David and they wouldn't accept him and
[29:48] let's just do like Elias did of old and
[29:51] let's call down fire and he says you
[29:52] don't even know what Spirit you're of
[29:54] that's not why the son of man has
[29:56] come he's got to be patient
[29:58] but you know what he didn't throw him
[30:00] out of his he didn't throw him out of
[30:01] his church he didn't throw him out of
[30:04] his confidence as friends and as
[30:07] disciples he kept them right where they
[30:11] were amen let's look again at at at uh
[30:15] verse
[30:17] 46 same chapter then there arose a
[30:20] reasoning among them which of them
[30:22] should be greatest and Jesus perceived
[30:25] the thought of their heart and took a
[30:26] child and said him by him and said unto
[30:28] him whosoever shall receive this child
[30:30] in my name receiveth me and whosoever
[30:32] shall receive me receiveth him that sent
[30:34] me for he that is least among you all
[30:36] the same shall be great so here Jesus is
[30:39] going along and they want to call fire
[30:41] down from heaven over here on this group
[30:42] and they're they're over here arguing
[30:44] amongst themselves who's the greatest in
[30:46] the kingdom and they have no idea what's
[30:48] going
[30:50] on but you know what he loved them he
[30:53] was patient with them he would correct
[30:55] them but he didn't cast them out he
[30:58] never chased them
[31:01] away amen Jesus many times had to suffer
[31:05] with them even many times he makes the
[31:07] statement when they when they couldn't
[31:08] believe when the when the man had the
[31:10] epileptic child and his disciples
[31:12] weren't able to cast him out and they
[31:13] brought him to Jesus and said I brought
[31:15] them to your disciples and they couldn't
[31:16] cast them out and Jesus said over and
[31:18] over you you faithless generation how
[31:20] long will I suffer you same word as as
[31:24] suffer the same word as longsuffering uh
[31:26] the same root word as longsuffering in
[31:28] how long will I be patient with
[31:31] you Jesus had to be patient in his
[31:34] Earthly
[31:35] Journey but he was
[31:38] patient he was
[31:40] longsuffering he knew that they would
[31:42] eventually get
[31:44] it amen oh aren't you glad he knew you
[31:47] would eventually get it amen and even
[31:49] now we don't all the way get it but
[31:50] aren't you glad he knows you'll get it
[31:53] he forgave us yesterday he's forgiving
[31:55] us today we thought oh we look back
[31:57] sometimes in our lives and we say oh God
[31:59] was so merciful so longsuffering he was
[32:01] so patient with me back then I'm so
[32:03] thankful he was he's probably being just
[32:06] as patient with you now as he was back
[32:08] then he's probably every bit as
[32:10] longsuffering today as he was 20 years
[32:12] ago amen because we still got some
[32:14] growing to
[32:17] do and if God's going to be
[32:19] longsuffering and patient with me
[32:21] forbearing I should be that for my
[32:24] brethren brother M says when Christ
[32:28] when Christians lose faith in one
[32:30] another the devil gets to church right
[32:32] then that's right we got to have faith
[32:34] and confidence in one another and bear
[32:37] with one
[32:38] another I mean that doesn't mean we
[32:40] always agree with each other and that
[32:41] doesn't mean there won't ever be any
[32:43] mistakes but we got to have confidence
[32:45] in one another and we got to bear with
[32:47] one another with the things that need
[32:50] born amen remember bearing with your
[32:53] brother is not because everything's
[32:55] going
[32:56] perfect bearing with your brothers
[32:58] because maybe something's not
[33:00] perfect there's a difference there's a
[33:02] mistake there's an error there's
[33:04] immaturity there's misunderstanding
[33:06] there's something going on that causes
[33:07] us to bear with our
[33:10] Brethren
[33:12] amen uh I want to go to Galatians
[33:16] now if we can go to Galatians Chapter
[33:24] 2 Galatians chapter 2:1
[33:32] Galatians 2
[33:33] And1 it says but when Peter was come to
[33:36] Antioch I withstood him to his face
[33:38] because he was to be blamed and Paul
[33:40] corrected him because he had been eating
[33:42] with all the Gentiles all the Christian
[33:44] Gentiles but when a delegation from
[33:47] James out of Jerusalem come down he
[33:49] separated amen because he didn't want to
[33:51] be seen fellowshipping with the Gentiles
[33:52] because of old Jewish Customs amen and
[33:55] and Paul Paul had a special gift Paul
[33:58] was was the Apostle to the Gentiles and
[34:01] Paul could see what was going to happen
[34:02] and he had a special discernment and
[34:04] understanding and even though Peter was
[34:06] missing it Paul caught it yeah and Paul
[34:09] wasto stood him to his face and
[34:10] corrected him amen but you never see
[34:13] Peter
[34:15] retaliate in the Bible even in the great
[34:18] Jerusalem Council when when uh when when
[34:21] uh Paul came back and gave the testimony
[34:23] of how God was saving the Gentiles and
[34:25] all these things the Pharisees rose up
[34:27] and says what we must teach them
[34:28] circumcision we must teach them some
[34:30] dietary laws and Paul was saying no
[34:32] these are Gentiles these aren't Jews it
[34:34] was Peter who stood up and defended him
[34:36] and citing what happened in cornelius's
[34:38] house it was Peter who comes at the end
[34:42] of the the the scripture in second Peter
[34:43] we just read and says uh even as Paul
[34:46] has written to
[34:48] you and he refers to Paul's writings
[34:51] which some things are hard to be
[34:53] understood as are the other scriptures
[34:55] and he elevates Paul's writings to the
[34:57] Church on the same level as the
[34:59] scriptures that's Peter amen just
[35:02] because they had a difference just
[35:04] because Paul was correcting Peter amen
[35:07] didn't mean they had to have a falling
[35:09] away and not ever work together and not
[35:11] have respect for each other
[35:13] anymore and he says in questions and
[35:15] answers he says you know Peter and Paul
[35:17] had differences not in their Doctrine
[35:19] but the way Peter was behaving
[35:22] himself they had a little difference in
[35:24] it but it never separated them they were
[35:26] brothers I said oh God help me get to
[35:29] this
[35:31] place
[35:33] amen and things that are to be brother
[35:36] bam makes this statement he says like
[35:38] many kinds of Hills like many kinds of
[35:40] rivers Springs Lakes they were here when
[35:43] you came here first because the kindness
[35:45] of your heavenly father placed them here
[35:47] because some men like mountains some
[35:50] people like Waters some like deserts so
[35:53] you see you're coming he knew your
[35:55] nature and what you would be so he made
[35:57] it just the way that you could enjoy it
[35:59] oh I think that's wonderful uh wonderful
[36:02] father see know that he made it like
[36:04] this I'm glad he made mountains I like
[36:07] mountains and I like that where others
[36:09] oh can't stand oh he must have emptied
[36:12] his mortar box out there well he emptied
[36:14] it out so I could enjoy it you see so
[36:16] they then say I like the plains where I
[36:19] can see a long ways well the two
[36:21] different Natures both of us
[36:24] Christians amen we're not all the same
[36:28] so there's no way in the world we're
[36:29] going to all view everything the
[36:31] same and because we're not going to view
[36:33] everything the same there's going to
[36:35] need to be some
[36:37] forbearing and
[36:39] longsuffering right
[36:42] amen we know that Paul and Barnabas came
[36:46] to a place let's turn there in Acts
[36:48] chapter
[36:56] 15 Act CH
[37:00] 15 and verse
[37:05] 36 in Acts
[37:08] 15:36 he said and the some and some days
[37:12] after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go
[37:14] again and visit our brethren in every
[37:15] city where we have preached the word of
[37:17] the Lord and see how they do and
[37:19] Barnabas determined to take with him
[37:21] John whose surname was Mark but Paul
[37:23] thought not good to take him with them
[37:26] who departed from them from pamilia and
[37:30] went not with them to the work and the
[37:32] contention was so sharp between them
[37:34] that they departed aund one from the
[37:36] other and so Barnabas took Mark and
[37:38] sailed into Cyprus and Paul chose Silas
[37:40] and departed being recommended by the
[37:42] Brethren unto the grace of God so here
[37:44] if Paul and Barnabas they have a
[37:46] different idea on who should they should
[37:47] take on their next Journey Barnabas
[37:50] wants to take his
[37:51] nephew well of
[37:53] course John Marks his nephew but Paul
[37:56] doesn't want to take him because he left
[37:57] them in pamphilia and he was to take
[38:00] Silas so they separated but we find if
[38:03] you watch the scripture closely there
[38:05] was a Reconciliation at the end because
[38:09] he says into Timothy he said only Luke
[38:11] is with me take mark this same Mark John
[38:14] Mark and bring him with thee for he is
[38:16] profitable to me for the
[38:19] ministry oh I love that little nugget
[38:22] that's hidden in the Bible cuz you read
[38:23] this in Acts you think oh that was a
[38:25] separation over Mark but there was a
[38:27] reconciliation somewhere because he
[38:29] realized Mark is profitable to me in the
[38:32] ministry and he was calling amen for
[38:35] Timothy to bring Mark when he comes I'm
[38:37] so glad amen no matter what happens amen
[38:39] by the spirit of God can bring us back
[38:42] together as
[38:43] Brethren brother R says this in super
[38:45] sign say never even had two prophets the
[38:49] same time always an individual men has
[38:52] different ideas cope that together you
[38:54] get a mess God has one man he works with
[38:57] there's one Elijah then Elisha then John
[39:00] on down to Jesus so forth right on down
[39:02] there's Luther Wesley so forth Just
[39:04] Right on down so he says men has
[39:07] different ideas so he only works with
[39:08] one at a time as a major prophet and he
[39:10] says this in the fourth seal said God
[39:13] always deals with one individual two
[39:15] men's got two
[39:19] ideas listen sometimes not two men
[39:22] sometimes is a man and a woman living in
[39:23] the same
[39:24] house can have two ideas
[39:28] two men's got two ideas there never was
[39:30] two Major Prophets on the earth
[39:32] prophesying the same time look back and
[39:34] see if there was no sir too much
[39:36] scrupled up he's got to get one man
[39:39] completely surrendered and use that
[39:41] person I've I've read this I read this
[39:44] for for years I read it many times and
[39:46] even he brings it up in the church age
[39:48] book and in the church age book he says
[39:49] the same thing and he comes down a
[39:50] little farther he says anytime you have
[39:52] a group of people there'll be
[39:53] differences on on on uh not minor points
[39:57] something like that they minor points of
[39:59] major Doctrine though they believe the
[40:01] same
[40:02] Doctrine there'll be
[40:05] differences
[40:07] and and because of this he couldn't have
[40:10] two Major Prophets on the earth at the
[40:12] same
[40:13] time and you think surely two Major
[40:16] Prophets wouldn't do
[40:18] that are you kidding me Jeremiah and
[40:21] Isaiah couldn't come the same time
[40:22] because they had a different view on
[40:25] things is that what Pro is that what
[40:27] brother B saying yeah are you saying
[40:30] Elijah and Moses couldn't be on Earth at
[40:33] the same time back in their Earthly
[40:35] Ministry amen because they would have
[40:37] differences that's what the prophet's
[40:39] teaching us even two Major Prophets
[40:42] couldn't come at the same time because
[40:44] there would be differences so God only
[40:45] worked through one major prophet at a
[40:48] time well my goodness if that's the case
[40:50] with Major Prophets what about you and
[40:54] I we're ripe for it friends we are ripe
[40:57] for differences we're right for
[40:59] misunderstands we're right for different
[41:01] points and minor points and major
[41:04] doctrines even though we believe the
[41:05] same
[41:07] Doctrine we're righte for it but because
[41:09] we're right for it we need to understand
[41:11] that and we need to have forbearance and
[41:13] longsuffering with one another because
[41:15] that's just my brother that's what he
[41:17] sees this is what I see and in reality
[41:19] we both might be seeing it a little
[41:21] wrong but it doesn't matter he's my
[41:25] brother hey amen God help
[41:29] me so I just thought that was amazing
[41:32] when it really hit me I heard brother R
[41:34] say that many times but when the impact
[41:36] of that statement hit me that God
[41:38] couldn't bring Isaiah and Ezekiel the
[41:41] same
[41:41] time why because they would have
[41:43] differences on
[41:45] things and he says men has different
[41:47] ideas cope that together you get a
[41:52] mess praise be to
[41:54] God this shouldn't make it easy for us
[41:57] to to forbear with one
[42:00] another brother M says in questions and
[42:03] answers from 1964 he said now if we took
[42:06] their here this morning in this
[42:07] congregation where people sat here and
[42:09] listen day after day and so forth to the
[42:11] teaching you find out you'd be different
[42:13] one from another because you're
[42:15] different you you make up different your
[42:18] appetites are different you eat
[42:19] different but you all eat
[42:21] food with one individual being just like
[42:24] the other one you're different one from
[42:25] another Christians do the same thing
[42:27] because do all speak with tongues do all
[42:28] prophesy he's showing that even in the
[42:30] body of Christ we have different gifts
[42:32] different administrations of those gifts
[42:34] there's a variety and when brother B
[42:36] says one eat one thing one eat the other
[42:38] in another place he said one likes apple
[42:39] pie and one likes cherry pie but we're
[42:41] both eating
[42:42] pie
[42:43] amen I may have a little I may have a
[42:46] little idea this way and you have a
[42:47] little idea this way but one thing's for
[42:49] sure we love this message amen and we
[42:51] believe it to be the truth and we know
[42:52] that brother Brandon was sent of God to
[42:54] bring us the correct interpretation of
[42:55] the word and I'm still growing in my
[42:58] understanding of that and if I'm growing
[42:59] I can trust that you're growing and if
[43:01] we see it a little different I can
[43:02] forbear with you if you can forbear with
[43:04] me because I I realize now that where
[43:07] I'm standing today is wasn't where I was
[43:09] 5 years ago wasn't where I was a year
[43:11] ago amen I hope it's not where I was 6
[43:13] months ago but I hope God's constantly
[43:15] unveiling himself to
[43:17] me yeah but you may call it cherry pie I
[43:20] may call it apple pie but we're both
[43:21] eating
[43:23] pie amen I think we need each other more
[43:26] than we realize amen let's go to 1
[43:29] Corinthians
[43:46] 13 1 Corinthians 13 and good go to verse
[43:52] 4 said charity suffereth long
[43:57] this is this charity is love suffereth
[44:01] long is another another term that's uh
[44:04] used like long suffering it's patience
[44:06] and long patience and long enduring and
[44:08] one of the definitions in the
[44:10] concordance is to be patient and bearing
[44:13] the offenses and injuries of
[44:16] others to be patient so charity
[44:20] suffereth long that means charity is
[44:23] patient in bearing the offenses and
[44:25] injuries of others to be mild and slow
[44:28] to
[44:30] punish is that the nature of
[44:33] Christ I want that to be my
[44:37] nature charity suffereth
[44:40] long and is kind charity envieth not
[44:43] charity vaunteth not itself is not
[44:45] puffed up does not behave itself
[44:47] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[44:49] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[44:52] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in
[44:54] Truth beareth All Things believeth all
[44:58] things hopeth all things endureth all
[45:01] things this word beareth all things also
[45:05] can means to to forbear to suffer to
[45:09] bear and it can mean to bear under a
[45:12] load or to hold up a Lo but it also has
[45:14] another meaning and it means to cover
[45:16] over with silence to keep secret to hide
[45:18] to conceal hides and excuses the errors
[45:22] and faults of
[45:25] others is that what love does yeah is
[45:28] that what charity does is that what
[45:29] Christ charity does for you
[45:32] yeah does he hide and excuse your errors
[45:36] and
[45:41] faults how many want to have charity the
[45:44] Gap Stone of love then we're going to
[45:46] need to suffer
[45:48] long be patient and bearing offenses and
[45:51] injuries of others cuz it's going to
[45:54] come it's going to come because these
[45:57] attributes have to be manifested it's
[45:59] not going to come because you have bad
[46:01] Brethren and you're surrounded by rotten
[46:04] people it's going to come because these
[46:07] things have to be manifested in the body
[46:09] of
[46:10] Christ because these instructions were
[46:12] given to the church so if they're given
[46:13] to the church for how Brethren should
[46:15] deal with each other then there has to
[46:17] be the application of the word meaning
[46:19] there has to be a problem to have the
[46:21] application of the word or else there's
[46:22] no point in Paul writing it amen amen so
[46:26] in instead of instead of uh letting the
[46:29] wheels fall off the bus every time
[46:30] something happen let's keep the wheels
[46:32] on the bus and say hey this is a perfect
[46:34] opportunity for the Life of Christ to
[46:36] mature in me for me to mature into that
[46:39] life say God help me it's so much better
[46:44] I mean it's so much better with a little
[46:47] understanding if we can stop for just a
[46:48] minute if we can stop when the trains
[46:50] are rolling if we could say hold on just
[46:52] a minute let me reflect on what's going
[46:54] on and let me reflect on the inside of
[46:56] me
[46:57] too many times when we when we hit
[47:00] problems we hit conflicts we hit
[47:01] disagreements we hit difficulties we hit
[47:03] circumstances the very first thing we do
[47:05] is start analyzing everybody else in the
[47:09] situation what they said what they did
[47:11] what was right what was wrong and the
[47:13] very last person we analyze is the one
[47:15] we should have started with and that was
[47:18] this guy right here what should my
[47:21] reaction be what did I do did I make it
[47:23] worse can I make it better what can I do
[47:26] what would what would Jesus Christ do
[47:28] what is God asking me to do in this
[47:31] scenario and that's what that brother
[47:34] that brothers and sisters that is what I
[47:36] hope God is teaching us and that's what
[47:37] I hope God is teaching me to stop and
[47:40] there's there's not another person in
[47:42] the world that I can control there's not
[47:44] another person I can fix there's not
[47:45] another person I can make do anything
[47:47] right there's only one person God's
[47:49] asked me to control and he's asked me to
[47:51] possess this vessel amen and so I need
[47:54] to stop and say am I being patient am I
[47:57] being longsuffering am I being
[47:59] forbearing Is This Love or is this
[48:03] Chad and when I stop long enough to do
[48:06] that I I hang my head in
[48:08] shame because most all the time I'm
[48:10] offended and I'm hurt because of
[48:14] me because I want to protect myself I
[48:17] don't want anybody say anything about me
[48:19] I don't want hurt feelings I don't want
[48:22] this and this and this but Jesus was
[48:24] spit on Friends he was stripped naked
[48:27] and made fun of and beat and mocked and
[48:29] laughed and rejected in every way from
[48:31] the people he came to save yeah and I
[48:35] can't bear a misunderstanding with my
[48:39] brother I want to grow friends I want to
[48:41] grow I want to grow I say God I need to
[48:46] grow I admitted I need to grow
[48:49] Lord we need to bear with one another
[48:52] because we're not perfect
[48:54] yet that's right do you believe
[48:58] that I sure believe it we're not perfect
[49:01] yet so we need to bear with one another
[49:04] because we're all growing into the
[49:05] stature of a perfect man we're all
[49:08] striving for the same thing at least we
[49:11] we hope that we are let's turn to 1
[49:14] Thessalonians chapter
[49:22] 5 1 Thessalonians chapter 5
[49:28] and let's go to verse
[49:34] 14 1 Thessalonians 5:14 says now we
[49:38] exhort you
[49:39] Brethren warn them that are
[49:43] ruly Comfort the feeble-minded support
[49:46] the weak be patient toward all
[49:49] men now this is another
[49:52] commandment for the
[49:55] church and he's telling us to comfort
[49:57] the
[49:59] feeble-minded these are people who are
[50:00] fearful and anxious and nervous not
[50:03] settled support the weak be patient
[50:06] toward all
[50:07] men that means if God wants us to
[50:09] Manifest this then there's got to be
[50:11] once in a while some feeble mindedness
[50:13] Among Us there's got to be some weak
[50:16] there's got to be some need for patience
[50:18] amen remember when when they came to
[50:20] break the alabaster box the woman did
[50:22] anoint Jesus's feet and the disciple
[50:23] says this should have been sold and
[50:25] given to the poor brother Jesus makes a
[50:27] statement he says the poor you will
[50:28] always
[50:29] have but me you not always have so when
[50:32] Jesus said it you can take it to the
[50:33] bank the poor you'll always have
[50:35] there'll always be a need Among Us why
[50:37] because the scripture tells us to take
[50:39] care of one another's needs so how can
[50:41] we keep that scripture unless there's
[50:43] needs that pop up Among
[50:45] Us right so how are we going to keep the
[50:47] scripture unless amen every once in a
[50:50] while we have we have need Amen in our
[50:53] body in ourselves amen a feeble feeble
[50:55] mindedness nervousness anxiety fear amen
[50:58] you can't say well just get over it no
[51:00] that's not what the Bible
[51:02] says Comfort the feeble minded that's
[51:05] our job to comfort one another you say
[51:07] well you should have more faith than
[51:08] that that's not what the Bible
[51:11] says it says Comfort the
[51:14] feeble-minded support the
[51:18] weak support the weak and be patient
[51:21] toward all
[51:23] men say thank God he gave us
[51:26] Commandments to
[51:29] keep man there's other Commandments that
[51:31] we want to keep and there's other
[51:33] Commandments but these are the things
[51:35] that are daily all around
[51:38] us brother brandham in the message the
[51:40] indictment he was speaking early in the
[51:43] indictment just about a sister who was
[51:44] struggling sister Edith Wright I believe
[51:47] is her name she was
[51:48] struggling and he says the human being
[51:50] has two changes in life they have the
[51:53] change from a boy to a man from a woman
[51:55] from a girl to a woman about 6
[51:57] 17 years old they get like a bunch of
[51:59] fly by nights and if you can just suffer
[52:01] with them during that age
[52:03] suffer
[52:06] longsuffering if you can just suffer
[52:08] with them during that age I got a
[52:09] daughter in that age right now Rebecca
[52:11] pray for her and Billy oh every one of
[52:13] us we came through that little frantic
[52:15] age and so we must suffer with them
[52:18] realizing it's something that they have
[52:20] to go
[52:22] through now look at the next one and now
[52:25] edth with just a changing of the seven
[52:28] years every seven years your life
[52:30] changes so the 7even x 7 you see and it
[52:32] makes it kind of hard and that's a
[52:34] complete change he's talking about
[52:36] menopause now and it bothers the women
[52:39] men usually get a kind of funny carrying
[52:41] on during that time and sometimes leave
[52:43] their wives but women are unfertile
[52:45] after that and we all go through that
[52:47] and we must remember that it's things
[52:49] that we must bear with one another and
[52:52] understand those
[52:54] things I love this
[52:57] there's things that happen in our life
[52:59] and here he's talking about menopause
[53:01] then he's talking about the the
[53:02] teenagers transitioning and in those
[53:04] early teen years from from childhood to
[53:07] to becoming adults and when they go
[53:09] through puberty they hit a little he
[53:11] said a little frantic
[53:12] spell and what did he say do suffer with
[53:16] them because they're going to get
[53:18] through it just suffer with them what
[53:20] you do for Minos just suffer with them
[53:22] but that only applies when you you know
[53:25] you have your chain of life no there's
[53:28] different things that happen to us
[53:29] friend there's different blows that we
[53:31] take in life there's different things
[53:32] that come our way and what we need is
[53:34] somebody to suffer with us Amen to love
[53:37] us through it amen I need I need
[53:39] somebody to love me through whatever I'm
[53:42] going through if it's if it's menopause

[53:50] to suffer me to be patient amen we all

[53:56] come to Perfection yet amen we need each
[53:59] other we need to be patient we need to
[54:02] be forbearing we need to comfort amen we
[54:06] need to not criticize each
[54:09] other every time something goes wrong we
[54:12] need to realize that we're
[54:15] brothers and there's Commandments for
[54:18] Brethren to be
[54:20] longsuffering to be patient to be
[54:25] forbearing I want to throw you my

[54:50] uh is this the sign of the inser he said
[54:53] now all my life since I've been a little
[54:55] boy there's been something that's
[54:57] bothered me and I've had a very odd life
[54:59] and hard to understand even my wife
[55:01] scratches her head and said bill I don't
[55:03] believe there's anybody can understand
[55:05] you and I said I don't understand
[55:08] myself have you ever been in that place
[55:11] when you don't even understand what's
[55:13] going on in your life that you don't
[55:15] even understand why you're feeling the
[55:17] way you're feeling and why you're
[55:18] reacting the way you're reacting but
[55:19] something's going on stress has come to
[55:22] to a point disappointment hurt
[55:24] something's happen you got scared about
[55:26] about
[55:29] something and you know somebody says
[55:31] what's wrong with you and you say I have
[55:33] no
[55:36] idea you know husbands and wives have to
[55:38] do this all the
[55:40] time don't raise your hand but has your
[55:43] spouse ever got in a
[55:46] mood and you don't know why you can't
[55:48] figure it out sometimes they can't
[55:50] figure it out
[55:52] either you know what they need more than
[55:54] anything they need somebody who will
[55:55] suffer with them
[55:57] who will love them anyhow you know to
[55:59] bring him out of that mood faster than
[56:00] anything else brother Bram said he goes
[56:02] I get moody and my wife has to put up
[56:04] with me that's what he said I get moody
[56:06] and my wife has to put up with me I'm
[56:09] glad he said it amen I know none of you
[56:12] other men has ever got Moody but I've
[56:13] gotten Moody before and my wife's had to
[56:15] put up with me but you know when it's
[56:17] all said and done I'm so glad she was
[56:19] patient with me I'm so glad there was
[56:21] somebody who loved me no matter what
[56:25] amen and it makes want to love her no
[56:27] matter what because we're not perfect
[56:30] friends we haven't come to sinless
[56:32] Perfection we haven't got it all figured
[56:34] out we haven't we haven't come to a
[56:37] perfect life where we're never going to
[56:38] make mistake or we're never going to
[56:39] misjudge a situation or we're never
[56:41] going to act wrong or say something
[56:43] wrong that's going to happen how many
[56:46] times do you think that's going to
[56:47] happen I don't
[56:49] know but what we need is to go apply the
[56:53] scriptures and say you know what amen my
[56:56] brother didn't mean
[56:58] it he didn't mean it he doesn't
[57:00] understand he doesn't know let me just
[57:02] bear with him a little while and see if
[57:05] it doesn't work its way out let me just
[57:07] bear with him let me just suffer a
[57:09] little longer and be quiet and be
[57:11] patient for a little bit it'll turn
[57:13] around amen amen sometimes what we don't
[57:15] need is we don't need quick action and
[57:17] quick retribution and jump into
[57:19] something sometimes what we need is just
[57:20] to give it a little time and just cover
[57:22] over it amen and love and be patient and
[57:28] suffer and then see what God will
[57:31] do see if that attitude that idea that
[57:35] concept doesn't just
[57:36] change I don't know about you but I've
[57:38] had ideas that I thought were absolutely
[57:40] right and I remember challenging a
[57:42] minister one time years ago I was just
[57:45] young to the message and I was so on
[57:47] fire and I had read I read the message
[57:49] read my Bible and it was all coming
[57:51] alive and there was a minister and I
[57:52] challenged him on something he said and
[57:54] I quoted a scripture out of this and I
[57:56] said
[57:57] something and boy I was sure I was right
[58:01] and I'm not even going to tell you what
[58:02] it was so don't wait but I was sure I
[58:05] was right but what happened is he was
[58:08] very gracious with me and very patient
[58:11] he said well brother what about this and
[58:13] this and I thought and I stuck to my to
[58:16] my
[58:17] line you know what happened years later
[58:19] I keep thinking about what he said and
[58:22] now here I am that was that was about 20
[58:26] years ago and here I am and I realize he
[58:29] was right he was right I was
[58:33] wrong you know how I feel now about how
[58:35] gracious he was with me I love that man
[58:38] so much more cuz he saw a young brother
[58:41] who was zealous for the word and I was a
[58:43] little overzealous and I was a little
[58:44] too quick and I was a little too this or
[58:46] that but he was so gracious with me I
[58:48] looked back on that brother and I love
[58:50] him so much cuz I know what he did he
[58:52] could have cut me to Ribbons right but
[58:55] he was just gracious with
[58:58] me amen I don't think we've got it all
[59:01] right
[59:02] today but let's let's forebear one
[59:06] another let's be longsuffering amen
[59:09] let's forgive the way Christ forgave us
[59:11] if Christ could suffer with me all of
[59:13] these years listen I look back on myself
[59:17] just couple years ago just 10 15 years
[59:20] ago I look back and I say I was so
[59:21] immature I missed so much I
[59:23] misunderstood so much I got so things
[59:26] wrong and I had my own ideas mixed in
[59:28] with stuff and I look back and I'm
[59:32] ashamed amen well if God was forbearing
[59:35] with me that whole time and
[59:37] longsuffering with me that whole time
[59:38] why can't I do the same for my brother
[59:40] that's in the same spot today maybe a
[59:42] little immature maybe got the wrong idea
[59:44] maybe just a little too quick on the
[59:48] trigger but why can't I just be patient
[59:51] with him amen and just longsuffering
[59:56] and
[59:56] forbearing I think it would go a long
[59:59] long way friends I look back I thank God
[1:00:02] that he was bearing
[1:00:06] me and I want to read one more scripture
[1:00:08] and I want to end tonight because I
[1:00:09] don't want to go too late let's we're
[1:00:12] doing really good on time let's go to
[1:00:13] Luke chap
[1:00:14] 12 I intentionally made myself stop
[1:00:18] studying because I wanted to have a
[1:00:20] shorter service
[1:00:21] tonight
[1:00:24] so Luke chapter 12:
[1:00:34] 48 Luke 12:48 but he that knew
[1:00:39] not he that knew not and did commit
[1:00:42] things worthy of strip shall be beaten
[1:00:43] with few stripes for unto whosoever much
[1:00:46] is given of him shall much shall be much
[1:00:49] required and to whom men have committed
[1:00:52] much of him they will ask the more
[1:00:59] for whosoever much is given of him shall
[1:01:02] much be
[1:01:04] required I believe we've been given
[1:01:07] much God has given us so much of his
[1:01:11] word so much of his life so much of his
[1:01:13] understanding he's given us so much and
[1:01:16] he's requiring that we live
[1:01:19] it he's asking us to live it but better
[1:01:22] than that he's giving us opportunities
[1:01:24] to live it yeah and we've missed those
[1:01:27] opportunities I missed I missed I can't
[1:01:30] tell you how many but I don't want to
[1:01:32] keep missing the opportunities I want to
[1:01:34] catch them when they come because he's
[1:01:36] given me so much he's given me his life
[1:01:38] his love he's he's he's showed me what
[1:01:40] he's done for me and how he's bore with
[1:01:42] me and how he's forgave me and how he's
[1:01:44] loved me amen and all he's asking me to
[1:01:46] do is just turn around and give the same
[1:01:48] out and he's given me opportunities to
[1:01:51] do that and I see the opportunities as a
[1:01:52] disaster and a failure and the most
[1:01:54] horrible thing that ever happened to me
[1:01:56] but it might not be the most horrible
[1:01:57] thing that ever happened to me it might
[1:01:58] be the greatest gift that God ever given
[1:02:00] me was an opportunity for me to give out
[1:02:02] what he's given to me because to much is
[1:02:05] given much is required and much is given
[1:02:08] much is asked for God has given us if we
[1:02:10] say God has given us this message he's
[1:02:12] given us his life he's given us the Holy
[1:02:14] Ghost he's opened our eyes and opened
[1:02:16] our standards then God can ask much from
[1:02:19] us amen because only whom little is
[1:02:22] given he can only ask little but if he's
[1:02:24] given you much then he can ask much amen
[1:02:27] and we claim that he's given us much we
[1:02:30] he's given us so much he's opened our
[1:02:32] understanding he's he's revealed himself
[1:02:34] he's unveiled himself he showed himself
[1:02:36] if he's done all of that for us and he's
[1:02:38] given us much then he has the right to
[1:02:40] ask us for
[1:02:42] much and he can ask us to die to self he
[1:02:47] can ask us to surrender our pride he can
[1:02:50] ask us to forebear and suffer and
[1:02:53] forgive one another and I think he's got
[1:02:56] every right to ask for
[1:02:57] it you know what I want to give that to
[1:03:00] him I want to surrender myself so he can
[1:03:02] have that kind of life in me let's all
[1:03:06] stand musicians if you'll
[1:03:10] come Jesus was longsuffering with his
[1:03:14] disciples they were wanting to take the
[1:03:17] kingdom by force they W want to call
[1:03:18] fire down from heaven they were wanting
[1:03:20] to refuse even Jesus to be crucified
[1:03:23] Peter even took out a sword and tried to
[1:03:25] kill a man to defend Jesus and and we
[1:03:27] had the whole wrong idea all together
[1:03:28] and they wanted to be the greatest in
[1:03:30] the kingdom and they wanted to argue
[1:03:31] about it they wanted all kinds of things
[1:03:34] and he was patient with them because he
[1:03:35] knew they would eventually get
[1:03:37] it but you know what brother brandham
[1:03:39] had to be patient
[1:03:41] too can you imagine that man seeing the
[1:03:44] visions that he saw of the unfolding of
[1:03:47] the Seven Seals and knowing what that
[1:03:49] knowing what that opening of the seventh
[1:03:50] seal was and knowing what it was and
[1:03:52] having to keep quiet and not to explain
[1:03:54] it and knowing all the Brethren are
[1:03:55] missing and he and he gets discouraged
[1:03:57] because nobody's catching it and if you
[1:03:59] go and watch questions and answers on
[1:04:00] the seals it's probably the most
[1:04:02] discouraging moment of his life I can't
[1:04:04] imagine after what he's preached after
[1:04:06] the questions that are asked how he
[1:04:07] discourages this because all week he's
[1:04:09] saying I hope you're getting it I hope
[1:04:11] you're catching it I hope I don't have
[1:04:12] to take it out of my hand and show you
[1:04:13] I'm just waiting for somebody to jump up
[1:04:15] and say I see it brother Adam he's
[1:04:16] waiting at any minute for them to
[1:04:18] realize the the the magnitude of the
[1:04:20] event the gravity of what's taking place
[1:04:22] and in the questions and answers they
[1:04:24] ask him if it's all right to wear pants
[1:04:25] P hose and dye their
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:29] hair but if you listen to him answer the
[1:04:31] questions listen how gracious he
[1:04:35] is how patient how forbearing they're
[1:04:39] not getting it and at the end he says
[1:04:40] now I know you're not getting it you're
[1:04:42] not supposed to get it yeah he come to a
[1:04:45] realization and and in many ways he was
[1:04:48] all alone yeah he was all alone he was
[1:04:52] like Jesus in the midst of the disciples
[1:04:54] they loved him but they didn't
[1:04:55] understand Amen brother B was surrounded
[1:04:57] by people that loved him but didn't
[1:04:59] understand and got wrong ideas and wrong
[1:05:02] Concepts and wanted him to do things
[1:05:04] that were just totally
[1:05:06] contrary but he was so gracious he was
[1:05:09] so patient with all of them amen he
[1:05:11] could have cut them all to ribbons for
[1:05:13] asking about dying hair wearing this or
[1:05:17] that but he was
[1:05:19] patient said oh God help me help me to
[1:05:23] act like thaten
[1:05:25] to give my brethren the benefit of the
[1:05:27] doubt to love them no matter what is
[1:05:29] there immaturity Among Us yes there's
[1:05:32] still some immaturity in
[1:05:34] me if sometimes somebody gets a little
[1:05:37] overzealous yes that's going to happen
[1:05:40] maybe sometimes somebody will get the
[1:05:41] wrong idea absolutely maybe even
[1:05:44] somebody will make a mistake or say
[1:05:45] something they shouldn't have said will
[1:05:47] it
[1:05:49] happen what a golden opportunity let the
[1:05:52] word live just let the word live just
[1:05:56] say you know what it's okay Lord if I
[1:05:59] heaped up all the things you forgave me
[1:06:01] for and were patient with me about and I
[1:06:04] put on a scale what other Brethren have
[1:06:05] done to me this far outweighs this
[1:06:09] little bit
[1:06:11] amen amen let me remember what he's done
[1:06:14] for me and what he's given to me and
[1:06:17] when he asks for something back I want
[1:06:19] to give him back because he's given to
[1:06:21] me
[1:06:23] abundantly amen let's bow our heads and
[1:06:27] pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you God
