take my life [Applause] that you come in with me amen God bless you let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you so much for this tremendous Revelation you've given us in this day God you've taken the veil off Lord so that we can see what your great plan has been and God we find ourselves by Grace a part of that plan God there's a gratitude that Wills up in US Lord that we can hardly contain we don't know how to express our gratefulness Lord and God your goodness to open our eyes to give us the eyes have to see Lord we know it's by grace God I pray that this morning that you would come and take your place at the head of the table that you by your own hands would break the Word of Life Lord and feed it to each one of us I Surrender myself to you Lord help me to get out of the way may you take control of this vessel may you Minister Lord to your people Lord the word that you've reserved for this hour Lord to bring us to a greater place live in us live through US manifest yourself in your people in this end time we pray Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you I mean while we're standing let's turn to the Book of Matthew together just uh we we got word this week and we send it out to you that they found the body of sister Donna Howard's father who'd been missing for about four months and and uh you know we thankful that they have closure and that they know what happened but it's a fresh disappointment it's fresh pain for her and the family so just remember her in prayer they still haven't got details together for the funeral yet it looks like it'll be down in the Dayton area so when that comes out we'll send it to everybody but remember sister Donna in prayer as this has been a really really difficult trial really long trial and now it's like fresh all over again so just remember her in prayer and also remember brother Daniel and sister Caitlyn and their family and all those that are helping they've got a wedding coming on Saturday and this is a busy week so be remember them in prayer we're looking forward to Saturday and seeing what God has done amen let's look at Matthew Chapter 5 together and let's let's go to verse 17 Matthew chapter 5. verse 17. she said think not that I'm come to destroy the law or the prophets I have not come to destroy but to fulfill preferably I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one Tittle shall and no wise pass from the law to all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven for I say unto you that accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven as you have heard that it was said by them of old time you shall not kill whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of counsel and whoever shall say thou full shall be in danger of Hell Fire Let's skip over to verse 27 now ye have heard that it was said by them of old time that thou shall not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart man God bless you as you're seated we'll look into this scripture amen you can go ahead and pull up the slideshow brother Franco Jesus is saying that he didn't come to destroy the law but to fulfill it and then he makes a statement that is really interesting he says in verse 20 he said accept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall no wise enter in the kingdom of heaven and so now you can imagine being the people standing there that day when the scribes and the Pharisees were the were the religious The Devout of the day the Pharisees were the very strict devout of the day you could say like the legalist of the day and they had everything in order they had broadened their phylacteries they had the word abound on their wrist and bound on their forehead they had even come up with extra rituals and extra Traditions to be extra religious and extra right to be extra righteous and now Jesus is looking at them and says accept your righteousness exceed their righteousness you can't enter in to Heaven can you imagine how defeating that would be if you were the common person not religious and and not not not a Pharisee and maybe had some problems maybe had some troubles and kept tripping over your own feet then Jesus says accept your righteousness exceed their righteousness amen you can't enter into the Kingdom of Heaven amen you would feel totally defeated because how could you outwork the Pharisees but Jesus was referring to a different kind of righteousness not that kind of righteousness not a trying harder working harder doing more adding more rituals showing more devotion it wasn't that kind of righteousness there's a righteousness that can exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees and the scribes and then he goes on to talk about points of the law he said of old time it had been said that it's wrong to kill your brother but he says then if you're angry with your brother without a cause you're guilty of murder now Jesus went and took beyond the law amen Beyond keeping an ordinance and keeping obedience to a set of rules now he brought it right down into the heart that now if your heart is even wrong towards your brother you're still wrong then he says of old if if thou uh says of old if if you commit adultery amen you're guilty he says but if you even now I say unto you if you look after a woman to lust after her you've committed adultery already with her in your heart and now Jesus just made what was difficult harder because then your your righteousness has to exceed that and you thought you weren't allowed to kill you're not even allowed to be angry without a cause and you you weren't allowed to commit adultery and you may have had enough willpower to hold yourself back but what about your passions and lust and the secret going on in your heart what about that and now all of a sudden everything got harder praise God and I think that's a good thing um so today I want to I want to teach on this righteousness by justification by faith by grace so it's kind of an odd name but it speaks for itself righteousness by justification by faith by grace so the root of it all is Grace by Grace we can believe if we believe we can be justified if we're Justified we're declared righteous it's pretty simple amen it's amazing what the message has done to take the most fundamental doctrines of Christianity the basics of the basics and just they just explode amen they just open up on whole new levels and and I want to go into this it's been on my heart amen the Lord's been dealing with me in this direction for a little while and I just want to teach on it so I pray that you stay engaged today just because we're teaching doesn't mean you can go to sleep and and you know we always have to rehearse these things they go deeper and deeper but also we have new Believers we have young people coming up and growing and and they must be able to handle the word and understand where they stand in the word amen so we we have to constantly go over these but you know we talked over before it's like an ego when an eagle flies higher amen an eagle will Circle to catch the updraft so he keeps circling in the same general area but every time he circles he goes a little higher and a little higher we may Circle back over maybe some things we've understood or taught before it may be in a way review but each review with the open book takes us higher amen so righteousness by justification by faith by grace praise God I couldn't think of any other title anything better let's go to Romans 3 together and let's read this together Romans chapter 3 verse 19. Romans chapter 3 verse 19. now this could be an absolutely daunting subject huge we could go into it again and again and again uh for a series but I don't want to do that I just want to hit on it so I've I've pulled together some of the scriptures and quotes that came to mind under the inspiration and and there's so many more but we're just going to hit these and keep moving and try to paint the picture Romans chapter 3 verse 19. now we know that what thinks whoever the law saith it say to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God so now there's a purpose to the law the law was to stop every mouth and to make everybody guilty the law was not to make everyone righteous the law was to make everyone guilty because everybody had to know they were guilty amen so that they would they would be primed to receive Grace so now that was the purpose of the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law by work nay but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law now when when Paul is preaching this my I mean he's preaching this and he's going into synagogues and he's going to city city city by City And even though he's going into the land of the Gentiles he's starting his ministry always in synagogues amen so he's dealing with the Jews and then from the Jews to the Gentiles and you can imagine being a Jew in that day and you've been taught the law the law the law of the law of the law all your life Moses law and now there here comes here comes a Jew coming along teaching that you can never be justified by the law that the law was not meant for your justification it was meant for your condemnation it was meant so you would understand sin that every mouth would be shut and everybody would become guilty that's why the law was here amen but now by the grace of God he has sent a propitiation or somebody to pay the price to cover you and to give than shed their own blood to pay for all the sins that were committed in violation to the law so that by faith in that amen he by his grace can declare you righteous not because you are righteous because he declares you not your rights you're righteous by faith not righteous by Deeds praise God so we want to keep going oh my goodness there's so many things I'd love to go line by line because it's so amazing that this is expressing the righteousness of God that God is always righteous he's always upright he's always correct he's always proper amen he's never unrighteous he's always righteous amen and God has done it this way so that he might be just and the justifier so just means that he's perfectly right there's nothing wrong there's no fault in what God is doing so he is just and he is also a justifier so if he is just Amen to justify means to bring you in the same condition he's in because he's just and if he justifies you he declares you just just as if you never did it clean and upright incorrect amen so I'm going to look at this in verse 26 again to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believe in Jesus so that he would remain righteous so that he would remain his righteousness would be intact and he would remain just amen he couldn't just violate his own law so what he did is he came himself and he paid the price for his own law he suffered the consequences of his own law so that he could be just and the justifier of them that believe in Jesus praise God I want to look at these words righteousness the word righteousness and justifier justification they're very similar words they're one right after the other in in the concordance amen and they have very similar meanings righteousness is the state of him who is as he ought to be righteousness to condition accepted to God this is the state of him who is he ought to be righteous you're in the right standing you're upright you're as you ought to be you're accepted by God Amen let's look at this word justification if you look at the number here in righteousness this is 1343 that's the reference number in the concordance the very next word is 1344 and it's a word that's similar Amen in its justification and it's translated justify be freed be righteous justifier to render righteous are such he ought to be to render righteous not listen to render righteous means he makes you righteous or as such he ought to be to show exhibit events one to be righteous such as he is and wishes himself to be considered to declare pronounce one to be just righteous or such as he ought to be praise be to God I am so thankful that he is both just and a justifier that he can pronounce me to be righteous amen not because I'm righteous by what I've done with my deeds and my conduct amen but because he has Justified me and declared me to be righteous this is the foundation fundamental teaching of Christianity this is what separated law and Graces what separated the Jewish religion from Christianity so I love this to render righteous so to justify is to render you righteous or to declare you or to pronounce you to be righteous can you imagine standing in court in all the world against you and all the evidence and all these things and and you're standing there and the judge pronounces you just and righteous and you get to go free praise God we were in that position amen we were in that position we were born in sin amen shaping to iniquity coming to the world speaking lies born and under hybridization amen born a sinner born with enmity against God we come to the world this way amen but by the price of propitiation amen there's a price paid that can erase all of that and declare us just amen but we have to come God's provided way to this justifying pronouncement Amen to pronounce righteous and the only way we can get there is by faith praise God we'll get to that in just a minute second Corinthians chapter 3 it says who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the letter intended to kill that was the job that was the goal but the spirit giveth life but if the administration of death written in engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away Moses was so when he went and got the law and he came out to give the law amen there was such a glory in the giving of the word of God the law of God that Moses face shown that he had to cover it that's how glorious the law of the giving of the law was but that was the glory amen that that the law shall some point be done away which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious so if that was glorious this should be more glorious Earth administration of condemnation be glory much more that the administration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious if the law was glorious if the receiving of The Commandments of God of the whole Showdown on Mount Sinai if all of that was glorious this is more glorious it excellent in glory but there's two phrases here that I want to highlight the administration of condemnation this word Administration means Ministry the ministry of condemnation and the ministry of righteousness one was a Ministry of condemnation before this he calls it the ministry of death the ministry of death and the ministry of condemnation amen was it the word of God yes was it glorious yes is it perfect yes is it beautiful yes amen but we in our fallen condition can't keep it it's glorious it's perfect it's magnificent it's glory amen but we're unable amen and that's the purpose of the law to show us our condition that we are unable and we need a justifier so the there's a Ministry of condemnation but now this is the ministry of righteousness now I I want to look at it as the ministry of righteousness meaning righteousness is being ministered the ministry of condemnation by the very fact that the word was ministered it condemned so the ministry of the law brought condemnation and guilt into the human race but this is a Ministry of righteousness that will bring righteousness to the human race minister to them not not earned by effort indeed but Ministry of righteousness amen praise God all right Philippians chapter 3 but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ ye doubtless and count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so I don't want my own righteousness because the law came to show me that I have none but I want the righteousness that is of God by faith amen that's the one that I want and it's through faith in Christ and so I just want to look at this uh for a minute I put these on the overhead because I want to go fast through the scriptures instead of us slipping but you can jot them down there's quite a number of them if we go back to Isaiah 64 6 it says but we are all as an unclean thing that word all do we have to put up the definition of that or do we understand all do we have to go to the concordance or do we really understand all we are all as an unclean thing in all our righteousness are as filthy rats the very best that we've done is filth all our righteousness it says filthy rags and we all do fate as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away in the Psalms David says the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one Psalms 143 1. David says hear my prayers O Lord give ear to my supplications and thy faithfulness answer me in thy righteousness he's not asking about his rights this is he said in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified David is saying Lord in your faithfulness and in your righteousness deal with me not in mine that's what David's saying Lord I'm imploring your righteousness I'm imploring your faithfulness don't enter into judgment with me for for in thy sight shall no man living be justified can't happen this is the death to legalism there's no way that legalism will ever work it didn't work for the Jews it won't work for Christians it just won't work it can't work we've sometimes tried to make it work and all of us in different ways have taken ideas and it just doesn't work we'll get into why Romans chapter 1 says for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the creek Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith that is as it is written the just shall live by faith and he says in Galatians 3 wherefore the law was our school master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith the law was never intended to justify us the law was to teach us to teach us about how far away we were about how impossible it was how reformation and legalism and rules were never going to bring us into a Justified state but that we could be justified by faith it was the teacher to bring us to justification by faith we had to try and fail and try and fail and try and fail and try and fail until God would open a door to another way amen because we tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed and that happened all through the the history of the Jews tried and failed and tried and failed but in our history too we've tried and failed and tried and failed but I thank God there's one who tried and he made it the first time he tried and didn't fail and when he didn't fail amen he became worthy to be the lamb to be the propitiation to stand in our Gap because he didn't fail on the law so now he became our substitute he took our place amen so that we could be justified by faith praise God now let's turn together to Ezekiel keep your place in Romans we're coming right back to Romans but let's go to Ezekiel and read for just a minute Ezekiel chapter 33. this is a an amazing scripture Ezekiel 33 and let's begin reading in verse 10. therefore thou son of man speak unto the house of Israel thus you speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we Pine away in them how shall we then live say unto them as I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked so God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turned from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will you die o House of Israel therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people thy righteousness the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression this is a big saying I'm going to read it we'll go back and break it down as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trusts to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousness shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it is amazing let's go back and look at this a little bit carefully verse 12 second for the second line there third line the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression you can be righteous if it's a righteousness by the law if it's righteousness by works and by Deeds you can be righteous all of your life amen until one transgression and one transgression now none zero zero zero of your previous righteousness will cover this transgression now you are a transgressor now you are guilty of the law and worthy of death this is what he's telling the nation of Israel let's read this again this the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression so your righteousness won't deliver you the day you transgress you can't say I have a stockpile of righteousness I have a thousand Good Deeds a thousand times I obeyed the one time you failed is your destruction that's why the law was a Schoolmaster all right let's keep reading now this is what I love ask for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turned from his wickedness so all your wickedness before you're not going to fall in the day you turn from your wickedness now all that can be erased praise God so shall the righteous be able to uh in the turn from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth when I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trusts to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousness shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it I say my goodness there is no hope outside of Christ there is no hope outside of Grace amen and the problem is there's there's a Temptation amen through some legalistic ideas there's Notions of man that creep in all around I mean all these Spirits they don't die none of these Spirits die everything that's ever been has always been amen these spirits that they fought in the Bible were fighting today and this legalism Creeps in and tries to bring a security by Good Deeds Done right and then there's a comparison there's always the the security always comes into comparison and that's the that's the fallacy the security comes into comparison because I'm better than this I'm okay amen better than bad does it make you good less Fallen doesn't make you restored right but but also on the other end your whole pile of wickedness doesn't offset your turning to the Lord so it's not it's not like when man thinks and man looks and man Begins the way and you've done all of this and and and and all of this and I've done all of this and surely God will accept this and not that no my friend you can have somebody who live Wicked all of their life but turn to the Lord and God will cover all of that wickedness and declare them just and righteous and you can live clean all of your life and then go to wickedness Amen in all of your cleanness doesn't count now and all of their wickedness doesn't count now that's why I'm so glad we don't live under the law amen I get tired of having to be good for like a whole day let alone the whole week and then a whole life you just get wore out you just get exhausted but God didn't that that was a that was intended to teach us some things so that we can come to a whole nother way now look at this in the way of comparison the legalism Luke 18 verse 9 and he spake this Parable into certain which is trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others I want to ask you don't read anymore I have to go back because everybody reads ahead now have we ever seen I mean don't Point any fingers or call any names but have we ever seen those who trust in themselves and despise others trust trust in their own righteousness and look down on others that's an evil spirit and that Spirit listen very carefully that spirit is not there to destroy the wicked that spirit is not there to destroy the unbeliever that spirit is there to destroy the person who has that attitude the person who will be destroyed is not the one they're looking down upon but they are destroying themselves so here's what Jesus says speak this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves and they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other Republican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as men are other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess and the public is standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breath saying God be ver be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified Justified it's what Jesus says this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted themselves shall be abased and he that humbled himself shall be exalted you know what the the the spirit that would cause a man to be puffed up or legalistic or self-righteous that Spirit on that man is actually to keep that man from being righteous what the Pharisee Spirit or the spirit of legalism that would cause a man or woman to be self-righteous to look to their good deeds in Good Conduct for a level of righteousness that spirit is actually to keep them from being righteous because righteousness comes through humility repentance and recognition of what God's done for you not what you did so that spirit is actually to keep somebody away from righteousness not to make them righteous it's the opposite it does the opposite of what you think it would do but this Publican who is ashamed he was ashamed of himself ashamed of his sin acknowledging where he was didn't even so much as look up into heaven with his shame and smote upon his breasts and say God forgive me a sinner he went down to his house Justified he was forgiven that that Spirit of humility and Brokenness amen was actually pushing him to righteousness the spirit of Pride and self-righteousness was pushing him away from righteousness praise God amen God when he gave the law he wanted the people to need salvation by faith that's the point he wanted them to need something other than their ability to keep rules let's look at Romans 10 together Romans chapter 10. verse 1. Romans chapter 10 verse 1. Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved if I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness oh we just learned through the scriptures that that won't work we've just seen through the Old Testament to the scriptures that your own righteousness is a failure so for they being they were ignorant of God's righteousness and they were going about to establish their own righteousness that's why they were adding tradition to the law they were adding to tradition of washing pots and washing hands and different things they were adding tradition to the law because they were establishing their own righteousness the more they did the better they felt but it was a deception amen because it could never bring righteousness because they can never change amen their fallen nature they needed something else another life amen let's keep going uh they for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth now the law won't make you righteous Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to those that believe for Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is a face speaketh on this wise say not in thy heart who shall Ascend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised them from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made into salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen the righteousness of faith is in Us by faith and coming out of us by what we say what we testify to what we confess it's in Us by faith I want to jump over to Roman back to Romans 8 really quick let's go back to Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8 and let's look at verse 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so now we're talking about the call the elect for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren listen our predestination is made clear here we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of a son you are predestinated to be like Christ that's what we're predestinated for not to not for a new ritual not for a new religion a new movement a new form of religion that's not what our predestination is for our predestination is so that we will be conformed into the image of his son amen that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called then he also Justified whom he justified then he also glorified when were you Justified before the foundation of the world that's the same place I was predestinated that's the same place that God's call God's uh By God's foreknowledge it all took place in God's mind amen and then it's been playing out down through time but who God predestinated them he called whom he called he justified whom he justified then he hath already glorified amen I was justified in the mind of God when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world but now God's God's playing it out amen demonstrating out what was in his mind praise God so now verse 31 what shall we then say to these things so now what do we say if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it who's going to call you guilty amen when God has Justified you who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us praise be to God who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it you weren't justified by your Deeds by your right actions by your right conduct by your willpower amen you were justified by grace by grace so now who can charge you acts 13 says be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man is preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and by him all that believer Justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses Moses could not justify you from all things and actually we know it was there as a school Master to bring condemnation but by but by him all that believe are Justified from all things that even the law of Moses couldn't justify you from but if you believe then you can be justified from all things and this is to me so amazing because you know there's a there's a an easy believism Doctrine you know around the world that all you got to do is believe and what took place historically and if all you'd believe is what took place historically that Jesus Christ God Came In the Flesh of Jesus Christ and he died on the cross to pay the price if you just believe that then you're Justified from all things but you remember when Jesus came on the scene amen the the Pharisees they were believing their Bible they were believing their Bible they were believing Moses they were trying to keep the ordinances amen but Jesus Christ was the word made flesh Jesus Christ is the word made flesh so Christ is the word made flesh and now the word was made flesh and Dwight Among Us and while he was there he was the word he was the law he was the prophets he was at all and then he was there in fulfillment of it all amen and they were rejecting him but holding to the historical God right and they were not justified by holding on to the historical they were justified by receiving present tense truth the word amen and and when you receive Christ you receive all that he ever was the law of the prophets the Patriarchs the Psalms the Proverbs all that he ever was he is and when you receive the I am you get what he was if you look to what he was but reject the I am what do you have you're in the same place the Jews were in the day that Christ was walking on Earth that's not the place we want to be so to him and by him all that believer Justified from all things let's look at Galatians Chapter 2 now Galatians Galatians chapter 2 verse 16. Galatians 2 and 16. knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ I love that the faith of Jesus Christ not just faith in Jesus Christ but you need the faith of Jesus Christ you need the original faith amen let's read that again knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves also are found Sinners is there is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid for if I build again these things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor he's speaking against the judaizers and those who are stuck in between because just above this he says that when when certain Brethren came from James unto um Antioch amen that Peter separated stuff from the Jews and started practicing some of the old Jewish traditions and separating and not eating with the Jews and and and Barnabas was carried away into dissimulation and Paul had to bring a correction to that and now he's talking about that if I make myself a sinner again what have you done you've separated you've gone back to the law and Kenny with a gentile you've made yourself guilty again that's what he said so now if I if I'm if I make my righteousness by if I make my justification in righteousness by keeping of the law I have just made myself guilty all over again I've just condemned myself that's why legalism today is so dangerous because if I make keeping the law and keeping the doctrines amen my salvation I have just condemned myself again because all my righteousness doesn't count the day of my iniquity and all that I did before doesn't count the time of my transgression so if we build again those things that we destroyed how shall we be saved if I build again the things which I destroyed Verse 18 I make myself a transgressor for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God he wasn't even living it by his own faith human Faith he was living by the faith of the Son of God the original faith who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness came by the law then Christ is dead in vain amen praise God I think it's amazing these these scriptures this principle is so amazing but it's so amazing too the spirits don't die and we have to fight those same Spirits sometimes and like I said before I I am not interested in loose living in fact there's many things many convictions personal convictions that I have that I never preach because they're for me because of where god holds me to and holds me back from and things that I'm not free in my spirit to do that I Don't Preach that because I don't believe in loose living I don't believe in claiming uh justification by faith through Grace and then I will go out and live contrary to the word and contrary to the nature of Christ I don't believe in that but neither do I believe that me you know following my own convictions and doing everything that I can see the prophet say the message that doesn't equal my righteousness either Paul says now the life I live I live in the flesh I don't live it but Christ I live by the faith of the son of God not living by my own faith not living by my own efforts I'm not living by all of that now I'm living by the faith of the Son of God the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God I do not frustrate the the grace I do not frustrate Grace because all the law keeping in the world doesn't produce justification it doesn't produce righteousness righteousness is imputed declared put on you by God by grace we're going to look at that so I hope nobody thinks we're going in another Direction it doesn't understand where I'm going I believe if the spirit of Beethoven was in me I'd write symphonies and I also believe that if the spirit of Dillinger was in me I'd rob banks so whatever spirit I have received will manifest itself in my life and if I have received the spirit of Christ who is the anointed word I will live the anointed word I will live the word so I'm not going to claim Grace and make it a disgrace by living another life it just shows that I have another Spirit that's operating in my control tower praise God that's the difference that's the death of legalism but it's not the death of a Christian Life the death of legalism is not is not freedom to live any way you want well no it is freedom to live any way you want it is it's freedom to live any way you want and if you want to live some other way than the word in some other way than what the prophet God I would go back and think of what Spirit you've received because the spirit of Christ says Amen to the word it's the word Spirit of the word saying Amen to the word and lining up to the word so if I want to claim Grace and the Liberty in Christ and go and live in a way that's contrary to the word that God has given us and the instructions through his mouthpiece in our day then I'm I'm questioning to me I would go back and question why you have such Liberty to violate a prophet of God and violate instructions from God and violate the word of God where did that Liberty come from so you see the truth is always down the middle not on this side and it's not on this side the truth is down the middle so uh Second Corinthians 5 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him I want to ask you is the righteousness of God a good righteousness I mean what level would you put that on I put it up top the righteousness of God I haven't made myself and I haven't earned or worked my way up to I have been made placed put conditioned imparted however you want to say it I might be made the righteous of God in him it's God's righteousness to justify because God Amen as a righteous God as a just God he paid the penalty himself to free us and that gives him the right to make us we we become his righteousness money justifies us because he's already paid the price amen Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that Abraham our father is pertaining to flesh has found for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereupto Glory but not before God for what saith the scriptures what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness Abraham believed God and it's not that Abraham was doing righteous because we know some unrighteous things that Abraham did we can read the Bible but because he believed God it was counted unto him for righteousness are imputed or put on or accounted to all right let's say somebody wants to give me a million dollars and I'm open to that so it doesn't just have to be a parable I mean it can Manifest this if somebody does a transfer into my account think about this they have made me a millionaire it was accounted unto me or imputed unto me I did not make myself a millionaire I did not make myself righteous I did not make myself just Abraham did not make himself just Abraham did not make himself righteous amen but all Abraham did is all that he could do because he was the seed of God is Abraham believed God and if somebody says brother Chad I want to transfer a million dollars into your account and I believe them and give them my account number and my routing number and I believe them amen all listen all I have to do in order to receive the million dollars is believe them and they will impart it into my account and now it's counted unto me and I've been made a millionaire but if I don't believe them and I don't surrender and I don't acknowledge and I and I hold back then I'm not going to be a millionaire it's pretty easy so that doesn't have to just be a parable I mean it can flesh out if we wanted to so Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt wow God owes me God I paid my tithes I went to church I've listened to the message I read my Bible every day like the prophet said you now owe me no God's not in debt to you if God gives you anything it's by Grace not by debt God didn't owe you salvation he didn't owe you Deliverance he didn't owe you provision he didn't owe you healing he didn't owe you anything and all of your good deeds is not going into a bank account that someday you can cash into God for an exchange of services if we get anything it's by God's grace because he wanted us to have it and he wanted to give it to us he made the provision he made the way when we come his provided way then he by his grace fulfills his promise and his word and gives us what he's promised to give us not by debt but by grace him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace but of dead but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness not because what you did but because of who you believed in even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquity are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin I want to be one of those Romans chapter 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith unto this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God so now we've been brought into peace we've been justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ because God was appeased by the sacrifice it brought us in peace now we were separated by sin but the but the but the sacrifice for sin restored Unity by whom also by Christ whom also we have access by faith to this grace is available how do I access the grace Grace is to the elect Graces to God's children how do I access that grace through faith through faith I access the grace so so that's part of why my title says righteous righteousness by justification I'm not righteous by Deeds I'm righteous because he said you're Justified he's the justifier when he says you're just just as if you never did it before that makes me righteous because he said I'm just how did I become just by faith how did I have faith by grace by grace oh God is so good for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so praise be to God by grace I have faith by faith I've been Justified and by being justified I've been declared righteous righteous by justification justification by faith faith by grace and when it's all said and done what did we do anyhow for he put a seed of predestination down on the inside of us and gave us a receptor to the word and something to believe with by his grace which is his love at the end of the day no wonder no wonder we throw our crowns at his feet no wonder we give Glory and Honor unto him because what did we do anyhow if we could get to this place we're all Pride all self-sufficiency all arrogancy all all of this nonsense can fade away and we can get to the reality that I am here by Grace I'm saved by grace I'm kept by Grace it was all in God's mind before the foundation of the world I didn't Merit it I didn't earn it I didn't do anything he determined before and and he requires now that to enter into this grace you must access it by faith but he gives you a seed of faith and grants and unlocks the faith so that you can believe so that you can apprehend the grace so that you can be justified and declare righteous all I can say is thank you Lord thank you Lord and when we know the vessel that he used to purchase our freedom was when he made himself a body to dwell in amen that's why amen that's why I'm looking forward to today that I can see him in flesh because by that flesh that was the Lamb of God by that vessel that contained the blood of God that went to Calvary and shed his blood for me freed me from the bondage of sin so that I could go free by the grace of God it would be a pleasure for me to bow at those feet we know that's not this dispensation but I'm looking forward to it because it's a privilege to say thank you thank you thank you for what you did for me I don't think anybody's going to be proud and the married supper I knew I would be here I I told God I prayed every day I I come on if we get there it'll be his grace and we'll be so thankful amen but I love this Ephesians 2 8 I love how it says it starts off for by grace are you saved through faith that honor of yourselves is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast you can't be proud about obtaining this grace you can't be proud about believing you can't be proud listen we can't be proud about believing neither should we be angry with others who don't believe Because unless we had a seat of predestination unless we were part of that predestinated plan of God Amen we couldn't believe so we can believe because he predestinated his true belief that doesn't make us better or proud or arrogant all it does is put us in a position by grace and so now I can't get angry at those who don't believe I should have pity sympathy remorse and intercede for those who can't believe because I'm in a different position by God's grace I should I should say oh God help them amen amen help them to see open their eyes I shouldn't get angry at them I shouldn't throw stones at them why should I go to another level why should I lower myself to a level of unbelief and conduct like unbelievers like I don't know why I hate I'm here and who I am so so now all of a sudden because of the position I'm in by Grace now I have sympathy and now I I have pity and I have remorse when somebody just can't see and I can say God open their eyes and if they're not predestinated unto the word amen just give them the heart to show respect amen just give them the heart to be kind Lord because I want to see them saved in the end enter we want to intercede not you you spoke evil of me and you come against this and you said that I you're going to get it I don't want you to get it that's why if it was up to me right now I wouldn't be a very good judge because if God asked me everybody gets to go free you're like brother Chad would you set the criminals the rapists the convicts would you set them free I would set every one of them free every one of them free because by whatever measure you judge is the same judgment you'll receive and if I analyze my life real quick and all the wrong desires I've had and that sticky conquerber nature that's still there amen amen how can I condemn when I can find the seeds of those things still in my flesh and the ability to do the same thing is still there the only thing keeping me from it is the Life of Christ on the inside so how in the world can I condemn if it was up to me right now in the state I am now I say everybody goes free everybody gets a pass it doesn't matter what you do you get to go because by whatever judgment I judge that would be needed to me that's why something has to change in us before we get to the white Throne judgment so that we can actually have righteous judgment because right now I want everybody to go free get a pass what about the people who have wronged you I want them to have a pass because if I and I pray there's people who have wronged me just done wrong said wrong said things that weren't true it just wasn't right and I pray that God forgives them and I pray this way God do not ever hold them accountable for me I forgive them and don't judge them on my account as far as I'm concerned they're free now whatever happens is not because of what they did to me because I forgave them why because I have said wrong things about other people I've said things I shouldn't have I gossiped when I shouldn't have I I condemn somebody before I knew all the details and I'm not talking 10 years ago I'm talking probably this past week I had something wrong I misjudged something I said something a little too quick and passed the Judgment amen and so what if that what if that person wants to hold me accountable for my actions and I went home I say God let them go amen let them go on my account don't judge them because of me I forgive them remember it was Jesus who was nailed to the cross and said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and it was Stephen who was being stoned amen and as he was being stoned he says father lay not this sin to their charge and who was standing there consenting to the stoning watching over the garments of those that were stoning it was Saul who would become Paul amen and what would have happened to Paul if so if if Stephen would have said God don't ever forget what they did and hold every one of them accountable Hey listen Stephen was the son of God with authority and a power and and listen if he if he wouldn't have released them I don't know what would have happened but there it is stoning he released everybody who was doing him wrong so that God could come by and pick up Saul later did Saul suffered first wrong yes it's all have regrets absolutely did God deal with Saul's the son yes absolutely but I often think what would have happened if Stephen would have said God don't ever forget what they did to me listen when the Patriarchs the sons have gone fast when they spoke it happened when they blessed it was blessed what was cursed was cursed Jesus nailed to the cross the fence was against him in the flesh he said father forgive them and just 40 days 50 days later 50 days later at Pentecost 3 000 were saved I say thank God I want to dish out Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy I I regret the times that I haven't I regret the times I've been hardlined and hard-nosed and critical and legalistic I regret them all because I want people to have Grace amen I'd rather God judged than me judge because I hate Boomerang judgment through it and it comes back I'm sending the message we would see Jesus notice and here he stood doing exactly the Messiah sign in just one now and then I'm sorry I jumped ahead of myself I got off on a tangent I want to hit this before I get to that next quote we're saved through faith and that not of ourselves is the gift of God by Grace We're safe through faith not of Works lest any man should boast now look at the next part for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them he's immediately addressing the situation of works will you do righteous Works absolutely The Works won't produce righteousness but but your faith will produce works we are his workmanship we're his creation created in Christ Jesus to do good works God didn't call us and create us to do evil he didn't create us to compromise on the word he didn't bring us into salvation for us to live any way no we are created unto good works that he had before ordained that we should walk in them God knows how we're going to walk God knows what this conversion will do God knows what this Grace will produce God knows what his life and the individual will produce and he's already ordained that we walk in those good works praise be to God and James let's turn to James chapter 2 together I don't want to leave this little bit undone I want to hit it right now James chapter 2. James chapter 2 verse 17. all right James 2 and 17. even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone listen it looks like James now is going to contradict Romans contradict Paul but Ephesians already laid this out it showed that we're saved by grace through faith and not out of ourselves not of work since any man should boast but where his creation ordained in the good works but we're going to produce good works this is what James is really pointing to he says if so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yea a man may say thou has faith and I have worked show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by by my works thou believe isn't that there is one God thou thou do as well the Devils also believe and tremble so he's what Paul what I'm sorry what James is saying is you believe there's one God the Devils do but they don't do righteous work your faith should produce a different life so somebody says I believe two people say I believe just watch their life what they believe will manifest itself this is what he's saying amen oh where am I uh verse 19 yeah thou believest there is one God thou do as well the Devils also believe in Trimble but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was it not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar listen the the Apostle Paul said he was justified by faith and now James was saying wasn't he justified by works let's just look at it see us now how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect or complete perfect doesn't mean that Faith was imperfect and it needed Works to make it perfect this perfect means mature or complete When Faith Comes to Perfection it lives a life it produces the work and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and then sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also all right there's no contradiction they're saying the same thing from a different angle all the righteous works that Abraham could do would not produce righteousness but faith when he believed God it was imputed in him for righteousness and the Very evidence that he had Faith was that he obeyed what the voice told him to do and his obedience was a declaration or the full maturity or the Perfection of his faith showing that he did exactly he said I believe if you would have said If Abraham would have believed God and was accounting him for righteousness but he didn't go off for Isaac he didn't believe God so how could he be righteous if he wouldn't go do what God Said do does that make sense so his righteousness is imputed because he believed God not he believed in God the whole world believes in God nearly the by and large the majority believes in God it wasn't that Abraham believed in God that got him righteous he believed what God told him in his day he believed the present tense truth he believed the word for his hour he believed God and it was imputed in him for righteousness but if he would have said I believe God but never would have moved from his Camp never moved with Isaac never went to Moriah never went to make an offering his very Works testify he doesn't believe right but when he believed God he went into action to do what God told him to do in the hour that he lived and when he went to perform the word of God Amen now James is looking at this as the Fulfillment or the Out product or the perfecting of his faith so if I say that I believe the message of this hour amen but I don't believe what the message says then I'm giving evidence my faith is not come into Perfection yet amen but when I believe that this word is true and then my life begins to line up to the word amen though my life becomes evident that I believe praise God you can't get it backwards praise the Lord brother Ben says in the message perseverance speaking about this these two passages of scripture he says and the whole armor of God is Faith love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience the whole armor of the believer is faith we believe God by faith because God said so then what is it Abraham was justified by Paul by faith but by James by works Abraham was talking what God saw and James was talking what man saw show me your faith by your Works without your works and so forth see then if you don't have works with your faith it shows you haven't got faith you're just talking with your mouth but if you really got faith you believe in act like it that's right put it in action so that's what they're talking about the two sides of the same picture he goes on in here to say in this message notice here he stood doing exactly the Messiah sign and just one now and then of the Jews would believe him now there was those there who would not believe him and you couldn't say they wasn't good men no sir they were good men they had to live good you couldn't say they wasn't honest and upright and couldn't wouldn't cheat or steal no sir but them things don't save you it's not by Good Works you are saved if good works would it would have done it Christ wouldn't have had to die you see it's a birth Brother Bear is bringing it now to the birth amen the new birth you see it's a birth you've got to be born again you just got to be there's no way out out at all out sorry there's no way at all out of it except a man be born again he will know why see the kingdom now look sin is not lying stealing during I I'm going to scroll this text up because this is an amazing part of this quote and we just quoted a few weeks ago sin is not lying stealing drinking committing adultery that's not sin that's the attributes of unbelief the only sin there is is unbelief the only righteousness there is is faith not Deeds the only sin there is is unbelief the only righteousness there is is faith amen unrighteous Deeds come from unbelief righteous Deeds come from Faith from The Life of Christ on the inside you've received the faith of Jesus Christ and it produces the life of Jesus Christ that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes and we don't fail but it's the life within us that brings us to a quick repentance and lines us back up to the word and keeps us walking that way it's a different life the only righteousness there is is faith Titus says not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration this is the new birth by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost not not by works of righteousness it's not the good deeds and the good things we've done that's not what did it but according to the mer his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration you becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus and by the renewal the Regeneration and new creature by becoming a new creature of the Holy Ghost that's how he saved us by the new birth Romans 5 he says but God commending his love towards us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life what life resurrected life where is his life it needs to be in me I need to be saved by his life amen reconciled by his blood reconciled by his death amen but saved by his life I need his life in me Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation Christ's life in you makes him the sinner of the revelation Christ's life in you doesn't make you a puffed up arrogant religious but Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation in you Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you said well brother banham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen not you joined the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon and that is receiving the faith of Jesus Christ his life in me the message thirsty says we always say today people try to say we compare we've got to compare Bible leaf with Bible Leaf I read this a few weeks ago as well scripture with scripture that isn't the truth no it isn't the truth this Greek word means this this means that the Greeks themselves way back in the 90s Council and Dem Riders back in there they had different forms one believed this way this Greek scholar meant this and the other one said this one meant this way and they fussed over him we don't need interpretation of Greek Scholars or Greek words to know him as life we're saved by his life amen we're renewed and regenerated by the Holy Ghost to know him as life the person Christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that God built his church upon and if if we don't build upon that same church the Bible said Abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right this whole thing is built upon the Revelation then unless this is revealed to you Jesus said I thank the father that thou has hid these things from the wives of the world and revealed it to babes such as we'll learn see now the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person and you cannot satisfy that by joining Church you've got to find the person God himself which is the word and interpretation of himself today the promise that he made today listen brother Branham never remember he doesn't leave it in the past he brings Christ present tense he brings Christ on the scene today because he is the anointed word today amen and so now we must meet the person of the word which is present today not where he was but where he is because the light was there but now the light is here and we must meet him in the light and walk in the light of our day and we need to meet a living Jesus Christ present today amen the historical Christ is the one who made it possible to meet him today what he did in the past he's still the same if you get Christ you get all that he ever was you get the law you get the prophets you get everything you get Calvary you get it all because it's all in him remember we said before if I if I want what he did previously believe that but reject what he did today I'm cutting myself off you cannot satisfy this by joining a church coming to the right church with the right Doctrine and believing the right thing and having a belief of the right thing amen that's not enough you must meet him personally the Christ of today what is a new birth Jesus Christ revealed to you personally not to a group not we all got it but I met this Christ that the prophet's talking about I came in contact with the current life present tense true life and it came and it lit something in me and it came to life and now the life I live I live in the flesh by the faith of the son of God now all that he ordained for me to do I will do and I think this beats legalism by a million miles amen because now there's nothing that I have to do everything is what I want to do my whole desires and nature has changed under a new birth amen I mean it's it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that the the the say it this way that the farmer took an eagle egg and hatched it under a chicken that didn't make it a chicken whatever the nature in the seed was is what it is that makes sense so he tried to be a chicken but he was a lousy chicken he was a failure as a chicken but when he heard the eagle scream it woke up what he was on the inside and brought him to himself and brought him alive to the fact that he was an eagle not a chicken right and he flew away listen the new birth reveals what God always intended for us to be but we were born under the wrong nature and that nature has to die amen and there has to be a regeneration a newness of Life a new creation amen and that seed that God had predestinated in Us by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost has got to come to life and whatever that seed is is what we will live if it's never been quickened we'll still live some sort of hybrid life trying to be a Christian trying to do this but not but when it comes to life it just begins to live its own life and and every creature lives what's in the seed Every Creature lives what's in the seed and so now it produces that life that new birth when it when when the seed is quickened you're a new creature in Christ now that seed takes over and begins to live and now it doesn't smoke because it doesn't want to smoke not because it's not allowed to smoke it doesn't look after a woman to lust after her not because it's not allowed but because it doesn't want to and even if the flesh has Cravings or Temptations the desire in the heart doesn't want it and pulls the flesh back in line with the desire of the heart because the Nature has changed the seed has been quickened the life is in there and now we don't have to we don't have to keep ordinances to be righteous we've been declared righteous and now we have the freedom to live the life of the seed which is the word which will live the word which will manifest the word and it's not so difficult as living legalistic living legalistic is horrible terrible it's bondage there's no Liberty you have to do this you have to do that you have to do this and all it does is create inner tension in turmoil but a new birth is absolute freedom because then the ego just learns how to Flap learns how to catch a breeze and learns how to fly and it is not flying is as natural for an eagle as as anything because it was born to fly and living a Christian Life is a natural for a Son of God as flying as for an eagle because you were born to live the life your newborn birth releases you from the bondage of sin amen into the newness of life to be what you were always intended to be and now all you got to do is stretch your wings a little bit and fly and now living a Christian Life is natural to the life on the sea in the seed praise God so in this quote president said the whole church is based on Revelation Revelation Revelation amen not mental agreement but Revelation quickened to you personally and this is the scripture that goes to in Matthew 16. when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiahs are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it why will the gates of hell not Prevail against the church because the church is on the foundational Rock of the revelation of who Jesus Christ is and guess what he's present I'll say it this way he is he is now flesh and blood cannot reveal this to you but the Father which is in heaven can reveal to you who he is not just was who he is this is the foundation that the church is built on the revelation of who he is and with that Foundation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the church visible union says but still you claim to be very religious so was Cain The Prostitute is some very religious build altars offered sacrifices paid his tithes done everything that any other religious man would do but he failed to keep that word he failed to have the revelation he was good in so many ways he was wrong in one he didn't catch the revelation then after that he turned against his brother and the Revelation is the only thing the revelation of the word what is a revelation Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you Abel by faith offered by Revelation Faith offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain Able by Faith by what Revelation so what is this faith that we're saved by and justified by what is this Faith it's a revelation the same thing the church was founded upon and still founded upon amen is a revelation that is faith it doesn't praise God it takes a revelation to believe a present tense I am God it doesn't take a lot of Revelation to believe what the whole world believes historically took place but it takes Revelation to believe in a present tense I am gone and that Revelation is Faith the faith that gives us access by Grace Amen to be justified and to be declared righteous Hebrews 11 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it him being dead yet speaketh amen he offered a more excellent sacrifice because his sacrifice was according to his revelation he realized that it was blood that got him out of the garden and it's going to take blood amen and that God offered a lamb and he offered a lamb his Revelation was manifest in his works and by it they witnessed his Works witnessed that he was righteous amen this is before the law before the law God had righteous servants Abel was righteous Abraham was righteous the question is how were they righteous they were righteous by faith before the law the children of God were declared righteous by faith because they believed God Abel believed God Abraham believed God they didn't believe the same part does that make sense they believed the present tense God the I am God The God Who was coming to them by Revelation and giving them the word for their day and when Abel received the Revelation for his day he was declared he witnessed that he was righteous when Abraham received the the instructions from God the word of God for his day it was imputed unto him for righteousness praise God then the law comes and then all the Deeds started amen but before the law remember the law came as a failure of Israel to keep the word of God and come up into the mountain and exodus to come to Sinai they ran away and brother bam said that's where they made their fatal mistake in Exodus 19 they chose law over Grace God wasn't going to give them the law he was going to give them Grace all he was going to give them was the Ten Commandments and that was it the book of ordinances and all the laws and the rituals it came after they turned from God and sent Moses up God was going to deal with them with Grace where they would receive a revelation of the word and when they and that Revelation as they believed it would be imputed unto them for righteousness that's how it was before but now that the law was fulfilled in Christ and he became the ultimate sacrifice freeing us from the bondage of the law it has gone right back to what it was before now it's righteousness by Faith by a revelation in your God in your day in Jesus Christ today you see how the message opens the whole Bible things that are fundamental to Christianity they've been absolutely lost they've been they've been they've been hijacked amen and they they've made it repeat after me prayers repeat after me I believe Jesus died for me on a cross 2000 years ago and and they're repeating this and they're acknowledging what happened amen and and declaring people to be righteous and to be justified but my goodness the Revelation from the Bible is everybody who had imputed righteousness who was declared righteous or witnessed to be righteous were people who believe the god of their day the I am present tense God and the Bible so opens up the Revelation the truth of justification the truth of righteousness and the message has taken us back to the realities of these things now listen I hope you don't misunderstand me either somebody with an honest and sincere heart who is blinded to the message and all they can do is believe in historical God and stay true to that I believe they'll receive a reward for that I'm happy for that but but that doesn't put them in the place the elector in by the imputation of righteous declared just by faith it's different but I say if they have no capacity to see anymore let them live all that they see and praise God at the white Throne judgment interest to life can be granted and I want it for all but for the bride God is declaring us righteous now we've passed condemnation there is no judgment for the bride because by Revelation she has been declared just and righteous praise God and can we be proud about that revelation no you couldn't receive it unless there was a seed of eternal life inside but what a consolation the word brings us just want to read two three more things now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation that's where I want to say just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is a built upon the revelation Hey listen you can't say I'm trying to have faith I'm trying to have faith you can't try to have faith brother man said faith is subconscious you've got it you don't even know it because faith is in you amen amen it doesn't mean you don't exercise your faith brother man said that's human Faith it's Acorn Faith hold on to it until it grows into real actual Faith perfect Faith amen but but you can't just press yourself in the faith faith is sovereignly given it's the grace of God I thank God for that amen I'm not going to go into this one I'm gonna skip it John 6 says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me it's a really interesting scripture the question is where is he where is he I said he is earlier is Christ present tense is he here so in order to come to him the father must draw you to him to where he is presently where he is under the revelation of the hour under the manifestation of Christ in your day if he's drawing he's drawing to where he is and this is what he says in the scripture every man therefore that hath heard before and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not after you learn of the father do you come to him but you learned before the question is where did you learn before when you were in the mind of God Amen there's a seed inside of you a gene of God that was there that knew the Plan of Salvation amen that had it revealed when you were in attribute form and that attribute now is alive in you something in you heard from the father and was taught from the father and can can come alive at the present tense word and say that's the truth amen I've heard that before you ever heard of preaching or brother bam say something or somebody bring out a scripture or quote and you know you never heard it before but something in you heard it before it had a familiar sound it had that real ring and you said that ain't nothing but the truth amen how did you know it wasn't nothing but the truth you never heard it before how did you go verify the facts did you go back 2 000 years ago did you go into that little room where Hattie Wright was Hattie Wright wasn't where the squirrels were but something in her knew that that was the truth because she had heard from the father before and been taught with the father before amen and there's things that we can't prove we can't get the evidence we can't go get the facts we don't need them the evidence is inside amen not external inside and it's by revelation of present tense truth that God brings us to Faith where we can apprehend by Grace Amen to justification and righteousness that God is imputing unto us and I say thank you God it's nothing I did but I believe it with all of my heart I can't not believe it I I can no more disbelieve this than than anything else amen no more disbelieve it than a fish can just believe it's a fish I mean you are what you are you can't help it I don't believe because I'm trying I'm not trying to believe amen I believe I Can't Help Believing when I first came to the message I believed in spite of the difficulty I believed when it was inconvenient to believe and difficult and painful and hurtful and I still believed praise God amen let's finish up and we read over there in Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my word now the real translation is that not he the heareth that's the King James the real translation in the Hebrew is this he that receiveth my word not he that heareth anybody can hear it Sinners everybody else but he that receiveth can take it all not he received one of my words he that receiveth my word and believeth on him that sent me when you receive the word you receive him everything he said that you are willing and happy to do he that receives my word and believes on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not go through the Judgment but has passed from death into life oh what a promise and if we walk in the light as he is in the light that would be the light that's shining today that's the light we have to walk in if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin I wrote down here musicians if you can come please brother John if you'll make your way up Christ's death freed us from the bondage of sin faith in Christ today links us to what he did for us at Calvary I can't walk back there and stand there at the cross and say I believe this right I wasn't alive then but when I receive him now he's the same one who died for me remember brother Ben said the word bled for you the word died for you what was nailed to the cross the word made flesh what was bleeding the word made flesh amen what what was that that was the word the word was nailed to the cross the word bled for me the word died for me so now if I want the I if I want the effect of Calvary I must come to the word in the present day word already bled for me when it was in flesh form and when I received this word that life from the word which was released at Calvary which was the Life of Christ the life of that word can come into me amen is my atonement showing me that the blood was shed for me that I'm part of that I was purchased under that shedding of the blood amen and so now the word that I received today is the same word it's part of the same word that bled for me at Calvary same Jesus Christ same one he's here now and I want to say Lord I believe you not because I'm smart not because I'm religious I believe you because something in me believes you because you've made me to believe you you've caused me to believe you've drawn me because I heard you before and was taught by you somehow you have drawn me and unlocked something in me to believe and I know that that's by grace and I say thank you Lord for this Revelation that's the faith I need to be declared just and righteous and let's all stand oh I just thank God for his word thank God we are not the bride is not righteous because she knows how to dress we got to get that notion out of our heads the bride's not righteous because she knows how to dress and she knows the truth about marriage and divorce and she's not getting caught up in that and she knows about morality has been restored to the church that's not what makes her righteous what makes her righteous is that she believes and it's imputed under her for righteousness how does she believe because God put it in her to believe not righteous because we look like Christians and talk like Christians and act like Christians that's not what made us righteous he made us righteous but we look like Christians and talk like Christians and act like Christians because we are Christians because Christ dwells within us we have compassion on people we uphold the word we line up to the word continually because we are Christians because Christ lives inside it's that simple I'm thankful I could have never lived this life I tried to be a good Pentecostal boy and I really tried and I failed and I failed and I failed and I failed I tried I knew it was right and wrong I knew what God wanted I knew what the Bible said on certain things and I failed and I failed and I failed but by the grace of God he quickened something inside of me and it's not the life I live anymore it's a life he comes inside and lives through me and now so many things have left so many desires so many things are gone amen and it's not even that I willed them to go away they just left amen and as I keep growing more desires change and more things fall off and it's the grace of God as the tree grows it just puts out more fruit and what where is the Life coming from it's coming from the root I thank God for that man let's bow our heads and pray together dear Lord Jesus we thank you for this word God I pray Lord that it would strike us Lord maybe in a deeper way or a clearer understanding that we would understand how great your grace is what a wonderful thing you've done for us in the day that we live in for Lord you have given us a revelation of yourself and before you ever revealed yourself in this end time you saw that we would be here with your seed inside of us you knew it and Lord you knew how to move us in position to come in contact with that life and you knew when the light struck the seed it would come to life so Lord you watched over our lives and you made sure at the right time we came in contact and Lord there was a life laying in the seed that needed that sun it was a germanized seed it needed to be quickened you knew when the water fell under the light hit it that it would come to life and that it would produce your life its own life God we're so thankful when we look back of our Lives we would have ruined our lives we would have fallen a thousand times over we would have gone the wrong direction and every choice we made we would have done it all wrong if you hadn't already had a plan well we just want to say thank you that you gave such a word in such a way just like when you were here thousands hundreds of thousands maybe millions could not receive you but there was a few who could the little woman at the well the Harley who washed your feet the publican the fishermen they had something in them that they could express a faith that believes you and God we're just like those individuals in a world where Millions maybe billions will disbelieve there's something in us will say We Believe that this message is Christ this word that's been restored as you Lord you're here you're present you're dwelling in your bride we see your manifestation in the end time in the formation of your bride and we receive it and we accept it Lord thank you for giving us that kind of faith thank you Lord for giving us Grace by your righteousness by your Justice you can justify us because we believe your word I'll go with your people bless us as we go help us to stay rooted and grounded in the revelation of the truth that's been restored may we never waver or falter or have self-doubt Lord may you help us to stay established on these truths may they give us confidence to continue marching forward and boldly proclaiming Lord your life in this world we give you our lives and ask that you would take control in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen bless you brother John
