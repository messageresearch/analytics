[6:23] for granted amen
[6:24] i want to come with expectation and i
[6:26] want to come
[6:28] ready to hear the word amen
[6:31] amen we have such an opportunity in this
[6:33] day
[6:35] you know when jesus looked at his
[6:37] disciples and say
[6:38] prophets and many wise men have longed
[6:40] to see this day
[6:42] i say oh what a day is this day long to
[6:46] see this day to know these things but we
[6:48] thank god
[6:49] for the privilege of being here now
[6:51] let's look at job 38
[6:55] and verse 6. job chapter 38 and verse 6.
[6:59] whereupon are the foundations there are
[7:01] fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[7:03] thereof
[7:04] when the morning stars sang together and
[7:06] all the sons of god
[7:08] shouted for joy i want you to
[7:11] notice that all the sons of god shouted
[7:15] for joy
[7:16] not just some or just a portion but all
[7:19] the sons of god
[7:20] shouted for joy let's bow our heads and
[7:23] pray
[7:23] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[7:25] lord it means so much to us god
[7:28] we pray now that you would come like
[7:30] only you can lord
[7:31] that you would break the bread of life
[7:33] lord with your own hand
[7:34] may our eyes be opened to see you lord
[7:37] as you break that bread
[7:38] and feed it to us your sheep and may we
[7:40] take that food lord
[7:41] may we gain strength and may we be
[7:43] pleasing to you in all that we do
[7:45] have your preeminence among us we pray
[7:47] in jesus christ's name
[7:49] amen you can be seated
[7:52] i'm going to read a few quotes uh for a
[7:55] title i just
[7:56] titled this the cycle of reconciliation
[7:59] the cycle of reconciliation and i just
[8:01] hope you bear with me as we
[8:03] as we go into this i've got several
[8:04] quotes to read and we just want to see
[8:06] what the lord
[8:08] will show with show us and reveal to us
[8:10] through the prophet's message and
[8:12] and i'm going to uh share from my heart
[8:14] some things that are
[8:15] that are hearing the message that i see
[8:18] and it's amazing how
[8:19] how the the by the grace of god
[8:22] things we've looked at for years it just
[8:24] gets clearer and
[8:26] clearer and clearer things we've
[8:27] scratched our heads at things we've
[8:29] pondered over it gets clearer and
[8:30] clearer
[8:31] but i would say this the more clear it
[8:33] gets and the more things we see there's
[8:35] still some things we're scratching our
[8:36] heads about amen
[8:37] we're still and we're just trusting the
[8:39] lord to bring clear
[8:41] clarity and greater revelation all the
[8:43] time so we just want to look at this and
[8:45] uh
[8:45] the message christ is the mystery of god
[8:47] revealed
[8:48] prophet of god says so my opinion the
[8:51] first thing that he made was angels and
[8:53] and when they worshipped him and that
[8:56] made him god and he started from there
[8:58] as in previous messages i've tried to
[9:00] explain it and break it down
[9:02] and now when when angels began to
[9:04] worship him that was before there was
[9:06] even a molecule on the earth
[9:07] there was nothing it was all darkness
[9:09] there wasn't no sun or no moon nor stars
[9:12] nor nothing
[9:12] when he was god as he asked job where
[9:15] was you
[9:16] when i laid the foundation of the world
[9:18] see when the morning stars sang together
[9:20] the sons of god shot up for joy see
[9:22] now where were you see that that was
[9:25] way back before the earth so i want you
[9:28] to see brother
[9:29] when he refers to this that was way back
[9:31] before the earth
[9:32] and he says several more quotes that
[9:34] we're going to read in the message
[9:36] serpent seed from 1958
[9:38] he says i want to ask you who is this
[9:41] job
[9:41] 27 38 when when he said where was you
[9:44] when i laid the foundation of the earth
[9:46] when the morning stars sang together and
[9:48] the sons of god shouted for joy
[9:50] who were those sons of god that was
[9:52] shouting for joy
[9:53] jesus told them that i had joy with you
[9:55] before the foundation of the world
[9:57] we're not creatures of time we're
[9:59] creatures of eternity
[10:01] no man can come to me except my father
[10:03] draws him and all that comes to me
[10:05] i'll give them eternal life and raise
[10:07] them up at the last day
[10:08] no one can pluck them from my father's
[10:10] hand he give them to me
[10:12] how how you going to lose
[10:15] amen if you were there if all the sons
[10:18] of god shouted for joy
[10:20] i tell you what i'm a son of god are you
[10:23] a son of god
[10:24] if all the sons of god shouted for joy
[10:26] then i must have been shouting for joy
[10:28] there
[10:29] because i can't be excluded from all the
[10:31] sons of god
[10:33] and praise be to god let's turn to john
[10:35] 15.
[10:36] i just want to read this with this
[10:39] understanding that the prophet of god
[10:40] just gave us
[10:42] because so many times we can read the
[10:44] scripture john chapter 15
[10:47] and we can and we know scripture be can
[10:50] can be
[10:50] can have a dual meaning uh especially
[10:54] prophecy but all scripture can have
[10:55] a dual meaning a multiple fulfillment
[10:58] and a revolving history it can have a
[11:00] natural type and a
[11:01] fulfillment and a spiritual fulfillment
[11:03] and so you know
[11:04] brother bannon will even use the word of
[11:06] god that way
[11:07] in fact and when we're speaking here of
[11:09] job 38 brother branham will use this
[11:12] context two different ways
[11:14] and job he says where were you when i
[11:15] laid the foundation of the lord when the
[11:17] when the morning star sang together and
[11:18] the sons of god shouted for joy
[11:20] he says where were you and brother
[11:22] benham will use it to to
[11:24] as in reference to where were you job
[11:27] reminding job where were you were you
[11:29] one of those sons of god
[11:30] but brother branham will also use it as
[11:32] god humbling job and say where were you
[11:36] where did you lay it can you count it do
[11:38] you know where the bounds of the sea are
[11:39] and brother ben will take the same
[11:41] scripture and use it two different ways
[11:44] he'll he'll do the same thing with with
[11:46] the ark amen
[11:48] sometimes the ark was a a type of the
[11:50] 144 thousand
[11:51] and may carried over in tribulation
[11:53] sometimes the ark of the of the redeemed
[11:55] amen that were carried away and never
[11:56] saw tribulation
[11:58] so so so sometimes the scripture will
[12:01] have dual meaning
[12:02] and we look at here at john 15 in light
[12:04] of what brother brahm just said
[12:05] let's look at verse 26.
[12:09] john 15 and 26 but when the comforters
[12:12] come
[12:14] when whom i will send unto you from the
[12:16] father even the spirit of truth
[12:18] which proceedeth from the father he
[12:20] shall testify of me
[12:22] and you also shall bear witness because
[12:24] you have been with me from the beginning
[12:27] which beginning amen the beginning of
[12:30] his ministry
[12:33] or from the beginning of the beginning
[12:34] amen
[12:36] and brother branham when he refers to
[12:37] this in the serpent in 1958
[12:39] and he's showing us he's telling his
[12:41] disciples i had joy with you in the
[12:42] beginning
[12:43] you were with me in the beginning and
[12:44] therefore you'll be my disciples because
[12:46] you were with me from the beginning
[12:48] the question is what beginning amen
[12:52] i say they're both true they were with
[12:55] him from the beginning
[12:56] amen has attributes in the in the
[12:58] thoughts of god but they were with him
[12:59] from the beginning of the ministry amen
[13:01] they're both true so we don't want to
[13:04] exclude
[13:05] one other because of a revelation we
[13:07] don't want to exclude
[13:08] the other meaning as well again in
[13:10] serpent seed he said this is actually
[13:12] the first paragraph in serpent seed from
[13:13] 58
[13:14] he says dear god the great and mighty
[13:16] god who formed all things by the power
[13:18] of his spirit
[13:19] and has brought jesus christ his only
[13:21] begotten son who freely died for we
[13:23] sinners
[13:23] the just for the unjust to reconcile us
[13:26] back
[13:26] into his marvelous fellowship that we
[13:29] have
[13:30] again with god listen
[13:33] reconcile us back to the marvelous
[13:35] fellowship that we have
[13:36] again with god as we are taught in the
[13:39] blessed word
[13:40] that we had fellowship with him before
[13:41] the foundation of the world
[13:43] when the morning stars sang together and
[13:45] the sons of god shouted for joy
[13:46] way back before the foundation of the
[13:48] world how do we know that that wasn't
[13:51] at the same time that the lamb was slain
[13:54] how do we know that that wasn't the same
[13:56] time the lamb was slain that when god
[13:58] and his great thinking
[13:59] seen us shouting and rejoicing in our
[14:02] salvation through jesus
[14:05] we were there amen we were there with
[14:07] god we were there
[14:08] attributes with god the thoughts of god
[14:10] but brother man tells us
[14:11] his thoughts are not like our thoughts
[14:13] amen god's thoughts are real
[14:15] god's thoughts are literal amen they're
[14:17] true they they
[14:18] they are not just something that fleets
[14:20] through his mind and they're there for a
[14:22] moment and they're gone
[14:23] but the thoughts of god amen the
[14:25] thoughts of god are
[14:26] literal the thoughts of god are real
[14:30] and we were there let's turn to ii
[14:32] thessalonians
[14:40] 2 thessalonians
[14:46] chapter 2
[14:53] and verse 13 second thessalonians 2 and
[14:55] 13.
[14:57] we are bound to give thanks always to
[15:00] god for you brother and beloved of the
[15:02] lord because god hath from the beginning
[15:04] chosen you
[15:05] from the beginning which beginning
[15:08] god is from the beginning chosen you
[15:11] amen which beginning the beginning of
[15:12] your journey on
[15:13] in life or has he chosen you from the
[15:16] beginning beginning
[15:17] beginning beginning beginning
[15:21] amen god hath chosen you from the beg
[15:23] god
[15:24] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[15:25] salvation through sanctification of the
[15:28] spirit
[15:28] and belief of the truth where unto he
[15:32] he called you by our gospel to the
[15:34] obtaining of glory
[15:35] of our lord jesus christ so why is it
[15:38] that you believe why is it that you can
[15:41] believe
[15:42] because he chose you from the beginning
[15:44] amen to believe
[15:46] amen to be sanctified by the spirit and
[15:49] it chose you into salvation through
[15:50] sanctification and spirit and belief of
[15:52] the truth if that's how he chose you
[15:54] then you have to believe the truth
[15:57] because we were chosen that way from the
[15:58] beginning acts 15 18 says known unto god
[16:01] are all his works from the beginning of
[16:03] the world
[16:04] so if god knows and god knows all his
[16:06] works he knows who he'll save
[16:09] and we were with him right in 1964
[16:12] brother brandon preached a message
[16:14] called spiritual amnesia
[16:15] and then that message says now to be a
[16:18] true christian you have to be the same
[16:20] we don't want to forget that all that he
[16:22] was i'm identified with him
[16:24] i'm identified with him notice and he's
[16:27] in me
[16:27] and i in him notice that every christian
[16:30] that's a real genuine christian was with
[16:32] him
[16:33] when the morning stars sing together and
[16:35] the sons of god shouted for joy
[16:37] before there was a foundation of the
[16:38] world we were identified in the immortal
[16:41] realms with god
[16:42] 10 million years before the world was
[16:44] ever formed
[16:46] i was back there with him if i got
[16:48] eternal life i was there with him
[16:51] i was identified with him when the
[16:53] morning stars sang together and the sons
[16:55] of god shouted for joy
[16:58] amen he goes on in 1960 in the message
[17:02] the unfailing realities of the living
[17:04] god
[17:04] he says let me say one more thing creeds
[17:08] does not satisfy a hungry heart
[17:11] creeds won't satisfy if a man's
[17:13] hungering for god you tell him say
[17:14] say the apostles creed join the church
[17:16] put your name here be sprinkled or
[17:18] immersed or whatever you want to that'll
[17:19] never
[17:20] satisfy a hungry soul because they were
[17:22] predestinated of god to search for life
[17:27] i mean you realize folks it's not it's
[17:30] not anything we in our humanness have
[17:32] ever done
[17:33] amen seeking for god or finding god or
[17:35] wanting god
[17:36] amen he had already put the wanting in
[17:39] us he put the seeking why
[17:41] because we were back there before his
[17:43] attributes and his thoughts
[17:44] parts of god collected together and gone
[17:46] but in his thoughts
[17:48] god in his thoughts saw us separated out
[17:51] to become sons and daughters of god to
[17:54] be a family to have fellowship with him
[17:56] upon the earth
[17:57] that was his design that was his desire
[17:59] in his mind and he's been working
[18:01] everything to that desire into that
[18:03] design
[18:05] and so that's why we we are
[18:08] a hungry soul that's why we're never
[18:10] satisfied
[18:11] with theology or religion or just church
[18:14] attendance
[18:15] will never be if we were there before if
[18:17] we were an attribute in his mind
[18:19] if you were one of those sons that
[18:20] shouted for joy
[18:22] when you saw the plan of salvation
[18:24] that's what brother man said when he
[18:25] showed you the plan of salvation you
[18:26] shouted for joy
[18:28] that's why you shout now you shout now
[18:31] because you shouted then amen
[18:33] because that that thrilled you then it
[18:36] thrills you now
[18:40] amen
[18:44] that's why we search for life now listen
[18:47] here
[18:47] here's what he says he's going to say
[18:48] something interesting whatever you
[18:50] wanted
[18:52] that'll never satisfy a hungry soul
[18:54] because they were predestinated of god
[18:56] to search for life
[18:57] they was once the angels that was once
[18:59] an angel who did not fall
[19:01] two-thirds of the angels heaven fell
[19:03] that's these evil spirits working among
[19:06] people very religious you know
[19:08] the bible says that you was just not
[19:10] always right here
[19:11] you were once somewhere else
[19:15] remember sin didn't begin on earth sin
[19:17] began in heaven
[19:18] when lucifer taken and made he said i
[19:21] want a denomination
[19:22] make a great big thing went on the north
[19:25] country and set up a bigger thing than
[19:27] michael had
[19:28] and he was kicked out of heaven and
[19:30] those angels back there them spirits
[19:32] when that's the reason when this earthly
[19:34] tabernacle was dissolved we have one
[19:36] already waiting see
[19:37] and that's the reason our name was put
[19:39] on the lamb's book of life before the
[19:41] foundation of the world
[19:42] all the father has given me will come to
[19:44] me
[19:46] but i'm saying you know we were there in
[19:48] the thoughts of god we were there as
[19:50] attributes of god we were with god we
[19:52] saw the plan of redemption we shouted
[19:54] with joy
[19:55] god's thoughts are real they are literal
[19:57] and brother brenham said
[19:58] how do we know that's not the same time
[20:00] the lamb was slain
[20:02] because the lamb was slain before the
[20:04] foundation of the world
[20:06] it was slain in the mind of god amen
[20:08] when god saw the whole plan of
[20:10] redemption
[20:11] and he shared that plan with his
[20:12] attributes
[20:14] and we were those attributes and when he
[20:16] shared that plan we rejoiced
[20:18] we shouted we
[20:22] were excited about the plan of salvation
[20:27] amen now i i want to skip to something
[20:30] and come back
[20:32] but brother bam tells a story but it's
[20:34] the same story tells over and over and
[20:35] over but i'm going to pick it up as
[20:37] in the message as the eagle stirs her
[20:39] nest in 1960.
[20:41] and he's speaking about when he was in
[20:42] mishawaka when he went on that fishing
[20:45] trip when he first come among the
[20:46] pentecostal people
[20:47] and and he was enthused by what he was
[20:50] seeing
[20:51] and he starts to tell the story about
[20:53] the old preacher
[20:55] and he said i felt sorry for the man he
[20:57] could barely get up there and i said
[20:59] and brother man said i thought why are
[21:00] they letting this old man preach
[21:04] and now listen he says now all the
[21:07] brethren had been telling
[21:08] what had been going on down here on
[21:10] earth brother ben was talking about all
[21:12] the preachers they had different
[21:13] preachers preaching in the meeting
[21:14] and brother man was enjoying the
[21:16] meetings he was enjoying the preaching
[21:18] he was joining the manifestation of the
[21:19] spirit and and
[21:21] a manifestation of the spirit and and he
[21:23] comes to this old man
[21:25] and brother branham starts thinking his
[21:26] mind why are they letting that old man
[21:28] up there and they had to lead him to
[21:30] the pulpit they said he was feeble
[21:33] and he said he everybody else was
[21:35] telling what had
[21:36] gone on down here on earth he
[21:39] started back there about ten thousand
[21:41] years before the world was ever formed
[21:43] when the sons of god was shouting for
[21:44] joy and the morning stars were singing
[21:46] together
[21:47] i tell you every time brother ben tells
[21:49] this story this is the text he refers to
[21:53] that this this old man that he felt
[21:54] sorry for was preaching
[21:56] he said that morning when the stars were
[21:59] singing together
[22:00] he brought it across the skies and down
[22:02] the horizontal rainbow in about five
[22:03] minutes
[22:04] directly he jumped up in the air and
[22:06] said whoopee
[22:07] skipped his feet together tipped around
[22:09] there and said you
[22:11] you got you ain't got enough room up
[22:13] here for me to preach
[22:14] and walked off the platform
[22:17] i said brother that's what i want if
[22:20] it'll make an old man act like that what
[22:22] would it do for me
[22:23] and i'm not just 25 years old i tell you
[22:27] it renews is you say amen is that right
[22:29] when the holy spirit comes in
[22:31] it makes the old act young yeah they're
[22:33] become eagles
[22:34] and brother man tells the story over and
[22:37] over and over again
[22:38] but he always referred to this text the
[22:41] man is preaching about what went on
[22:43] thousands of years ago in heaven amen
[22:45] when the sons of god when the stars sing
[22:47] together the morning stars and the songs
[22:48] of god shouted for joy
[22:50] amen and he got so enthused and so
[22:52] excited he it rejuvenated him it
[22:55] refreshed him amen
[22:56] he jumped up and brought him i said
[22:57] clicked his heels you ain't got room for
[23:00] me to preach
[23:00] why they was all talking about in
[23:02] denominational terms what went on down
[23:04] on earth about
[23:05] salvation jesus christ and jesus died
[23:07] but this man was able to go back before
[23:09] that amen
[23:10] he was able to go back in the mind of
[23:12] god by revelation
[23:14] to before what happened on earth amen to
[23:16] to our position before
[23:18] when the sons of god were shouting amen
[23:20] in in the holy ghost
[23:22] struck him amen struck him
[23:25] not during the song service
[23:29] amen the holy ghost struck him why did
[23:31] he strike him he strike him when he was
[23:33] preaching about what went on
[23:34] amen in heaven in the heavenly realms
[23:37] and was reflected down on earth when he
[23:39] could go back and he could find a
[23:40] position for the sons of god
[23:42] way back before the foundation of the
[23:44] world and bring it right down
[23:48] i tell you that's the thing that
[23:49] rejuvenates us that's what brings
[23:51] eagles to renew their strength amen when
[23:53] we when we don't
[23:54] delve in just what's going on on earth
[23:56] we see beyond
[23:58] just what's happening here but we can go
[24:00] back and say this started a long time
[24:02] ago with me friends amen
[24:04] i may have not realized that amen i may
[24:06] have come with spiritual amnesia
[24:08] my soul may have come forth amen when it
[24:10] come forth in this body
[24:11] and i came without knowledge of that
[24:14] amen but there was something
[24:15] in me ingrained embedded in my soul that
[24:18] was there
[24:20] there was a life a portion of life zoe
[24:23] life a germ of life a seed of life
[24:26] something amen was part of me amen that
[24:28] was back there that was shouting for joy
[24:33] and right now when god by revelation
[24:35] opens that up
[24:36] amen there's nothing that can make a son
[24:39] of god
[24:40] more enthused amen not a not a song not
[24:43] a ball game not a
[24:44] anything else that can be as exciting as
[24:46] the revelation of i was with him before
[24:48] the foundation
[24:49] i come from god i go to god i was
[24:52] shouting when i saw the plan of
[24:54] redemption
[24:56] that's why when we come to the message
[24:58] and brother brenham starts breaking
[24:59] these things down
[25:00] amen it's the first time we've ever
[25:02] heard it and it sounds
[25:04] so strange to our ears but so familiar
[25:07] in our souls
[25:08] there's a familiarity to what's being
[25:11] said and
[25:12] it's as if you always knew it
[25:15] but you know intellectually you never
[25:18] heard it before with these ears
[25:20] and in this mind had read the bible
[25:22] never conjured those thoughts
[25:23] it didn't come intellectually it wasn't
[25:26] that you knew it amen but something in
[25:28] you
[25:28] knew it because the first time you heard
[25:32] it
[25:32] you were able to say amen before you
[25:34] comprehended what you were amending
[25:37] before you could understand and piece it
[25:39] together and explain it in detail
[25:41] something in you is saying that's the
[25:43] truth
[25:44] [Applause]
[25:45] oh my gosh god help us
[25:48] help us to see it lord help us to be
[25:51] rejuvenated help us to be excited
[25:53] about the plan help us to be excited
[25:55] about the great plan
[25:57] that you showed us that you revealed to
[25:59] us when we were attributes in your mind
[26:04] let us be excited about that because
[26:06] that's the only thing to be excited
[26:08] about
[26:10] praise god friends praise god
[26:14] i say god help me help me
[26:17] to never allow laodicea in a laodicean
[26:20] condition
[26:22] to blind my eyes again from what god has
[26:24] opened them to
[26:27] if it'll do that for that old man what
[26:29] will it do for you and i
[26:31] it'll renew our strength i want to read
[26:36] another quote from brother branham from
[26:38] 1953 all the way back in 1953 and
[26:41] questions and answers on genesis
[26:44] says when god created me william branham
[26:46] i was before the foundation of the world
[26:49] he made my being my spirit i was i
[26:52] wasn't conscious of anything as far as i
[26:54] know of
[26:55] i was there i don't believe you're
[26:57] getting it but now
[26:58] just a minute jesus told the disciples
[27:01] that he knew them before the foundation
[27:02] of the world
[27:03] and paul said here that he chose us in
[27:06] him before the world began
[27:07] now there was some part of me orman
[27:10] neville and the rest of you all here
[27:12] that's in christ jesus before the world
[27:14] ever began
[27:15] and here's to my analysis of that
[27:18] i think that the people today that are
[27:20] possessed with his spirit
[27:22] or the spirit a part of these angelic
[27:24] being spirits
[27:25] which rotated off of god that never fell
[27:27] in the beginning and resisted the
[27:29] devil's lie in heaven
[27:32] that's what the prophet says amen says
[27:34] all the way back in 1953
[27:36] and he makes several statements like
[27:37] this and and
[27:39] and there's there's things here that i
[27:41] can't comprehend and mechanically can't
[27:43] work it out
[27:44] but i know that there's a truth laying
[27:46] here amen
[27:47] that the prophet knows what he's talking
[27:48] about and and i want to
[27:50] i want to address something that he says
[27:53] in the church age book
[27:55] right now so just give me your attention
[27:57] in the smyrnan church age out of the
[27:59] church age book
[28:00] brother bennett says before i close this
[28:02] subject i know there is a question in
[28:04] your mind
[28:04] you will want to know if i believe in
[28:06] the doctrine of pre-existence
[28:09] good question good question
[28:13] he said i don't believe in the mormon
[28:16] doctrine of pre-existence of souls
[28:22] be careful what he says he didn't say i
[28:26] don't believe in
[28:26] pre-existence he said i don't believe in
[28:29] the mormon
[28:30] doctrine of pre-existence of souls
[28:35] i hope you catch that
[28:38] because if you have zoe life
[28:41] if there's zoe life in you if you were
[28:44] born with that
[28:46] germ of life that germ of life
[28:49] pre-existed
[28:51] because it's god it always existed
[28:55] he says i don't believe in the mormon
[28:57] doctrine of pre-existence
[28:59] of souls but he didn't say that that
[29:02] germ of life in you wasn't somewhere
[29:03] before
[29:05] he never said that he didn't say that
[29:07] germ of life and brother ben said germ
[29:09] of life was to be you from the beginning
[29:11] it was predestinated to be you it was
[29:13] predestinated coming down in
[29:15] manifestations amen
[29:16] amen in that germ of life amen if it
[29:19] come from god
[29:20] if it's part of god if it's zoe life the
[29:23] same life god is
[29:24] that portion of life that attribute that
[29:27] germ whatever term you give it
[29:29] had to pre-exist
[29:33] because it's eternal life i don't
[29:37] believe in the mormon doctrine of the
[29:39] pre-existence
[29:40] of souls any more than i believe in
[29:42] reincarnation or the transmigration of
[29:44] souls
[29:45] be careful here and see this it is not
[29:47] the person that comes predestinated
[29:49] eternally from god
[29:50] it is the word or seed
[29:55] that is it way back there too far back
[29:58] for the human mind to grasp
[30:00] the eternal god with eternal thoughts
[30:02] thought and decreed jacob have i loved
[30:03] but esau have i hated romans 9 13
[30:06] and neither was born and neither had
[30:08] done good or evil
[30:09] see it was the thought and then that
[30:12] thought became expressed and god
[30:14] bought back jacob because jacob alone
[30:18] was seed
[30:20] jacob alone had the seed that is why he
[30:22] had respect to the birthright and the
[30:24] covenant of god
[30:26] if you are true seed you will hear the
[30:28] word
[30:29] the spirit will baptize you into the
[30:30] body of christ filling you and
[30:32] empowering you
[30:32] and you will receive the word for your
[30:34] day and age
[30:36] if you're seed so brother branham
[30:39] says i don't believe in the mormon
[30:41] doctrine of the pre-existence of souls
[30:44] but he does believe in the pre-existence
[30:46] of seed
[30:49] the germ of life the seed of god
[30:52] the zoe life of god the attribute of god
[30:55] we have all kinds of terms for we have
[30:57] all kinds of ways that brother brown
[30:58] labeled it
[30:59] and you have to understand too brother
[31:00] ben will even interchange his language
[31:03] sometimes
[31:03] because i mean we're dealing with human
[31:06] language trying to explain something
[31:07] that is not very explainable
[31:11] and we have human terms trying to use
[31:13] human terms to understand god
[31:15] amen and god transcends amen the
[31:18] language i mean he was before language
[31:20] so brother men will use terms and
[31:22] interchange terms
[31:24] and things like that but we must ask god
[31:26] to give us a revelation of what he means
[31:28] and not get bogged down in the
[31:29] exchanging of terms
[31:32] there was some part of me that was there
[31:35] i was one of the sons of god that was
[31:36] shouting i was there in the mind of god
[31:38] when i saw the plan of salvation and it
[31:40] might have been the same time the lamb
[31:41] was slain
[31:44] praise be to god and we shout it for joy
[31:47] so just because brother brahma doesn't
[31:48] believe in the pre-exist the mormon
[31:50] doctrine of pre-existence of souls does
[31:51] not mean he doesn't believe in
[31:53] pre-existence
[31:57] be careful let's see
[32:01] before i was a soul before i was a human
[32:05] before that soul was embedded into a
[32:08] tabernacle of flesh at my birth
[32:10] before that i i was somewhere
[32:14] i was part of god i was somewhere and i
[32:17] was something
[32:18] because i was a thought okay you're a
[32:19] thought of god but thought god's
[32:21] thoughts are
[32:22] literal god's thoughts are real
[32:25] so i was something somewhere amen before
[32:28] amen this germ of life was in my soul in
[32:31] this tabernacle of flesh
[32:35] and so sometimes what for me has been
[32:37] difficult to understand this is just me
[32:39] personally
[32:41] is when brother branham makes this
[32:42] statement
[32:44] and i'll read it again when god created
[32:47] me william branham i was before the
[32:48] foundation of the world he made my being
[32:50] my spirit
[32:51] i wasn't conscious of anything as far as
[32:52] i know i was there
[32:55] i don't believe you're getting it but
[32:57] now just in a minute jesus told the
[32:59] disciples that he knew them before the
[33:01] foundation of the world
[33:02] and paul said here that he chose us in
[33:04] him before the world began
[33:06] now there was some part of me orman
[33:08] neville and the rest of you all here
[33:09] that's in christ jesus before the world
[33:11] ever began
[33:12] and here's to my analysis of it i think
[33:15] that the
[33:15] i think that the people today that are
[33:17] possessed with the spirit or the spirit
[33:19] of god
[33:20] part of these angelic being spirits
[33:22] which rotated off god
[33:23] that never fell in the beginning and
[33:25] resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[33:28] for me i was having problems
[33:30] coordinating that with brother brahm
[33:31] doesn't believe in pre-existence of
[33:33] souls
[33:34] but he never said anything about a
[33:35] pre-existing soul he said it was just a
[33:38] little spirit little something that spun
[33:40] off of god
[33:41] amen then i began to realize i began to
[33:43] ask myself the question
[33:45] if there's a part of me that's eternal
[33:49] which is god which is the seed which is
[33:51] the word which is the thought
[33:53] which is the germ which is the gene
[33:55] which is the attribute
[33:57] do we agree in that and that attribute
[33:59] was a portion of god that he determined
[34:02] to be me
[34:04] if there's that portion amen my my
[34:07] question then became
[34:09] it can god take that portion and can
[34:11] there be
[34:12] other expressions of that portion before
[34:14] it became a soul in me
[34:17] why not amen why couldn't god express
[34:19] himself here and express himself there
[34:21] and now amen he's expressing himself in
[34:24] this tabernacle
[34:25] there's a germ of life amen but that
[34:27] germ of life was before
[34:29] before there was a foundation in the
[34:30] world before
[34:33] that germ of life was there and so if
[34:35] god wants to take that germ of life
[34:37] and he wants an expression here with
[34:38] that german life an expression here and
[34:40] an expression here
[34:41] amen god is god
[34:44] so now i'm not going to argue with the
[34:46] prophet anymore
[34:48] i'm just going to believe him amen
[34:52] there was some part of me some attribute
[34:54] of god some
[34:56] portion of light attribute
[34:59] that did not fall in the deception in
[35:01] heaven
[35:03] how it works i don't know the mechanics
[35:05] behind it i can't comprehend
[35:07] i don't have the language to explain it
[35:09] but i can tell you one thing's for sure
[35:11] amen i will not fall amen i will not be
[35:14] deceived i will not fall by the
[35:16] deception here
[35:17] if i was there and if i was shouting
[35:19] with the sons of god
[35:20] and singing praises before the
[35:22] foundation of the world amen and i was
[35:24] there in an expression that resisted the
[35:25] devil's lie
[35:26] i'm here as another expression of the
[35:29] same life to resist the devil's lie
[35:31] again
[35:34] and i'll ask you another question how
[35:36] many times has this happened
[35:41] how many times i don't know i'm not
[35:44] trying to say that i know
[35:45] but i know one thing there was there was
[35:48] attributes of god
[35:49] that resisted a devil's lie in heaven
[35:54] because sin started in heaven the war
[35:56] broke out in heaven
[35:58] and then spilled through the earth but
[35:59] between genesis 1 1
[36:01] and genesis 1 2 we find the earth in a
[36:04] state of judgment
[36:06] why is the earth judged
[36:10] what was judged and why was it judged
[36:15] was it just birds and rabbits and trees
[36:17] and then they got judged
[36:20] why was it judged what went wrong that
[36:23] required a judgment
[36:26] why did he have to destroy it with water
[36:28] and that way he would come and know his
[36:30] day and he says i'll no longer destroy
[36:32] it again with a flood
[36:34] because that was the second time as far
[36:36] as we know
[36:39] you see what i'm saying friends there
[36:42] was a
[36:42] another cycle of of something going
[36:46] wrong
[36:48] and something being judged as brother
[36:51] branham comes in the seals
[36:52] and he says and he starts to preach and
[36:55] i believe it's the seals
[36:56] i believe it's the fourth seal many ways
[36:58] he begins to say now
[37:00] when god began to brood over the earth
[37:01] and the holy ghost brewed over it he
[37:02] said let there be light
[37:03] and he said it was bringing them there
[37:05] was seeds that was already there
[37:07] from a previous civilization or
[37:09] something like that
[37:12] what what happened why was the earth in
[37:15] a state of judgment
[37:16] between genesis 1 1 when god made it in
[37:19] genesis 1 2 when we find it judged
[37:21] what happened what was the cycle what
[37:23] went wrong i don't know
[37:25] but i do know about the cycle in heaven
[37:28] and i do know about the cycle from from
[37:31] from
[37:31] the garden of eden to now and we
[37:34] realized that
[37:35] there there's this warfare that's going
[37:37] on and we know that it'll continue into
[37:39] the future
[37:40] because we're in that great final battle
[37:42] now amen of warfare but there'll be
[37:44] there'll be a destruction before the
[37:45] millennium but there's going to be
[37:47] another battle
[37:48] after a thousand year reign
[37:51] how many cycles are there
[37:56] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[37:58] friends there's so much
[38:00] more going on than just what we see
[38:04] there has been so much more going on
[38:06] than just what humans have
[38:08] have collected in the history of mankind
[38:10] there's so much more going on friends
[38:14] and we were there before at all
[38:18] before the falling away in heaven we
[38:20] were there before whatever took place
[38:22] on earth between genesis 1 1 and just 1
[38:24] 2 we were there
[38:26] we were in god we were an attribute of
[38:29] god
[38:30] we were there i don't know why all these
[38:33] things have to be this way
[38:34] but there's something to it friends
[38:36] there's a cycle there's a cycle of
[38:38] falling away
[38:39] a cycle of redemption a cycle of
[38:41] reconciling and we know at the
[38:43] end of these cycles we can see we're in
[38:45] a cycle now
[38:46] we can see after the millennium there'll
[38:47] be another cycle
[38:50] when when there's a resurrection when
[38:52] when the devil is loose from his chains
[38:54] of circumstances and he goes out to
[38:56] deceive the people again
[38:57] and they gather again in the battle of
[38:59] gog and magog and then holy fire from
[39:01] god comes down to destroy the whole
[39:02] thing
[39:02] there's another cycle there's a cycle
[39:05] now
[39:06] that'll end in the destruction in the
[39:08] battle of armageddon before the thousand
[39:09] years but after the thousand years
[39:10] there'll be another cycle again
[39:13] a cycle of deception and falling away in
[39:16] judgment
[39:18] so there's all these cycles but as the
[39:21] cycle cycle
[39:23] as the cycle cycle
[39:27] god is proving his word
[39:31] god is redeeming his attributes
[39:36] and god is judging sin
[39:40] how many times he has to cycle it i
[39:42] don't know but when he's done
[39:44] cycling there is no more
[39:47] sin there is no more devil
[39:51] there is no more unbelief there are no
[39:53] more attributes of unbelief
[39:55] amen and you understand understand what
[39:58] i'm saying
[39:58] god doesn't do anything by happenstance
[40:01] god doesn't do anything just to do it
[40:02] if god does it it's for a purpose and it
[40:04] needs to be done that way
[40:07] god's not playing games god's not just
[40:09] toying around
[40:10] if he's if he set it up and it must go
[40:12] this way and he knew the end from the
[40:14] beginning and he declared all his works
[40:15] from the foundation of the world
[40:17] if he knew it had to be this way then it
[40:19] has to be this way
[40:20] to accomplish his purpose
[40:23] so whatever it takes this is the cycle
[40:26] that it takes
[40:27] to come to a perfect harmony in a unity
[40:30] that was broken
[40:32] because the unity and the harmony in
[40:34] heaven was broken
[40:37] and god is working to bring it back
[40:40] we know that the unity and harmony in
[40:42] eden was broken
[40:44] but eden is only a reflection of heaven
[40:47] so if the unity and harmony in eden was
[40:49] broken and god's working
[40:51] these six thousand years to bring back
[40:53] the eden heart
[40:54] the the unity and harmony in eden
[40:57] then he must also bring back the unity
[41:00] and harmony in heaven
[41:02] because one's reflecting the other and
[41:05] that's what these cycles
[41:07] are doing
[41:10] and that's what we're part of
[41:14] accomplishing something for god
[41:18] brother brahm said in the greatest
[41:19] battle ever fought he said this great
[41:21] first battle that was ever fought began
[41:23] in heaven
[41:24] when michael and his angels fought
[41:27] against lucifer and his angels
[41:29] it first started the first battle was in
[41:31] heaven so sin
[41:32] did not originate on earth it originated
[41:35] in heaven
[41:37] i did not originate in earth
[41:40] i'm not talking about this part of eye
[41:44] this is the temporal part this is the
[41:45] carnal part but this is not the real me
[41:49] but the part of me that was with god
[41:51] from the beginning that was meant to be
[41:53] me
[41:54] the attribute of god that part was there
[41:58] before sin originated in heaven
[42:03] see that's really important to
[42:06] understand
[42:07] because if god is going to restore
[42:09] something back to its former state
[42:11] if you want to be there in the
[42:13] restoration you should have been there
[42:14] in its former state
[42:16] if you weren't there in that form or
[42:18] state then when god restores it back to
[42:20] that former state you're excluded
[42:23] but if god's going to bring something
[42:25] back to what it was
[42:27] before then you better hope that you
[42:29] were there before
[42:33] praise god this is what made that old
[42:35] man click his heels
[42:37] i don't even know if he realized the
[42:38] full revelation of it but the portion he
[42:40] got
[42:41] enthused him so much it renewed his
[42:44] strength
[42:44] it renewed his vigor it got him joyful
[42:47] again
[42:47] and i tell you friends if this can't
[42:49] make us joyful what will make us joyful
[42:52] this can't renew our strength amen what
[42:54] will renew our strength
[42:57] we're not here to be losers we're not
[42:59] succumbing to the trials that are around
[43:01] us
[43:01] we're not here to just be beat up and
[43:04] tossed around
[43:04] amen we are here for a cycle of
[43:06] redemption we are here for a cycle of
[43:08] reconciliation we are here to bring
[43:10] about
[43:11] the harmony that was lost in heaven
[43:17] says sin did not originate earth that
[43:19] originated in heaven
[43:20] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[43:22] cast out of heaven to the earth
[43:24] and fell on human beings see that's why
[43:29] oh praise god my microphone's not
[43:31] working
[43:32] and i don't care if i have to i'll grab
[43:35] a handheld
[43:37] anyways that's why friends
[43:41] because the battle went from heaven down
[43:44] to earth
[43:45] and we're now fighting the battle
[43:48] the reason we're fighting the battle and
[43:50] overcoming is because we fought the
[43:52] battle before
[43:54] the battle the battle came from heaven
[43:58] to earth
[43:59] so the soldiers came from heaven to
[44:02] earth
[44:03] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[44:06] the army that was fighting
[44:08] the battle because the arm the armies
[44:10] were first facing off in heaven
[44:11] when the battle moved from heaven to
[44:13] earth the armies must also go from
[44:15] heaven to earth
[44:20] and it was thrown down from heaven cast
[44:22] out of heaven to the earth
[44:23] and fell on human beings then the battle
[44:26] from angels became human battles
[44:28] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[44:31] which what god had created to be for
[44:33] himself
[44:34] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[44:36] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[44:39] then the battle began here on earth and
[44:41] began in us and has been raging
[44:43] ever since now on the fourth seal
[44:46] brother branham says in paragraph 280
[44:48] god had his children all fortified up by
[44:50] his word and he stuck her neck out
[44:52] and said i believe it's right maybe and
[44:54] there it went and it's been ever since
[44:56] then god come down and now he's got to
[44:59] he come down
[45:00] to redeem those that would come down
[45:04] have you kissed that from the four seal
[45:06] god come down
[45:07] to redeem those that would come down
[45:15] that's what he showed them back when
[45:17] they the sons of god were shouting for
[45:19] joy
[45:19] he showed him the plan of salvation he
[45:21] come down to redeem them that would come
[45:24] down
[45:24] god was showing them he was having a
[45:26] conference with his attributes
[45:29] we could just turn it this way he was
[45:30] having a conference with his attributes
[45:32] and he was going to show them what they
[45:33] would do
[45:34] and he was showing i'll lead the way i'm
[45:36] going to come down to redeem them that
[45:38] would come down
[45:39] amen and i believe those attributes were
[45:41] saying we'll go down
[45:44] we'll go down because there's something
[45:46] that has to happen
[45:47] there's something in god's economy that
[45:49] has to take place to fulfill god's
[45:51] purpose
[45:52] and all of his attributes will work for
[45:54] the same purpose because it's all him
[45:56] it's him it's not me and you and you and
[45:59] me and this and that one
[46:01] it is all him it is all one god all of
[46:04] his attributes collectively is just god
[46:08] the family of god is god the attributes
[46:10] of god are god the germ of god is god
[46:14] the spirit of god is god the word of god
[46:16] is god
[46:18] and we are that word we're a portion of
[46:20] that word we're one of those thoughts
[46:22] we're one of those attributes we are
[46:24] part of that germ so they're all working
[46:29] for the same purpose
[46:30] and it has always been working for the
[46:32] same purpose
[46:33] in whatever form and whatever
[46:35] manifestation and whatever
[46:37] display that that that the word of god
[46:39] has been in
[46:40] it has all been working for the same
[46:42] purpose and that's why brother benham
[46:43] said when christ was here amen when he
[46:46] went to the cross
[46:47] i paid for my sins there
[46:49] [Applause]
[46:51] because that was the word made flesh and
[46:53] i'm part of the word
[46:55] and if all the word was there made flesh
[46:57] i'm there
[46:58] [Applause]
[47:00] amen i hope we can see that that's why
[47:02] he said
[47:03] when they crossed the red sea i was
[47:04] there why that was the word when the
[47:07] word was in action amen i was
[47:09] represented there
[47:11] because i'm part of the word when god
[47:14] said let there be
[47:15] i was there
[47:19] i don't know in what form i don't know
[47:21] what it would have looked like
[47:23] i don't know what you would have touched
[47:24] or see i can't answer that question but
[47:26] when he said let there be i was there
[47:33] let that tangle the human mind and not
[47:35] and i say who cares
[47:38] i don't care if we can't explain it i
[47:40] don't care if we sound like a
[47:41] kindergartner trying to make it make
[47:43] sense
[47:43] amen i know i know that i come from god
[47:46] i know that i'm a part of god
[47:48] i know that germ of life amen that was
[47:50] to be me from the beginning
[47:52] was part of god however he choose to
[47:56] express it
[47:56] in whatever expression and if that
[47:58] expression changes in different parts
[48:00] amen of the redemption cycle
[48:02] that's fine with me even if i can't
[48:04] comprehend it or understand
[48:06] it amen i am part of it and forever will
[48:08] be a part of it i was a part of it in
[48:10] the beginning in the conference when he
[48:11] had a conference with his own thoughts
[48:13] and he began to show them the plan of
[48:15] redemption and he began to tell him that
[48:16] i will come down
[48:18] to redeem those that will come down
[48:20] [Music]
[48:24] what else would you say if you were
[48:26] there
[48:28] i'd ask you what else would you say
[48:31] if he showed you the plan of redemption
[48:34] and you know that plan of redemption see
[48:36] the plan of redemption
[48:39] was to accomplish something
[48:42] for god to display god to show off his
[48:46] attributes
[48:47] to purge unbelief it was all
[48:50] there to accomplish something and when
[48:52] god showed you his great plan of
[48:54] salvation
[48:55] in the conference with his attributes
[48:59] and he said i will come down
[49:03] to redeem those that will come down
[49:06] if you were standing there with the same
[49:09] revelation you have in your heart now
[49:11] with the same portion of god
[49:13] what would you say i'd say i'll go down
[49:17] i'll go down i volunteer
[49:21] amen what was this conference about i oh
[49:24] praise god i don't know what it's about
[49:26] but i know the end result and the end
[49:28] result is i'm here now
[49:31] taking my portion amen living out my
[49:33] portion for whatever god wants amen this
[49:36] is the degree this is the portion this
[49:37] is the way
[49:38] he saw fit for this portion of himself
[49:40] to manifest himself
[49:44] and i don't know what i said then but if
[49:46] it's any reflection of what i say now i
[49:48] say i'll go down
[49:54] praise god let's turn to ezekiel 28.
[50:14] like i say as we get into this there's
[50:16] so many things
[50:17] that are beyond a human mind so many
[50:21] questions so many things because
[50:25] for the for you for us humans in our
[50:27] human experience
[50:29] we have always we have always known
[50:31] everything by
[50:32] uh time space and matter
[50:36] so for us to think outside of that is so
[50:38] complicated for us
[50:40] everything we refer to everything we
[50:43] talk about
[50:44] has a place and a time and a substance
[50:49] like i'm coming to your house after
[50:51] church that is a time of place and a
[50:52] substance
[50:54] i'm going to the store to pick up this i
[50:56] work there my name is this
[50:58] i have this many children i live in this
[51:00] home i go to church
[51:01] everything we refer to friends
[51:05] has a time place and substance but
[51:08] god is not bound by that he created time
[51:11] space and substance and he's not bound
[51:13] by that he transcends
[51:15] all of that and then he can be here
[51:16] there and everywhere
[51:18] how by his infinite knowledge he
[51:22] transcends all of those things that bind
[51:24] us and bind our thinking
[51:26] so things that are impossible to us are
[51:27] not impossible to god
[51:30] that's why god god is only a
[51:33] miracle-working god
[51:35] by our perspective
[51:38] because for god it's not a miracle it's
[51:41] not hard it's not complicated
[51:43] it's not difficult to open a red sea
[51:45] it's not difficult to change somebody's
[51:47] life
[51:47] it's not difficult to take away an
[51:49] addiction or or to change a heart or
[51:51] bring two people together or
[51:52] heal a sickness that's not difficult for
[51:54] god that's impossible for us
[51:57] and so when it's impossible for us we
[51:59] say when it's done it was a miracle it
[52:01] was supernatural
[52:02] it was supernatural but we say it was a
[52:04] miracle and to god it's not a miracle
[52:06] [Music]
[52:12] praise be to god friend we see how
[52:14] limited we are
[52:15] in our small thinking as human beings
[52:17] and we've got to let the revelation that
[52:19] is in our souls say
[52:20] that's the truth that's the truth that's
[52:22] the truth how does it work i don't care
[52:24] how it works it works it's working in me
[52:28] whatever that conference was that we had
[52:30] in his thinking before the foundation of
[52:32] the world
[52:32] it's still holding me to my purpose
[52:38] ezekiel 28 and 11.
[52:46] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[52:48] me saying
[52:49] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[52:51] the king of tyrus
[52:53] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[52:55] thou see list up to some full of wisdom
[52:57] and perfect in beauty
[52:59] ezekiel now is writing a prophecy uh uh
[53:02] against the king of tyrus but the king
[53:04] of tyrus is being
[53:05] influenced by a demon spirit and power
[53:08] and the
[53:08] the god is not going to speak to the
[53:10] king of tyrus he's speaking to the
[53:12] spirit within
[53:15] and we know that this is lucifer
[53:19] he says verse 13 thou has been in eden
[53:22] the garden of god
[53:24] every precious stone was thy covering
[53:25] this artist the topaz the diamond the
[53:28] burl the onyx the jasper the sapphire
[53:30] the emerald the carbuncle the gold
[53:33] the workmanship of thy taberton of thy
[53:34] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[53:36] that thou was created
[53:38] thou art the anointed cherub that
[53:40] covereth and i have set thee so
[53:42] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[53:44] god thou was walked up and down in the
[53:46] midst of the stones of fire
[53:47] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[53:49] day that thou was created
[53:50] till iniquity was found in thee by the
[53:54] multitude i merchandise they have filled
[53:56] the midst of thee with violence and thou
[53:58] has sinned therefore i will cast thee as
[54:00] profane out of the mountain of god
[54:01] and i will destroy thee o covering
[54:03] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[54:05] fire
[54:06] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[54:08] beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[54:10] reason of thy brightness
[54:12] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[54:13] lay thee before kings that they may
[54:15] behold thee
[54:16] that was defiled the sanctuaries by the
[54:18] multitude of thine iniquities
[54:20] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[54:22] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[54:24] of thee
[54:25] it shall devour thee and i will bring
[54:26] thee to ashes upon the earth
[54:28] and the sight of all them that behold
[54:31] thee
[54:32] so we find out here
[54:36] that lucifer
[54:41] in heaven committed the first sin
[54:47] he by reason of his own brightness he
[54:50] deceived himself into thinking he could
[54:51] have a greater kingdom than michael's
[54:53] humble little kingdom
[54:54] and he began to create a deception in
[54:56] heaven and in the deception he would
[54:58] gather
[54:59] uh some of the angels that were caught
[55:01] up in his deception
[55:03] and he would he it says he thou has
[55:06] defiled
[55:07] thy sanctuaries
[55:11] he says he was told thou art the
[55:13] covering cherub
[55:14] that covereth and i have said thee so
[55:17] the covering chair
[55:18] that covers was one of the covering
[55:19] terms that covered over the mercy seat
[55:21] over the throne of god
[55:22] and the very holy of holies so in the
[55:26] holy of holies the holy place of all
[55:29] there was corruption set in and sin
[55:32] began
[55:34] and he says thou has defiled thy
[55:36] sanctuaries
[55:37] and sanctuaries means holy temple or
[55:40] holy place
[55:44] see in our human thinking we
[55:48] think heaven can't be polluted
[55:52] heaven can't be defiled heaven has to be
[55:56] perfect
[55:58] but that's not what the scripture says
[56:02] and i can show you i'm gonna we're gonna
[56:03] read some more scripts i'm gonna show
[56:04] you
[56:06] that heaven had a need
[56:12] stay with me it sounds odd chad what do
[56:15] you mean
[56:15] everybody wants to go to heaven but
[56:18] there was a reason we were willing to
[56:20] leave heaven
[56:22] if everybody wants to go to heaven why
[56:24] were we willing to leave heaven
[56:28] why did god have a conference why did
[56:30] god say i'll come down and redeem those
[56:31] that will come down
[56:32] what was the purpose of coming down
[56:36] why come down if heaven was perfect
[56:40] why leave
[56:44] i think the scriptures let's go to
[56:45] hebrews chapter 9.
[56:49] just look at the scriptures with me
[56:51] carefully
[56:55] hebrews chapter 9 verse 21
[56:58] brother bannon said sin didn't start on
[57:00] earth sin started in heaven
[57:03] if sin started in heaven then wow
[57:07] that's interesting
[57:13] hebrews chapter 9 verse 21
[57:16] now in hebrews he's starting to type the
[57:20] apostle paul is typing
[57:21] the old testament tabernacle and showing
[57:23] that it was a shadow
[57:24] it was a reflection it was made off the
[57:26] pattern that moses saw in heaven
[57:28] and moses was told to instruct the
[57:30] tabernacle in the wilderness off the one
[57:31] that he saw in heaven
[57:32] so it means that there's a tabernacle in
[57:34] heaven that means there's a holy place
[57:36] in heaven there's a throne of god in
[57:37] heaven
[57:38] and so now he's replicating that but
[57:40] when we come down here to verse 21
[57:43] it says moreover he's sprinkled with
[57:46] blood both the tabernacle and all the
[57:48] vessels of the ministry
[57:50] and almost all things that are by the
[57:52] law purge with blood and without
[57:53] shedding
[57:54] of blood is no remission so he's showing
[57:57] us
[57:57] that when when moses when he would
[58:00] commission the tabernacle
[58:02] and he would uh commission all the
[58:04] vessels in the tabernacle
[58:05] he would take blood and he would mix it
[58:07] with water and hyssop
[58:08] and the ashes of a red heifer and he
[58:10] would take the hyssop and he would
[58:11] sprinkle the tabernacle
[58:13] and he would sprinkle the vessels and
[58:16] there was a reason that he did that
[58:17] and let's keep reading it was therefore
[58:21] necessary
[58:22] that the pattern of things in heaven
[58:24] should be purified with these
[58:27] so what was the pattern of the things in
[58:28] heaven the tabernacle in the wilderness
[58:30] that moses made was the pattern of the
[58:32] things in heaven
[58:33] and it was necessary that the pattern
[58:35] was sprinkled with the blood
[58:38] for purification but listen what it says
[58:41] it was necessary that the pattern of
[58:43] these things in the heavens should be
[58:44] purified with these
[58:45] but the heavenly things themselves with
[58:48] better sacrifice than these
[58:51] for christ is not entered into the holy
[58:53] place made with hands which are the
[58:54] figures of the true but into heaven
[58:56] itself
[58:57] now to appear in the presence of god for
[58:59] us
[59:00] nor yet that he should offer himself
[59:02] often as the high priest
[59:04] and earth into the holy place every year
[59:05] with blood of others
[59:07] for then must he often have suffered
[59:09] since the foundation of the world
[59:10] but now once in the end time of the
[59:11] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[59:13] by the sacrifice
[59:15] of himself the scripture's saying
[59:18] if the pattern of the heavenly had to be
[59:22] purged by blood then the heavenlies had
[59:26] to be purged by
[59:27] better than those it couldn't be the
[59:29] blood of bulls and ghosts it could only
[59:31] be the blood of the high priest
[59:35] and jesus christ the high priest he shed
[59:37] his own blood and took his own blood
[59:39] behind the veil amen to do what the only
[59:42] reason was to show
[59:44] what moses was typing out and patterning
[59:46] out on earth was showing that there must
[59:48] be a
[59:49] purging of the tabernacle and of the
[59:51] vessels
[59:52] because if the ones on earth the pattern
[59:54] of the heavenlies must be purged with
[59:55] these
[59:56] then the heavenly must be purged by
[59:58] better than these
[59:59] which means the heavenly must be purged
[1:00:05] did you catch that the heavenlies must
[1:00:08] be
[1:00:08] purged why must the heavenly sanctuary
[1:00:12] be purged
[1:00:13] because sin defiled it
[1:00:19] this is interesting because we all our
[1:00:22] lives we grew up thinking
[1:00:24] heaven's perfect heaven's perfect
[1:00:26] heaven's perfect
[1:00:27] but there was something that god had to
[1:00:29] do he was reconciling he was restoring
[1:00:31] he was correcting something amen when he
[1:00:33] come to earth
[1:00:34] amen he shed his blood but he
[1:00:36] resurrected he wouldn't let the women
[1:00:38] touch him he said touch me not for i've
[1:00:39] not yet went and sent it to my father
[1:00:41] he had to take the fresh blood before it
[1:00:43] was touched
[1:00:44] before the sacrifice was touched by
[1:00:46] polluted men and had to present it
[1:00:48] into the throne room of god then he
[1:00:50] could come back that night what brother
[1:00:51] branham said that night
[1:00:53] and he could ask thomas come and touch
[1:00:54] me
[1:00:57] why because if the pattern of the
[1:00:59] heavenly must be purged
[1:01:02] then the heavenly must be purged with
[1:01:04] better than these
[1:01:06] ashes of a red heifer blood of bulls and
[1:01:09] goats
[1:01:10] that wouldn't cut it meaning
[1:01:13] there was a purging that needed to take
[1:01:15] place
[1:01:18] now i hope that you can catch this
[1:01:22] and i don't fully understand it so don't
[1:01:25] i'm just going to say it
[1:01:29] in order to purge the heavenlies
[1:01:32] sin started in heaven lucifer defiled
[1:01:36] the holy place we understand that
[1:01:39] the pattern showed a purging because the
[1:01:42] heavenlies needed a purging
[1:01:43] but couldn't use the same sacrifices had
[1:01:46] to have the blood of the high priest
[1:01:49] that means the only way to purge heaven
[1:01:54] was for god to create his own lamb
[1:01:57] the cycle of reconciliation went from
[1:02:00] heaven
[1:02:02] to earth back to heaven
[1:02:08] do you understand why did it have to be
[1:02:10] that way
[1:02:11] i don't know but it has to be that way
[1:02:14] how do you know it has to be that way
[1:02:15] because that's the way god did it
[1:02:17] and if that's the way god did it it has
[1:02:18] to be that way
[1:02:20] then there was no other way so the cycle
[1:02:22] of reconciliation
[1:02:24] amen would go with god said i would come
[1:02:27] down to redeem those that would come
[1:02:28] down
[1:02:29] but the coming down wasn't just
[1:02:32] wasn't just taking place on earth
[1:02:36] but he would come down and shed blood
[1:02:38] upon the earth to redeem the earth
[1:02:40] right his blood spit on the earth to
[1:02:42] redeem the earth he paid the price of
[1:02:44] sin
[1:02:44] upon the earth to redeem back what was
[1:02:46] lost in eden but it
[1:02:48] also did something else not just fix
[1:02:50] what went wrong in eden
[1:02:51] not just purge to falling away in eden
[1:02:53] amen not just purge the earth but it
[1:02:55] also went up to heaven to purge the
[1:02:57] sanctuary in heaven
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:00] so the cycle is from heaven to earth
[1:03:04] back to heaven you caught that cycle
[1:03:09] now let's go to another scripture
[1:03:13] let's go to colossians
[1:03:19] i hope you're catching what i'm saying
[1:03:22] and catching my meaning
[1:03:26] because this is this is amazing to me it
[1:03:30] is anyways
[1:03:31] colossians chapter 1.
[1:03:40] colossians chapter 1. i'm just going to
[1:03:42] read a portion but we'll read more of it
[1:03:43] in just a minute
[1:03:44] colossians chapter 1 verse 20
[1:03:48] and having made peace through the blood
[1:03:50] of his cross by him to reconcile
[1:03:52] all things unto himself by him i say
[1:03:55] whether they be things in
[1:03:56] earth are things in heaven
[1:04:04] we knew that earth needed reconciled
[1:04:08] but he wasn't just reconciling earth
[1:04:13] he was reconciling heaven
[1:04:16] at the same time let's read and having
[1:04:20] made peace through the blood of his
[1:04:21] cross by him to reconcile all things
[1:04:22] unto himself by him i say whether they
[1:04:24] be things in earth
[1:04:25] or things in heaven and you that were
[1:04:27] sometimes alienated in enemies in your
[1:04:29] mind by wicked works
[1:04:30] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[1:04:33] of his flesh
[1:04:34] you see there your bible will break that
[1:04:36] into two different verses
[1:04:38] but there is no punctuation between the
[1:04:40] word reconciled
[1:04:41] and in the body of his own flesh the eye
[1:04:43] should not be capitalized
[1:04:46] that is one sentence where were you
[1:04:49] reconciled
[1:04:50] in the body of his flesh that's why when
[1:04:52] brother benham said when he was on the
[1:04:54] cross i was there
[1:04:55] that's exactly what colossians says
[1:04:59] but somebody who wrote a bible and
[1:05:00] divided in the verses separated that
[1:05:02] making it look like two sentences it's
[1:05:04] not two sentences it's one sentence
[1:05:10] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[1:05:12] of his flesh through death to present
[1:05:13] you holy
[1:05:14] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:05:17] sight
[1:05:19] now i want you to catch this we're going
[1:05:21] to read this you stay in the bible there
[1:05:22] and follow along because brother ben is
[1:05:24] going to read this
[1:05:25] and when he comes to christ is the
[1:05:26] mystery of god revealed right in the
[1:05:28] beginning
[1:05:29] he takes this for uh an opening
[1:05:31] scripture for his context
[1:05:32] and you know and he starts from verse
[1:05:34] 15. so you can follow along
[1:05:36] he said who is the image of the
[1:05:37] invisible god the firstborn of every
[1:05:39] creature
[1:05:40] for by him were all things created that
[1:05:42] are in heaven and that are in earth
[1:05:44] visible
[1:05:45] invisible whether they be thrones
[1:05:46] dominions principalities powers
[1:05:48] all things were created by him and for
[1:05:50] him and he's before all things and by
[1:05:52] him all things consist
[1:05:54] and he is the head of the body the
[1:05:55] church who is the beginning the
[1:05:57] firstborn from the dead
[1:05:58] that all things he might have the
[1:06:00] preeminences
[1:06:02] for it please the father that in him
[1:06:03] should be all fullness dwelt should all
[1:06:05] fullness dwell
[1:06:07] he said let me put a little emphasis on
[1:06:10] that again
[1:06:10] this 19th verse i'm reading it right out
[1:06:12] of the message
[1:06:14] for it please the father then in him
[1:06:16] should all fullness dwell
[1:06:17] and having made peace through the blood
[1:06:18] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[1:06:21] things unto himself by him i say
[1:06:23] whether they be things in earth or
[1:06:24] things in heaven and brother benham
[1:06:26] stops reading the bible and he says
[1:06:28] watch where that reconciliation went
[1:06:33] he's trying to draw attention to the
[1:06:34] fact that when jesus christ was here in
[1:06:36] flesh
[1:06:37] amen when he was the sacrifice of god
[1:06:39] when he was god made flesh
[1:06:41] he wasn't just reconciling earth he was
[1:06:44] reconciling heaven
[1:06:48] and then he goes on to read and you that
[1:06:49] were sometimes alienated and he's been
[1:06:51] your mind by wicked works
[1:06:53] you now has he reconciled
[1:06:57] he goes on to read all the way down to
[1:06:59] the end of the chapter
[1:07:01] he says now for a text i want to take
[1:07:03] out of there this for a text
[1:07:04] basing it upon the entire bible but i
[1:07:07] want us to
[1:07:08] thus title this christ is the mystery of
[1:07:11] god
[1:07:12] revealed christ being the mystery of god
[1:07:14] revealed
[1:07:16] not then he says he took it in a sunday
[1:07:18] school class
[1:07:19] now he's saying now in the body of his
[1:07:23] flesh
[1:07:24] he reconciled all things and brother bam
[1:07:26] tells us i was in the body of his flesh
[1:07:29] because the word was made flesh and
[1:07:31] that's what colossians tells us
[1:07:34] so brother branham isn't making
[1:07:35] something up he's reading it right out
[1:07:36] of colossians
[1:07:38] then he gets to this place where he
[1:07:40] reconciled all things both things that
[1:07:42] are on earth
[1:07:43] and things that are in heaven brother
[1:07:45] branham doesn't want us to miss it he
[1:07:47] says
[1:07:47] see look where that reconciliation went
[1:07:51] so if more than anything i want us to
[1:07:52] catch the pattern
[1:07:54] from heaven to earth
[1:07:58] back to heaven is necessary for
[1:08:02] reconciliation
[1:08:04] because what's the pattern of your life
[1:08:08] from heaven to earth to back to heaven
[1:08:12] and i want to ask you why
[1:08:16] and i say for the same purpose for
[1:08:18] reconciliation
[1:08:21] let's go to second corinthians chapter
[1:08:23] 5.
[1:08:29] ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 17.
[1:08:41] second corinthians 5 and 17
[1:08:44] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:08:47] a new creature old things are passed
[1:08:49] away behold all things become new
[1:08:51] and all things are of god who hath
[1:08:53] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:08:56] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:08:58] reconciliation
[1:09:00] so where is the ministry of
[1:09:02] reconciliation now
[1:09:03] we were reconciled in his body and now
[1:09:06] the ministry of reconciliation is in his
[1:09:08] body
[1:09:12] don't separate things out don't do
[1:09:15] time-space matter to this truth amen
[1:09:19] we were in him he was the word made
[1:09:21] flesh amen
[1:09:22] the word is made flesh now in his body
[1:09:24] the body of the bride
[1:09:26] which is the body of christ in the body
[1:09:29] of jesus christ he was reconciling all
[1:09:31] things both heaven and earth
[1:09:32] and now in his body is the ministry of
[1:09:35] reconciliation
[1:09:39] praise god i love the bible
[1:09:42] let's read it again therefore if any
[1:09:44] banned me of christ he's a new creature
[1:09:46] old things are passed away behold all
[1:09:47] things become new and all things are of
[1:09:49] god
[1:09:50] who has reconciled us to himself by
[1:09:53] jesus christ and have given to us the
[1:09:54] ministry of reconciliation to wit
[1:09:56] that god was in christ reconciling the
[1:09:58] world and to himself
[1:10:00] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:10:02] and hath committed unto us
[1:10:03] the word of reconciliation now then we
[1:10:06] are
[1:10:07] ambassadors for christ we're ambassadors
[1:10:10] we're christ representatives
[1:10:12] we're ambassadors of christ as though
[1:10:13] god to beseech you by us
[1:10:15] so we're we're christ's ambassadors and
[1:10:17] god is speaking to you by
[1:10:19] us that's the reason god is beseeching
[1:10:22] you by us
[1:10:23] god is talking to you by the ambassadors
[1:10:27] god did beseech you by us and we pray
[1:10:30] you in christ's dead
[1:10:31] now he says now oh catch this friends
[1:10:34] catch it catch it catch it
[1:10:35] he says now you are christ ambassadors
[1:10:38] and god did beseech you by us god is
[1:10:40] speaking to you by us
[1:10:42] and we speak to you in christ said we
[1:10:45] are here instead of christ
[1:10:48] in christ's place that'd be a better way
[1:10:50] to say we are here in christ's place
[1:10:53] we are here in christ's dead
[1:10:57] and we pray you and christ said be ye
[1:10:59] reconciled
[1:11:00] to god what are they saying we're here
[1:11:04] in the place of christ telling you be
[1:11:07] reconciled to god
[1:11:08] we have the word of reconciliation we
[1:11:10] have the ministry of reconciliation
[1:11:12] we all the attributes were reconciled in
[1:11:15] the body of jesus christ
[1:11:16] but now jesus christ is in his body
[1:11:22] and in his body is the ministry of
[1:11:23] reconciliation
[1:11:25] that's why the bride has the word of
[1:11:27] reconciliation
[1:11:28] she has the word by the revelation that
[1:11:30] will will
[1:11:32] reconcile all the attributes of god back
[1:11:35] together
[1:11:37] and there's nothing else that will bring
[1:11:38] them back together friends
[1:11:40] amen they had to be there before amen
[1:11:42] they had to be in that conference
[1:11:46] but the only way that they're going to
[1:11:47] know that they were in the conference is
[1:11:49] that they start to hear some of the same
[1:11:51] things they heard
[1:11:52] there a denominational doctrine won't
[1:11:55] touch it a watered-down gospel won't
[1:11:58] touch it amen
[1:11:59] they've got to hear the same thing that
[1:12:01] they heard in the conference
[1:12:03] and when they hear the same thing they
[1:12:04] heard in the conference they will be
[1:12:06] reconciled back to god
[1:12:08] amen because this is the ministry of
[1:12:10] reconciliation
[1:12:12] it is the word of reconciliation and we
[1:12:15] beseech you amen god is beseeching you
[1:12:17] by us
[1:12:18] we're here in christ's place saying be
[1:12:20] reconciled back to god
[1:12:22] how because the word will reconcile you
[1:12:25] the word will come to the word
[1:12:27] the word will quicken the word the word
[1:12:29] will find the word
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:33] why do you think we had a conference
[1:12:35] before
[1:12:38] so we would be listening for a certain
[1:12:40] sound
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:42] now listen when i say that i'm not
[1:12:43] talking about your ears or your brain
[1:12:47] i'm talking about that seed gene of life
[1:12:48] down on the inside
[1:12:50] it has ears it has a memory
[1:12:57] that seeding of god that germ of life it
[1:13:00] has memory
[1:13:04] it remembers what i heard and that's why
[1:13:07] i trump it if a trumpet doesn't give a
[1:13:08] certain sound who will come to war
[1:13:10] amen that i don't recognize that sound
[1:13:12] but all of a sudden when the trumpet
[1:13:14] blasts a certain sound
[1:13:15] amen there's a recognition in the seats
[1:13:17] i've heard that before
[1:13:19] that's a call to battle i heard that
[1:13:21] because i battled before
[1:13:23] amen i heard the trumpet sound before
[1:13:26] and i resisted the devil's lie before
[1:13:28] and i'm hearing that same trumpet sound
[1:13:30] again
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:34] praise be to god amen yes sir
[1:13:38] brother baby said in the bergamian
[1:13:40] church age
[1:13:41] in the church age books that those in
[1:13:42] the bride do only his will no one can
[1:13:44] make them do otherwise
[1:13:46] they have thus saith the lord they keep
[1:13:47] still they know that it has to be god in
[1:13:49] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:13:51] word
[1:13:52] he did not complete all his work while
[1:13:54] in his earthly ministry
[1:13:58] what was his work to reconcile heaven
[1:14:01] and earth
[1:14:02] to fix the problem on earth and fix the
[1:14:05] problem in heaven
[1:14:08] oh i hope you understand that i hope
[1:14:10] it's coming in
[1:14:11] this is bigger than you amen this is
[1:14:13] bigger than your earthly life
[1:14:15] this is bigger than your 70 80 90 years
[1:14:17] this is bigger than your job and your
[1:14:19] heartbreak and your upsets and your
[1:14:21] and your blessings this is something the
[1:14:23] plan of god from before the foundation
[1:14:25] of the world and he has designated
[1:14:27] attributes to take their place in this
[1:14:28] plan
[1:14:29] and this is a plan of reconciliation
[1:14:31] amen he is
[1:14:32] fixing everything that went wrong
[1:14:35] amen all the way back from luther's
[1:14:39] lucifer's rebellion in heaven he is also
[1:14:42] fixing that
[1:14:47] and we are part of that reconciliation
[1:14:50] that ministry of reconciliation
[1:14:55] i was there when he was reconciling it
[1:14:58] in the body of his flesh
[1:15:00] and i'm here now when he's here and me
[1:15:03] with the ministry of reconciliation
[1:15:10] praise god
[1:15:13] let's keep reading he did not complete
[1:15:15] all his work while in his earthly
[1:15:16] ministry so now he works in and through
[1:15:18] the bride
[1:15:20] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:15:21] for him to do certain things
[1:15:23] that he must now do but he will now
[1:15:26] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:15:28] which he left for this specific
[1:15:30] time
[1:15:34] i wonder if we heard that in the
[1:15:36] conference
[1:15:40] the message proving his word
[1:15:44] he says so he god come down after going
[1:15:47] through this and now every son
[1:15:50] that you eat and born of natural sex
[1:15:52] birth the way you come
[1:15:54] then when it comes to a place to where
[1:15:56] you go through water baptism the holy
[1:15:57] ghost baptism
[1:15:58] then the holy ghost comes down at the
[1:16:00] first baptism and claims this creation
[1:16:02] the same as it did him
[1:16:05] that's what happened when the dove came
[1:16:06] down it claimed that portion of the
[1:16:08] earth
[1:16:09] that made up the body of jesus christ
[1:16:13] and now at the holy ghost baptism he's
[1:16:14] doing the same thing he's coming down
[1:16:16] and claiming this portion of the earth
[1:16:20] the holy ghost and god is to say well
[1:16:22] let me read that again the holy ghost
[1:16:23] baptism then the holy ghost comes down
[1:16:25] at the first baptism and claims this
[1:16:26] creation
[1:16:27] the same as it did him the holy ghost in
[1:16:30] god is the same spirit
[1:16:32] see it comes down and claims this body
[1:16:34] for the resurrection
[1:16:35] and he was raised for our justification
[1:16:37] all that the father has given me will
[1:16:39] come not one will be lost
[1:16:40] i'll raise it up at the last day not one
[1:16:43] hair of its head will even perish
[1:16:45] that is the beginning of the creation of
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:48] there at jordan
[1:16:51] this is the continuation of the creation
[1:16:55] of god that was the beginning
[1:16:59] this is the continuation god is claiming
[1:17:02] this portion of the earth to do what to
[1:17:05] finish his ministry
[1:17:10] what does god
[1:17:13] what does god care about more than
[1:17:17] reconciling
[1:17:18] reconciling what's fallen to fixing
[1:17:21] what's happened
[1:17:22] to displaying himself in the fullness of
[1:17:24] his attributes
[1:17:26] and to bring back what has fallen away
[1:17:29] that's the purpose that's the ministry
[1:17:32] that's why we're here
[1:17:38] colossians 1. let's go back to
[1:17:41] colossians 1.
[1:17:47] colossians 1 and verse 26
[1:17:56] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:17:58] ages and from generations
[1:18:00] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:18:03] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:18:05] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:18:07] among the gentiles
[1:18:08] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:18:13] i'd like to leave it the way it's
[1:18:15] phrased and not change it at all
[1:18:19] which is christ in you it doesn't say
[1:18:21] the hope of your glory
[1:18:24] because you've already been glorified
[1:18:31] let's just leave it the way it's written
[1:18:33] which is christ in you
[1:18:36] the hope of glory
[1:18:40] mean glory has a hope
[1:18:45] glory the heavenly was corrupted by sin
[1:18:49] was polluted there was war in heaven
[1:18:56] christ came to purge the sanctuaries he
[1:18:58] came as the high priest
[1:18:59] from heaven to earth to spill blood on
[1:19:02] earth
[1:19:02] and then to carry that blood beyond the
[1:19:05] veil
[1:19:05] into the heavenlies amen to purge the
[1:19:08] sanctuary
[1:19:12] and now he's given us the ministry of
[1:19:14] reconciliation and he continues his work
[1:19:16] in and through the bride and it is
[1:19:20] christ it's the same life it's the same
[1:19:23] christ it's not another christ it's not
[1:19:25] christ part two
[1:19:26] it's the same life the same christ the
[1:19:29] same power the same word
[1:19:30] the same spirit is now christ working in
[1:19:33] you
[1:19:34] the hope of glory
[1:19:37] all of heaven is depending on you and i
[1:19:42] they without us are not yet made perfect
[1:19:44] friends amen
[1:19:45] heaven is they're depending on you and i
[1:19:47] to run our race to finish our course
[1:19:49] to hold the word to have the ministry of
[1:19:51] reconciliation
[1:19:52] to call out to the last predestinated
[1:19:55] seed to come and be reconciled to god
[1:19:57] to come and drink of the water of life
[1:19:59] freely amen that's christ in you
[1:20:02] the hope of glory
[1:20:07] hallelujah
[1:20:12] brother rahm said in 1965 the god who is
[1:20:16] rich in mercy
[1:20:19] so now if you've got eternal life
[1:20:20] tonight if we have eternal life then we
[1:20:23] always were because there is only one
[1:20:25] form of eternal life
[1:20:26] we always were and the reason we were
[1:20:29] because we are part of god and god is
[1:20:31] the only
[1:20:32] thing that's eternal
[1:20:35] and like as melchizedek received tithes
[1:20:37] from abraham and it was allotted to his
[1:20:39] great-grandson levi
[1:20:40] who was yet in the loins of abraham pay
[1:20:42] tithes for he was yet in the loins of
[1:20:44] abraham when he met melchizedek
[1:20:46] i want to speak on that over at another
[1:20:48] place one morning who is this
[1:20:49] melchizedek now
[1:20:50] now notice that way back god knew this
[1:20:53] boy coming down he knowed all things
[1:20:56] god knew what brother said is god knew
[1:20:58] that levi the tribe of levi would be the
[1:21:00] priests
[1:21:02] so in order in order to allow levi to
[1:21:05] receive tithes
[1:21:07] he made abraham pay ties to melchizedek
[1:21:10] and so it could be accounted to levi who
[1:21:12] was in his loins
[1:21:15] and that's in the natural dissension
[1:21:18] from a natural man
[1:21:19] i'm telling you friends everything is
[1:21:21] linked
[1:21:22] we're linked to the age before amen
[1:21:24] we're linked we're linked to everything
[1:21:26] that's been done by the word and for the
[1:21:28] word on this earth
[1:21:29] we're linked to heaven we're linked to
[1:21:31] the things on earth we're linked
[1:21:33] now to all the word
[1:21:38] he says
[1:21:42] next next paragraph now we are part of
[1:21:44] god you always was
[1:21:46] you don't remember it because you were
[1:21:47] only an attribute in god
[1:21:49] you're only in his thinking your very
[1:21:51] name if it ever was on the book of life
[1:21:53] it was put there before the foundation
[1:21:54] of the world
[1:21:55] he knew what you were i'm only saying
[1:21:58] this not to mix up doctrine but to
[1:21:59] straighten it out
[1:22:00] that we might get away from this fear
[1:22:02] and scare you don't know
[1:22:03] who you are you are not going to be but
[1:22:06] now
[1:22:07] are you the sons of god
[1:22:10] and you always were the sons of god
[1:22:14] so when all the sons of god shouted for
[1:22:16] joy
[1:22:17] i was there because i'm now a son of god
[1:22:19] i've always been a son of god and if all
[1:22:21] the sons of god were there i was there
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:25] and i heard the conference i saw the
[1:22:27] plan of salvation
[1:22:28] i saw a god who would come down for
[1:22:31] those who would come down
[1:22:33] and i'm happy that i've come down
[1:22:36] to take my place
[1:22:42] amen for when god had you in his
[1:22:46] thinking at the beginning
[1:22:47] you have to be some part of you your
[1:22:49] life that's in you now
[1:22:50] had to be with god before there well
[1:22:53] when he before he even became material
[1:22:55] here on earth
[1:22:56] before there was anything but god you
[1:22:58] were one of his attributes
[1:23:00] he knowed what your name would be he
[1:23:02] know the color of hair you would have
[1:23:04] he knowed all about you the only thing
[1:23:06] happened is when you being a sinner
[1:23:08] many of you can fellowship with me on
[1:23:09] this thought when you was a little boy
[1:23:12] or a little girl
[1:23:12] you would walk around and there would be
[1:23:14] certain things that would just
[1:23:16] where it wouldn't bother the other kids
[1:23:17] it seemed like there was something in
[1:23:19] you that cried out
[1:23:20] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[1:23:22] sinner
[1:23:23] you remember that certainly now what was
[1:23:26] that
[1:23:27] that was that little form of life in you
[1:23:32] then
[1:23:34] it didn't that little form of life
[1:23:36] didn't come into you at the new birth
[1:23:39] it was already in you it was always in
[1:23:42] you
[1:23:42] it was always the portion of god that
[1:23:44] was predestinated to be you
[1:23:45] it was always the predestinated word
[1:23:47] thought of god the portion that was to
[1:23:49] be you
[1:23:50] amen it was always that and it was
[1:23:53] in you as part of your soul when you
[1:23:56] were born and became a living soul
[1:23:57] amen that part of eternal life was there
[1:24:02] and we say it you know it had to be
[1:24:04] quick and it was dormant it wasn't
[1:24:06] dead because brother bam says it was in
[1:24:08] you there and it was affecting you
[1:24:11] but it had to be quick and it had to be
[1:24:13] sparked to life
[1:24:14] what had to happen amen there had to be
[1:24:17] a chinese laundry ticket
[1:24:24] he had to tear
[1:24:28] he had to tear something from something
[1:24:32] but before he tore something from
[1:24:34] something it was one something
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:39] do you understand brother ben's parable
[1:24:41] of the laundry ticket
[1:24:43] you were always the son of god you were
[1:24:44] always part of god you were always in
[1:24:46] his thinking
[1:24:47] but at a certain time he had to take a
[1:24:50] portion
[1:24:51] from a portion now does this make this
[1:24:54] two different things
[1:24:59] oh hallelujah friends oh if we could see
[1:25:02] this
[1:25:03] we'll skip across the platform like that
[1:25:05] old brother did in his 90s amen
[1:25:07] because i was in the conference amen i
[1:25:09] come from god i go to god i belong to
[1:25:11] god i've always been a son of god
[1:25:13] amen i just didn't know it i was trapped
[1:25:15] in amnesia the devil had me under
[1:25:18] all kinds of confusion amen but
[1:25:20] something inside of me
[1:25:21] always belonged back here
[1:25:25] no matter how long it was separated no
[1:25:27] matter where it went
[1:25:28] it was carried in a vessel a man a dirty
[1:25:30] vessel of the earth fallen and doing
[1:25:32] dirty filthy things
[1:25:33] it didn't change the seed the seeds
[1:25:35] never been corrupted
[1:25:37] the seeds never been dirtied by all the
[1:25:39] dirty activity of the flesh and of the
[1:25:41] mind
[1:25:41] can't dirty the perfect seed all the
[1:25:44] filth that we got caught and all the
[1:25:46] confusion all the wrong thinking all the
[1:25:48] bad decisions
[1:25:49] it couldn't change this portion of god
[1:25:51] it can't dirty it can't corrupt it it
[1:25:54] can't pollute it
[1:25:59] oh praise god if that doesn't make you
[1:26:01] shout what will friends
[1:26:04] when you realize that that's me mama in
[1:26:07] the bible that's me
[1:26:08] i'm seeing me
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:11] god tore me from himself
[1:26:19] and he decided that this portion would
[1:26:20] come down and there being a soul
[1:26:24] that soul would be me and that soul
[1:26:28] would need to be purged
[1:26:31] but this wouldn't need to be purged
[1:26:35] the soul that it was in was part of
[1:26:37] would need to be purged
[1:26:38] so that this could come forth in life
[1:26:41] and take over
[1:26:43] so god would make sure that he would
[1:26:46] send another portion
[1:26:51] this was the word this was the holy
[1:26:54] spirit
[1:26:56] it's all the same thing it's
[1:26:59] the holy spirit coming to the holy
[1:27:02] spirit
[1:27:04] brother man said this holy spirit is
[1:27:06] nothing more than the seed of life this
[1:27:07] seed of god coming to life
[1:27:11] it's the holy ghost life in you and it's
[1:27:13] the holy ghost anointing coming through
[1:27:15] the holy ghost life in you and sparking
[1:27:16] it to holy ghost life
[1:27:18] it's god it's the life of god it's not i
[1:27:21] need a
[1:27:22] different portion of the life of god to
[1:27:24] waken up this portion of the life of god
[1:27:25] amen i was already part of the life of
[1:27:27] god amen this is part of the life of god
[1:27:30] when the life of god comes to the life
[1:27:31] of god
[1:27:32] in word and spirit and whatever term you
[1:27:35] give it
[1:27:36] when life comes to life it springs back
[1:27:39] to life and it says
[1:27:40] i know where i come from i know who i am
[1:27:43] but the amnesia is melting away and i'm
[1:27:46] realizing i was
[1:27:47] always part of god i was always with god
[1:27:50] what quickens this seed to life it's the
[1:27:52] baptism of the holy ghost so what is the
[1:27:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:56] it must be the other part of me
[1:28:02] you understand it was all one thing in
[1:28:05] the beginning
[1:28:07] the chinese laundrymen ticket he didn't
[1:28:09] give you two different tickets
[1:28:11] say i hope these go together he knew
[1:28:13] they would go together because they were
[1:28:15] one
[1:28:15] substance in the beginning and he took a
[1:28:18] portion off
[1:28:19] of this substance so that it would be an
[1:28:21] exact
[1:28:26] match and you were tore off
[1:28:29] the word for this day
[1:28:32] the bright age the manifestation of
[1:28:34] jesus christ in brideform
[1:28:36] that was the portion that was tore off
[1:28:38] of god that's the part of the word that
[1:28:39] is in you if you're a
[1:28:42] predestinated sea gene of god living in
[1:28:44] this day the part of god that's in you
[1:28:47] the part of the word that was broke
[1:28:48] off out of the book what is the book of
[1:28:52] life what are the believers the words in
[1:28:53] the book
[1:28:54] so one of those words had to come out of
[1:28:56] the book
[1:28:57] so he tore the word out of the book
[1:29:01] and he put it in you and what word is
[1:29:04] that
[1:29:05] it is the word it is the word
[1:29:08] for this day
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:12] and the only way that he can wake up
[1:29:15] that word and get into action is to
[1:29:17] bring the word for this day
[1:29:18] to the word for this day
[1:29:21] no other word would work no teaching
[1:29:23] from a previous age
[1:29:24] no other doctrine no other theory no
[1:29:27] other philosophy will work
[1:29:28] only the word for this day coming to the
[1:29:31] word for this day
[1:29:32] and when they match it comes back to
[1:29:35] itself
[1:29:37] the prodigal son has come to himself and
[1:29:39] he's run to his father and his father's
[1:29:41] wrapped his arms around him
[1:29:46] brother man was teaching us to take the
[1:29:47] scare away you don't know who you are
[1:29:52] i hope i have the baptism the holy ghost
[1:29:54] i hope that it's almost like
[1:29:56] i just hope that if i get a sensation or
[1:29:58] experience then i'll have enough
[1:29:59] confidence to believe that i'm a child
[1:30:00] of god
[1:30:02] the baptism of the holy ghost wasn't to
[1:30:04] give a sensation or
[1:30:06] or some feeling that you could put your
[1:30:08] uh put your stock in and put your hands
[1:30:10] around because
[1:30:11] every sensational experience every
[1:30:13] experience you have
[1:30:14] the devil will be able to make you
[1:30:15] question it but the badge of holy ghost
[1:30:18] wasn't to give you a sensation or a
[1:30:20] feeling that you could lock on to
[1:30:21] the baptism of the holy ghost came to
[1:30:23] wake up the seed
[1:30:25] the portion of god that was laying there
[1:30:26] waiting to go into manifestation
[1:30:28] that is the purpose of the baptism of
[1:30:30] the holy ghost
[1:30:32] and the evidence of the baptism of the
[1:30:34] holy ghost is that this seed word
[1:30:36] precedent predestination for this day
[1:30:37] comes to the word and says that's
[1:30:39] nothing but the truth and begins to live
[1:30:41] it and manifest it
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:44] not i had a feeling someday and i had
[1:30:47] something a dream and something this
[1:30:49] that may very well be how he came to you
[1:30:51] but it's
[1:30:52] it's it's christ coming to christ it's
[1:30:54] the holy ghost coming to the holy ghost
[1:30:56] it's spirit to spirit life to life
[1:30:58] word to word amen
[1:31:01] so he may come in a dream and a
[1:31:03] sensation that may be
[1:31:05] how he comes and that's wonderful but
[1:31:07] the thing that gives us the evidence
[1:31:09] that has taken place
[1:31:10] is that this life comes back to the word
[1:31:13] it was tore off
[1:31:14] and said that's the truth i received the
[1:31:16] word for my day
[1:31:17] i know it's right because i was in the
[1:31:19] conference
[1:31:21] somehow this is the second time i'm
[1:31:24] hearing this
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:27] somehow there's a familiarity in me
[1:31:30] that i've never heard it before i know
[1:31:32] intellectually i've never heard it
[1:31:33] before
[1:31:34] but something in me has heard this
[1:31:36] before
[1:31:38] where did i hear this where did i know
[1:31:40] that when
[1:31:41] i must have when i was a little boy i
[1:31:42] must have had a grandpa or something
[1:31:44] tell me the message
[1:31:48] how many has had that thought that i
[1:31:50] must have heard this somewhere
[1:31:53] because it's all so familiar
[1:31:57] because you're always you're
[1:32:00] always part of god and though it's tore
[1:32:04] off an inner soul
[1:32:07] waiting to be quickened it's still god
[1:32:14] it's still a son of god it's still a
[1:32:17] daughter of god
[1:32:18] it's still the word for this age
[1:32:22] it's just there waiting to be put back
[1:32:25] together
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:27] in what the marriage union
[1:32:31] the bridegroom and the bride coming back
[1:32:34] together
[1:32:36] now that we understand what brother
[1:32:37] brenda's been talking about the whole
[1:32:38] time
[1:32:40] not even talking about something else
[1:32:41] going on here and this experience and
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:43] he's talking about god putting himself
[1:32:46] back together
[1:32:48] god calling his attributes back to
[1:32:49] himself to manifest the portion for this
[1:32:51] hour
[1:32:52] and the ministry of reconciliation to
[1:32:54] fix and repair
[1:32:55] everything that's went wrong
[1:32:58] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:03] i'm going to read another quote out of
[1:33:05] the submergent church age
[1:33:08] out of the church age book now when
[1:33:11] there here we are coming to a conclusion
[1:33:14] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[1:33:16] the sun and in jesus what all the
[1:33:18] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:33:20] and that eternal one was the father
[1:33:22] manifest in flesh
[1:33:24] and thereby gain the title of son so we
[1:33:27] understand that
[1:33:28] and jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:33:30] godhead bodily god was manifest in the
[1:33:32] son
[1:33:33] that eternal one was the father
[1:33:34] manifested in flesh
[1:33:36] and thereby gain the title of son
[1:33:40] even so we he's making a comparison
[1:33:46] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[1:33:49] our turn
[1:33:52] became the many-membered spoken word
[1:33:54] seed
[1:33:55] manifest in flesh
[1:33:58] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:34:00] in flesh are
[1:34:01] the sons of god even as we are
[1:34:05] so called we did not become seed by the
[1:34:07] rebirth we were seed and therefore were
[1:34:10] reborn
[1:34:11] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:34:14] because because we were seed is the
[1:34:17] reason we could be quickened
[1:34:19] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[1:34:23] there must be this inside before this
[1:34:27] will have any effect
[1:34:30] understand the holy ghost can come
[1:34:34] the word can be preached with the with
[1:34:36] the spirit behind it and it can touch
[1:34:38] and touch
[1:34:38] and touch and touch nothing
[1:34:41] duck duck duck
[1:34:45] duck duck duck
[1:34:48] goose and that's why you get up and run
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:56] because you've come back to yourself
[1:34:58] again
[1:34:59] you've had an awakening on the inside
[1:35:02] you may not have fully comprehended it
[1:35:03] that day but you knew something well you
[1:35:05] knew this is real there's something to
[1:35:07] this
[1:35:07] this is the truth and i'm part of it and
[1:35:10] that begins to grow in you
[1:35:13] nazi there is nothing to quicken hold
[1:35:16] this carefully in mind
[1:35:17] now take the next step redeem means to
[1:35:19] buy back
[1:35:20] it restores to the original owner god by
[1:35:23] his death the shed blood
[1:35:24] bought back his own he bought back the
[1:35:27] spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my
[1:35:29] voice
[1:35:29] word and they follow me you always were
[1:35:32] a sheep you never were a pig or a dog
[1:35:35] turned into a sheep
[1:35:36] that is impossible for every kind of
[1:35:38] life produces the same kind and there is
[1:35:40] no
[1:35:40] change in specie

[1:35:45] wheat even though you were living a
[1:35:47] cockapoo life
[1:35:49] you may have been living a pig life but
[1:35:51] you never turned from a pig to a sheep
[1:35:52] you were a sheep acting like a pig
[1:35:55] you were a wheat acting like a cockle
[1:35:57] brewer but down inside the gene of life
[1:36:00] on the inside was wheat from the
[1:36:02] beginning
[1:36:03] and when it come to the right condition
[1:36:05] in the right season
[1:36:06] the right rain the right sun the right
[1:36:09] conditions

[1:36:12] what it always was on the inside
[1:36:16] it says now you you never changed in
[1:36:20] species
[1:36:21] as we were in the thoughts of god and
[1:36:22] then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:36:24] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:36:27] the word and in hearing that voice
[1:36:29] become aware of our father calling us
[1:36:33] why how did he call adam when he was
[1:36:35] lost by his voice
[1:36:38] he called him by name
[1:36:41] and in this day how does he reveal our
[1:36:43] names how does he call our names by
[1:36:44] revealing the mysteries
[1:36:46] and by revealing the mysteries he's
[1:36:48] calling our name what's he doing in this
[1:36:50] age with the with the full
[1:36:52] revelation of the full word given by the
[1:36:54] seventh angel what's he doing
[1:36:56] he is calling adam adam where are you
[1:37:01] he's here adam he's looking for this
[1:37:04] adam where are you and how's he calling
[1:37:07] he's saying serpent see that's what
[1:37:09] happened in the garden he said
[1:37:10] denominations is not of god amen it's
[1:37:13] the trail of the serpent
[1:37:14] he's saying cain was of the wicked one
[1:37:16] and water baptism is in jesus name and
[1:37:18] there's only one god not three what's he
[1:37:20] doing
[1:37:20] adam adam where are you he's saying
[1:37:23] you've been caught out of laodicea
[1:37:25] caught into a bright age
[1:37:26] this is the eagle time the eagle
[1:37:28] anointing to lift up the eagle it's
[1:37:29] above the things of this earth what's he
[1:37:31] doing
[1:37:31] adam adam where are you
[1:37:35] you're no longer a pentecostal you're no
[1:37:37] longer allowed to see it
[1:37:38] but i've called you up amen there's an
[1:37:40] open door in heaven
[1:37:42] come up higher what's he saying adam
[1:37:45] adam where are you
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:51] and eventually he connects and you say
[1:37:54] here i am
[1:37:56] save me here i am
[1:37:59] save me redeem me back
[1:38:03] make me yours help me to fulfill my
[1:38:05] purpose whatever
[1:38:06] whatever you showed me in that
[1:38:08] commission is what i want to do
[1:38:10] i may have gotten sidetracked i may be
[1:38:12] discouraged in my mind
[1:38:14] but in my heart i heard a voice i was
[1:38:16] part of a conference
[1:38:18] amen in that conference would take me
[1:38:19] from there to here
[1:38:21] back to there and a cycle of
[1:38:24] reconciliation
[1:38:27] because it's christ in you the hope of
[1:38:28] glory
[1:38:30] this ministry of reconciliation is not
[1:38:32] finished
[1:38:34] and it's been given to the bride
[1:38:41] so now he says there had to come a day
[1:38:44] when we would hear his voice
[1:38:45] the word and hearing that voice become
[1:38:48] aware of our father calling us
[1:38:51] and recognized that we are sons of god
[1:38:53] we heard his voice and we cried out as
[1:38:55] did the prodigal son
[1:38:56] save me o my father i'm returning to
[1:38:59] thee
[1:39:01] the prodigal son didn't go find a place
[1:39:04] to be saved
[1:39:06] the only salvation for the prodigal son
[1:39:08] was to go back
[1:39:10] to the father because that's where he
[1:39:13] come from
[1:39:16] the only place for us to go is back to
[1:39:18] the word
[1:39:19] amen back to the full revelation of the
[1:39:22] word because the word was with god and
[1:39:23] the word was god

[1:40:02] when the word is going forth it's the
[1:40:04] father calling to the lost sheep
[1:40:08] and the spirit and the bride say come
[1:40:10] and let him that heareth
[1:40:11] say come and let him that is a thirst
[1:40:13] come and whosoever will
[1:40:15] let him take the water of life
[1:40:18] freely this is the end time ministry
[1:40:23] this is the end time ministry for the
[1:40:24] gentiles it's in the bride and it's the
[1:40:27] ministry of reconciliation
[1:40:28] she has got to find that last part that
[1:40:32] last
[1:40:32] that last part that was in the
[1:40:34] conference

[1:40:38] god that was in that conference amen the
[1:40:40] bride is here
[1:40:41] with the word and the word is the father
[1:40:44] hunting out that last sheep that last
[1:40:46] seed
[1:40:47] and bringing it back to himself and and
[1:40:50] it's christ
[1:40:51] in you the hope of glory
[1:40:54] the work isn't finished he's finishing
[1:40:58] it now
[1:41:00] and i say god i'm here i'm here
[1:41:05] i may i may not have recollection of
[1:41:07] that conference and all the details and
[1:41:09] all the words but
[1:41:10] there's something down inside of me that
[1:41:13] knows that i was there
[1:41:16] i heard what was said and i agreed with
[1:41:19] it all
[1:41:21] he showed him the plan of redemption
[1:41:24] that plan of redemption included you
[1:41:26] being here now
[1:41:28] is that true so he must if he showed him
[1:41:32] his plan of redemption he must have
[1:41:33] showed you here now in this age
[1:41:37] and you shouted for joy if you shouted
[1:41:40] for joy
[1:41:41] i think you agreed that that's a good
[1:41:44] plan
[1:41:46] so don't start disagreeing now
[1:41:51] why am i here with so much trouble the
[1:41:54] world is falling apart
[1:41:55] the government's changing amen you
[1:41:57] already saw it friends and you said
[1:42:00] praise god hallelujah that's a good plan
[1:42:05] so if the world falls apart and
[1:42:06] everything runs in the chaos
[1:42:08] and they shut things down amen you
[1:42:10] already shouted when you saw it amen
[1:42:12] when you saw the trouble when you saw
[1:42:14] the persecution when you saw the
[1:42:16] pressure
[1:42:17] amen you saw it because you were looking
[1:42:18] at a plan of redemption
[1:42:20] and when the attributes saw the plan of
[1:42:21] redemption you said
[1:42:23] praise god that's a good plan
[1:42:28] so don't start complaining today just
[1:42:30] keep shouting
[1:42:31] it's a good plan amen it's a good plan
[1:42:34] and all these things has to be this way
[1:42:36] but god give me the voice to keep saying
[1:42:38] come and drink
[1:42:39] come and drink come to the water of life
[1:42:42] freely
[1:42:43] it's flowing clean it's flowing pure
[1:42:46] from the throne of god
[1:42:48] i say god help us to give a clear voice
[1:42:51] in this day
[1:42:53] because whatever was said at the
[1:42:54] conference has to be said now
[1:42:57] to attract that same gene
[1:43:00] let's all stand
[1:43:07] i pray that you've had this experience
[1:43:14] but if you haven't there's something
[1:43:17] stirring in your heart
[1:43:19] something's just pulsating saying that's
[1:43:22] true
[1:43:23] how could i be how could it be me i've
[1:43:25] done this and that
[1:43:26] don't worry about what you've done
[1:43:27] that's the flesh that's not the seed
[1:43:31] don't worry about your conduct your
[1:43:32] behavior your sin don't worry about the
[1:43:34] condition of your mind don't worry about
[1:43:35] the condition of your body
[1:43:37] don't worry about your addictions don't
[1:43:38] worry about your failures forget all of
[1:43:40] it
[1:43:42] but if something inside says it's true
[1:43:46] then say father save me i'm coming back
[1:43:48] to you
[1:43:50] because the only thing that will
[1:43:52] recognize that is true
[1:43:54] is a seed of god if that's you just say
[1:43:58] father open up your arms i'm coming back
[1:44:00] father come and save me i'm coming back
[1:44:02] lord because i know it's the truth i'm
[1:44:04] unworthy
[1:44:05] amen what did the prodigal son realize
[1:44:07] i'm incapable i'm unworthy i'm a waste
[1:44:09] of a life i've ruined everything
[1:44:13] so if you find yourself in that position
[1:44:15] just do what the prodigal dead run back
[1:44:17] to the father
[1:44:19] say father save me i belong with you
[1:44:22] you're my father i come from you i'm
[1:44:24] coming back to you
[1:44:25] save me god save me
[1:44:29] and let him put you back together
[1:44:33] the right way let's bow our heads and
[1:44:36] pray lord jesus
[1:44:38] god we thank you for your word lord for
[1:44:41] the revelation in this hour the things
[1:44:42] that you have taught us the things that
[1:44:44] you have shown us lord
[1:44:46] god prophets and mighty men and wise men
[1:44:49] have longed to see this day
[1:44:52] but god back in that conference you
[1:44:54] showed us the plan and we saw it
[1:44:57] and we said it was a good plan we
[1:45:00] shouted
[1:45:01] we rejoiced we sang we clapped our hands
[1:45:05] god i still say it's a good plan
[1:45:09] and god you've got seed out there lost
[1:45:12] sheep

[1:45:16] word goes out that you would prick their
[1:45:18] heart
[1:45:19] i pray god that they would begin to
[1:45:21] recognize
[1:45:23] i'm not who the world says i am i'm not
[1:45:26] what my actions say that i am
[1:45:29] but there's something deeper than my
[1:45:31] thinking something
[1:45:32] deeper than my anger or bitterness or
[1:45:35] addiction or
[1:45:36] whatever there's something deeper
[1:45:38] there's something real there's something
[1:45:39] at the core
[1:45:40] that says i belong to god i pray you'd
[1:45:44] prick their heart now that you would
[1:45:45] peel away
[1:45:46] the layers of dirt lord that has plugged
[1:45:48] up the fountain
[1:45:49] and i pray god that you'd pour the water
[1:45:51] of life in
[1:45:53] and bring forth your seed god no man can
[1:45:57] do that work it's something only you can
