[7:11] by your own hands you would break the
[7:13] bread of life to us
[7:15] you would come lord
[7:16] and use a gift that you placed inside a
[7:18] vessel of clay
[7:20] now you would use it as an instrument in
[7:22] your hand for shaping of the lively
[7:23] stones for the feeding of your sheep
[7:26] that you might accomplish all you desire
[7:28] to accomplish this morning for we yield

[7:48] amen
[7:49] may god bless you while we're standing
[7:51] let's take our bibles and go to genesis
[7:52] chapter 3.
[7:55] we'll read a verse of scripture and let
[7:56] you have your seats and then there's a
[7:58] testament a couple testimonies i'd like
[7:59] to share with you
[8:02] let's turn to genesis chapter 3
[8:07] verse
[8:09] 7 genesis chapter 3 verse 7.
[8:14] and the eyes of them both were opened
[8:15] and they knew that they were naked and
[8:17] they sowed fig leaves together
[8:19] and made themselves aprons
[8:22] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[8:23] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[8:25] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[8:28] from the presence of the lord god
[8:30] amongst the trees of the garden
[8:32] and the lord god called him to adam and
[8:34] said unto him where art thou
[8:36] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[8:38] garden and was afraid because i was
[8:40] naked and i hid myself
[8:42] and he said who told thee that thou was
[8:44] naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[8:46] whereof i have commanded thee that thou
[8:49] should not eat amen may the lord add his
[8:51] blessing to the word you can be seated
[8:55] i have a tremendous testimony i want to
[8:57] share of brother bernie sand martin
[9:01] some of you know i asked him to write it
[9:03] out so i wouldn't lose any of the
[9:04] details
[9:06] but many of you know maybe not all of
[9:08] you know that brother bernie got a
[9:10] terrible case of shingles five years ago
[9:12] just an extreme case of shingles where
[9:15] he couldn't even have clothing touch his
[9:16] skin he broke out in a rash like he did
[9:18] in shingles many times and it was around
[9:20] his torso around his waist
[9:22] and um and so
[9:24] that left
[9:26] permanent damage to his nerves
[9:28] so for five years he suffered with
[9:30] extreme pain and if you ever wondered
[9:33] why he hugged you kind of funny
[9:35] that was why brother bernie hugged you
[9:36] kind of funny if you put too much of a
[9:38] squeeze on him he would react
[9:41] but he's been nursing this side and
[9:43] here's what he wrote down for us he said
[9:45] i want to thank god and my brothers and
[9:46] sisters that have been praying for me
[9:48] for the last five years in which i had
[9:50] suffered with nerve neuropathy caused by
[9:53] a severe case of shingles around my
[9:55] waist
[9:56] due to this pain i wore a wrap about my
[9:59] my my midriff over my t-shirt if i
[10:02] didn't do this the rubbing on my shirt
[10:03] on the area would cause a lot of pain
[10:05] there were times i felt i wanted to go
[10:07] home to my father as the pain was
[10:10] unbearable
[10:11] trying to find anything that would would
[10:14] help the pain i went to a pain
[10:16] specialist who tried twice to kill the
[10:17] nerve that was causing the pain but was
[10:20] not successful
[10:21] he also gave me a special cream with
[10:23] meds that were supposed to help and it
[10:25] also was not successful
[10:27] because all of these treatments did not
[10:28] work i have been taking ibuprofen
[10:31] and a few other things that i can't
[10:33] pronounce sorry brother bernie
[10:36] to manage the pain even with taking
[10:37] these medicines i was still in quite a
[10:39] bit of pain around a year ago i started
[10:41] putting valtterin and biofreeze on the
[10:44] pain and it was helpful
[10:46] on august 25th ezra and teresa levy
[10:49] cheryl emily and i headed for davey
[10:51] florida
[10:52] around 7 p.m so they left 7 pm and they
[10:55] drove through the night our plans were
[10:57] to travel straight through ezra took the
[10:59] night drive and i stayed up through the
[11:01] night to help ezra stay alert
[11:04] after many hours on the road we decided
[11:06] to take a break in the in the hours
[11:08] early hours of the morning they decided
[11:10] to take a break at cracker barrel we
[11:12] pulled in and as i was getting ready to
[11:14] put the wrap around my waist i noticed
[11:16] that i didn't need it anymore
[11:20] what happened
[11:21] god knows
[11:22] it felt good not to have that belt
[11:24] around my waist anymore god bless you
[11:27] brother bernie thank god
[11:33] praise the lord
[11:37] healing is a promise
[11:39] and healing the promise of healing has
[11:42] no time constraints
[11:44] it doesn't wear out after a week of no
[11:46] results or a month or or a year or even
[11:49] five years but healing is the children's
[11:52] bread and healing is our promise and it
[11:54] was paid for at calvary and you know i
[11:56] would check on brother bernie from time
[11:58] to time how are you doing how you're
[11:59] doing and he would say oh it's still
[12:02] there but i'm fine it's still there but
[12:04] he said the lord has healed me and he
[12:06] kept confessing the lord has healed me
[12:08] i'm healed and he said i know that this
[12:10] will go away he never stopped with his
[12:13] positive confession ever
[12:16] let that be an example to all of us in a
[12:18] testimony if we stay with god's word god
[12:20] honors his word we just have to stick
[12:22] with it and believe i say god bless you
[12:25] brother bernie it's good to see you
[12:27] feeling good my brother
[12:29] he went on to say i praise god for his
[12:31] healing touch i no longer have to wear
[12:33] my belt or take meds i pray this
[12:35] testimony will encourage my other
[12:37] brothers and sisters with faith that are
[12:39] living with pain i look forward to their
[12:41] testimony of god's healing
[12:44] that's a positive confession
[12:47] and he is the high priest of our
[12:49] profession which is our confession and
[12:51] so we may may we take courage
[12:53] amen by brother bernie's testimony and
[12:56] may it be an example to us
[12:58] to never stop you know never stop
[13:00] believing that you're going to be
[13:02] totally well and brother bernie was
[13:04] looking for relief they couldn't offer
[13:06] him relief anything that would just give
[13:07] him a little bit of relief so he could
[13:09] function amen but the whole time he was
[13:12] trusting god to take it completely away
[13:15] i also want to say i appreciated the
[13:16] special this morning appreciate those
[13:18] brothers who sing it may god bless you
[13:21] and and don't stop amen i mean if god
[13:24] inspires you sing once i'm sure he'll do
[13:26] it again
[13:27] praise the lord
[13:29] amen let's look back at genesis chapter
[13:31] 3.
[13:34] in uh i like i have a strange title
[13:36] because i have a strange sermon that
[13:38] came in a strange way
[13:41] so praise the lord amen
[13:43] you know i've i've i've done this for
[13:46] for years and you know
[13:48] hundreds and hundreds of sermons i may
[13:50] have preached close to a thousand
[13:52] sermons in my lifetime already
[13:54] and you never get good at it
[13:57] that's all i can say you never get good
[13:58] at it
[13:59] you never get it figured out you never
[14:01] get to the point where you can just go
[14:03] whip out a sermon and you just go sit at
[14:06] your computer do a word search and i got
[14:08] a sermon it doesn't work that way
[14:10] you cannot make it come amen you cannot
[14:12] control it with no inspiration there's
[14:14] nothing happening and you can have all
[14:16] the tools you can have the message you
[14:17] have the bible you have search programs
[14:19] with no inspiration nothing happens
[14:22] and then when inspiration comes you
[14:24] think wow that's the inspiration but
[14:26] praise the lord that's what we wait for
[14:29] and so god in a very strange and unique
[14:31] way he gave me a thought and inspiration
[14:34] came in like a wisp and it just i began
[14:36] to meditate on that and i'd like to
[14:38] share that with you this morning
[14:40] and the title i'd like to title this is
[14:42] when the lord is asking a question
[14:45] when the lord is asking a question
[14:49] we look here at genesis chapter 3
[14:53] and we'll go to verse 8
[14:55] and it says and they heard the voice of
[14:57] the lord god
[14:59] waiting in the garden in the cool of the
[15:01] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[15:03] from the presence of the lord god
[15:04] amongst the trees of the garden
[15:06] and the lord god called unto adam and
[15:08] said unto him where art thou
[15:11] now this is the first question that i
[15:13] want to look at
[15:14] god is calling out in the garden and
[15:16] he's asking a question he's asking adam
[15:18] where art thou
[15:19] and i don't believe that god didn't know
[15:21] where he was
[15:23] do you believe that god knew where adam
[15:25] was
[15:27] you know and god is in the garden and
[15:30] adam has himself hid
[15:32] and god knows what has happened amen god
[15:35] knows that the fall has taken place he
[15:38] knows where adam is hiding but he begins
[15:40] to walk in the garden and he and he
[15:43] calls out adam where art thou
[15:45] and i don't believe god was seeking
[15:48] information
[15:49] i don't think god was looking for
[15:50] information that he did not possess
[15:53] i don't think he was looking to learn
[15:54] anything to gain any new knowledge but i
[15:57] think god asked the question for adam's
[16:00] sake because god didn't need to know but
[16:02] adam needed to see
[16:05] understand and many times i believe this
[16:08] is why god asks a question god in the
[16:10] bible many times will ask a question and
[16:13] i don't believe god needs information he
[16:15] doesn't need our input so he understands
[16:17] something better or so he can finally
[16:19] understand what's going on in the
[16:21] situation but i believe when god asks a
[16:23] question god is wanting the person he's
[16:26] asking the question to realize something
[16:29] so he says uh
[16:32] where art thou
[16:34] where are you not i don't know where
[16:37] your physical location is and i need to
[16:39] know where your physical relationship
[16:40] but where are you right now adam
[16:43] spiritually where are you
[16:45] why are you hiding from me why do you
[16:48] have a fig leaf apron on why are you
[16:50] hiding amongst the trees why are you now
[16:52] afraid of my presence why are you moving
[16:55] away from me why is the fellowship
[16:57] growing weaker why are you a strain for
[17:00] me where are you
[17:02] adam
[17:04] and and as i as i was meditating as the
[17:06] lord was just leading me down this path
[17:08] and and i began to say how many times
[17:12] amen would god like to ask us that
[17:14] question
[17:16] we we begin to get distracted sometimes
[17:19] with life and we begin to move away from
[17:21] the fellowship and brothers and sisters
[17:23] and we spend time away and we're not in
[17:26] the fellowship we're we're not with our
[17:27] brothers and sisters we're not talking
[17:29] about the word amen we we're now uh
[17:32] we're now uh
[17:33] skipping a few services and there's
[17:35] always excuses you know there's always
[17:37] something important that come up and and
[17:39] no doubt there are really issues that
[17:41] come up and reasons legitimate reasons
[17:43] but but i just wonder how many times god
[17:46] would like to say where are you
[17:51] not
[17:51] we're not i'm sitting in my car right
[17:53] now or i'm kneeling by my bed praying
[17:56] that's not what he wants to know but
[17:57] where are you
[17:59] why are you pulling back from my
[18:01] fellowship why are you hiding why have
[18:05] you become fearful why are you not
[18:07] running to me in trouble but why are you
[18:10] pulling back where are you
[18:15] and and adam says
[18:19] verse 10 and he said i heard thy voice
[18:21] in the garden
[18:22] and i was afraid
[18:24] because i was naked
[18:26] and i hid myself
[18:30] verse 11 and he said
[18:32] who told thee
[18:33] that thou was naked
[18:37] nobody had told him he was naked he
[18:40] realized it because of his sin
[18:43] his sin had broke through the veil of
[18:46] innocency and now a lust veil had
[18:48] dropped over and he realized that he was
[18:50] naked and so now god was getting adam to
[18:55] recognize and to declare what his
[18:57] condition is
[19:00] he said
[19:01] who
[19:03] who told thee that thou was naked hast
[19:05] thou eaten of the tree whereof i
[19:07] commanded thee
[19:09] that thou should us not eat
[19:12] jesus is asking a question
[19:14] adam
[19:15] adam becomes fearful and in this fear he
[19:18] makes a covering for himself and and and
[19:21] and that covering for himself they find
[19:23] in the presence of lord is insufficient
[19:25] so when god's coming down they run and
[19:27] hide and and i i i know from experience
[19:31] that many times when you see somebody
[19:33] begin to pull back from fellowship from
[19:35] brothers and sisters listen brothers and
[19:37] sisters this is nothing about church
[19:39] attendance
[19:40] this is not about you know a perfect
[19:43] attendance score i'm talking about
[19:45] pulling back from the fellowship
[19:48] pulling back from god with skin on it
[19:52] pulling back and the question is why are
[19:54] you pulling back amen what is going on
[19:57] in your life amen why are you
[19:59] withdrawing yourself what what is going
[20:02] on where are you at
[20:06] where are you at
[20:08] what is
[20:09] you tell me where you're at
[20:12] oh my could you imagine standing in the
[20:15] very presence of god and god says where
[20:17] are you and you know he's not asking you
[20:19] where you are on the globe and where you
[20:22] are amen standing at the present tense
[20:24] but he's asking where you are i mean
[20:26] where what's your spiritual condition
[20:28] can you even discern where you are right
[20:30] now
[20:33] and can you imagine standing in the
[20:35] presence of god and he says where are
[20:36] you and all of a sudden all the excuses
[20:39] that come to mind well we've got this
[20:40] going on this going we've been really
[20:42] busy and i've got troubles and besides
[20:44] they hurt my feelings and
[20:50] but in that presence
[20:53] he wants to know where you are
[20:57] and he asks another question
[20:59] who told you
[21:01] you were naked now
[21:02] god knew nobody told him he was naked
[21:05] he's wanting him to realize
[21:08] this is your condition because of your
[21:10] sin
[21:11] who told you you're naked did you eat
[21:13] the tree did you disobey the word have
[21:16] you left my commandment this is why
[21:18] you're in this condition
[21:21] and he's trying to wake adam up to his
[21:24] condition
[21:26] i come across this quote and i'd like to
[21:28] read it to you from 1958 from hear his
[21:31] voice
[21:33] it says we've got too many things ahead
[21:35] of the lord
[21:36] you can't have the prayer meetings
[21:37] because mr godfrey's on tonight you
[21:40] can't have prayer meetings because we
[21:41] love susie is on tonight or some kind of
[21:44] foolish nonsense like that that takes up
[21:46] the time
[21:47] we don't have time to hear the voice of
[21:49] the lord and those who do claim to be
[21:51] christians just kneel down of a little
[21:53] prayer like this kind of homemade lord
[21:55] bless me and my family and take care of
[21:57] us good night and the next morning rise
[22:00] up say just guide us through my day good
[22:01] day
[22:03] we should wait on the lord
[22:05] you see we do all the talking we don't
[22:07] give him a chance to talk back to us
[22:11] that if we would pray and pray until our
[22:14] soul comes into the presence of god and
[22:16] then just relax and listen to his voice
[22:21] oh i believe this is a key friends
[22:23] we're learning a key this morning we're
[22:26] tapping into something that that is real
[22:28] and will bring reality amen not the not
[22:31] the quick prayer that every one of us
[22:34] are guilty of falling into these traps
[22:35] because of the pace of life where we
[22:37] just go to bed god bless us help us you
[22:39] know sleep good and tomorrow give us a
[22:41] good day god bless you it's not an
[22:43] insincere prayer it's a sincere prayer
[22:46] it's not an insincere devotion it's a
[22:47] sincere devotion but it's it's clipped
[22:50] because of time constraints and we wake
[22:52] up in the morning oh god help us today
[22:54] and help us through our day and
[22:55] and good day and we move on through the
[22:57] day and brother branham is giving us a
[22:59] key he's saying listen all you've done
[23:02] is made your request to god but you
[23:04] never heard back from god
[23:07] takes time
[23:09] sometimes to hear back
[23:12] sometimes it's not a quick just a 10 15
[23:16] minute 20 minute deal not a routine kind
[23:18] of a thing but laying aside some time
[23:21] amen
[23:22] and and laying in the presence of lord
[23:24] and not hiding from the presence of the
[23:25] lord
[23:26] you can say a prayer and not enter into
[23:29] his presence you can say a prayer and
[23:32] say it quick enough and do all the
[23:33] talking where no conviction comes to
[23:35] your heart
[23:37] it's possible
[23:40] you can say a prayer and you can do you
[23:42] you can do your devotion do your prayer
[23:45] and you can go through it so quick god
[23:47] doesn't have time to start working on
[23:49] the heart
[23:51] and you just move on and you come back
[23:53] and we can get to feeling good because
[23:54] we've got the routine down but but we
[23:57] haven't got come into the presence of
[23:58] the lord and stayed there long enough
[24:00] where he can begin to ask us a question
[24:04] to begin to ask us something or say
[24:06] something to our heart or prick our
[24:08] heart in a certain way it may be enough
[24:10] time where we lay in the presence of the
[24:12] lord long enough where he says where are
[24:14] you
[24:16] where have you been
[24:21] praise god
[24:24] see
[24:25] more than anything
[24:28] we want the reality
[24:31] this is this is the end time
[24:35] this is the final stage of the journey
[24:38] this is the final part of redemption for
[24:40] the gentile bride this is the wrapping
[24:43] up of all things this is this is we've
[24:45] said this over and over and we will say
[24:47] it over and over again but this is not
[24:49] the repeat of a previous church age
[24:52] this is where god is dwelling in flesh
[24:56] on earth again in the flesh of his bride
[24:59] and there has to be a relationship a
[25:01] presence with god a walking with the
[25:03] lord in the cool of the evening you
[25:05] could say and where there's a
[25:07] relationship in time to speak to him but
[25:10] also time for him to speak to you times
[25:13] of meditation times where you think on
[25:15] these things
[25:18] and god can begin to open things to us
[25:22] i want to look at another one let's go
[25:23] to first kings chapter 19.
[25:35] first kings chapter 19.
[25:46] i'm gonna start at verse 11 i think
[25:54] no i'm sorry
[25:57] let's go to verse 9.
[25:59] first kings 19-9
[26:01] this is elijah
[26:04] and he's running away after the mount
[26:06] carmel showdown
[26:08] jezebel's after him
[26:10] god puts him to rest and has an angel
[26:12] feed him
[26:13] then he runs to mount horeb
[26:15] it says and he came hither unto a cave
[26:18] and lodged there and behold the word of
[26:20] the lord came to him
[26:21] and he said unto him what doest thou
[26:24] hear elijah
[26:26] boy here's another good question
[26:29] what are you doing here
[26:31] like why are you here
[26:34] and
[26:35] and watch watch elijah's answer
[26:38] and he said i have been very jealous for
[26:40] the lord god of hosts for the children
[26:42] of israel have forsaken thy covenant
[26:44] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[26:46] prophets with the sword and i even i
[26:49] only am left and they seek my life to
[26:51] take it away
[26:52] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[26:54] mount before the lord and he'd be behold
[26:56] and the lord passed by
[26:59] and a great and strong wind rent the the
[27:01] mountains and break it in pieces and the
[27:03] rocks before the lord but the lord was
[27:05] not in the wind
[27:06] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[27:08] lord was not in the earthquake
[27:11] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[27:13] lord was not in the fire and after the
[27:15] fire a still small voice
[27:17] and brother brenham said what was that
[27:19] voice it was the word
[27:22] because he's known in the word that's
[27:24] how you hear his voice in the word
[27:28] and there was a still small voice
[27:31] verse 13
[27:32] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[27:34] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[27:36] went out and stood in the entering into
[27:38] the cave and behold there came a voice
[27:40] unto him
[27:41] and said what doest thou hear elijah
[27:44] same question
[27:46] he asked him the question so elijah gave
[27:49] him the answer but god didn't need the
[27:52] information
[27:54] because he wouldn't have asked him the
[27:56] second time
[27:58] elijah already answered the question
[28:00] what doest out here i'm here because
[28:02] i've been jealous over you and i've done
[28:04] all this
[28:05] and then they seek my life and and he's
[28:08] he's he's giving an answer to the
[28:10] question amen but but the question
[28:12] hasn't yet had its effect on elijah yet
[28:15] because elijah's just answering the
[28:16] question
[28:18] what are you doing here and if elijah
[28:20] had sufficiently answered the question
[28:22] god would have never asked him the
[28:23] question a second time but god asked him
[28:26] a question the second time because he
[28:28] wanted elijah to learn something in the
[28:31] question god didn't want to learn
[28:33] something
[28:34] in the question
[28:36] what are you doing here
[28:39] why why are you here
[28:41] elijah has excuses and he's got you know
[28:45] when we look at elijah and what he bent
[28:47] through and what's happening to him you
[28:49] you none of us would blame him for being
[28:51] upset and running away and all the
[28:53] things that he was going through it's
[28:54] logical it makes sense i would say you
[28:56] know in his situation i'd probably do
[28:58] the same thing but god doesn't react to
[29:00] situations the way you and i react to
[29:02] situations god is not carnal like we are
[29:05] carnal
[29:06] and when elijah runs away amen and now
[29:09] he's in horeb and now he's in a cave and
[29:12] he says what are you doing here elijah
[29:15] well he goes to the carnal i was doing
[29:18] this and i was doing that and they
[29:20] sought my life and they chased me and
[29:21] i've run here to hide amen and god
[29:24] begins to speak to elijah and he comes
[29:27] in and a great uh a great uh wind that
[29:30] rips the rocks and god wasn't in the
[29:32] wind and god's showing it it's not any
[29:34] of these big things it's not any of
[29:36] these these giant things it's the still
[29:38] small voice
[29:40] we're looking for big flashes of things
[29:43] big giant movements of stuff i mean big
[29:45] things that are tangible you can see
[29:47] that really demonstrate the power of god
[29:49] but brother branham when he came to this
[29:51] he said it was the word that's what it
[29:53] was and that's what we that's what
[29:55] elijah began to respond to was the word
[30:01] and and when he heard the word the still
[30:03] small voice you see
[30:05] he may have trembled under the under the
[30:08] uh wind he may have trembled at the fire
[30:11] he may have shook at the earthquake amen
[30:14] but nothing moved him to humility into
[30:16] action until he heard the still small
[30:18] voice but when he heard the word he
[30:20] wrapped his face in a mantle in a show
[30:22] of humility and went to the entrance of
[30:24] the cave and stood there
[30:27] now he was ready to listen
[30:30] and god said to him
[30:32] a second time
[30:35] he said
[30:37] in verse 13
[30:39] at the end of verse 13
[30:42] what doest thou hear elijah
[30:44] elijah goes into the same answer and he
[30:46] said i have been very jealous for the
[30:48] lord god of host because the children of
[30:50] israel forsaken thy covenant thrown down
[30:52] thy altars slain thy prophets with the
[30:54] sword and i
[30:56] even i only am left
[30:59] and they seek my life to take it away
[31:01] and the lord said unto him go return on
[31:03] thy way
[31:05] see god was not interested in the
[31:07] information that elijah was giving him
[31:09] god was not learning something changing
[31:11] his mind deciding what to do next
[31:15] but god asked a question to elijah so
[31:17] elijah would begin to answer the
[31:19] question what are you doing here and he
[31:21] asked him once and he gives an answer he
[31:23] asked him a second time he gives him
[31:25] virtually the exact same answer and
[31:27] elijah was missing something so god just
[31:30] said go back to where you came from
[31:33] you're not hiding out anymore you're not
[31:35] running away from the commission you you
[31:38] go back to where you came from and he
[31:40] sends him back with a furtherance of his
[31:42] commission and with more work to do and
[31:44] he sends him back to anoint jehu to
[31:46] anoint elisha to anoint a new king in
[31:48] syria and he sends him back with a
[31:50] commission because elijah was never
[31:52] supposed to get out of the commission
[31:56] and god was still tender and merciful to
[31:57] him god put him to sleep god baked cakes
[32:00] over coals for him god sent an angel to
[32:02] him amen god wasn't hating elijah he
[32:04] wasn't upset with elijah he wasn't angry
[32:06] with him but he had to get elijah
[32:08] awakened to where he was you're out of
[32:11] commission you've moved away from the
[32:12] calling you've run in fear you've moved
[32:15] outside of my plan for you and now just
[32:18] go back
[32:20] so god doesn't respond to his answer
[32:24] god sends him in a further commission
[32:28] so i wonder
[32:30] if god ever asked us
[32:32] what are you doing here
[32:35] and the question is what are you doing
[32:36] here
[32:38] i would ask the question what am i doing
[32:39] here what am i doing in the end time
[32:43] what am i doing here
[32:45] like in this location in this body in
[32:48] this time
[32:49] in this church
[32:51] in my what am i doing here
[32:54] am i here fulfilling the commission and
[32:56] the purpose god has for my life
[32:59] what am i or am i sidetracked by
[33:02] something am i am i distracted if i if i
[33:05] moved away
[33:07] have there been so many hurts so many
[33:11] misunderstandings and jezebel spirits
[33:14] that have lashed out against me have i
[33:15] run from my purpose and commission and
[33:17] decided to take a vacation from being a
[33:20] son or daughter of god
[33:24] that happens to people
[33:26] they get so hurt they get so
[33:28] misunderstood they get so questioned
[33:31] amen they they have so many hard things
[33:33] that take place and god never told us
[33:35] hard things wouldn't take place he never
[33:37] told us that we wouldn't have problems
[33:38] even amongst brethren
[33:41] because that's why you need brotherly
[33:43] love
[33:44] because if all the brethren are always
[33:46] perfect and always treats you perfect
[33:47] and you don't need brotherly love you
[33:49] need brotherly love to cover for your
[33:51] brethren when they need brotherly love
[33:54] so god never promised these things would
[33:56] be easy he never promised they'd be
[33:58] perfect but we're here for a purpose
[34:00] amen we've been given life in this age
[34:02] and a purpose the message has come to us
[34:04] for a purpose we're in the home the
[34:06] family the church the the job we're in
[34:09] the school we're in the place that we
[34:11] are for a purpose and it's not so that
[34:13] we can run away when things get tough
[34:15] and go hide out in a cave somewhere
[34:17] because if you do that god may be tender
[34:20] and merciful to you and may give you
[34:22] some special provision and special
[34:23] strength but eventually he's going to
[34:25] ask you the question what are you doing
[34:27] here
[34:29] why did you stop testifying why have you
[34:31] quit being bold with the word why have
[34:34] you stopped amen in the commission when
[34:36] i've commissioned you why why are you
[34:38] taking a time out
[34:41] timeout is too much
[34:43] god may god will be tender with his
[34:46] children like he was with elijah
[34:48] but eventually the question will come
[34:50] what are you doing here
[34:53] what are you doing here
[34:55] well brother so-and-so hurt my feelings
[34:57] and this one said this about me and
[35:00] i didn't get the the this or that and uh
[35:02] somebody else got it over me and
[35:04] whatever whatever you know all of it
[35:07] we've all lived the same kind of life
[35:11] god will ask you again what are you
[35:12] doing here you can go through the same
[35:13] thing it'll say
[35:15] go back
[35:17] go back to living a life
[35:20] vibrant and joyful go back to testifying
[35:23] go back for boldly proclaiming the truth
[35:25] go go back with joy that you've been
[35:28] called to bear the gospel in this end
[35:30] time go back go back into commission go
[35:32] back into work and here's some extra
[35:34] stuff i want you to do
[35:37] go back
[35:39] see when god asks a question
[35:42] there's a purpose behind the question
[35:44] let's go back to genesis chapter 4.
[35:59] genesis chapter 4
[36:02] verse 5.
[36:05] but unto cain and to his offering he had
[36:07] not respect
[36:09] and cain was very roth
[36:11] and his countenance fell
[36:13] and the lord said to cain why art thou
[36:15] wroth
[36:16] and why is thy countenance fallen
[36:19] so i'm sure you're already ahead of me
[36:21] by now
[36:22] i don't think god didn't know
[36:26] i don't think god's going to cane and
[36:27] saying
[36:29] okay i noticed you look is something
[36:31] wrong
[36:32] is something eating at you
[36:34] did something go wrong in your day
[36:37] what's happened
[36:39] no
[36:40] god knew exactly why cain was wroth and
[36:43] he knew exactly why his countenance fell
[36:46] but the question wasn't for god to get
[36:48] information the question was meant to
[36:50] open cain's eyes
[36:53] why are you rough
[36:56] why is your countenance fallen
[36:59] why are you so upset verse 70 says if
[37:02] thou does well
[37:04] so
[37:05] god didn't wait for an answer
[37:10] so he didn't need an answer he wasn't
[37:12] looking for an answer the answer was in
[37:14] cain's heart
[37:16] if thou does well shalt thou not be
[37:18] accepted and if thou doest not well send
[37:20] life at the door and unto thee shall be
[37:22] his desire and thou shalt rule over him
[37:26] god comes to cain and says why are you
[37:28] so angry if you just do amen like abel
[37:31] does if you just do right it'll be well
[37:33] with thee why are you so angry why is
[37:35] your countenance fall almost it's the
[37:37] question
[37:38] um if i could rephrase it i don't want
[37:40] to add to the scriptures or take away
[37:42] but i'd like to say it this way
[37:45] why are you angry
[37:48] like what right do you have to be angry
[37:52] that i would accept one sacrifice and
[37:53] not another and why would you let that
[37:55] make your countenance fall
[37:58] like why are you angry
[38:02] i'd like to ask the question to all of
[38:03] us hey listen we want god to speak amen
[38:07] but we believe that through the gifts
[38:08] through the fifo ministry god speaks
[38:11] and and just take it as god asking a
[38:14] question this morning why are you so mad
[38:17] why are you so frustrated
[38:20] i may not be speaking to everybody but
[38:22] i'm speaking to somebody this morning i
[38:24] know that for sure
[38:26] why are you so angry
[38:29] are you angry because life's not been
[38:30] fair are you angry because people didn't
[38:33] treat you right are you angry because
[38:35] things haven't worked out the way you
[38:36] want to work out are you angry because
[38:37] somebody cheated you're angry because
[38:39] somebody said something about you are
[38:40] you angry why are you angry and i want
[38:43] to follow up with this question what
[38:45] right have you to be angry
[38:51] why are you so upset
[38:53] why are you so frustrated why can't you
[38:55] get over
[38:57] what somebody did to you in the past why
[38:59] can't you get over an abuse and neglect
[39:01] why can't you move beyond why why can't
[39:04] you wake up and see that god is your
[39:06] father and he knows where you're at and
[39:09] he knows what you're suffering from he
[39:11] knows what's happened to you and he
[39:13] knows why it happened to you and he
[39:14] knows what purpose it will serve and he
[39:16] also knows that all things work together
[39:18] for the good he never said all things
[39:21] are good but all things work together
[39:22] for the good
[39:24] the question is why are you angry
[39:27] and why is your countenance falling
[39:30] why can't you have joy why can't you
[39:32] look in the face of the rest of the
[39:34] believers why why can't you be happy and
[39:36] joyful and vibrant why can't you
[39:39] be eager to look in the face of god why
[39:41] are you wrath and why is your
[39:42] countenance falling what is it that
[39:45] makes you think you've been cheated what
[39:47] makes you think you've been unfairly
[39:49] treated what makes you think that life
[39:51] is harder for you than it is for anybody
[39:53] else
[39:57] god asks a question because he doesn't
[39:59] want the answer god asks a question
[40:02] because he wants you to discern the
[40:04] answer
[40:06] he doesn't ask to get information he has
[40:08] to open our eyes amen and he's asking
[40:10] this morning why are you so angry
[40:15] and why is your countenance falling
[40:20] everybody gets stepped on
[40:24] neglected
[40:25] passed over
[40:27] everybody's been unconsidered a time or
[40:30] two
[40:31] some more than others some i agree some
[40:34] sufferings of others seem to be more
[40:35] than the sufferings of some i don't
[40:37] understand that but one thing i know is
[40:39] that we have a good father
[40:44] we have a heavenly father and he's a
[40:47] good father and he knows what he's doing
[40:49] with our lives he's not making mistakes
[40:52] he's not absent-minded he's not favoring
[40:54] one child over another child
[40:58] but our attitude amen begins to our
[41:02] attitude of anger and frustration and
[41:05] and our countenance falling what it
[41:07] begins to say is that this isn't fair so
[41:11] god is not just
[41:16] this it should have never happened to me
[41:19] this is not right this is not fair and
[41:22] all you're saying is god has not done a
[41:25] good job with my life
[41:32] what right did cain have to be angry
[41:35] because god determined which was the
[41:36] right way of worship
[41:41] god is god
[41:43] god was supposed to be the object of
[41:45] worship
[41:46] god was supposed to be the one they were
[41:48] seeking to please
[41:50] they were supposed to be coming to the
[41:51] altar and making their offerings to
[41:53] satisfy their father to satisfy god amen
[41:56] they were supposed to be worshipping him
[41:58] they were supposed to be pleasing him
[42:00] not themselves so when god says i'm
[42:02] pleased with this and not this why would
[42:04] that make you angry
[42:07] why would you get upset because if your
[42:10] objective is to please god and god says
[42:12] this is what pleases me why wouldn't you
[42:15] just repeat what pleases him what he
[42:17] accepted just do if your motive is pure
[42:20] if your love for god is genuine amen
[42:22] then you'll just throw away your own
[42:24] pride and your own thoughts and what you
[42:26] thought was right just throw it in the
[42:27] trash and say this is what god wants
[42:29] i'll do that
[42:31] because what i want is to worship him
[42:33] and what i want is to please him it's
[42:35] not about me it's about him but cain
[42:37] proved it was about him not about god
[42:42] and god of his mercy he comes along and
[42:44] he says why are you so roth and why is
[42:47] your countenance fallen he doesn't wait
[42:49] for an answer he knows what the problem
[42:50] is he says just just do if you do well
[42:54] want to be well with thee
[42:57] not send life at the door
[43:00] brother interprets this he says just do
[43:02] what abel did and it'll be well with
[43:04] thee
[43:07] but he was offended
[43:10] he was offended
[43:12] at god's choice
[43:16] he was offended
[43:18] he really was offended at god's desire
[43:24] and so this morning
[43:26] it would just allow me to ask the
[43:28] question
[43:29] and it may not affect it might only
[43:32] affect one tenth of one percent of
[43:34] everybody that's listening
[43:36] but if it affects you take it from the
[43:38] lord
[43:39] why are you so roth
[43:41] and why is your countenance falling
[43:44] why
[43:46] why
[43:49] why do you act like
[43:52] god is so unfair with you
[43:55] but so good to everyone else
[43:59] why
[44:00] why are you feeling so easily hurt
[44:04] brother bram said christians are
[44:06] rugged you don't have to pet them or
[44:09] baby them
[44:10] you don't soft-soak the gospel for them
[44:12] they're not some uh hot house plant
[44:15] they're rugged amen they can take it
[44:18] they can take the abuse look at the
[44:20] first century christians they can take
[44:22] it
[44:23] look at brother branham they can take it
[44:27] he was an example of toss of a mature
[44:29] believer not that it was easy he wept
[44:31] amen not that he always got it right he
[44:33] had to be corrected amen but when he
[44:36] when he when he comes to the poop and
[44:37] says i'm all cut up on the inside from a
[44:39] lot of hard battles listen friends he
[44:41] was cut up on the inside from a lot of
[44:43] hard battles amen but he wanted to do
[44:46] what elijah did he wanted to run to the
[44:49] cave up in alaska he wanted to go be a
[44:51] guide he wanted to get away from it all
[44:53] because of the rejection because of
[44:55] every reason elijah wanted to run
[44:56] brother branham wanted to run
[44:59] and god come to him and discern that and
[45:02] he and he did the same thing he did for
[45:04] elijah
[45:05] he comes along and he he has a
[45:07] conversation with his prophet as his
[45:09] prophets going along
[45:11] he said if you do what you've got
[45:12] planned to do amen you'll become a bum
[45:15] and your wife will leave you
[45:18] brother branham he's talking to god he
[45:20] doesn't want to be like that but he
[45:21] doesn't want to put himself back out
[45:23] there for more hurt amen and he wrestles
[45:25] it out until he surrenders to the lord
[45:28] and he recognizes that god is right and
[45:30] he begins to lay his life down all over
[45:32] again amen and he comes and preaches
[45:34] standing in the gap and then standing in
[45:36] the gap he begins to say listen he says
[45:38] he goes i i i still don't have the right
[45:42] attitude
[45:46] there's a man who can judge himself
[45:49] there's a man who god asked him a
[45:50] question and he didn't give him a
[45:52] trivial answer god asked him a question
[45:54] he began to say i'm wrong
[45:57] his eyes begin to open
[46:01] god asked him one time after he got his
[46:03] wife to kind of lie
[46:05] and it's kind of debatable whether it
[46:07] was a lie or not
[46:09] because the lawyer was calling and they
[46:11] recognized it was the lawyer calling and
[46:13] he didn't want to answer no more
[46:14] questions he was exhausted amen he told
[46:17] his wife he says i'll step outside and
[46:20] you tell him i stepped outside
[46:24] lie or not lied
[46:27] i mean we could all probably write an
[46:28] essay on it and all have our own
[46:29] opinions
[46:31] but none of us would answer the wrong
[46:32] way because we heard what the ancient
[46:33] lord said so it's not fair
[46:36] we've already got to the punchline
[46:39] but he does what he's finding some
[46:41] relief and he goes and he says tell him
[46:43] i stepped outside he steps outside and
[46:46] his wife says i'm sorry he stepped
[46:47] outside take a message and he comes in
[46:49] and his wife looks at him and says was
[46:51] that exactly right
[46:57] who was asking the question
[47:01] it may have come through a wife
[47:04] but it was more than just the wife
[47:08] was that exactly right
[47:11] sometimes god questions you through a
[47:13] brother or sister
[47:16] and you want to get mad at the brother
[47:17] or sister who asked you the question
[47:19] brother or sister will say hey i haven't
[47:21] seen you in church for a while is
[47:22] everything going on why is everybody so
[47:24] nosy why are they they're just waiting
[47:25] for me to mess up
[47:29] what attitude is that
[47:33] brother bam he goes down he said he
[47:36] brushes it oh yeah yeah i was i was
[47:38] technically i was outside
[47:43] it was
[47:44] technically true
[47:47] but reality it was false
[47:50] he goes to pray
[47:52] for a man's baby and as he's praying he
[47:54] goes to pray he goes to lay hands on
[47:56] this man's baby and the lord speaks in
[47:58] his heart and says how can you lay hands
[47:59] on that baby when you lied
[48:04] boy that's a good question
[48:06] how can you lay hands on that baby when
[48:08] you lie and brother branham had to tell
[48:10] them i'm sorry i've got to go make
[48:12] something right he runs through the
[48:13] woods he prays it through he calls the
[48:15] lawyers or he calls the law he then
[48:17] prays it through i don't remember the
[48:18] order and he makes it right with the
[48:20] lawyers he makes it right with his wife
[48:21] he makes it right with god
[48:24] he didn't get mad he didn't get angry he
[48:26] didn't throw up excuses he didn't go
[48:28] back to logic and reasoning why would
[48:30] you throw logic and reasoning in the
[48:32] face of god
[48:35] he just surrendered to the question
[48:37] that's right how can i like hansen's
[48:40] baby when i lied
[48:41] and he goes and makes it right
[48:43] he realizes that his wife had asked him
[48:46] the right question
[48:49] so many times we're getting asked the
[48:51] right question
[48:52] we're getting asked it by other
[48:54] believers we're getting asked it by our
[48:55] spouse maybe we're getting asked it by
[48:57] our children
[48:58] daddy why do we do this when brother
[49:00] benham said
[49:07] why is it okay for so-and-so and what
[49:09] not okay for this
[49:11] maybe the question
[49:13] is not because you need to give it an
[49:15] answer but maybe the question is coming
[49:18] so god can open our eyes
[49:20] not for god to learn but for us to see
[49:26] sometimes the question's coming across
[49:28] the pulpit it's coming over a tape or
[49:30] it's coming in meditation or through
[49:32] prayer it's coming from a brother or
[49:34] sister or a family member the question's
[49:36] coming and sometimes the question can
[49:38] come from an unbeliever
[49:41] have you ever had an unbeliever ask you
[49:42] a question that pricked your heart and
[49:44] smites you to the core and you realize
[49:46] you're wrong
[49:48] i say oh god it's not time to say a few
[49:51] unbelievable what do you know
[49:56] it's time to be real with god
[49:58] and let the question have its effect let
[50:01] the question open our eyes to our
[50:03] condition so that we can judge ourselves
[50:06] because if you judge yourselves you
[50:07] shall not be judged
[50:12] so he asked cain a question but cain
[50:15] couldn't respond to the question
[50:19] let's look at john chapter 8
[50:23] and there's really no rhyme or reason to
[50:24] these these are just what came to me
[50:27] so i'm going through them as the lord
[50:29] leads
[50:30] john chapter 8.
[50:45] john chapter 8 verse 2
[50:47] and early in the morning
[50:49] he came again into the temple and all
[50:51] the people came unto him and he sat down
[50:54] and taught them
[50:55] and the scribes and the pharisees
[50:57] brought unto him a woman taken in
[50:58] adultery and when they had set her in
[51:01] the midst they say unto him master this
[51:03] woman was taken in adultery
[51:05] in the very act
[51:07] now moses and the law commanded us that
[51:09] such should be stoned but what sayest
[51:11] thou
[51:12] this they said tempting him that they
[51:14] might have to accuse him but jesus
[51:17] stooped down and with his finger wrote
[51:19] on the ground as though he heard them
[51:21] not so when they continued asking him he
[51:23] he lifted up himself and said unto them
[51:26] he that is without sin among you let him
[51:28] first cast a stone at her
[51:31] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[51:32] the ground
[51:34] and they which heard it being convicted
[51:36] by their own conscience went out one by
[51:38] one beginning at the eldest even to the
[51:40] last
[51:42] and jesus was left alone
[51:44] and the woman standing in the midst
[51:47] when jesus had lifted up himself and saw
[51:49] none but the woman he said unto her
[51:51] woman
[51:53] where are thine accusers
[51:56] what a question
[51:59] what a question
[52:03] let the lord ask you that question
[52:06] where are your accusers
[52:10] god
[52:11] is through the blood of jesus christ
[52:13] unto the plan of redemption he's dealing
[52:15] with the accusers
[52:17] and he's getting the accusers dealt with
[52:19] and he's moving them off the scene and
[52:21] he's bringing us back into our original
[52:23] condition sinless virtuous spotless
[52:26] bride of jesus christ that never did in
[52:28] the first place washed by the water of
[52:30] the word and brought back but this woman
[52:32] was condemned and she was condemned amen
[52:35] by these religious leaders and they were
[52:37] corrupt to begin with because they
[52:39] caught her in the very act of adultery
[52:41] and they brought her alone with no man
[52:42] proving that the motive was completely
[52:44] wrong to begin with
[52:47] so now they come and they say you know
[52:49] what should we do and he writes
[52:50] something in the sand whatever he writes
[52:52] begins to convict their heart they begin
[52:54] to recognize they're wrong
[52:56] and they walk away and when when jesus
[52:59] deals with the accusers
[53:03] then he turns to the woman and he says
[53:05] where are thine accusers
[53:07] jesus knew where the accusers were he
[53:10] wants her to recognize she's now free
[53:14] from accusation
[53:16] he's waking her up to the fact she's got
[53:19] she's no doubt she's in shame she's got
[53:21] her own condemnation she was caught in
[53:23] the very act of adultery that would be a
[53:26] shameful experience she was drugged out
[53:28] in public by a mob a group of men at
[53:30] least and drug unto the feet of jesus in
[53:33] the temple it meant a public spectacle
[53:35] and now this has been going on she may
[53:37] not have even raised her head and
[53:38] because she was so shameful and so
[53:40] embarrassed about what happened but
[53:42] jesus was taking this poor woman who was
[53:44] a pawn in their game and a tool for the
[53:46] religious leaders and he was going to
[53:48] free her from that bondage
[53:51] but first he took the word or whatever
[53:54] word he wrote i don't know what it was
[53:56] but whatever he wrote whatever he put in
[53:58] the sand
[53:59] dealt with the religious leaders
[54:03] and they left
[54:05] and when god had dealt with them he
[54:07] turns to the woman and says where are
[54:08] thine accusers
[54:11] praise god
[54:14] where are thine accusers
[54:18] hath no man
[54:20] condemn thee
[54:22] she said no man lord
[54:24] and jesus said unto her neither do i
[54:27] condemn thee
[54:28] go
[54:30] and sin no more
[54:33] you know
[54:34] sometimes we carry guilt with us for
[54:38] past deeds
[54:40] we carry guilt and shame and regrets
[54:44] for years and years and years and those
[54:47] guilt that guilt
[54:49] that shame that regret what it does is
[54:52] the devil is constantly bringing
[54:54] condemnation and conviction and he's
[54:56] your accuser and what he's doing he's
[54:59] trying to limit your freedom he's trying
[55:02] to stop you from living an overcoming
[55:04] life he's trying to stop you from
[55:06] witnessing stop you from being joyful
[55:08] stop the word from taking effect in your
[55:10] life to where you become a bright and
[55:11] shining light that all can run to
[55:14] and so he's using all this condemnation
[55:17] and this guilt from this past and this
[55:18] woman had a whole heap of it amen but
[55:21] god the lord jesus begins to deal with
[55:24] the accusers and then he moves the
[55:27] accusers off the scene that's why
[55:29] brothers when we go in the resurrection
[55:31] amen that we stand before the lord the
[55:33] accuser of the brethren is not there
[55:35] when we go up he comes down
[55:37] and god makes sure when he draws his
[55:39] little bride to himself there's no other
[55:41] man there there's no other human being
[55:44] there it's just his bride and when his
[55:46] bride's standing there there's nobody
[55:49] there to accuse her of anything
[55:52] he has already dealt with all the
[55:54] accusers amen the accuser of the
[55:56] brethren been cast down when we get
[55:58] there all those that he worked through
[56:00] to throw accusations at you and point a
[56:02] finger and all that they won't be there
[56:07] and in this day god through a prophetic
[56:10] ministry has dealt with all the accusers
[56:14] he's dealt with all the accusers of
[56:17] accusing you of false doctrine and
[56:18] accusing you of this and this and that
[56:20] and
[56:21] and trying to bring false understanding
[56:23] and false teaching and bring you into
[56:25] adultery and he's dealt with all of that
[56:27] he's cast it all out
[56:30] and he looks at this little bride and he
[56:32] says
[56:33] where are thine accusers
[56:36] he wants you to realize
[56:39] that he
[56:41] has made you free
[56:42] he has been your advocate he's dealt
[56:45] with all those that bring condemnation
[56:47] and now the woman can raise her head and
[56:49] look around and he says is there no man
[56:51] to condemn thee and she says no man lord
[56:53] he says neither do i condemn thee
[56:56] go
[56:57] and sin no more
[57:00] this gospel came to set us free
[57:03] this word the washing of the water of
[57:05] the word came to wash all stint all all
[57:08] stain of sin off of us amen and it came
[57:12] to declare unto us brother branham's
[57:14] thanksgiving message he said i'm more
[57:15] thankful for this than anything i know
[57:17] of now you can be the sinless spotless
[57:19] bride of jesus christ taken back amen to
[57:22] your original condition what god
[57:24] intended for you to be before the fall
[57:26] amen as sons and daughters of god washed
[57:29] pearly white snow white and clean where
[57:32] are your accusers if you have any
[57:34] accuser tell them to go talk to the lord
[57:36] and he'll deal with them the same way he
[57:38] dealt with all the other accusers
[57:43] god wants us to go free
[57:46] where are thine accusers
[57:49] i have none
[57:52] that means if she had none she was going
[57:54] to have to stop accusing herself
[58:00] jesus dealt
[58:01] with all the physical accusers
[58:05] that brought accusation against her got
[58:06] them away then jesus declared i don't
[58:10] even accuse you
[58:12] now the only person left that can hold
[58:15] her back is herself
[58:20] this day through a prophet we've been
[58:22] declared to be the virtuous sinless
[58:24] spotless bride of jesus christ that
[58:26] there's been a pure word to wash us and
[58:28] bring us back to the original condition
[58:30] he's dealt with the accusers
[58:33] and he said to you neither do i accuse
[58:35] you now the only thing that can hold you
[58:38] back is if you accuse yourself
[58:44] say god
[58:46] help us to realize
[58:48] we have no accusers
[58:50] and neither do you accuse me
[58:53] and help me god to stop walking
[58:57] in condemnation
[58:59] if there's no more accusers and i've
[59:01] been freed from the accusations and you
[59:03] don't even accuse me anymore let me stop
[59:05] accusing myself
[59:09] and let me go free
[59:13] jesus said or the apostle paul said
[59:15] there is therefore now no condemnation
[59:17] to them that walk in christ jesus who
[59:19] walk not after the flesh
[59:21] but after the spirit
[59:24] when that woman answered that question
[59:25] who knows what was going on in her heart
[59:28] but she was destined to be stoned she
[59:30] was finished she was judged her life was
[59:33] over everything was finished and in a
[59:35] few moments time the whole situation
[59:38] changed and when she looked up and said
[59:39] were your accusers they were gone
[59:42] i said i have none
[59:43] they looked at the one man that was left
[59:45] standing there he said neither do i
[59:47] accuse you
[59:49] she ran from there free
[59:51] totally free
[59:53] what a question
[59:56] there's another question in matthew 16
[59:58] that we're very familiar with let's turn
[1:00:00] there and look at this question
[1:00:07] matthew 16
[1:00:10] and we'll begin at verse 13.
[1:00:22] matthew 16
[1:00:23] and 13.
[1:00:26] when jesus came into the coast
[1:00:29] of caesarea philippi he asked his
[1:00:31] disciples saying whom do men say that i
[1:00:33] the son of man am
[1:00:35] and they said some say that thou art
[1:00:36] john the baptist some elias and others
[1:00:39] jeremiah or one of the prophets
[1:00:41] and he sayeth unto them but whom
[1:00:44] say ye
[1:00:45] that i am
[1:00:47] jesus was asking them
[1:00:49] whom do men say that i the son of man he
[1:00:52] wants to know if they know who the son
[1:00:54] of man is
[1:00:56] the question is about the son of man
[1:00:58] because this question can be repeated in
[1:01:00] our day
[1:01:02] he said do you whom do men
[1:01:05] say that i the son of manham and we can
[1:01:07] answer that they'll say oh some believe
[1:01:09] it's a prophet
[1:01:10] william branham some believes it's a
[1:01:12] hoax and some believes it's this and
[1:01:13] some believes it's future tense some
[1:01:15] believes it's past tense
[1:01:18] those are the answers that we could give
[1:01:20] them if he come and ask you say whom do
[1:01:22] men say that i the son of man am in this
[1:01:24] end time and some will say well they
[1:01:26] some some men say you were william
[1:01:28] branham and and working in him and some
[1:01:30] men say you were past and some men say
[1:01:32] your future and some men say or this and
[1:01:34] some men say you're that but jesus now
[1:01:36] is going to go to the next level of
[1:01:38] questioning he says who do you say that
[1:01:41] i am
[1:01:43] the question is about the son of man
[1:01:47] who do you say
[1:01:49] that i that i am
[1:01:51] but whom say ye that i am and simon
[1:01:54] peter answered and said thou art the
[1:01:55] christ the son of the living god and
[1:01:57] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:01:59] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[1:02:01] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[1:02:03] my father which is in heaven and i say
[1:02:06] also unto thee that thou art peter and
[1:02:08] upon this rock will i build my church
[1:02:10] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:02:12] against it the prophet of god says it's
[1:02:14] the revelation of jesus christ amen that
[1:02:17] the church was built upon and at a
[1:02:19] present tense revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:21] of who he is now
[1:02:24] that the church is built upon
[1:02:26] brother branham says in the message the
[1:02:28] anointed ones at the end time says now i
[1:02:30] want you to know this is sure and you
[1:02:33] that listen to this tape you might have
[1:02:35] thought today that i was trying to say
[1:02:36] that about myself being that i was
[1:02:38] packing this message
[1:02:39] i have no more to do with it than
[1:02:41] nothing no more than just a voice and my
[1:02:43] voice even against my better judgment i
[1:02:46] wanted to be a trapper but it's the will
[1:02:47] of my father that i declared to do and
[1:02:49] determined to do i wasn't the one that
[1:02:52] appeared down on the river i was only
[1:02:53] standing there when he appeared i'm not
[1:02:55] the one that performs these things and
[1:02:57] foretells these things that's happened
[1:02:58] as perfect they are i'm only one that's
[1:03:01] near when he does him i was only a voice
[1:03:03] that he used to say it it wasn't what i
[1:03:05] knew is what i just surrendered myself
[1:03:07] to that he spoke through it isn't me
[1:03:11] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:03:13] the manifestation of the son of man it
[1:03:16] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:03:18] mystery that god unfolded it's not a man
[1:03:21] it's god the angel was not the son of
[1:03:23] man he was the messenger from the son of
[1:03:25] man the son of man is christ he's the
[1:03:28] one that you're feeding on you're not
[1:03:31] feeding on a man a man his words will
[1:03:33] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:03:35] body word of the son of man
[1:03:38] who is who do men say that i the son of
[1:03:41] man am oh oh they said that you were the
[1:03:44] the seventh angel the seventh prophet
[1:03:46] you were there in brother branham that's
[1:03:48] true but what about today
[1:03:51] well they say that was a manifestation
[1:03:53] that took place but that's a
[1:03:54] manifestation that will take place but
[1:03:56] who do you say this is a question i'd
[1:03:58] like to ask today who do you say that he
[1:04:01] is today present tense who do you say
[1:04:03] the son of man is
[1:04:05] something that's happened something that
[1:04:07] will happen or something that's
[1:04:09] happening amen a manifestation of jesus
[1:04:11] christ present tense today because
[1:04:14] that's the rock that the church has
[1:04:15] built upon the revelation of jesus
[1:04:17] christ
[1:04:19] we can get all kinds of answers to this
[1:04:21] question but there's really only one
[1:04:23] answer that matters amen and if you're
[1:04:25] still depending on what everybody else
[1:04:27] is saying about the son of man jesus is
[1:04:29] going to take it a notch higher for you
[1:04:31] personally this morning you may say well
[1:04:33] my pastor says this and all the brothers
[1:04:35] here and our church believes but over
[1:04:36] there they believe it and back here they
[1:04:38] believe in i had a grandpa who believed
[1:04:40] that oh whatever it doesn't matter
[1:04:42] anymore when anybody else says because
[1:04:44] he asked that question first to bring
[1:04:46] you to the second question
[1:04:49] are you going to follow what everybody
[1:04:51] else says or are you going to have your
[1:04:52] own individual revelation of who i am
[1:04:57] the same question applied then applies
[1:05:00] today
[1:05:02] and let me amen stand in this office
[1:05:05] behind this pulpit and ask you the
[1:05:06] question who do you say this is
[1:05:12] i'm not talking future tense i'm not
[1:05:15] talking past tense i'm talking eternal
[1:05:18] present tense
[1:05:20] who do you say this is
[1:05:22] brother bam says in god's provided place
[1:05:24] of worship
[1:05:26] but he promised just before the coming
[1:05:28] of the end time the world would get like
[1:05:30] it was in sodom when a man come down and
[1:05:32] human form three of them two angels and
[1:05:34] god himself that was god the bible said
[1:05:37] it was now he come down and he
[1:05:39] manifested himself there by turning us
[1:05:41] back to the tent where sarah was and
[1:05:43] told abraham what sarah was thinking in
[1:05:46] the tent that right
[1:05:47] now jesus himself said at the day when
[1:05:50] the son of man is being revealed in
[1:05:52] other words the son of man the ministry
[1:05:54] of jesus christ himself
[1:05:57] so what is the son of man the ministry
[1:05:59] of jesus christ himself
[1:06:02] the church will come through
[1:06:03] justification through luther through
[1:06:05] sanctification through wesley through
[1:06:07] the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[1:06:08] pentecostals and go right on into the
[1:06:10] perfection of the son of man
[1:06:13] that when the husband and wife will be
[1:06:15] the same
[1:06:17] persons
[1:06:20] who do you say this is
[1:06:26] when i want to read that to you again
[1:06:29] after you've gone through luther wesley
[1:06:31] the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[1:06:33] pentecostals and go right on in there's
[1:06:36] something beyond all of that
[1:06:39] all of that was building amen
[1:06:41] justification made a way for
[1:06:42] sanctification it's a building
[1:06:44] sanctification made a way for the
[1:06:45] baptist's holy ghost it's a building the
[1:06:47] baptism of the holy ghost made a way for
[1:06:49] the person of the holy ghost himself
[1:06:52] which is the son of man
[1:06:55] he said now
[1:06:57] the pinnacles go right on into
[1:06:58] perfection of the son of man when that
[1:07:02] what is the perfection of the son of man
[1:07:04] when husband and wife will be the same
[1:07:07] self persons
[1:07:09] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:07:12] his church that they will both be the
[1:07:14] same they are one now you see where
[1:07:17] we're at
[1:07:18] my question is now do you see where
[1:07:21] we're at
[1:07:22] not what we're going to where are we at
[1:07:24] amen who do you say this is amen jesus
[1:07:28] is calling now who do you say i the son
[1:07:30] of man am amen what am i am i just a
[1:07:33] manifestation that took place in the 50s
[1:07:35] and 60s what am i amen it's it's it's
[1:07:38] husband the perfection of the son of man
[1:07:41] coming down when husband and wife become
[1:07:43] the same self persons
[1:07:49] but others don't teach it that way
[1:07:50] that's not the question
[1:07:54] but there's other reputable men who have
[1:07:56] a long time in the ministry and and we
[1:07:58] really have confidence in them they
[1:07:59] don't teach it that way that's not the
[1:08:02] question
[1:08:03] that was the first question not the
[1:08:05] second question
[1:08:08] but that's not how we understood it 10
[1:08:10] years ago that's not the question
[1:08:14] let god ask you the question this
[1:08:16] morning
[1:08:18] who do men say that i am
[1:08:21] fair game say what all you've heard
[1:08:25] then he takes it up a notch
[1:08:27] but whom do ye say that i am
[1:08:30] now it doesn't matter anymore who says
[1:08:33] what
[1:08:34] it doesn't matter what your daddy or
[1:08:36] mommy says your husband your wife it
[1:08:38] doesn't matter what your pastor and none
[1:08:39] of that matters now in this question
[1:08:41] there's one question put to you today
[1:08:43] and if you've never saw yourself in the
[1:08:45] scriptures you're standing in the
[1:08:46] scriptures this morning you're in
[1:08:47] matthew 16. amen and there's a gift from
[1:08:50] god speaking to you saying who do you
[1:08:52] say this is you have to answer the
[1:08:54] question
[1:08:56] nobody is getting around this question
[1:08:58] in this day this is the question
[1:09:01] who do you say this is
[1:09:06] say if you can't answer the question be
[1:09:08] honest
[1:09:09] say god
[1:09:11] i need you to give me a revelation to
[1:09:12] answer that question
[1:09:14] i can only answer the first question i
[1:09:16] can't answer the second question
[1:09:19] be honest don't make it up don't pretend
[1:09:22] don't parrot somebody after the first
[1:09:24] question some say jeremiah some say a
[1:09:26] lie some say william branham some say a
[1:09:28] future manifest some say
[1:09:31] don't repeat that in the second question
[1:09:34] and the second question
[1:09:36] say if you cannot answer from your heart
[1:09:39] say god i can't answer that from my
[1:09:42] heart i need a revelation that comes
[1:09:43] from the father because when peter gave
[1:09:45] the answer amen jesus says flesh and
[1:09:48] blood never revealed that to you you
[1:09:50] didn't get it by what other people were
[1:09:51] saying or what history had told you or
[1:09:53] what you were brought up and or any of
[1:09:55] these other things you got that from god
[1:09:59] and that's the only way that we can
[1:10:01] answer the second question
[1:10:09] god
[1:10:11] see
[1:10:15] these things are real
[1:10:18] if i could express what's in my heart
[1:10:21] this isn't church
[1:10:23] this isn't church
[1:10:25] this is life
[1:10:28] you're sitting in a building you're
[1:10:30] gathered together with a group of
[1:10:31] believers but this is not about church
[1:10:34] it's not about answering a question to
[1:10:35] please somebody in these walls or
[1:10:37] satisfy your neighbor this is life
[1:10:39] friends this is the only life this is
[1:10:41] real life this is all that matters in
[1:10:43] life right now
[1:10:47] and we keep
[1:10:48] ignoring the question kicking the can
[1:10:50] down the road or whatever we're doing
[1:10:52] but it's time to say the question's been
[1:10:54] put to me and if you've never had it put
[1:10:56] to you i'm putting it to you this
[1:10:57] morning who do you say this is the son
[1:10:59] of man ministry
[1:11:01] who do you say it is and where is it
[1:11:04] did it end
[1:11:05] in 1965 does it continue if it continues
[1:11:08] where does it continue does it continue
[1:11:09] in a mystical myth form does it continue
[1:11:11] on books and tapes
[1:11:14] where did the prophet say it continued
[1:11:15] after the union that the manifestation
[1:11:17] of the son of man came to unite the head
[1:11:19] and the body together to do what to
[1:11:21] manifest the son to reveal the son of
[1:11:23] man
[1:11:24] again go to the message stop listening
[1:11:28] to what everybody else is saying
[1:11:30] this is time to shut off all the other
[1:11:32] voices of what everybody else is saying
[1:11:34] and it's time to get into the message
[1:11:36] and say god i need a revelation what did
[1:11:38] this prophet say somebody put together
[1:11:41] quotes here somebody's put together
[1:11:42] quotes over here this one's arguing with
[1:11:44] this one i i can't deal with it i gotta
[1:11:46] know for myself don't just be lazy if
[1:11:49] you're gonna take that stand then you
[1:11:51] get into the tapes go back and read your
[1:11:52] church age book go back to the seals
[1:11:54] again go listen to every message from
[1:11:56] the seals on and read the book until god
[1:11:58] reveals to you don't be lazy about it
[1:12:01] and say well you know if god wants me to
[1:12:03] know all know now he's putting the
[1:12:04] question to you if you can't answer it
[1:12:06] get the answer the answer is in the
[1:12:08] message
[1:12:12] god didn't give us the message they
[1:12:13] meant to be a cute sd card shoved into
[1:12:15] the back of our phone
[1:12:19] he gave us the message to reveal himself
[1:12:21] and reveal the hour we live in and
[1:12:23] what's going on right now
[1:12:28] so i'm asking the question
[1:12:31] who do you say this is
[1:12:34] all that we're talking about and all
[1:12:35] we're doing and gathering together
[1:12:38] sunday and wednesday listening to tapes
[1:12:40] and reading who do you say this is what
[1:12:42] is it all about
[1:12:44] is it a church that's a little bit
[1:12:46] better than the pentecostal church we've
[1:12:47] got everything finnick also had plus a
[1:12:49] little bit more now we're a correct
[1:12:51] order church it's more than that friends
[1:12:56] that's not the revelation that he
[1:12:57] brought this prophet to bring to us in
[1:12:59] this day
[1:13:02] the question's been put to you this
[1:13:03] morning
[1:13:04] don't ignore it
[1:13:06] the question has been put to you this
[1:13:08] morning don't act like you didn't hear
[1:13:09] it
[1:13:11] god knows you heard it
[1:13:14] who do you say this is
[1:13:17] answer the question
[1:13:19] if you can't answer the question that's
[1:13:21] a fair answer
[1:13:23] that's an honest answer
[1:13:25] said god right now i can't honestly
[1:13:28] answer that question
[1:13:30] god i'm going to dig into the message
[1:13:32] you gave me
[1:13:36] see sometimes friends we say
[1:13:39] well i'm just waiting for god to reveal
[1:13:41] it to me but you're waiting for god to
[1:13:43] reveal it to you but you're not getting
[1:13:44] into the word
[1:13:47] you're not reading your bible you're not
[1:13:48] listening to the message but you're
[1:13:50] saying i want god to reveal it to you
[1:13:51] and you're cutting off the very
[1:13:53] mechanism by which he brings the
[1:13:54] revelation
[1:13:56] he brought it through a prophet in this
[1:13:57] day
[1:14:00] if you want to answer the question and
[1:14:01] you need god to reveal it to you
[1:14:04] get in the tapes
[1:14:06] read the books stay in your bible stay
[1:14:08] in prayer and if you've got an honest
[1:14:10] heart god will reveal himself to you
[1:14:12] he's no respecter of persons he didn't
[1:14:14] do for peter anything different than
[1:14:16] he'll do for you
[1:14:20] i think that's much of our problem in
[1:14:22] this days we never ask to answer the
[1:14:24] question
[1:14:25] i think a lot of the problem that we
[1:14:27] have in our churches and what's called
[1:14:29] the message around the world is we have
[1:14:31] people who've been able to answer the
[1:14:32] first question but not the second
[1:14:34] question
[1:14:37] when they answer the first question
[1:14:39] they find the part of the first question
[1:14:41] that seems most plausible to them or the
[1:14:44] person who's most reputable to them and
[1:14:45] they go along with that person
[1:14:50] but they've never answered the second
[1:14:52] question
[1:14:53] who do you say this is and they're
[1:14:56] hoping because somebody else says it's
[1:14:58] this and somebody else says that that if
[1:15:00] they get in i'll get in too
[1:15:03] it doesn't work that way
[1:15:06] that may not have been what was on
[1:15:08] somebody's conscience but that's what's
[1:15:09] been laying in the subconscious
[1:15:12] somebody's been just hoping that because
[1:15:14] i find the most reputable minister in
[1:15:16] the message or i find the one with the
[1:15:18] with the seemingly the one that i agree
[1:15:20] with or suits me the best and he says it
[1:15:23] he's got the revelation and i'm going
[1:15:24] along with that
[1:15:27] and we take a lazy approach to this
[1:15:29] because we say there's so many voices
[1:15:30] it's so confusing
[1:15:34] that's what matthew 16 says
[1:15:37] he asked who do men say they are and it
[1:15:39] was confusing some say jeremiah's
[1:15:41] some say elias some say one of the other
[1:15:44] prophets it's confusing
[1:15:47] and they could say it's so confusing i
[1:15:49] can't sort it out i just throw in the
[1:15:51] towel
[1:15:53] but he asked the second question who do
[1:15:55] you say that i am and peter had caught a
[1:15:57] revelation from god almighty and that
[1:15:59] revelation told him exactly who this was
[1:16:05] if we could all get to that place
[1:16:09] so much of our problems would go away
[1:16:14] if we could all dig if we could all pray
[1:16:16] if we could all fast and be sincere with
[1:16:19] god until we get to where we can answer
[1:16:21] the second question then most of our
[1:16:23] problems would go away
[1:16:30] we need to answer
[1:16:32] both questions
[1:16:35] let's go to mark chapter 4.
[1:16:59] mark chapter 4
[1:17:01] verse 37.
[1:17:07] and there arose a great storm of wind
[1:17:09] and the waves beat them to the ship
[1:17:11] so that it was now full
[1:17:13] i told you before there's no rhyme or
[1:17:14] reason this i'm just giving it free flow
[1:17:17] the way it's come to me
[1:17:20] and he was in the hinder part of the
[1:17:22] ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke
[1:17:24] him and say unto him master cares thou
[1:17:26] not that we perish
[1:17:29] look at their question
[1:17:30] let's stop right here
[1:17:32] what kind of question is that
[1:17:36] to ask god in flesh
[1:17:39] the same kind of question you and i say
[1:17:41] every time a hard trial god don't you
[1:17:44] see what's happening
[1:17:47] god don't you understand i'm dying
[1:17:52] i don't think it's a good question
[1:17:54] i don't think it's the right way to
[1:17:55] phrase the question
[1:17:58] he says
[1:17:59] carest thou not that we perish and he
[1:18:02] arose and rebuked the wind and said unto
[1:18:04] the sea peace be still
[1:18:06] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:18:07] great calm
[1:18:08] and he said unto them why are you so
[1:18:11] fearful
[1:18:13] and how is it that you have no faith
[1:18:17] he asked a question
[1:18:18] and none of them answered
[1:18:21] and it was pretty good that they didn't
[1:18:23] answer
[1:18:24] i say this is one of those questions you
[1:18:26] don't you just don't open your mouth
[1:18:30] lord
[1:18:31] he's in the ship and brother baby said
[1:18:33] that's the type of the church today he's
[1:18:35] in the ship
[1:18:37] he's with us he's here and storms come
[1:18:41] storms will come storms have come storms
[1:18:43] are coming
[1:18:45] brother brennan says
[1:18:47] he says the stabilizers have been put on
[1:18:49] the ship
[1:18:51] why do you put stabilizers on the ship
[1:18:54] because big storm waves are coming
[1:18:57] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:18:59] ship but shall crest every wave
[1:19:03] so there's prophecy that storms are
[1:19:05] coming and and now the storm comes and
[1:19:08] when the storm comes they forget that
[1:19:11] they're with a man
[1:19:12] who can multiply bread and fish
[1:19:15] they forget that they're with a man who
[1:19:17] could open blinded eyes they forget they
[1:19:20] listen the next storm that comes they
[1:19:22] forget that there's a man in our midst a
[1:19:24] man who can turn on the light that can
[1:19:26] heal joe from a lesion on his roof they
[1:19:28] forget the next storm that comes they
[1:19:30] forget that there was somebody here that
[1:19:32] could heal bernie for five years of
[1:19:34] constant pain
[1:19:36] but the next trial that comes are saying
[1:19:38] lord don't you see don't you care and
[1:19:40] they say wake up how is it that you're
[1:19:42] afraid do you forget the loaves in the
[1:19:44] face did you forget the blind man did
[1:19:46] you forget
[1:19:47] have you forgotten amen what we talked
[1:19:50] about at the beginning of service when
[1:19:52] the testimonies have read of the
[1:19:53] multiple healings and deliverance and
[1:19:56] amen and all the provisions that god
[1:19:58] make for us how is it when we go from
[1:19:59] the from the prayer from the testimony
[1:20:02] to the prayer request from the time we
[1:20:03] read the end of the testimony till we
[1:20:06] start the prayer request we become
[1:20:07] fearful
[1:20:14] is he on the boat
[1:20:16] is he in our midst
[1:20:19] is the son of man here
[1:20:24] has he healed
[1:20:26] has he delivered
[1:20:28] has he healed supernaturally
[1:20:31] over and over and over again
[1:20:35] if that's the case the next time your
[1:20:37] boat's swamped and your sails are torn
[1:20:39] and the mast is broke you have no right
[1:20:43] to get scared
[1:20:46] brother i'm just saying what jesus said
[1:20:48] i'm not listen i'm with you
[1:20:52] i'm the same one who has to say
[1:20:54] it's okay i'm not scared it's okay i'm
[1:20:56] not scared
[1:20:59] the outer man
[1:21:01] amen has to be brought into subjection
[1:21:02] to the inner man the other man begins to
[1:21:05] get nervous and begins to ring their
[1:21:07] hands and because they know house is
[1:21:08] going to work out but the inner man the
[1:21:10] faith seat has to rise up and say he's
[1:21:12] done it before he'll do it again it's
[1:21:15] promised in his word he's here with me
[1:21:17] i'm not alone he's watching over me
[1:21:19] there's nothing for me to be afraid of
[1:21:22] so i think jesus question is a valid
[1:21:25] question and i want to ask it this
[1:21:27] morning for whatever situation you're in
[1:21:29] whether it's family situations health
[1:21:31] situation financial situation if you're
[1:21:33] nervous about the political situation or
[1:21:35] the country situation i want to ask you
[1:21:37] this question
[1:21:39] why are you so fearful
[1:21:42] how is it that you have no faith
[1:21:50] it's a good question
[1:21:53] that's a question that hits me right
[1:21:55] between the eyes
[1:21:57] why are you so fearful
[1:22:00] why
[1:22:01] why
[1:22:02] immediately
[1:22:05] when your child's 10 minutes late
[1:22:07] getting home
[1:22:08] you immediately think of sirens and
[1:22:10] lights and hospital beds and
[1:22:15] why can't you see a picture
[1:22:17] of angels encompassing around their
[1:22:19] vehicle
[1:22:21] bringing them safely home
[1:22:25] who gives that thought of the ambulance
[1:22:28] in the hospital bed where does that come
[1:22:30] from
[1:22:33] that's the one that needs to be rejected
[1:22:34] you say but it's natural for a mother to
[1:22:36] do that jesus didn't think so
[1:22:41] jesus thought a believer it's natural of
[1:22:43] course it's natural but we're not
[1:22:44] natural beings we're supernatural beings
[1:22:47] we've been born again we've been
[1:22:48] awakened to the reality all around us we
[1:22:50] know we have a heavenly father who
[1:22:52] watches over us we know that he hears us
[1:22:54] when we pray we know that our footsteps
[1:22:56] are ordered
[1:22:58] we know that no trial comes unless it
[1:23:00] first crossed god's desk
[1:23:04] so why are we so fearful
[1:23:08] i say god help us
[1:23:10] forgive us
[1:23:12] for being so quick to forget what you've
[1:23:14] done
[1:23:16] forgive us
[1:23:17] to be so quick to forget how
[1:23:20] supernaturally you've delivered us
[1:23:23] guided us
[1:23:24] freed us
[1:23:26] healed us spoke to us
[1:23:29] you name it he's done it
[1:23:32] forgive us lord
[1:23:33] help us to have faith
[1:23:35] help us to believe
[1:23:38] when the world is falling apart help us
[1:23:40] to believe
[1:23:43] when everything is coming undone and the
[1:23:45] waves are crashing over help us to not
[1:23:48] take that spirit of fear because fear is
[1:23:50] a spirit
[1:23:53] help us not take that spirit of fear but
[1:23:55] help us to remember who's in the boat
[1:23:59] and the one that's laying in the boat is
[1:24:01] the one that supernaturally healed joe
[1:24:05] he's the one who delivered me
[1:24:07] the one who delivered brother bernie
[1:24:09] he's the one who delivered you and he's
[1:24:11] the one who saved you he's the one who
[1:24:12] brought you to the message he's the one
[1:24:14] who opened your eyes he's the one who
[1:24:15] saved your children he's the one he's
[1:24:17] the same one and he's still here
[1:24:21] this is a good question this morning
[1:24:24] i want to ask you the question this
[1:24:25] morning
[1:24:26] why are you so fearful
[1:24:29] i said before this might apply to one
[1:24:31] tenth of a percent of the congregation
[1:24:34] but why are you so fearful it applies to
[1:24:36] you ask yourself the question why am i
[1:24:38] so fearful
[1:24:40] why
[1:24:41] am i so fearful and why am i always so
[1:24:44] sure that everything's going to go wrong
[1:24:49] why shouldn't i have faith in god that
[1:24:51] everything's going to work out perfect
[1:24:53] the way he wants it to work out and all
[1:24:55] things are working together for good
[1:25:01] let's go to luke 24.
[1:25:11] luke 24 13.
[1:25:19] and behold two of them went that same
[1:25:21] day to a village called emmaus which was
[1:25:23] from jerusalem about three score
[1:25:25] furlongs
[1:25:26] and they talked together of all these
[1:25:28] things which had happened and it came to
[1:25:30] pass that while they communed together
[1:25:32] and reasoned jesus himself drew near and
[1:25:35] went with them
[1:25:37] and their eyes were holding that they
[1:25:39] should not know him and mark it says he
[1:25:41] appeared to them in another form
[1:25:44] here comes jesus in flesh in their day
[1:25:47] the resurrected ministry of jesus christ
[1:25:49] he draws along these two disciples amen
[1:25:52] but they don't know him they don't
[1:25:53] recognize him he's appearing in another
[1:25:55] form
[1:25:56] or 17. and he said unto them what manner
[1:25:59] of communications are these that you
[1:26:01] have one to another
[1:26:03] as you walk and are sad
[1:26:06] okay i'll just repeat what i repeated
[1:26:08] before did he need the information
[1:26:12] he wanted them to declare out of their
[1:26:15] mouth where they were
[1:26:18] and the one of them whose name was
[1:26:20] cleopas answered and said unto him art
[1:26:22] thou only a stranger in jerusalem and
[1:26:24] has not known the thing which have come
[1:26:26] to pass there in these days he was
[1:26:28] speaking to the king of jerusalem
[1:26:30] and asking if he was a stranger in
[1:26:32] jerusalem
[1:26:34] and he said unto them what things
[1:26:37] [Laughter]
[1:26:39] you have to love the bible friends
[1:26:43] what things
[1:26:45] you know
[1:26:46] it would be amazing to have this
[1:26:48] dialogue with god
[1:26:49] and you're praying in your prayer
[1:26:50] everything that's going wrong in your
[1:26:52] life oh god you know that the the
[1:26:54] neighbor has done this and work's done
[1:26:56] this and the children done this and god
[1:26:58] it's so bad and everything's so terrible
[1:27:01] and i got so many problems and god says
[1:27:04] what problems
[1:27:06] well it's this one and this one and this
[1:27:08] one and
[1:27:09] what problems
[1:27:11] what things
[1:27:14] and as you begin to express them you
[1:27:15] realize who you're talking to
[1:27:18] he already knows
[1:27:20] he knows how to fix him he knows a
[1:27:21] solution he knows what you're going
[1:27:23] through and he knows how to deliver you
[1:27:24] he's just waiting for you to have enough
[1:27:25] faith to believe that'll take care of
[1:27:27] every one of those problems
[1:27:32] and he says
[1:27:33] and he said unto them what things and
[1:27:35] they said in them concerning jesus of
[1:27:37] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[1:27:38] indeed in word before god and all the
[1:27:41] people
[1:27:42] and how the chief priest and our ruler
[1:27:43] delivered him to the to be condemned to
[1:27:46] death and have crucified him but we
[1:27:48] trusted
[1:27:51] they used to believe
[1:27:54] they were trusting
[1:27:56] they're not trusting anymore we trust
[1:27:59] did here's the problem this is why he
[1:28:02] asked them the question he wanted them
[1:28:03] to expose where they were
[1:28:05] and in his explanation they begins to
[1:28:07] expose right where they're at but we had
[1:28:10] trusted now we're disappointed what we
[1:28:12] believe didn't come to pass amen when i
[1:28:14] were confused and we had trusted it had
[1:28:16] been him
[1:28:18] and he says
[1:28:20] but we trusted that it had been he which
[1:28:23] would have redeemed israel beside all
[1:28:25] this today is the third day since these
[1:28:27] things were done
[1:28:28] yea and certain women also of our
[1:28:30] company made us astonish which were
[1:28:31] early at the sepulcher and when they
[1:28:33] found nada's body they came saying that
[1:28:36] they had seen a vision of angels which
[1:28:39] said that he was alive and certain of
[1:28:41] them which were with us went to the
[1:28:42] sepulcher and found it even so as the
[1:28:44] women had said but him they saw not
[1:28:48] listen listen
[1:28:50] listen
[1:28:52] they have all the information they need
[1:28:54] to believe
[1:28:58] they're speaking the truth but not
[1:29:00] catching the reality
[1:29:03] and i say that's what we've been doing
[1:29:05] in the message for years we've been
[1:29:06] speaking all the facts and all that and
[1:29:08] not missing how they all go together
[1:29:10] amen they're saying we believed it was
[1:29:11] him that would redeem us he was
[1:29:13] redeeming them on calvary
[1:29:15] he said some of the women went to the
[1:29:17] sepulcher and saw vision of angels they
[1:29:18] didn't see a vision of angels they saw
[1:29:19] angels
[1:29:21] and the angels told him that he's not
[1:29:23] here he's risen and then some of our
[1:29:25] company went to the deceptor and they
[1:29:27] see it even as they had said
[1:29:30] then watch your problem
[1:29:33] that's the next question what's the
[1:29:35] problem
[1:29:38] i mean
[1:29:39] brother branham said that this mighty
[1:29:41] angel would descend and that with a
[1:29:43] clothe with a cloud with a rainbow over
[1:29:45] his head with an open book in his hand
[1:29:46] this angel will descend which is nothing
[1:29:48] more than christ amen and the seventh
[1:29:51] church age messenger will be here at the
[1:29:53] time of this coming
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:58] we thought we thought the coming of the
[1:30:00] lord's going to happen when the prophet
[1:30:01] was here you've got all the facts you've
[1:30:03] got all the facts what's the problem
[1:30:05] there is no problem
[1:30:08] you're saying it but you're not
[1:30:10] realizing what you're saying
[1:30:14] they were saying it they had the truth
[1:30:16] and they were stumbling over the
[1:30:18] manifestation of the hour
[1:30:21] because it didn't fit what they had
[1:30:23] already computed amen they had already
[1:30:25] analyzed and computed and had an idea of
[1:30:28] how the prophecy would be fulfilled and
[1:30:30] when it took a turn and went differently
[1:30:32] than what they expected now all of a
[1:30:34] sudden they're confused and there's
[1:30:36] nothing to be confused about the women
[1:30:38] saw an angel the angel said he's not
[1:30:39] here he's risen brothers went and
[1:30:41] confirmed what they said was the truth
[1:30:43] what's the problem
[1:30:47] the mighty angel did descend christ
[1:30:50] his coming did take place at the time
[1:30:52] the seventh church age messenger was on
[1:30:54] earth
[1:30:56] there was a manifestation of the son of
[1:30:58] man and there is a son of man ministry
[1:31:00] currently going on
[1:31:03] there's no problem there's nothing to be
[1:31:06] disheartened about there's no reason to
[1:31:08] have trusted keep believing amen
[1:31:10] everything is ticking just right on time
[1:31:12] it's all perfect
[1:31:18] they they come and they they they
[1:31:20] they're they're testifying to him of the
[1:31:23] truth
[1:31:25] everything they're saying fits
[1:31:27] everything he said
[1:31:32] what they're what they're speaking as a
[1:31:34] problem is the confirmation of what he's
[1:31:36] already said
[1:31:39] it's the evidence that he told the truth
[1:31:42] and they're speaking the things that
[1:31:44] they think are problems not realizing
[1:31:46] it's no problem it's a confirmation of
[1:31:48] what he already said
[1:31:51] i hope you have your spiritual jackets
[1:31:53] on
[1:31:58] said certain of them verse 24 again
[1:32:00] which were with us went to the sepulcher
[1:32:02] and found it even so as the women had
[1:32:04] said but him they saw not then he said
[1:32:07] unto them o fools
[1:32:09] and slow heart to believe all
[1:32:11] that the prophets have spoken
[1:32:14] you believed but you didn't believe all
[1:32:17] you caught a part of it and you ran off
[1:32:18] and painted your own picture but you
[1:32:20] didn't catch it all
[1:32:22] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:32:24] things and to have entered into his
[1:32:26] glory and beginning at moses and all the
[1:32:28] prophets he expounded into them all the
[1:32:30] scriptures the things concerning himself
[1:32:35] what a question
[1:32:37] what are you talking about as you go
[1:32:38] along and are so sad
[1:32:42] why
[1:32:44] yeah i'll put it this way
[1:32:48] why are the message believers after the
[1:32:50] fulfillment of the promise so
[1:32:51] down-hearted
[1:32:56] why are you so sad
[1:32:59] don't you know
[1:33:01] we're in a holding period
[1:33:05] waiting
[1:33:07] waiting for what
[1:33:09] but we thought this and this and this
[1:33:11] needs to happen
[1:33:13] everything you're talking about fits the
[1:33:15] prophecy
[1:33:17] you're not waiting
[1:33:19] start walking
[1:33:21] get caught up
[1:33:23] get resurrected out of dead
[1:33:24] denominationalism and denominational
[1:33:26] thinking and get lifted up into the mind
[1:33:28] of christ
[1:33:30] to see all things are being fulfilled
[1:33:37] let's go to john chapter 20.
[1:33:39] we'll end with this one
[1:33:41] john chapter 20.
[1:33:49] verse 14.
[1:33:55] john 20
[1:33:57] and 14.
[1:34:01] and when she had thus turned herself
[1:34:03] back and saw jesus standing
[1:34:06] and knew not that it was jesus this was
[1:34:07] mary
[1:34:09] and knew not that it was jesus
[1:34:11] jesus saith unto her woman why weepest
[1:34:13] thou
[1:34:15] whom seek us thou
[1:34:17] she's supposing him to be the gardener
[1:34:19] saith unto him sir
[1:34:21] if thou have borne him hence tell me
[1:34:23] where thou has laid him and i will take
[1:34:25] him away
[1:34:26] jesus said in her mary
[1:34:29] she turned herself and saith in him
[1:34:30] rabboni which is to say
[1:34:32] master
[1:34:34] jesus asked another good question
[1:34:37] he asked a question that at the grave
[1:34:39] there's an empty tomb now and
[1:34:41] mary is distraught because they've taken
[1:34:43] the she supposes taking the lord's body
[1:34:46] here comes a gardener
[1:34:49] a gardener's like a husbandman kind of
[1:34:51] like a preacher
[1:34:52] like a pastor
[1:34:54] and he shows up as the gardener
[1:34:57] and he says to her
[1:35:00] why are you weeping
[1:35:02] who are you looking for
[1:35:05] whom seek us thou
[1:35:09] and the one that she was looking for was
[1:35:11] standing there speaking to her
[1:35:14] but she didn't recognize him because he
[1:35:16] was in another form now
[1:35:18] he was resurrected in his resurrection
[1:35:20] he's always coming in another form
[1:35:25] now he's resurrected and coming to her
[1:35:26] in another form and she's supposing to
[1:35:29] him to be the gardener it's just it's
[1:35:31] not like he's not got a you know
[1:35:34] some disguise on she knew him intimately
[1:35:37] she saw him day by day
[1:35:40] he's appearing in another form
[1:35:44] and he says why are you crying
[1:35:47] this should be the hour of rejoicing
[1:35:50] why are you crying
[1:35:53] who are you looking for
[1:35:56] who are you looking for
[1:36:01] i'm looking for the lord
[1:36:04] i'm looking for where they laid him i'm
[1:36:05] looking for a past tense jesus
[1:36:11] i went to where he was last and i can't
[1:36:13] find him where is he
[1:36:15] where have you taken him
[1:36:17] where can i go and where can i find him
[1:36:21] and here he was in his resurrection
[1:36:22] ministry in another form speaking to her
[1:36:27] he didn't say here i am here i am
[1:36:31] he called her by name
[1:36:34] he called mary
[1:36:36] and when he called mary she recognized
[1:36:39] who it was she said rabboni which means
[1:36:41] master
[1:36:43] see in this hour
[1:36:45] we could be mourning
[1:36:47] over what had taken place
[1:36:51] mourning
[1:36:53] mourning the fact that
[1:36:55] you know
[1:36:56] all the the dynamic ministry of the
[1:36:58] prophet it's ended
[1:37:01] i mean that was jesus christ in that man
[1:37:05] oh
[1:37:06] i wish he was here i wish
[1:37:09] listen he's here
[1:37:12] nothing's changed
[1:37:14] he's in another form
[1:37:20] i just wish i could
[1:37:22] where's his body
[1:37:24] oh even
[1:37:25] i'll even stay with the dead body
[1:37:29] because i don't know where else to go
[1:37:33] i'll go back to the previous
[1:37:36] brother branham said that previous
[1:37:39] part of the stalk as it comes up to
[1:37:41] stalk the toss so everything after the
[1:37:43] seed has to die everything previous has
[1:37:45] to die be dead
[1:37:48] and she's she doesn't know where to go
[1:37:51] so she's willing to go back to the dead
[1:37:55] but jesus is always life not death he's
[1:37:58] always moving with the life
[1:38:01] and here he was alive resurrected
[1:38:04] standing talking to her but she didn't
[1:38:06] expect him in a different form
[1:38:09] in fact she didn't expect him alive at
[1:38:11] all
[1:38:13] she expected him in that ministry and
[1:38:15] that ministry is now over we saw him in
[1:38:17] that ministry now that ministry's over
[1:38:19] that ministry is dead and now we're
[1:38:21] going to take care of the body and and
[1:38:22] maybe whitewash the tomb and paint some
[1:38:24] things around it and wait for something
[1:38:26] else to happen we don't know what
[1:38:28] and mourn that that's over
[1:38:31] because she she didn't know what to look
[1:38:33] for she didn't know what she was
[1:38:35] supposed to see she had missed the
[1:38:37] things that he was saying and now he's
[1:38:38] standing there talking to her in another
[1:38:40] form jesus himself not another jesus
[1:38:43] jesus himself but in another form
[1:38:50] and she just wants to know where the
[1:38:51] body's at
[1:38:53] where can i go back and worship where
[1:38:55] can i go back
[1:38:58] and he does something special
[1:39:01] he calls her by name
[1:39:04] when he calls her name
[1:39:07] something in her wakes up
[1:39:10] and now she knows she knows who she's
[1:39:13] looking for the one that she desires is
[1:39:15] the one that's speaking to her
[1:39:18] and i say the one that you and i desire
[1:39:20] is the one that's speaking to us
[1:39:22] he's speaking out of his word amen he's
[1:39:25] opening his word and he's speaking love
[1:39:26] words to us the one we're looking for is
[1:39:28] the one who's speaking to us
[1:39:32] he's in another form
[1:39:34] but he's still here
[1:39:37] brother branham says in questions and
[1:39:39] answers on the seals
[1:39:40] he said all that's in the book holds
[1:39:42] that mystery
[1:39:44] the book holds that mystery and the book
[1:39:46] is only unfolding it now not each one's
[1:39:48] name but what the mystery of the book is
[1:39:51] while it's calling those names you
[1:39:54] understand that now see the book doesn't
[1:39:55] say now leave fails to be saved in this
[1:39:57] church age ormond never or whoever know
[1:39:59] it don't say that it just shows the
[1:40:01] mystery
[1:40:03] unfolds the mystery of what the thing is
[1:40:07] now i'm saying it's revealing the
[1:40:08] mystery while it's calling the names
[1:40:11] so as it's revealing the mystery it's
[1:40:12] calling you
[1:40:14] and revealing the mystery is calling you
[1:40:16] it's calling your name not not chad and
[1:40:20] not larry not bob not susie not any of
[1:40:23] these names it's calling the real you
[1:40:25] down on the inside it's giving the
[1:40:27] revelation of the mystery peeling back
[1:40:30] the mystery of god peeling back the
[1:40:32] mystery of christ and something in you
[1:40:34] says i reckon that's it that's me he's
[1:40:37] calling me i'm coming to him
[1:40:41] and she said master
[1:40:43] it's you
[1:40:45] oh and this day
[1:40:47] i want to ask you a question
[1:40:50] who are you looking for
[1:40:53] who are you looking for
[1:40:56] who are you looking for and what do you
[1:40:58] expect to see
[1:41:01] i'll tell you
[1:41:02] be looking for the one that can break
[1:41:04] the mystery and call your name
[1:41:07] look for the one that can open something
[1:41:10] up that that draws you and says that's
[1:41:12] the truth that's me that's my identity
[1:41:14] that's who i am that's the lord amen
[1:41:16] it's the lord that's calling me
[1:41:20] somebody will come to church and hear a
[1:41:21] preacher somebody will come and hear the
[1:41:23] lord
[1:41:25] somebody will hear a man speak a couple
[1:41:28] thousand words amen and get a little bit
[1:41:30] hoarse amen and then they'll go home and
[1:41:32] say those were good words and that that
[1:41:33] was neat how that come together but
[1:41:35] somebody else will go beyond the horse
[1:41:37] voice somebody else will go beyond the
[1:41:39] vessel standing in the pulpit and
[1:41:40] they'll say god was talking to me god
[1:41:42] was asking me questions god was
[1:41:44] identifying where i was at and god was
[1:41:46] calling my name
[1:41:50] he's here the son of man the ministry of
[1:41:53] jesus christ himself is here it's in the
[1:41:56] bride amen there's a fightful ministry
[1:41:59] preaching out the word he's here he's
[1:42:01] calling is he calling you
[1:42:06] who are you looking for
[1:42:09] as we finish this morning i want to
[1:42:11] leave with that question and don't make
[1:42:13] it for anybody else who do you seek
[1:42:17] whom seekest thou
[1:42:20] are you looking for a church
[1:42:22] you're looking for a good minister are
[1:42:24] you looking for a better condition in
[1:42:26] life are you looking for some some
[1:42:28] easier path are you looking for
[1:42:30] something that satisfies and tantalizes
[1:42:32] the intellect or what whom are you
[1:42:34] seeking
[1:42:39] if you're seeking him
[1:42:41] and if you're truly seeking him
[1:42:44] he'll come to you
[1:42:47] but don't worry if it's in another form
[1:42:51] just listen for that identification
[1:42:54] the way he calls your name
[1:42:57] the familiar resonance in your heart
[1:43:00] that warmness that that something that
[1:43:03] tugs it says
[1:43:04] that's him
[1:43:06] that's him
[1:43:08] he's the one who's calling me
[1:43:12] tell you so many people are missing
[1:43:14] where he's at because they're they don't
[1:43:16] know what to look for
[1:43:19] they're looking for where he was they
[1:43:20] were all looking for where he was and
[1:43:22] that tomb was empty
[1:43:24] they're all trying to go back to where
[1:43:26] he was and they're missing where he is
[1:43:30] and he was speaking to her
[1:43:32] in the form of a gardener he was in
[1:43:34] another form and he appeared to the two
[1:43:36] in the road to emmaus and begin and
[1:43:38] every time amen we begin to speak to
[1:43:41] them he began to call their name and he
[1:43:43] began to break the word amen in the
[1:43:45] breaking of the word their eyes would
[1:43:46] become open they begin to recognize who
[1:43:48] this is and what this is and if you
[1:43:50] don't understand his resurrection
[1:43:51] ministry in his resurrection ministry he
[1:43:54] comes in another form and when he comes
[1:43:56] in another form he begins to break the
[1:43:58] word
[1:44:00] and as he breaks the word your eyes come
[1:44:03] open he calls your name you recognize
[1:44:06] who this is
[1:44:08] so as we leave i ask the question
[1:44:11] whom seeketh thou
[1:44:13] whom seek us thou
[1:44:16] and how will you know when you find him
[1:44:23] she was looking for the last vessel he
[1:44:26] was in
[1:44:31] but now
[1:44:32] he was in another form
[1:44:35] and she was missing it
[1:44:37] so in order for her not to miss it he
[1:44:39] called her by name
[1:44:41] intimately said mary
[1:44:45] so you and i wouldn't miss it he calls
[1:44:47] you
[1:44:49] he calls you so you won't miss it
[1:44:51] because it's easy to miss
[1:44:53] it's easy to miss the world's missing it
[1:44:56] friends
[1:44:57] it's they missed it and brother branham
[1:44:59] they were missing it when jesus was
[1:45:01] standing on the earth they missed it in
[1:45:02] the apostles when they come out of the
[1:45:03] upper room it's easy to miss
[1:45:09] but what are you seeking
[1:45:11] whom seeketh thou
[1:45:13] and how do you know when you found him
[1:45:16] who are you looking for what what will
[1:45:19] be the indication you found him
[1:45:23] oh i say listen for the one who's
[1:45:25] calling your name
[1:45:27] listen for the one who's saying i'm here
[1:45:30] it's me
[1:45:31] don't be afraid
[1:45:33] come to me
[1:45:36] don't look at the vessel
[1:45:38] look at the son of man
[1:45:41] look at the one who's asking the
[1:45:42] question whom seek us down
[1:45:45] he's here
[1:45:47] he's here
[1:45:49] he's here to call your name
[1:45:51] he's here to identify himself to his
[1:45:53] disciples he's here to break the word
[1:45:55] he's here amen to starting at moses and
[1:45:59] preaching the whole bible to explain
[1:46:01] himself
[1:46:02] he's still here and he's still doing
[1:46:04] that
[1:46:05] i said let's recognize who's in our
[1:46:07] midst
[1:46:08] then let's all stand
[1:46:11] that was all i had
[1:46:14] musicians if you come like if you'll
[1:46:16] come
[1:46:18] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:46:22] lord jesus i thank you god
[1:46:25] that you've called my name
[1:46:28] god when i was
[1:46:31] in denominationalism stuck in a system
[1:46:33] that i'd been raised in
[1:46:36] you sent a vessel to me lord
[1:46:39] and it wasn't what i expected to see
[1:46:43] i wanted you i was looking for you
[1:46:46] but i had no idea
[1:46:48] that this one that come to me was you in
[1:46:51] another
[1:46:52] form but god in your mercy
[1:46:56] you began
[1:46:57] to break open your word
[1:47:00] you begin to explain the scriptures and
[1:47:02] show
[1:47:04] all that must be done in the last days
[1:47:06] and all the prophecies that must be
[1:47:07] fulfilled
[1:47:10] god as you broke the bread you opened my
[1:47:12] eyes
[1:47:13] you called my name
[1:47:16] the one that i was seeking came to me
[1:47:19] i didn't know how to go to you i didn't
[1:47:20] know how to find you but you came to me
[1:47:22] in another form
[1:47:24] in the form of a brother
[1:47:26] and that brother began to share what was
[1:47:28] in his heart as he shared you begin to
[1:47:30] stir what was in my heart
[1:47:32] you begin to call me lord
[1:47:34] through this ministry through the bribe
[1:47:37] through the messages that your prophet
[1:47:39] preached you begin to call me
[1:47:42] well the question
[1:47:43] you asked me was

[1:49:45] that the devil will not snatch it away
[1:49:47] from your children but lord that it'll
[1:49:48] go and it will root around in the hearts

[1:50:03] lives
