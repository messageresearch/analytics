preeminence among us in jesus christ's name amen god bless you let's just have our seats for a minute just before you uh we go to the word we have a baby dedication this morning so brother greg you

isaiah 53. you know the world is falling apart things are in chaos but the word of god is still being made manifest and the blessings of god are still with his people so we thank god for them i also want to remind you that don't forget that there will be communion service this afternoon for all who'd like to stay for that and we'll try to announce that again at the end of service amen let's look at isaiah chapter 53 verse 1. who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comingness and we when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he he hath put him to grief whom thou shalt make his soul when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed for he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities amen may god add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated god bless you matthew it's good to see you back for a visit amen we saved that seat for you nobody else took it so whenever you visit you can have it amen well we want to look at this uh we've read this a few times but i want to look at it in the context of a thought that god dropped in my heart i was going to go a different direction but this just stirring in me and i couldn't get away from it so for a week now i've been meditating on this and i'd like just for a title to title this every masterpiece has a scar so if you can just think about that every masterpiece has a scar and i'm not really speaking in the terms of worldly masterpieces because you know every every every masterpiece when they get to the point where they call it a masterpiece is a work of art or anything that somebody would call a masterpiece they're looking for something without flaw they're looking for something that that has no flaw that has no error that has nothing wrong with it that's a masterpiece but i like to take a different approach and look from the the um viewpoint that god's been dealing with me on if you'll just go on this journey with me that every masterpiece of god has a scar and we'll just begin to talk about that and share about that and hopefully it'll come to light in the the message the masterpiece which i'm going to be drawing heavily from today uh as i've been studying that message he says after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this then under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and in his vision and desired to see it was completed now he's referring to the statue of moses that michelangelo had worked so long on and he had made it so perfect to the image that was in his mind and he's coming to that part of the story he says and when it was completed he was so inspired by it that he thought his own masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and hollered speak and it made a flaw in it it put a flaw on the image to me the flaw was what made it the masterpiece brother is going to expound on this but i want i want us to lock in on that and don't let's not skip ahead to what else we know brother branham says but just catch what he's saying that it was strict and it had a flaw now there was a flaw in this perfect masterpiece but but the flaw brother branham said is what made it the masterpiece now maybe the mind that might think different you think that spoiled it no to me it made it what it was because after so many years of careful work and toils and inspiration and so forth of making it his toil had proved not in vain it was perfect and that's why he cried out speak because he had seen before him that that was had been able to to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of reason out of ordinary he struck it and hollered speak see he wouldn't have done that if he had thought but he didn't think he was it was inspiration of seeing what he had in his mind setting there perfectly before him amen let's turn to john chapter 20. do we know that brother branham is drawing a parallel between michelangelo creating this great work of the image of moses and being so inspired by seeing it he hollered speak and struck it upon the knee and and he's typing it with god and making his masterpiece when he would rebuild what had fallen in the garden and he built through the old testament through the apostles and the prophets he had built another masterpiece image of a son and that was the son of god that was jesus christ and he come so perfect he becomes such a perfect masterpiece that god struck a blow to him amen to his side and he pulled out the ingredients for his wife and he began to make the bride off of that blow off of that strike where he struck him and and brother ben was running that parallel and let's go to john chapter 20 now verse 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then said he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god now we know that he presents himself to his disciples and we know thomas made the statement i will not believe it unless i can thrust my finger in his hand and my my hand and his side and so jesus appears to them but he shows them his wounds he shows them his flaws he shows them his scars and when when when thomas saw the scars he saw the fall he saw the mark of the crucifixion and he knew that this was the resurrection he says my he this is what he says my lord and my god amen there was something striking about seeing amen the resurrection of christ but christ pointed him because that's what he wanted to look to christ pointed him to the scars in the message marriage and divorce and this is well i'm not going to read this quote i'll read that later let's go back to genesis chapter 2. genesis chapter 2. and verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof so now we know that we've been talking about this a lot lately but i i just can't leave the subject so just bear with me the that that god had made what was in his mind he made a masterpiece in creation and when he had created and brother baby said he created in an evolutionary way i mean not evolution but he created from the small creatures he made him up into the great creatures and finally he he made you know he come to apes and monkeys and and these things and chimpanzees and then he comes to a man and the man was reflecting his image amen and he come to that masterpiece but we'll read here in a moment but brother brother van tells us there wasn't something exactly right so how could you say that god come to his masterpiece it was perfect amen he was reflecting the image of god in the form of creation but it wasn't exactly right amen so god had to strike a little blow and to the side of adam he had to strike a little wound he had to make a little mar he had to put a a mark there and he he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead there of now verse 22 and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made a woman and brought her into a man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so now we see god when he when he forms his masterpiece if you would just be there looking over the banner and watching what god's doing and knowing that he's bringing up a creation and he's going to have a son over this creation and that son is going to be a reflection of himself upon the earth and god he he makes the reflection he makes the image and it looks so good and it looks so perfect but all of a sudden god who is the the mastermind behind the masterpiece this is what you have to remember you have to remember he's the mastermind behind the masterpiece so everything he does is perfect the mastermind behind the masterpiece if he looks at it and says no i need to place a little mark a little blow right here under his rib and i need to pull a piece out of that you who would be watching who doesn't have the mind of the master builder would say you're ruining it you're breaking it you're damaging what you made but he is the mastermind behind the masterpiece and he's not ruining it but he is marking it he is breaking it amen he is taking from it something that he can make a further image of the image that is in his mind so you would want to stop him amen you would want to tell him to don't do that don't ruin it don't break it amen but he's the mastermind behind the masterpiece he's not ruining it amen and brother branham comes to the story of michelangelo and he sees michelangelo was so inspired by the image in his mind becoming a reality in front of him he commanded it to speak and when it wouldn't speak out of frustration he strikes it with the hammer and everyone else brother bam say we say you flawed it it was perfect till that and brother man said that's what made it perfect to me because the mastermind behind the masterpiece put it there because it was such a reality to him and we know that god when he looked down at man alone in the garden although there was nothing wrong with the man he was made correctly he was made in the right order god looked down and says it's not good that man should dwell alone there was something else in his mind something else that had to be expressed so he would strike a blow [Music] brother bam told us we've been reading this quote i won't read all of them but we've been reading several quotes along the lines of how the woman was fashioned differently than all the other original creation and and i want to read one quote along those lines out of the invisible union when you see the woman a byproduct not another female like her made in that order knowing that she would be deceived god knowed if he didn't know the end from the beginning then he wasn't god if he isn't infinite if he can't be infinite without being omniscient omnipresent knowing all things eternal so he knowed all things and he had to make that woman the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist and masculine spirit in himself he had to separate to take a byproduct after the whole creation made new no female created by god in the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knowed she would do it if he didn't he wasn't god but see the attributes that's in god had to be displayed so we spent some time on this but i just it's a it's it's amazing to me amen the way god does the things that he does remember don't ever forget he's the mastermind behind the masterpiece you see there's attributes that's in god had to be displayed god had to display himself as a redeemer he had to display himself as a healer he had to display himself as a savior amen but in his original form of creating there was nothing in the original amen because he because he being perfect he had to make the original perfect and as he was making it they could not sin but he had to create an opening he had to create an opportunity amen so that god wouldn't create evil he would not force evil he would not be evil but he would create something in a way that it had the ability to be perverted for evil purposes without him making it evil without him making it wrong see there was attributes that were locked inside of god characteristics of his nature that he had to have displayed and adam malone could not do it the original creation that had been formed out of the dust of the earth could not do it amen so god was going to have to take a byproduct made off of the original pull out of the man he was going to have to strike a little blow amen and pull out break off a piece and out of the broken piece of the masterpiece he would continue fashioning the masterpiece it was a continuation of the masterpiece broken off and continued to form the masterpiece and then he would present the two back together again and make it the masterpiece the two being won in the garden of eden god was not making the woman wrong he was making her different do we believe that he was not making her wrong he was making her different because he had attributes that were locked inside of him he was to be a savior and to make everything perfect the way he had then there could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women we're at the end so brother bam is trying to get us to see what he's saying this is not for the immature this is not skim milk this is the meat of the gospel this is getting down to the mind of the mastermind amen god is by a prophetic gift allowing us to go back not just to see the thing that was made but go into the mind of the thing that was that made it so that we can understand why he made it that way because until god through a prophetic gift could take us and tap into the mastermind behind the masterpiece we would look with confusion at why why would god do it this way why would god allow the the devil amen to be in the garden why would he allow him access to his children why would he put those two trees there why didn't he put a fence around the tree why did he make the tree to begin with why was the tree there why why did they have access to the tree why would god not prevent the fall why would he why would he not keep the devil why didn't he just destroy him from the beginning why did he make a woman that way amen to where she could fall why why why why why because all we're doing is looking at the image and the image we see is yielding questions because we don't understand because it doesn't look like a masterpiece in the way that we would think a masterpiece would be made there's a there's a flaw there there's something there there's an open door there's an ability amen for the door to be opened and you would think a mastermind making a masterpiece he would make it so tight button it up under such security with such safety that there would be no opportunity for the fall but see the problem is we didn't understand through the church ages what was in the mind of the mind of the master craftsman and so we would make all kinds of excuses and stories and fairy tales and all kinds of ways to explain all of this but when god tapped us into his mind and he opened he opened a realm of heaven he opened the door to his mind to the revelation of the word amen and invited us to come up hither through a prophetic gift he was sharing with us the mind the mastermind of the masterpiece builder and then you could look at his masterpiece and say it's perfect it's perfect it's perfect everything he did was perfect see if you go back and we begin to read uh genesis in the account in the garden of eden and you begin to read it without the understanding of the mind of god you start to think that what god was wanting to do was create a perfect world and in that perfect world he was going to set a perfect son or daughter and then the perfect son and daughter he would have perfect fellowship and all of that is true is that all true that's all true but you and i without this prophetic gift we would have thought that's the only thing he wanted to do that's all he was after he just wanted to get a perfect son and a perfect daughter and he wanted to get them in a perfect place so he could come down and have perfect fellowship and he accomplished all of that in his creation amen by the time he got to the end of it he looked over all that he made and he said behold it is very good and he took his rest amen and he began to fellowship he had it the way he had it the way he wanted it he had perfect fellowship with a perfect son or daughter and a perfect setting but god made it in such a fashion that it could become imperfect showing that there was something more that he wanted this wasn't the only thing he wanted this wasn't the only expression in his heart it wasn't the only thing in his mind it wasn't the only thing he wanted us to see the great artist wanted us to see more so we as human beings think that perfection was in the garden that was it oh how horrible what a horrible thing that the picture was ruined amen god knew before the foundation of the world that the picture would be ruined amen it was part of his intention to allow the picture to be ruined because he's making a great masterpiece and all of these are pieces of the great masterpiece and we get locked down on one picture in one piece and get confused and don't understand why it's this way and why it's that way until a prophet of god can lift us up and see a greater picture and say all of this is painting the same picture when when lucifer comes as the devil and begins to work through the serpent he's looking for the weak spot the part that can be flawed so he comes to the part that's made off the floor looks like a broken piece looks like a marred spot and he comes and he comes to the woman and he begins to work on her and find out that there's a weakness laying in the woman and he thinks now that he's taking advantage of god and he's taking advantage of god's miscalculation god left a weakness here oh he shouldn't have done that he uh oh i i've caught something god didn't foresee i see i see he gave in to his son because his son was lonely and he had to catch up with creation and make something i see now he's been he's so wise he's become a fool with such wisdom and such intellect and such reasoning abilities and such brightness amen he sees this weakness this is what got him in trouble in heaven amen because he couldn't understand michael's humble kingdom and he thought for sure that he could build a greater kingdom than michael's humble kingdom there is something in the humility something in the simplicity that he didn't comprehend and that's what got him in trouble the first time and that's what got him kicked out and now he comes to earth and he begins to try to bring perversion into god's paradise amen into god's pleasure which is eden and he begins to explore and he finds a weakness and he thinks once again aha i got him i found it and god when he built the woman he had laid a trap a big old bear trap and he had opened that bear trap and he said it and he's got it sitting there but he doesn't want it to look like a dangerous place to step so he makes it look comfortable and easy you can take this one you can you may not be able to get to adam but to his wife you can get to this one all it is is a trap that was sad and when the devil come down exploring the weakness of the woman and he and he went to touch that he didn't realize that he pushed over the first domino in a whole string of dominoes that was going to be the thing that was going to absolutely destroy his very existence because god had attributes inside of him as redeemer attributes amen that he had to be expressed and if he's going to express himself as a victor as a champion as a father as a healer as a deliverer he was going to have to have a worthy adversary that could draw all of these characteristics out of him you could even you could even go beyond eden you could go back further than eden and you could look to heaven and you could say if you look in eden say why did god put the tree of knowledge of good and evil there where they could access it why why did he do that and you have to ask a question why did he make lucifer in such a way that lucifer could be corrupted by his own brightness there was a weakness in lucifer what was his weakness his weakness was he didn't have character but he had every gift and every ability he had all he had everything if you read the description of him in ezekiel he has every attribute you could possibly want he was beautiful he had you know the pipes and the tablets and the organs were made in him and the day he was created he was full of wisdom he was perfect in beauty but there was a weakness in what looked like perfection god could not make lucifer evil any more than he can make the woman evil but he made lucifer in such a way he could be corrupted he didn't make him corrupted but he made lucifer with a door that can be opened and gave him free choice where he could open the door and he was deceived by his own brightness his own revelation his own wisdom his own understanding his own enlightenment his own brightness is what he was deceived by and you think how could god let that happen amen because inside of god were attributes that had to be expressed because before amen before there was a creation on the earth there was a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and there were names attribute names written on that book of life amen so god had already the mastermind behind the masterpiece he already had a pencil sketch and that pencil sketch is the lamb's book of life and he's building his masterpiece to match his pencil sketch i hope you forgive me for using terms like that but how could god allow that to happen in heaven how when he finished heaven let's just think about the creation because before the heavenly realms and dimensions were created there was just god he wasn't even god yet because there was nothing to worship him he was elohim the self-existing one and when he first began to create brother brahma said in my opinion he first created angels and he began to create a heavenly realm with with heavenly creatures so that they could begin to worship him and so his first creation amen was in the heavenly realms and when he when he began to create in the heavenly realms they began to worship him and that made him god and so his first oh if i could just say if you'll just forgive me for just using terms that i understand because i don't know how to say it but his first paradise his first eden his first creation his first place where the angels sang songs to him and worshiped him around the throne and began to glorify his name that first place was the heavenly realm and there was a creature placed in that first realm that could be corrupted it couldn't be corrupted by god but he could be self-corrupted and he was self-corrupted and began to bring a corruption into the heavenly dimension and there was a fall that took place in the heavenly dimension and god's first masterpiece of heaven now is flawed does that make sense so god begins to create now upon the earth and we know what we catch in genesis 1 2 is a re-creation there was a creation before in genesis 1 1 and now we have a re-creation he's forming now a world and he's forming in eden which is his pleasure now he's forming a garden in the and eastward in eden now he's setting there the the image of himself in the form of a man now he's recreating his pleasure upon earth and he's got everything just right there's a perfect harmony in all of creation and nature is clicking right on time and there's harmony between the man and all of the creation and everything's just right but it's not good that that man's alone if all god was trying to do was move from heaven because heaven now has a flaw i hope you'll forgive me for saying that this is the only way i understand it we all think that the heavenly realm is perfection but the bible shows us that the heavenly realm is not imperfection because when daniel was praying in the book of daniel he was calling for a revelation on on these 70 weeks that jeremiah spoke of amen and god had dispatched gabriel to come to him but gabriel could not get to him because the prince of the power of persia withstood him so he had to return and get michael and michael would come where is this taking place in the heavenlies in the heavenly dimension in the heavenly realms amen all of this warfare is taking place where they're resisting gabriel you would think gabriel could just walk right in and do whatever he wanted but there's something that's happened in the heavenlies there's a scar even the apostle paul says we wore not with flesh and blood but against principalities and powers in heavenly places so there's a warfare there's a resistance there's there's a fighting that is going on in the heavenlies so you think well that was now flawed so god will now come down to the earth and begin to bring his eden his paradise the creation that's in his mind and the same thing that happened in heaven now takes place on earth there was a weakness created in a vessel amen in the the the uh the devil comes in through the serpent he exploits that weakness and and by free choice she opens the door she was made so that she could open the door and then a a corruption sets in a flaw a brokenness comes into the image of god and now you would think as a human being we would say why did he do it he should have learned what happened in heaven god should have known better look at what happened in heaven and now it's happened again on earth oh poor god that's how humans think but in this age we've been lifted above human reasoning we've been lifted out of carnal understanding we've been lifted out of denominational fairy tales and story books amen and nursery rhymes we've been lifted into a realm where you can see it wasn't poor god god had a plan in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world and he's working his plan he's building his masterpiece and it looks like but if it's ruined it's not ruined amen it has to go this way for the next step brother branham in marriage and divorce he refers to the way that the woman was made he said he didn't make her like that in the beginning like the rest of his females because it wouldn't be it would be unbecoming to him he is the fountain of all purity that's the reason he had to let satan get a hold of her what he had done in the perversion such a creature would be would not be becoming to him originally designed for him all his works that he designed and the original is in continuation continuity all of his original works was in continuity the female dog the male dog female kale the mountain male cow everything in continuity all nature is in continuity seed die go in the ground just like death burial resurrection the sap goes down out of the tree drops its leave off comes back the next year with resurrection of new life see what i mean everything even nature of god is all continuity in one and here is one designed out of the continuity of god nature is so designed so it can't send think the original creation of god could not sin oh don't you see it now in this view here the perversion of the church the original is the word he's bringing it right back to the church the original is the word but the byproduct that come off the word after calvary amen the devil could get to that and corrupt that so he's showing us the same story he's actually teaching us the seven church ages there is no sin in god see what i mean here is a creature that came into existence by a perversion god is going to have a church but look at his perverted thing that got out here god has male and female but this woman see the very symptoms if it shows back that was in god's mind he could take an hour or two and break that down oh my he said listen i'm going to repeat that sentence sentence but this woman see the very symptoms of it shows back what was in god's mind the very way he made her and what happened shows what was back in god's mind he didn't make a mistake did he allow his image to be flawed yes was it a mistake no praise god he said we could take an hour to and break that down she made this creature for that way he she made this creature for that way he made the creature and turned her so satan could get a hold of her and he did god her matter made god didn't turn her over to satan god didn't make her god made her i this is the only way i know to say it so it's a it's a simple way to say it but god made her with a door that could be open but god didn't make her with an open door because god didn't make corruption god did not make evil amen what god made was perfect and what god made was good amen and that door could have stayed shut by free moral agency could have stayed shut forever but god knew he had already foresaw he knew what would happen so god he he sent her down with a weakness with a door that could be open but he put a good latch on it and he gave her the word and if she would have stayed with the word that door would have stayed latched the devil couldn't turn that latch she was the only one that could turn it god wouldn't even turn that latch because god can't make anything corrupted she had to do it of her own free choice so god turned her so satan could get a hold of her and he did i think we come to the conclusion now that god didn't make a mistake see if we don't have this understanding that the that has come through this prophetic ministry in this day then we look back at the garden of eden through denominational fairy tales and you think the devil is really strong and he keeps tripping up god that devil he's crafty he's wise he's strong and he keeps tripping up god but when you come to the revelation of the hour you realize that god is further entangling the devil and further ensnaring the devil and further ensnaring the devil until god's finally done and got him so tied up that his doom and his damnation is so complete that when god flips the switch it's finished he's bringing him in he's getting him closer he's putting him further into the trap deeper in with every mar and every strike and every flaw and every failure he's bringing him in a little closer so we know there was a flaw in the garden of eden brother branham said the masterpiece now lay in ruin and god wasn't going to let it stay that way he went right to work to rebuild it the truth is god was waiting for this to happen so that he can move to the next step in his masterpiece in the message the masterpiece he says and as he began to work upon creeping things like the little animals upon the earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else higher then finally he brought it into the larger animals such as the lion tiger bear then he brought into the type of maybe monkeys apes and so forth now not an evolution as we think one come from that was a complete creation god working in a pattern but finally there come forth upon the earth of perfection and that was a man and when he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was god had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and when i might say to this that when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he was by himself and that's how god had been by himself and he was eternal and the man now in the image of god also exists on the earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the peace that struck off of it and made him a help made a wife then he wasn't by himself he had somebody with him and that's his great work and he as any sculptor would take his masterpiece now first he had a masterpiece of himself and now see the masterpiece was lonesome like he was so he divided the masterpiece by striking in the side and brought forth to help me so he had a masterpiece that masterpiece was a man like himself but he struck the masterpiece and flawed it and broke it so that he could make another masterpiece that was not a devaluation of the first masterpiece but within that masterpiece was another masterpiece hidden and he had to strike it he had to break it to bring out the further expression of the masterpiece now to make the two one he put them like any great sculptor in a place that's beautiful a sculptor wouldn't make a great masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere are hidden behind buildings as our lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel now listen to this statement he slips in because this is one of those that just triggered thoughts in me said when we become god's masterpieces we're becoming god's masterpieces so there's masterpiece works that are continuing to go on when we become god's masterpieces we're not hidden in an alley somewhere we must give light so we're going to move on we'll come back to that statement in a few minutes so we see that he after he had made this masterpiece he placed it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the garden of eden he placed his masterpiece of two being one in the garden of eden how it must have pleased him that he saw his masterpiece was well we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work now remember that my opinion listen to what brother brahms is going to say now just catch it he's talking about god he just made the statement he made the one he broke him a piece off and made the other made his great masterpiece of two being one set him in a beautiful place somewhere not an alley but in eden he was so satisfied that he took his rest now brother ben's going to inject the thought now remember that my opinion the masterpiece is the stroke the masterpiece is the stroke that married saint angelo's moses masterpiece in the monument so what's he saying that the masterpiece is the stroke the stroke's what makes it what it is and there's going to come a stroke a blow to this masterpiece but there has to come that blow to that masterpiece that's what makes it the masterpiece you say brother chad what are you saying you're saying the fall the fall of man the ruination of mankind the sin and the fall amen it was the stroke that made it the masterpiece it was the stroke that made it the masterpiece because remember when the woman was formed before she was formed there was a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world there was attributes that was locked inside of god that had to be expressed so absolutely the blow the strike the fall is the masterpiece makes it what it is because that unlocked attributes of god that can start going into display a whole set of characteristics and nature of god was locked up oh what are you saying brother that i'm saying what the prophet of god has come to teach us that when god dwelled alone with himself elohim amen was locked inside of him a million billion trillion attributes things he wanted to express and desire and there alone by himself he was not having expression so the first thing he did in order to express himself is god he creates angels so that they can worship him what's he doing he's expressing what's in the mastermind of the master builder but he had more in him than to be god because there was also a father there was also a warrior a conqueror a mighty one so he would create a michael because in him was a conqueror a mighty one a great warrior so he would create a michael and michael now was going to be the conqueror the mighty one the great warrior angel of god but he was going to be hidden in humility and then he was going to create another one which are going to be lucifer and lucifer was built in a way that he could self-corrupt and in his self-corruption he would begin to look at michael and not realize that there lays a power an attribute of god in angelic form there lays a conqueror a mighty one a powerful angel he couldn't see it amen with the intellect wisdom reasoning that he had all he could see was the humility but god had placed attributes down in michael that had to be expressed in order to express that there was an angel that had to fall so that war could break out in heaven so that god could express himself is it a bad thing or a good thing it just depends on which side you're on it depends on how you look at this brother better says don't be children anymore this is the end time this isn't for childish observation i mean when we were children our parents would do things that we did not understand decisions they made that made absolutely no sense to us they would forbid us from activities that look like nothing but pure pleasure and fun when you're a child you're like what's wrong with dad he's there's something wrong with dad he just doesn't get it he won't let me jump off the house with my handmade parachute he won't let me see if i can skip my four-wheeler across the pond he what's wrong with dad but then you grew up and you're like boy i'm thankful for dad he kept me alive and we had childish understanding of god childish understanding of the heavenly realm childish understanding and i'm not saying we have adult understanding but brother bam is calling us to have adult understanding he's saying stop being children this is the end time god releasing his mind releasing his nature releasing in the opening of the seven seals friends it wasn't just about information it was the very plan of god the very desire nature plan concept of god was now being pulled back amen so that you could see his original pencil sketch and then you could see this is his masterpiece everything's ticking just right on time nothing's out of kilter there's nothing wrong with what god's doing god's calling for us to be not children anymore but to understand i'm continuing on in this masterpiece quote with this thought now remember that my opinion the masterpiece is the stroke that marred it and it was the stroke that cut the side of the masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see him as a masterpiece family in the garden of eden how beautiful was that it so pleased him until he took his rest but while he was resting and trusting to his masterpiece his enemy came in and found his great masterpiece and by deceit he crawls under the garden walls and he marred this beautiful masterpiece he marred it so that it fell now notice then this masterpiece when satan got a hold of it the deceiver broke through the walls and he marred this masterpiece because that's the way he did it how did he do it it'll go more in the details of that the masterpiece was walled by the word god's word and the masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by his word but the broken part that was broke off of the original you catch that the broken part that was broke off the original that's what he's going after the broken part that was broke off the original went out beyond that wall it gives satan a chance tomorrow and now as you know what i believe on those things so i won't have to say that but the masterpiece was broken but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is god and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again into his own image a man we know that he built that image and that image of that man that he rebuilt was jesus christ amen but he struck him too and he broke him and he took a broken piece off of him and the broken piece off of him is what the devil came to because it could not break him he was an original creation he was an original spoken word creation of god he could not be broken but broke off of him come another part which was the bride the church and that's the part that the devil focused on again he says in the identified masterpiece of god and now what made him to me the masterpiece to me and to you is because god smote him he smote him at calvary if he hadn't smitten no matter how many dead he had raised how great he had preached what his great life was what his claims was he was proven there he was so pleased god was until he was the only man that ever stood on the face of the earth that god could smite for the rest of them all that perfect one was smitten for the imperfect the whole creation that had fell through adam it was redeemed through jesus christ god's masterpiece has stood the test how did he do it by the word it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god back to the masterpiece message paragraph 78 he says god when he looked upon him he was so inspired he to see him the way he looked and see the form of him he was so inspired that it would be the perfect masterpiece of a redeemer jesus the redeemer so god in order to be smitten himself who's being smitten now god god in order to be smitten himself because to pay his own penalty god and christ become one so god could be smote in the image he could be scarred god made himself a body called it son but a body he could live in so that he could be smote so that he could be scarred you say scar god don't forget it's the scar that makes it the masterpiece the scar is what makes it what it was god came down so that he could be scarred so out of the scar could come the rest of his attributes now i wanna i wanna lay that as a foundation as a big picture but i to dive down a little bit and get to the the smaller picture of you and i because we see now what god's done in his plan of redemption and the plan that he had how all of these seeming falls and strokes and and uh uh images falling into ruin how it all looks like disasters but not one of it is a disaster in god's plan of redemption it's all one's moving to the next to the next and it's moving god's plan of redemption right now remember god had a masterpiece creation and he had that in adam he had a masterpiece family when he separated him and brought the two together but don't forget he has a masterpiece redemption too and all of these are playing into the masterpiece redemption picture that he's painting the thing that he's fashioning it's as if you look at a a great work of art or you look at a wall that's all sculpted and it tells a narrative it tells a story but if you look down each sculpture each each thing portrays another part of that story and then and you have this image and that image has a story then you go down the wall and the next image has a story and the next one has a story and the next one has a story you can get hung up on one story and say well that's a tragic story but that story leads to the next story leads to the next story and by the time you get down and you look at the whole mural of all these sculptures that god has made all these masks and each one of them was a masterpiece moses was a masterpiece but he was flawed is that right jeremiah was a masterpiece but flawed isaiah was a masterpiece but flawed david was a masterpiece but was flawed and you could hang up on one and say oh the artist oh how could he allow this flaw and this failure and how could god uh tell a story and paint a picture and have a bad breaststroke there and have a a marred spot there and how when we read the bible it's not perfect amen it's not perfect in the way man thinks is perfect but when god looks down at this word he says it's perfect the way i think of perfect because you could just go to one character in moses and say well what a failure noah after he had had faith and he had survived uh the the flood and he had a great testimony then he's found drunk and there's a corruption that sets in because of his drunkenness and his family what a disaster what a disaster and we're looking what a disaster amen you go to another image and you begin to look at the image of david and how david was a man after god's own heart and how perfect but he has this temptation with bathsheba and has a man murdered and takes the wife of uriah and oh what a disaster in the baby that is born of that conception dies what is happening god what are you doing but i'm so thankful we live in a day amen we're the prophet of god he could show you all the details on the wall you could look at it all and he says now back up back up lift out of the barnyard spread your wings amen those old and new testament get a little higher until you can see the whole picture and when you see the whole picture you say it's perfect it's perfect it's perfect it's perfect it's perfect because he had one story to tell one goal he wanted to achieve and all the characters in the bible were types and shadows pointing to this one thing that god wanted to achieve i'm so thankful to be alive in this day i am so thankful amen that we don't have coloring book of the old testament and that's all we know about it but it came in the vivid life amen we begin to see that my story is wrapped up in their story amen everything god's doing he's been showing what he's doing and he's doing what he's been showing one leads to the next leads to the next leads to the next and they're all marred they're all scarred they all have a flaw because it's the flaw that makes it the masterpiece and when you understand what the masterpiece is then you begin to understand why it's the flaw that makes the masterpiece because the masterpiece is redemption and you can't have redemption without a flaw you can't have redemption without a scar there has to be a scar to have redemption there has to be a fall to have redemption and god's great plan is redemption so that he can show his attributes so that the artist can show all that was in his mind all that he conceived before the foundation everything that was in him is coming out in this work of art i come to this quote here in masterpiece when i was meditating on it and it just struck me and this is what i want to spend a few minutes on now now watch every masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture angelo's monument of moses is on a three or four foot piece of marble he begins to talk about the four corner foundation and it being the patriarchs of abraham isaac jacob and joseph but he's going to get to joseph start talking about joseph he says abraham was faith isaac was love represented love amen and then jacob represented grace because he was the supplanter the shyster and then he gets to joseph his perfection and listen what he says said abraham portrayed christ of course so did isaac in love abraham did in faith isaac didn't love jacob did in his grace because jacob means deceiver and that's what he was but god's grace was with him but when it come to joseph there was nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece are you catching it he didn't say joseph was perfection he was all perfect and that's what made it a masterpiece he said no all but one little scratch one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece when he told his father the prophet say to your pharaoh say to pharaoh that your people are cattle raisers not shepherds because a shepherd is an abomination in egypt but when the old prophet god before pharaoh he said your servants are herdsmen so it scratched it see that's why it still makes it the masterpiece if joseph had been perfect he wouldn't need redemption if joseph hadn't had that scratch that flaw he wouldn't know god as a forgiving father he wouldn't know god as a redeemer and as a savior he wouldn't know how powerful the blood is to wash away all sins there would be so much of god that joseph if he didn't have the scratch wouldn't understand but it was that scratch that little scratch that still made it the masterpiece it still had to be a masterpiece so it still had to have a scratch think about this god so wanted to be identified with his creation that he would form a spoken word body and come and dwell in that body and in that body would be the blood of god it would be the body that god created to dwell in and he would be scarred in that body because he's also a masterpiece and all of his masterpiece is scarred and even god and his fleshly body is scarred there's a theme here and i want to take a look at our lives for just a few minutes and the message things that are to be the prophet of god says you know i've always been considered on account of they call me a woman hater and i'm not i don't like him moral indecent i like real genuine sisters of christ that way all right i had some scars when i was a kid i know things that happened that's kind of turned me on that way but it was all god making and molding me for this hour when brother branham could look back over his life he could see scars he could look back over his ministry and he could see scars rejection as a child he could see the scars of what he saw taking place at his father's moonshine still and the women laying out all night married women and living in it scarred him and he would say harsh things about immoral women never about sisters he had up most respect for them but about harsh things and he says i know that i had some scars as a kid that turned me that way but look at brother brenham now not regretting his scars not wishing them away not blaming them for anything he said that's what turned me that way he says but listen he says it was all god making molding me for this hour he could look back at the scars of poverty the scars of rejection due to his family's poverty and his dad's alcoholism scars of getting the wrong ideas about women that had to be corrected by seeing godly women scars scars scars scars and ministry by rejection of ministers and false accusations and he said sometimes he said i think i'm all cut up on the inside from a lot of hard battles but he didn't say i wish i didn't have him i wish that didn't happen to me because remember it's the scar that makes the masterpiece even god come down to be scarred to be in the masterpiece every one of us are scarred we're scarred by the fall do you believe that by what took place at the garden of eden you're scarred if you want to see your scar just lift your shirt and look at your belly button not now but when you get home you have a mark there that now you've come because of what took place everyone that's born that way outside of christ now is is born into corruption you're marked with wrong thinking marked we've been marked with wrong teaching we've had we we are scarred by things other people have done to us we are scarred by things we've done to us we're scarred by what parents have done uncles and aunts we're scarred by what other church members have done is that right we have we have scars we've stood up and we've fallen back down walked a few steps and fallen back down is that true i hope i'm not the only one run for a little bit then trip and fall back down and get marred again get broken again get scarred again and you think if only god would have kept me from that if only god would have in my childhood not allowed that abuse not allowed that neglect not allowed if only god would have stopped me from seeing that it would have never started this addiction in my life if only god would have kept me from that first puff why didn't god stop that why didn't god let me be born in a different house why couldn't i have a different home why couldn't i have a different mother and a different father it would have been so different for me if god would have come on brother if god would have just stopped me god why don't you stop me from sin listen when you really fly a little higher you realize it's the scar that makes the masterpiece it's the stroke it's the fall because if you lived a perfect life not even joseph was allowed to get through without a scratch i mean because the scratch would require redemption and redemption was an attribute that was locked inside of god in this whole story he's been telling is a story of redemption because he's a god who wants to be expressed he's a god who wants to be known he's an artist who's expressing in all of his windy work he's expressing himself in it all when you come to a realization that all of this was for a purpose the the the being drug from pillar to post and marriages and divorces and a messed up childhood and a messed up adulthood and a messed up mind and this and that you can you can just take your own story and you can fill in all your own scratches your own scars and you can see oh if that wouldn't have happened i wouldn't be dealing with this issue now is that right yes if only i hadn't had this i wouldn't have this i'd like to say if you didn't have that you wouldn't know christ brother branham was talking one time about his nervous tension that he had he had it since he was a child he said oh i've thought so long if i could just get free of this nervousness but then i begin to think this nervousness is a blessing why would i be without this tension without tension he said you would just fly loose it's the tension that holds you together and he says it's this tension that drove me to christ it's the scars that make redemption beautiful it's the scars that make calvary so precious it's the scars that make what the prophet teaches us so powerful i wish brother ben could have wished he was born in a wealthy family he could have wished he was born to a non-alcoholic dad he could have wished that he was born and had gotten an education he could have wished he could wished and could have wished and couldn't wish but we look at brother branham's life and we say i can't feel sorry for you because everything that you suffered with was for me it was to display christ to me you look at brother brennan's life and you don't look at a messed up life and you don't look at a failure you look at a masterpiece do any of you or is it just me you look at brother branham's life and you look at what he went through and you look at what god brought him to and you look at what the word did and you're looking at a masterpiece why is it that we can look at brother branham's life and see a masterpiece and we look at our life and all we see is ruin we can look at we can look at redemption in his life salvation in his life deliverance in his life we can look at what he was we could even look at his mistakes when he tried to get his wife amen to lie and you can look at him and say what beautiful humility but if you do the same thing and come to the same repentance all you can say is what a waste of human flesh but i'd like to say it's the scar that makes the masterpiece it was brother benham's failure under tension and under stress with the call of the lawyer that came in it was that failure that god would by the power of the holy ghost convict him and he would come back and make a repentance and he would repent for the people and explain what he had done and how he had failed god and i say that's a masterpiece but without the scratch is the masterpiece on full display do you get the full effect of the mind of the of the artist without the scratch the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the lord when he formed me in the womb he knew me all my members were written in this book when they were not yet fashioned are these true statements about you if they're true statements about you then he knows he knows what family you were born into he knows of the difficulty he knows about the dead loved one he knows about the abandonment he knows about the neglect he knows about the abuse he knows about your failure brother branham said there's certain failures amen there's certain failures that you carry a scar with you the rest of your life you can never erase it that's true certain things you do to your body and certain things you do with your body that you can be forgiven you can be justified in the sight of god but on this earth you can never erase some of those things you live with those scars the rest of your life brother branham he made a statement uh that i found fascinating back in 1951 i'll just i'll just quote it to you i got to hear at the end of my notes he's talking about a husband and wife and he's talking about dealing with one another and not being rough with one another and when some person just won't give in just give in to him sometimes and he says it'll work its way out later and he says see if i can find it he says in here oh my computer's locked up he says i won't get a verbatim but you trust me right i'm not making it up he says there's a golden bowl of oil in the human heart he said it can be broken right it can be broken and it leaks out he said it can be healed but you'll always have a scar see when you come into this life as a child you've got that golden bowl of oil in the human heart is that true yes golden bowl of oil in the human heart and somewhere along the way it's been broken i don't know any of us that can say it's not been broken it's been broken we know what it's like for the heart to be broken and the oil to leak out but what the prophet said is that can be healed that can be healed it can be healed and it can hold oil again that's the most encouraging thing to me is it doesn't have to stay that way that heart can be healed and it can hold oil again but you'll always have a scar will you ever completely forget whatever happened to you no will will you never think back with regrets and never think back at the difficulties will it will it never will the scar go away no the scar is not going to go away but to me the scar is the masterpiece because the scar shows that there was a god that could heal that heart so it could hold oil again the scar is what shows god the scar is what shows the power of god the scar is what shows the ability of god to take what the devil tried to bring ruined to but god can bring a healing so that heart can hold that golden oil again and you can love and receive love and you can function as a christian as a believer because there's a god on this earth there's a redemption that's taking place there's a power of healing that's here let the scar be a masterpiece amen quit letting the devil take your scar and continue to bring ruination and can bring bring heartache and bring destruction amen that's not why it's there it's there to display the power of god and all the attributes of god to overcome everything that the devil has ever laid at the feet of god's children there is a power that has been released in this hour and that is the full power of the full word so that we can fly a little higher than the chicken yard a little higher than the fence post so we can get up and say it's all been god god knew the end from the beginning there's nothing out of kilter with god i'm not damaged good i'm a display of righteousness i'm a display of the power of god i'm a display of the handiwork of god it's the scar that makes the masterpiece you can say i don't want to have any problems nobody wants to have problems like i've got problems with my tablet i don't want to have any problems with my tablet but god god has made it so that the attributes that were locked inside of him can only be released when there's a scar the attributes that were locked inside of him were were released when there was a scar in heaven then he come down to earth and he made something that was beautiful you and i if we were given the option and god said what do you think now not now but if he would give us the option before we come to the message what do you think should i put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden or not which choice would you make i said no don't take a chance and ain't worth the risk and he says there's no risk i'm not taking a chance there is no risk there's something in me i want my attributes to know there's something in me that has to be expressed there's something that i am that has to be manifested and i'm telling you if you if you wanted to be born in a flowery bed of ease and you want to be rocked in a gentle cradle all your life and never have to face ridicule never have to face rejection never fail of your own bad choices never have anybody else wound you to the point of scaring you i'm telling you you're going to miss out you are you're ruining god's picture you're ruining god's handiwork you're ruining god's piece of art remember brother man talks about the picture he does this so much friends it's amazing he said i look at this picture it was all storms and it was all clouds and it looked terrible it looked frightening it looked like a horrible scene they said you got to get closer it looked horrible it looked terrible it looked like it was a failure and as he got closer he began to see angel's wings and you get a little closer and you see it's the rejoicing and the gathering of angel it wasn't anything scary at all we look at our lives and think it was horrible it's not horrible friends if god has brought you as a predestinated seed gene of god and brought you to redemption brought you back in contact with himself through this word to be united with you then there was nothing wrong with it there's nothing wrong with it amen do you have regrets yes paul the apostle had regrets he was persecuting the christians but he as that persecuting force was actually accomplishing god's good by driving them out of jerusalem is that true the persecution got them out of jerusalem and they took the message with them wherever they went but when god called paul paul all the way over and in first corinthians 15 i believe it is he's still showing regret he said i'm not even worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church and brother branham said he said he consented to the death of stephen and he watched steven die amen that death and he said it always kind of bothered paul but what does paul say let's just turn there i don't have any notes anyway so praise god let's go to first corinthians i wasn't planning on going here but god has different plans in mind first corinthians first corinthians 15. yeah verse nine for i am least of the apostles that i am not meat to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i by the grace of god which was with me therefore whether it was or i or they so we preach and so you believe the apostle paul is saying i'm not even worthy to be called an apostle because of my persecution of the church but it wasn't based on his worthiness they meant it was based on god's choice and he said but by the grace of god i am what i am but he says i bestowed abundantly more labor what was it there was something in the scar that kept driving him there was something in the failure that kept pushing him he kept going to the next village amen there is something about watching steven die there was something about the memory amen of crying moms and crying dads when he would haul a mother off to prison or hall father off to prison there was something about that scar that god was getting leveraged out of god was giving mileage out of because the apostle paul he wasn't saying well i'm no good i'm worthless i'll never do nothing for god look at what happened he recognized the call of god in his life and instead of sitting down on his heels and sitting on his hand and saying i'm such a bad person he said but it's the grace of god but it's moving me to greater action it's moving me to the opposite i hindered now i'll promote i stop now i'll move forward i stone now i'll be stoned i beat so now i'll be beaten amen you have sisters who have lost their virtue because of poor choices and they decide all is lost all is vain i'll never be no good i say let it motivate you into godly femininity and say what i was i'll be the opposite of them what i lost i could never get back i'll be scarred in some ways for life but by the grace of god i am what i am i'm a daughter of god and because of what i know that sin is life because i know where that takes you i'll never flirt with that line again but i'll be a model of what god wants a christian lady to be don't let it hinder you let it push you forward don't let it stop you amen some have been parts of failed churches failed ministries failed this fail that amen don't let it motivate you to pull away from mine because god still has to have a true church there has to be true ministry there has to be a true gathering of the same amen say hey i'll work just as diligently for the next one but you worked for the last one and it failed it doesn't matter there's a true one somewhere and i'll work till i find it it is not time to stop and say but i'm scarred i would but i have you know i have this issue i have this problem i have a difficulty my personality my you know what the brother bram said they said about dwight moody worst speaker he speaks nasally who can stand to listen to him and he won tens if not hundreds of thousands of souls to christ what did he do with a good speaking voice with a nasally high-bitch voice that nobody wanted to hear and the boot he said he was ugly i asked you which one of you knowing that you're ugly having them write about it in the newspaper describing your speech or the lack thereof your ability your name how many of you would get up the next sunday and preach to a few thousand people after you read that report [Music] but the apostle paul says i will now glory in my infirmities for when i am weak then am i strong see it's not time to make scars excuses the scar makes it the masterpiece because the masterpiece is redemption you know the scripture says we've been reading it out of corinthians he says you know look around not much mighty not very noble not rich have been called but god has chosen the weak things why did god choose the weak things he chose the things that are not to bring the not the things that are he chose the weak things to break the power and strength of the wicked why why is god why is god doing it this way because it's the scar that makes the masterpiece brother chad my home wasn't what it should be when i was growing up there was hypocrisy and this and that and so i don't want to go to church let it motivate you to not be a hypocrite it's not listen when we look at it we all have scars but is that outside god's plan is that error is that wrong remember god had a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world and he had your name on that book knowing that you would be redeemed and furthermore he knew what age and what time you would come and he already made redemption provisions for you because he knew you would need redemption you mean god already knew i'd have a scratch god probably knew you would have ten thousand scratches but the scratch makes you a trophy of his grace the corruption makes you a display of his power the failure makes him more powerful your perfection doesn't make god more perfect your failure makes god more perfect he's making you perfect by a perfect bleeding word that bled and died for you to wash you from everything else it's the word that's perfect and the word is what's making you perfect you're not being perfect so that you can display god amen you're failed so that god can wash you up and bring you into perfection by his word so then who becomes the mighty one god praise god franco got my notes up but i don't even feel like using them no more thank you brother franco you're a genius you know we all suffer from the same things and we watched brother branham suffer from it he talked about it openly he he he didn't like being poor when he went out on his first campaign and he had stitched back the pocket and sewed it himself and it was a poor job in a borrowed coat he held his hand over it and he offered people his left hand what was he doing he was suffering under the scar of poverty but here's a man without enough money to buy a coat or even enough money to have it tailored correctly the borrowed when he bond and here's a man who will preach all over the world seven times around the world and stand in king's palaces and pray for kings and why did he start without enough money amen what was it it was the it was the bad patch job on a coat that scar made it the masterpiece to me because that man had no ability to do what god would use him to do it shows how wonderful god is [Applause] he could use his lack of ability as an excuse this is what moses tried to do moses thought he was powerful he thought he was strong so god had to send him on a little journey amen and he knew he was the redeemer he's the right one he's the chosen vessel he's come to the right time 400 years but he's not yet in the right condition he's going to have to get a couple scars first he's going to have to try to bring deliverance he's going to have to fail amen he's going to kill an egyptian he's going to be rejected of his brother and cast out of the kingdom and he's going to have to run and god is going to have to give him a hot tempered wife do you think she didn't give him some scars [Laughter] you're kidding yourself until he's so scarred up and cut up and beat up when god comes to him in a burning bush said i can't do it go get somebody else i'm not able i can't even talk right they won't listen to me i mean can you imagine what he's thinking my wife won't listen to me you think they'll listen to me god knows what he's doing he got moses to the place where moses knew he couldn't do it anymore and moses was all scarred up but brother man said that's the condition he wants us to get into then he can use us to be trophies of his grace to display his power to show the power and redemption the power in the blood the power in the word it's not time for us to act like moses i can't speak and i can't preach like brother so and so god calls somebody to minister and because they can't preach like other sons so they won't minister my goodness friends preach whatever god laid on your heart if he called you to preach preach he called you to sing sing i can't sing like sister so i can't sing like brother son so god never told you to sing like them he just told you to sing we get scarred up by rejection and complexes and failures and we get to the point where we feel like we we can't do anything we can't do anything right if we try we're going to mess up that's absolutely the truth that's why you wait for god and when god calls you just move forward by faith and let god let your scar be the masterpiece god allowed heaven to get scarred i don't know how else to say it i i might you say but you're talking about heaven i don't understand how to say it the heavenly dimensions the heavenly realms there was a fall brother ben said sin started in heaven so there was a mar in heaven a flaw a a fall a scrat i don't know what you call it but something happened and god allowed it he come down the earth and he made a paradise and he made perfection so he's so satisfied with it he he went to a rest but it fell when it was marred and never was it wrong outside of god's plan not according to the pencil sketch never was it not what he was trying to achieve every time there was a failure of fall in the heavenly realm in the earthly realm falls all through humanity here's all there's a picture that he's painting there's a masterpiece that he's working on there's something he wants to display and now we've come to the end of time where brother baby says let's not be children but let's be men and women let's realize if god would allow his perfect heavenly realm to fall so that he could show redemption if he would allow his perfect paradise on earth to fall so he could show redemption then what about me could god use my failure to show his redemption could he show could he use my scars to show redemption and the answer is yes it's the scar that makes it the masterpiece well i've got this situation in my life i've got this in my past i have this marriage thing and this relationship thing and this criminal record thing and i've got this and this and this read the bible there's a lot of those things there but each one of them was another image making the great image each one of them was another brush stroke another part another little a sculpted piece in the great wall of the tapestry of god and this whole wall is painting one story and it's the very mind of god the very heart of god the very thought of god amen to show himself to have a bride of his own choosing and show himself to that bride so that she will know him and it's all been redemption there's a redemption there's a masterpiece redemption and you guys are part of the masterpiece redemption do you have scars yeah maybe there's still areas in your heart that are broken and it just won't hold the oil but i want to tell you there's a power here today that'll mend that broken heart if you're something you just haven't been able to get over in your past if there's an abusive situation your own failure or somebody else's failure a church failure or whatever if there's something that's left in your life and there's a crack where all the golden oil of love keeps seeping out i want to tell you there's a god here today right now that can mend that place in your heart so that you can hold the golden oil of love god allowed the crack to come but he allowed the crack to come so that he can be the hand that mends the crack so that your scar will then display his love your scar will then show his faithfulness your scar will show his power i invite you this morning let the great healer heal your hearts don't hate all those cracks stop hating them stop hating your past stop hating you know i don't think paul was ever proud of what he did i don't think paul was ever i think he was always disappointed but he didn't allow it to stop him from moving on with the plan of god there's all kinds of things that have happened to us we could probably stand here for another two hours just mentioning all ways that people get damaged and scars come afflicted by others and inflicted by ourselves but i'm telling you there's a power here to heal because that's the image he's trying to paint he's trying to take you that have been cracked and he's trying to seal up that crack will i have a scar yeah that's the point the point of the scar is to make it the redemption masterpiece so that everybody can see redemption if there's no scar there's no evidence of the handiwork of god we've been all scarred up but there's a great power that's here to heal the one that healed paul can heal you the one that would get moses back into action is here to get you back in action the one amen that would that would restore david after he was fallen is here to restore you remember the greatest kingdom that that israel ever had there was a type of the golden age the type of their millennium was solomon's kingdom is that right but look how solomon arrived on this earth look at what happened with his mother and father and and the the the degrading event that took place the shame that was on the family his mother bathsheba was married to uriah the hittite amen and david took her for his own while he was out fighting a battle and then conceived an idea to have him murdered so that so that he could cover up his sin but god exposed it all and the first baby died and the very next baby to be born amen after uriah has died after the after uh the baby died amen david and bathsheba are now husband and wife and david goes to comfort her and she conceives and brings forth solomon solomon has a mark on his life from his very birth but nathanael the prophet shows up that day like he doesn't for any other of the births that's recorded in the bible we have no other recording of nathanael the prophet showing up at the birth of one of david's children like he did for solomon because solomon's coming out of a horrible situation it's ugly and can you imagine what everybody else in the kingdom thinks this child will never amount to anything look at how he's come look at what's happened look at his mom look at his dad look at the sin look at the murder here comes this little baby out of a mess and the prophet shows up it says god has called him jedediah whom the lord loves call him jedediah why because he was the chosen one the one god had chose to be the successor the one that god had chose to be the great king that was going to type the millennial reign of jesus christ and you would think god how could you you knew it was going to happen you knew he was going to come why didn't you protect bathsheba why didn't you let why did you let uriah ever be born why was she married to begin with because the story shows god's grace in god's election and god's choosing amen you may have a story that's that bad or worse but if god chose you he loves you you chose for a purpose and nothing that not none of the scars or failures or mistakes none of it will stop god's purpose from taking place in your life nothing will stop god from using you to display the masterpiece of his redemption i say god you can have me broken tattered scratched bruised torn some people did it to me and i've done it to myself but lord may every scratch testify of your goodness may every scar testify of your mercy may everyone show how beautiful your grace is in your plan of redemption in this day may everything display your masterpiece can my scars here's the question can my scars in my life make me god's masterpiece ask yourself the question can my scars that are in my life can that make me god's masterpiece and the answer is yes but you need to let him you need to just trust him not sitting back and making excuses or allowing the devil to bring torment but allow the grace of god to take its effect allow the plan of redemption to bring us up and make us the masterpiece that he wants to display to the world and he's got a bride that's been washed by the water of the word she's not been prairie but she's been made perfect by the word and now she comes into subjection to the word so that that word can manifest through her life and you can say it's coming through a life that had been marred as a child but it's still coming through it's coming through a life who had a dad he was an alcoholic they're coming through a life of a former alcoholic a drug addict a prostitute mary magdalene was called having seven devils and brother bam said she was a street prostitute but yes she was the first one to see jesus in the resurrection she became a trophy of his grace and she began to display to us the church has been released from the seven devils of the denominations in the church ages it all has a purpose it's all for god's great image it's all for god's great picture that he's painting just let him take you and heal the wounded places and pour the oil of love back in your heart and let him put you back on his mantle don't take yourself off of there it's his grace that puts you there it's his love the scar is what makes it the masterpiece paul he was moved into action by his failure i say god move me into action by my failure don't let my failure keep me out let my failure push me in my need for you my need for deliverance my yes we have needs for deliverance we need god delivers we need god to free us we need god to give us strength we need god to help us overcome we need it but don't let our need keep us from god let our need push us to god so that he can lift us up and make us a trophy of his grace god bless you all let's stand let's stand when we stand as the musicians come i want to read one more scripture out of revelation revelation chapter 5. revelation chapter 5 verse 9 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof to for thou was slain it has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth this is the song of the redeemed do you know why they can sing this song because they needed to be redeemed they they needed to be redeemed they needed to be saved they need to be lifted out of corruption they needed to be washed they needed to be sanctified they needed to be filled with the holy ghost they needed redemption and god was going to create a need so that he could meet the need so that what was inside of him could be on display and inside of you and me god allowed circumcised could god create corruption no did god create evil no but he said it in a way that it could corrupt itself and it could be corrupted by choices choices others make choices you made and god allowed it to come into corruption and brokenness to create in us a need and when we have a need then god shows up with the one that can meet every need and when he meets the need now whose handiwork is on display the devils are gods now who was showed off who's demonstrated their power and their glory is it the devil is it you you couldn't do it the devil all he could do was push you into the hand of god and then god would pick you up by his redemption and healing and say this is what i always wanted to show myself mighty on your behalf to show my power to show my might to show my love to show my grace praise be the god i will now therefore glory in my infirmities for when i am weak then am i strong those things that i think about when i was a child and things i've done through my young young life i just shudder sometimes at the foolishness that the pride at the horrible choices that i made and the damage that i've done to myself and others you look back and you just shudder but if it wasn't for that i wouldn't know what great need i had and i wouldn't know what great powerful savior that i have and i wouldn't understand the power of the word that's been released in this day because the power of that word has re-freed me from every one of those things that were trying to hold me back it's the thing that pushes me to god it's the thing that keeps me close to god and is the thing that causes me to sing his praises day by day because i couldn't do it but he did it so he took my picture of a beat up tossed around boy that was drunk from pillar to post and all these terrible things that you would look at and say they were terrible i'm saying they were wonderful because where i'm at now [Music] now i know my god and i know his power and i know he can deliver and i know he can save and i know he can heal and i know not because brother branham said it i know that he can heal a broken heart and pour the oil of love back in and i know by experience that there's still a scar but i know that behind that scar is the golden oil of love that god poured in because he healed now i don't look at the scar with disdain i look at it with love for my maker i don't look at my past with hatred and contempt and spite if you look backwards like that you're always going to be walking forward that way too but i look at my life as the tender hand of jehovah driving me to the promised land and i look at it as a power that only god had to lift me out of such in may all my failures display his glory may all my scars look at my scars you want to see a scar let's look at scars why do you want to look at your scars because i've been healed that's a sign of healing i was wounded i was bitten by the lion amen i would i was trying to be taken by by the violence of the demons amen i i'll show you my scars you want to compare scars i'll compare scars because my scars show the goodness of god and the glory of god i don't hate them they're what make it the masterpiece be the masterpiece that god wants you to be if the devil is still trying to use the past to hold you down amen let god cut those strings today there is no reason god didn't allow it to happen amen for your destruction he allowed it to happen for his glory let him be glorified come to him say lord i need that power that can heal a broken heart and i need that golden oil of love that can be poured back in and held and a heart that's been mended i need you to free me from the consequences of my own actions i need you to free me from what others have done and what i've done i need your glory to be made manifest in this vessel let's just bow our heads let's just reverently just meditate there's none of us have gotten through life without scars there's not a one of us who have traveled for some distance in this life that doesn't have a mark indicating a flaw a failure an injury [Music] but all the power of god is here the presence of god is here to set free the power of god is here to heal the love of god is here to restore oh if we could just turn from all of those negative things and begin to see it in the positive light god had intended before the foundation of the world when he wrote our names in the lamb's book of life he knew we'd read we would need redemption so he wrote our name in a book of redemption from before the foundation of the world we've already looked to the end of the book and we see that the saints are crying and praying of god who's redeemed us of every tongue and nation and hast made us kings and priests we shall reign upon the earth god you have made us kings and priests you have redeemed us you have made us trophies of your grace god forgive us for holding on to things we should have let go of years ago forgive us for allowing the devil to yank us around by failures and mistakes wounds god we're coming to you now to trust you to know that this is part of your beautiful story of redemption this is part of the reason there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world because we would need it now we come to you oh god we ask god that you would heal i pray that you would move in every heart that's wounded lord this morning everyone that just seemingly can't get over the past can't break free i pray that you'd come now and break the yoke of bondage in the name of jesus christ set your captives free may they know more amen have the blinders on but may you lift them high so that they can see a plan of redemption that stretches from eternity to eternity god you've got everything under control everything's on cue your your masterpiece is coming along on time everything is being fashioned just right god is coming to that great image of that redemption plan you had before the foundation of the world help us lord to yield ourselves into your hand that you as the master craftsmen can craft us into the masterpiece and may we rejoice lord in the scars for the scars are what make it a masterpiece i thank you lord for your redemption thank you for your salvation i thank you for your healing i thank you for your deliverance i thank you for what you have done i thank you for what you are doing i thank you for what you will do lord let your people go free let us climb above all the negative and recognize a greater plan that preceded all the devil's plans all the devil done has walked into your trap and you're about to spring the trap and catch him unawares and bring a destruction help us lord to yield to your hand bless your people lord heal the lord i pray in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you friends i worship you oh my god there is none [Music] that is what i want to do i give you praise for you are my righteousness [Music] you [Music] is that [Music] you is for you are my righteousness [Music] you as we leave i just want to remind you we'll be back for communion at four o'clock this afternoon as you go don't ever lose sight of the fact that god is the mastermind behind the masterpiece and everything in the past that has looked wrong we found out's been right it looked like it was ruined but it wasn't ruined it was just there to display another step in redemption something else was going to come forth there was another a level of understanding another level of of art that was going to come forth from god so as we leave here don't ever let the devil tell you that what you're going through now and the troubles and the struggles that god doesn't know what's happening or this is some mysterious thing that's happening to you but god is still working his great piece of art he's still the mastermind behind the masterpiece and in this end time he will have a masterpiece bride on display we may go through rough things difficult times rejections persecutions failures of men failures of loved ones failures of churches who knows what we'll go through but don't ever from this day forward forget that there's a mastermind behind the masterpiece and everything is moving towards that image he had in his mind of what he wants to display don't lose heart don't give up don't pull back just trust him under his under the hand of the great sculptor everything will work out just right and in the end it'll be the most beautiful picture of redemption that displays the beauty that was locked inside of god is now on display god bless you as you go friends we'll see you this afternoon for communion if
