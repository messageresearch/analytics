open up the ears of our understanding we give you all the praise all the Liberty to move among us this evening in Jesus precious name with much Thanksgiving and praise amen the Lord bless you you may be seated I just appreciate all of you so much I appreciate apprciate brother Chad for the invitation to be here with you and uh as always it's my my honor to be standing with Saints of like Precious Faith it's my honor to be sharing God's word with you and um so I really appreciate the invitation and uh he spoke to me last year and and asked me to come but I just couldn't make it and um so um this year seemed more uh conducive to our life there in Durban South Africa and I'm I'm thankful that God made a way for us to be here so um I I've got nothing new everything has been revealed I've got nothing special that I can give you all I have is to share my excitement and uh I I like something I heard brother Chad say so I just want to give you a little um sort of idea about this weekend so we're just going to have fun that's what he says so uh this evening and tomorrow evening we're just going to have fun with the word uh and to say that lightheartedly but I just I feel like sons of God Daughters of God need to enjoy the word and yes we have Services where we we speak about serious things that might be Sunday uh but there's such things to be excited about and um like I said when I was when I was here last I grew up in the message I've seen the growth of the message from its Inception in South Africa uh I've had a mentioned to the brothers brother brother Lonnie Jenkins I've never said this before here made a great impact on my life as a youth you visited um Newcastle uh when I was about 16 years old and when the word begin to make an impression and uh so if some of you didn't know he made a great impression in my life especially to give me that hunger for teaching the word and um so and there were many other brothers who came through but he was a special one of them and so I just want to be able to say that this evening so I'm I'm really um when I spoke to the youth last night I said to them I actually came to speak to to them the whole weekend I told them you know I'm not really interested in the older people uh because they've had their time of fun right and they've enjoyed the message but then some of the adults they said we're still youth so um I just meant it light-heartedly but my desire and I found in me the passion that God has placed in my heart is for the young people and uh in the scripture it said it told the disci it told the Hebrews to preserve the word keep the Commandments means to preserve the Commandments and how do you you know what preserve is it's like you add salt in something and make it last longer you put it in a refrigerator that's how you preserve something today in terms of food but how do you preserve something for a perpetuation for every generation you teach the youth that's what and in in the in the Hebrew law every Manchild had to present himself in the Tabernacle every year at least three times a year why because he had to be taught the truth right and this is it and I feel like that's that's my passion that's what those ministers did for me when I was growing up and that's what I want to do so um we're we're teaching something today and tomorrow and uh uh I I my desire is to is to make make the youth and and some of you maybe most of you already know all these things and um but it's to make you understand reality that we have in this world and one subject that makes us understand the reality of what's going on with us and that's what we want to we want to speak about today so um I'm are we ready brother all right so I want to uh read the scripture first uh let's see if it's on the screen uh we're going to read from 2 Corinthians CH 12 verse 2 2 Corinthians 12:2 it says I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth verse four how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which it is not not lawful for a man to utter Amen in the next scripture Mark chapter 9 verse 43- 45 Mark chapter 9 verse 43-45 and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched and If thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt that is lame into life than having two feet to be cast into into the fire that shall never be quenched amen the Lord had a blessing to his word you read those scriptures and you think how is this going to be fun right so um I want to um brother is it all right there we go so the subject I want to speak on is the seven dimensions the dimensions and I don't know if your your pastor has preest it I'm sure he has I'm sure that other ministers would have spoken it but this is a special uh has always been a special Revelation to me as a young man to to get this right uh and that's why I want to share it with the young people I want to make it as real as possible make us move away from fantasy into what it is exactly and we would never know these things unless the prophet U made many statements now you know the prophet didn't take a special subject and say we're going to speak on the dimensions he just you just find all these quotes all over the place right so for a title the truth about planes of existence the truth about planes of existence so the reason for that is if you look at Dimensions they are not places a dimension we've been led to think that heaven is a dimension it's a different place somewhere else far away and hell is under the ground like most Christians believe can you believe that they they think hell is under the ground The Serpent of the the the Devil is a lizard likee creature with horns and a tail and hoof for feet and a three-prong fork in his hand and um his demons are running around chasing people who died in sin and there's fire burning right and all of these things and okay that's hell how about all the fantasy that Christians have about heaven and it's false it's all false and if you still have those beliefs your understanding of the seven seal is wrong if you can't clear up Dimensions you get everything wrong amen right so they are they are not places that's the thing they are not places that are disconnected from each other that you need to be transported by some Supernatural capsule from here to that place right and um there are planes of existence that are all connected yes Heaven is connected hell is connected we want to know how they're connected every single Dimension is connected to your existence to your reality amen all connected so I'm going to show you uh and those of you who did some mathematics at school some of the children are going to enjoy this as well so uh you've seen this a cube and you know this Cube has length bread and height and that's what makes up a cube so you're looking at a cube and it's made up of three dimensions one thing is made up of three dimensions these are mathematical Dimensions right and that's easy to see but are these Dimensions disconnected they're connected for for that thing to exist you have to have three dimensions connected and you understand it very well because if there were not connected then you who are Body Spirit and soul are something strange you are one person with three dimensions to you and you know this the prophet told you this three different dimensions to your existence to your being and you are you have to be those things connected for the body to even have some kind of meaning right so Heaven hell Earth ether are all connected to man that's the the that's the common denominator man is the connection all those dimensions are connected to man they are not places somewhere far off or under the ground are dimensions of existence amen so I want to that's the foundation of of what our understanding or to be I now bear with me uh maybe some of you and this is not insulting maybe some of you come from a Catholic background maybe some of you come from a Pentecostal background Methodist Lutheran Episcopalian whatever it is maybe you're from a Hindu background maybe you're from Islamic background and and if you read all those religions all those religious beliefs all those Christian beliefs all of them is based on fantasy yeah right every single last one of them is based on fantasy which is why the rest of the world trying to look at what they believe laugh at everybody because it looks like you're believing in fairy tales and what do what do we say we say you know uh well you need Faith to believe that you don't even know why you believe that uh if you come from there and you still have those beliefs so if you were in Catholicism the reason why the doctrines were created the teachings were created why pergatory was created by the Catholics why certain rights and rituals and prayers and baptisms because they had understandings of heaven and hell that terrified them that's right amen and those denominations carried over and then you come into the message and you still have those if I ask some of you now to close your eyes and think of God in heaven you're going to have a picture that you saw in Sunday School in a book if I ask you to close your eyes and imagine Howell you immediately have a picture of something which proves that in your mind and when you hear something when you sing a song uh of the Resurrection or of Heaven of the Rapture or something your mind is creating images which is actually fantasy right and and when we when we kneel down to pray and maybe that's okay but when we get get to the opening of The Seven seal the seven Thunders the mighty Angel descending placing one foot on the earth one foot on the sea and you operate by fantasy you're you're going to miss the truth which is why people cannot see what is happening today this is why many message Believers tragically do not see the opening of the seventh seal because they don't have Dimensions right they're going to ask you questions but uh the cloud that's just his head where is his body body what kind of question is that why would you have that question because you don't have Dimensions correct and where are the dead Saints according to Christ the dead Saints are not dead they don't need to be resurrected from death into life they're already alive we do not hold them back who are asleep right right and if you don't have Dimensions correct you're going to mess everything up and if you mess everything up it means your faith is Tainted tainted means it's weak which means anybody else who comes with a convincing argument is going to win you over right because what you're believing is actually a convincing argument right so how about the truth amen the truth about PLS of existence so these um Heaven hell Earth ether all form part of man's existence and when when we look at Earth and ether it's like your body realm right um heaven and hell because Earth and ether is what your body uh contacts everything on Earth in the dimension of Earth we're going to speak about that just now but your body connects to that your body connects to Ether whatever you speak goes into The Ether right you get uh communication to your ear Through The Ether if ether didn't exist you wouldn't be hearing anything if there were no waves e uh uh here for those waves to be transmitted you wouldn't hear so it's very much connected to the body realm but when you look at Heaven and Hell those are connected to your spirit and your soul that's what your soul picks up that's where influences come from they are connected to you how are they connected to you if Heaven is someplace far away in the Galaxy or if hell is some deep hole under the ground so what we also want to know is where do these things come from why did we why were we indoctrinated with these things where did we get these beliefs from right and this is a time if we say we have the open book we need to know the truth we need to put aside we need to be brave we need to step into Jordan by faith amen we don't need to be afraid to be wrong amen if we're wrong we're say we're wrong God teach us some more right but we're not going to be afraid to this is because I'm telling you this because I I went through this in life I saw Ministries that were afraid to be wrong afraid to step in because of fear of being wrong and what they came up with was stay with the ABCs don't get into the deep things it's too dangerous because it's going to destroy you well staying with the ABCs destroyed them because no Son of God who who has to come to adoption can come to adoption with ABCs so let's look at the interconnection right let's go to John 3:13 you don't have to turn in your Bibles you can follow up in the screen so we can move quicker John 3:13 now look at how you need to understand this and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven now that son of man was standing right there on Earth and he says no man can Ascend up to heaven except he who came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven what is he talking about he is the son of man he is on on Earth but says he's in heaven which means can you imagine the faces of the Pharisees can you imagine the disciples most of the time they didn't know what he was talking about they kept asking for explanations because of the fantasy that they had believ in so he was in heaven and we know this phrase he was Heaven and Earth embraced brother baram said God and man met and joined that's what the son of man was amen God and man met and joined what is God he is heaven what is man man is Earth met and joined the marriage of Heaven and Earth glory to God and he was the first fruits of that he was he who are we as the bride we're supposed to become him what is becoming him we need to become Heaven and Earth met and join God and man met and join Heaven and Earth Embrace if you don't have Dimensions sorted out you're going to miss that whole thing glory to God so man and God met en Joy now I want to I'm I'm not going to read you all the quotes because I know you've read them I'm just going to give you the references and if you want you can get it from your pastor as well uh it's firstly all over the scripture dimensions are all over the scripture except you just don't see the word Dimensions right but they're there and brother bam when he speaks opens up that language to us so we understand what it is you'll find quotes in glorified Jesus preached 1955 present stage of my Ministry is one of my favorites it's just amazing on the way here on the plane I listen to it over and over again just to to understand more about it to see if I missed anything and I enjoyed it so much all over again uh the countdown message speaks about dimensions in influence Chicago Illinois U 1963 these are many of the of the main main messages uh just like four of the main messages where he speaks specifically about Dimensions actually kind of lays it out which one comes after the other and what the conditions are and what the characteristics are and he gives some examples about it but then there's places all over the message where he just mentions things everywhere that's right right so there is confusion and the confusions of the dimensions is what we want to look at and I'm not sure if you you're going to be able to see this clearly I hope can here's where it all started and it started with the Hebrews the Hebrews are the cause of all the trouble for us regarding the dimensions because when um they went into captivity of Babylon and they started learning Babylonian uh uh teachings and uh Babylonian religion which you find came from the Sumerians and U became part of the zoroastrian religion from Zoro as the prophet and you if you read zor Aster's teachings you're going to find an abyss and a beast in the abyss and a hierarchies of angels and hierarchies of demons and uh you never find in the Bible what the names of the seven of all seven archangels are you're not going to find who's the highest one who's the middle one what this one does and yet the Hebrews have an understanding of hierarchy of angels what you find in the talmud and other writings that they have rabbis speak about them and they become so crazy about it they'll be able to tell you which um which uh Angel does this and which Angel does that and which one is affecting you and which one heals you of this and which one but that's not in the Bible there a Babylonian doctrines right and while in there they made a diagram about a few hundred years or something before Christ an understanding they drew it out what they think Heaven and Earth was and it will shock you what they believed so they didn't know about a universe they didn't understand that there was a universe out there right they had no telescopes they had no vision they took Moses's writings from Genesis to Deuteronomy and they drew an understanding that they had and this understanding went all the way up believed by the church accepted by the Catholic Church all the way up to Galileo galile when the telescope was formed and Galileo galile who was said to be a heretic because he looked at what the Catholic church was teaching the Christians and said what you've been teaching was wrong because we can see past the clouds and the angels are not sitting on the clouds and God is not sitting on the clouds we can see beyond that now and then they had to scramble for belief so have a look this is what the Jewish tradition was can you see that they believe that the whole universe is just a ball a sphere and there is Earth and can you see that this band you you can see right above they've got God which is heaven of Heavens you'll see that in in the scripture and then there's the Gate of Heaven right down the center and then on on uh there Waters above the firmament and they believe well that's what caused the flood because there were there was this band protecting the Earth because there were Waters flowing in between God and the clouds and the sun was in our atmosphere can you see it clouds in our atmosphere and the Moon in our atmosphere and all the stars of the sky are in our atmosphere they believe the universe is a dis like that and all these things are moving within that sphere now look at what they believe hell is that black spot in there under the ground they called shol which in the writings of Enoch apparently was the pit now can you see there are four segments of the pit right Enoch's writings if you ever read The Book of Enoch which I do not recommend because we don't know what happened in there but I I did read it because youth questioned me about it and it's mad they can make quite a good science fiction movie Out of The Book of Enoch because the stories in there and the stories in many other things of Adam's first wife was Lilith and she was a succubus who prayed on the on the the the the body of men and his second wife was Eve so they believe Lilith was was in Genesis 1: 126 can you believe the Hebrews believe this they made us up in Babylon and then uh Genesis 2:7 man man married Eve who was his second wife and there's there's legends that they have as to as to why things happened the way they did and what the Gentiles were that's why they hated the Gentiles because they believed we are the seed of The Serpent and they were pure race right right and U they believe um sh was divided into four segments can you see it's a deep hole there the pit that's where your Christian theology comes from the pit and that Satan is living they had no idea about the core of the earth and uh so on one side of the pit was uh the sleeping Saints and uh one side was the demons and the the one part was was Satan and then the one part was those who were who died prematurely like Abel whose blood was was crying out from the ground and the they were trying to make sense of scripture but this led to the fantasy that we have today right this is for more than uh 3,000 years it's what they believed 3,000 years of mankind genetically it's encoded into you so naturally when you close your eyes and try to imagine you're going to see what was passed down by your ancestors right furthermore this progressed or digressed to the early church teachings and influenced by Gentile heathens so when Gentiles started reading the Bible and heard how the Hebrews were were preaching now I I must add that the disciples and apostles were Hebrews the only one who was correcting what they were saying was Paul which means they were teaching whichever churches they go to whatever questions they were answering from their Hebrew belief amen all they were told was teach the gospel um uh uh teach the resurrection teach the crucifixion there is life after death and that why do you think they were so mesmerized when Christ rose from the dead what happened what happened to him in shol how did this work you know uh um did he climb out of the pit can you imagine what their fantasies were like and the graves were opened Church beliefs some of you might laugh at this one this is a picture of souls under the altar which many message Believers have a problem with which brother brandham himself thought there were actual physical Souls under the altar until God showed him something amen and then he even thought he had a wrong idea of who they were that's right there is no alter Brazen literal to Brass altar in a dimension of heaven where souls are hiding under crying for vengeance how can you be in the dimension of the word crying for vengeance think about that right so these are and this is one aspect this is one image I've showed you which passed down all the way through even the Protestant churches believing in this that there are these Souls crying for vengeance crying to be Avenged of what was done to them according to the prophet all those who died uh who were crying for vengeance were were not in that Dimension and we have to tie those things together amen are you with me yes sir all right let's move on so I just want to again tell you if it's something you've never heard before or something you didn't see exactly the same way if it's not exactly wherever you come from whatever your pastor teaches I'm not here to change that I'm just sharing my excitement amen because of what it's done for me and how it's opened up my eyes to everything else and that's what I'd like to share and if it's wrong I'm willing to learn amen so these confusions of these Dimensions if you look at it brother brandham first understood if you can't read that don't even look there just follow me brother Bram first understood Heaven and Hell by Pentecostal teachings I'm going to show that to you right until God revealed Dimensions to him over the time of his ministry there wasn't even a single time in his ministry where he had everything right that's right and he admitted it so don't tell me I'm correcting the prophet he corrected himself which allowed me to correct myself amen amen he preached the coming of the Lord the resurrection and many other things based on Pentecostal understanding right which was pertinent for its time my dad was a a pre PR in Assemblies of God before he became um and that is Brother Steve before he became uh a Believer message believer and I remember the uh Pentecostal days I remember the Evangelical preachings of fire and brimstone I remember scaring people half to death that if they don't accept the Lord Jesus Christ Christ now they die tomorrow they're going to be burning with fire and it's going to be so hard they're going to call out for Abraham to dip his finger and cool their tongues because that's how they saw the scripture and they literally saw it as fantasy in that way how does a Spirit cool his tongue with actual water right now you know that but what happened when they were in Pentecost everything was so real to them like a fantasy movie I was standing uh as a a young person I was standing in a Christian bookstore uh well almost 30 years ago and uh I I walked in there and they had a video playing of the the end of the world and were like these people running around with triple six literally printed on their foreheads and there were people chasing them with axes and sword and there was a guillotine and all those people who were sons of God were being beheaded by these people with the mark of the beast and uh I I'm standing there and there were other Christians there were just shaking their head that time you know and like triple six on their foreheads triple the the movie makers literally showed triple six in the right hand triple six here planted on the forehead and and and this this world that's that's darkness and demons flying around it's ridiculous amen and I stood there feeling so sorry for them and then I thought Lord how grateful we are and it was only a teenager so grateful for the prophet and I don't have to live in fear of this thing amen man once the seals were opened something opened in the prophet that's right and it required a a higher understanding so you've got to understand speech brother Ram's speech in the message it's important to know which Ministry he is speaking in different times so there's times where in the ministry he's speaking Evangelical way in an Evangelical way to Pentecost there's times where he's doing exactly that warning them of hell he was called to do that to get them to the altar it was the Pentecostal age it was a church age right we are not in a church age that's right just clear up for those who think we we believe in an eth day with an eighth messenger and one of us is an eighth messenger and all that no no no the Capstone Age The Bride age is not a church age we're not saying there is another church messenger we are not in a church age if you believe a Third Exodus there was a first Exodus God taking a nation out of a Nation Israel out of Egypt a second Exodus where God took a church out of Israel and a Third Exodus where he takes a bride out of a church that's not the Rapture or the translation it is part of the Rapture but we've been taken out of church ages into a bright age there's no eighth messenger we never said that I don't know why we're accused of having said that I don't know who said that but we are not looking for some eighth messenger we are the bride the bride has a Ministry before the translation and our messenger is Christ the prophet told us that our husband is our messenger and he's with us he calls us his bride we become his wife because we are married to him what do we mean by married to him we mean Heaven and Earth embracing we mean Dimensions coming together because that's what was promised from the beginning that's what we mean we're not under some illusion yes sir of of making another church agent making one man's Ministry special that's not if they're telling you that about us they're lying they don't even know anything what we're saying maybe they haven't even listened to us clearly that's right amen so we're not a movement the bride is not a movement movements died and failed a long time ago we are we are an experience that man was looking for for a very long time that's right glory to God so we need to understand brother bram's speech right so I want to go to brother bram's first idea of Heaven I love this prophet he is the most honest I had ever seen if he was wrong he said he was wrong he told us how he believed he corrected himself he had the humility why shouldn't we why do I need to behave like I know everything right brother Mam's first idea of Heaven this is things that ought to be and this is uh paragraph 42 and I do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about I believe that heaven has grow I believe that the church has grown from that yes sir have you grown from that right to think it used to be he says a 100 years ago or two I think the old times used to think that everyone that died went up to heaven and had a hop and set up there on the clouds and played a hop and they know that there was a place called heaven and they if they be so all the musicians would have it on us that's brother brother R's humor he saying all the gifted people would be up there the ones who can play music if everyone had hops he's trying to tell you I can't play a hop all the musicians would have it on us right but if they be so so it isn't playing Hops at all I believe I don't believe the Bible teaches that but that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the word come into existence amen or the opening of The Seven Seals he's telling you the opening of The Seven Seals needs to bring you the truth about heaven glory to God what more do you need there is one quote which tells you the reality of Heaven should change for you after you see the opening of The Seven Seals see that we didn't make this up the prophet is saying that right so there was his first understanding of hell you're going to see here uh 1957 right we read the quote from 1965 this is 19 57 thirsting for life what's the trouble today we've got too many weak pulpits that's afraid to preach an eternal burning hell there it is right and to warn the people of things and letting the church go just as slothfully and sloppy now if I preach I know this because I preach dimensions then a brother comes and tells me you false because brother Brandon preached an eternal burning hell now as he progressed you know first thing he said is there's no Eternal burning h hell right because God changed his Revelation now he says in 1963 Souls that are in prison CU you see the Judgment isn't now there is no burning hell now somebody tell you the guy is in burning hell now that's wrong of course during that time he had major conversations with the denomination and told them you can't have an eternal hell because if people are in there for eternity you know it then they have eternal life and eternal life is God and God canot be in hell so you know that so can you see that he's understanding progressed from the early part of his ministry he was preaching from a Pentecostal background it was needful when it was the Elijah Ministry smashing Ahab and Jezebel and calling for the elect but when it switched to the Eliza Ministry the seven seal had to open the seals had to be revealed and things had to change for a bride because she had to be called out by this new Revival of the open book descending glory to God so what do we believe now what we believe now affects our understanding of everything number one the Rapture if you don't get Dimensions right you don't get the Rapture right right you don't get the resurrection right you're going to be still confused but brother Chad what about the bodies how will it happen what about Jesus's body what happened here what what happened I don't understand I'm confused why are you confused because you don't have Dimensions right the translation what's it going to be like what was Elijah's Chariot was it a real Chariot does God have real horses of fire in heaven pulling a chariot is that what elishah saw what was it so if you have fantasy you're not going to know you're going to be confused you're going to be expecting that yes I know there's quotes where brother bandam talks about horses he's talking about the Saints coming Enoch talks about it yes we know all that but now the seven seal is opened amen the reality of the dimension of Heaven needs to open to you glory to God the seven seal the seven Thunders if everything is like that this is why people don't understand because they're expecting a real angel Christ to come down with uh uh his face shining like the sun with a literal open book in his hand like God needs a literal book made with pages of wood from Earth right and his feet like brass and then he literally stands on the the sea and on the earth which is why many of the original first second generation preachers believed that the seven seal could not be open because the mighty Angel has not literally descended yet so if if it hasn't yes then we are Leia we are Leia we are wretched miserable poor blind and naked there has been no Third Exodus yet we are a church age that's who we are yes sir and everything brother B spoke in 1965 doesn't exist right if you don't have dimensions that's what you're expecting that's right then you're going to make up fantasies about the seven Thunders booming voice all of those things what's it going to do right casting out of demons oh oh my goodness praying for the sick when you don't have dimensions and and most of the people who love casting out demons are actually afraid of demons that's right they use the the the tradition of casting out to overcome their own fear right you don't need to go there and and and and uh uh pretend you don't need to go there and act like you casting out Devils right how do we know you're afraid because you take 10 Brothers with you to sing oh the blood of Jesus hold your hands together everyone eyes closed let's why can't you go alone amen you're terrified you're terrified that you the bride of Christ can be overtaken by a demon if you understand Dimensions you know that when that demon comes into my presence it runs [Music] away they shouldn't be in your church today if they come in here they must leave without us costing them them out we know it from the word if the word is being spoken the word is supreme the word is him how can Heaven and Hell survive together in one place what are demons doing in your church in a bride church I understand if it's in leoda yeah people frothing at the mouth and speaking in some other language and acting weird and and then you got to fight with the thing to come out that's not a son of man Ministry he didn't go there and sing all the blood he didn't chant he didn't have a prayer meeting he came to the demon and said leave him and that's it he stepped on the shore and the demons ran to him and said what do we have to do with you why are you tormenting us that's who you are you don't have to lay hands on them you don't even have to touch them they must run from you if you have Dimensions correct they are afraid of you you don't need to have any fear of them we don't need to have those services to cast out demons what are they doing in your churches when you have the pure word of God something is wrong you need to question that a lot of people don't like that because they like the idea of I don't need to feel powerful to cast out a devil I don't I need to feel powerful to overcome my own failures that's it I already know he said don't you know the demons are already subject to you you you don't need to to be to feel great about that you should rather feel great that your name is written in heaven glory to God preaching salvation will change if you get Dimensions right prayer towards God prayer is such a big thing it's such a victory if you pray with fantasy it's not a victory that's how much this can change your life if you get Dimension straighten out all right so if we don't get it straighten out our faith is weak in all aspects of the word so I don't know where this diagram came from I hear tell part of it was put together by Brother Lonnie Jenkins I don't know or brother bisol or whoever it is but we're going to use it just to have you seen this before no no why they showed it to us in South Africa when they came what happened to you so this was taken by some of those great pioneering Elders in the message and we thank God for them they put this I saw this back when I was a teenager of course it was a little different I kind of uh they had it uh pictures with it and the Seven golden candlesticks they did a fantastic job I just uh simplified it so that you can see things clearly and understand so basically what we have there in the center that that thing that looks like the globe that's Earth according to what brother bandham teaches that is light matter time we are living in three dimensions of light matter time and if you're going upwards the regions of Angels the region of the Blessed is the sixth Dimension seventh is God dimensions of existence seventh is the existence of God Amen sixth is the the existence of angels and the existence of the the the the Blessed who have died and are there in the sixth Dimension it's the existence of theophany right and incomplete theophany hold that thought then The Fifth Dimension the tells us was is divided was divided into four we'll talk about that just now uh which that little corner there I've got paradise and then is the regions of the lost that is those who died without believing or rejecting the word regions of demon Spirits lower than that and Hell itself which is Satan amen the father of all lies right so this is where we are and this is how brother bandam kind of sets it up in present stage of my Ministry and he speaks about it saying going up this way going down this way and he sets it this is how it is right so that I want you to imprint it in your mind tomorrow we're going to use the same diagram to show you how the dimensions shifted and changed from the beginning till now that's why I say we're can to have lots of fun with it all right so Dimensions here's the important facts the number of Dimensions vary with regard to each person who speaks about it so Christ spoke certain things about Dimensions spoke about heaven he spoke about hell he spoke about Earth Paul spoke about uh the first second third heaven three dimensions remember we read in the beginning which one it was we don't know right and then we have brother Bram who came and spoke about seven dimensions when Paul spoke of the third heaven he based it upon access right in other words a first Heaven which you can get to First a second one so it wasn't like uh first was on the top and second below and third below he spoke about it as access right so and that's how brother bham put it there as well and I'll explain that when brother brandom laid it out mysteriously he did the same thing he put it according to access to go upward there's the sixth first then the seventh right in other words if if I was a theologian and uh because we're we're humans who are mainly OCD all the time we want things to be according to certain order we'll start with the First Dimension at top and we'll label it 1 to seven going downwards right and brother baram didn't he put seven on the top six beneath 1 2 3 and then five at the bottom and you see on the side there's the fourth dimension which is the dimension of communication okay so 1:7 is now I'm going to tell you the mystery behind how he put it 1: 7 is based on easiest to hardest to access in other words it's you are you are basically now accessing light matter time that's where you're living today man is more able to access the realm of communication and Hell than it is for man to access Heaven All Men on Earth are all accessing communication and they're accessing hell they're accessing hell more than communication so in level of how difficult it is right right and we know this because even you know brother R speaks about the witches and wizards and people who can who are like clevan or uh people who can speak to the dead not the fakers the real ones like the witch of Endor they're actually brother B says they're like a radio that picks up frequencies says those frequencies are moving through the room right now if there's a radio why was he even saying that in the seals because he was a radio picking up a frequency with a gift and there Angels moving through and all he was doing was echoing what was being spoken glory to God so it is easier for man to access hell and communication and we know this since from the beginning the way to the tree of life was blocked right so Dimensions important was not created from the beginning from before the Earth began God didn't create hell hell was there was no hell existence there was no Fifth Dimension when God was creating uh uh the universe the hell was only created after he took Lucifer of the earth that's right you know brother B says Lucifer walked upon the volcanics that's right there must have been some civilization of Fallen Angels before Adam came there and then they messed around with Earth and whatever life there was they put the earth into a without form and void condition because after they were struck down from Heaven they were struck down to earth when they lost their existence they they had an Earthly existence and when God was going to create man he took them out of an Earthly existence and hell was created right and we'll speak more about that just now so not all these these these Dimensions were just there from the beginning waiting to be filled places that just existed right they are Realms of existence PLS of existence hell cannot exist unless there's a creature of hell that's right Earth Light matter time there are creatures of light matter time the realm of angels cannot be unless there are angels angels are in existence a realm of God cannot exist unless there is God it's a realm of existence glory to God so they evolved according to the relationship of God to man don't stumble over the word evolved brother BR says I believe in evolution just not the way they say amen amen things evolve let's get to light matter time so Dimensions 1 2 and 3 light matter time you love him Saints are you having fun all right so where we live right now in the flesh and young people this is why I said it's for you I want you to enjoy this I want you to understand it it's very simple just religion makes it complicated we want to take that away we want to make it simple to understand so where we live in the flesh this is the realm of three dimensions right now as you're sitting in this room there is length there is breadth there is height right and these are three dimensions of measurement at the same time everything in this room consists of light matter and time this is your existence the existence of your body your life on Earth if there is no light there is no existence if there is no matter there is no existence amen if there's no time there is no existence for man all three dimensions have to exist for man to exist it is the existence of mankind it is the existence of nature is the existence of animals light matter time so this is the realm brother bandam says all your senses of the flesh contact right he says there are quotes you contact the dimensions through your senses light is a substance light is not a thing that comes on when you turn a switch on it's a substance science tells us it has partical nature it has a wavelength it reacts differently as it moves through different mediums it reacts differently as it moves through water through glass how it hits Earth light has substance in it God said let there be light it was a thing he created it glory to God and it was created so in other words are you seeing the First Dimension coming into existence at the beginning of creation let there be light right every substance on Earth everything that you look around this Pulpit this microphone your teeth your hair your children the flowers it's all made of different kinds of matter and science is still uh Mesmer there's a whole faculty studying matter which was just created by God amen amen every substance on Earth is made of matter time I love time and I hate it too it's a lie you can't save time you can't waste time stop telling your children you wasting my time because you can't waste time time doesn't care about you time just ticks on and on you can't save time you can't waste time you can't do anything to you it's its own Master right it doesn't wait for anybody it's just ticking away but you don't realize how time affects you do you know you cannot see the Horizon if there's no such thing as time amen you can't have P perspective things moving to a point if the dimension of time does not exist right if someone throws a ball at you as a comes closer you see it getting bigger you see that if there is no time that won't exist it'll look like it's the same size moving at you like that you wouldn't even know it'll hit you in the face what tells you you need to catch it is it's growing larger your eyes picking it up it's coming to hit me time does that right right why because over a certain amount of time it's coming towards you if time doesn't exist there's no decomposition of matter that is died because decomposition occurs over a period of time right if time doesn't exist how is something born and grows we take it so much for granted it's a dimension science even Einstein couldn't understand completely they came up with ctcs they came up with uh movements of time and space continuum and uh traveling they were thinking about traveling backwards in time traveling forwards in time they had a a conference of physicists many years ago to study this thing and he still haven't gotten it right amen the the the atheists believe the Earth is 4 billion years old and they don't believe that God how God created it they don't understand they and maybe they have proof that the Earth is so many billion years old and say no you know Christians believe it it's in six days right uh when Adam was formed in Genesis 2 that was his birthday but he was 21 his first day on Earth he was 21 which mean God can bring something to existence with age with age so how old was the earth you just don't know you just don't know brother bam said quote it could be 4 trillion years we don't know because it existed God created the heavens and the Earth period something happened and then he began to refurbish it for man to live on in the six days of creation furthermore if the sun and the moon and the stars were only put into place on the fourth day then that's where a 24-hour cycle began because that in the fourth day he said these shall be for signs and Seasons so how was the first day 24 hours right right or the second day 24 hours as some Christians believe right and they accuse us of believing nonsense they just don't know because these Christians didn't have Dimensions right they didn't understand Dimensions but we do amen so on the fourth day here comes times and Seasons began which means the dimension of time changed right time actually existed in a different form and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God what was that time like that's like Time and Eternity Blended together in some kind of form we'll never understand but the word says beginning that's right that's right so if scientists depend on carbon dating Argan dating all of that they have to have something called a constant in mathematics if your constant is based on the speed of light moving through the universe now sorry to sound so sciencey I just have to disprove it so that you we get out of the way but if your constant is based on the speed of light now what was time before the speed of light which means everything falls apart with your carbon dating and Argan dating if if the if the the Earth was 4 trillion I don't know I don't even know what years were because this the Earth wasn't revolving around the Sun so it couldn't even be 4 trillion years it's based upon constants of science you older people don't worry about constant it's it's for the young people who do mathematics today I love picking on old people everything that is real to us is made up of this these Dimensions glory to God and it's beautiful isn't it you walk out every day and you appreciate the first three dimensions it's magnificent in every way every day look at how time takes us up in the morning the sun moves to the sky ends the day we have a sleep at night you have any idea there's this beautiful thing called the Circadian rhythm in your brain which your brain works with light if there's no light there's no Cadian Rhythm which occurs in the brain which wakes you up why do the birds wake up in the morning and start chirpping because the sun ignites a cycle in the sucan Rhythm and they start chirpping because and it's light that starts do you know how it works do you know when the light comes in through your window and your brain your circadian rhythm SS a moment and and tells you your bladder needs to empty wake up did you know it's light that does that morning light do you know at Darkness a certain time there's another thing that says it's dark you need to sleep sleep hormone gets in gets uh uh sent out through the brain and you go 9:00 if there were no light what was going to happen light is controlling this night and day is we don't appreciate such beauty and and the things that God has done for us and you know why most of us are stressed because we found ways to make these lights so we lose sleep so you know what happens if you deny the sleep cycle at 9:00 it sets the whole circadian rhythm off put stress on the bladder the digestive system the brain cortisol gets passed down you wake up in the morning your bladder works at 2:00 in the morning wakes you up now you can't sleep right why because we're denying the laws of light matter time oh I could go on let's go on so Earth was in chaos before these Dimensions were put in order amen and so you know the prophet told us this and I I've already explained some of that so each cannot do without the other light cannot do without matter matter cannot do with if there is no light matter will freeze right um I I just explained how you can't do without time matter will not will be out of control if there's no such a thing as time so the dimension of time is not what's happening on your watch that's how we measure it it's way beyond our thinking way beyond our understanding it's it sets you know I was speaking to a doctor because uh I I love speaking to them because they tell me what science thinks they know right now and I wanted to know about age and uh I I said to him so you know about the age of man and uh how long do men live uh he said uh well according to this thing in your DNA strand it's called Tas um man should live no more than 120 years old I said do you know that's in the Bible that was in the days of Noah it was set there and now that thing is depleting because of everything else our diets or denying of all the dimensions and now it's dropped down and it came to David's time and he said three score and 10 right and uh so imagine that science figures It Out by working out chemicals what our AG is and how much of time we have but God already knows that so this doctor told me somebody in the Bible must have studied genetics to get those things so accurate each cannot do without the other what is light without matter to shine through amen what what is that dimension on its own it's it's useless without matter for it to affect what is matter matter would not be seen and appreciated without light you can't have an existence without light time is the mystery because it's annoying but it allows for rest of everything that is not Eternal right everything that is not Eternal exists because time exists right and it's beautiful it's beautiful right now to not be living in eternity because it it it balances out nature things have to die for things to live if there was no time then you're going to have to eat live animals that are going to live inside of you time actually makes death possible so that you can eat that which is D you see that which is d and that you might live from that which has died time is that important and it's important to matter so because of time you can absorb things that you eat and it takes time to digest it and then it grows and your cells develop all that has to do with time it may be annoying to us cuz we can't save it we can't waste it we can't manipulate it in any way but it's working for us day and night so we appreciate it without either dimension oh without all three dimensions Earth would just go back into chaos right either Dimension without light and M or light and time you Earth will be back in chaos right both Heaven and Hell have to produce things in these three dimensions to get our attention right this is why these dimensions are important we can't have some invisible Prophet speaking to us he has to be made of light matter time God has to bring bring a pillar of fire a pillar of cloud he has to bring things within our dimension for us to see he has to uh do things within our dimension for us to hear and Satan has to do the same right if Satan was a literal lizard likee creature on the ground then he doesn't need he can just pop out of the ground right but he's a spirit he cannot do anything without a body to work through you know the prophet says so both both Heaven and Hell need the three dimensions of Earth's existence to make us believe them the fourth dimension a beautiful one I don't want to tell talk too much about it but it's it's wonderful to study how it how we uh connect to it so God didn't create the fourth dimension God created ether ether was working together with light matter time like I told you it's how we hear it's how waves have passed through ether existed from the beginning of time right beautiful uh man has only learned to manipulate ether in the last few centuries now how do we know ether existed brother B told us about how one Prophet sees what's happening there God puts these waveline he explains it like Television right you remember that like Elisha seeing what was happening in in the other King's uh uh country and then elishah is a spy who was a master of ether the gift of Prophecy has got to do with ether because God can transfer things through brain waves through dreams through Visions ether is beautiful because it works for us the baptism of the Holy Ghost can affect ether to make gifts work in the church vibrations if you don't it's it's a shame that Christians don't know these things because the Hindus the Buddhists that have you ever heard Hindus saying om right you see them put their hands together OM they believe it's the vibration that created the universe they believe so much in ether those who are who are in different religions believe the ether works for them spiritually and yet Western Society not just America Western societ is all over the place it's UK it's Europe the West is everywhere the West is Central right so uh Western Society because we've moved away into intellect education and Atheism uh just lost lost that thought they done away with with spirituality don't understand how these things affect us except and then they call all these people who delve in astrology and all those kind of things they call them like you know um uh soothsayers they don't understand there's some reality in there and they're being affected so what did science do they manipulated ether and formed the fourth dimension the dimension of communication right it was not realized before that the realm of communication brother bam calls it science telecommunication television satellit cyberspace can you imagine this realm of existence was created by man you say existence yeah how many of you have a cyber footprint how many of you have an address in cyber space and know address is where people live today more young people live in Snapchat Instagram that's their existence they exist more they can say I love you I'm sorry uh I I care so much for you they can do that on on on on WhatsApp on Facebook in cyberspace Through The Ether but when they face to face they they can't exist in reality anymore in light matter time they exist in cyberspace there's a new existence of human beings in the fourth dimension they hiding in Mom's basement and think that they have a life in cyberspace this is a new existence that occurs because of Technology it's a realm that makes use of invisible waves that exist in the universe amen records brother brandom says it records words actions images and even thoughts that's right yes Lord this Dimension is created by man ether existed from the beginning of time right and now today it has been manipulated by man so let's get to the favorite The Fifth Dimension and I want to start with what hell is not right this is not hell there is no edge of the world where people are falling into fire and this certainly is not the devil forgive me for the artist ression this is not and this is a a mild one compared to what they have uh all those things about you saw the the the the goat beet you know with a five-pointed star his horns are are two parts his ears are two parts and his beard have you seen that the upside down the pentagram right do you know where the legend of bamet came from from the goat that was let loose in the wilderness every time they encountered the goat that was that was carrying the sin they believed it was evil it was baffet that's where the legend came from this poor goat somehow it lived they expected it to die with the sins when they encountered it they had to kill it because it was the devil bringing back the sins and so started the legend of baffet Satanism is a bluff don't let the Pentecostal fool you Satanism is a bluff which depressed kids run after for kicks right they can they can worship Satan they can have a a a shrine to Satan don't be afraid of that it's totally useless it's a bluff if you know anything about demon possession it's all a bluff to create fear for one purpose to make you disbelieve it's a lie it's got no power in it do not believe in that power right it's only got power if you have fear and doubt am if you have no fear and doubt you can walk into a Satan's Shrine it'll do nothing to you there can be some five-pointed star on the floor you don't have to walk around it you can go there and rub it out it's not going to put a spell on you if you've got dimensions in the right place you got no fear no doubt young people don't be afraid don't be afraid of those Gothic children with dark eyes Shadow and black and earrings and nose piercings and they're just troubled people crying out for help the and and and your presence can set them free you don't need to run from them there are souls that crying out for Christ trapped by fear and doubt and abuse and molestation and all of those things you don't need to be afraid you are a son of God and Heaven has come down upon you you you don't have to be afraid of any of those things witches Wizards I I I've live I've lived in Africa I live in Africa I've seen a real witch she when she saw my dad and and my mom uh she was when I say a real witch and she didn't she didn't look like a pointy nose crooked nose with a cap on and no she was just somebody who is a normal person who had the ability to do something to contact the other dimension to know something about certain people one thing I learned about this was that if they tell you they spoke to your grandma who is a believer in heaven they're lying to you because witches have no contact with a sixth Dimension do not believe them anyone says to you that your grandma spoke to them walk away that's a lie right especially if your grandma to beli her if she did speak to them it's a problem it's somewhere else all right The Fifth Dimension which was hell so there's there's two things to know hell before Christ I told you we going to have fun Paradise brother Ram said he taught us there was Paradise and we know this existed because the witch of Endor was able to call up the spirit of Samuel right and she could see into that she was brother maram said she was a real clavant in our language uh right she was she was a medium she was a real medium and U and Saul went to her to to find an uh um a message from Samuel so she could literally call it up and speak to them why did that happened because at that time before Christ had come all those who died job speaks about it they went into a place of Slumber while I'm in Slumber I will have my rest but on that day I will see my redeemer remember all that paraphrasing it was the region of Old Testament Saints who died believing God and they were in a Spirit realm you say well how did she say she saw a man with a bald head and a mantle on because that's what a gift does a gift can perceive a spirit and it shows them a picture right it doesn't it doesn't mean Samuel was literally a baldheaded man with a mantle on stuck in some hole in under the Earth but a person with a gift can see the existence of a spirit what's going to call up is the picture of the person from the way they died that was back then how do we know it's changed because when brother bham saw people beyond the curtain of time they were not how they died something changed do you agree so the region of the Lost is the next SE section going down that is those who died rejecting the word for their day or accepting Satan's lie how do we know this so in the message ement brother man said Christ died he descended into hell and he walked down the corridor he dramatizing it there were those on this side it was a Chasm those on this side who who said that's the one who spoke to me was Noah that's the one who told me to pull the ark this is Abram the one Abram said that's the one who told me about the promise and the people on this side were the ones who rejected the word for every day of those Believers there was something separating them they were not together because these were Believers in cist in God Amen then below that now remember we're not saying there are four flaw in the dimension of Heaven these are four different existences okay this is not hell with you know Satan has a a four-story house no that's not how it works there are four different existences right the region of devil Spirits Fallen Angels who lost their first state and became spirits that seek to cause Discord in the realm of men that's right where are those exps are they under the ground sir sir they're working right here they're in your politicians they're in your government they're the definitely the politicians because everything that comes out of them is a lie and we know who the father of all lies is yes sir what is the meaning of devil liar false accuser the word demon is not even in the Bible the word demon comes from the Greek word Deon which means superhuman someone with Supernatural strength Supernatural ability that's where the word demon comes from so demon we just use it demon and devil but what is a devil really it's a lying spirit so whenever you see somebody possessed with the devil and you're afraid of someone who's ring on the FL like a snake speaking in a different voice uh saying I Know Who You Are going to come for you in your sleep that's a lie that's not a demon that's not a devil where are devils they're behind pulpits preaching the gospel the lying Spirits people possessed with Devils with lying Spirits occur in people like Psychopaths sociopaths are people who are who lie compulsively those are people you pass every day who like uh salesman who like to you that they're selling it to you for for a great price cost price they're selling you a lie why are they selling you lie because they want to taken advantage of you anything that is a lie is of The Fifth Dimension which is why children is always important to tell the truth because the truth shall set you free that's what a devil actually is it's a lie how do we know why do they say to Jesus thou art a devil nobody's doing this to you because there what they're actually saying is you're lying that's what they mean by a devil it's a lying spirit so when you have people there's a difference between afflicted by demons and possessed by demons it's easier to see someone afflicted by a demon because you can see the effects on the body there's depression there's a Darkness they want to talk they're aloof they're going off to substances afflicted by something they're afflicted by a lie and this that is simple it could be from they were molested as children they suffered uh the the tragic loss of something a mother who lost a child and went into absolute depression and is afflicted by a spirit of depression you read demonology brother maram says every disease is accompanied by a spirit a Son of God knows he's healed when the spirit disappears even if the disease is still there and that's why the this grow is here this lady says I'm Healed how does she know because the spirit is departed even though the growth is still there he says in demonology the disease is accompanied by a lying spirit amen but who are the real Devils that you don't know it's the colleague you work with the brother who's teaching you false Doctrine that's right the brother who's convincing you to believe a lie that's not Afflicted that's right that's possessed amen try casting that one out Antichrist amen see we want to cast out people who are afflicted we have depression those people need love amen love casteth out that's what they need they don't need demon possession services but try casting out the liar from a psychopath right from a sociopath from people who use the Bible to twist its words to manipulate people to give them money am try costing that out you can have a service with a thousand people they'll take over you right if you don't know what dimensions really are that's right the realm of Satan is the the depth of lies and deceit he's the father of all lies right so if you really want to know who Satan is and what that Dimension now now tell me where the dimension of Lies is in this world under the ground no it's right here it's connected to man there are humans in this world whose existence is by lies that's right brother bam when he when he was in a hospital bed and and he he he told us he died and he felt his Spirit just falling and falling and falling did he describe fire no what did he say about it this is important right uh he said it was like a nightmare that's all it was like a nightmare it's like have you ever had that feeling where everyone has that dream uh where you're just falling you might actually land on the floor of while you're sleeping but you have this horrible sensation of falling right some people tell me that that their recurring dream is losing their teeth in their mouth I've never had that one I don't know about that maybe that's bad I don't know uh don't want to figure that out but brother B speaks about it he says you like caught between two places and it's it's a horror he uses the word horror he doesn't talk about fire and demons chasing you and all of that no nobody you will not even find that in the Bible all right so anyway what happens is after Christ Paradise is emptied out you know this which means all those Saints which were in that side of the chasm get resurrected and taken where into the sixth Dimension right where they don't have the same existence they had before Christ their existence changed which means the dimension of Hell changed amen and so all you're left with is those last three Paradise was emptied out so let's look at not a burning hell under uh until the Lake of Fire Revelations 2014 when uh the sinner dies his soul is caught between between Earth and Hell in a nightmare that's brother Mam's words what that's what happens when a sinner dies the wrong understanding of Hell came into the church because of the Catholic church right who learned from the Hebrew mythology that they got from Babylon are you still awake all right before Christ don't sleep you might be caught in another dimension before Christ the Jews believed that death was a place of sleep for the soul which they called shol which means the word hell didn't even exist they called it the place of sleep for the soul shio some of them believe that everyone who dies goes to shio they didn't even know there was a Chasm brother brandham tells us there was a Chasm right and um it was never described as a place burning with fire never ever until the church picked it up as time progressed from Moses stories of uh from Moses stories of Hell began to increase until it became something hugely exaggerated and that's what we have today right the Greeks took it up the Greeks spoke about Hades we'll tell you about that now I want to I want to show you where it comes from right when the Lord Jesus spoke of hell if you go into the gospels and you see where he spoke about hell you'll see the word there is the Aramaic word gehna right gehenna not had is not hell gehenna so you study where this comes from and we read this Mark 9:44 says where their worm this is the Lord Jesus saying where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched so I was waiting for this because I know the people who know the scripture and say brother Al hold on a second Jesus said where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched you believe there's worms in hell in ex existence of demons and the fire is not quenched where does this come from let's expose the LIE right gehenna was originally the valley of hom which was outside the Gate of Jerusalem it was south of Jerusalem where the filth and dead animals were burned the fire was not quenched and the worm did not die because it was always burning with carcasses that would dying and Jesus was telling because the Believers or the the Jewish people would not burn or bury criminals and rapists and murderers in the burial grounds of the righteous so they took all criminals all unworthy people and threw them in this Pit Where did the Legend come from I can hear how quiet you are you hear this before right the wicked of the city were cast out and burned because this comes from way back right before the rebuilding of Jerusalem many children and young virgins were sacrificed to Heathen gods in the valley of Kon and this is spoken of in the Bible that's why the Jews believed this ground was cursed many of them came up with a legend of it so let's go to it Jeremiah 7:31 and they have built the high places of toet which is a god of those people which is in the Valley of the son of hom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire that's where they were sacrificing babies and virgin girls in the fire in the Valley of the son of Hino which I commanded them Jeremiah saying I commanded them not neither came it into my heart I don't believe in what they were doing right so after the rebuilding it became the rubbish dump the Refuge site of Jerusalem but people were terrified of it because it was always burning and that's where the Legend of Hell burning was born so when Jesus was speaking of them being cast into the place where the fire is not quenched the worm dieth not he's telling you if you don't live right and if you're going to be a transgressor that's going to be your end in the valley of Kino and what did the Christians do they started believing Jesus said how why would he say that why would the son of man who knows what hell is start a thing where there's fire and worms that do not die many moabites and Jews believe that the Valley of the of hom was the beginning of the pit a cursed place you can go and read it and it's there in the bible Jeremiah says it Jesus Christ Our Lord was referring to what Jeremiah spoke of he didn't so do you agree Jesus didn't make that up he was referring to Jeremiah's reference right when when Christ spoke about the worm that dieth not and the fire is not quenched he was speaking from where from Isaiah again he didn't make up the fire is not quenched and the worm dieth not here's Isaiah 6624 and they shall go and look upon the carcasses of men not the spirits of men in Hell the carcasses of men burning that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh this is where Jesus is quoting from where their worm die what is the worm the worm is a part that takes part in the composition the decomposition of human bodies and the fire is not quenched because they had to keep this pit burning all the time because it had to burn out these carcasses and some of these carcasses took death days until the disease was completely quenched they remember they had a big deal about diseased carcasses that's right right and they were not going to bury criminals in the in where the righteous are buried burial was a big thing to to the people remember Joseph said don't leave my bones in Egypt take me back to the the ground of Heth I want to be gathered to my people amen where the people were gathered and and Jacob died and pulled up his legs and was gathered to his people and this one died and was gathered to his people and that one died and was gathered to his people they were buried in the burial ground that was purchased by Abraham from the sons of Heth is that right that's what they mean gathered to their people so Isaiah 6 say I'm showing you where the Legends began why these Legends mythology Legends are actually nice things uh the the mythology of it and where the Christian church and the Catholic Church took it up without even looking at where it came from uh so some of you if you young people don't realize Jerusalem had no bin trucks they had no refuge dump they had no way to get rid of decomposing things they had a fish gate a sheep gate a dung gate this gate it it had a system for a city to get rid of Filth from the city and the valley of hom on the south was a part of the Refuge that had to be burned so that no contamination had to come into the City and that's what Christ was speaking about where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched Lord there is no literal fire which on on Earth fire is is of matter a type of matter called plasma it there's no literal fire in hell if you talk about fire um how was there Holy Fire where a bush was not burning when Moses saw it because it was not a fire of this Dimension the fire the the pillar of fire was not a fire of this Dimension right and so when he's speaking about fire what do we understand by the worm died not spiritually and the fire is not quenched so spiritually symbolically their worm dieth not the guilty conscience of a person is actually what the worm refers to when Jesus Christ is speaking of the spiritual aspect of it guilty conscience is that worm the fire is the spiritual torment right this the spirit being tormented by the life that you live if you die and you know you rejected God okay you rejected God you rejected his word on Earth you die you go into the existence of The Fifth Dimension there is a knowledge that you are not in a good place you are in the condition of being a spirit without a body you cannot express yourself you know you have rejected the truth you know you are in a place of unrest it's torment you know the wrong things you've done that's the torment personal fire burning in the Bible spiritual burning speaks of Torment of the spirit right have you ever heard it is better to marry than to burn burning in lust that is a torment of lust taken over you right burned with hunger marry them to burn you you you'll read all these things in the Bible they were they burned with Hunger brother man says get the Eastern View and the Bible becomes a new book When Your Eyes Open up and you understand what happened why there's this thing called the pit and the entrance of the pit it was the valley of Kino you love him Saints New Testament the Greeks came in the Romans came in they made this guy called Hades Hades isn't and that's where the English said that's hell but Hades was a mythological Greek god the god of the underworld the one who handled the the death he was respect and he was the brother of Zeus or somebody and the guy from the sea what is his name Poseidon yeah so and and and he was a brother of I don't even want to go into the story it's too complicated but when the English translated it they used used one word and it was hell but the prophet uses the separation correctly death hell and the grave right because of the Bible death hell and the grave separate things right hell is a dimension so the grave is not in existence where people you put their bodies in they they contaminate they decompose and that's the end of it it's not an existence death is not an existence hell is an existence where a spirit is existing without a body a spirit and a soul is existing without a body separation there is death hell and the grave all right so brother bam says in one place you might read this in the message very uh complicated sometimes Christ's body is in the grave his soul is in Hell preaching to the Lost right but there are people who believe the body goes into hell there's a quote brother said the body lay in the grave his soul went into hell to preach to the Lost there's a separation between grave and Hell amen glory to God so here's the truth about hell it's a dimension of man's existence after rejecting the truth are you still with me it used to be after death hell was usually a dimension of existence after death where the spirit went in right but now it is becoming one with those who have rejected the truth while they are living how do we know the pale horse rider comes in in the in the seventh Church age and death in Hell follows with him this actually telling you just before Heaven and Earth become one hell and Earth are becoming one under the Pale Horse wrer it's the perfect time for Heaven to come down glory to God so that Dimension that existence of uh um uh the dimension of demons or devil spirits and Satan is very much alive we know this because brother maram when he when he died he had that vision and then he saw those ladies coming up the escalator remember that and then it occurred to him hell is on Earth whoa it is now a dimension Saints Hallelujah open up your eyes yes sir there are people living right now in Hell sir you think all these things are a mistake it's happening around us I was sharing with the brothers you think all is transgender nonsense gender identity is a mistake no sir no why because it's going right against something God is bringing that's right amen do you not believe she is him hold on those are pronouns you just said she is him that's what they're saying it's happening right now when the open book the bright coming of Christ is taking place except the true feminine nature of God is not claiming to be the masculine she's not trying to overpower him she's not trying to turn physical appearance into a man she's very happy to be the feminine nature of God and accept the masculine who is coming down to become us amen Heaven and Earth becoming one but look what the devil is doing with the very thing you are claiming right now amongst young people this generation is heading there didn't don't think it's happening for no reason after death the existence of spirit and soul without a body that's what hell is Saints there are really depressed people out there in the world yes sir they are living in a Hell their Dimension is light matter time hell we're going to show you that that ex tomorrow we're going to see those things right now there are depressed people do you know how many people in this world today are in anti-depressants if you go I get it every year I make sure I find that I find out exactly which race has more depression which age has more depression what the kids are going through I have a look at I track it I attract the depression I attract the divorce rates I attract the the teenage pregnancies everything I want to know what's happening in the world do you know how high the depression rates are you know demonology what depression is it's Affliction of The Fifth Dimension that's right amen and it's happening all around us there are poor people out there being afflicted by the fth dimension and they need your help you're the only one that can release them from the grip of Lies this is why the truth must Prevail glory to God the sixth Dimension Heaven's realm of angels and the Blessed glorious it used to be the realm of angels right before Earth became man's home after Christ's Resurrection it became the realm of the Blessed when Paradise was emptied out the the those who died in God were taken up in there and received a new existence amen the sixth Dimension is now an extended existence of man right so the same way hell is connected to living people today do you know what it means to be seated in Heavenly places glory to God this is not some figment of our imagination we know all these things remember when brother boswood died did he have to fly into space to shake their hands brother M said he got up in the room started shaking the hands of the Blessed his light matter time was responding to another dimension because his spiritual eye was open up and he could see what was right around him glory to God that sixth Dimension is sitting right here with you the same way hell came in and is affecting people so God brought in heaven down upon us and we are seated those Saints you all they're waiting for is your eyes to be open to them you're not waiting for a time for them to come they're here you're seated in Heavenly places those prophets those sages those um uh living creatures those anointings that's all a dimension of Heaven they're affecting you they're influencing you glory to God all those who died in Christ are living in his Celestial body the sixth Dimension is an extended existence of man so those in this Dimension are not United with the seventh that's right this is the amazing thing I love this because brother M said when he went there he said where is Jesus now remember went there his Spirit was transported into that place I can't explain it I'll be honest I have no idea how that works right I can't explain it but he told us he saw it they were 18 to 21 it looked like an ex existence he spoke about Fields not space he spoke about he spoke about an existence he saw these people and he said where is Jesus and they said he's a little higher that's the seven not that there's a double story in heaven now right why and I love this why are they waiting for us that's right why can they not be perfected without us because day in their life and generation did not come to the marriage of the Lamb what is the marriage of the Lamb it is the combining of Earth matter time with number seven God himself is the marriage that's why to know the dimensions is so important they are waiting for us to combine with seven they join with us and that's why we complete the race for them they without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting for us that's why the marriage is so important to them you're thinking you're waiting for them oh when I see the dead Saints they knock at my door we heard all the stories they knock at my door and then I'm going to I'm going to receive some Supernatural thing and then I'm going to go in the Rapture no sir they're waiting for you they're waiting for your eyes to open up to the marriage of the Lamb to see your husband standing before you to join with your Earthly existence and when that happens they become visible to you because now you've completed the race for them praise be to God it takes the bride to make the sixth and seventh Dimension One how do we know this happens when Christ came to Earth the veil rent in Twain and the two rooms became one this must merge seventh and six have to merge at some point but before that happens we have to marry the seventh Dimension oh Hallelujah this is not heaven am can you see that old man sitting on the throne that is not God I don't know who that is and then Christ standing there next to him interceding the Catholics were fantastic they were great storytellers apologies to all Catholics ex Catholics but you get taken for a very long ride you know because because uh for certain things you actually had to go to Mary because you were so bad you had to go to Mary who had to take it to Jesus who had to take it to the father and before you did that you had to pay the priest or else you'd go through purgatory and if per chance you had to go through Purgatory then you had to pay us to do the prayers for 9 days so that we make sure your soul passes through Purgatory peacefully all lies do you know where that comes from heathenism in my ancestors uh mythology when someone dies you have to do a 16-day prayer a 40-day prayer what is it about the soul finding rest those Catholics brought in their heathenism paganism into Christianity and the Christian Church got duped by it when Christ came he took away the fear of death in the grave and the church put it back into the people even the Pentecostals go preach the gospel man tell the truth I have no fear of death nor Hell nor demon Spirits because my savior gave us the victory Our Savior gave us the victory we fear no death no hell no pain because there is a hope beyond the grave for us glory to God it's not a funeral service that's a victory service amen so this is not heaven and this is definitely not how you get there this is a Pentecostal idea of the Rapture sadly I've heard message Believers tell me this is going to happen so I I asked some of them I said okay so Christ is going to come in a cloud uh how you going to see him is he going to be man's size because then he's going to be a dot in the cloud no one's going to see him and the first thing you know is CNN is going to broadcast it so it's not going to be a secret coming and then if all of us start floating like this then it's totally against everything the prophet says brother ROM says it'll be a secret they won't even know you're missing they won't even care cuz they never liked you anyway he said you won't even appear on a milk carton that's sad but right but there W and he said of course there's so few that will go in the translation they'll not even miss you'll be a total secret the second coming to the Bride is a total secret but this is what they're waiting for I have such precious Pentecostal friends who preach this till tears comes out comes out of their eyes they get so anointed by preaching this they fall on the floor they're friends of mine school friends while preaching the word and I love them and I try to change what but they're so indoctrinated by this they believe they're going to float in the sky someday how can we who have the truth in the open book succumb to this if you don't get Dimensions you'll never understand the translation how do we know Christ's mystery Christ is revealed in his own word brother BR says and they're going to find out someday you know this already right yes they're not seeing 150 million of light space either they're going right around in a Circle that's exactly you're going to find it one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else right somebody say Amen that picture is definitely false you're still right here too just in another dimension faster than this one that's what I believe when I think of the translation that's what I believe when Elijah went in the translation it wasn't flying off to space it was here in a dimension when it says they looked up what does it mean up you think is up up means a higher Dimension and they saw him ascending a cloud Acts 1:8 and those two angels were there why do you stare the same way he went is the same way he'll come so brother Al you wrong he went up in the skies does it say that it said they looked up steadfastly do you know what that means we didn't if we didn't even know what the valy of h means you just assume you have the authority and what looking steadfastly up is get the dimensions then you'll know what it means amen it's a higher Dimension certainly to be able to look up is to look up to God when it says lift up your heads or your Gates what does up me let the king of glory come in look up for your Redemption draws nigh I don't see the bride walking like this everywhere look up means get a higher Vision glory to to God get a higher understanding above the things that they're preaching here in this Earthly realm because look up look into a higher dimension for your Redemption draws nigh that doesn't mean look with your nose in the clouds glory to God Seven Dimension before there was anything there was God this is beautiful he was the first existence nothing existed he was the self existing one yes sir he was the first yes sir but we defined him now as the seventh because it's the hardest to attain yes you are going to attain the existence of God yes that's what restoration is about we'll show you tomorrow when he became the logos a new form of existence began because the seventh Dimension made himself visible in the sixth Dimension so the Ang angs could see him he was the seventh making himself visible in the sixth When sin came in the sixth Dimension was separated a veil came in the way between seven and six heaven was only called heaven to differentiate from Earth the heavens speak of the universe the heavens speak of the atmosphere of Earth then there's the heaven of Heavens in the Bible Heaven refers to having rule over Earth right Heaven is his throne Earth Is His foottoo it's an existence it's a dimension he used the understanding of the universe to express his existence beyond Earth's existence he's outside of light matter time Heaven is an English word which we use to differentiate what the seventh Dimension is in fact it is simply the realm of Eternity Eternal existence God is eternity eternal life is God amen amen not that old guy with a beard who has to say bring me the Scrolls I need to remember who sinned open the books cuz I forgot what their Works were that's not the seven that's not an eternal God there's no time there's no forgetting when he said and God when and said and God remembered Noah does that mean he forgot him no the word Remembered in the Bible means keeping his promise see how our English lets us down it's terrible in you know what when God said let there be light did he say that in English cuz we all say that and God said let there be light when English was informed even Hebrew was informed so how did he say it when God speaks it's when his thoughts become manifested he didn't need to use Earthly languages this pathetic languages barely explains anything and we have to you know I was speaking on that I was telling brother Chad and them I did this exercise in our church when I was trying to explain how powerful the seven seal is and I was talking about how we we struggle with languages and we fight about quotes and this meaning it's so tedious yeah tiring exhausting and every other adjective that goes with it right and we fight with what quotes do you have how many quotes you mine is more proof because I have more quotes So I I I I I told a sister in our church who had parents who were mute to translate what I was saying in English using sign language there are people who catch the seven seal without knowing English how do you how do you do that how do they get the revelation of the coming of the Lord with sign language prise God which means the word transcends beyond our pathetic [Applause] languages it proves it's not about intellect the word is a person being made known we only use this language to understand some things right glory to God you don't have to be a a science Wiz you don't have to be someone who studied the Seven Hills and put this quote in order and the dates in order and this and that you can be catching it even if you didn't know the quotes by the preaching of the word you're getting it and you know how you know you get it when someone says something that's false you say that's not true how do you know do you have the quotes I don't care I just know it's not true glory to God Amen in fact it's simply the existence of Eternal existence the realm of Eternal existence if anything has eternal life it is heaven is eternal life setting in sir that's a sign Heaven is here the Bible calls it the heaven of Heavens so heaven was extended how do we know brother Brandon says God stretched his tent prise he became man man formed on Earth Heaven the realm of eternal life was extended to Earth Adam in the beginning was a theophany combined with an Earthly body Heaven and Earth were once one in the garden of EG we'll show you that tomorrow he was not even subject to Angels that's right why was he not subject to Angels because he's one with seven angels were subject to him oh prise when he sned he lost heaven when Christ but that's why the tree of life was blocked he lost Heaven never to be attained unless Christ came in who was the second Adam who was Heaven and Earth and embraced God and man met and joined and he came to bring many Brethren like unto him what does that mean oh you know he's a guy who's holy he prays every day is that really God's holiness no be perfect as God in heaven is perfect how is God's perfection in heaven young people is it how short he cuts his hair is it that he doesn't wear shorts is that he doesn't listen to pop music what is the Holiness of God the singleness of his nature that's right the purity of his nature is Holiness holy means to be set apart set apart from what he only has one purpose amen what does it mean when you are not set apart when you're living your life for two purposes that's right the will of God and the will of man and you're trying to make it work together you try to make the message convenient for an Earthly purpose that's Unholy [Music] that's not set apart if I live my life for God's purpose it means I'm holy yes sir Lord glory to God let's close it down seventh Dimension Heaven brother bam says in the for seal Heaven is consisted of the word that's not the sixth that's the seventh wherever the pure unadulterated person of the word is it is heaven the realm of eternal life when a man believes and accepts that the word person in that word person into himself it is the dimension of Heaven opening glory to God the purpose of the message and the open book returning to man is to bring Heaven and Earth back into a perfect union that's what we talk about when we speak about the open book and having the open book because that's what Revelation tells 10 tells us it's Heaven coming down it's the book coming to man the book was in heaven whoever held the book ruled all Dimensions whoever held the book ruled all dimensions and where's the book Revelations 10 tells you it's given to man it comes back why because man lost the original title de to everything he inherited and the whole purpose of the first coming was to teach people what heaven and earth embraced is to bring the nature back to mankind to receive the book after seven Church ages so bride has been prepared and The book must come down Heaven and Earth embracing to restore all that Adam lost Saint here's the beauty part of it future home types the believer future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride I saw a heaven and a new Earth you become a new person praise God amen a new Heaven we always think of future we think of what's going to happen after the white t judgment I saw heaven and a new a new Heaven and a new Earth you become a new person it's happening right now what's happening Heaven is coming down it's a new Heaven amen amen because the old is passed away because that heaven is come to us and my atoms are changing yes sir which means I'm becoming a new Earth I've lost all the sin attributes of the past I'm receiving the attributes of the logos my attribute that was in his mind before the foundation of the world I am becoming a new Heaven and a new Earth prise the Lord the temple of God and all the nations shall come into it right now what will do it the Earth couldn't be a place for heaven to sit now look at the sin it will have to be cleansed no man no person no woman boy girl I don't care who it is is fit to go in the Pulpit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost you have no right to the Lord's supper or any communion feet washing or anything until you have cleansed you have been cleansed by the Holy Fire of God yes notice the Tabernacle of God will be with man the former things has passed away this this thing has passed this thing has passed away this means that heaven has come down to resident with man see Heaven and Earth are embraced I didn't make those words up he said it you believe it just exactly when the dove how is Heaven and Earth embraced just exactly when the dove Came Upon part of the earth which was Jesus he was the dust of the earth man that's how Heaven and Earth embraced the dove coming on a piece of dust God coming from that one little life germ by creative power Saints in closing dimensions are going to readjust in the future home amen why light is going to change time is going to change Dimensions is the the look of things is going to be different there'll be no more hell because hell is cast in the Lake of Fire which means it's annihilated that's right so many things are going to be changed because dimensions are going there's going to be no more Satan that's right thank God literally there's going to be no Devils no Liars no dimension of lies no one to misrepresent the truth in the future home in the new Heaven and new earth is going to be none of that which means everything is going to be made New Glory to God praise be to God Saints tomorrow we're going to be able to show you how those how they changed from beginning from Before Time began right to the translation and like I said we're going to have some fun with it praise God brother bam says in different places as a musicians come up you he's speaking in the prayer line I just want to tell you just I'm I'm done I'm just want want to show you the different places where he's speaking about it and he says to the to the lady who's standing in front of him says can you feel that say you don't know what this is he said uh you're in two
