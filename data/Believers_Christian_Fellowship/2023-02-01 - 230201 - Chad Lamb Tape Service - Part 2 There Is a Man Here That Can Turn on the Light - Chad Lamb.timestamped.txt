[8:13] amen God bless you this evening we're
[8:16] going to go to prayer but before we do I
[8:18] want us to as we're standing as a
[8:20] congregation I'd like for us to remember
[8:22] sister Donna Howard and the child she's
[8:25] in now her father is still missing he's
[8:28] an elderly man he has dementia and some
[8:30] other health issues and they don't know
[8:33] what's happened they don't know where
[8:35] he's at he came up missing Monday
[8:37] evening he drove his car they did find
[8:40] the car yesterday up here in Mercer
[8:43] County up near St Mary's leg they have
[8:45] no idea why he drove there for what
[8:47] reason they've had no communication they
[8:49] found the car in a ditch and the doors
[8:52] were locked but they don't know so you
[8:54] can only imagine what it would be like
[8:55] if it was your family what our sister
[8:58] Don is going through I talked to her
[9:00] last night again today and she's
[9:03] trusting the Lord to take care of her
[9:05] dad and I just want to agree with her
[9:08] and pray that God will help him to be
[9:09] found and help the family and comfort
[9:12] them in this terrible trial so let's bow
[9:14] our heads together and let's pray
[9:15] together as an assembly
[9:18] oh dear heavenly father
[9:21] Lord Jesus when there's no place for us
[9:24] to turn
[9:25] God we're so thankful that we're not
[9:28] left without help in this world
[9:31] but God you are the Strong Tower that
[9:33] the righteous run into and are safe
[9:35] you're the one that we turn to for every
[9:37] need because you've already provided for
[9:39] us
[9:40] and God we know that you're mindful Lord
[9:42] of each one of us and you're mindful of
[9:45] the things that we go through
[9:47] annoyed the situation for the sister
[9:50] Dawn and her family lord it's such a
[9:52] difficult situation it's so worrying
[9:55] Lord
[9:56] they don't know where Donna's father is
[9:58] Lord but you know where he is
[10:00] and God our sister Donna she declared to
[10:03] me today she's believing and trusting in
[10:05] you and God I pray that you would bless
[10:08] her Lord and that you would let her
[10:09] father be found
[10:11] pray to bless those that are searching
[10:13] that you would give wisdom to those that
[10:14] are looking
[10:15] and God that you would do something Lord
[10:17] to let him be found
[10:19] pray to bless sister Dawn and her family
[10:21] her brothers the rest of the family
[10:23] comfort them Lord and especially our
[10:26] sister that you would comfort her bring
[10:28] peace into her heart and faith help her
[10:30] to Stand Fast knowing that all things
[10:32] are in control that you have her in the
[10:35] palm of your hand and you have
[10:36] everything that that she cares for Lord
[10:39] that you care for also and I prayed Lord
[10:42] that you would help in this time of need
[10:44] bless us to be a comfort to her Lord to
[10:48] continue to uphold her in our prayer
[10:50] Lord and to comfort her and encourage
[10:51] her
[10:52] I pray Lord that you would show yourself
[10:54] Mighty in this situation
[10:57] Lord as we look into your word tonight
[10:59] and as we listen to the message that you
[11:02] gave us Lord I pray that you would just
[11:03] open our hearts to receive the truth for
[11:06] this hour that we walk in that our eyes
[11:09] will be opened Lord and that we will
[11:10] live the life that you've called us to
[11:12] live and that will have a tremendous
[11:13] faith knowing what hour we're in and who
[11:16] we are that as we walk through this life
[11:18] Lord there's trial is all about but God
[11:20] you know all about it you've prepared
[11:22] the way and you've showed us so in your
[11:24] word and I pray God you would just give
[11:26] Revelation upon Revelation to us Lord
[11:29] help us God to walk in this life as you
[11:32] would walk in this life
[11:33] and Jesus Christ's name we pray
[11:36] [Music]
[11:37] God bless you you can have your seats
[11:39] for a minute
[11:40] thank you musicians I appreciate it
[11:44] we're going into the second part of our
[11:46] tape service tonight part two of there
[11:48] is a man here that can turn on the light
[11:50] we started last Wednesday we have part
[11:52] two and we'll have one more I believe
[11:53] one more Wednesday which will be next
[11:55] Wednesday if we could take our books out
[12:00] if you have your book and paper form
[12:02] electronic form however and I want to
[12:05] just do a just a real quick review and
[12:08] then we'll go into our questions then
[12:09] we'll read the opening scripture so we
[12:11] don't lose sight of that and then we'll
[12:12] play the tape
[12:14] uh we started from the beginning last
[12:17] time and we made it to page 14 last
[12:19] Wednesday and I'm not going to go
[12:21] through all the questions but I just
[12:22] want to go through a couple of them to
[12:24] refresh us of where we are in the
[12:26] message the first question I asked was
[12:28] what is the subject that brother Branham
[12:30] is going to speak on so we can find that
[12:33] in paragraph 34. the answer that's
[12:35] paragraph 34 on page seven
[12:39] page seven paragraph 34.
[12:41] he says may the Lord add his Blessing to
[12:43] the reading of his word and now odd
[12:45] little text that I heard someone speak
[12:47] said this but I want to take this for a
[12:49] text there is a man here that can turn
[12:52] on the line and now we're going to speak
[12:54] on the subject of light so the text is
[12:57] there's a man who can turn on the light
[12:58] but his subject is light and we heard
[13:00] that as we were going through and we'll
[13:01] hear much about that tonight that
[13:03] brother Benham is talking about life
[13:05] question number three was how does light
[13:07] come when you find the answer to that in
[13:09] paragraph 59
[13:12] on page 11. we looked in other places
[13:14] but I just want to pull out one sentence
[13:16] here paragraph 59. now remember then
[13:19] light comes by the spoken word of God so
[13:22] the light comes by the spoken word of
[13:24] God
[13:25] and then the last question was life
[13:27] comes by what so now how does light come
[13:30] by the spoken word of God life comes by
[13:32] what let's go to paragraph 74 on page
[13:36] 13.
[13:38] paragraph 74 on page 13.
[13:43] so life is only by the word of God made
[13:46] manifest so the light comes by the
[13:49] spoken word and life comes by that word
[13:52] made manifest
[13:53] amen so you can see the pattern of
[13:55] brother Venom's thinking so life is only
[13:57] by the word of God made manifest life
[13:59] comes only by the word of God made
[14:01] manifest as long as it's just in the
[14:03] book like this it still can be
[14:05] questioned but when it's made manifest
[14:07] and you see the product of what it spoke
[14:09] of being manifested then that is light
[14:11] on the word that's what that's what uh
[14:14] that's what brings the word said so and
[14:16] then it comes to pass that is life and
[14:19] light light bringing Life Light brings
[14:23] life let's go over to page 80 on the
[14:25] next page page 14.
[14:27] paragraph 80.
[14:29] let's read that
[14:32] God's word comes only by the Bible God's
[14:36] Bible is the printed form of the Son of
[14:38] God because the Bible said that it is
[14:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God
[14:43] revealing himself through Christ and
[14:45] Christ is the word and it takes the
[14:47] light of God to shine upon that word to
[14:49] vindicate it to prove that God still
[14:51] speaks life eternal life he speaks
[14:54] natural light brings life life only
[14:56] comes by the Light the word may manifest
[14:59] or made flesh amen and that's what
[15:03] brings life
[15:04] so it's important that we're where the
[15:07] where the word is made flesh
[15:11] amen I want to get into the questions if
[15:14] we can bring the PowerPoint up for the
[15:15] Franco
[15:17] we'll have some questions uh today for
[15:21] part two question number one
[15:24] is what guides you to the light
[15:27] what guides you to the light
[15:29] you'll notice sometimes the questions
[15:31] are worded a little bit funny but
[15:32] they're worded in the way brother Ben's
[15:34] going to speak it so we can catch the
[15:36] context catch it pull it out of the the
[15:38] text what guides you to the light
[15:44] question number two why did mankind need
[15:47] to learn how to split an atom I like
[15:50] this one this one is very very
[15:52] interesting
[15:54] why did mankind need to learn how to
[15:57] split an atom
[15:59] it's amazing what what God has showed us
[16:01] through this prophetic gift in this day
[16:04] it is absolutely amazing why did mankind
[16:07] need to learn how to split an atom
[16:12] scientists just thought they were smart
[16:15] they didn't realize God allowed it for a
[16:17] purpose
[16:19] number three why did they reject the
[16:22] Messiah
[16:25] and like I said before there's all kinds
[16:27] of answers to the question if it's a
[16:28] standalone question we can come up with
[16:30] all kinds of things but I'm looking for
[16:32] the answer that he's giving through this
[16:33] message where we're staying in in the
[16:36] context of this message here
[16:38] why did they reject the Messiah
[16:44] question number four what is light this
[16:47] is very similar to what we asked last
[16:49] time but there's a statement that he
[16:51] makes that I want to highlight what is
[16:53] light
[16:57] what is light
[16:59] and number five
[17:02] we cannot live by what kind of light
[17:05] that's an odd phrase question but you'll
[17:07] find out why we cannot live by what kind
[17:09] of light so there's a certain kind of
[17:11] light we can't live by
[17:12] so we cannot live by what kind of light
[17:16] and we'll find that the prophet answers
[17:18] this question for us
[17:30] we cannot live by what kind of light
[17:35] okay so we are going to begin on page
[17:38] 14.
[17:39] right at the beginning of paragraph 79
[17:41] it's just a little just one paragraph
[17:43] before where we stopped last time
[17:45] so we'll begin on page 14. paragraph 79
[17:49] and we'll go all the way to page 33
[17:52] and we'll go to the bottom of paragraph
[17:55] uh 180. so we'll go to page 33
[18:00] bottom of paragraph
[18:02] 180.
[18:05] so hopefully you got those questions
[18:06] wrote down let's just stand together
[18:08] quickly and we'll go through the opening
[18:10] scriptures because as we go through the
[18:12] sermons I don't want to lose context of
[18:14] the scriptures that brother random opens
[18:16] with it's something that I've always
[18:17] have a habit of referring back to
[18:19] and so Isaiah chapter 42 verse 1.
[18:24] will be the first reading Isaiah chapter
[18:27] 42
[18:29] and verse 1.
[18:38] Isaiah 42 verse 1 behold my servant whom
[18:42] I uphold mine elect in whom my soul
[18:44] delighteth I've put my spirit upon him
[18:46] he shall bring forth judgment to the
[18:48] Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up
[18:51] nor cause his voice to be heard in the
[18:53] street a bruised Reed shall he not break
[18:56] in the smoking Flack shall he not quench
[18:58] he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[19:01] he shall not fail nor be discouraged
[19:03] till he have set judgment in the earth
[19:05] and the Isle shall wait for his law thus
[19:08] saith God the Lord he that created the
[19:10] heavens and stretched them out he that
[19:12] spread forth the Earth and that which
[19:14] cometh out of it he that giveth breath
[19:16] unto the people upon it and spirit to
[19:18] them that walk therein I the Lord have
[19:21] called thee in righteousness and I will
[19:23] uphold thee and I'm sorry and I will
[19:25] hold thine hand and I will keep thee and
[19:28] give thee for a covenant of the people
[19:29] for a light of the Gentiles to open the
[19:32] blind eyes to bring out the prisoners
[19:34] from the prison and them that sit in
[19:36] darkness out of the prison house let's
[19:39] turn to Matthew chapter 4.
[19:46] Matthew chapter 4
[19:49] and we'll begin reading from verse 12.
[19:55] Matthew chapter 4 and verse 12. now when
[19:58] Jesus has heard that John was cast into
[20:00] prison he departed into Galilee and
[20:03] leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in
[20:05] Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and
[20:07] the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim that
[20:10] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[20:12] by Isaias the prophet saying the land of
[20:14] zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the
[20:17] way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of
[20:19] the Gentiles the people which sat in
[20:21] darkness saw great light and to them
[20:24] which sat in the region and shadow of
[20:26] death light is sprung up from that time
[20:28] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[20:30] for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[20:34] and then you can have your seats
[20:36] we'll turn to
[20:39] page 14 and we'll begin at the top of
[20:43] paragraph 79 brother Franco if you could
[20:45] turn that on
[20:47] for us
[20:53] sometimes that little green lays the
[20:55] Earth dormant all through the winter I
[20:58] like to see the winter wheat sew it in
[21:00] the ground but when that sun gets just
[21:03] right
[21:04] oh it's got to live amen see and he
[21:07] can't live without the sun right and
[21:09] God's made promises for every age and
[21:11] every day
[21:12] and when the light gets right and shines
[21:15] upon that it'll produce just exactly
[21:17] what the word said because he is the
[21:19] light and the light God's word comes
[21:23] only by the Bible God's Bible is the the
[21:28] printed form of the Son of God because
[21:31] the Bible said that it is the revelation
[21:33] of Jesus Christ it's God revealing
[21:37] himself through Christ and Christ is the
[21:40] word and it takes the light of God to
[21:42] shine upon that word to Vindicated to
[21:45] prove that God still speaks life eternal
[21:48] life
[21:48] uh natural eye brings to life life only
[21:52] comes by the Light the word made
[21:55] manifests or made flesh when all the
[21:58] promises become uh in the Bible become
[22:02] manifest is when Jesus Christ the word
[22:05] was made flesh Among Us God always works
[22:10] through man
[22:11] man is God's subject now if it gets a
[22:14] little warm in here for you pull the
[22:15] windows down or whatever you wish dude
[22:16] cut the furnace down maybe the janitor
[22:18] cut the furnace down a little see many
[22:20] are warm and it's warm standing here too
[22:22] so remember that um I'm glad it's warm
[22:26] instead of cold cold I like warm huh
[22:29] warm always brings light life
[22:32] takes fire
[22:34] notice now made flesh when the word
[22:38] becomes flesh it becomes manifested like
[22:43] take the word and put it in the right
[22:47] position the right kind of ground it'll
[22:50] bring forth the the seed will bring
[22:52] forth this kind and the word brought
[22:55] into the right kind of a heart it'll
[22:57] manifest itself it'll bring forth the
[23:00] light it'll break forth upon it all
[23:02] right nothing natural nothing a natural
[23:06] our spiritual can live without God's
[23:09] light amen life can only come then by
[23:13] light
[23:14] nothing natural or nothing spiritual can
[23:17] live without God's light
[23:20] think of that all right
[23:22] but when he sends us the light
[23:26] and does all these things and then
[23:28] re-rejected
[23:30] now that's the pitiful part
[23:33] it's when life is rejected
[23:36] when it's sent to us
[23:39] how could you imagine some man today
[23:42] saying I just refuse to say there's such
[23:46] a thing as a son
[23:47] I don't believe there is a sign and he
[23:50] runs down into the basement
[23:52] and and shuts all the doors and sets
[23:55] back in the darkness and said there is
[23:57] no such a thing as Sun
[23:59] there is no such a thing as light
[24:01] you know right away there was something
[24:03] mentally wrong with that person see
[24:06] there's something wrong when he runs
[24:08] back into a dark basement and refuses to
[24:12] accept the benefit of god-given life
[24:15] there's something wrong with him
[24:18] you don't want us warm raise
[24:21] he doesn't want his health giving a
[24:23] substance he doesn't want to slide to
[24:25] walk in he had rather set in darkness
[24:28] it shows mentally something wrong
[24:31] natural with the man
[24:33] and I say this with all love and respect
[24:36] so is there something spiritually wrong
[24:39] with a man
[24:41] that'll run back into his denominations
[24:43] of creed
[24:44] and refuse to see Bible I want to
[24:47] shining right before
[24:49] Hallelujah
[24:52] goes back into his Creeds and farms and
[24:55] shuts the door and says there is no such
[24:57] a thing as that the days of Miracles has
[25:00] passed there's no such a thing as Divine
[25:01] Healing there are none of these things
[25:03] that was for an apostle the man is
[25:06] spiritually crazy
[25:07] there's something wrong with him he he's
[25:10] pulled down the curtains and rejected
[25:13] the holy spirit that can come upon him
[25:16] if he can if ye abide me and my words in
[25:19] you then the light's shining upon this
[25:22] word ask what you will
[25:25] there's something wrong
[25:28] that he would reject the god-given
[25:31] sources that God has given to us to live
[25:34] by his word the just shall live by faith
[25:38] and man shall not live by bread alone
[25:41] but by every word not part of the word
[25:44] every word that proceeds out of the
[25:47] mouth of God
[25:48] and when a man will just refuse that
[25:52] there's something wrong with that person
[25:55] that's right something wrong with his
[25:57] experience that it claims to love God
[26:00] and then refuses God there's something
[26:03] going wrong with the person amen we know
[26:06] that without a shadow doubt he rejects
[26:08] it runs into this place and says honest
[26:11] I don't want to know nothing about it
[26:12] don't tell me nothing about these things
[26:13] I I don't believe nothing about it you
[26:15] don't matter what you say
[26:17] Paul said not long ago I was telling you
[26:19] about he said
[26:21] I don't care if you would bring 50
[26:23] Cancers and bring 50 doctors to testify
[26:25] him I don't believe I don't care if
[26:27] you'd raise up the dead right before me
[26:29] I wouldn't believe it see there's
[26:31] something wrong with that person amen
[26:34] amen there there's and yet the man was a
[26:37] minister then they supposed to be a
[26:41] minister but just because that
[26:43] organization doesn't believe in in the
[26:46] uh powers of God don't believe that the
[26:50] word admit just what it said the man
[26:53] runs into this basement old musty dirty
[26:57] filthy basement of an organization and
[27:00] refuses
[27:02] the warmth and life-giving Rays of the
[27:06] Holy Spirit
[27:07] Jesus Christ which is the same yesterday
[27:11] man there's something wrong with that
[27:14] person
[27:15] see you'd rather live in that must
[27:19] darkness and so forth and to live in the
[27:22] life of the god and of the Bible said
[27:25] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[27:27] today and forever The Works that I do
[27:29] shall you do also even greater than this
[27:32] shall you do for I go to my father
[27:34] there's something wrong with that person
[27:37] without a question at all there's
[27:40] something wrong
[27:42] and do you man let's listen to this
[27:44] across the world wherever you may be
[27:47] there's something wrong with your
[27:50] experience when you say that you love
[27:52] God and refuse his word
[27:56] there's something you refuse a very no
[27:59] wonder that thanks to the church is in
[28:01] his condition and things cannot be done
[28:02] as God promised is because you won't
[28:05] even receive the word or walk in the
[28:07] life amen the Bible said let us walk in
[28:10] the light as he is in the light amen
[28:12] then the blood of Jesus Christ God's son
[28:15] cleanses us from all sin sin is unbelief
[28:18] that if we are walking in the god-given
[28:21] light or the hour
[28:24] then God takes that word
[28:26] that's given for the hour and vindicates
[28:30] it just like he did in Genesis 1 3 he
[28:32] said let there be light and light come
[28:34] forth his word went forth and white
[28:36] followed it and currently the mist and
[28:40] the Darkness went to one corner and the
[28:42] light shine on the other side that's the
[28:44] way God does today he sends his word for
[28:46] this hour amen and the Holy Spirit comes
[28:49] and makes that word live and the
[28:52] Darkness goes on to their Creeds and
[28:53] denominations but light shines because
[28:56] it's a word of God indicated that his
[29:00] word is true
[29:01] Hallelujah now there's nothing
[29:03] fictitious about that that's just
[29:05] exactly scripture yes all right now we
[29:09] find
[29:10] that the the wise man
[29:13] the wise man of the oil followed the
[29:15] god-given
[29:17] substance they Fallen the word of God to
[29:23] the light
[29:24] because it was the word that brought
[29:27] life
[29:28] now you say how do they follow
[29:31] well they were kind of in Mages we
[29:34] understand
[29:35] and then we find out that Balaam the
[29:39] prophet back in numbers 24 17.
[29:43] uh Balaam was kindly of a major himself
[29:48] he was a prophet truly
[29:50] and he prophesied here and said a star
[29:54] would rise out of Jacob
[29:57] and when these wise man saw that the
[30:01] word of God set a star would rise out of
[30:04] Jacob they followed that little
[30:07] god-given token to the
[30:11] source of eternal life
[30:15] so a wise man today
[30:18] who is not blinded by Creeds amen
[30:21] will follow the god-given spoken word
[30:25] till I see the fullness of the power of
[30:28] God moving forward
[30:32] hey they see it and they know that it's
[30:35] here in the scripture God promised it
[30:37] for this day no matter how many
[30:40] observatories how many other things told
[30:41] the wise man where you're out of your
[30:43] mind two years there was some travel
[30:45] they passed by many nations and they say
[30:49] where are you going all we have seen is
[30:51] star in the east and we come to worship
[30:53] Him amen and when they lined up in
[30:56] Jerusalem the denominational
[30:57] headquarters they didn't have the answer
[30:59] they went up and down the streets crime
[31:01] where is he born King of the Jews they
[31:03] know nothing about it so they call on
[31:06] the word to find out they had fallen
[31:09] known that star was leading them to the
[31:12] eternal life
[31:13] guide us to that perfect life
[31:16] and the word is what guides you to the
[31:18] light and the lights what makes the word
[31:20] Vindicated amen
[31:24] notice they were wise man
[31:28] and wise man today not why the wisdom in
[31:31] this world is foolishness to God
[31:34] all your sinus and you people who are
[31:37] depending on some great scholarship or
[31:39] something you know they're telling you
[31:40] how to spit an atom it can't give you
[31:42] life
[31:43] there's nothing can give you life but
[31:45] the spoken word of God is the only order
[31:48] that life can come is through his spoken
[31:50] word
[31:51] that's all right to know how to spit
[31:53] Adam I wish they never found it out but
[31:56] if they they have to do it because this
[31:58] world is hanging today
[32:00] it had to happen to burst these big
[32:03] holes in the earth to let that lava come
[32:05] forth and rejuvenate this world again to
[32:08] make a new Earth where the righteous
[32:11] will walk out of on the dust of them
[32:13] first sin will be forgotten everything
[32:16] has a way of renewing itself and man who
[32:20] is given to live on this Earth by his
[32:23] own wisdom taking a tree of knowledge
[32:24] instead of the tree of life he'll
[32:26] destroy the Earth that God give him to
[32:28] live on
[32:30] those who are still on the Tree of Life
[32:32] shall come to a New Haven Center where
[32:35] there is no sickness or death
[32:37] wrong light
[32:39] Lord send us light
[32:42] it was the angels of God that showed
[32:45] light upon the hill to guide the
[32:47] Shepherds to the eternal life
[32:50] see it only comes by light light can
[32:54] only come by light the Shepherds wanting
[32:56] to know no other king is born they have
[32:59] seen
[33:00] great carrying on when the king is born
[33:03] now he was so secretly born and born in
[33:07] a stable
[33:08] uh in a Manger where the cattle and
[33:12] horses was eating but yet he was a king
[33:15] and the the Angels came down and sang
[33:19] the hymns to the Shepherds in
[33:24] the light
[33:26] the Angels themselves were lights that
[33:30] showed with the word of God they had the
[33:33] word of God and told them the day in the
[33:35] city of David in Bethlehem is born
[33:39] Christ the Savior amen the Angels had
[33:43] the word and the word came by light to
[33:46] God
[33:48] and they followed the word of the angels
[33:50] to the eternal life they found the baby
[33:53] they're wrapped in swallow's claws as
[33:56] they had said foresee life only comes by
[33:59] light
[34:00] notice
[34:01] he wants the word made like or became
[34:05] like the word
[34:07] and that generation
[34:10] he was the word light of that generation
[34:13] because the prophets of Allah spoke of
[34:15] him and here he come and Vindicated he
[34:19] was the light of God's spoken word see
[34:22] all the prophets had uh and say it had
[34:26] been fulfilled in him see the prophets
[34:29] back here with the word like God was at
[34:31] the beginning where he said let there be
[34:32] light
[34:33] and like King now the prophet said a
[34:37] virgin shall conceive bring forth the
[34:39] son they shall call his name Emmanuel
[34:42] for it'll be God With Us now they had
[34:45] spoken the word went out but he lost the
[34:48] light what was he the Fulfillment
[34:52] [Applause]
[34:53] he was the Fulfillment of that word he
[34:57] was a manifestation of that word oh so
[35:01] is it today
[35:03] God's word has been fulfilled at the
[35:06] hour that's the light is God manifesting
[35:09] himself he was a light of the world and
[35:14] when the prophets inspired by the holy
[35:17] spirit said unto us a child is born unto
[35:21] us uh a son is given or a child is given
[35:24] and his name Shall be Called cancer
[35:25] Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting
[35:27] father there it was what was he the
[35:30] light that fulfilled that word
[35:33] amen the light that fulfilled that word
[35:37] and Matthew and Saint Matthew the 28th
[35:40] chapter we find and uh when Jesus raised
[35:44] from the dead he also was the light of
[35:48] the spoken word of David we said I'll
[35:50] not leave his holy hell amen neither I
[35:52] suffer my Holy One to see crushing death
[35:55] is in darkness
[35:56] Pentecost
[36:12] that was the light that showed when the
[36:15] Holy Ghost to come Isaiah said in the
[36:18] 28th chapter of Isaiah
[36:19] Isaiah said that with free sip must be
[36:23] upon precept lie must be up online
[36:25] you're a little in there a little hold
[36:28] fast to that what's good father was
[36:30] stammering lips and with other tongues
[36:33] will I speak to this people and this is
[36:35] the rest amen this is the Sabbath
[36:39] I'll give you and all this they were not
[36:42] here walked away and wagged their heads
[36:45] and when on the day of Pentecost when
[36:48] the Holy Ghost fell upon those people
[36:49] and they acted like drunk men and women
[36:52] staggered under the impact of the Holy
[36:55] Spirit
[36:55] and they'll walk away and wag their
[36:57] heads and said this people's drunk full
[36:59] of new wine and so forth it absolutely
[37:02] was a light the word that had been
[37:06] prophesied made manifest
[37:08] soys in every age
[37:11] the word made manifest come to life is
[37:15] the light of that age
[37:16] [Music]
[37:17] there the word made manifest it's like
[37:20] was it Genesis 1 well God said let there
[37:22] be light and there was light yeah when
[37:24] God said there will be a son and there
[37:26] was a son amen well God said it in Joel
[37:29] 2 28 it shall come to pass the last days
[37:31] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[37:33] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[37:35] of all my hands maids and made sure life
[37:37] pour out of my spirit your young man
[37:39] shall see Visions your old man shall see
[37:41] dreams and all these things that he
[37:43] promised when if the Holy Ghost fell was
[37:46] the light upon that word when the word
[37:50] was made manifest then it become light
[37:52] amen he is the light he's the light that
[37:57] we should follow he is the only night
[37:59] the Angels found light and followed it
[38:02] to him now in all ages God has set forth
[38:06] so much of his word for each age God
[38:08] always sends somebody that that word to
[38:10] get into and show the light of it at the
[38:13] other age it does the same thing always
[38:15] does that
[38:16] he was a full film as I said of all the
[38:18] Divine holy powers of the prophets they
[38:22] were minor Gods when the word of the
[38:25] Lord came to a man Jesus said himself
[38:27] and he was a God yeah you know that he
[38:30] said if your law said in your fathers
[38:33] back there call them who the word of God
[38:36] came to call them gods
[38:39] how can you condemn me say when I said
[38:41] I'm the Son of God okay when the very
[38:44] God himself who spoke the word through
[38:46] the prophets he was a manifestation of
[38:48] that spoken word
[38:50] foreign
[38:51] if the prophet was called to God because
[38:54] he was the manifestation of another
[38:56] prophet's word
[38:57] how can you condemn him when he was the
[39:00] same thing he was the son of God Amen as
[39:03] he shall be called the son of God
[39:06] he was a long promised Messiah that the
[39:10] world had waited on he was a messiah's
[39:12] promise made manifest look at him when
[39:14] he stood there he said if I do not the
[39:16] works of my father then condemn me
[39:20] see but if you can't believe me believe
[39:22] the work sir
[39:25] they tell you who I am you see that
[39:28] blind darkened hour that they live in
[39:30] they couldn't see it
[39:32] they just couldn't understand how could
[39:34] he be that how can he be any Son of God
[39:36] when he's born right down here in
[39:38] Bethlehem if you only know the word said
[39:40] it would come that way amen by his
[39:43] father Joseph is a Carter his mother why
[39:45] is actually believed amongst our
[39:47] Brethren that he was born illegitimately
[39:49] see but yet the word of God said that he
[39:51] said search the scriptures
[39:53] for in them you think you have eternal
[39:56] life and they are the very ones of
[39:58] testify who I am
[40:02] they are the ones that testify me this
[40:05] holy scriptures then what was he God's
[40:09] light no wonder he said I'm the light of
[40:10] the world Amen not only did he say I'm
[40:12] alive and said ye are the light amen
[40:16] if his word is in you bearing record of
[40:19] itself then you are a light of the word
[40:22] notice we find out light of each age May
[40:26] manifest just the same then I want to
[40:29] ask the question as before time gets
[40:32] away why why then were they uh
[40:37] did they turn it down how could they do
[40:40] it
[40:41] when the their very Bible if they was
[40:44] reading was being made manifest before
[40:47] him yeah
[40:48] now study real hard now
[40:51] I remember I'm talking to many people at
[40:53] this time to see not just four or five
[40:55] hundred here but I'm I'm talking to many
[40:58] thousands stop just a minute stop your
[41:01] tape recorder and ask the question why
[41:04] would religious man good man
[41:08] why would Joseph question
[41:10] see why would you because he never
[41:13] searched the scripture
[41:16] why did the priest
[41:18] question
[41:20] one reason they didn't they knew it
[41:23] Nicodemus well expressed it that's right
[41:25] he said Rabbi we know you're a teacher
[41:28] from God no man could do what you do
[41:31] except God be with him we're aware of
[41:33] that but what was it their Traditions
[41:35] kept them from doing it then why were
[41:38] they did they reject the Messiah is be
[41:41] quiet if they reject that light here's a
[41:43] word that they knowed what was coming to
[41:45] pass but when the word was made manifest
[41:48] to show that the word of God had been
[41:51] fulfilled compare that with today
[41:55] ready when they're written in the word
[41:58] that would take place then why did those
[42:01] men reject it teachers
[42:05] because they were living in a glare of
[42:07] another life that's it there's living in
[42:11] a glare
[42:13] that's the thing they're doing today
[42:14] they're living the reason they turn it
[42:17] down is because they're living in a
[42:19] glare of another night
[42:20] see amen now they was living in a glare
[42:25] of what Moses said they claimed
[42:27] they was living in a glad of what
[42:29] another age had passed by and that's the
[42:32] very reason today that this message
[42:36] that Jesus Christ still is the same is
[42:39] turned down because the people are
[42:42] living in glares of other ages
[42:45] the same reason
[42:48] they turn it down
[42:49] now we notice and Webster says that a
[42:52] glare is kind of a false light
[42:56] a glare is a false light is there
[42:59] anything your glass like like a mirage
[43:01] on the road you go down the road many of
[43:04] you driving cars and look down ahead of
[43:05] you when you see that sun on the ground
[43:08] it reflects a light and like a mirage so
[43:12] that there's water all over the road
[43:13] but when you get there there's nothing
[43:15] there
[43:17] it's only a false Mirage the glare of a
[43:21] True Light
[43:23] and that's what the devil's doing today
[43:25] amen it's showing people a mirage
[43:29] a council of churches a group of
[43:32] denominations which will turn out to be
[43:34] false because it's because there is a
[43:38] real life
[43:41] that real life was a shiny Mirage could
[43:44] be there
[43:46] [Music]
[43:48] and that's her living in a glare of
[43:50] another age
[43:52] another thing for us hitting passed on
[43:55] now a glare this Mirage is false it's a
[44:00] glare of the sun that's why they did the
[44:03] same thing a false glare of the True
[44:07] Light now it proved to be that he was
[44:11] the True Light
[44:12] he was alive why do they know that he
[44:16] was alive how could you know he was
[44:18] alive because the word that was promised
[44:21] was made manifest through him so he was
[44:23] the light of that spoken word amen
[44:27] oh that would always make me a
[44:30] Pentecostal Baptist shot always thinking
[44:34] hey see living in eclair but when the
[44:38] true word
[44:40] is living that side what God Said
[44:44] now what if God said in the beginning uh
[44:47] let there be light
[44:48] well and uh there was something else up
[44:52] here
[44:53] that's right yeah see just a mirage see
[44:55] it would have been though what God Said
[44:58] no it wouldn't have been what if God
[45:01] said let there be lot more fog came
[45:03] see it would have been like but the
[45:06] reason light come it was his word
[45:08] manifested and today when God has said
[45:11] such things will take place at this time
[45:14] and you see it doing what is it's a life
[45:16] on God's word
[45:18] it's work being made like
[45:22] manifest itself now they said who do you
[45:26] say we are
[45:27] why I said Utah we know that you're
[45:29] crazy
[45:30] why you're a Samaritan you haven't got
[45:33] your right mind
[45:34] what are you trying to who can tell we
[45:36] know he was born in sin
[45:38] we don't know where you come from
[45:40] we have no record of your identification
[45:42] in our groups
[45:44] wow you're crazy you got a devil see say
[45:48] well you're out of your mind but he was
[45:50] actually the genuine True Light Of God
[45:55] shining
[45:56] and the glory put up their eyes out
[46:00] we are Moses is our God he said if you
[46:03] would have believed Moses you'd have
[46:05] known me
[46:06] [Music]
[46:08] and if you believe Jesus and the Bible
[46:11] you know this hour
[46:15] they said well we're Christians we if
[46:17] you were
[46:19] you know the acts of Christ for this day
[46:24] you know it Jesus said all those
[46:26] prophets spoke of me
[46:28] and if you believe those Prophets You
[46:30] Know Me
[46:33] my Works identify because what they said
[46:35] I Do I Do It
[46:37] and who can condemn me now
[46:41] I still they didn't see it why their
[46:43] eyes were put out with a glare
[46:45] it's either glare of something else that
[46:47] they're taken what the true spoken word
[46:49] was not think of it
[46:52] think of it
[46:54] they claim that they believed that word
[46:58] but they're traditions had turned their
[47:01] faces from the true word to a glass
[47:05] before they couldn't see the real thing
[47:10] so is it today
[47:12] so has it been in every age
[47:15] see the the true word shines but they
[47:18] have been so traditionalized that they
[47:21] can't see that word they're looking at a
[47:23] Clarity they're blind
[47:25] a clair will blind you
[47:28] it'll blind you a little when Jesus said
[47:33] you are blind yeah yeah leading a blind
[47:36] they should have been able to see it to
[47:39] see who he was but they didn't because
[47:41] they was living in that glare now
[47:44] Glarus I said is a false light a mirage
[47:47] a false conception of a true life
[47:51] false conception it's something that
[47:53] that's supposed to look like it but it
[47:55] isn't that now the only way they could
[47:57] tell the difference they cause the very
[47:58] things that Jesus did prove who he was
[48:01] that he was the light they thought
[48:04] theirs in the light
[48:06] but now if you just stop them
[48:09] and consider who is in the life
[48:12] now today
[48:14] if such a racial mistake was made by the
[48:17] church man of that day such a rational
[48:20] thing was there
[48:22] brethren
[48:23] don't you think that it's time that we
[48:26] stopped and considered what is life
[48:31] let us not make such a rational mistake
[48:33] amen
[48:35] but you're doing it right we've already
[48:38] done
[48:38] and do it now
[48:40] same as it was an now stop just a minute
[48:44] and find out what the word says for
[48:47] today
[48:47] if they had stopped and thought here he
[48:50] is fulfilling to the letter exactly what
[48:52] the word said he would do and he
[48:54] challenged them as I'm challenging you
[48:57] I'm challenging you to look in the word
[49:00] search the scripture
[49:03] see if this isn't it out
[49:07] search the scripture so in them you
[49:09] think you have eternal life and they are
[49:10] they that testify me
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] here they to testify of this work today
[49:18] it works itself testifies amen that is
[49:22] being done and the scripture says
[49:23] there'll be none so it's alive all the
[49:25] hours
[49:28] God's word said so your traditions and
[49:31] things is exactly what the Bible says
[49:34] like those who wag their heads and walk
[49:35] away all the tables become full of vomit
[49:38] the Bible said that's where they
[49:41] wouldn't believe it they wipe their
[49:42] heads in gentlemen do you realize and
[49:44] brother do you realize this that when
[49:46] you are rejecting the very thing that
[49:48] God's vindicating before you that you're
[49:50] doing the same thing they did
[49:53] going back to your traditional pilot
[49:57] as a dog goes to its vomit
[49:59] if it made him sick the first time it'll
[50:02] make him sick the second huh
[50:04] if the Catholic Church being organized
[50:07] made the first organization brought
[50:09] sickness to the church
[50:11] solo Lutheran methodists and all the
[50:13] rest of them Baptist Presbyterian and
[50:14] Pentecostal amen a dog goes back to its
[50:17] vomit and a sow goes back to her water
[50:19] yeah right yeah we're getting to that in
[50:22] a few minutes the Lord with me glare
[50:24] walking in a glare
[50:27] a mirage a false conception of True Life
[50:31] he'd proved that he was the light
[50:33] because he being in a way in a minority
[50:36] oh my Millions against him
[50:39] there was not one sixth of the people
[50:41] 190th of the people on the Earth never
[50:43] know what he was here
[50:45] not I guess one one hundredth of the
[50:48] Jews or hardly one
[50:51] maybe less than that of his own country
[50:53] Evernote he was there and them it didn't
[50:56] know he was there considered him a false
[50:59] but something because the denomination
[51:01] of told him that's what he was
[51:02] but yet he was the True Light that had
[51:05] been spoken since Genesis in the
[51:07] beginning
[51:08] and ask them to search the scriptures
[51:10] and find out if he wasn't living just in
[51:12] that time if he The Works that he did in
[51:14] fulfill exactly what was promised at
[51:16] that time amen amen
[51:18] what a serious thing it is brother yes
[51:22] we're living in a tremendous time yeah
[51:25] yeah he proved to be the right he was
[51:27] the very light that they claimed they
[51:29] were worshiping
[51:31] they claim to be worshiping that light
[51:33] and so is it today that's right they
[51:36] claim they're worshiping it Pentecostals
[51:38] claim yeah
[51:40] they claim they are it's so blind they
[51:43] can't see it
[51:45] they organizing by the glare in their
[51:47] face a tradition is what some people sat
[51:49] together and said we'll go make this and
[51:51] this and this and that now we're going
[51:52] to come to why that has to happen
[51:54] the Lord's women
[51:56] notice his Works was the Living Word
[51:59] itself what he did was the Living Word
[52:02] itself showing he was that light that
[52:06] have been promised since the beginning
[52:08] of the world he was that light his light
[52:11] on the promised word of the age made it
[52:14] live to exactly what the promise said it
[52:17] would do but they had so turned around
[52:19] until they couldn't sin see but he was
[52:22] the light of that age he was the light
[52:25] that they claimed to be worshiping they
[52:28] thought that they were worshiping the
[52:29] very God of creation
[52:31] but he was living in worshiping the
[52:33] glare and Jesus said
[52:35] you worship me in vain
[52:39] teaching for Doctrine their traditions
[52:42] of man
[52:43] and not the word he is the word that he
[52:47] was the word made manifest they ought to
[52:50] have noted hey I hope that can break
[52:52] through every horse
[52:54] but it is the word made manifest or say
[52:58] oh we have the word well the word
[53:00] everybody pack a Bible it wants to but
[53:03] when the word is Vindicated made
[53:06] manifest well say well we believe yes
[53:08] sir they believed all the well on so
[53:10] does Satan amen those fantasies who
[53:12] could condemn them not believing but
[53:15] they didn't believe the word for the
[53:17] hour they were worshiping a glare of
[53:19] something else that's the same thing
[53:21] you're doing today
[53:22] [Applause]
[53:24] they're keeping up Luther's predict
[53:26] conditions or Wesley's traditions and
[53:29] the rest of them the Pentecostal
[53:30] Traditions but one of them
[53:32] the Pharisees was keeping up their
[53:35] Traditions but behind their Traditions
[53:38] was a true word of God coming to shine
[53:41] forth and what it did it blinded their
[53:43] eyes they couldn't sit because he's
[53:45] watching something else
[53:46] so is it today may God let that soak in
[53:50] yeah I thought it really hits home to
[53:51] the people it should believe it
[53:53] it's later than you think
[53:56] my son Billy Paul
[53:58] he talks in his sleep but he doesn't
[54:00] have dreams very often he had one the
[54:02] other night that suck him up say dream
[54:04] this at a church and and they I had come
[54:07] in here and say well come in fire was
[54:08] flying out of the eyes and I said the
[54:10] time is yours it's over and uh everybody
[54:13] gets screaming I can't my children and
[54:15] me and my wife so I can't get Sarah to
[54:16] ask the blessing at the table and so
[54:18] forth and I said he said I've got to go
[54:19] get lost and the baby I said lost can't
[54:22] come now the baby's too young to know
[54:23] Billy the hour is sure we must go I said
[54:26] it's midnight now before daylight of
[54:29] Jesus will be here if it isn't then I'm
[54:31] a false witness of Christ and somebody
[54:33] spoke up said no man knows men are honor
[54:35] I said Mr iron says sometimes pre
[54:36] non-day life
[54:40] but we're at the time let's go and we
[54:44] got in the car and started we started up
[54:45] the mountain and when we did it was it
[54:47] looked like the light was coming in the
[54:49] skies but dark upon the Earth he said I
[54:50] pulled off Side Road and helped my hands
[54:52] over like this fire still flying from my
[54:54] eyes they said I said Lord I did this at
[54:57] your command I did this just because
[54:59] that you told me to do it this way I did
[55:02] these things according to what you've
[55:03] told me and I motioned to a big Granite
[55:05] Mountain and a a light without hands cut
[55:08] a stone out of the mountain went
[55:10] hundreds of tons and here it come I said
[55:12] turn your hands don't look it'll all be
[55:14] over just in a few minutes oh isn't that
[55:16] a great holy hush come everywhere does
[55:18] this Stone come towards your place it
[55:20] may be later than we think there see
[55:22] that's exactly scriptural you see it's a
[55:24] stone without hands cut our mountains so
[55:27] one of these days it's going to be that
[55:29] way when you're going to scream for
[55:31] something I said to him you've already
[55:32] had that time God has constantly warned
[55:34] you time after time yeah I said even as
[55:36] my own kid or whoever it is now power is
[55:39] here I can only say what he's told me to
[55:41] say and he'll be here and it was and
[55:43] then all of a sudden here he come the
[55:45] stone cut out of the mountain without
[55:46] him Daniel saw that you know back many
[55:49] years ago Billy know nothing about that
[55:50] but it was a it was a dream sent to him
[55:53] from the Lord now see they claimed to be
[55:56] worshiping that very God that they were
[55:59] making fun of and the same thing has
[56:01] reversed again today by the same reason
[56:05] living in a glare instead of the light
[56:08] great light says a shine all right look
[56:11] what Darkness we're in today look what's
[56:14] going on today look at murder rape
[56:17] Strife wise come to pass I believe it
[56:20] was Billy Graham said his last meeting
[56:21] in 10 years now every citizen of
[56:23] California you have to pack a gun to
[56:25] protect themselves you can't put enough
[56:26] law enforcement the people that's going
[56:28] insane shooting murdering grapes
[56:30] everything see it's just gone wild see
[56:33] upon the streets it's a it's a day we're
[56:36] living in a saw my day see but there is
[56:39] a light shine amen if it only look if it
[56:42] only see look into the word and see
[56:44] what's supposed to be in this hour they
[56:46] would know what's trying to be done
[56:49] now they claimed they're worshiping that
[56:51] light so did they claim this Worship in
[56:53] life but they were worship it in a glare
[56:56] of another light instead of the real he
[56:59] was the light
[57:00] Creeds and traditions in their blinded
[57:03] condition had turned them from the True
[57:05] Light of the promised word
[57:08] the word that God had Vindicated by
[57:11] Jesus the light of the world came and
[57:14] made that word live right exactly
[57:16] through his time exactly through the
[57:17] days he'll be cut off in the midst of
[57:19] the 70 weeks that's right which is a
[57:21] three and a half years of his prophecy
[57:23] the Messiah would come the Prince Edward
[57:25] prophesy in three and a half days of
[57:28] this that he'd be cut off from the
[57:29] living and make atonement and that's
[57:31] exactly he preached three and a half
[57:33] years in the very Psalm that David said
[57:36] my God my God why has Thou forsaken me
[57:38] the 22nd Psalm all my bones they stare
[57:41] at me they wag their heads they pass by
[57:43] me 850 years before him when David sung
[57:46] that song in the spirit and it was
[57:48] considered prophecy and given they're
[57:50] singing them songs in the temple when
[57:51] the same sacrifices hanging on the
[57:53] crossings yeah hands and Pierce today
[57:55] pierce my hands and my feet yes sir be
[57:58] there to why they were living in a glare
[57:59] they didn't see the light
[58:01] could you imagine a sensible person
[58:03] doing that no more not going to imagine
[58:05] a sensible person running down the
[58:07] basement and getting a must and pulling
[58:08] these doors together say I refuse to see
[58:10] there's light it's insanity and a
[58:13] spiritual slip somewhere when a man sees
[58:15] that the Bible is promised this to see
[58:17] it living right out before him and made
[58:18] manifest and then continually stay in
[58:20] those Creeds and things out there that
[58:22] rejected
[58:22] [Music]
[58:23] it's a spiritual delinquency yeah that's
[58:27] exactly right here he was now he was he
[58:30] was the light of the world in the world
[58:31] and he came to his own his own he came
[58:34] into the world the world was made by him
[58:36] and the world knew him not right but as
[58:38] many as did know him to them he gave
[58:40] power to become sons of God for them to
[58:42] believe
[58:43] remember
[58:45] we cannot live by yesterday's life
[58:49] yesterday's light is gone
[58:51] it isn't no more it yesterday's light is
[58:55] only in memory yesterday's sunlight is
[58:57] only a memory arts history we cannot
[59:00] live in yesterday's life
[59:02] no more in the same though it's the same
[59:05] Sun the same Sun but each day it brings
[59:08] forth its strength a little stronger to
[59:11] ripen the grain for the Harvest amen the
[59:14] Sun comes today gets a little stronger
[59:16] each day now it'll get a little stronger
[59:18] a little stronger and to finally the
[59:20] weakness laying there it'll go take in
[59:22] life
[59:22] and while the life will come up then a
[59:25] little stronger a little stronger March
[59:27] April May June July she's in the
[59:31] harvesting you see the same sun shining
[59:34] today and and January or December it's
[59:38] up there bathing that snow and melting
[59:40] it down on that green bringing that
[59:41] water it's the same Sun but that wheat
[59:44] could not live in that same sunlight
[59:46] that's right
[59:48] it can't do it see the sun comes a
[59:51] little stronger each day and the green
[59:53] should be a little more mature to
[59:55] receive the sunlight amen that's what's
[59:59] the matter today the grain that was sold
[1:00:01] in the early fathers back there in
[1:00:03] Luther and Wesleyan it dwarfed
[1:00:07] it can't take the sun the sun kills it
[1:00:09] it refused to grow
[1:00:11] and it kind of it took itself from the
[1:00:14] stalk light and come over here and made
[1:00:16] itself alone little thing to become a
[1:00:18] husk then no life in it
[1:00:21] the greens should be maturing and
[1:00:24] getting stronger as the sun becomes
[1:00:27] stronger each day now let's watch a
[1:00:29] minute we watch the church ages there's
[1:00:32] seven Church ages is those Church ages
[1:00:35] each one watch how he spoke to them what
[1:00:36] would do how the grain would mature and
[1:00:39] come down to this last hour here this
[1:00:42] last hour that we're living so the
[1:00:44] churches must do the same thing see the
[1:00:47] churches now look Luther Luther
[1:00:49] green and Luther was a green and he sold
[1:00:53] it all right so was Wesley and also so
[1:00:57] was Pentecostal so was the Baptist the
[1:01:00] Nazarene but you see now Luther would
[1:01:03] not go back and live in the light of the
[1:01:05] first denomination Catholic no sir he
[1:01:07] was another line that was God write me
[1:01:10] something now a little minority come out
[1:01:12] of that that Lutheran Revival they come
[1:01:15] along the Wesley Revival and then that
[1:01:17] well they couldn't go back and do the
[1:01:19] lutherans
[1:01:20] and our clown come the Pentecostals and
[1:01:22] then the Pentecostals organized and done
[1:01:24] the same thing taking the husk notice
[1:01:26] but the grain goes right out
[1:01:29] now we're in another age amen why won't
[1:01:32] they receive it why won't they see that
[1:01:34] the grain is matured here's the promised
[1:01:35] word for this date why don't they see it
[1:01:37] because they're living in Lutheran glare
[1:01:40] West Sinclair Baptist Claire Pentecostal
[1:01:44] glaze they're living in the glare of
[1:01:46] another light
[1:01:49] that's the reason they can't receive the
[1:01:51] light of the total word being a
[1:01:53] Vindicated as God promised them Seven
[1:01:55] Seals where the whole mystery was
[1:01:57] revealed we'll come back and tell why
[1:01:59] these Mysteries is done like that and
[1:02:01] yet when that comes in they walk farther
[1:02:03] away from it than ever amen they're
[1:02:05] without excuse God has done it through
[1:02:08] Spirit through Revelations he's he's
[1:02:10] proved it perfectly by scientific and
[1:02:12] everything else that it's the truth that
[1:02:15] it's the truth and still they want to
[1:02:17] live in a Pentecostal player I am the
[1:02:19] assemblies I am the one this I'm the
[1:02:21] Church of God I'm this see living in a
[1:02:23] glare of at age 40 50 years ago living
[1:02:26] in a Lutheran living in a Wesley a
[1:02:29] Baptist a presbyterian or some Nazarene
[1:02:31] glare of another church age that went on
[1:02:34] an organized and done the same thing and
[1:02:36] refused and reject the light when it's
[1:02:37] actually shining and you're living in a
[1:02:39] mirage amen
[1:02:43] but you're not to hurt you but to wake
[1:02:46] you up you're living in a mirage what if
[1:02:49] Jesus said well you're blind and you're
[1:02:51] leading the blind they couldn't he tried
[1:02:54] to tell him and then they said let him
[1:02:55] alone
[1:02:57] if a blind leads a blind they'll all
[1:02:59] fall in a ditch amen that's the hour of
[1:03:01] comfortable yes
[1:03:03] sir go to stagger I can't help it that's
[1:03:06] right that's all I can do I've done
[1:03:08] exactly I've done this at your command
[1:03:10] board
[1:03:13] since 19 and 33 down on the river when
[1:03:16] that light there you see shining down
[1:03:18] his spin right here the Tabernacle and
[1:03:19] witness to you all these years and
[1:03:20] everything it says come to pass
[1:03:22] amen and continue they go on oh my God
[1:03:26] let the blind lead the block amen amen
[1:03:28] I'll just wait
[1:03:30] for that hour he'll arrived one of these
[1:03:32] days notice living in a glare of Luther
[1:03:35] living in the glare of Wesley
[1:03:38] living in them glares back there that's
[1:03:40] the reason they can't see true life if
[1:03:42] they would stop for a few minutes
[1:03:45] and just pick up the vibe and read it
[1:03:47] they would see that the this is light
[1:03:50] promise for the hour amen
[1:03:53] yeah we're going to take some of these
[1:03:55] things in a minute he promised according
[1:03:57] to Malachi 4 these things were happening
[1:04:00] he promised all through the scriptures
[1:04:02] they would happen see notice Israel also
[1:04:05] our type in the journey
[1:04:07] look eating Manna which was her light
[1:04:11] life they give them strength life is
[1:04:14] that right Israel could not eat manna
[1:04:17] that was yesterday it fella amen it was
[1:04:20] contaminated
[1:04:21] it was rotten amen it was no good for
[1:04:24] them they'd die over it the matter that
[1:04:27] kept them alive yesterday would kill him
[1:04:28] today the Bible said it got germs in it
[1:04:31] contaminated and the man they had to get
[1:04:33] Humana every day
[1:04:39] and what is it the people that live on
[1:04:43] man up Luther Wesleyan them back in
[1:04:45] there you're eating contaminated stuff
[1:04:48] that's killing you spiritually
[1:04:53] it's killing you dead in your Traditions
[1:04:58] yes it is Luther's matter will not work
[1:05:02] for methodists Methodist Manna would not
[1:05:05] work for Pentecost Pentecostal Manna
[1:05:08] will not work for the day
[1:05:11] see what I mean every day it come
[1:05:15] day by day fresh
[1:05:18] and so has it to the church ages
[1:05:23] Luther's Manna was a message of
[1:05:25] justification
[1:05:26] Wesley's message was a manifestation of
[1:05:29] sanctification
[1:05:31] Pentecostal was a restoration of the
[1:05:33] gifts
[1:05:34] but this is introducing the hatstone
[1:05:43] contrary to all of it and yet it's the
[1:05:46] same light for the matured like the same
[1:05:48] sunshine today will be right in the
[1:05:50] grain for the Harvest in July
[1:05:53] see what I mean but the light today
[1:05:55] won't do any good back there in July
[1:05:58] is stronger the wheat's more advanced
[1:06:01] it's ready to take it
[1:06:03] amen amen certainly is
[1:06:08] it couldn't take it now it can then the
[1:06:11] season wasn't right that it is now
[1:06:13] you can't go against God's nature he's
[1:06:15] got a law
[1:06:17] in a contrary that law kills your plant
[1:06:21] you've got to go according to God's
[1:06:23] spoken laws and his laws is his word any
[1:06:25] law is a word spoken
[1:06:28] and a word is a thought manifested see
[1:06:30] now we we know that that's true but
[1:06:34] vision is what the word of God or
[1:06:36] something foretold or a forecast of an
[1:06:37] even
[1:06:38] and a vision that the prophets had in
[1:06:41] Jesus had Paul hadn't alone I'm telling
[1:06:43] this day was the forecast and what would
[1:06:45] happen amen and here we see the forecast
[1:06:47] being made manifest that people don't
[1:06:49] even recognize it
[1:06:52] see what I mean now yesterday's man look
[1:06:57] here did you ever notice the sun s-u-n
[1:07:01] has traveled East to the West
[1:07:05] as this one each time did you notice
[1:07:08] that
[1:07:09] and notice the church ages did the same
[1:07:12] thing
[1:07:13] what the sun
[1:07:15] s-o-s-u-n started in the East and
[1:07:19] civilization has traveled with the sun
[1:07:21] God's spoken light from the living
[1:07:24] they've come on following the sun see
[1:07:26] where it was going life itself when
[1:07:28] you're born it's like a son you're born
[1:07:29] right onto the setting of the Sun
[1:07:31] from your birth to the setting of The
[1:07:33] Sun man has traveled Westward always
[1:07:36] oldest civilization we have is China in
[1:07:39] the Eastern countries Jerusalem and
[1:07:42] notice she keeps traveling Westward as
[1:07:45] it goes and as it goes on and on to the
[1:07:48] West so has the church age travel the
[1:07:51] same way by the s-o-n of God Amen well
[1:07:55] Paul their early church start in the
[1:07:58] East it went from there jumped across
[1:08:01] the the the the sea over into Germany
[1:08:07] has made three pulls
[1:08:09] looking from Asia and Palestine it
[1:08:14] jumped across the ocean to Germany that
[1:08:17] was Luther and jumped from Luther across
[1:08:20] the English Channel over into England by
[1:08:22] Wesley and from Wesley she jumped to the
[1:08:24] West Coast to the United States and this
[1:08:27] if you go any further it's coming back
[1:08:30] East again amen this is the evening time
[1:08:36] all right look how the church ages this
[1:08:39] fall Luther Paul first back in the early
[1:08:42] age they come down the island irenis and
[1:08:45] so forth on down into France from there
[1:08:47] over into Germany over into England
[1:08:49] constantly going west
[1:08:55] [Applause]
[1:08:57] and what does the Bible say about this
[1:09:00] Slave stage
[1:09:02] see geographically chronologists anyway
[1:09:06] you want to take it scripturally first
[1:09:08] scripture of course first
[1:09:10] evidence
[1:09:13] historically
[1:09:15] any way you want to take it we're at the
[1:09:17] end
[1:09:18] the last Church age and watch as it went
[1:09:23] forward it grew stronger and stronger
[1:09:25] and so has the real little minority of
[1:09:28] the church wrote from justification
[1:09:30] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:09:32] and now to the coming Capstone shaping
[1:09:35] itself up no more organizations after
[1:09:37] this there won't be tomorrow Champions
[1:09:40] see we're on the west just to show you
[1:09:42] through all types and everything else
[1:09:43] and look at those three jumps three
[1:09:46] fools we'll get into that tonight see
[1:09:48] see how we're at the end time it's just
[1:09:51] uh s-u-n-s travel like s-o-e s-o-n like
[1:09:55] s-u-n -u-n the church has come the same
[1:09:57] thing from the seven Church ages and so
[1:09:59] forth civilizations moved right on to
[1:10:01] the west and the church has moved right
[1:10:03] on to the west and now if we go any
[1:10:05] further than what we are now we come
[1:10:07] back East again
[1:10:09] if you leave the West Coast you go right
[1:10:10] back into China Japan right back in
[1:10:13] again seven thousand miles across to go
[1:10:14] right back to the east again so East and
[1:10:16] West has met
[1:10:18] that's all in it we're at the end
[1:10:20] there's nothing left
[1:10:21] and the same thing
[1:10:23] has happened today it happened back
[1:10:25] there
[1:10:26] the same thing is met at the West that
[1:10:29] was met at the East the people living in
[1:10:31] a glare of another light that was
[1:10:34] absolutely trying to show forth the
[1:10:36] light was come and reject it because it
[1:10:38] got the glare instead of the light
[1:10:41] oh and there was great light in the land
[1:10:44] of the Gentiles zeberland nothing of
[1:10:48] Gallup and Galilee land of the Gentiles
[1:10:51] this is the seventh Church age remember
[1:10:53] and each time that sun began to shine in
[1:10:57] the East is the same shun the shines in
[1:10:59] the west amen and The Same Spirit that's
[1:11:02] been all down Through the Ages like that
[1:11:05] is the same sun today only what is it
[1:11:07] just like writing in the season the sun
[1:11:10] is now will be the same Sun it brightens
[1:11:13] their grand this fall this autumn see
[1:11:16] but what is it it's this sun plus what
[1:11:19] it will be amen and today in this last
[1:11:23] age is what they wear plus this
[1:11:27] and then they will live back there as a
[1:11:29] door yeah go down into a busty old inner
[1:11:32] in our own nominational basement the
[1:11:34] Creed and puller blinds us I just refuse
[1:11:36] to sit it's all nonsense
[1:11:38] and when the very Bible that they claim
[1:11:40] to believe is being identified by the
[1:11:42] same Holy Spirit bringing light in the
[1:11:46] last days
[1:11:47] did you notice and watch real close
[1:11:49] Sarah and Malachi hi a lot of that the
[1:11:53] faith of the fathers to this children
[1:11:55] the children to the fathers The Same
[1:11:58] Spirit weren't raised back God or what
[1:12:00] raises here again the same thing they
[1:12:02] just Vice diversity exactly sitting
[1:12:04] right back again East and West is math
[1:12:07] all right
[1:12:08] just exactly right under our face and
[1:12:10] yet they don't see it that's right why
[1:12:12] no wonder Jesus said just let him alone
[1:12:14] then they're blind lead the blind
[1:12:15] they'll all fall in the ditch
[1:12:18] the light of other ages only reflected
[1:12:20] this life
[1:12:22] see the sun today only reflects as a
[1:12:24] reflection of the Sun that will be this
[1:12:26] July or August of God for the Harvest
[1:12:28] and the son of Luther Martin Luther and
[1:12:30] Wesley and Sankey Finney knocks Calvin
[1:12:32] Moody all their mothers and great men
[1:12:34] back in there that had those like John
[1:12:36] Smith of the Baptist Church and
[1:12:37] Alexander Campbell the Camelot Church of
[1:12:39] the so-called Disciples of Christ
[1:12:41] Christian church and whatever more names
[1:12:42] he got for him all them men back there
[1:12:44] in their ages was only reflecting what
[1:12:46] it will be here at the end and then here
[1:12:48] are the children immediately after them
[1:12:50] Founders what do they do they didn't
[1:12:52] stay on the stalk they pulled away from
[1:12:54] it and made themselves a little husk
[1:12:56] thing out here which you get away from
[1:12:57] the real source of life you have no life
[1:13:00] ever you take a husk off the plane and
[1:13:02] play lager in the crown it'll lay down
[1:13:05] and so are you trying to eat rotten
[1:13:07] tomatoes from back in that days the
[1:13:10] Harvest is Right amen Jesus has a
[1:13:13] tablespoon
[1:13:15] oh right the food of the day by the
[1:13:18] gospel like the defense
[1:13:23] the Saints eat the bread
[1:13:26] just think the old husk of yesterday see
[1:13:30] don't plant it back there it's rotten it
[1:13:33] cannot it cannot stay with it no sir it
[1:13:37] will not do no good it won't grow it's
[1:13:39] all for the life and the word is alive
[1:13:41] amen that's right the husk drops off a
[1:13:44] little beard Falls away things like that
[1:13:46] it just denominates itself and drops off
[1:13:48] it refuses to go on with the life but
[1:13:50] the light vindicates it oh my yesterday
[1:13:53] it's oh my how we are to see that see
[1:13:57] that the rotten things of yesterday
[1:13:59] don't eat them today
[1:14:01] okay it's got worms in it you know these
[1:14:04] little wiggle Tails I call them I don't
[1:14:05] know why I don't know much about germ
[1:14:08] not but I know we always call them
[1:14:09] wiggle tails
[1:14:10] it gets in anything when it gets a
[1:14:12] little rotten see I don't want it then
[1:14:15] hey if you're satisfied with it go ahead
[1:14:17] but not me but remember you said then
[1:14:21] why was it good yesterday if you only
[1:14:23] knew that the very little Hull that was
[1:14:26] on the wheat at the beginning if it
[1:14:28] abides in the green it makes the grain
[1:14:31] further
[1:14:32] that's the very thing that makes a wheat
[1:14:34] flour yeah yeah
[1:14:37] is what was yesterday but if it
[1:14:39] separates itself from the green and
[1:14:40] don't mature then it goes away right but
[1:14:44] if it goes through the process of
[1:14:45] life-giving process as it dies out it
[1:14:48] just Blends into something else it makes
[1:14:49] a grain amen if it isn't where does it
[1:14:52] come from
[1:14:53] amen amen you get it
[1:14:59] amen you get it
[1:15:01] praise God
[1:15:03] amen I've been enjoying this
[1:15:06] message very much
[1:15:09] um I want to go through the questions
[1:15:10] now
[1:15:12] if we can pull you out back up so what
[1:15:15] guides you to the light let's go back to
[1:15:17] paragraph 91. now as brother Branham
[1:15:20] goes through this he adds so much more
[1:15:22] to it I'm just going to highlight a
[1:15:23] couple phrases he says here in a few
[1:15:25] parts he talks about
[1:15:27] but
[1:15:28] you could end up highlighting your whole
[1:15:30] book
[1:15:31] what guides you to the light paragraph
[1:15:33] 91 at the top of page 17. now we find
[1:15:36] that the wise men the wise men of old
[1:15:38] followed the god-given substance they
[1:15:40] followed the word of God to the light
[1:15:42] because it was the word that brought
[1:15:44] life now you say how did they follow
[1:15:46] well they were kind of Magis we
[1:15:47] understand and then we find out that
[1:15:49] Balaam the prophet back in numbers 24 17
[1:15:52] beta was kind of a magi himself he was a
[1:15:55] prophet truly and he prophesied here and
[1:15:57] said a star would rise out of Jacob
[1:15:59] and when these wise men saw the word of
[1:16:01] God said a star would rise out of Jacob
[1:16:03] they followed that little god-given
[1:16:04] token to the source of eternal life so
[1:16:08] will wise men today who is not blinded
[1:16:10] by Creeds and will follow the god-given
[1:16:12] spoken word till they see the fullness
[1:16:14] of the power of God blooming forth in
[1:16:16] this hour
[1:16:17] they see it and they know that it's here
[1:16:20] in the scripture God promised it for
[1:16:22] this day
[1:16:23] so we're looking here he's showing
[1:16:26] through the through Balaam Balaam laid
[1:16:28] down a prophecy that a star will rise
[1:16:30] out of Jacob and they saw it in the
[1:16:32] heavens amen and when they saw in the
[1:16:34] heavens they knew that was the prophecy
[1:16:36] and they followed that word all the way
[1:16:39] to the manifestation of that word until
[1:16:41] they found the baby or for the young
[1:16:43] child when they found the young child
[1:16:44] let's go down to paragraph 94.
[1:16:47] oh we have seen a star in the east and
[1:16:49] we come to worship him and then they
[1:16:51] lined up in Jerusalem the denominational
[1:16:53] headquarters they didn't have the answer
[1:16:54] they went up and down the street crying
[1:16:57] where is he born King of the Jews they
[1:16:59] know nothing about it so they called on
[1:17:01] the word to find out they had followed
[1:17:03] knowed that star was leading them to the
[1:17:06] eternal life guide us through thy
[1:17:08] Perfect Light and the word is what
[1:17:09] guides you to the light so what guides
[1:17:12] you to the light the word
[1:17:14] so that's why we don't just take
[1:17:16] willy-nilly anything that happens it's
[1:17:18] got to be a manifestation of the word
[1:17:20] it's the word that likes us to the light
[1:17:21] amen and when the word is made manifest
[1:17:24] it's light and it's life that's the
[1:17:26] source of life for us
[1:17:28] amens we must come where the word of
[1:17:30] word of the word is made manifest where
[1:17:33] the word is made light and it becomes
[1:17:35] our life
[1:17:36] and the word is what guide you to the
[1:17:37] light and the light is what makes the
[1:17:39] word Vindicated notice they were wise
[1:17:42] men
[1:17:42] paragraph 95 and wise men today the
[1:17:45] wisdom of this world is foolishness to
[1:17:47] God all your scientists and you people
[1:17:49] who are depending on some great
[1:17:50] scholarship are something another
[1:17:52] telling you how to split an atom it
[1:17:54] can't give you life there's nothing can
[1:17:56] give you life but the spoken word of God
[1:17:58] it's only where that life can come is
[1:18:02] through his spoken word so I am so glad
[1:18:05] amen that God gave us his word amen and
[1:18:08] then he makes the word live in our age
[1:18:10] and that brings light and life
[1:18:13] amen
[1:18:17] question number two why did mankind need
[1:18:20] to learn how to split an atom I thought
[1:18:22] this was absolutely fascinating
[1:18:24] paragraph 96 at the bottom of this page
[1:18:27] and that's all right to know how to
[1:18:28] split an atom I wish they'd never found
[1:18:31] it out that they have to do it because
[1:18:34] this world is hanging today it had to
[1:18:37] happen to burst these big holes in the
[1:18:39] earth to let that lava come forth and
[1:18:41] rejuvenate this world again to make a
[1:18:44] new Earth where the righteous will walk
[1:18:46] out upon the dust of the wicked where
[1:18:48] sin will be forgotten everything has a
[1:18:50] way of renewing itself and man who was
[1:18:53] give given to live on this Earth by his
[1:18:55] own wisdom taking the tree of knowledge
[1:18:57] instead of the tree of life he'll
[1:18:59] destroy the Earth that God give him to
[1:19:01] live on but those who are still on the
[1:19:03] Tree of Life shall come to a new heavens
[1:19:05] and a new Earth where there is no
[1:19:07] sickness or death
[1:19:09] so why didn't man in this scientific age
[1:19:12] at the end time think about when man
[1:19:15] began to learn how to split an atom and
[1:19:17] make an A-bomb amen it was between World
[1:19:19] War one and World War II it was the same
[1:19:21] time that there was an end time Prophet
[1:19:23] on the scene and everything was being
[1:19:25] set the stage was being set the
[1:19:26] finishing of everything took place in
[1:19:29] that man's Lifetime and that's when man
[1:19:31] learned how to split a nap and made it
[1:19:33] made an atomic bomb and what did he need
[1:19:35] to learn that for so that he could blow
[1:19:38] holes in the Earth crust to let the lava
[1:19:40] out to rejuvenate the Earth for a
[1:19:42] millennium
[1:19:44] my goodness this word is too perfect
[1:19:47] amen everything is too perfect the
[1:19:49] timing is too perfect and man will
[1:19:51] destroy himself man creates his own Hell
[1:19:53] by nuclear fallout
[1:19:56] man burns off the Earth by his own
[1:19:58] wisdom and not taking the word but
[1:20:00] taking his own wisdom and God allowed
[1:20:02] him to go that way and God is going to
[1:20:04] allow man to go far enough to create his
[1:20:06] own hell on Earth which will bring the
[1:20:08] purification of the earth amen for a
[1:20:10] millennial Reign for the honeymoon
[1:20:13] and who's going to do it it's not God
[1:20:15] it's man doing it himself
[1:20:18] so God allowed him to learn to split an
[1:20:21] atom because God knows amen that he's
[1:20:23] got to blow the holes in the Earth cross
[1:20:26] to let the lava out
[1:20:28] praise be to God he's going to
[1:20:30] rejuvenate this world with atomic and
[1:20:31] Volcanic fire
[1:20:33] and now how will the volcanic Fire come
[1:20:35] it'll start by atomic bombs
[1:20:40] so when you hear the news Everybody's
[1:20:42] scared about atomic bombs they ought to
[1:20:45] be scared
[1:20:47] they're going to destroy themselves with
[1:20:48] them but for us we're not scared because
[1:20:50] it's a Rejuvenation of the Earth for the
[1:20:53] millennial reign
[1:20:54] praise God build more bombs
[1:20:59] that's what's going on that's why the
[1:21:01] tension is there that's why the nuclear
[1:21:03] armed race is there that's what it's all
[1:21:04] about
[1:21:06] is a rejuvenation for the millennium
[1:21:10] that's why we see the news differently
[1:21:12] than everybody else sees it
[1:21:14] because we've already been told
[1:21:18] amen question number three why did they
[1:21:20] reject the Messiah
[1:21:21] now uh let me go here to page
[1:21:28] uh
[1:21:31] well let's start back let's we'll lead
[1:21:33] into it let's go to page 113.
[1:21:36] page 130 I'm sorry paragraph 113 page
[1:21:39] 21.
[1:21:40] page 21 paragraph 113.
[1:21:48] stop just a minute stop your tape
[1:21:49] recorder and ask the question why would
[1:21:51] religious men good men why would Joseph
[1:21:53] question C because he never searched the
[1:21:56] scriptures
[1:21:57] why did the priest question one reason
[1:21:59] they didn't they knew it Nicodemus well
[1:22:02] expressed it he said Rabbi we know that
[1:22:04] you're a teacher from God no man could
[1:22:06] do what you do except God be with him
[1:22:08] we're aware of that but what was it
[1:22:10] their Traditions kept them from doing it
[1:22:13] then when why were they did they reject
[1:22:16] the Messiah why did they reject that
[1:22:18] light here's the word that they node was
[1:22:20] coming to pass but when the word was
[1:22:22] made manifest to show that the word of
[1:22:24] God had been fulfilled compare that with
[1:22:27] today
[1:22:28] when they're written in the word that
[1:22:30] would take place
[1:22:32] what would take place then why did those
[1:22:34] men reject it teachers because they were
[1:22:36] living in a glare of another line that
[1:22:38] is it they was living in a glare why did
[1:22:41] they reject the Messiah because they was
[1:22:42] living in the glare of another light
[1:22:44] of another age amen and brother Benham
[1:22:47] tells us in the middle of paragraph 114
[1:22:49] compare that with today the reason
[1:22:51] brother Ben is spending so much time
[1:22:52] talking about Jesus and his ministry and
[1:22:55] the Pharisees and the rejection is
[1:22:57] because he wants you to see the parallel
[1:22:58] with today
[1:23:00] foreign
[1:23:01] it's the same thing it's the same thing
[1:23:03] they're doing today the reason they
[1:23:05] turned it down is because they were
[1:23:06] living in the glare of another light
[1:23:08] now they was living in a glare of what
[1:23:11] Moses said they claimed they was living
[1:23:13] in the glare of what another age had
[1:23:14] passed by and that's the very reason
[1:23:16] today that this message that Jesus
[1:23:18] Christ is still the same is turned down
[1:23:21] because the people are living in glares
[1:23:23] of other ages the same reason they'll
[1:23:26] turn it down now
[1:23:28] this we notice and Webster says that a
[1:23:30] glare is a kind of a false light a glare
[1:23:32] is a false light same thing that glares
[1:23:35] like a mirage on the road you go down
[1:23:37] the road and many of you driving cars
[1:23:39] and look down ahead of you when you see
[1:23:41] the sun on the ground it reflects a
[1:23:42] light like a mirage look like there's
[1:23:44] water all over the road but when you get
[1:23:46] there there's nothing there it's only a
[1:23:47] false Mirage the glare of a true light
[1:23:50] that's what the devil is doing today is
[1:23:52] showing people a mirage a council of
[1:23:54] churches a group of denominations which
[1:23:56] will turn out to be false because it's
[1:23:59] because there is a real light shining
[1:24:02] there has to be a real light to create a
[1:24:04] mirage
[1:24:06] and they're looking back on the
[1:24:08] reflection of a day gone by amen and
[1:24:11] missing where the light is shining today
[1:24:13] amen because they're caught in the in a
[1:24:15] mirage they're caught in the glare of a
[1:24:17] previous age
[1:24:19] but there was a real light shining in
[1:24:21] that day
[1:24:22] a genuine True light shining in that day
[1:24:25] amen but they're stuck in a mirage it's
[1:24:27] because there was a real light shining
[1:24:29] that real lights that real light wasn't
[1:24:32] shining a mirage couldn't be there real
[1:24:34] light shines and they're living in a
[1:24:36] glare of another age another thing for
[1:24:38] its hit and it's passed on now a glare
[1:24:41] this Mirage is false it's a glare of the
[1:24:43] Sun
[1:24:45] let's go over to paragraph 123.
[1:24:48] on page 22 at the bottom of page 22.
[1:24:53] and still they didn't see it their eyes
[1:24:55] were put out with a glare see the glare
[1:24:57] of something else that they had taken
[1:24:58] what the true spoken word was now think
[1:25:01] of it think of it they claim that they
[1:25:04] believed that word but their Traditions
[1:25:06] had turned their faces from the true
[1:25:08] word to a glare therefore they couldn't
[1:25:10] see the real thing
[1:25:12] they were blind to it
[1:25:14] so is it today so has it been in every
[1:25:17] age the true word shines but they have
[1:25:20] been so traditionalized that they can't
[1:25:22] see the word they're looking at a glare
[1:25:25] and they're blind a glare will blind you
[1:25:27] there's an arc off of it it'll blind you
[1:25:30] it it will
[1:25:32] when Jesus said you were blind leading
[1:25:34] the blind they should have been able to
[1:25:36] see it to see who what who he was but
[1:25:39] they didn't because they was living in
[1:25:41] that glare now a glare as I said is a
[1:25:44] false light a mirage a false conception
[1:25:46] of the True Light false conception it's
[1:25:48] something that's supposed to look like
[1:25:50] it but it isn't that
[1:25:52] so they're stuck in the glare of another
[1:25:54] age paragraph 133 on the next page
[1:26:03] he proved to be the right he was the
[1:26:06] very light that they claimed they
[1:26:07] worshiped they claim to be worshiping
[1:26:09] that light and so is it today they claim
[1:26:13] they are worshiping that that
[1:26:14] Pentecostal claimant they claim they are
[1:26:16] so blind that they can't see it they
[1:26:19] organize and put a glare on their face a
[1:26:21] tradition that some people set together
[1:26:24] and said well we'll go and make this and
[1:26:26] this and this and that now we're going
[1:26:28] to come to why that has to happen the
[1:26:29] Lord willing notice his Works was the
[1:26:32] Living Word itself what he did was the
[1:26:35] Living Word itself showing he was that
[1:26:37] light that had been promised since the
[1:26:39] beginning of the world he was that line
[1:26:41] his light on the promised word of the
[1:26:43] age made it live to exactly what the
[1:26:45] promise said it would do but they had it
[1:26:47] so turned around until they couldn't see
[1:26:49] it but he was the light of the age
[1:26:53] let's keep reading let's read a couple
[1:26:55] more he was the light that they claimed
[1:26:56] to be worshiping they thought that they
[1:26:58] were worshiping the very God of creation
[1:27:00] they was living and worshiping a glare
[1:27:02] and Jesus said you worship me in vain
[1:27:04] teaching for Doctrine the traditions of
[1:27:06] man and not the word he is the word and
[1:27:09] he was the word made manifest they ought
[1:27:11] to have noted
[1:27:12] I hope that can break through everywhere
[1:27:15] it's urgency that is the word made
[1:27:17] manifest oh we have the word why the
[1:27:19] word everybody pack a Bible that wants
[1:27:22] to but when the word is Vindicated made
[1:27:24] manifest why say well we believe yes sir
[1:27:28] they believe all the way along so does
[1:27:30] Satan
[1:27:31] those Pharisees who would condemn them
[1:27:34] not believing who would condemn them not
[1:27:36] believing but they didn't believe the
[1:27:38] word for the hour they were worshiping
[1:27:40] the glare of something else it's the
[1:27:42] same thing they're doing today we're
[1:27:44] keeping up Luther's Traditions or
[1:27:46] Wesley's traditions and the rest of them
[1:27:47] Pentecostal Traditions but what of the
[1:27:49] hour the Pharisees was keeping up their
[1:27:52] Traditions but behind their tradition
[1:27:54] was the true word of God coming to shine
[1:27:56] forth and when it did it blinded their
[1:27:58] eyes they couldn't see it because they
[1:28:00] was watching something else so is it
[1:28:03] today may God let that soak in until it
[1:28:06] really hits home to the people that
[1:28:08] would believe it it's later than you
[1:28:10] think I love at the top of this page
[1:28:12] when brother Benham said we have the
[1:28:14] word why the word everybody packs a
[1:28:17] Bible that wants to the word
[1:28:20] but when the word is Vindicated made
[1:28:22] manifest then he goes right to the
[1:28:24] Pharisees you can't tell the Pharisees
[1:28:26] that they didn't believe the word they
[1:28:28] were carrying around Scrolls they were
[1:28:29] believing the Bible they were believing
[1:28:31] what Moses wrote everybody today that
[1:28:33] claims to be a Christian can a Bible and
[1:28:35] say they believed the word but there's
[1:28:37] one critical part of the word that
[1:28:39] they're failing to believe and that's
[1:28:40] the word that is made in flesh today
[1:28:44] the word that is light today is the part
[1:28:47] that they're failing and when they're
[1:28:48] failing that they're living in the
[1:28:50] Mirage the glare of a previous age and
[1:28:53] that glare won't bring life only present
[1:28:56] day light will bring life
[1:28:58] that's what's so critical about uh this
[1:29:01] message coming this hour and what
[1:29:02] brother bam is trying to get to the
[1:29:04] people to see is yes you believe you
[1:29:06] believe in what's been done you believe
[1:29:08] in what's been said you believe in
[1:29:09] what's been wrote but you're rejecting
[1:29:12] Christ today
[1:29:15] so all of that believing in what's been
[1:29:17] done amen is not bringing life unless
[1:29:20] you come to life which is life for the
[1:29:22] day
[1:29:24] amen
[1:29:26] let's look at one more paragraph 156.
[1:29:31] let's go over to 156 on the bottom of
[1:29:34] page 28. still in the same question why
[1:29:37] did they reject the Messiah
[1:29:42] brother Benham is typing it with this
[1:29:44] day remember he talks about civilization
[1:29:47] and the gospel has traveled from east to
[1:29:48] west civilizations come from east to
[1:29:50] west it's traveled from China he says
[1:29:52] the oldest civilization all the way
[1:29:54] across now it's up against the West
[1:29:56] Coast United States it can't go any
[1:29:57] further or it'll be back east in Japan
[1:29:59] and China again he said so that's an
[1:30:01] indication that we've come to the end
[1:30:04] he said the gospels travel the same way
[1:30:06] he says it went from it went from
[1:30:08] Palestine across the Mediterranean Sea
[1:30:11] up into Germany and Europe it crossed
[1:30:13] the uh English Channel over into England
[1:30:15] and Wesley's day then it crossed the
[1:30:17] Atlantic Ocean to come to the United
[1:30:18] States he said that was three pulls of
[1:30:20] the Gospel
[1:30:22] he said now it's going all the way to
[1:30:23] the West Coast it can't go everything's
[1:30:25] finished it's done East is met West
[1:30:28] we're at the end and what they're doing
[1:30:30] now that this Messiah is here is the
[1:30:32] same thing they did when the Messiah
[1:30:33] came the first time
[1:30:35] showing who's here and who's being
[1:30:38] rejected
[1:30:40] amen
[1:30:42] paragraph 156 here at the bottom of 28.
[1:30:45] but the grain goes right on now we're in
[1:30:48] another age
[1:30:50] why won't they receive it why won't they
[1:30:52] see that the grain has matured here is
[1:30:54] the promised word for the day why don't
[1:30:57] they see it because they're living in
[1:30:58] Luther and glare Wesley and glare
[1:30:59] Baptist glare Pentecostal glare they're
[1:31:01] living the glare of another line that's
[1:31:03] the reason they can't receive the light
[1:31:05] of the total word being Vindicated as
[1:31:07] God promised them Seven Seals where the
[1:31:10] whole mystery was revealed would come
[1:31:12] back and tell why these Mysteries was
[1:31:14] done like that and yet yet when that
[1:31:17] comes in they walk further away from it
[1:31:19] than ever they're without excuse God has
[1:31:22] done it through Spirit through
[1:31:23] Revelations he's proved it perfectly by
[1:31:25] scientific and everything else that it's
[1:31:28] the truth that it it it's the truth and
[1:31:31] still they want to live in a Pentecostal
[1:31:33] glare I'm the assemblies I'm the one
[1:31:35] that's I'm the Church of God I'm this
[1:31:36] see living in the glare of age 40 50
[1:31:39] years ago living in the Lutheran glare
[1:31:41] living in a Wesley a Baptist a
[1:31:44] presbyterian or some Nazarene glare of
[1:31:45] another church age that went on and
[1:31:47] organized and done the same thing and
[1:31:49] refuse and read reject the light when
[1:31:51] it's actually Shining
[1:31:54] my the same thing that happened two
[1:31:57] thousand years ago was happening again
[1:31:58] today
[1:32:01] I had the question question number four
[1:32:03] what is the light there's so many
[1:32:05] answers for this but there's something
[1:32:06] brother bam says specifically I want to
[1:32:08] look at and we'll go back to paragraph
[1:32:10] 125.
[1:32:13] at the top part of page 23.
[1:32:17] what is light
[1:32:19] it says now a glare as I said is a false
[1:32:21] light of Mirage a false conception of
[1:32:23] the True Light false conception is
[1:32:25] something that's supposed to look like
[1:32:27] it but it isn't that
[1:32:29] now the only way they could tell the
[1:32:30] difference because the very things that
[1:32:32] Jesus did proved who he was that he was
[1:32:34] the light they thought they was in the
[1:32:37] light but now if you just stop a minute
[1:32:39] and consider who is in the light then
[1:32:41] now today of such a rational mistake was
[1:32:44] made by the Churchman of that day such a
[1:32:46] rational thing was dead Brethren don't
[1:32:48] you think that it's time that we stopped
[1:32:50] and considered what is life
[1:32:52] let us not make such a rational mistake
[1:32:54] but you're doing it you've already done
[1:32:57] it see and knew it not same as they was
[1:32:59] then now now stop just a minute and find
[1:33:02] out what the word says for today
[1:33:05] so what is the light the light is the
[1:33:08] word shining today
[1:33:10] not that was light in a previous day but
[1:33:14] this is the light the light is what's
[1:33:17] shining today
[1:33:19] amen
[1:33:22] paragraph 159.
[1:33:27] paragraph 159
[1:33:39] notice living in a glare of Luther
[1:33:41] living in a glare of Wesley living in
[1:33:43] them glares back there that's the reason
[1:33:45] they can't see True Light they would
[1:33:47] stop for a minute and just pick up the
[1:33:49] Bible and read it they would see that
[1:33:51] this is light promised for the hour
[1:33:54] that's the light we need and that'll
[1:33:56] lead us into the next question question
[1:33:59] number five
[1:34:01] we cannot live by what kind of light so
[1:34:04] we know we must live by light life comes
[1:34:06] by light but what kind of light will not
[1:34:08] produce life
[1:34:10] let's go back to paragraph 150.
[1:34:14] paragraph 150 at the bottom of page 27.
[1:34:18] remember we cannot live by yesterday's
[1:34:21] light
[1:34:22] so what light can you not what light
[1:34:24] doesn't bring life yesterday's light
[1:34:26] what brings life today's light
[1:34:29] listen did the sun shine yesterday yes
[1:34:32] did that Sunshine produce life yes but
[1:34:36] that Sunshine that shined yesterday will
[1:34:38] not produce life today there has to be a
[1:34:41] light shining today
[1:34:43] and you could have went outside and
[1:34:44] taken a picture of a beautiful bright
[1:34:46] sunny day and you could have brought the
[1:34:48] picture in and say this is light that's
[1:34:50] not light that's only a picture of the
[1:34:53] light that was shining in order to have
[1:34:55] light you must have present tense light
[1:34:58] you to have the real light must be the
[1:35:01] light today
[1:35:02] amen
[1:35:05] remember we cannot live by yesterday's
[1:35:07] light yesterday's light is gone it isn't
[1:35:09] no more it's yesterday's light is only a
[1:35:11] memory yesterday sunlight is only a
[1:35:14] memory or it's history we cannot live in
[1:35:16] yesterday's light no more and the same
[1:35:18] though it's the same Sun the same Sun
[1:35:20] but each day it brings forth its
[1:35:22] strength a little stronger to ripen the
[1:35:24] grain for the Harvest sea the Sun comes
[1:35:27] today
[1:35:28] and gets a little stronger each day now
[1:35:31] you'll get a little stronger a little
[1:35:32] stronger until finally the wheat that's
[1:35:34] laying there it'll go take life the life
[1:35:37] will come up then the little stronger a
[1:35:39] little stronger March April May June
[1:35:41] July she's in the Harvest and you see
[1:35:43] the same sun shining today in January
[1:35:45] December that's up there bathing the
[1:35:47] snow and melting it down on the grain
[1:35:49] bringing it water it's the same Sun but
[1:35:52] what the wheat could not live in that
[1:35:53] same sunlight in June so brother Branham
[1:35:56] is showing us through the church ages
[1:35:58] it's been the word all along
[1:36:01] it's been the light of the manifested
[1:36:03] word all along it was the light it was
[1:36:06] the light from the first age to the
[1:36:07] seven eight it's the same line just like
[1:36:10] it's the same sunlight in January it's
[1:36:12] the same sunlight in June but what the
[1:36:14] difference is it's intensifying in its
[1:36:17] strength as the seed is maturing
[1:36:20] and so now the the seed that needs to
[1:36:23] live in a hot June July August light to
[1:36:26] come to full rapturing maturity amen
[1:36:29] that plant will not survive in that
[1:36:32] stage in January it can't live it'll die
[1:36:35] so that's why if we come to the very end
[1:36:37] of time when East has met West again
[1:36:39] when the gospels went through three
[1:36:40] pulls it's come to the West it can't
[1:36:43] live in the light of a previous age
[1:36:44] it'll die it has to have the full power
[1:36:47] of the final light to bring it to full
[1:36:49] rapturing maturity
[1:36:52] that's why even today we can never live
[1:36:54] in the past
[1:36:56] we can't live in one we can't just live
[1:36:59] in the first and second pool brother
[1:37:00] benham's Ministry but the third pull
[1:37:02] amen brought Christ to us Amen in brine
[1:37:05] form and we can't even live on our
[1:37:07] experience from yesterday we have to
[1:37:09] have fresh sunlight today
[1:37:12] we have to walk in the light as Christ
[1:37:14] is unfolding himself in US
[1:37:17] it can't be just what happened 50 years
[1:37:19] ago it's got to be what's happening
[1:37:21] today
[1:37:23] we can never stop staying in the present
[1:37:25] tense truth and staying in the sun
[1:37:27] there's no time for us to stop and say
[1:37:29] wasn't that a beautiful light that shone
[1:37:33] it's got to be a beautiful light that's
[1:37:34] shining now
[1:37:36] to keep bringing us into full
[1:37:39] full maturity into the full light
[1:37:43] let's look at paragraph 161 on the
[1:37:46] bottom of page 29. Brother Bear I'm
[1:37:48] going to use another example to share
[1:37:50] the same thought the same concept
[1:37:52] paragraph 161 notice Israel also our
[1:37:55] type in the journey look eating Manna
[1:37:57] which was their light life that give
[1:37:59] them strength life is that right Israel
[1:38:02] could not eat manna that was yesterday
[1:38:04] had fallen fell on them it was
[1:38:06] contaminated it was rotten it was no
[1:38:08] good for them they would die over it the
[1:38:11] manna that kept them alive yesterday
[1:38:12] would kill them today the Bible said
[1:38:15] it's got germs in it contaminated in the
[1:38:17] Manna they had to get new Mana every day
[1:38:20] and what is it the people that live on
[1:38:23] the men of Luther Wesley and them back
[1:38:24] there you're eating contaminated stuff
[1:38:27] that's killing you spiritually
[1:38:29] killing you dead in your Traditions
[1:38:32] yesterday Luther's Manna would not work
[1:38:34] for Methodist Methodist man it would not
[1:38:36] work for Pentecost Pentecostal Mana will
[1:38:39] not work for today see what I mean every
[1:38:41] day it come day by day fresh and so has
[1:38:44] it through the church ages Luther's
[1:38:46] Manna was the message of justification
[1:38:48] Wesley's message was the manifestation
[1:38:50] of sanctification Pentecostal was the
[1:38:52] restoration of gifts but this is
[1:38:54] introducing The Headstone which is
[1:38:56] Christ
[1:38:57] the last day the bride so what is
[1:39:01] introducing The Headstone the last day
[1:39:03] the bride tree which is contrary to all
[1:39:06] of it and yet it's the same light for
[1:39:09] the matured
[1:39:11] paragraph 177.
[1:39:20] then
[1:39:21] then
[1:39:23] hear the children immediately after them
[1:39:25] Founders what do they do they didn't
[1:39:26] stay on the stalk they pulled away from
[1:39:28] it and made themselves a little husk
[1:39:30] thing out here
[1:39:31] which you get away from the real source
[1:39:33] of life you have no life you take a husk
[1:39:35] of the thing and plant it out there in
[1:39:37] the ground it'll lay down and rot and so
[1:39:39] and so are you trying to eat rotten
[1:39:41] manna from back in them days
[1:39:43] the Harvest is ripe Jesus has a table
[1:39:46] spread where the saints of God are fed
[1:39:48] on ripened food of the day
[1:39:51] by The Gospel Light and that vindicates
[1:39:54] and proves that he is here today amen
[1:39:57] the Saints eat the bread
[1:40:00] I don't know about you but I don't want
[1:40:01] any rotten manna
[1:40:03] from a previous day
[1:40:05] and I do not want to live in the glare
[1:40:08] of a previous age and I don't even want
[1:40:10] personally myself to live in the glare
[1:40:13] of a previous experience
[1:40:16] but I want a fresh experience as I walk
[1:40:18] in the light as he's in the light
[1:40:21] as he continues to reveal himself to me
[1:40:24] I want to stay in that light and not
[1:40:26] bank and settle down on something he did
[1:40:28] for me a year ago 10 years ago but I
[1:40:31] want to keep walking with him as he's in
[1:40:33] the light
[1:40:34] I want to see him as he is I want to be
[1:40:37] where the fresh Manna is I want to be I

[1:40:49] stayed back in Luther's day they dwarfed

[1:40:55] stayed back in Luther's light and they
[1:40:56] dwarfed they'd never come to full
[1:40:58] maturity
[1:40:59] and God help us to come to this message
[1:41:01] and dwarf
[1:41:03] to stay in part of it but not go all the
[1:41:06] way
[1:41:07] to stay in part of the ministry amen

[1:41:12] the revealing of the full word
[1:41:14] I say God help us not to come to this
[1:41:16] message endure for anywhere but help me
[1:41:18] to come all the way into the full
[1:41:20] expression of Jesus Christ
[1:41:22] and all that he has for me I want and
[1:41:24] all that he reveals to me I want to walk
[1:41:26] in and day by day I want to keep my
[1:41:28] experience fresh in the Light of Christ
