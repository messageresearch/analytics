[19:52] [Music]
[20:00] God bless you this morning. So good to
[20:03] be in the house of the Lord, isn't it?
[20:05] Amen.
[20:07] Well, considered a real privilege to be
[20:11] here this morning and I told Brother
[20:13] Chad just as soon have him stand here,
[20:17] but he wouldn't take any suggestions and
[20:21] he wouldn't do it. So,
[20:24] and I'm not just being facitious, but I
[20:27] I really uh I've struggled even though
[20:30] the Lord gave me something a few days
[20:31] ago when he called. I You know how it
[20:34] is. you don't feel you're worthy at all.
[20:37] So,
[20:38] I'm going to have you take your seat
[20:40] just for a moment. I want to read
[20:43] something
[20:46] something I wrote down quite a while
[20:49] ago. And I want you to listen to the
[20:52] words.
[20:56] You'll never know
[20:58] the mind of God
[21:01] until we learn to know the voice of God.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; Because out of the abundance of the
[21:10] heart,
[21:11] the mouth speaketh.
[21:13] It doesn't come from here.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; It comes from here.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; You don't think, you think from your
[21:19] heart. The true believer thinks from his
[21:21] heart.
[21:22] When you were saved,
[21:25] you were saved the moment you believed.
[21:29] And you will be healed the moment you
[21:32] believe.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; There's no questioning whether you know
[21:37] whether you're saved or not because you
[21:39] were saved by faith
[21:41] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; God's gift came and proved it to you
[21:45] that you are saved by the word of God,
[21:49] by the power of God. So your healing
[21:51] comes the same way. You have to believe.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; May it be a revelation this morning. The
[21:57] word of God that's been brought in our
[21:59] day. May it be quickened to your soul.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Are you saved this morning?
[22:03] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Are you saved?
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Then God quickened something in your
[22:08] soul. Cuz it's not here that you're
[22:10] saved. It's here that you're saved.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; You're a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[22:16] Now in casting out sickness which is
[22:19] demons we know we have to be careful
[22:23] about who gives the command.
[22:27] Man may say come out of that person but
[22:32] unless his command is by the spirit of
[22:36] God his words are useless.
[22:40] Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Man can say, "Well, come out." But
[22:44] unless the Holy Ghost is doing it, the
[22:46] words are useless.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to have some thoughts this
[22:49] morning that might just shake you up a
[22:51] little bit. But sometimes we need that,
[22:52] don't we?
[22:53] &gt;&gt; How many believe that we need a revival
[22:55] in our own selves?
[22:57] &gt;&gt; We need to be revived in the spirit. I
[22:59] know when you were filled with the
[23:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it was
[23:01] wonderful. But how about this morning?
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Where do you stand this morning with the
[23:05] Holy Ghost? I trust with all my heart
[23:09] that you have settled the question in
[23:11] your heart. And if there's anyone here
[23:13] this morning, I want to just say, God
[23:15] bless you. Listen to the word. Not
[23:16] brother Jim. Listen to the word. And may
[23:19] it be a blessing. Not only that, but a
[23:22] transforming power that you'll never
[23:24] ever walk out of here again not knowing
[23:26] what you have. You have the Holy Ghost
[23:28] in. That is a gift.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; The the Holy Ghost is a gift.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's one more thing I want to
[23:37] say. Never compare this book. This is
[23:41] the Bible right here with other books.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible is from heaven.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; It does not contain the word of God. It
[23:51] is the word of God.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; That is God's word in form,
[23:56] &gt;&gt; written form. So if you want something
[23:57] from God, it's right here.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please stand. We'll go to the
[24:03] scripture.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd like to speak on
[24:10] spiritual ignition.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Spiritual ignition.
[24:15] I told brother Shad when I only need
[24:18] five or 10 minutes anyway. But you know
[24:20] when when he calls and I I went in and
[24:24] tried to comb the few hairs I have left.
[24:26] And I was standing there and I'm looking
[24:28] at that and all of a sudden the word
[24:29] came to me. ignite. And I said, "Lord,
[24:32] I'm ignited every time I hear the
[24:34] prophet or every time I hear in church.
[24:36] There's an ignition that happens.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; But it isn't the kind that starts a
[24:40] fire. It is a fire in my soul." But it's
[24:43] the spiritual ignition. And I believe
[24:44] this morning, we need to receive a
[24:47] little bit of spiritual ignition.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; You go camping, you'll never ever start
[24:52] a fire without oxygen, fuel, and spark.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:57] Yeah,
[24:58] &gt;&gt; I could go. Brother Bram said everything
[24:59] in the natural types is spiritual.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; So what we've got is the oxygen is the
[25:04] atmosphere.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; The fuel is the word
[25:08] &gt;&gt; and the spark is the Holy Ghost.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[25:12] &gt;&gt; if we could just catch those three
[25:13] things this morning,
[25:14] &gt;&gt; the spark is the Holy Ghost.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; And if you got the spark of the Holy
[25:18] Ghost in you, let me tell you something.
[25:20] There's going to be a fire started real
[25:22] quick
[25:23] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is the power and
[25:25] the fire. Amen.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you will to
[25:30] Ephesians the 4th chapter. Ephesians 4.
[25:35] So appreciated the message on Wednesday.
[25:38] And uh
[25:40] I know he took some scriptures that I
[25:42] was just thrilled to hear. And we'll
[25:46] never even touch anything that
[25:50] that was said as far as adding to. But I
[25:54] I want to just let you know that
[25:57] the Lord laid this on my heart and and I
[26:00] trust it'll be a blessing to you.
[26:02] Ephesians the 4th chapter I want to
[26:05] begin reading
[26:07] just we know this the scripture but
[26:10] verse 12 for the perfecting
[26:13] of the saints that's you for the work of
[26:17] the ministry for the edifying of the
[26:21] body of Christ till we all come in a
[26:24] unity
[26:26] the unity of the faith
[26:29] &gt;&gt; amen
[26:30] &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God,
[26:34] unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[26:38] the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[26:42] Heavenly Father, we bow before you this
[26:45] morning with grateful hearts and wonder
[26:49] Lord sometimes how you can come on the
[26:53] scene and take just an old sinner boy
[26:55] and people that have gone to terrible
[26:58] places in the past and then they're
[27:01] washed clean by the blood of the lamb
[27:03] and they stand here as trophies of your
[27:06] grace. We don't have anything in
[27:08] ourselves, Lord, but we depend totally
[27:10] on your spirit. Will you come and take
[27:14] all of our thoughts, lay them aside,
[27:16] Lord, and speak to the soul. That's the
[27:19] real person. It's not the body. It is
[27:22] the soul. That's the temple of the Holy
[27:24] Ghost. Would you speak to it? We pray
[27:26] this morning. We want to give you all
[27:28] the praise and glory in Jesus' name.
[27:31] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[27:42] We'll never attain to perfection. So
[27:44] it's not our perfection that scriptur is
[27:46] talking about.
[27:48] When brother Brandon preached
[27:51] perfect faith,
[27:54] it's always him in you that is perfect.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; So if you're looking to be perfect, it's
[28:00] not going to happen. We fail every day.
[28:02] He never fails. Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; So perfect is actually perfect faith is
[28:07] a revelation.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; And as long as it's out there in the
[28:13] &gt;&gt; whatever ether or whatever and just
[28:15] words or intellectual conception of it
[28:18] isn't going to change anything in here.
[28:20] But the true perfect faith of the Holy
[28:22] Ghost equips you and ignites you with
[28:26] the fire of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And I want to read something here that
[28:31] remember brother Brandham talked about
[28:33] have the faith of God.
[28:36] Well, faith is a gift. We know that,
[28:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Galatians tells us, "For by grace are we
[28:42] saved through faith and that not of
[28:45] yourselves. It is the gift of God." So,
[28:48] we establish right away this morning,
[28:52] faith is a gift. And if a father ever
[28:55] feels the need to
[28:58] give a gift to one of his children, he's
[29:01] not going to just take an old cruddy
[29:03] looking
[29:05] rope or a stained garment or whatever.
[29:09] He wants to give his child the absolute
[29:11] best, whatever it comes in, whatever
[29:13] form. And because it's a gift, it
[29:17] actually represents his very character.
[29:19] So when God gives a gift of faith, it's
[29:22] his character. Actually, it's actually
[29:24] God himself in that gift that he's
[29:26] giving you.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; So it isn't just a gift. I remember when
[29:31] I was a boy, I my father died when I was
[29:34] three years old. So mom married and I
[29:36] had a stepfather that um I loved him,
[29:40] but one son, one Christmas time, uh you
[29:44] know how little boys get so excited
[29:46] about Christmas? At least this little
[29:48] boy did. still a little boy. I guess
[29:50] that's why I love the young people so
[29:51] much. And thank you brothers for helping
[29:53] the move yesterday. That was precious.
[29:56] Precious. And so I'm there close to the
[30:00] little Christmas tree. This is way back
[30:02] I think in about 1946
[30:04] 47.
[30:06] Didn't know anything about a prophet.
[30:07] All I knew is Christmas was coming and
[30:09] it was the birth place and time of our
[30:12] savior. having being taught in a oneness
[30:14] Pentecostal church that was pretty
[30:17] important to a little boy and the only
[30:19] reason I learned all I did in the
[30:20] scriptures because the pastor's wife
[30:23] made sure that she gave us a gift if we
[30:26] learned the biatitudes the 66 books of
[30:29] the Bible and all these other things. So
[30:30] as a little tight I did everything I
[30:33] could to learn it because the gift was a
[30:35] little bronze horse.
[30:39] Now, I don't know, maybe mom told her,
[30:41] but that horse meant more to me than
[30:43] anything in my life. And so, and of
[30:47] course, when I got older, I had a horse,
[30:49] several horses, and I loved the horses.
[30:51] But while I was at the the uh room there
[30:54] at the house, and we were sitting there,
[30:56] and the gifts were given out, I noticed
[30:58] this big box,
[31:01] and mom kept saying, "You never know
[31:03] what's there." And I said, "Well, who's
[31:04] it from?" "It looks like it's from
[31:06] daddy." and I couldn't even hardly open
[31:08] the other presents. So, I started
[31:11] peeling it off. And what it was after I
[31:14] spent 15 to 20 minutes unwrapping it all
[31:17] and got to the last little parcel there,
[31:20] it was an old beat up handsaw from a
[31:24] barn that he thought he would just wrap
[31:26] up and fool me. You know, that that
[31:29] wasn't a gift. And I it hurt my little
[31:32] soul so much that I thought, why would a
[31:35] man do that? and my mom dropped her
[31:36] head. That's not the gift of a father.
[31:39] The gift of the father is expressing his
[31:41] love.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; My heavenly father doesn't give me
[31:45] anything but joy, peace, longsuffering,
[31:47] gentleness, meekness.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; That's my heavenly father.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; So when we talk about gifts of the Holy
[31:53] Ghost, which I want to talk a little bit
[31:55] about today, the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[31:57] are perfect for you. You may not even
[31:59] realize how perfect they are, but
[32:01] they're there for the believer.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Let me have you turn to
[32:05] Uh let's see here. We'll start in
[32:10] sorry
[32:13] what did you know brother Chad I was
[32:16] talking this in the back room there. You
[32:20] know brother Bram talked about the nine
[32:22] gifts of the Holy Ghost. Remember that
[32:25] it's in 1 Corinthians 12. Let's turn
[32:27] there a moment. 1 Corinthians 12.
[32:37] 1 Corinthians 12 and we'll begin reading
[32:40] at verse 4.
[32:44] Now there are diversities of gifts but
[32:48] the same spirit. There are differences
[32:50] of administration but the same Lord and
[32:54] there are diversities of operations but
[32:56] is the same God which workketh all in
[32:59] all. But the manifestation of the spirit
[33:02] is given to every man to profit with
[33:05] all. For to one is given by the spirit
[33:08] the word of wisdom, to another the word
[33:11] of knowledge, by the same spirit, to
[33:14] another faith by the same spirit, to
[33:16] another the gifts of healing. by the
[33:18] same Spirit, to another the working of
[33:20] miracles, to another prophecy, to
[33:23] another discerning of spirits, to
[33:25] another diverse kinds of tongues, to
[33:28] another the interpretation of tongues.
[33:30] But all these workketh at one, and the
[33:34] selfsame spirit, dividing to every man
[33:38] severally as he will. So here we are.
[33:42] We're claiming to be the bride of
[33:44] Christ. Do you believe those gifts ought
[33:46] to be in operation? Yes, sir.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask it again. You believe
[33:50] those gifts should be in operation?
[33:53] &gt;&gt; It may not be evident every time you
[33:54] come to church or whether you're living
[33:56] wherever you live, but they should be in
[33:58] operation.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, because we are spiritual
[34:04] beings and because the gift of the Holy
[34:06] Ghost is given, we can just say, well,
[34:09] we didn't deserve it, but his love
[34:12] brought himself to us. So now the
[34:14] prophet told us he in us and we are in
[34:18] him. So it's all the same spirit now.
[34:20] It's not another spirit. It's God in us
[34:23] performing the work. So when he sends
[34:25] faith, it's actually him coming in and
[34:27] performing and operating that gift of
[34:29] faith in our bodies.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; So it's not something you have to just
[34:33] wish for or hope for or whatever. It's
[34:35] actually reality. It's God the Father
[34:37] coming into his son and manifesting his
[34:40] life there. Amen.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; So, if we could just catch some of the
[34:43] things that I'm going to read from the
[34:45] prophet this morning and realize there's
[34:47] nothing in the world you can do. And
[34:49] when I say you believe, do you know you
[34:51] wouldn't even have the power and ability
[34:53] to believe if God didn't give you that?
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, folks, listen. When Abraham
[35:00] staggered not at the promise of God
[35:02] through unbelief, why did he not
[35:03] stagger? Because God gave him the
[35:05] ability before the foundation of the
[35:07] world to believe his word. Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; And it takes faith to believe the word.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Because Hebrews says without faith, it's
[35:14] what? Impossible to please God. You know
[35:17] why? Cuz faith is God.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; It's not just a gift that he gives you.
[35:21] It's actually God himself coming to you.
[35:23] That's why you ought to just Oh, I said,
[35:25] Brother Chad, we ought to just jump out
[35:26] of our seats once in a while and say,
[35:27] "Praise God. Something's going on in my
[35:30] soul." You know what it is? The fire of
[35:32] the real Pentecost.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jim, don't talk about
[35:35] Pentecost. I'm sorry. Back in the 40s
[35:37] and 50s, I saw the real Pentecost. And
[35:39] it wasn't a denomination. It was a life.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; And you don't leave the life because it
[35:45] was God himself in us.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know there's manifestations that
[35:49] aren't of the spirit, but I'm talking
[35:51] the real igniter, the real fire of the
[35:54] Holy Ghost.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; We go to Acts, if you would, please. You
[35:58] know what I'm going to read? Yes. Acts
[36:02] two,
[36:05] I just thank the Lord for his word.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; And verse one, and when the day of
[36:12] Pentecost was fully come, they were all
[36:15] with one accord.
[36:17] Oh, do you realize this morning
[36:21] that if every one of you were in accord
[36:23] with one another, Brother Brandham said,
[36:25] "You're getting close to a rapture
[36:26] then."
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something in the power of
[36:30] the living Christ that if we could get
[36:32] in unity of the spirit, brother Chad
[36:35] couldn't even preach here.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; There'd be such an overwhelming presence
[36:39] of the of the eternal God. Don't you
[36:41] remember? I remember when the breath of
[36:43] the Holy Ghost would come over a
[36:45] congregation half this side and it was
[36:47] so strong you couldn't hardly do
[36:49] anything but stand up and cry and
[36:51] worship the Lord. Where is that this
[36:53] morning, folks? We don't have it
[36:55] anymore. Brother Jim's
[36:58] elderly, but so was Moses. How in the
[37:02] world, Brother Bram said, could anybody
[37:03] expect an 80-year-old man to lead the
[37:06] children of Israel out of bondage? It
[37:08] didn't matter what men thought cuz that
[37:10] was the intellect. But God through the
[37:12] soul of brother I'm going to call him
[37:14] brother Moses. I'm going to meet him
[37:16] someday. He actually came on the scene
[37:18] because God predestinated him. And
[37:21] you're the same way. You're
[37:22] predestinated if you got the Holy Ghost
[37:24] in you to be here this morning. And God
[37:27] will honor your commitment to himself.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; It's not you being a Christian. It's him
[37:33] being a Christian in you.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; You're going to fail miserably. Oh, but
[37:38] he comes along and and lifts you up like
[37:40] he does
[37:42] &gt;&gt; every day.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; I've got to slow down here.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Anyway, so and suddenly there came a
[37:48] sound from heaven. Verse two, as a
[37:51] rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
[37:53] the house that they were sitting. You
[37:55] mean to tell me people in the upper room
[37:57] there felt something? Yes, sir. Was it
[38:00] an emotion? Probably. Was it real? Yes,
[38:02] sir. It was a rushing mighty wind. Why?
[38:04] It carried the breath of God, the very
[38:06] breath of God. Cuz the Bible says he
[38:09] breathed on them earlier and said,
[38:10] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." So, they
[38:12] were there in the perfect timing for God
[38:15] to breathe on them.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; There wasn't a preacher breathing on
[38:19] them. There was no preacher there.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; So, they're believers. Preachers don't
[38:23] mean anything. Don't look at me as a
[38:25] preacher. I'm not a preacher. I'm just a
[38:27] brother. But I'm going to tell you one
[38:28] thing. God has given the gifts of the
[38:30] church for one reason. To equip you. Not
[38:32] me, but equip you
[38:35] &gt;&gt; to understanding the word.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Jim, you're excited."
[38:38] Oh, I haven't even started yet.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; I just been I I I guess I gave this
[38:43] example. I don't know who I preached to,
[38:45] so I'll give it again. When I had my
[38:48] quarter horse uh part thoroughbred and I
[38:51] got him in the gate to go rope a cow,
[38:55] that horse was so smart. He knew that
[38:57] that little barrier ring or string in
[39:01] front. If that was broken before before
[39:05] the gun went off, you you ru ruined the
[39:08] run. You couldn't you couldn't even
[39:10] score. So I'd get by the way his name
[39:13] was Johnny come lately.
[39:17] Look some of us are Johnny come lately
[39:19] aren't we?
[39:20] &gt;&gt; We came in the last hour. Do you get the
[39:22] same price? You got the same ones prices
[39:24] as I got
[39:26] &gt;&gt; 70 or 60 years ago. No, it's more than
[39:28] that. It's 70 years ago. So I'd get in
[39:31] the box with that horse and I knew when
[39:33] he jumped out he'd just about lead me
[39:35] back in the back of the box here.
[39:38] So when I nudged him and he leaped out,
[39:43] he wasn't Johnny come lately anymore.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; And I tore after because they they call
[39:47] it I don't know how many cowboys you got
[39:49] here, but when you when you talk about
[39:51] cow sense, that means that they have
[39:53] something in their nature that's bred in
[39:56] them to want to grab a cow because they
[39:59] want to round those cattle up. The
[40:00] cowboy runs around trying to get them
[40:02] into the corral. And so of course my
[40:06] horse had a cow in them.
[40:08] He'd run right up to the cow and bite
[40:10] him. He wanted me to throw a larette,
[40:13] make sure. And I'm just thinking, Lord,
[40:16] when you caught us, we didn't catch you.
[40:18] When you caught us, we might have been
[40:20] late, but let me tell you something. He
[40:21] threw the word, the last shoe of the
[40:23] word around every one of you and brought
[40:24] you into a service, not just to have an
[40:27] entertaining time, but to react to what
[40:30] the word is preached. Because faith
[40:32] comes by hearing.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; You can't even get faith without
[40:35] hearing. Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you don't have
[40:39] faith, you won't go into rapture."
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[40:43] you won't. That's why he preached
[40:44] perfect faith. Got to have perfect faith
[40:46] because it's his faith.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; So, aren't you glad that you don't have
[40:49] to manufacture it?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have anything to do with
[40:52] faith. Only believe it.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; He set that gift there. All All he has
[40:58] to do is will you believe my word.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Will you believe me? Oh yes, Lord. Okay.
[41:06] Well, I'm going to let you go for about
[41:08] 25 years or so. Every day, Brother Bam
[41:11] said his faith, God's faith in him got
[41:15] stronger.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; But look, you're getting pretty old.
[41:18] Yeah, but you know, Sarah, how about it?
[41:21] Oh, not yet, Abraham. Not yet. Well, get
[41:24] get the needle point and all these
[41:25] little things ready because you're
[41:26] fixing to have because the Bible said by
[41:28] faith Sarah.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Don't lay it all on Abraham. The bride's
[41:31] got to have the same thing. Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; So when it was time and the little Isaac
[41:38] was born, the first, you know, God, we
[41:42] don't understand God's dealings, but he
[41:44] he had one thing in mind. Destroy Isaac,
[41:47] the promised son.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he he actually told
[41:52] Abraham, "Abraham, I love you. You've
[41:54] followed my word. You believe what I've
[41:56] said. Now I'm going to have you destroy
[41:57] your son." Oh, that's no problem. You
[42:00] know why? Faith was talking. Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; There wasn't any desire in him to say,
[42:05] you know, Lord, I thought it over. I
[42:06] just can't serve you anymore. You're
[42:08] going to take my my son.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; The son was a result of faith.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; So even if he would have stabbed him, he
[42:17] would have come back to life.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; So no matter Oh, I love these young
[42:21] people. No matter what, young people
[42:23] what you go through and it looks like
[42:25] it's hopeless because nobody understands
[42:27] me. The things you go through as young
[42:28] people, you think I'm too old. Oh, no. I
[42:31] know exactly what you're going through.
[42:32] We've all been through it. But hold
[42:34] steady because if faith ever strikes
[42:36] your little soul, you it won't matter
[42:38] what you have to think or go through
[42:40] with your siblings or people in the
[42:43] world, whatever. God's got his hand on
[42:45] you. Just reach out and say, "Lord, I
[42:47] need direction today."
[42:49] &gt;&gt; It isn't just that we
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; We we we know we're going to all fail.
[42:54] There's nothing else but just to
[42:56] recognize it. But he doesn't let the
[42:58] spiritual part of the man, brother Brad
[43:00] said, there's two men living in us.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Like brother Chad said about the white
[43:05] and the black dog,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; the black one doesn't want you to have
[43:08] faith.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not even getting my notes. The
[43:11] black one doesn't want you to have
[43:13] faith. It's the white one that does.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; And that's not a a racial statement, but
[43:17] there's something that the Indian said,
[43:20] "Which dog do you feed?" If you feed the
[43:22] wrong dog, you'll never arise in faith
[43:25] in your soul to believe God for
[43:27] anything. Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't understand why you're
[43:29] drawn to the message and you love to
[43:31] hear the prophets, you don't know what's
[43:33] going on, but God does. And he's trying
[43:35] to equip you with healing and whatever
[43:38] deliverance you need because you are
[43:40] absolutely bound by God to believe his
[43:43] word. And faith cometh by hearing it.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, help us.
[43:51] Now, we know I've got to slow down here.
[43:54] You know, Lo Luther said, "The just
[43:55] shall live by faith." Look at that
[43:57] statement there. The just, you're just
[44:00] if you've been justified by grace.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; The just can come and once in a while
[44:06] they can say, you know, God really
[44:08] helped me on this journey or whatever
[44:10] happened. Uh yeah, I guess I guess guess
[44:14] I am just because I've been justified.
[44:16] But the Bible said he was justified by
[44:19] faith.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; You're not justified by intellect.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; You're justified by faith.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; And when you're justified by faith, that
[44:26] means you are okay.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; There's no problem there.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're not doing it yourself.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Faith is a gift of God. It's his very
[44:35] nature coming and living in you.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; I know I've said it, but I'm going to
[44:39] reiterate it.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[44:42] And Paul said in 1 Thessalonians, "For
[44:45] our gospel
[44:47] came not unto you in word only."
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; But also in power and in the Holy Ghost.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; So that tells me you can have all the
[44:59] word.
[45:01] And I don't want you to misunderstand
[45:02] what I'm saying. You ought to know by
[45:04] now I love the word. I can't live
[45:06] without the word. The word word is my
[45:08] life. But you can have word upon word
[45:10] upon word by and it won't do a thing if
[45:14] the Holy Ghost doesn't quicken it in
[45:15] your soul.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; The devils believe the word.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And they tremble. Are they going to go
[45:23] in a rapture? Are they saved? No,
[45:24] they're not. So that means just to say,
[45:27] "I've heard the word. I heard the word."
[45:29] Listen, folks, you got to get to a place
[45:31] where the Holy Ghost could quicken it to
[45:33] you.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why brother
[45:36] Brandham indicated in his message, don't
[45:38] just copy what I'm saying. Just don't
[45:40] quote what I'm saying. I've got all
[45:41] kinds of quotes here. That isn't what
[45:44] you need. You need the inspiration of
[45:45] the Holy Ghost to take the words of the
[45:47] prophet and speak into your own word and
[45:49] say, "That's for me."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; I want to just give you a little story.
[45:54] when Paul was shipwrecked,
[45:57] when he was shipwrecked and they was
[45:59] throwing everything out because they're
[46:01] running a ground in Malta and he didn't
[46:03] have he didn't know what to do. But you
[46:07] see, because he was God's vessel,
[46:11] &gt;&gt; an angel appeared to him.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; An angel is a messenger from God. We've
[46:18] had a seventh church age messenger
[46:20] angel. That's what we've had today. How
[46:22] many believe that? Amen.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; All right. So the angel said, "You know
[46:26] what, Paul? Don't you worry.
[46:30] You're promised to stand before Caesar."
[46:34] &gt;&gt; So
[46:35] now that's good. But until you have the
[46:37] confirmation in your soul,
[46:41] the intellects could say, "Well, that's
[46:43] just a a figment of your imagination or
[46:45] that's just a dream you had or
[46:47] something." No, it was a vision. It
[46:49] actually happened.
[46:51] So here he is knowing I've got the
[46:55] quotes here. Knowing
[46:57] that he can't die in a shipwreck.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, if you knew beyond a shadow
[47:02] of a doubt that you've got to re res
[47:04] respond to the word and you know
[47:06] whatever you're in, whatever situation
[47:08] you're in, brother John is he's there to
[47:10] deliver you.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; But brother Jim, that was a shipwreck.
[47:13] It's going down. It doesn't matter.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; You got to stay with the word. Stay with
[47:19] the ship. Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; So he got excited. That's what the Holy
[47:23] Ghost does. Gets excited. He goes up on
[47:26] top. Brother Bram said, and he looked
[47:28] and he said, and he screamed out,
[47:30] "Brethren, don't worry. We're going to
[47:33] be saved." Oh, it's easy for you to say,
[47:35] Paul. No, he had the revelation from the
[47:37] from the angel. He knew beyond a
[47:39] shuttered doubt. If he was here today,
[47:41] he'd be out of his seat saying, "That's
[47:43] me. That's me, Brother Jim." You know
[47:45] why? because the angel told him he'd be
[47:48] saved and he believed the word.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; And so what's he do? He gets up and
[47:54] starts screaming. Brother Bram said he
[47:56] screamed at the top of his lung and
[47:58] said, "I know what's going to happen.
[48:00] We're not going to perish. Not one hair
[48:02] in your head head is going to perish."
[48:05] &gt;&gt; So you you know what he did? There's a
[48:08] peace and there's a confidence. He goes
[48:10] down to the galley and makes himself a
[48:12] sandwich.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; That's a quote from brother Brandon.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he come up eating the
[48:16] sandwich. That's why I like sandwiches,
[48:18] especially homemade bread with good
[48:20] whatever inside.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say so much here. Man
[48:24] shall not live by bread alone.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; But every word that proceedth out of the
[48:31] mouth of God.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; There's your inside the sandwich because
[48:34] you got to have the bread of life. But
[48:36] you got to have substance inside that
[48:38] bread. Just like Elijah there, he had
[48:41] &gt;&gt; ravens send him meat and bread. morning
[48:44] and night,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; didn't he?
[48:47] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bam said, "So, I like
[48:49] sandwiches, too." I'm not trying to make
[48:51] light light light of it. I'm just saying
[48:52] there there's so much Sure, there's
[48:54] humor in the gospel.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; There it's a relaxing, beautiful,
[48:59] beautiful display of God's love.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Without love,
[49:04] you're going to perish.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you come to
[49:06] church. I don't care how sweet you are.
[49:08] You got to have love one for another.
[49:10] Even loving your enemies. Now, we got to
[49:12] go to that because what brother Chad
[49:14] said about the Oh, dear. I've been
[49:18] bottled up for too long. The what
[49:20] brother Chad said about the It's in the
[49:23] 23rd, I'll just try to do it by heart.
[49:25] 23rd chapter of the book of Luke. The
[49:28] Bible said in I believe it was Isaiah
[49:30] 53, there was malfactors. Those are the
[49:34] bad the thieves that were crucified next
[49:36] to him.
[49:38] Did that excite you when all of a sudden
[49:40] one of them stopped cold right there
[49:43] &gt;&gt; hanging on the cross?
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Here's my question. What was his
[49:47] background? How did he get into
[49:49] thievery? What did he do that this that
[49:52] would support a crucifixion? Why was he
[49:55] why was he crucified? Because they had a
[49:57] law. But the grace was
[50:01] hanging on a cross right next to him.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; There's your grace. and he's watching.
[50:07] One of them said, "If you were the
[50:09] Christ, come off the cross." But this
[50:11] one
[50:12] &gt;&gt; within an instant he was converted
[50:15] because he said when he heard the master
[50:19] say, "Father, forgive them." That was a
[50:22] message of grace. And every one of us
[50:24] have experienced the same thing. Forgive
[50:26] them for they know not what they do. And
[50:29] when he heard those words, that's the
[50:30] only preaching that we know he heard.
[50:32] Father, forgive them. And forgiveness is
[50:34] based, faith is based on forgiveness.
[50:37] And God dropped the faith down in that
[50:39] man right there. And he said, "Will you
[50:41] remember me?" And Jesus knew cuz he was
[50:44] predestinated. Didn't matter how many
[50:46] things he stole. Doesn't matter. He was
[50:47] hanging on the cross. If he could have,
[50:49] he'd have gotten off the cross and bowed
[50:51] his knees before the son of God.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it. So it's not
[50:55] works, brother Chad. It's not works that
[50:57] we do. It's just a believing by faith.
[51:00] And he went to paradise that day because
[51:04] he believed what God had said, "Father,
[51:07] forgive them." One little thing,
[51:08] forgiveness, change his whole future.
[51:11] Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; So
[51:23] when the son of man cometh,
[51:26] when the son of man cometh, will he find
[51:29] faith on the earth?
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Actually, if you go back and read the
[51:35] the original,
[51:37] he's the one that brought faith.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] Will he find faith? I got a question for
[51:44] you. Look at the scriptures about the
[51:48] centurion.
[51:50] Jesus after he said, "Just send the
[51:52] word." Oh, what a what a deep thought.
[51:55] Just send the word, Lord, and my servant
[51:57] will be healed.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And once was Jesus, I've not found.
[52:01] Here's your fine faith, and here's your
[52:03] found faith.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; I have not found so great a faith in all
[52:08] of Israel. That's a big statement. And
[52:10] it wasn't a Jew, it was a Gentile.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Don't you see why you're such a p
[52:15] privileged and blessed people is because
[52:16] God brought his word to you.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; When everything else failed and the Jews
[52:21] couldn't receive it, you received it.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[52:27] The giver of faith. What a time we are.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about what you
[52:34] know, I've got so many quotes here, but
[52:35] brother Brandham said something that
[52:37] struck me. He said, "Sight, si ght, and
[52:42] time
[52:44] are
[52:45] God's worst enemy."
[52:49] &gt;&gt; And I I'm thinking, "Oh my
[52:52] &gt;&gt; sight and
[52:54] &gt;&gt; time."
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Have you got time this morning for the
[52:58] word?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing, Brother Jim, or are you
[53:02] seeing Christ coming in in another realm
[53:04] and blessing you? It's not me that can
[53:06] bless you. All I can do is give you the
[53:08] word. You have to decide for yourself
[53:10] whether or not the spirit that you got
[53:12] in you is receiving the word.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; You don't worship Brother Chad.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; No. No. No man is worthy of worship.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; You acknowledge that there's a gift
[53:22] there.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; But that's all you do is acknowledge it.
[53:25] You don't lift him up.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; At least you shouldn't.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it because
[53:35] anyway
[53:38] I'm I'm trying to get into my message
[53:40] this morning.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Now,
[53:45] we just read about the necessities or
[53:47] diversities, I'm sorry, of gifts, the
[53:50] nine spiritual gifts.
[53:53] Um,
[53:55] first of all, faith
[53:58] exists in an unseen realm.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; So, now we need to go to Hebrews.
[54:04] you don't mind me going back and forth
[54:05] because I've got I haven't quot started
[54:07] the quotes yet, but we'll get to them.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to Good thing I can't
[54:12] see the clock and I I don't pay
[54:14] attention to this one here at all.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I really just started.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; I haven't even started yet.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Can I say I love you all?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand when I said that's
[54:27] from the soul?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; God bless you. What a what a fine church
[54:32] with fine people. Oh my.
[54:36] Now,
[54:38] let's go to
[54:43] Hebrews the 11th chapter reads,
[54:47] "Faith, remember that's a gift.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Faith is from God.
[54:54] Faith
[54:56] is the substance,
[54:59] the real thing.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; When we moved here, Brother Chad said,
[55:04] "I want to see reality.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; So do I.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want any pretense. I want
[55:11] reality." And if you don't have the
[55:12] reality of the Holy Ghost in you,
[55:14] there's an altar here. Or you can sit in
[55:15] your seat and get it. But you got to
[55:17] have reality.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, but be careful, Brother Jim. You
[55:20] know that could be emotion. Well, it's
[55:21] all right because I'm sure on the day of
[55:23] Pentecost there was emotion running.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Just to hear a rushing mighty wind and
[55:28] cloven tongues of fire on them sure
[55:30] changed their lives, didn't it?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Not only changed it, but it gave them
[55:34] the ability to come and pray and not
[55:36] even pray for that man at the gate, but
[55:38] just lay hands on him and he was healed.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So, there's something in faith. Faith is
[55:44] a substance. It's more real. probably
[55:48] said this before. It's more real than
[55:49] the carpet on the floor or this pulpit.
[55:51] It's more real than that, folks. Listen
[55:53] to me. Faith is beyond anything in the
[55:56] natural because it's a it's a spiritual
[55:59] thing.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. You can't worship with
[56:02] your mind. You got to worship with your
[56:04] soul.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; God is only worshiped by the quickening
[56:08] power of an individual that's got the
[56:10] faith in them. That's how he worships.
[56:12] You worship him because without faith,
[56:14] it's impossible to please him. And you
[56:15] surely want to please God. He's a
[56:17] creator. He put you on this earth.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. There isn't anything
[56:22] that could ever strike a a believer. But
[56:25] what there is an answer for it and
[56:27] deliverance for it.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So the scripture that says
[56:33] faith is a substance of things hoped
[56:36] for. This is an interesting scripture
[56:38] because all of us are expectating
[56:43] expecting something or ex we we when a
[56:46] woman is getting ready to to have a
[56:49] child we call her expecting.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You know why we call it expecting?
[56:55] Something's coming down the road.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Something's going to happen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; When she wasn't expecting, she wasn't
[57:01] expecting
[57:03] &gt;&gt; naturally speaking. But we got to get in
[57:05] the place where we're expecting every
[57:08] single day. The prophet said in 1954, he
[57:11] said the Lord could come at any time.
[57:14] But the problem is we're not unified
[57:16] yet. That's right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And of course, he's dealing with the
[57:18] Pentecostals in the whatever. And be
[57:21] because I was raised in the pen UPC
[57:23] Pentecostal, I know there was no unity
[57:26] there. So, let me just finish this
[57:29] things hoped for. So, it's not that hope
[57:33] takes the place of reality. It's just
[57:35] that every individual is hoping that
[57:38] they can get closer to God. And by
[57:40] hoping, it isn't throwing out faith.
[57:43] It's in the excitement that you're
[57:44] hoping for something new.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; When you get down on your knees and you
[57:48] and you read your scriptures and have
[57:50] devotion, there ought to be an
[57:51] expectation. Lord, what are you going to
[57:53] do with my life today? Well, I just got
[57:55] to go to work. Don't look at it that
[57:57] way.
[57:58] We I might as well tell you we had
[58:03] some carpet layers come to Far and
[58:05] Derek's house. They had to replace the
[58:07] carpet because of the odor. And when
[58:10] he's working there, strange name, his
[58:14] last name Eden. Ed Dens. Eden's first
[58:17] name is David. It's all right if I
[58:19] mention his name. So he was standing in
[58:22] the kitchen there and I was talking to
[58:24] him. Don't say anything
[58:27] spiritual, just talking.
[58:29] But you see, if faith is operating in
[58:32] you, you're different.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Not everybody could see that.
[58:37] So I said to David, I said, "What are
[58:39] you reading?" "Oh." And he took his
[58:41] phone. He said this. I said, "That's
[58:45] Bible scriptures.
[58:47] I'm talking about big here things, you
[58:50] know, tattoos all over and everything.
[58:52] And I'm going to declare it if he ever
[58:54] hears this. Brother David, I love you.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; God allowed that man to come in my life.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Probably nobody else saw it, but I did.
[59:05] Now he textes me every day with
[59:07] scripture.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; And I don't even know if he's a
[59:10] Christian. I don't know if he goes to
[59:12] church. What difference does that make?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; If God's doing the pullings through a
[59:16] vessel, that's all we ought to worry
[59:17] about. Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; So, you don't know who or when something
[59:21] will happen because of the presence of
[59:22] almighty God. The Holy Ghost is behind
[59:25] everything you do.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Jim, not me.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; I just go to work. I just clean the
[59:31] house. Whatever.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; But you can pray.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; You can pray for your pastor, for the
[59:37] deacons and trustees. Pray for them.
[59:40] That's what God wants you to do. So,
[59:42] it's an expectation every time we come
[59:44] to church. When we walk through those
[59:45] doors, we ought to be so excited that
[59:47] when Brother Chad says something or any
[59:49] minister says something, we say, "That
[59:51] ain't nothing but the truth." Then God
[59:52] verifies that and vindicated in your
[59:55] life because you said it by revelation.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm not a name caller, but I see
[1:00:02] some of my friends out there that if you
[1:00:05] if you really knew what God showed me
[1:00:07] about you, you'd say, "Oh, you're
[1:00:10] getting kind of sappy, Brother Jim." I
[1:00:11] don't I I can't help it. You're just
[1:00:14] precious, precious, precious to me. I've
[1:00:16] said it before. I've never My family's
[1:00:17] never been treated like we have here.
[1:00:19] Never.
[1:00:21] Lost my whole family, every member of my
[1:00:23] family in a cult claiming to be the
[1:00:25] message of the hour. And I come here,
[1:00:28] nobody claims anything. You know, when
[1:00:30] we say, "Well, you're all the bride of
[1:00:32] Christ." That's not even accurate
[1:00:33] because there's three kinds of believers
[1:00:35] in every church.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And the pastor's trying to get through
[1:00:38] the message to the believer. And even if
[1:00:41] the unbeliever doesn't see it, you don't
[1:00:43] know. Everybody's worth something.
[1:00:45] Pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters,
[1:00:46] they're all worth something.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And because we don't know what their
[1:00:49] future is, we treat them all like
[1:00:51] believers.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We should.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, help us Lord.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So faith is the six sense.
[1:01:06] So
[1:01:08] faith
[1:01:11] is the substance
[1:01:14] of things expecting,
[1:01:18] hoped for.
[1:01:20] Now when it comes to pass,
[1:01:23] it's not hoped for anymore. That's
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; The word is the word until it
[1:01:28] accomplishes its duty.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And then you leave and go to another
[1:01:33] realm.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're going to be raptured
[1:01:35] because of faith, not because you come
[1:01:37] to church, not because you think
[1:01:38] everything's right and hunky dory with
[1:01:40] your family or friends or whatever.
[1:01:41] You're going to only go into rapture if
[1:01:43] there's faith in here.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet preached the
[1:01:47] heart on divine healing because it isn't
[1:01:50] you that gets healed by your own
[1:01:53] intellect. It's the word of God that
[1:01:55] comes to the throne on behalf of you and
[1:01:59] you hear the word. God says, "That's
[1:02:01] good. That's my boy. That's my girl. I'm
[1:02:02] going to send faith." And faith is a
[1:02:04] gift. So he gives you the gift. Not only
[1:02:06] to believe, but to understand the word.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; All the mysteries are cleared up. But to
[1:02:11] some, they're not.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; I happen to know some of the ones that
[1:02:14] go online and say this horrible things.
[1:02:16] I know them personally.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; They're not speaking by faith. There's
[1:02:20] unbelief there.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And they'll never accomplish anything
[1:02:23] for God with that. They're going to put
[1:02:25] themselves in a horrible situation if
[1:02:27] they don't change their way. But I don't
[1:02:29] know.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; You don't know. We can have somebody
[1:02:32] come in our sanctuary in the in the
[1:02:34] assembly here. I don't know what their
[1:02:36] future is.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So if there's somebody here today and
[1:02:39] you don't know what brother Jim is
[1:02:40] saying, I'm saying it isn't up to me.
[1:02:42] It's God. He does the pulling.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I love what brother Paul Offentain
[1:02:46] wrote. I feel the pull.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; It isn't you.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; I think I'll just pull. No, it's the
[1:02:52] Holy Ghost pulling. And you're sitting
[1:02:53] there and you're receiving that pull and
[1:02:55] you say, I can't sit here anymore.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; I've got to jump out of my chair. I've
[1:03:01] got to just let God know that it's not
[1:03:03] for it's not for people to see that
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; it's something inside of you.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, when they got on the day of
[1:03:09] Pentecost, they went out speaking in
[1:03:11] another language. It isn't the tongues
[1:03:13] that didn't prove anything. That was a
[1:03:15] gift that God gave them.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; But it was their life that was changed.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; They went out there and preached and got
[1:03:21] thrown in prison. It doesn't have
[1:03:22] anything to do. It never took it away
[1:03:24] from them. Amen.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Don't you see folks? Without the Holy
[1:03:28] Ghost, we're absolutely
[1:03:31] lost.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I've got to Could you give me a a minute
[1:03:38] here? Got to read some scripture or some
[1:03:40] quotes here.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read what Brother Bram said
[1:03:46] on the restoration of gifts. Let me just
[1:03:48] back up a minute.
[1:03:50] It's not that we have to have
[1:03:53] it in manifold expressions in our church
[1:03:55] the restoration. I'm just wondering what
[1:03:57] has happened. This is my question this
[1:03:59] morning. I'm a nobody but I just wonder
[1:04:02] are we supposed to have the restoration
[1:04:04] of gifts in the church in the body?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; I didn't get much. But how many believe
[1:04:10] that the Bible said and the prophet said
[1:04:12] we need a revival?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He said Jeffersonville needs it.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. they're not receiving it. And
[1:04:20] that's his own church that he preached
[1:04:21] and preached and preached to. What it
[1:04:22] is, it's because they haven't opened
[1:04:24] their heart to receive the baptism, the
[1:04:27] person of Jesus Christ to live through
[1:04:29] them.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; And so when the when the word of the
[1:04:32] prophet is preached, they just think,
[1:04:33] well, as long as I go to a tabernacle,
[1:04:35] as long as I do this and and and and
[1:04:37] make this my home church and whatever,
[1:04:40] that doesn't do it.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; We've got to have the revelation of the
[1:04:43] word.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; God's got to come down and quicken the
[1:04:46] word. That quickened means made alive.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He's going to quicken the dead and
[1:04:51] they're going to rise.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Are they going to rise?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; How are they going to rise? They're
[1:04:56] dead. How did Lazarus rise?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Something said something to his spirit
[1:05:02] that brother B said didn't know how far
[1:05:04] off he was have gone on, but something
[1:05:06] you know what Jesus said in that in that
[1:05:09] discourse? He told his disciples a
[1:05:11] couple days away, he said, um,
[1:05:16] you'll see the glory of God manifest.
[1:05:18] I'm paraphrasing the scripture, didn't
[1:05:20] he? And so when he got there, Lesar's
[1:05:22] already dead. Did I not say to you,
[1:05:24] Martha, you'll see the glory of God. Did
[1:05:26] he say that? That's what he said. So all
[1:05:29] the groaning, hold steady here. All the
[1:05:32] groaning he did, it wasn't because he
[1:05:35] didn't believe Lazarus was going to be
[1:05:36] raised from the dead. He was groaning
[1:05:38] from unbelief. Look in your Bible and
[1:05:41] you'll see when they said, "Oh, he loved
[1:05:43] him. That's why he's crying. Oh no, he
[1:05:46] was torn apart because of unbelief."
[1:05:47] Like he cried in the garden. Lord, if
[1:05:52] Jerusalem would I'd gather him like a
[1:05:54] hen gathers a chicken. But he cried
[1:05:56] because of the unbelief of Jerusalem.
[1:05:58] It's not because he had a failure in his
[1:06:02] psychic that he he couldn't stand
[1:06:04] anymore or whatever. It was because of
[1:06:06] unbelief.
[1:06:08] Just follow the scriptural pattern all
[1:06:09] the way because he said you'll see the
[1:06:11] glory of God. Did he get discouraged and
[1:06:13] said, "Well, I guess they won't see the
[1:06:14] glory of God." No. That's why he came.
[1:06:17] That's why Lizard Lazarus was raised
[1:06:18] from the dead because the groaning in
[1:06:20] his spirit was because of unbelief.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Probably never heard that before, but go
[1:06:25] to the scripture and find out what
[1:06:27] happened when the Lord himself
[1:06:30] came with the disciples and said until
[1:06:34] he said, "Where have you put him?" and
[1:06:36] buried him. He shed and by the way the
[1:06:39] Greek means he shed a tear but it's from
[1:06:42] the unbelief because the pe the the
[1:06:44] Pharisees or the whoever was there said
[1:06:47] oh how he loved him based on his cry now
[1:06:50] I know the Lord cried ain't question
[1:06:52] about that but he didn't cry because he
[1:06:54] was sorrowful or sad how could he do
[1:06:56] that when he was there for one reason to
[1:06:58] bring the glory of God
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; he had to cry because of the unbelief
[1:07:02] you can't have it both ways either he
[1:07:04] knew that he stood on the on the basis
[1:07:08] of what the father showed him because he
[1:07:09] said I'll go wake Lazarus the disciples
[1:07:11] says well it's good that he just sleeps
[1:07:13] oh no there's more there's a lot deeper
[1:07:15] than that so when he groaned in his
[1:07:18] spirit and he does the same through a
[1:07:20] prophet the prophet in our day groaned
[1:07:23] because of the sins of the people what
[1:07:25] sin unbelief
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; those those Jews that were there they
[1:07:29] didn't believe Lazarus could be raised
[1:07:30] from the dead not even the disciples
[1:07:32] knew that God alone knew it and he told
[1:07:35] his son, you're going to you're going to
[1:07:38] give glory to me. So when he came there,
[1:07:40] he was glorifying God by the very words.
[1:07:43] And he said, "Lord, I say this to you."
[1:07:46] I'm paraphrasing because I haven't got
[1:07:47] the Bible open here, but he said, "I do
[1:07:50] the speaking for those that hear.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; They're around here. I don't do it
[1:07:55] because I'm questioning whether or not
[1:07:57] you can raise him. You've already Oh,
[1:07:59] brother, sisters." When all he already
[1:08:00] knew he's going to be raised, why would
[1:08:02] he bow and say, "It's so sorry. I feel
[1:08:05] so bad. That's what most of your
[1:08:07] intellectuals think of. But it wasn't
[1:08:09] that. It was unbelief. That's why any
[1:08:12] godly man weeps for the lack of
[1:08:16] revelation in his group because he wants
[1:08:18] the people to have faith to believe.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Did Jesus have faith that Abra that
[1:08:23] Lazarus is going to raise? Absolutely.
[1:08:25] Did it Wayne or fall short? No.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; It came to pass.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he was doing the
[1:08:31] will of his father.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:34] Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I know the next thing to happen is a reg
[1:08:41] is the res restoration of the gifts to
[1:08:45] the church. And it's the hardest thing
[1:08:47] I've had to do in this pioneering work
[1:08:50] is to do this is to see the people. See,
[1:08:53] God cannot give back the gifts to a
[1:08:55] church as long as his church is divided.
[1:08:59] We've got to get the church together
[1:09:01] before the gifts can come.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And then along
[1:09:08] then come along the Pentecostals.
[1:09:10] This is uh God keeps his word
[1:09:12] Pentecostals with the restoration of the
[1:09:14] gifts. And you spoke with tongues. Yes,
[1:09:17] I did. And then you made a doctrine out
[1:09:19] of that. Yes, the church did. And then
[1:09:22] what happened? Your light has gone out.
[1:09:27] What's the light? There's a man here
[1:09:29] that can turn on the light.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; There's a switch. It's called an
[1:09:33] igniter.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It goes to the panel back here. And as
[1:09:37] soon as this switch, there's a surge of
[1:09:39] power that ignites the lights.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And then and and down and I've been down
[1:09:44] in in in the caves down there where
[1:09:46] brother Brandon went. I know exactly how
[1:09:48] dark it is. Ca uh Carl's bed caverns.
[1:09:51] And when the man and he got a message,
[1:09:54] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:09:55] light. It's the Holy Ghost turning it on
[1:09:57] in your life.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; The reason you're here is because
[1:10:00] there's been a light turned on.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; It isn't a man preaching. It's the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost turning it on. You're different
[1:10:06] today because you had the light turned
[1:10:07] on in your life.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "You spoke with tongues, but
[1:10:12] your light has gone off." What's the
[1:10:14] matter? It's because you failed to stay
[1:10:15] with the word. God's words are always
[1:10:18] unfolding and we must unfold as God's
[1:10:20] word unfolds
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; as as time unfolds, signs unfolds, the
[1:10:27] natural world. This man is the same man
[1:10:29] he was a thousand years ago when God
[1:10:31] made him. He's the same intellectual.
[1:10:33] He's the same intelligence. He's just
[1:10:35] the same man with the same five senses
[1:10:37] that he was thousands of years ago. But
[1:10:40] look what progress he's made in the last
[1:10:42] 50 years.
[1:10:45] I'm going to diverse just for a moment.
[1:10:47] How many were here when Mount St. Helens
[1:10:50] erupted in the 80s?
[1:10:53] Is anybody? I'm not that old.
[1:10:57] It was in the 80s.
[1:11:01] It was a devastating earthquake, wasn't
[1:11:03] it?
[1:11:05] Did you know it was devastating? And the
[1:11:07] molten rock was melted, all you
[1:11:10] geologists here. and it spewed ash out
[1:11:14] of the top of that and ripped part of
[1:11:16] that mountain off. And when the ash came
[1:11:19] down, it floated up thousands and
[1:11:21] thousands of feet, but some of it came
[1:11:23] and landed on the landscape of the
[1:11:25] mountain.
[1:11:27] Now, scientists can think, well, we'll
[1:11:31] get some backhoes up there and a lot of
[1:11:33] brothers or not scientists with rakes
[1:11:35] and shovels and we'll just scoop all
[1:11:37] that ash off of that mountain.
[1:11:40] No way. They didn't know what to do. But
[1:11:42] somebody had an idea and I believe was
[1:11:45] God's instructions to that. It might
[1:11:48] have been just a scientist, but you know
[1:11:50] what he said? I think I've got the
[1:11:52] answer for that.
[1:11:55] And it's called a gopher.
[1:11:58] So they drop some gophers down on that
[1:12:00] barren landscape. Listen to me. And the
[1:12:04] gophers
[1:12:05] have the DNA and the and the ability in
[1:12:08] them to dig.
[1:12:11] Oh, I want you to think spiritual here.
[1:12:14] And so when he put them on they put them
[1:12:16] on that landscape, there was nothing to
[1:12:18] eat. That ash had covered every green
[1:12:21] thing, killed the life, whatever. But
[1:12:24] this little gopher didn't care about
[1:12:26] that because he had an ability to dig.
[1:12:29] Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So he went through the ash of unbelief
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; of of of sterile environment and he got
[1:12:36] down in the ground where we have to get
[1:12:38] spiritually sometimes. But there was a
[1:12:40] little green chute that was still
[1:12:41] buried. Even though the top was dead,
[1:12:44] there was a root down there. Just like
[1:12:46] the seed of God of the believer, there's
[1:12:48] a root. You don't have to tell the seed
[1:12:50] to produce something. Give it in the
[1:12:52] right environment in the right place and
[1:12:53] give it some moisture. The word of God,
[1:12:56] born of the spirit, it'll bring forth
[1:12:58] something. So the gophers are down there
[1:13:00] seeing these little roots of these
[1:13:01] little plants.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many gophers it was and
[1:13:06] it took 40 years but those gophers
[1:13:09] completely transformed that whole
[1:13:11] mountain side. Why? They went down and
[1:13:14] dug the life of those plants and brought
[1:13:16] it up and it started surging and surging
[1:13:19] and surging. That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:13:21] does to a believer. Sometimes it doesn't
[1:13:23] look very pretty. Sometimes you fail
[1:13:25] them all the time. But if you can get
[1:13:27] into that realm where there's true life
[1:13:29] and the life was in the plant, even
[1:13:31] though it was covered, we got to go deep
[1:13:33] in this precious word and and dig out
[1:13:36] what God has done in our day. And he
[1:13:38] sent a message and a messenger and
[1:13:40] that's what sustained it. Then when they
[1:13:42] brought it up to the the ground, all the
[1:13:45] rains and everything, they also
[1:13:47] tunnneled in so that there was moisture
[1:13:49] that could get in
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; and it fed those roots.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it wasn't very long cuz
[1:13:54] brother Ram said even a lily has to push
[1:13:56] you say through the mud. Wasn't too
[1:13:57] long. And that little life said that's
[1:13:59] you this morning. That little life said
[1:14:02] I may be look as bad as a little gopher
[1:14:04] but there's something that I have
[1:14:05] responsible am responsible for and that
[1:14:08] is to send the word that I've heard up
[1:14:10] to where the glory can come.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; I just saw that this week and I said,
[1:14:17] "Lord, can I make a spiritual
[1:14:18] application with that little gopher?"
[1:14:21] You never know, do you?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; I don't think there was a scientist that
[1:14:25] even figured that God's creation can
[1:14:27] change that whole landscape. And I saw
[1:14:29] pictures of it. Unbelievable.
[1:14:32] Just like a an Eden Garden of Paradise
[1:14:35] because of a little gopher.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm a gopher this morning cuz I go
[1:14:41] for the truth.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't expect that. But
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; you all are gophers, too. Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Is this too simple or too?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I hope you do cuz I've got a lot of
[1:14:57] things that I want to talk about.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Well, we read at the beginning,
[1:15:03] I come not with excellency of speech
[1:15:06] that man's wisdom teaches, but in
[1:15:08] demonstration.
[1:15:10] That's kind of a a quite a different
[1:15:14] word. demonstration
[1:15:17] really means manifestation.
[1:15:21] So when Paul said that, he said, "I
[1:15:24] didn't come with excellency of speech."
[1:15:26] And he's one that could have had it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, he was so speech conscious in
[1:15:32] whatever he said.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to diverse a minute. when he
[1:15:36] was watching Steven be stoned
[1:15:40] and he was holding the garments. Now
[1:15:42] remember Stephen and five Stephen and
[1:15:46] Philip and five other brothers were
[1:15:48] asked if you would just take care of the
[1:15:50] widows because we can't spend ourselves
[1:15:52] in prayer if if we have to do all of
[1:15:55] this. And so they laid hands and they
[1:15:57] were men full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; They weren't even preachers
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; as as as we call them preachers. You
[1:16:03] see, you can't is isolate a man and say,
[1:16:06] "Well, he's just a preacher." No, every
[1:16:08] one of you are
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; because you're born again believers.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; You got to live. You may not get behind
[1:16:13] this pulp, but that this is the scariest
[1:16:16] place to be. Let me tell you, cuz I'm
[1:16:17] responsible what I'm saying this
[1:16:18] morning.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And you're responsible in your little
[1:16:22] vocation or whatever you do. You're
[1:16:24] responsible. Don't think you're not. You
[1:16:25] got to live that life in front of
[1:16:27] somebody.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So
[1:16:32] when he said
[1:16:35] when when Stephen started speaking
[1:16:39] that's just a brother to help the widow
[1:16:41] if you ever have a chance study what he
[1:16:44] said you talk about inspirational
[1:16:46] preaching
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; you talk about and then you got
[1:16:49] Philillip was one of the seven and
[1:16:52] Philillip goes and you will listen to
[1:16:54] Philillip and of course Paul was
[1:16:56] listening to
[1:16:59] uh Stephen and then Stephen was stoned
[1:17:01] and he left and and they just Okay, let
[1:17:05] me back. How do you know? But when when
[1:17:07] you go into a restaurant or a Kohl's or
[1:17:09] some place and and there's not a glow of
[1:17:12] the Holy Ghost around you, do do you
[1:17:14] really know if there is or not?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Nope,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; you don't.
[1:17:22] I was sitting at a table
[1:17:25] having lunch few weeks ago
[1:17:29] talking with some brothers.
[1:17:31] Half of them left and I was with one
[1:17:34] brother
[1:17:35] and all of a sudden a a black man
[1:17:42] walked up to the table.
[1:17:47] Now I I didn't think we were talking
[1:17:49] loud. Maybe we were excited. I'm I'm not
[1:17:52] sure. But he come over and stood by me
[1:17:54] and he said, "Brother, I had to come
[1:17:56] over and tell you there's Holy Ghost all
[1:17:59] around you."
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Chad knows when I get going, I
[1:18:04] get fired up. There's just something
[1:18:05] inside of me. I've got a lot of
[1:18:07] experience, and that doesn't mean one
[1:18:08] thing. It's only what God wants to say.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And I said I I kind of dropped my head
[1:18:14] like, "Oh, I was too loud." Well, he's a
[1:18:17] pastor of a church in town here, and we
[1:18:19] were invited to go. And so if I miss one
[1:18:22] Sunday or whatever, I'm going to go
[1:18:24] there. I don't know if they'll receive
[1:18:25] the message. It doesn't it doesn't
[1:18:27] matter to me. All I want to know is is
[1:18:30] he predestinated to see whatever God
[1:18:32] shows him.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; We don't know what God's got in charge
[1:18:37] or plans.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; He's in charge, not us. Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:18:46] Almighty God, your commission by the son
[1:18:48] of God was to go into the world and
[1:18:50] preach the gospel. And we know that the
[1:18:52] gospel is power and demonstration of the
[1:18:56] Holy Ghost. And there's a lady coming.
[1:18:59] Paul taught so many things. And I
[1:19:00] believe the father you're here tonight
[1:19:02] amongst the people. Then he goes in
[1:19:04] about this lady that came forward for
[1:19:06] divine healing and how God used the the
[1:19:09] vessel. But I want to read something
[1:19:12] that brother Brandham said. And we might
[1:19:14] get just a little bit tough here if
[1:19:16] that's all right. Are you relaxed?
[1:19:18] Because I want you to seem
[1:19:23] no matter what outward demonstration you
[1:19:26] give, as long as the inward here is the
[1:19:29] Holy Spirit,
[1:19:32] it will be it'll be the fruits of the
[1:19:35] spirit, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:19:37] meekness, patience, gentleness, and
[1:19:38] temperance. Because God I mean sorry,
[1:19:41] Satan can copy any kind of gift, any
[1:19:44] kind of manifestation, but he can't. He
[1:19:48] can't what? Copy love.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad there's a safeguard there.
[1:19:55] He can't copy love. You know why? He's
[1:19:58] not lovable.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He's perverted.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So any love he has is perverted.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And it's not godly love.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It's the prophet.
[1:20:09] You see a man humble, loving and good to
[1:20:11] his neighbors, good citizen, a good
[1:20:14] fellow and a good man and a Christian
[1:20:16] man, full of love and humility. You
[1:20:18] watch that man. He's good, charitable,
[1:20:22] longsuffering. You can talk about him
[1:20:24] and it's all right. Doesn't even matter
[1:20:26] what you say, he forgives you.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I've had to do that all my life. Haven't
[1:20:30] you been doing that all your life?
[1:20:31] Forgive him. Oh, he didn't really mean
[1:20:33] it. Well, he really blasted you. Oh,
[1:20:35] that's all right. Brother Brandon proved
[1:20:37] that. Doesn't matter what they said.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Pray for him anyway." Well,
[1:20:40] Brother Brandham, he he's gone too far.
[1:20:44] He's blaspheing the Holy Ghost. He said,
[1:20:46] "If I didn't have love for him and pray
[1:20:47] for him, something's wrong with me."
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; We're sure judges, aren't we? When we we
[1:20:54] think we got the answers.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Longsuffering, you can talk about all
[1:20:59] right. He forgives you and don't make
[1:21:00] any difference. That's the real man.
[1:21:05] Keep your eye on him.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to go just touch the
[1:21:11] gifts a little bit and then I'm going to
[1:21:13] come. Oh my, look at the time. Not long
[1:21:16] ago, my little girl called me and I was
[1:21:18] here the other time and he kind of gave
[1:21:20] me a thought while he's preaching. He
[1:21:22] said, she said, "Daddy, I want you to
[1:21:24] come home." I know you've probably read
[1:21:26] this and I said, "Honey, I'm in Texas
[1:21:30] right now, but I sent you a little gift,
[1:21:32] a doll." She said, "That's just," She's
[1:21:36] four years old. "I sent you a little
[1:21:38] doll, honey." She said, "I got it,
[1:21:40] Daddy." And I said, she said, "I want
[1:21:43] you to come home, daddy." Well, honey, I
[1:21:46] sent you a little rabbit from down in
[1:21:47] Chattanooga. I got it, Daddy. But she
[1:21:50] said, "I want you to come home, daddy."
[1:21:52] See? Well, honey, daddy, she said, "I
[1:21:56] love you, and I love the gifts that you
[1:21:59] give me, but I want God. I want daddy.
[1:22:04] He was God to that little four-year-old,
[1:22:06] little Rebecca. But I want daddy. I want
[1:22:09] daddy. That's who I want. I don't just
[1:22:11] want the gifts he gives. I want the
[1:22:13] person. I want him to live inside of me.
[1:22:15] I want to know that he's there to stop
[1:22:17] things when they're happening. And you
[1:22:19] know what he said? He said, "If you feel
[1:22:20] checked on something, that isn't your
[1:22:23] intellect telling you.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's your heart telling you, be careful.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Be careful." Well, I just I can tell you
[1:22:30] some things that happened to my daughter
[1:22:31] almost t-boned and crash and whatever.
[1:22:34] But if you feel corrected in the spirit,
[1:22:37] which is your heart, that's the place of
[1:22:39] the soul. Brother Bram said in your
[1:22:41] heart, that little spot where there's no
[1:22:42] cells or anything. If you are are
[1:22:46] quickened by something in you, pay heed
[1:22:48] to it. Don't let it go. Realize it could
[1:22:51] be God saving you from something. But
[1:22:53] you got to be spiritual to feel that.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; I want to say more. You got to have the
[1:22:57] Holy Ghost.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's anyone here this
[1:23:01] morning that has been seeking for the
[1:23:03] Holy Ghost, but it's kind of an
[1:23:04] embarrassing thing because you come to
[1:23:06] church. Forgive me. I I the Lord told me
[1:23:08] to say this. If it's embarrassing, I'm
[1:23:10] sorry, but I want and I know Brother
[1:23:12] Chad, this altar is full. Not that you
[1:23:14] have to come here, but if you sit in
[1:23:16] your seat and you've been praying, maybe
[1:23:18] when you raised your hand when he was
[1:23:19] praying, maybe that was your desire.
[1:23:22] Young person, old person, doesn't
[1:23:23] matter. We ought to recognize one thing.
[1:23:26] We've got to be in a place where God can
[1:23:28] speak to us.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You've got a place here to respond.
[1:23:32] That's a most glorious thing. I was
[1:23:35] preaching the other day across town and
[1:23:36] there's a little gal that I told Brother
[1:23:38] Chad about it. There's a little gal that
[1:23:41] came up after the service and wanted
[1:23:42] prayer. So, I managed to get down below
[1:23:46] there and I prayed for her and I asked
[1:23:48] her, "Sis, what's what is it?" She said,
[1:23:50] she looked to be about 18, 19 years old.
[1:23:52] She said, "I have a friend in the
[1:23:54] hospital and I want you to pray for
[1:23:56] him." So, we did. I said, "Honey, do you
[1:23:58] understand what I said today?" I think
[1:24:01] so. So, I took her out in the parking
[1:24:03] lot and spent some time with her there.
[1:24:05] Told her she didn't know anything about
[1:24:07] Christianity or the prophet, whatever.
[1:24:10] And so, she's been coming back. And just
[1:24:13] the other day, they baptized her.
[1:24:16] Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; So, you don't know when something is
[1:24:20] going to h I don't know how deep she is.
[1:24:23] I don't really care. I just know one
[1:24:25] thing. It takes a lot for a for an
[1:24:28] outsider to get baptized. When you you
[1:24:30] know, a lot of us have been in the
[1:24:32] message and when we got to the age of
[1:24:33] accountability, we wanted to. But what
[1:24:35] if you never were in the message, didn't
[1:24:36] know anything about a prophet, and all
[1:24:37] of a sudden you have a desire to be
[1:24:39] baptized? You ought to thank God right
[1:24:40] there.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost that we need.
[1:24:46] Oh my.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Bear with me, folks. We got
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; We got to get into some.
[1:24:56] Let me tell you what we need today.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; That's quoting from Brother Brandham.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. And I'm putting myself
[1:25:04] right here. Let me tell you what we need
[1:25:07] today.
[1:25:09] are preachers that would take the gloves
[1:25:12] off and stand in the pulpit and claim
[1:25:16] the full gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; The gloves are off, folks.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; You know what he's talking about? You
[1:25:27] put boxing gloves on, I box. You put
[1:25:29] boxing gloves on so you don't really
[1:25:30] hurt somebody. So, you're all padded
[1:25:32] here.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; But when it's bear knuckle fighting,
[1:25:34] which I've also done, that's a lot of
[1:25:36] injury. But he said, "I'm going to take
[1:25:38] the gloves off
[1:25:40] with a stand in the pulpit, claim the
[1:25:43] full gospel with the power and
[1:25:45] demonstration of the Holy Ghost to get
[1:25:48] the people. You have to shake them a
[1:25:50] little bit this way and compromise a
[1:25:52] little that way." And just exactly the
[1:25:54] way the Lutheran's done, the way the
[1:25:55] Methodists done, that's the way the
[1:25:57] Baptists had done.
[1:25:59] And that's the way the Pentecostals are
[1:26:01] doing now. And he said, "Ph, you ain't
[1:26:04] going to like me after this.
[1:26:08] Do you really care?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; You're nothing and I'm nothing.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; What difference does it make?
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; We need to get embarrassed.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with getting embarrassed?
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; If we don't get embarrassed, maybe
[1:26:23] there's too much pride.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I get embarrassed when somebody says,
[1:26:28] "You're wrong." I go, "Oh, okay. Tell me
[1:26:31] what's right." Brother Ben did it
[1:26:32] through his whole message. He didn't get
[1:26:34] embarrassed,
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; right? cuz he has nothing to get
[1:26:36] embarrassed about.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; We're born in sin, shape, and
[1:26:40] iniquities. He's coming to the world,
[1:26:41] speaking lies. What have we got? We
[1:26:42] haven't got any proof that we're
[1:26:44] special. So, we can get embarrassed. So,
[1:26:46] if you get embarrassed, just remember
[1:26:47] brother Jim said it doesn't matter.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I see some smiling. So, I'm going to
[1:26:53] finish what I have here.
[1:26:59] He said, "Let me tell you something.
[1:27:02] It's the main thing. I'm responsible
[1:27:04] before God now. I believe that to be the
[1:27:08] solemn truth of God. Yes, sir. The only
[1:27:11] thing you have to do is get your heart
[1:27:14] right. Oh, I thought we had to go and do
[1:27:16] this and do that. No, just get your
[1:27:18] heart right. Well, that's so simple,
[1:27:20] brother. Yep, it is.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; But faith has to come in there. And once
[1:27:24] faith takes up a bode there, then
[1:27:26] everything that said is said in the
[1:27:28] word, you agree.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; It's not here. It's here. You're
[1:27:31] agreeing with the word and the word said
[1:27:33] you got to do this and that. Thank you
[1:27:35] Lord. I'm going to do it. So long hair,
[1:27:37] long dresses, whatever. That has nothing
[1:27:39] to do with the believer because the
[1:27:40] believer already settled in his heart
[1:27:42] that he's going to do whatever God said
[1:27:44] in his word.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a preacher to tell you
[1:27:46] that. God's going to take care of you.
[1:27:48] You sisters that are up in age and some
[1:27:51] of you uh brothers, you know exactly.
[1:27:53] You can go through all the tests and
[1:27:54] trials you want, but when you know that
[1:27:56] you know that you know there's something
[1:27:58] that happens and you don't care what
[1:28:00] anybody says.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. We we'll try to hurry and
[1:28:06] then
[1:28:09] I haven't got into my main message about
[1:28:14] I think it was up on the board, wasn't
[1:28:15] it, brother? I think it was spiritual
[1:28:19] ignition.
[1:28:22] Can you just bear with me for a minute?
[1:28:23] I'm going to give you
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a little example what I'm
[1:28:26] talking about.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Spiritual ignition.
[1:28:30] Every one of you that came either with
[1:28:33] another friend or your husband or by
[1:28:35] yourself or whatever
[1:28:37] either put a key in what we call the
[1:28:41] ignition. Correct?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] So if I called a little young whippers
[1:28:46] snapper here that knows brother Jim and
[1:28:48] wouldn't be embarrassed because you know
[1:28:49] kids don't usually get embarrassed until
[1:28:51] they get kind of so high. And I said you
[1:28:54] know what mom and dad do when they put
[1:28:55] their key in the ignition? Oh yeah. I
[1:28:56] watch them every time we go for a ride.
[1:28:59] So it's important that that key is keyed
[1:29:02] to those little loes in the ignition.
[1:29:05] How many know what I'm talking about?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; So it's got to be keyed to that
[1:29:10] ignition. And it's a switch and you
[1:29:14] can't start the car unless now some cars
[1:29:17] have just to push a button. But it's
[1:29:19] because you have the fob in your pocket
[1:29:21] and it's allowing you to push the
[1:29:23] button. It's still a starter and it's
[1:29:25] still a key and it is a ignition.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the car would start and run
[1:29:30] down the road without you in it.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I want to base it all on this
[1:29:36] scripture right here, what brother said.
[1:29:38] So you watch that little key and if you
[1:29:42] forget it in the house and lock yourself
[1:29:45] out, what are you how are you going to
[1:29:47] get into your vehicle?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; It's wired for that phobe for that key.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; So you have to call emergency and
[1:29:54] whatever you can do or break into the
[1:29:57] house or get in the house. Your keys are
[1:29:58] in there or you've forgotten them at a
[1:30:00] supermarket or whatever,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; but without the key.
[1:30:04] And the song says,
[1:30:08] "Faith
[1:30:10] is a key." I'm sorry, that's not the way
[1:30:14] the song says. Um,
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; prayer is the key to heaven, but faith
[1:30:19] unlocks the door.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; So, if you come up and you've been
[1:30:23] praying, that's the key.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; But faith is the one that opens the door
[1:30:29] so you can get in and start the car.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you're thinking in your mind
[1:30:33] here that I know if I put the key in,
[1:30:36] naturally speaking, I can turn that
[1:30:38] thing and start the car. How many know
[1:30:40] that you have to have enough faith that
[1:30:42] your key is going to work in that car to
[1:30:44] get you to the grocery store?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister, there is a key and
[1:30:49] it's called an ignition of the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost. And when that strikes your little
[1:30:55] outfit, whatever it is, it could be a
[1:30:56] truck or a car, whatever, you know
[1:30:59] beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is
[1:31:01] allowing you to believe in that key and
[1:31:03] that starter.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Hold steady.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; But the only way that that car is going
[1:31:09] to move is a spark.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; The key turns the ability of the spark
[1:31:15] to ignite.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And it can't ignite anything until
[1:31:18] there's fuel there. And so all the
[1:31:21] mechanic I I guess you'd probably heard,
[1:31:23] but I I worked with dad as a mechanic. I
[1:31:26] rebuilt many engines. We line board him.
[1:31:28] We did whatever, poured the babbbits.
[1:31:30] We're going back into the 50s now. And
[1:31:33] every time we did it, my my dad, my
[1:31:35] stepfather would say, you know, son, you
[1:31:37] got to have absolute cleanliness because
[1:31:40] any little speck of anything in the
[1:31:42] cylinder walls will score those rings
[1:31:44] and it'll start using oil. So we had to
[1:31:46] clean up and clean up. You know, brother
[1:31:48] Dave is looking at me because he's in
[1:31:49] diesel. So, he This is a combustion. I'm
[1:31:52] talking about combustion engine.
[1:31:54] And because I've rebuilt several, I kind
[1:31:56] of know a little bit about it, but not
[1:31:58] probably as much as you good mechanics.
[1:31:59] But I do know one thing.
[1:32:02] Unless there's a battery or a magneto,
[1:32:04] that motor after it's all rebuilt and
[1:32:06] sitting there has got a lifespan of
[1:32:09] however many miles that you can use it
[1:32:12] and and how many revolutions with the
[1:32:14] crankshaft and the pistons and whatever.
[1:32:17] But those pistons were designed to
[1:32:19] explode.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And when the explosion occurs, brother
[1:32:22] Brandham, I can read the quotes here,
[1:32:24] called it a combustion. He said, "I
[1:32:25] don't understand combustion." But you
[1:32:27] see, combustion is a effect when you
[1:32:30] have the fuel
[1:32:32] and the spark
[1:32:34] and the atmosphere. Now, when the
[1:32:38] gasoline for you, I might lose some
[1:32:40] people here, but the gasoline has to be
[1:32:42] vaporized. You could have gasoline in a
[1:32:46] big b bottle or can up here and I could
[1:32:48] throw a match right in it and put the
[1:32:50] match out. It wouldn't do anything. But
[1:32:51] you atomize that gasoline.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I want you to you atomize it. That's in
[1:32:57] the spirit realm.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; When you atomize a gasoline, it's
[1:33:01] getting ready for ignition.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And when the ignition strikes it, it has
[1:33:06] one purpose. It wants to explode.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in you.
[1:33:11] When you hear the word, you know the
[1:33:13] fuel is the word, but the word alone is
[1:33:17] dead.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; The letter kleth,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; but the spirit gives it life. I don't
[1:33:22] care how good I rebuilt an engine. If I
[1:33:25] didn't have it ready to experience the
[1:33:28] fire of the fuel and the gas that was in
[1:33:31] there and it atomized into another
[1:33:35] a vapor, it would never start. But even
[1:33:37] if I did all that and it started, it it
[1:33:42] isn't going to go anywhere.
[1:33:45] So I can go in and sit down in the flesh
[1:33:46] seats and go to sleep.
[1:33:49] What do we do engines for?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; What do we come to the message for? To
[1:33:52] move on.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; There has to be a move. So that's called
[1:33:55] transmission.
[1:33:57] Did you know the scripture? Oh dear, I
[1:33:59] get going on the transfiguration. When
[1:34:02] Jesus was up on the top, did you know
[1:34:04] that means transformed?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Same word,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; transfigured.
[1:34:10] So, you're transformed by the renewing.
[1:34:12] But it isn't this mind. It's the mind of
[1:34:15] Christ.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; So, here I'm sitting in a an old model A
[1:34:19] that I rebuilt and I'm I'm saying, "Dad,
[1:34:23] I I think I did right." Well, son, we'll
[1:34:24] find out. And so I got in there and
[1:34:28] turned the key on and pushed the
[1:34:30] starters on the floor and pushing and
[1:34:31] roar roar roar roar. And I said, "Dad,
[1:34:34] what's wrong?" He said, "It's not
[1:34:36] getting any fire.
[1:34:38] It's not getting any ignition." Well,
[1:34:40] Dad, I've got the key in. I He said,
[1:34:41] "No, come out here and look." And some
[1:34:43] of the plug wires. Now, remember the
[1:34:45] plugs, Brother Brand, I've got the
[1:34:47] quote. He said, "That's where the spark
[1:34:49] comes from."
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And how did they receive the spark? From
[1:34:53] the coil or the magneto. And it sends
[1:34:55] that message down to those sparks.
[1:34:59] And the sparks are the Holy Ghost. But
[1:35:01] it takes a power of the Holy Ghost to to
[1:35:03] start them going so that they send down
[1:35:07] through the spark plug to the combustion
[1:35:09] chamber so that little vaporized gas can
[1:35:12] be ignited.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in his
[1:35:16] service. So when our brother starts to
[1:35:18] preach something and you graise God,
[1:35:20] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:35:21] There's an explosion going on. It's
[1:35:24] called combustion in the realm of the
[1:35:25] spirit.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You can't live in a church or in a in a
[1:35:30] age without having that happen in your
[1:35:32] life if you're a believer.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; So when you die and you you you're put
[1:35:36] in the grave, you're already alive in
[1:35:39] Jesus Christ while you're here because
[1:35:41] the rapture is a revelation.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; It's not some figment and something
[1:35:45] that's going to happen way down. It's
[1:35:46] right now.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that rapture is a
[1:35:49] revelation?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe faith is a revelation? Do
[1:35:52] you believe that God can come on the
[1:35:53] scene in any aspect of your life and
[1:35:55] quicken the word to you?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me read a couple more quotes
[1:36:01] here and then we'll try to try to wind
[1:36:04] down.
[1:36:06] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:36:10] how precious his word is.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; So, you'll bear with me. I'm going to
[1:36:15] just define something I just said.
[1:36:16] Remember I said I've got it written
[1:36:17] here. Here's what the prophet said.
[1:36:21] Not to have this is 1963 sir we would
[1:36:24] see Jesus not to have him explain today
[1:36:27] with great intellectual messages explain
[1:36:30] the Lord we can explain it till you
[1:36:34] we can explain it till you can see the
[1:36:36] real picture
[1:36:38] that isn't what we're looking for
[1:36:40] tonight we're not looking to the
[1:36:43] mechanics we're looking for the dynamics
[1:36:46] and I know you've probably heard this
[1:36:47] preached by by brother Chad or many
[1:36:50] other ministers but I want to zero in on
[1:36:52] something. You got the mechanics. I know
[1:36:54] what the mechanics are because I built
[1:36:56] the motor.
[1:36:58] I know the talent tolerances are right.
[1:37:00] I miked all the journals. I know exactly
[1:37:02] what it is. But that doesn't mean I
[1:37:04] don't make a mistake, but that's just
[1:37:06] the mechanics. And it would sit on the
[1:37:09] garage floor for centuries if if I
[1:37:11] didn't pick it up and apply
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; something to it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; It had to go in a vehicle.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; You're the vehicle. That's right.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; The mechanics,
[1:37:24] that's you.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; So God wants to take your life and put
[1:37:29] it in a vehicle for his pleasure that he
[1:37:32] can send you out. That's why I'm getting
[1:37:33] back to you'll be my witnesses.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; He's going to demonstrate his love and
[1:37:38] life through you.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Jim, I'm nothing. I'm
[1:37:41] just a sister that stays at home and Oh,
[1:37:43] bless your heart. That's exactly what we
[1:37:45] need. It's more sisters going home. I
[1:37:47] know cuz I feed on some of their their
[1:37:49] meal trained meals.
[1:37:51] And I want to say to the sisters, boy,
[1:37:54] you can you sure can cook.
[1:38:00] So, let me finish with the what he said.
[1:38:02] We've got mechanics of the religions of
[1:38:05] the bride so bottleized. What a word. It
[1:38:10] looks like a great big 16 to 35 coach
[1:38:14] train sitting out there on the track.
[1:38:18] But you haven't got any steam in it. It
[1:38:22] takes the dynamics to perform with the
[1:38:25] mechanics. So, you got this huge freight
[1:38:28] train out there loaded with coal and
[1:38:30] everything else and it hasn't moved an
[1:38:31] inch.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; It can't move unless the inspiration
[1:38:35] hits it.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You know, inspiration is the opposite to
[1:38:40] expiration. You look at your food and
[1:38:42] you see it's expired. Oh, we can't use
[1:38:44] that. Well, they kind of give you a
[1:38:46] little bit of leeway there, but when you
[1:38:48] die, you're expired.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll go here. You have to die to
[1:38:55] yourself
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; to be inspired.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; I said you have to die to yourself. So
[1:39:01] anything you're going through, consider
[1:39:03] it nothing.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; You give your life to the gospel.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; It isn't just Paul that gives his life.
[1:39:08] You have to give your life.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Every believer gives their life because
[1:39:12] they have to die to themselves. And by
[1:39:14] dying to yourself, you're expiring your
[1:39:17] duty or your ideas or whatever else you
[1:39:20] have. and you're going to live a new and
[1:39:21] it's going to be used by God so you can
[1:39:24] be a vehicle of his expression.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe his word?
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to try to close.
[1:39:32] I'll call the musicians up in just a
[1:39:34] moment. And I've got a song I want to
[1:39:37] sing that inspired me so much in my
[1:39:39] little study. I just said, "Would you
[1:39:41] dare sing that for the people?" You
[1:39:43] know, I haven't sung for a long time
[1:39:45] because I'd rather preach than sing
[1:39:46] anyway. But I I sometimes get a burden
[1:39:49] to sing. And now you're going to help me
[1:39:51] today. But listen to what he said. You
[1:39:54] haven't got any steam because it takes
[1:39:57] the dynamics to perform with the
[1:39:58] mechanics. And what we need now is to
[1:40:00] see that this is what we've been taught
[1:40:02] all these years. Is it the truth or not?
[1:40:04] It's been explained over and over and
[1:40:06] over through different seminaries and
[1:40:08] churches and forth until we are looking
[1:40:11] to see who this person is that'll make
[1:40:13] this real. Brother Brandham, how would
[1:40:16] you do it? We said last night, we have
[1:40:20] so much of the mechanics and not the
[1:40:21] dynamics. Now, my body is a mechanics,
[1:40:24] but my body will not operate without the
[1:40:26] dynamics. The spirit of God and the
[1:40:29] spirit operates my body and it brings it
[1:40:32] into control. Oh, I love this. brings it
[1:40:34] into control. Like an automobile with no
[1:40:37] gasoline in it, with no firing power
[1:40:39] power, no matter how fine the dynamics
[1:40:42] are, the mechanics is fixed up, the
[1:40:45] cylinders, the points, the plugs,
[1:40:47] whatever more, it's got to have
[1:40:52] the current.
[1:40:54] So, the current that's running through
[1:40:56] this building, I looked in the back
[1:40:57] there and saw the panel and all the
[1:40:59] conduit that's running in from all the
[1:41:01] lights. And you don't look at that, but
[1:41:05] there's a little energy running along
[1:41:07] the wire that's expressed in the light.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; And without that coming through the
[1:41:12] wires and expressing the light, you'd be
[1:41:15] in darkness. It's got to be the same
[1:41:17] thing in your soul.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; There's got to be an expression of the
[1:41:20] power of God in your soul. And you will
[1:41:22] be the light of the world. But without
[1:41:24] that expression that God put in your
[1:41:27] heart, you will never be the light of
[1:41:29] the world. You can't even know what God
[1:41:30] wants you to do because you have to have
[1:41:32] the Holy Ghost. Here's what he said. My
[1:41:35] body is the my body is mechanics and the
[1:41:39] dynamics is the spirit and the spirit
[1:41:40] operates by body and that brings it into
[1:41:43] control like an automobile with no
[1:41:45] gasoline, no firing, no fine dynamics.
[1:41:48] The mechanics is fixed up in the
[1:41:50] cylinders which I just read. It's got to
[1:41:52] have the current also. You got to take
[1:41:54] all of it together.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; That's the way God is. It's got to get a
[1:41:59] believer with God to make the contact.
[1:42:03] Then something is fixing to happen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Exactly right. I'll
[1:42:13] find my last quote here and then I'm
[1:42:14] going to have the musicians come. Just
[1:42:16] hold steady though.
[1:42:31] I know there were several that raised
[1:42:32] their hands when brother Chad was taking
[1:42:35] the prayer request
[1:42:37] and uh I have no idea and Brother Chad
[1:42:40] doesn't probably but there's needs in
[1:42:42] our assembly. How many know that
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; it's pretty quiet.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; I said there's needs in our assembly.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; How many today have a need?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless your heart. If I could, the
[1:42:57] prophet said, if I could go down and
[1:42:58] heal every one of you, I would. So, I'm
[1:43:00] going to tell you how it comes. Okay?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You watch a patient that's healed,
[1:43:08] lest it is an outstanding miracle, watch
[1:43:11] divine healing and a miracle is two
[1:43:14] different things.
[1:43:16] Divine healing is one thing and miracle
[1:43:18] is another thing. But an ordinary run of
[1:43:21] divine healing when the unclean spirits
[1:43:23] cast out and a cancer devil when it
[1:43:26] leaves a person now or say we take
[1:43:29] something so you can see it more
[1:43:31] visible. I'll say the cataract. What
[1:43:34] happened when that man if you'll notice
[1:43:36] the blind person I don't know whether
[1:43:38] I've ever had any here or not yet con
[1:43:42] cataract eyes and I'll let them stand
[1:43:45] for a few moments. Why? so that the ca
[1:43:48] shrinkage begins to take place on the
[1:43:50] platform he's talking about tell him
[1:43:53] them to come back and give a testimony
[1:43:56] oh my they can see wonderful
[1:43:59] oh my just I can see things what's the
[1:44:02] matter it's the life is gone brother
[1:44:05] said the body of the cataract is
[1:44:07] shrinking but he said after a while
[1:44:11] they begin to get it that's why I want
[1:44:13] to establish something
[1:44:15] I have no issue with The doctors I think
[1:44:18] they're absolutely God's gift to people.
[1:44:21] But there is a great physician.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; That with the Holy Ghost, you have the
[1:44:25] right to get your healing
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; with the right mental attitude towards
[1:44:30] the any divine promise of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; It'll manifest itself.
[1:44:36] So here's what he said. You begin to get
[1:44:39] a headache after you prayed for it. Get
[1:44:40] up the next morning. I'm losing my sight
[1:44:42] again.
[1:44:44] Even though the cataract was was gone,
[1:44:46] you're losing your sight again. Listen
[1:44:48] to me. Some of them said, "Uhoh, he was
[1:44:52] just worked up. That bunch of holy
[1:44:55] rollers got you worked up." Don't you
[1:44:58] believe that.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; That's a lie of the devil. If you
[1:45:01] believe that, you'll go right back blind
[1:45:04] again.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? It takes time
[1:45:08] sometimes. Unless it's an instantaneous
[1:45:10] miracle, it takes time.
[1:45:12] Don't lose your patience.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; If you really from your heart and soul
[1:45:16] said, "Lord, I believe you've healed me.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; In your name, I accept my healing." Stay
[1:45:21] with it.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; People, I'm asking you to stay with it.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, you know, I never
[1:45:28] really really understood it." And what?
[1:45:30] Stop just a moment. Listen to what he
[1:45:32] said.
[1:45:36] Then what happens?
[1:45:39] and you say, "Well,
[1:45:41] I'll just hold on and say, "I'm sorry,
[1:45:43] Lord. I believe." But you've already
[1:45:45] expressed doubt right there.
[1:45:49] Then what happens? The body swells for
[1:45:51] so long, it covers over that sight
[1:45:54] again. That cancer in the body that was
[1:45:59] just ruled out and covered by the prayer
[1:46:02] of the saints will swell.
[1:46:07] You'll become hurting and aching again.
[1:46:11] Then you'll get horribly sick. Oh, wait
[1:46:13] a minute, brother Jim. Horribly sick.
[1:46:15] Boy, he prayed for me in the cataract
[1:46:17] shunk. Yep. But let's look at what
[1:46:19] divine healing really is. He said,
[1:46:21] "You'll get terribly sick." Sick. Why?
[1:46:24] That big growth of dead flesh in you is
[1:46:27] laying there dead. You go back to the
[1:46:30] doctor and he will say, "Oh, that's
[1:46:33] nonsense. That cannot be right. I can
[1:46:35] still see it. It's there. But brother
[1:46:38] Ram said, "But it's dead."
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Then he says one beautiful thing,
[1:46:42] "Hallelujah, it's dead."
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; This is for somebody this morning. Now,
[1:46:48] the bloodstream has to purify the body.
[1:46:50] Every time the heart throws the blood
[1:46:52] around the body, it picks up that
[1:46:53] infection that was there. Sure, you're
[1:46:55] sick. If you had a chunk of meat hanging
[1:46:57] out in the shed somewhere or long or
[1:47:01] whatever and something big around as
[1:47:03] your finger hanging there and it was
[1:47:04] dead that much dead meat hanging in you.
[1:47:08] Well, it's rotting inside of you. Well,
[1:47:11] of course your bloodstream has to keep
[1:47:13] that pure as it pumps through. But there
[1:47:16] there's a dead body inside of you
[1:47:18] because of faith.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Because of faith, there's a dead body in
[1:47:22] you.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Well, we don't want a dead body in us.
[1:47:24] But you want faith, don't you? Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Faith will take care of it.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Oh dear. Just hold steady.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Oh dear. No matter how sick I get, that
[1:47:36] doesn't have nothing to do with it. The
[1:47:37] first thing you know, you'll get cleared
[1:47:38] up. Everything will be all right. It's
[1:47:40] dead. The operation that the doctor
[1:47:42] would have taken from you, that same
[1:47:44] growth is laying in you with no life in
[1:47:46] it, and it'll eventually leave.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; That's divine healing.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; That's not miracles. Now
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; instantaneous is miracles.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I've been around seven years teaching
[1:47:58] across America having these healing
[1:48:00] service. I just got a good notion to
[1:48:03] start back across the country teaching
[1:48:04] the Bible on de demonology. How the
[1:48:07] people can understand what to do. And
[1:48:09] that's the reason they go to these
[1:48:11] meetings. If you don't understand the
[1:48:13] people come out many times they get
[1:48:14] prayed for and then they come back in a
[1:48:16] week or so and say, "Well, I've still
[1:48:18] got it." Brother Bram said, "Of course
[1:48:19] you do because you doubted it." Yeah,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; folks. I know what this is.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You're looking at someone that's
[1:48:26] experienced divine healing.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And every symptom would say the people
[1:48:31] say, "Oh, he's not healed." I know that
[1:48:33] I was healed and am healed by the grace
[1:48:36] of God and the faith in his word. That's
[1:48:39] the healing.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; For by grace are you saved through
[1:48:42] faith, that not in yourself is the gift
[1:48:44] of God. He dropped the faith of the
[1:48:46] faith of God in me. And that is what
[1:48:49] heals everybody. It's the faith. I don't
[1:48:51] care how old you are. I don't care if
[1:48:53] you've gone through operations like I
[1:48:55] have. You still have an opportunity to
[1:48:57] stand for the word and say, "Get behind
[1:49:00] me, Satan." Brother Bram said, "He's
[1:49:01] just a bluff." But, Brother Jim, I'm
[1:49:03] older and you know, I have to go through
[1:49:05] things. I don't care what age you are.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a little baby with
[1:49:08] a brain tumor. I don't care. God is
[1:49:11] still the healer.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord as we stand this morning
[1:49:15] that health thee. musicians if you would
[1:49:18] come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:49:30] So Abraham
[1:49:32] didn't get weaker. He would have if his
[1:49:35] faith had failed,
[1:49:38] but he got stronger.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And if you've got something that you're
[1:49:42] trusting the Lord for, don't lose
[1:49:44] patience. That's what brother Brandham
[1:49:45] said. Time.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; That's the worst thing. That's the worst
[1:49:49] battle brother Brandham had was time.
[1:49:52] Sight and time. Well, you don't look
[1:49:54] healed. You don't act healed. Yeah.
[1:49:56] Don't Don't go by sight and go by time.
[1:49:58] Whatever God's give you patience, if it
[1:50:00] takes three years, you still believe it.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter because it has nothing to
[1:50:05] do with the physical. It's a spiritual
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; inside.
[1:50:09] Oh, help help us Lord to see. Help us
[1:50:13] Lord to see. I'm leaving a lot out as
[1:50:15] you know, but I got a song.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; And I you know what I I said as I was
[1:50:21] studying early late last night and early
[1:50:25] this morning, I said, you know, Lord,
[1:50:26] there's a song
[1:50:29] that was written in 1861 by a a sister
[1:50:32] how and it's called
[1:50:37] Well, I'm going to read it if that's all
[1:50:39] right.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:46] the battle hymn of the republic.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know the words, but
[1:50:52] we're fixing to get them.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; And I want you to get excited because
[1:50:56] well, I don't want you to get You should
[1:50:57] be excited.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:51:01] as we get a key, I don't know. They
[1:51:02] think it's B flat or C or G or whatever.
[1:51:05] I know you all know that song.
[1:51:08] They're very hesitant, aren't they?
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:13] Can you get me? Is that B flat? Okay,
[1:51:15] that's as good as any.
[1:51:18] I'm waiting on you folks. You're going
[1:51:21] to sing it from your soul.
[1:51:25] Mine eyes have seen the glory
[1:51:29] of the coming of the Lord. Have you? He
[1:51:34] is trampling out the vintage where the
[1:51:39] grapes of wrath are stored.
[1:51:42] He has loosed the faithful lightning of
[1:51:47] his terable
[1:51:49] swift sword. That's my king. His tr
[1:51:53] is maring
[1:51:56] on.

[1:52:02] Glory.
[1:52:03] Hallelujah.
[1:52:07] Sing it. Glory.
[1:52:10] Glory.

[1:52:24] His truth is mighty.
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:32] I have seen in the heart of 100 serving
[1:52:39] cats. Yeah.
[1:52:42] Heaven offer in thee
[1:52:46] and I can reach righteous sentence by
[1:52:52] the different
[1:52:54] land
[1:52:56] is
[1:52:58] my
[1:53:02] singing. Oh glory,

[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:20] glory,
[1:53:22] glory, hallelujah.
[1:53:27] His truth
[1:53:29] is still maring.
[1:53:35] He has sound forth the trouble in our
[1:53:38] day that'll never sound retreat. He has
[1:53:44] sent me the hearts of men before his
[1:53:48] judge
[1:53:54] to answer
[1:53:57] my feet
[1:53:59] of God.
[1:54:01] Sing it everyone. Glory, glory
[1:54:06] to glory,
[1:54:08] glory.

[1:54:28] His truth is
[1:54:35] the last verse in the beauty.
[1:54:40] Christ was born across the sea
[1:54:44] for the glory in his boss and death
[1:54:47] transfigured
[1:54:49] you and me
[1:54:51] as he died to make men holy. Let us die
[1:54:55] to self
[1:54:57] to self our God.
[1:55:06] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:55:09] [Music]

[1:56:00] [Applause]
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:06] God be praised.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking as brother Jim was
[1:56:10] preaching, I couldn't help myself of
[1:56:13] brother Brandham when he went to
[1:56:14] Mishawaka
[1:56:16] and he saw something he didn't think he
[1:56:18] could see. saw a 90-year-old man that he
[1:56:22] thought was too old to preach, but when
[1:56:24] the spirit of God hit him, he jumped up,
[1:56:25] clicked his heels, and said, "Whoopee,
[1:56:27] there's not enough room up here for me
[1:56:29] to preach."
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You know what that was? That that's not
[1:56:32] an earthly enthusiasm. That's the spark.
[1:56:35] Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; That hit. Amen. I was thinking of
[1:56:38] Brother Jim, you know, he he's 84 years
[1:56:41] old. He's my flip opposite. I'm 48.
[1:56:45] Amen.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; And brother Mim talked about brother and
[1:56:47] sister kids still going out and trying
[1:56:49] to reach people. They were in their 80s
[1:56:51] and started preaching before he he was a
[1:56:54] baby, before he was born, I think. And
[1:56:56] brother Jim's been preaching this
[1:56:57] message before I was born. Brother Beam
[1:57:00] said, "Sometimes they get tired." And I
[1:57:02] watched them and I think I'm not tired
[1:57:03] anymore. And this morning I thought, I'm
[1:57:05] not tired anymore. What I need is I need
[1:57:08] that fresh spark of the Holy Ghost to
[1:57:10] give me that same enthusiasm. How many
[1:57:12] of you saw, Amen, a brother 84 years old
[1:57:15] with enthusiasm for not for sports and
[1:57:17] not for uh a business, not for making
[1:57:20] some progress in the world, but for the
[1:57:22] word. Amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, it makes me want a fresh spark.
[1:57:26] Amen. Brother Beam said, "There's one
[1:57:27] filling, but many refillings, and today
[1:57:29] I desire a refilling." Amen. How many of
[1:57:32] you want to be filled with the Holy
[1:57:34] Ghost? How many you want a spark every
[1:57:36] day of your life?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, feel yourself, Amen. sitting
[1:57:40] there as an engine with no crank anymore
[1:57:42] sometimes just parked not going anywhere
[1:57:44] but you want to get down the road it's
[1:57:46] going to take a spark of the power of
[1:57:48] God igniting the word that we love
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; igniting the word that we love moving us
[1:57:54] who are already children of God filled
[1:57:56] with the word that we love. Amen. Filled
[1:57:58] with the Holy Ghost but we need it to
[1:58:00] spark again and again and again.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are holding on
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; with faith believing in the promise?
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; What an encouragement to my soul.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Man, God is so good to us. Friends, if
[1:58:15] you could just bow your heads with me, I
[1:58:17] just want
[1:58:19] just wanted you to have an opportunity.
[1:58:23] If you're here and you don't feel like
[1:58:25] you've ever received the baptism of the
[1:58:26] Holy Ghost, you don't feel like that
[1:58:28] spark has ignited that you love the
[1:58:31] word, you love God, you want to be a
[1:58:33] child of God, you believe in your heart
[1:58:34] that you are, you've accepted all that
[1:58:37] God has done for you and all that he's
[1:58:39] done in this hour, but you just feel
[1:58:41] like you're a parked car and you want to
[1:58:45] be moving by the power of God's spirit.
[1:58:47] Not by intellect, not by your own
[1:58:49] effort, but you just want to move. I
[1:58:51] invite you now just to raise your hand
[1:58:53] to God to signify to God, God, I want to
[1:58:55] spark. I don't want to be a parked car.
[1:58:57] I believe I'm part of the program. I
[1:58:59] believe you're calling me. I believe it
[1:59:01] all. But I need a power that's beyond my
[1:59:03] power to move me in your program. You
[1:59:06] just lift your hands so God would know.
[1:59:08] Amen. God, you see the hands, Lord, just
[1:59:11] move down. I pray, God, that the power
[1:59:14] of your Holy Ghost would spark an
[1:59:16] ignition right now in every heart and
[1:59:18] every life. Lord, if we're holding on to
[1:59:20] your word for a manifestation of healing
[1:59:23] or deliverance, I pray you would spark
[1:59:24] it now, that you would quicken it to
[1:59:26] life, that we would know that I've got
[1:59:28] the promise, no matter how long it
[1:59:30] takes.
[1:59:32] Oh God, I pray you'd move down in hearts
[1:59:34] and lives, move into your souls of your
[1:59:37] children, Lord, and bring what's laying
[1:59:39] there to life. Lord, they're responding
[1:59:42] because of a seed. They're responding
[1:59:43] because of your word. They're responding
[1:59:45] because there's something laying there.
[1:59:47] There's a predestination that's calling
[1:59:49] out for more. And I pray God you would
[1:59:51] come and provide the more. Lord, that
[1:59:54] you would provide the power, amen, of
[1:59:56] the power to bring a changed life, the
[1:59:58] power to move your children into motion,
[2:00:00] the power to bring your word to pass in
[2:00:03] our lives. Pray you'd do it now, Lord,
[2:00:06] for your preaching is not in vain.
[2:00:08] There's a reason you moved our brother
[2:00:10] this way. There's a reason you moved him
[2:00:11] this way. Amen. It's your calling to us,
[2:00:14] Lord. You're calling to us to have that
[2:00:18] spark of life. You wouldn't have
[2:00:20] preached it if you're not willing to
[2:00:22] give it. Lord, you wouldn't have called
[2:00:23] for it. You wouldn't have opened our
[2:00:25] eyes. You wouldn't have given us a
[2:00:26] desire if you're not willing right now
[2:00:29] to meet that desire. Oh God, I pray you
[2:00:32] touch the lives of your children. May
[2:00:34] you send the power of the Holy Ghost to
[2:00:36] quicken them like you did on the day of
[2:00:38] Pentecost, like you've done all through
[2:00:40] the ages, Lord, when you quickened your
[2:00:42] children to life. May you do it now,
[2:00:44] God.
[2:00:45] I'm asking in Jesus Christ's name. Let
[2:00:48] nobody leave here feeling like a
[2:00:50] unmovable parked car with no power. But
[2:00:53] Lord, may they leave here knowing that
[2:00:55] God, you've sparked something in their
[2:00:57] life. And God, you've called them to
[2:00:59] move down the road and carry your
[2:01:01] program forward. Lord, let it be so. Let
[2:01:04] it be now. Let it be real. We ask it in
[2:01:08] Jesus Christ's name. Lord, move over
[2:01:11] your children. sweep through this place.
[2:01:15] God, you sent a wind, Lord, on the day
[2:01:18] of Pentecost, and you sent a fire broke
[2:01:20] into the licks of fire. And God, we may
[2:01:23] not be, Lord, in that place where we
[2:01:25] would actually feel a physical wind or
[2:01:28] we would see licks of fire, but may the
[2:01:30] reality of that wind sweep through the
[2:01:33] souls of your people. May they feel it
[2:01:35] move them on the inside, Lord. And may
[2:01:38] they know that there's a fire that's
[2:01:39] burning on the inside, the lick of fire
[2:01:42] that's burning the old life out and
[2:01:44] bringing life through that seed. Lord,
[2:01:46] may they feel the wind sweeping through
[2:01:49] this place as it sweeps through the
[2:01:51] hearts of your children.
[2:01:53] Breathe on us, God. Give us, Lord, that
[2:01:56] life that we so want. And Lord Jesus,
[2:01:59] there's so many of us, Lord, that we've
[2:02:01] had that experience of quickening, the
[2:02:03] quickening power to quicken us to life.
[2:02:06] But oh God, sometimes Lord, we we we we
[2:02:09] put it back in park again. We got tired
[2:02:11] and we got wore out. We got beat down
[2:02:13] and we've lost a bit of enthusiasm,
[2:02:16] Lord. God, I pray that you would come by
[2:02:18] the power of your spirit and reignite us
[2:02:21] once again, Lord. God, as your prophet
[2:02:23] told us that we could have many
[2:02:24] feelings, Lord, I'm lifting my hands for
[2:02:26] another outpouring of your spirit in my
[2:02:28] life. Amen. That you would give me the
[2:02:30] enthusiasm of this gospel, the
[2:02:33] excitement for the word. Amen. the zeal
[2:02:35] and the passion to keep moving forward.
[2:02:38] I pray God you'd fill me aresh that
[2:02:40] you'd pour yourself in me again. May I
[2:02:42] feel your wind sweep through me and
[2:02:44] through many others once again. And may
[2:02:46] you, God, give us that excitement and
[2:02:49] enthusiasm we long to have. God, we love
[2:02:52] you. We're so excited to serve your
[2:02:54] program. We're so excited to be alive in
[2:02:57] this end time. We're so thrilled, Lord,
[2:02:59] that you've privileged us with ears to
[2:03:01] hear and eyes to see and a heart to
[2:03:03] perceive.
[2:03:05] God, may you continue to sweep through
[2:03:07] us and move us in your program. We give
[2:03:10] ourselves holy to you, Lord. We love you
[2:03:12] with all of our heart. We rejoice in
[2:03:15] this word. We rejoice in your life. We
[2:03:17] rejoice in the power that you've sent,
[2:03:20] God. May you accomplish your goal in us.
[2:03:23] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:03:29] Amen. As we sing, Amen. I welcome you.
[2:03:33] If God has moved in your heart and
[2:03:35] stirred in you and you still feel
[2:03:36] stirred, you want to pray, don't rush.
[2:03:38] Don't don't hurry out. If God's still
[2:03:40] working in you, amen, you're welcome to
[2:03:43] stay, worship, pray, come to the altar,
[2:03:45] bow at your seats, bow your head where
[2:03:47] you're at. It doesn't matter to me what
[2:03:50] you do. But if you feel God stirring and
[2:03:53] drawing and calling, don't walk out the
[2:03:55] door until you fully surrender to that
[2:03:57] call.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just give him a chance. Amen. To
[2:04:02] do his work. And God bless you, brother
[2:04:05] Riley.
[2:04:09] My
[2:04:11] faith looks up
