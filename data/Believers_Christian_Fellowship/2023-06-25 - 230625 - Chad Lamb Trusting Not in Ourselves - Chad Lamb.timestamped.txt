[13:11] and God as we take ourselves Lord out of
[13:14] the way now and just rest in your

[13:35] this vessel into your controller and
[13:37] that you would speak the Eternal words

[13:59] are always say and do
[14:01] Jesus Christ name we pray
[14:06] amen God bless you while we're standing
[14:07] let's take our Bibles and turn to the
[14:09] Book of Proverbs man it's a good morning
[14:11] good to see you all here amen I know
[14:14] that this is vacation season so I've
[14:16] known of several families that are out
[14:18] on vacation and and everybody's going to
[14:20] be coming to or over the next couple
[14:22] months so we're always grateful to see
[14:24] the ones who are here amen God bless you
[14:26] all amen God is good
[14:28] we should just all go on vacation at the
[14:30] same time and I'll be here at the same
[14:31] time so we don't have to do all that I
[14:34] don't like the separation I want to
[14:36] remind you too that brother Noel Johnson
[14:38] will be preaching for us this Wednesday
[14:39] I mean he always comes up in the area
[14:41] around the time of the believer's shoes
[14:44] camp and so sometimes it works out that
[14:46] he can take a service for us so that's
[14:48] good we appreciate that also I heard
[14:50] from one of the brothers who headed over
[14:53] yesterday to Holmes County to help with
[14:55] the church building that they had a good
[14:56] day there's a lot of people who showed
[14:58] up we only had a few brothers from here
[15:00] because of the late notice but I believe
[15:01] brother Dominic was there brother Josiah
[15:04] priest and brother Riley Sanders so
[15:06] thank God they made it over but they had
[15:08] a good work crew and they got a lot done
[15:09] so that's wonderful if they do another
[15:12] work day I will do my very best to let
[15:14] you know ahead of time amen I will be
[15:16] more faithful and before we read the
[15:19] scriptures I just want to wish my wife a
[15:21] happy birthday
[15:22] and God bless you and man it's her
[15:24] birthday today and also it's Kylie white
[15:27] or Kelly Weichert so Cali's got a good
[15:29] birthday too amen
[15:32] amen let's read now Proverbs 28
[15:36] and verse
[15:40] Proverbs 28 and verse 26. well we run
[15:43] verse and we'll let you have your seats
[15:46] Proverbs 28
[15:49] and verse 26.
[15:51] he that trusteth in his own heart as a
[15:54] fool
[15:55] but whoso walketh wisely he shall be
[15:58] delivered
[15:59] amen you can have your seeds what an
[16:01] opening scripture
[16:04] but it's the truth
[16:06] he that trusteth in his own heart is a
[16:09] fool
[16:10] amen uh
[16:13] this is a subject that the Lord's been
[16:16] dealing with me on but for a title I'd
[16:17] like to take trusting not in ourselves
[16:20] trusting not in ourselves for the
[16:23] Proverbs is full of statements like this
[16:25] and we're going to pull a few out and
[16:26] read them but that there's a major theme
[16:28] in the Bible around this we won't get
[16:30] into all of it but he that trusteth in
[16:32] his own heart as a fool in this word
[16:34] heart
[16:35] is is interpreted mind will heart
[16:40] understanding our knowledge our thinking
[16:42] our reflecting our memory our
[16:45] inclination our resolution our
[16:47] determination and will our conscience
[16:48] amen so he that's trusting in our own
[16:51] understanding our own thinking our own
[16:53] conscience our own resolution our own
[16:56] inclinations
[16:59] he that's trusting in his own heart is a
[17:01] fool
[17:03] amen so we have to put our trust in
[17:06] something other than ourselves amen and
[17:08] I thank God that we live in a day that
[17:10] God has provided that something that we
[17:12] can put our trust in other than
[17:14] ourselves let's turn real quickly over
[17:16] to the Book of Jeremiah I want to read
[17:18] two more scriptures real quickly and
[17:20] then we'll go back to Proverbs let's go
[17:23] to Jeremiah
[17:25] 17 Jeremiah 17.
[17:34] Jeremiah 17.
[17:38] and nine
[17:43] says the heart is deceitful above all
[17:46] things and desperately wicked who can
[17:49] know it
[17:51] and then then Jeremiah goes on to say or
[17:54] through Jeremiah the Lord says I the
[17:56] Lord search the heart I try the Reigns
[17:58] as reigns mean your inward part your
[18:00] belly
[18:01] I searched the heart I try the Reigns
[18:04] even to give every man according to his
[18:05] ways and according to the fruit of his
[18:08] doings so the heart is deceitful above
[18:11] all things and desperately wicked who
[18:13] can know it the Lord knows it and the
[18:15] Lord is the one who searched the heart
[18:16] and he tries the Reigns
[18:19] amen it's amazing that God goes uh goes
[18:24] deeper than what's on the outside but he
[18:25] goes down to what's on the inside
[18:28] he's the one who tries the the heart he
[18:31] searches the heart he's the one who
[18:32] tries to Reigns and your Reigns like I
[18:34] said is your belly or your inward part
[18:36] which is the the seed of emotions and
[18:39] the scripture and God is that's where
[18:41] he's getting down to test that and try
[18:43] that amen and brother brim told us it's
[18:46] it's our motive and objective is what
[18:48] counts and we'll get to that in a minute
[18:49] and God is the one who can Pierce
[18:51] through whatever we put on the outside
[18:53] God can Pierce through all of that and
[18:55] get to what's actually going on on the
[18:57] inside
[18:58] let's go to Hebrews chapter 4.
[19:07] Hebrews chapter 4.
[19:13] we'll begin at verse 12 Hebrews chapter
[19:15] 4 and verse 12.
[19:19] for the word of God is quick and
[19:22] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[19:24] sword piercing even to the dividing
[19:26] asunder of Soul and Spirit and of joints
[19:28] and Morrow and is a discerner of the
[19:31] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[19:33] so the heart is desperately wicked who
[19:35] can know it the word is one that's
[19:37] Discerning the thoughts of the heart
[19:38] amen the discerner the thoughts and
[19:41] intents of the heart neither is there
[19:43] any creature that is not manifest in his
[19:45] sight but all things are naked and
[19:47] opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
[19:50] have to do
[19:52] amen it's amazing that that that
[19:55] the heart is deceptive the heart is
[19:58] desperately wicked he that trusteth in
[20:01] his own heart is a fool amen but God
[20:04] Amen by the word the word is sharper
[20:06] than a two-edged sword through the
[20:08] cutting asunder of the spirit and the
[20:10] soul and is a discerner of the thoughts
[20:12] and intents of the heart and I thank God
[20:14] that God sent a perfect word in this day
[20:17] because we I mean we were stuck in a
[20:19] hybrid condition by no fault of our own
[20:22] but by what happened in the Garden of
[20:23] Eden and it's trapped us into this Amen
[20:26] to this hybrid flesh that still has a
[20:29] sticky culk of her nature but there's a
[20:30] word here that's going to cut that away
[20:32] amen and it's going to discern what's
[20:35] going on on the inside
[20:37] [Music]
[20:38] sometimes we have a hard time Discerning
[20:40] ourselves
[20:42] I said before self-deception is the
[20:45] greatest deception
[20:46] because self-deception is why Lucifer
[20:49] fell by amen because of his own
[20:51] brightness he was lifted up he was
[20:53] exalted by his own brightness by his own
[20:55] wisdom by his own Grandeur amen and he
[20:57] suffered through that self-deception
[20:59] amen and sometimes we have a hard time
[21:01] Discerning ourselves but God has sent a
[21:03] word in this day amen that can cut
[21:05] through everything and search the hearts
[21:08] and try the Reigns
[21:11] amen
[21:14] it's amazing how
[21:16] just when you think you're safe
[21:19] just when you think you've arrived I've
[21:21] served God I've given him my whole life
[21:22] I've turned it on just when you think
[21:24] you're safe amen the word comes and it
[21:26] slices another layer off and you find
[21:28] there's still something laying there
[21:30] that needs to be surrendered
[21:32] amen there's still selfishness there's
[21:34] still self there's still Pride there's
[21:36] still things there's still complexes
[21:38] there's still things that came down
[21:39] through the family tree there's still
[21:41] things laying there but by the grace of
[21:43] God he'll bring the word that'll cut
[21:45] down deep enough to open that up amen so
[21:48] we can see ourselves there's something
[21:49] there that needs to go
[21:52] and that's the mercy and grace of God
[21:55] amen
[21:57] it's it's amazing I was thinking I was
[22:00] meditating on this thought of why we
[22:03] come to church you know why do we
[22:04] continually come to church we come to
[22:06] church Sunday we come to church
[22:08] Wednesday and many things are happening
[22:10] each time and then we're always learning
[22:12] something more about God God is using
[22:14] the preaching of the word and the
[22:16] assembling together to bring the
[22:18] atmosphere to give us greater Revelation
[22:21] to open himself to us in a greater way
[22:23] amen there's people who are coming to
[22:25] the Lord there are people who are
[22:26] growing in their walk with the Lord
[22:28] there's so many things that are
[22:29] happening amen but we come and and some
[22:32] of you have been have been serving the
[22:34] lord and coming to church and worshiping
[22:36] Amen in the message longer than I've
[22:39] been alive
[22:41] 50 years or more you've been studying
[22:44] this word and hearing the preaching and
[22:46] hearing the message and and you know the
[22:48] message amen you know what the prophet
[22:50] taught you know the ministry and life of
[22:52] the Prophet amen and it's amazing how
[22:54] God still continually opening things but
[22:56] it's not like you we have no
[22:58] understanding amen of what God has done
[23:00] in our day and why do we keep coming
[23:02] back and reading over the same
[23:04] scriptures and reading and listening to
[23:06] the same messages and reading the same
[23:07] Bible amen it's because God Amen is
[23:10] bringing us to a higher plane all the
[23:13] time by his word
[23:15] because he doesn't want us to stay where
[23:17] we were 20 30 40 years ago but we're
[23:20] constantly growing in the Lord we're
[23:22] coming into the statue of a perfect man
[23:24] to be the very reflection of Jesus
[23:26] Christ on this Earth
[23:30] praise God that's a tall order
[23:34] but that's why we continually come if
[23:37] you'll turn with me to Second Timothy 3.
[23:41] I just thought of this scripture just a
[23:44] few moments ago and I'd like to read it
[23:46] second Timothy
[23:51] chapter 3 verse 16.
[23:56] second Timothy 3 16 all scripture is
[23:59] given by inspiration of God and is
[24:01] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[24:04] correction for instruction and
[24:06] righteousness that the man of God may be
[24:09] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[24:10] good works God wants us to be perfect
[24:14] and thoroughly furnished and what's it
[24:16] going to take it's going to take the
[24:17] word it's going to take the scripture
[24:18] the word of God which is profitable for
[24:21] Doctrine that's teaching for reproof for
[24:24] correction for instruction and
[24:26] righteousness that's why we keep coming
[24:28] back to church
[24:31] when we begin to get the attitude as I
[24:33] know the message I I've been this I've
[24:35] been I believe the message for 20 years
[24:37] I believe the message for 30 years and
[24:39] and sometimes I mean we we sit in our
[24:42] seats as almost the preacher can't say
[24:44] anything I don't know
[24:45] because there's some pride there that
[24:47] comes I've been serving the lord I've
[24:49] read the message I know I have a
[24:50] revelation and and yeah we'll see what
[24:53] this one has to say
[24:58] the question is why did you come to
[25:00] church
[25:01] if that's the attitude
[25:04] amen amen
[25:05] and and sometimes we can come and if we
[25:08] don't hear the subjects we want to hear
[25:10] we just tune out
[25:12] I always say oh the going this is a
[25:14] basic thing this is not the Rev no
[25:17] sometimes the basic thing is the one
[25:18] that's tripping us up
[25:20] sometimes knowing how to love our
[25:22] brothers the thing that we're having
[25:23] problems with and we're so revelated we
[25:25] can't get along with
[25:29] but if it's not a certain if it doesn't
[25:32] have that certain flavor if it's not
[25:33] coming this certain Revelation if it's
[25:35] not what I think up to the
[25:39] I'm gonna tune out and I'm gonna say
[25:41] that that's a certain level preacher in
[25:43] my book
[25:45] oh my goodness maybe what we need is not
[25:48] to keep climbing up but maybe we need to
[25:50] go down
[25:52] maybe we need to Humble ourselves and
[25:54] say God I need your help amen because I
[25:57] can't trust myself I can't trust my own
[25:59] thinking I can't trust my own heart this
[26:01] heart Amen to the carnal part of me is
[26:03] deceitfully wicked
[26:05] I need your spirit amen to come and
[26:07] bring the word to discern where I'm at
[26:12] amen
[26:14] when we come to the message perfect
[26:16] strength by Perfect weakness
[26:18] the prophet of God says then Paul said
[26:20] when I am weak then I am strong as he
[26:23] said then I will glory in my infirmities
[26:25] of my weakness and so forth I'm thanking
[26:28] God that I got all of it out of me and
[26:31] when I get everything out of me then God
[26:33] can come in but as long as I got some of
[26:35] myself there then God can't get in
[26:38] see that see we smother him out we drive
[26:42] him away from the poorest of us to The
[26:44] Riches of from the least to the greatest
[26:46] we keep God out of our Lives because of
[26:49] our own selves
[26:51] because I've often said the greatest
[26:53] enemy I got is William Branham
[26:56] he's the one that gets in God's way he's
[26:59] the one that gets lazy he's the one that
[27:01] gets to a place sometimes where he
[27:03] thinks he can do something about it and
[27:05] when he does that shoves God right out
[27:08] of the picture
[27:09] amen this is the prophet of God saying
[27:11] this after all of his experience with
[27:13] the Lord and God using him for so many
[27:15] things he's still recognizing that the
[27:17] problem he's having is him and any
[27:19] problem he has is him and if he has too
[27:21] much of himself he's pushing God right
[27:23] out of the picture
[27:24] and when he gets to a place where he
[27:25] thinks he can do something amen if
[27:27] there's anybody that I think would have
[27:29] got to a place where they think they can
[27:31] do something about it to me it would be
[27:32] the prophet of God
[27:34] but even him that's when he's hindering
[27:37] God
[27:38] he realizes that but when I can get rid
[27:41] of that guy when I can get to a place
[27:43] that he's out of the way then God can
[27:45] come over and do things that William
[27:46] Branham knows nothing about that's when
[27:48] God can use you that's when he can use
[27:50] any of you he can use anybody when we
[27:53] get out of the way but as long as we've
[27:55] got ourselves in the way then we cannot
[27:59] amen let's go to back to Proverbs to
[28:01] proverbs 26.
[28:03] we're going to stay in Proverbs I
[28:05] believe for a little while
[28:21] Proverbs 26 and 12.
[28:25] he says see us thou a man wise in his
[28:28] own conceit there is more hope of a fool
[28:30] than of him
[28:33] this word conceit
[28:35] is I it can mean your physical eye are
[28:38] also your mental qualities your
[28:39] understanding what you see what you
[28:41] understand
[28:43] so
[28:44] you see a man wise in his own
[28:46] understanding in his own eye there's
[28:48] more hope of a fool than of him
[28:52] I said God help us as we grow in this
[28:56] revelation we never get to the place
[28:57] where we feel like we've got something
[28:59] under control we know something and now
[29:01] I know oh my goodness the Bible says
[29:04] amen if anybody thinks he knows
[29:06] something he knows nothing as he ought
[29:08] to
[29:09] that's the reality whatever it is we
[29:11] know by the grace of God he's allowed us
[29:13] to understand by revelation we still
[29:15] don't know any of those subjects like we
[29:17] ought to
[29:19] because there's so much more depth amen
[29:21] there's so much more how do we find the
[29:23] bottom of God how do you get to the end
[29:25] of God Amen this word is God Amen how do
[29:28] you you say I've got that Doctrine
[29:30] pinned down my goodness how are you ever
[29:32] going to have a Doctrine pin down if
[29:33] it's a teaching about God it goes on and
[29:35] on and on and it gets deeper and deeper
[29:38] and deeper amen and sometimes when we
[29:40] feel like we've got it and we've nailed
[29:41] it and I've got that one let's move to
[29:43] the next one amen we're going to miss
[29:45] opportunities to go deeper
[29:47] [Music]
[29:48] amen
[29:50] so we're not
[29:52] that's that's a danger in human beings
[29:54] and I say we all suffer from that some
[29:57] of us more than others because that
[29:59] Pride was injected into the human race
[30:01] at the fall amen the very pride of Satan
[30:03] came through and we find it in Cain amen
[30:06] and brother bear said where did Cain get
[30:07] that he didn't get it from Adam he
[30:09] didn't get amen every seed brings forth
[30:11] after its kind that was an Adam that
[30:13] came from somewhere else from another
[30:15] source and Satan found a way to inject
[30:17] himself into the human race through the
[30:19] serpent
[30:21] and that Pride got injected in and now
[30:23] all of us are struggling with this pride
[30:25] and in better it's better off just to
[30:27] recognize it and say you know what I'm a
[30:29] failure to begin with I mean this old
[30:31] sticky conquer where nature is going to
[30:33] lead me awry I need God to lead me or
[30:36] else I'm going to go astray
[30:39] my own understanding my own thinking my
[30:41] own feeling my own emotions will my own
[30:44] emotions will deceive me
[30:49] my own thoughts my own inclinations my
[30:52] own inspirations
[30:54] will deceive me
[30:57] amen you know that still as we walk
[31:01] in this Earth today being born again and
[31:03] full of the Holy Ghost you haven't been
[31:05] able to completely shed that old sticky
[31:07] over nature
[31:10] and you catch Inspirations from God
[31:13] and you catch Inspirations that are your
[31:16] own
[31:18] and if you make every inspiration you
[31:21] catch from God you're going to wind up
[31:23] bankrupt and down a dead end Road
[31:25] someday
[31:27] it's better for us just not to trust
[31:28] ourselves and say God I need you to
[31:30] really show me
[31:32] I don't even trust my own inclinations I
[31:34] don't even trust my own feelings my own
[31:37] emotions sometimes have led me the wrong
[31:39] way God I if this is you I need you to
[31:41] confirm it by something other than just
[31:43] me amen because I don't trust me
[31:46] is maybe you leading me and I trust that
[31:48] you've led me this way before but oh God
[31:50] would you confirm amen show me because I
[31:53] don't trust my own thinking my own
[31:55] emotions my own Revelations my own
[31:57] inclinations
[32:00] man
[32:01] it makes me nervous when I see somebody
[32:04] so confident so spiritually
[32:06] self-confident and so bold and all their
[32:09] intuitions and all their feelings it
[32:11] scares me to death
[32:13] and maybe that's more spiritual than me
[32:15] but I've never been able to come to the
[32:17] place where I can say
[32:18] that I always know what to do
[32:22] most of the time I have no clue
[32:24] and God Rescues Me
[32:26] that's generally what happens to me I
[32:29] have no clue what's going on I have no
[32:31] clue the right decision I have no clue
[32:32] how to solve this problem and somehow
[32:34] God works it all out and Rescues Me
[32:37] that's generally what happens for me
[32:41] and the message proving its word
[32:43] he says
[32:44] now to heal I cannot you know that what
[32:47] is a gift brother Branham something that
[32:49] you take no it's something you know how
[32:51] to get yourself out of the way
[32:54] as long as you're there it'll never work
[32:56] William Branham is the greatest enemy I
[32:58] got but when I get him out of the way
[33:00] see then Jesus Christ can use the body
[33:03] brother Branham had enough confidence in
[33:06] the gift that God gave him and the
[33:07] commission that God gave him an angel
[33:09] that he would stand before thousands
[33:11] amen and he would call meetings and he
[33:13] would plan meetings and he would rent
[33:15] tents and he had enough confidence in
[33:17] what God told him Amen to do that he
[33:20] would stand there amen but once he got
[33:22] there he had no confidence in himself he
[33:24] was waiting for the angel of the Lord to
[33:26] show up because he said you know I can't
[33:28] do anything until he comes
[33:31] so it wasn't self-confidence it was
[33:33] confidence in God's commission but he
[33:35] still was helpless without God
[33:38] his gift wasn't something he could just
[33:40] take and operate his gift he said the
[33:43] gift I got is to get myself out of the
[33:45] way that's the gift I have to pull
[33:47] myself into another gear where I relax
[33:49] myself then he comes on the scene and he
[33:51] begins to operate
[33:53] praise God
[33:55] so when he learned if he can get himself
[33:57] out of the way he's the greatest enemy
[34:00] he's the hindrance
[34:03] let's look at Proverbs chapter 3.
[34:15] Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5.
[34:21] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[34:23] and lean not unto thine own
[34:24] understanding and all thy ways
[34:27] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[34:30] path
[34:31] amen the Bible's so clear on this we
[34:34] have so much instruction that we're not
[34:36] to trust our own understanding our own
[34:39] thinking our own feeling
[34:41] but oh I thank God that that we've
[34:43] received a word in this day and that
[34:45] word is continually going forth amen and
[34:47] as we go back and read the same
[34:49] scriptures we read before amen and we
[34:52] listen to the same tapes we LED before
[34:53] and we come to the service after service
[34:56] just like we did before that God is
[34:58] constantly peeling away a layer of my
[35:00] heart and showing me you've got to get
[35:02] rid of this you've got to surrender that
[35:04] amen this isn't right
[35:07] I'm glad he didn't leave me alone a few
[35:09] years ago when I thought I had arrived I
[35:10] got the Revelation I'm glad he didn't
[35:12] stop working on me then but I'm glad I
[35:14] kept coming into his presence and coming
[35:16] back to the word so he can keep cutting
[35:18] more away
[35:20] amen
[35:23] I'm saying God hiding himself in
[35:24] Simplicity says so it's pleases God to
[35:27] reveal himself and then hide himself
[35:29] then hide himself and reveal himself in
[35:31] simple little things it's put over the
[35:34] top of the head of man because if you
[35:35] say why would I adjust God do that is
[35:37] because that man was made up in the
[35:40] beginning not to try to shift for
[35:41] himself
[35:42] a man was made to rely completely upon
[35:45] God that's the reason we're liking to
[35:47] the Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead
[35:49] himself he has to have a leader and the
[35:52] holy spirit's supposed to lead us
[35:54] amen we're not supposed listen I'll just
[35:58] say it this way we're not supposed to
[35:59] have it figured out
[36:01] sometimes we feel like we've come to a
[36:03] position in the revelation of the word
[36:05] we have the message and we're the bride
[36:06] of Christ as if we're supposed to now be
[36:09] all-knowing and all understanding and
[36:10] have everything figured out to be the
[36:12] bride known to be the bride of Christ
[36:14] means that I am surrendered to the
[36:15] headship of my husband I'm his wife I'm
[36:18] his bride and I'm a submissive wife
[36:20] surrendered to him he's the lead he's
[36:22] the one that knows I don't know
[36:24] he's leading he knows what comes next I
[36:27] have no idea amen so to be a bride to be
[36:30] a good bride is not to know everything
[36:32] to be a good bride is to be fully
[36:34] surrendered to the headship of Christ
[36:36] the word
[36:39] I felt the pressure so many times in my
[36:41] own life to have all the answers and to
[36:43] know everything and to be able to
[36:47] so funny
[36:48] I would feel so much pressure and even
[36:51] as a pastor in the past I and a minister
[36:53] I felt pressured to have all the answers
[36:55] like I have to have all the answers and
[36:57] and so I have to come and massage some
[37:00] spiritual type
[37:01] and I have to make it fit
[37:04] and I have to have an answer and I've
[37:06] got to say something
[37:07] sometimes the very best thing we can say
[37:09] is I have no idea brother
[37:11] I'm as clueless as you are
[37:14] if God doesn't come and show us we'll
[37:16] never know
[37:19] to have to have all the answers and to
[37:21] be a know-it-all and always know what's
[37:23] best and what somebody should have done
[37:24] and the church should have done that he
[37:26] should have made this decision and I
[37:27] don't agree with that and we ought to do
[37:29] this and they ought to do that and I
[37:31] that's a trap friends
[37:33] that's a pride trap amen and that Pride
[37:37] trap has caused so much destruction all
[37:40] around us
[37:41] in our own lives and the lives of others
[37:43] when we get caught in that Pride trap
[37:45] it's so much better to say I don't know
[37:47] all I know to do is put my hand in his
[37:49] and say God you've got to lead me on the
[37:51] way because there's things coming I
[37:53] don't have the answers to I know the
[37:54] answers in the Bible I know it's in the
[37:56] message but I don't have it in my own
[37:58] thinking I don't know how to put the
[38:00] pieces together
[38:02] I need you to do it Lord
[38:07] so man was made to rely completely upon
[38:10] God if man was made to rely completely
[38:12] on God then maybe God will allow us to
[38:15] get into situations where we don't know
[38:17] the answer so that we can rely
[38:18] completely on him
[38:19] [Music]
[38:20] maybe that's what God intended that
[38:22] we're not supposed to shift for
[38:23] ourselves so that that God Amen and God
[38:26] has not uh given us okay I'll give you
[38:29] all the word now you figure it out from
[38:31] here that's not the plan man was never
[38:33] intended to shift for himself amen he
[38:35] was supposed to rely completely on God
[38:39] amen and so if that's the case then we
[38:41] ought not to get surprised when we run
[38:43] into obstacles we don't have the answers
[38:45] for
[38:46] when we Face things we haven't faced
[38:48] before when when it's not obvious what
[38:50] the solution should be
[38:52] amen
[38:55] I always think it's funny when people
[38:57] know what everybody else around them
[38:59] should be doing
[39:02] well they shouldn't do that and they
[39:04] should do this and that's wrong and the
[39:06] brother Bram says and
[39:10] listen I ain't got a clue what I'm doing
[39:13] I'm just walking with God day by day and
[39:16] asking him to show me
[39:18] I ain't got a clue I've come to the
[39:19] place where everything I thought would
[39:21] happen didn't happen the things I
[39:22] thought would never happen or the things
[39:24] that happened the way this situation I
[39:26] thought was going to resolve it resolve
[39:27] something completely I've come to the
[39:29] place where I just throw my hands in the
[39:30] air and say God you're in charge
[39:32] I don't know but I know this word is
[39:34] true and holds the answer and you will
[39:36] always give us an answer by Your Word
[39:39] you will always lead by your spirit your
[39:41] spirit will always lead by the word and
[39:43] I can't think of it now but there's a
[39:45] solution here somewhere
[39:47] amen
[39:49] brother random there's a an interesting
[39:52] thing that I found as I was reading
[39:53] through the message humbled myself
[39:55] and and I was studying in this message
[39:58] it's just a little short message brother
[39:59] bam just gets up and he's making some
[40:01] opening comments and he's making
[40:03] comments before brother Lee Vale
[40:04] preaches then brother levale preaches
[40:06] and then it's got Brothers comes up at
[40:07] the end and he makes a few more comments
[40:09] and it's only I don't remember how long
[40:11] it is it's not very long and I just went
[40:13] to that there's a quote that I
[40:15] remembered in the message humble myself
[40:16] so I went to that quote and I just
[40:18] decided to read the whole message and
[40:20] all of a sudden it really began to touch
[40:21] me and and move me and I found this in
[40:24] here that I thought was very interesting
[40:26] brother Ben says because since I've been
[40:29] home I've told you about the visions and
[40:31] what's happened and everything and I
[40:33] brought it right up why I've done all
[40:35] these things and then this morning
[40:37] bringing it right up now to that last
[40:39] pool
[40:40] coming to the third pool so now it's my
[40:43] time for consecration to God
[40:46] 's time to speak to me
[40:48] I'm I must just have a little change in
[40:52] my own life
[40:54] not as that that I think I'm wicked I
[40:56] want to feel a little more closer to the
[40:58] people
[41:00] brother remember comes and this is after
[41:01] he preached standing in the Gap this is
[41:03] about three weeks after he preaches
[41:04] standing in the Gap and we'll read a
[41:06] quote out of that but brother branham's
[41:08] coming to the third pool and here he is
[41:10] after the opening of the seals he's here
[41:12] and this is the end of June June 23rd
[41:15] that he's preaching humble thyself and
[41:17] and a couple weeks later he's going to
[41:18] preach standing in the gap and and he's
[41:21] he's at this place
[41:23] coming to the third pool Ministry the
[41:25] ministry of the third pool and brother
[41:28] Branham doesn't feel like he's arrived
[41:30] because he's come to the third pool he
[41:32] feels like he needs another change in
[41:34] his life
[41:38] I I must just have a little change in my
[41:41] life
[41:42] not as that I think I'm wicked
[41:45] I want to feel a little more closer to
[41:47] the people
[41:50] my brother REM comes to this after the
[41:52] preaching of the seals after all of that
[41:55] he knows that something in him has to
[41:58] change
[41:59] he's got to have a feeling for the
[42:01] people there's got to be some there's
[42:03] got to be a victory in Divine love
[42:07] I think that's amazing that touched me
[42:09] in a way
[42:10] because when have we arrived
[42:15] I still need something to change in me
[42:17] yes
[42:18] I need a little change not that I think
[42:20] I'm wicked
[42:22] but I need more
[42:24] and I don't ever want to strive for more
[42:26] of him I don't want to stop striving for
[42:28] more of him I don't ever want to get in
[42:30] that relaxed State the minute you start
[42:32] to relax you start the backslide
[42:34] that's what happened to Ephesus they
[42:36] aimed at and relaxed I don't ever want
[42:38] to get into that relaxing where I stop
[42:40] striving to to be to emulate Christ in
[42:43] every way Amen to be a reflection of him
[42:46] in every way and to constantly go to him
[42:48] and open my heart and say God would you
[42:50] take the sword of your word and would
[42:52] you divide asunder soul in spirit and be
[42:55] a discerner the thoughts and intents of
[42:56] my heart amen because I don't even
[42:58] sometimes know what's wrong with me I
[43:00] don't even know sometimes what I'm
[43:02] struggling with
[43:04] but I need you to come and open it up
[43:06] amen and discern my own heart amen so
[43:09] that I could surrender to you in a
[43:11] greater way
[43:13] and somebody say to me one time amen
[43:15] we're always taught to die and to
[43:17] surrender and die and surrenders and
[43:18] sometimes you don't know what to die out
[43:20] too sometimes you don't know what to
[43:22] surrender because you don't know what
[43:23] the problem is
[43:26] amen how many believe we all have some
[43:28] sort of complexes or family heritage or
[43:31] and sometimes we have no clue what they
[43:34] are
[43:35] I'll raise my hand and say I've got
[43:36] complexes but ask me what they are I
[43:38] don't know my wife could probably tell
[43:39] you that my friends could probably tell
[43:41] you better than I could tell me
[43:44] is that right we could look around and
[43:47] we can all begin to if we all had a
[43:49] conversation we could all begin to
[43:50] diagnose each other's complexes or
[43:52] family traits or
[43:55] but when it comes to our own
[43:58] that's when we begin to stumble and say
[44:00] I know I'm struggling I know I don't see
[44:02] everything right but I don't know how to
[44:04] make myself see right
[44:06] I know that sometimes my perspective is
[44:08] wrong and sometimes I jump to
[44:10] conclusions and I know but but I don't
[44:13] know my way around it I need God to come
[44:16] and buy the word open me up and expose
[44:18] me brother bear said we don't come to
[44:20] church to see our good parts we come to
[44:22] see our bad parts because that's what
[44:25] we're blind to we need somebody in the
[44:27] Pulpit with a gift that God can pick up
[44:29] and use and wield that sword and begin
[44:31] to do a heart surgery and say listen
[44:33] look here there's something laying there
[44:36] and it laid there from Grandma and
[44:38] Grandpa and God can deliver it but but
[44:40] we need to ask for deliverance we need
[44:43] to understand we need to cry out and say
[44:45] God I need this Pride gone I need this
[44:47] gone I need this going on in my life
[44:51] amen
[44:54] and brother man I'm coming through the
[44:56] third pool after the opening of the
[44:58] seals the final stage of his ministry
[45:01] he needs a change
[45:05] a change in him
[45:07] to go into the final stage of the
[45:09] ministry
[45:11] and if the bride is the final stage of
[45:14] Christ's Ministry on Earth
[45:16] and we're coming to the final days of
[45:18] the final Ministry I think we need a
[45:20] change in US
[45:22] I think we continually need a change in
[45:24] us to come to Perfection amen and I want
[45:27] to be open to that always
[45:32] how am I going to be open to that
[45:35] by first recognizing that if I trust in
[45:37] my own heart I'm a fool
[45:39] and if I lean on my own understanding
[45:41] I'm going to fall in air and if I think
[45:43] I know something I better take heed when
[45:46] I think I stand lest I fall
[45:49] now the the best thing for me to do amen
[45:53] as a child of God is learn not to trust
[45:55] myself
[45:59] and then we'll be okay
[46:03] and the message standing in the Gap this
[46:04] is the one that brother brother Branham
[46:06] comes and preaches
[46:08] a couple weeks oh I'm sorry I had that
[46:11] backwards humble thyself is July 14th
[46:14] standing in the Gap came first June 23rd
[46:17] and he says
[46:19] and the message standing in the Gap
[46:22] Moses lost the feeling of his people
[46:24] because they wouldn't listen to him
[46:27] and brother Rory you see your dream and
[46:29] now I cannot go with a Ministry like
[46:31] that until I feel different in my heart
[46:33] about it no matter what if God did tell
[46:36] me
[46:39] even if God told me to go God told him
[46:41] you go back to the people you've you've
[46:43] left the sick people lay he told him to
[46:45] go back you've got more gifts than that
[46:47] you go to the people he said I can't go
[46:49] even if God did tell me until something
[46:52] in me changes
[46:56] until I feel different in my heart about
[46:58] it no matter if God did tell me but that
[47:01] is that change that brother Roy that
[47:04] scene coming what did Brother Royce he's
[47:06] seen a dream and at the dream brother
[47:07] Brennan was at the end of the table and
[47:09] they were all sitting there and brother
[47:10] Brandon was picked up and he whisked
[47:12] away amen and brother Roy was crying
[47:14] brother Brown come back come back and a
[47:16] little bit later he comes back when he
[47:18] but when he comes back he looks like
[47:20] Moses he's got a white beard he's got a
[47:22] white white hair or however it is he's
[47:24] glowing and he looks like Moses and
[47:25] brother branham's saying this is that
[47:27] change Moses had lost a feeling for his
[47:29] people he had run away from his
[47:31] commission amen because he was rejected
[47:33] and he had run Amen to the Wilderness
[47:35] and hung out there but he came back amen
[47:37] God in a meeting of a pillar of fire and
[47:39] brought him back brother Branham went
[47:41] out west and he come back and now he's
[47:43] saying I need a change
[47:45] in me
[47:47] that's the change that you're seeing
[47:48] brother Roy it wasn't to change listen
[47:51] it wasn't that change to some super
[47:53] powerful now I'm going to start this and
[47:55] that and that
[47:57] not a big platform show not a big
[48:00] something that would Elevate man what
[48:02] the change he needed was something in
[48:04] his heart had to change
[48:08] and I ask you why did Brother Branham
[48:11] take rejection so hard
[48:13] because of his childhood
[48:15] because of the things that he suffered
[48:17] all through life he had a complex he had
[48:19] he had things and he tells us in
[48:21] standing in the Gap I built myself a
[48:23] complex
[48:24] because the people wouldn't hear me
[48:27] I love that term built myself a complex
[48:29] because you can't blame anybody else for
[48:31] it
[48:32] it's like Devil the devil hands you the
[48:34] bricks and you're the one stacking them
[48:36] and he brings this negative thought and
[48:38] you stack it in this negative thought
[48:39] and you stack it and the devil's handing
[48:41] you all these negative thoughts and
[48:43] you're building yourself a complex which
[48:45] is a wall that separates you from
[48:47] brethren
[48:50] but remember I said I built myself a
[48:52] complex
[48:53] because the devil sold a negative
[48:54] thought
[48:56] brother Branham had these negative
[48:58] thoughts about they didn't hear me I
[48:59] thought they ought to have heard me and
[49:01] they rejected the message and didn't
[49:02] hear the message and now he says I built
[49:04] myself a complex and we do the same
[49:07] thing friends the devil hands us
[49:08] negative thoughts about the way somebody
[49:10] treated us or away a situation unfolded
[49:13] or away somebody handled something amen
[49:15] we begin to stick these things here and
[49:17] accomplish the next thing though we're
[49:18] walled off
[49:22] and we think the problems with everybody
[49:24] else
[49:25] that church that Ministry that family
[49:28] that family member that
[49:31] but they're not the ones who built the
[49:33] wall
[49:34] we are
[49:38] we sit inside our wall all bricked in
[49:41] and separated from fellowship and and
[49:43] licking our wounds and sucking our sores
[49:45] and blaming everybody else for this wall
[49:48] That's separating us
[49:54] and we think we're right
[49:59] say God forgive me
[50:03] knock down this wall that I built this
[50:06] thing that's separating me from
[50:07] fellowship this thing that's hurting me
[50:09] and we're the ones who hurt the most
[50:13] we suffer by our own efforts to save
[50:16] ourselves we destroy ourselves
[50:18] our own efforts to protect our heart
[50:20] from any more damage is the very thing
[50:22] that destroys our heart because we pull
[50:24] away from the fellowship that God wants
[50:26] to use to heal us
[50:29] I say God help me
[50:31] forgive me
[50:33] amen knocked These Bricks out of the way
[50:35] all these negative lies of the devil all
[50:38] the wrong seed that was sown in my mind
[50:40] and I allowed it to stay God forgive me
[50:43] of that and knock it all away and help
[50:45] me to have a softer feeling in my heart
[50:47] towards others
[50:50] this is what he says
[50:52] I will repeat that last phrase until I
[50:55] feel different in my heart about it no
[50:56] matter if God did tell me but that is
[50:58] the change brother Roy that scene coming
[51:00] something's got to change me
[51:04] because I in my heart if I go out there
[51:06] feeling the way I do now I still feel
[51:08] that they ought to have heard the
[51:10] message they ought to have done it and I
[51:12] don't have the feeling for the people
[51:13] that I should have until I get that
[51:16] feeling there is no need in me going
[51:18] because I'd be a hypocrite
[51:21] my goodness brother Branham when he's
[51:23] coming with a perfect interpretation of
[51:26] the word a perfect Revelation and
[51:27] brother Branham at this point had
[51:29] Revelation he hadn't even shared yet he
[51:31] had things God told him he felt to stop
[51:33] not saying anymore he understood what
[51:36] the third pull was he knew what the
[51:38] seventh seal was he knew what all the
[51:40] seals were he knew the day and hour he
[51:42] knew all of this he had this great
[51:43] Revelation and what he needed was not
[51:46] was not more Revelation what he needed
[51:48] was for him to change so that he can
[51:49] Manifest this revelation
[51:52] so they can move into this final stage
[51:54] of the ministry he was going to take a
[51:55] change in him and the change in him was
[51:57] not going to be Pride it wasn't going to
[51:59] be arrogancy it was going to be a
[52:00] haughty Spirit it wasn't going to be a
[52:02] know-it-all the change in him was going
[52:04] to be a greater feeling for the people
[52:05] he was moving into the Capstone of
[52:07] perfect love that's the change that he
[52:09] needed
[52:12] and what change do we need we don't need
[52:14] to have the answers for everything we
[52:15] don't need to cut everybody's legs out
[52:17] from under them when they don't
[52:18] understand the message or they disagree
[52:19] we don't need debate we don't need all
[52:22] of this nonsense what we need is a more
[52:24] Divine love perfect love working in us
[52:26] we need something to change us
[52:29] so that we can move into this final
[52:31] stage of the ministry
[52:33] it's not going to be had knowledge that
[52:35] does it is not going to be we understand
[52:37] it all and nobody can stand against the
[52:39] Bible Understanding that we have my
[52:41] goodness
[52:42] what we need is to project love
[52:46] because when love projects Sovereign
[52:48] Grace takes its place
[52:52] we need some things got to change me
[52:56] God changed me
[52:58] I thought that was so amazing when he
[53:00] recognizes coming to the third pool he's
[53:02] got to have the change
[53:08] now when we moved further down and to
[53:10] Humble thyself
[53:12] it's amazing the things that he says and
[53:14] I'm going to pull several excerpts from
[53:16] there quite a few
[53:18] he says don't forgive
[53:20] this Tabernacle will lose its strength
[53:23] remember that this is the target where
[53:25] Satan has got every gun and Hell trained
[53:27] on it
[53:28] he'll cause one person to do something
[53:30] that's contrary to what the other one
[53:32] thinks
[53:34] he didn't say they did something wrong
[53:36] he said they did something contrary to
[53:38] what the other one thinks
[53:43] I'm surprised at how many times this is
[53:45] the problem
[53:46] not sin just somebody did something
[53:48] contrary to what another person thinks
[53:49] and it creates a great disruption
[53:52] because we all think we're right
[53:55] uh
[53:57] I'm sorry to burst your bubble
[53:59] but we all think we're right
[54:01] we all think we have good perspective we
[54:04] all think we have good discernment we
[54:05] all think we're a good judge of what we
[54:07] see
[54:09] all of us
[54:11] and we all think that we understand
[54:13] what's going on by the Limited
[54:15] information we have
[54:18] many times we're looking at a situation
[54:20] through a people and say yep that's it I
[54:22] got it that's what the word says if they
[54:24] would just listen to the prophet
[54:28] and we really think we know the answer
[54:33] the Bible says he that judges the matter
[54:35] before he heareth it
[54:37] is foolishness
[54:42] I think what we need to do is just stop
[54:44] being know-it-alls
[54:48] just stop trusting in our own
[54:50] understanding and stop being super
[54:52] spiritual
[54:53] stop having everything figured out and
[54:55] leave everybody alone and let God lead
[54:57] and if something's wrong go to that
[54:59] person and find out
[55:01] because many times you'll find you
[55:03] didn't have all the information
[55:06] you misunderstood
[55:09] instead of just lobbing arrows
[55:12] why don't we just stop that
[55:15] and say you know what it doesn't look
[55:17] good to me but I don't understand there
[55:19] must be more to it because that's a good
[55:20] brother
[55:22] that's a good sister that's a good
[55:24] family that's a good Minister that's a
[55:26] good church that's my brother I don't
[55:28] understand why they're doing what
[55:29] they're doing but there must be an
[55:31] explanation
[55:33] and what I see I don't agree with but
[55:35] there must be more to it why don't we
[55:37] give each other the benefit of the doubt
[55:38] why do we always jump to the negative
[55:40] conclusion why can't we start defending
[55:42] one another and say hey there's probably
[55:44] more to the story than we understand
[55:48] those are good people those are my
[55:49] brothers and sisters I'm sure there's a
[55:51] reason
[55:53] let's not constantly
[55:55] constantly reinforce the negative let's
[55:58] take it the other way
[56:02] he says he'll cause one person to do
[56:04] something that's contrary to what the
[56:06] other one thinks
[56:07] he is doing that he is up to it that's
[56:10] his business
[56:12] if he can get somebody to say something
[56:14] somebody to talk about another say well
[56:16] listen did you know so and so did don't
[56:18] you listen to it
[56:20] don't you listen to it at all that's the
[56:22] devil see it Satan don't you believe it
[56:25] if there is anything that somebody has
[56:28] done wrong pray for them
[56:31] and don't pray in a selfish way and say
[56:34] I know it's my duty I've got to pray for
[56:36] that brother
[56:37] you know you can pray for a brother with
[56:39] a haughty spirit
[56:43] God that poor brother he don't know what
[56:45] he's doing and I can see it and I mean
[56:48] we don't say it exactly like that but
[56:49] that's the very attitude we go to prayer
[56:51] with
[56:52] we go to the attitude we're here and our
[56:54] brothers down here and we're praying
[56:56] down for him to God help this poor
[56:58] ignorant brother who doesn't know
[56:59] anything
[57:03] you know God hates a proud heart
[57:06] it's an Abomination to God a proud
[57:10] amen how do we pray we get down
[57:13] underneath and begin to lift a brother
[57:16] or sister
[57:18] this is what he says
[57:21] he says don't pray in a selfish way say
[57:24] I know it's my duty I've got to pray for
[57:26] that brother like you're God's gift to
[57:28] that brother and somehow your prayers
[57:30] are rocking heaven for the brother
[57:31] because he can't pray for himself that's
[57:33] the attitude we go to prayer with
[57:34] sometimes
[57:37] once I prayed for him everything changed
[57:44] but that's exactly what we do
[57:48] it's exactly what we do
[57:53] I mean when we're when we're praying for
[57:55] somebody to get healed and they died we
[57:56] don't say anything but we're praying for
[57:57] somebody to get healed and they they're
[57:59] they're miraculously saved and delivered
[58:01] you say I was praying for them
[58:04] I want my name attached to the success
[58:06] of my
[58:10] but when the situation turned they died
[58:11] you don't say nothing about I spent
[58:13] hours praying for them and
[58:18] Hey listen we're all plagued with this
[58:20] thing
[58:21] we all need to be free from this
[58:27] amen
[58:29] Paul was able to say I have watered
[58:32] Apollos I planted Apollos water but God
[58:34] gets the increase
[58:37] amen
[58:39] so
[58:40] he goes on to say
[58:44] he Sid
[58:47] you take it in your heart when you go to
[58:49] pray take it in your heart really down
[58:51] for that sister and just talk and be
[58:54] real sweet and the first thing you know
[58:56] you find them right back in the service
[58:58] again
[59:00] because after all we're headed toward
[59:02] the setting of the Sun
[59:04] where are we going we're going to the
[59:06] finish line but we're going to go
[59:07] together friends
[59:09] we're going to go loving each other
[59:10] supporting each other having a feeling
[59:12] for one another amen really laboring for
[59:15] one another defending one another
[59:16] standing up for one another not cutting
[59:19] one another and misjudging one another
[59:21] and being suspicious of one another
[59:25] amen
[59:28] so this is the instruction that he's
[59:31] given to church
[59:32] he goes on down further and humble
[59:35] thyself he says now we look at this
[59:37] watch to find out what time it is unless
[59:39] that every instrument in that watch is
[59:41] coordinated one with the other will
[59:43] never know the correct time is that
[59:44] right
[59:45] and that takes all of us all together if
[59:48] we want to see their third pool really
[59:50] do something for God now brother Branham
[59:52] takes this and humbled himself he's
[59:55] talking about praying for a brother and
[59:56] sister and not having a haughty spirit
[59:58] and all these things and he's taking it
[59:59] he's tying it to the manifestation of
[1:00:01] the third pool
[1:00:03] that we're not going to have this
[1:00:04] manifestation until we get to this place
[1:00:06] till we all are coordinated and all of
[1:00:09] us are doing our part and every part is
[1:00:11] in its place and there's Harmony in
[1:00:13] unity he says it's going to take that
[1:00:14] for the third pool really to do
[1:00:16] something for God
[1:00:18] amen so listen we're not going to do it
[1:00:20] by ourselves no matter how much we think
[1:00:22] we're the greatest thing that that ever
[1:00:23] happened to the Earth
[1:00:25] and we're the greatest believer in the
[1:00:27] church amen nothing's going to happen
[1:00:28] without all of us
[1:00:34] amen it's going to take all of us all
[1:00:37] together we want to see the third pool
[1:00:38] really do something for God it's
[1:00:40] coordination with every one of us
[1:00:42] together to Humble ourselves before God
[1:00:44] and confess our wrong and pray and
[1:00:46] believe God for these things
[1:00:49] praise God
[1:00:51] further down he says you know people
[1:00:53] want Power
[1:00:55] and really they don't know what power is
[1:00:58] they don't really know what goes with it
[1:01:01] the Way Up Is Down always if you want
[1:01:03] Power see how humble you can get just
[1:01:06] get away from all your worldly thinking
[1:01:08] and humble yourself before God and then
[1:01:10] you've got more power than the man that
[1:01:11] runs all over the building and makes a
[1:01:13] big lot of noise see because you have
[1:01:15] been able to conquer yourself
[1:01:18] and commit yourself to Christ you see
[1:01:20] the humble yourself before him that's
[1:01:23] real power
[1:01:25] amen real power is not noise real power
[1:01:28] is not demonstration real power is not a
[1:01:30] show but real power is being able to
[1:01:32] conquer yourself
[1:01:34] because brother man said the greatest
[1:01:36] enemy I got it's William Branham well
[1:01:37] the greatest enemy I God's Chad Lamb
[1:01:40] amen and what what happens if I conquer
[1:01:43] everything else around me but this guy's
[1:01:44] the one deceiving me and tripping me up
[1:01:46] and building complexes and causing me to
[1:01:49] make wrong decisions and misjudge
[1:01:51] circumstances and
[1:01:54] oh we prayed for this one and they were
[1:01:56] healed well that's wonderful we love
[1:01:57] that amen but who's going to save me
[1:01:59] from myself
[1:02:01] I need God for me I need to humble
[1:02:03] myself and I need God Amen to take his
[1:02:05] word and slice and open and and reveal
[1:02:08] and and Purge and do all the things that
[1:02:11] I need him to do for me
[1:02:16] we could walk in Pride and see God use
[1:02:18] gifts and see God use us and and all the
[1:02:21] things that he's used us for and walk in
[1:02:23] Pride and not realize we're corrupting
[1:02:25] ourselves
[1:02:27] but so proud about being a good
[1:02:29] Christian and we're corrupting ourselves
[1:02:30] and sowing negative seed all around us I
[1:02:33] say God help us help us to stay humble
[1:02:35] Lord like your Prophet told us to stay
[1:02:37] humble like your word tells us to stay
[1:02:39] humble let's humble ourselves
[1:02:46] he goes on to say you show me a church
[1:02:49] that's humble real humble not an
[1:02:53] arrogancy a church just sweet Humble
[1:02:55] Church I'll show you a church that has
[1:02:57] the favor and power of God in it that's
[1:02:59] right that's the thing it takes humility
[1:03:01] humbling ourselves before God letting
[1:03:03] God just work through us don't have to
[1:03:05] make a lot of noise
[1:03:07] amen when I read this this is what I
[1:03:10] want with all my heart
[1:03:12] this is what I want I need God's help I
[1:03:15] need the spirit of God to lead me into
[1:03:16] this but this is what I want with all of
[1:03:18] my heart
[1:03:19] because with this with the right humble
[1:03:22] attitude and the right humble Spirit
[1:03:23] anything is possible God can do
[1:03:26] absolutely anything when he has full
[1:03:28] control and we're not we're not
[1:03:30] handicapping his efforts by our own
[1:03:32] Pride our own arrogancy but when we come
[1:03:35] into subjection and real humility and
[1:03:37] surrender to him then he's the great one
[1:03:40] he's the preeminent one he's everything
[1:03:42] and we realize we're nothing when we
[1:03:45] come to that place then absolutely
[1:03:47] anything is possible and anything he
[1:03:49] does Amen will be him getting all the
[1:03:51] credit because we know that we can't do
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:55] so when the prophet of God could come in
[1:03:57] the end of his ministry say I'm not the
[1:03:59] one that was
[1:04:00] there that day I was just standing near
[1:04:02] him I wasn't the one who came down on
[1:04:04] the river I wasn't the one who said
[1:04:05] those things I wasn't the one who did
[1:04:06] those things I was just standing near
[1:04:08] when he did that
[1:04:11] oh God I want to be standing near when
[1:04:14] you do those things too
[1:04:20] help me God
[1:04:22] and the message the influence of another
[1:04:24] he says put God before you and you'll
[1:04:26] have reverence for God and respect for
[1:04:28] him
[1:04:29] that's right
[1:04:30] now he goes and he starts speaking of
[1:04:32] the cherubims that we're worshiping when
[1:04:34] Isaiah saw him high and lifted up he
[1:04:36] said two Wings he covered his face two
[1:04:38] wings that means reverence reverence
[1:04:40] before God bowing covering his face now
[1:04:42] we don't have any Wings to cover our
[1:04:44] face we bow our head at his feet bow our
[1:04:46] heads and pray in reverence respects yes
[1:04:48] sir
[1:04:49] recognize it the two Wings he covered
[1:04:51] his feet his feet covered his feet
[1:04:53] represents humility and respect
[1:04:57] hear the very
[1:04:59] angels in heaven brother member said
[1:05:01] that we're pure and never sinned the day
[1:05:03] in their life
[1:05:06] amen but they would cover their face in
[1:05:09] reverence and respect to God and they
[1:05:10] recover their feet in humility
[1:05:13] in the presence of God
[1:05:17] listen he says Moses and the respects of
[1:05:20] God telling him he was on Holy Ground he
[1:05:21] took his shoes took off his shoes he
[1:05:24] done something to his feet Paul and
[1:05:26] respect the god reverence when the angel
[1:05:27] of the Lord came before him the pillar
[1:05:29] of fire he fell on the ground on his
[1:05:30] face respects John the Baptist he had
[1:05:33] such respects when he saw Jesus coming
[1:05:35] he said I'm not even worthy to touch his
[1:05:37] feet see
[1:05:38] the feet showing respects oh be
[1:05:41] conscious here is only one thing to be
[1:05:43] conscious of your littleness
[1:05:45] if you want to get somewhere with God
[1:05:47] make yourself real little
[1:05:50] I started thinking about all the men who
[1:05:52] come into the presence of God Moses amen
[1:05:56] humbled him Isaiah was undone
[1:06:00] Paul was flattened to the ground we
[1:06:03] think all these Bible figures brother
[1:06:05] Benham said when the angel comes I
[1:06:06] nearly die
[1:06:10] all of these figures what did it do it
[1:06:13] brought humility and then when I when I
[1:06:15] see sometimes that arrogant spirit I
[1:06:17] wonder if we've ever been in the
[1:06:19] presence of God
[1:06:21] because how could we have an an arrogant
[1:06:24] hottie know-it-all Spirit if we've been
[1:06:25] in the presence of God
[1:06:29] amen
[1:06:30] it must bring humility
[1:06:33] to actually see God recognize God in
[1:06:37] this hour to come in contact with the
[1:06:38] Living God it must bring reverence
[1:06:41] respect and humility
[1:06:44] when we see the lack of that I wonder if
[1:06:46] we've just introduced people to a church
[1:06:52] to a building to a local Gathering
[1:06:55] but if we've really brought people into
[1:06:57] the presence of God Amen should bring a
[1:07:00] reverence a respect and humility
[1:07:04] help us this is the struggle of Our
[1:07:06] Lives
[1:07:08] back and humble thyself he says above
[1:07:11] all things is our individual Souls that
[1:07:13] were responsible before God
[1:07:15] it's you going to heaven it isn't
[1:07:16] whether I go or he goes It's You Going
[1:07:18] see and you first and you've got to look
[1:07:21] this out and come sweet before the Lord
[1:07:24] and I've always found out that the man
[1:07:25] that humbles himself is the man that God
[1:07:27] exalts when you take a person with his
[1:07:30] chest out and knows everything and you
[1:07:31] can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant
[1:07:33] and well that's the person that never
[1:07:35] gets anywhere
[1:07:37] but you take the person that humbles
[1:07:38] themselves and walks sweetly
[1:07:41] I love how brother Branham over and over
[1:07:42] says humbly and sweetly and humbly and
[1:07:45] sweetly and all through this message
[1:07:46] humble thyself he keeps referring to
[1:07:48] sweetly and humbly
[1:07:51] and then I started thinking of those
[1:07:53] terms and I went and I did a search and
[1:07:55] brother Branham over and over and over
[1:07:57] when the angels of the Lord comes on the
[1:07:59] platform amen he'll tell the people you
[1:08:01] feel that real humble sweet feeling
[1:08:06] he said that's him
[1:08:08] he said that's him he said that's our
[1:08:10] Lord he said that's Jesus Christ he said
[1:08:12] that's the angel of the Lord he called
[1:08:13] it all those things that's the presence
[1:08:14] of God all of that amen and and over and
[1:08:18] over and over he says you feel that
[1:08:20] humble sweet presence
[1:08:24] you feel that and then in one place he
[1:08:26] said you feel that sweet Meek presence
[1:08:31] that's the presence of the Lord
[1:08:39] and dozens maybe hundreds of times
[1:08:42] he says this on tape
[1:08:45] how can we walk away from the presence
[1:08:47] of the Lord and take a hotty arrogant
[1:08:49] spirit
[1:08:51] when every time it came it was humble
[1:08:53] sweet meek
[1:08:57] brother bam says when the bride when she
[1:09:00] comes to the image of Christ said the
[1:09:02] devil the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:09:04] is that sweet humble spirit
[1:09:08] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:09:10] that's what it means to act like Christ
[1:09:12] not stand up and
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:18] sometimes we want demonstrations because
[1:09:21] demonstrations help us with our pride
[1:09:29] but I want demonstrations
[1:09:32] I want all the gifts of the Spirit
[1:09:33] operating and I want God to demonstrate
[1:09:35] and vindicate his word over and over but
[1:09:37] I want him to do it I want him to get
[1:09:39] the credits
[1:09:42] because if we do it wrong it'll lay a
[1:09:45] trap at people's feet
[1:09:48] but I want God to show himself mighty
[1:09:51] I want God to come on the scene I want
[1:09:54] him Amen to keep his word I want him to
[1:09:57] perform it I want him to be preeminent I
[1:09:59] want him to be king and Lord of lords
[1:10:01] and I want him to be the great Shepherd
[1:10:02] and I want him to get all the credit
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:09] let's look at Proverbs 18 together
[1:10:12] I hope we're still in our Bibles in
[1:10:14] Proverbs let's go to proverbs 18.
[1:10:23] Proverbs 18 verse 12.
[1:10:30] Proverbs 18 and 12 says Before
[1:10:32] Destruction the heart of man is haughty
[1:10:35] and before honor is humility
[1:10:39] so the question is do we want
[1:10:40] destruction or do we want honor
[1:10:43] then the Way Up Is Down
[1:10:46] back and humble thyself he says we want
[1:10:48] to keep it running smoothly sweetly in
[1:10:50] an order of the Lord so just remember
[1:10:52] that your part may be the mainspring or
[1:10:55] it may be the little some little hand or
[1:10:56] some little part or the whining stem or
[1:10:58] whatever it may be or it may be the
[1:11:00] hands on the face of the clock that
[1:11:01] tells the time but whatever it is it
[1:11:03] takes all it takes us all working
[1:11:05] together in harmony with the Gospel of
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ to bring this to pass and
[1:11:10] he's talking about the third pool
[1:11:13] it's going to take all of us working in
[1:11:15] harmony to bring this to pass
[1:11:18] just think if gifts is so great what we
[1:11:21] call power and Paul said though I have
[1:11:23] faith that would move a mountain and
[1:11:24] have not charity I am nothing think of
[1:11:26] that and though well we understand I
[1:11:28] wish I know the Bible though I
[1:11:30] understand all the mysteries of God see
[1:11:32] and still though I could do it and have
[1:11:34] not charity I am nothing see I ain't got
[1:11:36] nowhere yet see the main thing is love
[1:11:38] God and humble yourself with it
[1:11:41] is talking about every little piece has
[1:11:44] to play their part amen and it's amazing
[1:11:47] how whenever you get a group of people
[1:11:49] all personalities begin to pop up and
[1:11:52] all these old complexes and uh and pride
[1:11:55] and all of that and you find it's so
[1:11:58] hard sometimes for somebody just to stay
[1:12:00] in their Lane
[1:12:02] just to stay with what God given because
[1:12:04] somebody else gets more notoriety
[1:12:06] somebody else's position is more seen
[1:12:08] and they're always trying amen there's a
[1:12:11] Temptation either to try to get into
[1:12:13] that position or to tear down the one
[1:12:16] who's in that position
[1:12:18] find criticism amen for the officers of
[1:12:21] the church find criticism for the heads
[1:12:22] of a family find criticism for the one
[1:12:25] singing find criticism because why the
[1:12:27] reality is there's a pride in you
[1:12:29] somewhere and you feel sorry for
[1:12:30] yourself that you're not in that
[1:12:31] position
[1:12:33] and that critical spirit's coming up and
[1:12:35] we can I mean sometimes we're so good at
[1:12:37] finding fault with everything
[1:12:43] how about praising
[1:12:45] how about saying I appreciate somebody
[1:12:47] that'll stick with their office I
[1:12:49] appreciate somebody that will give
[1:12:51] themselves for that give themselves for
[1:12:52] this I appreciate it until God moves me
[1:12:56] from here I want to do this part the
[1:12:57] best I can
[1:12:59] that's Pride
[1:13:01] that Pride brings criticism that Pride
[1:13:04] amen brings a tearing down but all
[1:13:06] humility can come in and value everybody
[1:13:10] I appreciate everyone I appreciate the
[1:13:13] place that they play the role that they
[1:13:15] play I appreciate what they do
[1:13:17] and then we all every little mainspring
[1:13:20] every Cog every gear wheel everything
[1:13:22] works together and in harmony brings us
[1:13:25] into the manifestation of the third pool
[1:13:27] it takes us all working together
[1:13:30] doesn't matter what position we hold
[1:13:33] what God's called us to
[1:13:35] what gift he's given us where we fit in
[1:13:37] the body we all have to play our part
[1:13:41] and we all have to stay in our Lane
[1:13:44] I mean we can't take the ball out of
[1:13:46] somebody else's hand
[1:13:47] we got a block for them
[1:13:49] we all have to work together and love
[1:13:51] one another
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:56] brother member says
[1:13:59] now surely
[1:14:00] after all these years we're still in
[1:14:02] Humble thyself I'm telling you I go home
[1:14:04] and read it or listen to it if you can
[1:14:06] because it meant so much to me now
[1:14:09] surely after all these years on the
[1:14:10] field and around the world and seeing
[1:14:12] different people I ought to know a
[1:14:14] little bit about the gate to enter in at
[1:14:17] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:14:19] God never let an arrogant Spirit ever
[1:14:21] come around you
[1:14:23] don't let No Malice come in no matter
[1:14:26] what anybody does if they are wrong
[1:14:28] don't you never build up a complex
[1:14:30] against that person see you be sweet and
[1:14:32] kind remember God loved you when you
[1:14:34] were in sin and if the spirit of God is
[1:14:36] in you you love the other person when
[1:14:38] he's wrong and just pray for them and
[1:14:40] love one another
[1:14:42] why is that so hard
[1:14:44] because of the old sticky Caulker burnt
[1:14:46] nature
[1:14:48] amen above everything love God and love
[1:14:51] one another and be humble with God and
[1:14:54] around one another and God will bless us
[1:14:56] and it's hard telling what he will do
[1:15:00] it we'll just be humble with God and
[1:15:02] humble with one another and love God and
[1:15:04] be humble with one another and love one
[1:15:05] another there's no telling what God will
[1:15:07] do
[1:15:09] Proverbs 16 verse 5. let's turn there
[1:15:12] read the scripture
[1:15:17] this is the one I referred to a moment
[1:15:19] ago
[1:15:21] Proverbs 16 5 everyone that is proud in
[1:15:24] heart is an Abomination to the Lord
[1:15:29] an Abomination is bad
[1:15:32] we just say it that way
[1:15:35] I don't want to be proud and hearth
[1:15:37] I want to have a humble
[1:15:42] let's go to First Peter chapter 5.
[1:15:46] look at another scripture together
[1:15:55] First Peter chapter 5.
[1:16:03] first Peter 5 chapter 5 verse 5.
[1:16:07] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[1:16:09] into the Elder and yet all of you be
[1:16:10] subject one to another and be clothed
[1:16:13] with humility for God resisted the proud
[1:16:16] and giveth grace to the humble
[1:16:18] humble yourselves therefore unto the
[1:16:20] mighty hand of God that may he may exalt
[1:16:22] you in due time
[1:16:25] praise God
[1:16:26] this is what God wants for us
[1:16:29] and humble thyself he says let not that
[1:16:31] Spirit ever depart from this place
[1:16:34] if it ever does then I don't care how
[1:16:36] eloquent your pastor might be how well
[1:16:38] he might bring the word of God the
[1:16:40] spirit of God is grieved away
[1:16:42] when we can have all things in
[1:16:44] Fellowship in common and love one
[1:16:46] another then God will work with us
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:50] you know what it means it means we can't
[1:16:52] just sit back and have an arrogant
[1:16:54] spirit and have contention and have
[1:16:56] criticism one towards another we can't
[1:16:58] sit back and expect the gift to work
[1:17:04] I can have contention I can have a
[1:17:06] complex this is when I can have a
[1:17:07] feeling and I can have this and that and
[1:17:10] I can be proud and and I'll go to church
[1:17:12] and we'll still hear a good message no
[1:17:13] the spirit of God will be grieved away
[1:17:15] from that
[1:17:18] in order for us to hear from God Amen
[1:17:21] we've got to keep the spirit right we've
[1:17:22] got to keep the atmosphere right we've
[1:17:24] got to keep ourselves humble before God
[1:17:25] loving before God and humble with one
[1:17:27] another
[1:17:28] and loving
[1:17:30] amen
[1:17:32] and the Way Up Is Down
[1:17:34] in the message blind Bartimaeus he says
[1:17:36] redeeming love has been my theme and
[1:17:38] shall be till I die that's right get
[1:17:40] love in your heart and be true and honor
[1:17:42] and have the right kind of motive and
[1:17:44] the right kind of objective and God will
[1:17:45] take care of the rest
[1:17:47] if your motive is right and your
[1:17:49] objective is right if your objective is
[1:17:50] right and your mode is wrong it won't
[1:17:52] work
[1:17:54] I love this I looked I looked here
[1:17:57] that motive and objective just to have a
[1:17:59] definition so we're all on the same page
[1:18:01] the definition of motive is a reason for
[1:18:04] doing something
[1:18:05] so we have to judge our motive
[1:18:08] what's the reason we're doing it and I
[1:18:10] think that's a good question to ask
[1:18:11] whenever we get into anything it's great
[1:18:13] sometimes you know life is fast we move
[1:18:16] at a fast pace we go go but every once
[1:18:19] in a while stop it's good to stop just
[1:18:20] stop for a minute and just meditate and
[1:18:22] say why am I doing what I'm doing
[1:18:26] why am I doing this what's my motive
[1:18:29] behind it I mean we can get caught up in
[1:18:32] false motives so easy amen and and
[1:18:35] sometimes we can mask a false motive
[1:18:37] with religious rhetoric
[1:18:39] we're so good at that you see somebody
[1:18:42] has a problem with gossip
[1:18:45] they just need to tell you about
[1:18:47] somebody in the other church so that you
[1:18:49] can pray for them
[1:18:54] the motive was they just want to tell
[1:18:56] you what they heard
[1:18:57] there's no need for you to be involved
[1:19:00] there's nothing that you need to hear it
[1:19:01] doesn't have anything to do with you
[1:19:03] you're not intimately involved in the
[1:19:04] situation there's already people praying
[1:19:09] but somebody has a problem with gossip
[1:19:11] they'll come and start to be a tail
[1:19:13] Bearer and tell things and they'll cover
[1:19:15] it with religious rhetoric if I'm
[1:19:17] telling you this so you can pray when
[1:19:19] the reality is you're telling me this
[1:19:21] because you want to tell me this
[1:19:25] there's already people praying there's
[1:19:27] already a pastor involved there's
[1:19:29] already a church handling the situation
[1:19:33] there's no reason for you to tell me
[1:19:34] this
[1:19:35] and so we have to stop and say why do I
[1:19:39] want to tell this
[1:19:40] why do I want to share this why what is
[1:19:44] my real motive behind my actions I tell
[1:19:47] you when we get down to this it's a
[1:19:49] little bit tough
[1:19:50] to judge ourselves but I think we need
[1:19:52] to take time to judge ourselves and quit
[1:19:54] moving at such a fast pace amen and stop
[1:19:56] and say why am I doing this why am I
[1:19:59] doing that why did I make this decision
[1:20:00] why why did I say it I I've walked away
[1:20:03] sometimes from conversations and
[1:20:05] absolutely embarrassed at myself
[1:20:07] ashamed of myself
[1:20:09] because I said things in a certain way I
[1:20:12] phrase things a certain way because I
[1:20:14] was trying for people to have a good
[1:20:15] opinion of me and I and I wanted some
[1:20:18] way to tell them that I had accomplished
[1:20:19] something but they weren't asking yet so
[1:20:20] I found a way to work it into the car
[1:20:24] and I walk away and I hang my head so
[1:20:27] ashamed of myself that was nothing more
[1:20:29] than Pride
[1:20:33] you say why did I tell them that why
[1:20:35] would I didn't need to tell them that
[1:20:37] they weren't asking me
[1:20:38] the conversation wasn't on that it
[1:20:44] I hope I'm not the only one
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:49] we we need to stop and say why why am I
[1:20:54] doing that who benefits from that
[1:20:58] who looks good
[1:21:00] if I tell that who does it make look
[1:21:03] good if it just makes me look good then
[1:21:05] there's no reason to tell it
[1:21:09] because the scripture says we're not to
[1:21:10] praise ourselves let another praise you
[1:21:12] don't praise yourself
[1:21:15] why because that just generates more
[1:21:16] Pride
[1:21:18] so sometimes we've got to stop and look
[1:21:20] at the motive behind why we do things
[1:21:23] I mean sometimes you can see it so often
[1:21:25] in the way people post things on social
[1:21:27] media
[1:21:28] you see pride coming through
[1:21:31] and people will have all kinds of
[1:21:33] reasons I posted this for this reason I
[1:21:34] post and the real reason you post it is
[1:21:36] because you wanted to be accepted
[1:21:38] or look accepted or
[1:21:40] and we have to stop and say why am I
[1:21:42] doing what I'm doing am I following
[1:21:44] following in to the devil's trap
[1:21:47] or if this real humility is this real
[1:21:49] christ-like character or is this just my
[1:21:52] own Pride deceiving me
[1:21:55] what's our motive what's our motive for
[1:21:57] talking about a situation
[1:22:00] is it to help or is it just to talk
[1:22:01] about the situation
[1:22:04] so it's times that we need to talk about
[1:22:06] situations there's times we need to
[1:22:08] correct things there's times that we
[1:22:09] need to go to people
[1:22:11] there's times we need to go to a
[1:22:13] Brother's sister and we need to
[1:22:14] straighten something up there's times
[1:22:15] but what's my motive for doing it
[1:22:18] am I doing it so that they'll know I'm
[1:22:20] right and they're wrong you better not
[1:22:22] have that conversation yet
[1:22:25] am I doing it so that I can say well I
[1:22:27] tried it's their fault now I did my part
[1:22:31] wrong motive
[1:22:33] but if I'm concerned for their soul and
[1:22:35] there's something wrong and I don't want
[1:22:36] any hindrance and I don't want this odd
[1:22:38] feeling and I want love and I want
[1:22:39] Harmony and I want Unity then you better
[1:22:41] go to them because your motive is right
[1:22:45] there's times we have conversations
[1:22:46] there's times we talk about things
[1:22:48] there's times
[1:22:50] for everything
[1:22:52] but what's our motive if our motive is
[1:22:54] right and our objective is right then
[1:22:56] God will make sure it comes out
[1:22:58] but if our motive is wrong then God's
[1:23:01] not obligated to make it work out
[1:23:02] because there's something else going on
[1:23:06] then I looked at the word objective
[1:23:08] objective means something toward which
[1:23:10] effort is directed an aim a goal or the
[1:23:13] end of an action
[1:23:14] so the motive is the reason we're doing
[1:23:16] it the objective is what we're trying to
[1:23:19] achieve
[1:23:20] what is the goal what is the aim what
[1:23:22] are we trying to do amen and if what
[1:23:25] we're trying to do amen is not for the
[1:23:28] kingdom of God if what we're trying to
[1:23:30] do is not for somebody else's benefit if
[1:23:32] what we're trying to do if it somehow is
[1:23:35] for our benefit for personal gain for
[1:23:37] selfish reasons then we better leave it
[1:23:38] alone
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:43] brother Benham taught us not to even
[1:23:45] pray selfishly
[1:23:48] he says you want to be healed what do
[1:23:49] you want to be healed for
[1:23:51] what do you want to do when you're
[1:23:53] healed what are you going to do with
[1:23:54] your health are you going to serve God
[1:23:55] what do you want to be what do you want
[1:23:57] to be healed for so you can testify what
[1:23:59] do you want to be healed for he told us
[1:24:01] not to even pray even for our healing
[1:24:03] just for selfish reasons just so we can
[1:24:04] feel better and not have pain he told us
[1:24:07] what what's the motive behind what
[1:24:08] you're asking because when you get the
[1:24:09] motive right God will make it come out
[1:24:11] right
[1:24:13] you say my motive is God I want to see
[1:24:16] your word work I believe your promise
[1:24:17] and I know it's true and I want to
[1:24:19] testify that this word is true I want to
[1:24:21] have health so that I can serve you
[1:24:22] better so I can serve my family so that
[1:24:24] I can serve in my position what's our
[1:24:26] motive what's our objective
[1:24:28] he said when our motive and objective is
[1:24:30] right God will take care of the rest
[1:24:34] sometimes we just need to stop for a
[1:24:36] minute
[1:24:37] and just reflect
[1:24:39] and ask God
[1:24:41] to open up our understanding
[1:24:43] so God show me where I'm at right now
[1:24:46] and why I'm doing what I'm doing
[1:24:48] and if her motive is right and our
[1:24:50] objective is right we're humble move
[1:24:53] forward with faith that God will take
[1:24:54] care of the rest
[1:24:56] God will come on the scene and God will
[1:24:59] work it out
[1:25:01] when you look at the Pharisees
[1:25:04] the Pharisees motives and their
[1:25:06] objectives were wrong
[1:25:09] but their actions were right
[1:25:12] you look at the Pharisee who kept the
[1:25:15] Sabbath you look at the Pharisee who
[1:25:16] paid tithes you look at the Pharisee
[1:25:18] amen who went to the temple to pray you
[1:25:21] look at the Pharisee his actions were
[1:25:23] right his motives and objectives were
[1:25:25] wrong
[1:25:27] amen you remember the one who goes to
[1:25:30] the temple to pray and he says I thank
[1:25:32] you God that I'm not like this Publican
[1:25:34] and I'm not a sinner and I fast so many
[1:25:36] times a day and I pay tithes of all
[1:25:40] and Jesus said there was another poor
[1:25:42] man he went in there and knitting so
[1:25:44] much as raised his head up but bowed his
[1:25:46] head and smote himself on the chest and
[1:25:48] say God I'm an unworthy sinner
[1:25:52] he said that man went Justified to his
[1:25:54] house not the other one
[1:25:59] Jesus says in Matthew 23 I'm just going
[1:26:02] to read it to you on Matthew 23.
[1:26:05] he's referring to the Pharisees he says
[1:26:06] for they are blind for they bind heavy
[1:26:09] burdens and Grievous to be born and lay
[1:26:10] them on men's shoulders but they
[1:26:12] themselves will not move them with one
[1:26:13] of their fingers
[1:26:14] but all their Works they do for to be
[1:26:18] seen of men
[1:26:20] that was their motive
[1:26:22] to be seen of men they make broader
[1:26:25] phylacteries they enlarge the borders of
[1:26:27] their garments they love the uppermost
[1:26:29] rooms at feast and chief seats in the
[1:26:31] synagogues and greetings in the markets
[1:26:33] and to be called men be called of men
[1:26:35] Rabbi Rabbi teacher teacher their motive
[1:26:38] is wrong and their objective is wrong
[1:26:42] and that's why Jesus spoke so harshly
[1:26:44] with him their actions were right their
[1:26:46] motive and objective was wrong
[1:26:48] I said God I want my actions dictated by
[1:26:51] a right motive and a right objective
[1:26:55] further down in Matthew 20 23 23 says
[1:26:57] wound you scribes and Pharisees
[1:26:59] Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[1:27:01] anise and come and cumin and I have a
[1:27:04] mid and have emitted the weightier
[1:27:05] matters of the law judgment mercy and
[1:27:07] Faith these ought to you have done and
[1:27:09] not leave the other undone ye blind
[1:27:11] guides which strain it in that and
[1:27:13] swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and
[1:27:15] Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean
[1:27:17] the outside of the cup and of the
[1:27:18] platter but within they are full of
[1:27:21] extortions and excess Thou blind
[1:27:23] Pharisee cleanse first that which is
[1:27:25] within the cup and platter then the
[1:27:27] outside of them may be clean also woe
[1:27:30] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[1:27:31] Hypocrites for you like unto Whited
[1:27:33] sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful
[1:27:35] outward but are within full of dead
[1:27:37] men's bones and of all uncleanness
[1:27:40] even so you also outwardly appear
[1:27:42] righteous unto men but within you are
[1:27:44] full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:27:47] I say God forbid that I'd ever step into
[1:27:49] this picture
[1:27:53] I look back with shame at things I've
[1:27:56] done
[1:27:57] things I've said
[1:27:59] foolishness
[1:28:01] Pride
[1:28:03] a need to be accepted fear of rejection
[1:28:06] all those things motivated conversations
[1:28:09] and phrasing things a certain way
[1:28:11] presenting ourselves a certain way
[1:28:14] I said oh God forgive us for all of that
[1:28:17] forgive us for our childishness forgive
[1:28:19] us for our insecurities forgive us for
[1:28:21] believing the lies of the devil help me
[1:28:23] God to humble myself to where I don't
[1:28:25] even have to think about myself anymore
[1:28:28] real humility is where you just don't
[1:28:29] think about yourself anymore
[1:28:32] you've seen people who try to project
[1:28:34] humility
[1:28:36] and by trying to project the humility
[1:28:37] they're just like I'm a worm I'm nothing
[1:28:39] I'm no good I don't even know why people
[1:28:41] like me that's not real humility I mean
[1:28:43] real humility you know who you are I'm a
[1:28:45] Son of God by the grace of God God's
[1:28:46] call me to my position I can do nothing
[1:28:48] without him but by the grace of God I am
[1:28:50] what I am real humility false humility
[1:28:53] is trying to project humility so people
[1:28:55] think well of you
[1:28:59] and we see a lot of false humility
[1:29:02] but real humility you don't even think
[1:29:04] about yourself
[1:29:05] you don't think good you don't think bad
[1:29:06] you just don't think about yourself
[1:29:08] real humility is you're not in the way
[1:29:10] you're not great you're not the worst
[1:29:12] creature that ever lived you're just
[1:29:13] there
[1:29:15] you're just a tool in God's hand one of
[1:29:16] God's children one that he called by his
[1:29:18] grace your your one that he's called
[1:29:20] that he wants to do something with if
[1:29:22] anything good comes it's him
[1:29:24] real humility is balance
[1:29:28] real humility is in the middle of the
[1:29:30] road real humility is a false humility
[1:29:33] is you're the object you're always
[1:29:35] focused on I can't believe I did that
[1:29:36] I'm such a fool I'm such a disaster
[1:29:38] nobody should talk to me you're still
[1:29:40] paying attention to yourself way too
[1:29:42] much
[1:29:44] other humility is did you see what I did
[1:29:46] did you see how I did that was everybody
[1:29:48] looking when I did that
[1:29:51] both of them are Pride
[1:29:55] when we come in the middle we just step
[1:29:57] out of the picture
[1:29:59] and it's not about us
[1:30:01] I'm not the most important one
[1:30:03] ah nobody's really paying attention to
[1:30:06] me
[1:30:07] and I don't really want anybody to pay
[1:30:09] attention to me I want them to pay
[1:30:10] attention to God
[1:30:12] I'm a tool in his hand i'm something
[1:30:14] that he's using I'm his son I'm part of
[1:30:16] his bride but he's
[1:30:18] he's not a worm amen I've been redeemed
[1:30:21] from that I've been brought to his side
[1:30:22] how can I call myself such horrible
[1:30:24] things when he calls me bride but I'm
[1:30:26] nothing without him
[1:30:28] I'm right here in the middle
[1:30:31] a correct view of ourselves
[1:30:34] amen and then we don't have to worry
[1:30:36] about ourselves we don't talk about
[1:30:37] ourselves we don't talk good we don't
[1:30:38] talk bad we don't have to spend all this
[1:30:40] time paying attention we can start
[1:30:41] getting on with the work of God
[1:30:43] and letting him be the great one let him
[1:30:45] have success let him do what he wants to
[1:30:47] do and us just stay out of his way
[1:30:51] God heal us of our complexes
[1:30:53] God heal us of our insecurities God
[1:30:56] Deliver us from our pride
[1:30:58] so that you can really get on with the
[1:31:00] work that you've left for this day for
[1:31:03] this hour
[1:31:06] he goes on to saying the message God's
[1:31:08] only provide a place of worship
[1:31:10] he says now you can't take your
[1:31:12] sincerity in all that you want to
[1:31:13] confess you just can't take it to the
[1:31:15] Methodist altar to the Baptist altar to
[1:31:17] the Pentecostal altar but there is an
[1:31:19] altar somewhere that he chose that he
[1:31:22] put his name in it and he would meet you
[1:31:25] at that place now if you get everything
[1:31:26] running just right it's going to run
[1:31:28] everything set in order
[1:31:30] if there's a short in the wire that
[1:31:32] light won't come on because it's been
[1:31:34] grounded and when you take one of God's
[1:31:36] words or one of his places and in your
[1:31:39] own heart have selfish objectives it'll
[1:31:42] ground the power of God right there
[1:31:45] if you do it because you want to be
[1:31:48] smart you want to be different from
[1:31:49] somebody else or something right there
[1:31:51] it's grounded
[1:31:53] it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've
[1:31:55] got to come with sincerity with all your
[1:31:57] heart your motives and your objectives
[1:31:59] placed on God then search for his place
[1:32:01] find where he said and bring it there
[1:32:05] oh God line up our motives and
[1:32:07] objectives
[1:32:09] and the message perfect strength by
[1:32:11] Perfect weakness he says the important
[1:32:13] thing one of the important things that
[1:32:15] we must Master now remember this and
[1:32:17] especially you young preachers
[1:32:19] so I'm taking this for myself
[1:32:21] I'm still believe I'm a young preacher
[1:32:24] especially young preachers and lay
[1:32:26] members alike there's one thing that
[1:32:28] we've got to master if we expect to
[1:32:30] fulfill God's desire in our life
[1:32:32] that is we have to master the thought of
[1:32:34] human ability
[1:32:36] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[1:32:38] that we can do it with our own
[1:32:40] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[1:32:42] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:32:44] get rid of the thing and lay it aside so
[1:32:46] that God can use us
[1:32:52] hey man let's go to First Corinthians 8.
[1:32:54] I referred to this but I want to read it
[1:32:56] together first Corinthians chapter 8.
[1:32:59] and we're winding down here to a finish
[1:33:02] First Corinthians chapter 8.
[1:33:15] now as touching things offered into
[1:33:17] Idols we know that we all have knowledge
[1:33:20] knowledge puffeth up but charity
[1:33:22] edifieth
[1:33:24] it's amazing
[1:33:26] all of our spiritual understanding if it
[1:33:28] doesn't come the right way and if we
[1:33:30] take it with our arrogant Spirit it can
[1:33:33] puff up but charity love Capstone love
[1:33:36] always edifies builds up
[1:33:40] knowledge that puffs up will tear other
[1:33:42] people down
[1:33:44] because in order for me to be puffed up
[1:33:46] I have to put somebody else down
[1:33:49] so there has to be other ministers that
[1:33:51] are not it's good there has to be other
[1:33:52] churches not as good
[1:33:55] there have to be other believers not as
[1:33:56] good we have to be at a higher level
[1:33:58] than other people
[1:34:00] to be puffed up
[1:34:02] but charity
[1:34:04] doesn't put down charity builds up
[1:34:06] that's what the word edified mean it
[1:34:08] builds up real love will build up
[1:34:10] everywhere you can build up
[1:34:15] let's keep reading
[1:34:18] and if any man think that he knoweth
[1:34:20] anything he knoweth nothing yet as he
[1:34:23] ought to know
[1:34:25] so any of us who thought we knew the
[1:34:27] message
[1:34:28] let's apply this scripture I don't even
[1:34:31] know it as I ought
[1:34:33] I don't even know it like I really need
[1:34:35] to know it I don't even know it like God
[1:34:36] really wants me to know I don't even
[1:34:38] know it to its fullest extent
[1:34:42] do you know the word yes I know the word
[1:34:43] but I don't know it like I ought to know
[1:34:45] it I want to know it more I want to
[1:34:47] constantly strive for greater Vision
[1:34:49] greater word greater understanding
[1:34:51] greater manifestation Greater Life
[1:34:54] I want to constantly be pressing forward
[1:34:56] amen I want to Die daily Paul didn't die
[1:34:59] once Paul died daily
[1:35:01] Paul took up his cross and followed
[1:35:03] after Christ because he realized he was
[1:35:05] going to have to stay dead be dead stay
[1:35:07] dead and carry and pack around his own
[1:35:09] cross
[1:35:11] I said God help us to stay dead
[1:35:14] myself and alive in Christ
[1:35:18] I can humbled ourselves he this is the
[1:35:21] last quote I'll read from humble myself
[1:35:22] from this message he said look at Jesus
[1:35:24] nothing but one bundle of love
[1:35:27] he was God's he was God manifested
[1:35:30] he God expressed himself through him no
[1:35:33] wonder Miracles and things happen his
[1:35:35] humble life and consecrated life to come
[1:35:37] from being God to be a man here on the
[1:35:39] earth to express God through himself
[1:35:42] that's what made him what he was I've
[1:35:45] always said what made Jesus God to me
[1:35:48] was the way he humbled himself he was so
[1:35:51] great and yet he could be so small
[1:35:54] he said that's what made him God to him
[1:35:57] was his ability to Humble himself
[1:36:00] you know the devil can't humble himself
[1:36:03] Lucifer can't humble himself he exalted
[1:36:05] himself God can humble himself
[1:36:08] I want to be a child of God so I want
[1:36:10] the attributes of my father I want the
[1:36:12] ability to humble myself
[1:36:17] he said in the message presuming he said
[1:36:19] bless God I'm a one that's Hallelujah
[1:36:22] bless God I'm an assembly glory to God
[1:36:23] I'm a Church of God we're this kind
[1:36:25] we're that kind
[1:36:27] you're nothing
[1:36:29] oh I love that you're nothing
[1:36:32] as long as you think that you're nothing
[1:36:34] the Bible said when a man thinks himself
[1:36:36] something he's nothing he has nothing
[1:36:38] that he ought to be that's exactly right
[1:36:40] you think yourself nothing come down so
[1:36:42] empty yourself found you're trying to
[1:36:44] fill your yourself up you empty the
[1:36:47] biggest job for the church and the
[1:36:49] individual is empty itself that's rough
[1:36:51] but it's good
[1:36:53] what do I need to empty I don't need to
[1:36:55] empty myself of the word I don't need to
[1:36:56] empty myself the spirit of God I need to
[1:36:58] empty myself of myself
[1:37:00] I need to get rid of things that I got
[1:37:03] from my grandparents and my parents
[1:37:05] picked up as a child I need to let those
[1:37:08] things not influence me not run the day
[1:37:10] but I need them exposed so I can ask God
[1:37:12] God help me to cast this aside help me
[1:37:14] to discard that thinking help me to get
[1:37:16] rid of that feeling
[1:37:18] you know there's if you ever had a
[1:37:21] feeling before
[1:37:22] oh yeah we're human beings you ever had
[1:37:25] a negative feeling
[1:37:27] have you ever had a negative feeling
[1:37:28] towards another human being
[1:37:30] okay stop feeling that
[1:37:34] how do you stop feeling that
[1:37:37] you get to a place where you get on your
[1:37:39] knees and you recognize God this isn't
[1:37:40] according to your word
[1:37:42] I'm not supposed to have ought towards
[1:37:44] your brother I'm not supposed to have
[1:37:45] ought towards nobody God would you come
[1:37:46] and Purge this out of my heart I need
[1:37:48] your help I'm dying to this and asking
[1:37:51] you to take it away
[1:37:53] amen so many times we try to just
[1:37:55] pretend we don't feel this way or
[1:37:57] pretend that or I don't do this I stop
[1:37:59] feeling that way I mean our emotions are
[1:38:02] really hard to control
[1:38:06] there's times when you just have to get
[1:38:08] on your knees and say God I've carried
[1:38:10] this too long
[1:38:11] I'm still hurt about things in the past
[1:38:13] I still have awe against people who are
[1:38:15] now dead
[1:38:17] people have wronged me family members
[1:38:19] and people in churches and God it's time
[1:38:22] that I got rid of this and I can't do it
[1:38:24] myself I can't just say I'm not going to
[1:38:26] be hurt anymore I need to lay this at
[1:38:28] your feet and if God if I give this to
[1:38:30] you will you take it from me because it
[1:38:31] doesn't belong it's not part of your
[1:38:33] word
[1:38:36] God help me to forgive from my heart
[1:38:38] amen how do you get from your heart when
[1:38:40] your heart is still angry and your heart
[1:38:42] is still bitter amen you need God to
[1:38:44] come heal your heart so that you can
[1:38:46] forgive from your heart
[1:38:50] we need to be honest we need to be real
[1:38:52] we need to be genuine we need to Humble
[1:38:54] ourselves and ask God to have mercy on
[1:38:57] us
[1:38:58] and not just continue kicking the can
[1:39:00] down the road and act like things are
[1:39:02] going to go away
[1:39:04] we need to deal with some things get
[1:39:06] them purged so that we can stay humble
[1:39:09] reverent humble with our brothers and
[1:39:12] sisters and that that love can begin to
[1:39:14] project out of us
[1:39:16] the devil put a lot of traps in you and
[1:39:18] I
[1:39:19] put a lot of roadblocks and a lot of
[1:39:21] hindrances in our heart to keep us from
[1:39:24] really expressing what God wants us to
[1:39:26] express in this day he saw to it that
[1:39:28] you got hurt and you were wounded and
[1:39:29] you may have been abandoned you may have
[1:39:31] been neglected you may have had people
[1:39:33] uh uh uh tear down your name you may
[1:39:36] have had false accusations brought
[1:39:38] against you you may have had all kinds
[1:39:40] of things that's happened to in your
[1:39:41] life amen and all kinds of cruel things
[1:39:44] said about you and rejections and
[1:39:47] and that's just the devil trying to stop
[1:39:49] a manifestation of God before it gets
[1:39:51] started
[1:39:52] but I'm telling you there's a balm in
[1:39:54] Gilead
[1:39:55] there's a Holy Ghost and there's a word
[1:39:57] that promised us that he'll heal all of
[1:39:59] our diseases and when he came he come to
[1:40:01] bind up the Brokenhearted amen those of
[1:40:04] a contrite heart amen those things that
[1:40:07] he just as much as he's here to heal
[1:40:09] diseases he's healed to hear your heart
[1:40:11] too yeah
[1:40:14] if we take those things to him and say
[1:40:16] will you heal me he's not going to turn
[1:40:17] his back on us amen we're asking him
[1:40:19] Lord this thing's a stumbling Stone this
[1:40:21] is a hindrance to me this is keeping me
[1:40:23] from projecting the love I want to
[1:40:25] protect this can constantly holding me
[1:40:27] back and making me suspicious of people
[1:40:30] God would you come and clean my heart if
[1:40:32] I give it to you will you take it from
[1:40:34] me Lord
[1:40:35] and help me to forgive those who wounded
[1:40:38] me forgive my brothers forgive my family
[1:40:40] forgive
[1:40:42] so that I can be free to express your
[1:40:45] love to this world
[1:40:47] so that I can be what you've called me
[1:40:50] to be
[1:40:51] brother bam said we're going on a
[1:40:53] journey
[1:40:55] in this journey you don't pack for
[1:40:57] you unpack
[1:41:01] when we get there everything's already
[1:41:03] provided there's nothing we need to take
[1:41:05] he's going to pick our souls up and take
[1:41:07] us
[1:41:08] but we're in the process now of
[1:41:10] unpacking
[1:41:12] unpacking complexes unpacking ideas
[1:41:14] unpacking selfishness unpacking wrong
[1:41:17] motives unpacking Pride I say God I got
[1:41:21] a lot to unpack
[1:41:23] help me God to unpack
[1:41:26] help me to die help me to surrender
[1:41:29] help me to give up
[1:41:31] why because this manifestation of the
[1:41:34] third pool
[1:41:35] requires all of us working in harmony
[1:41:37] together
[1:41:39] it's going to be through the bride and
[1:41:42] the bride is one body
[1:41:45] and that one body is not to have strife
[1:41:47] and contention but it's to be in Harmony
[1:41:49] and love every member loving one another
[1:41:52] in each joint supplying and edifying one
[1:41:54] another
[1:41:57] we need to grow
[1:41:58] we need to grow Beyond ourselves
[1:42:01] we need to grow Beyond a lot of things
[1:42:05] that we've allowed to trouble us because
[1:42:07] in order to get on with the program of
[1:42:09] God
[1:42:10] 's going to need all of us to Humble
[1:42:13] ourselves
[1:42:14] and be humble with one another
[1:42:17] to be surrendered to be tender to be
[1:42:20] soft
[1:42:21] to be sweet and meek and humble and
[1:42:25] loving
[1:42:28] I'm ready for unpacking
[1:42:32] there's things I've carried too long
[1:42:34] and I want to unpack them
[1:42:37] there's things that other people handed
[1:42:39] me that I've been carrying but I want to
[1:42:40] unpack that one too
[1:42:42] there's things that people threw on me
[1:42:44] that I never wanted
[1:42:46] but by the grace of God I can unpack
[1:42:48] them now
[1:42:50] God would you help me
[1:42:52] unpack help me empty out help me be free
[1:42:58] help me be free from Pride help me be
[1:43:01] free from selfishness
[1:43:03] help me be free from rejection fears
[1:43:07] complexes help me be free
[1:43:10] I want to be a vessel that you can flow
[1:43:13] through so easily
[1:43:15] and that others will come in contact
[1:43:17] with and recognize there's something
[1:43:19] different here Christ is here
[1:43:22] amen so that they don't see me they see
[1:43:25] you in me
[1:43:28] amen
[1:43:31] First Corinthians 10 12 gives us a
[1:43:33] warning
[1:43:34] said wherefore let him that thinketh he
[1:43:36] standeth
[1:43:37] take heed lest he fall
[1:43:41] that old proud Spirit well how's it
[1:43:44] thinking we're fine
[1:43:45] I'm fine I've served God so many years
[1:43:48] I'm fine I know this I know that I'm
[1:43:51] fine
[1:43:53] he that thinketh he stand that should
[1:43:54] take heed lest he fall
[1:43:57] I say rather than trying to stand it
[1:43:59] might be easier just to fall
[1:44:02] at his feet and say God I can't stand
[1:44:04] without you
[1:44:06] I can't stand unless you're holding my
[1:44:07] hand I can't stand unless you help me
[1:44:09] out I can't stand unless you're standing
[1:44:11] beside me
[1:44:12] I can't do it on my own
[1:44:15] I don't want to think that I've got this
[1:44:17] figured out or I've got it in the bag or
[1:44:19] I've been so many years and so long and
[1:44:21] done so well and accomplished so many
[1:44:23] things and have finally
[1:44:26] we'll know when we finally get to that
[1:44:28] place because I think our atoms will
[1:44:30] change
[1:44:31] until then I want to be striving
[1:44:34] for the Mastery for the goal
[1:44:36] I want to be faithful
[1:44:39] striving for the Mastery let's all stand
[1:44:41] together please
[1:44:43] Blake if you're common musicians
[1:44:45] and let's just bow our heads and our
[1:44:47] hearts before the Lord
[1:44:49] say here heavenly father I thank you
[1:44:51] Lord Jesus
[1:44:53] you're so merciful to us
[1:44:56] God you're so faithful
[1:44:59] to come to us in every stage of life and
[1:45:02] in every need that we have
[1:45:05] God you're so good to never let us just
[1:45:07] keep plowing on
[1:45:09] keep pushing keep acting like
[1:45:12] everything's all right but there's times
[1:45:14] special times
[1:45:16] you give us an opportunity to stop
[1:45:19] push the pause button and say God
[1:45:22] show me where this is coming from Lord
[1:45:24] help me to get rid of this Pride
[1:45:27] selfishness
[1:45:29] God show me my motives and my objectives
[1:45:32] take the sword of your word and discern
[1:45:35] the thoughts and intents of My Heart
[1:45:37] Lord

[1:45:47] things in US Lord that are contrary
[1:45:49] that's hindering our walk
[1:45:51] that's stopping your expression in our
[1:45:53] lives and help us to turn loose of it
[1:45:55] Lord to take our fingers off of it and
[1:45:57] let it go
[1:45:58] that you can take it from us
[1:46:01] Lord I pray that you would pour the balm
[1:46:03] of Gilead in our hearts pour healing
[1:46:05] into US Lord

[1:46:16] influence in us not other Spirits Lord
[1:46:18] not other touch points not other hooks
[1:46:21] from the past but may we be free Lord so

[1:46:25] our lives
[1:46:26] may you move us Lord give us a real
[1:46:28] humility

[1:46:32] humble ourselves amongst ourselves or we
[1:46:36] can be humble to one another
[1:46:39] and we as an assembly can be humble
[1:46:41] before you
[1:46:42] that you can accomplish what you've left
[1:46:44] for this hour

[1:47:39] your Prophet said they were so shocked
[1:47:41] at how they loved one another
[1:47:43] that was their testimony of the first
[1:47:45] church age my how they love each other
[1:47:49] your Apostle John instructed us Above

[1:48:07] give us compassion and desire
[1:48:10] to see lives changed and people helped
[1:48:14] for God when your Prophet was coming
[1:48:15] from the seals

[1:48:19] higher he knew that he had to change
[1:48:23] he had complexes he had ill feeling he
[1:48:26] felt rejected and felt like the people
[1:48:28] should have heard him and he had to have
