this day we yielded unto you i pray god that you would take every part of this service in your control and now as we come lord to the preaching of the word lord we're trusting in you for you're the one who can do it lord you're the only one who can do it so we're laying ourselves aside lord and we're laying ourselves in your hand and asking lord that you would pick up your tool and that you would use it for your glory that you would accomplish your purpose you would have your way among us lord you've come because your word says you would come now may you find welcome in this place in our hearts and in our lives for we greet you lord and we give you preeminence in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you if you could just turn with me in your bibles to isaiah chapter 40. i would just like to say also that uh we appreciate everybody who came out yesterday for the celebration of life for brother john matthews and especially for all those who helped who worked in the kitchen who helped with the service helped with clean up i got a call from brother josh lauren he said the family was very much blessed and really appreciated it he wanted me to make sure that i gave thanks from the family back to the assembly for all the all that helped and all that were involved so thank you very much for that also i wanted to let you know that um sister dinah cason's mother passed away thursday morning which is kyle weikert's grandmother and so we've posted the information on the bulletin board there'll be a funeral this week and there's some information there if you'd like to send cards so just keep them in prayer brother kyle was asked to take the funeral service for her grandmother so i'm sure he would appreciate your prayers that wouldn't be an easy thing to do but but may god grant him grace to take his place amen so keep the family in prayer if you don't mind and also i'd like to greet the yoder family god bless you it's good to have you in service again i know they were here a couple weeks ago but i wasn't here to greet them so i'm going to greet them anyways so god bless you we're very glad to have you here and also brother glenn and sister satan from florida it's good to have you back visiting with us again and god bless you very much it was a busy weekend and we mean we know we had the youth camp out and the meetings that were there and a lot of you were involved helping with that so we've had a busy time but we've had a good time amen and god has been good to us and we come here this morning to hear his word and to rejoice in what he's doing in our lives and what he's doing in this day we come with anticipation and if you come with anticipation and expectation you always find what you're looking for amen so let's come with a heart desiring to know him better in isaiah chapter 40. i'd like to just read a portion of scripture before we're seated let's begin in verse 3 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough place is plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it amen you can have your seats may the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word god is so wonderful to us to open our eyes to give us eyes to see you know no matter how hard you look at the scripture it'll never open unless god opens it amen no matter how hard for thousands of years that they've looked at the seals trying to find the interpretation of the seals nobody could understand what the seals were until the lamb took the book and opened the seals so no matter how much we look at something study it read it want to know it amen unless god opens it we'll never see it that's what the fallacy of intellectualism in our day is we're trying by education in schooling and by the ability to read to know god but you'll never by the ability of by the ability to read to know god because when jesus christ came in flesh they proved that just the ability to study and read was not enough to know god because they read the psalms they read the prophets they read moses and the law and they knew all the pro they knew all the prophecies about the coming the messiah but when the word was made flesh and stood among them amen they had the intellectual reading of the word but they didn't have the divine revelation from god to recognize that this is that this that's standing in front of me is the revelation of what i've been reading in the book all they had was the intellectual part they did not have the revealed party man and god to prove that it wasn't intellectualism he would take illiterate fishermen because it was said of the disciples they were ignorant and unlearned amen so god would take the ones who didn't know the intellectual side of the scriptures amen and he would reveal it to them so that they would be able to declare to understand to see the coming of the lord the coming of the son of god the messiah upon the earth they could see what the learned could not see they they were ignorant and unlearned so they could not even read but they didn't need to be able to read they needed revelation from god so that's where the christian church has failed failed by education and school systems and one man pro proclamating his interpretation by intellectualism to another and to another and to another until they just keep repeating it until it becomes the facts till it becomes the only interpretation of this scripture amen but then god will come and do it in a way according to his word but not according to their expectation and when it comes according to the word it's a perfect fulfillment of the word but it's not a perfect fulfillment of their expectation of the word so they reject the fulfillment of the word because it wasn't the way they expected it lord help us not to fall into that same trap we're continuing on with the same thought we've been on with the unexpected fulfillment part three i'm sure you've guessed that by now but i want to look at this prophecy laying in isaiah and this prophecy is a prophecy of john the baptist coming the forerunner that's coming there's several prophecies that point to his coming to forerun the coming of christ but i want to look at verse five and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord has spoken it so part of this prophecy of this one coming we've already looked last sunday at the first part the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye away of the lord and make straight in the desert a highway for our god so we we talked about that there is a there when you read this description every valley shall be exalted every mountain and shale shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight in the rough places made plain when you look at this with an intellectual understanding there's no way you can make that equal that man wrapped in a cloak of camel's hair amen eating locust and wild honey screaming on the banks of the muddy jordan you could not make this equal that amen the intellectual mind is looking for a road where physical hills are torn down and valleys are filled in and crooked places straighten out and rough places made smooth making a highway in the desert for the lord and then the intellectual mind will read that and have an understanding by reading that and they'll be looking for something to come based off their understanding of reading those words but when john the baptist came he didn't have a pick or a shovel or a working crew he didn't move stones and he didn't do anything that you would think he would do what he did is he knocked the pharisees off their high horse amen and he brought everybody to a level plane of repentance he brought the prostitutes and and he brought the drunkards up in repentance he brought the pharisees and the sadducees down in repentance what was he doing he was making the way straight amen away in the wilderness through repentance amen so that people the way of christ was made so the fulfillment was a spiritual fulfillment amen and it wasn't physical according to intellectualism amen i hope that makes sense praise be to god and so now i want to look at verse 5 because verse 5 is part of the same prophecy and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and the flesh shall and and all flesh shall see it together from the mouth of the lord has spoken it now if you could go with me to to luke chapter 3 luke in the gospel he repeats this luke chapter 3 and i'm going to begin at verse 3. and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isaias the prophet we just read those the saying the voice of the one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough way shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god if you're looking at this intellectually the question is when did all flesh how many people on the earth knew or seen jesus or witnessed jesus ministry when did all flesh see when you take an intellectual approach and you look at this and you try to make it fit intellectually you know only a portion of the population of the world in that day heard john the baptist preach only a small number repented under his ministry only a few people of the millions that were on earth at that time ever even knew jesus christ not even all israel would have seen jesus and heard him preach but the prophecy says all flesh shall see the salvation of the lord all and and it says all flesh shall see it together and so you realize that the fulfillment of prophecy does not match our intellectual idea because we're thinking of well you've got to you've got to gather every everybody all flesh and i'm not here to interpret this i'm just here to show it amen because i don't know what the interpretation is but we know at some point all flesh shall see the salvation of the lord amen if it may not be to the white throne judgment but at the white throne judgment all flesh shall see him i don't know i don't i don't i'm not going to try to explain this it's not for me to explain was it fulfilled in john the baptist ministry absolutely was he the fulfillment of the forerunner ministry absolutely amen how do you equate all flesh with his ministry i don't know but it's fulfilled if that prophecy is still going on and still rolling all the way down to a final fulfillment at the white throne judgment that's fine with me i'm fine with that but the prophecy has been fulfilled somebody asked me what what what was all flesh then i said all the flesh that he meant by all flesh see why do we why do we intellectualize it and we try to make the fulfillment of prophecy fit into our understanding by reading amen it's not understanding by reading it's understanding by revelation he interprets his word by bringing it to past then when he brings it to pass there's an elect people on the earth that will catch the revelation that this is the fulfillment of that he hides it in simplicity and reveals it in the same amen it's not for the intellectual it's not for the learned it's for those that can receive revelation from the father he's hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed it to the babes god he didn't make it to where the intellectual could catch it he made it where the babes could catch it i don't know about you but a baby can't read yet praise god god's good so i just want to retouch this foundation and just keep moving from there because we want we never want to get ourselves hemmed in by intellectualism we never want to corner ourselves in the bible amen by saying well you know this this and this has to happen amen because that's where they were in the days that jesus was pulling the earth even his disciples they were in that mentality they were looking at jesus and they knew there was something special about this ministry and they were believing that it was the messiah the christ that would come but they had a problem in their understanding and they asked him one day they say doesn't the scripture say or why does the scripture say elias must first come because see they're recognizing that this is the messiah they're recognizing this is the christ so there must be a forerunner but they haven't seen a forerunner yet so they asked the question why does the scripture say elias must come first and jesus says elias has truly come already you missed it they're his disciples amen they're looking at him and believing him but they're missing the fulfillment of the scriptures that they were looking for to fulfill to confirm that this was messiah it was already done they're standing here believing this messiah with a question in their heart what about this scripture and he says it's already been done it's already been fulfilled and they did to him whatever they wished so we have to be careful that we don't miss what god has done brother branham made this statement many times he says it's later than you think how many times did he say that friends it's later than you think i'm wondering if it's not still later than i think it could be it could still be later than what i'm thinking we have to realize that the possibility to the disciples it was later than they were thinking they thought well elias must come first and jesus says it's later than you think eliza's already come so brother emily says this later than you think amen what's he saying he's saying it's later than you think whatever you're thinking it's later than you think you know and some people think too far so it might be earlier than you're thinking and later than i'm thinking i don't know but he said over and over and over again it's later than you think let's be aware of that friends it's later than we think amen and second corinthians chapter 4 if we could turn there together and read this scripture you know i'll just say this comment because it's on my mind and on my heart i do not want to be a bible scholar i want to be a bible believer because all the bible scholars missed him but the bible believer saw him so i do not want to be a bible scholar i want to be a bible believer i want to believe what's written of him i want to believe the manifestation in our day of what was written i want to be a believer being a bible scholar won't get you to heaven won't fulfill the promise in your life but being a bible believer will because all these things are apprehended by faith some people take great pride in being a bible scholar i say go back and look at the bible scholars in the bible that's nothing to be proud of second corinthians chapter four verse 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so there's a there's an excellency there's a treasure i'm sorry there's a treasure that's in our earthen vessels and that's the that's the that is i'm sorry let me read that again that god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god and the face of jesus christ so the glory of god is revealed in the revelation of jesus christ and we have this treasure in earthen vessels amen by what by revelation by the revelation of jesus christ amen the glory of god is revealed and we have this treasure in earth and vessels that should mean more to us than anything friends amen that should be the thing that we value the most amen is the revelation that god has given us and amen in this hour eyes to see and ears to hear amen we had brother john matthew's funeral yesterday and our celebration of life and and several of you were here but we were beginning to talk about that pearl of great price and that treasure hidden the field and and jesus is now giving the parables of the kingdom of heaven he said the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hit in the field then when a man finds it he hideth and he sells all that he has and he buys the field then he says the the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl a man of great price and a a merchant he finds it he sells all that he has that he might have that pearl amen when you realize uh what's going on what this is is this is the treasure that they've wanted all of their lives this wasn't something to make more money this wasn't that merchant wasn't looking to get this pearl to sell it he wanted the pearl to keep it and he was willing to part with all of his other merchandise to have this pearl and then the one who's found the treasure hidden in the field he was willing to part with everything else to have the treasure to buy the field to have the treasure that was in the field and we realized this is this is this is our lives if we just recognize what god has given us amen we found amen a treasure hidden in the field we found the pearl of great price amen in this day we found the revelation of the word for our day amen and it should be worth everything to us it should be greater than anything else in our lives this should be the primary thing in our lives and what we noticed in brother john matthew's life is it was the primary thing in his life because when you come to his funeral and we talked about his life amen there was there was not a lot of other things awards and accolades and accomplishments to talk about the very thing that stood out the most in brother john matthew's life is that he loved this word you all who knew him you knew i mean tell me what his hobbies were you know tell me tell me what what what what was his greatest accomplishment at work what's the most hours he ever worked in a in a week what's the great what's the biggest paycheck he ever brought home what's the most money he ever made in a year what's the thing we remember most about our brother is that he loved this word above everything else this word was not as something he does in did on the side he didn't have a job and he'd have a career and he didn't have responsibilities and he went to church that's how most of the world does it amen their religion is just a part of the caveat of their life amen it's part of the package i i do this for so many hours and i have this family and we have these activities and i have these hobbies these are my accomplishments and i go to church such and such a place that's modern christianity but that is not biblical christianity that was not the first century christians when they got a hold of this pearl of great price it was everything to them everything else was secondary including their relationships and their families that's the bible and so the primary thing in our lives amen is this revealed word amen is this revelation of this day christ amen as he's revealed to us it's the treasure we have in earthen vessels we found that the treasure is in us we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency might be of god and not of us because we didn't have anything to do with it god put that treasure there and god revealed to us what was down on the inside so our lives should reflect the you know if there's been a prophet in this day to turn the children back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers amen then we should have a faith like the original faith of the pentecostal fathers and the pentecostal fathers amen their whole life was the word amen was the word that they received the revelation of the hour amen they had caught that revelation and it was their whole life they were persecuted for it they were chased away from their homes for it they lost jobs and lost relationships amen everything else had to become secondary for this word amen so we realize that it means more to us than life it's the treasure hidden in earthen vessels the prophet of god says in the message god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same i used to just read the first half of that because it takes a long time to read that title but i think one of the most amazing parts of that is the second half of how god reveals himself we know how he hides himself but we have to be aware of how he reveals himself we can see him in the hiding and miss him in the revealing he was hidden in those disciples as they bust out of the upper room fishermen tax collectors men and women common people maybe some levels of education some no education common garb maybe some were a little better some were a little worse off it was just common people 120 common people amen but what was inside of them was the promise for that day the fulfillment of the word for that day was inside of them they had just experienced it when jesus says i will come to you amen i will come to you don't worry i will come to you and i will manifest myself to you and they said how will you manifest yourself to us and not to the world he says my father and i will come to you make her abode with you okay how will that work just wait and see here they come on the day of pentecost and christ comes in the fulfillment of his promise to them that he will return to them that he will come to them amen as the comforter as the holy ghost and he comes according to his word and now the fulfillment of the word for that day is inside of them and they come busting out they have a treasure hidden in earth and vessels amen it was hidden in the simplicity of a fisherman and a tax collector and a farmer and a whatever else but it was revealed in the same because that same ignorant fisherman is the one who stood up on the day of pentecost amen who the the the scribes testified that he was ignorant and unlearned he stood up before them and said this is the prophecy that was given to joel this is what was said this is the fulfillment of that and there must have been some other believers in the area because there was about three thousand or five thousand added to the church at the preaching of that simple vessel amen they could catch the revelation for their day and in this message he says god hides himself in a simple little wash woman or an ordinary man with his dinner under his arm kiss his wife and children goodbye and go out there and maybe hide himself in that man to do something that an archbishop would know nothing about he was doing something in peter john that caiaphas knew nothing about when he goes to question him all they're trying to do is to get him to stop preaching but they were doing something that campuses knew nothing about they were simple they were humble they didn't know how this was possible they tried to bring them amen before the sanhedrin so that they can threaten them they were trying to scare them they were trying to use you know their bully pulpit to threaten these ignorant and unlearned individuals amen and when peter come before them he was so convinced of the word for his day that he was not going to be intimidated by a high priest amen he knew who the real high priest was [Music] the high priest was living inside of him so he stood there and they said you know don't preach or teach any more in jesus name and he says you answer me is it better that we obey god or obey man well how caiaphas is going to answer that he's not going to say well you ignore god and obey man but peter was not going to be intimidated because there was something that became real to him there was a reality of the word the word it became real and now it was hidden in the simplicity of peter but it was revealed through the simplicity of peter because god doesn't need something great to reveal himself god chooses the nobody to do something great god chooses nothing to do something wonderful with because he always does it opposite to the thinking of man so he hides himself and that little man with his dinner under his arm kiss his wife and his children goodbye god can do more with through that man than the archbishop would know anything about you don't hear him blow no horns and send it out god just gets glory that's all the simple hear it and are glad how god was god was hiding himself in the simplicity of a baby hiding himself in the simplicity of a common family god and the ecclesiastics and the great men the mind the genius and all of them the herods and so forth of that day and the neros and they all overlooked it god hiding in simplicity amen they thought they could control it but they didn't realize what it was they thought it was a fisherman a couple of them they didn't realize it was god they thought they could control it but you can't control god because god's hidden and revealed in simplicity let's go back to isaiah chapter 7. isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel so here goes forth a prophecy from isaiah and that prophecy is the prophecy of emmanuel coming a virgin conceiving and bearing a son and his name will be called emmanuel let's turn over to verse 9 or chapter 9 i'm sorry chapter 9 and verse 6. and unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this this is a prophecy that they were looking for for many many many years for 700 and some years they were looking for this prophecy to be fulfilled and god when it come time to fulfill the prophecy amen because he's hidden and revealed in simplicity he's got to find a simple vessel to hide this prophecy in and a simple vessel to reveal this prophecy through because a virgin has to conceive so if he's going to pick a virgin now if you and i in ecclesiasticals of the day we're going to pick the virgin we would pick you know the number one virgin in all of israel somebody with royal blood somebody uh a dissent from judah or from the high priest or something you know something where somebody from the high priest family had married one of the king's family and they had the best of both worlds this is how the human mind wants to do things but god doesn't do that he goes and finds a nobody in no place in nazareth amen even when nathanael goes amen to speak to philip about jesus of nazareth philip even says can anything good come from nazareth so you realize the reputation of nazareth that day was not a good reputation nazareth there was nothing good that could be said or nothing good thought to come from nazareth but that so if that's the reputation of that place then that's exactly where god is going to go because he's hidden and revealed in simplicity he's going to bring this prophecy amen right through a virgin in an out of the way place amen through somebody who is nobody really in the ranks of the of the class of that day she is nobody from nowhere and nobody from nowhere amen it's the same thing he did in our day when he chose a prophet amen born in the hills in kentucky brought up in southern indiana a nobody from nowhere with a seventh grade education and he's not even got a denomination to support him what did he do he took nobody from nowhere because he's going to be hidden in that man but he's going to be revealed through that man so we see that there's a prophecy of a virgin but but then the prophecy of the child is coming from the virgin for unto us a child is born a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order and to establish it with what do you think they're looking for when they read this scripture what were they looking for friends that's why the disciples kept asking him when are you going to set up your kingdom and when will you establish your kingdom and who will sit on your right hand and who will sit on your left hand because they were looking at this with an intellectual mind and they were watching for the one to be born a meant to be wonderful counselor prince of peace the mighty god they were looking for something big and what they got was a man with no comeliness no beauty that we should behold him there was nothing special about the vessel that god would use and he wasn't born in a special place and then he was born in a not so special place amen god was using simplicity again to reveal the prophecy amen and so god was bringing forth the prophetic word exactly the way he said we do it but not anything like they thought he would do it they didn't understand that this prophecy would continue all the way through the millennium and it's the same prophecy jesus came to fulfill the prophecy he's still fulfilling this prophecy but they thought everything that's listed here will be done all at once all right now all when he comes and shows himself to the high priest and they miss that it's all the same prophecy but this prophecy will unfold over thousands of years and he was he came the way he said he would come he is the person that said would come he's exactly the fulfillment of the prophecy nothing's out of cater nothing's wrong it just doesn't match their intellectual understanding they didn't realize friends because they didn't understand the mystery that was laying in the old testament they were reading they had a bible and in that bible they were holding the bible and not even understanding what they were reading they understood the words they didn't understand what was going on in that bible or they would have realized amen that that all these christ types have a gentile bride joseph had a gentile bride i mean all the way down the line a gentile bride all coming all through the line of judah a gentile bride amen rahab was even a gentile amen in the lineage of christ they're missing the gentile woman that's inserted into the old testament and these types of christ when they come on the scene they have gentile wives and they don't realize that he cannot take the throne until he has his wife because they must sit on the throne together [Applause] and so because they're missing the mystery in the bible amen they're looking intellectually at it and they said all this will have to be fulfilled if they would have known the mystery they would have known it couldn't all be fulfilled in that day because he cannot take the place in the kingdom till he redeems his bride he cannot redeem his bride amen until he redeems her through the two thousand years of the gentile dispensation because it won't be a jewish bride it'll be a gentile bride and if you don't understand this mystery you don't understand what was going on in the old testament when they were constantly defying the word of god and taking gentile women and taking harlots and all of these things that they would take unto themselves and you're like why why would a prince and the army of israel take rahab the harlot i mean how is this god in all of his purity and his holiness why would he allow this with judah and tamar to work out why rahab amen why all of these why why why joseph amen will take an egyptian wife what what is going on this is so odd because god he's not making one mistake with one jot or one tittle there's nothing out of cater everything is exactly the way it should be and god is laying it in the scriptures amen it's all there he doesn't have to write a new bible amen it's all right there in the bible for you to see but you can't see it with the intellectual part because there was a mystery laying in there the gentile bride was all the way back through the old testament and so now when he comes amen he is refused by the jews amen that was all through the bible too and so now he gives his life to pay the price of redemption to redeem israel and to redeem his bride will be coming but he must he must have a gentile bride so they miss that he cannot fulfill this prophecy without getting a gentile bride and getting a gentile abide is part of this prophecy it's laying there right in the word so for 2 000 years he's building a bride he's building her up he's redeeming her amen the blood was shed for her amen before she would ever begin calling her and he begins to redeem her and bring her on the scene amen so that he can marry her so he can unite with her because he won't take the throne without his bride because she's predestined to be a joint heir with him you see the intellectual part can't catch it it can't catch it i mean we all want to know our bibles is that right we read and we want to understand and read and want to understand that's a godly desire there's nothing wrong with that but some man came to brother branham and said you just don't know your bible real well you know he didn't even dispute with that like i don't know the jots and the tittles and the punctuations and the greek and the hebrew and the right pronunciation of all those long names i can't pronounce all the cities and i can't always remember the bible stories in order and sometimes i get the wrong number of people killed with the wrong champion who killed them sometimes i've got a sham guard killing a thousand and and sometimes i've got samson killing 600 instead of samson killing a thousand in shamgar killing 600. and the intellectual mind is like it's not a thousand six hundred what the man under the inspiration of the holy ghost took an ox goat and killed him 600 or a thousand what's the difference brother was able to take one scripture amen one verse of scripture and he was able to tell and paint the whole picture of the scene of that day and what that judge sham guard was doing amen and all you can do is look at him and say it was it was not a thousand it was 600. no no he said when the one comes to prepare a highway he's going to make a road in the wilderness and all flesh shall be gathered to see it no no no no that man no no no that man born of that woman which we doubt her story very much that can't be him because he's going to be wonderful there was no beauty that we should behold him he was going to be the prince of peace the mighty counselor the mighty god and he's going to sit on the throne of david he's going to restore the kingdom and the increase of his kingdom will no no end forever do you see him crucified did you see him die do you think that's the fulfillment of the prophecy the disciples were like yep the intellectual mind will tell brother graham you don't know your bible really well but he says yeah but i know the author real well i know the one who wrote it and the one who wrote it is the one who can reveal it amen a priest a man a scholar a one with a pastor's degree or phd they cannot reveal the word to you because they didn't write it it's only the one who wrote it is the only one who can reveal it and so the revelation must come from the author and so we want to know our bibles we should know our bibles we should read and study our bibles but if you don't know the author all you're doing is reading words and getting an intellectual understanding that'll send you down the wrong road because that's what it's always done praise be to god that's nothing but the truth luke chapter one i wonder sometimes that we don't spend so much time dissecting the bible and studying the bible that we don't even see it like the whole story of the bible the whole purpose of redemption a restoration back to what was fallen the whole plan from beginning to end luke chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent to sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women listen before this visitation of the angel she did not know she was highly favored and she didn't know she was blessed among women she didn't know who she was i mean like she knew who she was but she didn't know who she was like she knew her birth record and she probably could go back a few generations and she knew the city she lived in and the name they called her and you know the house that she dwelt in she knew who she was but she didn't know who she was it took the visitation of an angel with a message from god to awaken her to who she really was by calling her hey hey you know you're highly favored and you're blessed arthel among women you know the first time she heard that i'm sure she was a little startled and she might have been like you're talking to me brother venom in the first seal he looks at a group of people and he says i'm going to i'm no longer going to call you church but i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand there was a group of people there and some may have been they'd all rejoice some may have understood some didn't but when i heard the tape something called me bride amen amen and it wasn't the man from kentucky amen it was the voice behind that man that was saying i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand that this prophecy is for you amen he had to come to mary so she would know this prophecy is for you and you have to know that you're the bride to know that these prophecies in the end time are for you you have to know who you are amen not not the birth record not going back a few generations not being able to say i live here my address isn't here you can send me mail here my phone number here that's not the true identity but the true identity is coming through the messenger of the age he's here to tell you i'm not going to call you church anymore because we're done with churches this is right now at the preaching of the seals we're finishing the dispensation of churches amen and we're moving into the dispensation of bride so i'm going to call you no longer church but i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand this prophecy is for you and it's for now [Applause] because if i'm going to continue calling you church like i did through the church ages you'll not understand you'll hear me preaching the seals you'll hear me talking about the lamb taking the book but if we're still in the church ages we're still under church dispensation you won't know you'll still be thinking future future future but i've got to come and give you your true identity so that you know you're the bride this is the time now all these scriptures are culminating today i no longer call you church i will call you bride so the messenger comes to her and says hell thou are highly favored and the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and out of his kingdom there shall be no and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall these this be seeing i know not a man she keeps going back to the intellectual side how will i conceive how will i have a son amen i don't even i've never known a man i'm a virgin and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she have also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her the angel came and gave her her true identity and then he gave her the word for her day he revealed to her the prophecies that were ready to be fulfilled in her and she had a question an intellectual question and he gave a non-intellectual answer how am i going to conceive she's talking nature he says the holy ghost will overshadow you he's speaking supernatural she's speaking natural he's speaking supernatural see the problem is we've always looked for the natural fulfillment and most of the time it's supernatural that's what they did with john the baptist for one to make a highway in the wilderness cut down the hills and build up the valleys amen make the crooked places straight they were looking for a natural fulfillment it was a spiritual fulfillment amen and now in her she's looking for natural ability to conceive and he's showing her supernatural ability to conceive and after he's done speaking to her he does not touch her reasoning because what he tells her is not reasonable nobody had ever conceived and brought forth a baby not knowing a man what he told her was impossible according to science what he told her was inconceivable it could not work amen he didn't appeal to her reasoning here he was a messenger from almighty god just telling her that this is the word that's going to be fulfilled in you and he cannot intellectually explain it to her he just tells her what it was but something in this exchange happens to her where there's something on the inside of her that can just say be it unto me according to thy word i accept what you say i receive what you say amen there has to be a counterpart in every prophecy there has to be the one where jesus comes along and he tells his disciples come follow me but there has to be the disciple that will actually drop his net and go and follow god is always looking for the one who will bring the prophecy and the one amen who will surrender to the prophecy the one who will bring the word and the one who will submit to the word and so now he brings to mary her position her identity and her portion of the word the portion of the word to be fulfilled in her amen and she can the reasoning just went right out the window how will it happen the holy ghost overshadow you the thing conceived in you shall be oh my how that doesn't answer how scientifically but it answers how and somehow that answer was good enough for this virgin hey man her education was not in reasoning her education was not an intellect her education was in faith to believe the word of god and she said be an unto me according to thy word now after that exchange she now conceives and within her there is a life and that life is the life of the word it's the messiah it's the prophecy the word is now inside of her growing and moving she's changing her appetite's changing her desires are changing her physical form is changing everything about her is now changing amen and now you know she goes forth from there and she's got a lot of difficult things to talk about with people she is under the care of parents she's got to explain to them what happened she's a spouse to a man to be married she has to explain to him that what happened i mean this wasn't something that she was able to keep hidden friends what happened to her quickly become manifested amen and she begins to declare and first she goes and tells her cousin elizabeth but elizabeth has already been awakened to the spiritual fulfillment of prophecy and elizabeth is another woman that's able to catch the prophecy coming from this woman and she tells her and elizabeth starts prophesying and then mary starts prophesying what's happening inside both of these women is the word amen john the baptist the fulfillment of the word inside mary the fulfillment of the word and when the word is inside these women they stand up and begin to prophesy that's why amen and in revelation chapter 10 you come down to first seven there's an end time prophet that's got to come on the scene to prophesy but there's a little group that has to take and eat the book amen the ones that he said i no longer call church but i call you bride now you've got to take this same book and eat it amen and you've got to go and prophesy again why because when the word is in the woman the woman begins to prophesy [Applause] we saw it all the way in the beginning of the new testament friends and we find it all the way at the end of the new testament this is in the word our day is in the word our manifestation is in the word amen this is the word it's laid there in mystery form the intellects couldn't catch it they didn't understand what was happening when when elizabeth was prophesying and mary was a prophesying they missed the whole point they didn't realize what it was when john took and ate the book and prophesied again they didn't realize that these two things are connected together but we don't need the intellectual idea we need the revelation that gives us eyes to see and when you have eyes to see there's no problem seeing what's going on you know from that moment on it didn't matter how many people tried to convince mary that that child was not immaculately conceived can you imagine the discussions now mary just okay we heard your story no seriously tell me the truth [Music] do you think people have changed any mary now listen you've played your little game long enough somebody's probably deceived you it's probably not your fault i'm sure you were in a trap somebody's just deceived you but it's okay just tell me what really happened you could not talk her out of it there's nothing you can do to convince her otherwise the angel came to her gave her the identification the holy ghost overshadowed her the thing that was formed in her was formed supernaturally inside of her and she knew it you could not talk her out of it amen it was the experience that she had and she began to grow and the talk was around the town maybe not so nice and maybe it wasn't always just whispered maybe it was loud enough she could overhear maybe when she would go to fetch water at the well the other women would snubber they would they would not look at her well they rumors were moving around and she would hear amen the ripple of them as they moved about and every once in a while catch the word amen and no doubt it had an effect on her emotional side and she probably didn't like it and it was probably a discouragement to her but no matter what was happening she could not deny what was going on inside of her that she was carrying this prophecy amen it wasn't her anymore it was what she had received and now what she had received was taking over and she couldn't stop it from growing amen she couldn't stop it from changing her life she couldn't stop it from changing everything and the very things she received amen which was the word of the lord is the very thing that brought her persecution the very word that she received in faith is the very thing that caused her persecution do you think anything's changed but you can't talk mary out of her experience you can't change her mind on the prophecy you think anybody could give her another interpretation of a virgin shall conceive can you imagine her going to church next sunday and she's sitting there and the scripture reading for that day the priest he stands up and he reads isaiah chapter 7 and a virgin count conceived and he starts to give his ideas we know that the nation of israel is a great virgin and we know that she's the wife of jehovah god and jegovah god is going to bring out of this nation the prophecy and she's sitting there going nope that ain't it [Applause] amen she may not have had an education she may not have been able to read amen she may have never been had the same level of bible understanding that this theologian and his robe had reading the scroll that day she may have never handled the scroll herself but she knew more than that preacher knew because that prophecy was inside of her and nobody could explain that scripture different to her she knew what that scripture meant that that scripture means a virgin shall conceive and a virgin's conceived and this is the virgin and this is the seed [Applause] she could have stood in church and told them all and they would have laughed her the scorn and run her out and forbid her to come back but it would have been the truth nonetheless it didn't matter how many of them accepted it how many of them denied it it wouldn't change the fulfillment of the word the fulfillment of the word is the fulfillment of the word whether we like it or don't like it whether we agree with it or don't agree with it whether they think it's true or we think it's false it doesn't change the fulfillment of the word is the fulfillment of the word what was happening in her was isaiah 7 coming to life and she was now the word made manifest for that day she was that virgin so she was the word made manifest for her day and to reject that was to reject the word of god but i learned in school who cares what you learned in school but i've always thought who cares what you always thought we all thought something i mean i don't know how many of you just i mean gave your heart to the lord and poof you got all the prophecies lined up right you you knew it all first time you heard the message i read the seals i got it talk to me after church we all had it wrong we all were taught somewhere else we all had our own thinking and remember when the prophecy becomes the manifestation for us when it becomes a revelation amen then nobody can talk you out of that scripture because it's alive right here inside of me i'm not waiting for that to happen that's already happened you're too late can you imagine mary oh my after jesus is born they're still going to synagogue friends they're still going up and 12 years old they took him up to the feast and they forgot him and left him there that's how we know they were going to the feast can you imagine going to the feast and the scripture reading for the day when jesus is 12 years old a virgin shall conceive oh god we're looking for the fulfillment of this word amen someday someday someday you'll fulfill this in a virgin bring the virgin oh god someday someday they didn't know that some day was their day they didn't know that they were too late on that prophecy amen it had already come to fulfillment it already come into manifestation a virgin had already conceived and delivered the promised child praise be to god friends amen oh i hope the angel has told you who you are amen and i hope you had something in you say be it unto me according to your word let's turn to john chapter 9. we know this story super well there was a man that was born blind and jesus healed him when he was born blind the pharisees began to question him who healed you how were you made whole and they kept questioning him in john chapter 9 verse 24 says then then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner oh praise god you know what they can't deny the fact that he can see there's a manifestation and they can't deny the manifestation so they can't deny that this man sees he's seeing he's looking at them you know you're wearing this color you're sitting here i mean you can't deny that the man sees but they say now give glory to god amen that man you say healed you he's a sinner don't trust him don't listen to him don't miss what's happened he's a sinner and the man was born blind he was born blind jesus comes to him and he says do you desire to see say yea lord he he he spits in clay and makes clay rubs in his eyes and tells him to go wash i believe that's the story amen and he goes wash and he comes seeing and comes rejoicing they begin to question him they question his parents they can't accept amen what they're seeing they cannot accept what's standing in front of them and here they're they're trying to talk him out of his miracle they're trying to move him into unbelief now you give glory to god this man that healed you he's a sinner we know that this we know that this man is a sinner how do you know who made you god because he healed on the sabbath you call him a sinner because he he did something different than your traditional understanding by your church tradition now you're calling this man a sinner by your church tradition there was a man who was born blind and all the history of the world nobody ever hid healed anybody that was born blind this is what this man tells the pharisees it's never been heard of that one would heal one that was born blind and they're looking at the manifestation and they're condemning it because they're trying to match this manifestation with their doctrinal understanding by traditional teaching and their church tradition is causing them to reject what they're looking at and now by their tradition they cannot see what isn't standing in front of them and say we know that this man is a sinner he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know that one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see you say whatever you want to say you call him whatever you want to call him you can call brother ben i'm a false prophet you can say he got off at the end you can say that he didn't know his bible real well you can say anything you want to say but i'll say this whether he was right or wrong or whatever you want to say this one thing i know where i was spiritually blind i now conceived i was denominationally blind i was blind by the tradition of the father i could not see the bible that i was reading i did not understand the words that were coming into my mind amen but through this messenger amen god has brought a revelation that i can now see where i was blind i now see you calling false prophet that's between you and god but where i was blind now i see you can you imagine trying to convince this man out of his healing and he's walking over here and he's seeing grass and he's seeing sky and he's seeing the temple and he's seeing things that he had felt all along the path all of his life and he's looking right at it and they're saying this man of cinema they have no idea what they're talking about they're trying to talk him out of his healing talk him out of the miracle make the very hand that god used an evil or wicked hand amen but they missed the fact that the man can see he was born blind and i come into this world born blind spiritually blind under spiritual amnesia amen but under this ministry which was none other than the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself he touched me and he opened my eyes and now i see the seven seal mystery back in genesis when you look at genesis when god made man and out of man he took his wife and he united the two together in his great masterpiece i can see it now [Applause] when i see why rahab the harlot had to marry into judah amen and start bethlehem i see it now why deborah had to be the fourth prophetess and providence had to be the fourth judge in israel i see it now you say whatever you want but where i was blind now i see you can believe what you want you can say anything you want can you imagine can you imagine this man he's walking down and he's heard the gurgling of a stream he walked by it every day he could feel how cool it was but he never saw how beautiful it was and he wanted to know what it looked like of course but now he sees it and they say give glory to god that man's a sinner i'm looking at the stream the temple i used to walk up to and pray for my healing i'm touching the stone i'm seeing the stone the horn i used to hear blow to bring us to prayer i'm looking at the man below the horn call him what you want call him what you want but where i was blind now i see tell me who could make that man unsee once god opened his eyes who could make that man unsee he could see every day he woke up he could see everywhere he looked he could see he could just see that's why when god has opened our eyes to this ministry his ministry the ministry of the son of man he's opened our eyes and we can see every day you listen to a tape you can see you read your bible you can see you hear the preaching of the word you can see who cares what anybody says call him a sinner whether he is sinner or not whatever you want to say but i know one thing i could not see my bible now i see it amen it was discombobulated it was old testament new testament 66 different books it was confusing because this part didn't match this part and i didn't understand why they did that there and why they did this here but where i was blind now i see you can say what you want about this message but it's christ and you know what i'm not offended whatever you say it's okay because i see like can you imagine the man oh praise god he leaves the council for him it's kind of comical he said i've told you once i'll tell you again why do you ask do you want to be his disciple we're moses disciple they're offended they're all upset he's the one who can see they're blind he can see they're now blind he can see they're confused by his vision he's confused by their blindness they can't even speak the same language can you imagine him walking away from there i don't think he was mad it's my personal opinion i don't think by the way he exchanged with him i don't think he was angry i think he walked out of there and saw the door he was walking out and saw the road he was walking on he saw the blue sky when he got outside and saw his mother and father for the first time and i i don't think he was upset he came out on top if you can see if god has given you ice have to see if you've been in the laodicean age and he says buy of me i have amen gold tried in the fire if you've gone to him and got the isab that opened your eyes that you can see and you've got the white raiment and you've got the gold in your pocket amen why do you care what anybody says about it i can see i've got the garment i've got the gold jingling in my pockets i don't care what you say [Applause] i mean like i can be greed for you i can be disheartened because you're you don't see it i can be confused by your blindness but you're not going to get me to unseat i'm not going to take the gold out of my pocket and drop it on the ground because you say this is a false prophet and he got off at the end and he doesn't know his bible okay that's not a white garment that's not real gold and you can't really see you weren't really impregnated by a visitation of holy ghost you were with a man if that's what you want to believe she knew the truth so i don't understand this getting angry and getting upset because somebody else doesn't believe i think we should enjoy our vision i think we should just move on and be happy about what we can see praise god god is so good friends prophet of god said in the message trying to do god a service without it being god's will so now he reveals these things by his foreknowledge to those who he has ordained to these things otherwise they don't see it standing right there looking right at it and he can't see it how many ever seen the picture of a cow in the bush that you just have to look and look did you ever see that or see the picture of christ in a bush or in a sky or clouds and the painter has got it that's so fixed up until you have to look at it just a certain way well then when you once see it you can't see nothing else but that every time you look there it is how many seen those pictures well sure you have well that's the way christ is himself the gospel the message when you once see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that listen friends when god opens the book and you see the plan of redemption and you see all the loose ends tied together you can't see nothing else take away the message and everything the messenger brought us and you explained to me why there had to be a blood sacrifice why did a human have to die and why wasn't the lamb good enough how many gods are there three persons equal one god or just one god why did he have to be virgin born i think sometimes we don't realize how much we see how clear our vision is how much the book's been opened to us how much this message has taken us from blindness to vision to clear vision getting clear and clear all the time friends amen you tell me he's wrong brother ben was wrong about that serpent seed okay i mean you do whatever you have to do to make it work but when you see you see i mean you can't go blind again he was wrong about the godhead all right you make three personalities and three persons in one and not make it an oddity or a psychological disorder multiple personalities i think still the cycle i don't know most everything's okay now but they probably get employment preferences now for diversity but see once you see you can never go back to blindness once you see you can never unsee and you're reading the same scriptures you read all your life but now you see the man was walking the same path he walked all the lights but now he sees amen he's going to the same places but now he sees he's touching the same thing but now he sees and now we're reading the same bible but now we see we see we see we see once you see the message there's nothing else you can see but that they say what about those who've left the message they never saw it oh we saw it no you never saw it like you saw doctrines and teachings and caught the intellectual part of reading and taking that and tying it to scripture and putting together and you were able to read and you were able to listen to somebody tie some points together and it made it reasonable and so like water baptism in jesus name brother bram said doesn't even take a revelation like somebody can tie that together and you can recognize that the bible bap in the bible they baptize in jesus name but if you ever really see the message you recognize that this message is christ see once you really see the message and you know the message is christ then you can't leave christ now if you see the message and the messages doctrines and teachings you can leave the message of doctrines and teachings but once you see christ how can you leave christ why would you leave christ the prophet says judas couldn't understand it he walked right with him he didn't see it i liked that one try to tell judas he didn't see it try to convince him he didn't understand the ministry of jesus christ tried to get judas to believe that he didn't see jesus i saw him every day i was his treasurer i carried the money back come here come here come here you tell this man that i was jesus treasurer yeah he was jesus treasurer and i went with him everywhere yeah i saw him go see i knew jesus you never knew him you saw but you didn't see because the seeing jesus was talking about was not the seeing with these eyes but it was seen with these eyes and the seeing that matters in the scriptures is the seeing with these eyes not these eyes how many people saw noah's boat what was that the fulfillment of the word of god the manifestation of the word of god what was it salvation for that day how many saw did you see the boat i saw the boat but they never saw what the boat was they thought it was some crazy man's idea they thought it was a eccentric man with an eccentric project they thought it was some novelty some something to go and laugh about they didn't see what it was but they saw it judah saw jesus but he didn't know jesus or he would have never left him he walked right with him but judas didn't see it i'm not going to get finished so i'm not even going to try let's go to revelation chapter 5. verse 1 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne into the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne john saw a book in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and we know that this is the book of redemption the title deed to all creation and it was sealed with seven seals and there was a cry from a strong angel that said who was worthy to open the book and no man in heaven had to be a man because redemption was paid for by a man now to take the claims of redemption must be a man because man lost the title deed it's got to be restored by man because once you see you see no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on brother bam said why was john weeping in the message i think it's the breach he says somebody said john was weeping because he wasn't worthy he said anybody with the holy ghost would know better than that he said john was weeping because that was the title deed to all creation that was the book of redemption if there was no kinsmen redeemer to come forth and take the book if nobody was found worthy then all creation would be lost jesus christ at this point had already come and paid the price the blood was already shed which purchased back all of creation he already shed the blood that would purchase everything that was lost he already paid the redemptive price but there was two parts to redemption first he must pay the redemption price then after he paid the redemption price at the right time he must make redemption claims and although the redemption price was paid in a.d 33 amen christ has been sitting on the throne in his mediator work of intercession amen waiting until he's got a bride that's ready to take the throne and after he's got a bride that's ready to take the throne now he can come forth as kinsman redeemer and take the book that he's purchased in between paying the price of redemption and claiming the book amen he's building himself a bride through seven church ages one that will sit on the throne with him and rule amen with him for a thousand years there will be a joint heir with him and so now although the redemption price was paid the blood was shed and the blood was thorough the blood was sufficient the price was paid here is john looking at a scene in heaven with a book in the in the hand of the original owner and a cry goes is there any man that can take the book and no man was found worthy he begins to weep amen he's weeping but there's already blood been shed so something else has to happen for redemption amen the blood was shed but john's weeping i hope you understand friends amen we get stuck in denominational ideas and everybody wants to to go back and go back and go back but god's doing something now he did what he did then to make a way for what he's doing now he had 2 000 years ago to pay the price of redemption to shed his own blood which was the blood of god which was the exchange price for that book of redemption but he wouldn't come and claim it till after the seven church ages and then at the end of the seven church ages he's going to stick forward and claim what he's paid for and claim what he's mediated for and john comes to this point amen in the vision and he sees him sitting on the throne with the book of redemption in his hand and john is weeping but you say look at calvary i've looked at calvary i was john was standing at calvary this is the same man that was standing at calvary and jesus looked down and said woman my son son thy mother same john john was standing at calvary he knew the blood was shed he saw him in his resurrection he knew that he was the resurrection in the life he was there at pentecost when the baptism of the holy ghost came down he knew all of that story but here he stands in revelation chapter 5 and he's weeping because all redemption will be lost if does somebody doesn't come and take that book amen people want to reject the prophet they want to reject the end time prophecy you're rejecting your own redemption amen you're rejecting the fulfillment of everything jesus died for everything he's interceded for for seven church ages you want to reject this message and reject the opening of the seals you're rejecting your own redemption if you don't believe the lamb has taken the book you better start weeping like john was weeping because you've been lifted up to see what john saw that there's a book that needs to be opened it's the book of redemption you heard the prophet say it and now you're looking at this book of redemption you don't have any place to rejoice if it's not open yet you should be weeping and mourning hoping that somebody will come forth and take that book [Applause] but when john was weeping one of the elders i wonder which elder there's 24 choices 12 of them are apostles and 12 of them are patriarchs one of the 12 apostles is john i don't know which one it was so don't ask me but i have my own thoughts on it and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judas the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof stop weeping because the kinsman redeemer's coming forth and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne unto the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth on all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of the odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation it has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i whose eye john the one who was weeping heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever all john's mourning turned into rejoicing amen john what moved john from morning to rejoicing one thing he saw the lamb take the book amen and when he saw the lamb took the book he now knew we've come to the fullness of redemption there's a kinsman redeemer on the scene to take the book and loose the seals now i don't have to weep anymore now it's rejoicing my question to you is if you've seen the lamb take the book do not think intellectually don't think naturally and don't use these eyeballs because judas used these eyeballs and he missed the fulfillment of the word amen but peter used a different set of eyes and he caught that this is christ the son of the living god it wasn't these eyes that told him it wasn't this mind that told him but he had another source of gathering information amen he had another kind of seeing about him and by revelation he saw that this was the son of the living god i ask you are you mourning or rejoicing is all lost and still weighing in the balance for you hoping that someday it will work out are you on this end saying my redeemer liveth and he standeth upon the earth in the last day and i know that everything i've lost has been restored back to me i've already got it it's already done it's already finished the seals are already open i don't have anything to mourn about all i have to do is be excited and rejoice he's turned our mourning into gladness amen he's turned our sadness into joy but brother chad we still have to go to work and we still have to pay bills and amen what do you think they did after pentecost after pain what was pentecost the fulfillment of the word after the fulfillment of the word that came there was a manifestation of the word they became the manifestation they became the living word for their day and what did they have to do go to work bake some bread preach the gospel get arrested well i thought at the fulfillment of the word everything would work out right it was working out right the word was being filled it was supernaturally being fulfilled and fleshed down in flesh and people were still abusing them throwing stones at them calling them names chasing them out of jerusalem scattering them to other places but i thought you said this was the promise being fulfilled it is the promise being fulfilled but we still get sick we still had somebody die we had a funeral the other day i don't understand peter you said you said that he's the resurrection and the life and the resurrection in life has come back to us it has but it is a spiritual fulfillment not a natural fulfillment it's a spiritual fulfillment manifesting in the natural fulfillment but they were still subject to elements of rain of hunger of sickness of disease of peril of stoning of persecutions of chasing from city to city having to work for their meat when they were in prison and god needed him out he opened the doors he took him out but when paul went in prison god didn't need him out he needed him in prison so he could write the epistles and testify in rome so paul couldn't open the prison doors it wasn't about them having power to say i won't be arrested at all eating no no more rain on me it rained on paul in his journey he was caught in the middle of a terrible storm for 14 days he was shipwrecked he spent a night in the day in the sea but i thought he was the prophet for the age i thought he was the fulfillment of the prophecy in isaiah that he would be a light to the gentiles the fulfillment of the word should always be like super powerful super great and nothing bad should ever happen to the fulfillment of the word paul every day he was walking he was isaiah's prophecy in flesh a light to lighten the gentiles but he would still be taken out of the city and stoned and left for dead they would still spit on him and mock him and make fun of him he would still be hungry he would still be shipwrecked he would be lied about he'd be cheated on he would be he would be praised and acclaimed he would still be living in this dimension but manifesting a reality from another dimension the word made flesh i say it's time for us to rejoice if your eyes have seen the lamb take the book oh have you seen the lamb take the book has he opened the seals how do you know i heard the thunders amen i heard the voice of god i heard the unspoken part of the word amen the word was put in that prophet's hand that word was sent down to him now it's been given to me i've ate it i'm one with it i'm prophesying again there's nothing for me to be sad about i'm rejoicing because he's here claiming me i'm what he was dying for i'm the one he was interceding for i'm the manifestation of the bride for this day amen he's here he's in me this is the hour he's taken the book he's loosed the seals i didn't see it i did did you see it oh if you heard the thunders you saw it friends if you knew what happened you saw it amen the book has been opened and you saw it now you're not reading from a closed book you're reading from an open book because you see it oh praise god do you see where we put ourselves in this end time ministry if we leave the book closed and leave it sealed amen you've got to go back to mourning and weeping and praying for a kinsman redeemer but the kinsmen redeemer has come the seals have opened the thunders have sounded redemption is coming in fullness he's here claiming his bride you're the inheritance he's claiming today i thought we would have power you do have power when god needs to do something say something pray something speak something you're the tool he's using and anything that will stand in the way of that will go it'll be exactly like it was after pentecost what are you looking for in the fulfillment of this word we've already seen it there we're looking for a mighty people that everything they say comes to pass twitch their finger and dinner shows up how about a people who have eyes to see and hears to hear and can see christ in their day what about those who were born blind but now they see how about those that can rejoice and can sing he's opened the book and he's loosed the seals how many can say i've had the experience i've ate the book because i know it's sweet in the mouth i tasted and i saw that the lord is good and it was sweet amen but i know what it's like for it to be bitter in the belly i've experienced i'm not reading revelation 10 8-11 i'm living revelation 10 8-11 i have ate the book what book did you eat stop thinking natural i ate the book it was sweet in my mouth if you've ever eaten the book you know how sweet it is in your life how precious every bite is how it keeps you wanting to come back for more but you also know when digestion kicks in and you become one with that word and it brings a change and a reproach and it brings a ridicule and a separation you know what it's like for it to be bitter in the belly oh god give us eyes to see may we all see that the lamb has taken the book and he's loosed the seven seals thereof evidenced by the sounding of the thunders and by god's grace that book has come down to me and the very thing that john wasn't allowed to look at or even to look upon or to read is the very thing that we're feeding on this isn't the hour of mourning this is the hour of rejoicing this isn't the hour of looking forward this is the hour of recognizing your day and its message we've got to stop kicking the can down the road and pick up this book and enjoy what god has given to us amen go out and live happy and free knowing that this is the hour of the fullness of redemption and he's working the last of his redemption through the gentiles in your flesh right now just as much as paul the apostle was the word made flesh in his day with whatever he had to do amen you're just as much the word made flesh for your day going through whatever you're going through let us see with another set of eyes where once i was blind now i see you can say whatever you want about the message and the messenger this one thing i know i was blind but now i see i've seen the lamb take the book and loose the seals when john was a shouting and carrying on he's not the only one that was shouting and carrying on because i'm pretty happy about what i saw too and i'm pretty happy about what i've been feeding on to and i'm pretty thankful to god for the day and the hour they live in i'm not waiting we're here the kinsmen redeemer's taking the book he's here he's claiming his redemption if you're his redemption he come to claim you and unite with you in an invisible union i say rejoice rejoice rejoice this is the time of rejoicing for the bride has made herself ready the wedding of the lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready rejoice this is the season of rejoicing be happy for what we see praise be to god i'm not going to preach anymore i'm happy see musicians and brother blake can come let's just sing friends let's rejoice let's be thankful let's be happy let's stop twirling our thumbs and and and waiting for some great thing to happen oh someday there's something wonderful is going to happen and we're going to get out of here he's getting you out of here word by word he's lifting you up word by word revelation by revelation clearing our vision amen we've got to stop waiting for something because when we're waiting for something we're not rejoicing in what we have we're not feeding on what's in our hand we're not seeing what we're looking at it's time to rejoice and be happy and thank god for he's taken the book and he's loosed the seven seals thereof and my redemption is no longer a mystery it's a revelation my position is no longer a mystery it's a revelation who i am is no longer a mystery it's a revelation my place in the word is no longer a mystery it's a revelation and for that i thank god let's just stand and let's just worship the lord let's just all pray together but let's not pray a solemn prayer hang our heads and wishing something would change amen but let's raise our hands and thank god for what has changed let's just all pray in our own way oh thank you almighty god i thank you and appreciate you god for taking the book and losing the seals and giving me eyes to see what you've done in this day god multitudes are blind i was walking in blindness i was born blind but this one thing i know where i was blind i now see and it's all by your grace we give you glory and honor almighty god we worship your name may there be a shout coming from our hearts just like was coming in the throne room the day you took the book lord for when we see you take it we shout like john shouted may all heaven and everything in heaven and everything on earth and everything under the earth hear me chad lamb say glory and honor and might and power be to god and to the lamb that sitteth upon the throne forever and ever praise be to god oh god you're worthy of our praise you're so wonderful you're so mighty amen you're so precious to us oh god we praise you may we live our lives for you lord may we surrender afresh to you may we with joy amen walk this walk you've given us to walk with gratitude for being the final voice in the final age god you're the kinsman redeemer and you're here among us claiming your redemption oh thank you father if there's anyone in here who hasn't recognized you as the kinsmen redeemer that hasn't recognized you here in your claiming ministry you're here to claim them lord i pray god that they would under the preaching of the word amen under your voice that they would say be it unto
