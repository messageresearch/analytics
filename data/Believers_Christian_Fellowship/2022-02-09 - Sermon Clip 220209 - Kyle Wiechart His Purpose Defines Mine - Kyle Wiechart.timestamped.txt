[0:00] the promises of god they're just our
[0:02] food
[0:03] it's just everyday living oh so god
[0:05] works a miracle in your life and heals
[0:07] you that's just everyday living for the
[0:09] believer
[0:10] oh god heals your sick child that's just
[0:13] everyday living for the believer there's
[0:15] benefits to being in christ don't ever
[0:17] deny your benefits when i get a job or
[0:19] somebody gets a job first thing you do
[0:21] you check the benefit plan what all's in
[0:23] here health care dental great when you
[0:26] became a christian you know what all
[0:28] heaven is backing up the promises of god
[0:30] for you
[0:31] all heaven is there
[0:33] every bit of heaven is there to back up
[0:35] every promise but you've got to believe
[0:37] it you've got to take him at his word
[0:39] you can't be a drifting just say well
[0:41] god wants to give me healing i don't
[0:44] sound like the woman who touched the hem
[0:45] of his garment
[0:46] that don't sound like the woman that sat
[0:48] there at the table and said i'll even
[0:49] eat the crumbs that fall off the table
[0:52] they don't sound like the same they
[0:53] don't ring the same to me there's a
[0:55] perseverance there's a boldness in the
[0:57] bride of jesus christ to see to it that
[0:59] every promise in the book
[1:01] it's mine you don't want it that's fine
[1:03] let your unbelief keep it from you but
[1:05] by god's grace may he raise the faith
[1:07] that's in my heart to take every promise
[1:09] that he promised peace healing joy
[1:11] satisfaction i don't care what it is
[1:13] whatever promise that that bible has
[1:15] declared is for the believer it's mine
[1:18] problems in the home problems in the
[1:20] marriage it doesn't matter he's more
[1:22] than able to solve that problem too
[1:24] but i have to believe him i have to call
[1:26] jesus on the scene i have to awaken him
[1:30] and not sit there and complain about it
[1:32] can you imagine do you see why god had
[1:34] to rebuke moses and say why are you
[1:36] crying unto me speak the word and move
[1:38] forward everything you had needed for
[1:40] this earth journey i gave it to you stop
[1:43] crying all the time realize what's in
[1:44] your hand and walk
[1:46] but you have to speak it you have to
[1:48] take the word put it on your lips speak
[1:50] the word and move forward
