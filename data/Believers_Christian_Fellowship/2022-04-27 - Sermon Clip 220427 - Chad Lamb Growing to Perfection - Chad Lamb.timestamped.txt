[0:00] it helps to know what we're here for
[0:03] it helps to know what god's doing in our
[0:05] lives
[0:06] why the tribe
[0:08] without this kind of understanding that
[0:10] the prophet gave us then our life is
[0:13] just a bunch of difficult circumstances
[0:15] string together amen we can't wait to
[0:17] get out of here i just want to die and
[0:18] go to the sixth dimension because we
[0:20] don't understand what god is doing the
[0:23] father wants to bring us into a position
[0:25] amen he wants to place us in the
[0:27] inheritance in the kingdom and he wants
[0:30] us to speak like he would speak on this
[0:32] earth
[0:33] he wants us to lay hands on the sick and
[0:35] pray for him he wants us to speak he
[0:37] wants us to share the word he wants us
[0:39] to give the revelation he wants us to
[0:41] prophesy again
[0:44] he wants us to speak
[0:47] but if you don't know what's going on
[0:49] you say well i believe the message i
[0:51] receive the baptism the holy ghost
[0:52] praise god and then the rest of our life
[0:54] is
[0:56] is aimless the rest of our life is
[0:59] confusion the rest of our life is we
[1:01] have good days and then we have bad days
[1:03] and we don't understand the bad days but
[1:04] we thank god for the good days and we
[1:06] always pray for another good day and
[1:07] then something bad happens and we're
[1:09] like why is all this bad stuff happening
[1:11] to me because we don't realize that
[1:13] you've been ordained predestinated unto
[1:16] adoption you've been predestined to have
[1:19] every virtue of christ flowing in your
[1:21] life and flowing out from you and he's
[1:23] got to put it to the test so that you
[1:25] learn the lesson so that he can draw out
[1:27] the virtue
[1:29] and without this teaching our life
[1:32] becomes just
[1:33] life
[1:35] just routine broke up by a few
[1:38] highlights and some difficult things we
[1:40] cry sometimes and we laugh sometimes and
[1:42] not in the understanding that god wants
[1:45] a people on this earth that'll speak
[1:46] like he speaks act like he lacks be
[1:48] whatever he is she will be him amen this
[1:53] is the age of adoption and he has
[1:54] brought the church unto adoption under
[1:57] this ministry
[1:59] now as individuals he wants us to come
[2:01] to the same place
[2:04] but we have to know what's going on
[2:07] what did he save me for why did i
[2:09] receive the holy ghost what was my
[2:11] experience with him even about
[2:16] it's because he wants another messiah on
[2:18] this earth
