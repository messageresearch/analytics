[13:58] these brothers
[13:59] and we're very much looking forward to
[14:00] that and we appreciate your prayers
[14:03] man let's look at romans chapter 1
[14:06] and verse 16.
[14:10] romans 1 and 16 for i am not ashamed of
[14:13] the gospel of christ for it is the power
[14:15] of god unto salvation
[14:17] to everyone that believeth to the jew
[14:19] first and also to the greek
[14:22] for therein is the righteousness of god
[14:24] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[14:26] written
[14:26] the just shall live by faith you can all
[14:30] have your seeds
[14:32] i would like to take a little bit of
[14:33] time as the lord wills this morning and
[14:35] speak on the greatest sense
[14:37] which we know is faith or the sixth
[14:39] sense but the greatest sense
[14:41] and brother brim says and why it had to
[14:44] be shepherds from 1964
[14:46] he says now that same thing was here
[14:48] when adam was here
[14:50] television was here when elijah sat on
[14:52] mount carmel it was here
[14:54] when martin luther that young priest
[14:56] throw the communion on the floor
[14:58] and said it's kosher and the just shall
[15:00] live by faith
[15:01] it was here then but we are just now
[15:03] finding him and it's also so
[15:05] that in our presence tonight is god
[15:07] angels supernatural beings that's unseen
[15:10] to our natural sense of sight
[15:12] but someday it will be a reality just as
[15:14] television is now
[15:16] and just as common now that is why i
[15:18] believe the word
[15:20] brother branham is now he's he's looking
[15:23] beyond this dimension
[15:25] and he's he's using a type of of a
[15:27] scientific discovery of television
[15:30] and said the television was here back
[15:32] then amen because
[15:34] the light waves were here the light
[15:35] waves that went out were here
[15:37] they just found a way to collect it
[15:39] transmit it and and re
[15:41] reposition it or redisplay it but it was
[15:44] already here
[15:45] and he says so is also god is here
[15:49] the angels are here supernatural beings
[15:51] are here in
[15:52] one day it'll be just as common as
[15:54] television is now
[15:57] he says it again in who is this
[15:58] melchizedek it says
[16:00] a theophany is something that you could
[16:01] not see it could be right here now
[16:03] yet you cannot see it it's just like
[16:06] well like television
[16:08] that's in another dimension television
[16:10] people are moving right through this
[16:11] room now
[16:12] singing there is colors also but the eye
[16:15] is only subject to the five senses
[16:17] your whole being is only subject to five
[16:19] senses rather and you are only subject
[16:21] to what the site
[16:22] has been limited to see i love that
[16:25] you're you're you're subject to what the
[16:27] site has been limited to see
[16:30] that means this site is limited
[16:33] and if this site is limited i would not
[16:36] put a whole lot of value or stock in a
[16:38] sense that is limited
[16:41] amen so let's let's keep going
[16:45] he says your whole being is only subject
[16:49] to the senses rather
[16:51] and you are only subject to what the
[16:53] site has been limited to see
[16:54] but there is another dimension that can
[16:56] be seen by a transformation by
[16:58] television
[16:59] now television does not manufacture a
[17:01] picture television only channels it into
[17:03] a circuit
[17:04] and then the television screen picks it
[17:05] up but the picture is there to begin
[17:08] with
[17:09] television was here when adam was here
[17:11] television was here when elijah said on
[17:12] mount carmel television was here when
[17:14] jesus of nazareth walked the shores of
[17:16] galilee
[17:16] but you're just now discovering it they
[17:19] would they wouldn't have believed it
[17:20] back there
[17:21] you'd have been crazy to have said
[17:23] something like it but now it's become a
[17:25] reality
[17:27] so in that day years ago if you would
[17:29] have tried to explain television
[17:32] collect a picture transpire transfer it
[17:34] wirelessly
[17:35] and to a receiver pick it up and show
[17:37] the same picture that happened
[17:38] thousands of miles away show it again
[17:41] they would have thought you were crazy
[17:43] but now it's just become common
[17:46] and they're spiritual things that for
[17:48] generations have been considered crazy
[17:51] there are understandings that we have
[17:53] revelations that have come to us in this
[17:55] day
[17:56] of who we are and our position in christ
[17:58] and what's going on all around us
[17:59] then in previous days they would have
[18:01] thought you were crazy to talk that way
[18:03] amen but now we know it to be a reality
[18:05] amen it becomes common to us
[18:07] not by eyesight these i see but the see
[18:10] the seeing that comes from the great
[18:12] sense of faith allows us to see beyond
[18:15] the limitation of the eyes
[18:20] he says it goes on to say but you were
[18:22] just now discovering it they wouldn't
[18:24] have believed it back there
[18:25] you'd have been crazy to have said
[18:26] something like that but now it's become
[18:28] reality
[18:29] and so it so is it that christ is here
[18:32] the angels of god are here and someday
[18:34] in the great millennium to come it'll be
[18:36] just
[18:37] more real than television or anything
[18:38] else because they
[18:40] are here he reveals himself in his great
[18:43] form of what he claimed
[18:45] as he morphs himself into his servants
[18:48] and proves himself i want to read that
[18:51] again
[18:52] he reveals himself in his great form of
[18:55] what he claimed
[18:57] he's revealing himself in his great form
[18:59] of what he claimed
[19:00] what did he claim he claimed a bride
[19:03] and now he's revealing himself in the
[19:05] great form of what he claimed
[19:07] as he enmorphs himself into his servants
[19:10] and proves himself
[19:12] so god is here amen where is he amen
[19:14] he's moving himself into what he's
[19:16] claimed
[19:18] he's in morphing himself into his
[19:20] servants and proves himself
[19:23] amen second corinthians 5 7 says before
[19:26] we walk by
[19:26] faith not by sight
[19:30] i'm going to read several quotes here
[19:33] out of 1959 and 1960 when brother venom
[19:35] speaking on this subject
[19:37] he says in the subject and the message
[19:39] door to the heart
[19:41] says you was given five senses but then
[19:43] five
[19:44] senses your intellectuals will never
[19:46] were
[19:47] was never given to you to lead you
[19:50] the sixth sense which is faith was given
[19:53] to you to lead you
[19:54] that's the sixth sense that's the super
[19:56] sense it leads you
[19:58] so now you find out when you come in
[20:00] contact with god
[20:02] that you've been under the wrong
[20:03] leadership all your life because you've
[20:05] been under the leadership of the senses
[20:06] of this flesh
[20:07] and the senses of the spirit amen but
[20:10] really the sense that god gave to lead
[20:12] us was the sixth sense
[20:15] in 1961 he says thou son of david have
[20:17] mercy on me in that message he says
[20:19] the sixth sense will defy any of the
[20:21] other five
[20:22] we do with with with the fives
[20:26] all right as long as they agree with the
[20:28] six
[20:29] and when they understand that the five
[20:31] senses the other senses are all right
[20:34] as long as they agree with the sixth
[20:35] sense
[20:37] when they disagree that's when they're
[20:39] not all right amen so
[20:41] it doesn't mean that everything the
[20:43] senses declare all wrong no if they
[20:45] align with the sixth sense that's fine
[20:49] but men wasn't given to live by the five
[20:51] senses
[20:52] to let the five senses guide him he was
[20:55] given
[20:55] prone to born here to be led by the
[20:57] sixth sense that's what god gave him
[21:00] the sixth sense for that's god's place
[21:02] in the heart to lead us
[21:04] so we're led by the sixth sense if we'll
[21:06] just let it now if the sixth sense
[21:08] says the word is wrong then you're not
[21:10] in the sixth sense
[21:12] that's the five senses but sixth sense
[21:14] will believe things that the five senses
[21:16] doesn't declare
[21:17] it's kind of complicated but it's true
[21:20] that's the sixth sense is what we're
[21:22] guided by and brother branham is talking
[21:24] about the sixth sense he's not talking
[21:25] about the eleventh sense amen because we
[21:27] know
[21:27] amen that we have brother bam says your
[21:29] three bodies
[21:31] you're a flesh body your spirit and your
[21:33] soul
[21:34] amen and that flesh body has five senses
[21:37] amen
[21:37] the spirit body has five senses but in
[21:40] the soul
[21:41] amen there's one sense that governs the
[21:43] soul the believers and that's faith
[21:46] if you don't have faith you have doubt
[21:47] or unbelief amen but
[21:49] what's governing the believer is faith
[21:51] in the soul
[21:52] and that's the sixth sense that trumps
[21:54] the five in the spirit
[21:56] that trumps the five in the flesh amen
[21:58] whatever whatever they're saying amen
[22:00] amen if they align and agree with the
[22:02] sixth sense they're fine
[22:04] if they're not agreeing with the sixth
[22:05] sense which always agrees with the word
[22:07] then those senses are wrong and to be
[22:10] ignored
[22:12] praise be to god let's go to john
[22:14] chapter 6.
[22:26] so you know brother makes this statement
[22:29] he says
[22:29] you know he's in a meeting says angels
[22:31] are lining the walls of this auditorium
[22:35] and if your eyes do not declare angels
[22:38] lining the walls of the auditorium
[22:40] then it's your eyesight that's wrong
[22:43] not brother branham it's your eyesight
[22:46] that's limited it's your eyesight that's
[22:48] failing
[22:49] to give you the revelation of the true
[22:51] reality that's all around us
[22:53] you have to remember the what we call
[22:55] reality is the vapor is the mist amen
[22:57] is the is the negative amen it's not the
[23:00] real reality it's the shadow
[23:02] off the real reality and we've been
[23:05] trained all our lives to believe that
[23:06] this is the reality
[23:08] this is the physical and we're missing
[23:10] the whole point that this
[23:11] is not the most physical this is not the
[23:14] reality
[23:15] this is the reflection of the reality or
[23:18] the shadow or the negative of the
[23:20] reality and so when we're limited by the
[23:23] senses we have to have something that
[23:25] will break us
[23:26] out of this norm that we've learned as a
[23:28] norm in our lives
[23:29] and move us into the real reality and
[23:31] that thing has been given to the
[23:33] children of god
[23:34] and awakened by the spirit of god and
[23:36] that thing is the sixth sense of faith
[23:39] that says there's angels lining the
[23:41] walls of this auditorium amen
[23:43] it doesn't matter if i could go over and
[23:45] touch them or not touch them
[23:46] it doesn't matter if i get a sensation
[23:48] up and down my arm or it makes my
[23:50] hair stand up or not stand up or i can
[23:51] see it or there's a shadow or a light
[23:54] that doesn't matter amen because what
[23:56] matters is the true reality that it's
[23:58] here
[24:00] and there's something in me that says
[24:02] it's here i know it's here i
[24:04] believe it's here no none of my senses
[24:06] will declare it's here it's here
[24:08] nonetheless
[24:11] that's the sense that god gave to guide
[24:13] us not the five
[24:16] in john chapter 6 53
[24:21] he says then jesus said unto them verily
[24:24] verily i say
[24:26] unto you except you eat the flesh of the
[24:28] son of man and drink his blood
[24:30] you have no life in you whoso eateth my
[24:33] flesh and drinketh my blood
[24:35] hath eternal life and i will raise him
[24:37] up at the last day
[24:39] for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood
[24:42] is drink
[24:43] indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[24:45] drinketh my blood
[24:46] dwelleth in me and i in him
[24:49] as the living father has sent me and i
[24:52] live by the father so he that eateth me
[24:54] even he shall live by me this is that
[24:57] bread which came down from heaven not as
[24:59] your fathers did eat manna
[25:01] and are dead he that eateth of this
[25:03] bread shall live
[25:04] forever these things said he in the
[25:07] synagogue as he taught in capernaum
[25:09] many therefore of his disciples when
[25:11] they had heard this said
[25:12] this is a hard saying who can hear it
[25:17] now if you think about these disciples
[25:20] these disciples had seen many things
[25:23] seen many miracles they had heard many
[25:25] teachings
[25:26] they had heard things jesus had said
[25:28] they had seen things jesus had done
[25:30] amen and by seeing and by hearing
[25:33] they were believing
[25:36] but it wasn't the sixth sense faith it
[25:39] was an
[25:39] intellectual faith and intellectual
[25:42] believing
[25:43] based off what they saw and based off
[25:45] what they heard
[25:47] so so you can see by their reaction to
[25:50] what jesus says
[25:52] that they did not have the sixth sense
[25:54] of faith amen
[25:55] that their soul was still stuck in
[25:57] unbelief amen although they thought that
[26:00] they were believers
[26:01] amen when the word test came they found
[26:03] out that they were not really believers
[26:07] they were intellectual believing based
[26:10] off the senses
[26:12] and any faith based off the senses is
[26:15] subject to fail and will fail
[26:19] it will eventually at some point meet a
[26:21] failure amen
[26:22] because there has to be the sixth sense
[26:25] amen that goes without
[26:27] amen without any of the other senses
[26:30] so jesus begins to shave down his crowd
[26:33] and he begins to test him with the word
[26:35] and he says i unless you eat my flesh
[26:38] and drink my blood you have no life in
[26:40] you and brother baby explains it so many
[26:42] times he says he didn't explain it he
[26:44] just
[26:44] said it amen because he was wanting to
[26:46] find where who was the children of god
[26:48] where were the elect
[26:50] amen because the non-elect all they have
[26:53] is the senses to go by and when they
[26:55] when they have the intellect and
[26:56] reasoning and
[26:57] understanding and they said it's
[26:59] impossible how are we going to eat his
[27:01] flesh
[27:02] and how are we going to drink his blood
[27:04] amen and jesus was using good language
[27:08] i mean he was using common language
[27:10] brother ben said he spoke in the common
[27:12] language the common people understood
[27:14] him
[27:15] heard him gladly so he was speaking in
[27:18] common language
[27:19] and when he said eat my flesh and drink
[27:21] my blood it was
[27:22] common words common words that they'd
[27:24] understand
[27:25] words that they had heard words that
[27:27] they thought they knew the meaning to
[27:29] by intellect and by reasoning by
[27:32] knowledge by understanding
[27:33] amen but he they missed amen they missed
[27:36] what he was saying
[27:37] by understanding the words that he was
[27:39] saying
[27:41] because they had intel and intellect and
[27:44] they had reasoning
[27:46] their intellect and reasoning could take
[27:48] words that were spoken their language
[27:50] attached definitions that they were
[27:51] taught in school come
[27:53] up to a conclusion that would be
[27:54] impossible and then they would turn and
[27:56] walk away
[27:59] but then you had a group of elect
[28:01] sitting there
[28:02] they heard the same words they had been
[28:04] taught the same definitions
[28:06] they had the same vocabulary amen they
[28:08] had maybe memorized the same
[28:10] spelling words in school and read it
[28:12] from the dictionary
[28:14] they had the same intellectual
[28:16] understanding they had the same
[28:17] reasoning
[28:18] they had the same kind of eyes and the
[28:20] same kind of ears in the flesh
[28:22] that the disciples who walked away amen
[28:24] but there was something
[28:25] in them that went deeper than the
[28:28] intellect they went deeper than the
[28:29] reasoning that went
[28:31] deeper than the physical eyes and
[28:32] physical ears for when it made
[28:34] no sense to any of the senses at all how
[28:37] we are going to
[28:38] eat this man's flesh and drink this
[28:40] man's blood
[28:43] something in them could not go amen and
[28:46] when jesus pressed him he said well you
[28:47] go also and
[28:48] peter says where shall we go thou alone
[28:51] have the words of eternal life
[28:52] and peter no more understood the
[28:54] statement than those that walked away
[28:58] but he wasn't to be led by his senses
[29:00] there was a sixth sense laying in the
[29:02] soul
[29:03] that was to be the leader man was
[29:06] supposed to be led by that
[29:07] amen and for years you know we've heard
[29:09] things that the prophet said
[29:11] that don't make sense intellectually
[29:13] amen and people are taken
[29:15] by intellectual reasoning words and
[29:18] definitions of words
[29:19] and timelines and dates and being able
[29:22] to look at a calendar
[29:23] and they've been able to come up with
[29:24] all kinds of discrepancies and heirs
[29:27] and what they call lies
[29:30] but there's another sense in me amen
[29:33] that doesn't tell time by a calendar
[29:35] amen that doesn't matter about a date
[29:37] amen
[29:38] is not interested in the definition of
[29:40] the word because i've caught the meaning
[29:42] that's behind the word
[29:46] praise be to god because there's got to
[29:48] be a sixth sense
[29:49] that leads the children of god and if
[29:51] god amen in the form of jesus christ
[29:54] would give statements amen to shave off
[29:56] to say it intentionally to cause
[29:58] something to walk away
[29:59] why would he do it different in this day
[30:01] when he sends malachi 4.
[30:03] when we have a son of man revealing the
[30:05] son of man the ministry of the son of
[30:07] man replicated on earth again
[30:09] why would he do it differently
[30:12] he's going to do it the same way amen
[30:14] because he's looking for his lost sheep
[30:16] he's looking for the sixth sense
[30:18] he's looking for somebody that can
[30:19] believe when their intelligence and
[30:21] their
[30:22] intellect says i do not know what he's
[30:24] talking about
[30:25] i cannot make it add up
[30:29] but i believe anyhow i believe anyhow
[30:34] and by god's grace by god's grace
[30:38] when they just stuck with what their
[30:40] what the sixth sense was telling them
[30:42] was truth
[30:43] with no understanding later the lord
[30:46] will come and bring a revelation and
[30:48] bring the proper understanding
[30:50] of what he said when you eat my flesh
[30:51] and drink my blood
[30:54] jesus was speaking amen to people with a
[30:57] a human beings with a human mind
[30:59] with human intellect and human eyes and
[31:02] ears and
[31:03] they had understanding on what eating
[31:05] means
[31:06] but they didn't know what he meant by
[31:08] eating
[31:09] they had an understanding what drinking
[31:11] meant but they didn't know what he meant
[31:12] by drinking
[31:13] because although he was speaking in
[31:15] natural terms he was speaking on a
[31:17] spiritual
[31:18] level and he tells him he says
[31:22] my my flesh is meat indeed
[31:25] it is food you can
[31:28] eat my flesh you think they understood
[31:32] it
[31:32] no they didn't understand it but they
[31:34] knew it was the truth
[31:36] if that man who i know is the son of god
[31:39] if he said
[31:40] my flesh is meat and deed that you can't
[31:42] actually eat my flesh
[31:43] then something in me is going to say
[31:45] that's nothing but the truth
[31:48] turn to the next disciple explain that
[31:49] to me i don't know how to explain it
[31:52] all i know is that he has the words of
[31:54] eternal life
[31:57] then god amen would open the eyes of his
[32:00] disciples
[32:00] lift him on a higher plane so that they
[32:02] realize the eating that he's talking
[32:04] about
[32:05] is not with your teeth not
[32:08] biting and chewing and swallowing amen
[32:11] that's not the eating he's talking about
[32:12] he's talking about partaking amen of
[32:15] that flesh which is the word made flesh
[32:17] taking the word feeding on the word
[32:20] becoming one with the word
[32:21] taking the word to the inside that's the
[32:23] eating that he's talking about when he
[32:25] says eat my flesh he's saying you can my
[32:28] flesh is meat and deed what is his flesh
[32:30] it was the word that was made flesh
[32:32] it was the manifested word for that day
[32:35] for that hour that they were living
[32:36] it was the word that had come forth and
[32:39] made manifest in that day
[32:40] and he says it is food and you can eat
[32:43] it
[32:44] well i'd like to say he has come forth
[32:46] in this day he is a manifested word in
[32:49] this day
[32:50] the word is made flesh and you can take
[32:52] it and you can eat it
[32:56] amen and there was a blood
[33:00] that you could drink
[33:04] and they knew
[33:07] the common understanding of that term
[33:10] they didn't understand what he meant or
[33:13] how it would work
[33:16] but they just stuck with it until he
[33:17] brought the revelation
[33:20] that his blood represents his life his
[33:23] spirit
[33:24] and you can drink of that spirit and
[33:27] receive it on the inside
[33:29] you can eat of that flesh that word and
[33:31] take of that life that spirit
[33:33] and you can become one with him and he
[33:35] can dwell in you
[33:36] and you can dwell in him
[33:41] see when jesus was here on earth
[33:44] speaking
[33:45] he was in a human form using language
[33:49] they understood
[33:50] but he was speaking on a whole different
[33:52] level
[33:54] and there's no way i'm telling your
[33:56] friends there's no way
[33:58] ever through the senses to understand
[34:01] what he was saying
[34:04] now that he's brought revelation and
[34:06] there's been bible schools and teaching
[34:08] and doctrines amen now people are able
[34:11] to take what jesus said and break it
[34:14] down and begin to show
[34:16] later in the bible the communion came in
[34:18] what jesus said at the last
[34:20] supper and what paul the apostle paul
[34:22] said in communion we can tie it all
[34:23] together
[34:24] and we can put it together in language
[34:26] that's comprehendable and a package
[34:28] that's easily seen with the
[34:29] eye and understood with the mind and you
[34:31] can get people to acknowledge
[34:33] oh eating his flesh is feeding on the
[34:36] word
[34:37] and drinking his blood is taking a
[34:38] spirit oh i get it i recognize it
[34:43] that's still not seeing it if you see it
[34:46] with the intellect you don't see it
[34:51] i'll say it this way if you understand
[34:52] it with the intellect alone you don't
[34:54] understand it
[34:55] if you see it with the eye alone you
[34:57] don't see it if you hear it with the ear
[34:59] alone you don't hear it
[35:04] for instance jesus he was doing miracles
[35:06] all kinds of miracles
[35:07] amen and they saw the miracles and you
[35:09] could you could see the crowd amen
[35:12] excited and rejoicing because the dead
[35:14] was raised the death could hear the
[35:16] blind eyes were open
[35:18] he fed the multitudes he did what no man
[35:20] could do
[35:21] amen and they testified this is god
[35:23] god's working in that man
[35:25] amen but but when he came to start
[35:27] speaking his doctrine when it came time
[35:29] for the crucifixion
[35:30] they all walked away and didn't believe
[35:32] anymore
[35:35] that means when they they saw you could
[35:37] go to
[35:38] somebody in that crowd you say did you
[35:40] see him raise that dead man
[35:41] i saw it do you believe he raised the
[35:45] dead man
[35:46] yes do you believe it was god in him
[35:49] yes did you see him feed the multitudes
[35:54] did you see when he tore off bread and
[35:57] more came
[35:58] did you see i saw it with my own eyes i
[36:00] was close enough i could see the bread
[36:02] come back
[36:04] do you believe he did it yes do you
[36:06] believe it was god
[36:07] yes
[36:10] but that's not the kind of believing
[36:12] that god's looking for
[36:15] for when that man's ministry began to
[36:18] tank
[36:19] and the crowds walked away and the
[36:21] pharisees began rejecting him
[36:22] amen and some of his own disciples
[36:24] walked away and then he become
[36:26] then he was arrested by the by the by
[36:28] the high priest and turned over to the
[36:30] romans and he was going to be crucified
[36:32] where were all the believers then
[36:35] because they only believed what they saw
[36:38] they only believed what they heard
[36:40] they only believed what they understood
[36:41] i mean there was no sixth sense to take
[36:43] them to a true
[36:44] faith to a true belief because they
[36:46] believed that when the sight
[36:48] changed and the hearing changed and the
[36:50] understanding changed
[36:52] their faith went away
[36:56] that's not the sixth sense faith that's
[36:58] a human faith that's an intellectual
[37:00] faith and that's the faith that
[37:02] fluctuates with the eyes
[37:03] with the ears with the mind amen but
[37:05] there's got to be another
[37:07] faith in his children that doesn't
[37:09] fluctuate with the sight amen
[37:11] doesn't fluctuate with the ears and
[37:13] doesn't fluctuate with the mind
[37:17] your mind will go up and down your
[37:19] emotions will go up and down
[37:20] and you can't stop that movement
[37:22] sometimes amen and
[37:24] your eyes will see things that will
[37:25] cause your intellect to waver
[37:29] but god's not interested in your
[37:31] intellect
[37:32] he's interested in that faith seed and
[37:35] although the mind
[37:36] may waver and bounce here and get
[37:38] discouraged and come back and
[37:39] misunderstand
[37:40] and then understand god's not interested
[37:42] in what's going on in the five senses
[37:45] he's interested in the six tens and that
[37:47] sixth sense will hold
[37:48] no matter how much the mind wavers it'll
[37:50] bounce all over the place
[37:52] like a ship bobbing in the ocean but
[37:54] there's an anchor that goes down into
[37:56] the soul
[37:56] and hooks to the rock of revelation with
[37:58] the sixth sense and it doesn't matter
[38:00] what's bobbing in the storm out here
[38:02] something true is taking place down
[38:04] below and
[38:05] holding you
[38:10] that's the sense that is to guide us
[38:14] that's the one that he's looking for
[38:18] brother man says 1956 when their eyes
[38:21] were open
[38:22] now what is faith faith is the substance
[38:24] of things hoped for
[38:25] the evidence of things that you do not
[38:28] see
[38:29] taste feel smell
[38:32] here
[38:36] i want to ask you are there angels
[38:38] lining the walls of this room
[38:41] do you believe it because i told you do
[38:43] you believe it because you heard it
[38:45] do you believe it because brother
[38:46] branham said it or do you believe
[38:47] because something in you says it's the
[38:49] truth
[38:50] it's just the truth
[38:54] amen
[38:57] see you believe it your body has five
[39:01] senses
[39:02] none of them senses contact god
[39:06] so important he said
[39:11] you believe it your body has five senses
[39:15] none of them senses contact god
[39:19] god gives you them five senses to
[39:21] contact your earthly home
[39:22] here on earth but you contact god by
[39:26] faith
[39:29] see sometimes we make the mistake in
[39:31] trying to contact god through emotion
[39:35] or contact god through intellect or
[39:38] contact god through some other means
[39:40] works or or efforts or whatever
[39:44] but you can only contact god through
[39:45] faith
[39:48] the message perseverant from 62 he says
[39:50] now you've got five senses in your body
[39:53] god gave you those five senses to
[39:54] contact your early home that seed taste
[39:56] feel smell here
[39:57] but that has nothing to do with god
[40:00] there isn't
[40:00] any of them that will declare god amen
[40:06] what but i saw him break
[40:10] the bread but i saw him
[40:13] raise the dead i saw him lay hand and
[40:16] them come forth
[40:17] amen that didn't declare god to you amen
[40:20] because those people who saw that
[40:22] turned around and said crucify him
[40:24] crucify him
[40:25] crucify him they were contacted with
[40:28] something physically that they seen
[40:29] that caused an intellectual faith that
[40:31] was temporary amen that would turn
[40:33] around now
[40:34] and say crucify that wasn't contacting
[40:36] god
[40:39] but there was something deeper in the
[40:41] children of god in that day
[40:43] amen though they didn't understand
[40:45] though they were afraid and running away
[40:47] and hiding
[40:48] there was still something down on the
[40:49] inside that still believed amen
[40:52] believed in the midst of doubt believed
[40:54] in the midst of fear
[40:55] believed in the midst of running away
[40:57] there was still something there that
[40:58] could anchor their soul
[41:04] let's read this again let's see
[41:08] taste feel smell here but that has
[41:09] nothing to do with god
[41:12] there isn't any of them that will
[41:14] declare god not a one of them
[41:16] because they are only given to you to
[41:18] contact your earthly home see taste
[41:19] smell
[41:20] feel smell here that has nothing to do
[41:22] with god at all
[41:23] and people really people rely
[41:26] really upon them but you mustn't do that
[41:31] faith is something different faith is
[41:33] the sixth sense would you contact god
[41:36] you can only contact god by the sixth
[41:37] sense which is faith
[41:39] he that cometh to god must believe that
[41:41] he is and a rewarder of those
[41:43] that diligently seek after him see
[41:46] brother branham
[41:48] he had a he had faith but when his
[41:51] daughter was laying dying
[41:54] satan came to him and began to work on
[41:56] his intellect
[41:58] began to work on his emotion his love
[42:01] being began to work
[42:02] on his memory of his baby in his
[42:04] reasoning
[42:05] and he began to his eyes begin to see
[42:08] the condition of afflicted child
[42:09] his ears could hear her moaning amen and
[42:12] he could feel her amen her fever
[42:15] his senses were all working against his
[42:18] faith
[42:19] and the devil was working with all of
[42:21] his senses
[42:25] and now he sees he feels the fever he
[42:28] sees
[42:28] the affliction the eyes turn back with
[42:31] the twitching of her leg
[42:32] and then he can hear her moaning and her
[42:34] breathing
[42:35] and then the devil comes in and begins
[42:37] to flash memories of a little baby
[42:39] who would reach up her arms and go to
[42:41] him when he come home memories of love
[42:44] emotions that were flooding in
[42:46] and reasoning you after you've served
[42:48] god stayed up night and day and now
[42:51] your wife is in the morgue and now he's
[42:53] taking your baby
[42:54] how can you preach a god that loves you
[42:56] when all this is happening
[43:00] and brother branham says he about had me
[43:06] he about had me but then all of a sudden
[43:09] i pray it was like a black sheep come
[43:11] down
[43:13] god listen friends
[43:17] god would not meet that prophet
[43:20] with anything in his senses
[43:24] god gave him nothing
[43:28] in the senses to go off of
[43:32] and satan used every one of them against
[43:35] him
[43:37] you think oh god if you could just give
[43:38] me a feeling if i could just see
[43:40] something
[43:41] black sheep come down god gave him
[43:44] nothing
[43:45] for his senses
[43:49] the devil the devil started talking
[43:53] and finally he crossed the line on the
[43:56] word
[43:59] and something inside brother ben said
[44:02] devil
[44:02] get thee behind me though the lord
[44:06] giveth the lord taketh away
[44:08] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[44:10] what was it he said that faith sprung to
[44:12] life
[44:13] and he said brother branham how did you
[44:14] hold on he said i didn't hold on
[44:16] it held me there was something in me
[44:20] amen that i didn't put there he meant
[44:21] something that was that transcended
[44:24] my earthly existence that was before
[44:25] that'll be long after
[44:27] amen when all of my senses were working
[44:29] against me and the devil was using
[44:31] everyone against me
[44:32] and god refusing to give me relief in
[44:35] the senses
[44:37] think about it friends what does god
[44:40] want
[44:40] he doesn't want intellectual faith he
[44:42] doesn't want you to follow
[44:43] because i can see this is a good person
[44:45] this is a godly person amen and whatever
[44:47] they do i'm gonna do
[44:48] god's not looking for that god's not
[44:51] looking for well that makes sense to me
[44:53] when a way he explains the message that
[44:55] kind of makes sense to me i can see that
[44:57] and i can read the bible and i can see
[44:59] the pieces kind of fitting together
[45:01] that's not what he's looking for he's
[45:03] looking for somebody who says
[45:05] i have no idea what he's talking about
[45:07] but something in me says it's the truth
[45:10] my intellect is failing my eyes are
[45:12] failing the people that i thought
[45:14] believed i'm watching them fall away and
[45:16] commit sins and all kinds of things
[45:18] amen my senses are telling me that this
[45:20] could be wrong
[45:22] i'm looking at strife and division
[45:27] my senses tell me that this message
[45:29] could be wrong but something inside of
[45:31] me tells me it's right
[45:36] that's what god's looking for and you
[45:38] would think god could just make it
[45:40] easier by giving us more things for the
[45:41] senses
[45:44] right god you just make it easier like
[45:47] give us more things to see
[45:49] and to feel but sometimes god will take
[45:53] it all away
[45:55] because there's only one thing he's
[45:57] looking there's only one thing that
[45:58] overcometh the world
[45:59] one thing that's our victory over the
[46:01] world and that's faith
[46:03] one way to please god and that's by
[46:05] faith
[46:06] one way amen that we must live and
[46:08] that's by faith
[46:10] and god will so many times take away and
[46:13] and god is so good that sometimes
[46:15] there's feelings
[46:16] sometimes your your senses match the
[46:18] sixth sense and that's okay that's fine
[46:20] people would walk into a prayer line to
[46:22] come to brother branham they would
[46:23] hesitate he says oh you feel that
[46:26] they were feeling something you feel
[46:28] that oh that won't hurt you
[46:30] that's just the presence of the lord
[46:31] that's just the angel of the lord
[46:33] so let me describe that feeling it's a
[46:35] real warm sweet feeling isn't it
[46:38] they felt it the same person who felt it
[46:41] may even got delivered would turn around
[46:43] and deny the message
[46:48] so even if god sent down an amazing
[46:51] amazing feeling during the preaching of
[46:54] the word
[46:55] an amazing feeling and a pillar of fire
[46:57] moving around on the platform
[46:59] amen you could still go away and
[47:01] disbelieve
[47:03] because it happened thousands and
[47:05] thousands of times
[47:07] amen even the rich man asking god is it
[47:10] god
[47:10] send back lazarus to preach to my
[47:12] brothers he said though one raised from
[47:14] the dead they'll not believe
[47:16] because they don't have the sixth sense
[47:18] there's no seed on the inside to believe
[47:20] with
[47:22] god you can make it easy for us sitting
[47:25] down a warm sensation
[47:26] put a tingle all over our spine amen do
[47:29] flashes of lightning and balls of fire
[47:32] raise the dead
[47:33] do something so that i can see and
[47:35] sometimes god will do things
[47:37] and they help us and we appreciate them
[47:40] sometimes god will do nothing
[47:44] what does he want he wants that same
[47:47] thing to help brother branham when his
[47:48] baby was dying
[47:50] to hold you and i he wants that same
[47:54] thing
[47:55] that held his disciples when they were
[47:57] running away scared
[47:59] to hold us
[48:03] praise god
[48:07] sometimes we get into trials hardships
[48:10] difficulty
[48:12] we just say oh god if you could just let
[48:15] me feel your presence
[48:18] that's not an evil thing to ask for
[48:20] that's not wrong
[48:22] and many times in his sweetness and his
[48:23] gentleness he'll do that for us
[48:26] especially early in our walk when we're
[48:29] just babes in christ
[48:30] many times he'll do those things just to
[48:32] encourage us along the way because he
[48:34] knows where we're at
[48:36] but he wants maturity friends
[48:39] he wants us to walk by faith and not by
[48:42] sight
[48:43] he wants us not to rely on the senses
[48:46] amen there's traps we come into and
[48:48] difficult that we come into we just want
[48:50] god just to do something supernatural
[48:52] we just want and god has already done
[48:54] the most supernatural thing he can do
[48:55] for us he's revealed his word
[48:58] he's opened the book what more
[49:00] supernatural thing do we want
[49:02] he opened the book he gave us a perfect
[49:04] interpretation of the word with divine
[49:06] with divine vindication that's the most
[49:08] supernatural thing you can experience
[49:12] and god wants us to take that word by
[49:14] faith
[49:15] and stand upon it and watch it come to
[49:17] pass
[49:19] so there's nothing wrong with desiring
[49:22] because we've had some wonderful times
[49:23] with the lord and we'll have wonderful
[49:25] times again
[49:26] there's nothing wrong with desiring that
[49:28] amen but the thing that he's
[49:30] given us amen is a faith seed to believe
[49:32] his word and he's given us his word to
[49:33] believe
[49:37] let's go to john chapter 3.
[49:44] these things in the scripture familiar
[49:45] but i just want to bring it to our
[49:47] attention again
[49:51] john chapter 3 and verse 1.
[49:58] there was a man of the pharisees named
[49:59] nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[50:02] the same came to jesus by night and said
[50:04] unto him rabbi
[50:06] we know that thou are a teacher come
[50:07] from god for no man can do those
[50:09] miracles that thou doest
[50:10] except god be with him jesus answered
[50:13] and said unto him
[50:14] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[50:16] man be born again
[50:17] he cannot see the kingdom of god now
[50:19] when we read this scripture for us
[50:21] it's old news i mean we've heard it we
[50:23] understand what he's talking about we
[50:25] understand the real meaning
[50:26] of this but just put yourself in
[50:27] nicodemus's place
[50:29] hearing this for the very first time
[50:32] never heard this before
[50:33] this concept never been presented before
[50:35] never heard it before
[50:36] and he says verily verily i say unto
[50:38] thee accept a man be born
[50:40] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[50:42] and immediately nicodemus saith unto him
[50:44] how can a man be born when he is old can
[50:46] he enter the second
[50:48] time into his mother's womb and be born
[50:51] now
[50:51] now what nicodemus is doing is relying a
[50:54] hundred percent on his senses
[50:58] and in the natural flesh who could blame
[51:01] him
[51:03] nicodemus may be a foot taller than his
[51:06] mother at this time
[51:09] and she may be a little frail woman he
[51:11] may outweigh her by 50 pounds
[51:13] and he may be 10 12 inches taller than
[51:15] her and now he's saying
[51:17] you unless a man is born again
[51:20] born a second time he cannot see the
[51:22] kingdom of god and nicodemus asked the
[51:24] question
[51:25] when a man is old like me can he go back
[51:27] into his mother's womb again and be born
[51:29] how in the world are you am i going to
[51:32] be born again
[51:34] and now we use a term born again not
[51:36] born again born again we understand it
[51:37] but he has no idea
[51:39] to him born again means to come forth
[51:41] from the womb of a human
[51:42] mother again and he's asking how is this
[51:46] possible
[51:46] and jesus doesn't say i understand it's
[51:49] a little bit difficult
[51:50] let me explain it to you
[51:54] because that's not the kind of believer
[51:56] he's looking for
[51:58] he's not looking for somebody who can
[52:00] follow intellectually
[52:02] he's looking for somebody who can take
[52:04] the word because it resonates on the
[52:06] inside
[52:09] when he came to the woman at the well
[52:11] there was something that resonated
[52:13] inside amen when he come to so many
[52:16] they had something that resonated on the
[52:18] inside when he came to the pharisees all
[52:20] they had was intellect
[52:22] doctrine teaching understanding and
[52:24] nothing resonated on the inside
[52:28] he says let's go on
[52:32] 5 jesus answered verily verily i say
[52:34] unto thee except a man be born of water
[52:37] and of spirit he cannot enter into the
[52:39] kingdom of god
[52:41] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[52:42] that which is born of the spirit of
[52:44] spirit
[52:45] marvel not that i say unto thee you must
[52:47] be born again
[52:48] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[52:50] thou thou
[52:51] hearst to sound thereof but can't not
[52:53] tell whence it cometh
[52:54] and whether it goeth so is every man
[52:57] that is born of the spirit
[52:59] nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[53:01] can these things be
[53:03] jesus answered and said unto him art
[53:05] thou a master of israel and knowest not
[53:07] these things
[53:09] verily verily i say unto thee we speak
[53:12] that
[53:12] we do know and you testify that and and
[53:15] testify that we have seen and you
[53:18] receive not our witness
[53:20] if i have told you earthly things and
[53:23] you believe not
[53:24] how shall you believe if i tell you of
[53:26] heavenly things
[53:28] let's stop right there what was he
[53:30] saying he was
[53:31] trying to get nicodemus to understand
[53:34] that you have to have another birth
[53:38] he's using a natural type and he didn't
[53:40] understand it so he
[53:41] so he starts talking about that's born
[53:43] of flesh is flesh that born of spirit of
[53:45] spirit
[53:45] and look at the wind the wind moves
[53:47] through and you know where it comes from
[53:48] where it goes so is everyone
[53:50] and and he's trying to use a natural
[53:53] type to get nicodemus to understand
[53:55] and after the natural types he speaks of
[53:57] earthly things
[53:59] he said if i speak of earthly things you
[54:01] don't understand how will you ever
[54:02] understand if i speak of heavenly
[54:04] i'm trying to use the wind and the birth
[54:06] to get you to understand
[54:08] a spiritual truth in reality
[54:13] nicodemus answered and said how can
[54:15] these things be
[54:18] do you said art thou a master
[54:22] of israel knoweth not these things
[54:25] listen i'm going to keep reading what we
[54:27] read and i want to go to the next part
[54:29] verily verily i say unto thee we speak
[54:31] that we do know
[54:32] and testify that we have seen and you
[54:34] receive not our witness
[54:37] jesus had knowledge beyond human
[54:40] knowledge
[54:42] and he saw more than humanized saul
[54:51] he says i have told you earthly things
[54:54] and you believe not how
[54:56] shall you believe if i tell you of
[54:57] heavenly things and no man have to send
[54:59] it up to heaven but he that come down
[55:01] from heaven
[55:02] even the son of man which is in heaven
[55:07] jesus was not interested in getting
[55:09] nicodemus
[55:10] to understand his language
[55:14] he was looking for the seed he was
[55:17] looking for faith
[55:21] see sometimes
[55:25] we just want it simple i just want it
[55:27] easy
[55:28] i don't want it complicated i don't want
[55:29] it hard to understand
[55:31] just i want it simple and and sometimes
[55:34] people even fret at brother branham's
[55:36] preaching style
[55:38] they even get frustrated because he
[55:40] doesn't come right out and say it
[55:41] he alludes to it but doesn't say it and
[55:43] he says do you get what i mean i hope
[55:45] you understand what i'm saying without
[55:46] coming right out and saying it and
[55:47] you're listening like just say it
[55:52] and then he'll he'll start into a
[55:53] subject and he'll change subjects and
[55:55] he'll drop something
[55:56] and sometimes he'll drop it and never
[55:58] come back to it in that sermon
[56:01] he'll be cruising down a subject he's
[56:02] getting ready to answer the question and
[56:04] he's on this one and i want to know
[56:06] about this
[56:06] and he switches and turns another
[56:08] direction and for the rest of the sermon
[56:09] you're waiting because so many times he
[56:11] does this
[56:11] he goes and takes the rabbit trail and
[56:13] he comes back and he hits that but
[56:14] you're watching watching watching
[56:15] watching watching
[56:16] you get to the conclusion you sing this
[56:18] song he said god bless you my friends
[56:20] he turns it over and he never did
[56:21] address it
[56:24] and people get frustrated because they
[56:26] want the textbook on the message
[56:30] because what we really want is the is we
[56:33] really want
[56:34] to be comfortable with intellectual
[56:37] understanding
[56:39] because it makes us comfortable if two
[56:42] plus two equals four
[56:46] and two plus two always equals four
[56:50] then i am comfortable with two plus two
[56:52] equals four
[56:55] but what if all of a sudden somebody
[56:57] says 2 plus 2
[56:58] equals 5 sometimes in certain conditions
[57:03] what conditions i can't tell you right
[57:04] now
[57:08] then all of a sudden our our our
[57:11] foundation is rattled all of a sudden
[57:13] our comfort level fades away
[57:15] because god is not trying to make us
[57:16] comfortable in our intellect and in our
[57:18] understanding
[57:19] he's looking for something that goes
[57:20] deeper something way down on the inside
[57:23] that says i don't understand my brother
[57:25] rem said it this way one time this way
[57:27] another time
[57:27] they look contradictory i don't believe
[57:29] he's contradicting himself but i can't
[57:31] correlate the two
[57:32] but something in me says that that man
[57:34] amen has the vindicate the true
[57:36] interpretation of the word
[57:38] by divine vindication and i'm going to
[57:41] believe it and i'm going to stick with
[57:43] it and god's going to give me the
[57:44] revelation on it when i need it
[57:46] as i need it if i need it but i'm not
[57:49] moving away from what faith tells me
[57:51] that this is nothing but the truth
[57:55] see we we're looking for somebody amen
[57:57] to put it in a package
[57:59] to make it simple somebody just to
[58:01] explain it
[58:02] so tightly amen that nobody can nobody
[58:05] can shoot holes in it nobody
[58:06] amen nobody can even just to shut the
[58:09] mouths of the critics
[58:11] they're looking for somebody to shut the
[58:13] mouths of the critics god's not going to
[58:15] let the mouths of the critics be shut
[58:19] if anything god made sure there was
[58:23] circumstantial evidence left behind
[58:25] [Music]
[58:29] you disbelieve i give you exhibit a
[58:32] and exhibit b in exhibit c
[58:36] so you can make your case
[58:40] and over on the other side brother venom
[58:42] drops little things
[58:43] i could drop a little something here
[58:44] exhibit a
[58:46] i hope you get what i'm saying without
[58:48] coming right out and saying exhibit b
[58:53] do you understand the trial's going on
[58:56] now
[58:57] you're the jury which one's right
[59:02] how do you know what's right how can you
[59:05] be sure
[59:09] because faith is a solid rock
[59:12] unmovable unflinching unchanging
[59:17] that's what god is looking for
[59:21] god's not interested in making us
[59:22] comfortable he's looking for his
[59:25] children
[59:26] and he's he's maturing his children
[59:29] and the sons and daughters of god
[59:32] 1959 a super sense he says how do you
[59:34] know
[59:35] when you haven't tasted the lord how do
[59:37] you know when you never receive the holy
[59:39] ghost whether he's real or whether he's
[59:40] not
[59:41] how do you know whether there's faith in
[59:43] power how do you know there's not joy
[59:45] unspeakable and full of glory
[59:46] when you've never tasted to see it the
[59:49] sixth sense leads you to that
[59:51] the sixth sense declares that to you
[59:53] there's no intellectual powers at all
[59:55] will ever bring that to you the
[59:57] intellectual powers will reason and say
[59:59] why it's psychology it's something this
[1:00:00] a way it's an emotion with the people
[1:00:02] but when the sixth sense comes in it
[1:00:04] denies all of those things and moves a
[1:00:06] person straight into the bosom of god
[1:00:10] in the face of critics in the face of
[1:00:12] criticism in the face of rejection
[1:00:14] and in the face of your own questions in
[1:00:16] your own mind
[1:00:18] amen the sixth sense moves you right
[1:00:20] into the bosom of god
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:23] in 1962 it says we would see jesus it's
[1:00:26] a sixth sense
[1:00:27] five senses won't touch it it's the
[1:00:29] sixth sense
[1:00:30] five senses won't declare faith at all
[1:00:32] it's the sixth sense and the sixth sense
[1:00:33] is the one that declares the whole armor
[1:00:35] of god
[1:00:36] and the whole armor of god is nothing
[1:00:38] that one of the five senses will declare
[1:00:42] just think about the word of god and how
[1:00:44] the word of god is constructed
[1:00:46] amen and he says the the we're told to
[1:00:49] put on the former of god
[1:00:51] are we supposed to put on the full armor
[1:00:52] of god well where's your armor let me
[1:00:54] see it
[1:00:56] point to it tell me when you got it how
[1:00:57] did you get it how did you put it on
[1:00:59] how does it fit how did you make it do
[1:01:01] you make an adjustment to it
[1:01:03] see it's nothing to do with the natural
[1:01:05] it's all supernatural
[1:01:07] it's a helmet of salvation it's the feet
[1:01:10] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[1:01:12] it's a shield of faith amen it's loins
[1:01:15] girt with truth
[1:01:17] it's a breastplate of righteousness it's
[1:01:19] a sword of the spirit
[1:01:20] that's the word nothing physical nothing
[1:01:23] tangible
[1:01:24] nothing you can put your hands on but
[1:01:26] something you must have
[1:01:30] see god's good
[1:01:34] he says in the in the message
[1:01:39] if you'll notice on the platform in
[1:01:40] different places everywhere not only
[1:01:42] here everywhere the people come by
[1:01:44] they expect they've had too much of this
[1:01:47] here high pressure latter-day divine
[1:01:49] healing campaigns
[1:01:51] it's exactly right people say i got it
[1:01:53] in the hand
[1:01:54] feel it feel it you feel it no you don't
[1:01:57] feel it
[1:01:58] you might feel your hand but that's all
[1:02:00] you feel
[1:02:01] that's right jesus never did say did you
[1:02:04] feel it he said did you believe it
[1:02:06] see not did you feel it do you believe
[1:02:08] it faith is not feeling
[1:02:10] faith is something that you don't feel
[1:02:13] you have no senses will declare it
[1:02:15] only that sixth sense that faith that
[1:02:17] knows it
[1:02:18] you don't feel taste smell or hear it
[1:02:21] but you know it because jesus said so
[1:02:23] that settles it it's not about feeling
[1:02:26] it it's about
[1:02:28] knowing it in the message the super
[1:02:31] sense from 1959
[1:02:32] it says the supersense is the holy
[1:02:34] spirit the faith of god that dwells
[1:02:36] in you and if you'll let the five senses
[1:02:38] be yielded to the sixth sense
[1:02:40] it'll guide you and bring all other five
[1:02:42] senses under
[1:02:44] control of the supersense now i'd like
[1:02:46] to say
[1:02:47] any time that i've ever failed god and i
[1:02:49] know i failed god
[1:02:50] is is when god through a still small
[1:02:53] voice or something in the soul
[1:02:54] is moving me in one way and i allow the
[1:02:58] other senses to talk me out of it
[1:03:01] a god amen god through through uh
[1:03:05] uh god through a way of getting you to
[1:03:08] understand through the soul god through
[1:03:09] a way of whispering in your heart
[1:03:11] the still small voice is trying to move
[1:03:13] you some way
[1:03:14] or to make a decision or to make a move
[1:03:16] and all of a sudden reasoning comes in
[1:03:19] but if i do that this will happen if i
[1:03:21] do that they'll think this and if i say
[1:03:24] that this will
[1:03:24] and blah blah blah blah blah the last
[1:03:26] time i did that this happened
[1:03:28] memory if i say that they'll think i'm
[1:03:32] upset with them
[1:03:33] if i do that they won't understand me
[1:03:35] they'll reject me affection
[1:03:38] but if i do that this will happen
[1:03:42] reasoning
[1:03:44] and every time that i failed god is
[1:03:47] because i allowed the senses
[1:03:49] to supersede the sixth sense
[1:03:52] but there's been many times by the grace
[1:03:54] of god the sixth sense has superseded
[1:03:56] all the other senses and it's proved to
[1:03:58] be right
[1:04:00] when nothing else would declare it it's
[1:04:02] proved to be right
[1:04:04] amen when i when we come to the message
[1:04:07] we had nothing nothing nothing nothing
[1:04:10] but books
[1:04:11] and tapes we didn't go to a church we
[1:04:14] didn't have fellowship we didn't have
[1:04:15] other believers around
[1:04:16] all we had was books and tapes and
[1:04:18] everybody we
[1:04:19] knew disagreed with us and thought we
[1:04:20] were wrong
[1:04:22] and all the reasoning all the affection
[1:04:26] all the memory of bible training from
[1:04:27] the time you're a toddler
[1:04:29] amen all speaks against this message
[1:04:33] amen and i think back how did i ever
[1:04:35] make it through
[1:04:36] how did i ever keep pushing i was 21
[1:04:39] years old
[1:04:40] newly married amen all kinds of pressure
[1:04:42] from outside
[1:04:43] the family thought we were crazy thought
[1:04:45] we were young 21 years old don't know
[1:04:47] anything no come around
[1:04:48] started pressuring us from the church
[1:04:49] pressuring us from family
[1:04:51] printing stacks of material hey you know
[1:04:53] a quarter of a ream of paper
[1:04:55] on things that proved that brother ben
[1:04:56] was a false prophet
[1:04:58] as a 21 year old kid i could say that
[1:05:02] now
[1:05:04] back then i thought i was all growing up
[1:05:08] and i think how did we make it how do we
[1:05:11] make it
[1:05:12] no support system nobody explaining it
[1:05:15] nothing all we had were books and tapes
[1:05:17] amen but there was a presence there amen
[1:05:19] that was awakening something on the
[1:05:21] inside that was saying this is the way
[1:05:23] walking in it amen
[1:05:24] i couldn't reason i couldn't understand
[1:05:26] it and then my emotions would go
[1:05:27] backwards my reasoning would be
[1:05:29] different
[1:05:31] but it was a sick sense that pushed
[1:05:34] through
[1:05:35] all the other senses and then
[1:05:38] all of a sudden you go back for years
[1:05:40] years you look back and you say
[1:05:42] it was god it was god it was god it was
[1:05:44] god it was god
[1:05:45] amen it wasn't any human it wasn't any
[1:05:48] human effort
[1:05:49] it wasn't any human ability everything
[1:05:51] on the human level was trying to stop us
[1:05:53] from moving forward
[1:05:54] but there was something inside that said
[1:05:56] this is the truth
[1:05:58] what about that i don't know i heard
[1:05:59] this i don't know i mean
[1:06:01] i heard all kinds of tales
[1:06:04] you know my grandpa was a wonderful man
[1:06:08] but he was in the pentecostal circles
[1:06:09] all down he was in the chautauqua
[1:06:11] meetings and he
[1:06:12] and he knew brother sullivan really well
[1:06:14] who put together to talk with meetings
[1:06:15] down in middletown
[1:06:17] and grandpa you would tell me well this
[1:06:18] man he went to brother ban brother bam
[1:06:20] said this and
[1:06:21] this man said you used to follow brother
[1:06:22] bam until until william branham got off
[1:06:24] on this and got off on that and this is
[1:06:26] my grandpa who i respect more than any
[1:06:28] other human being on the face of the
[1:06:30] earth and i couldn't answer his
[1:06:32] questions and i didn't know if it was
[1:06:34] true or not true
[1:06:35] but i couldn't stop believing this
[1:06:37] message
[1:06:40] it wasn't intellect it wasn't emotion it
[1:06:42] wasn't willpower it wasn't reasoning it
[1:06:44] sure wasn't sight amen
[1:06:48] it was god it was the sixth sense
[1:06:51] and the sixth sense can get you through
[1:06:53] that what else can it get you through
[1:06:55] everything in life
[1:07:02] back up here and read this out of the
[1:07:03] super sense again
[1:07:06] you'll bring all other five senses under
[1:07:08] control of that super sense
[1:07:09] for it's far above the natural sense as
[1:07:12] a spiritual man is above the natural
[1:07:14] it's
[1:07:14] it's it's as far and as high as the
[1:07:16] heavens is above the natural man
[1:07:19] and his five senses it makes you believe
[1:07:21] things that you cannot see
[1:07:23] it makes you act where you do not think
[1:07:24] the five senses would ever think about
[1:07:26] him
[1:07:27] the devil can get into those five senses
[1:07:29] and lie to you
[1:07:30] but he cannot touch that supersense
[1:07:34] that's far beyond his reach
[1:07:37] amen that come from god it's called
[1:07:41] faith faith
[1:07:42] is that great thing and the five senses
[1:07:44] does not control the sixth sense but the
[1:07:46] sixth sense controls the five senses
[1:07:48] the super sense controls the natural
[1:07:50] senses and the five senses is see
[1:07:52] taste feel smell here and the super
[1:07:54] sense is something that'll make you
[1:07:56] believe god's word
[1:07:57] for that's the only thing it'll speak
[1:07:59] about and it'll make you believe for
[1:08:01] things that you can't see
[1:08:02] taste feel smell or hear because it'll
[1:08:05] take god's word
[1:08:06] and it will deliver that word to you and
[1:08:09] make you walk contrary to any other
[1:08:11] thing there is but god's word
[1:08:13] by faith faith does it now in giving
[1:08:15] this illustration of the senses the
[1:08:17] natural man is born
[1:08:19] with these senses so they are nature
[1:08:21] given senses
[1:08:22] and that's really and that's really only
[1:08:25] thing he'll ever know about
[1:08:27] in his intellectual thinking he can only
[1:08:29] think as a man
[1:08:30] he can see as a man he can understand as
[1:08:32] a man he can hear as a man
[1:08:34] but when he becomes governed or
[1:08:36] regenerated or we call it born again
[1:08:38] then that sixth supersense takes a hold
[1:08:41] of him
[1:08:42] and in doing so the supersense raises
[1:08:44] him up to a spot to where he has faith
[1:08:46] to believe things
[1:08:47] that he could not hear things that he
[1:08:49] could not see
[1:08:50] understandings that he could not
[1:08:52] understand
[1:08:54] understandings that he could not
[1:08:56] understand
[1:08:58] if there's something in the message you
[1:08:59] cannot understand now stick with the
[1:09:02] sixth sense it'll lift you to a spot
[1:09:03] where you can understand what you can't
[1:09:05] understand
[1:09:08] don't try to understand first believe if
[1:09:11] god's put it in your heart to believe
[1:09:13] stick with the sixth sense amen and
[1:09:15] watch god
[1:09:16] lift you to a place and all of a sudden
[1:09:18] it's amazing because one thing you try
[1:09:20] and you push and you try to understand
[1:09:22] and push against something
[1:09:23] and you come up with all kinds of wild
[1:09:25] ideas and things that don't fit
[1:09:27] and no understanding but let the sixth
[1:09:29] sense raise you up one time and all of a
[1:09:31] sudden
[1:09:32] click bang it's there you didn't push
[1:09:34] you didn't strength you didn't tie two
[1:09:36] things together
[1:09:37] you didn't manipulate a scripture you
[1:09:38] didn't take a quote and massage it
[1:09:40] around and shove it into place
[1:09:42] all of a sudden it just opened and you
[1:09:43] see it
[1:09:45] that's the sixth sense let that lift you
[1:09:48] up
[1:09:48] to understand things that you could not
[1:09:51] understand
[1:09:53] he believes it anyhow because he's
[1:09:54] governed by that sixth sense that super
[1:09:56] sense
[1:09:57] oh how marvelous it is to know it and to
[1:09:59] think how simple it is to believe
[1:10:04] now you cannot believe it until you are
[1:10:05] regenerated
[1:10:07] the bible said that no man can call
[1:10:09] jesus the christ only by the holy ghost
[1:10:10] we went through that last week
[1:10:12] and it's been such a stumbling block
[1:10:14] especially to the pentecostal believing
[1:10:15] people
[1:10:16] when they hear me say that jesus said
[1:10:18] saint john 5 24
[1:10:20] he that heareth my word and believe on
[1:10:21] him that sent me has eternal life
[1:10:23] eternal life comes from god alone
[1:10:25] and no man can save jesus as christ only
[1:10:28] by the holy ghost
[1:10:30] you're only taking what somebody else
[1:10:32] said what you've learned by
[1:10:33] intellectual what you learned by the
[1:10:36] nature five senses
[1:10:37] but when the sixth sense comes in the
[1:10:39] holy spirit it takes away all the
[1:10:41] reasonings of these six senses and five
[1:10:43] senses
[1:10:44] of five senses and lifts you up into the
[1:10:46] sixth sense
[1:10:47] to make you believe things that you
[1:10:49] can't see taste feel smell or hear
[1:10:52] does something to you then you can say
[1:10:54] jesus is the christ because you have
[1:10:56] witnessed it
[1:10:56] not what intellectual teaching has
[1:10:58] taught you but what you've experienced
[1:11:03] i'm going to finish this quote but i
[1:11:05] want to stop here for a minute
[1:11:07] this is why intellectual teaching
[1:11:10] in getting somebody to give a verbal
[1:11:12] confession of jesus christ will never
[1:11:14] equal to salvation
[1:11:18] because that's not faith that's
[1:11:21] intellectual reasoning and that's the
[1:11:22] ability to repeat words
[1:11:24] and say i believe that they're true
[1:11:25] words but unless that's the sixth sense
[1:11:27] on the soul there's no salvation
[1:11:30] it's just words it's just understanding
[1:11:33] like you understand math or you can read
[1:11:35] a book
[1:11:35] and you can take an exam and you can you
[1:11:37] can answer the questions correctly on
[1:11:39] the exam
[1:11:41] but that's not that's not salvation
[1:11:45] what is the sixth sense to do then
[1:11:46] brother bannon why do the sixth sense
[1:11:49] come the sixth sense come for this
[1:11:51] reason pay attention the sixth sense
[1:11:53] come for this reason
[1:11:54] now the sixth sense is the faith that
[1:11:56] supersense now the sixth sense come for
[1:11:59] this reason only
[1:12:00] that was to make the five senses in you
[1:12:03] deny anything that's contrary to god's
[1:12:05] word
[1:12:06] that's what the sixth sense is for the
[1:12:08] scripture speaks of casting down
[1:12:09] reasoning
[1:12:10] it's far beyond anything that the five
[1:12:12] senses would have to say about it
[1:12:13] now get ready for a healing service we
[1:12:15] believe it you walk by that sixth sense
[1:12:17] you talk by that sixth sense you live by
[1:12:19] that sixth sense
[1:12:20] you die by that sixth sense and rise by
[1:12:23] that sixth sense
[1:12:24] the super sense something that's in you
[1:12:26] that's different
[1:12:27] from what the natural man is
[1:12:30] in apparently a couple of paragraphs he
[1:12:32] says the sixth sense has come
[1:12:33] upon the human being to make them deny
[1:12:36] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:12:38] god
[1:12:40] what was the system given for what was
[1:12:42] the purpose what was the reason of the
[1:12:43] sixth sense
[1:12:44] to deny anything that's contrary to
[1:12:47] god's word
[1:12:48] anything in your mind anything in your
[1:12:51] emotions
[1:12:52] anything in your history your past your
[1:12:54] reasonings your
[1:12:55] memory anything in your affections
[1:12:58] anything that denies the word
[1:13:00] the sixth sense here is to cast it down
[1:13:05] and you have trouble struggling
[1:13:06] sometimes to believe that you're a child
[1:13:08] of god and god has delivered you from
[1:13:09] sin but you remember my past don't you
[1:13:11] know amen the sixth sense here is to get
[1:13:14] you to cast
[1:13:14] down your memory
[1:13:19] but i did this and i did that amen the
[1:13:21] sixth sense says
[1:13:22] god has put in the sea of gift for
[1:13:24] forgetfulness gets out of the mind of
[1:13:26] god
[1:13:26] amen it does not exist i never sinned in
[1:13:30] the first place
[1:13:31] the sixth sense here is to cast down the
[1:13:33] memory
[1:13:35] to cast down the reasoning that's what
[1:13:38] the sixth sense is here for
[1:13:40] that's why it was given amen because you
[1:13:42] come to this life trapped in this body
[1:13:44] stuck with this spirit amen shrouded by
[1:13:47] these senses that
[1:13:48] are limited and limitations upon us
[1:13:51] what's holding us down is our senses
[1:13:54] what is holding us back from the
[1:13:56] spiritual realities is our senses
[1:13:57] what was holding nicodemus back was the
[1:13:59] senses
[1:14:01] amen but when the sick sins come amen
[1:14:04] what was
[1:14:05] what was holding what was holding them
[1:14:07] back from the supernatural
[1:14:08] amen was the senses but when you can
[1:14:11] give something that will cast
[1:14:12] down the senses amen and cast down
[1:14:15] anything that will deny the word amen it
[1:14:17] will lift you to a place where all
[1:14:18] things are possible
[1:14:21] why because i believe the word if it's
[1:14:23] in the word it's possible
[1:14:25] if it's in the word it's for me
[1:14:28] the sixth sense has come upon human
[1:14:30] beings to make them deny
[1:14:32] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:14:34] god
[1:14:37] your own affection wrong
[1:14:41] your own memory cast it out your own
[1:14:44] thinking
[1:14:45] and reasonings it's here to move that
[1:14:48] out of the way
[1:14:51] let's look at john chapter 5 verse 24.
[1:15:05] verily verily i say unto you john 5 24
[1:15:09] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:15:10] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:15:13] shall not come into condemnation
[1:15:14] condemnation but his past
[1:15:16] from death and to life 1965 brother rem
[1:15:20] says in the message it is the rising of
[1:15:22] the son
[1:15:23] so let me straighten a little scripture
[1:15:24] here for you i think we're off the phone
[1:15:26] but we're still
[1:15:27] here saint john 5 24 said he that
[1:15:29] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:15:31] that sent me
[1:15:32] has everlasting life now look i go down
[1:15:34] the street and just take that
[1:15:36] literally and what it what it is without
[1:15:38] this spiritual understanding not making
[1:15:40] it safe nothing else but just
[1:15:42] saying what it says see the right word
[1:15:44] here in the greek and the original it
[1:15:46] says he that understandeth my word
[1:15:49] now to prove that's right i go down here
[1:15:52] and here's a drunk coming along the
[1:15:54] street with some other man's wife in his
[1:15:56] arm and
[1:15:56] cussing and taking god's name in vain
[1:15:58] and everything else like that i said did
[1:16:00] you hear what that preacher said
[1:16:01] did you yeah i heard it that don't mean
[1:16:04] he's got eternal life
[1:16:05] see he that understandeth my word
[1:16:09] he that is an eagle
[1:16:13] it's not somebody that says
[1:16:16] well it doesn't matter what your
[1:16:20] intellect believes or can receive
[1:16:22] or yeah i heard with my ears that man i
[1:16:24] heard it and i heard what he said
[1:16:26] and no it's he that understand this and
[1:16:28] the understanding is not the
[1:16:30] intellectual understanding
[1:16:31] but it's the understanding that comes
[1:16:33] from the soul from the sixth sense
[1:16:34] the revelation understanding he says he
[1:16:37] that understands my word
[1:16:38] he is that he he that is an eagle
[1:16:42] now brother branham i want more
[1:16:43] scripture than that all right
[1:16:45] my sheep hear my voice a stranger they
[1:16:48] won't follow
[1:16:49] his voice is his word in this age and a
[1:16:52] stranger they're not going to follow
[1:16:53] they're going to follow the shepherd
[1:16:57] let's go to matthew 13. there's just a
[1:17:00] couple more things i want to hit
[1:17:01] here before we wind down matthew 13.
[1:17:14] matthew 13 and 10.
[1:17:21] the disciples came the disciples came
[1:17:25] and said unto him why speak us down to
[1:17:26] them in parables
[1:17:28] he answered and said unto them because
[1:17:30] it is given unto you to know the mystery
[1:17:33] of the kingdom of heaven but to them is
[1:17:35] not given
[1:17:37] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[1:17:39] and he shall have more abundance but
[1:17:41] whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:17:42] taken away
[1:17:43] even that he hath therefore speak i to
[1:17:46] them in parables because
[1:17:47] they seeing see not in hearing they hear
[1:17:51] not
[1:17:51] neither do they understand and in them
[1:17:54] is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias
[1:17:55] which says by hearing ye shall hear
[1:17:57] and shall not understand and seeing ye
[1:17:59] shall see
[1:18:00] and shall not perceive for this people's
[1:18:03] heart is waxed gross
[1:18:04] it's grown thick and their ears are dull
[1:18:08] of hearing in their
[1:18:08] eyes they have clothes lest at any time
[1:18:11] they should see with their
[1:18:12] eyes and hear with their ears and should
[1:18:14] understand with their heart
[1:18:15] and should be converted and i should
[1:18:17] heal them
[1:18:19] so what is conversion hearing with your
[1:18:22] ears
[1:18:24] not these ears because they heard him
[1:18:27] with these ears
[1:18:29] and they saw him with these eyes but
[1:18:31] there has to be another set of eyes
[1:18:33] and another pair of ears that hear him
[1:18:37] and understand with their heart
[1:18:40] and should be converted and i should
[1:18:43] heal them but blessed are your eyes
[1:18:46] for they see in your ears for they hear
[1:18:51] guess what the disciples saw the same
[1:18:53] thing they saw
[1:18:56] jesus is speaking of different seeing
[1:18:59] he's speaking of different hearing
[1:19:08] brother branham says in the super sense
[1:19:10] again
[1:19:12] by that same sense god spake when there
[1:19:14] was nothing
[1:19:16] what is that sense that supersense is
[1:19:17] god the faith of god in you the part of
[1:19:19] god that comes into you
[1:19:21] gives you the super sense by that same
[1:19:23] super sense god framed the world
[1:19:25] together with things which was not
[1:19:27] and did not appear i want you to think
[1:19:30] about this
[1:19:33] he said what is that supersense is god
[1:19:34] the faith of god in you
[1:19:37] not the faith of god not the faith in
[1:19:40] god in you
[1:19:41] but the faith of god in you
[1:19:44] the same faith god has is the same faith
[1:19:47] that's inside you and that's what he
[1:19:50] says it's the faith of god
[1:19:51] in you the part of god that comes into
[1:19:53] you gives you the super sense
[1:19:55] by that same super sense the same thing
[1:19:59] god framed the world together with
[1:20:00] things which was not in
[1:20:02] and which was not and did not appear he
[1:20:05] spoke his word and believed his word and
[1:20:07] the word
[1:20:08] shook into existence so the same thing
[1:20:12] god
[1:20:12] had god had faith in his word
[1:20:16] amen it was the faith of god and the
[1:20:18] faith of god would speak his word
[1:20:20] to believe in his word and when he
[1:20:21] believed in his word the word come to
[1:20:23] pass
[1:20:23] and now that same faith of god is coming
[1:20:26] to us
[1:20:28] the same faith that framed the world
[1:20:30] that spoke it and believed it and come
[1:20:32] to pass
[1:20:33] now he's spoken the word and we believe
[1:20:35] it and it comes to pass
[1:20:43] you know i just want to i just want to
[1:20:45] say this for a minute
[1:20:48] when brother van says to the disciples
[1:20:51] they seeing don't see and hearing they
[1:20:55] don't hear
[1:20:57] but your eyes see in your ears here
[1:21:00] jesus is not speaking physical friends
[1:21:04] brother branham came and over and over
[1:21:08] he did the sign of the messiah
[1:21:11] and millions saw it
[1:21:16] but you saw it and they didn't
[1:21:21] well you know but i wasn't there i
[1:21:23] wasn't sitting in the meeting i wasn't
[1:21:25] there there was you know
[1:21:26] there was a hundred thousand in that
[1:21:27] meeting or fifty thousand or ten
[1:21:29] thousand or fifteen thousand
[1:21:30] they saw the discernment there was
[1:21:33] thousands
[1:21:33] that saw brother branham turn his back
[1:21:35] to the crowd and begin to discern the
[1:21:37] thoughts of the people's hearts that
[1:21:38] were behind him
[1:21:39] and he was replaying the scene on the
[1:21:42] plains of memory
[1:21:43] when elohim came in a body of flesh
[1:21:47] any any any and he understood what
[1:21:50] what sarah was thinking in the tent
[1:21:51] behind him and began to discern the
[1:21:53] thoughts in her heart behind him and
[1:21:54] began to declare what was going
[1:21:56] on and brother bannon would set the
[1:21:57] scene with two amen with two messengers
[1:22:00] going down into sodom
[1:22:01] billy graham and oral roberts and one
[1:22:03] stayed up with the elect group and that
[1:22:05] one could discern the thoughts of sarah
[1:22:06] behind him and he would turn around
[1:22:08] amen they were all there they saw it but
[1:22:10] i would like to say this
[1:22:12] they saw it but they didn't see it and
[1:22:14] in seeing they didn't see
[1:22:17] but you saw it you'd be like well i
[1:22:20] didn't see the video that that wasn't on
[1:22:21] the video i saw of deep calls to leave i
[1:22:23] never turned his back
[1:22:24] no friends you saw it with the eyes you
[1:22:26] were supposed to see it with
[1:22:28] because you didn't need to see it with
[1:22:29] these eyes
[1:22:33] thomas comes to jesus and jesus says
[1:22:34] touch my hands touch us he says oh
[1:22:36] thou art the son of god amen thou art
[1:22:38] god he says because you see
[1:22:40] you believe but blessed are those who
[1:22:42] don't see and yet believe
[1:22:45] because we've seen him amen we seen him
[1:22:48] on calvary
[1:22:49] did you see him on calvary i mean with
[1:22:51] which eyes did you see him crucified
[1:22:53] which eyes did you see him bleeding for
[1:22:55] you and dying for you and paying the
[1:22:56] price of your redemption
[1:22:57] it wasn't these eyes it wasn't necessary
[1:23:00] to see it with these
[1:23:01] eyes it was necessary to see it with
[1:23:03] another set of eyes that could
[1:23:05] understand
[1:23:07] to hear it millions and millions of
[1:23:10] people have heard the prophet's voice
[1:23:12] amen and all they hear is a voice of a
[1:23:14] man with an accent from kentucky
[1:23:16] amen but they didn't hear the son of man
[1:23:19] they didn't hear jesus christ they heard
[1:23:21] the accent they heard
[1:23:23] the what the what the metal tape was
[1:23:25] able to record and they hear it crackle
[1:23:27] they hear some crowd noise and then
[1:23:29] they hear the man speaking but they
[1:23:31] heard but didn't hear
[1:23:33] when you hear you hear
[1:23:37] what is that it's the sixth sense on the
[1:23:39] inside the seeing you see
[1:23:41] and hearing you hear and now brother
[1:23:43] branham is playing out the scene
[1:23:45] amen elohim stepped into a body of flesh
[1:23:48] amen to
[1:23:48] to bring the promise to abraham and the
[1:23:51] same thing is taking place in our day
[1:23:53] amen and abraham's seed the royal seed
[1:23:55] is receiving the promised son
[1:24:00] and how do you know it because i saw it
[1:24:04] i saw the scene from the plains of
[1:24:06] memory i saw it
[1:24:08] not i saw a man turn around and discern
[1:24:10] that's not what i saw
[1:24:12] i saw god come down and replay this
[1:24:15] scene
[1:24:16] for me i saw it
[1:24:20] because i have eyes to see and ears to
[1:24:23] hear
[1:24:29] so many people saw a cloud
[1:24:34] anybody with eyesight could see a cloud
[1:24:38] there was thousands who reported the
[1:24:40] sighting of the cloud
[1:24:42] they took pictures of the cloud and said
[1:24:43] i see the cloud
[1:24:45] that's a strange cloud that's an odd
[1:24:46] cloud scientists would collect
[1:24:49] those pictures and study over those
[1:24:51] pictures and observe
[1:24:52] every every possible angle and
[1:24:55] everything they could to discern
[1:24:57] that cloud and they were looking at it
[1:25:00] and not
[1:25:00] seeing it you believe that
[1:25:05] and a scientist a scientist was
[1:25:07] collecting every picture that he could
[1:25:10] find
[1:25:10] and he was getting every eyewitness
[1:25:12] account and all the details he was
[1:25:14] collecting
[1:25:14] all the data to put his the greatest
[1:25:17] minds amen
[1:25:18] to to work on trying to solve the
[1:25:20] mystery of this cloud
[1:25:21] they saw the cloud but they did not see
[1:25:23] the cloud
[1:25:28] then brother branham holds up the cloud
[1:25:30] and and he begins to say it's that
[1:25:32] vision i had
[1:25:33] a pyramid of angels see the one with the
[1:25:35] swept back wings and see this
[1:25:37] and then people will look and be like
[1:25:38] yeah i can see like the white yeah i
[1:25:40] could see
[1:25:40] there may be some angels that's the
[1:25:42] angels okay i see it's angels
[1:25:45] and they didn't see it
[1:25:49] then in the message brother branham
[1:25:50] would say turn it to the right
[1:25:54] he turned it to the right and there he
[1:25:56] could see the face of christ just like
[1:25:58] in hoffman's head of christ
[1:26:01] he would take and he would show to the
[1:26:02] crowd he would just explain the story
[1:26:04] turn it to the right
[1:26:05] i am looking at it right no to the right
[1:26:07] so he turns it to the right he says
[1:26:08] see his eyes see his nose see his beard
[1:26:11] his black beard and there's people like
[1:26:14] oh
[1:26:15] oh some people are like
[1:26:20] there's some shadows in there there's a
[1:26:22] few little shadowy spots and
[1:26:24] some people will see and say i see it i
[1:26:25] see i see it's just like hoffman's head
[1:26:27] of christ
[1:26:28] wigged in angels and friends they still
[1:26:32] didn't see it they saw the picture
[1:26:38] but they didn't see us coming
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:41] they understood the description the
[1:26:43] prophet gave of the picture
[1:26:45] they understood that the white thing was
[1:26:48] the wings of angels seven of them all
[1:26:50] together
[1:26:51] to outline the face of christ they could
[1:26:53] turn the picture
[1:26:54] they could look at the picture and they
[1:26:55] could see that yes i could see the
[1:26:58] shadows and the representation
[1:26:59] especially if i get the black and white
[1:27:00] one and i can see it looks just like
[1:27:02] hoffman's head of christ
[1:27:05] but seeing they did not see
[1:27:14] how come you see how come when you see
[1:27:17] the cloud
[1:27:20] it's not the cloud that you see
[1:27:23] it's not just the angels that you see
[1:27:26] it's not just the shadow
[1:27:28] that makes his eyes and his nose and his
[1:27:30] beard
[1:27:32] but when you look at that cloud it's
[1:27:34] more than the print
[1:27:36] life magazine went out and that image
[1:27:39] went all over the world
[1:27:41] and tens of thousands maybe hundreds of
[1:27:43] thousands i don't know how many
[1:27:44] thousands and thousands
[1:27:46] looked at the picture i went out in a
[1:27:48] science magazine
[1:27:49] amen they looked at the picture but they
[1:27:51] didn't see anything
[1:27:53] i mean they saw the white mark and they
[1:27:55] saw
[1:27:56] they didn't see anything seen but not
[1:27:59] seeing
[1:28:02] we hear the tape we look at the cloud
[1:28:07] it's not water vapor
[1:28:13] i mean if god used water vapor that's
[1:28:14] fine i don't care if he used water vapor
[1:28:16] or what he used
[1:28:19] i don't it's not the material
[1:28:22] that cloud is not the material it's made
[1:28:24] out of
[1:28:27] it's seven inches it's seven angels yes
[1:28:29] it's seven
[1:28:30] angels brother turn it to the right
[1:28:33] that's our lord up there
[1:28:37] i'd like to read that out of the rising
[1:28:41] of the sun
[1:28:43] but it said look what we've seen in this
[1:28:46] day the quickening power has come to us
[1:28:48] to open the seven seals
[1:28:50] what was that the intelligence of a man
[1:28:52] no the quickening power of god
[1:28:54] see the quickening power of god foretold
[1:28:56] this would take place see the quickening
[1:28:58] power of god made the world testify to
[1:29:00] it
[1:29:00] it's the truth the angel of the lord i
[1:29:02] told you was around
[1:29:03] in the pillar of fire quickening the
[1:29:06] quickening power let the world testify
[1:29:08] that it's the truth
[1:29:09] and in that they didn't know what it was
[1:29:12] and we knew
[1:29:13] just looked us away it's our lord up
[1:29:15] there
[1:29:16] you see you could be sitting in the
[1:29:20] meeting that day
[1:29:21] and bobbing your head and seeing the
[1:29:24] outline of the face and the shadowy part
[1:29:26] of the eyes and the black beard and you
[1:29:28] could see
[1:29:29] that but you still didn't see what it
[1:29:32] was
[1:29:35] because there's some it's a picture on a
[1:29:36] wall
[1:29:38] to some it's something that happened in
[1:29:40] the sky in 1963
[1:29:42] but when i see it it's my husband
[1:29:46] it's my bridegroom it's my lord
[1:29:49] and what has he done he's come what has
[1:29:51] he come for he's come to receive his
[1:29:53] bride
[1:29:54] where is he receiving his bride he's
[1:29:55] receiving her right now receiving her
[1:29:57] out of the systems
[1:29:58] out of the denominations out of the
[1:30:00] senses and bringing
[1:30:01] that bride and to himself he's uniting
[1:30:04] now with his bride
[1:30:05] he is coming that's my bridegroom that's
[1:30:07] my husband
[1:30:08] that's the revealed word that's come to
[1:30:10] me
[1:30:12] it's not a picture on the wall it's not
[1:30:14] water vapor in the sky
[1:30:16] it's my lord coming to receive his bride
[1:30:21] if you see the face hoffman's head of
[1:30:23] christ that's wonderful but if you see
[1:30:24] your husband coming to unite with you
[1:30:26] that's better
[1:30:29] because you can see and not see or you
[1:30:32] can see and see
[1:30:34] and i want to see and see
[1:30:39] i don't want to see what brother branham
[1:30:40] described and only go
[1:30:42] that way and tell him to oh if i look at
[1:30:44] huffman's head of christ i was big i
[1:30:45] could see the comparison
[1:30:46] i got it that's not it friends
[1:30:50] that's only a symbol that's only a token
[1:30:52] that's only a representation of what
[1:30:54] actually is happening
[1:30:55] the headship is here uniting with the
[1:30:57] body the bridegroom and the bride are
[1:30:58] uniting together
[1:31:00] the husband has come to receive his
[1:31:01] bride and if you don't see that
[1:31:04] you don't see the cloud i don't care
[1:31:07] what your eyes see or what the intellect
[1:31:09] can make out or what the reasoning can
[1:31:10] see in the shadows and blotches and
[1:31:12] sweat back rings if you don't see that
[1:31:14] you don't see the cloud
[1:31:18] because the sixth sense can pick up on
[1:31:20] more
[1:31:22] what does it mean
[1:31:25] he said look this way it's our lord up
[1:31:27] there he's the one who opened those
[1:31:29] seals
[1:31:30] he is those seals
[1:31:34] now all of a sudden the seals become
[1:31:35] more than white horse black horse red
[1:31:37] horse
[1:31:40] i can understand white horse and black
[1:31:42] horse and i yeah and
[1:31:44] i can understand the timing of this
[1:31:45] horse riding and you conquer no arrows i
[1:31:47] can see what no arrows mean
[1:31:52] and i can take what the prophet said and
[1:31:53] i can do it intellectually and i can
[1:31:55] make a
[1:31:56] a coloring book on it or i can make a
[1:31:58] workbook and say the white horse is this
[1:32:00] and
[1:32:00] the symbol of of no arrows means this
[1:32:02] and a bow and no he's given a crown
[1:32:04] and oh yeah the pope and
[1:32:08] and still not see it
[1:32:11] what is the opening of the seals
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] he's the one who opened those seals he
[1:32:18] is those
[1:32:20] seals for the whole word of god
[1:32:23] is christ and christ is the seals that
[1:32:26] was opened
[1:32:27] what is the opening of the seals
[1:32:29] revealing
[1:32:30] christ your bridegroom is here to unite
[1:32:34] with you
[1:32:36] and the very seven angels which
[1:32:37] represented the seven churches all
[1:32:39] completed
[1:32:40] so why why was the head outlined with
[1:32:42] seven angels
[1:32:43] to show that the seven church ages are
[1:32:45] completed
[1:32:47] and the completion of the seven church
[1:32:49] ages will bring the full revelation of
[1:32:51] the seven church ages in the end time
[1:32:53] which is the revealed word which is the
[1:32:55] headship because he is the word
[1:32:57] and the headship of the word shown that
[1:32:59] it's the collection of truth through
[1:33:00] seven church ages
[1:33:01] bringing us back to the original intent
[1:33:03] of the word is now here
[1:33:05] to unite with you personally if you see
[1:33:07] that you see the cloud
[1:33:11] amen i want to see that cloud
[1:33:14] not just the picture but i want to see
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:20] when brother man turns his back to the
[1:33:21] crowd it's not just an amazing thing
[1:33:25] a man that can know the thoughts of this
[1:33:26] woman over here and that was a man about
[1:33:28] five foot six and he had on a gray suit
[1:33:30] and that woman over there was in a red
[1:33:31] dress and he told her she had cancer
[1:33:33] that you're still not seeing it
[1:33:36] it's god it's the sign of the messiah
[1:33:40] it's the son of man he's here bringing
[1:33:42] the promise to abraham's seed
[1:33:44] if you see that then you see what that
[1:33:47] discernment was
[1:33:50] he said now the fairy seven angels which
[1:33:54] represents the seven churches all
[1:33:55] completed
[1:33:56] and we couldn't even see it they did
[1:33:58] they took the picture not us
[1:34:01] brother bannon couldn't see the seven
[1:34:03] church ages were finished
[1:34:06] he didn't see the cloud in the sky they
[1:34:08] took the picture not
[1:34:09] us they seen it not us but what brother
[1:34:12] branham seen
[1:34:14] he saw the reality he saw the real thing
[1:34:17] they saw the picture he saw the reality
[1:34:22] let's read that again 7 30 is all
[1:34:24] completed and we couldn't even see it
[1:34:26] they did they took the picture not us
[1:34:28] and there he is standing there supreme
[1:34:30] judge showing that he's alpha
[1:34:32] and omega the beginning and the end what
[1:34:35] identification and
[1:34:36] quickening power did that to us
[1:34:38] quickening power
[1:34:39] lets us see his coming
[1:34:42] it's not a picture it's a person
[1:34:48] it's not a doctrine it's my lord
[1:34:51] it's not a teaching it's my bridegroom
[1:34:56] it's my mate the revealed word he's
[1:34:59] coming
[1:35:00] to receive me and by faith
[1:35:04] he has received me
[1:35:09] amen i want to finish i want to
[1:35:13] move over to another scripture matthew
[1:35:14] 18 and i want to finish with this
[1:35:16] thought
[1:35:19] matthew 18 verse 1.
[1:35:32] matthew 18 1 at the same time
[1:35:36] came the disciples unto jesus saying
[1:35:38] who's the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:35:39] heaven
[1:35:40] and jesus called a little child unto him
[1:35:42] and set him in the midst of them
[1:35:45] and said verily i say unto you except ye
[1:35:48] be converted and become as little
[1:35:50] children you shall not enter into the
[1:35:52] kingdom of heaven
[1:35:53] and whosoever therefore shall humble
[1:35:55] himself as this little child
[1:35:57] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[1:35:59] heaven
[1:36:00] and whoso shall receive one such little
[1:36:03] child in my name
[1:36:04] receiveth me now i want to change our
[1:36:07] thinking a little bit on this scripture
[1:36:10] because jesus pulls a little child in to
[1:36:12] use that child as an example
[1:36:15] and he says who's the greatest in the
[1:36:17] kingdom of heaven
[1:36:18] and jesus pulls a little child over
[1:36:21] called a little child unto him and set
[1:36:22] him in the middle of them so they could
[1:36:23] all see this little child
[1:36:25] and he's using the child as the
[1:36:27] represent representation or the token of
[1:36:29] what he wants to explain
[1:36:31] but all of his comments are not about
[1:36:32] that little child
[1:36:35] all the comments that he makes are about
[1:36:37] somebody that's converted to become like
[1:36:39] a little child
[1:36:41] so you understand don't make all these
[1:36:43] comments related to that little child
[1:36:45] that was only a symbol he was using to
[1:36:47] show what must happen
[1:36:48] you must be born again so he's telling
[1:36:52] you you must be born again you must have
[1:36:53] simple childlike faith
[1:36:55] the sixth sense must come to work and
[1:36:57] activate in your life
[1:36:58] and you must believe like a little child
[1:37:01] so let's read it again
[1:37:02] he said verily i say unto you except you
[1:37:04] be converted
[1:37:06] so now he's talking about people who are
[1:37:08] converted
[1:37:09] and become as little children you shall
[1:37:11] not enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:37:13] because you must be born again you must
[1:37:15] be converted and grow up into the full
[1:37:17] stature of christ you cannot see the
[1:37:20] kingdom of heaven
[1:37:21] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:37:23] as this little child
[1:37:25] the same as greatest in the kingdom of
[1:37:27] heaven
[1:37:29] and whosoever receive one such little
[1:37:31] child in my name
[1:37:32] receiveth me he's not talking about that
[1:37:36] little child
[1:37:38] he's talking about the one who's
[1:37:39] converted
[1:37:41] who shall receive one such little child
[1:37:43] that's the one who's
[1:37:44] humbled themselves and been converted
[1:37:48] one who receives a little child in my
[1:37:50] name
[1:37:51] receiveth me
[1:37:55] but whoso shall offend one of these
[1:37:56] little ones which believe in me
[1:37:59] it were better for him that a millstone
[1:38:01] were hanged about his neck
[1:38:02] and that he would drown in the depth of
[1:38:04] the sea woe into the world because of
[1:38:07] offenses for it must needs that offense
[1:38:09] has come
[1:38:10] but woe to that man by whom the offenses
[1:38:12] cometh
[1:38:13] let's get down to verse 11. take heed
[1:38:16] that you despise not one of these little
[1:38:18] ones
[1:38:19] he's not talking about children
[1:38:23] he's talking about the children of god
[1:38:26] the converted children of god who he's
[1:38:28] referring to that's who you don't offend
[1:38:31] that the children of god take heed that
[1:38:34] you despise not one of these little ones
[1:38:36] for i say unto you that in heaven their
[1:38:38] angels do always behold the face of my
[1:38:41] father
[1:38:42] which is in heaven who's he talking
[1:38:45] about
[1:38:47] converted children their angels
[1:38:50] always behold the face of my father look
[1:38:54] at the next verse
[1:38:55] for the son of man has come to save that
[1:38:57] which was lost
[1:38:58] he's not talking about little kids
[1:39:00] anymore
[1:39:01] he's talking about the seed of god who's
[1:39:04] the greatest in heaven
[1:39:06] heaven has cherubims archangels
[1:39:09] seraphims a whole heavenly host in the
[1:39:12] kingdom of heaven but who's the greatest
[1:39:13] the born-again sons and daughters of god
[1:39:15] those are the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:39:17] heaven
[1:39:18] those that can humble themselves and
[1:39:19] realize my senses don't tell me nothing
[1:39:21] i don't know anything i've got to take
[1:39:22] the word and become humble like a little
[1:39:24] child
[1:39:25] and just rely on faith
[1:39:28] and you're going to be if you receive
[1:39:30] one of these little children that's the
[1:39:31] born-again child of god if you receive
[1:39:32] one of them you receive me
[1:39:35] and you better not offend them if you
[1:39:36] offend them it's better than a millstone
[1:39:38] he's not talking about little kids he's
[1:39:41] talking about the children of god
[1:39:43] the elect seed of god he said take heed
[1:39:46] your spies not one of these verse 10
[1:39:47] again
[1:39:48] little ones for i say unto you this that
[1:39:50] in heaven their angels do always behold
[1:39:52] the face of my father which is in heaven
[1:39:54] for the son of man has come to save that
[1:39:56] which was lost
[1:40:00] remember you have to belong to him
[1:40:02] before you're lost
[1:40:04] you have to be his before you're lost
[1:40:07] if i lost something it was in my
[1:40:09] possession before i lost it
[1:40:11] so you have to be belonging to him you
[1:40:13] have to be in his possession before you
[1:40:15] can be lost
[1:40:15] so he's coming after his own
[1:40:20] how think you if a man have a hundred
[1:40:22] sheep and one of them have gone astray
[1:40:23] does he not leave the ninety and nine
[1:40:25] and goeth
[1:40:26] unto the mountains and seek that which
[1:40:28] has gone astray
[1:40:29] and if so be that he findeth that verily
[1:40:31] verily i say unto you he rejoices more
[1:40:33] of that sheep
[1:40:33] than of the nineteen nine which went not
[1:40:35] astray even so it is not the will of
[1:40:38] your father which is in heaven
[1:40:40] that one of these little ones should
[1:40:43] perish
[1:40:44] he's not talking about little kids
[1:40:46] anymore
[1:40:47] he's talking about the children of god
[1:40:52] and he says they're angels do always
[1:40:55] behold the face of the father be careful
[1:40:57] you treat them
[1:40:58] their angels always behold the face of
[1:41:00] our father meaning they have
[1:41:02] representation in heaven
[1:41:05] and because they have representation in
[1:41:07] heaven he's seeking to save which is
[1:41:09] lost
[1:41:10] amen because they already have
[1:41:11] representation in heaven
[1:41:13] they already belong to the father
[1:41:18] they're going to believe when they come
[1:41:20] in contact with the word because
[1:41:22] they already belong to the father they
[1:41:24] have the seed they are children of god
[1:41:26] they just haven't been converted yet
[1:41:31] here's what brother branham says they
[1:41:32] ask him this question
[1:41:34] questions and answers explain about each
[1:41:37] person's angel who abides with them from
[1:41:39] birth
[1:41:40] so now if you notice now this is pretty
[1:41:42] deep
[1:41:44] i want to say brother ben said this is
[1:41:46] pretty deep he's not talking about
[1:41:49] angels that are over there watching over
[1:41:50] all these little kids making sure they
[1:41:52] don't bump their knee
[1:41:53] i mean how does that work when kids are
[1:41:55] molested and murdered and fall and break
[1:41:57] bones all the time
[1:42:02] we got to change the nominational
[1:42:04] thinking and come to the message
[1:42:06] come to the word
[1:42:10] explain each person's angel abides with
[1:42:12] them from birth now notice this is
[1:42:13] pretty
[1:42:14] deep this isn't a denominational idea
[1:42:17] this isn't a little kid's version of the
[1:42:19] bible this is pretty deep
[1:42:22] now i never i just picked it up now part
[1:42:24] of it's wrote in type and the other one
[1:42:25] is in pencil he's talking about the
[1:42:26] question
[1:42:27] now there is an angel but this angel of
[1:42:29] the lord that are encamped about those
[1:42:31] that fear
[1:42:32] fears him now it isn't promised that
[1:42:34] sinners has angels
[1:42:37] only the redeemed has angels
[1:42:42] that's why when jesus is talking here
[1:42:44] and he's saying these little ones become
[1:42:45] like this one he's just using that child
[1:42:47] for an example he's not talking about
[1:42:48] all children little children
[1:42:50] all the little toddlers that's not he's
[1:42:51] talking about he's talking about you
[1:42:53] have to forget all you knew and become
[1:42:54] like a little child
[1:42:56] be born again and have simple faith and
[1:42:58] just believe the father
[1:43:01] and if you receive one of them you
[1:43:02] receive him if you offend one of him
[1:43:04] it's going to be bad for you
[1:43:05] because they're angels they have a
[1:43:06] representation in heaven you better be
[1:43:08] careful you treat them because they have
[1:43:10] a representation in heaven
[1:43:14] it's only the redeemed has angels do you
[1:43:16] know that the angel of the lord and camp
[1:43:17] about those that fear him
[1:43:19] now angels are messengers i want you to
[1:43:21] notice it's so perfect
[1:43:22] and it'll prove predestination to you
[1:43:32] you're not going to get an angel
[1:43:36] you already have an angel beholding the
[1:43:39] father's face
[1:43:40] and if you have an angel beholding the
[1:43:42] father's face then
[1:43:43] then the shepherd is here looking for
[1:43:45] his lost sheep because there's already a
[1:43:47] representation there
[1:43:48] of that sheep
[1:43:52] it proves predestination friends
[1:43:55] we can't pray lord give my child a
[1:43:58] guardian angel
[1:43:58] that's the denominational idea but the
[1:44:01] redeemed has angels
[1:44:05] it'll prove predestination to you now
[1:44:08] when a little baby is being formed under
[1:44:09] the mother's heart
[1:44:11] and your little children don't
[1:44:12] understand these things the lord gave
[1:44:13] you to mother and she carried you under
[1:44:15] her heart
[1:44:15] because you're close to her heart and
[1:44:17] then one day the lord came down and
[1:44:19] delivered you from mother's heart
[1:44:20] from away from her heart but you'll
[1:44:22] always be in her heart
[1:44:23] now while this little body is being
[1:44:25] formed the little natural body being
[1:44:27] formed in the mother
[1:44:28] there is a spiritual body of the earth
[1:44:32] catch this an earthly spirit
[1:44:36] there is a little body of the earth
[1:44:38] ready to receive this natural body
[1:44:41] as soon as it's born now the baby is
[1:44:43] born with live muscles a beating heart
[1:44:45] but no breath of life in it
[1:44:47] it's muscles twitching see then see if
[1:44:49] there was something different from that
[1:44:51] if there wasn't a spirit that had to
[1:44:53] come into it later
[1:44:55] then our breath could leave us and we
[1:44:57] would breathe no more and still be alive
[1:45:00] brother makes this simple is it to be
[1:45:02] alive
[1:45:03] you have the breath of life amen and so
[1:45:05] now there's an earthly spirit a spirit
[1:45:07] of the earth
[1:45:09] not eternal not in the heavens a spirit
[1:45:12] of the earth
[1:45:13] that when the child takes the breath of
[1:45:14] life that spirit comes in
[1:45:16] and it becomes a living person
[1:45:19] everybody gets that whether you're elect
[1:45:21] or not
[1:45:23] everybody gets that little spirit of the
[1:45:25] earth
[1:45:27] catch what he's saying
[1:45:30] because if not you could stop breathing
[1:45:32] and still be alive
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] so when the spirit goes out you die so
[1:45:39] he says
[1:45:42] but when this body doesn't receive
[1:45:43] oxygen from our breath and take an
[1:45:45] outtake of our lungs then we're dead
[1:45:47] now when the mother the little baby is
[1:45:49] dropped to the earth from the mother's
[1:45:50] heart dropped you understand what i'm
[1:45:52] saying
[1:45:53] when i'm birthed dropped
[1:45:56] the reason i'm saying it this way when
[1:45:58] the little baby is dropped what happens
[1:45:59] as soon as it comes forth if it doesn't
[1:46:01] start crying
[1:46:02] the doctor midwife or whatever will
[1:46:03] spank him
[1:46:05] stretch it it's got to have a got to
[1:46:08] have a shock and what happens
[1:46:09] notice mother she can be ever so mean
[1:46:12] and cruel but just before that baby's
[1:46:13] born there's a certain kindness that
[1:46:15] sets in
[1:46:16] did you ever notice a mother when she's
[1:46:17] to be mother there's something sweet
[1:46:19] about her
[1:46:20] she always takes on the sweetness it's
[1:46:22] because
[1:46:23] that little angel little spirit little
[1:46:25] messenger to this little tabernacle is
[1:46:26] ready to come forth into the world
[1:46:29] and when this little angel comes into
[1:46:30] the baby that's a little angel of the
[1:46:33] earth
[1:46:34] he's not talking about the one that
[1:46:36] beholds the father's face he's not
[1:46:38] talking about anything eternal he's
[1:46:39] talking about a
[1:46:40] natural spirit of the earth
[1:46:44] so that's why he's applying this to all
[1:46:47] mothers not just christian mothers
[1:46:48] all mothers of birth all babies not just
[1:46:50] elect babies
[1:46:53] so you can't see a mother who's actually
[1:46:54] real real real sweet and be like there's
[1:46:55] an elect child coming
[1:46:57] that little angel's there and one mom's
[1:47:00] a little bit irritable
[1:47:04] he's not talking about that that angel
[1:47:07] that beholds the father's face
[1:47:09] he's talking about the angel of the
[1:47:10] earth
[1:47:13] he said when this little angel comes
[1:47:15] into the body that's a little angel of
[1:47:17] the earth
[1:47:18] a spirit that's ordained of god to take
[1:47:20] this body then that baby has to have a
[1:47:23] choice
[1:47:24] it makes its decision talking about
[1:47:27] receiving the word
[1:47:29] you have to come to earth to be tested
[1:47:31] to be tried by the word
[1:47:33] so you receive a a spirit of the earth
[1:47:36] amen just like everybody else has
[1:47:38] and you've got a soul and you've got a
[1:47:40] spirit of the earth and you've got
[1:47:41] a a body that's born in hybridization
[1:47:44] just like everybody else has
[1:47:45] but you have something that nobody else
[1:47:47] has amen you've got a seed down on the
[1:47:49] inside
[1:47:50] a gene of god in the soul
[1:47:53] and a representation in heaven
[1:47:58] now don't ask me how this works
[1:47:59] mechanically because i don't understand
[1:48:01] how it works mechanically
[1:48:03] i can't explain what form how physical
[1:48:05] where is it when it
[1:48:06] i don't i don't understand all i know is
[1:48:08] what brother branham said and what the
[1:48:08] scripture says and i believe it
[1:48:11] just like i believe there's angels
[1:48:12] lining this wall you brother said you
[1:48:14] brought them with you
[1:48:19] in the car
[1:48:24] praise god friends the sixth sense says
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:30] it comes it has to have a choice it
[1:48:32] makes its decision then when this takes
[1:48:34] place
[1:48:35] then you see the angel of the lord now
[1:48:37] comes in here which is a spiritual body
[1:48:39] of the eternal
[1:48:42] what's happening something with that
[1:48:44] angel of the lord that guarding names
[1:48:45] with that
[1:48:46] spirit amen the angel that was beholding
[1:48:48] father's face says something to do with
[1:48:50] your conversion
[1:48:52] that's what the prophet said i don't
[1:48:53] understand it i'm not going to try to
[1:48:55] explain it because i'll mess it up
[1:48:57] but it's nothing but the truth
[1:49:00] the angel of the lord now comes in here
[1:49:02] which is a spiritual body that eternal
[1:49:05] this is a dying spirit and a dying body
[1:49:07] but now you can't be in two bodies at
[1:49:09] one time but there can be two natures in
[1:49:10] you at one time
[1:49:12] now the nature of the spirit of the lord
[1:49:13] when you're born again you're not born
[1:49:15] to physical like the baby was
[1:49:17] but what's happened the spiritual birth
[1:49:19] has come to you
[1:49:21] why because you had an angel of the lord
[1:49:25] watching over you and when you made your
[1:49:27] decision a minute come in here
[1:49:29] i don't know what he's pointing at but
[1:49:31] he come in here
[1:49:33] and you've took the spiritual birth
[1:49:37] and the spiritual birth has come to you
[1:49:38] and while this spiritual birth is
[1:49:40] growing into your heart
[1:49:42] of god there is a physical or celestial
[1:49:44] body growing to receive that spirit
[1:49:46] and when the life leaves this body it
[1:49:48] goes to that body
[1:49:49] just as when the body is presented to
[1:49:51] the earth the spirit comes in
[1:49:52] and when the spirit goes out of the body
[1:49:55] he now he's talking about
[1:49:56] two different spirits
[1:49:59] two different spirits amen because the
[1:50:02] one spirit is the earthly spirit brother
[1:50:04] said it will go when you die and be no
[1:50:05] more
[1:50:07] but he said now listen and when this
[1:50:10] life leaves this body it goes to that
[1:50:12] body he's talking about the celestial
[1:50:14] body
[1:50:15] just as when the body is presented to
[1:50:16] the earth when you're born in the earth
[1:50:18] the spirit comes in and when the spirit
[1:50:20] goes out of the body
[1:50:22] there is a body waiting
[1:50:26] an earthly spirit comes in but then
[1:50:28] there's a conversion and there's another
[1:50:30] spirit there that's working now
[1:50:31] and when you die the earthly spirit goes
[1:50:33] and breaks up amen
[1:50:34] but the other spirit goes to that
[1:50:36] celestial body
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:39] where was it in heaven eternal
[1:50:42] where do i have representation in heaven
[1:50:45] friends it's a link between heaven and
[1:50:47] earth you're not here on your own you're
[1:50:49] not here of your own devices
[1:50:50] you're not here with no help
[1:50:54] it's not just you it's just not just you
[1:50:56] in the flesh
[1:50:57] and there's a there's a sixth sense on
[1:50:59] the inside there's an angel spirit
[1:51:01] beholding the father's face
[1:51:02] there's something that's going to happen
[1:51:04] when that seed begins to quiver and take
[1:51:06] the word
[1:51:06] there's going to be an injection of life
[1:51:08] there's going to be a regeneration of
[1:51:10] the soul
[1:51:11] there's going to be life that comes from
[1:51:12] that seed gene there's going to be a
[1:51:14] spirit life that's in there
[1:51:16] a spiritual birth and when this body
[1:51:19] dies
[1:51:20] that spirit that was born there in the
[1:51:23] soul
[1:51:23] goes to the celestial body
[1:51:29] and that spirit that's in me that goes
[1:51:32] to celestial body
[1:51:34] is beholding the father's face
[1:51:37] listen i'm not even going to try to
[1:51:39] explain that
[1:51:40] but what i'm going to tell you is that
[1:51:42] there's a spiritual birth in me there's
[1:51:44] something that that has come to awaken a
[1:51:46] seed in me
[1:51:47] there's been a regeneration there's been
[1:51:49] a spiritual birth that spirit that's in
[1:51:50] me
[1:51:51] amen when this body dies that spirit
[1:51:53] that life will go
[1:51:54] into that celestial body but that spirit
[1:51:56] that life that's in me
[1:51:58] the son of man which come to earth which
[1:51:59] is in heaven now the spirit of life that
[1:52:01] is in me that will go to my celestial
[1:52:03] body
[1:52:03] is beholding the father's face in the
[1:52:05] throne room of the seventh dimension
[1:52:07] now according to the scriptures
[1:52:11] and the message how does it work don't
[1:52:13] you dare ask me to explain it i'm not
[1:52:15] going to mess up
[1:52:18] what the prophet has brought
[1:52:21] why do you believe you were
[1:52:22] predestinated to believe
[1:52:24] the ingredient was placed inside of you
[1:52:26] why do you have eyes to see and ears to
[1:52:28] hear
[1:52:28] because you've got another set of eyes
[1:52:30] that can see the father's face
[1:52:32] you've got another set of ears that can
[1:52:34] hear the father's voice it's
[1:52:36] more than what you've got in your
[1:52:37] physical makeup there's more to you than
[1:52:39] meets the eye why is it
[1:52:44] when you see that cloud amen you see the
[1:52:46] bridegroom when you see the cloud you
[1:52:48] see your invisible union
[1:52:50] others see the physicals others hear
[1:52:51] what the prophet said others can pass
[1:52:53] the test
[1:52:54] but to you it's more than a cloud it's
[1:52:56] your lover it's your bridegroom it's
[1:52:57] your mate
[1:52:58] it's the invisible union it's him here
[1:53:00] receiving you
[1:53:01] it's the fullness of the word it's the
[1:53:03] headship uniting with you the body
[1:53:05] why because there's an angel who's
[1:53:08] beholding the father's face
[1:53:09] that can hear what's going on in the
[1:53:11] throne room
[1:53:13] and it's connected to you through the
[1:53:15] soul somehow i don't know how but it's
[1:53:18] there
[1:53:21] that's why there's things that you just
[1:53:22] know to be the truth
[1:53:25] prove it i can't prove it but it's the
[1:53:27] truth
[1:53:29] why is it the truth why was that little
[1:53:31] samaritan woman
[1:53:33] who was on her sixth husband coming to
[1:53:35] the well
[1:53:36] living a bad life a dirty life amen
[1:53:39] why was it she was hungering and
[1:53:41] thirsting for god
[1:53:43] why was it she wanted to know the proper
[1:53:45] place of worship why was it when she met
[1:53:47] a man that could tell her about her
[1:53:48] husband's she didn't say can you show me
[1:53:50] where to get a good job and could you
[1:53:51] tell me where i lost my money
[1:53:55] she says sir i perceive that you're a
[1:53:57] prophet
[1:53:59] the elders say worship here and you say
[1:54:01] worship there where can i worship god
[1:54:03] where did that come from that wasn't
[1:54:05] anything in the natural part of that
[1:54:07] woman
[1:54:08] that was something from the sea down on
[1:54:09] the inside and brother branham said she
[1:54:11] could receive his word
[1:54:12] because she had representation in heaven
[1:54:16] because they're there there are angels
[1:54:18] always behold the father's face
[1:54:24] why is it you can believe why is it you
[1:54:26] can see
[1:54:28] because you got more eyes than the ones
[1:54:30] that are in your head
[1:54:31] and you have more ears than the ones
[1:54:32] that are attached to the side of your
[1:54:34] head
[1:54:34] you've got eyes and ears that can access
[1:54:37] the throne room of god
[1:54:41] how does it work i can't tell you how
[1:54:43] all i can tell you is it works
[1:54:46] because the sixth sense in me knows it's
[1:54:48] the truth knows it
[1:54:49] works knows it's real i i've experienced
[1:54:52] it i've seen it i've stood on the word i
[1:54:54] was given something that i didn't have
[1:54:56] in myself
[1:54:56] an understanding i couldn't understand a
[1:54:58] willpower i didn't have
[1:55:00] an overcoming deliverance that wasn't
[1:55:01] coming from the flesh there was
[1:55:03] something coming from the sixth sense
[1:55:05] something more than what was happening
[1:55:06] in this flesh
[1:55:09] and it's a living reality to me
[1:55:12] how do you know it i know it
[1:55:17] prove it just wait
[1:55:21] just wait and he will prove it by
[1:55:25] changing my atoms
[1:55:29] whatever that is whatever part of me
[1:55:32] the perfect triune being and what part's
[1:55:34] here and what part's there and what part
[1:55:36] moves from here to there
[1:55:37] i don't know i can't tell you i can't
[1:55:39] draw a map through the dimensions of
[1:55:41] heaven and put this in the six and this
[1:55:42] and the sev
[1:55:43] and me here all i know is one day all of
[1:55:46] it's going to align into one vessel in
[1:55:48] this body that's changed
[1:55:50] and i'm going to be the perfect triumph
[1:55:52] beating all that i was supposed to be
[1:55:53] all that he intended for to me i will be
[1:55:56] you want me to prove it
[1:55:57] just wait
[1:56:00] if you don't have eyes to see your ears
[1:56:01] to hear you'll see me sitting with him
[1:56:03] on the throne at the day of judgment
[1:56:05] and you'll stand before the reality
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:09] that'll be proven
[1:56:14] amen
[1:56:18] but i'm saying who is this melchizedek
[1:56:21] then after you recognize the very word
[1:56:23] of god was eagle food
[1:56:24] then you left the other thing you have
[1:56:26] you have then been formed into the
[1:56:28] living image
[1:56:29] of the living god you heard from your
[1:56:32] theophany amen
[1:56:35] this earthly body be dissolved we have
[1:56:37] one waiting
[1:56:39] eternal in the heavens heavenly
[1:56:42] representation
[1:56:46] see friends that representation over
[1:56:49] there
[1:56:50] according to what the prophet says has
[1:56:53] influence over you here
[1:56:56] i'll read it again so you can understand
[1:56:58] after you recognize the very word of god
[1:57:00] was eagle food why
[1:57:04] ears to hear then you left the other
[1:57:06] thing you have been
[1:57:08] formed into the living image of the
[1:57:10] living god
[1:57:11] you heard from your theophany
[1:57:16] i didn't hear anything no i heard
[1:57:18] something
[1:57:21] that means whatever that is there has
[1:57:24] influence on you here and if we could
[1:57:28] learn
[1:57:28] to deny what we see what we
[1:57:31] think how we feel if we could learn not
[1:57:34] to be tossed about by emotions and
[1:57:36] reasoning
[1:57:37] and fears and complexes and what we see
[1:57:40] and what the news is telling us in our
[1:57:42] ears and what we see happening on
[1:57:43] if we could learn to not live to those
[1:57:45] things and deny all of those things
[1:57:47] but hear from our representation in
[1:57:49] heaven and begin to be able to respond
[1:57:51] amen
[1:57:52] to the life on the inside i wonder what
[1:57:54] kind of life we'd live
[1:57:56] friends if we could cast down reasoning
[1:57:59] in every high thing that exalted itself
[1:58:01] against the knowledge of christ
[1:58:03] and bringing the captivity every thought
[1:58:05] to the obedience of christ
[1:58:07] who is the word how are you going to do
[1:58:09] that you've got to be awakened to the
[1:58:11] living realities of a living god
[1:58:13] of angels and seraphims and cherubims
[1:58:15] and angels lining these walls
[1:58:17] and it's all here and it's all reality
[1:58:19] and it means more than the physical
[1:58:20] things that we touch
[1:58:24] and if that realm and if you have a link
[1:58:26] amen
[1:58:27] from this realm to that realm if there's
[1:58:29] a physical being in this realm
[1:58:31] that's got a data cable
[1:58:35] a data cable that links to another realm
[1:58:38] it can plug into the seventh dimension
[1:58:44] don't plug it up don't ruin your
[1:58:47] bandwidth
[1:58:48] with doubts and reasonings and intellect
[1:58:50] amen leave the channel open amen and
[1:58:53] don't plug it up with your reasoning
[1:58:54] don't plug it up with your fear
[1:58:56] don't plug it up with what you see in
[1:58:57] the news leave it open to the word
[1:59:00] and let whatever is attached to both
[1:59:02] ends of this reality
[1:59:03] bring the revelation down
[1:59:06] truth upon truth upon truth upon truth
[1:59:10] because that's the only way we'll
[1:59:11] receive it not from the brain
[1:59:14] amen there's got to be representation in
[1:59:16] heaven
[1:59:18] we've united to that representation
[1:59:22] how i don't know how
[1:59:25] give me some time i'll explain it all to
[1:59:28] you later
[1:59:32] but it's the truth friends we've made a
[1:59:36] connection something was disconnected
[1:59:39] when we come to this life
[1:59:41] the thing that was disconnected from us
[1:59:43] was always there
[1:59:45] you had a port here and a port here
[1:59:50] these things were predestinated to come
[1:59:52] together
[1:59:54] i'm sorry for all you i.t guys i'm
[1:59:57] ruining
[1:59:58] all this i'm probably using wrong terms
[1:59:59] and everything
[2:00:02] but you had a seed in the soul
[2:00:05] and you had a connection through an
[2:00:06] invisible
[2:00:09] some part of you in another dimension
[2:00:11] something that represents you
[2:00:13] somewhere else and it was all around
[2:00:17] but one day you had to make your
[2:00:19] decision you come in contact with the
[2:00:21] light
[2:00:22] the light moved away all the shroud of
[2:00:24] darkness is all around you
[2:00:25] and all of a sudden click
[2:00:30] you recognize that the very word was
[2:00:32] eagle's food
[2:00:34] you left the others and you downloaded
[2:00:36] from your theophany the revelation
[2:00:38] of god amen praise be to god
[2:00:41] and friends if you can get that download
[2:00:43] what else can he download
[2:00:45] if you can receive that transmission
[2:00:47] from a heavenly realm
[2:00:48] what else can you receive from a
[2:00:50] heavenly realm
[2:00:53] i don't think that i just asked a
[2:00:55] question i don't want anyone to inject
[2:00:56] my own thinking
[2:00:57] i just want to ask you the question do
[2:01:00] you think that was the only time you
[2:01:01] ever heard from your theophany
[2:01:04] or do you think that's the only time you
[2:01:05] could ever possibly hear from your
[2:01:06] theophany
[2:01:08] and if you could hear from your
[2:01:09] theophany once to bring one revelation
[2:01:11] to the message
[2:01:12] could you hear from your theophany again
[2:01:14] to bring another revelation to the
[2:01:16] message
[2:01:16] i'm just asking i'm not telling you i'm
[2:01:18] just asking
[2:01:21] but what does the sixth sense tell you
[2:01:24] is it possible is it going on
[2:01:28] is it happening now
[2:01:32] praise god in the masterpiece
[2:01:36] 1964 brother bram says we realize that
[2:01:39] we're in a negative form
[2:01:42] and as long as there's a negative there
[2:01:44] has to be a positive
[2:01:46] there cannot be a negative without a
[2:01:48] positive c because it's because of the
[2:01:50] positive that makes the negative
[2:01:51] like you had a negative picture of some
[2:01:53] object there has to be an
[2:01:54] object somewhere or to strike the light
[2:01:56] to strike the lens or there wouldn't be
[2:01:58] any negative
[2:02:00] praise god so when we see that our life
[2:02:03] here
[2:02:04] is in the negative and knowing that
[2:02:05] we're in the image of some life
[2:02:07] somewhere
[2:02:07] then we know that there is a positive
[2:02:10] somewhere that light has struck
[2:02:11] and it's reflecting something here on
[2:02:13] earth and we
[2:02:14] are only that reflection the genuine
[2:02:18] object is somewhere
[2:02:22] do you hear do you hear do you hear or
[2:02:25] do you hear
[2:02:28] where are you hearing because i'm
[2:02:30] hearing a whole lot more than what i'm
[2:02:31] hearing
[2:02:35] the genuine object is somewhere if that
[2:02:38] isn't
[2:02:39] i'm the worst deceived man in the world
[2:02:42] i've spent my life in vain but i know
[2:02:45] beyond a
[2:02:46] shadow of a doubt that it's there that's
[2:02:48] why we're
[2:02:49] here i'm here believing the word
[2:02:53] i'm here connected to the supernatural
[2:02:55] because the real reality the positive is
[2:02:58] somewhere else
[2:02:59] and i'm only reflecting this here is
[2:03:01] only reflecting that and if i'm here
[2:03:03] believing the word
[2:03:04] if i'm here living the word then there's
[2:03:06] something else somewhere
[2:03:08] that's the positive that i'm only
[2:03:10] representing
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:13] and i'm going to be lost and it's going
[2:03:16] to fail
[2:03:17] and it won't work
[2:03:20] he come to seek and save that which was
[2:03:23] lost
[2:03:25] and through a supernatural rebirth he's
[2:03:28] connected to cable again
[2:03:31] i say let's disconnect the other one
[2:03:38] forget what the news is saying forget
[2:03:41] politics
[2:03:43] we'd like to forget politics
[2:03:48] and let's get all of our information
[2:03:52] from another news source let's get all
[2:03:55] of our reality not from a textbook
[2:03:58] not from google not from the news but
[2:04:01] let's get all of our reality
[2:04:03] let's tap into our ears
[2:04:06] and to our eyes and to our understanding
[2:04:10] and let the spirit of god teach us
[2:04:14] let the spirit of god guide us let the
[2:04:16] spirit of god
[2:04:17] lead us i'd like to close by reading
[2:04:20] first corinthians if we could read this
[2:04:21] together
[2:04:22] musicians if you could come brother ben
[2:04:24] if you can make it up
[2:04:26] first corinthians chapter two
[2:04:37] first corinthians chapter 2
[2:04:40] and verse 9.
[2:04:44] but as it is written eye hath not seen
[2:04:47] nor ear heard neither has entered into
[2:04:49] the heart of man
[2:04:50] the things which god hath prepared for
[2:04:52] them that love him
[2:04:54] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[2:04:56] the spirit
[2:04:58] now let's just read the first verse
[2:05:00] again nine
[2:05:02] but as it is written i had not seen nor
[2:05:04] ear heard neither entered into the heart
[2:05:05] of men the things which god has prepared
[2:05:07] for them that love him
[2:05:08] okay stop i can't know it
[2:05:12] i'll have to wait never enter and die
[2:05:14] never
[2:05:15] enter the heart the things that god
[2:05:17] prepared for man okay
[2:05:20] that's not what paul's saying paul's
[2:05:22] saying you can know it
[2:05:24] you can hear it you can see it
[2:05:27] but god hath revealed them to us by his
[2:05:30] spirits
[2:05:32] for the spirit searches all things yea
[2:05:34] the deep things of god
[2:05:35] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[2:05:37] save the spirit of a man which is in him
[2:05:39] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[2:05:42] but the spirit of god
[2:05:44] now we have received not the spirit of
[2:05:46] the world but the spirit
[2:05:48] which is of god that we might know the
[2:05:50] things which are freely given to us of
[2:05:52] god
[2:05:54] what i thought you couldn't hear it and
[2:05:56] you couldn't see it didn't enter your
[2:05:57] heart no it's freely
[2:05:59] given to you to know
[2:06:02] which things also we speak not in the
[2:06:04] worlds in words which man's wisdom
[2:06:06] teacheth but which the holy ghost
[2:06:08] teacheth
[2:06:08] comparing spiritual things with
[2:06:10] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[2:06:12] not the things of the spirit of god for
[2:06:14] they are foolishness unto him
[2:06:16] neither can he know them because they
[2:06:17] are spiritually discerned
[2:06:20] but he that is spiritual judges all
[2:06:22] things that he himself
[2:06:23] judge is judged of no man for who hath
[2:06:26] known the mind of the lord
[2:06:28] that he may instruct him but we have
[2:06:31] the mind of christ
[2:06:35] let's all stand praise
[2:06:40] god amen i'm going to read to you out of
[2:06:43] revelations 22 17.
[2:06:47] revelations 22 17.
[2:06:54] and the spirit and the bride say come
[2:06:59] and let him that heareth

[2:07:23] say come r who are we calling to
[2:07:29] those with ears to hear
[2:07:32] not natural ears but ears

[2:07:39] let's keep calling friends we're still
[2:07:42] here
[2:07:43] there's got to be somebody else with
[2:07:44] ears there's got to be
[2:07:46] there may not be but there's got to be
[2:07:48] somebody else
[2:07:50] with representation in heaven just like
[2:07:52] the little woman at the well
[2:07:54] and you can jesus preached the
[2:07:56] multitudes and they rejected him
[2:07:58] and he preaches to one little woman
[2:07:59] trapped in adultery and she believes
[2:08:02] we may we may share the message with
[2:08:04] thousands of people who reject us
[2:08:06] but there may be one little person who
[2:08:08] will still receive
[2:08:11] god is good friends we have ears to hear
[2:08:15] eyes to see and a heart to perceive
[2:08:19] and has nothing to do with this body
[2:08:22] god has all done it for us

[2:08:29] over

[2:08:50] mystery for this
[2:08:51] hour you have saved the revelation

[2:08:55] only giving it part showing it types and
[2:08:58] giving it
[2:08:58] shadows but you've held it back for this
[2:09:00] very hour and now

[2:09:30] come alive and begin to operate and give
[2:09:33] us the true leadership that we need
[2:09:35] by the leadership of the holy ghost it's
[2:09:38] quickened to life that sixth sense

[2:09:46] continue to pour your revelation in our
[2:09:48] heart
[2:09:49] and may we walk by revelation not by

[2:09:57] the revealed word
