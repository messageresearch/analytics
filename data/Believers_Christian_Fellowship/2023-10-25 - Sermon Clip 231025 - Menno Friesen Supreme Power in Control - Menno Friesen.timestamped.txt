[0:00] you know when you have Fellowship
[0:01] sometimes you read certain things said
[0:02] oh said you know like that little boy
[0:04] said Mama that's me that's how I feel so
[0:06] many times when I'm reading said oh
[0:07] that's me he talking about yes sir I
[0:10] identify myself right there in the word
[0:12] this message is me that's right we've
[0:15] had all kinds of confusions all kinds of
[0:17] people rising up and and challenging the
[0:20] message I tell you what I've challenged
[0:22] myself too I believe the message I'm
[0:25] challenging myself every day Lord not
[0:27] just believe in it but it manifests
[0:30] itself in my
[0:31] life the walking word The Living Word
[0:34] the reality of God in every manner the
[0:37] worshiper once Pur has no more desire of
[0:40] sin that's where I look at myself now I
[0:43] look one thing well I might get a lot of
[0:44] mistakes but I have no desire for
[0:46] unbelief and sin in my
[0:48] life no
[0:52] sir no more conscious in the Old
[0:54] Testament of course the worshiper
[0:55] offered and he goes back a little bit
[0:57] let me take a little time with that and
[0:58] he he went back and but what the Old
[1:01] Testament we know what happened under
[1:02] the blood of bulls and
[1:04] gos they were sorry for their sins they
[1:07] knew they're Sinners went and made the
[1:08] thing right offered came back with the
[1:10] same
[1:12] desire but it's not so with the blood of
[1:14] Jesus Christ once baptized into that
[1:18] Kingdom once filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:20] you walk away your desire for sin is
[1:22] gone you don't want to disbelieve the
[1:23] word of God the only sin that really is
[1:25] unbelief in the word drinking smoking
[1:28] gambling the prophet said adultery so
[1:30] that's not sin that's attributes of
[1:31] unbelief so if you if you're born of the
[1:34] spirit of God I don't mean to hurt
[1:35] anybody but if you're born of the spirit
[1:36] of God those things are dead in your
[1:38] life so well I'm still tempted yes as
[1:41] long as you're in this body you will
[1:43] be that doesn't mean you're not a
[1:45] Christian being tempted right that just
[1:47] means you're a part of the
[1:49] Overcomer we're talking about Overcomers
[1:52] here people that's overcome all the
[1:54] Creeds and the dogmas that tries to
[1:56] attach itself to the word that's right
[1:59] there's a lot lot of denominational
[2:01] Spirits trying to attach thems to this
[2:03] word and use the power of God to verify
[2:07] their Vindication that's listen we're
[2:09] not interested in that we're interested
[2:10] in one thing Lord you said it and I
[2:12] believe it whether even I understand it
[2:14] or
[2:16] not how many could have how which one of
[2:18] us could say I understand God it's
[2:21] impossible as long as we're in this
[2:23] finite body how can the finite identify
[2:27] it with the
[2:28] infinite you know he's it's so beyond us
[2:32] but something drops way down said but by
[2:35] faith Noah by faith Abraham by Faith by
[2:38] Revelation every one the Church of Jesus
[2:40] Christ is built all the way through she
[2:42] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
