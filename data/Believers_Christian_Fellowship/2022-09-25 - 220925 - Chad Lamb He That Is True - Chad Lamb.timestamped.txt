[13:19] amen let's all stand
[13:21] let's go to the word
[13:24] also like to say that at the end of
[13:26] preaching at the end of the service this
[13:28] morning we're going to have our two new
[13:30] deacons come forward so that we can
[13:32] ordain them as a body of Believers as a
[13:35] church and lay hands on them and pray
[13:37] for them that God will bless them in
[13:39] this office that they now hold so we
[13:41] want to do that at the end of service
[13:43] A man also want to welcome a few
[13:44] visitors amen sister Isabella God bless
[13:47] you it's so good to have you here and
[13:49] she'll be able to join us for the
[13:50] retreat so that is very exciting so I'm
[13:53] glad to have her also I'm glad to have
[13:55] my mom amen you all know her sister
[13:57] Debbie but to me she's mom and traveling
[14:00] with her was my sister-in-law Kristen
[14:02] God bless you and her daughter our niece
[14:04] Kinley it's good to have you God bless
[14:06] you you know there's a little seven
[14:09] pound something attraction
[14:11] in Lima Ohio that are pulling people
[14:14] from the ends of the Earth amen
[14:16] Angie's parents were just here and they
[14:19] would spent three or four days with us
[14:20] and went back yesterday morning and so
[14:24] we feel loved
[14:25] but Henry should feel more loved
[14:28] amen God bless you while we're standing
[14:30] let's take our Bibles and turn to
[14:32] Revelation chapter 19 and we'll get into
[14:35] the word
[14:47] all right Revelation chapter 19
[14:53] and we'll start with verse 11.
[14:57] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[14:59] horse and he that sat upon him was
[15:02] called faithful and true and in
[15:05] righteousness he does judge and make war
[15:07] so I'm going to key in on that title
[15:09] true he's faithful and true
[15:12] go back to Revelation chapter 3. if you
[15:15] would
[15:16] read one more scripture while we're
[15:18] standing
[15:21] Revelation chapter 3
[15:25] and verse 7.
[15:29] excuse me
[15:32] chapter 3 verse 7 and to the angel of
[15:34] the church in Philadelphia right these
[15:37] things saith he that is Holy he that is
[15:39] true he that hath the Key of David he
[15:42] that openeth and no man shuteth and
[15:45] shutteth and no man openeth and again
[15:47] not like the key in on the phrase he
[15:49] that is true let's bow our heads and
[15:52] praying
[15:54] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[15:56] Jesus for this privilege of being here
[15:59] and God our hearts are worn by your
[16:01] goodness to us so far in the service by
[16:03] the atmosphere that we enjoy as we come
[16:05] together for the saints that we can
[16:07] fellowship with for the songs that we
[16:10] can sing together to lift your name
[16:13] Lord seeing these two babies that you've
[16:15] given to two families to be dedicated to
[16:18] you Lord and the parents consecrating
[16:21] themselves to your service to raise
[16:23] these babies For Your Glory the visitors
[16:25] that are here Lord the The Retreat
[16:28] that's coming up Lord there's so much to
[16:30] be thankful for our hearts are so full
[16:33] and happy and rejoicing in you and now
[16:36] God as we turn our hearts to your word
[16:38] it is the thing that makes us happy Lord
[16:41] it is the your word is what gives us
[16:43] life your word is what makes all these
[16:45] things possible and Lord I pray God that
[16:48] you would feed us from your hand break
[16:50] the bread of life to us and feed us on
[16:52] this word Lord that we might gain
[16:53] strength for this journey that we're in
[16:55] take preeminence among us and take
[16:58] absolute control as we yield ourselves
[17:00] to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[17:03] amen God bless you as you're seated
[17:09] meant for a title this morning I'd like
[17:11] to take from this scripture uh he that
[17:15] is true he that is true and we know who
[17:19] this is referring to both references are
[17:21] to Jesus Christ
[17:24] he is called faithful and true
[17:27] these things saith he that is Holy he
[17:30] that is true amen this word true when
[17:34] you look it up in the Greek as an
[17:37] interesting meeting the prophet of God
[17:39] refers to this and we'll get to that in
[17:40] a minute but if you just pulled it out
[17:42] of Strong's Concordance and look at this
[17:44] word that that's true it means that
[17:47] which has not only the name and
[17:49] resemblance but the real nature
[17:51] corresponding to the name
[17:54] So it's talking about something that's
[17:55] true but it's not true as in true versus
[17:58] false it is true in the aspect of
[18:01] genuine or completely real amen or the
[18:05] full measure it says that which is not
[18:08] only the name and resemblance but the
[18:11] real nature corresponding to the name so
[18:14] something can have a name and a
[18:16] resemblance of something you can have a
[18:18] picture of me and if somebody says who
[18:20] is that you can say that's Chad amen but
[18:23] that's not the true Chad that's a true
[18:25] resemblance of Chad
[18:27] so you look at the picture and say
[18:28] that's Chad but when when I come on the
[18:31] scene now I am that which is true
[18:34] all right that doesn't make the picture
[18:36] false so it's not a true versus false
[18:39] this is not this kind of true but this
[18:41] true is not just that which carries the
[18:44] name and resemblance but the true nature
[18:46] that corresponds to that name
[18:48] so but the real nature corresponding to
[18:50] the name in every respect corresponding
[18:53] to the idea signified by the name real
[18:57] true genuine so now we understand what
[19:00] this word means
[19:01] and also in another description it says
[19:03] it contrasts realities where they're
[19:06] semblances
[19:08] so the true is the reality whereas the
[19:11] semblance is not the the reality but it
[19:14] is also true
[19:15] so just when we get back to like the
[19:17] picture you take a picture of me you
[19:19] have a picture sitting up here and say
[19:21] that's Chad that is true but it's not
[19:24] completely true
[19:26] but when I come on the scene you say
[19:28] that's chat that's completely true it
[19:31] didn't make the picture false but the
[19:33] picture wasn't completely true
[19:36] it wasn't the full measure now that we
[19:37] understand so now we know that Jesus
[19:40] Christ is this kind of true not true
[19:43] versus false but true in the full
[19:45] reality of the thing the full the full
[19:48] genuineness the full characteristic the
[19:50] full reality of what we're talking about
[19:53] so I'd like to read an excerpt out of
[19:55] the Philadelphian Church age from the
[19:57] church age book
[19:58] and then here the prophet of God begins
[20:00] to say these things saith he that is
[20:03] true now this word true is a very
[20:05] wonderful word it does not mean true in
[20:07] just the sense that it is opposite to
[20:10] false it expresses the perfect
[20:12] realization of an idea as contrasted
[20:15] with its partial realization
[20:18] I was turned together to John the Gospel
[20:20] of John chapter 6. and keep your Bibles
[20:23] handy I want to read quite a few
[20:24] scriptures I may not read them all I
[20:26] might just reference them for time so
[20:28] that we can keep moving but I want to go
[20:29] through uh quite a number of scriptures
[20:31] uh this morning
[20:34] uh John chapter 6.
[20:43] John chapter 6 and verse 30.
[20:49] John 6 and 30. they said therefore unto
[20:52] him what sign show us thou then that we
[20:54] may see and believe thee what do us thou
[20:57] what thus thou work our fathers did eat
[21:00] Manna in the desert as it is written he
[21:03] gave them bread from Heaven to eat then
[21:05] Jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[21:08] unto you Moses gave you not the bread
[21:09] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[21:12] true bread from heaven
[21:13] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[21:16] down from heaven and giveth life into
[21:18] the world
[21:19] then sit there unto him Lord
[21:22] Evermore give us this bread and Jesus
[21:25] said unto them I am the bread of life he
[21:28] that cometh to me shall never hunger he
[21:31] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[21:34] but I say unto you that that ye also
[21:37] have seen me and believe not all that
[21:40] the father giveth me shall come to me
[21:41] and him that cometh to me I will in no
[21:44] wise cast out so here Jesus is saying
[21:47] Moses didn't give you the true Bread of
[21:50] Heaven the true Bread of Heaven is he
[21:51] that comes down from the father and they
[21:53] said well let us have this bread they
[21:56] wanted bread to eat and Jesus says I am
[21:59] the bread
[22:00] I am the bread of life amen so now he's
[22:04] contrasting himself with the bread that
[22:06] Moses gave they're asking him for a sign
[22:09] amen because he broke the Loaves and the
[22:11] fishes and he fed the multitudes now
[22:13] they want another sign they want another
[22:15] bread and he's telling them then they're
[22:17] saying now give us a sign Moses gave us
[22:20] bread and he says but I am the true
[22:23] bread
[22:24] you want bread but I'm the true bread
[22:26] and that's why Jesus in the Passover
[22:28] broke the bread and he told him Take and
[22:31] Eat This is my body which is given for
[22:33] you because he was the true bread he was
[22:36] the bread that came down from God out of
[22:38] heaven now that did not make Moses's
[22:41] bread a lie
[22:43] it did not make Moses's bread false that
[22:46] was Manna and the Manna was given from
[22:48] God and the Manna Came From Heaven
[22:51] is that right
[22:52] and the Manna was the type of Christ
[22:54] amen coming down it was a foreshadow of
[22:58] the Son of God coming Amen to to be the
[23:00] bread of life but but now because Jesus
[23:04] Christ comes on the scene and says I am
[23:06] the true bread he's not saying Moses
[23:09] gave you the false bread because it
[23:11] wasn't false it wasn't a lie it was true
[23:14] they ate it it gave him strength it had
[23:16] the nourishment that they needed for the
[23:18] journey it was real bread that God gave
[23:20] to them and they really ate it
[23:23] it wasn't false bread it wasn't Wicked
[23:25] bread it wasn't the devil's bread
[23:28] it was true genuine bread from God but
[23:32] it was it was a foreshadow or a
[23:34] semblance of one to come and now the
[23:37] bread amen that this was foreshadowing
[23:39] was standing in front of them and he
[23:42] said I am the bread of life amen and
[23:44] anybody who comes and eats from me shall
[23:47] have eternal life amen all that the
[23:49] father of giving shall come to me and he
[23:51] that come to me I will no wise Cast Away
[23:53] you can go to him now and eat the bread
[23:56] not for an Earthly Journey but to give
[23:58] you strength for a journey from Earth
[24:00] and to the supernatural realms
[24:03] so now they're standing here and there's
[24:06] a contrast now this is the true bread
[24:09] and the word true is the same true that
[24:12] we're talking about in Revelation true
[24:14] not in the not in the uh differentiating
[24:18] from false but true now he is the the
[24:21] genuine bread the reality of bread amen
[24:25] the picture that God was fainting back
[24:27] there was him and now he's here it's not
[24:30] the picture of bread it's the bread
[24:31] itself
[24:33] it's the real
[24:37] and you know what they wanted to go back
[24:39] to the semblance
[24:43] he says the true bread I am the true
[24:46] bread
[24:48] but they didn't want to eat of that
[24:49] bread they wanted another Supernatural
[24:52] bread that God came down to sustain them
[24:54] and announce they want a natural natural
[24:56] and here he is giving something so much
[24:59] greater than the natural and they didn't
[25:01] want it they wanted the semblance they
[25:03] didn't want the true
[25:05] and it shows that he is the true
[25:08] he's the true of everything
[25:12] if you want to know what true is it's
[25:14] Jesus Christ
[25:15] he's the true of everything
[25:19] in figure me in church age it goes on to
[25:21] say since this word indeed expresses
[25:23] perfect realization as against the idea
[25:26] of partial realization as Illustrated in
[25:28] these verses we can Now understand as
[25:31] never before anti-type contrasted with
[25:33] type and the substance was Shadow take
[25:36] the example now of Manna From Heaven God
[25:38] sent down Angel bread from heaven for
[25:39] Israel but that bread did not satisfy it
[25:43] was only good for a day those who ate it
[25:45] were hungry again the next day if it was
[25:48] left around it became contaminated but
[25:51] Jesus is the true bread from Heaven
[25:53] wherever Manna was just a type and if
[25:56] any man eats of that bread that came
[25:59] from Heaven he will never hunger again
[26:01] he does not need to come back and eat
[26:04] again the moment he partook he had
[26:06] eternal life here indeed was reality no
[26:10] need any longer for a shadow no need for
[26:13] a partial salvation here is the whole of
[26:15] it just like Jesus isn't part of God he
[26:19] is God
[26:20] Jesus isn't the partial he's not part
[26:22] he's not the second person or the or the
[26:25] a second whatever he is God he is the
[26:28] reality he is the true
[26:31] so now no longer would they need the
[26:35] partial because the full reality has
[26:37] come but it's not discarding the partial
[26:40] as wrong as false as bad it was good
[26:44] but now the fool the true the genuine
[26:48] has come
[26:50] and now Jesus was not in any way trying
[26:54] to make what happened in the wilderness
[26:57] he wasn't belittling it and he wasn't
[26:59] disqualifying it and he wasn't casting
[27:01] any doubt upon it that was real that was
[27:04] genuine that was God
[27:07] but it was pointing
[27:09] to his day
[27:11] and now to have the bread that came down
[27:14] from heaven would not be something that
[27:17] you pick up and put in your mouth
[27:18] physically but it would be something
[27:20] that you receive and take in spiritually
[27:22] and that would be the revelation of
[27:24] Jesus Christ as the son of God
[27:26] and now to partake of that bread you
[27:29] would never hunger again but because
[27:31] it's not a natural bread Jesus in no way
[27:34] means that you'll never have a hunger
[27:37] pain in your physical body again
[27:40] he's offering the real bread for the
[27:42] real life he's not offering temporal bed
[27:45] for the temporal life now we're coming
[27:47] to reality amen and you can partake of
[27:50] Jesus Christ and never hunger for life
[27:52] again because you'll receive life in him
[27:55] and if you receive him you receive life
[27:57] and you'll never hunger for eternal life
[28:00] again because you've received it by
[28:01] coming and partaking of Jesus Christ but
[28:04] you will get a hunger pain in your
[28:06] physical body again
[28:07] you will probably have one after church
[28:10] if you're a teenage boy you'll have one
[28:12] in church
[28:14] no matter how much breakfast you had
[28:17] but we're not looking to that we're
[28:19] looking to the true
[28:22] let's turn to John chapter one
[28:35] John chapter one
[28:37] verse one in the beginning was the word
[28:40] and the Word was with God and the Word
[28:42] was God the same was in the beginning
[28:45] with God all things were made by him and
[28:48] without him was not anything made that
[28:50] was made in him was life and the life
[28:53] was the light of men and the light
[28:55] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[28:57] comprehended it not there was a man sent
[29:00] from God whose name was John the same
[29:02] came for a witness
[29:03] so John is a witness to Bear witness of
[29:07] the light that all men through him might
[29:09] believe he was not that light but we
[29:12] know John was a light Jesus told us but
[29:14] he was not that light he was not the
[29:16] True Light
[29:18] he was not that light but he was sent to
[29:20] Bear witness of that light that was the
[29:24] True Light which lighteth every man that
[29:26] cometh into the world
[29:28] this word true is the same true we're
[29:30] looking at he's the fullness of light he
[29:34] is the true light and now when when you
[29:37] look at the True Light you say in the
[29:39] beginning God created light he said let
[29:42] there be light and there was light that
[29:45] was true light
[29:47] that was a light that Lit the world and
[29:49] then he began to ordain the sun to Bear
[29:52] light by day and the moon and the stars
[29:54] to Bear light by night and that was true
[29:56] light and that was the work of God and
[29:58] God was doing and establishing the order
[30:01] of Nature and the Order of the earth
[30:02] that was true light amen we know that
[30:05] John Jesus says John was a light and you
[30:08] were happy to to dwell in his light for
[30:11] a time for a period of time so he was a
[30:13] light but now what's coming is the True
[30:16] Light amen every other light was
[30:18] pointing to This Light amen so now the
[30:21] sunlight that's been shining every day
[30:24] day in and out since God recreated the
[30:27] Earth amen that sun that's lighting is
[30:29] not the True Light
[30:32] that's right you walk out in the day
[30:34] amen and you see the light that's not
[30:36] the True Light amen Jesus Christ is the
[30:39] True Light amen
[30:41] amen so he he becomes the fullness or
[30:44] the full embodiment of lot light stood
[30:47] for what life when Jesus says Let There
[30:49] be lying amen Jesus Christ is that light
[30:52] amen the sun was showing for generations
[30:55] and generations amen what light is so
[30:58] that we would understand in the natural
[31:00] what light is what bread is what water
[31:02] is so that we would get some
[31:04] understanding but these things are only
[31:06] types of the reality they're only four
[31:08] shot they're only Shadows of the real so
[31:11] now that light that we enjoy every day
[31:13] when you go outside life is dependent on
[31:16] sunlight amen light comes to give life
[31:19] upon the Earth amen and we we know these
[31:21] things in the natural realm but they're
[31:23] only showing us that there is a true
[31:26] light that doesn't make this a false
[31:28] light but it makes this Jesus Christ The
[31:31] True Light
[31:33] none of us would go and say the sun is a
[31:35] false light you still need it for your
[31:37] Earthly existence
[31:39] we still need it for life upon the Earth
[31:41] and it will remain that way because it
[31:44] stands as a type showing us that there
[31:47] is a real light in that real light
[31:49] brings life
[31:52] because you need light for life and the
[31:55] Bible says he was life and that life was
[31:57] the light of men he was the True Light
[32:03] let's go to John chapter 8.
[32:12] John chapter 8 verse 12.
[32:18] then spake Jesus again into them saying
[32:21] I am the light of the world
[32:25] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[32:27] darkness but shall have the light of
[32:30] life
[32:31] just as light is required for life on
[32:34] Earth Light is required for eternal life
[32:37] for your spiritual life and Jesus is
[32:41] that light he is the true light or the
[32:44] Fulfillment of light or the genuine
[32:47] light
[32:49] back in purging me in church age it says
[32:51] no one could deny that Israel had light
[32:54] they were the only people who had light
[32:56] as a nation it was as when it was as
[32:59] when Egypt was so dark that one could
[33:02] feel it but in the homes of the
[33:03] Israelites there was light this is back
[33:05] when they were in Goshen
[33:07] but now True light has come the light of
[33:09] the world is Jesus Moses and the
[33:11] prophets brought the light by means of
[33:13] the scripture related to the relative to
[33:16] the Messiah thus Israel had light but
[33:19] now the Fulfillment of light has come
[33:21] and what was but glowing word has now
[33:24] broken forth in the brightness of God
[33:25] manifest among his people as the pillar
[33:28] of fire gave light at night and that was
[33:30] wonderful now light and life are
[33:33] manifested in the fullness of the
[33:34] godhead bodily
[33:37] praise be to God he Israel had light no
[33:42] one can say they didn't had light they
[33:43] had the Revelation for their day
[33:46] and the Revelation for your day is light
[33:48] because light also is illumination amen
[33:50] when we're in darkness we can't see
[33:52] where we're going we don't know what's
[33:54] going on around us we have no knowledge
[33:56] or understanding of what's going on when
[33:59] we're in darkness if we're in a dark
[34:01] room we don't know what's happening in
[34:03] the room amen but when somebody turns on
[34:05] the light instantly there's an
[34:06] illumination and we have an instant
[34:08] Revelation and understand where we're at
[34:10] where we're at in reference to other
[34:12] things in the room what's in the room
[34:14] what it's like and we know so much the
[34:17] instant light comes on
[34:19] all right this is the contrast between
[34:21] light and darkness so light is an
[34:24] illumination that brings understanding
[34:26] our Revelation an awareness and knowing
[34:29] Amen in every age God was dispensing
[34:32] light Amen to the Israelites coming out
[34:34] of Egypt he was dispensing light and he
[34:36] was using Moses Moses was a type of the
[34:38] Messiah he was a prophet amen showing
[34:41] forth the true prophet he was a type of
[34:43] Messiah showing forth the true Messiah
[34:45] amen and they were in The Exodus Journey
[34:47] receiving a portion of light for that
[34:49] day and that light would give them
[34:51] illumination and they would see more
[34:53] clearly who they are now they know that
[34:56] they're the chosen people of God Amen
[34:58] they would see what their purpose is
[34:59] they know where they're supposed to go
[35:00] and what word they're supposed to
[35:02] fulfill and they know so much more than
[35:05] they knew before
[35:07] and in every Church age God has been
[35:10] dispensing light through his Messengers
[35:12] and he's been and he's been dispensing
[35:14] it through the apostles and through the
[35:15] the disciples and The Messengers he's
[35:17] been dispensing light and all of that
[35:19] light was bringing a greater
[35:21] illumination a greater understanding a
[35:23] greater awareness of what was going on
[35:26] and the purpose and the plan of God and
[35:28] who we are and what we're supposed to be
[35:30] doing and where we are in reference to
[35:32] the things of God all of that is light
[35:35] and and there's no way to Discount any
[35:38] of that line it was all real light
[35:42] it was all true
[35:44] but Jesus Christ is the True Light
[35:48] he is the perfect the real the genuine
[35:50] whatever God meant when he said light
[35:53] Jesus Christ is the manifestation of
[35:55] that
[35:57] right so we could impartial light there
[36:01] can still be confusion and
[36:02] misunderstanding
[36:05] there can still be uh uh all kinds and
[36:08] partial light are still a lack of
[36:10] understanding amen we saw it in the
[36:13] restoration of the Bride true coming out
[36:15] of the Dark Ages and the restoration of
[36:17] the church as the bride was growing in
[36:19] Revelation through the Reformation
[36:20] Martin Luther brought back the the the
[36:23] the the understanding of justification
[36:25] by faith in Christ alone and Wesley was
[36:28] bringing back the understanding of
[36:29] living a holy life Sanctified by the
[36:32] spirit and blood of God and then the
[36:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost was renewing
[36:35] uh the gifts of the Spirit and the life
[36:38] back into the church at the at the
[36:40] Pentecostal Revival all of that was
[36:42] greater light greater light Greater Life
[36:44] and it was all True Light it was all
[36:46] real light there was no reason to
[36:48] Discount the light but because it was
[36:50] partial light there was things that were
[36:52] left in darkness there was things that
[36:54] were left misunderstood
[36:57] right
[36:58] but in the end time amen when gone
[37:01] through a prophetic ministry will take
[37:03] the veil off the Bible and open up the
[37:05] full measure of the word and restore us
[37:08] back to what the what the apostles
[37:10] taught what the Apostle Paul taught in
[37:11] the beginning amen back to the faith of
[37:13] the fathers now there's no more partial
[37:16] he turned on the light there is a man
[37:18] here that can turn on the light and it's
[37:20] the True Light
[37:23] it's the full light it's the real light
[37:25] but you can never say all that was false
[37:28] light it wasn't false light it was true
[37:31] in every age and dispensation but it was
[37:33] all pointing to the true true
[37:37] it was all showing that this is a little
[37:39] more of the true but there's a full
[37:41] measure of true coming amen and then
[37:43] there's another measure of truth but
[37:45] wait there's a full measure there's an
[37:47] absolutely true there's a full measure
[37:49] of truth there's a genuine true and he
[37:52] is the he that speaks to you is he that
[37:54] is true
[37:56] Jesus Christ is the full reality of God
[37:59] he is the fullness of the word he is the
[38:03] True Light
[38:05] so there's no discrediting of the
[38:09] previous light
[38:10] but when they came
[38:13] to Jesus Christ wanting bread like Moses
[38:16] gave
[38:17] bread from heaven
[38:18] Jesus was saying that was good
[38:22] but that wasn't the true bread
[38:25] that come down from heaven
[38:27] that was bread that came down from
[38:28] heaven and it was true and real but the
[38:32] true bread that came down from heaven is
[38:34] me
[38:36] I am the true bread
[38:38] and it was a test to see whether they
[38:41] wanted partial or whether they wanted
[38:44] fullness
[38:45] whether they wanted what was true in
[38:48] semblance or if they wanted what was
[38:50] true in fullness
[38:54] and see man has always stayed in what's
[38:56] true in semblance because they like
[38:59] there's a certain portion of of living
[39:03] in the darkness that becomes comfortable
[39:06] there's a certain requirement that
[39:08] coming to the light has
[39:10] because when things are left in the
[39:12] shadows amen they're not fully aware
[39:15] you're not fully understood amen and
[39:17] there's not a full responsibility
[39:20] but when you come to the full reality to
[39:23] the full line then there's a full
[39:25] illumination and a full illumination
[39:26] brings a full responsibility to the full
[39:29] word so man will stick with the
[39:31] semblance
[39:33] just like if you take a picture you take
[39:36] a eight by ten picture of me and set it
[39:38] in my children's room and say this is
[39:40] your father
[39:43] it's true
[39:46] now you better shape up he's here
[39:49] don't this is your father
[39:52] obey
[39:54] well I mean that's a piece of cake it's
[39:56] just a semblance
[39:58] but when I step into the room now
[40:00] there's a greater level of
[40:02] responsibility because now I can speak
[40:04] to the situation now I can bring
[40:06] illumination to whatever needs
[40:07] illuminated now do you want the picture
[40:10] of daddy or do you want Daddy
[40:12] do you want a daddy entitle or do you
[40:15] want a real daddy amen do we want a god
[40:17] entitle or do we want a real God do we
[40:19] want a Jesus Christ entitle or form or
[40:22] tradition amen a token uh something that
[40:25] we can repeat and speak about that will
[40:27] that we believe will give us an entrance
[40:29] into heaven or do we want the real Jesus
[40:31] Christ amen the real true one that's
[40:34] true in every way because if we want the
[40:37] true one he brings with him an
[40:39] illumination and that illumination
[40:41] brings a responsibility because the true
[40:43] Jesus Christ is the word made flesh made
[40:46] manifest and he will bring light to
[40:48] every situation in our life and there'll
[40:50] be no more Darkness remaining in our
[40:52] life when the light comes
[40:55] this is why amen human beings love
[40:58] tradition they love ritual they love
[41:00] church tradition and church ritual
[41:02] because you can go through the ritual
[41:03] and be told that you get admittance into
[41:05] heaven because of the ritual amen but
[41:07] there's a real life Jesus Christ here
[41:09] today and he's here there's a man here
[41:12] that can turn on the light and if we
[41:13] come to the light he'll he'll expose the
[41:16] darkness not just the darkness in the
[41:18] world he'll expose the darkness in our
[41:20] lives
[41:23] because he's the True Light amen and
[41:25] when we come to the True Light then
[41:27] there's a responsibility of coming to
[41:29] the True Light because then he's
[41:31] exposing all the nooks and crannies
[41:33] cracks and crevices and those parts of
[41:35] our life amen that stayed in the shadows
[41:37] for years
[41:39] and we didn't realize there was issues
[41:41] there and all of a sudden when the light
[41:43] comes on you can see there's issues
[41:45] there
[41:46] and then we're responsible for dealing
[41:48] with them
[41:50] but when Jesus said I'm the Bread of
[41:51] Heaven
[41:52] he was offering them not enough energy
[41:56] to sustain them for another day
[41:59] he was offering life that will sustain
[42:01] them forever
[42:04] and they walked away from that
[42:06] disappointed because they didn't get a
[42:09] bite for their mouth
[42:12] it just goes to show that I want to be
[42:16] interested in what's real
[42:18] what's true not what's temporal
[42:23] let's look back at Revelation chapter 3
[42:26] again
[42:47] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[42:50] and unto the angel the Church of the
[42:52] laodiceans write these things sat thee
[42:54] amen the faithful and true witness the
[42:57] beginning of the creation of God so here
[43:00] he's called the true witness same word
[43:02] true that we've been dealing with he's a
[43:03] true witness the the Bible says in John
[43:06] 1 that John the the John the Baptist was
[43:10] a witness to that lie he was a witness
[43:12] and was John a true witness who would
[43:15] agree he's a true witness but Jesus is
[43:17] the witness amen he is the true witness
[43:20] every witness Moses was a witness
[43:22] Jeremiah Was A Witness amen Paul was a
[43:25] witness John was a witness they were all
[43:28] Witnesses but Jesus Christ is the true
[43:31] witness he's the one who truly witnessed
[43:34] of all that God was and testified of all
[43:37] that God was because he was God God In
[43:40] the Flesh God dwelling in flesh God
[43:43] dwelling in his own flesh manifesting
[43:45] the life of God he is the true Witness
[43:50] amen
[43:53] we know in first John I'll just give you
[43:56] this reference first John 4 7. said
[43:58] beloved let us love one another for love
[44:00] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[44:03] born of God and knoweth God he that
[44:05] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[44:07] love so we know that God is love and if
[44:09] God is love that's true love
[44:12] and if there is a true love then there
[44:15] which is not impartial which is fullness
[44:17] then there must be a partial expression
[44:20] of love
[44:21] which we know as filio love or human
[44:23] love
[44:24] the prophet of God says now as we see
[44:27] the law pass away and we see Justice if
[44:29] God pass away the sternness of his
[44:31] judgment pass away then let's look over
[44:33] here this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[44:35] what was it God's love God's love stood
[44:39] there represented in Christ Jesus Christ
[44:41] was the manifestation of God's love
[44:45] we've all sinned and come short of the
[44:46] glory of God but God's love is
[44:48] represented in his son he said hear ye
[44:51] him no matter what the law says and what
[44:52] this other says and what this says and
[44:54] what the church says hear ye him all
[44:56] other things pass away
[44:58] he becomes the culmination the full
[45:01] expression of everything
[45:04] and so now there is a true love which
[45:07] God is love so if it's God God is love
[45:10] this love is God then it has to be true
[45:13] love
[45:15] is that right
[45:16] but the prophet said endorsed to the
[45:18] heart it says how many really love the
[45:20] Lord just really love him don't care
[45:22] what the church isn't that wonderful at
[45:25] least 95 percent here say they love him
[45:28] what is God God is love he that loveth
[45:31] is of God now that isn't what we call
[45:33] free love that's Agape of love that's
[45:37] two different kinds of love and in the
[45:39] scripture there's two Greek words for
[45:40] love one is one of us is a love based on
[45:44] feeling of a feeling type of love
[45:46] between friends between relatives
[45:48] between relationships but another is
[45:50] agape love it's a different form of love
[45:53] and this is what he's referring to
[45:54] there's two different kinds of love one
[45:56] of them is a Greek word filio means
[45:58] friendship the kind you have for your
[46:00] wife love that kind of love that kind of
[46:03] love is not a true love
[46:06] did you hear what he said that kind of
[46:09] love is not a true love oh but we talk
[46:11] about true love amen and we write notes
[46:13] and we write cards and this is my true
[46:15] love and this is true love amen it is a
[46:19] true love because you really do love
[46:21] that person
[46:23] I mean I'm gonna ask for a show of hands
[46:24] but I assume 100 would say I love my
[46:26] husband I love my wife
[46:28] and you would say it's a true love amen
[46:30] but that's a love that's on a human
[46:32] realm love amen but there's a greater
[46:35] love that can even come into a
[46:36] husband-wife relationship more than just
[46:39] a feeling love amen can come agape love
[46:41] which is God's love which is a greater
[46:44] love yet and that is true love
[46:48] that is the love it hold that's the love
[46:50] that holds when you don't like each
[46:52] other for a few minutes
[46:57] that's the love that holds you know on a
[47:00] bad day
[47:03] he says
[47:05] that kind of love is not a true love
[47:10] oh I know you little teenagers want to
[47:12] believe that but it's wrong
[47:14] that kind of love will make you jealous
[47:16] of your wife
[47:17] remember I said it'll make you even
[47:19] shoot another man over jealousy
[47:22] that ain't real love that's filio love
[47:26] but agape love will make you get down
[47:29] and pray for that man's Soul that's
[47:31] agape love that's the kind of love the
[47:33] church needs that we all need is that
[47:36] kind of love
[47:37] the world there's love expressed in the
[47:40] world and it's true we don't discount
[47:42] that it's not false there's love in our
[47:45] families there's love in our homes
[47:46] there's love and relationships amen
[47:49] there's love between a man and a woman
[47:50] there's there's love and it's true and
[47:52] it's real but that love is only supposed
[47:55] to point to another love
[47:57] it's a semblance of the true love it's a
[48:00] reflection of the true love because the
[48:03] love of emotion of feelings it goes up
[48:05] and down as feelings go up and down Amen
[48:07] in a relationship you can and in a
[48:10] friendship you can experience love and
[48:12] you can experience frustration just
[48:14] moments apart
[48:16] you can want to be with somebody every
[48:18] minute of the day and you can want to
[48:20] get away from somebody as quickly as you
[48:21] can all within the same day
[48:25] but there's that's only showing it's a
[48:28] partial amen that can't be the perfect
[48:31] it's a partial showing there is a
[48:32] perfect and that perfect is God himself
[48:35] because God is love and this love that
[48:37] is God is a perfect love it doesn't
[48:40] change it doesn't Wane it doesn't go up
[48:42] and down with the times or or with
[48:44] anything God's love is perfect and God's
[48:46] love for you and I are perfect
[48:48] [Music]
[48:49] that's true love in Jesus Christ is the
[48:52] expression of that
[48:53] Jesus said in John 15 1 I am the True
[48:56] Vine
[48:57] same word true and my father's a
[49:00] husbandman he is the true vine amen and
[49:03] so if he's the True Vine the vine is
[49:06] what carries the life to the branches
[49:08] and we are the branches he said I am the
[49:11] vine you are the branches if he's the
[49:13] True Vine amen that means that the only
[49:16] place for a branch to be plugged into
[49:18] for True Life to bring true fruit is
[49:21] Into The True Vine
[49:23] amen they're they're not another Vine
[49:27] but the True Vine
[49:29] there's been other Vines
[49:32] there's been other there's been other
[49:34] systems that even God has worked through
[49:36] even gone even though God is above all
[49:38] systems amen there's been other Vines
[49:40] and God has worked through other Vines
[49:41] but now in this end time we have the
[49:44] True Vine amen and it's the only thing
[49:47] to be attached to is the true vine
[49:49] because from the True Vine comes the
[49:51] true life and if you're a branch tapped
[49:53] into the True Vine you'll bring forth
[49:55] the true fruit
[49:58] let's look at John 14.
[50:12] John 14.
[50:14] in verse 6.
[50:19] Jesus saith unto them I am the way
[50:23] the truth
[50:25] and the life
[50:27] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[50:30] that means he is the way
[50:34] every other way before him was a partial
[50:36] but he is the way
[50:38] he is the life every other life is
[50:41] partial but he is the true life
[50:46] he is the truth everything else is
[50:48] partial but he is the truth
[50:52] now I want to look at first John 1 for a
[50:55] few minutes if we go back near the Book
[50:57] of Revelations to First John chapter 1.
[51:02] read a couple verses there
[51:06] first John
[51:13] 1 and 2 verses 1 and 2. that which was
[51:17] from the beginning which we have heard
[51:18] which we have seen with our eyes which
[51:20] we have looked upon and our hands have
[51:22] handled of the word of life
[51:24] for the life was manifested and we have
[51:26] seen him and bear witness and show unto
[51:29] you that eternal life which was with the
[51:31] father and was manifested unto us
[51:35] Jesus is that life let's go to verse
[51:38] five same book first John 5 first John 1
[51:41] or yeah first John 5 sorry first John 5
[51:45] and 18.
[51:48] and I want to read this
[51:50] scripture carefully it's going to use
[51:52] this word true the same word and the
[51:54] same meaning that we've been talking
[51:55] about first John 5 18.
[52:00] we know that whosoever is born of God
[52:01] sinneth not but he that has begotten of
[52:04] God keepeth himself and that Wicked one
[52:06] toucheth him not and we know that we are
[52:09] of God and the whole world lieth in
[52:11] wickedness
[52:12] and we know that the Son of God is come
[52:15] and hath given us
[52:17] an understanding that we may know him
[52:19] that is true
[52:21] and we are in him that is true even in
[52:24] his son Jesus Christ this is the true
[52:28] God and eternal life
[52:31] he has given us understanding of who's
[52:33] of him that is true that's God
[52:37] and we are in him that is true that's
[52:39] Jesus Christ
[52:41] this is the true God and eternal life if
[52:46] you're in Christ you're in God Amen and
[52:49] he is the true he is the true witness of
[52:52] God he is the true witness amen he is
[52:55] the full reality he is the truth of God
[52:58] Amen
[52:59] and and he gave us understanding of him
[53:02] that's true because we're in him that's
[53:04] true that's in Jesus Christ amen this is
[53:07] the true God and eternal life so if
[53:10] you're in Christ then you've come into
[53:12] the truth amen you are in what is true
[53:16] Jesus said in John 7 28 you both know me
[53:20] and you know whence I am and I am not
[53:22] coming myself but he that sent me is
[53:25] true
[53:26] God is true he is true
[53:30] everything that's true real genuine the
[53:33] absolute is gone Amen in Jesus Christ is
[53:37] the truth amen he has manifest to us to
[53:40] truth
[53:41] back in the Philadelphian Church age out
[53:43] of the church age book The Prophet says
[53:45] there isn't anything in this life
[53:48] satisfying as it may be as good and as
[53:51] fine as it may be but you will find the
[53:53] sum total of all perfection in Christ
[53:57] everything Fades into insignificance
[54:00] beside him
[54:02] oh let that be our experience
[54:05] let our experience be that we've come to
[54:07] the true
[54:09] we've come to true love we've come to
[54:11] True Life we've come to True Word we've
[54:13] come to True everything that is
[54:15] everything that the Parsha was pointing
[54:17] to we now have the ability to come to
[54:20] the true fulfillment of everything that
[54:22] the Bible every shadow every time amen
[54:25] every everything every substance in the
[54:28] earth everything that we look at has all
[54:30] been pointing to one thing and Jesus
[54:32] Christ is the truth of that one thing
[54:34] and we can come to that truth and
[54:37] partake of that truth and be in that
[54:39] truth amen
[54:41] so we'll find the sum total of all
[54:43] perfection in Christ everything Fades
[54:47] into insignificance beside him and
[54:50] Christ is the anointed word for the day
[54:54] he's the part that he's the word that
[54:56] has been anointed the light that has
[54:58] been called to shine in this day and for
[55:00] the Gentile dispensation we live in the
[55:03] day when it's not partial anymore but
[55:05] it's full light and everything else
[55:08] fades in significance everything else
[55:10] pales in comparison everything else
[55:12] Fades away because we amen as a bride
[55:16] have been given the True Light the true
[55:18] bread the true life the true Everything
[55:22] we now have
[55:24] and we can either enter in and partake
[55:26] of or we can stay with the partial
[55:29] but when Jesus was here they wanted to
[55:32] stay with the partial to stay with the
[55:33] religion and the order and the things
[55:35] that Moses had established and he says
[55:37] you believe in Moses he said if you
[55:39] believed in Moses you would believe in
[55:40] me for Moses spake of me everything
[55:42] Moses was telling you was me
[55:47] oh praise be to God
[55:50] let's go to John chapter 4.
[55:53] I love flipping between John and John
[55:59] so it's almost as if John had the
[56:01] bride's message
[56:05] John chapter 4.
[56:10] verse 7.
[56:13] yeah John chapter 4 verse 7. super
[56:16] familiar this is the woman at the well
[56:18] the woman of Samaria we we know this so
[56:20] well
[56:21] but in verse 7
[56:23] he says there came a woman of Samaria to
[56:25] draw water
[56:26] Jesus saith in her give me to drink
[56:29] for his disciples were going away into
[56:31] the city to buy meat then saved the
[56:33] woman of Samaria unto him how is it that
[56:35] thou being a Jew ask his drink of me
[56:37] which I'm a woman of Samaria for the
[56:40] Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans
[56:42] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[56:45] knewest the gift of God and who it is
[56:47] that saith they give me to drink thou
[56:49] wouldst have asked of him and he would
[56:51] have given thee Living Water
[56:55] they were standing beside a natural well
[56:57] with natural water and he tells the
[57:00] woman give me a drink and she said you
[57:02] know we're not supposed to be dealing
[57:04] with one another the Jews and the
[57:05] Samaritans why are you now asking me he
[57:07] said if you knew the gift of God if you
[57:09] knew who was speaking to you you would
[57:10] ask me and I would give you living water
[57:13] now he's not talking about what's in the
[57:15] well
[57:17] he's talking about true water
[57:20] true water
[57:22] the woman said unto him
[57:24] sir thou has nothing to draw with and
[57:27] the well is deep from Winston hast thou
[57:29] that Living Water art thou greater than
[57:31] our father Jacob which gave us the well
[57:33] and drank thereof himself his children
[57:35] and his his children and his cattle
[57:38] Jesus answered and said unto him
[57:39] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[57:42] thirst again
[57:44] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[57:46] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[57:48] the water that I shall give him shall be
[57:51] in him a well of water springing up into
[57:54] everlasting life
[57:55] now look what Jesus he's offering the
[57:59] woman a true water
[58:02] she's coming to get water because she
[58:04] needs water for survival
[58:06] but he's coming and giving her true
[58:08] water because what she really needs is
[58:10] not this water because the water she has
[58:12] now was never able to change her life
[58:15] she dipped and dipped and dipped and
[58:18] sustained a natural life but it never
[58:20] brought her eternal life and never
[58:22] changed her life she kept falling into
[58:24] the habitual repetition of a immoral
[58:27] life amen she was a woman who was caught
[58:30] in adultery and immorality and had
[58:31] multiple husbands amen but that water
[58:34] couldn't change her but Jesus was
[58:36] offering Living Water that would give
[58:38] her life amen then we give her
[58:40] everlasting life and not that not he
[58:42] said if you come and take this water of
[58:44] me this water will be in you amen now
[58:48] it's not just in me but if you come and
[58:50] partake of me the true water will be in
[58:53] you and it will be springing up a water
[58:56] of everlasting life
[58:58] so that you would never thirst again
[58:59] just like you said with the bread if
[59:01] you're taking the bread you'll never
[59:02] hunger again you drink of this water
[59:04] you'll never thirst again
[59:06] she wanted that water he began to
[59:09] discern her life
[59:11] she began to ask about worship and he
[59:12] began to tell her about those things
[59:17] and she says in verse 25 the woman saith
[59:19] unto him I know that messiah's cometh
[59:22] which is called Christ when he has come
[59:25] he will tell us all things Jesus said
[59:28] unto her I that's speaketh unto thee am
[59:31] he
[59:32] and upon upon this came his disciples
[59:34] and marveled that he talked with the
[59:36] woman yet no man saith what seekest thou
[59:38] or why talkest thou with her The Woman
[59:41] verse 28 the woman then left her water
[59:45] pot
[59:47] she didn't need it anymore
[59:50] she left her water pot and went her way
[59:52] into the City and say to the men come
[59:55] see a man which told me all things that
[59:57] ever I did is not this the Christ
[1:00:01] she didn't needed a water pot because
[1:00:03] now she became the Fountain of Living
[1:00:05] Water
[1:00:06] she had Eternal water she had came and
[1:00:10] she drank and now she's dispensing the
[1:00:13] same water Amen to others and they're
[1:00:15] coming to him to drink let's go over to
[1:00:17] John chapter 7 now
[1:00:20] John chapter 7.
[1:00:25] verse 37.
[1:00:29] in the last day that great day of the
[1:00:31] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[1:00:33] any man thirst let him come to me and
[1:00:36] drink
[1:00:37] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:00:39] has said out of his belly shall flow
[1:00:41] rivers of Living Water but this spake he
[1:00:43] of the spirit which they that believe on
[1:00:45] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[1:00:47] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[1:00:49] not yet glorified so he's talking of the
[1:00:52] indwelling of the Holy Ghost the baptism
[1:00:54] of the Holy Ghost which will bring
[1:00:56] waters of everlasting life and Jesus is
[1:00:59] standing up saying come to me and drink
[1:01:01] amen he's not now referring to the
[1:01:04] semblance he's not referring to the
[1:01:06] partial he's not referring to the tide
[1:01:08] but now he's pointing them to the
[1:01:10] reality amen and can you imagine
[1:01:12] standing there that day when he cries
[1:01:14] come to me and drink amen he doesn't
[1:01:17] have a cup he doesn't have a gourd he
[1:01:18] doesn't have a bucket he has no natural
[1:01:21] water but what he has is the true water
[1:01:23] Living Water everlasting life the very
[1:01:26] spirit of God that he's going to put
[1:01:28] into his people amen he has the true
[1:01:31] Living Water
[1:01:34] and every time we take a drink to
[1:01:36] sustain our life it's proving that there
[1:01:38] must be a water to Keep Us Alive
[1:01:40] spiritually amen for Life there has to
[1:01:42] be water
[1:01:44] and if you look at what what what Jesus
[1:01:46] is describing amen what's described to
[1:01:49] us in the in the New Testament he's the
[1:01:52] true water he can give you the true
[1:01:54] water he's the true bread he's the True
[1:01:57] Light
[1:01:58] in natural existence nothing can live
[1:02:01] without food Water and Light
[1:02:05] we know the natural we live in the
[1:02:07] natural we're born in the natural and
[1:02:10] everything in the natural is pointing to
[1:02:12] something else
[1:02:13] it's showing us that there's another
[1:02:15] reality this isn't the reality friends
[1:02:18] is it a reality yes but it's not the
[1:02:20] true reality the true reality is beyond
[1:02:23] the veil of our eyesight
[1:02:25] but it's just as real as real can be
[1:02:28] remember Abraham he walked around
[1:02:30] looking for a city whose Builder and
[1:02:32] maker was gone he was looking for a City
[1:02:34] without foundation and the prophet of
[1:02:36] God said that city was just hovering
[1:02:38] just over him it was a supernatural
[1:02:40] Jerusalem amen it wasn't the natural
[1:02:42] Jerusalem there was a natural Jerusalem
[1:02:45] and it was real and it was true
[1:02:48] right Amen in the presence of God dwelt
[1:02:51] that when the temple was there
[1:02:54] and even if if when Solomon prayed when
[1:02:57] there was a natural temple built Solomon
[1:02:59] would pray Lord no matter where your
[1:03:01] people are if they get in trouble if
[1:03:03] they look to this building and pray hear
[1:03:05] from heaven and answer their prayer amen
[1:03:07] there was a place where God dwelt
[1:03:09] amongst his people it was true but it
[1:03:11] wasn't the truth
[1:03:14] because God didn't want to dwell in the
[1:03:16] temple made with hands he wanted to
[1:03:18] dwell in people amen and that Temple was
[1:03:21] pointing to another reality
[1:03:23] and the reality was so true and God
[1:03:26] would establish it that if anybody
[1:03:27] turned and faced the temple and prayed
[1:03:29] God would hear from Heaven remember the
[1:03:31] prayer amen of Jonah in the belly of the
[1:03:34] whale at the bottom of the sea he he
[1:03:36] remembered amen this this prayer of
[1:03:39] Solomon and he turned to the temple he's
[1:03:42] in a vicious belly he doesn't know which
[1:03:45] way the temple is but in his heart in
[1:03:47] reverence to the truth that God had
[1:03:49] established in that day he turned
[1:03:51] himself to that word for his day and God
[1:03:54] heard from heaven and God answered and
[1:03:56] delivered him out of the mouth of the
[1:03:57] well
[1:04:00] that's what the truth and the day will
[1:04:01] do but if that will work in a partial
[1:04:04] what will happen in a full-blown reality
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:10] praise be to God
[1:04:12] if we recognize where his presence is to
[1:04:15] this day
[1:04:16] and we turn to him the word made
[1:04:19] manifest in our day the word that's on
[1:04:22] display today not what he was but what
[1:04:24] he is
[1:04:26] you can't you can't now turn to
[1:04:28] Jerusalem amen God allowed that Temple
[1:04:32] to be destroyed to be brought to Rubble
[1:04:34] amen first by the Babylonians and then
[1:04:37] by the Romans
[1:04:39] he and he allowed it and he said when it
[1:04:42] comes to the time of destruction of the
[1:04:43] Romans he said there'll not be one stone
[1:04:46] left upon another it was an absolute
[1:04:48] total Destruction amen because that
[1:04:50] wasn't the the truth it was true it was
[1:04:54] real it was the truth for the day but
[1:04:57] it's not the truth it wasn't the
[1:04:59] ultimate truth he didn't want a physical
[1:05:01] Temple that were made by physical hands
[1:05:03] amen Jesus Christ himself was the temple
[1:05:08] that was the true
[1:05:10] that's what the Tabernacle in the
[1:05:12] wilderness was pointing to
[1:05:14] if God just wanted the Tabernacle in the
[1:05:16] wilderness he would have preserved it to
[1:05:17] our day there would still be a
[1:05:19] tabernacle set up in Israel and we would
[1:05:21] be taking homage we would be saving our
[1:05:23] money and flying out there three times a
[1:05:25] year every male here to go worship
[1:05:27] before God
[1:05:29] but it was a semblance of Truth
[1:05:32] showing that there was another
[1:05:34] Tabernacle made of skins
[1:05:36] where God was going to dwell and we can
[1:05:39] turn to that Tabernacle which is our
[1:05:41] Lord Jesus Christ and be saved
[1:05:46] God is so good
[1:05:51] Jesus said in John chapter 2 destroy
[1:05:54] this Temple
[1:05:56] three days I'll raise it up again
[1:05:59] here's the response then said the Jews
[1:06:01] 40 and six years was this Temple and
[1:06:03] building
[1:06:04] and wilt thou rear it up in three days
[1:06:08] but he spake of the Temple of his body
[1:06:12] they were stuck in the natural and he
[1:06:14] was looking at the spiritual fulfillment
[1:06:16] of the word which was in him he was the
[1:06:19] temple of God and God was dwelling in
[1:06:21] him
[1:06:24] amen there was a high priest that God
[1:06:27] had established over the Tabernacle and
[1:06:29] over the temple worship and that high
[1:06:31] priest were the sons of Aaron and God
[1:06:33] established it were they true high
[1:06:34] priest they were true High priests
[1:06:37] but were they they the truth of the high
[1:06:39] priest no they weren't the true high
[1:06:41] priest
[1:06:42] because Jesus Christ is a high priest
[1:06:44] after the order of Melchizedek he is the
[1:06:47] true high priest
[1:06:49] so every high priest taken of man amen
[1:06:52] he makes offerings for man but the true
[1:06:54] high priest came in the form of man so
[1:06:56] that he might understand you and I so
[1:06:58] they might make intercession for us on
[1:07:00] behalf of us to God Amen and he is the
[1:07:03] true high priest after the order of
[1:07:05] Melchizedek which is an eternal
[1:07:07] priesthood so the priesthood of the
[1:07:09] aaronic priesthood the priesthood of the
[1:07:11] Levites then after the return on the
[1:07:13] Babylon it was all pointing to the truth
[1:07:16] of a high priest and Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:18] truth of the high priest
[1:07:22] so we don't any longer go to a high
[1:07:25] priest
[1:07:26] we don't anymore go to a priest for
[1:07:28] confession for our Pope or for he is the
[1:07:31] high priest
[1:07:33] he is the truth of the high priest
[1:07:36] praise be to God
[1:07:38] let's look in John chapter 4.
[1:07:42] this is still in the story of the woman
[1:07:45] at the well the Samaritan
[1:07:52] verse 21.
[1:07:56] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[1:08:00] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[1:08:02] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[1:08:04] worship the father
[1:08:05] ye worship you know not what we know
[1:08:08] what we worship for salvation is of the
[1:08:10] Jews
[1:08:11] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[1:08:14] true worshipers
[1:08:16] guess what word this word true is the
[1:08:19] same word we've been dealing with all
[1:08:21] along
[1:08:22] there are worshipers but there are true
[1:08:25] worshipers
[1:08:26] when the true worshipers shall worship
[1:08:28] the father in spirit and in truth for
[1:08:32] the father seek as such to worship him
[1:08:35] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:08:38] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:08:42] truth
[1:08:45] he says there's coming a day and now is
[1:08:48] when the true worshipers
[1:08:52] there must be true worshipers
[1:08:56] listen the world is full of worshipers
[1:09:00] and I I won't even say that they're all
[1:09:02] false
[1:09:04] but there's got to be true worshipers
[1:09:07] there could be semblance of worship
[1:09:09] there could even be worship going to
[1:09:11] Jesus Christ even if it's a historical
[1:09:13] understanding of Jesus Christ it's still
[1:09:15] true
[1:09:17] they're still worshiping even a
[1:09:18] historical understanding amen there's
[1:09:20] worshipers but there must be true
[1:09:23] worshipers there must be that which is
[1:09:25] not a semblance of a worship or a form
[1:09:28] of a worshiper or a partial worshiper
[1:09:30] but there must be a full reality of a
[1:09:32] worshiper in this day
[1:09:34] one that'll worship the father in spirit
[1:09:37] and in truth not just by the letter of
[1:09:39] the law but by the very spirit that he's
[1:09:41] provided amen and come together with
[1:09:43] spirit and truth and not partial truth
[1:09:46] but full truth amen we live in the day
[1:09:48] of full truth and it's brought the full
[1:09:50] life and now we can be true worshipers
[1:09:52] with the full life of God and the the
[1:09:55] full spirit of God and the full word of
[1:09:57] God we have spirit and Truth
[1:10:01] so may God make us true worshipers
[1:10:05] in Hebrews chapter 10 I'll just read
[1:10:08] this one too Hebrews 10 and 19.
[1:10:11] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[1:10:13] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:10:15] Jesus by a New and Living Way which he
[1:10:18] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[1:10:19] that is to say his flesh and having a
[1:10:22] high priest over the house of God let us
[1:10:24] draw near with a True Heart
[1:10:28] guess what we're true this is
[1:10:30] the same thing no partiality no
[1:10:34] semblance no type
[1:10:37] but a full True Heart
[1:10:41] with a true heart and full Assurance of
[1:10:44] Faith having our hearts sprinkled from
[1:10:46] an evil conscience and our bodies washed
[1:10:48] with pure water let us hold fast the
[1:10:51] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:10:52] for he is faithful that promised
[1:10:56] let's turn to Colossians chapter 2.
[1:11:00] he said we must draw near with a pure
[1:11:03] heart
[1:11:08] do you know there was a circumcision
[1:11:10] given to Abraham in the descendants of
[1:11:12] Abraham
[1:11:13] and all the Jews practice circumcision
[1:11:15] as a covenant as a token of the Covenant
[1:11:17] that God had with the children of Israel
[1:11:21] and so they would circumcise every male
[1:11:23] on the eighth day
[1:11:24] and it was a Perpetual Covenant
[1:11:28] but when Paul comes along Paul says
[1:11:30] that's not the true circumcision
[1:11:33] was it a true circumcision it was a true
[1:11:35] circumcision
[1:11:37] ask all the men that had to be
[1:11:39] circumcised after they came through the
[1:11:41] Wilderness journey and they hadn't
[1:11:42] circumcised an entire generation of men
[1:11:44] and they all had to make sharp knives
[1:11:46] and they all had to be circumcised in
[1:11:48] gilgal before they went to the promised
[1:11:50] land every one of you then would tell
[1:11:52] you that was a true circumcision
[1:11:54] they felt that they knew it it was true
[1:11:57] but it wasn't the true circumcision
[1:12:00] it was a semblance it was a shadow
[1:12:02] pointing to one to come
[1:12:04] and in chapter 2 verse 10 it says
[1:12:09] and ye are complete in him which is the
[1:12:12] head of all principality and Power in
[1:12:14] him also you are circumcised with the
[1:12:16] circumcision made without hands and
[1:12:19] putting off putting off the body of sin
[1:12:22] of the flesh by the circumcision of
[1:12:25] Christ so we are circumcised in Christ
[1:12:28] what is the circumcision of Christ it is
[1:12:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's when
[1:12:32] God amen amen when the old nature dies
[1:12:35] and God puts his own Spirit his own life
[1:12:37] into you it's the circumcision of Christ
[1:12:39] and it's the circumcision made without
[1:12:41] hands this is the true circumcision the
[1:12:44] other was a time showing that there has
[1:12:46] to come a truth
[1:12:48] let's go back to Romans
[1:12:50] and read it this scripture again in
[1:12:52] Romans
[1:12:56] Romans chapter 2.
[1:12:58] and verse 28.
[1:13:05] Romans 2 28 he said for he is not a Jew
[1:13:08] which is one outwardly neither is he
[1:13:11] that circumcision which is outwardly in
[1:13:13] flesh
[1:13:14] so that's not even the circumcision now
[1:13:16] Paul's saying that's not even it but he
[1:13:18] is a Jew which is one inwardly and
[1:13:20] circumcision is that of the heart in the
[1:13:24] spirit and not in the letter whose
[1:13:26] praise is not of men but of God so now
[1:13:29] if we're going to approach him to God
[1:13:30] with a with a True Heart amen we must
[1:13:33] receive a true circumcision and that
[1:13:36] true circumcision is the circumcision of
[1:13:38] the heart where all the things of the
[1:13:40] world the things of Flesh the things of
[1:13:41] the natural must be cut off and we must
[1:13:44] die to the Natural man amen and receive
[1:13:46] a spiritual life a quickening that comes
[1:13:49] from the life of God the quick and the
[1:13:51] inner man to bring the seed of God to
[1:13:53] life amen and that is the circumcision
[1:13:55] of the heart and that gives us a pure
[1:13:57] heart to approach unto God in a True
[1:14:00] Heart
[1:14:01] to be a true worshiper in a true God
[1:14:07] Hallelujah
[1:14:13] Jesus
[1:14:15] makes everything true
[1:14:19] just if you understand just bear with me
[1:14:21] for a minute in Christ
[1:14:23] remember Christ is the anointed word for
[1:14:26] your day
[1:14:28] in Christ he makes everything true
[1:14:32] so the presence of God makes wherever is
[1:14:36] present is true
[1:14:39] right
[1:14:41] his presence makes anything
[1:14:43] the living reality
[1:14:46] so the real living reality of God in
[1:14:49] Moses day was The Exodus Journey that
[1:14:51] was the living reality of God we know
[1:14:53] that it was partial it never came to
[1:14:55] fullness there was a fullness coming but
[1:14:56] it was the living reality what made it
[1:14:58] the living reality what made it the
[1:15:00] light of the day it was the presence of
[1:15:01] God
[1:15:03] and Jesus Christ is the ultimate of that
[1:15:05] reality
[1:15:07] God is the truth he's the true of
[1:15:09] everything he's the source of all true
[1:15:12] so he is the true
[1:15:14] and Jesus Christ is the true Witness
[1:15:20] God
[1:15:21] the manifested word
[1:15:26] the manifested word
[1:15:28] makes it the true word
[1:15:32] not just the word that's on paper it's
[1:15:35] the truth
[1:15:37] it's the truth there was a truth in the
[1:15:40] Bible of a coming Messiah
[1:15:43] and it was true
[1:15:45] but when the Messiah came that was truly
[1:15:48] true
[1:15:50] that was the full reality of that truth
[1:15:53] right it was true that a deliverer would
[1:15:56] come and deliver the children out of
[1:15:58] Egypt after 400 years
[1:16:01] and when Moses came he was that prophecy
[1:16:04] that word made manifest and he was the
[1:16:07] True Light of that day and it was true
[1:16:10] it was reality amen and when Jesus
[1:16:12] Christ came he was the light of that day
[1:16:14] he was the true he was the real so the
[1:16:17] word made manifest is the true reality
[1:16:21] we can talk about prophecy we can talk
[1:16:24] about all kinds of things but there's
[1:16:26] been partial there's been partial
[1:16:27] partial understanding it's it's all true
[1:16:30] amen but when it comes into full reality
[1:16:33] it is the full truth
[1:16:35] it is that which is true
[1:16:38] and brother bam says in the message it
[1:16:39] is the rising of the sun he said there
[1:16:42] was the first sheath come up from all
[1:16:44] prophets which was the Son of God the
[1:16:46] king of all Prophets
[1:16:48] there has been churches churches Brides
[1:16:51] brides churches Brides brides
[1:16:54] but there has got to come one
[1:16:57] Hallelujah there has to come a real
[1:17:01] bride
[1:17:03] not that none of the others were not
[1:17:05] real Adam was given a real bride
[1:17:08] was she real
[1:17:10] but she wasn't the real bride she wasn't
[1:17:12] the true bride she was a semblance or a
[1:17:15] type of a shadow of one to come Abraham
[1:17:17] was given a bride amen Israel was the
[1:17:20] first bride it was all true it was all
[1:17:23] real amen but the real reality the truth
[1:17:25] there must come a real bride or a true
[1:17:29] bride are the full measure of what God
[1:17:32] meant by bride
[1:17:34] the full measure amen not partial
[1:17:37] anymore not not with partial
[1:17:39] understanding pointing to a greater
[1:17:41] coming not with partial life pointing to
[1:17:43] a greater coming but there's been
[1:17:45] churches churches Brides brides churches
[1:17:47] Brides brides but there's got to come
[1:17:49] one there has to come a real bride at
[1:17:52] some point there has to be the true
[1:17:55] bride standing upon the Earth
[1:17:57] not any more partial but fullness
[1:18:01] said there has to come a real bride
[1:18:03] there must come one that's not only got
[1:18:06] the mechanics but the Dynamics of it
[1:18:08] makes the church live move in the power
[1:18:10] of his resurrection there's got to come
[1:18:12] one that's just not in term abide but in
[1:18:15] life a bride amen not in terminology not
[1:18:18] in a label not in uh uh uh not not in a
[1:18:21] a name or or an association but in a
[1:18:25] living reality it has not only the name
[1:18:27] of bride but has to have the life of
[1:18:29] bride at the same time
[1:18:31] there's got to come a real true bride
[1:18:34] and the message things that are to be so
[1:18:36] now if we are those attributes
[1:18:39] of God we cannot live by Creeds we
[1:18:42] cannot live by the nominationalism we
[1:18:43] must live by the word because the bride
[1:18:46] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[1:18:48] is part of her husband therefore we must
[1:18:50] be that word bride and what is the word
[1:18:53] bride the manifestation of this hour the
[1:18:56] bride not a Creed or denomination but a
[1:18:59] living Oracle of God a living attribute
[1:19:02] of God displaying to the world the
[1:19:05] attributes of God in the formation of
[1:19:07] the Bride that's to be expressed in this
[1:19:10] hour that we're now living
[1:19:14] there's been Brides brides churches
[1:19:16] churches Brides brides churches Brides
[1:19:18] but there's got to come one
[1:19:20] and when does it have to come forth in
[1:19:22] the hour that we're now living
[1:19:25] there has to be a real bride
[1:19:29] there has got to be on earth in the end
[1:19:31] time a real bride there has to be a true
[1:19:35] bride not partial but true not partial
[1:19:38] in life but true in life not partial in
[1:19:41] word but true in word there has to come
[1:19:43] a true bride
[1:19:46] he goes on to say Martin Luther could
[1:19:49] not express the attributes that we
[1:19:51] express
[1:19:52] was Martin Luther bride he was
[1:19:54] absolutely bride
[1:19:56] where the bride in that age absolutely
[1:19:58] where the bride in the West Lane it's
[1:20:00] absolutely bright and the Pentecostal
[1:20:02] age absolutely they were bragged real
[1:20:05] bride genuine bride
[1:20:07] but because they were in partial word
[1:20:09] there was an impartial expression
[1:20:12] there was partial mechanics and partial
[1:20:14] Dynamics
[1:20:16] so but at the end time there's not to be
[1:20:18] a partial bride but there's to be a
[1:20:20] complete bride there's not to be amen
[1:20:23] just a semblance of a bride or a
[1:20:25] foreshadow of a bride are part of the
[1:20:27] Bride making up the bride Martin Luther
[1:20:29] was the part defeat Wesley was coming on
[1:20:31] up to the hand I mean it was a building
[1:20:33] back of the Bride it's all part of the
[1:20:35] Bride but at the end time we're not
[1:20:37] talking about part of the Bride but
[1:20:38] we're talking about a real bride a true
[1:20:40] bride the full measure of what God meant
[1:20:43] when he said bride
[1:20:46] let's look at Colossians again
[1:20:50] I want to read two scriptures together
[1:21:04] Colossians chapter 3 verse 9.
[1:21:10] Colossians 3 and 9. lie not one to
[1:21:13] another seeing that you have put off the
[1:21:15] old man with his deeds and have put on
[1:21:17] the new man which is renewed in
[1:21:19] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:21:20] created him
[1:21:22] where there is neither Greek nor Jewish
[1:21:24] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[1:21:26] Barbarian scythian Bond are free but
[1:21:29] Christ is all
[1:21:31] and in all
[1:21:33] the point of the Gospel the point of
[1:21:37] Christ dying
[1:21:38] amen was so that he could cleanse and
[1:21:41] purify a people so that he could dwell
[1:21:44] in that people
[1:21:46] the point of Calvary was a a price of
[1:21:49] redemption that had to be paid but the
[1:21:51] blood was shed and there was a
[1:21:53] sanctifying power that would come so
[1:21:55] that he can purchase and cleanse a
[1:21:57] people so that he himself could step
[1:22:00] into that people so that he could be all
[1:22:02] and in all amen now it's neither Bond
[1:22:05] nor free it's neither Jew nor Gentile
[1:22:08] now it's Christ as all and in all amen
[1:22:13] and that was the whole point but the
[1:22:14] first church left Christ because they
[1:22:16] left the word they left the teaching of
[1:22:18] the Apostle Paul and they took the ideas
[1:22:20] of man and started their own
[1:22:21] denominations and their own thinking and
[1:22:24] they left Christ amen and now Christ
[1:22:26] eventually became more and more on the
[1:22:28] outside until in the later see in church
[1:22:30] he's knocking on the door trying to gain
[1:22:32] access to his own church he's been put
[1:22:34] out completely how do you put Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ out of a church when you toss the
[1:22:38] word of God out you put Jesus Christ out
[1:22:40] because remember John 1 1 in the
[1:22:42] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:22:44] with God and the Word was God
[1:22:46] John 1 14 the word was made flesh into
[1:22:48] one Among Us Jesus Christ is the word of
[1:22:50] God Amen and when you when you discount
[1:22:52] the Bible and you throw scriptures out
[1:22:55] you put Christ on the outside and that
[1:22:57] church that bride cannot be a real bride
[1:23:00] without Christ because Christ is the one
[1:23:03] that's true
[1:23:04] he is true he's all true every bit of
[1:23:07] him is true the full word of God with
[1:23:10] the full revelation of God is true it's
[1:23:13] the truth it's the fullness of Truth
[1:23:16] and if he's on the outside then that
[1:23:19] church can't be the bride Amen in order
[1:23:21] to be the bride we must have he that is
[1:23:23] true in the bride he must be all and in
[1:23:27] all and when he's all in in all then
[1:23:30] you'll be looking at the real bride the
[1:23:32] true bride not because she says she is
[1:23:36] not because she claims to be or bears a
[1:23:39] title amen that's not or be she
[1:23:41] Associates with those who believe they
[1:23:42] are that is not what makes her the real
[1:23:45] bride not of her own Merit not of her
[1:23:47] own works not of her own thinking but
[1:23:49] what makes her the real bride is when
[1:23:51] she's come back to that word and opened
[1:23:54] the door of her heart to receive all of
[1:23:56] Christ and now Christ in full measure is
[1:23:59] poured into his body which is the church
[1:24:02] and becomes all and in all and now she
[1:24:05] becomes the real bride
[1:24:08] what makes her the true bride
[1:24:11] the very person of Truth in her makes
[1:24:14] her the true bride
[1:24:16] not because she says she is
[1:24:19] not even because she thinks she is
[1:24:22] but when she becomes the Temple of the
[1:24:25] Living God
[1:24:26] when she becomes the Tabernacle when she
[1:24:30] becomes the dwelling place for the
[1:24:32] spirit of God she becomes the true bride
[1:24:36] the real bride
[1:24:38] truly truth of pride
[1:24:42] not on our own we can't do it on our own
[1:24:45] we must take him that is the truth
[1:24:48] and we must invite how do you how does
[1:24:51] the bride become the word by letting the
[1:24:53] word flow through her
[1:24:54] she must be the word because her
[1:24:56] bridegroom is the word and every
[1:24:57] brightest part of her husband Eve come
[1:25:00] out of Adam we have come out of Christ
[1:25:02] we must be word of his word amen life of
[1:25:04] his life Spirit of his spirit amen we
[1:25:07] we've got to be connected with him and
[1:25:09] his life and US amen we must be the
[1:25:11] dwelling place of almighty God and if
[1:25:13] Christ be in us and we be the expression
[1:25:15] of Christ then it will be a true bride
[1:25:21] let's look at Ephesians chapter one
[1:25:34] Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:25:38] and verse 20.
[1:25:47] verse 20 which he wrought in Christ when
[1:25:49] he raised him from the dead and he set
[1:25:51] him at his own right hand in the
[1:25:54] Heavenly places far above all
[1:25:56] principalities and power and might and
[1:25:58] Dominion in every name that is named not
[1:26:01] only in this world but also in the world
[1:26:03] to come and have put all things under
[1:26:06] his feet and gave him to be the the head
[1:26:09] over all things to the church which is
[1:26:11] his body
[1:26:12] so what is the body of Jesus Christ his
[1:26:15] church
[1:26:15] his bride which is his body the fullness
[1:26:19] of him that filleth all in all
[1:26:23] so where will the fullness be
[1:26:25] and the end time when the word has come
[1:26:26] back
[1:26:27] the fullness has come back
[1:26:29] the prophet of God told us all that God
[1:26:31] was he poured into Christ all that
[1:26:33] Christ is he's poured into the church
[1:26:38] what makes us a real bride
[1:26:42] because the true one he that is true
[1:26:45] has taken up residence in his body on
[1:26:49] Earth
[1:26:50] at the opening of the seals when the
[1:26:52] veil was taken away from the word and
[1:26:53] the Mystery of God was given to the
[1:26:55] bride it unlocked amen and Unbound and
[1:26:59] Unchained the Holy Ghost to come back
[1:27:00] into the church what Chained and limited
[1:27:03] the Holy Ghost partial word rejection of
[1:27:06] word refusing of God's word amen it was
[1:27:08] a chain that was binding amen it was
[1:27:10] limiting access to the Church of the
[1:27:13] Church of the Living God to the full
[1:27:15] measure of the Living God there was it
[1:27:17] was cut off amen by limited word when
[1:27:19] the word come back it broke the chains
[1:27:22] off and all the resistance and now the
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost is come back into the church
[1:27:26] again
[1:27:27] and what makes us a real bride is not
[1:27:30] because I stand up and say I'm part of
[1:27:31] the real bride but what makes me a real
[1:27:33] bride is the real bridegroom is in me
[1:27:35] amen the real bridegroom in you makes
[1:27:37] you the real bride what makes you true a
[1:27:40] True Heart A True Believer a true
[1:27:42] worshiper it's when the truth himself
[1:27:44] has come into you and living out of you
[1:27:47] it's not what we've done it's what
[1:27:49] Christ has done amen we we could never
[1:27:51] even come to God and Jesus says no man
[1:27:54] cometh to me lest the father draweth him
[1:27:56] first amen we can never come unless we
[1:27:58] were predestinated for known of God and
[1:28:01] destined to come and God had planted a
[1:28:03] seed of eternal life down inside of us
[1:28:05] something he could Quicken with the word
[1:28:07] in the day and we quit Quicken with his
[1:28:09] spirit amen and we have come because
[1:28:12] there's a peace of God on the inside
[1:28:13] that has the potential to live the life
[1:28:16] of God what makes us a true bride is
[1:28:18] because the true one has identified you
[1:28:20] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:28:22] a true expression of Bride
[1:28:24] not because we claim to be not because
[1:28:27] we line up our doctors not because we
[1:28:28] say I can cross the t's and Dot the eyes
[1:28:31] I must have I must come from him I must
[1:28:34] have his life quickening that seed
[1:28:36] inside of me it's got to be him in me
[1:28:38] making me a true bride if not I will be
[1:28:42] a semblance of a bride
[1:28:44] I will be a picture or a tie or a
[1:28:46] foreshadow and I don't want to be this
[1:28:49] generation foreshadowing a true bride
[1:28:51] that will come I want to be the true
[1:28:53] bride amen
[1:28:54] I want to be surrendered completely to
[1:28:57] him so that he can have free reign in me
[1:29:00] and live the full expression of what he
[1:29:02] always wanted in his bride
[1:29:05] it can't be me it must be him
[1:29:09] in me
[1:29:11] what have we received in this day the
[1:29:13] Lord has come
[1:29:15] he's come
[1:29:17] where has he come he's come to his body
[1:29:20] the headship has come to the body to
[1:29:24] what to bring life to the body what life
[1:29:28] true life
[1:29:30] true life
[1:29:31] by the True Life of Christ
[1:29:35] Corinthians 3 16 says no you not ye are
[1:29:40] the temple of God
[1:29:42] and the spirit of God dwelleth in you
[1:29:45] second Corinthians 6 3 6 16 says in one
[1:29:48] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:29:50] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:29:53] Living God
[1:29:55] where shall I turn
[1:29:57] where shall I look to find them in my
[1:30:00] time of need what where direction will I
[1:30:02] turn East and West no by the end wanting
[1:30:05] of a spirit I've become the temple and
[1:30:07] he's in me and I can turn to the one
[1:30:09] that's in me and say God Amen I need you
[1:30:12] to help me calm my nerves and give me
[1:30:14] Victory so that you can live your life
[1:30:17] out of me it's no longer me it was never
[1:30:20] the temple amen if it was the temple
[1:30:22] there was a temple that Solomon built it
[1:30:24] was glorious it was made to according to
[1:30:26] the fashion instructions that David
[1:30:28] received amen it had all the best
[1:30:30] material it was the it was the pride and
[1:30:32] honor of all Israel amen but it was
[1:30:35] temporal only foreshadowing what would
[1:30:37] come God would allow it to be taken down
[1:30:39] burnt and destroyed and all the gold
[1:30:41] vessels that were dedicated to the
[1:30:43] worship of God he would allow dirty
[1:30:45] Babylonian hands to carry it away
[1:30:48] because God never wanted that to be the
[1:30:51] ultimate he wanted that to be the
[1:30:53] foreshadow
[1:30:54] and when that was done serving its
[1:30:56] purpose he allowed it to be destroyed so
[1:30:58] that we would never get stuck there to
[1:31:00] go to another one what did he want he
[1:31:03] didn't want a temple made with hands he
[1:31:04] wanted a temple that he made a body
[1:31:07] shall thou prepare me
[1:31:09] what body the body of Jesus Christ which
[1:31:13] is his wife which is the church
[1:31:15] that body is to be the dwelling place of
[1:31:19] almighty God
[1:31:23] gone
[1:31:25] have full reign in full victory in your
[1:31:29] body
[1:31:31] and the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:31:33] Christ he says but you remember when it
[1:31:36] went down and the grain began to ripen
[1:31:37] that you find before that grain can
[1:31:39] ripen everything in the stalk has to be
[1:31:41] dead
[1:31:42] so in the growing of the wheat plant
[1:31:44] amen it grows and it begins to turn
[1:31:45] brown because everything dies so that
[1:31:47] the life can go into the sea so that the
[1:31:49] seed went back into the ground it could
[1:31:51] live again all life is in the seed the
[1:31:52] rest of it's dead
[1:31:54] said Hallelujah can't you see where
[1:31:56] we're standing
[1:31:57] life is in the grain again we've come
[1:32:00] back to the Sea Jesus was the seed that
[1:32:02] went in the ground the first church died
[1:32:04] and almost died through the church ages
[1:32:06] but has come back again and the
[1:32:07] restoration of the Bride tree now it's
[1:32:10] seed again it's the original life come
[1:32:12] back
[1:32:14] life is in the grain again what is it
[1:32:16] just exactly like the same grain that
[1:32:18] went in the ground
[1:32:20] the same Jesus in Bride form
[1:32:25] same power
[1:32:26] same church same thing same word the
[1:32:30] same word sucked up through all these
[1:32:32] and come out here and come to the head
[1:32:34] here
[1:32:36] Jesus is come
[1:32:38] when what way is he come we saw him in
[1:32:42] profit form
[1:32:43] displaying the son of man
[1:32:46] son of man is always a title of prophet
[1:32:48] and we saw him in the form of a son of
[1:32:50] man a son of man revealing the son of
[1:32:52] man we have witnessed them in profit
[1:32:54] form and that Prophet was also part of
[1:32:56] the Bride amen
[1:32:58] but now it's Jesus in Bride form the
[1:33:03] true bride
[1:33:05] every other bride they were true they're
[1:33:07] not taking it away but they were showing
[1:33:10] a greater reality amen Luther amen he
[1:33:13] was true bride but he swore he cussed
[1:33:16] his smoke he drank he he didn't have a
[1:33:18] life of Holiness it wasn't the full
[1:33:20] reflection of a bride although he was
[1:33:22] bright and he was true but he wasn't the
[1:33:24] true bride
[1:33:27] but now in the end time
[1:33:29] God has released the power at the
[1:33:31] opening of his word
[1:33:33] that word amen that word is not paper
[1:33:37] not print on paper it's a living reality
[1:33:40] of a living God
[1:33:41] it is the very thoughts of God the
[1:33:43] thoughts of God are power they're real
[1:33:45] they're literal amen amen and those
[1:33:47] thoughts of God has come on the paper
[1:33:49] now from paper into manifestation and
[1:33:52] the manifestation has carries with it
[1:33:54] the very life of God and the Very power
[1:33:56] of God
[1:33:58] this word has been restored it gives us
[1:34:00] the very power
[1:34:02] to become
[1:34:03] what he's called for us to be
[1:34:06] and in the last days there will be a
[1:34:09] real bride
[1:34:10] a true bride
[1:34:12] because it will be he that is true
[1:34:16] has United with her
[1:34:18] because the headship has come down
[1:34:21] and it's him directing her the head has
[1:34:24] connected to the body making this the
[1:34:28] real bride
[1:34:30] the true bride
[1:34:32] I don't want to ever lose sight at what
[1:34:35] makes me a real bride not because I
[1:34:37] recognize him in profit form
[1:34:41] but because he's in my form
[1:34:46] amen I can recognize him in profit form
[1:34:49] and I can recognize and I can recite
[1:34:51] things out of the message and I can
[1:34:52] quote scriptures Galore but what will
[1:34:55] make me a real bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:34:57] when I become a real Temple Tabernacle
[1:35:00] for the almighty God
[1:35:02] when I become a temple of the Living God
[1:35:04] and that full measure of that word is
[1:35:06] poured out and now by that power that's
[1:35:08] been released it's releasing me to live
[1:35:10] whatever that word the life that that
[1:35:12] word calls for both mechanics and
[1:35:14] Dynamics come together to manifest
[1:35:16] Christ that's what makes a real bride
[1:35:19] and that's the only kind of bride I want
[1:35:21] to be
[1:35:23] I don't know about you but I don't want
[1:35:24] to be a semblance of Bride a type of
[1:35:27] bride a partial manifestation of Brian I
[1:35:30] want to be a real bride
[1:35:33] and the challenge of the hour
[1:35:35] it can only be met by a true bride
[1:35:38] God has set it up to where this is the
[1:35:41] hour for the manifestation of the real
[1:35:43] bride
[1:35:44] and it's going to take his life
[1:35:47] unlocked at the opening of the seals
[1:35:50] back in a people
[1:35:52] to manifest himself again it's still him
[1:35:56] in her
[1:35:58] what makes it true because it's still
[1:36:00] him
[1:36:01] the true one
[1:36:03] in her
[1:36:04] what makes you true because he that's
[1:36:07] true is in you
[1:36:09] what makes me true because he that's
[1:36:11] true is in me if I want to be true of
[1:36:14] anything I must get the true that's
[1:36:16] everything in me and then I'll be true
[1:36:18] whatever he's called me to be
[1:36:20] without him we're nothing
[1:36:23] so he that is true has come
[1:36:27] he that is true is here
[1:36:31] he that is true is the true headship
[1:36:33] connected to the true body
[1:36:36] and the life has come down into the body
[1:36:39] and he that is true
[1:36:41] is showing she that is true
[1:36:44] his life in her
[1:36:47] the Bride In Christ must become so one
[1:36:50] that she's living his life and he's
[1:36:53] living through her
[1:36:55] until she becomes him
[1:37:00] the formation Jesus and the formation of
[1:37:04] his bride
[1:37:05] that's the hour that we live in
[1:37:08] a real bride
[1:37:10] a true bride
[1:37:12] and I thank God that I'm alive to see it
[1:37:16] I thank God that the true one is here
[1:37:19] that he's opened the mysteries of the
[1:37:21] Bible that is no longer which
[1:37:23] denomination out of forty thousand do we
[1:37:25] follow who's right who's wrong there's
[1:37:27] no argument anymore the truth is the
[1:37:28] word
[1:37:29] the words been restored through
[1:37:31] prophetic Ministry now we're not groping
[1:37:33] in darkness there's a man here that can
[1:37:35] turn on the light and that man is Christ
[1:37:37] Jesus
[1:37:38] and he's taken up his residence in his
[1:37:41] Temple he has come suddenly to his
[1:37:43] Temple and his Temple is his body and
[1:37:45] his body is his bride
[1:37:48] and now he's here shining the lights
[1:37:52] revelation 22 17 the very end of the
[1:37:56] Bible the last chapter one of the last
[1:37:58] handful of verses said the spirit and
[1:38:01] the bride say come
[1:38:04] that means at the end time there must be
[1:38:07] a bride a true bride a real bride to
[1:38:11] fulfill this scripture at the very end
[1:38:13] of it all that will stand and say come

[1:38:42] when everything is false there's got to
