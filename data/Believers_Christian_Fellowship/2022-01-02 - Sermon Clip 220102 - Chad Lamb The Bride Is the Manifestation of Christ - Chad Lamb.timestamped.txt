[0:00] what is the word bride the manifestation
[0:02] of this hour the bride not a creed or a
[0:04] denomination but a living oracle of god
[0:07] a living attribute of god displaying to
[0:10] the world the attributes of god in the
[0:12] formation of the bride that's to be
[0:14] expressed in this hour that we're now
[0:16] living
[0:18] brother brennan preached this december
[0:20] 5th
[0:20] 1965.
[0:23] he preached this just you know just 20
[0:26] or 19 days before his accident just
[0:29] three four weeks before he passed away
[0:31] this was one of his final final set of
[0:33] messages that he preached and brother
[0:34] branham as he winds down coming to the
[0:36] end of his ministry he is making this
[0:38] point so clear amen he's driving this
[0:41] point home after the seals and he gets
[0:43] into 1965 and he's trying to show you
[0:46] there's not another manifestation the
[0:48] next manifestation will be two witnesses
[0:50] to the jews don't look for that you are
[0:52] the manifestation of christ christ is
[0:54] here in the formation of the bride he
[0:56] has returned in the fullness of the word
[0:58] the headship has united with the bride
[1:01] with the body this body is his body
[1:04] flesh and bones if you want to see
[1:06] christ you must look to the bride
[1:08] because she has to be manifesting christ
[1:12] just like if you wanted to see god you
[1:14] had to look to jesus christ if you want
[1:16] to see christ in this day you must find
[1:19] christ because christ is the anointed
[1:21] word for the day where is the anointed
[1:23] word for the day the anointed word for
[1:25] the day is the capping of the church the
[1:27] finishing of the bride
[1:30] that must be manifest in a people who
[1:32] are the body of jesus christ the
[1:35] habitation of god in the end time
[1:38] so what are we looking for
[1:40] what are we waiting for
[1:42] waiting for something what what's next
[1:45] there is no next friends this is it
[1:50] but i'm looking for the catching away
[1:52] the change in the body this brings the
[1:54] change of the body amen don't sit and
[1:56] wait for something else this word that's
[1:58] been restored that's becoming alive
[2:00] inside of us is changing our bodies amen
[2:04] brother branham said the sid the same
[2:05] spirit was in jesus christ be in you
[2:07] it'll quicken your mortal body and we've
[2:09] looked at that scripture for years as
[2:11] the final quickening and changing of the
[2:13] body but brother benham takes that
[2:14] scripture and says you used to smoke and
[2:16] you don't smoke anymore
[2:19] you used to drink you used to run around
[2:21] you are changing by the same spirit that
[2:25] was in him is quickening your mortal
[2:27] body and it will quicken and quicken and
[2:30] quicken and quicken until the final
[2:32] quickening amen and then you will be
[2:34] translated into another dimension and
[2:36] you will see him as he is
