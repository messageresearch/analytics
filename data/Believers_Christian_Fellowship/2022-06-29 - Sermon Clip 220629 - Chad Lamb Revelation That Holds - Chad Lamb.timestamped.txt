[0:00] sometimes i'm surprised in me
[0:02] at the lingering effects of amnesia
[0:06] i get surprised at my own self how on
[0:09] sunday we remember it all
[0:12] right during the preaching of the word
[0:14] and when brother graham's laying it out
[0:15] you were in god before the foundation of
[0:17] the world you're a part of god you can
[0:19] no more be lost than god can be god and
[0:20] you're amen hallelujah you sound just
[0:22] like you did before the foundation of
[0:24] the world when he showed you the plan of
[0:25] salvation
[0:27] and then monday morning you go to start
[0:29] the car and it won't start and you
[0:30] forgot you're a son of god and you
[0:31] forgot you're in the mind of god and you
[0:33] forgot all things work together for good
[0:38] i hope i'm not the only one because i'm
[0:40] this is very exposing if i'm the only
[0:42] one
[0:44] and all of a sudden we we slip right as
[0:47] soon as it goes click click
[0:50] spiritual amnesia creeps right back in
[0:54] the lingering effects of spiritual
[0:55] amnesia instead of allowing a higher
[0:58] revelation to stop and say god's doing
[1:00] something it's all under control i don't
[1:03] have to fret it's going to be okay
[1:06] and and you know what you don't even
[1:08] have to be a son of god to know it's
[1:09] going to be okay the battery's dead or
[1:11] starters i mean it's going to be fine
[1:14] it's good don't worry
[1:16] it's going to be okay
[1:17] but how quickly we slip in to you know
[1:20] grumbling complaining moaning and
[1:22] groaning and and we went from having the
[1:24] most wonderful existence on this earth
[1:26] on sunday to now our life is miserable
[1:28] nothing ever works out for me and
[1:31] but sunday you were a son of god and
[1:33] then the whole thing plan was
[1:34] orchestrated for you amen
[1:37] and now your car won't start or somebody
[1:38] else got the promotion or there's going
[1:40] to be a layoff and your life never works
[1:42] out it works out for everybody else
[1:43] never works out for me and why doesn't
[1:45] god like me and
[1:50] i said we got to have a higher
[1:52] revelation amen the word that came in
[1:54] this day was to bring us higher than
[1:56] that amen it was to bring us out of that
[1:59] if we can't take that how are we going
[2:01] to take squeeze pressure things binding
[2:03] or are tying up or our brother bram said
[2:06] they'll close your churches amen and
[2:07] they'll prevent the ministers from
[2:09] preaching when i don't know how i don't
[2:11] know for how long i don't know i mean
[2:14] what will we see what we don't see i
[2:16] don't know but how will we ever endure
[2:18] that if we can't take all these little
[2:20] things in our life and cause us to come
[2:22] down from a higher revelation back to
[2:24] carnal thinking back to being
[2:27] troubled and bound by the things of the
[2:29] world amen this message has been given
[2:31] to us was for the eagles to fly higher
[2:34] and in the higher realm all of a sudden
[2:37] everything in the carnal starts coming
[2:38] into perspective
[2:42] and so we have the message to lift us
[2:44] above this amen we've got the word of
[2:46] god to give us a vantage point that the
[2:48] rest of the world doesn't have so that
[2:50] we don't forget who we are so that the
[2:53] lingering effects of spiritual amnesia
[2:55] don't creep back in with every trial in
[2:57] every circumstance so that we can stay
[3:00] sons of god all the time
