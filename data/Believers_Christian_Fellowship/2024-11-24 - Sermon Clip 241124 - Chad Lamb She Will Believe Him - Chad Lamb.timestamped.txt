[0:00] amen so what was brother brenham's
[0:01] Ministry the ministry of Eleazar to call
[0:03] out a bride the question is who's the
[0:06] bride that he called out prise God did
[0:08] you hear
[0:09] him did you hear him amen listen it's
[0:13] not playing tapes you can play tapes and
[0:15] you can hear Doctrine and you can get
[0:17] good teaching that's fine but if you've
[0:19] missed your call and if you missed your
[0:21] name you missed the whole point of
[0:23] Eleazar coming amen Eleazar came to get
[0:26] a bride in the coming to the bride he
[0:28] also had interaction with laben and
[0:30] laan's dad and mom and he gave them
[0:31] gifts and they got all kinds of rewards
[0:33] but only one was the bride and she was
[0:37] the one that followed eleazar's lead and
[0:39] let Eleazar lead her all the way to
[0:42] Isaac to where she was unified with
[0:43] Isaac that's the ministry of our prophet
[0:46] in the end
[0:47] time lord question did we hear what
[0:50] laben heard or did we hear what Rebecca
[0:53] heard
[0:56] God praise be to God
[1:00] listen these things are true and I can't
[1:03] change them I can't change them because
[1:06] they sound extreme I can't change them
[1:07] because they sound uh harsh some are
[1:09] some
[1:10] aren't I can't change that it's the
[1:13] truth it's the truth that she will hear
[1:16] his voice and she will believe him
[1:20] amen oh I'm glad it's true I could have
[1:23] never climbed a ladder I don't care how
[1:26] much assistance you would have given me
[1:27] I would have fallen off I I could have
[1:30] never made my way to bride of Jesus
[1:31] Christ by performing acts and and
[1:33] rituals and and good deeds and Good
[1:35] Conduct I don't care how how how much of
[1:38] a boost you would give me I would have
[1:40] fallen somewhere I would have failed but
[1:42] I had to be just as incapable that
[1:44] little washer woman amen and he would
[1:46] come along and says no Chad it's you I
[1:49] sent a prophet for you I have these
[1:51] tapes for you I came to call you amen
[1:55] and I hope it's for you too amen but
[1:57] what happens to you amen is not going to
[1:59] have be able to to change me it's what I
[2:02] hear about me that changes me and it's
[2:05] not what you hear about me that changes
[2:07] me it's what you hear about you that
[2:08] changes you you have to say you have to
[2:12] hear in the message him saying God
[2:15] himself saying you're my
[2:18] bride amen am so where did you hear that
[2:20] brother Chad what tape I don't know amen
[2:23] I hear it on all the
[2:25] tapes it's like brother benam talked
[2:28] about this word of God Amen and he types
[2:30] it with a mirror Amen in the mirror
[2:32] where the little boy was born in the
[2:33] country and he comes to the city to his
[2:35] aunt's great house never seen himself in
[2:37] the mirror and he walks up the steps and
[2:39] he sees a little boy and he waves and
[2:40] the boy waves he pulls his ear the boy
[2:42] pulls his ear and finally he realizes
[2:44] what I'm seeing is me that's a
[2:47] reflection of me and he said Mama that's
[2:49] me and that's what brother Ram types
[2:51] with this word of God Amen it's
[2:53] reflecting me when brother R talks about
[2:55] a bride he's talking about
[2:57] me I got to go beyond him talking about
[3:00] there's a global bride and these other
[3:01] people and they're probably in it but
[3:03] I'm probably not in it amen if that's
[3:05] the way you're thinking you're never
[3:07] going to make it amen
[3:10] never it's going to take a revelation
[3:12] that says I'm not worthy I'm not able I
[3:16] am just like that washer woman I can't
[3:18] do a thing to even help myself I don't
[3:20] know why he would want
[3:22] me cuz I have nothing to offer
[3:26] him but I can't help it I I heard my
[3:31] name I just can't help it something
[3:33] inside me goes ding ding
[3:36] ding I can't help it I I can't I can't
[3:40] make it logical I can't do any I just
[3:43] can't help it I
[3:46] believe I believe
