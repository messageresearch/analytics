[9:09] oh Heavenly Father we love you Lord
[9:12] our longing Lord is to express our love
[9:15] to you
[9:17] and Lord we know we know because your
[9:19] word says that we love you because you
[9:22] first loved us
[9:24] Lord and what our desire is to sing your
[9:26] praises and to glorify your name and to
[9:28] be pleasing to you in every way
[9:30] but as we come to this service Lord I
[9:33] pray that you would break the bread of
[9:35] life for your waiting children that you
[9:37] would feed us by your own hand Lord we
[9:40] come to hear from you Lord and to
[9:42] commune with you
[9:43] pray God you would take preeminence Lord
[9:45] over the gift that you would speak Lord
[9:48] that you would have your way in every
[9:50] heart and every life that we would feed
[9:52] on your word and receive it as a portion
[9:55] we need for this hour may you take
[9:57] preeminence in our lives Lord and live
[10:00] your life through us may we be a
[10:02] manifestation of you upon this Earth
[10:04] Lord by your grace while we surrender to
[10:07] afresh
[10:08] we give all things unto you and ask that
[10:10] you would take all things into your hand
[10:13] and Jesus Christ's name we pray
[10:15] amen
[10:17] God bless you while you're standing
[10:19] let's take our Bibles in turn to mark
[10:21] chapter 11.
[10:23] and while you're turning there I just
[10:25] want to remind you that Brother Kyle and
[10:27] I will be leaving for the Philippines in
[10:29] the morning we leave quite early in the
[10:31] morning and we'll be returning on
[10:32] Tuesday the 14th so please keep us in
[10:36] our prayer in your prayers we appreciate
[10:37] that they can send us an itinerary today
[10:39] and there's quite a few Services we'll
[10:41] be actually in the Philippines for
[10:43] somewhere around 10 to 11 days and
[10:46] between the two of us I think we have 10
[10:47] or 11 services so we really appreciate
[10:50] your prayers while I'm gone that first
[10:52] Sunday and Wednesday Brother David Dean
[10:54] Hart will be ministering and then the
[10:56] second Sunday on the 12th brother Burley
[10:58] Williams will be ministering also want
[11:00] to remind you there won't be a second
[11:01] service this Sunday there'll be no
[11:03] communion and so pray for these brothers
[11:05] as well
[11:07] remember our families as well and we'll
[11:09] be remembering you and praying for you
[11:11] as well also it's a great pleasure I get
[11:14] to announce to you that after the
[11:15] service today we'll be having a baptism
[11:18] young Derek Siebert would like to be
[11:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:22] Christ so we're very excited for him and
[11:24] for his family and for what the Lord's
[11:26] doing in his in his life
[11:28] amen
[11:30] amen while we're standing let's look at
[11:32] at Mark chapter 11.
[11:34] we'll go to verse 22 and begin there
[11:41] and Jesus answered
[11:43] Jesus answering saith unto them have
[11:46] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[11:49] that whosoever shall say unto this
[11:51] mountain be thou removed and cast into
[11:53] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[11:55] but shall believe that those things
[11:57] which he saith shall come to pass he
[12:00] shall have whatsoever he saith
[12:03] amen God bless you as you take your
[12:05] seeds
[12:08] man this is a interesting scripture and
[12:12] I just want to springboard from here and
[12:14] use it as a foundation to get into my
[12:16] subject and and I just want to look at
[12:18] this for a minute
[12:20] uh he says in verse 23 for verily I say
[12:23] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[12:25] this mountain be thou removed and be
[12:26] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[12:29] his heart
[12:30] so he can't be guessing
[12:33] there's no hoping that this will work
[12:35] out he cannot doubt in his heart but
[12:38] shall believe that those things which he
[12:41] saith shall come to pass
[12:43] he shall have whatsoever he saith so
[12:45] look at the conditions Jesus bases this
[12:48] on he says first of all you can say
[12:51] these things if you have no doubt in
[12:53] your heart
[12:54] and if you already know that the things
[12:57] you say will come to pass this can't be
[12:59] a speaking and seeing if it will happen
[13:02] then it won't work amen that this will
[13:05] not work it will only work if there's no
[13:07] doubt in your heart and that you know
[13:09] that the things that you say shall come
[13:11] to pass
[13:13] amen so we're going to get into this a
[13:15] little bit I just want you to hold on to
[13:16] that amen and and I want to minister
[13:19] tonight for a title I want to take
[13:20] character for the third pool so there's
[13:23] something I want to get into but I'm
[13:24] going to start off talking about the
[13:26] third pool and the spoken word and the
[13:28] manifestation of the third pool and I'm
[13:30] just going to uh go into some of the
[13:32] things brother Branham said and I'm
[13:34] going to start here with Look Away to
[13:36] Jesus in December of 1963. so what I'm
[13:40] I'm going into first is the third pool
[13:42] and what brother Branham said then I
[13:43] want to go into my subject character for
[13:46] the third poem
[13:47] amen so I'm going to read a few quotes
[13:50] here so stay stay tuned in don't tune
[13:52] out stay tuned in
[13:54] amen when you look at the top of my
[13:57] shiny bald head because I'm reading
[13:58] doesn't mean it's time for to be
[13:59] distracted and for your mind to wonder
[14:01] listen to what I'm saying
[14:03] amen Look Away to Jesus he says now I'm
[14:06] going to say something to you now that I
[14:08] haven't said all along and that is the
[14:10] thing that we've have looked forward to
[14:12] for so long for at least many years four
[14:14] or five years or maybe longer the third
[14:16] pool has now been Vindicated and I'm
[14:19] sure you all know what it is now
[14:21] remember there'll never be an
[14:22] impersonation of that because it can't
[14:24] be see it cannot be now it's in
[14:27] existence and I am warned of this that
[14:30] soon right at this time now it just
[14:32] happens so it could identify its
[14:34] presence among you see but it will not
[14:36] be used in a great way until this
[14:38] Council begins to tighten up so he
[14:41] begins to explain some things here he
[14:43] explains why this manifestation of the
[14:46] third pool or as he'll explain it later
[14:47] the spoken word has the reason that it's
[14:51] come on the scene and the reason has
[14:53] been displayed is what brother Branham
[14:55] says is so that it could identify its
[14:58] presence among you amen but it really
[15:01] wasn't intended till a future date but
[15:04] gone and listen I'll I'll just say this
[15:07] in my own words in my own way of
[15:09] explaining things and and God had to
[15:12] show it first
[15:14] and so it's coming but there has to be
[15:17] some conditions first
[15:18] Matt all right so this is what brother
[15:21] Brandon says now it it
[15:24] right at this time now it just happened
[15:26] so it could identify its presence among
[15:29] you see but it will not be used in a
[15:31] great way until the council begins to
[15:32] tighten up so he's saying God showed it
[15:34] to you so he could identify its presence
[15:36] so you'd see it but it's really not
[15:38] intended for now it's intended for
[15:40] another time
[15:42] when the council begins to tighten up
[15:44] and when it does the Pentecostals and so
[15:47] forth can almost impersonate anything
[15:49] can be done but when that time comes
[15:51] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[15:53] see what you've seen temporarily be
[15:56] manifest in the fullness of its power
[15:58] so you see my my thought here God had to
[16:01] show it so it could identify its
[16:03] presence so we know it's here but it's
[16:05] not intended to be used or will not be
[16:07] used in a great way till the council
[16:08] tightens up
[16:10] and then when the squeeze comes down
[16:12] then you'll see what you've seen
[16:13] temporarily now show itself manifesting
[16:16] the fullness of its power
[16:18] all right
[16:19] then another quote a little further down
[16:21] and looking away look away to Jesus says
[16:23] now I must continue in evangelism just
[16:25] as I was commissioned first I must
[16:27] continue on therefore you've had the
[16:29] word and you know what to look for how
[16:32] to stand I must continue on in
[16:34] evangelism and friends of mine keep
[16:35] still and just keep moving on for the
[16:39] hours approaching swiftly see that when
[16:41] something is going to be done
[16:43] Brother Bear never wanted us to stop he
[16:45] wanted to keep moving forward
[16:48] he said keep still and just keep moving
[16:49] on
[16:51] keep still and keep moving on
[16:53] it's amazing what he means is don't
[16:56] chase after nothing just keep still and
[16:58] keep moving on in the word
[17:00] this is at least my understanding of it
[17:03] now he says now you might see some
[17:05] little odd things happen happen for me
[17:07] nothing sinful I don't mean that but I
[17:09] mean something odd to what the regular
[17:10] Trend because where I reach to now in
[17:13] the ministry I'm dropping back here
[17:15] watching that spot and waiting for the
[17:18] time to use it but it's going to be used
[17:20] so again brother Ben was telling us it's
[17:23] really not for now it's for another time
[17:24] but it had to identify itself among you
[17:27] amen but when this other thing happens
[17:28] then what you've seen temporarily will
[17:30] be manifest in the fullness of the power
[17:31] and I'm dropping back waiting because
[17:33] where I've got to in the ministry I
[17:35] can't go any farther I've got to wait
[17:38] for something else to happen
[17:42] are we are we together
[17:45] okay
[17:47] so
[17:48] I'm watching that spot and waiting for
[17:51] the time to use it but it's going to be
[17:53] used
[17:56] and everyone knows that for as certain
[17:58] as the first was identified so is the
[18:00] second been identified and if you'll
[18:02] think real closely you who are spiritual
[18:04] as the Bible said here is to him that
[18:06] has wisdom the third is properly
[18:08] identified see we know where it is so
[18:10] the third pool is here
[18:13] so we're not looking for anything
[18:15] because the third pool's already here it
[18:18] identified itself Among Us amen so that
[18:20] we would have confidence to wait until
[18:22] this other thing catches up
[18:25] brother random was he was he was he was
[18:28] here as a forerunner he was also here
[18:30] amen displaying what was going to to
[18:33] transpire he was the first part of the
[18:35] Harvest amen within him the word came to
[18:38] maturity amen and began to display what
[18:41] it's like to have a an adopted son of
[18:43] God a mature son and daughter of God on
[18:45] the scene and he was foreshadowing the
[18:47] rest of the crop
[18:49] and he displayed amen what he calls the
[18:52] spoken word that's part of the third
[18:53] pool amen and said that now I've gone as
[18:57] far in the ministry as I can go now I've
[18:59] got to wait for this thing to catch up
[19:01] because he knows he had to forerun and
[19:04] he had to go and show what's coming and
[19:06] then wait amen for something else to
[19:09] catch up
[19:13] and so uh
[19:15] I just wanna I wanna take a diversion I
[19:17] want to drop a couple quotes in here
[19:19] from 1965 because I don't want anybody
[19:21] amen sitting in their seat thinking but
[19:23] brother Chad he also said
[19:25] so
[19:27] let's read it now I know anyone's at the
[19:29] end time notice the very day when this
[19:31] messenger not when he starts on but when
[19:33] he begins to declare his message
[19:36] and his message is revelation 10 1-7 the
[19:39] seven Thunders the opening of The Seven
[19:40] Seals
[19:42] when he's not when he starts on but when
[19:44] he begins to declare his message see the
[19:46] first pool healing second pull prophesy
[19:48] the third pull the opening of the word
[19:51] the Mysteries revealed so the third pull
[19:53] is the opening of the word but brother
[19:55] Branham also ties the third pull to the
[19:58] spoken word that was done five times in
[20:00] the creating of the squirrels twice amen
[20:02] speaking to Hattie writes two boys
[20:04] speaking to the Storm Into the tumor of
[20:06] his wife he also attaches it to that and
[20:08] calls it the spoken word
[20:11] so the third pool is the opening of the
[20:13] word the Mysteries revealed no more
[20:15] there is no more higher order to reveal
[20:17] the word than prophets but the only way
[20:19] the prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[20:20] word and remember the third pool was the
[20:23] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[20:25] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[20:28] the word
[20:29] all right
[20:31] this is this to me is really important
[20:34] because he shows that the the the the
[20:36] the third pool is the opening of the
[20:38] word but there's also another aspect
[20:40] amen that's the spoken word amen and and
[20:43] you begin to realize what was laying
[20:46] under those seals what what was uh the
[20:49] opening of the seals and we begin to see
[20:52] that that the opening of the seals was
[20:54] unlocking the mystery that was in the
[20:56] back part of God's mind that he had kept
[20:58] with himself since before the foundation
[21:00] of the world and when he unlocked the
[21:03] mystery of himself it really it if I
[21:06] could say it this way uh the important
[21:08] thing in there was not the information
[21:10] that was released but the great hidden
[21:12] revelation that was released and the
[21:14] great hidden revelation amen was one
[21:16] that would bring a people into position
[21:18] and an understanding of who they really
[21:20] are
[21:21] and they would begin to understand that
[21:23] they are actually part of Christ amen
[21:26] that they were foreordained in the
[21:27] thoughts of God and they they possess
[21:30] within themselves a see Gene of God they
[21:33] were an attribute of God before the
[21:35] foundation of the world and they've been
[21:36] placed here in time to play the part
[21:38] amen of the bride and it will be Christ
[21:40] coming in the formation of his bride to
[21:42] manifest himself so under those seals
[21:45] broke away so much misunderstanding so
[21:48] that the people would finally understand
[21:50] who they are
[21:53] that's what the opening of the word did
[21:56] for a people on the Earth
[21:58] because the opening of the word couldn't
[22:00] do that for the generations that have
[22:02] passed on Amen they they lived their
[22:04] life under the portion that was allotted
[22:06] to them but it's for the people who are
[22:08] here at the end time amen the seals open
[22:11] and it took the seals off the off of our
[22:13] life
[22:15] all right
[22:17] so
[22:18] if we go back to our opening scripture
[22:22] that if there is going to be a
[22:25] manifestation of the third pool as a
[22:27] spoken word as it was in brother
[22:29] bantam's life
[22:31] then you have to be able to speak
[22:34] something without doubting it in your
[22:36] heart
[22:38] and knowing that what you're about to
[22:42] say will come to pass before you say it
[22:44] not not waiting until it comes to pass
[22:47] and then go tell everybody what happened
[22:50] no but you're the kind of faith that you
[22:53] have to go to for this operation is
[22:55] where there is no doubt in the heart
[22:58] and that you already know that it'll
[23:00] happen before spoken
[23:03] now how are you ever even capable of
[23:05] that under denominationalism when you're
[23:07] not sure if you're saved or not or if
[23:09] you're a child of God or not or if
[23:11] you're if you failed yesterday if you've
[23:12] got to go to the Altar and repent if you
[23:14] haven't repented am I saved that was
[23:15] Pentecostal doctor and I grew up in
[23:18] that if you sinned and died and didn't
[23:19] have a chance to repent you would be
[23:20] lost and go to hell how would you have
[23:22] this kind of faith if you don't know who
[23:24] you are amen but if you know who you are
[23:27] and that you come from God and you go
[23:29] back to God Amen and there there is
[23:31] something from God Amen attributed to
[23:34] you that you're containing and bottling
[23:35] confining amen the uh habitating God in
[23:39] some way in some measure then all of a
[23:42] sudden everything becomes possible
[23:46] that's why the third pool is the opening
[23:49] of the word and has an aspect of the
[23:52] spoken word
[23:54] attached to it
[23:58] now in the message what is the
[24:00] attraction on the mountain
[24:02] he says I heard her voice say that's the
[24:05] king sword and this is where brother
[24:06] Barnes and Sabino Canyon his hands are
[24:08] open the sword strikes his hand
[24:10] I said a king Knights a man with a sword
[24:12] and the voice came back said not a king
[24:14] sword but the king sword the word of the
[24:16] Lord said fear not it's only the third
[24:19] pool it's the Vindication of your
[24:21] ministry so the third pool was the sword
[24:23] in the hand what's the third in the hand
[24:25] it's it's the sword of the king which is
[24:28] the word of God
[24:30] placed in his hands
[24:34] so it's the word in his hands
[24:36] now remember amen when you go to
[24:38] Revelation 10 1-7 and you get to the
[24:41] seven Thunder seven Thunders under their
[24:43] voices and John was told right at night
[24:45] so there was a portion of scripture that
[24:46] wasn't written amen amen not even in
[24:49] symbol form brother Branham says and so
[24:51] now there has to be a word given into
[24:54] the hand of the Prophet Amen in the in
[24:56] the third pool is the opening of the
[24:58] word because it was locked in a mystery
[25:01] because John was told not to write it so
[25:03] it was sealed in the Bible as an
[25:06] Unwritten word amen although it was
[25:08] declared and typed throughout the Bible
[25:10] it was sealed as an Unwritten word and
[25:13] so now God has to be able to give that
[25:16] Unwritten word amen what John saw but
[25:19] didn't right he has to be able to give
[25:21] it to somebody so that sword has to come
[25:23] into somebody's hand
[25:25] so it comes into the prophetan and
[25:27] brother banham every day comes and takes
[25:30] zero credit whatsoever for the opening
[25:33] of a seal he says I was I know no more
[25:35] about it than anything I was just as
[25:37] lost as anybody I was reading other
[25:39] men's books and thought that they had it
[25:41] pretty good amen until he came till that
[25:43] angel came amen and brother Branham says
[25:46] he saw it as a vision
[25:48] so remember John Saul he heard the seven
[25:52] Thunders and he was told to write
[25:54] whatever he hears and whatever he sees
[25:56] now brother Branham is seeing in a
[25:58] vision the unfolding of a seal and he's
[26:00] just grabbing a paper and writing it
[26:02] down as it unfolds then he spends the
[26:04] rest of the day going back and tracing
[26:06] it through the scriptures
[26:09] that's why he comes to the end of the
[26:10] seals and says don't say thank you to
[26:12] any man
[26:15] he goes no man had anything to do with
[26:17] this this was none other than Jesus
[26:20] Christ himself giving the revelation of
[26:22] that mystery word
[26:24] so what Brethren could take zero credit
[26:28] for the opening of those seals he just
[26:30] saw it unfold day by day and as he saw
[26:33] it unfold he grabbed a pin and wrote it
[26:35] down and then spent the rest of the day
[26:37] tracing it out then he would come and
[26:39] preach at that night
[26:41] so you see the sword was placed in his
[26:43] hand
[26:44] it was the opening of the word now the
[26:47] word was given to him and now as he was
[26:50] speaking the unwritten part he had the
[26:53] spoken word
[26:55] that's how we have that's how we have
[26:58] the revelation of the seven Thunders is
[27:00] because he spoke it
[27:02] how did God give us the revelation of
[27:05] seven Thunders through that man's mouth
[27:09] so the third pool is the opening of the
[27:11] word
[27:13] amen
[27:14] now I want to go back to look away to
[27:16] Jesus because I want to tithe I wanted
[27:18] to make sure we tie these things to do
[27:20] things together the opening of the word
[27:21] and the spoken word as in this and the
[27:25] signs
[27:27] now back to look away to Jesus he says
[27:29] it's so sacred that I mustn't say much
[27:31] about it as he told me in the beginning
[27:34] this say nothing of it you remember
[27:36] years ago it speaks for itself
[27:40] I've tried to explain the others and I
[27:42] made a mistake this will be the thing to
[27:43] my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me
[27:45] this this will be the thing that will
[27:47] start the rapturing faith for the going
[27:49] away
[27:51] I must lay quiet for a little while now
[27:54] remember and who is listening to this
[27:56] tape you might see such a change in my
[27:58] ministry right away dropping back not
[28:00] going up dropping back we're right at
[28:03] the age now and it can't be can't go any
[28:06] further we have to wait just a minute
[28:08] until this happens over here to catch up
[28:11] then the time comes what's he waiting
[28:14] for the Council of churches the
[28:16] tightening up the squeeze
[28:18] is that right is that what he said
[28:21] now we have to wait a minute till this
[28:23] happens over here to catch up then the
[28:24] time comes but it's thoroughly
[28:26] identified there is coming a Time upon
[28:29] the in this nation to where the nation
[28:31] is going to exercise all the power that
[28:33] the Beast had before him which was Pagan
[28:35] Rome when it become papal room see that
[28:38] this nation will do that
[28:40] so he starts talking about the
[28:41] tightening up the squeeze he starts
[28:43] talking he goes right into Revelation 13
[28:45] amen and the Beast and so he's tying all
[28:48] of this together
[28:51] then a little further down and look away
[28:52] to Jesus he says it's tightening and
[28:55] then when that time comes and the Press
[28:57] comes to a place where you're pressed
[28:59] out then watch what I'm fixing to tell
[29:02] you in a few minutes watch the third
[29:03] pull then
[29:05] it'll be absolutely to the total lost
[29:08] but it will be for the bride and the
[29:10] church
[29:13] in the message shalom in the beginning
[29:15] of 1964 this is just the next month it's
[29:18] just like two weeks later
[29:20] he says and we all know that that's the
[29:23] identification we know what the third
[29:24] pool is we we all understand that now
[29:27] you got you all have to the tape and I
[29:30] think it'll just lay dormant for a
[29:32] little while until the great hour of
[29:34] persecution comes on
[29:36] that's when it be it'll speak it'll be
[29:39] manifested just like the five straight
[29:41] signs without failure squirrels twice
[29:43] had he writes boys speaking to the storm
[29:46] in Colorado into his wife's tumor
[29:49] it'll be manifest just like the five
[29:50] straight signs without failure perfectly
[29:52] and now I think just wait see to see
[29:55] what it done
[29:57] so it's amazing
[30:00] now I want to say this
[30:03] if you want me to tell you what it's
[30:05] going to be like I have no idea
[30:08] you want me to tell you exactly what he
[30:10] meant by what he said I can't
[30:12] but I know what he said to be true
[30:15] and I know it'll take care of itself
[30:19] okay
[30:21] there's been so much speculation about
[30:23] these things
[30:25] so many ideas and guess what I have my
[30:27] own ideas
[30:28] I have my own speculations and we've sit
[30:30] around table it's fun to talk about but
[30:32] when you really try to pin down what's
[30:34] going to happen what's a sequence event
[30:36] what's when this will happen and that
[30:37] will happen listen there's no way to
[30:39] figure this out because nothing ever
[30:41] happens the way we think it's going to
[30:43] happen if you look in the Bible the
[30:44] Fulfillment of every prophecy always
[30:46] came in an unusual way and never came
[30:49] the way people expected it so don't
[30:51] already have an idea one thing's for
[30:53] sure when it's time it will happen
[30:57] amen
[30:59] brother Brown says in the message shalom
[31:02] we heard the word say that in the days
[31:04] of the seventh angel in the church age
[31:06] he just said the seventh Angel's message
[31:07] would be the last message
[31:09] and then we find out over here in
[31:12] Revelation 10 and the days of the
[31:13] message of the seventh angel the
[31:15] mysteries of God should be finished the
[31:17] seventh seal would be pulled back it
[31:19] should be there then all at once when it
[31:21] happened a vision broke said go to
[31:23] Tucson a great noise will take place at
[31:25] this time so you'll be thoroughly
[31:27] understanding and know that it's sin
[31:29] it'll shake the Earth nearly all of you
[31:32] know about it it's on tape months before
[31:33] it happened then it happened then
[31:35] appeared in the sky Shalom what is it
[31:38] it's a changing beats the sympathy
[31:41] he's referring to a sympathy or
[31:43] something I'm sorry a symphony
[31:45] then one time he said about the third
[31:47] pool how it would come by this one way
[31:50] then by knowing the heart and then the
[31:53] spoken word so now you say he's going to
[31:55] the third pool and he's attaching it to
[31:57] the spoken word are these signs where he
[31:59] spoke to squirrels into existence in
[32:01] these things so he says one time he said
[32:03] about the third poll how would come by
[32:05] this one way then by knowing the heart
[32:07] so first by taking them by the hand then
[32:10] by knowing the heart through a gift of
[32:12] discernment and and then the spoken word
[32:16] I skipped a paragraph and he comes to
[32:18] the next one when we hear the sympathy
[32:20] beating changing fixing to change it's a
[32:22] junction time we notice as he begin to
[32:25] beat and we've seen the works that I do
[32:27] shall you do also and greater shall you
[32:29] do greater he promised it we wondered
[32:32] how it could be now remember brother
[32:35] Benham used to always say Greater Works
[32:37] he said greater because now that was
[32:39] done in one person that'll be done in
[32:41] the whole body it'll be more works
[32:44] he said that but now he's going to say
[32:46] something a little different about the
[32:48] Greater Works
[32:50] all right
[32:51] he says now Greater Works greater he
[32:54] promised we wondered how it could be how
[32:56] could you do Greater Works
[32:59] but did you notice when he performed his
[33:01] first miracle he took water and turned
[33:03] it into wine is that right he took water
[33:05] which potentially someday might have
[33:07] been wine but it was water first and
[33:10] when he fed five thousand what did he do
[33:12] he took something that had been like
[33:14] water he took fish that once swam and
[33:16] was born from an egg and he broke it and
[33:17] another fish growed into into the
[33:19] creation that was the original creation
[33:21] he took bread that was once wheat and
[33:23] was a seed and became bread and he broke
[33:25] from this bread and the creation only
[33:28] multiplied but in the woods there was
[33:31] nothing there to make a squirrel yeah
[33:34] now he's showing something about the
[33:36] Greater Works
[33:38] in the woods there was nothing there to
[33:40] make a squirrel now listen to what he
[33:42] says the next statement let there be
[33:46] where does that take you in the
[33:48] scriptures
[33:49] back to Genesis
[33:51] who said let there be God himself
[33:55] and what did he do he made in the
[33:58] beginning he made something all things
[34:01] were made out of things that you do not
[34:03] see out of things that don't exist
[34:06] so brother Brown ties this right back to
[34:09] the very beginning when God created the
[34:11] world
[34:15] amen he said let there be and there was
[34:17] without anything to break it from
[34:20] what is it the same Jesus Christ
[34:23] now brother man now just listen he said
[34:26] the same Jesus Christ he never pointed
[34:28] to himself
[34:31] these words came out of his lips
[34:34] but he never once took credit for the
[34:37] creation of squirrels
[34:39] for the moving of a storm for the
[34:41] healing of his wife's tumor for the
[34:43] Salvation of how he writes two boys
[34:47] so if brother Branham could create
[34:49] squirrels then it was brother Branham
[34:50] who saved those two boys but no man can
[34:52] save no sin-born man can save anybody
[34:54] else they're only saved by Jesus Christ
[34:58] so Brethren never takes credit for any
[35:01] of this even though it was his lips that
[35:04] spoke the words
[35:08] see greater things than this will you do
[35:10] for I go to my father not taking
[35:13] something that's been created breaking
[35:15] something from it and multiplying
[35:16] creation but absolutely create
[35:20] showing that he's the same Jehovah that
[35:23] stood back there and said let there be
[35:24] and there was his word was made manifest
[35:27] when he was made Flesh on Earth he took
[35:29] his original creation broke it back and
[35:31] multiplied it but now in the last days
[35:34] when he comes down Among Us the same
[35:37] light that moved down said let there be
[35:39] light see he just speak the creation
[35:41] into existence greater than this will
[35:44] you do for I go to my father remember
[35:45] we're at these times
[35:51] remember the opening of the seals
[35:55] revealed in Revelation 10 7 it revealed
[35:59] the mystery of God
[36:01] and was what was the great mystery of
[36:03] God what the great mystery of God is
[36:05] that God wanted to dwell in flesh in
[36:07] humankind in his family he wanted to
[36:10] portion himself out into his creation
[36:13] and now now brother Ben I'm standing
[36:15] here with part of the third pull the
[36:17] spoken word part and he's not he's not
[36:20] even manifesting creation like Jesus did
[36:23] when he was here by taking something
[36:25] that was made breaking it and more
[36:27] coming he said there was no there was
[36:29] nothing there to make a squirrel with
[36:31] but he spoke and it was the same as the
[36:33] creation in the beginning
[36:36] and he can say this because he knows he
[36:39] didn't do it
[36:41] like if he had any inkling that he did
[36:43] it there's no way he could stand before
[36:45] a crowd of people and say something like
[36:46] that but it wasn't him he said it's the
[36:49] same Jesus Christ it's the same Jehovah
[36:51] that said it there he's the same one
[36:53] that's Among Us he's doing it now
[36:57] but what was God the great mystery the
[36:59] great mystery that was God wanted to
[37:01] dwell with man God wanted to take on
[37:03] flesh he wanted to dwell upon the Earth
[37:05] and now he's doing and a redeemed Son of
[37:08] God Amen something that he did before
[37:11] the foundation of the world
[37:13] what a display that's been in our day
[37:17] what a display
[37:21] so now we come to uh questions and
[37:24] answers
[37:25] 1964 August of 1964 questions and
[37:29] answers
[37:30] and somebody said now this the third
[37:32] pool and is speaking the word it seems
[37:35] entirely possible for you to speak the
[37:37] word and one would be completely and
[37:39] fully restored placed entirely ready for
[37:41] the Rapture in the Resurrection The Son
[37:43] of Man
[37:45] this is so or is it not and you would do
[37:48] this if properly pressed upon would you
[37:49] not escaping all these things
[37:52] Escape all these things and stand before
[37:54] the son of man Luke 21 36. so this is
[37:57] the question the question brother Benham
[37:59] is now that the third pool is speaking
[38:01] the word it seems entirely possible that
[38:04] you could speak the word and one another
[38:06] person would be completely fully
[38:09] restored placed entirely ready for the
[38:11] Rapture in the Resurrection The Son of
[38:12] Man
[38:14] he's saying now that this has been
[38:16] manifest you could speak somebody and
[38:18] they could be Rapture Ready fully
[38:20] complete the son of man
[38:22] here's brother Bam's answer
[38:24] now my dear friends see now I think here
[38:27] that you you got you got a good
[38:29] statement yes sir yes sir he's agreeing
[38:34] that blows me away
[38:37] now that would be so
[38:39] he says that's true
[38:41] you said brother brennaman other words
[38:43] here what I I don't think that's I
[38:46] believe not polishing up what you said
[38:47] but I believe I can make it a little
[38:49] clearer to the people
[38:51] you are believing because of the spoken
[38:53] words and things like that that he said
[38:56] about and all of you here witnessed the
[38:58] squirrels and all those other things
[38:59] that's been done but did you notice that
[39:02] was sovereignly given
[39:05] I never asked him Lord let me do this
[39:08] speak these things in that do these
[39:10] things there I never asked him that he
[39:13] by his own Divine will came to me and
[39:16] said you go do this
[39:20] now remember let's go back to Mark 11
[39:24] and 23 when he says if you say to this
[39:28] mountain I'm going to read it to you for
[39:29] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[39:31] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[39:33] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[39:35] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[39:37] shall believe that those things which he
[39:39] says shall come to pass he shall have
[39:41] whatsoever he saith
[39:43] now brother Branham when he creates
[39:45] those squirrels he says I I was
[39:48] wondering about this scripture
[39:50] this was the scripture on his mind and
[39:53] he couldn't solve it out he couldn't
[39:54] figure it out and he was curious about
[39:56] that scripture and while he was musing
[39:59] over that scripture God came to him and
[40:02] told him to speak and and whatever you
[40:04] say will come to pass and he says well
[40:06] you know I don't know what to say and he
[40:08] says what do you need and he says you're
[40:10] hunting I mean God Is So leading him
[40:13] along
[40:14] he didn't even know what to ask for he
[40:16] said he's he's not planning for this
[40:18] he's not looking for this he's not
[40:21] desperately praying to God he's not
[40:22] fasting and praying he's not trying to
[40:24] make something happen he's out in the
[40:26] woods musing over a scripture God comes
[40:28] to him at the appointed time and begins
[40:30] to speak to him and tell him what to say
[40:32] and if God comes you to that way it's
[40:34] not hard to have no doubt in your heart
[40:36] and believe that what you say will come
[40:38] to pass
[40:39] because there is nothing that he
[40:41] conjured up nothing of his own thinking
[40:43] it wasn't part of his faculties at all
[40:46] amen it was come from God and then God
[40:48] was going to use his faculties Amen to
[40:51] speak the word and then God was going to
[40:53] make it happen
[40:57] there's such a lesson here
[41:00] because brother Branham had no control
[41:02] over it
[41:04] he didn't ask for it
[41:06] he couldn't make it happen
[41:09] all he could do was keep trusting in The
[41:11] Lord of walking the Lord walking
[41:12] obedience to his word and whenever God
[41:14] wanted God would inject himself and
[41:16] begin to speak to him and he says those
[41:18] things were sovereignly given
[41:24] amen amen
[41:25] so whatever idea we have about
[41:28] manifestations of the third pool and
[41:30] spoken word and tightening up and all
[41:32] these things whatever idea we have about
[41:34] that we need to get out of our mind
[41:37] that it's going to come from us as in
[41:41] our idea our thinking our will
[41:45] if God showed it to us so we would see
[41:49] it identified clearly
[41:51] and then he would allow a prophet to
[41:53] explain how those things transpired
[41:55] then I think we should just stay in that
[41:57] pattern
[42:00] so much foolishness would be averted if
[42:03] man left himself out of things and quit
[42:05] trying to work something up and get and
[42:08] work something in and get all worked up
[42:10] and make something happen and believe
[42:12] that he's got the faith to pull
[42:13] something down and the faith to pull
[42:14] something up listen whatever we need God
[42:17] will give to us if you're the Bride of
[42:19] Jesus Christ amen you're not going to
[42:21] miss anything you're not going to miss
[42:22] out on anything if you've got confidence
[42:25] and who's called you you've got
[42:26] confidence in who you are if the seals
[42:28] of your life have been peeled back and
[42:30] you have a recognition Within You by
[42:32] faith that by by the grace of God that
[42:34] you came from God and you're going to
[42:35] God you don't have to worry about
[42:37] missing any manifestation or trying to
[42:40] prove anything by a manifestation
[42:43] amen
[42:47] praise God
[42:49] so sometimes people's ideas of the
[42:54] manifestation of the third pole and
[42:55] spoken word frighten me
[42:57] because you can see it's just something
[42:59] they want to do
[43:03] and it's almost like used in Vengeance
[43:06] you know
[43:07] when when they tighten up and come
[43:09] against us we'll say
[43:11] I don't think that's the right nature
[43:15] I don't think that's what God's looking
[43:17] for
[43:20] in the
[43:23] in the message thy house
[43:25] my brother Ben preached in 1961. it says
[43:28] as I said the other day when we're born
[43:30] of the spirit of God God isn't weak in
[43:32] one place and strong in another if
[43:34] you've got a little shadow of God and
[43:35] you're just a little speck of God then
[43:37] you got all power you got enough power
[43:40] in you to make a world and go out and
[43:41] live in it we spoke of this on Sunday
[43:44] but of course that power is controlled
[43:47] by faith
[43:49] if it wasn't we'd all have us a world
[43:51] out there living in it but if you're a
[43:53] Son of God or a daughter of God you've
[43:55] got the power of God in you amen so then
[43:58] that law holds that Faith to a certain
[44:01] thing
[44:03] so listen you've got the power in you
[44:05] now to do it
[44:07] so go do it
[44:10] it's in you now do you believe this in
[44:12] you now
[44:13] if you believe it's in you now show it
[44:15] to me
[44:16] oh you see the trick of the devil
[44:18] he tried that with Jesus and Jesus never
[44:21] took the bait if thou be the Son of God
[44:23] if thou be the Son of God and all he did
[44:25] was answer back with the word and he
[44:27] never took the bait because he didn't
[44:28] have anything to prove
[44:30] amen and the best thing to do is be
[44:32] insecure in who God made you and don't
[44:34] have anything to prove because it'll
[44:35] push us into fanaticism the very minute
[44:39] we have to have a manifestation to prove
[44:41] who we are or we want to show somebody
[44:42] something or or we want something tacked
[44:45] to our name as a Vindication of our
[44:46] ministry or or that we're a bride or or
[44:48] we're more bride than this one's bride
[44:50] the very minute you go down that you're
[44:52] going to fall into a trap amen because
[44:54] that's not how it works
[44:57] because the minute the gifts are used
[45:00] and the minute anything else is used for
[45:02] self then it's wrong
[45:05] remember Jesus only did that which the
[45:07] father showed him
[45:09] he didn't do it on his own amen it
[45:11] wasn't his own idea it was in his own
[45:13] desire remember when he walked by the
[45:15] pool of this Bethesda he had to tip to
[45:17] around Waterhead babies men women
[45:19] carrying water at babies and step over
[45:21] cripples and lame and move his way
[45:23] through the crowd to go to the one that
[45:25] the father had showed him in vision
[45:28] and do you think Jesus didn't have
[45:30] compassion and want to heal them all
[45:32] amen when Jesus saw the multitude amen
[45:35] that were fainting because of hunger
[45:36] that come out to preach him he had
[45:38] compassion upon all of them and they
[45:40] were just hungry not sick and lame and
[45:42] crippled
[45:45] but brother I said true compassion is to
[45:47] do the will of God
[45:49] so although Jesus was God in flesh amen
[45:52] although he had all power although what
[45:55] he said would come to pass he only did
[45:57] that which the father showed him amen
[46:00] and so brother Branham said he was led
[46:02] by vision
[46:04] and so now we want to be like Jesus amen
[46:07] but then you can't take your own desire
[46:10] you can't protect yourself defend
[46:12] yourself prove yourself because Jesus
[46:14] never did
[46:18] I think to me this is just a side note
[46:20] but I think this is why gifts are so
[46:22] dangerous
[46:23] I'm thoroughly convinced gifts are
[46:25] dangerous and the more gifts you have
[46:27] the more dangerous it is
[46:29] because gifts and callings with God are
[46:31] without repentance
[46:33] so that gift will operate
[46:36] because the gifts and calling of God
[46:38] without repentance
[46:40] but it will operate in your life even if
[46:43] you're going wrong that gift may still
[46:45] operate in your life
[46:46] I think gifts are extremely dangerous
[46:48] because gifted people can find security
[46:50] in an operation of a gift
[46:53] because when I do this God answers
[46:56] because when I preach people are saved
[46:58] because when I lay hands on them they're
[47:00] healed therefore I'm okay gifts and
[47:02] callings are without repentance
[47:06] I think gifts are extremely dangerous
[47:09] I think if you have a gift and you're a
[47:11] gifted person you better humble yourself
[47:14] and beg God to keep you
[47:16] because you don't have the power to keep
[47:18] yourself and the devil is after you to
[47:20] push you just a little too far
[47:23] and a gifted person with an insecurity
[47:25] is dangerous it's a weapon in the hand
[47:27] of the devil
[47:30] and listen we all have insecurities
[47:33] raise your hand if you're secure
[47:38] then when everybody stares at you and
[47:40] laughs you'll start feeling insecure
[47:45] so that's a side note coming back
[47:50] in the message countdown from 1964. the
[47:54] promise says now
[47:55] natural astronaut a natural astronaut
[47:58] has something to control him
[48:00] when the astronaut is in the air he has
[48:02] something backwards here back down here
[48:04] on the earth that controls him it's
[48:05] called radar that radar moves him around
[48:07] shows him where he's at tells what he's
[48:09] doing and that radar controls him from a
[48:11] radar Tower here on Earth that's the
[48:14] natural astronaut so the spiritual
[48:16] astronaut has a controlled power has a
[48:19] control tower too it's not down here
[48:21] like a man is it's up there and it's the
[48:24] Holy Ghost that's in him that's
[48:25] controlling him a tower of the baptism
[48:27] of the Holy Ghost it's under control
[48:30] keeps him in control by the word
[48:34] I can't emphasize this enough he keeps
[48:37] in control by the word not in a bunch of
[48:40] fanaticism some whooped up some up up
[48:43] nonsense but thus saith the Lord and it
[48:46] happens it's always under control
[48:50] amen this is what I want out of my life
[48:53] I want to be one of those spiritual
[48:55] astronauts amen that is under the
[48:57] control of the Tower of the Holy Ghost
[49:02] um
[49:03] and it's under control and keeps him in
[49:05] control by the word
[49:09] listen there's so much that can happen
[49:12] and so much spiritual things can happen
[49:16] but and some of it good maybe not good
[49:21] but keep me in this word
[49:25] because the Holy Ghost
[49:28] will keep him under control and keeps
[49:31] him in control by the word
[49:33] I'm going to read this again not in a
[49:35] bunch of fanaticism some whooped up
[49:37] nonsense
[49:39] but thus saith the Lord and his word is
[49:40] the state the Lord
[49:42] and it happens it's always under control
[49:44] he's got a control tower that's the Holy
[49:46] Ghost
[49:47] and the word is his program and he lays
[49:50] right into that program and the power of
[49:52] the Holy Ghost endows him to move out
[49:54] and it brings the achievement that God
[49:56] wants by that God wants to achieve for
[49:59] his people that it might fulfill what he
[50:01] promised
[50:03] who's achieving
[50:04] and whose achievement is it
[50:07] so this spiritual astronaut that's
[50:09] controlled by the Tower of the Holy
[50:11] Ghost that's can keep him and him in
[50:13] control by the word amen it's moving the
[50:16] Holy Ghost endows him to move out and
[50:18] brings the achievement that God wants to
[50:21] be achieved for his people that it might
[50:24] fulfill what he promised
[50:25] so who's bringing the achievement gone
[50:28] whose achievement is it God's
[50:31] the spiritual astronaut is just the tool
[50:33] that's in his hand
[50:36] amen
[50:38] now I want to get to the part where I
[50:40] really wanted to get to
[50:43] the character for the third pool
[50:46] in the church age book out of the Smyrna
[50:48] Church age
[50:49] brother Ram is going to read a scripture
[50:51] he says why does he stand by the reason
[50:53] is in Romans 8 17 and 18 and he quotes
[50:57] this scripture if and if children then
[51:00] heirs Heirs of God and joint is with
[51:02] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[51:04] that we may be also glorified together
[51:06] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[51:08] present time are not worthy to be
[51:09] compared with the glory which shall be
[51:11] revealed in US
[51:13] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[51:16] reign with him you have to suffer to
[51:18] Reign the reason for this is that
[51:20] character simply is never made without
[51:22] suffering character is a victory not a
[51:24] gift
[51:25] a man without character can't Reign
[51:28] because power apart from character is
[51:30] satanic
[51:32] but Power with character is fit to rule
[51:37] and since he wants us to share even his
[51:40] throne on the same basis that he
[51:42] overcame and is set down in his father's
[51:44] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[51:46] with him and the little temporary
[51:48] suffering we go through now is not
[51:50] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[51:52] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[51:54] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[51:57] for those who are willing to enter into
[51:59] his kingdom through much tribulation
[52:02] so why must we suffer
[52:06] isn't since you received the baptism the
[52:09] Holy Ghost you received a revelation
[52:11] under the seals of who you really are
[52:13] have you had any suffering
[52:17] trials tribulations disappointments
[52:19] heartaches even some of your own
[52:21] failures failures from other people
[52:23] setbacks stumblings
[52:26] I've had them all everything I've listed
[52:28] I've had
[52:30] but why because God must develop within
[52:33] us christ-like character
[52:36] because a man without character can't
[52:39] Reign but we've been called To Rule and
[52:41] reign
[52:43] a man without character can't Reign
[52:44] because power apart from character is
[52:46] satanic this goes back to gifts
[52:49] gifts and callings are without
[52:50] repentance how many have seen gifts used
[52:53] in a satanic way
[52:57] but Power with character is fit to rule
[53:04] Hebrews 5 let's turn to Hebrews together
[53:06] I'm going to read a couple scriptures
[53:07] out of there Hebrews chapter 5.
[53:12] Hebrews chapter 5
[53:16] we'll read verse 8 and 9.
[53:19] though he were a son yet learned he
[53:21] obedience by the things which he
[53:23] suffered and being made perfect he
[53:25] became the author of Eternal salvation
[53:27] and to all them that obey him
[53:30] it's amazing to me that Jesus laid down
[53:32] a pattern for us and and Paul here in
[53:35] the book of Hebrews picks that up and
[53:36] says don't worry son learn The Obedience
[53:37] by the things which he suffered that's
[53:39] the same way we learn obedience
[53:42] God lets us stub our toe bump our nose
[53:45] take a few hard Falls and we learn to
[53:47] obey the word
[53:48] we get off the word and he lets us
[53:50] suffer the consequences of our actions
[53:52] and he's training us to stay with the
[53:54] word
[53:55] so Jesus learned obedience by the things
[53:57] he suffered and being made perfect he
[53:59] became the author of Eternal salvation
[54:00] into all them that obey him
[54:03] so now let's go over to
[54:05] to chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 12.
[54:19] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 4 ye have not
[54:23] yet resisted under blood striving
[54:24] against sin and you have forgotten the
[54:27] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[54:28] unto children my son despise not thou
[54:31] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[54:33] when thou are rebuked of him
[54:35] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[54:37] and scourges every son
[54:39] whom he receiveth if you endure
[54:42] chastening God deals with you as with
[54:44] sons for what son is he whom the father
[54:46] chasteneth not
[54:48] but if you be without chastisement
[54:50] whereof all our partakers didn't are you
[54:52] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[54:55] have had fathers of our flesh which
[54:57] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[54:59] shall we not much more much rather be in
[55:02] subjection unto the father of spirits
[55:03] and live
[55:04] for they verily for a few days chasing
[55:07] us after their own pleasure but he for
[55:10] our prophet
[55:12] not even for his own pleasure but for
[55:13] our benefit he corrects us but he for
[55:16] our Prophet that we might be partakers
[55:18] of his Holiness now no chest chastening
[55:21] for the present seemeth to be joyous but
[55:23] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[55:26] yielded the Peaceable fruit of
[55:27] righteousness unto them which are
[55:30] exercised thereby
[55:32] amen God as a father is bringing us up
[55:35] right
[55:36] God as a father knows when to chase it
[55:39] and when to Scourge he knows when we go
[55:42] wrong and he knows how to bring the rod
[55:44] of Correction to bring us back right but
[55:47] he's not doing it even for his own
[55:48] pleasure he's doing it for our Prophets
[55:51] he's doing it because he has a plan for
[55:54] us and we have to be kept in a certain
[55:56] kind of character for the benefits and
[55:58] blessings of this plan so he's doing it
[56:02] for us and no chastisement for the
[56:05] present seemeth to be joyous
[56:07] I've never had any that I liked
[56:12] right
[56:14] but Grievous they're not joyous but
[56:17] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[56:20] yieldeth the priesable fruits of
[56:22] righteousness unto them that are
[56:24] exercised thereby
[56:26] there's something that we're learning
[56:28] There's Something That We're gaining and
[56:31] that something will forever be grateful
[56:33] for
[56:34] we've had our scorchings we've had our
[56:37] chastenings and we probably have more
[56:39] coming
[56:42] but it's always intended for a purpose
[56:44] because power without character is
[56:46] satanic but Power with character is fit
[56:49] to rule and we are being we are being
[56:52] trained to rule
[56:54] this is our education this life is our
[56:58] education this is not our destination
[57:00] this is training us for our destination
[57:03] this is a training ground where we must
[57:05] learn where we must gain character
[57:07] because character is not a gift
[57:08] character is a victory so God could not
[57:10] birth us give us character and bring us
[57:12] into uh the kingdom no we have to pass
[57:15] through this life to gain the character
[57:17] necessary to rule and reign
[57:22] so I wanted to just take a look at a
[57:27] couple patterns here
[57:28] so we see patterns in the scriptures and
[57:32] we see things even in the first Exodus
[57:35] and if we look at the first Exodus we'll
[57:38] see
[57:40] Moses was actually an example his life
[57:44] became an example
[57:47] to the Israelites we all believe that
[57:50] many times the prophet's life becomes an
[57:53] example becomes a testimony of what
[57:55] God's doing it becomes the word to the
[57:58] people so so Moses here his life his
[58:00] very life and the pattern of his life is
[58:03] testifying or even foreshadowing what
[58:05] will happen to Israel and if we just
[58:08] think about his life for a minute he's
[58:10] he's born in Egypt and and he's born a
[58:14] proper child so he's born under a sign
[58:16] he's predestinated to be the deliverer
[58:19] and there's a prophecy of Deliverance
[58:20] that is waiting for this deliverer and
[58:23] and 400 years the prophecy says I'll
[58:27] bring your children out he's talking to
[58:28] Abraham out with a mighty ham and so now
[58:31] the time comes Abraham or Moses will
[58:34] pick this up in Exodus chapter two let's
[58:36] go to Exodus 2.
[58:38] and look at this scripture
[58:54] Exodus chapter 2.
[58:59] in verse 11.
[59:02] and it came to pass in those days when
[59:04] Moses was grown then he went out to his
[59:07] Brethren and looked on their burdens and
[59:08] he spied on an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew
[59:11] one of his brethren and he looked this
[59:13] way in that way and when he saw that
[59:15] there was no man he slew the Egyptian
[59:16] and hid him in the sand and when he went
[59:19] out the second day behold two men of the
[59:21] Hebrew strove together and he said to to
[59:23] him that did the wrong wherefore
[59:25] smionest thou thy fellow and he said who
[59:27] made thee a prince and a judge over us
[59:29] intendeth thou to kill me as thou kills
[59:32] the Egyptian and Moses feared and said
[59:34] surely this thing is known and when
[59:36] Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to
[59:38] slay Moses but Moses fled from the face
[59:40] of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of
[59:42] Midian and he sat down by a well so here
[59:46] here in the time of the prophecy to be
[59:48] fulfilled comes the right man and and
[59:51] he's the one that was born a proper
[59:53] child and he comes to fulfill the
[59:55] prophecy and and when he begins he
[59:58] starts off to move in Deliverance and he
[1:00:01] kills an Egyptian so there's an Egyptian
[1:00:03] that's dead
[1:00:04] then after the Egyptians dead he meets a
[1:00:07] challenge and in that challenge he runs
[1:00:10] away scared and in his fright he runs to
[1:00:12] the Wilderness and he spends 40 years
[1:00:14] wandering in the wilderness following
[1:00:16] after his father-in-law sheep
[1:00:19] we all together
[1:00:20] is that the pattern
[1:00:23] so now when God finally gets him trained
[1:00:26] and gets him in condition and gets him
[1:00:28] right and able to perform the word the
[1:00:31] promise that's in his life he brings him
[1:00:33] back into Egypt and when he brings him
[1:00:35] back into Egypt he delivers from a
[1:00:37] mighty hand amen and in in Egypt is
[1:00:40] decimated Egypt is destroyed and then in
[1:00:42] the crossing of the Red Sea when God
[1:00:44] closes the sea upon the army of Pharaoh
[1:00:46] Pharaoh and his army is destroyed so
[1:00:48] where Moses had one dead Egyptian now
[1:00:50] the Israelites have dead Egyptians
[1:00:54] but then they come to Katie's barnia and
[1:00:57] when they come to Katie's barnia they
[1:00:59] meet a challenge and in the face of the
[1:01:00] challenge they're afraid
[1:01:02] Moses in the face of the challenge was
[1:01:04] afraid and because of their fear they
[1:01:06] backed down from the word of God and
[1:01:08] then have to wonder in the wilderness
[1:01:10] for 40 years just like Moses did
[1:01:12] following the Sheep
[1:01:15] amen so we see the patterns and what was
[1:01:18] God doing in the 40 years with Moses is
[1:01:20] in the wilderness brother Benham said
[1:01:23] ah
[1:01:25] brother Ben said in voice of the sign he
[1:01:27] said this Exodus to be brought from
[1:01:29] Egypt back to their Homeland where they
[1:01:30] were promised to come was just at hand
[1:01:32] and God had to re-educate his man
[1:01:35] remember Moses was educated for 40 years
[1:01:38] getting all of his doctor's degrees and
[1:01:40] everything and had taken God just
[1:01:42] another 40 years to take out of him what
[1:01:44] education had put in him 40 years in the
[1:01:46] wilderness that taking it take it out it
[1:01:49] what was put in
[1:01:50] so now when when he flees in the face of
[1:01:54] the obstacle and backs down from the
[1:01:56] promised word and runs through the
[1:01:58] Wilderness he becomes a Wanderer in the
[1:02:00] desert for 40 years but what's God doing
[1:02:02] God is re-educating his man he's
[1:02:04] knocking all of Egyptian education out
[1:02:07] of him
[1:02:08] and we know that God helped him along
[1:02:11] and gave him a hot tempered wife to even
[1:02:12] help improve his character
[1:02:15] and now he who was going to rule
[1:02:17] everything is subject to his
[1:02:18] father-in-law working for his
[1:02:19] father-in-law
[1:02:20] God is re-educating his man so now when
[1:02:23] Israel comes out with a mighty hand and
[1:02:25] has their dead Egyptians amen and they
[1:02:27] come to Katie's barnia and they flee
[1:02:29] from the promised word because they're
[1:02:30] afraid now they have to wonder in the
[1:02:32] wilderness for 40 years what's God doing
[1:02:34] he's knocking all of the wrong
[1:02:36] understanding that came from Egypt out
[1:02:38] of the nation
[1:02:40] so Moses's life becomes a pattern for
[1:02:43] Israel
[1:02:44] are we together do we agree
[1:02:47] don't raise your hand if you disagree or
[1:02:48] hurt my feelings just talk to me later
[1:02:51] I hope we all agree and the reason I
[1:02:53] went through that is because I want to
[1:02:55] show you the prophet of God's life in
[1:02:57] this day becomes a pattern for us
[1:03:00] God Amen God begins to work in his life
[1:03:04] and commissions and he begins to preach
[1:03:06] the gospel amen then when he's baptizing
[1:03:08] on the Ohio River in 1933 a pillar of
[1:03:11] fire comes down amen and a great
[1:03:13] statement is made amen that just as John
[1:03:15] the Baptist for when his first coming
[1:03:17] amen you'll have a message that will
[1:03:19] forerun a second coming of Christ
[1:03:21] and so now he's got this prophecy in his
[1:03:24] life amen and we know after that that he
[1:03:27] runs up to to Mishawaka Indiana I mean
[1:03:29] he's going up fishing and he comes
[1:03:31] across the Revival and there you know he
[1:03:34] preaches we know the story he gets
[1:03:35] several invites and he comes back and
[1:03:38] when he meets the challenge of his
[1:03:40] mother-in-law his mother-in-law tells
[1:03:42] him don't go out with that bunch of
[1:03:44] trash and don't do this and he fears his
[1:03:46] mother-in-law to make her angry any any
[1:03:49] and he stops moving forward in the
[1:03:52] program of God
[1:03:54] listen he says in my life story now from
[1:03:57] here listen I listen to my mother-in-law
[1:03:59] instead of God
[1:04:00] and forsaken the church and went on back
[1:04:02] with the Baptist people right away
[1:04:04] plagues hit my home
[1:04:09] listen he's the one the pillar of fire
[1:04:12] came over
[1:04:14] and the words were spoken
[1:04:17] that prophecy is not going to change
[1:04:20] you believe that
[1:04:23] but there are some lessons this Prophet
[1:04:25] has to learn
[1:04:27] he needs the character to move into that
[1:04:29] office
[1:04:31] and he needs listen
[1:04:34] he learned a valuable lesson because
[1:04:36] when he when he disobeyed God and he
[1:04:39] listened to his mother-in-law he said
[1:04:41] that's when plagues hit my home
[1:04:43] he said that's when he said that's when
[1:04:46] my father died that's when my brother
[1:04:47] died he said then a flood came and God
[1:04:50] took my baby and then when my wife died
[1:04:52] listen that Prophet went through
[1:04:54] chastisement
[1:04:56] he had a good father because there was
[1:04:59] going to become a great power into the
[1:05:01] hand of that Prophet The King's sword
[1:05:02] was going to drop into his hand and
[1:05:04] before that happened he had to have the
[1:05:06] character to handle that word
[1:05:09] and because he had to have the character
[1:05:11] God would even let him make this mistake
[1:05:13] because even our mistakes work together
[1:05:15] for God's glory
[1:05:18] and he can make our mistakes even work
[1:05:20] together in his plan and so now the
[1:05:23] prophet has to he has to fail and he has
[1:05:26] to take chastisement and what I would
[1:05:27] say is hard chastisement
[1:05:31] so much so that it gives me pity it
[1:05:33] makes me feel sorry for him amen except
[1:05:35] I Know What It produced
[1:05:38] God wasn't taking pity on them because
[1:05:40] God knew what it would produce God had
[1:05:42] to chasten his son because he had to
[1:05:45] bring him into this position and so now
[1:05:47] he moves on then he moves into the
[1:05:49] ministry he gets a commission from an
[1:05:51] angel he meets an angel in a cabin and
[1:05:53] the angel begins to tell him that yeah
[1:05:55] that you're born for a specific purpose
[1:05:57] you've got a Ministry of healing to take
[1:05:59] to the peoples of the world and now he
[1:06:01] goes out with a commission and when he
[1:06:03] goes out with the commission he goes
[1:06:04] with the first pull and in the first
[1:06:06] pull if he takes somebody by the hand
[1:06:08] amen there'll be a pattern break out on
[1:06:10] his arms as that pattern breaks out
[1:06:12] he'll be able to discern the sickness
[1:06:14] and then when he prays for them if he
[1:06:16] can get the people to believe him
[1:06:17] nothing will stand before his prayers
[1:06:18] not even cancer
[1:06:21] but then brother Branham says he made a
[1:06:23] mistake with the first pull
[1:06:25] he pulled too hard and he tells us I
[1:06:28] won't go and read all the quotes but we
[1:06:30] know the story as well he he he pulls
[1:06:32] too hard and at one time I think it was
[1:06:34] Jonesboro Arkansas he stayed at the
[1:06:36] pulpit for eight straight days praying
[1:06:39] for the people why because he had
[1:06:41] compassion and he had a gift and he had
[1:06:43] a commission and he stayed there praying
[1:06:45] for the people and eventually his
[1:06:48] schedule broke him down to the point
[1:06:50] where he said he had a nervous break and
[1:06:52] he said it almost killed me and I left
[1:06:54] the field for eight months
[1:06:57] and he said that was wrong
[1:06:59] I learned wisdom
[1:07:02] what was he doing he was working in a
[1:07:04] commission
[1:07:05] that an angel gave him but he had to
[1:07:07] learn how to work in that Commission
[1:07:10] there's things he had to learn and he
[1:07:12] suffered along the way
[1:07:14] then when it came to the second pool he
[1:07:16] comes to a place I'll see if I can find
[1:07:18] the quote here in the second pool he
[1:07:21] says in the message experiences 1952 he
[1:07:24] says now he told me that this sign would
[1:07:26] be given first and if they would believe
[1:07:28] that that you you would know the very
[1:07:30] thoughts of their heart and by that they
[1:07:32] would believe that's the same God and
[1:07:34] God knows that I know nothing about it
[1:07:36] then the same Pillar of Fire that spoke
[1:07:38] to Moses has spoken again in the last
[1:07:40] day
[1:07:41] and it was not Moses that done anything
[1:07:43] it was the angel that went before Moses
[1:07:45] that did it
[1:07:48] you catch that
[1:07:51] Moses didn't do anything
[1:07:54] the Angels the Lord that went before
[1:07:56] Moses he did it all
[1:07:57] Moses could get to the end of his life
[1:07:59] and say I was only standing near when he
[1:08:01] did those things
[1:08:04] do you remember what Moses got chasing
[1:08:06] for and that chastisement of the Lord
[1:08:08] would not let him enter into the
[1:08:10] Promised Land
[1:08:11] because when God told him to go speak to
[1:08:13] the rock that it gives forth water he
[1:08:15] went took his rod in his hand and he was
[1:08:17] angry at the people because they were
[1:08:19] chiding with him about water and he says
[1:08:21] listen to statement must I fetch water
[1:08:25] for ye
[1:08:27] stiff-necked people
[1:08:29] and he struck the Rock and water came
[1:08:33] out God still honored his gift and still
[1:08:36] God honored his position and his calling
[1:08:38] as the prophet and honored that rod in
[1:08:40] his hand and when he struck it water
[1:08:42] still came out but what did he do he
[1:08:44] glorified himself instead of God
[1:08:47] he was supposed to speak to the Rock in
[1:08:49] the name of God and the water was
[1:08:51] supposed to spurt out but in his anger
[1:08:53] he elevated himself and said must I
[1:08:56] fetch water and as soon as he put
[1:08:59] himself in that position God smote him
[1:09:02] and said you'll not enter into the
[1:09:04] Promised Land
[1:09:08] it's very important to remember who's
[1:09:10] God
[1:09:11] and Who We Are
[1:09:14] by the prophet of God could come in his
[1:09:16] ministry say I wasn't the one who was
[1:09:18] down on the river that day I'm not the
[1:09:19] one who done those things I'm not the
[1:09:21] one who opened the blind eyes I was only
[1:09:23] standing there when he did it
[1:09:25] and then when he would speak squirrels
[1:09:27] into existence twice he would say See
[1:09:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:09:31] and forever he can create where there's
[1:09:33] nothing
[1:09:37] listen this is the kind of character
[1:09:39] this bride has got to get to if she ever
[1:09:41] hopes to have a manifestation
[1:09:45] not not one that'll say I'll say and
[1:09:48] I'll do this and devil you get back my
[1:09:50] goodness that's not the way the prophet
[1:09:52] operated
[1:09:57] so much of that rhetoric
[1:10:00] is elevating self
[1:10:03] and this bride has got to get to the
[1:10:05] place where she doesn't do anything it's
[1:10:07] the angel of the Lord who did it all
[1:10:09] it was the pillar of fire that's Among
[1:10:11] Us it was Jesus Christ it was not me I
[1:10:14] was just standing near when he did it
[1:10:15] and you could say to your brother but I
[1:10:17] heard the words come out of your mouth
[1:10:18] and you say you know what that wasn't
[1:10:19] even my thinking God just placed it
[1:10:21] there had nothing to do with me
[1:10:25] this is the place we've got to come to
[1:10:33] it says now
[1:10:35] surely people we can understand I'm
[1:10:37] still in the second pool now Moses
[1:10:39] here's one thing that I do wrong
[1:10:42] I'm admitting it with the Bible before
[1:10:44] me
[1:10:45] I'm doing wrong by bringing this person
[1:10:47] up here and speaking to them till I have
[1:10:49] to break myself into a vision that
[1:10:51] weakens me down what I ought to do well
[1:10:53] maybe I ought to have them call one
[1:10:55] person out of the audience or something
[1:10:57] another like that and bring them up here
[1:10:59] and talk to them and line up a prayer
[1:11:01] line and pray for all the rest of them
[1:11:02] as they went by that would be better
[1:11:05] but it's got to a place where if you
[1:11:07] don't stand and talk to the person the
[1:11:09] vision doesn't come they don't even
[1:11:10] think you're anointed
[1:11:12] I brought that upon myself I confess
[1:11:15] before God
[1:11:16] brother Benham on the second pool pulled
[1:11:19] too hard
[1:11:21] with a sign in the hand pulled too hard
[1:11:23] amen with with the discernment he pulled
[1:11:26] too hard and that's what he was told in
[1:11:28] the vision amen he pulled too hard amen
[1:11:30] and he said don't do it on the third one
[1:11:34] foreign
[1:11:35] so what's happening Brother Branham is
[1:11:37] learning
[1:11:39] remember in the vision the second pool
[1:11:41] he pulled too hard and he got the line
[1:11:43] all tangled around his feet and he was
[1:11:44] trying to put together and he said
[1:11:45] forgive me I'm a stupid person forgive
[1:11:48] me
[1:11:48] remember that he realized he had failed
[1:11:51] amen he should have just shown the sign
[1:11:53] of discernment and then turned the
[1:11:55] people to the word and had him take
[1:11:56] their healing based off the word the
[1:11:58] discernment would show that the same God
[1:12:00] that was there was the same God here
[1:12:02] it's the sign of the Messiah now take
[1:12:03] him out his word but he didn't do that
[1:12:05] he kept pulling with the second pull
[1:12:07] more discernment more to sermon until
[1:12:09] the people wouldn't even believe what he
[1:12:11] was saying unless they saw the
[1:12:12] discernment
[1:12:14] and they wouldn't even accept their
[1:12:15] healing unless he had a vision of them
[1:12:18] so he pulled too hard
[1:12:21] but on the third pool he wasn't to do
[1:12:23] that
[1:12:25] so what's he doing he's learning
[1:12:28] what do we get to watch in the prophet's
[1:12:31] life we get to watch the child training
[1:12:34] of a Son of God who's coming to his
[1:12:37] adopted position
[1:12:39] we are such a blessed people we get to
[1:12:42] see the successes and the failures we
[1:12:45] get to see the mistakes and we get to
[1:12:48] see his chastisement
[1:12:50] remember the tax case he had to go
[1:12:52] through and the tax case was a big deal
[1:12:54] to him and when the lawyers called and
[1:12:56] he was so tired and he said something
[1:12:58] wrong and then the angel of the Lord
[1:13:00] told him it was a lie but he himself
[1:13:02] amen didn't realize and we would have
[1:13:03] even forgiven him
[1:13:05] right he stepped outside and told his
[1:13:08] wife tell him I stepped outside well
[1:13:09] technically he was outside I'd give him
[1:13:11] a pass
[1:13:12] God gave him no pass
[1:13:15] because he was training a son of God
[1:13:18] he was training him to be honest he was
[1:13:20] training him to to be a man to do things
[1:13:23] right he was training him right
[1:13:28] then when he comes
[1:13:30] up to the third pool through the second
[1:13:32] pool then he has to begin to deal with
[1:13:34] rejection
[1:13:36] and in 1962 he says in the present stage
[1:13:38] of my Ministry
[1:13:40] said how I think of that how a servant
[1:13:42] that'll stand true to the word sooner or
[1:13:44] later just remember the people are going
[1:13:47] to forsake Him
[1:13:48] now we want to strike that just for a
[1:13:50] few minutes and I won't keep you too
[1:13:52] long because I want you here in the
[1:13:54] morning always when God's servant stands
[1:13:57] true to the word all forsake Him now
[1:13:59] just take anywhere you want to any time
[1:14:01] in the Bible or in history that when a
[1:14:03] man stayed true no matter how popular
[1:14:05] who he was when he stayed true to the
[1:14:07] word the time come when the religious
[1:14:09] World forsaken him and cut him off
[1:14:12] now just read it
[1:14:14] if you take the Bible from Genesis over
[1:14:15] to the Book of Revelation and pick up in
[1:14:17] the pre-19 council and take down to the
[1:14:19] 19 fathers and every man every saint
[1:14:22] every Prophet every true servant of God
[1:14:24] stayed with the word was forsaken by the
[1:14:27] ecclesiastical thing and cast down
[1:14:31] now what is he saying he's showing that
[1:14:33] this rejection has to come and he starts
[1:14:36] to go back to the scripture where Paul
[1:14:37] says all forsaken me demons loving this
[1:14:39] present world has forsaken me and
[1:14:41] brother bam is typing into his ministry
[1:14:43] he's coming to the third pool and at the
[1:14:45] opening of the seals he said now that'll
[1:14:46] cost ten thousand of my friends to leave
[1:14:48] me
[1:14:50] what's God doing God is training God is
[1:14:54] training a son of God
[1:14:56] he's learning to stay with the word
[1:14:58] regardless of the consequences stick
[1:14:59] with the word regardless of what's going
[1:15:02] to happen amen and he was training him
[1:15:04] and he was training him because what he
[1:15:07] had and what he had to give and the gift
[1:15:09] that was in his life and the word that
[1:15:11] was going to be placed in his hand was a
[1:15:13] power amen that if he did not have
[1:15:15] character would become satanic
[1:15:18] with that kind of gift in his life if
[1:15:21] the devil would have got in to influence
[1:15:23] I'm telling you amen it would have went
[1:15:26] haywire the whole world would have went
[1:15:28] haywire
[1:15:30] but God had to train him
[1:15:33] and just as Moses life was a pattern
[1:15:37] for Israel that prophet's life is a
[1:15:40] pattern for us
[1:15:41] God has called us and commissioned us
[1:15:43] he's told us who we are and what we're
[1:15:45] to do but along the way we've got a lot
[1:15:48] of lessons to learn
[1:15:50] amen and when brother Branham would grow
[1:15:52] and learn a lesson then he would move
[1:15:54] into the first pool after his
[1:15:56] chastisement after his refusal to go
[1:15:58] after all of that then an angel would
[1:16:00] come commission him then he would move
[1:16:02] into the ministry then in the first pool
[1:16:03] he would make a mistake and and then he
[1:16:05] would have to leave the field for eight
[1:16:07] months but but then he would learn a
[1:16:08] lesson then God would open up the second
[1:16:10] pool
[1:16:12] listen brother Branham did not have a
[1:16:15] pillar of fire give him a declaration of
[1:16:18] his ministry at the river and then him
[1:16:22] manifest the third pool
[1:16:24] there was a lifetime of growing and
[1:16:27] chastisement and learning and character
[1:16:30] building and obedience before he come
[1:16:33] into the third full minister
[1:16:37] and you think this bride is just going
[1:16:39] to be endowed with the spoken word
[1:16:42] without character
[1:16:44] without child training without
[1:16:46] chastisement without bumping her nose a
[1:16:48] few times falling stumbling failing
[1:16:50] getting corrected
[1:16:52] listen think about the the way the
[1:16:55] Revelation has been growing and our
[1:16:57] lives have been changing for us for me
[1:16:59] individually it's been step by step by
[1:17:01] step by step by step amen you don't you
[1:17:03] don't just wake up a newborn babe in
[1:17:05] Jesus Christ and God gives you the power
[1:17:07] of the spoken word my goodness what
[1:17:10] would we have done with it
[1:17:12] what would I have done with it years ago
[1:17:15] I'm ashamed to say I would have been
[1:17:17] selfish I would have been prideful I
[1:17:19] would have been air it made me arrogant
[1:17:20] I would have brought me into an absolute
[1:17:22] destruction of myself and the people
[1:17:24] around me
[1:17:27] and if you can't say Amen to that then
[1:17:29] maybe you've deceived yourself
[1:17:32] because we're all growing we're not what
[1:17:34] we're not what we were
[1:17:36] and we're not what we ought to be but
[1:17:38] praise God we're not what we were I'm
[1:17:40] not what I want to be amen I'm not what
[1:17:42] I ought to be but the one who's brought
[1:17:44] me from what I used to be the what I am
[1:17:45] now is the same one the same father
[1:17:48] who's training me Amen to move in that
[1:17:50] position where he can entrust me with
[1:17:52] whatever he needs to entrust me with to
[1:17:55] manifest his glory and for his
[1:17:57] achievement
[1:17:59] but I don't believe it's going to come
[1:18:01] until the time that we're dead to self
[1:18:06] look at the end of brother Brennan's
[1:18:07] Ministry and all that he went through
[1:18:09] the death of his wife the death of his
[1:18:11] daughter the death of uh of his father
[1:18:13] the death of his brother amen the the
[1:18:16] the the the
[1:18:17] absolute roaring success of the first
[1:18:20] part of his ministry in the accolades
[1:18:22] and the newspapers full and the love
[1:18:24] from all the world and then moving to
[1:18:26] the second poem people start slowly
[1:18:28] pulling back until finally his friends
[1:18:30] start pulling away from him
[1:18:33] and through it all he fails in the tax
[1:18:35] case and he and he fails in the second
[1:18:37] pool and he fails in this and he keeps
[1:18:39] getting corrected and chasing of the
[1:18:41] Lord and
[1:18:42] then afterwards I mean even after the
[1:18:44] opening of the seals he comes to
[1:18:46] standing in the Gap and gets corrected
[1:18:47] from the Lord for his for his
[1:18:49] selfishness for his hurt feelings and
[1:18:51] wanting to go uh move away from the
[1:18:53] people
[1:18:54] what God's doing he's bringing him
[1:18:58] into position
[1:19:01] what's God been doing with us bringing
[1:19:03] us into position
[1:19:09] in the message things that are to be
[1:19:12] by the way I said
[1:19:13] and how am I going to teach them algebra
[1:19:16] when they won't learn their ABCs
[1:19:19] when they won't even do the common thing
[1:19:21] see the natural thing how you're going
[1:19:23] to tell them high things when you won't
[1:19:24] even start you want to get on top the
[1:19:27] ladder before you hit the first
[1:19:29] that's the reason you fall
[1:19:35] if you want to say why do I keep failing
[1:19:37] uh let's come back to this quote
[1:19:41] trying to get on the top of the ladder
[1:19:43] before you hit the first that's the
[1:19:44] reason you fall
[1:19:46] you get at the bottom and climb right on
[1:19:48] up as God leads you cope your life and
[1:19:51] every ever follow every bit of the word
[1:19:53] that God has ordained for you to do
[1:19:56] then the message the true Easter seal he
[1:19:58] says that's what's the matter you're
[1:19:59] trying to jump on top of the ladder when
[1:20:01] you ought to be on the bottom yet see
[1:20:03] get started down here clean up get
[1:20:06] started right then we would we we could
[1:20:09] build upon that otherwise you cannot
[1:20:10] build because any foundation that's not
[1:20:13] built upon the principles of Christ will
[1:20:14] fall
[1:20:16] and and the Zachariah tells the rubable
[1:20:19] don't despise the day of small things
[1:20:22] because you will see the plummet in the
[1:20:25] hand is a rubber born zeruble who laid
[1:20:26] the foundation will call for The
[1:20:28] Headstone amen just because it starts
[1:20:30] off small amen don't despise the small
[1:20:33] things in our lives amen because that's
[1:20:35] what works to build the great things
[1:20:41] in the message
[1:20:43] the seed is not air with the shock he
[1:20:45] says now that's how the church starts
[1:20:47] that's how it always starts you start
[1:20:49] from the bottom you don't start from the
[1:20:51] top a man trying to climb a ladder tries
[1:20:53] to get on top first he'll break his neck
[1:20:55] you've got to start and build up to that
[1:20:58] praise God
[1:21:01] Moses tells him the word of God in
[1:21:03] Exodus
[1:21:05] this is what he says in chapter 23.
[1:21:08] verse 29 I will not drive them out from
[1:21:10] before thee in one year
[1:21:12] lest the land become desolate in the
[1:21:14] Beast of the field multiply against it
[1:21:16] by little and little I will drive them
[1:21:18] out from before thee until thou be
[1:21:21] increased and inherit the land
[1:21:24] brother Brandon from the beginning was
[1:21:26] ordained to be the seventh angel and the
[1:21:30] voice amen the voice of Revelation 10 7.
[1:21:36] but God brought him little by little
[1:21:39] trained him taught him brought him into
[1:21:42] a position he didn't commission him then
[1:21:44] give him the revelation of the seals and
[1:21:47] the power of the spoken word
[1:21:50] I hope this makes sense to you
[1:21:52] let it be a pattern for us
[1:21:57] let's let's look at First Peter together
[1:22:06] first Peter
[1:22:09] chapter 5.
[1:22:18] First Peter chapter 5 verse 10.
[1:22:24] but the God of all Grace who hath called
[1:22:26] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[1:22:28] Jesus after that you have suffered a
[1:22:31] while make you perfect established
[1:22:34] strengthen
[1:22:35] settle you
[1:22:39] when after you've suffered a while
[1:22:42] not day one not when you first start on
[1:22:45] this journey
[1:22:46] sometimes we get so disappointed at our
[1:22:48] failures and our chastisement but that
[1:22:51] is what we're learning from that's the
[1:22:53] training that we're in and that's why
[1:22:54] we're in this life that's why we've come
[1:22:56] into this condition that's why we're
[1:22:58] born in this flesh that's why we're
[1:22:59] journeying through this life is because
[1:23:01] we must gain character for reigning and
[1:23:04] there's certain achievements God wants
[1:23:06] to make in his bride and he cannot make
[1:23:08] those achievements if that bride is
[1:23:10] going to stand before the people and say
[1:23:12] shall I fetch water for you stiff-necked
[1:23:14] people
[1:23:16] no sir he's got to come to the character
[1:23:20] where it's never her it's always him and
[1:23:22] she knows within herself she can do
[1:23:24] nothing but with him all things are
[1:23:26] possible that he is the Vine I am the
[1:23:28] branch if I'm disconnected from the
[1:23:30] breath there's nothing if you see fruit
[1:23:31] on me it's the life from the vine it's
[1:23:34] not the branch
[1:23:36] I'm just the place that comes out I'm
[1:23:39] not the producer of it it's the life and
[1:23:41] the root of the vine that's bringing the
[1:23:42] fruit I'm not producing the fruit I'm
[1:23:45] just the one that's hanging on
[1:23:49] there has to be an entire attitude shift
[1:23:52] till we can be as humble as that Prophet
[1:23:54] was humble with as much power and
[1:23:56] manifestation as he had in his life
[1:23:58] he was completely humble
[1:24:01] hey brother brother random never would
[1:24:04] have found himself worthy to speak to a
[1:24:06] storm
[1:24:07] he would have never thought he was
[1:24:08] Worthy
[1:24:09] but God come and told him to do it and
[1:24:12] he had confidence in that voice
[1:24:14] and he knew whatever it told him was the
[1:24:16] truth and so he knew without a doubt
[1:24:18] that if he did what the voice said it
[1:24:20] would happen it would happen before he
[1:24:21] spoke it before I mean he believed it
[1:24:23] before he spoke it that it would be
[1:24:25] and that was the Fulfillment of Mark
[1:24:28] that we read
[1:24:29] if you say unto this mountain you know
[1:24:32] and brother Branham was given amen that
[1:24:34] kind of authority to speak amen and he
[1:24:37] was representing Jesus Christ on Earth
[1:24:39] he was Jesus Christ was living in that
[1:24:43] flesh and he was a representation of
[1:24:44] Christ in the formation of the bride and
[1:24:47] he was speaking and he had that
[1:24:49] manifestation in that power and he spoke
[1:24:51] and the storm did exactly what he said
[1:24:55] but you know he never said anything to a
[1:24:57] mountain to move
[1:24:59] because God never told him that he
[1:25:02] didn't wasn't given sovereignly that
[1:25:03] even though that was in the scripture he
[1:25:05] couldn't say because of this now I can
[1:25:07] do that he couldn't do that until God
[1:25:09] told him to do that
[1:25:11] this is a man who came under control
[1:25:14] this was a spiritual astronaut that was
[1:25:16] controlled by a tower
[1:25:19] and he became an example to you and I
[1:25:23] this is how it works
[1:25:25] this is how it works
[1:25:28] these things as the lessons came and as
[1:25:30] he grew and as he matured more was given
[1:25:33] sign in the hand lessons mistakes
[1:25:36] chastening
[1:25:38] learning second pull discernment
[1:25:41] mistakes lessening chastising it lessons
[1:25:45] chastisement rejection
[1:25:48] third pool comes
[1:25:52] sometimes we want to say we're bride and
[1:25:54] we want to jump to the top of the ladder
[1:25:56] I say God help me learn what I need to
[1:26:00] learn today
[1:26:02] keep me humble Lord and help me learn
[1:26:05] what I need to learn today
[1:26:09] we've heard talking about the spoken
[1:26:12] word the manifestation
[1:26:14] I think brother Benham declared it for
[1:26:16] us and he showed us temporarily what
[1:26:18] we'll see in fullness of power
[1:26:19] what it will look like I don't know how
[1:26:21] it will happen I don't know will it be
[1:26:23] everybody will it be a few well I have
[1:26:25] no idea
[1:26:27] uh it may be completely different than
[1:26:29] what I'm even thinking
[1:26:31] but the point is it'll be there
[1:26:33] according to the prophecy and it'll be
[1:26:35] according to God's design and will and
[1:26:37] his timing through whomsoever he chooses
[1:26:39] but the vessel he chooses will have the
[1:26:41] character to handle that power
[1:26:43] he will see to it
[1:26:46] so if we ever want to be part of that
[1:26:48] manifestation
[1:26:50] then what do we do today
[1:26:52] I say never forget your ABCs
[1:26:56] never forget your ABCs we have people
[1:27:00] who want to show Dynamic gifts and
[1:27:02] dynamic powers and they want to speak
[1:27:04] things and they want to do great things
[1:27:06] and really when it comes down to it they
[1:27:08] want to be somebody
[1:27:10] you can see through it
[1:27:11] but but they want to speak things but I
[1:27:14] say if you want to speak something into
[1:27:16] existence
[1:27:17] and if you want the power of the spoken
[1:27:19] word then start by speaking the word to
[1:27:21] this earth here and getting this to obey
[1:27:23] the word
[1:27:24] well I speak to a storm if you can't
[1:27:26] even keep from lying why speak to a
[1:27:28] storm if you can't even keep your home
[1:27:30] in order why speak to a storm if you
[1:27:32] can't keep this body this Earth why
[1:27:34] speak to the Earth if you can't speak to
[1:27:36] this earth and make it match the
[1:27:38] scriptures
[1:27:39] crazy man if you can't conduct yourself
[1:27:42] in your home as a Son of God and a
[1:27:43] daughter of God if you're fighting and
[1:27:45] fussing all the time if the children are
[1:27:47] disorderly then why why even think about
[1:27:50] speaking something into existence until
[1:27:51] we first come back to the ABCs
[1:27:55] and let God train us where we're at and
[1:27:57] repent and recognize I need something
[1:27:59] more I need a greater character just to
[1:28:02] handle today
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:07] we want to speak a world to existence
[1:28:09] and go live a private life on it but we
[1:28:11] can't pay our tithes on a regular basis
[1:28:13] or show up to church according to the
[1:28:15] word
[1:28:16] and forsake the assembling together of
[1:28:18] ourselves
[1:28:19] you realize that no matter how far you
[1:28:22] go in math you still need ABCs to go to
[1:28:24] algebra and trigonometry and all that
[1:28:26] and no matter how advanced you get in
[1:28:29] literature
[1:28:30] all literature is still made of the ABCs
[1:28:33] at least English literature
[1:28:36] you can never get away from the ABCs you
[1:28:39] can never become so advanced in the
[1:28:41] kingdom of God that you don't need to
[1:28:43] pay your tithes pray and read your Bible
[1:28:45] every day that you don't need to come to
[1:28:47] Fellowship you're never getting so
[1:28:49] Advanced that you don't need fellowship
[1:28:50] with the Believers
[1:28:52] you never got so Advanced that you don't
[1:28:55] need to sit under the live preaching of
[1:28:56] the word through the faithful Ministry
[1:28:57] you've never you've never got that
[1:28:59] advanced yet
[1:29:01] we can never we can never listen these
[1:29:05] things are foundational they're ABC's
[1:29:07] their basics in the scripture they're
[1:29:08] basic the rudimental parts of Christian
[1:29:10] Life
[1:29:11] through the foundation but remember the
[1:29:13] rest of the house is built on the
[1:29:14] foundation
[1:29:16] so you can never start building off the
[1:29:18] foundation and leave the foundation your
[1:29:21] building will collapse everything must
[1:29:23] stay upon this Foundation all the way up
[1:29:26] so we want to go high but forsake the
[1:29:29] foundation don't forsake the foundation
[1:29:32] we want to we want Power the bride's
[1:29:34] going to this and the bride's going to
[1:29:35] do that why doesn't the bride just keep
[1:29:37] her home in order
[1:29:40] well the bride will do this and the
[1:29:42] bride will do that why won't the bride
[1:29:44] just clean up her language
[1:29:47] clean up her lifestyle
[1:29:49] why won't the bride just as a husband
[1:29:52] loved his wife as Christ loved the
[1:29:53] church
[1:29:54] well I want the wife reverence her
[1:29:56] husband
[1:29:59] see what I'm saying if we ever want to
[1:30:01] get to the top of the ladder we've got
[1:30:03] to hit every rung on the ladder
[1:30:06] why to build character to learn
[1:30:10] obedience
[1:30:11] stay in line with the word we're never
[1:30:13] going to have power spoken word if we
[1:30:16] can't keep the word
[1:30:20] does that make sense
[1:30:23] we must have the character for the third
[1:30:26] pool
[1:30:28] we all want something Dynamic to happen
[1:30:31] and I do too
[1:30:32] I love when God does those things
[1:30:36] they move me when you hear what brother
[1:30:38] Benham said and you hear about the
[1:30:40] potential they move me I want to see it
[1:30:44] but I know that I need more character
[1:30:48] and I know that he needs to do a greater
[1:30:50] work in me
[1:30:52] and I can be so forward thinking and
[1:30:54] looking to the day when all this happens
[1:30:55] then I'm neglecting to live the right
[1:30:58] kind of Life today and it's the right
[1:31:00] kind of Life today that takes me there
[1:31:03] it's this rung of the ladder that I'm on
[1:31:06] that I must conquer to get a little
[1:31:08] higher
[1:31:10] so where are trials is where our
[1:31:12] failures are where we're struggling is
[1:31:15] the place that we should be focused on
[1:31:17] not what's going to happen in the future
[1:31:18] that's going to happen we're going to
[1:31:20] get there but God is taking you through
[1:31:22] something now to give you the character
[1:31:24] to handle wherever he takes us
[1:31:27] so let's learn our lessons let's build
[1:31:30] on the foundation and as we climb higher
[1:31:32] amen we're going to bump our nose we're
[1:31:34] going to fall we're going to scratch our
[1:31:36] knee we're going to make mistakes we're
[1:31:38] going to have heartaches but let's take
[1:31:39] our lumps and learn our lessons so that
[1:31:41] we can go to the next rung on the ladder
[1:31:43] and the next one and when the bride as a
[1:31:45] whole and all of us have moved up I mean
[1:31:47] I believe with all my heart we're going
[1:31:49] to see amazing things
[1:31:51] we've seen amazing things he's open to
[1:31:53] us amazing things I don't know what
[1:31:55] those amazing things are but I believe
[1:31:57] by the grace of God I have a father
[1:31:59] who's keeping building character in me
[1:32:01] even when I would have bypassed it
[1:32:05] I would have dodged it and moved around
[1:32:06] it but there's a father that's watching
[1:32:09] over me that's bringing me through
[1:32:10] everything he's chastening me and
[1:32:12] allowing things in my life and teaching
[1:32:14] me things by the things I've suffered so
[1:32:16] that he can establish me and settle me
[1:32:19] and get me into a place where he can
[1:32:21] achieve his achievement through me
[1:32:25] and it'll be him doing it for his glory
[1:32:28] and I will be the functionary
[1:32:33] we need to get to where we're just the
[1:32:35] tool in his hand
[1:32:37] and you can have a toolbox with ever so
[1:32:39] many tools but they lay there
[1:32:42] with nothing to do
[1:32:44] and no ability to operate themselves
[1:32:47] until the master Picks Them Up and puts
[1:32:49] them into use
[1:32:51] and we need to see ourselves as Tools in
[1:32:54] his toolbox
[1:32:56] that if I'm not in his hand and he's not
[1:32:59] the power behind my actions I can do
[1:33:03] nothing
[1:33:05] without him
[1:33:06] I can do nothing
[1:33:08] but with him all things are possible
[1:33:14] amen
[1:33:16] you know I want to close with just a
[1:33:19] little story
[1:33:21] you remember the story brother Benham
[1:33:23] tells
[1:33:24] of the slave buyer down south when he
[1:33:26] goes by the certain Plantation and
[1:33:29] there's a certain slave that stands out
[1:33:30] above them all
[1:33:32] he carries himself with dignity he
[1:33:35] doesn't have to be whipped to do his
[1:33:37] work he's just an outstanding slave and
[1:33:40] the slave buyer wants to buy him and the
[1:33:41] owner says he's not for sale
[1:33:44] and he says well what makes him so
[1:33:45] special do you treat him special no
[1:33:47] treat him like the rest of them
[1:33:49] Hey listen this world doesn't treat you
[1:33:51] special
[1:33:52] you get treated just like everybody else
[1:33:56] they get covered you get covered
[1:33:59] strep throat goes around
[1:34:04] the world gets strep throat the
[1:34:06] Believers get stripped
[1:34:10] that slave didn't get treated any
[1:34:12] different than all the other slaves
[1:34:14] does he get any better food to eat nope
[1:34:16] he eats in the galley with the rest of
[1:34:17] the slaves he gets the same treatment
[1:34:19] listen
[1:34:21] we get
[1:34:22] Now understand what I'm saying in this
[1:34:25] life we get the same treatment
[1:34:28] we're born
[1:34:29] we struggle we work we earn our living
[1:34:32] by the sweat of our brow we get
[1:34:34] sicknesses we eventually die
[1:34:40] but despite all the equal treatment he
[1:34:44] acted completely different
[1:34:47] he carried himself with dignity and when
[1:34:49] he asked what makes him so different he
[1:34:51] said well I've wondered that too but I
[1:34:52] found out that back in the Homeland his
[1:34:55] father is the king of the tribe and
[1:34:57] though away from home he conducts
[1:34:59] himself as the son of a king
[1:35:04] that's our goal in this life amen we may
[1:35:07] get treated the same we may suffer some
[1:35:09] of the same things when politics change
[1:35:11] and laws change we suffer like everybody
[1:35:13] else suffers
[1:35:14] when viruses sweep through they hit our
[1:35:17] body amen when old age Creeps in we get
[1:35:20] little creaks and pains and everything
[1:35:22] else that everybody else gets
[1:35:24] but we carry ourselves differently
[1:35:26] because we know where we came from and
[1:35:29] that we have a father and we can conduct
[1:35:31] ourselves in this slavery we can conduct
[1:35:34] ourselves as the Son and Daughter of a
[1:35:36] king
[1:35:37] and we can learn our lessons and we can
[1:35:39] grow and we can gain in character
[1:35:41] because power without character is
[1:35:43] satanic but but Power with character is
[1:35:49] and we've been predestinated to rule and
[1:35:52] reign with him for a thousand years
[1:35:56] we need to stop whining complaining
[1:35:58] crying and we need to just buckle down
[1:36:00] and say God teach me
[1:36:03] teach me
[1:36:05] mold me forgive me
[1:36:08] forgive me for my pride forgive me for
[1:36:11] my self-assertion into everything
[1:36:12] forgive me for trying to get Glory just
[1:36:15] forgive me Lord
[1:36:17] and help me to be a vessel that you can
[1:36:20] use
[1:36:21] Lord make me that dumb mute little tool
[1:36:25] and your toolbox
[1:36:27] that you use for your purpose when you
[1:36:29] choose to pick it up and how you choose
[1:36:32] to apply it
[1:36:34] I don't want to determine what you have
