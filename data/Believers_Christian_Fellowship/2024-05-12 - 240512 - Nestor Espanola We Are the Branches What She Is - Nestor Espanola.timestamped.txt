[15:20] [Music]
[15:24] sh is all
[15:27] [Music]
[15:31] amen I'd like to start off by wishing
[15:34] all the mothers a very happy Mother's
[15:35] day God bless you and thank you for all
[15:38] that you do for your families for all of
[15:41] us I was uh meditating this morning on
[15:44] what the comment brother Brandon made he
[15:46] said motherhood is the backbone of the
[15:48] nation so when you break motherhood
[15:50] you've broke the nation and and that
[15:53] statement is really interesting because
[15:55] the backbone in our body is what links
[15:58] everything together everything is
[15:59] connected by the backbone and that's
[16:01] what our mothers are in our families
[16:03] they are the connecting to connect
[16:04] everything not the headship but the
[16:07] connection of everything and so I
[16:10] thought praise the Lord that's such a
[16:11] good analogy brother bom always has the
[16:13] best amen and so we just thank we thank
[16:17] God for Godly sisters who will yield
[16:20] theirselves give up their lives to take
[16:22] the office of mother and what a
[16:24] privilege it is but it's a it's an
[16:26] office of privilege but it's also an
[16:27] office of sacrifice and we want to say
[16:29] God bless you for your sacrifice and we
[16:32] know without you amen if it's the
[16:33] backbone of a Nation it's the backbone
[16:35] of the family it's also the backbone of
[16:37] the families in the church and so we are
[16:39] all stronger because of Godly mothers
[16:41] and so we just want to say God bless you
[16:43] today and pray that God blesses you with
[16:45] a wonderful wonderful day I know it's
[16:49] sometimes hard because some have lost
[16:50] their mothers and sister Jenny recently
[16:53] lost her mother so it's it's a time of
[16:55] rejoicing and it's a happy time but
[16:56] there's also loss as well so we want to
[16:58] remember
[16:59] the wine Gardner family uh today as well
[17:02] we'll be praying for Sister Jenny and
[17:03] your family may the Lord bless you and
[17:06] you know not everybody's had the
[17:07] privilege of being a mother but if God
[17:10] has granted you that privilege just
[17:11] thank him for it and continue to give
[17:14] your life for it one thing's for sure we
[17:16] all had the privilege of having a mother
[17:18] and that's how God saw fit to bring us
[17:20] in this life and so we're thankful we
[17:22] all have something to celebrate amen
[17:25] also want to thank brother Tom for that
[17:27] song I really enjoyed the verse I had
[17:29] never heard the verses before and that
[17:31] last verse especially really spoke to me
[17:33] amen I thought that was
[17:35] wonderful also want to remind you the
[17:37] weekend meetings coming up this weekend
[17:39] brother Alistair will be coming in this
[17:41] week and uh we won't be I want to remind
[17:44] you we won't be having service Wednesday
[17:45] night we'll be having the youth service
[17:48] in the fellowship hall Thursday so
[17:49] that'll start everything in the
[17:51] fellowship hall Thursday at 700 p.m.
[17:52] with the youth then we'll be in here
[17:54] Friday at 700 p.m. Saturday morning will
[17:57] be the men's fellowship breakfast and
[17:58] Saturday evening at 6:30 p.m. we're
[18:00] going to go 30 minutes earlier here as
[18:02] well and then the regular service time
[18:04] at 10:30 Sunday morning so we pray that
[18:07] you'll be able to make it to all the
[18:09] services I'm I'm sure it'll be quite a
[18:10] blessing and if you could be in prayer
[18:13] this week that God will just move every
[18:14] hindrance out of the way God will move
[18:16] in brother Alistair with clear
[18:18] inspiration Direction and God will move

[22:10] branches and and I give it the subtitle
[22:13] of what she is it says here in John 15
[22:17] verse
[22:21] 5 I am the way I am the vine ye are the
[22:26] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[22:29] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[22:34] for
[22:37] without without me he can do nothing
[22:41] next verse in Revelation 10 verse 7
[22:46] to1 but in the days of the voice of the
[22:49] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[22:52] sound the mystery of God should be
[22:54] finished as he had declared to his
[22:57] servants the prophet
[22:59] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[23:02] spake unto me
[23:03] again and said go and take the little
[23:07] book which is open in the hand of the
[23:09] Angel which standed upon the sea and
[23:12] upon the Earth and I went unto the angel
[23:15] and said unto him give me the little
[23:18] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[23:22] it eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[23:26] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth out
[23:28] sweet as
[23:30] honey and I took the little book out of
[23:33] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it w
[23:37] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[23:41] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[23:44] was beer and he said unto me thou must
[23:48] prophesy again before many peoples and
[23:52] nation and tongues and Kings may the
[23:55] Lord had the blessing from the reading
[23:57] of the scripture you all may be
[24:03] seated praise the
[24:05] lord it's good to be in the house of the
[24:09] Lord I'm always uh
[24:12] glad the Lord make me a way to come here
[24:16] so I'm in Canada this time and this is
[24:20] my last leg so but next week I'll be
[24:24] going to Los Angeles and fly back home
[24:27] praise God so this is the first time
[24:29] that I I only stay in one Church in the
[24:33] in
[24:34] us and I like this church okay because
[24:38] CH you heard him said the
[24:42] lobby praise the Lord hallelujah see so
[24:48] last time last year when I came here so
[24:51] I preach about the promised rain and the
[24:53] promised light and then condemnation by
[24:56] representation so I wanted to wrap it up
[24:59] all praise God
[25:02] see H Allelujah so in that way you will
[25:05] understand uh you know um like like like
[25:10] the scriptures said you know and if we
[25:13] believe that uh John you know uh we
[25:17] always use John the Beloved in the Book
[25:19] of Revelation we type we type we type
[25:23] him uh in the church uh in the ages also
[25:27] as a bride you know so if praise God see
[25:32] so John need to eat the
[25:34] books but you need to eat it open not
[25:38] close Okay then once you ate it then you
[25:43] are commanded to prophesy again okay
[25:48] praise God see John was not commanded to
[25:52] preach he was proph he was
[25:56] commanded to prophesy
[25:58] okay praise the Lord hallelujah see
[26:03] now before we go on it says
[26:08] here see it says now remember this
[26:13] Christ in the true church is a
[26:15] continuation of the book of Acts see if
[26:19] the Holy Spirit if Christ is in us see
[26:23] meaning uh this church will be a
[26:26] continuation of the book of Acts see
[26:30] then but the Book of Revelation shows
[26:33] now how that the Antichrist spirit will
[26:36] come into the church and defile it
[26:39] making it look warm formal and Powerless
[26:43] see the Book of Revelation will tell you
[26:47] know it uh exposing to us okay what the
[26:51] devil is trying to do to the church see
[26:55] defile it see praise God Hallelujah
[26:59] attempted to attempted destruction of
[27:02] God's people and discrediting of God's
[27:05] word right down to the time he cast into
[27:08] the Lake of Fire see praise
[27:11] God and he don't like people to know it
[27:15] that's right right he doesn't like us to
[27:17] know it okay that's why he said he
[27:20] fights that that's right see he cannot
[27:24] stand
[27:26] it he knows that if the people get the
[27:30] true revelation of the true
[27:33] church and what she
[27:36] is
[27:38] okay praise God first time I heard that
[27:41] you know when brother Chad was in our
[27:43] place he said God the pro the message
[27:47] never said who she is but the message
[27:51] said what she is praise God see so I was
[27:57] curious you
[28:00] know you know the Philipino people they
[28:02] always smile okay they just smile and
[28:07] listen then we go when we go back home
[28:10] we try to we try to search it if it is
[28:14] true yes the prophet never said who she
[28:18] is praise God see he said what she is
[28:24] okay if if the bride will understand
[28:27] what what she is okay I give this a
[28:29] title we are the branches then I have
[28:32] this subtitle what she is meaning to say
[28:35] if you know what you
[28:37] are see it is not know who you
[28:40] are see but what you are praise God see
[28:46] if the bride will understand what she is
[28:49] what she stands for and what she can do
[28:53] then that she can do the Greater Works
[28:57] she will be an invincible
[28:59] Army okay once the bride understand what
[29:03] she
[29:04] is know what she is then she can do a
[29:08] greater work see until you know
[29:13] it you are living below your
[29:17] privilege right
[29:19] see if they can get if they can get a
[29:23] true revelation of the true Spirit
[29:25] within the framework of Christian church
[29:27] and God's spirit discern and withstand
[29:30] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[29:33] powerless before
[29:35] her see praise God so we only need to
[29:39] know what we
[29:42] are see if we know what we are then you
[29:46] can see praise God the power that's in
[29:49] our hand okay praise the Lord
[29:55] hallelujah see now we need to understand
[29:59] like I say you know praise God see this
[30:03] message like the prophet said this is a
[30:07] prophetic message I've been emphasizing
[30:10] it okay praise God see it says there men
[30:14] there are men one different from the
[30:17] other all together and in the ministry
[30:20] the Lord has given
[30:21] me most those men were theologians great
[30:26] teachers and Scholars mine is not mine's
[30:30] a more of a prophetic
[30:34] message the message that the that that
[30:37] the messenger is sharing to us is a
[30:39] prophetic
[30:41] message see when you say it's a
[30:43] prophetic message it has something to do
[30:47] on the things that's happening before
[30:50] yesterday today
[30:53] andever
[30:55] forever see praise God and the way I
[30:59] think Divine Healing is the work at the
[31:01] cross that has been completed for you
[31:04] and if you'll just only recognize it you
[31:08] can receive it then the next verse the
[31:11] next quote it says here in the fourth
[31:13] seal and now the first we could just
[31:16] give you scripture after scripture see
[31:20] that the last age is a prophetic message
[31:24] to the
[31:25] church calling them back to the original
[31:28] word the prophetic message will take us
[31:32] back to the pure word of God see praise
[31:38] God Amen
[31:41] Hallelujah see that's why this message
[31:44] you know it's it is it keep on unfolding
[31:48] it's
[31:49] Progressive see praise God hallelujah
[31:54] see meaning to say you know we are a
[31:58] upgrading okay
[32:01] hallelujah praise God
[32:04] see we we we need to move forward so
[32:07] then because this is a prophetic
[32:10] message then the me the prophet said
[32:14] praise God see you now okay I'm reading
[32:18] this quotation okay I put it there in
[32:21] that way uh you will uh sometimes you
[32:24] know your accent is different from my
[32:26] accent okay you have an
[32:29] accent Hallelujah so now there you can
[32:33] read it
[32:35] Hallelujah see you will recall that I
[32:38] mentioned at the beginning of this
[32:40] message that this book we are studying
[32:44] is the actual revelation of Jesus of
[32:48] Jesus himself in the church amen his
[32:52] work in the church in the future age
[32:55] amen see praise God then I mention that
[33:00] it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[33:02] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[33:06] praise God hallelujah
[33:09] see that's in the message of the
[33:11] revelation of Jesus Christ the message
[33:14] the messenger is try okay I'm using the
[33:17] word messenger okay because sometimes if
[33:20] you if I use the prophet
[33:23] Hallelujah sometimes it's not easy for
[33:26] the to some listener because I know this
[33:29] going online
[33:31] okay
[33:33] Hallelujah see it's been telling us the
[33:39] message Christ Jesus is trying to reveal
[33:42] what he is
[33:44] doing see in his church and the F future
[33:49] thing that he is going to do in his
[33:51] church that's why I told you it's
[33:54] Progressive see he did something before
[33:58] he did something in his time and he is
[34:01] going to do something in our time also
[34:05] praise God what he did before what he
[34:08] did then praise God there is something
[34:11] that is going to do something praise God
[34:15] progressively am praise God in our time
[34:20] Hallelujah see Hallelujah but then it
[34:24] says I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[34:27] Spirit to give us Revelation or we will
[34:30] fail to get it see bringing these two
[34:34] thoughts together you will see that it
[34:37] won't take just ordinary
[34:39] study and thinking to make this B this
[34:43] book real it is going to take the
[34:46] operation of the Holy
[34:48] Ghost that means this book cannot be Ral
[34:52] to
[34:53] anyone but a special class of people
[34:57] amen thank you Lord it will take one
[35:00] with prophetic Insight
[35:04] also praise God see the prophet said the
[35:08] his message a prophetic praise God
[35:13] message so we need also a prophetic
[35:16] Insight praise God it will require the
[35:20] ability to hear from God see it says it
[35:24] required to hear the to the ability to
[35:27] hear from God you know that's why he
[35:29] said this is only for the special class
[35:32] of people because only the sheep can
[35:35] hear can follow his
[35:37] voice praise God hallelujah then it will
[35:42] require Supernatural
[35:44] instruction not just a student comparing
[35:47] verse with verse though that is
[35:51] good but a mystery requires the teaching
[35:54] of the spirit or it never becomes
[35:59] clear how we need to hear from God and
[36:02] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[36:05] the spirit to hear and know Hallelujah
[36:18] see so it take okay it will take one
[36:22] prophetic uh with with prophetic Insight
[36:25] okay praise God hallelujah amen so
[36:30] then Jesus need to change his ministry
[36:34] also okay it says as it was in the days
[36:38] of
[36:39] Noah so it shall be in the coming of the
[36:42] son of
[36:44] man they
[36:47] were they were eating drinking marrying
[36:52] giving in
[36:53] marrying and as it was in the days of
[36:56] lot so it shall be in the hours that the
[36:58] son of man will be revealed on Earth
[37:02] okay no not Son of God no more that's
[37:08] right yes see I've been emphasizing this
[37:11] everywhere I go that we are not in the
[37:14] Son of God Ministry anymore amen see we
[37:18] are in the son of
[37:20] man
[37:22] Ministry amen praise God come back as
[37:25] the prophetic message for the last day
[37:28] when that eagle will be flying not the
[37:31] lion not the ox in the sacrifice AGS see
[37:36] then it says hallelujah next praise God
[37:41] I'm quoting to quote from different
[37:44] books in that way you know we have two
[37:47] witnesses okay praise God
[37:51] hallelujah see he says I challenge this
[37:55] whole audience in the name name of Jesus
[37:58] Christ if you could if your conscience

[38:42] mystery praise God so he needs to come

[38:49] reveal the mystery amen okay it is not
[38:52] brother branam who's revealing it praise
[38:56] God hallelujah see at the opening of the
[38:59] seals praise the Lord hallelujah it is
[39:03] not brother branam who rebuild the
[39:05] mystery amen see it is now the son of
[39:09] man Ministry who rebuil it and brother
[39:12] Braham heard it and he just said it
[39:15] praise God see where it is now he said
[39:19] now in the form of the Propet prophetic

[40:07] the minister let your people read the
[40:10] message don't you worry they will not

[40:17] element that it was it was only given to
[40:20] the minister see the messenger said
[40:23] because they are to feed the flu see

[1:10:11] Brother G you know him the this the the
[1:10:14] building
[1:10:15] Stone say when I look at it it's a
[1:10:19] topical topical uh
[1:10:23] quotation I said this is nice
[1:10:27] see everybody has a part okay amen
[1:10:31] praise God if only you know I've been
[1:10:35] telling it to the minister if only we
[1:10:37] will not feel
[1:10:38] insecured praise God hallelujah God used
[1:10:42] a five-fold Ministry amen see praise God
[1:10:47] hallelujah
[1:11:02] that's why the message that we
[1:11:04] receive this is a prophetic message
[1:11:07] meaning to say it will keep on revealing
[1:11:10] revealing what we need to know in our
[1:11:12] time see so these things happen signs
[1:11:16] and wonders why it's now quieting down
[1:11:19] then the message reveal it because he
[1:11:21] said all the seed has been sown praise
[1:11:24] God hallelujah
[1:11:26] see nothing will be
[1:11:29] produced what seed has been sown you
[1:11:32] will produce the fruits amen praise God

[1:11:39] this uh when this message okay praise
[1:11:43] God see when you receive the
[1:11:47] message Hallelujah
[1:11:50] okay it need to be ripened that's why
[1:11:53] the people I told you
[1:11:57] it connect all the Loose Ends right amen
[1:12:00] the mystery of justification the mystery
[1:12:03] of sanctification The Mystery of the
[1:12:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:12:09] hallelujah see it will it will be
[1:12:12] rebuilt to us it will be revealed to
[1:12:15] us see then if you have remember this if
[1:12:20] the seed that we
[1:12:22] receive is the present Tru or the
[1:12:25] message of the
[1:12:28] hour that's why I've been telling it to
[1:12:30] the minister you don't need to tell the
[1:12:33] people to live a holy
[1:12:37] life if for 20 years for more than I
[1:12:39] think 50 years now this
[1:12:42] BCF if the pastor keep on telling you to
[1:12:45] live a holy life there is something
[1:12:47] there is something wrong with
[1:12:48] you or there is something wrong with the
[1:12:52] minister see
[1:12:55] just teach them the opening of the
[1:12:59] word see because once the seed appear
[1:13:03] praise God you know the plant right
[1:13:06] Hallelujah see we have the leaves we
[1:13:10] have the stock then we have the shock
[1:13:12] then we have the seed right once the
[1:13:15] seed appear then it it was it it was
[1:13:19] exposed to the sunlight what will the
[1:13:22] seed do he will suck the life of the Li
[1:13:25] he will sack the lives of
[1:13:28] the of the stock he will sack the life
[1:13:31] of the
[1:13:33] Shar that's why all of that plan will
[1:13:35] become
[1:13:37] Brown why it's
[1:13:40] dead see praise God hallelujah if we can
[1:13:45] receive the sunlight then we will able
[1:13:48] to receive the message of justification
[1:13:51] we will able to receive the message of
[1:13:54] San sanctification
[1:13:55] ification it is not become our problem
[1:13:58] because sanctification Now isn't in us
[1:14:02] see until until even the life that is in
[1:14:07] the
[1:14:08] root that is the last thing praise God
[1:14:12] that that seed will do it will suck the
[1:14:15] life that is in the root now the seed
[1:14:18] become life that's right see even if you
[1:14:23] plant that plant with the root it will
[1:14:27] not grow anymore it has no life but look
[1:14:32] at that small seed if you plant it yes
[1:14:36] you can see the life because all the
[1:14:38] life will go into
[1:14:41] the
[1:14:42] seed the life of the seed is the life of
[1:14:45] the plant amen
[1:14:48] hallelujah see so that is our
[1:14:51] principle okay so that's why the message
[1:14:54] said okay next it says
[1:14:58] here I'm laying down the foundation okay
[1:15:01] so in that way you will understand what
[1:15:03] we are trying to what we are trying to
[1:15:05] say see now this messenger of Malachi 4
[1:15:08] and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:15:11] things one according to Malachi Malachi

[1:25:09] no problem with Adam Adam knew what's

[1:25:46] and that every imagination of the
[1:25:48] thought of his heart was only evil

[1:27:32] Israel bearing the first fruit of the
[1:27:34] Fig Tree praise God hallelujah see then
[1:27:38] God gave them the law okay the law

[1:28:40] seed in
[1:28:43] Israel that's why he he's not doing it

[1:33:14] was now he Prov it you want you want you
[1:33:18] want proof of it he said I am the Bine
[1:33:21] now he's connecting it to that scripture
[1:33:23] I am the vine you are the branches see
[1:33:28] the bridegroom is the vine the bride
[1:33:31] tree is the branch amen praise God St
[1:33:36] John saying it I am the Bine you are the
[1:33:39] branches you bear the fruit see and the
[1:33:42] male tree and the female tree produces
[1:33:45] the pollen one to one another brings the
[1:33:47] fruit and the branch and the vine does
[1:33:50] the same thing see that's exactly right

[1:35:02] scriptural yes it is because I am the
[1:35:06] bind Jesus said the perfect proper tree

[1:35:12] is the
[1:35:15] branches
[1:35:17] Hallelujah see praise
[1:35:22] God the branch will produce the
[1:35:26] fruits Hallelujah he we are God's fruit
[1:35:30] bearers and I believe in in St John 17
[1:35:34] chapter Jesus said ye are the branches
[1:35:37] and he was the vine the Bine puts for
[1:35:40] the fruit but the branches has to Bear
[1:35:42] the
[1:35:44] fruits Hallelujah not the
[1:35:47] vine but the fruits is in the
[1:35:51] vine Hallelujah
[1:35:54] if the branch is getting its life out of
[1:35:57] the vine well it's the same kind of life
[1:35:59] that's in the
[1:36:01] vine see now praise God okay if this is
[1:36:06] the Bine
[1:36:08] okay the branch has no
[1:36:11] life all the life is in the
[1:36:15] vine praise
[1:36:17] God the fruit is in the
[1:36:20] vine but the fruits will not appear
[1:36:24] see yeah you know sometimes we don't
[1:36:27] understand why God is using the metaphor
[1:36:29] of tree and fruit and
[1:36:32] Seed praise God and I I don't understand
[1:36:36] it also until praise God you know there
[1:36:40] is one brother praise God who preached
[1:36:42] that he said you know that the Hebrew
[1:36:44] word came from a
[1:36:46] pictograph I said what is that
[1:36:49] pictograph praise God he said all the
[1:36:51] Hebrew word came from a pictograph
[1:36:54] okay like I'm have Chinese you know I
[1:36:58] can I can read Chinese
[1:37:01] character a few
[1:37:05] okay and we were we were taught in the
[1:37:08] school you know the Chinese character
[1:37:10] come from a pictograph praise God see
[1:37:13] and here it is okay praise God the word
[1:37:18] prophecy came from a came from two pict
[1:37:21] to graph
[1:37:24] the picture of a seed and a picture of a
[1:37:27] tent or a house praise God see it
[1:37:32] says praise God
[1:37:36] now according to the you know to the old
[1:37:39] Hebrew language prophecy says a fruit
[1:37:43] produced from the inside of a man see a
[1:37:48] prophecy it is a fruit produced where
[1:37:52] inside the B
[1:37:55] okay not in the branch it was produced
[1:37:58] there but it need to come
[1:38:01] out praise God it will coming out where
[1:38:05] in the branch that's right praise God so
[1:38:09] now if this is the perfect bridegroom
[1:38:12] tree the bride tree will be the branch
[1:38:15] Okay then if this is a perfect Prophet
[1:38:18] Prophet Tre now the branch will also be
[1:38:21] a
[1:38:22] prophet amen okay praise God but then
[1:38:26] the seed the fruit is in the
[1:38:30] vine see it will not come out until the
[1:38:34] branch appear so when the branch appear
[1:38:38] praise God the fruit will push out will
[1:38:40] coming out praise God that's why the
[1:38:42] meaning of the Prophet you know they
[1:38:46] call it the young people noie
[1:38:50] noobs I was surprised see
[1:38:54] you
[1:38:56] noobs it's a good
[1:38:58] word noobs means
[1:39:01] Prophet I was surprised you
[1:39:04] know
[1:39:06] Hallelujah and he is the one who will
[1:39:09] bring forth the inner
[1:39:12] fruits he will produce he will show the
[1:39:15] fruits and then in the fruits there are
[1:39:19] seed to
[1:39:21] S to prophesy
[1:39:25] okay
[1:39:27] Hallelujah see that's why in our age
[1:39:31] praise God see we have this perfect
[1:39:35] Prophet Tre now we have a prophet who
[1:39:38] bring out the fruit
[1:39:41] see he just bring out the fruit from the
[1:39:45] vine from a from the son of man see the
[1:39:49] son of man is telling us is showing us
[1:39:52] the fruit and we cannot understand it
[1:39:55] until the branch appear when the branch
[1:39:57] appear now come the fruits and then he
[1:40:01] saw it yeah that's right amen and we
[1:40:04] call it spoken word booklet amen okay
[1:40:10] praise God
[1:40:12] hallelujah see that's why the message
[1:40:16] okay the Bible said but in the days of
[1:40:19] the voice of the seventh angel but in
[1:40:21] the days of the voice of a prophet
[1:40:24] see when he shall begin to sound the
[1:40:27] mystery the mystery the prophet always
[1:40:30] the prophet will reveal the mystery
[1:40:32] praise God of God should be finished as
[1:40:35] he had declared to his servant the
[1:40:37] prophet then a voice which I heard from
[1:40:40] Heaven speak unto me again and said go
[1:40:43] and take the book little book which is
[1:40:45] open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:40:47] standed upon the sea and upon the W upon
[1:40:49] the Earth and I went unto the angel and
[1:40:51] said unto him give me the little book
[1:40:55] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:40:57] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:40:59] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:41:02] honey then he said and I took the little
[1:41:05] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[1:41:07] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:41:10] and as soon as I had I had eaten my
[1:41:14] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:41:18] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:41:21] people Nation TKS and Kings okay praise
[1:41:25] God hallelujah that's why at the opening
[1:41:28] of the
[1:41:30] seals
[1:41:32] see we have a messenger we have a
[1:41:36] prophet revealing us the
[1:41:38] fruits praise
[1:41:40] God and we are commanded to eat that
[1:41:44] book that open book that's why if you
[1:41:47] cannot see the opening of the seals
[1:41:49] that's where the problem
[1:41:51] is hallelujah
[1:41:55] see some people cannot see it I don't
[1:41:59] you
[1:42:00] know like I say that's not my problem
[1:42:03] okay they cannot see it but here we
[1:42:08] believe it that the seven seal is
[1:42:11] open right that the seven seal is open
[1:42:15] if you cannot believe that the seven
[1:42:16] seal is open praise God meaning to say
[1:42:19] you cannot
[1:42:21] prophesy see because the opening of The
[1:42:24] Seven seal is the revealing of the
[1:42:26] fruits is the revealing of the prophecy
[1:42:28] is the revealing of the
[1:42:30] mystery praise God see you cannot
[1:42:34] prophesy
[1:42:36] okay unless it is a
[1:42:39] mystery am
[1:42:42] Hallelujah see and you can only prophesy
[1:42:46] unless you are a
[1:42:51] prophet and if our first fruits like I
[1:42:55] say is a prophet the whole
[1:43:00] crap is also a prophet
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:05] see
[1:43:09] Hallelujah see that's why we can
[1:43:13] prophesy do you understand it yes sir

[1:56:13] trying to build the third

[1:56:49] said Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:56:51] church okay praise God

[1:56:57] now he said I'm going to build a temple
[1:57:01] I'm going to build my church I'm going
[1:57:03] to build my
[1:57:05] house right praise God but then Jesus
[1:57:09] said how be it the most high dwelleth
[1:57:12] not in the temples made with hands as as
[1:57:15] said the prophet Heaven is my throne and
[1:57:18] Earth is is my foot stol what house will
[1:57:21] you build me said the Lord or what is
[1:57:24] the place of my rest see imagine God
[1:57:28] wants to build a temple hallelujah how
[1:57:33] big it is he said the Earth is my Throne
[1:57:36] the Earth is the the heaven is my Throne
[1:57:39] the Earth is my foot stol so it's a very
[1:57:41] big
[1:57:42] Temple right praise God hallelujah and
[1:57:48] now we saw that the seven Church ages
[1:57:50] that is the body
[1:57:52] okay praise the Lord then praise God he
[1:57:57] said the temple that is going to make it
[1:58:00] must be from Heaven to Earth yes praise
[1:58:05] God see that's why Hallelujah in the
[1:58:08] Book of Revelation the seven Church ages
[1:58:12] you know he said
[1:58:15] it it was finished with the with the
[1:58:18] door
[1:58:20] closed behold I stand at the door and
[1:58:23] knock if anyone hear my voice and open
[1:58:26] the door I will come into him and will
[1:58:28] sh with him and he with me to him that
[1:58:31] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:58:33] in my Throne see so now he's talking
[1:58:36] about a throne praise God hallelujah so
[1:58:39] the seven Church ages the loudan age was
[1:58:43] finished with a closed door okay but
[1:58:47] then in in Revelation chap 4 after this
[1:58:50] I look and behold a door was open in
[1:58:52] heaven the the door on Earth is already
[1:58:55] closed but there is a door in heaven
[1:58:58] that was open okay praise God hallelujah
[1:59:03] so this seven Church ages it was
[1:59:06] finished with a closed door now you need
[1:59:09] to overcome that closed door how can you
[1:59:12] overcome it he said praise God
[1:59:15] hallelujah if anyone hear my voice again
[1:59:20] it's about hearing the voice of God
[1:59:24] those who those who have the prophetic
[1:59:26] Revelation they can hear the voice of
[1:59:29] God that's they have the ability to
[1:59:32] listen to hear to follow the voice of
[1:59:35] God see that's why the prophet said the
[1:59:38] where we are we are now sitting where in
[1:59:40] the Heavenly places what are what are we
[1:59:44] doing there we are
[1:59:46] eating St with me praise God hallelujah
[1:59:51] see so the bride where we are now we are
[1:59:54] in the Heavenly places sitting what we
[1:59:57] are doing there we are we are eating
[2:00:00] with him Hallelujah this all this
[2:00:04] mystery praise the Lord see that's why
[2:00:07] at the opening of the seals Hallelujah
[2:00:10] I've been telling it at the opening of
[2:00:12] The Seals All The Mystery of God see he
[2:00:17] been he been showing he been revealed to
[2:00:19] us the mystery of the justification
[2:00:22] message right Hallelujah see praise God
[2:00:28] next it says
[2:00:30] here notice it is not revealed until
[2:00:34] this book is not revealed until the
[2:00:36] church ages and denominational Ages was
[2:00:38] run out and there's time no more see
[2:00:42] it's only revealed after church ages
[2:00:44] denominational age ages has run out
[2:00:47] that's the reason the thing is in such a
[2:00:49] scruple tonight see that's why we have
[2:00:53] so many okay we have so many that's the
[2:00:58] reason we have so many
[2:01:00] doctrines praise God because the seal is
[2:01:03] not yet
[2:01:04] open praise God see what what will the
[2:01:08] seal do it says here but those mystery
[2:01:12] are promised okay but those mystery are
[2:01:15] promised to be revealed in the end time
[2:01:18] it's little loose ends that these great
[2:01:20] warriors has come on the same OS Martin
[2:01:24] St Martin polycarp and different ones
[2:01:26] Luther Westy and all this see as how
[2:01:30] they have come and just live long enough
[2:01:32] to kind of bring a light a light and
[2:01:35] shine it but they left many things in
[2:01:37] the darkness see meaning to say we don't
[2:01:42] have enough praise God light we don't
[2:01:44] have enough Revelation to understand it
[2:01:47] until this age right at the opening of
[2:01:50] the seals praise God hallelujah see
[2:01:54] that's why that's why the prophet said
[2:01:57] see we are Justified yes we are always
[2:02:01] saved he is not saving us that's why in
[2:02:04] the in the midst the future homes we are
[2:02:06] always
[2:02:08] saved see how can he save us he said he
[2:02:11] never he he do not save us he we are
[2:02:14] always
[2:02:15] saved he's redeeming
[2:02:18] us see not saving us praise God

[2:04:27] them when they come out they will say
[2:04:30] this is the
[2:04:33] mystery they don't know anything about
[2:04:35] the
[2:04:37] blood yeah they have no idea about the
[2:04:43] blood said why did you save
[2:04:47] us yeah

[2:04:53] the beginning we don't we don't have the

[2:37:44] forward Amen brother brandom said that
[2:37:47] all that Christ was he poured into the

[2:37:55] he
[2:37:57] amen whatever he was when he was on
[2:38:00] earth now through the branches he's
[2:38:03] manifesting the same thing say God help
[2:38:06] us to abide in the vine and surrender
[2:38:10] our life and let him flow his life out
[2:38:13] through us and when it says prophesy
[2:38:17] again if we look through the Bible the
[2:38:19] Bible is the record of the prophecy of
[2:38:22] the
[2:38:23] prophets it's written of the prophets
[2:38:25] all the way through the Old Testament
[2:38:26] and coming up into the new amen and
[2:38:29] every one of them was
[2:38:31] resisted rejected persecuted but their
[2:38:35] prophecy changed the course of history
[2:38:38] what they said changed lives what they
[2:38:41] said brought God's manifestation on the
[2:38:43] earth what they spoke amen became
[2:38:46] reality to a people
[2:38:49] what's our job after we've eaten the
[2:38:51] open book to prophesy again am what can
[2:38:54] we expect probably everything the
[2:38:56] prophets had before and what Jesus
[2:38:58] Christ suffered with but you know that
[2:39:00] word won't return into him void but
[2:39:03] it'll accomplish what he's sent and out
[2:39:05] to do amen when we speak the word it's
[2:39:08] got a power when we speak the mystery of
[2:39:10] God revealed it has its own life and its
[2:39:12] own power and it'll accomplish its own
[2:39:16] work we're not looking for our power to
[2:39:19] do anything it's the power of the spoken
[2:39:22] word help us to keep speaking this true
[2:39:25] word this revelation of the hour and
[2:39:27] share it with whoever we here may God
[2:39:30] help us may God help us to be a true
