TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the whole purpose of elohim coming down in a body of flesh to perform the sign of the messiah was to get sarah to believe that she's the one and this word is true and the time is now and god has sent a prophet in our day and it was none other than god himself operating through that tabernacle of flesh with feet that could be washed and could eat amen it could converse with you and could walk down the road amen it was god tabernacled in a body of flesh and that flesh was his prophet william branham and he would turn his back to the crowd and begin to discern the thoughts of the people here and over here and in the balcony showing the sign of the messiah not to show off a sign not to show off the gift but to get to sarah to believe that it's you you're the one the promise is for you and the time is now why did you hear and see that sign why are you the one who got the tape and there's millions out there that didn't get the tape why are you the one who got to see prophet visit south africa read prophet fit to south africa why are you the one that got to see 20th century prophet and deep call it to the deed millions have seen it millions haven't seen it millions have seen and rejected it but something in you said that's the truth that's god a man can't do that that's god and it wasn't done so you can say that's god and i've seen god in flesh and god come in flesh but god come in flesh for a purpose and that purpose was to bring sarah's faith up a little bit higher because sarah was doubting because of her condition praise god i hope we can stop doubting because of our condition it has nothing to do with our condition god has already sent a word to change our condition he had already brought us from death unto life abraham's seed was dead sarah's wound was dead but in the visitation of elohim he was going to bring a resurrection from the dead and this is a resurrection ministry this is a resurrection hour it's the raising up of the word it's the raising up of the bride everything was dead when elohim came to them the word had been laying dead for years the seed word that was in abraham has been laying dead for years the bride was stuck in formalism and reasoning stuck in an old thinking in an old condition that i being old can't bring forth life everything was dead when elohim and flesh came on this earth and the purpose of elohim coming in flesh was to quicken them to life to bring them back to the condition where the seed can be given and the seed can be received
