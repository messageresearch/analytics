[10:02] your name
[10:07] let's pray together
[10:10] precious Lord Jesus we just want to
[10:13] pause here Lord to thank you once again
[10:16] for this opportunity to gather together
[10:19] Lord we know that the days are numbered
[10:22] and the times are numbered that we'll
[10:24] have this opportunity Lord so
[10:26] while it is here we want to offer
[10:28] Thanksgiving for that we want to take
[10:30] full advantage of that Lord
[10:33] we just ask Lord that you would come
[10:35] tonight
[10:36] that you would accomplish that which
[10:39] you've purposed ordained this service to
[10:41] be Lord
[10:42] father normally we would maybe in the
[10:46] past ask that you would come in to help
[10:48] us Lord to help us to speak and to help
[10:50] us to hear father but the age is growing
[10:54] so dark and so deceiving and so
[10:57] treacherous Lord that we know that that
[10:59] won't even suffice anymore father so we
[11:01] would ask that you would come and be the
[11:04] speaker tonight father that you would
[11:07] come and be the hearer tonight Lord for
[11:10] we know that that's the only thing that
[11:12] will work and that will stand the test
[11:14] of time
[11:15] so we just commit ourselves to you Lord
[11:17] Jesus once again thankful for the
[11:20] opportunity to be here and to worship
[11:21] you with people of like Precious Faith
[11:24] Lord we just ask that you would have
[11:26] your way now in Jesus Christ's name amen
[11:31] God bless you good to be with you
[11:33] tonight if you have your
[11:35] Bible will turn to Hebrews
[11:39] chapter 12. thank you musicians
[11:49] Hebrews chapter 12.
[11:52] and
[11:54] I have a
[11:55] thought that I would like to
[11:58] uh
[11:59] take a peck at I guess you would say
[12:01] because we're certainly not going to
[12:03] accomplish everything
[12:06] but I have this thought for sake of for
[12:09] the sake of a title we'll call it called
[12:12] to Mount Zion
[12:14] and there's just something that's open
[12:18] to me and I shared this with some of you
[12:20] that was over at Christmas and I've not
[12:22] made much Headway since then I'm still
[12:25] pretty much lost in the putting all the
[12:27] pieces together but I see enough to at
[12:30] least start putting a few pieces
[12:32] together and we'll just have to trust
[12:33] the Lord to do the rest and to put the
[12:36] rest together at the appropriate time
[12:37] whenever that may be
[12:39] but uh I'm not really prone to
[12:42] nervousness when I'm ministering or
[12:44] before people but this is something that
[12:46] I can kind of relate to
[12:48] our pastor on Sunday he was feeling that
[12:52] he couldn't put everything together that
[12:53] the way he wanted to and I said that's
[12:55] very very much the way that I'm feeling
[12:58] is just I I've seen the picture and the
[13:01] Lord had dropped it in my heart but I
[13:03] just to put it out into words and
[13:06] especially to explain it to some to
[13:07] where somebody else will see it I just
[13:09] don't know
[13:10] that I'm capable so if I go extra slow
[13:15] tonight or if you have me pausing for a
[13:19] little bit I'm okay I'm doing that on
[13:21] purpose I I don't want to start chasing
[13:24] a bunch of rabbit Trails on this I want
[13:25] to try to teach it more so but with his
[13:29] grace that's what we'll do so
[13:31] everything's fine if I just slow down a
[13:34] little bit
[13:35] um Hebrews 12 verse 1 says wherefore
[13:39] seeing we also are compassed about with
[13:41] so great a cloud of witnesses
[13:44] let us lay aside every weight and the
[13:47] sin which doth so easily beset us
[13:50] and let us run with patience the race
[13:53] that is set before us
[13:55] looking unto Jesus the author and
[13:59] finisher of our faith
[14:01] who for the joy that was set before him
[14:03] endured the cross
[14:05] despising the shame and is set down at
[14:08] the right hand
[14:09] of the Throne of God and let's skip down
[14:12] to verse 12 now
[14:15] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[14:18] down
[14:19] and the feeble knees and make straight
[14:23] paths for your feet lest that witch's
[14:26] Lane be turned out of the way but let it
[14:28] rather be healed
[14:30] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[14:32] which out without which no man shall see
[14:36] the Lord
[14:37] looking diligently lest any man fell of
[14:40] the grace of God lest any root of
[14:42] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[14:45] thereby many be defiled
[14:48] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[14:51] person
[14:52] as Esau who for one more soul of meat
[14:55] sold his Birthright
[14:57] for ye know how that afterward when he
[15:00] would have inherited the blessing he was
[15:03] rejected for he found no place of
[15:05] repentance though he sought it carefully
[15:07] with tears
[15:11] for ye are not come unto the mount that
[15:14] might be touched
[15:16] and that burned with fire nor unto
[15:19] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[15:23] the sound of a trumpet and the sound of
[15:25] Words which voice they heard not he's
[15:27] referring to Israel here which voice
[15:30] they heard not
[15:31] I'm sorry that they heard and treated
[15:34] that the word should not be spoken to
[15:36] them anymore
[15:38] for they could not endure that which was
[15:41] commanded and if so much as a beast
[15:43] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[15:45] or thrust through with a dart
[15:48] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[15:51] said I exceedingly fear and Quake
[15:55] but ye are come unto Mount Zion
[15:59] and unto the city of the Living God the
[16:02] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[16:05] company of angels to the general
[16:08] assembly and the father of the and the
[16:10] Church of the firstborn born which are
[16:13] written in heaven and to God the judge
[16:15] of all and to the spirits of just men
[16:16] made perfect and to Jesus the mediator
[16:20] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[16:22] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[16:25] than that of Abel may God add his
[16:28] Blessing to the reading of his word as
[16:30] you would take your seats
[16:34] so Paul is speaking here
[16:41] and he's saying that you are not called
[16:45] to the same thing that Israel was called
[16:48] to
[16:50] and he expounds on that
[16:53] by revealing that Israel was a nation
[16:56] and they were called to a natural
[16:59] Mountain
[17:01] they were called to
[17:03] everything being natural they were a
[17:06] natural people with a natural land we
[17:09] know at the end time they end with a
[17:11] natural number 144 000. so
[17:15] Paul is differentiating
[17:19] that that is not we what we as Gentiles
[17:24] are called to
[17:26] but he just doesn't leave that to our
[17:28] own interpretation
[17:30] he after tells us that we're not called
[17:34] to a natural mountain or a natural
[17:37] physical piece of ground to stand on he
[17:40] says you are called to Mount Zion
[17:44] and unto the city of the Living God the
[17:48] heavenly Jerusalem
[17:51] and to an innumerable company of angels
[17:53] so you see he immediately starts delving
[17:56] into the spiritual world
[17:59] so we're not called to Natural things
[18:01] we're called to spiritual things
[18:04] and we know these principles
[18:07] to an innumerable company of angels to
[18:10] the general assembly and Church of the
[18:12] firstborn
[18:13] which are written in heaven and to God
[18:15] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[18:19] just men made perfect and to Jesus the
[18:21] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[18:23] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[18:26] things than that of Abel
[18:29] so in a nutshell he tells us you're not
[18:33] called as Israel was called
[18:34] you're not a natural people you're a
[18:36] spiritual people don't look at the
[18:38] carnal Natural Things focus on the
[18:40] spiritual things if I'm interpreting
[18:42] that correctly
[18:44] and we know that this is what brother
[18:45] random taught us
[18:47] um that the Jews were all natural people
[18:50] the Gentiles were spiritual people
[18:52] called for his namesake we know that
[18:54] brother Branham taught us that that was
[18:56] what God desired even before the Earth
[18:59] was created in the back part of his mind
[19:02] he wanted a spiritual Gentile bride he
[19:06] foreshadowed a lot of things through a
[19:08] natural bride a natural Church through
[19:10] Israel but in the back part of his mind
[19:12] he wanted that spiritual Gentile bride
[19:14] of his own choosing
[19:17] so I've had brother Franco put this up
[19:19] here
[19:20] this is the picture that blew up in my
[19:24] mind that I'm trying to put all the
[19:26] pieces together it's based off this 11
[19:28] series of services here that brother
[19:30] Brandon preached
[19:32] and this was drawn to my attention uh
[19:34] brother Franco if you don't care to do
[19:36] with the lights what you did last time
[19:37] that would be really great thank you
[19:40] um this was drawn to my attention
[19:41] because as I was studying and reading
[19:44] this series
[19:45] there were some
[19:49] I don't even know what you would call
[19:51] them but there were comments that
[19:54] brother Branham would drop in as he's
[19:57] preaching this series that they just
[20:01] stuck with me and I couldn't shake them
[20:02] and one of them uh
[20:06] is
[20:07] a statement that he makes a few times
[20:10] during his ministry and he would make
[20:13] the comment when I would go out into
[20:15] these meetings I don't usually preach
[20:16] Doctrine when I go out there you know I
[20:18] respect the other men's pulpits I go out
[20:20] I preach something evangelistical
[20:21] something usually shallow or faith
[20:24] building something of that nature
[20:26] and I usually don't teach on deep things
[20:29] or doctrinal things
[20:31] and he's he made that a few times but in
[20:34] uh
[20:35] just prior to this series that he
[20:38] preached he's at Jeffersonville and he
[20:41] makes that same type of comment you'll
[20:42] forgive me for not having the quote I
[20:44] could not find it today
[20:46] um
[20:47] but I'm sure somebody will be able to
[20:50] find it and send it to me and when you
[20:51] do I'll give you a cash reward
[20:53] but it drives me nuts when I know it's
[20:57] there and cannot find it just because I
[20:59] can't put an apostrophe at the right
[21:00] place or you know how it goes but the
[21:04] thing that Drew my attention to it is
[21:06] when he made this comment he says I
[21:09] don't usually do those things I don't
[21:11] have any intentions of doing those
[21:12] things but then he followed that up with
[21:14] unless he tells me to do something
[21:19] and it just struck me with the tone of
[21:23] voice and the way he said it it was
[21:25] almost like
[21:26] he knew what was getting ready to happen
[21:29] and that it was going to be different
[21:31] than what he normally did
[21:35] um so it was almost if you would say
[21:36] like a warning
[21:38] um heads up I don't usually do and
[21:41] operate this way but something's changed
[21:43] and if he tells me to do something
[21:46] differently well then I'm going to do
[21:48] something differently
[21:49] and what he was getting at is he was
[21:51] basically respecting the other ministers
[21:53] that he would be preaching at churches
[21:55] he didn't want to step on their toes
[21:57] doctrinally and just tell things the way
[21:59] they are now we know there were times
[22:01] that brother Branham did that but as a
[22:04] general operating role he generally
[22:06] didn't do that if he was going to preach
[22:09] anything deep or doctrinally or teaching
[22:11] wise he came back to the Tabernacle and
[22:13] did that
[22:14] so he made that comment just prior to
[22:17] these services
[22:19] and it just stuck in my mind so
[22:23] when that was the first thing that
[22:26] happened and then the second thing that
[22:27] happened is as I was going through uh
[22:31] this series of services it became very
[22:33] apparent to me that he is clearly
[22:37] deviated away from
[22:40] his normal pattern because if you listen
[22:42] to these messages
[22:44] like he's not holding anything back it's
[22:48] very raw very direct
[22:50] um
[22:52] it's very straightforward
[22:55] so
[22:57] he kind of gave a warning to something
[22:59] and then he did it that was the second
[23:03] thing that caught my attention the third
[23:05] thing that caught my attention is as
[23:07] he's doing these services and I'll read
[23:10] some of these quotes here in just a
[23:11] second he starts predicting what he's
[23:14] going to preach next
[23:16] which is kind of unusual
[23:20] um
[23:20] but he'll come to one service and he'll
[23:23] announce the title and then he'll just
[23:24] he'll say well next service I'm going to
[23:26] preach this and in this particular
[23:28] situation he's in Louisiana
[23:31] and the next service is all the way in
[23:33] Arizona
[23:34] so
[23:36] um he's bouncing around a lot but yet he
[23:39] already has a mindset where he's going
[23:41] with this
[23:43] and we know the
[23:46] principle in the Bible and even brother
[23:48] Branham alludes to it
[23:50] that when a prophet is on the scene
[23:55] there are times in his life
[23:58] that
[24:00] um
[24:01] I'll say it this way that his life
[24:04] becomes the word to the people
[24:07] and the example is brother Branham gave
[24:09] us was we know there's prophets in the
[24:11] bible he had to go lay on his side for
[24:14] so many days to represent something
[24:16] there was one that had to
[24:19] um
[24:20] go marry a prostitute which obviously no
[24:22] good Prophet would ever do but God
[24:24] instructed them to do that so that their
[24:26] life could become the word to that
[24:28] people for a reason for a son
[24:31] and
[24:33] that is what at least to me appears
[24:36] happened during this course of services
[24:39] is his life we know everything in
[24:42] brother branham's life was not the word
[24:44] to the people
[24:46] um when he took two weeks off and went
[24:47] squirrel hunting and was you know being
[24:50] himself and whatever I'm not trying to
[24:52] spiritualize every aspect of the
[24:54] prophet's life but there were times
[24:56] during
[24:58] what he was foreordained of God to do
[25:01] his ministry that literally became the
[25:05] word to the people and was representing
[25:08] something and was speaking something
[25:10] so
[25:13] he comes 1965 on the wings of a snow
[25:16] white dove and I know I'm kind of
[25:18] jumping into this in the middle you
[25:19] would think I would start at the
[25:21] invisible Union and start explaining
[25:23] myself but that's just not the way this
[25:25] one's going to work I'm sorry it messes
[25:27] with my OCD as well I know but this I
[25:30] just have to kind of jump in whether
[25:32] it's open and then see what happens
[25:34] but on the wings of a snow white dove
[25:38] um brother Brian says now we want to get
[25:40] into the scriptures right away and I
[25:42] want you to turn with me to Psalms 55
[25:44] and then also Matthew 3. and my subject
[25:47] tonight was brother Ernie's topic on
[25:49] this on the wings of a snow white dove
[25:51] that's what a brother had just sang
[25:53] he says now I won't be able to strike
[25:55] all of the notes in the scriptures that
[25:56] I got here because I'll just kind of
[25:58] skip over a few of them and because I
[26:00] promised the message
[26:02] so he's getting ready to read his
[26:04] opening scripture for on the wings of a
[26:06] snow white dove and then he just makes
[26:07] this statement the Lord willing for a
[26:10] human next Saturday I want to preach on
[26:11] the conditions for the Rapture if the
[26:13] Lord willing Psalms 55 give ear to my
[26:16] prayer O Lord
[26:18] so he tells the opening scripture he
[26:20] says this is where I'm going this is my
[26:23] topic all by the way next Saturday night
[26:26] I want to preach on the conditions for a
[26:28] Rapture Psalms 55 give ear to my prayer
[26:30] oh God hi not thyself for my
[26:32] supplication
[26:34] and maybe I'm maybe I'm just weird I
[26:37] don't know but like to me that don't fit
[26:41] like you have announced your topic for
[26:43] tonight you've said where your scripture
[26:45] is you should start reading your
[26:47] scripture but he does it he drops
[26:49] something in here
[26:51] and I'm just prone to believe that he's
[26:52] doing these things for a reason
[26:55] he's wanting somebody to catch something
[26:59] so he reads Psalms 55 give and this is
[27:02] important so we're going to read this
[27:03] give ear to my prayer oh God hide not
[27:05] thyself from my supplication
[27:08] attend unto me and hear me I mourn in my
[27:11] complaint and make a noise because of
[27:13] the voice of the enemy because of the
[27:15] oppression of the wicked for they cast
[27:18] iniquity upon me and in Wrath they hate
[27:20] me
[27:21] my heart is sore pain Within Me and the
[27:24] terror of death are Fallen upon me
[27:27] fearless and tremblings come Cummings
[27:29] are come upon me
[27:31] the horror has overwhelmed me and I said
[27:34] all that I had wings like a dove for
[27:36] then I would fly away and be at rest Lo
[27:39] then would I wonder if far off and
[27:41] remain in the wilderness Selah
[27:43] he says Sila means amen
[27:46] so this opening scripture for on the
[27:48] wings of a snow white dove you can see
[27:52] that if there ever was time to have
[27:55] wings like a dove and fly away these are
[27:58] the conditions for it
[28:00] but if you had wings like a dove and
[28:02] Could Fly Away out of this condition
[28:04] what would that be to you
[28:07] would that not be a Rapture to you
[28:11] so now I put that back with the
[28:13] statement that he just said prior to
[28:16] reading this scripture and again I'm
[28:18] prone to believe he's trying to make me
[28:20] pick something up
[28:23] so he reads this scripture that if
[28:25] there's ever a time for a Rapture this
[28:26] is the conditions for a Rapture get me
[28:28] out of this condition
[28:31] but he preaches on the wings of a snow
[28:33] white dove
[28:35] paragraph 33 in that same message he
[28:37] says David a lover of the Wilderness
[28:39] when he got distressed and the people
[28:41] wouldn't believe him and the enemies had
[28:43] come upon him he said if I had the wings
[28:45] of a dove I would fly out into the
[28:47] Wilderness and they'll remain
[28:49] how many times have I thought the same
[28:53] thing
[28:54] so now he's interjecting himself into
[28:57] this
[28:58] same condition same thoughts and we know
[29:01] brother Branham had just dealt with this
[29:03] and he had to come to terms with it
[29:09] 1965 December 4th he comes to preach the
[29:13] rapture
[29:15] in the Book of Psalms now I want to read
[29:17] I want to speak on a real strange
[29:19] subject tonight just for a little while
[29:21] I got some scriptures wrote down here
[29:24] and I thought maybe that tonight I was
[29:26] going to speak on something different
[29:30] but he already said back in Louisiana
[29:32] that tonight he's speaking on the
[29:34] rapture
[29:36] so now
[29:38] it draws more attention to me to it to
[29:41] me because it tells me that this is not
[29:46] something that brother Branham maybe
[29:48] even is cognitively doing but God is
[29:52] making him do this
[29:55] he's seeing that this is the pattern and
[29:57] the way that it goes so I'm sure he had
[30:00] some type of intuition to it or he
[30:02] wouldn't have made that comment back in
[30:03] Louisiana but right before this service
[30:05] he said I thought I was going to speak
[30:07] on something else but the time got away
[30:10] and I didn't want to stay so long so I'm
[30:12] going to speak on this topic
[30:14] so now this is moving into position
[30:19] he says so I just turned over here and
[30:21] got some more scripture and I want to
[30:23] spray speak on the subject of that the
[30:25] Rapture now we believe that there will
[30:28] be a Rapture all Christians believe that
[30:30] that's Bible readers believe there will
[30:32] be a Rapture and now to read for some
[30:35] background we read the 27th Psalm verse
[30:39] 1 to 5.
[30:40] so listen to this now compare this to
[30:43] the scriptures that he just read in
[30:45] Louisiana
[30:47] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[30:49] Whom Shall I Fear
[30:51] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[30:53] whom shall I be afraid when the
[30:55] wickedness even my enemies and my foes
[30:58] come upon me to eat up my flesh they
[31:00] stumble and fell though the host shall
[31:02] and Camp about me my heart shall not
[31:04] fear though War shall rise against me
[31:06] and this I will be confident one thing
[31:08] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[31:10] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[31:12] of the Lord all of the days of my life
[31:14] to behold the beauty of the Lord until
[31:17] require in his Temple I believe that's
[31:19] supposed to be inquiring his Temple for
[31:21] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[31:24] in the Pavilion and in the secret of his
[31:26] Tabernacle shall he hide me
[31:28] He Shall Set me upon a rock
[31:31] so if you compare the scripture that he
[31:34] spoke on on the wings of a snow white
[31:36] dove David is in a horrible situation
[31:40] distressed complex wanting wings to fly
[31:44] away
[31:46] and now
[31:47] he's basically saying to his enemies and
[31:50] all of these people that are distressing
[31:52] him and all of these problems that he
[31:54] had
[31:55] Bring it on I don't care God will take
[31:58] care of me
[32:00] what happened
[32:03] what happened
[32:05] I would venture to say that something
[32:09] Supernatural
[32:12] arrived on the wings of a snow white
[32:14] dove
[32:17] and that raptured David out of his
[32:19] condition
[32:21] but if you read on the wings of a snow
[32:23] white dove brother Branham spends the
[32:25] majority of that message speaking about
[32:28] the health condition that he used to
[32:29] have and had all of his life and how he
[32:32] feared that and dreaded that and
[32:33] struggled with that and he was always
[32:35] looking for the seventh Dove that his
[32:38] mother had to dream about
[32:39] so he spends the majority of that
[32:41] dealing with a health issue that he had
[32:44] all of his life but how he had finally
[32:46] met that dove in Arizona
[32:49] and that how he knew now all of that was
[32:52] resolved
[32:54] same thing as David he was in a straight
[32:56] he was in a complex situation
[33:00] he didn't have the answers to he wanted
[33:02] out of it
[33:04] but he got his answer on the wings of a
[33:07] snow white dove so now he's relaying
[33:10] these events in his life that exactly
[33:12] matched the scripture that exactly
[33:14] matched the topics that he's dealing
[33:16] with
[33:19] that brings us to things that are to be
[33:24] his opening scripture John 14 let not
[33:27] your heart be troubled you believe in
[33:28] God believe also in me in my father's
[33:31] house are many mansions if it were not
[33:34] so I would have told you I go to prepare
[33:36] a place for you and if I go to prepare a
[33:38] place for you I will come again and
[33:40] receive you unto myself that where I am
[33:42] there ye may be also
[33:44] and whether I go you know and the way
[33:46] you know
[33:47] Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not
[33:50] whether thou goest and how can we know
[33:51] the way
[33:52] Jesus saith unto him I am the way the
[33:56] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[33:59] the father but my being
[34:02] now look at this portion of scripture
[34:04] John 14.
[34:08] I'm sorry
[34:10] take those three portions of scripture
[34:14] and compare them
[34:16] to Hebrews 12 that we just read
[34:21] Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seen we also are
[34:25] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[34:27] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[34:29] and the sin which doth so easily beset
[34:32] us and let us run with patience the race
[34:35] that is set before us
[34:40] lay aside every weight and the sin which
[34:43] so do with which doth so easily beset us
[34:46] the trouble
[34:48] this is trouble these are things that we
[34:50] have to deal with this is the same
[34:51] position David found himself in when he
[34:54] was crying out to the Lord
[34:56] but
[34:58] Paul doesn't leave us there verse two
[35:00] looking unto Jesus
[35:03] I would venture to say
[35:05] looking for something on the wings of a
[35:07] snow white dove
[35:10] the author and finisher of our faith
[35:13] who for the joy that was set before him
[35:15] endured the cross despising the shame
[35:17] and sat down at the right hand of God
[35:19] and now skip down to verse 12. it says
[35:22] wherefore lift up
[35:25] the hands which hang down and the feeble
[35:28] knees
[35:30] wherefore lift up
[35:32] you have these problems
[35:34] but look unto Jesus on the wings of a
[35:36] snow white dove and now you come to
[35:38] verse 12 and it says lift up
[35:40] I would venture to say Rapture up
[35:43] Rapture up so this pattern starts
[35:46] jumping out to me that there is a
[35:48] consistent pattern
[35:50] through the scriptures through this
[35:52] series of message through brother
[35:53] random's life that he was expounding
[35:55] that there is a problem
[35:57] you receive the holy spirit that comes
[36:00] on the wings of a snow white dove and
[36:01] that will Rapture you up out of this
[36:03] situation
[36:07] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[36:09] down in the feeble knees
[36:12] but it does it in there
[36:14] because remember we come down to verse
[36:16] 18.
[36:17] and Paul says for ye are not come unto
[36:21] the mount that may be touched and that
[36:23] burned with fire nor unto Blackness and
[36:25] darkness and Tempest and the sound of a
[36:27] trumpet and the voice of Words which
[36:29] voice that they heard and treated that
[36:31] the word should not be spoken to them
[36:33] anymore for they could not endure that
[36:35] which was commanded and if so much is a
[36:37] beast touch the mountain it shall be
[36:39] stoned or thrust through with the door
[36:41] and so terrible was the sight that Moses
[36:43] said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye
[36:46] are come
[36:49] so you're not come to this
[36:53] but you are come to this
[36:58] these are things that you are come to
[37:00] these are things to be
[37:06] you have wings of a snow white dove that
[37:07] brings something that raptures you up
[37:09] out of a situation
[37:11] to reveal to you that you're not having
[37:14] to be stuck here
[37:16] you're you are come to something else
[37:18] that is to be
[37:20] you are coming to Mount Zion
[37:24] things that are to be and unto the city
[37:27] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[37:30] and to an innumerable company of angels
[37:33] so this pattern that brother Branham
[37:36] ministers through the titles of these
[37:38] services this pattern that David found
[37:41] himself in this this situation that
[37:43] brother Branham found himself in this
[37:46] pattern lays in Hebrews 12.
[37:49] when Paul was speaking
[37:54] foreign
[38:02] things that are to be he says
[38:05] and last night speaking over in Yuma for
[38:08] the Christian businessman I spoke on the
[38:10] subject of the rapture
[38:13] now that might been a strange subject to
[38:15] speak among at a banquet but most
[38:16] everybody there was Christians and
[38:18] that's the way it is on these campaigns
[38:20] like this or in a church I could say how
[38:22] many of you as Christians probably every
[38:23] hand would go up you're a Christian and
[38:25] so if we're Christians I think we ought
[38:28] to be kindly notified ahead
[38:32] we don't have to just guess at it
[38:35] we're notified what our destination will
[38:39] be remember what he's preaching things
[38:41] that are to be
[38:44] and I want to speak on that tonight you
[38:46] want to speak on what tonight to kindly
[38:49] notify us of what's ahead what our
[38:52] destination is going to be
[38:54] I want to speak on that tonight and the
[38:56] subject is going to be things that are
[38:58] to be and now speaking last night on The
[39:01] Rapture so tonight I want to speak on
[39:03] this subject that I might tie it
[39:05] together with last night's message
[39:09] so I'm not just making it all up he's
[39:11] now tying them together
[39:12] he's saying what I'm going to speak
[39:14] tonight is directly tied to last night's
[39:17] message
[39:18] now there is going to be a rapture we
[39:20] know that that's in the future
[39:23] to be
[39:26] things that are to be
[39:29] now I'll tell you the fourth thing that
[39:31] Drew my attention to this whole thing
[39:33] and this was really what I guess kind of
[39:36] blew the doors open on all of this and
[39:38] it's
[39:39] not really
[39:41] proud to say it but I'm reading this
[39:44] message things that are to be and I
[39:46] don't know how many times that I've read
[39:47] it
[39:48] read it when I was a kid I've read it
[39:50] over and over
[39:52] but I'm halfway through this message
[39:54] things that are to be and it just
[39:55] strikes me
[39:57] like a lightning bolt Out of Heaven that
[40:00] brother Branham is preaching a message
[40:01] things that are to be and he has not
[40:04] mentioned one single simple carnal thing
[40:10] nothing
[40:14] maybe I'm just dense but it just didn't
[40:17] say I just didn't catch it before
[40:19] but I would think if you're in a
[40:21] prophetic realm and you come out and I'm
[40:23] going to tell you things that are to be
[40:25] in I guess just in my subconscious or in
[40:29] my preconceived idea somewhere I had it
[40:31] that he's going to come out and start
[40:33] expounding upon the future
[40:35] watch for this look for this prepare for
[40:38] an economic crash prepare for you
[40:41] understand what I'm saying
[40:43] prepare for things that are to be
[40:45] and I'm halfway through this message and
[40:48] I'm looking and I guess maybe
[40:50] subconsciously too I knew there was a
[40:52] spiritual element there but I guess I
[40:53] just already conceived in my mind he's
[40:56] going to expound upon things that are to
[40:57] be for me to prepare for and I just had
[40:59] that stuck naturally and halfway through
[41:02] I realized
[41:04] he's not spoke about one
[41:07] so I read through the rest of the
[41:09] message just with that sole intent of
[41:11] seeing does he ever
[41:13] bring up anything natural that is to be
[41:16] that I need to prepare for
[41:19] and the answer is no he does not
[41:21] so immediately I'm very curious because
[41:24] the next one is modern events that are
[41:27] made clear by prophecy once again in my
[41:29] preconceived hybrid mind I'm thinking
[41:32] modern events made clear by prophecy
[41:34] he's going to say well you all saw this
[41:36] on the news last week this is what it
[41:38] means
[41:42] I'm not so spiritual sometimes I'm sorry
[41:45] but again so I Breeze through this
[41:49] message and I realized he has not
[41:50] mentioned one single thing so he's came
[41:53] and preached two messages now things
[41:55] that are to be and modern events that
[41:57] are made clear by prophecy and not
[41:58] mentioned one carnal thing
[42:01] and that's when it struck me that I'd
[42:03] missed it I had missed the event that
[42:08] was unfolding
[42:09] I'd got a lot of the details in these
[42:11] messages and I believe them all and
[42:13] they're true and they're accurate and
[42:14] they're good but I had missed an event
[42:17] I had missed the big picture of what he
[42:21] was trying to accomplish in my opinion
[42:27] he comes to paragraph 24 and things that
[42:30] are to be he says
[42:31] now but he was telling them that after
[42:34] death there is life so he's speaking of
[42:37] Jesus talking to his disciples because I
[42:40] go and prepare a place that is to
[42:42] receive them
[42:43] shows that there he was speaking to them
[42:48] that there was life after this life is
[42:52] ended
[42:53] so obviously after I realized I've
[42:56] missed this this is nothing to do with
[42:59] carnal situations this is nothing to
[43:02] prepare for in an economic realm or a
[43:04] political realm or uh any other realm
[43:07] this is strictly a spiritual message
[43:09] then I start gleaning this for the
[43:13] things that he's speaking of
[43:15] and this was the first indication that I
[43:17] came to he says that there is life after
[43:20] this life so if there's life after this
[43:23] life would not that life be things that
[43:25] are to be
[43:26] so this fits the title now now maybe I'm
[43:29] starting to be spiritual I'm starting to
[43:31] catch some things
[43:32] he says
[43:34] there's life after this life that we go
[43:37] into and as you get older that becomes
[43:39] more of a reality to you as you begin to
[43:41] see the days of your life drawing close
[43:43] then it begins to you begin to pack up
[43:46] closer getting ready for that great
[43:48] event
[43:49] it is a continuing of this same life in
[43:52] another world in another place
[43:54] yes if we know the word of God we know
[43:57] where we're living we know the hour that
[43:59] we're living in we know what lays ahead
[44:01] we see what we've passed and the Book of
[44:04] God is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:06] his work through the ages that was up to
[44:10] the Book of Revelation
[44:13] and then his promises that is to come
[44:18] so catch that and the Book of God
[44:23] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:27] his work through the ages
[44:30] that was up to the Book of Revelation
[44:35] and then his promises that is to come
[44:38] so
[44:40] if his work Through the Ages was up to
[44:43] the Book of Revelation what would the
[44:46] Book of Revelation be
[44:48] his promises that is yet to come or may
[44:51] I say things that are to be
[44:58] so
[45:01] brother random speaking here
[45:05] we know John wrote the Book of
[45:07] Revelation
[45:09] so at the time that the Book of
[45:10] Revelation was written
[45:13] it was things that are to be
[45:15] because it starts out in the church ages
[45:17] goes up into a Heavenly realm it goes to
[45:20] the Jews goes to the Millennium goes to
[45:21] New Heavens new Earth we understand that
[45:23] it's things that are to be
[45:27] now when we come on the Earth in our age
[45:30] we're like
[45:32] farther along than that
[45:34] but at the time it was written John
[45:39] well I'm just going to say what the
[45:40] scripture says Revelation 1 verse 17.
[45:44] and when I saw him this is John speaking
[45:46] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[45:48] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[45:50] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[45:52] and the last and I am he that liveth and
[45:55] was dead and behold I am alive forever
[45:57] more amen I have the keys of death hell
[46:01] and death write the things which thou
[46:03] Hast seen
[46:08] and the things which are
[46:11] and the things which shall be hereafter
[46:15] or may I say things that are to be
[46:18] this is what the angel told John to
[46:21] write
[46:23] which makes perfect sense based on what
[46:26] brother Branham just told us
[46:28] because
[46:30] John is going to John had already as a
[46:33] scribe at the beginning of of the book
[46:35] as one of the four gospels he had
[46:37] already wrote the things that he had
[46:39] seen now we know in this situation he's
[46:42] on the Isle of Atmos he's cut up into a
[46:44] vision he's seeing things
[46:46] so there's there's two different
[46:47] occurrences here
[46:49] but he's telling him to write write the
[46:51] things that thou has seen and the things
[46:53] which are
[46:55] present tense in John's day
[46:58] and the things that shall be hereafter
[47:01] so this same pattern is the same pattern
[47:05] that the angel tells John
[47:09] Revelation 4 verse 1.
[47:12] after this I looked and behold a door
[47:14] was open in heaven and the first voice
[47:16] which I heard was as it were of a
[47:18] trumpet talking with me which said come
[47:21] up hither
[47:24] we know that's the rapture
[47:28] but what happens immediately after the
[47:32] Rapture
[47:34] and I will show thee things which must
[47:36] be hereafter
[47:38] or things that are to be
[47:42] which is exactly what happens here
[47:45] you have the Rapture on December 4th and
[47:49] you have things that are to be on
[47:50] December 5th
[47:54] so you can see where I'm drawing a
[47:56] conclusion that this is more than a man
[47:59] that there's something being
[48:01] orchestrated that God's doing something
[48:03] even though I cannot yet wrap my mind
[48:05] around it I still don't have the full
[48:07] picture I don't know I just know that
[48:09] God did something here and it matches
[48:11] the pattern in the scriptures and the
[48:14] the thing that we have got to catch at
[48:16] least in my opinion the thing that we
[48:19] are to catch here
[48:21] is if we'll walk through these script
[48:24] these titles
[48:26] I think we find our life in these titles
[48:30] because we all know and believe that we
[48:33] were somewhere else before we were here
[48:37] which is invisible to us
[48:40] there was once an invincible Union of
[48:42] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[48:46] I don't know how that was
[48:49] I don't know how many stages that has
[48:51] been in
[48:54] I do know that it started in his mind
[48:59] as his thoughts now from his thoughts
[49:02] till now is really fuzzy to me
[49:07] I've got a little snippet here and a
[49:09] little snippet there and I think I
[49:10] should see some things but it's really
[49:12] really fuzzy and I cannot preach it
[49:14] because it's just my opinion
[49:17] but that's where I started
[49:20] was in a union with my Christ
[49:23] but since that time I have had to come
[49:26] to this earth in a fallen condition and
[49:28] I have had to have Works express my
[49:31] faith
[49:33] remember what this what Jesus
[49:36] said that the true works of God was and
[49:39] that was to believe on he whom God had
[49:41] sent
[49:43] so since my
[49:47] separation from the union of Christ at
[49:52] least in his mind if not at other stages
[49:54] that I have no idea about at least in
[49:57] his mind
[49:58] and remember we don't take that trivial
[50:00] because we know his thoughts were real
[50:01] and literal
[50:03] so I'm not saying that flippantly like I
[50:06] thoroughly believe I was literally there
[50:09] even though I don't know what literally
[50:10] means
[50:12] I believe it was real and I believe I
[50:14] was there even if it was in his thoughts
[50:16] it was still real
[50:18] so that is where I started
[50:20] but I had to come
[50:22] and I had to work
[50:24] I had to express a work that would
[50:28] express my faith I had to do a work that
[50:30] would express my faith and that was that
[50:32] work was a scriptural work that work was
[50:34] to believe on whom God had sent for my
[50:37] age brother William Branham
[50:40] I cannot get to any other level
[50:44] until I first do that
[50:48] because if I try to get to another level
[50:52] without first doing the work of God
[50:55] which is to believe on him who he sent I
[50:58] will find myself in the third title
[51:00] trying to do God a service without it
[51:02] being his will
[51:05] but if I do do the works of God and I do
[51:08] believe on he whom he has sent I will
[51:10] now
[51:11] say I have heard but now I see
[51:16] and that will reveal to me God's only
[51:18] provided place of worship
[51:20] and when I find out God's only provided
[51:23] place of worship
[51:26] something comes down on the wings of a
[51:28] snow white dove
[51:30] the Holy Spirit
[51:31] the spirit of Truth
[51:33] Christ himself if I will believe on he
[51:36] whom he hath sent and I won't try to do
[51:39] it my own way
[51:42] and I will hear and I will see I will
[51:44] perceive I will understand
[51:48] he can reveal to me his only place of
[51:50] worship
[51:52] he will send me his holy spirit on the
[51:54] wings of his snow white dove
[51:56] and that will catch me up into a
[51:58] spiritual rapture
[51:59] I believe in a physical rapture
[52:02] like I said there's we can't go to seed
[52:04] on any of the statements that I'm making
[52:06] tonight because there's too many Avenues
[52:08] to try to tie them all up I'm not going
[52:10] to be able to do it just try to
[52:12] understand what I'm saying in the
[52:13] context that I'm saying that
[52:15] that will catch me up into a spiritual
[52:17] rapture
[52:18] into a spiritual condition I do not have
[52:21] to be fretting about all of my enemies
[52:24] gathered around me
[52:27] I don't have to worry about that God
[52:29] will fight for me I've done what he's
[52:31] told me to do I've believed on he whom
[52:33] he hath sent
[52:34] I've received his Spirit on the wings of
[52:36] a snow white dove I am caught up I am
[52:39] raptured but immediately after that what
[52:42] does God start doing with us
[52:46] he does
[52:48] what he did to John
[52:51] and he reveals let me get back to that
[52:53] scripture so that I say that say it
[52:55] right
[53:03] Revelation chapter 4 verse one you don't
[53:05] have to turn that I just wanted to get
[53:06] the scripture he does to us what he did
[53:09] to John come up hither he raptures us up
[53:12] and I will show the things which must be
[53:14] hereafter
[53:16] things that are to be
[53:20] he will reveal modern spiritual events
[53:24] he will make those clear by the prophecy
[53:28] that's going on
[53:31] I will have no trouble with that
[53:33] leadership
[53:34] and that will put me right back where I
[53:36] started at
[53:38] in an invisible Union and communion with
[53:41] God
[53:42] So This Is Us
[53:45] this is our course this is our life in
[53:49] this series of services now again I know
[53:52] there is probably literally thousands of
[53:54] details that I cannot see yet
[53:59] my brain can only handle so much
[54:02] I know I'm missing Lots here
[54:05] but this is what I see
[54:07] I hope it blesses you I hope you get
[54:09] something from it I hope it helps you I
[54:11] hope that you can see the scriptural
[54:13] pattern here
[54:15] and understand that this is something
[54:17] God orchestrated
[54:19] his services and we know that his
[54:23] Services were LED of the Lord and
[54:26] inspired we understand that we believe
[54:28] all that but we also know that there are
[54:30] certain times and points in his ministry
[54:33] that were if we would say cornerstones
[54:35] or
[54:37] uh I'll say it like he said it they're
[54:39] not just simple Evangelistic services or
[54:42] faith Building Services
[54:45] they are literally orchestrated by the
[54:49] lamb himself to bring us back into an
[54:52] invisible Union and communion with him
[54:53] his his life and his ministry at these
[54:57] points in time literally become the word
[55:01] being demonstrated to us
[55:04] I trust you believe that I I feel that
[55:07] you do
[55:10] I'm sure this is way deeper
[55:13] than we grasped at this point but this
[55:16] is just what I say
[55:17] so
[55:20] now
[55:27] I'm going to skip that now we're going
[55:29] to
[55:31] quickly I'm not going to hold you late
[55:33] tonight I'm just going to go as far as
[55:36] we as we can here but we're we're not
[55:38] going to cover all this tonight so just
[55:40] just relax we're not going to be here
[55:41] till midnight I promise
[55:43] I want to read some of these quotes and
[55:46] things that are to be to expound upon
[55:49] what I cut there paragraph 28 he says
[55:52] therefore we now we know that Jesus is
[55:55] going to prepare a place to receive a
[55:56] people unto himself whose those people
[55:59] are I hope it's we are a part of those
[56:01] people tonight if it isn't my friend God
[56:04] has made a way a condition that you can
[56:05] be included in that if you want
[56:07] you're on free moral agency you can act
[56:10] the way you wish to but now notice now
[56:13] in this world that is to come there is a
[56:17] world to come
[56:20] there are things to be
[56:23] spiritually
[56:24] there are things to be carnally we're
[56:26] not denying any of that I'm just here to
[56:28] say it doesn't matter
[56:32] it's going to burn
[56:36] we can get so spiritually minded we're
[56:39] no earthly good I get that
[56:43] but in this message
[56:46] and this is so significant because
[56:48] remember who we're talking about here
[56:50] this is the seventh angel
[56:51] this is the seventh vile Angel this is
[56:54] the vessel that the lamb is going to use
[56:57] for full Redemption to claim what is his
[56:59] and this is the tail end the closing
[57:02] moments of his ministry
[57:07] I'm convinced he's not out
[57:11] trying to have a prayer line at the end
[57:12] of his ministry for a reason like he he
[57:15] did have that but it wasn't his emphasis
[57:17] you understand what I'm saying like he's
[57:20] emphasizing deep spiritual doctrinal
[57:24] teachings in the
[57:26] not necessarily such friendly
[57:29] environments uh he went to Brother Jack
[57:31] Moore's and he said he had full Liberty
[57:33] there brother Jack told him preached
[57:34] whatever he wanted to preach but then
[57:35] he's going to these businessman
[57:37] conventions and I mean they're already
[57:39] mad at him because he preaches against
[57:40] the women with short hair I mean here he
[57:43] is trying to expound and preach upon the
[57:44] rapture
[57:46] but it's the closing moments and the
[57:49] closing opportunity God's trying to get
[57:52] this in
[57:55] not that God's trying to do anything you
[57:57] under you understand what I'm saying
[57:59] this is important there's a purpose
[58:00] behind it
[58:03] so he starts dropping these phrases in
[58:06] there is a world to come
[58:08] paragraph 32. now the only way that you
[58:11] can be a son or daughter of God because
[58:12] you have to have eternal life and
[58:14] there's only one form of eternal life
[58:16] and that's God's life only one form of
[58:19] eternal life that was God the
[58:21] there to be a Son of God you had to be
[58:24] in him always the gene of your spiritual
[58:26] life tonight was in God the Father
[58:29] before there even even was a molecule I
[58:33] thought you were preaching about things
[58:34] that are to be
[58:36] but he's talking about a spiritual Gene
[58:39] your father's spiritual Gene even before
[58:41] there was anything
[58:43] what is he doing he's doing exactly what
[58:46] the angel did to John in the Book of
[58:48] Revelation he says write the things that
[58:50] thou has seen
[58:54] and you are nothing but the
[58:55] manifestation of the gene of life that
[58:57] was in God
[58:59] now
[59:00] we just made a transition we're not past
[59:03] tense anymore
[59:05] and you are not you are you are present
[59:08] tense you are nothing but the
[59:10] manifestation of the gene of life that
[59:11] was in God as a Son of God now you're
[59:13] expressed after his word has come into
[59:15] you to light up this age you are
[59:17] expressing God's life in you because you
[59:19] are a son or daughter of God therefore
[59:22] you get what I mean you are now made
[59:24] present tense you're sitting in this
[59:27] church tonight because your duty to is
[59:28] is to express God to this nation and to
[59:30] this people and this neighborhood where
[59:32] you associate wherever you are God knew
[59:35] that you would be here because you have
[59:36] to be one of his genes or his attributes
[59:38] you had to be if you ever if you ever
[59:40] have eternal life then it was always
[59:42] eternal life
[59:44] ah
[59:45] and God before there was a foundation of
[59:47] the world knew that you would be here
[59:49] present tense and when the word or the
[59:52] water the washing of the water of the
[59:53] word fell upon you it was expressed in a
[59:55] being now you have fellowship with your
[59:58] father God just as you have with your
[1:00:00] Earthly father you are children Sons and
[1:00:03] Daughters of the Living God if it be
[1:00:05] that the eternal life dwells in you
[1:00:07] dwells in you present tense what's he
[1:00:11] doing he's already wrote the things
[1:00:13] which were now he's speaking about the
[1:00:15] things that are exactly what the angel
[1:00:17] did to John
[1:00:19] paragraph 37 therefore the bride and the
[1:00:23] Rapture will come forth
[1:00:26] transition
[1:00:27] what's he doing you guessed it same
[1:00:30] thing the angel did to John in the Book
[1:00:32] of Revelation now he's speaking about
[1:00:34] things that aren't to be
[1:00:36] we know there is a spiritual Rapture now
[1:00:38] but there is to be a physical rapture
[1:00:42] and there therefore the bride and the
[1:00:45] Rapture will come forth and there is all
[1:00:47] pre-planned by God all backed up from
[1:00:49] the beginning he knowed every man every
[1:00:51] place who would set all about it it's
[1:00:53] all pre-planned by God God knew it would
[1:00:55] be here
[1:00:56] he made it that way so that when we get
[1:00:59] there
[1:01:00] he's going to prepare a place for us and
[1:01:03] when we get there it'll be prepared just
[1:01:06] like even this night is prepared
[1:01:09] like this hour is prepared yes his great
[1:01:12] foreknowledge tells him all of these
[1:01:14] things by foreknowledge I started
[1:01:16] laughing when I was studying this
[1:01:17] because it was exactly what Sunday was
[1:01:19] about are we here or are we there and
[1:01:21] brother Branham is doing the exact same
[1:01:23] thing he says because we're this way
[1:01:25] here we'll be that way there and because
[1:01:27] it's that way there will be that way
[1:01:29] here
[1:01:30] my question is how much difference in
[1:01:32] separation is there here
[1:01:36] but you'll notice in the first 37
[1:01:38] paragraphs
[1:01:41] let me finish reading this and then I'll
[1:01:42] make a statement I don't hardly
[1:01:44] understand that how we could think that
[1:01:46] a God that could prepare all of these
[1:01:48] good things for us that we cannot put
[1:01:50] trust in him that if he brought us in
[1:01:52] this chaos that we're now in and
[1:01:54] prepared the good things of life for us
[1:01:55] here how much more can we trust him to
[1:01:57] prepare the things that is to come see
[1:01:59] the Eternal things
[1:02:01] so remember what he's preaching things
[1:02:03] that are to be but now we've got the
[1:02:05] understanding this is nothing carnal and
[1:02:07] he makes it clear for us these are
[1:02:09] things to be Eternal things I'm speaking
[1:02:11] of Eternal things I'm speaking of
[1:02:13] spiritual things catch what I'm speaking
[1:02:15] about
[1:02:15] he says paragraph 42 I believe that
[1:02:19] heaven is a real place just the same as
[1:02:21] this is a real place see for God started
[1:02:23] us in our spiritual growth in this place
[1:02:26] and I believe that heaven is a place
[1:02:28] just as real as real as this where we
[1:02:30] don't go up there and set for eternity
[1:02:32] and just sit there on a cloud we don't
[1:02:34] just strum our heart from all here ever
[1:02:36] but we're going to a real place where
[1:02:39] we're going to do things we're going to
[1:02:42] do things things that are to be we're
[1:02:44] going to do things okay what are those
[1:02:46] things that are to be where we're going
[1:02:49] to do things
[1:02:50] we're going to live we're going to work
[1:02:53] we're going to enjoy we're going to live
[1:02:57] we're going to life to a real eternal
[1:02:59] life we're going to a heaven a paradise
[1:03:03] just like Adam and Eve worked and lived
[1:03:05] and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of
[1:03:07] Eden before sin came in were on our road
[1:03:09] back there now
[1:03:13] what did the angel tell John to write
[1:03:15] things which shall be hereafter
[1:03:19] in 42 paragraphs he's done exactly what
[1:03:23] the angel told John to do
[1:03:25] I found this astounding
[1:03:30] now again I know I've jumped right in
[1:03:33] the middle of this
[1:03:35] I'm expounding upon things there are to
[1:03:37] be which is like number nine down the
[1:03:39] list I think
[1:03:40] but that's just where we're at
[1:03:45] so he lays in the first 42 paragraphs he
[1:03:49] does exactly what the angel did to John
[1:03:51] but then he starts
[1:03:57] expounding upon the scripture that he
[1:04:01] read let's go back and read that really
[1:04:02] quick
[1:04:04] foreign
[1:04:16] this is his opening scripture for things
[1:04:18] that are to be
[1:04:35] will Breeze through this just as quick
[1:04:38] as we can and then we're going to close
[1:04:39] because
[1:04:40] again I
[1:04:42] I know how we could just drag this out
[1:04:45] for hours and we're not going to do that
[1:04:49] John 14.
[1:04:53] the topic is things that are to be
[1:04:55] is opening scripture let not your heart
[1:04:58] be troubled ye believe in God believe
[1:05:01] also in me in my father's house are many
[1:05:04] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:05:06] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[1:05:12] if in my father's house are many
[1:05:15] mansions why does he still have to go
[1:05:17] and prepare them
[1:05:22] they're already there
[1:05:26] but this is Jesus speaking we know Jesus
[1:05:28] is not confused
[1:05:30] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:05:33] but I'll go prepare them
[1:05:38] I will go and prepare a place for you so
[1:05:40] if I already have a mansion over there
[1:05:45] they are there he said so in my father's
[1:05:47] house are many mansions
[1:05:51] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:05:54] so
[1:05:55] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:05:58] so that tells me that when I get there
[1:06:02] there's something that he's prepared
[1:06:05] and is preparing
[1:06:09] besides my mansion
[1:06:13] besides a
[1:06:15] brick building
[1:06:16] a house a physical house for me to live
[1:06:19] in
[1:06:21] there is something
[1:06:24] being done to it should I say
[1:06:27] there is an active work
[1:06:30] involving it
[1:06:33] but it is there
[1:06:41] if I go and prepare a place for you I
[1:06:43] will come again and receive you to
[1:06:45] myself that where I am there may you be
[1:06:47] also and whether I go you know in the
[1:06:49] way you know Thomas saith in him Lord we
[1:06:52] know not whether thou goest and how can
[1:06:54] we know the way Jesus saith unto him I
[1:06:56] am the way the truth and the life no man
[1:06:58] cometh to unto the father but by me
[1:07:03] so Jesus is saying in my father's house
[1:07:07] are many mansions but
[1:07:10] I have to go if you'll allow me just to
[1:07:12] use my own words here but I have to go
[1:07:15] do something besides that
[1:07:17] if that makes sense
[1:07:20] but there is something currently there
[1:07:22] in some form
[1:07:24] something eternal
[1:07:28] but just because something has an
[1:07:31] eternal attribute this is my
[1:07:33] understanding I could be wrong
[1:07:35] but just because something has an
[1:07:38] eternal attribute does not mean that
[1:07:41] it's a completed work
[1:07:43] it does not mean that it cannot be in
[1:07:47] another form or change forms
[1:07:51] because we know we had to be eternal
[1:07:55] even if it was in the thoughts of God
[1:07:59] but we now know that we're in this
[1:08:02] position
[1:08:04] but an eternal attribute is tied to us
[1:08:08] so the form has changed again starts
[1:08:11] getting really fuzzy when I try to
[1:08:12] explain that I can't explain that but we
[1:08:14] know that that's true because I'm no
[1:08:16] longer still just in the mind of God
[1:08:19] I'm expressed but there's still an
[1:08:23] eternal attribute brother Brandon taught
[1:08:25] us that is here with us we have we know
[1:08:27] that has to be fact
[1:08:30] and Jesus is saying the same thing that
[1:08:32] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:08:36] but I'm going to go prepare a place for
[1:08:39] you
[1:08:40] I believe when brother random starts
[1:08:42] into this message things that are to be
[1:08:43] he expounds upon this and gives us the
[1:08:45] proper understanding for this
[1:08:48] paragraph 45 he says Jesus is going to
[1:08:51] make ready are coming there
[1:08:58] tie that to what Jesus said he says the
[1:09:00] Mansions are already there
[1:09:02] brother says Jesus is going to make
[1:09:04] ready our coming there
[1:09:06] I just want to interject this
[1:09:09] and this is really carnal but hopefully
[1:09:11] it'll just help somebody it helps me
[1:09:14] if you buy a house
[1:09:17] you've got the deed for the house you
[1:09:19] have that house it is yours
[1:09:22] um let's say you paid cash for it the
[1:09:24] bank don't even have a lien on it like
[1:09:25] it's legitimately as much as can be in
[1:09:28] this Dimension yours
[1:09:30] you've bought that house it is there
[1:09:34] but there are things you have to do to a
[1:09:37] house before you move into it
[1:09:39] but it is there
[1:09:44] but you put Furniture in a new house you
[1:09:46] bought
[1:09:47] you maybe go and paint the walls inside
[1:09:50] there is a lot of things that happen
[1:09:52] inside of that
[1:09:54] even though it's already there and
[1:09:57] probably has been there for a long time
[1:10:01] Hope just hold that thought and
[1:10:03] hopefully that will help you
[1:10:05] it helped me
[1:10:09] Jesus has gone to make ready our coming
[1:10:11] now notice in my father's house there's
[1:10:14] many mansions or let us I don't mean to
[1:10:17] add to the word or take from it because
[1:10:19] we're not to do that but let me just
[1:10:21] make this as not an additive but just to
[1:10:24] bring out a point in my father's house
[1:10:27] is many kinds of mansions
[1:10:31] I don't believe that when we get to
[1:10:33] heaven that we will be just everybody
[1:10:36] look just exactly alike I don't believe
[1:10:39] that all will be blondes or brunettes or
[1:10:41] little or big
[1:10:43] or all Giants
[1:10:48] thought we were talking about houses
[1:10:56] I believe that God is a god of variety
[1:10:59] the world proves that he's got big
[1:11:02] mountains and little mountains he's got
[1:11:04] planes he's got deserts he's got
[1:11:06] different things because he made it the
[1:11:07] way he wanted it and he made the season
[1:11:10] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[1:11:12] seasons it shows he's a god of variety
[1:11:13] he made you in a variety some men are
[1:11:17] real blusterous and some are real
[1:11:19] dogmatic and others are fine others are
[1:11:21] kind and you just find all different
[1:11:23] kinds of people
[1:11:24] in his kingdom
[1:11:30] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:11:35] but brother random says he's going to
[1:11:37] make ready our coming there
[1:11:40] and then he starts talking about people
[1:11:42] instead of houses
[1:11:46] in my father's house are many kinds of
[1:11:48] mansions not all of them are blondes
[1:11:51] brunettes or little or big or all Giants
[1:11:56] look at Saint Peter and judge him by
[1:11:58] Andrew Andrew is that prayer award just
[1:12:00] stayed on his knees all the time and the
[1:12:02] Apostle Peter was one of those fibrant
[1:12:04] brands that preached and so forth and
[1:12:06] Paul was more scholarly like more like a
[1:12:08] prophet or something and set back and
[1:12:10] see Moses wrote he's differentiating
[1:12:13] between people
[1:12:15] Moses wrote the first four books of the
[1:12:17] Old which he wrote the Old Testament
[1:12:18] Testament the rest of it was the laws
[1:12:20] and kings and Psalms and so forth that
[1:12:22] someone wrote of the prophets but Moses
[1:12:24] wrote The Walls the first four books of
[1:12:26] the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus and
[1:12:28] Deuteronomy and then Paul wrote the New
[1:12:31] Testament he's still differentiating
[1:12:33] between between people
[1:12:34] that's true Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:12:37] wrote the acts of what taken place and
[1:12:38] so forth but Paul separated law and
[1:12:40] Grace and put it in its place now notice
[1:12:43] many many mansions many kinds of
[1:12:47] mansions
[1:12:52] but he just spent three or four
[1:12:54] paragraphs talking about people
[1:12:56] and if this Earth that we live in today
[1:12:58] being so great as we love it and love to
[1:13:01] live and breathe the air and see the
[1:13:02] flowers and things if that if this is
[1:13:04] here in this expression remember the
[1:13:06] title of this service is things that are
[1:13:08] to be
[1:13:10] and this expression one that is dying is
[1:13:13] only expressing one that is eternal when
[1:13:15] you see a tree struggling pulling trying
[1:13:17] to live that means there's a tree
[1:13:19] somewhere that doesn't have to do that
[1:13:21] when you see a man here struggling to
[1:13:23] live somebody in a hospital or on a sick
[1:13:25] bed or in an accident struggling and the
[1:13:27] death rattle is in their throat and
[1:13:28] pulling and crying and screaming for
[1:13:30] Life what does that mean it means
[1:13:32] there's a place somewhere there's a body
[1:13:35] that doesn't struggle and scream for
[1:13:37] that
[1:13:38] there are things that are to be that
[1:13:41] doesn't do what things that are here
[1:13:43] present do now
[1:13:45] now they are temporal gifts to us these
[1:13:48] things only expressing that there is one
[1:13:50] that is in where it's the Eternal one
[1:13:52] that's what Jesus has going away to
[1:13:55] prepare
[1:13:58] what's he going to wait to prepare
[1:14:00] there's a place somewhere there's a body
[1:14:03] that doesn't struggle and scream for
[1:14:06] that now there are temporal gifts to us
[1:14:08] these things only expressing that there
[1:14:10] is one where it's an eternal one that's
[1:14:14] what Jesus has gone away to prepare the
[1:14:17] Eternal one for us
[1:14:20] now there's only now they only express
[1:14:23] there's a greater of the same kind
[1:14:26] because these are the same kind same
[1:14:30] kind of what bodies
[1:14:33] one's hybrid one's not
[1:14:36] but one is still expressing the other
[1:14:38] and Jesus has went to prepare many kinds
[1:14:43] of these houses
[1:14:47] that was paragraph 51
[1:14:51] he comes to paragraph 52
[1:14:54] he says now remember
[1:14:58] the Bible said if this Earthly
[1:15:00] Tabernacle of our dwelling if it perish
[1:15:03] or be dissolved we have one already
[1:15:05] waiting so now I know I'm not out in
[1:15:08] left field now I know I'm not crazy he
[1:15:11] is tying a direct correlation between
[1:15:13] mansions to bodies
[1:15:18] with the title of a message things that
[1:15:21] are to be
[1:15:25] so things that are to be
[1:15:28] is not the economic crash that's coming
[1:15:30] that we need to be concerned about
[1:15:35] what we need to be concerned about
[1:15:38] is that we don't get in the way
[1:15:41] of Jesus preparing
[1:15:46] a way for us
[1:15:48] in things that are to be
[1:15:53] that's what we have to focus on because
[1:15:55] we're a gentile people
[1:15:58] we're concerned with spiritual affairs
[1:16:01] spiritual things
[1:16:05] now remember the Bible said if this
[1:16:07] Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling if it
[1:16:09] perish be dissolved we have one already
[1:16:11] waiting just as the little baby it's
[1:16:13] little muscles in the mother are
[1:16:14] twisting and turning and you notice you
[1:16:17] can take a woman if she's ever so foul
[1:16:19] foul but when she's to become a mother a
[1:16:22] little while before the baby is born
[1:16:23] there's a kindness about the woman get
[1:16:25] around her there's always something
[1:16:27] she's more tender why there's a little
[1:16:29] angel Spirit waiting to receive that
[1:16:31] natural body
[1:16:33] just as soon as it's born the Breath of
[1:16:35] Life comes into it and God breathes it
[1:16:38] in there and it becomes a living Soul
[1:16:39] now just as this baby is being born then
[1:16:43] the spiritual body is there to receive
[1:16:45] it and now when this baby is dropped
[1:16:48] here in this earth like the baby is
[1:16:50] dropped
[1:16:52] also there is an immortal body waiting
[1:16:55] to receive the but the spirit back into
[1:16:58] itself
[1:17:00] this Immortal body is things that are to
[1:17:03] be that Jesus is going to prepare
[1:17:09] oh what a great thing we are now in
[1:17:12] Jesus in Christ Jesus babies babes in
[1:17:15] Christ children of God waiting for the
[1:17:17] full Deliverance waiting for something
[1:17:20] to be
[1:17:21] at the coming of our Lord Jesus to
[1:17:24] receive us up into himself when the body
[1:17:27] this Mortal will take on immortality now
[1:17:30] we know that portion that he's referring
[1:17:32] to is not the spiritual Rapture that is
[1:17:34] the physical rapture
[1:17:38] the likeness all the things that he did
[1:17:41] expresses the things that are to come
[1:17:45] just as the body gives you here just as
[1:17:48] this body he gave you to live in only
[1:17:51] expressed that there is one that is
[1:17:54] greater yet to come
[1:17:56] so now it's becoming really abundantly
[1:17:58] clear what the topic things that are to
[1:18:01] be is about
[1:18:03] bodies that are to come
[1:18:08] he gave you one to live in only
[1:18:10] expresses that there is one that is
[1:18:12] greater yet to come see if we bear or
[1:18:15] have borne the image of the Earthly we
[1:18:18] also shall bear the image of the
[1:18:20] Heavenly which holds no evil in this one
[1:18:23] that is to come
[1:18:27] things that are to be
[1:18:31] now we find this life holds all kinds of
[1:18:34] evils so therefore the life that is in
[1:18:36] it that is to come won't have it this
[1:18:40] one has lust and sickness and death
[1:18:42] because what is it it's not the house
[1:18:45] that he's going to prepare
[1:18:50] this is so rich things this is so good
[1:18:56] this is a pest house referring to our
[1:18:59] flesh of the bodies how many knows what
[1:19:01] a pest house is sure well that's what
[1:19:03] you're living in
[1:19:05] a pest house is where they put all the
[1:19:07] diseased people well that's just what
[1:19:09] sin has done to us put us in an Earthly
[1:19:10] pest house they wouldn't let anyone else
[1:19:13] come into this pest house because
[1:19:15] there's all kinds of germs flying around
[1:19:16] in there and the people will take these
[1:19:18] germs and be six themselves and sin
[1:19:21] brought us into the devil's pest house
[1:19:23] the devil's body
[1:19:26] all but the other one is called my
[1:19:30] father's house
[1:19:32] what other one that Mansion over there
[1:19:35] with brick and mortar and transparent
[1:19:37] gold streets
[1:19:41] the other one the other body that I will
[1:19:45] take on when I drop this Earthly one
[1:19:48] that one is called my father's house
[1:19:51] I'll go and prepare a place for you take
[1:19:54] you out of this pest house and deliver
[1:19:56] you into my father's house amen there
[1:19:59] you are take you out of this old Earthly
[1:20:01] pest house he's going to prepare a place
[1:20:04] a perfect place where no evil exists no
[1:20:07] sickness exists no old age exists no
[1:20:11] death exists
[1:20:13] paragraph 65. now this old world must
[1:20:16] fail but fall because it came through
[1:20:18] sex and it came through disobedience in
[1:20:20] the beginning and we was born here
[1:20:22] through sex through the fall and it must
[1:20:25] go right back the same way to the fall
[1:20:27] but the one he is now preparing for you
[1:20:30] cannot fall
[1:20:35] so he is currently preparing something
[1:20:38] for us but Jesus when he was on Earth
[1:20:41] says that the Mansions are already there
[1:20:45] again hybrid brain explosion
[1:20:49] but there has to be a simple explanation
[1:20:53] because God hides himself in simplicity
[1:20:55] so why is it so difficult to believe
[1:20:57] even though it has an eternal attribute
[1:21:00] and is there and was there and has
[1:21:02] always been there and Jesus declared in
[1:21:04] my father's house are many mansions that
[1:21:07] he's still not doing something and
[1:21:09] working on an attribute that is attached
[1:21:12] to that
[1:21:17] there's only one thing that the brother
[1:21:19] of random says that we take from this
[1:21:20] life to that one
[1:21:24] character
[1:21:26] you tell me how you perfect your
[1:21:30] character for that Mansion over there if
[1:21:32] Jesus didn't go and make a way to send
[1:21:34] you a prophet back to tell you the truth
[1:21:36] and establish your character and form it
[1:21:38] into the image that would fit that body
[1:21:40] it was over there
[1:21:42] I go way ahead of myself there but I
[1:21:44] just couldn't help myself
[1:21:49] we have an eternal attribute attached to
[1:21:52] us we have a mansion and a body I don't
[1:21:55] know what to call it Saints if you call
[1:21:57] it a theophany at this point like was
[1:21:59] the theophany in the mind of God and
[1:22:01] then it became into something else and
[1:22:03] then came down that I don't know I'm
[1:22:05] just being honest I don't know I know at
[1:22:08] the very least I was an attribute I was
[1:22:10] a thought and I was real in the mind of
[1:22:12] God
[1:22:14] and there is at some point in time going
[1:22:16] to come a bodily expression of that in
[1:22:20] another dimension that I'm going to take
[1:22:22] only my character and put into that
[1:22:26] and how all that works I have no idea I
[1:22:29] cannot expound that to you
[1:22:32] but Jesus has went to prepare a way for
[1:22:36] that to happen
[1:22:37] and the only way for my character to get
[1:22:40] to a point that it can go into that
[1:22:42] Dimension and into that form that
[1:22:44] already has an eternal attribute it's
[1:22:46] through the word that he has delivered
[1:22:48] through the prophet for my age
[1:22:51] the only way for me to get to things
[1:22:53] that are to be is to receive the things
[1:22:56] that are now and the things that are now
[1:22:59] has told me what has been what is and
[1:23:02] it's told me what's going to come to
[1:23:04] give me the faith to move into that next
[1:23:06] dimension
[1:23:08] if you'll get me just a couple more
[1:23:10] minutes I promise we'll close
[1:23:14] now this world
[1:23:18] skip it now what if we just had to stay
[1:23:22] in this kind of body
[1:23:24] aren't you glad there's such a thing as
[1:23:26] death now isn't that strange I'm glad
[1:23:29] that there's something to get us out of
[1:23:30] this pest house there's an open door and
[1:23:33] it's called death Jesus stands in that
[1:23:35] door amen he'll guide me over the river
[1:23:38] catch that Jesus stands in that door
[1:23:41] what's Jesus doing in that door
[1:23:45] like does he need to keep it open with
[1:23:48] his hand physically hold it he says
[1:23:50] Jesus stands in that door
[1:23:53] maybe he's preparing the way through
[1:23:56] that door
[1:23:59] it's called death Jesus stands in the
[1:24:02] door he'll guide me over the river he'll
[1:24:04] take me through the door he's there's a
[1:24:08] great door standing Yonder called death
[1:24:09] and every time your heart beats your one
[1:24:11] bit closer to it and someday I must come
[1:24:14] to that door you must come to that door
[1:24:15] but when I come there I don't want to be
[1:24:18] a coward I don't want to scream and back
[1:24:19] off I want to come to that door wrap
[1:24:22] myself in the Robes of his righteousness
[1:24:24] not mine his but this I know that I know
[1:24:28] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:24:31] that when he calls I'll come out from
[1:24:34] among the dead to be with him out of
[1:24:36] this pest house
[1:24:38] wherever this body might fall and
[1:24:41] wherever it might land whatever it is
[1:24:44] I'll come out someday because he
[1:24:46] promised it to me and we believe it yes
[1:24:49] sir he's making one that cannot fall
[1:24:52] making one what a house a building a
[1:24:56] body
[1:24:58] yes
[1:25:00] yes and Sunday the answer is yes
[1:25:03] the answer is yes
[1:25:05] now
[1:25:06] just in case you think I'm completely
[1:25:08] out in the left field and making all
[1:25:10] this up the scripture says that there
[1:25:11] has to let every word be established by
[1:25:13] two or three Witnesses 1963.
[1:25:19] the Third Exodus
[1:25:21] brother Branham says there's coming in
[1:25:23] Exodus where God will show who he is
[1:25:26] where the church itself the Bride of
[1:25:28] Jesus Christ will be Exodus out into the
[1:25:31] land that's promised
[1:25:33] starts quoting scripture in my father's
[1:25:36] house are many mansions in this place
[1:25:39] you don't have to go there and fight
[1:25:41] like they did speaking of Israel it's
[1:25:44] already prepared
[1:25:46] starts quoting another scripture if this
[1:25:49] Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be dissolved
[1:25:52] we have one already waiting
[1:25:56] that's where I am that where I am there
[1:26:00] ye will be also the great Exodus at hand
[1:26:05] so at the end of his ministry and things
[1:26:08] that are to be he's pounding this
[1:26:10] principle in and my father's house are
[1:26:13] many mansions and my father's Kingdom
[1:26:15] there are bodies that have an eternal
[1:26:17] quality that you are going to and he is
[1:26:19] preparing a way for you to get there but
[1:26:21] all the way back in 1963 brother Branham
[1:26:24] just touches on this extremely briefly
[1:26:26] in that message of
[1:26:29] in The Exodus out of here the Rapture
[1:26:32] out of here
[1:26:33] it's almost like he can't help this
[1:26:35] pattern it's a scriptural pattern he
[1:26:37] just Falls right into it he's talking
[1:26:38] about a Nexus he's talking about a bride
[1:26:40] going out here he's talking about a
[1:26:41] Rapture out of here he says in my
[1:26:43] father's house there are many mansions
[1:26:45] things that are to be
[1:26:47] and then he expounds upon it even there
[1:26:51] if this Earthly Tabernacle dwelling be
[1:26:54] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:26:56] immediately even back in 1963 ties those
[1:26:59] mansions to bodies
[1:27:02] things that are to be
[1:27:04] if the musicians will come please
[1:27:11] so
[1:27:13] the
[1:27:15] spiritual principle that we can take
[1:27:18] from this
[1:27:20] is really really simple
[1:27:23] really really simple and brother Branham
[1:27:25] said it in the unveiling of God
[1:27:27] if we'll go ahead and stand together
[1:27:29] please
[1:27:35] and brother Chad if you'll come please
[1:27:37] and the unveiling of God he says see
[1:27:40] that was so great he's speaking of
[1:27:42] Israel and God coming down on the mount
[1:27:44] see that was so great till even the
[1:27:47] people said they said when they seen
[1:27:49] Jehovah come down in this Pillar of Fire
[1:27:50] and begin to shake the earth and the
[1:27:52] things he done in the Mountain of Fire
[1:27:53] And even if anybody tried to go to the
[1:27:56] mountain it perished they perished
[1:28:00] it was so great till even Moses feared
[1:28:02] the Quake then if that time he shook
[1:28:05] just the mountains this time he'll shake
[1:28:07] the heavens and earth
[1:28:10] what about this Glory
[1:28:12] he's speaking on the unveiling of God
[1:28:14] 1964. what about this Glory what about
[1:28:17] this unveiling of God
[1:28:19] if that was veiled by a natural Veil
[1:28:22] Moses was veiled by naturalville this is
[1:28:26] veiled by a spiritual Veil
[1:28:30] so don't try to look at the natural
[1:28:34] break into the spirit and see where
[1:28:38] you're at see what hour you're living in
[1:28:42] that's the principle that lays under
[1:28:44] things that are to be that God revealed
[1:28:46] to me it's not natural Saints
[1:28:49] we have natural lives I get that we
[1:28:52] don't want to become so spiritually
[1:28:53] minded that we're no earthly good I get
[1:28:56] that
[1:28:57] but the most important part
[1:29:00] as Gentile spiritual Gentile Brides
[1:29:05] is when a prophet comes on the scene and
[1:29:08] he says I'm going to preach on things
[1:29:09] that are to be don't think carnal
[1:29:12] because it's not carnal
[1:29:14] it's spiritual and it's eternal
[1:29:19] First Corinthians 2 12 says now we have
[1:29:23] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:29:25] the spirit which is of god that we may
[1:29:27] know the things that are freely given to
[1:29:29] us of God which things also we speak not
[1:29:32] in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[1:29:35] which the holy ghosts teacheth comparing
[1:29:39] spiritual things with spiritual things
[1:29:42] Gentiles do what compare spiritual
[1:29:45] things with spiritual things not carnal
[1:29:49] things
[1:29:51] first Peter 2 wherefore laying aside all
[1:29:54] malice and all GAO and hypocrisies and
[1:29:56] envies and all evil speakings as newborn
[1:29:59] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[1:30:02] the word that you may grow thereby and
[1:30:04] if so be ye and if so big ye have tasted
[1:30:09] that the Lord is gracious
[1:30:11] if so be Ye Ye have tasted that the Lord
[1:30:13] is gracious I'm sorry to whom coming as
[1:30:16] unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of
[1:30:19] men but chosen of God and precious ye
[1:30:22] also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:30:24] spiritual house
[1:30:27] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:30:30] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ gentile people spiritual house
[1:30:38] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:30:40] scriptures behold I lay in Zion a Chief
[1:30:44] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[1:30:48] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[1:30:52] this is First Peter 2 and it ties
[1:30:55] directly to our opening scripture
[1:30:58] go all the way back up here of Hebrews
[1:31:01] 12.
[1:31:03] of Paul speaking who said you don't come
[1:31:05] to a natural Mount you come to Mount
[1:31:07] Zion
[1:31:09] well in in Peter he just spoke that
[1:31:12] there's a Cornerstone in there in Zion
[1:31:16] directly tied together
[1:31:19] spiritual application
[1:31:21] for the Gentile bride
[1:31:25] the Cornerstone of Zion is obviously
[1:31:29] going to be where Zion is and that is
[1:31:32] what Paul said that he wants us to go to
[1:31:35] to compare spiritual things to spiritual
[1:31:38] things
[1:31:40] and I'm going to close with this if
[1:31:42] you'll go ahead and play something
[1:31:42] please
[1:31:43] Colossians 3 verse 1 if ye then be risen
[1:31:48] with Christ
[1:31:50] raptured
[1:31:52] seek those things which are above
[1:31:56] things that are to be
[1:31:58] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:32:01] of God
[1:32:02] set your affections on things that are
[1:32:05] above not on the Earth
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:12] that's all I've got to say
[1:32:18] spiritual application not distracted by
[1:32:21] the carnal
[1:32:23] if the devil can keep us distracted by
[1:32:25] the carnal there is no way
[1:32:28] that we're going to find the door that
[1:32:30] we're going to be caught up that we're
[1:32:32] going to make feeble hands strong that
[1:32:34] we're going to make lame feet strong
[1:32:36] it's only
[1:32:38] through a spiritual word
[1:32:41] and the full Spirit of Christ that's
[1:32:43] been delivered to us that if we focus on
[1:32:46] that
[1:32:47] and I'm not preaching this in a
[1:32:49] condemning way I believe that's what you
[1:32:51] are focused on and what you do want to
[1:32:53] focus on I'm just saying for me when I
[1:32:55] came to that message and I'm reading it
[1:32:57] it exploded to me
[1:32:59] that at the tail end of his ministry
[1:33:01] this pattern through the scripture
[1:33:04] God and the prophet is so trying to
[1:33:06] impress upon us
[1:33:08] to not be distracted and to focus on the
[1:33:12] real reality the spiritual application
[1:33:15] of the word in our life
[1:33:17] can we say Amen let's pray together
[1:33:19] precious Lord Jesus we thank you once
[1:33:23] again for the time that we had here Lord
[1:33:25] we just pray that you would take the
[1:33:27] words that were spoken that you would
[1:33:30] let the people see my heart Lord and no
[1:33:32] doubt I've done a poor job trying to
[1:33:34] explain it and put it together Lord but
[1:33:36] we're still stuck in hybridization Lord
[1:33:39] and as our Pastor said Sunday we're
[1:33:41] still trying to take Precious
[1:33:45] Eternal wonderful things and Proclaim
[1:33:48] them through a fallen vessel with a
[1:33:51] limited language Lord and there's just
[1:33:53] no way to do it but Lord we know that
[1:33:56] you can do it because you said that if
[1:33:58] you would leave you would sin the
[1:34:00] comforter and the comforter would have
[1:34:03] the capability to teach us these things
[1:34:06] Lord so we Just Surrender ourselves to
[1:34:08] your ways and we just pray that your
[1:34:11] will be accomplished and was
[1:34:13] accomplished here tonight pray that you
[1:34:15] would bless this people I pray that you
[1:34:17] would give them good rest tonight Lord
[1:34:19] Jesus I pray that you would bless them
[1:34:20] in their work day tomorrow Lord I pray
[1:34:23] that you would just build a hedge of
[1:34:24] protection and about them Lord that you
[1:34:26] would just bless and all that is said
[1:34:28] and done and all that we do and that's
[1:34:30] where you leave this building Lord may
[1:34:33] we leave here not as just a carnal
[1:34:35] person Lord but may we leave here with a
[1:34:39] firm Revelation that we are an eternal
[1:34:42] being that we have representation in
[1:34:44] Heavenly places
[1:34:46] and may that Comfort us and make us
[1:34:48] strong we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:53] God bless you both Chad
[1:35:00] the longer I serve him
[1:35:04] the sweeter
[1:35:10] the longer I served him the sweet
[1:35:16] later he grows
[1:35:20] grows more
[1:35:21] that I love
[1:35:24] I love them or love he loved
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:30] these days
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:50] amen I'm so glad a prophet told us
[1:35:53] what's coming next
[1:35:56] not things we need to worry about on
[1:35:59] Earth but so much has already transpired
[1:36:01] for the bride what do we have to look
[1:36:03] forward to next
[1:36:05] things that are to be that's what's next
[1:36:08] on the agenda for us will there be
[1:36:10] things that happen in the Earth yes
[1:36:12] there'll be things that happen in the
[1:36:13] Earth but I like the next message after
[1:36:15] modern events made clear by prophecy is
[1:36:18] leadership I'm sitting in my seat
[1:36:20] thinking brother banham said in the
[1:36:23] message leadership he said when you
[1:36:25] started out in life
[1:36:26] there was a hand there to take you to
[1:36:28] lead you along there was mother and
[1:36:30] father he said if you grow old enough
[1:36:32] you'll you'll go out the same way at the
[1:36:34] end of life there'll be a strong hand
[1:36:36] that holds you and leads you alone
[1:36:39] and I thought all the way back to the
[1:36:40] beginning of Adam Adam had the
[1:36:43] leadership of God he had the hand of God
[1:36:46] with the word of God but he lost the
[1:36:48] leadership of God by taking his hand out
[1:36:51] of God's hand
[1:36:52] but at the end God is taking a bride who
[1:36:55] will slip her hand right back in his
[1:36:57] hand and whatever happens on the natural
[1:36:59] we have his leadership to take us all
[1:37:01] the way and the things that are to be so
[1:37:04] the natural things don't matter we have
[1:37:06] his leadership and we know where we're
[1:37:09] going we're not to worry about the
[1:37:11] things that are on Earth
[1:37:12] and I think it was communion I may be
[1:37:14] wrong but I think it was communion where
[1:37:16] brother Branham said it was such a
[1:37:18] wonderful day when I realized I wasn't
[1:37:20] the son of Charles and Ella Branham he
[1:37:23] had come at the end to a whole different
[1:37:26] identity I say may God who has showed us
[1:37:30] what's next on the horizon
[1:37:33] may he be our leader as we slip our hand
[1:37:36] how do you slip your hand into his come
[1:37:39] back to the word
[1:37:40] and surrender to the word and let him
[1:37:43] have leadership in our lives amen it's
[1:37:47] good to know where we're at
[1:37:50] man God bless you all let's sing Brother
[1:37:52] John
[1:37:55] I stand in all within the presence of
[1:38:00] the Lord
[1:38:09] by whom the Raging of the Seas subsides
[1:38:16] The Living Sacrifice
[1:38:20] the only
[1:38:22] source of life my hope
[1:38:27] is in the Lord from this time
[1:38:38] I hope is in the Lord forevermore
[1:38:47] Lord
[1:38:50] his tender Mercy come with every Rising
[1:38:55] Sun
[1:38:57] Meet The Sinner in his Brokenness
[1:39:04] to offer healing
[1:39:06] healing for him
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:10] and those you trust in him find their
[1:39:16] hearts and rest my hope is
[1:39:34] is in the Lord
[1:39:38] forevermore
[1:39:42] oh my
[1:39:46] name
[1:39:48] [Music]

[1:40:01] in the Lord forevermore
[1:40:10] about our heads and thank God for his
[1:40:13] word their lord Jesus we're so thankful
[1:40:16] God
[1:40:18] that you brought us a word Lord that we
[1:40:20] would know where we're at Lord
[1:40:23] that you would show us Lord that you're
[1:40:25] present that you're here to take us
[1:40:28] through
[1:40:29] and not just that we'd have confidence
[1:40:31] that you're here to take us but you've
[1:40:33] showed us what you're taking us to that
[1:40:34] there's something so so much better than
[1:40:36] this life
[1:40:38] there's a place you're leading us to
[1:40:40] that's so far beyond the carnal
[1:40:42] we're not to put our Roots down here
[1:40:45] Lord that we're not to get even
[1:40:47] encumbered with this life or even
[1:40:50] depressed by what we see around us but
[1:40:52] Lord you showed us what's coming next to
[1:40:55] lift us out of this condition
[1:40:57] we're so thankful God for what you
[1:40:59] delivered to us may we never forget Lord
[1:41:03] that we're not living Lord just to
[1:41:05] obtain or just to have or for the
[1:41:08] Earthly Pleasures but we're living to
[1:41:10] fulfill your word in this day
[1:41:12] and Lord you've got a plan for us and
[1:41:14] you've showed us that plan
[1:41:16] God we put our hand in yours and you're
[1:41:19] the leadership that we're seeking to
[1:41:21] guide us toward all the way to the
[1:41:23] Fulfillment of that plan
[1:41:25] but I'm so thankful for your word God I
[1:41:28] just pray that you would help us Lord to
[1:41:31] surrender and to relax
[1:41:33] to trust Lord that you showed us that
[1:41:36] everything's going according to your
[1:41:38] plan and modern events May clear by
[1:41:40] prophecy you showed us that you're here
[1:41:42] explaining the condition by the word
[1:41:45] showing us the prophecy being fulfilled
[1:41:48] you're showing us where we're going next
[1:41:50] and you're the leader to take us there
[1:41:52] oh God how we appreciate so much what
[1:41:55] you're doing help us Lord to learn to
[1:41:58] trust to relax to rest to know it's
[1:42:01] already been told and everything's fine
[1:42:03] and that we could just be a vessel that
[1:42:06] you could use to display your
[1:42:07] characteristics in this end time may you
[1:42:10] finish the work through us
[1:42:12] take us Lord to that place you've
[1:42:15] planned
[1:42:16] God bless your children Lord as we leave
[1:42:18] from here may we go in Courage maybe go
[1:42:20] with renewed Focus may we be looking to
[1:42:23] things that are to be may we be excited
[1:42:26] with an anticipation in our heart about
