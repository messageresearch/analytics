these lips hear through our ears change us by the word we pray in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you while we're standing let's take our bibles and go to ephesians chapter one we're going to continue on with a thought from sunday sunday we were talking about the stature of a perfect man and uh we're gonna go on uh today and the subject from faith to love we'll get into some of those virtues today i don't think that i'll be able to finish it but if we're not able to finish it we'll just carry on on wednesday so i want to thank brother telus for that song it was timely god bless you for the telus appreciated that also wanted to let you know if you have not heard already that uh brother harold hildebrant from edmonton canada passed away this past week on wednesday evening i got the notification late wednesday that he had passed away and i only had the privilege of just shaking brother harold's hand one time just a few years ago but i never had the privilege of fellowship with him or knowing him but i know his reputation well he's a brother who's been very active in spreading the message he's preached this gospel for a long time he's printed books he's been a missionary traveled all over the world and so i say god rest his gallant soul amen so if you're if you're interested there'll be a memorial service this coming saturday may 7th at 11 a.m which would be edmonton time on the church's website so i just wanted to inform you of that and we just pray that god will bless his family and bless his church as they continue on in the direction he set them in and that's what he would desire for them to do i mean a lot of the old soldiers are passing away but the baton has been passed and this is our time now amen and let's not let all their work and all their labor labor be in vain but let's just take it and keep moving it forward amen god bless you as we're standing let's just read i also want to remind you we've got communion and feet washing this afternoon so we'll be coming back for that let's read in ephesians chapter 1 verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved amen god bless you as you're seated i mean the lord bless us as we look into his word i love this opening scripture we read this on wednesday but it said according has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so who chose who i love going to these scriptures we've been through him before but every time they're so exciting he chose us when did he choose us before the foundation of the world so so you know there's a security that comes with revelation and the revelation shows us that god had a purpose and a plan for us from before the foundation of the world he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love he chose us in him because christ would come and be the sacrifice the propitiation for our sins to to wash away our sins to purify us so he chose us in him that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen when we really look at this the whole plan is god's not ours the whole purpose of god's not ours the idea is his not ours amen and so we're always uh we're always uh looking at two perspectives you know what we're doing and what god's doing but sometimes we just have to back up a little bit further and go amen when you were a thought still in his mind amen before you were an expressed image on this earth before you had a chance to actually do anything in this form you're in now doing wrong or doing right or making choices in this form amen before all of that he already chose you and him so that you would be blameless before him in love so praise god without that there's no hope without him doing that there's no chance but with him already choosing amen there's nothing that can stop it from coming to pass so then it says in verse 5 and having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we were talking wednesday about adoption from birth to adoption and and that's what brother branham was talking about in the stature of a perfect man that we're birthed amen and as we're birthed that's when we recognize that we are a son or daughter of god and we are birthed into the kingdom of god and and god wants to grow us from there into maturity amen every baby that's born on this earth in a natural way was born to grow amen no matter how much we would love for them to stay tiny you know i wish you would just stay just like this amen that's not the purpose of the birth amen everything that's born is born to grow and come to maturity amen and come to the form of the thing that birthed it everything a dog a cat a human everything that's birthed in this world amen plants and all their birth they meant to grow into the image of the thing that birthed it so what do you think our purpose is on this earth amen we were predestinated unto the adoption of children in jesus christ adoption is the placing of a son as the sun grows into maturity when they hit a certain level of maturity their place positionally placed in the kingdom work amen given responsibility reflecting back the character of the father and their given responsibility to work in the kingdom so now we've been predestinated unto adoption so it's not just all my efforts trying to come to maturity i was born to mature i was born to grow i was birthed in the kingdom to take my position as an adopted son that was the purpose because it says according to the good pleasure of his will so in here it doesn't speak anything about your will so far we've not talked about you at all except you're the object that his will is being expressed in but it wasn't what you thought it wasn't what you purposed it wasn't what you decided so so far in the book of ephesians really you're out of the picture you're just the vessel that he's going to do he chose that he's had a desire for that he's going to do a work in according to his good pleasure [Music] and i say i'm so thankful it's that way because i know me and i know what i was born with and i know my genetic makeup and if it wasn't for these scriptures and this being a true reality there is absolutely no way that i could ever come to maturity and serve god in any capacity but it's not my will it's his to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved listen that scripture right there if that doesn't make your heart swell he made us accept it in the beloved i did not have to first become acceptable to be accepted in the beloved he made me without my effort he made me accept it in the beloved oh praise god there was it wasn't me working my way into a place where finally he would accept me finally he would declare his love for me finally i got good enough that he would accept me as his beloved no before all of that i was accepted in the beloved praise god amen we've got a powerpoint we're going to go through here for a little bit i've got quite a few slides but like i said i probably won't finish them but i i wanted to do this to keep us organized and get go through this together so in the quote the statue of a perfect man and this morning we want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can building the living tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the living god's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells so if you want to know what the subject statue of a perfect man is he's telling you right here in paragraph seven right from the beginning what i'm going to teach about now is the perfect man perfect we defined on wednesday perfect means mature or complete or whole it doesn't mean with never an error never a fault never a flaw perfect means you've come to completeness or wholeness amen so you come to maturity as a man or as a son and daughter of god the perfect man the living tabernacle of the living god where he dwells so what's the whole point of this is to be birthed to grow up to be a vessel that god dwells in and manifest himself in this earth in that's the whole point that's what he's talking about that's the whole point of everything he's going to say is god birthed you to grow you so that he can fill you and he can live his life through you and you're a living example a living tabernacle of the living god living inside of you his life in your flesh that's the whole point amen praise god god bless you isabella it's good to have you here amen back from germany so soon amen we're so happy god bless him amen in blasphemous names he goes on to say now when jesus had been obedient jesus to god god placed him positionally this is him we talked about this on wednesday but but brother bantam go uses the example of jesus christ and i want to take a look at this because jesus becomes the example because as he he grows amen he comes to this uh the jordan river at the appointed time and he comes and the holy ghost descends upon him and bodily form like a dove and brother branham said that pillar of fire came down and john saw it and that that that baptism in jordan brought the holy ghost upon him and led him in the wilderness to be tested and tried and brother bam tells us that's that's what happens when we're birthed by the baptism holy ghost then we go into our testings and trials amen under tutors and school masters to be taught to learn lessons to grow into maturity remember brother branham says when when god when jesus had been obedient jesus to god god placed him positionally this is him and he's speaking of mount transfiguration he says now when the number when a member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these virtues in him that god can see virtue knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and there that's when you see the sons and daughters of god so we look at we looked at this in matthew chapter 3 verse 16. this is jesus at the jordan river it says in jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and the lo the voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased so so god begins this is the birthing of the ministry of jesus christ his birth right here in the water and at that place he already declares this is my son in whom i'm well pleased so at the birth of the ministry of jesus christ there's a declaration that goes forth this is him this is my son in whom i'm well pleased i'm in this vessel and then we come to matthew 17 on mount transfiguration it says well he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and so now he repeats the phrase this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and now hear ye him now he's speaking for me amen now he's fully in my place and he is speaking for me amen and brother branham is showing typing that with us coming into adoption he shows what happened in jesus christ i show this because uh we talked about before that that there's been some confusion many times around the message because of the messy statue of a perfect man and more so by the message blasphemius names because brother bam talks about being sealed being capped being baptized with the holy ghost when all of these virtues are in you then the cat comes down and seals you and uses all this language amen but i'm going to show several quotes from there to show that brother banham has never changed his doctrine brother venom always taught that the true baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth are one and the same he goes through in the church age book amen that's why i think the church age book is so instrumental to us what a gift that god gave to us amen because there's so many questions that the church age book answers so many things that he set straight because brother branham he will change terminology amen when he's trying to describe something and as he describes it this is a man who says i wish i could explain it the way i received it he said i don't have language enough amen we know he was limited in his education but he was not limited in his revelation so he understood amen but he had to express it in a way that he could express it and we even see brother ben change his terminology and the terminology will flex with who he's speaking to trying to get the people to understand what the revelation he's trying to get across but if you watch the message from beginning to end brother branham is not changing his doctrine amen what he teaches remains true all the way through even when he changes his terminology we cannot change our doctrine as brother ram changes his terminology because the next message you come to he could change the terminology back so the point is what is he teaching us what is the lesson what does he want us to know amen that's the point amen i think sometimes uh we can we can get so fixated on the brushstrokes of the painting that we don't even know what the picture is amen my brother ben said before he says when you're going to put the the puzzle together you've got to see the picture first to put the puzzle together and sometimes i think we can be fixated on a couple puzzle pieces and it's like they go together you know i think they go together this one's rounded this way and it's got a curve up this way and and it doesn't you know how it doesn't really feel right does anybody work the puzzle but you convince yourself it's right but then later as the picture emerges you realize no that doesn't fit there that doesn't it pop it out and there's another place it fits just exactly but brother bam showed us in order to get this puzzle together you've got to see the picture that's on the outside of the box and if you look at the messages the whole brother venom has painted the picture and now when we go look at all the brush strokes and all the pieces they fit the picture so here in the beginning jesus had the holy ghost and in the end it was the holy ghost when was he a son and what part was he a son when was god using him all the way through [Music] in second peter this is where we get into the virtues where brother branham draws out the virtues in second peter chapter one verse five it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert you knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience into patient's godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so this is where brother branham takes these virtues for when he's preaching the statue of a perfect man but i'd like to note that it says we are given given unto us exceeding in great precious promises exceeding great and precious promises so these promises are given to us they're not earned they're given that by these by the promises you might be partakers of the divine nature so there is a divine nature a nature of the divine amen and that's what these these virtues all uh paint to point to they're all expressions of the divine nature and having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now in the statute of a perfect man he says after you've done come from here to here to here to here to here he's working his way up the pyramid on his chalkboard now you're coming into the full stature now the son of god but you got to have this plus this and you can't even start until you get this i wish we had that i wish we had a video of that but you can't even start till you get to this and i believe he's pointing down to the foundation faith now remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him don't try to add it till you're actually born again so you can never be born again at the top you're born again at the bottom amen you come to the realization you're a son and if you're a son then you're predestinated to adoption then then you're predestinated to be conformed into the image of the sun so you have to grow there's no option but growth you can't stay a newborn baby in christ forever you've got to grow so don't try to add that until you're actually born again because it won't work you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine born-again dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you that is such an important statement because if we look at the statute of a perfect man as a works program we're going to miss the whole point it's a growth amen it's a pattern of growth it's a maturity amen amen your children they don't have to work their way into growth all they have to do is eat and they grow amen so you don't add nothing it adds to you why you already have the seed gene of god on the inside amen the holy ghost is brooding over that seed bringing it into the image of the one who birthed it and you don't add nothing it adds to you see comes on up all right coming into perfection now now there are a lot of times where many of us pentecostals has made a mistake i think well the holy ghost has poured out on me glory to god that's all i have to have no sir you're just then getting started so the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth is just the beginning it's not then it's your test and your trial just like we find over in the old testament testing trying and then placing a son adoption placing the son after he's already a son been born into the family he's the son then he would be tested and tried and raised up by tutors and see how he comes out and then he's placed positionally equal almost to his father so you can see the goal this there's another quote here in statute of perfect man i'd like to read it says and look here having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust escaped it see you see who it's to so when you go back to peter when he's speaking of the virtues there in chapter one it's to those who have escaped the world amen so it says those who have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust escaped it see who it's to it's to the church them who are in christ amen so this divine nature is open to those who have already escaped the world amen those who are already born again those who are already in christ that's who this is written to has been exalted above these things not he exalted himself but christ brought him up and he goes to share this testimony from a sister she said i want to make this testimony for the glory of god she said now i ain't what i ought to be and she said i ain't what i want to be one thing sure i ain't what i used to be she said i had come from somewhere she had been brought up that's how we know we've passed from death unto life we look back to the pit where we were hewed from we're not what we want to be we're not what even what we're not even what we ought to be but one thing we're thankful for we're not what we used to be that's right we're on the road amen and having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and corruption of the world you're above that now now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world so you can say amen i'm not what i used to be i'm not even what i want to be or ought to be but praise god i'm not what i used to be i'm not what i was something changed something's happened and i'm on my road you may say well you're not a you're not a very good christian you're not a very good image of jesus christ and i can say that may be absolutely every bit the truth but i know i'm not what i used to be i've been changed something changed in my life i've been born again and i may still act like a child in some ways and must need to grow up but praise god i know who i am and i know what i'm growing to this message amen is not to discourage us this message is to encourage us because we've been predestinated unto adoption let's turn together to romans chapter 8. i think sometimes it's such a it's such a pity and a shame that you see people sometimes so discouraged trying to live a christian life and they the there's a legalistic mentality sometimes that is entered in and people are so discouraged and so beat down amen they seemingly never have the victory because they always look at flaws in their life and they look at the man in the mirror and they get so utterly discouraged and begin to even doubt their salvation but but when you look at the what paul wrote and you look at what brother branham preached amen it's a totally different viewpoint hey verse let's look at romans chapter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the cold according to his purpose whose purpose his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son you have been predestinated to be conformed into the image of jesus christ god decided that before the foundation of the world god chose you in him before the foundation of the world god foreknew you and predestinated you to be conformed into the image of his son it's not your idea it's god's idea it conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also justified whom he justified then he also glorified has he called you do you know he's called you then he's called you unto adoption he's predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son he's called you amen he's justified you just as if you've never done it and he's already glorified you in god's mind it's a finished work it's a done deal we're just now working out his plan we're now manifesting what was in god's mind coming into that place of adoption amen it's not something that we have to accomplish on our own it's something that's already been accomplished in the mind of god and what about those thoughts they're literal aren't they they're literal they're real it's already determined it has already happened this is now the reflection of that and this is growing into what he's already determined it to grow into amen so now let's take all the scare and all the pressure away and now let's just let a dove be a dove amen and let everything that's on the inside come out amen let's let a sheep begin to bear wool amen the sheep doesn't have brother memphis says the sheep doesn't have to concentrate to bear wool then the trihal what it has to do is it has to eat amen and it needs a shepherd amen to keep it safe and guide it into the good pastors and beside the cool water and as it eats and as it drinks and as it rests what will slow down production in any farm is a tension or sickness or disturbances but as that little sheep can come to rest under the care of the shepherd amen and it gets the good water and it gets the the good food amen it automatically bears wool amen wool just comes amen and the whole brother man said the whole christian walk is based on rest now i say that and i feel like i need to balance that it's not based on laziness amen it's not rest like lemonade in a lounge chair on the porch waiting for god god's going to make me perfect praise god i can watch the things i've always watched and talk about the things i've already talked about and god it's not spiritual laziness it's a spiritual rest amen amen where we still labor in the word of god where we still work amen we still feed we still drink we still grow amen but but it's not it's not our idea it's his idea so he provided the nutrients he provided the vitamins amen he provided the seed gene then he's the one who brought the light to quicken it and he's the one who keeps shining light for it to grow he's the one who waters it with his word he's provided everything to bring us to maturity he put the seed in you that would start the growth he quickened it to life at a certain time now he provides all the nutrients all the vitamins the right atmosphere the right sunlight he's giving it all for growth all we have to do is stay in the presence of the sun and quit running away from the shepherd and chasing after things eating weeds he told us not to eat if we just follow the shepherd and stay where he told us to go and eat what he told us to eat and trust in him and rest in his leadership will grow so it's never spiritual laziness but it is spiritual rest he goes on the statue of a perfect man to say and let me stop here a minute the sheep doesn't manufacture wool he has wool because he is a sheep you're going to grow into adoption because you're a son a lot of people try to say well i'll try to get good i'll try to do this don't manufacture nothing you can't do it a sheep doesn't isn't asked is an expected manufacturer well it bears wool and it does because it's a sheep and when you're a christian you just bear the fruit of the spirit you don't manufacture it you don't try to make it up don't make yourself something that you're not you just become what you're supposed to be and then it takes care of itself have you heard people say well i'll tell you i've joined church i really ought to quit this lying you're trying to manufacture something again now you can't do it so there's no need of trying to no more than a mule can make himself have wool he can't do it or a vulture trying to eat with a dove and a vulture trying to be a dove could you imagine a buzzard out there say you know i'm a dove and put a few feathers in him and say see i look like he'd just be all out of shape that's a man who professes to be something when he's not see you can't do it you can't say now look i'm supposed to have virtue so all have virtue i'm supposed to live godliness so i'll just have it why you're you're only trying to place feathers though they're in your reach but you can't put the feathers in the wrong bird it just won't work and it only shows that a hypocrite what a hypocrite that bird is could you imagine an old buzzer trying to have a couple of dove feathers saying look here see i'm a dove why we all know he's a buzzard that's all we can tell that he's a buzzard well no that's the way it is trying to manufacture christianity you can't do it the first thing you have to do is be born again you have to you got to be changed the very first thing you have to come to is a birth by the baptism of the holy ghost you've got to be changed something inside has to change something has to quicken something has to come alive inside of you there must the first thing you've got to do is be born if you want to grow into maturity you have to be born first and once you're born you're born to grow the first thing you have to do is be born again you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right see now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again all you have to do then is then grow praise god ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man this is the word perfect we took last time and showed that meant complete or whole or mature unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that's the goal that's when we come to a perfect man we're coming to the stature of the fullness of christ we're going to have the divine nature that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in way to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ so even in ephesians 4 here it's telling us that god sent the ministry along amen to to give the sheep food out amen to so that we could all it's for the perfecting of the saints for the growing of the saints for the work of the ministry to edify the body of christ build up this great body of christ until we come into the unity of faith until we come into a perfect man the stature of the fullness of christ that's been the goal that's the goal of preaching that's the goal of ministry if the ministry is doing something other than this the ministry has missed its point because this wasn't meant to build ministries or to build empires to build great men amen the ministry came to build the body of christ and to build individuals into perfection and now we're no more children god wants us to grow up he does not want us to remain children god wants us to grow up god has been waiting for his bride to grow up he wants brother vance said he's coming back for a fully mature bride not a little girl he wants a bride of marriage age of marriage maturity amen that's what he's come to unite to amen so this is the age of adoption this is the age of full maturity this is when the bride comes into full marriage maturity and as individuals as we grow we come into that invisible union one by one because this is the age of adoption this is the age of maturity amen he was on to say then the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of these beings he's talking about the stages and makes the complete being a tabernacle of the living god a walking living example of christianity what christ was these people are because this life is in here they are in christ and their life is dead and hid in christ through god and sealed in there by the holy ghost first corinthians 12 that's right you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith then virtue of these other things is added to to you till you're a perfect living image of god so then you're born by faith so the foundation becomes faith let's look at ephesians chapter 2. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints into the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit god wants a house amen what what tabernacle what temple will you build him but a body has not prepared when god wanted a place to dwell it wasn't solomon's temple it wasn't the tabernacle of david it wasn't the tabernacle and wilderness it wasn't the one that was rebuilt by zerubbabel but what god always wanted to do was live in flesh that was his goal from the beginning and he accomplished that in jesus christ but that wasn't the end amen that wasn't the end that was only the beginning of what god wanted to do and now god wants to live in flesh in a mini-membered body of his bride and he's been accomplishing that over seven church ages and now we've come to the capping time the completion of that amen that bride has come to full maturity growing over seven church ages and what does he want to do he wants to live in her she is the tabernacle that he wants to dwell in so he's had to bring us to maturity if we look here at the pyramid we see we've drawn the pyramid franco helped me with this powerpoint and he helped me with many of these graphics and we've got the seven colors of the rainbow and and we got the capstone so we got seven stages and we got the capping amen and the cap i we i put it in white like light because uh we've been taught we we've been taught by brother branham we've been taught for years by brother lonnie that white light contains all of these colors so all of these virtues are in god it's the divine nature all of these virtues were expressed in jesus christ because he he had the life of god he had the divine nature he was god fully expressed in man and so all of these virtues that we're talking about come from god he is the source amen and it all comes from him so when you get to the top when you get to the very capping the cap is a complete pyramid you see that so the capstone is a complete pyramid it's perfect it's absolutely perfect nothing needs to be added to it but when you look down at the pyramid the body amen it's not a perfect pyramid because without the capping it's not perfect but when the capstone comes the perfect comes to the body it becomes perfect amen it becomes the image it's growing into the image of the very thing that birthed it so what birthed the church it was god birthed the church what's the church growing into into the image of god in a female form so brother branham begins to describe the growth amend the growth of the church from infant all the way up through seven church ages any and he begins to to show that god's been building his bride over seven churches he had a plan from the beginning he's working his plan he's bringing her to full maturity but he says through the virtues he's building the individual the same way he built the church so we see in this picture of a prism which this one i like because it looks like a a pyramid it looks like the capstone amen the light coming through this amen shows that the light has seven virtues seven characteristics seven parts of the divine nature but when you put it all back together it comes back to being god amen so what what what is these divine natures what are you growing into amen when you add to this to this to this to this and you have it all amen what are you coming to you're coming to be like god you're coming in the nature of god you are going to be an earthly tabernacle of the living god reflecting to the world the divine nature of jesus christ that's the point one builds on another on another on another to bring us back into the image of god to bring us back into an expressed image of jesus christ that's the point amen brother brahman said the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual and he says it's been the holy ghost in this age that age that age that that that on up the top the holy spirit so where was the holy ghost was it at the beginning or was it at the end i say it was at the beginning the holy ghost birthed it the holy ghost captured amen alpha and omega the principle runs all the way through the bible but brother branham said it was the holy ghost that birthday it was the holy ghost that grew it and it's the holy ghost that captures it's the holy ghost all the way through amen so we can we can choose to be confused or we can just say it's been the holy ghost all the way through we're birthed by the baptism of the holy ghost we're grown by the baptism of the holy ghost growing us all the way into the full expressed image of christ what is it it's the holy ghost it was the holy ghost in this age in that age it's been the holy ghost in your life all the way through you're not trying to get to the holy ghost it was the holy ghost growing you back into himself it says blasphemies name he said but you cannot join the church of the living god you're born into it by the baptism of the holy ghost so how are you born by the baptism of the holy ghost and when you're baptized with the holy ghost these virtues are sealed in you by the holy ghost and therefore he that's born of god does not commit sin cannot there you are so many times when i begin to draw out the statue of a perfect man for people or or when i'm thinking about it myself we start from the bottom faith and work our way up but this morning i'd like to start from the top but i don't want to start from the top and work my way down i want to start from the top because the top is the goal the top is the source the top is the beginning and the top is the end it's god it's the divine nature and this is the this is a quote that i'd like to take that idea from so now in building the virtue building this monument building this stature it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for god is love and he controls he is the strength of every one of these things that's right right in here right in here you see i got in between all these works in here he's showing again on the blackboard and here these little waves come what is that the holy ghost comes down through christ see the holy spirit the holy spirit is above all of this welding this together building a what a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off so so brother brennan said the holy ghost is above all of this welding it all together what's he doing it was the baptism of the holy ghost that birth you and you come to birth and you start to grow into maturity but it is god amen it is the life of christ standing over you drawing life out of you amen pulling you up amen what are you doing you're growing into all things into the head you're growing the body is growing up to meet the head that's what's happened to the church ages the body's growing up to meet the head what are you doing you're growing up to meet the head and the head is the thought the mind of god the the it is god himself they're drawing you building you up into himself the holy ghost is the strength of every one of these virtues is the holy ghost that birth you it's the holy ghost that's growing you and what's he growing you do he's pulling you to himself so we start with faith now this is the beginning of our walk because it begins by faith everything in the kingdom of god is acquired by faith everything begins by faith amen god even himself operates by faith because god spoke his word but he had to believe his own word for it to appear so even god operates by the law of faith everything in the kingdom of god operates by faith and we come to a birth by faith but well we'll get to that in a minute ephesians chapter 2 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god so now this is not even your faith to begin the journey this is i hope we've established one thing for sure today that that you're just the vessel that he's using this is his plan his work his strength his virtues his drawing power his coming to you for a birth it's his word it's his everything his plan his foreknowledge his predestination his power history it's his absolute everything that he's doing in you and he's over all of this drawing it up and welding it all together so by grace you're safe through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of god now again in the stature of perfect man he says notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him so faith is the starting point for us at birth you come to a birth by faith and he says jesus the apostle paul says in galatians 5 for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so how does faith work by love where is love god is love the capstone so faith worketh by love what's he doing he's above all of this welding it all together putting it in growing it up bringing maturity amen what was it that brought faith grace what's grace a product of his love brother brennam says grace and love are twin sisters so what was that grace that bro that that gave me faith it was his love expressed to me and faith worketh by love what does it work by by the capstone by the head so my the point here is you can't even begin on the first level without the capstone already working in your life god already has the goal predetermined he knows where you're coming it's not that god is holding off and saying i'm not going to use him i'm not going to adopt him into the family until i know for sure that he's the right one he already knows you're the right one amen before you got started before you were born he knew you were the right one so now all the ingredients are in place and he's hovering over this what is it the holy ghost over your life welding these virtues together building in you into the image of god because what he wants is a tabernacle to live in to express himself through how can god express himself when you hate and lie and cheat and steal and how is that vessel expressing god god has to get this thing shaped into his image so it's a perfect expression in hebrews 11 he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith you can't even please him without faith i can't please god so how do i get faith it's a gift it's a gift that comes from his love because faith worketh by love we love him because he first loved us i can't even please god without faith but god wants me to please him so he gives me faith oh i hope we can see the picture and the message the identification of christ in all ages he says therefore he and his word is the same so his word is perfect if you don't believe that don't never come in the prayer line because that's the only basis that you can accept anything faith can only take its rest upon something that's sure of and the real genuine faith rests itself on the eternal rock of god's eternal word it doesn't shift it stays right there regardless so the foundation of your maturing in christ is based on another foundation so your foundation is on a foundation and what is the foundation your faith on it's on the word of god because this whole building is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief cornerstone what is that it's the word amen what is our faith based on our faith is always based on the word our faith just doesn't float around but our faith is anchored to something and that anchor that it's anchored to is the word of god amen so what a sure foundation that you and i have because we're built upon the rock and the word is christ so we're built on christ growing into christ christ in the beginning christ in the end alpha and omega he says now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation and say boy i got her you got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now a house this foundation is first what is the foundation of christianity faith in the word of god that's your foundation then you begin to grow then you start you begin to add to this foundation so your foundation starts with faith in the word of god and faith is a revelation you have to have a revelation of your sonship you have to have a revelation of god calling you a revelation that you're a son of god amen is the basis that all of this starts on and that revelation amen to me is such a fundamental revelation that i know who i am amen i know that i am a child of god and that revelation that faith starts me on my journey to grow amen what am i a son of god who birthed me god what am i growing to god amen a wheat grows to look like a wheat amen a cocker bowl grows that will look like a cockle bird but praise god by this foundation based on the word of god i believe that i'm a son of god [Music] and so what do i expect to grow into i don't expect to grow into a raft about i don't expect to grow into a castaway i don't expect to grow into something with another image or something that reflects laodicea i expect because of my revelation that i will grow into the very image of jesus christ that's my target that's my whole heart that's my whole goal i'm not starting off afraid i won't make it but i'm starting on the rock of the word amen which said i was predestinated unto adoption i'm starting with a revelation of what my end will be [Music] i think that's what creates so much turmoil is i hope i make it i hope i can be this i hope i can be good enough i hope i have this and i hope i won't stumble too much and i hope the rapture won't come till i'm finished god's baking me i'm in the oven i i hope that the rapture doesn't come until the timer goes off amen there's no way amen you were predestinated before the foundation of the world in him to be blameless before him in love love started this journey love finishes this journey it's the love of god to you god's choice and it's what is it it's god loving himself that's why brother bennett said you can no more be lost in god can be lost let that be the rock that you're playing and let that be the foundation of this journey that i am part of god i come from god i'm going to god i mean i've got a lot of growing to do but i'm not worried about it i'm just going to sit here buy this stream drink this water eat this grass stay in the sun and it's going to come out of me but with that revelation it helps us to make other choices the distractions amen that can distract a sheep shiny things in the distance attractive sounds curious noises curious images amen when we know what our target is and we know where we're going and we know what we're on this earth for it helps us so much not to chase all the nonsense that's in line hey listen we live in laodicea you can do anything you want to do i mean it's it's available to you you can learn anything you want to learn amen you've got you've got access to funds you can get loans you can use credit cards you can save up money you can get a second job if you really want something you can do you can start a new hobby you can chase some interest and all of that can be a distraction and and that distraction amen can begin to slow down our growth but when we start on the basis of faith of who we are and what the trajectory is and where we're going to wind up then all of a sudden you say i don't need that i don't need that i don't need that and i'm not even talking about sinful things some of these things are not sin they're not wrong further education is not sin necessarily amen switching jobs necessarily is not sin having a hobby is not necessarily sin amen but it can definitely be a distraction off the point amen the purpose that god puts you on this earth and when you know your purpose all our decisions can line to that purpose i am here to reflect god i am here to be a living tabernacle a living image of a living god a written epistle read of all men i am not here for my purpose i'm here for his purpose i was not born again so that i could go chase my own desires he birthed me to grow me into his image so that i would reflect him so there's so many things in life that we could just do without and nobody has to rip them out of our hands nobody has to get up and say don't ever do this and don't ever do that and if you do that i mean of course the minister will always warn against traps and warn against things but when you really catch the vision of who you are and what your purpose says all of a sudden you say i don't need that i can lay that down i don't need it i don't want it amen nobody has to come into your house and do an inspection and make sure you're not secretly watching tv on some alternative device you see what i mean like you don't have to have a tv anymore you know it used to be it used to be easy to go inspect the believer's house you just open the cabinet doors you know but now it's in your pocket now it's everywhere so so god has made it so it's so perfect this satan is so perfect to prove the seed of god it's so perfectly designed to magnify the nature of god because only the divine nature will overcome this world so now it's the revelation that gives us the ability to set things down it's the revelation that gives us the desire to turn away from certain things not because somebody else in the church will find out and not because somebody will preach it against it and i'll feel bad but all of a sudden it doesn't fit into the picture god's painted for my life it doesn't match amen where i'm going it doesn't help me get to where i'm going so so many of these things can become distractions and eat up so much time but we can say i don't need it i don't want it and nobody has to force the issue so our foundation is a revelation our foundation is faith that worketh by love now i'd like to look at virtue the next one and jesus said who touched me then all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude thronged thee and pressed thee and sayest thou who touched me and jesus said somebody has touched me for i perceive that virtue has gone out of me jesus was a display of the divine nature and here he was passing through a crowd and a woman with a blood issue for 12 years she touched to him of his garment and drew virtue out of christ and he he felt it he sensed it he stopped and said who touched me he knew that virtue had gone out of him and brother ben says well if i'm going to to be like jesus i've got to have virtue brother man tells us virtue is strength amen there was a certain strength that was in christ a virtue that this woman could tap into for her healing he said i've got to have virtue and past that that it can pass forward from me to people because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you've got to have it first you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw virtue out of us and the check would return it's insufficient funds what a simple concept but brother ben said before somebody can draw virtue out of you there must be virtue in you to draw out first they can't draw something that's not there and when you look around so many times in christianity and even amongst our fellow brothers and sisters you find people who barely have enough strength to serve god for themselves can barely get to church can barely keep it together can barely and then anything goes wrong in their life they miss you know three four services because they just don't have enough strength to deal with and can't even hardly bring themselves to church and raise their hands and worship god because of the trials and the tribulations and the stresses and all that amen but god wants to build enough strength amen you've got to have strength to walk in this life and where does strength come from it comes from christ it comes from the holy ghost he's over this welding these things together amen in the revelation built upon revelation will come strength amen because the revelation will bring us strength the life of christ will bring us strength not just strength so we can be a christian strength so that somebody else can draw virtue out of us the virtue he's talking about is not just strength to endure the world strength to stand against laodicea you've got to have that strength plus strength for someone else amen so it's not we can look at ourselves when we get into these things and if anything that's preached today begins to strike a spot just just go to the lord and say lord you've promised by these promises that i can be a partaker of the divine nature and i find in myself a lack of virtue but i believe that by these divine promises i'm a partaker of the divine nature i need you to pour into me virtue i need more strength than i have right now i mean i can barely make it through the week i can barely hold it together i can barely keep confessing a positive confession amen and i've got to keep going back and i need somebody else amen and there's there's some amongst us that's always drawing strength from somebody else got to get with the brother got to talk to somebody else about their problems got to have somebody else pray with them again and that's fine because all of us are on different stages we have brothers who are just born and sisters just born they need our virtue but some at some point we've got to grow that god puts virtue in us amen do i don't constantly have to go amen and draw from somebody else just so i can make it another week draw from somebody else just so i can overcome this trial amen god can pour the divine nature into me because by the promise i have a right to be a partaker of the divine nature it's for me it's part of my growth i can have enough strength to make it in this world i can have enough strength to overcome trials i can have enough strength to testify to witness to pray for somebody else to stand in the gap for so i can have enough strength that somebody can come and draw from me so if you find yourself always drawing and no one drawing from you go to the lord say lord i need that virtue i find lacking and god revealed to me anything in my life that's plugging the channel because i promise you the problem is not on god's side [Music] so say god revealed to me if there's anything i know this is my destiny i know this is where i'm going i know this is what you call me to don't start the question of well maybe i'm not a believer get that out of your mind now you should have got that out at the foundation that's why sometimes we can never go on to the right kind of strength because we're still questioning the first level am i a child of god or not have i been born again or not and then there's never never strength we can never grow in strength we can never have greater strength we can never have strength for somebody else because we're still questioning step one step one is based on the word and a revelation of the word go back and say god let me see myself in your word who am i god and from faith then add to your faith virtue say god i need more strength god i want to stand like you would stand isn't that the point to have godlike virtue holy ghost virtue not just this is not gritting teeth and bearing it kind of virtue this is not brother chad said something about always going to some people so i'm not going to go talk to anybody else i'm going to be stronger that will never work never work this has to be holy ghost virtue something that comes from the seed within and is grown up by the holy ghost as he's drawing more of the divine nature out of the seed more out of the sea gene of god what is the seed gene of god it contains the potentials of god and the holy ghost is drawing all those potentials out in our life and god wants us to have virtue not just so we can make it through another week not just so i can get back to the service again on wednesday and then get back on sunday but god wants us to have another an enough virtue that somebody can come to us and draw it out somebody at work somebody in our family a another brother or sister somebody who needs virtue that i can't say i'm sorry i'm too weak and i'm too tired to help you when you're going to start serving the body of christ you're going to have to have virtue because there's needs out there and when people begin to talk and when they want to counsel and they want prayer and they want you to pray for them it draws virtue out of you jesus felt it come out of him jesus and brother brenham said you see why i get weak he said it's all of you you're pulling amen you're pulling on that gift and it's drawing virtue out of the prophet of god and he would get so weak he'd begin to stagger in the pulpit amen and he would go home and he would be crying as they took him away and telling them to take him back home then they'd walk him on the streets so he'd come to himself he'd go back to prayer he'd go back that night into his hotel room pray and he come back the next day and do it all over again why because he was a son of god expressing god's virtue amen and god does wants us to have enough virtue not just to live in laodicea he wants to have enough virtue that you can be a tap a source a virtue for somebody who needs virtue so that somebody at work amen where they can begin to draw virtue from you and somebody else can draw virtue from you and you still have enough virtue to make it to live to survive i say god give us more virtue this is real holy ghost virtue now we want to look at knowledge it says and then thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to god but knowledge to judge to judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your creeds and all your unbelief and everything that you claim to have done then you have knowledge to believe that god cannot lie let every man's word be a lie but mind true now you're getting knowledge that's supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by god to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of god yes sir and add knowledge because knowledge of his word amen i think this is so astounding that god wants us to have knowledge not worldly knowledge but knowledge of the word because that when you're building to the the statue of a perfect man you're coming to the image of christ amen you have to start with a revelation with faith enough to know you're a son of god and upon that you need some strength to operate in this life but as you gain some strength to operate you need some knowledge some understanding to understand the plan of god and what's going on amen you know the whole idea is i don't want to know all the details i just want to i just want to just just i just want to know god well god is the one who gave all the details you understand god is the one who brought the message god is the one who preached the seals god is the one who gave the interpretation of the symbols god gave information because god wants us to know his plan he wants us to know what was in the back part of his mind amen knowledge has a way of settling us and raising us over situations and giving us eyes to see when we know the purpose and plan of god god wants us to have word knowledge holy ghost knowledge of the word if not you're like a child tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine every wave of doctrine he doesn't want us to be children that's what he said in ephesians he wants us to grow up into the full stature of christ no more his children toss to and fro by every wind of doctrine he doesn't want everybody to be able to sway us this way and sway us that way he doesn't want somebody to come and line up two quotes and move us all the way over here and then come later with two other quotes and swing us all the way over here but he wants to give you a revelation of his word knowledge of his word to establish us so we're not tossed all about that we get the big picture because god has given us enough information to paint the picture he has revealed his word in this day he's tied together all the loose ends you want to talk about details this message is so full of details it'll blind you if you try to swallow it all at once detail upon detail upon dj and brother branham said when he's preaching the seals he goes i could preach a month of sundays i could just go around and around that clock and still not touch one of those seals there's so much there and it's there for us amen it's not for us to say i mean i don't need to know that you need to do it god gave it he wants you to have godly knowledge but not like a textbook not intellectualism not to pass a test not to recite a bunch of phrases and prove that you're something but he wants you to be established by the knowledge of god amen that's why we're preaching that's why we're teaching that's why we go over these things amen because god's building in us knowledge it's part of the statue of a perfect man he said you're getting to be pretty good man right now see you're coming up what with with faith and virtue the knowledge you see how it's building this man you can see there's no way escaping it this is the way to become in the full stature of christ there's no way to get around it you've got to go through these processes and if you notice as you add to this to this to this to this it's growing more and more and more into the image of christ it's shaping more and more to begin to reflect what it's looking at so as we grow we're losing more of ourselves in becoming more like him more and more it's less of us and more of him and so god wants us to have this biblical knowledge this holy ghost knowledge second corinthians he says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ jesus christ was the reflection of god and he shined in our hearts to give us the the light of the knowledge of the glory of god god wanted us to know something about himself that's why he came in the form of man so that we could he could be we could understand god better that is why he came in flesh to redeem us he wants us to know something about him god had a mystery hidden in the back part of his mind but that mystery he wanted somebody else to know it he wasn't always going to keep it a secret he wasn't always going to stay in the back of art of his mind it wasn't always going to be hidden and that mystery contained knowledge understanding information and in due season he took what was in the back part of his mind and he brought it out through a prophetic ministry and brought it through the lips of a prophet because there was something god wanted his bride to know and i say thank god for that we need holy ghost knowledge we need to be established in the word we can't listen we can't live this whole life by feelings because your feelings will change so many people want to know the holy ghost or not by feelings i feel this way and i feel that way your feelings will end up derailing you somewhere you have to have holy ghost knowledge of the word to check your feeling with because god didn't god gave us his word as our foundation not our feelings amen but you don't operate without feelings god leads us personally individually but we have to have still a rock somewhere because our feelings are too fickle and they move all over the place we can't just serve god by feelings we have to know the word amen and when god leads us god leads you god god definitely leads by an inward word and he can move you and he can lead you and he can speak to you amen but you've got something knowledge to know what is this voice that's speaking to me it's god because it matches the word praise god in ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints that's why paul was preaching paul was preaching so that you would know so that you would know the word so that you would have the word so that you would be established in the word so that you'd grow up into christ and not be tossed by every wind of doctrine but that you would god would share knowledge with us in his word so that we would be established enough that when everything comes along you don't have to move instantly you can say hold on let me check this with the word you don't have to sweep off on the one side and sweep off in the other you say come back and say but god sent us a prophet and that prophet unlocked the mind of god let me come back to this word amen i've got something that we're building up into the image of christ and as we grow up and get higher this this holy ghost knowledge comes in can't get there without it brother said i believe in genuine holy ghost knowledge holy ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with amen when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the bible you sit down and study it and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the holy spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you get it that's knowledge praise be to god what is this knowledge is god revealing the word amen and showing you it's not a contradiction even in the message even the message we're talking about today seemed like a contradiction he said the baptism of holy ghost is your birth then he says the capping off is the baptism of the holy ghost and statue of a perfect man it looks like a contradiction but let the holy ghost knowledge come in and say there is no contradiction here amen what is he teaching what is he getting me to understand what's it going to take holy ghost knowledge or else we're going to get hung up in the contradictions in the bible and the contradictions in the message you say what yeah one time brother ben will say something like this and later he'll say it like this and if you take it on surface just surface value amen with no understanding whatsoever it looks like maybe they're a polar opposite statement it's going to take some holy ghost knowledge to go a little deeper amen it's going to take some holy ghost knowledge in the word to say god what is this and pray about it and wait for the holy ghost and all of a sudden you see it tied together through the whole message through the bible back and forth and all of a sudden you say i got it i understand now i know and guess what that thing will never trip you up again when that holy ghost knowledge comes nobody will sway you off with that nobody will trip you on that amen god has put another rock down in your heart and you know what he's talking about and god's not going to use that amen he's not going to use any of that to trip you up anymore praise be to god we love holy ghost knowledge holy ghost virtue holy ghost faith i want to look at temperance temperance this is out of the concordance temperance means self-control the virtue of one who's mastered his desires and passions especially essential appetites brother branham he says it this way i didn't put on the overhead because it's a long quote but he says fourthly we'll have to hurry because it just feels so good to stand here and talk about it amen fourthly and temperance oh my we've come to temperance now you've had faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add temperance temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol hear either no no tempers doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is bible temperance holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh but we're talking about the holy spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a tattler how to control your temper not fly off every time everybody speaks across to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why god is not in his church doing miracles and things that he used to do yes sir see and these things add temperance to it oh temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you that means there's no such thing as road rage in the divine nature so if you find yourself mad at everybody on the road we need a little more temperance we need the divine nature amen not that you can't point out somebody did something wrong because i mean there's some bad things that happen but i'm talking about when you just can't even get over it amen you're just getting the rage you get so mad and you want to blare your horn and run up on somebody's bumper because you're so mad that they cut you off or they did this or that i'm telling you if that's where you're at and you need to go back to the lord say i need holy ghost temperance i need something to flow out of me to overcome this old nature that's inside of me amen at temperance oh temperance how to answer in kindness when rather spoke to you somebody say you bunch of holy rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now not that but talk with godly love temperance kindness is that the way you want to be when you're all riled up rile not back let him be your example when when they said if you be the whole the son of god turn these stones in the bread he could have done it he showed he was god but he had temperance then when they called him beelzebub he said i'll forgive you for it that's right they pulled handfuls of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had seen him perform miracles by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth like that they put a rag around his head like that around his eyes and hit him on the head with a stick and said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had he had temperance now if you've got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and sass and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't got no you you can't add that because it won't add it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it with a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubberisc and when your faith and your temperance becomes the same kind of holy ghost temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it when your virtue is like his virtue then it will add to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge i come to do th thy will o god see with the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a man-made half-way soused up belief or temperance oh i ought to slap him down but maybe i better not because they might not put my name in the paper about they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith [Music] so as we come up more and more into the image of christ higher in the divine nature now we come to temperance which is self-control and where where instead of getting angry and fussing and talking back now there's a whole different approach to all of these situations and it's got to be the kind of temperance he had and then you see moses failed in temperance moses got angry because they kept pushing him and pushing him and pushing him and finally he grabbed his staff and and smote the rock a second time which was not according to the word of god and it was lack of temperance that kept him out of the promised land but you see david a man after god's own heart he had temperance when when when saul his enemy that's chasing him and trying to kill him and speaking evil of him and chasing him and trying to destroy his life he comes into the same cave where david and his men are hiding and he lays down and goes to sleep and his men begin to tell him you can take him look god has delivered him to you they start even using religious talk trying to convince him to kill his enemy and and saul was doing evil to david david on a human level had every right to retaliate but david had knowledge and that knowledge was he's been anointed by the prophet he's been anointed by god to be king and that knowledge brought him temperance and said how dare i touch god's anointed and he had self-control although he was evilly mistreated evenly spoke about deceived and trapped and almost killed my soul when saul came in even the religious rhetoric of his closest friends saying god has delivered him to he wouldn't even move past that because he had knowledge and knowledge he added to his knowledge temperance and now he had self-control and he would not touch god's elect he would do no harm to the anointed of the lord and he went down and he cut a little section off of his skirt amen and when saul went out he stood up on the mountain and he yelled back to him and all that had happened but i spared you and he had this great discourse and even then he repented that he even cut the hem of his skirt even said that was too much and and all of his buddies were like too much i mean you didn't he was in your hands but he had temperance that's the kind of temperance that god wants us to have then when you have every right every opportunity you you can you can you can really i mean you can really let them have it because they've been pushing and pushing and pushing and now finally i've got the open window i've got every right i'm in the right i've got the right words amen but if you're doing that in retaliation if you're doing that out of hurt if you're doing that to get back and you need some temperance and say i'm not going to take my rights and i'm not going to say anything although it's the truth i'm not going to speak because it's it's meant to hurt so many people think they can say anything they want if it's true you'll see people sometimes say something to somebody it's so rude so cutting so sharp and you say something to them say but it was the truth jesus could have said a lot of things that was the truth but he didn't say a word when he stood before pilate he could have said a lot of things but he didn't speak when he was on the cross he could have said a lot of things that would have been every bit the truth but he kept his peace all he said is father forgive them we think sometimes we have a right to cut people down or set the record straight or expose somebody's sin or something like that and then we feel justified because it's the truth i think what we need is some holy ghost temperance to say what good would it do anyways it won't change them if you speak the truth you have to speak the truth in love so don't be angry at a brother and want to stick it to him and say i'm just saying this because i love you that doesn't justify what you're getting ready to do amen you have to really love them to say the truth not say you love them just to clear up you know i've already okay i love you okay now i'm going to cut you to the heart in front of your wife and your children but i already said i love you and i said it in love so it's the truth and i'm okay no we need some temperance to control ourselves no retaliation there's no there doesn't need to be any retaliation you know jesus didn't even set the record straight so many false accusations so many things were said against him so many lies defaming his character calling them bails above doubting his birth all these things uh they were coming against him amen denying his place in scripture denying his sonship all of these things and he never set the record straight he let them believe whatever they wanted to believe he had absolute temperance he was just going to do what god told him to do i mean so many times we're so tempted when somebody spoke evil about us or said something or a rumor comes full circle and comes around and you know that's not true hey you know what sometimes it doesn't do any good to set the record straight and most of the time when you try to set the record straight you look guiltier sometimes that's just the trap of the devil to get you in a little deeper jesus didn't pay the time of day to it he kept doing what the father called him to do and i think it's a good habit for us does not pay any attention to the rhetoric not pay any attention to the accusation of somebody at work he's trying to defame your character trying to take credit for your work just let it go let god expose it when god does it's way better anyways you're not here for a promotion and you're not here for a good name at work you're here to serve god's purpose and if it god's purpose he has you in that job and you need a good standing in that job god will right the wrong and when god writes the wrong i mean nobody can work like god can work and nobody can fix a situation like god can fix the situation in fact if you keep quiet and have temperance and have and you just wait on the lord and have patience you watch god work by the time god's done you'll feel sorry for that man or woman that's what will happen you'll have sympathy for them and because i mean you could have been so upset so hurt and have such a temptation to go set the record straight because you know that they would be in big trouble you didn't do anything wrong they did it wrong they're lying blah blah blah whatever but you just hush up and have temperance control yourself and stay in the line god puts you in and when god solves that problem you end up saying oh god help them i'm sorry i didn't want that to happen to them you'll feel so sorry for them amen what is it going to take holy ghost temperance just to say if i say anything it won't change anything i could tell them but what's it going to matter i'm i'm going to be under control of my emotions my tongue i am going to possess my vessel because he taught us how we ought to possess our vessel and by the grace of god with his holy ghost leadership i want to possess this vessel for the glory of god i need some holy ghost temperance because this vessel still has a sticky cockapoo nature to it if you poke this vessel the first thing he wants to do is poke you back is that right amen but there's something else coming on the inside that now when you poke me all i want to do is say father forgive them they didn't mean that somebody tells a lie about you you say you know father just forgive them for my sake i don't want any harm to come their way a whole different level of self-control not reformation not holding yourself back not gripping the seat so you don't honk the horn that's not temperance that's not holy ghost temperance not where you have to be patient all day long and just then all of a sudden something horrible flies out of my mouth we need some temperance amen it's not counting to 10. it's not five deep breaths that's not temperance temperances say god hey i need i need to have temperance like you have temperance i need temperance and me to reflect your temperance amen and every one of us can find some of these virtues that our old sticky cockapoo nature has a hard time with and that gives us a way to come back to god over and over and say god i by the promise you've given to me am a partaker of the divine nature but i'm having problems with temperance please god give me more temperance according to your word amen i need it to come natural amen i need it to come natural i need it to be a natural outflow of me because i can't always remember to count to ten and i can't always stop to take five deep breaths but i need a divine nature to come in and give me temperance and when i'm riled against i round not back that when somebody speaks evil i want to say something nice because i know the judgment of god is coming down the pike and i just want to do something to temper that i i by the knowledge god's given us by the faith in who we are by the strength that he's given us by by the knowledge in the word of what what we're here for and what's going on bring us into a temperance that no matter what happens around me and what people do to me i can recognize that it's not me that they're afflicting god because this is the vessel that god has chosen to manifest himself in he is building this into a living epistle a living tabernacle of a living god and then all of a sudden you can say oh don't do that god help them forgive them because you know that they're in big trouble amen not because of you because of god amen and so now we come to a different understanding of who we are and what we're here for and it brings us the knowledge this the the faith the virtue the knowledge brings us into temperance you know when brother branham said so many people are trying to get on the ladder up here and they fall and crack their head you've got to get on the bottom you've got to start off by knowing you're a son of god and then as the son of god he gives you strength to live and strength for others and then understanding and knowledge of the word and then brings you into temperance and the higher you go the more like jesus christ you look like you get somebody who has control over their emotions who doesn't get fly off the handle doesn't get upset doesn't fight back doesn't talk back doesn't talk about other people isn't sharp and isn't cutting you get somebody like that and you begin to see the reflection of jesus christ in their life because there's holy ghost temperance working there has anybody found a place to pray today i have in preparing this i'm like oh god i want a little more of that and i want a little more of that and i need a whole lot more of that i'm not going to tell you which one my wife already knows but you realize it's yours to have it's not a straining and a and struggling and a trying it's a recognizing and you know if we ask of our father bread will he not give us a stone if we ask him for meat will he give us a scorpion or a serpent amen if our if our earthly father knows how to give us good gifts how much more so our father in heaven gives the holy ghost to them that ask for what about those that are asking for his divine nature will he give it to you when you recognize lord i need some more this i find in myself it's still not reflecting you the way i want it to god would you come and give me more temperance lord would you give me more faith lord would you give me more virtue and he'll give it to you because by these promises you're a partaker of the divine nature so go as a partaker of the divine nature and partake of the divine nature say god i'm coming for more temperance i'm coming i need more because i'm here to reflect you i'm here for your purpose i'm here for your plan and i see a need and god i'm coming to the only source that can supply that need i could try harder and i will try harder but my try harder will fail i want to do better i want to try harder but no matter how much i want it'll fail what i need lord is for you to pour more of that holy ghost nature in me because above me is love god himself molding all of this into me all i got to do is look to a god who loved me first and in love go to a god who loved me and say god would your love give me more temperance what do you think he'll say do you think he'll refuse you no i think he'll honor that kind of prayer say god this is marring the image and i gotta reflect you come and help me god amen god bless you we're not going to go on we'll go on on wednesday i don't want to go any longer let's all stand musicians if you could come brother ben if you make it up let's just bow our heads and pray right here lord jesus we thank you father for your word god what would we do without this message there's so much calvinistic armenian confusion in the world we wouldn't know what to do we wouldn't know where to go we'd be fussing with one another and arguing about what way is right but oh god how you've painted a different picture for us you've sent the illumination through a prophet to illuminate this word to tie together the loose ends that were lost the church ages to bring us back to the right understanding of birth and adoption and god we're so thankful for eyes to see and ears to hear but god i don't want to know the doctrine i want it to become the reality in my life i'm so thankful that you give us understanding that we know lord what you're doing in our lives but i don't want just the understanding of what you're doing i want the evidence flowing through me i want that holy ghost faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and love i want it all flowing through me god so i yield myself in a greater way to you take preeminence mold yourself into this vessel help me god to die to my own thinking and die to my own ways and die daily and let these virtues live in me for i know that without you it is impossible but i'm so thankful that you foreordained it lord and predestinated it for me so father we as a body of believers are coming we're coming this morning to the inexhaustible fountain of love we're coming to that that great white light where all these virtues come from coming to the fullness of our father and we're saying father i need more of this in my life i need to be a partaker of this divine nature god would you pour it into me as i yield myself to you pour into us lord this rainbow effect lord that comes from the light and bring us back to reflect that same light lord paint all these virtues in us this is the hour we're not asking for anything that's not for available we're not expecting anything that you haven't told us is for us in this hour that we're on this earth this is our part to play this is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of god this is the time for you to be expressed in full measure in the life of your bride this is the day when individuals can come into the full stature of jesus christ god we're only asking for you to do what you promised to do and we're coming with faith knowing that you will do a good work in us let these virtues abound in us may they grow and abound that we may never fail we love you father we ask you bless us as we go from here as we go into our fellowship and come back for communion keep us lord by your grace help us to grow
