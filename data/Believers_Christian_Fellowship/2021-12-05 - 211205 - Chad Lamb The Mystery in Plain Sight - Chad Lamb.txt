amen let's just give the lord a hand and thank god for a safe delivery amen god is so good amen so we're thankful she squeezed it in this year because we've had a lot of babies we needed another one amen so it worked out good amen also want to remind you of the meetings up at brother dan ratliffs and near ann arbor michigan this weekend brother ben will be preaching up there saturday and sunday amen let's take a look at colossians chapter 1 verse 25 says whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory may god bless you as you're seated amen i don't know how many times we've read that scripture i don't i couldn't imagine maybe hundreds of times but it always brings me joy to read that scripture amen that is a passage of scripture brother benham opens with when he preaches christ is the mystery of god revealed and we know that there's been a mystery hid from the foundation of the world the mystery would have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory i pray that god will help us to understand that that scripture become more of a reality day by day amen and hour by hour in our lives i'd like to read just a little bit out of christ as the mystery of god revealed amen right after brother branham reads that portion of scripture he says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want us i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed amen we've talked many many times and talked about this that if we we hear what brother branham's wanting to say but we get the wrong mental picture from the beginning then we're going to miss the rest of what he's bringing us in this message where he's telling us he wants to base he's reads that for a text but he wants to base this sermon upon the entire bible so he's going to be preaching the entire bible and he wants to title it christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed now if we if in our minds as soon as he says that we picture amen the vessel of jesus christ the body that god expressed himself in and we limit everything he's going to say to that one manifestation amen then we're going to miss the rest of the message but we have to understand what he's talking about he's preaching the entire bible and in the entire bible christ is the mystery of god revealed and it's christ amen the anointed word for each age revealing god through the entire bible so it was all of that was wrapped up in jesus christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was the full expression and one vessel of all of that truth was expressed there but it wasn't the only place it was expressed it was also expressed down through the bible amen and it was it's continually being expressed that christ is the mystery of god revealed even being expressed in our day so we can't start amen this understanding this message with the wrong mental picture amen we have to have the right mental picture then we're going to understand what brother banh is telling us amen so christ is the mystery of god revealed amen and it's based on the entire bible he said now i took in an order sunday school lessons so we could all read together and have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so so it's self-explanatory but god has had a plan nothing in the bible and nothing through time is happening haphazardly there's so many things that look like they're they're they're in chaos and they're just happening and and things are happening and then there's reactions to actions and and all of it in our perspective from an earthly perspective it looks chaotic amen we can even look at our lives and things that happen to us and it looks chaotic but brother branham said there's nothing out of kilter there's everything's just right on time the clock's ticking right on time with god's plan and nothing happens to a predestinated son or daughter of god without first god giving approval for him because we see that in the book of job when job was going through his crisis and gone giving approval god was in control of job's trial is that right god was in control of job's trial he was putting limits and boundaries and permissions amen to the devil and so god was showing us in job that he is in control amen even when we come into the dark ages and and we see that that that there's a voice that comes from in the in the i think it's the third seal under the black horse rider there there is a voice that comes from the throne amen says that her a penny of wheat for a measure and penny of barley for a measure see thou heard not the oil and wine amen and that voice coming from the midst of the throne amen was the voice of the lamb the lamb was in control even in the dark ages there was persecutions in the church and there was difficulties that they were going through and the true christianity was almost wiped out then but the lamb was still putting boundaries on the trial so it looks like sometimes we look at our lives and it looks like chaos we're standing in situations sometimes we don't know if it's going to go right or if it's going to go left we're standing here and we ourselves have no idea what the next step is going to be and it looks like there's no solution oh i don't know if you've ever lived long enough to get into a position where you could not see a solution if you ever did and you're here now you've been in a good place because you find that god brings a solution where you never expected a solution god knows the next step but he knew the next step before the foundation of the world it's us who didn't understand and so that's been the problem with the bible and bible scholars for all these years is because we had limited perspective trying to understand and make sense out of what we read in the bible and we've looked at it amen it's it's like trying to i i say it this way it's like trying to understand eternity looking through a people you get a little view of this and then maybe you get a little view of that but you can never see the whole picture amen that's why god in the end time came and opened the seals and took the seals off of the bible so we can get more than a people view here in this book and in this book and in this book amen that's what brother branham is doing and christ is the mystery of god revealed he's coming after the seals and he's trying to take the people off of abraham and the people off of noah and the people off of the judges and he's trying to back up and say this is all the same thing this is all expressing the same thing it's expressing what was in the back part of god's mind before the foundation of the world and he's allowed all of this and each one of it has been expressing himself that he's done all of this so that he can express himself so so when we see this picture amen the bible then becomes a new book i'm going to turn over here a couple paragraphs later and continue reading it says now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you'll see on what i believe what is being done so brother branham comes and he tells us uh the the mind that was in god has been unfolding itself right down to this hour so the bible has been the unfolding of god's mind it's been the plan that he had it's been the thought that he wanted to express the thing that he desired to achieve he's been unfolding it down through time amen and bringing it out amen and then in the end time he takes the veil off of it so he can express or he can explain what's been in the back part of his mind so that we can look back and see how perfect everything has been so now nothing's haphazard we understand that he said then it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you see on what i believe what is being done so brotherhood is telling us we need this revelation to see what's happened so we can see what's being done so we would understand our day and its message he said god's great mystery of house is secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible now you'll understand why he said i take from my text the entire bible because there's been a great secret in the back part of god's mind and that secret has to do with the coming of christ and and that's been unfolding itself all the way down to this time amen and he hasn't come out plainly and told it no he couldn't do that he must keep it in a mystery form amen but he's showed it in every type that's in the bible so brother branham now is preaching the entire bible but he's preaching this secret so i'd like to title this this morning if i can the mystery in plain sight the mystery in plain sight because it's been unfolding itself in the bible it's been typed in the bible it's been declared in the bible that's why when brother bam comes to the seven seals he's talking before he comes to the preaching of the seven seals and he's talking about the seals inside the book and the seals on the backside of the book and he says you know we can see the seals on the inside and he's talking about you know uh in revelation chapter six when you see the opening of the seals you see a white horse go forth and a red horse hey man he's showing that as the seals on the inside of the book but their seals on the backside are outside the book he said that never written in the bible at all because he's looking at the seven thunders and tying it to revelation chapter eight the seventh seal where there's silence in heaven and john was forbidden to write nothing written nothing spoken and brother bannon said it's not even written in the bible at all that's what he's saying in 1960 and 61 amen but by the time that he comes around to preaching the seals they mean he has a greater understanding and he's saying no it can't you can't add to it for this is the complete revelation of jesus christ so the seals have to be in here but god just didn't declare it amen he didn't allow john to write the seven thunders which was the revelation contained in the seven seals but he had him sealed it up but it still has to be in the bible so now brother branham comes to this great mystery of christ amen the seventh seal and he tells you there is silence in heaven nothing's written but it's written in every type that's in the bible so it's a mystery hiding in plain sight amen he goes on and he says he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it amen brother didn't say we're hoping he'll reveal it and we're hoping he'll show it but brother branham says here in the last day he has revealed it and shows it so god's great goal is so now i just say it this way basing off this statement brother branham makes in crisis the mystery of god revealed if we're still at the spot where we're wanting god to show us or reveal the seventh seal and show us and reveal the seven thunders he's telling us that he's already revealed it and shows it in the last day so if we're in that place where we're looking for something i would i would i would admonish all of us let's go back to the message amen let's go back to the bible because it's already been revealed it's already been shown it's in the message so let's not stay in the hoping he'll show something he's already revealed and he already shows it so let's go back to that message and say god you have to show me what you showed and you have to reveal to me what you revealed amen because i'm not looking for another messenger i'm not looking for a new message i'm not looking for the hidden message that didn't get on tape then we find in the archive somewhere the one that brother branham preached that explains it all and we've missed it for 50 some years no i'm not waiting for that he has already revealed and he already shows it so i need to go back and say god give me eye savvy man give me ears to hear lord you've already opened the seals you've already revealed it in the ministry amen of that seventh angel god help me to reveal to me what you revealed and show me what you've shown and if we can go with that attitude then you're going to see it keeps opening up and keeps opening up it's all there it's all there so so he goes on to say and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help will see it right here this morning that's why i carry this book everywhere i go christ is the mystery of god revealed brother ben said when i preach this i'm preaching the entire bible this is the mystery that god had in the back part of his mind he wants to reveal it i i take from my text the entire bible i'm going to preach to you christ is the mystery of god revealed he shows it in every time it's been revealed it's been shown what was in the back part of god's mind and with god's help this morning i hope you'll see it that's why i never leave home without this book and every time i get to sit down i keep going back to this book amen because brother branham tells us what he's going to tell us and i said god help me to see what you've been telling us and god's help we'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it was brother ben going to talk about this during this message what god has had in his mind all along and has expressed it that's the mystery the goal the plan the purpose the one thing that god wanted to achieve and brother ben's going to preach about it and christ is the mystery of god revealed i love it that's why i said in the beginning you can't start this message with the wrong mental picture or else you'll never get to what he's trying to express we'll see it in one portion of the manifestation when god was all wrapped up in one vessel in jesus christ in the 2000 years we'll see it there but we'll miss it before and we'll miss it after but we've got to see it through the whole thing now he says therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people and then you i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me so brother benham has already received the revelation he hasn't went in great detail yet to try to explain it but with god's help he was going to try to show it this morning praise be to god i think we can all read that book again listen to that tape now i'm going to read a few quotes and and and get into the what i desire to get into here but i want to uh set some background he said in trying to do god a service without it being god's will so now he reveals these things by his foreknowledge to those who he has ordained to these things otherwise they don't see it standing right there looking right at it and he can't see him now how many ever seen the picture of a cow in the bush that you just have to look and look and did you ever see that or seen the picture of christ in the bush or in the sky or clouds see that painter has got that so fixed up till you have to look at it just a certain way well then when you once see it you can't see nothing else but that this is going to become really important amen once you see it you can't see nothing else but that every time you look there it is how many seen those pictures well sure you have well that's the way christ is himself the gospel the message is when you once see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that amen so once you once you catch this revelation brother ben is talking about once you see the picture that he's talking about that's the only thing you can see amen you can't see nothing else so when we go back to read our bible this is why brother branham could say after preaching the seals my bible became a new book amen and we're talking about a prophet of god with prophetic insight on the word and he had prophetic insight on the word for his duration of his ministry amen there's things he preached in the 50s that he confirms in the opening of the seals so the man had prophetic insight on the word he knew his bible thoroughly amen some people you know brother man makes that comment he said you know somebody told him brother brahm you don't know your bible very well he said that may be true but i know the author real well well that's true he knew the author but brother branham knew this bible he knew this bible when brother branham is preaching he may not always be quoting a bible verse but he's always preaching the bible he knows this but he's he knows this bible he knows it better than grammar if i could say it that way i'm probably not saying that right but he knows it better than grammar he knows it better than english he knows it better than greek or latin he knows it better than that amen it wasn't it wasn't the jotted tittles and pen marks that he knew he knew the very nature life character of this word brother branham could read a story about a character in the bible and out of that he could clean and glean a concept about god and carry that concept from that story and start preaching it amen and it sounds like that maybe he's misquoting the scripture or may maybe he uh doesn't remember the details just right so he's adding no he has caught the very core of what that that character is showing us or what that circumstance in the bible is showing us and he's preaching us the core meaning of that story and then somebody will look at the prophet and say you know he got that detail wrong and that wasn't how many people and it really wasn't in that chapter in the bible and i'm saying my goodness what does it matter amen you can know the chapter the verse the jot and the title and have no idea what's expressing what god is expressing from his heart amen to his children and that is where brother bennum knew this bible like nobody i've ever seen know this bible he knew the heart of the bible the mind of the bible the character of the bible the life coming through the bible and everything he preaches preaches that life that character that nature so people want to stumble over mispronunciations and mislocations and and partial scriptures and don't stumble at all get to the heart of the matter what is god trying to say so once you see this message when you see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that that's all everything else is gone the rest of it's just a filler see when you once see this message when you once see this message i mean when you see it amen not see you know that we got 1200 and some tapes and churches here and there we had a prophet and he lived from this year and i'm talking about seeing the message that's not seeing the message that's looking at historical accounts and understanding facts but that is not knowing but once you see this message nothing else compares to it there's nothing else that'll touch it there's nothing else amen once you see this message could you ever go back to your former understanding i'll tell you what i i by the grace of god he opened our eyes 20 some years ago to the message of the hour i was raised all my life in a pentecostal church amen and i can say without a shadow of a doubt i would never never want to go back to where i was to the pentecostal church but where i was was the best i knew at the time but i would never want to go back but i'll tell you this god has continued to unfold himself i don't want to go back one year i don't want to go back to my previous understanding a year ago amen i don't want to go back to what i was five years ago amen once you see the message and keep seeing the message there's no desire to return back even to my own conception two or three years ago i said god i want to see more amen i want to keep moving deeper and further and higher in you i i there's no going back so we can say there's you know there's no going back to a previous age that's absolutely true but for me i don't want to go back to a previous understanding even if you say in the message when i was serving god with all my heart when i was believing the message with all that was in me to believe it and i saw all that i could see i still don't want to go back to that i want to keep moving forward he said now everything else is gone the rest of it's just filler see when you once see the message that was in noah's time we know in his group when they saw the message nothing else mattered when moses group saw it nothing else mattered when john's group saw it nothing else mattered when jesus group saw it nothing else mattered when the apostles group saw it nothing else mattered when luther's group saw it wesley's group saw it pentecostal groups saw it nothing else mattered they pulled away from everything amen can you say that once you saw this message nothing else mattered amen it wasn't uh i could say it express it from my own personal uh experience nobody took anything from me when i saw the message nobody took from us entertainment our tv the clothes we wore nobody took from us our revelation or understanding nobody took anything from me i dropped everything to grab a hold of this that's why if somebody feels like they've given up something from the message then my question is what revelation do you have of the message because if you have to give up something to come to the message then you don't really understand what the message is because the message is christ and there's only gain there's no loss so if we have to feel like we've given up or forsaken or lost something to come to the message then maybe we don't have a clear understanding yet of what the message is maybe to us it's just maybe a better form of understanding and to be in the better or correct form of understanding i've got to uh i've got to adhere to certain standards and certain things that the prophet taught so in adherence to a better or more perfect understanding i'm willing to give up this that's the wrong revelation that is the absolute wrong revelation and i think that's why sometimes people find themselves so frustrated i've talked to people who've been frustrated in the message and frustrated about rules and frustrated about standards and frustrated and i'm wondering why are they frustrating because i i cannot relate because it's not frustrating for me and that's that's not a statement of arrogance or pride it's an actual inability to relate so i've wondered and questioned why why is it frustrating why do you feel so cheated why do you feel so robbed why do you feel like you've missed out on something because for me i feel like paul said i gave it up and to me it was done it was all but done i realized it was worthless it wasn't helping me it didn't do anything for me amen but this message is my life amen it's my origin it expresses to me where i originated from where i'm going to amen there was zero loss amen when the prophet of god started saying something about you know conduct or dress or or television or entertainment for me i was like something inside said that's right now my face my flesh did not enjoy cutting off the tv but my soul was liberated amen your flesh may not enjoy putting down the cigarettes giving up the alcohol or dropping the entertainment but if you really catch this message your soul will fly say this is what i've wanted all my life amen praise be to god god is so good to us friends once you see this message brother bram says there's nothing else that you can see but that amen let's turn to matthew 11. matthew chapter 11 and verse 25 he says at this time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent has revealed them unto un them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight let's go over to luke chapter 8. luke chapter 8 verse 9. luke 8 9 and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand so jesus is saying father i thank you that you hid this from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed them unto babes what babes babes of the kingdom children of god and he tells the disciples i'm speaking in parables because they're not to see the mysteries are only for you so don't forget our title our title this morning is the uh i don't remember what title is let me know the mystery in plain sight the mystery in plain sight remember when brother branham preached god hiding and hidden and revealed in simplicity hiding himself in simplicity revealing himself the same he also hides himself in plain sight but only reveals it to the babes so everybody has the bible everybody who wants the bible has the bible anybody who wants to can read about the seals amen you can read in revelation chapter 6 amen but god must unlock the understanding god must give us eyes to see so he has to put it in plain sight but he must hide it because that's what he chose to do he chose to make it available amen and make it completely unavailable it's available anybody can pick up this bible and read and anybody can find the message you can find it on the internet you can find it from a friend you can get books for free tapes for free go on several different places online and listen to it for free or read it for free anybody can find this message and read it anybody can have a bible who wants to have a bible at least anybody in america and so you see that god made it available amen but he made it available but yet it's hidden because it takes a key to unlock what you're looking at because what you're looking at is in mystery form amen but yet he's been expressing this great mystery all the way through the bible so the bible is an expression of god's one great goal but nobody knows what that great goal is unless god has un given you a key in your heart of faith and that faith will now unlock the program of god and you go back and look at your bible and say it's a new book he says in the in the messy spiritual food and due season we find out that when a man comes sent from god ordained of god with the truth thus saith the lord the message and the messenger are one and the same because he is sent to represent thus saith the lord word by word so he in his message is the same amen amen a denominational man under denominational auspices he in the church is one a theologian under theology made by some denomination he and his message are one church of theology a theologian it's correctly then when a man comes with us saith the lord he in the message is one and when elijah come with us saith the lord he and his message become one just as jesus when he come he was the word saint john 1. so the word of god and the messenger of the age was the self-same thing all the time that's right this is good jesus was the word that was prophesied of he was what the prophet said would happen a virgin shall conceive and bears child way back in the beginning god told him said a woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head and he'll and he'll bruise her heel all these prophecies had been given david crying all the rest of the prophets down through the ages speaking of him he was the word manifested hallelujah now do you see where i'm trying to get to i spoke with you pretty plain this morning don't you see the authority of the living god in the living church the bride now he's talking about the authority of the living god and the living church the bride the sick are healed the dead are raised the cripples walk the blind seed the gospel goes forth and its power for the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person now the word the messenger and his message become the same so brother frank if you could help me turn on this uh the whiteboard he says in the feast of trumpets he said look i want to say one more thing closely now don't miss how striking from the seventh angel's message brother ben was talking about something else but he's injecting a statement i want to glean out of this he said from the seventh angel's message to revelation 10 was the seventh seal to the seventh trumpet between those times so he's trying to tell you that between the the the sixth trump and the seventh trumpet revelations 10 is inserted in there so he's trying to tell you that but he injects a thought that i want to catch he says don't miss it how striking from the seventh angel's message messenger of the seventh seal so brother branham the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh seal and in the messenger and his message become the same thing you catch that he's the messenger of the seventh seal and the messenger and his message become the same thing so he becomes a manifestation of the seventh seal which is what christ in you the hope of glory amen the coming of the son of man amen a son of man revealing the son of man he becomes his life becomes the word for that age his ministry becomes the ministry the he's the messenger of the seventh seal his life becomes a display of the seventh seal the son of man ministry has returned he says now in the questions and answers he says now in that day the prophet was the word for he was the manifestation of the word to the world he was the manifestation of the word to the world amen and then he says who do you say this is say there's a woman standing here i'm a young man waiting to get married she meets me specifically in every way she she's a lovely christian she looks like one she dresses like one she acts like one she lives like one i'll admit she'd make me a good wife but she isn't mine till i take her for mine that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you've got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message becomes one then the anointings with you as it as it is with others amen so we're gonna uh write something here so when in the first coming in the first coming you have a forerunner so that's john the baptist and the forerunner was a voice that went crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord make path and make his path straight he was preparing the people through repentance amen for the coming of the lord and so now in the he had the forerunner ministry he and his message became the same thing because he was the forerunner and he was the he was the message of forerunner he was showing for running and he was ministering repentance and preparing for forerunning but then the thing that he foreran came on the scene and that was jesus christ so you had won two vessels amen when brother eugene brown was here a couple years ago he first went through this with us and that's the first time i i saw this he did a little diagram up here if you remember but when we come over here to the second coming the coming of the son of man you had a forerunner which was elijah but the thing he foreran came in him son of man ministry so this caused some confusion because we're expecting this to be the same way and god always does the same thing but not necessarily the same way so he brought a forerunner an elijah again and and when he brought the forerunner he bought the forerunner and one vessel then he brought amen uh christ in another vessel and so now the forerunner and christ come together in the water and now the ministry moves to the son of man from the forerunner and and john now has to pass off of the scene that right so now when we come to the end of time we're looking for the coming of the son of man the son of man ministry to return on the earth amen and we notice that there's an elijah forerunner that has to come from malachi 4 and we see the forerunner coming so the forerunner comes amen and then then we have the opening of the seals we we have the the fullness of the word returning back into the church and then we have the forerunner amen beginning to say something like now now i if he's here i have to go off the scene two of us can't be here at the same time and so now we automatically start looking for another vessel because we're looking for a replication of the same thing but it's the same thing but not the same way now the very thing that that the ministry was forerunning amen he was here amen as a forerunner to turn the hearts back he was here for the opening of the seals in the opening of the seventh seal but but he becomes a display of the seventh seal the very life of jesus christ the very life that jesus christ lived on earth and galilee he was living through that man he would say i mean brother ben would stay on the platform he said you didn't touch me i'm just a man i'm 20 feet from you who did you touch you touched the lord jesus christ so christ was there amen he was present he was ministering the same way that he ministered 2 000 years ago so it was a sudden man revealing the son of man so now you can get can we can get confused if we look at and looking for a replica now there's a forerunner and brother branham tells us very clearly that he must come amen while the forerunners on earth is that true so like before he must come when the forerunners on earth and he said he said the seventh angel will be on earth at the time of this coming revelation 10. so now when we look at the previous okay we say well where did he go i mean where's he at he he's supposed to come now brother branham passes off the scene and now brother branham's when when god takes that vessel off of the scene now we're we're we're we're finding a question in people's hearts or there was in the past i thought amen he had to be on earth at the time of this coming maybe brother brennan made a mistake in the breach maybe he cleared it up later i don't understand what he's talking about because i didn't see a replica of what i saw 2 000 years ago but i'd say you saw the same thing amen you just didn't see it the same way and that's what causes confusion and he says now i must decrease and he must increase amendment and when john said that he could look to a physical person and he could say now this person his message is decreasing my mind's decreasing i'll go off the scene he continues on amen but now when we come to the end time the end time prophet amen the prophet becomes the word for that age and his message and the messenger become the same thing so now he's talking about the coming of the son of man the coming of the word amen the coming of the mighty angel amen in revelations 10 takes place and everything brother branham said in the breach is true so he comes but brother branham this ministry this time is a bride coming because the bridegroom already came the bridegroom was already expressed this coming was a bride coming of christ and so it said it could set in so much confusion unless we let the prophet be right and if we allow the prophet to be correct in what he says then all of a sudden you say amen brother that's right because now when christ is coming the son of man is coming he's coming in that form because brother branham is part of the bride also he's a forerunner but he's also a bride member brother branham brother branham was there to bridge a gap to take us from the denominational ages into the bright age so he himself was coming out of the denominational ages into the bright age he himself was bride he himself was resurrected out of dead denominationalism he himself amen was brought up by the revealing of the word he himself was part of the bride amen so the very ministry that he had the message he brought amen he and the message became the same thing so when you wanted to see the bright coming of christ you look at the forerunner who had received the fullness of the revelation and he was a member of the bride also amen let me keep going he says very familiar in the rising of the sun christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh waving of a sheaf what is the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheave hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again in full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there amen my question is did that happen amen the first thing that comes forth here's what he said the first time there will come forth for the bright age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message amen the message the message that he is here will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same sign and wonders so now that message and that messenger became the same thing now he's an expression of his message and his message is being caught called out of dead denomination and brought into a bride age the message is the bride coming of christ and now he becomes a reflection of that message praise be to god that's important all right let's keep going here so now i want to go back to this previous quote that i just read and who do you say this is from 1964. now he says he's talking about a woman that's there and he's saying that she couldn't make a good wife we just read this she meets every qualification every way she's lovely christian she looks like one she dresses like one acts like one she lives like one i'll admit she'd make me a good wife but she isn't mine till i take her for mine that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you've got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one so now you and the message brother branham and his message became one but now we in the message have to become one and we can't get this by sympathizing with the message or acknowledging that it's right or probably the better way to live but no we must take the message which is christ with our day and take it into ourselves get in it get under it get in and get it in us however fully surrender fully cement fully give ourselves to this word and embrace it with everything that's in us and then you and the message become one what is the message it's the opening of the seals it's the opening of the seventh seal it's a return of the fullness of the word and life of christ it is the bright coming of christ that's the message and when you take that message into yourself you and the message become one so you become the bride coming of christ it's not something we talk about see the brother men tell us message isn't something we come together to talk about something we get into we get under this isn't teaching this isn't doctrine you know we have doctrine because doctrine is teaching that's that's that's right we want doctrine there's nothing wrong with doctrine i love doctrine doctrine is our teaching on the word we have doctrine amen we we even have a an understanding of what's pleasing to god in the way we fashion ourselves and the way we conduct ourselves so we have order we have structure we have church order we have all of that in the message but all of that is not the message we it's included because you can't have the word without having doctrine you can't have the word without having order you can't have the word without having somebody that obeyed the word and submit to it all of that is part of it but if we have obedience and doctrine and understanding and all of these things that's still not the same as having the message amen because the message is a person amen the message is the person of jesus christ and it's time for him to manifest on this earth in a mini-membered bride that is the message of the hour the bride coming of christ it is not something we talk about it's something we are you can't talk about the message and be in the message the message must be in you and you and the message must become the same thing that's the message so the message is not comparing dates and times brother branham lived this time and he preached these series these series of messages he did these miracles that's that's yet not what god wants in this hour god wants a people and himself the word to become the self same thing so that we become the message so you can say what is the message and you can say by the grace of god i am the message remember brother bam told us that all time when somebody went looking for the welsh revival where's the wealth revival and they were looking for the location of the wealth revival and then you know they went to a policeman and he said i am the welsh revival remember reverend said you've arrived you're here because the revival's in me where do i find the message the messages of people on this earth that have the very life of jesus christ the mind of god has been open to them the mystery has been taken off of the word it's implanted into the hearts of the people and now they're becoming one with it and the thing that they're seeing they're starting to reflect they're starting to live the very thing that they're looking at amen and that is the message friends that's why if we if we stop with some correct teaching and a good church structure amen and get everybody looking right and dressing right and we stop and we set up camp there i'm telling you we're gonna very very quickly find ourselves outside the message we may not even be contradicting what brother branham taught or contradicting his order or saying that he's wrong amen but not moving in with the life of christ as christ is revealing himself and we're not moving and ebbing and flowing with the revelation of the hour we're going to find ourselves stuck back here in an order a structure a form amen and not moving with christ as he wants to display himself in this end time amen that's why i don't want to go back to a former understanding because as god reveals himself more amen i find within me a greater love and a greater desire for him a greater obedience and a greater surrender amen and it didn't come from a stronger willpower amen it come from a greater revelation so as he unvoted himself to me i find in me amen uh just a natural surrender as he reveals himself to me so so we don't want oh i say we don't want structure we do want structure we do want order we do want form we want the doctrine we want we want the standards we want all of it but what god really wanted was to live in a people and fullness on this earth and express the entire mystery through her that's really what he wants in this hour that's why we can give we can give fervent obedience and still have missed the mind of god we can give fervent effort to be in church every time the doors are open pray and read my bible every day but we could still miss the whole purpose and whole plan of god but being fervent in our religious efforts so that's not what we want we want you you've got to well brother brahm's saying you've got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then this is the part that's exciting then the anointings with you as it is with others see you we've heard so many people say sometimes i believe the message i just can't live it you ever heard that well i agree with you one thousand percent i believe the message and i can't live it so i quit trying to live it and i just embraced it amen and when i embraced it and received it he lived it through me amen it wasn't anymore me living it now that doesn't mean we never have a choice to make we never have a decision to make we never sacrificed that that's not i'm not saying we still have our own choices to make but really my choice is my feeble effort to make choices would never get me to the destination i would always find myself frustrated trying to live the message saying i believe the message but i can't live the message well really you believe about the message but you not yet met the person of the message because if you meet the person of the message and embrace that person that person will enter into you and live the message out of you that's what brother ben was saying you become you take it to yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointings with you as it is with the others because you can't do anything without an anointing and if you're trying to use your own human mind and effort you're gonna find yourself failed failed failed failed failed frustrated ready to quit ready to give up knowing that the message is true but i must be serpency i would never in million years confess such a thing no matter whatever passes through your mind never let a statement like that come out of your mouth but you say i believe by the grace of god i'm one of his and i just want to throw my whole self into this word i want to receive it with everything that's in me amen and we've got to stop reading the message looking for rules and start reading the message looking for him [Music] because the message can be used falsely as a safety net and it's a wrong concept that because i know the message is true and if i do all i can to do it brother branham said i'll be okay and so we're we're not and that's where this frustration trying to live the message and and always living in compromise always trying to find out where the gray area is and what's okay and what's not okay i mean sometimes you talk to people and they're always trying to get something to fit some habit some lifestyle something they enjoy doing whatever it is you find you find somebody's always trying to find justification in the message for it no i said well brother branham said this and brother brahm said that and i want my justification listen i think we should always study the message and we should always find the mind of christ through the word of god and through the message of the hour and when brother ben explains something we should take he did that and let that influence our lives but you can come to that with the wrong concept and try to use the message as a safety net to say if i can find an allowance in the quotes if i can find a place where i can still do this have this and then enjoy this and still be in the message then i am in the safety net in the message and i'll be okay listen that is zero personal relationship with jesus christ that is nothing more than using the message as a form of religion to find a path to heaven and it's the wrong concept now listen the truth is a razor's edge because i believe that god shared his mind through that prophet and what he said is subject to be lived by so don't get me wrong i'm not rejecting anything that he said i'm telling you you can accept what he said and use it the wrong way for the wrong kind of justification and still not be seeking the person of the word i want to ask you what did god want did god want a correct church that had all the doctrine right and could all sit in nice little rows and look right or did he want a wife someone to know him to love him to have communion with him so we can't use the message as a structure to find acceptance with god we use the message to find god it's the word expressing himself to us it's a love letter to us for that we would know him we're not here to find a structure we're here to find the person and to embrace the person and become one with the person and then the message you and the message become one then the anointings with you as it was with others amen let's keep going in god's power to transform that word has come to pass it's god's word plan it in your heart if you want to go in a rapture if you want to be a christian genuine place this word as i believe it was ezekiel god said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet in the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's god's original seed so brother ben was telling us he's going back to ezekiel where he was told to take the scroll and eat the scroll and he's saying he told that's the word and symbolized the word eat the word to become one with the word so that you and the word become the same thing so you see ezekiel wasn't told to read the scroll he was told to eat the squirrel i'd say it this way i i i got to be careful how i say this i'm not encouraging you to read the message i want you to eat the message i'm not encouraging you to read your bible i want you to feed on your bible amen i want you to take it inside amen take it i mean let's take our the word of god and take it inside to us and become one with it and embrace it and love it and give everything to it and receive it in its fullness we're gonna i want to stop oh if somebody would take one little clip of what i said i'm gonna be in a big trouble no longer do i want to read the message i want to feed on christ i want to eat the book i want to become one with it i want to get all of my nutrients all of my vitamins everything i need for spiritual survival i want to become the contents of that book i want the contents of the book to be in me and i want to live i want it to live outside out of me amen amen let's go to revelation chapter 10 and read this in our day i i changed something in a prayer of mine a couple years ago as god was opening the word so much to me because i had been in the message for many years and loved the word loved everything about it loved every tape i listened to every book i read loved my bible loved the church loved everything but as god was quickly beginning to open the word to me i started seeing it was just a love affair there was such joy in my heart amen and that's why brother branham said that the wine that they that they get drunk on is the stimulation of revelation it is exciting it is thrilling when christ opens himself to us and i begin to enjoy that so much amen that communion with the lord as he revealed himself to me and and as i was becoming one with him and i stopped reading my bible to understand something and i started reading my bible to understand someone and when i would pick up my bible i said lord would you reveal yourself to me in this bible and that was a simple prayer but it was profound for me because my attitude was changing i wasn't reading any form or to have the correct information and that's how i used to read the bible not because i was bad i wanted the correct information and you read the bible you'll get the correct information there's nothing wrong with that my main motivation was to get the correct information so that i would know the truth but god gave us his word not so that we would sit in the millennium over against the tree and hold our bible and read this word but so that we would become one with him and know him and have a relationship with him and become his bride in the millennium so i love my bible because my bible is expressing him and i'm reading my bible to understand him i'm reading my bible to come into a greater unity with him but it's all about a unity with him that's why you have some people we can be guilty of this both ways we can become so intellectual we miss the personal relationship and just get the information and we can become so spiritual we just want to write a relationship but no information so we have we what we have then under that when we re leave the word out of our relationship no message no revelation no bible we just say i just love him i just want to know him i don't need to know all that information i just want him well you got to be careful because if you leave out the revelation of the word and just try to embrace him that you're going to find that you have a crush on somebody that you're not even in a relationship with you're infatuated with somebody amen that you're not even in a relationship with because he is the person of the word you cannot leave out the word and have the person so we must bring this together amen where we get the revelation of the word because that revelation is unveiling him and then we embrace the one who's been unveiled to us and it becomes a relationship a oneness a unity then we take the word into ourselves and become the manifestation of the message revelations 10 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings now we know john here in the vision he's told to go and take the book and that book was the open book amen where the seals had been opened that the mighty angel had brought down and he goes and he takes the book which is the revelation of jesus christ the revelation of the mind of god the book of redemption the open bible all of those things and he's told to take it and eat it up and then he's told once again the instruction was not to read it but to eat it i said god help us to feast on this word but then they're supposed to prophesy again so then after they eat it there's still a message that goes out and when you eat it amen now your message and the messenger become the same because now what are we prophesying again what does the bride when she eats this book prophesy again she prophesies the contents of the book not anything new what she's received but now what she received is in her she's sharing who she is she's resharing what's going on inside of her she's sharing the message but she is the message sharing the message just like brother branham was the message sharing the message amen praise god brother brahman said in the crisis the mystery god revealed he said that's it christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her part of him and that's the word again amen and again in christ as the mystery god revealed it says he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then express himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them it's a surrender to the word it's a submission to the word the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them i want to turn to luke let's turn to luke chapter 1. and let's start at verse 34. luke chapter 1 and verse 34. then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of and behold thy cousin elizabeth shall she also she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her now mary became the word by letting the word flow through her is that right mary was predestinated before the foundation of the world to be the vessel that god would bring the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall conceive she was predestinated to be that fulfillment but she had to receive the message and so one day she was walking along and an angel of the lord came to bring her the message and that message was not information that message was her place in the in the plan of god so when that angel brought the message to mary the angel was positioning mary in the redemption plan the redemptive plan of god and i'd like to say this the messenger that came in this day did not come to bring us information about somebody else and something else and somewhere else he came to position you the virgin bride of jesus christ in the plan of redemption and so now this angel comes to her amen not to tell her hey across town guess what a virgin's gonna conceive it's time for the promise fulfillment the message came to her to tell her you're the location you're the location of the fulfillment of the prophecy for this hour it'll be in you you're the chosen one you're highly favored god has chosen you and now from you is going to come the word so she is part of the word within her is the word because she was in the thought of god before the foundation of the world but now she has to come in contact with the message and the messages to unlock her and she has questions of course natural questions how will this be i know not a man and and and the angel said the holy ghost will overshadow you the thing that's formed in you amen she says be it unto me according to your word not uh not could i have a textbook on this could i have time to think about it what actions do i need to take what should i do should i just amen be it unto me according to your word i will be that vessel i believe the message i believe what you're telling me listen you you have to understand if we could just put ourselves back into a 15 or 16 year old girl's body in nazareth who's nobody from nowhere amen and she's engaged to a man to be married who's a bit of an older man amen and she's got all this going on in her life and she's just going to the well to fetch water like she always does and here comes a messenger from god to tell her that this is the time and the hour and the season for the manifestation of the word the coming of the lord is now and it's going to start in you and she goes how and he gives an explanation that doesn't explain and she says be it unto me according to your word this is such a simple statement be it unto me according to your word but it's not simple friends by saying that she's acknowledging that i believe you that i was in the back part of god's mind when he was having isaiah give a prophecy he was thinking of me that being unto me was loaded with meaning friends she was receiving the revelation of her hour and she was receiving the revelation of herself in that hour she was receiving the revelation of her position in god in that hour and when she said being unto me she was saying i believe what you tell me that i believe that i'm the virgin that isaiah spoke of that god thought of before the foundation of the world when there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that you were going to bring it through a virgin because you knew there was going to be a fall you see this being unto me is loaded with meaning she had to accept it she had to receive it and then she let she let that word flow through her she could not produce it she could not manufacture it she could not copy it what could she do there was nothing she could do well what have we heard in this hour there's been a messenger there's been a seventh angel messenger that come and give us a revelation of the word to be performed in this hour but that messenger was unlocking the mystery in us and placing us in that mystery placing us as the vessels the word would come through amen and you can we can look at this and you can see the wave sheath and say there's no way i can do that i can tell you god's not asking you to do that god's not asking you to do anything amen that's what sometimes becomes so discouraging people they they look at brother branham's life and they look at the maturity he came to and the character he had and the manifestation say i could never do that i i would venture to say he never did that that's what he told us he said i'm not the one who does this i'm not the one who did this i was only standing by when he did those things he wasn't looking for somebody who could perform to the task mary never could perform to the task he's looking for somebody who will say i believe that's the truth and i yield myself to that truth and be it unto me according to your words now can we listen to the prophet and calling out a bride and listen we can look at the prophet calling out a bride as a story we can look at it as a mark in time that he's calling on a bride but we need to take the message personally he's calling me bride that messenger come to me and he's saying you're the bride you're the place of the fulfillment of the word it's time for the bride coming of christ and he wants to come inside of you and you can say but i can never but i this and i've got this happen and i'm this and mary could do the same thing americans say but i'm from a poor family i'm from out of the way i'm already engaged to a man i i've got this circumstance i've got that circumstance nobody will believe me listen at that point none of that matters because there's a prophecy amen there's something in the mind of god that'll trump every circumstance and bring the past the word of god so now none of her circumstances mattered anymore all that mattered was what the angel told her was the truth and when she received it and yielded herself to it then the holy ghost came and brought to pass everything that was in the mind of god before the foundation of the world so when we look at the life of brother brahma say i could never i can never i'm telling you that you can be whatever god has already designed for you to be what he's looking for is not effort he's looking for a surrender he's looking for somebody who will let the word flow through them and say god i give myself to this word i give my mind i give my life i give my body i give everything just let it flow through me praise me to god i'm wanting to get to something we may have to finish it up on wednesday but i got something in my heart we'll touch on it today lord willing let's turn let's turn to luke 24 together luke 24 and verse 25. is after the resurrection this is the road to emmaus when i read in christ is the mystery of god revealed what i stopped reading there which is the first just the first couple pages right at the beginning of brother venom's ministry at after his greetings and after all of that he goes into uh prayer he reads the scriptures then we read what we read and immediately after we read what he read he goes into the road to email story jesus stepping out from the bushes and talking to the disciples asking them why they're so grieved as they walk along the way so brother branham and christ the mystery of god he's telling us that there's one mystery the whole the whole bible's been expressing one mystery and every type has been expressing it and here today i'm hoping you'll see it and then he goes right into the road to email story so i just want to grab a couple verses out of this let's look at verse 24. and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher they're explaining to jesus what had been happening went to the sepulchre and found even as the women had said but him they saw none then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself so here in the resurrection they're confused about what's happening they're discouraged because christ has died they're walking down to emmaus and he steps out of the bushes and he begins to to ask them questions and they begin to express their trouble and he calls them fools and slow of heart to understand and he and he says he starts to go through the scriptures and he goes down brother bam said they had a six hour bible study on fulfilled prophecy for the journey begins to go down through the scriptures and he begins to pull out of the scriptures amen the scriptures concerning himself amen what was he doing he was showing the mystery in plain sight he goes to moses and no doubt to know on to david and he and he goes to the psalms and brother bam starts talking about some of the scriptures he no doubt went to and began to explain and he begins to pull out of the scriptures and starts to show to them that there's been a mystery in this death there's been a mystery amen in this coming amen and the mystery has been laying in plain sight amen but now amen i'm going to unveil to you the mystery so you can look back in your bible and you can see it was there it was there it was there it was there and we know that this happens because peter and paul and john and james they're from then on amen after pentecost they're able to go back and say this is what the prophecy said and this is what the prophet said over here because when he unveiled the mystery and then he shows that this has all been in the bible and then all you had to do back is look at what's in plain sight it's been laying there for everyone to read but until he unlocks the by revelation the mystery to you you can't see what you're reading and here's what brother bram says in christ's mystery god revealed he says now if you want to mark this down i've got so many places i want to read from and in the book of saint luke the 24th chapter of saint luke we find it's it's the two apostles on the road to emmaus and jesus stepping out after his resurrection and they were on their road over to emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of his death and how they seen him suffer to what they thought was of no value at all they took their lord and crucified him and they were going along their weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and began to talk to them about christ he said o fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets in the psalm see what was he doing identifying himself to those apostles that all of the prophets and all of the psalms and everything was him expressed so now they get a six-hour bible study on fulfilled prophecy back to christ as the mystery god revealed the prophet says now notice now down through the ages he has been gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the times now we can just go on to that and expressing himself amen now in the message the identified masterpiece of god says now we notice that god began to make a bride for christ and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it is part of him and the brightest part of him she is part of him the word for that day the bride becomes part of that word for it's christ now you believe that we have to be in christ in christ we have to be of christ in christ part of christ so i want to go back and just just share something that i've been looking at amen and this morning things were coming so fast i just got a piece of paper started jotting it down so i'm just going to have to write some things out so let me see here all right i'm going to go back to this drawing that i've been drawing in this timeline so i'm not a good artist so when i get stuck on something i just kind of stick with it so you have to forgive me but we on this timeline we were drawing this this timeline of redemption and we talked about what was in the mind of god and how it come down into time and been expressed all the way through it was in fullness here and then it began to express it in bright form over here all the way till we get to the fullness again all right but it's fullness and bright form so here we have it bridegroom form and here we have it in bride form because he first formed adam and then he took out of adam what he needed to make the woman and so i want to go back and i'm just reminding you of that image there i want to go back and just draw if i can i just want to look at the old testament for a minute so i'm just going to come down here and draw the old testament part of this now when jesus was on the road to emmaus was those two disciples he was there in his resurrection and and in the resurrection ministry we know that he begins to reveal the mystery of what had just happened to them so you see part of jesus's resurrection ministry is to go back to the scriptures and reveal their day modern events made clear by prophecy so that's part of the resurrection ministry and so now today well brother ben on the road to him or he talks about the road to emmaus how he begins to go into the life of david and how he's a rejected king and to the psalms where he was crying out my god my god why is that forsaken me and to the songs where they said they parted my garments and he starts to show it's all been fulfilled amen it was laying in a mystery you missed it but with the key of faith and with revelation we can look back and see it there there there and there but now we've come to the end time where god has unlocked another layer of the mystery because in that day he unlocked the mystery of jesus christ amen gone amen in the form of flesh as his son coming to pay the price of redemption and he shows that all the old testament was speaking of that all the way to there amen then when brother branham comes and starts showing us that the bride was always in him the bride was a part of that mystery amen when adam came forth he was a revelation of the thought of god that when adam was made and formed on the earth he was a revelation of the thought of god but there was a further revelation of the father of god that was with him and then it was expressed out amen and it was expressed out into a form and united back together with him it was a further expression of the mind of god and it was a further expression of what was with adam all along and so i want to go back and let's look back at the old testament i just want to grab a few stories here and i want to show that this bride this manifestation of the female has been all through the bible so if christ has been there we know that christ is going to be expressed male and female so there's no time that we're not going to go into this in depth i'm just going to take a few points and i'm going to show here that we have here an expression of adam right but there wasn't just an expression of adam we know that there was also with adam an expression of wife and she was mrs adam so even from the very beginning when god is going to start showing a son of god amen and this son of god will fall showing that we need to have another son of god that won't fall but even in that expression there's a female expression that goes with it so when you see the male the female's there now we're going to start to see this pattern all through the bible because we come down here to the end time when we come to the revelation of the message brother banham starts to express some things that that that the the church has lost they've lost the fact that christ is going to have a bride the denominations had a lot it's it was all about christ it was all about jesus christ and he paid the price in the lamb of god but they missed scriptures in the new testament that was talking about the bride the lamb's wife the marriage of the lamb there was all of these things that were there but but i ask you which of the denominations are preaching about the bride now i'm not saying none there might be some who mention it there might be some who talk about it but all of my life growing up in churches nobody was talking about the bride amen because it takes somebody to come on the scene in the resurrection ministry and say oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the bible had written and he goes brother bam says this seventh seal was expressed all the way back in the beginning in the book of genesis so when when brother branham comes and he starts preaching of a bride age in the invisible union of the bride in christ an expression of christ in bright form the bright coming of christ he's not just talking about something that's happening then you can look all the way down through the bible and see that you had this male and female all the way through i'm just going to take a couple of these so when you have adam then you have the woman she later gets the name of eve but god's plan has to march on she falls by deception and produces a cane and so she produces a cane and an abel cain kills abel and god cuts off cain but the plan of god has to continue so how's the plan of god going to continue from adam and eve now will come the next expression god will use seth how was god going to get the seth without the woman the woman brought the fall produced the cane cain killed abel but the plan of god has got to continue on so god hey listen god is foreshadowing all the way back in the old testament that he's going to have to use this fallen woman and this fallen woman is still going to be instrumental in redemption so even though the woman fell and there's a fallen woman and this fallen woman is still with a vessel because there's a woman typed with the man they're still male and female in the expression of christ and although the woman has fallen god is still going to bring through the woman and keep that keep the redemption cycle moving forward so now there comes a set and seth comes from eve and adam from seth he has enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord so you can see that god is still moving his program along amen but when the woman dropped out of grace he didn't cut her off and say no i'm going to do it without a woman he can't do without a woman because all the way at the end time he's going to be doing it with a woman so he's got to have the woman intact through the whole bible so now if i could say this without you thinking i'm sacrilegious but now as we walk down through the road of emmaus it's no longer just showing us the bridegroom the bridegroom the bridegroom but now you can go back and say you see the bride here with the bridegroom you see the bride here with the bridegroom do you see esther amen what is esther pointing to so now amen under the the resurrection ministry of christ in our day amen through a prophetic message he has brought us back to the understanding that god had this plan from all the way in the beginning and every type was showing the mystery of christ but the mystery of christ was not male only the mystery of christ was going to be expressed in male and female just like the first son so then we come down here and now we have another expression in moses uh no before moses i'm gonna do something else oh i messed my line up i'm such a nervous artist now we come to abraham we've been talking about abraham a lot so i'm not going to spend a lot of time i'm just going to touch on it but with abraham there's another expression with abraham that's sarah his wife because god says god says you're going to have a son and he's going to come from your own bowels right he said it's not going to be eliezer but you have a son from your own bowels coming from your own body and so sarah and abraham come up with a plan to take hagar after god says that and he produces a son that son technically comes from his own bowels but yet that's not the fulfillment of the prophecy he says no in sarah shall thy thy isaac shall come from sarah because sarah is part of abraham so when it says shall come from your own bowels abraham and another woman won't work amen because it's got to be abraham male and female and when you get the abraham male and female together in god's timing then you can produce the promised son so it's not just a from abraham's body it must come from abraham and sarah's body because sarah is part of abraham are you enjoying the road to emmaus now we can look back and see now and sarah isaac will come from sarah amen and and i don't have time to go into all the scriptures but you can look them up sarah now she comes uh to the seventh seal god comes to her privately and he comes to her in the appointed time and she receives strength and she conceives and now she brings forth the promised son she's turned young but after she's turned young then she has a visitation amen from the lord the lord visits sarah and she received strength to conceive so even when she was turned back young she still wasn't conceiving the lord had to visit her amen and a private little room behind closed doors no public show meeting with god and sarah and when he did now she was able to bring forth the promised sign and she conceives but after that she has a clear vision and after that when it's time for them to wean isaac and during the party where isaac being winged she sees the son of the bondwoman mocking and she comes to abraham and she says that cast out the bondwoman and her son for the bondwoman shall not be heir with my seed you said well that was pretty bold i mean the bible says that we're supposed the women are supposed to be like sarah who call abraham lord but boy she's really telling him what to do it's because now she has clear understanding when she produced hagar she didn't have clear understanding and then she partially understood the promise she partially understood the word and she with her own effort tried to make the word come to pass but now after her visitation from the lord she has a clear understanding and she says cast out the bondwoman and her son for the child of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my child he said wow that's pretty stiff abraham begins to grieve and god tells abraham don't grieve over what sarah said but listen to her she's right and then the apostle paul picks this up in the new testament and the apostle paul says does not the scripture say cast out the bondwoman does not the scripture say cast out the bondwoman and her child hey i thought all the scripture came of holy men of old anointed by the holy ghost but here's a scripture that came from a woman who had a revelation of the promisee according god told abraham she's right and paul picks it up and says does not the scripture say god was speaking his word through sarah after she had come in contact with god and god had visited her and she had an understanding of what this was and what is this foreshadowing which showing amen that at the end time amen the word will be in the bride because you'll eat the book and prophesy again and brother baby said she'll be the mouthpiece of god on earth for the word will be in her all the way back in the old testament male female male female moses when it came time to bring moses god for one he needed a woman he brought through i believe his jock of bed was his mother's name brought moses on the scene but at the time moses came on the scene there was a destruction of children and so daca bed hid moses for a little while and when she could hide it no longer she fashioned an ark out of bulrushes and she put him in the bulrushes so now in order for god to move forward his redemption plan he must save the life of moses but to save the life of moses he's going to need a woman this woman is going to make the ark that's going to hold the word and she's going to send it into the bulrushes amen but then moses sister miriam is going to follow along and watch what happens to the ark another woman amen and then god is going to allow pharaoh's daughter to find the ark another woman listen there's no men involved this is all women amen it's his mother it's his sister amen's pharaoh's daughter and pharaoh's daughter takes him and adopts him as her own and brings him into pharaoh's house and what is god doing god is moving the plan of redemption along and i i would like to say it this way when you go back and you begin to look at the expressions of christ it was brother said it was christ and moses it was christ and david it was christ here it was christ there when you go back and you find christ many times you'll find a woman instrumental in moving forward the redemption plan that if you take the women out of the story the plan of god cuts off why because he was showing that there's got to be a bride all the way back there she's part of redemption she's moving redemption along god is still working through male and female the old testament is the expression of christ he came as the fulfillment of that amen as the bridegroom the new testament is building him a bride but the whole bible is an expression of christ and wherever you find christ his bride is there too and that's why brother ben said now my bible became a new book our bible is constantly becoming a new book because when we look at it again we see that's christ that's the bride that's what this is redemption now little miriam follows the basket alone sees pharaoh daughter and pharaoh's daughter has a servant pick it up she says this is one of the hebrews miriam runs up and says hey do you want me to fetch a nursemaid to nurse him she said sure gets her mother the mother of the baby says i'll pay you i'll pay you to nurse your baby it's the redemption plan of god and you cannot see the redemption plan of god moving forward without a woman involved because the bride is part of christ she's part of the word she's part of the plan of redemption he's taken the mystery off the entire bible now we come into the exodus come to joshua see you look down through all of these stories and as you look through them at first at first bible reading you see christ typed in male male male male moses joshua david solomon we got that but when you go back and you read it again you find that when it was time for joshua to enter into the land there was a stronghold there called jericho and when josh was moving into his ministry in the exodus and joshua's the type of the holy ghost and he's bringing the people across to conquer the land the first thing they're going to conquer is that great denomination of jericho amen and it's got high walls around it but there's a little prostitute woman down in jericho by the name of rahab and rahab is going to become instrumental into redemption in that city so we think the story is just about joshua but when we're looking at joshua rahab pops up what's rehab doing there and then raham takes the two spies that come in to look at the land amen and then the spies were uh they were after the spies they were subject uh they were in danger of being captured and men in their mission to be exposed and so she takes them and hides them and she declares i don't have time to go into scriptures today but we might sometime soon she declares i know that god has given you this land what is this this is a harlot in the middle of the denominational system in jericho and she says i know i believe the message with all of my heart stuck in a lifestyle that is contrary to what we would call righteousness i mean she's in a bad spot in a bad place but there's something on the inside of her that when she heard of what god had done in the red sea and she heard of how he destroyed the armies she said that's the truth god has given them this land she hid the messengers protected the protected them amen but then she asked them she said listen before you go give me a true token give me a true token and they tell her you know if you keep the secret and and all that and just set the scarlett threat outside of your window and get all your family under this token and when you get all your family we'll not destroy anything that's in this house but we're not responsible for anything outside the token and here you have a harlot woman in jericho believes the message receives the preachers protects them and she opens a door of redemption the only door of redemption in jericho in the accursed city in the place that's about to be destroyed in the very thing that joshua's coming to level amen there's a harlot on the inside who believes the message and acts accordingly who is opening the only door of redemption in that cursed city praise god amen we've been fools and slow of heart to believe all that god had written through the prophets and all that he read through the laws because he's always placed the woman instrumental in redemption all the way through so now they take jericho rahab comes out her and her family are saved and then she marries salmon of judah and she becomes the mother of boaz listen friends tell me the bride's not in the old testament the bride's in the old testament amen where christ is she is amen there's male and female all the way through then a little while later we come into the time of the judges and in the time of the judges we know that there's a famine there's a family that leaves and goes to moab the sons married daughters amen and they come back and naomi comes back with uh with who does she come back with ruth thank you guys too many names she comes back with ruth ruth of moabites amen she's a gentile i mean just look back at the bible amen when joseph was a perfect type of jesus christ what kind of wife did he have gentile wife moses had a gentile wife right you're starting to see this pattern all through the bible god has been declaring his great mystery in every time every type in the bible has been declaring it he's been slowly letting it out but at the end time he takes the veil off so you can go back and say that's why joseph had to have a gentile wife that's why moses had to marry a gentile this makes perfect sense because he's taken the veil off of redemption and it's christ male and female so now we come now we come into boaz and boaz is going to be a picture of the kinsman redeemer and he's going to paint the picture for us of how christ will redeem it all the way through to revelation chapter 5. so he's another type of christ but he's an e from all accounts he's an older man from the way the scripture is written and there's a there's a a woman by the name of naomi and their relatives naomi she loses everything goes into the moab and they lose everything there she comes back and lost her husband lost her sons lost her inheritance she needs redemption real bad amen but how is this woman going to get redemption boaz is able to redeem her amen but god is going to use a mechanism so it is not only the male but it's going to be the female because now ruth is going to be instrumental to rayomi's redemption now this woman from moab moab the moabitess woman the gentile bride is coming on the scene and through humility and service and she's going to serve naomi she's going to glean in the fields she's going to get the attention of boaz and boaz is now going to redeem naomi and take ruth and when he takes ruth she's going to bring forth a promised son that is obed obed's the father of jesse jesse's the father of david how did they come about because rahab the harlot opened the door of redemption and jericho married salman because she was a believer in the midst of the denominational system married the prince had boaz boaz takes ruth the moabitess woman for the purpose of redemption brings forth obed obed reforms jesse jesse before brings forth david the bible's too perfect too beautiful friends for us to miss it anymore i say god take the scales off of our eyes and see what's been hiding in plain sight in plain sight there's been a woman all the way through in redemption it wasn't the male only but you used a woman you used a woman here and you lose a woman there and you use the woman there and then this day amen it's the bride coming of christ you're finishing the plan of redemption and you're using a female expression of christ how can i have such confidence in that i can see it strung clear through the bible amen i have confidence that that's what god is wanting to do we're on the road to emmaus we find one here running out of room but you find esther and esther opens a door of salvation for an entire people a nation of israel and without her amen she's in place for salvation she's instrumental to the salvation of the jews i'm going to go down here and add another one i'm going to add debra deborah was a judge and a prophetess she was the fourth judge in the fourth chapter i think god wants us to see the number four because the fourth stage of the seed is back to life again and the fourth beast is the eagle and the eagle is the prophetic anointing and she's from the tribe of ephraim the ephraim is a type of the gentiles because when god crossed when he crossed jacob's hands israel's hands amen the blessing went crossed from manasseh to ephraim showing that the blessing's gonna cross from the jews to the gentiles so here comes a woman who's a prophetess a woman who's a judge and she's the fourth judge in the fourth chapter from because the number four is the fourth beast which is also the eagle the prophetic the prophetic gift and she's from the tribe of ephraim which represents gentiles i wonder what she's doing there i wonder why god put her in the bible maybe maybe like brother brother shimbo was saying god was using david he was leaving a signal he says here's the signal remember when brother shimbo said that he was signaling the combination of judah and levite back into one again and here god in this debra is leaving a signal i've told you all before i used to when i used to uh talk i used to debate it wasn't right but i did debate i had the right word i used to debate with denominational people about women preachers and they would always go to deborah and i would say why did god if god hadn't put that in the bible my debate would have lasted a little longer but then god opened our eyes to see why it's laying there and all of a sudden you say i'm so thankful he put deborah in the bible so that i can see in the end time amen under a prophetic ministry god is going to have a woman on the earth amen at ephraim in the fourth stage of the beast amen and when it comes back to life amen and the word is going to be in her amen the word that the prophet brought is going to be in the bride she's going to be told to prophesy again so now all of these things are laying in the bible you know in the time of judges in the time of deborah i'm running out of time so i'm just going to give a couple more and then we'll we'll close for today but in the time of deborah amen there's a battle that's taking place the canaanites are ruling and dominating over the israelites and she tells barack to go and defeat them and barack wants her to come and then she tells him but there's going to be credit given to a woman for this victory amen and under the time of deborah the prophetess the judge the fourth amen there's a there's a captain of the host of the the the conquering army his name's cesara and cesara is giving them all kinds of trouble and barack is trying to sort them and save the the israelite nation and sasera begins to run away when he runs away he runs to a woman's tent and this woman invites him in and she comes into the woman's tent and he asks for water she gives him milk and and she tells him to lie down back here and she covers him over and he says protect me and she says i'll protect you and when he falls asleep she takes a tent stake this big this big may be this big she walks over to him and lays it on his temple and drives the tent stake through his head through his temple and pins it to the ground amen the enemy comes into the woman's tent and where does she attack the enemy where does she defeat the enemy in the mind because the battle started in the mine the serpent came to eve and troubled her in her mind and now we have a victory under the ministry of deborah and under the ministry of deborah the final victory that's going to give them victory over all the foes is when this woman takes this tent stake and drives it through the very thinking the very mind of this enemy and pins it to the ground as earthly carnal thinking and she won't be defeated by this enemy anymore why is that in the bible i don't know maybe to encourage you and i there's another story in in judges chapter nine in judges chapter dying it's it's a hemolac or abimalac a son of gideon gideon was a judge over israel he has a son with a concubine so it's not a legitimate son it's an illegitimate son and this is a little illegitimate son amen comes up with a scheme so he can become the next judge of israel and through this political maneuvering and scheme he becomes the false judge and this false judge begins to terrorize and begins to control and then there's a war that breaks out and there's a fight and he defeats one city and he goes to the next when he goes to the next all the people run up into a tower because we have a tower to run into which is christ all the people run into the tower when the when the false judge is coming along the the hybrid one he's coming in and he begins to attack and he begins to set fire to it but there's a woman at the top of that tower that takes a piece of millstone she takes a piece of stone and throws it out of the strong tower and the stone comes down and cracks him in the head and fractures his skull listen you could write that story any way you want but for me there's a strong tower that this bride can go into and when the enemy comes beating on the tower i've got a revelation i can roll off the top and that revelation will knock him right in the head and crack his skull break the very thing it's always the thinking the mind the reasoning the earthly carnal thinking that's always attacking this bride so back there in judges and then she drives a spike through the thinking she rolls a stone out a revelation and cracks him in the head i say praise god when we look down through the bible i can see amen i can see a woman i can see a woman of redemption i can see victory i can see myself in this resurrection ministry he opened the scriptures but he also opened our understanding to understand the scriptures when we look back down through the scriptures we can see the bride when we look down to the scriptures we can see the groom i mean when we see the groom we can see the bride too god has been working a plan and in that plan he's been expressing himself and every character in the bible and all the types and the shadows and the stories it's all been him expressing this great plan he had in his mind and it's been sealed away from the wise and prudent but revealed unto babes and we've come to the day where the bible's become a new book he's taken and taken the seals off of the book and we can look back down through and we can say i see christ there i see christ there i see christ there but i see he's using a woman too there's a woman there and a woman there and a woman there when you come into the new testament the first person that ever knows that this time for the coming of the lord is a woman mary the first person that knows the the the first two women to meet one that's carrying the forerunner and one that's carrying when he's four running they come together and when they come together the holy ghost takes over and they both begin to prophesy two women right there at the beginning of the new testament the the first person in samaria that recognizes he's the messiah is the woman at the well and then there was a woman who recognized that he needed to be anointed with oil for his burial it was a woman his disciples were all sitting there and they all said what waste and he says she has anointed me for my burial and wherever this gospel goes it will be spoken of her what did she do she caught the revelation of the hour and the manifestation in the need and all the disciples and the priests everything else missed it but a woman caught it amen the first person that he talked to the first person that he saw in his resurrection was mary magdalene who cast seven devils out he didn't cast six he didn't cast 80 cast seven because in this resurrection there's a woman who's been delivered from the seven denominations the seven church ages and he comes to her in this resurrection and he reveals his resurrection to her i tell you this bible is perfect god has showed us this message all through it it's not a few scriptures in revelation it's not a few scriptures here or there when brother branham brought to us amen in the opening of the seals he took the seals off the entire the lord jesus took the seals off the entire bible the book has been opened and now we can go back with fresh eyes and look at all those stories that we knew as children and we see him differently we used to see him now we see the mystery being unveiled now we see the plan of redemption moving forward and i say god give us eyes to see this hour that we're living in this expression that we're called to in this hour it's not something that's just happening on the side or on the sidelines this has been god's plan from before the foundation of the world i said be it unto me according to your word i believe it lord i may not be able to produce it i may not have all all my thinking right all my actions may not line up but lord i believe it with all my heart just like mary believed the voice of that angel i believe the voice of this angel and i want to say be it unto me let me embrace it lord and become one with it and let me in the message become the same now i don't want to walk through life trying to get somebody to a doctrine i want to bring somebody in contact with a person amen god bless you let's all stand musicians if you could come please let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for the privilege lord of being here looking down through your bible lord taking another walk on the road to emmaus as it were to see lord that you've laid this mystery down all through the bible god it's not something that was done just in one section or one part but this come from your mind lord and when you expressed your mind you wrote this mystery in the heavens you wrote it in the pyramid you wrote it in this bible and at the end of time lord you've come yourself you used a vessel of clay a prophet of god to express to us this great mystery that you had in your mind and now lord we go back and we see that the mystery has been hiding in plain view father i pray that you would just open our eyes and open our understanding may we look again with fresh eyes with fresh perspective and may we see you in every jaw in every tittle and every line and may the mystery become so real to us lord that we just manifest it just live it may we love you more and more and embrace you closer and closer lord we love you father we ask that you would help us lord help us to see help us to understand god i pray to be with your people and that you would bless us as we go from here may you guide us lord every day and may we become the expression that you desire in this hour lord we know that no matter what we want lord or how bad we want it there is something that you've wanted before the foundation of the world there's a plan you had a desire and by faith we believe we're part of that plan lord god help us to yield in a greater way help us to surrender more and more lord that you might come in and take more control you might have the preeminence in us lord and express yourself in us we love your father and ask lord that you would allow your grace to work in our lives allow us to surrender we ask these
