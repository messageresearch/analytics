[0:42] redeem
[0:55] over in that promised
[1:09] yes what a blessed

[6:41] uncapable unable lord but

[6:48] you are the only one who is worthy you
[6:50] are the only one who is
[6:52] capable and able lord we just want to
[6:55] come this morning and submit ourselves
[6:58] to you lord
[7:00] knowing that you through us
[7:04] makes us worthy father it will make us
[7:07] capable it will
[7:08] make us able for you are truly more than
[7:12] enough
[7:13] lord we would just ask that you would
[7:15] come have the preeminence lord i pray
[7:17] that you would just anoint the speaker
[7:20] that you would just anoint the hearer
[7:22] that you would come this morning and
[7:23] accomplish
[7:24] that which you have preordained before
[7:27] the foundation of the world
[7:29] lord that this would not just be a
[7:31] social gathering or a
[7:32] sterile teaching lord but you would come
[7:35] and do that
[7:36] which only you can do in the
[7:37] supernatural lord to
[7:39] come and to take the book and to break
[7:41] the seals and to
[7:43] feed your sheep father that there would
[7:45] be spiritual growth growing forward this
[7:48] morning lord that
[7:48] we would move farther in your plan of
[7:51] redemption lord
[7:52] that we would do our part through the
[7:54] foolishness of preaching
[7:56] and hearing of your word we thank you
[7:59] for truth lord
[8:00] we thank that you give thank you that
[8:02] you've given us something to preach lord
[8:04] that
[8:05] we don't have to come here and think of
[8:08] man's thoughts or try to put something
[8:11] together lord
[8:12] but you have came and given of yourself
[8:14] lord that
[8:15] we would have truth to walk by and we
[8:18] just pray
[8:19] that you would expound that to us this
[8:21] morning anoint us now for your service
[8:24] we pray in jesus christ's name
[8:26] the bride says amen god bless you if you
[8:30] would turn in your bibles
[8:33] before you're seated we'll go to
[8:34] revelation chapter 19
[8:37] verse number 7 thank you musicians
[8:43] i greet you this morning in the name of
[8:45] the lord jesus christ it's
[8:47] good to be with you this morning
[8:56] i realize we have a wedding today and
[8:59] this was
[9:01] not one purpose that i chose to preach
[9:03] this but i'm going to speak
[9:04] on the preamble to the marriage
[9:07] and it's literally the preamble to the
[9:09] marriage but i didn't plan that it's
[9:12] and it has nothing to do with that but
[9:14] yet it has everything to do with that
[9:16] but
[9:16] not that specific marriage um so it's
[9:19] just kind of the way that it worked out
[9:21] but
[9:22] i promise i'll have you all out of here
[9:24] by three o'clock so you'll have
[9:26] plenty enough time to get to the wedding
[9:30] maybe slightly before that but at least
[9:32] by three o'clock so
[9:34] you can just relax and we can enjoy the
[9:36] word this morning
[9:39] revelation chapter 19 verse 7
[9:42] says let us be glad and rejoice and give
[9:46] honor to him
[9:48] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[9:51] and his wife hath made herself ready
[9:54] this is a very strange verse because it
[9:56] says let
[9:57] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[10:00] him
[10:02] why are you giving honor to him when the
[10:05] wife has made herself ready
[10:07] why wouldn't you be giving honor to the
[10:09] wife
[10:12] you can have your seats
[10:16] we realize it's because he is more than
[10:19] enough
[10:20] and it's through him that is the only
[10:23] way that the wife
[10:24] has made herself ready so without him it
[10:27] would be impossible
[10:29] for him for her to have even stood a
[10:32] chance to make herself ready
[10:35] so all honor is due to him for the
[10:38] marriage of the lamb
[10:39] is come and his wife has made herself
[10:42] ready
[10:43] i want to look at
[10:46] what we would commonly refer to as a
[10:48] story
[10:49] that brother branham told in the message
[10:52] the choosing of a bride
[10:54] and were this is where my inspiration
[10:56] comes for this
[10:58] uh sermon if you want to call it that
[11:02] but we're very familiar with this story
[11:04] um
[11:05] brother branham has told it multiple
[11:07] times
[11:08] and uh very familiar
[11:11] but i found it very striking
[11:16] that he would come to this message the
[11:18] choosing of the bride
[11:19] which we know is just a cornerstone
[11:22] message of his ministry
[11:24] there in los angeles and
[11:28] just a a extremely significant
[11:32] juncture in time especially for that
[11:34] city for the pentecostal people at that
[11:36] time
[11:37] um and just a i'm not saying that
[11:40] there's
[11:41] one message more important than the
[11:43] other but you understand there there are
[11:44] certain times that brother branham is
[11:46] literally fleshing out scripture
[11:50] um he's standing there as the eliezer
[11:53] calling abroad he's standing there as
[11:55] the seventh file angel
[11:56] literally pouring out the seventh vial
[11:59] so it's not that one is more
[12:01] one message is more important than the
[12:02] other but there's just
[12:04] certain significance to certain messages
[12:08] that he would come to this this
[12:11] message and he would tell this story
[12:15] and he would lay this story if if you're
[12:19] familiar with that message choosing of
[12:20] the bride
[12:21] brother branham comes at the beginning
[12:23] of that
[12:24] and he starts he starts talking to them
[12:27] to them about his ministry
[12:30] and he says now this dr
[12:34] this monster that just whipped his tail
[12:36] farther up the coast it could come down
[12:37] this way any time and you all are asking
[12:39] me is it coming this way brother branham
[12:40] is it coming this way
[12:42] he says i don't know i don't know i
[12:43] don't have a direct word from the lord i
[12:44] don't know i can't tell you
[12:46] until i know he says that's the reason
[12:49] you have the faith
[12:50] in me that you have is because i've
[12:51] never just you know spouted off
[12:52] something i wait for the lord to tell me
[12:54] and then i tell you
[12:55] he's like now you know no man can do
[12:57] that
[12:59] and he comes again he says there was a
[13:00] little sister in my church she came
[13:02] she had had a dream she wanted to know
[13:04] the interpretation of the dream
[13:06] and brother brandon told her he says i
[13:07] think i know what that dream means
[13:08] sister but until i
[13:09] see it myself and then god gives me the
[13:12] interpretation i can't tell you that
[13:13] that's what it means
[13:15] he says i can't tell you that because if
[13:17] i was wrong
[13:19] and then there was a real significant
[13:21] juncture in your life that you needed a
[13:23] word from the lord from me
[13:25] you wouldn't know whether it was from
[13:26] the lord or not you would maybe think i
[13:28] was just guessing again
[13:30] and he he comes back around and he says
[13:31] now the uh the brother he said
[13:35] that's been in this these meetings he
[13:38] used to come and
[13:39] and look at the prayer cards of the
[13:40] people coming through
[13:42] and he said he would examine those to
[13:45] see if what i told him on the platform
[13:47] was correct
[13:48] if it was the same thing that they had
[13:49] written on the card he says never one
[13:51] time did it miss
[13:54] and he's laying this down at the
[13:55] beginning of this message
[13:58] and he keeps repeating now you know no
[14:00] man can do that
[14:02] you know no man can do that you know
[14:04] only god can do that
[14:06] you know god has to be present to do
[14:08] that what is he doing
[14:12] remember what he's preaching he's
[14:14] preaching the choosing of a bride
[14:15] there's
[14:16] about to be a marriage take place and it
[14:19] is impossible to have a marriage unless
[14:22] both parties are present
[14:24] and what he's trying to prick their
[14:26] conscience to is this is not
[14:27] a man just being present that he is
[14:30] literally here that it this has
[14:34] been god through this ministry he has
[14:36] come
[14:37] he is here there can be a marriage take
[14:40] place
[14:41] because this hasn't been a man this has
[14:43] been god
[14:45] so eliezer is going forth and he's
[14:47] letting them know
[14:50] the bridegroom is present a man cannot
[14:53] do this
[14:54] so he lays that down right at the
[14:55] beginning of that message
[14:58] and he
[15:01] he begins talking
[15:05] that there's a choice coming for the
[15:08] pentecostal people
[15:11] he says you know he's warning them about
[15:14] the world council of churches coming in
[15:16] and he just tells them flatly he tells
[15:18] them you're going to have to make a
[15:20] choice
[15:20] you're going there is going to come a
[15:22] day that you are going to have to
[15:23] choose between your denomination and the
[15:26] word
[15:29] what's he doing remember what he's
[15:31] preaching
[15:33] the choosing of a bride the bride has to
[15:36] make a choice
[15:38] he's standing there preaching the
[15:41] choosing of the bride
[15:42] but he's just making these comments
[15:45] beforehand
[15:46] laying that foundation letting them know
[15:50] that there is a choice coming there is a
[15:52] proposal coming there is a proposal
[15:53] being made
[15:54] because he is here and recognize that
[15:57] for who it is
[15:59] so he he lays that down very very early
[16:02] in that message
[16:04] and then he comes and he tells this
[16:05] story right in the middle of the message
[16:10] he tells a story he tells a story we
[16:12] think it's a story we've heard it before
[16:14] he's told it other times it's the same
[16:16] story but he comes
[16:18] after he does that and he tells this
[16:21] story
[16:22] so let's read this story and then we're
[16:24] going to expound on that by the grace of
[16:26] god
[16:27] paragraph 85 he says i've married many
[16:30] couples
[16:31] but it always reminds me of christ and
[16:33] his bride
[16:34] one of the weddings that i performed
[16:36] here some time ago was quite an
[16:37] outstanding thing in my life it's been
[16:40] several years ago when i was just a
[16:42] young minister
[16:43] now i'm paraphrasing some of this for
[16:45] time's sake but you all are familiar
[16:46] with this you can
[16:47] read it yourself starting paragraph 85
[16:50] he says my brother was working on the
[16:52] pwa and there was a boy that worked up
[16:54] there with him from indianapolis
[16:56] he said to my brother one day i want to
[16:58] get married
[16:59] if i just had enough money to pay the
[17:01] preacher doc said well my brother is a
[17:04] preacher and he may marry you
[17:05] he said he never charges people for
[17:07] things like that well that night my
[17:09] brother
[17:10] asked me and i said well if he's never
[17:12] been married before
[17:13] either one of them and everything is all
[17:15] right
[17:16] so when saturday came along the boy came
[17:19] down
[17:20] he's it's been a great thing for me
[17:23] to always look back upon this it was a
[17:26] rainy afternoon in an old chevrolet car
[17:28] with the headlights wired on with
[17:30] belling wear
[17:32] belling wire that drove up and out got a
[17:36] out got a boy out of the car and he said
[17:39] certainly did not look like a groom to
[17:41] me or would to anybody
[17:43] he had on a pair of shoes like was run
[17:45] over and his trousers was real baggy
[17:49] he had on one of these old moleskin
[17:51] jackets looks like he had been run
[17:53] through a washing machine without being
[17:54] rinsed
[17:55] and a little lady got out with a little
[17:57] checkered look dress
[17:58] and she didn't have hardly any shoes on
[18:01] she had hitchhiked from indianapolis
[18:03] had a little hair and long kind of
[18:05] plaits down her back looked very young
[18:08] and i said to her and by this time most
[18:11] of us has already tuned out because
[18:12] we've already heard this story a dozen
[18:14] times
[18:18] i said to you said to her are you old
[18:21] enough to get married
[18:22] she said yes sir she said i have my
[18:24] written permission from my father and
[18:26] mother
[18:27] she said i had to show it to the court
[18:29] here to get my license
[18:30] and i said i'd like to talk to you a
[18:32] little bit before we perform this
[18:33] wedding
[18:34] and they sat down the boy kept looking
[18:36] around the room he needed a haircut real
[18:38] bad
[18:39] and he kept looking around the room he
[18:40] wasn't listening to me
[18:42] and i said son i want you to listen to
[18:45] what i'm saying
[18:46] he said yes sir and i said do you love
[18:48] this girl
[18:50] he said yes sir i do and i said to her
[18:52] do you love him
[18:54] yes sir i do i said now have you got a
[18:57] place to take her
[18:58] after you marry said yes sir said all
[19:01] right
[19:02] no i said i want to ask you something i
[19:04] understand you're working up here on the
[19:05] pwa
[19:06] and he said yes sir that's about 12 a
[19:08] week
[19:09] i said you think you can make a living
[19:11] for her he said i'll do all that i can
[19:14] and i said well that's all right and i
[19:17] said now what if he
[19:18] what if he gets out what if he loses his
[19:20] job sister
[19:21] what are you going to do you going to
[19:23] run back home to mama
[19:24] to papa she said no sir
[19:29] i'm going to stay with them and i said
[19:32] what sir if you have three or four
[19:33] children
[19:33] nothing to feed them and you haven't got
[19:35] any work what are you going to do then
[19:37] send her away
[19:39] he said no sir i'll struggle right on
[19:41] we'll make it somehow
[19:43] he said i felt real little
[19:46] said i seen that he really loved her
[19:49] he said i married them
[19:53] if every marriage that ever took place
[19:56] would follow this pattern
[19:58] we would have zero divorces
[20:03] if every church that would move forward
[20:05] would follow this pattern
[20:07] we would have zero church splits we
[20:09] would have zero false ministries
[20:11] we would have zero hypocrisy
[20:16] i want to look at this in such
[20:18] simplicity
[20:20] but remember what he's preaching
[20:24] and remember who this is
[20:28] this is the seventh vile angel
[20:33] this is the seventh vile angel
[20:36] at the end of this message he is going
[20:39] to express
[20:41] through his lips the very words that's
[20:43] going to
[20:44] sink california this is the this is the
[20:48] seventh final angel preaching the
[20:50] choosing of the bride
[20:51] a huge juncture in time
[20:55] let me tell you a story about this
[20:56] couple that i married
[20:58] had bailing wire on the headlights poor
[21:01] close
[21:03] what is he doing there are seven
[21:07] phases to this preamble to the marriage
[21:08] i don't know why there's seven there
[21:10] just happens to be seven
[21:11] but the first thing that he does is he
[21:14] makes them both be present
[21:18] but he says are you old enough to be
[21:21] married
[21:24] he asked the lady are you old enough
[21:27] to be married
[21:32] he wants to make sure there's no legal
[21:34] implications in place
[21:36] he can't perform this wedding if she's
[21:38] not old enough to be married
[21:40] he could perform it but it would be void
[21:42] it would be irrelevant
[21:44] it would be pointless he has to
[21:47] ascertain that she is at
[21:51] an age that is legally allowed to be
[21:54] married
[21:57] what is he doing though i would
[22:01] i would venture to say that the same
[22:03] thing christ asked us
[22:06] when he is coming and looking for a
[22:07] bride
[22:09] i wonder if christ asked us the same
[22:11] thing
[22:13] are you old enough to be married we say
[22:16] we're married we say we're the bride of
[22:17] christ
[22:18] we say we're the wife of christ
[22:21] but are we old enough to be married
[22:24] are we spiritually mature enough to
[22:28] actually
[22:28] be married or are we just saying we're
[22:31] married
[22:33] see you can say you're old you're you
[22:35] can be married
[22:37] you can you can proclaim something but
[22:39] is it really true
[22:40] because if you if you aren't spiritually
[22:42] mature enough to be married
[22:44] then the marriage is null and void
[22:47] he has to to make sure that the
[22:50] preresect is fulfilled before he can
[22:53] move on are you
[22:56] old enough to be married are you
[23:00] spiritually mature enough to be married
[23:03] have you followed the preresequence we
[23:06] come and we try to say that we're the
[23:07] wife of jesus christ the bride of jesus
[23:09] christ
[23:10] and we haven't even repented or taken
[23:11] his name in water baptism
[23:13] you are not the bride of jesus christ
[23:16] you may be the bride of jesus christ in
[23:18] the future but you're not right now
[23:20] you have not spiritually matured enough
[23:23] you have not become of age you are of
[23:26] legal age to be married
[23:32] does that make sense there is a
[23:34] pre-recipient
[23:36] to this marriage there's something that
[23:39] there's a condition that has to be met
[23:41] before he can move on now i'm not
[23:44] talking about a relationship
[23:45] he never asked them are you old enough
[23:47] to be in a relationship
[23:49] he never asked him are you old enough to
[23:51] be involved here
[23:53] he asked her are you old enough to be
[23:55] married
[23:57] there's a huge difference between a
[23:59] relationship and a marriage
[24:02] a relationship you can go back on
[24:05] a marriage is death do you part
[24:09] are you old enough for that obligation
[24:12] are you old enough for that
[24:14] for that for that
[24:17] joining that spiritual union
[24:20] or are you still just flirting with the
[24:22] word
[24:23] are you does is it really the only way
[24:27] for you or is there another way for you
[24:32] have we come to a spiritual age of
[24:35] maturity
[24:38] that we can say yes yes
[24:42] i am old enough to be married farther
[24:45] more
[24:46] i have my written permission
[24:49] i have my written permission i have
[24:52] met the preresequence
[24:56] see brother branham said god wants to
[24:57] give you the holy ghost more than you
[24:59] want to have it
[25:00] but he can't fill a dirty vessel
[25:06] we come seeking that
[25:10] marriage the baptism of the holy spirit
[25:15] the the indwelling presence of christ
[25:19] himself we come seeking that
[25:23] but we haven't met the preresequence we
[25:26] can't come
[25:27] boldly and say yes i'm old enough
[25:30] lord i am old enough i am here i am
[25:32] desiring this mess
[25:33] this this marriage i
[25:36] am old enough and furthermore i have
[25:40] your written permission
[25:42] i have repented i have been baptized in
[25:46] your name
[25:46] there is no other condition needed to be
[25:49] met
[25:50] for you to marry me can we say that
[25:54] can we say that a true repentance
[25:59] a true repentance from everything from
[26:02] from
[26:03] from all of our understanding
[26:07] a true repentance see you can be
[26:09] baptized all that you want but if you
[26:11] haven't repented
[26:12] it does no good and you can say that
[26:16] you've repented all that you want
[26:17] but until you're godly sorrowful for
[26:19] what you need to repent of there's no
[26:21] repentance
[26:23] you see this is really really simple
[26:24] you're right it is
[26:26] it's as simple as the seventh vile angel
[26:28] coming to preach choosing to the bride
[26:29] and say let me tell you a story about
[26:31] this poor couple i married several years
[26:32] ago
[26:34] but do we skip right over top of it and
[26:36] miss it do we just want to move right
[26:38] into a marriage without meeting the
[26:40] conditions
[26:41] and then one day get down here and
[26:42] realize our marriage is null and void
[26:45] because we weren't spiritually mature
[26:47] enough to meet the conditions
[26:50] we didn't have our written permission to
[26:53] meet the conditions to be qualified for
[26:55] the marriage
[26:56] and again i am not talking about a
[26:58] relationship i'm not trying to take
[27:00] anybody's relationship away from them
[27:04] there's there's a process to that we
[27:06] understand but i'm talking about a
[27:08] marriage i'm talking about the marriage
[27:11] of the lamb
[27:14] and it has to follow this same pattern
[27:17] it has to follow if you if you read this
[27:20] story that brother branham tells
[27:21] he always touches on these same points
[27:24] it never changes
[27:27] that wasn't coincidence there was
[27:30] there was if you want to say a routine
[27:32] there was a procedure that he
[27:34] stuck to for these situations
[27:38] but that first one that he wanted to
[27:40] ascertain
[27:42] was if she was old enough to be married
[27:46] we obviously know that the natural types
[27:48] the spiritual
[27:50] and that's what we want to look at
[27:54] are we spiritually mature enough to
[27:57] really say
[27:59] i am prepared i am willing i
[28:03] meet the conditions to be married to the
[28:06] lamb of god
[28:07] to be married to the word of god
[28:10] to be married to the message of the
[28:14] allah
[28:16] i've not been married before that's been
[28:19] put away
[28:20] there's no prior conditions that
[28:22] prohibit me from moving forward in this
[28:24] man
[28:24] in this marriage i am present he i
[28:28] recognize
[28:28] him as being present and i recognize
[28:31] that i have fulfilled my obligations in
[28:33] the word
[28:34] to a point that i am spiritually old
[28:36] enough spiritually mature enough
[28:38] to ask him
[28:42] to fulfill this marriage to conduct this
[28:46] marriage
[28:48] i said to her are you old enough to get
[28:50] married
[28:52] she said yes sir i have my written
[28:55] permission from my father and mother
[28:58] she said i had to show it to the court
[28:59] here to get my license
[29:03] i want to look at a quote in 1959 be
[29:05] certain of god
[29:08] brother ram says you see ahab was
[29:10] reigning in israel
[29:11] and he was the wickedest of all the
[29:13] kings of israel
[29:14] there had been no king as wicked as ahab
[29:17] now he tells you why he was wicked for
[29:20] he
[29:22] being taught and knowed better
[29:25] he continued to displease god in
[29:28] everything that he did
[29:31] although he had great military system
[29:33] and the people had become very
[29:35] prosperous under his reign but yet
[29:37] you cannot please god i'm sorry you
[29:39] cannot
[29:40] displease god and expect to get by very
[29:43] long
[29:44] and then in his wedding instead of
[29:47] marrying among his own people
[29:49] he went over and married a sinner an
[29:52] idolater
[29:53] worshiper of idols he married jezebel
[29:56] and she was
[29:57] not a believer and no
[30:00] believer should ever marry an unbeliever
[30:03] under no circumstances
[30:09] there's no wiggle room there there's no
[30:11] butts
[30:12] there's no gray areas no believer
[30:17] should ever marry an unbeliever under
[30:20] no circumstances period
[30:26] that's a good foundational starting
[30:28] point for anybody that's looking to be
[30:30] married
[30:32] don't even let it cross your mind
[30:36] under no circumstances none
[30:39] zero zilch period should a believer
[30:43] ever even consider marrying an
[30:48] unbeliever
[30:50] that's per the seventh bible angel not
[30:52] me
[30:55] should always marry a believer but ahab
[30:57] had done this evil thing
[30:59] and no doubt that what jezebel was a
[31:01] beautiful woman and he had fell for what
[31:03] she looked like
[31:04] instead of what she was that so many
[31:08] people make that same mistake today
[31:15] so many people make that same mistake
[31:17] today
[31:25] you say well i know somebody that
[31:27] married an unbeliever and they're still
[31:28] married
[31:29] they're sitting in the house of god
[31:30] they're worshiping god
[31:32] they're fine it turned out just right
[31:36] go ask them how many scars they got
[31:42] go ask them what they could have avoided
[31:46] had they waited see i will not deny that
[31:49] if you're a believer
[31:50] god can reveal to you this person over
[31:52] here is
[31:53] my wife my husband
[31:56] and they're an unbeliever i will not
[31:58] deny that
[32:00] but there's a scripture for that and the
[32:02] scripture says
[32:03] watch and pray it doesn't say just watch
[32:07] see you can watch and god can reveal
[32:10] something to you
[32:11] but if you don't pray you'll get ahead
[32:13] of the word and you'll find yourself
[32:14] breaking the word and you'll find
[32:15] yourself with a bunch of scars
[32:17] and you'll find yourself outside of the
[32:19] will of god and you will find yourself
[32:21] as ahab the wickedest person on the face
[32:24] of the earth because you knew better
[32:27] you were taught better and you did it
[32:29] anyhow
[32:30] and you have nobody to blame but
[32:32] yourself under
[32:33] no circumstances should a believer ever
[32:37] marry an unbeliever
[32:42] watch and pray
[32:45] because if if you are a believer and god
[32:47] has revealed to you that that is your
[32:49] mate
[32:50] and they're not in a condition of being
[32:52] spiritually mature enough
[32:54] or in a condition of being a believer
[32:57] for you to
[32:58] marry them and move forward in a
[33:00] relationship
[33:01] then god has to move them into the
[33:03] position
[33:06] watch and pray wait and pray
[33:11] but how many times have we got ahead of
[33:12] god
[33:14] not just in the marriage but in any
[33:16] situation
[33:19] god can reveal something and we want to
[33:21] move forward
[33:22] before the proper timing before the
[33:24] proper conditions are met
[33:27] so that all of the word can be kept
[33:32] remember abel had a revelation of a
[33:34] proper sacrifice but
[33:35] abel also had the revelation of proper
[33:37] timing for a sacrifice
[33:40] so it's not it's not just the way
[33:44] but it's the timing as well and god can
[33:47] never
[33:47] break his word to fulfill his word
[33:53] he's not he's not going to break his
[33:55] word to fulfill his word he's not going
[33:56] to reveal to you this is my mate and let
[33:58] you marry
[33:59] them to fulfill his word but yet he's
[34:01] breaking his word by letting you marry
[34:03] somebody who's in an unbelieving
[34:04] condition
[34:06] praise the lord we'll move on
[34:09] titus 2 4
[34:13] i'm sorry titus 2 and 1 to verse 14.
[34:17] says but speak thou the things which
[34:20] become sound doctrine
[34:24] that the age man be sober
[34:27] grave temperant sound in faith
[34:32] in charity in patience remember we're
[34:35] talking about a
[34:36] a wedding we're talking about the
[34:38] preamble to the marriage
[34:40] these are the conditions you should be
[34:41] looking for
[34:44] we're speaking naturally right now but
[34:46] we're also speaking spiritually if
[34:48] you'll catch it
[34:52] the age men be sober grave
[34:56] temperate sound in faith
[34:59] in charity in patience the aged women
[35:03] likewise that they be in a behavior as
[35:05] becoming
[35:06] becometh holiness not false accusers
[35:10] not given to much wine teachers of good
[35:12] things
[35:13] that they may teach the young women to
[35:15] be sober to love their husbands to love
[35:18] their children
[35:19] to be discreet chase
[35:22] keepers at home good obedient to their
[35:26] husbands
[35:27] that the word of god be not blasphemed
[35:33] young men you say well that was to the
[35:35] old people
[35:37] young men likewise
[35:41] exhort to be sober minded if you're
[35:44] marrying this guy because he's the one
[35:46] he's always the funny guy and he makes
[35:48] you laugh that don't match titus too
[35:52] there's nothing wrong with humor brother
[35:54] brandon says god loves humor
[35:57] but that's not anywhere in here when it
[35:58] says when titus is giving instructions
[36:00] on what to look for and how we should
[36:02] conduct ourself
[36:04] that's that's not a characteristic
[36:07] to show that somebody's spiritually
[36:09] mature
[36:11] he says young men likewise exhort to be
[36:14] sober minded
[36:15] in all things showing thyself a pattern
[36:18] of good works
[36:19] in doctrine showing uncorruptness
[36:24] gravity sincerity sound speech
[36:28] that cannot be condemned that he that is
[36:30] of the contrary part may be ashamed
[36:32] having no evil thing to say against thee
[36:37] exhort servants to be obedient unto
[36:39] their own masters and to please them
[36:41] well in all things
[36:42] not answering again not speaking back
[36:46] not sassy not purloining
[36:50] that that word means to cheat or to
[36:52] steal but showing
[36:54] all good fidelity that they
[36:58] may adorn the doctrine of god our savior
[37:00] in all things
[37:02] for the grace of god that bringeth
[37:04] salvation hath appeared to all men
[37:06] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[37:09] worldly lust we
[37:10] should live soberly righteously
[37:14] and godly in this present world looking
[37:16] for that blessed hope the glorious
[37:18] appearing of the great god
[37:20] and our savior jesus christ who gave
[37:23] himself for us
[37:24] that he might redeem us from redeem us
[37:27] from all iniquity
[37:29] and purify and to himself a peculiar
[37:31] people
[37:32] zealous of good works
[37:37] in the natural if you are approaching a
[37:39] marriage situation or a relationship
[37:41] situation i would check it through this
[37:43] chapter
[37:46] i would check it through this chapter
[37:49] is this person sober
[37:54] are they sober minded grave
[37:57] are they temperate are they sound
[38:00] in the faith
[38:04] in charity in patience
[38:09] if it's a lady
[38:12] is her behavior that which becometh
[38:15] holiness
[38:16] or is she still flirting with the world
[38:23] not false accusers not given to much
[38:27] wine teacher of good things
[38:30] a teacher of good things
[38:33] that they may teach the young women to
[38:35] be sober
[38:37] to love their husbands to love their
[38:39] children
[38:41] you say well she's a young woman she's
[38:43] not a mother she's not in that position
[38:45] okay is she receptive to being sober
[38:49] is she receptive to just loving her
[38:51] husband
[38:52] to loving her children is she
[38:56] acting in a way of holiness
[38:59] not false accusing not given to much
[39:03] wine
[39:03] a teacher of good things
[39:06] is she interested in being discreet
[39:10] being chased being a keeper
[39:14] at home good
[39:19] obedient to her husband that the word of
[39:22] god be not blasphemed
[39:24] see we're talking about spiritual
[39:27] maturity
[39:28] a prerequisite to a marriage
[39:31] does she have her written permission
[39:34] does he
[39:35] have his written permission does he even
[39:38] know what his faith is
[39:40] is he sound in his doctrine
[39:44] is he capable of taking a headship role
[39:51] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[39:56] that he that is of the contrary part may
[39:58] be ashamed
[39:59] having no evil thing to say is his
[40:03] testimony
[40:04] such that nobody has anything to say
[40:07] about him
[40:08] negative to say about him or her
[40:10] likewise
[40:14] remember we're speaking naturally but
[40:15] think spiritually
[40:18] is that our testimony before the lord
[40:21] we're
[40:21] wanting to be married to him we're
[40:23] proclaiming we're married to him
[40:26] but have we met the conditions for that
[40:28] marriage
[40:30] do we have this written permission
[40:35] teaching us that denying ungodliness
[40:39] verse 12
[40:41] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[40:44] worldly lust
[40:45] we should live soberly righteously and
[40:48] godly in this present world
[40:50] looking for that blessed hope and the
[40:52] glorious appearing of the great god and
[40:54] our savior jesus christ
[40:56] who gave himself for us that he
[40:59] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[41:02] purify into himself a peculiar people
[41:06] zealous of good works
[41:12] remember if you try to meet these
[41:15] conditions yourself you're going to fail
[41:17] that's why he says in verse 13
[41:21] looking for that blessed hope and the
[41:22] glorious appearing
[41:24] of the great god and our savior jesus
[41:27] christ
[41:27] who gave himself for us
[41:32] that he might redeem us from all
[41:34] iniquity
[41:35] and purify unto himself a peculiar
[41:37] people
[41:38] zealous of good works remember this is
[41:40] what he's going to
[41:41] he is going to do through you to
[41:45] put you into a condition that he can
[41:47] marry
[41:48] you we have to meet that condition
[41:50] absolutely but we're not going to meet
[41:52] that condition through our own merits
[41:54] through our own self-will through our
[41:57] own efforts
[41:59] but we have to come to him
[42:02] who is able to do that
[42:05] that's sobering i know it's quiet i know
[42:10] but what i don't want to happen is for
[42:12] us to get down the road and think we're
[42:13] in a marriage
[42:15] and really all we were in was a
[42:16] relationship
[42:19] and we never actually got to the
[42:21] marriage there's nothing wrong with the
[42:23] relationship
[42:24] the relationship is essential
[42:27] but the relationship is for a purpose
[42:29] and the purpose is for a marriage and
[42:30] the remarriage
[42:31] is for reproduction for christ to
[42:33] reproduce himself
[42:36] remember that's the point
[42:40] the relationship understand what i'm
[42:42] saying the relationship's not the point
[42:45] the marriage is not the point
[42:47] reproduction is the point
[42:49] brother brown says why did the son of
[42:52] man do this
[42:53] why did he come again why is he here in
[42:55] this ministry
[42:57] to reproduce himself again
[43:01] through you and me remember that's the
[43:04] end goal
[43:05] that's the purpose what was adam and
[43:07] eve's
[43:08] what was adam's first instructions
[43:12] multiply and replenish the earth
[43:16] farther express christ that's the
[43:19] purpose
[43:21] but we we're never going to get to the
[43:24] purpose
[43:24] if we try to skip the pre-resequence
[43:28] and we don't want to get confused about
[43:30] why
[43:31] am i not reproducing christ why am i not
[43:34] able to reproduce
[43:36] christ maybe you haven't actually
[43:39] married him
[43:41] maybe you're still stuck in the
[43:42] relationship portion
[43:44] moving to a marriage and again i'm not
[43:47] taking that away
[43:48] you're never going to get to a marriage
[43:49] without a relationship or at least you
[43:52] shouldn't
[43:54] but let's make sure that we have the end
[43:56] goal inside let's make sure that we have
[43:59] our written permission
[44:00] let's make sure that there is nothing
[44:01] that's going to
[44:03] to void our marriage
[44:07] 1957 continuing with this thought that
[44:10] titus lays down
[44:12] 1957 brother brainer says he was to pass
[44:15] that way
[44:16] in the message that he was to pass that
[44:17] way god knows that we need more women
[44:20] like that today
[44:21] when womanhood is broke the backbone
[44:25] of the nation is broke
[44:28] a woman's place is at home with her
[44:30] children
[44:32] now if her husband's sick and she has to
[44:34] work that's different
[44:35] but woman's place is at home in the
[44:37] kitchen and when she leaves that she's
[44:39] out of her place exactly right
[44:44] we don't hear that too awful much
[44:45] anymore
[44:47] around what we would call the ranks of
[44:48] the message that's not as popular
[44:50] as it used to be it's not as palatable
[44:53] as it used to be
[44:55] that's not as culturally culturally
[44:57] acceptable as it used to be
[45:00] but i'll remind you the seventh vile
[45:02] angel said it
[45:03] he said when she gets out of the kitchen
[45:05] she's out of her place
[45:09] that's just as much the message as
[45:11] revelation 10
[45:12] 7. when she gets out of the kitchen
[45:16] she's out of her place
[45:18] 1965 the choosing to the bride he says
[45:21] now for
[45:22] it is becoming if a christian would
[45:24] choose a wife
[45:25] he ought to choose a genuine born-again
[45:27] woman
[45:28] regardless of what she looks like if he
[45:31] marries a girl that ain't got enough
[45:33] moral about her to stay home and take
[45:35] care of a house
[45:36] and wants to work out in somebody's
[45:38] office what kind of a housekeeper will
[45:41] she be
[45:42] you'll have babysitters and everything
[45:44] else
[45:45] it's true now i'm not much of this
[45:48] modern taste modernistic taste of women
[45:51] working
[45:53] where is he getting that from titus 2
[45:59] titus 2 is where he's getting that from
[46:06] 1957 questions and answers he says
[46:10] now look in america day in america today
[46:13] are women
[46:14] a young man from kentucky told me a few
[46:16] days ago
[46:17] there was 800 women working at a certain
[46:20] plant here in kentucky
[46:21] and he said i could possibly feel safely
[46:24] and swearing that 400 of them
[46:26] is absolute street prostitutes and
[46:29] married women with children one guy took
[46:32] his wife
[46:33] out there and worked her up with the
[46:35] board and then he liked to kill her
[46:38] and another one went on to shoot a man
[46:41] and another one cutting and fighting
[46:43] that shouldn't be
[46:45] that's not right put women back in the
[46:48] kitchen where she belongs
[46:49] then everything will be okay
[46:53] but you put her out there in the public
[46:54] work she's gone
[46:58] the american woman snicker up their nose
[47:01] and say there's nothing to that
[47:03] and you show me certainly you've got to
[47:06] do that the bible predicted you would do
[47:08] that
[47:09] you have to do it it used to be a long
[47:11] time ago
[47:12] in a methodist church if a woman cut her
[47:14] hair she was put out of the church
[47:16] certainly they did yes indeedy nazarenes
[47:19] pilgrim holiness
[47:21] pentecostals all of them used to do it
[47:23] but what happened
[47:25] you know why you got some sissies behind
[47:28] the pulpit
[47:28] that's exactly right somebody's afraid
[47:31] of their meal ticket
[47:32] afraid you'd excommunicate them run them
[47:34] out of the church
[47:35] they didn't have the very audacity
[47:39] to stand on god's word whether it hurt
[47:43] or whether it didn't
[47:44] that's exactly right listen here the man
[47:47] is the ruler don't think you'll rule the
[47:51] house
[47:52] you're not the ruler of the house you're
[47:54] not a slave now
[47:56] but you're a helpmate the man has the
[47:59] rule over his wife and he's responsible
[48:01] solely for his wife
[48:03] god makes the man answer for his wife
[48:08] now read and see if god says that now
[48:13] where is he getting that titus 2.
[48:17] now i'm going to read something else
[48:18] it'll throw you for a loop
[48:21] 1964 questions and answers brother
[48:23] branham
[48:24] are women allowed to work in public
[48:26] affairs when they have a healthy husband
[48:28] and children
[48:28] i am asking this question for somebody
[48:30] else
[48:32] lovely well
[48:36] i don't know about that
[48:39] i can't say but i just have this feeling
[48:44] let me say this i believe if a woman and
[48:47] i know
[48:48] that my if i was a woman and i know that
[48:50] my husband was healthy and had a good
[48:52] job working
[48:53] i believe it would be a great pleasure
[48:55] for me to stay home and take care of my
[48:57] children
[48:58] and raise them up and to love the lord
[49:00] and if i had any time
[49:02] from my washing and things that i was
[49:03] going to do i would teach my children
[49:06] how to serve the lord
[49:08] now if you've got a debt or something
[49:11] that you're trying to help your husband
[49:13] pay for
[49:14] or something that you have to do that
[49:17] well i think that's fine
[49:19] if you'll try to help him
[49:23] and you live a lady and i think it's
[49:26] hard no man that's got a
[49:27] good understanding
[49:31] you say well maybe we've been hard on
[49:32] the women so far think about this
[49:34] no man that's got a good understanding
[49:38] wants his wife to get into a bunch where
[49:41] there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and
[49:43] things like that
[49:44] but if the woman has to get out i think
[49:47] that her husband ought to know that
[49:48] she's a genuine christian
[49:50] that can be trusted a trustworthy woman
[49:52] but now to say that she shouldn't work
[49:55] i don't know
[49:58] i don't know see there's always a
[50:01] loophole
[50:02] there's always something you can find to
[50:04] justify it if you want brother rem said
[50:05] he didn't know
[50:06] read what he said before that
[50:11] see there's no scripture to back that up
[50:13] i'm just passing that opinion
[50:15] he's saying there's no scripture that
[50:16] says thou a woman thou shalt not work
[50:19] out in public affairs he's saying
[50:22] there's no scripture to back that up i'm
[50:24] just passing that opinion
[50:25] but i think if a woman wants to work and
[50:27] she wants to work now i'm
[50:29] certainly against woman women working in
[50:31] these offices
[50:32] where all these businessmen they carry
[50:34] on they tell dirty jokes and a nice
[50:36] clean woman sitting there and all these
[50:38] smutty
[50:39] dirty things being told around like that
[50:41] i'm against that i think you ought to
[50:43] come out from among such
[50:44] stuff as that but now if a woman can
[50:46] hold herself
[50:47] as a real lady and try to help her
[50:50] husband do something
[50:52] some clothes for the kids to go to
[50:54] school
[50:55] or to pay off a bill or something like
[50:57] that and she wants to work until that's
[51:00] over
[51:03] now this not the lord because i don't
[51:05] have no scripture for this i'm just
[51:07] saying that be my
[51:08] opinion but otherwise i wouldn't think
[51:11] just because she wants to work
[51:13] just to run around and have more money
[51:15] to spend
[51:16] to run around and to run to bar rooms or
[51:18] drink and smoke and carry on
[51:20] i don't think she should do that i think
[51:23] she should stay home
[51:25] try to be a lady take care of her house
[51:30] see brother branham is not trying to
[51:33] take
[51:33] black and white and say thou shall and
[51:35] thou shalt not
[51:36] because if he does that what happens
[51:38] there's no relationship
[51:41] it's just a letter of the law which
[51:43] would be fun there's nothing wrong with
[51:44] the letter of the law but that's not
[51:45] what christ was after
[51:47] christ was after a relationship so it's
[51:49] why brother
[51:50] it's the same reason brother branham
[51:51] would stand there and blast cutting
[51:53] women's hair
[51:54] dyeing their hair perming their hair
[51:56] wearing but he would blast that to no
[51:58] end
[51:59] and then he would say now if you're if
[52:01] you think you look sickly or
[52:02] you've got something going on and you
[52:03] need a little bit of collar then go
[52:05] ahead
[52:08] give me give me one or the other how can
[52:10] you do both because it's
[52:12] not a dictatorship it's a relationship
[52:16] the purpose is not just to keep the
[52:18] letter of the law
[52:19] if that was the purpose the scribes and
[52:21] pharisees were fine what he was after
[52:23] was a relationship
[52:27] understand and that's what he's saying
[52:29] with this same situation he's saying
[52:31] i'm not i'm not for women being out
[52:32] there working but brother branham is so
[52:35] is not so naive to think that there's
[52:37] not situations to where a woman has to
[52:39] work
[52:41] whether she's an orphan or whether her
[52:42] husband has passed away or like he said
[52:44] whether she's sick
[52:45] or whether they just came into a
[52:46] marriage in a in a poor financial
[52:49] situation
[52:49] and they're trying to pay some bills off
[52:52] but that's why he says what he says he
[52:53] says
[52:54] until that's over until that's done but
[52:57] what i'll caution you and let you know
[52:59] right often from first-hand experience
[53:01] is that laodicea will never let you have
[53:03] that over and done with
[53:04] there will always be something and if
[53:07] you give that cow enough rope it will
[53:09] hang itself
[53:10] and you will never get to enough is
[53:12] enough
[53:14] you've got to come back to the word of
[53:16] god you've got to come back to the word
[53:18] of god
[53:18] and you have to operate by revelation
[53:21] you have to operate by the scripture
[53:23] you have to operate by titus too you
[53:26] have to
[53:26] run it through that filter because if
[53:28] not laodicea will convince you that
[53:31] she has to work
[53:34] every day over time
[53:38] and if she doesn't we won't make it
[53:41] laodicea is a
[53:43] master of that and he says
[53:46] he gives a couple reasons here to
[53:49] justify her work and he says
[53:52] if she's trying to help her husband do
[53:54] something or to buy some
[53:56] some clothes for the kids to go to
[53:58] school
[53:59] i'm not convinced that he's saying she
[54:02] needs to go to work so you can
[54:04] buy the designer brand of clothes to go
[54:06] to school
[54:09] that are 40 more than the other ones
[54:14] that dad could have afforded but dad
[54:16] can't afford the designer brand you
[54:18] understand what i'm saying
[54:19] see saints there if you want loopholes
[54:21] you can find loopholes
[54:23] but that's not what he's after what he's
[54:25] after is
[54:26] remember the first question he asked are
[54:29] you
[54:29] old enough for the marriage
[54:33] are you spiritually mature enough for
[54:35] the marriage or are you still looking
[54:37] for loopholes
[54:39] to do what you really want to do
[54:46] the prerequisite to the marriage that's
[54:49] what he's talking about
[54:52] for the kids to go to school or to pay
[54:54] off a bill remember to pay off a bill
[54:57] not to create another bill so you have
[54:59] to pay that one off too
[55:04] see it you can't as a minister you can't
[55:06] stay up
[55:07] stand here and just throw a blanket over
[55:08] everything and say any woman that's
[55:10] working
[55:11] uh and any man that lets her work is out
[55:13] of the will of god i can't do that
[55:14] nobody can do that
[55:16] nobody can do that because there's too
[55:20] many
[55:20] situations you're foolish to try to do
[55:23] that
[55:24] but what i would say is look at the
[55:26] scripture run it through the scripture
[55:28] does it meet the conditions
[55:32] what is your mode of an objective
[55:37] what's the purpose what's the intent
[55:42] you say well i don't want money to run
[55:44] to the bar rooms
[55:45] and to drink and to smoke
[55:48] maybe you want it to carry on though
[55:53] maybe you want it for whatever reason
[55:55] and if that's
[55:56] if that's a godly holy justifiable
[55:59] reason
[55:59] then go for it i'm not here to condemn
[56:02] that situation
[56:04] what i'm trying to do is bring attention
[56:09] to what the motive and objective is to
[56:11] bring attention are we spirit are we
[56:13] operating at a spiritually mature level
[56:16] are we still stuck in laodicea in a
[56:19] laodicean condition and a laodicean
[56:21] mindset and in a cultural mindset
[56:24] it's getting to the point i'm just being
[56:26] honest with you it's getting to the
[56:27] point you can't even
[56:28] bring up these quotes in certain message
[56:31] circles
[56:32] with fellowship with people and i'm not
[56:34] pointing to churches or other ministries
[56:35] or anything
[56:36] i'm just i'm just saying it's getting to
[56:38] the point that
[56:40] just commonly associated with what we
[56:42] would say message believers
[56:44] it gets uncomfortable you start talking
[56:46] about these things
[56:48] why is that it should not be
[56:53] it should not be that way we should be
[56:55] comfortable
[56:56] saying that's what the seventh vile
[56:58] angel said that's what the seventh
[57:00] church age messenger said
[57:02] you say well he just said that was his
[57:03] opinion yeah okay
[57:06] that was just his opinion maybe you have
[57:08] a better one
[57:10] let me hear that no i don't want to hear
[57:12] that
[57:14] i'm gonna i'm gonna take the man who's
[57:15] standing in los angeles
[57:17] fleshing out the seventh vile angels
[57:20] ministry
[57:21] and i'm probably gonna give a little bit
[57:22] of weight to that opinion
[57:26] he's expressing his opinion why is he
[57:29] expressing his opinion
[57:31] because heggy i knew what the king liked
[57:34] because ellie easier eliezer knew
[57:37] abraham and he knew his son and he knew
[57:40] what he liked
[57:41] and he knew that anybody that would be
[57:44] interested in them
[57:45] would want to know what their opinion
[57:47] was and their opinion would be good
[57:49] enough
[57:52] he wasn't looking to tie rachel to the
[57:55] back of a camel and drag her there
[57:58] he was looking for her to want to go
[58:01] and if she was really the one she would
[58:03] be interested in isaac's opinion
[58:08] [Music]
[58:10] remember we're talking about a marriage
[58:12] you say no you're not you're just
[58:13] cutting the women down
[58:14] no i'm not
[58:17] and this is not to anybody god's honest
[58:20] truth i have no idea about anybody's
[58:21] situation
[58:22] what anybody's doing i have nobody in
[58:24] mind when i'm saying this i'm just
[58:25] preaching spiritual principles
[58:27] if it hits you praise the lord it's hit
[58:29] me before
[58:32] i wasn't going to do this and i'm
[58:33] probably going to end up crying when i
[58:35] do this but i'm going to do it anyhow
[58:36] just so you know i'm not cutting at you
[58:39] me and my wife were married for nine
[58:40] years no children
[58:43] my wife was working we came into the
[58:44] marriage with financial issues
[58:46] she worked we got those issues taken
[58:48] care of she continued to work that was
[58:49] my choice not hers
[58:50] just ask her she'll let you know but i
[58:53] was stuck in a condition to where we
[58:55] could not make it without that
[58:56] but the lord laid on my heart one day
[58:58] she's done cut it off
[59:00] done this was not good timing because i
[59:03] just went off work on disability with a
[59:04] back issue
[59:06] i was released from that job i was out
[59:08] of a job
[59:10] we were getting ready to build a house
[59:13] we just bought property to build the
[59:15] house on so like every condition
[59:17] that you can think of laodicea would
[59:19] line up to say this is not going to work
[59:21] if she does this
[59:22] it was there i'm not going to go through
[59:23] all the details for embarrassment's sake
[59:26] but i'm just letting you know this was
[59:27] not the proper timing
[59:29] this was not the proper timing but it
[59:31] was extremely clear
[59:32] she's done i told her you're done you're
[59:35] not going back
[59:36] two weeks notice on that day you're done
[59:41] within 48 hours of us making that
[59:44] decision
[59:44] she conceived with william
[59:48] you say well that's coincidental you're
[59:50] right
[59:51] you're right it's coincidental
[59:54] no it's a prerequisite
[1:00:00] it's lining up with the word of god
[1:00:04] it was a miracle the doctor you all know
[1:00:06] the testimony the doctors had told her
[1:00:07] she could not have babies
[1:00:10] but yet there was something hindering
[1:00:12] that and when that hindrance was
[1:00:14] moved god can do the supernatural so if
[1:00:16] you think i'm just cutting on somebody
[1:00:18] here you're wrong
[1:00:20] i'm not cutting on anybody i've been
[1:00:22] there i've done that i've made poor
[1:00:23] decisions i've made wrong decisions
[1:00:25] but what i'm here to tell you is you can
[1:00:27] make those decisions
[1:00:28] right and when you remove
[1:00:31] all barriers god can do the supernatural
[1:00:36] it was the worst timing possible
[1:00:39] for that decision worst timing
[1:00:43] possible
[1:00:47] worst timing possible
[1:00:51] but when god says do something you do it
[1:00:55] and then look what god has done
[1:00:58] look what god has done i wish god would
[1:01:01] stop actually
[1:01:04] but look what god has done praise the
[1:01:08] lord i guess it's payback for my wrong
[1:01:09] decisions
[1:01:13] but would i rather still be stuck
[1:01:17] struggling in a laodicean condition
[1:01:19] where enough is never enough
[1:01:21] or would i have rather had william at
[1:01:23] the worst
[1:01:24] possible time
[1:01:27] i'd rather have him i'd rather i'd
[1:01:30] rather be
[1:01:31] worse than what it was and still have
[1:01:32] him
[1:01:34] but that's what god can do so understand
[1:01:39] i'm not cutting at anybody and i'm not
[1:01:41] trying to point at anybody
[1:01:44] i've made those wrong decisions myself
[1:01:46] but what i'm saying is let's
[1:01:48] quit soft soaping those let's quit
[1:01:52] soft soaping those and let's let's
[1:01:55] recognize what the angel told us
[1:01:58] and let's be comfortable saying what the
[1:02:00] angel told us i don't care whether it is
[1:02:02] culturally appropriate or not
[1:02:05] in fact if it is culturally culturally
[1:02:08] appropriate it probably means it's wrong
[1:02:12] i don't care if the rest of the ranks of
[1:02:14] the message will preach it or not
[1:02:16] i'm going to preach it because it's what
[1:02:17] he said
[1:02:19] it's what we need it's a prerequisite to
[1:02:22] the marriage
[1:02:24] how are you going to marry christ
[1:02:27] still trying to take care of yourself
[1:02:31] not going to happen
[1:02:34] you young sisters oh lord help me i'm
[1:02:37] gonna get in trouble now
[1:02:40] if god has told you to go to college and
[1:02:42] get an education to provide for yourself
[1:02:44] then you
[1:02:45] do it but if you are operating out of
[1:02:48] fear that i might have to take care of
[1:02:51] myself
[1:02:52] you are wrong you are out of the will of
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] you have no right being there
[1:03:01] if god has told you to do it then you go
[1:03:03] do it
[1:03:04] but remember you as a human being
[1:03:06] operate by two forces
[1:03:07] fear or faith and if you are operating
[1:03:11] out of a what may be down the road
[1:03:14] out of fear that you might have to take
[1:03:16] care of yourself maybe you won't get
[1:03:18] married
[1:03:20] or if you're a if you're a married
[1:03:22] couple
[1:03:23] and you're trying to go and line
[1:03:26] yourself up for a career and
[1:03:27] in case something happens to your
[1:03:29] husband you are not
[1:03:30] operating out of revelation that is fear
[1:03:33] it is
[1:03:34] fear of what may take place and that is
[1:03:37] wrong
[1:03:38] that is wrong you we are not to operate
[1:03:41] out of fear
[1:03:43] and if god has revealed for you to go
[1:03:46] and to do that
[1:03:47] then it's not going to be operating out
[1:03:49] of fear
[1:03:51] and i don't care what field that is i
[1:03:52] don't care if it's
[1:03:54] one day of training or an eight-year
[1:03:55] college degree i don't care what it is
[1:03:59] but if you're moving into that path out
[1:04:02] of
[1:04:02] fear or out of what load of seeing will
[1:04:04] do laodicea will dump
[1:04:06] on you of what may be or what could
[1:04:08] happen or you better prepare for this or
[1:04:10] you better prepare for that you're wrong
[1:04:14] absolutely wrong it has to be by
[1:04:17] revelation god may reveal to you to go
[1:04:21] sign up for college as a lady
[1:04:24] for an year course just so you'll meet
[1:04:27] your husband on month number one
[1:04:30] and then you're done you say well god
[1:04:34] gave me a revelation for the
[1:04:35] for the for the eight month or for the
[1:04:36] eight year course don't miss the purpose
[1:04:40] remember check it by the word and if
[1:04:43] you've met your husband there and this
[1:04:45] is the one that you're
[1:04:46] that you're wanting to take care of you
[1:04:49] why would you still
[1:04:50] go through all of this to take care of
[1:04:51] yourself it's like
[1:04:53] us coming to christ and saying be my
[1:04:55] lord be my lord be my lord but i'm going
[1:04:57] to do this
[1:04:59] remember that's what leotis laodicean
[1:05:02] was rich increased with goods need of
[1:05:06] nothing
[1:05:07] but be my lord i don't i don't really
[1:05:09] need you i don't really need you to take
[1:05:11] care of me but be my lord
[1:05:12] no it's you're saying two opposite
[1:05:14] things
[1:05:19] you see that's really simple it is
[1:05:21] simple and i have no idea why i'm even
[1:05:23] preaching this but praise the lord
[1:05:26] we we get so revelated
[1:05:30] we get so revelated that we miss the
[1:05:33] simple things
[1:05:34] we get so revelated that we got women
[1:05:37] our message
[1:05:38] believing christian women back out in
[1:05:40] the workforce with no reason
[1:05:42] we were so revelated about being in a
[1:05:45] marriage and being the bride of jesus
[1:05:47] christ
[1:05:48] that were that we're flirting with
[1:05:49] fashions of the world
[1:05:51] adorning ourselves with things we
[1:05:53] shouldn't be
[1:05:55] you say well say something about the men
[1:05:58] i just did because if you're a man and
[1:06:01] you're allowing her to do that
[1:06:03] you don't even have a backbone that's
[1:06:05] what he said
[1:06:06] no you have a wishbone for a backbone we
[1:06:09] get
[1:06:10] so highly revelated in this marriage
[1:06:13] that we're in
[1:06:15] that i wonder sometimes are we really in
[1:06:17] a marriage
[1:06:20] when we're neglecting these simple
[1:06:22] things
[1:06:26] when we are when we're not spiritually
[1:06:29] mature enough
[1:06:30] just to stay home and take care of the
[1:06:34] house
[1:06:35] and take care of the kids and let him
[1:06:38] take care of us
[1:06:40] and not fall under the load of sea and
[1:06:43] fear well what if he can't take care of
[1:06:45] me
[1:06:46] i got i need to do this i need to
[1:06:48] prepare for this
[1:06:50] i need to no no
[1:06:53] we've missed it and that is what the
[1:06:56] devil
[1:06:56] specializes in that is what lodesia
[1:06:59] specializes
[1:07:00] in is fear fear of what could be
[1:07:03] fear of what could happen and you better
[1:07:06] prepare for that
[1:07:07] no a true marriage is
[1:07:11] rest for that lady she is resting
[1:07:14] she lays that veil over his shoulder he
[1:07:17] has inherited
[1:07:18] everything for her and if he goes down
[1:07:22] the tubes
[1:07:24] then he's going to have to have a plan
[1:07:26] to take care of her when he's down the
[1:07:27] tubes
[1:07:29] it's not see
[1:07:33] it's not her responsibility to have a
[1:07:36] backup plan
[1:07:41] because you can't as a lady
[1:07:44] i'm not just speaking naturally i'm
[1:07:46] speaking spiritually think
[1:07:48] you can't as a lady in the natural or
[1:07:50] the spiritual as bright
[1:07:51] bright of jesus christ you cannot be a
[1:07:55] true bride if
[1:07:56] you're constantly trying to come up with
[1:07:57] a backup plan
[1:07:59] because in order in order for you to
[1:08:02] even facilitate a backup plan
[1:08:04] you have to put yourself in a
[1:08:06] decision-making role and you're out
[1:08:08] you've you're off to begin with
[1:08:13] but it comes so slick and it comes so
[1:08:16] sly
[1:08:17] that we'll find ourselves operating out
[1:08:19] of fear
[1:08:20] and maybe we never act it out but we've
[1:08:23] already taken a
[1:08:24] a wrong spirit on ourselves
[1:08:28] and and made a backup plan
[1:08:34] god does not want you to have a backup
[1:08:36] plan
[1:08:37] no more than your husband wants you to
[1:08:38] have a backup plan if your husband needs
[1:08:41] you to have a backup plan he'll give you
[1:08:42] the backup plan
[1:08:48] if he's a true husband he will because
[1:08:50] that's what god does
[1:08:52] if god needs us to have a backup plan
[1:08:53] he'll give us a backup plan
[1:08:55] will he not let me ask you this what is
[1:08:58] your other option
[1:09:00] to come up with your own backup plan
[1:09:06] if you can't really trust him for
[1:09:08] everything
[1:09:09] what are you going to do are you going
[1:09:13] to
[1:09:13] you think your backup plan is going to
[1:09:15] work
[1:09:17] it is not going to work it is not going
[1:09:21] to work and you're going to be the
[1:09:22] wickedest person on the face of the
[1:09:24] earth because you've been
[1:09:25] taught better and you know better and
[1:09:27] you did it anyhow
[1:09:29] remember we're talking about a marriage
[1:09:32] a marriage for that lady is a full
[1:09:35] commitment
[1:09:36] not if this don't work out i'll try
[1:09:39] another
[1:09:42] i hope you catch what i'm saying
[1:09:46] i hope you're thinking spiritually
[1:09:49] remember we don't want to get down to
[1:09:51] the end of the line
[1:09:52] thinking we were married when we really
[1:09:54] weren't
[1:09:59] thinking we had met the conditions when
[1:10:01] we really hadn't
[1:10:03] there's a lot of natural things to
[1:10:05] preach when you're preaching on this
[1:10:06] topic
[1:10:06] topic there's a lot of spiritual
[1:10:08] principles that we could go down
[1:10:11] and they're important because if you
[1:10:14] don't have
[1:10:15] if you if you have no desire to flesh
[1:10:17] out
[1:10:18] naturally what you believe spiritually
[1:10:20] then what good is it
[1:10:23] but we also want to think spiritually
[1:10:27] and we don't want to assume that we're
[1:10:30] in a position that we're really not
[1:10:34] i am so lost right now i have no idea
[1:10:36] where i'm at
[1:10:49] you've got some sissies behind the
[1:10:50] pulpit that's exactly right somebody's
[1:10:52] afraid they're miltic and afraid they'll
[1:10:54] you'd excommunicate them run them out of
[1:10:56] the church
[1:10:57] they didn't have the very audacity to
[1:10:59] stand to stand on god's word whether it
[1:11:02] hurt or whether it didn't that's exactly
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:05] i don't ever want to be a i don't
[1:11:08] ever want to have the
[1:11:09] not have the audacity to say what he
[1:11:11] said
[1:11:12] whether it's culturally appropriate or
[1:11:14] not and i'm gonna
[1:11:15] move on i think but i just want to
[1:11:18] say this i'm not pointing that at
[1:11:21] anybody
[1:11:23] i've shared with you my my own situation
[1:11:26] look what god's done for me i'm not
[1:11:28] going to go into all the details
[1:11:29] with that but god is supernatural
[1:11:32] when you line up with the word of god he
[1:11:34] is supernatural
[1:11:36] there is nothing i think a lot of times
[1:11:39] we get
[1:11:40] so confused about what's going on
[1:11:44] and why isn't there supernatural
[1:11:47] happening in my life
[1:11:48] it's because we've got the channel
[1:11:49] clocked see the supernatural
[1:11:52] should be natural to the bride of jesus
[1:11:54] christ
[1:11:57] i think what happens a lot of times is
[1:11:59] we get so the channel so
[1:12:01] clogged up with things that won't go
[1:12:03] through the filter of the word
[1:12:05] that when we finally get it unclogged
[1:12:07] and god's able just to do something he
[1:12:09] normally would do
[1:12:10] we're like oh my goodness that was
[1:12:12] supernatural
[1:12:14] no it really wasn't it was just
[1:12:17] you getting the channel unclogged was
[1:12:22] william supernatural absolutely no
[1:12:25] doubts about it but maybe it was just me
[1:12:27] getting the channel unclawed
[1:12:29] maybe it was just me lining up with the
[1:12:31] word
[1:12:32] maybe it was just us forsaking our own
[1:12:35] understanding
[1:12:36] and saying we're going to do what god
[1:12:38] has said to do
[1:12:43] so i'm not pointing that in anybody i'm
[1:12:45] not trying to make it hard i'm not
[1:12:46] trying to offend anybody
[1:12:48] i'm not saying be a be offensive to be
[1:12:51] offensive
[1:12:52] you've got the wrong spirit if you're
[1:12:53] doing that but what i'm saying is don't
[1:12:55] be afraid of the word of god
[1:12:57] don't be ashamed of the word of god
[1:12:59] brother branham preached this raw
[1:13:01] he preached it rough he preached it
[1:13:04] unapologetically
[1:13:06] we should not be backing up on those
[1:13:09] things
[1:13:10] those simple things i found it so
[1:13:12] astounding i can't remember what message
[1:13:14] that it was but brother branham comes to
[1:13:15] the end of his ministry
[1:13:18] and he is desperately praying out to god
[1:13:21] and he says oh god i just long
[1:13:24] for the day remember who this
[1:13:28] is his position in the scripture
[1:13:31] and he is crying out to god in
[1:13:33] desperation i'm longing for the day
[1:13:37] and of all things that he could say what
[1:13:38] do you think he said
[1:13:41] i am longing for the day
[1:13:45] to see men just be men and
[1:13:48] women be women you tell me how simple
[1:13:52] this
[1:13:52] is you tell me how deep it is
[1:13:58] you tell me whether it should be
[1:14:00] preached or not you tell me whether it
[1:14:02] should be lived or not
[1:14:05] if we make it that simple don't worry
[1:14:08] about missing the marriage
[1:14:11] you're in a marriage you've made the
[1:14:13] marriage
[1:14:14] you have the nature of the husband you
[1:14:16] are reproducing the husband
[1:14:18] the word in the simplicity of it of all
[1:14:21] things that he could say
[1:14:23] that he longed for he just longed for
[1:14:26] the day when a man would be a man
[1:14:28] and a woman would be a woman
[1:14:37] so what i was going to say is i want to
[1:14:39] leave that topic with
[1:14:40] with this statement whatever you do
[1:14:43] man or woman do it by revelation
[1:14:49] don't do it by fear don't do it by fear
[1:14:53] don't do it out of what may be or what
[1:14:55] could happen
[1:14:56] do it by revelation because if you're
[1:15:00] doing it by revelation
[1:15:01] i can come here or any other minister
[1:15:03] can come here and preach
[1:15:05] it against something as hard as we can
[1:15:07] preach against it and it will never
[1:15:08] prick your heart
[1:15:10] because god has revealed for you to do
[1:15:12] something
[1:15:14] and that's what brother branham does
[1:15:15] here he says you know women working i
[1:15:17] can't say i don't have a scripture that
[1:15:18] says that said the lord women shouldn't
[1:15:20] work
[1:15:21] but he points you back to the
[1:15:22] relationship with the word
[1:15:24] why are you working why do you want to
[1:15:26] work
[1:15:28] so that's what i would just say i'm not
[1:15:30] throwing a blanket over every situation
[1:15:32] i can't do that nobody can do that
[1:15:33] brother branham didn't even do that
[1:15:35] all i'm saying is don't operate by fear
[1:15:39] be in a marriage
[1:15:42] be in a marriage be committed
[1:15:46] and just operate by revelation because
[1:15:49] if
[1:15:50] he reveals for you to do something
[1:15:52] you're safe in doing it
[1:15:54] there's no fear in doing it and you're
[1:15:57] perfectly fine
[1:15:59] but we look at that in the natural
[1:16:03] but that's exactly what the church does
[1:16:05] in the spiritual
[1:16:06] how many churches have tried to take
[1:16:08] care of themselves
[1:16:10] every denomination that is on the face
[1:16:13] of the earth
[1:16:14] has made that mistake brother branham
[1:16:16] said they did they said they got this
[1:16:17] much of the word they said oh my
[1:16:19] oh my goodness this may not be enough we
[1:16:20] got to build a fence around it and
[1:16:22] protect it
[1:16:25] that sounds like what he just said
[1:16:28] that's what the church has done do you
[1:16:30] think that's pleasing to god
[1:16:32] no that's what the churches have done
[1:16:36] they've
[1:16:36] tried to take care of himself god what
[1:16:39] i'm trying to say is god don't want you
[1:16:41] trying to take care of yourself
[1:16:42] that's what i'm trying to say
[1:16:46] praise the lord finally got it out
[1:16:56] praise the lord brother brown says in
[1:17:00] the choosing of a bride
[1:17:02] the same applies by choosing a church
[1:17:06] now you must pray over the church that
[1:17:09] you are fellowshipping in
[1:17:10] remember churches carry spirits
[1:17:13] now i don't want to be critical but i
[1:17:16] realize that i'm an old man and i got to
[1:17:18] leave here one of these days
[1:17:19] and i've got to answer at the day of
[1:17:21] judgment for what i say to you tonight
[1:17:23] or any other time
[1:17:24] and therefore i've got to be dead
[1:17:26] earnest and truly convicted
[1:17:28] but you go into a church and you'll
[1:17:30] watch the behavior of that pastor
[1:17:33] watch what the past watch the pastor a
[1:17:35] while and you'll usually find that the
[1:17:37] church acts like the pastor
[1:17:40] sometimes i wonder if we don't just get
[1:17:43] one another
[1:17:44] spirit instead of the holy spirit
[1:17:47] you get to a place where a pastor is
[1:17:49] real radical and carrying on
[1:17:51] you'll find the congregation is the same
[1:17:53] way
[1:17:54] i'll bring you to a church where i see
[1:17:56] the pastor stand and jerk his
[1:17:59] jerk his head back and forth you watch
[1:18:01] the congregation they do the same thing
[1:18:03] you take a pastor that just gulps down
[1:18:06] anything
[1:18:07] usually the church will do the same
[1:18:09] thing so if i was
[1:18:10] choosing a church i'd choose a genuine
[1:18:14] fundamental full gospel bible church
[1:18:18] if i was choosing one to put my family
[1:18:24] in
[1:18:28] why do they act like the pastor just for
[1:18:31] the record
[1:18:31] i don't think there's anything wrong
[1:18:33] with acting like our pastor
[1:18:35] in some aspect in some aspects i do
[1:18:40] same with me in some aspects that's good
[1:18:43] some aspects
[1:18:44] most aspects that's not good
[1:18:47] but the point i'm making here is why
[1:18:51] why do they imitate the pastor
[1:18:55] why do these churches take on one
[1:18:58] another's
[1:18:58] spirit instead of the holy spirit
[1:19:02] is because they're in a relationship and
[1:19:05] they're not in a marriage
[1:19:08] if they're in a marriage they if they're
[1:19:10] if you're in a marriage to christ the
[1:19:13] holy spirit
[1:19:14] you don't need your pastor's spirit
[1:19:18] but if you're not in a marriage and
[1:19:20] you're constantly searching for
[1:19:22] something you're going to imitate
[1:19:24] something that's before you
[1:19:26] the closest thing that you know maybe
[1:19:29] and that's not again that's not
[1:19:30] necessarily a bad thing
[1:19:32] that is not necessarily a bad thing but
[1:19:35] if you're
[1:19:36] if you've taken his spirit instead of
[1:19:39] the holy spirit
[1:19:41] you're wrong you've missed the point
[1:19:44] and that's what brother branham is
[1:19:45] saying here that that's what churches do
[1:19:48] churches do that they take on a man
[1:19:50] spirit a minister
[1:19:52] spirit because they failed to get the
[1:19:54] holy spirit
[1:19:56] they failed now look these people what
[1:19:59] if the pastor is holy
[1:20:01] nothing wrong with him act and holy what
[1:20:02] if he's sober what if he's
[1:20:05] grave what if he's all that all that
[1:20:07] list that we just went down
[1:20:08] what if he's all of those things and the
[1:20:10] church is acting just like that
[1:20:12] this is a good thing this is a good
[1:20:14] thing there's nothing wrong with that
[1:20:16] but it's not the point the point is to
[1:20:20] take the holy spirit
[1:20:22] the point is to get him and then you may
[1:20:26] or may not act like the pastor
[1:20:28] if the pastor has the holy spirit you'll
[1:20:29] probably act like him
[1:20:31] but you're not acting like him to act
[1:20:33] like him you're acting like him because
[1:20:34] that's what the holy spirit does
[1:20:37] does that make sense but brother brother
[1:20:40] branham is preaching
[1:20:41] choosing of a bride saints and listen to
[1:20:44] what he's
[1:20:45] talking about he's talking
[1:20:48] about people in a church who act like
[1:20:50] the pastor
[1:20:53] why is he telling us this is because
[1:20:56] they've missed the choosing of a bride
[1:20:59] they have missed the marriage that's why
[1:21:01] they're in this condition
[1:21:06] we don't want to be in that condition
[1:21:10] we want the holy spirit we want the word
[1:21:13] for ourselves
[1:21:14] we want our own relationship we want our
[1:21:17] own proposal
[1:21:18] we want our we want our own engagement
[1:21:20] and we want our own
[1:21:21] marriage
[1:21:26] we have to have that or we've missed the
[1:21:28] point because the point
[1:21:31] is to reproduce him
[1:21:35] not reproduce the pastor because
[1:21:37] eventually even if that pastor is right
[1:21:39] eventually he's going to fall because
[1:21:40] he's still in hybrid flesh
[1:21:42] just the same as me and you is going to
[1:21:44] fall because we're in hybrid flesh
[1:21:47] but if you take his spirit he's not
[1:21:50] going to fall
[1:21:54] you don't have to worry about watching
[1:21:56] the pastor or watching the minister
[1:21:58] or let's just watching your brother and
[1:22:00] sister
[1:22:04] it's not a relationship to where you
[1:22:06] compare yourself with one another as you
[1:22:08] compare yourself with him
[1:22:10] what good would it do for my wife to
[1:22:13] make everybody else happy if she doesn't
[1:22:14] make me happy
[1:22:15] what good would it do for me to make
[1:22:17] everybody else happy if i don't make my
[1:22:19] wife happy
[1:22:20] that's not the point that's not it's not
[1:22:23] that those relationships are nothing
[1:22:25] it's just that's not the point the point
[1:22:28] is the marriage
[1:22:30] and reproduction to reproduce
[1:22:34] christ and you can't do that with
[1:22:37] somebody else's spirit
[1:22:40] so check yourself what are you following
[1:22:43] what are you watching what are you
[1:22:44] guiding yourself by
[1:22:45] what are you looking for do you have
[1:22:47] your own relationship with him
[1:22:50] or is your relationship with him
[1:22:52] dictated by what a minister does
[1:22:54] what your brother and sister does
[1:22:59] just ask yourself that honest question
[1:23:06] he's preaching choosing of abroad and
[1:23:08] he's saying
[1:23:10] watch a pastor of a church usually the
[1:23:12] church will act like them
[1:23:14] because they've missed the choosing of
[1:23:16] the bride they've
[1:23:18] missed the marriage that's what he's
[1:23:20] trying to lay out here in simplicity
[1:23:23] we don't want that as a minister we
[1:23:25] don't want that
[1:23:26] i love the way my pastor preaches i tell
[1:23:28] him that all the time he don't believe
[1:23:30] me but i tell him that all the time
[1:23:32] but i don't want to mimic him and even
[1:23:35] if i do mimic him i'm not doing it on
[1:23:36] purpose
[1:23:38] i am who i am i'm comfortable with who i
[1:23:40] am but i've heard ministers
[1:23:41] i kid you not you can play one tape
[1:23:43] recorder and play the other tape
[1:23:44] recorder and you can't tell who's who
[1:23:46] because they just mimic each other they
[1:23:48] mimic it's
[1:23:50] it's repulsive it's repulsive
[1:23:54] but it's it's that bad they just mimic
[1:23:57] what the other one does
[1:23:59] and you cannot tell them apart why would
[1:24:02] god put
[1:24:03] two gifts the exact same on earth at the
[1:24:05] same time
[1:24:07] that's not of god there's different
[1:24:10] avenues that the spirit works through
[1:24:11] brother branham says he made you a
[1:24:14] specific way so you would
[1:24:15] ting a certain way
[1:24:18] why does why do you even want your team
[1:24:21] to match this thing
[1:24:23] that tells me that you're watching this
[1:24:25] thing and you're not watching the master
[1:24:26] team
[1:24:29] you're not watching the master if you're
[1:24:32] trying to imitate something else
[1:24:36] so even as minister ministries can do
[1:24:38] that
[1:24:39] churches as a whole can do that somebody
[1:24:42] over here will sing a song
[1:24:43] this church has got to sing the song
[1:24:50] why do we see those things saints
[1:24:53] and again they may be fine the song may
[1:24:55] be fun
[1:24:56] the ministry may be fine perfectly fine
[1:24:58] nothing wrong with it
[1:25:01] but that's not what god's after he's
[1:25:03] after the marriage to him
[1:25:05] he's after reproduction of him
[1:25:09] that's why we see those things we don't
[1:25:12] want that
[1:25:12] we want a marriage to him we want to be
[1:25:16] old enough and spiritually mature enough
[1:25:18] to move into a marriage with him
[1:25:24] praise the lord
[1:25:27] moving on
[1:25:30] this part will be a much more sweet in
[1:25:33] your mouth
[1:25:35] not better in your belly i'll have you
[1:25:38] jumping and shouting before i'm done
[1:25:43] he says i said i'd like to talk to you
[1:25:46] for a little bit continuing in this
[1:25:47] story and choosing
[1:25:48] abroad before we perform this wedding
[1:25:52] and there is no way i'm going to get
[1:25:54] through so i may stop after this and
[1:25:56] we'll see
[1:26:00] i'd like to talk to you a little bit
[1:26:01] before we perform this wedding and they
[1:26:03] sat down
[1:26:04] the boy kept looking around the room he
[1:26:06] needed a haircut real bad and he kept
[1:26:08] looking around the room he wasn't
[1:26:09] listening to me
[1:26:11] i said son i want you to listen to me he
[1:26:14] said yes sir now remember he's already
[1:26:15] asked the first question to her
[1:26:17] are you old enough to get married
[1:26:19] affirmative yes
[1:26:20] old enough to get married got my
[1:26:22] permission
[1:26:23] now look where he transitions to
[1:26:27] transitions to the man he says do you
[1:26:30] love this girl
[1:26:32] he said yes sir i do
[1:26:37] you say that's simple yep
[1:26:40] it is it's
[1:26:43] simple simple simple and there is the
[1:26:46] forest attorneys making
[1:26:48] millions of dollars because people can't
[1:26:50] even answer that simple question
[1:26:53] millions of dollars
[1:26:57] do you love this girl
[1:27:00] yes sir i do
[1:27:04] remember it's the preamble to the
[1:27:06] marriage this is one of the requirements
[1:27:10] do you love this girl
[1:27:15] so simple it is so simple it goes right
[1:27:19] over our heads
[1:27:21] do you love this girl
[1:27:24] yes sir i do
[1:27:29] in the church age book brother branham
[1:27:31] says and the lord god almighty says
[1:27:34] i know there he is standing in the midst
[1:27:38] of his people
[1:27:39] there he is the chief shepherd of the
[1:27:40] flock but does he hold back the
[1:27:42] persecution
[1:27:43] does he stem the tribulation no he does
[1:27:46] not
[1:27:47] he simply says i know
[1:27:50] i know your tribulation i am not at all
[1:27:53] unmindful of your suffering
[1:27:55] what a stumbling block this is to so
[1:27:58] many people
[1:28:00] like israel they wonder if god
[1:28:03] really loves them how can god be
[1:28:07] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:28:10] watches his people suffer
[1:28:12] you see they could not figure out god's
[1:28:15] love
[1:28:17] they thought that love meant no
[1:28:19] suffering
[1:28:20] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:28:22] parental care
[1:28:23] but god said that his love was elective
[1:28:27] love
[1:28:28] the proof of his love is election
[1:28:31] that no matter what happened his love
[1:28:34] was proven truly by the fact
[1:28:37] that they were chosen unto salvation
[1:28:42] son i want you to listen to what i'm
[1:28:45] saying
[1:28:47] i want to ask you a question
[1:28:50] do you love this girl
[1:28:56] i would venture to say that 99 of
[1:28:59] your mental and psychological battles
[1:29:01] could be answered and solved by this
[1:29:03] simple question and coming to the
[1:29:07] recognition that
[1:29:08] he has declared he loves you
[1:29:13] he's answered the question saints
[1:29:17] this is not just a combination of
[1:29:19] questions that the prophet came up with
[1:29:21] spur of the moment
[1:29:22] he's listing these questions and asking
[1:29:24] these questions because this is god's
[1:29:26] way
[1:29:26] this is god's pattern this is god's
[1:29:28] requirement this is what
[1:29:30] god himself has done he didn't go rob
[1:29:33] the cradle and steal
[1:29:34] some little girl that didn't have a
[1:29:35] choice that didn't know any better that
[1:29:37] was a pre-arranged marriage
[1:29:38] actually it was a pre-arranged marriage
[1:29:39] but she just didn't know it so praise
[1:29:41] the lord
[1:29:41] but he comes and he makes sure that this
[1:29:44] is a bribe that's old enough to know
[1:29:45] what she's doing
[1:29:46] to accept the marriage proposal first he
[1:29:49] makes sure of that first
[1:29:51] and then what does he do he declares his
[1:29:53] love for her
[1:29:54] because without the declaration of his
[1:29:56] love for her this
[1:29:57] marriage will fall apart it will never
[1:29:59] last she will never be confident she
[1:30:01] will never be able to move forward she
[1:30:03] will have anxiety and depression
[1:30:04] and be sleeping in church and everything
[1:30:06] else
[1:30:09] she will fall apart she has to know this
[1:30:12] this has to be answered first because it
[1:30:14] doesn't matter how much
[1:30:16] that woman loves that man if he does not
[1:30:18] love her first
[1:30:19] it's not going to move forward so he
[1:30:21] comes and he answers the question this
[1:30:23] is god's pattern
[1:30:25] this isn't just some story by the
[1:30:26] seventh vile angel and choosing
[1:30:28] a bride this is god's pattern this is
[1:30:30] what god has done himself
[1:30:33] he has come and he says yes i love that
[1:30:35] girl
[1:30:37] yes i love that girl and brother brandon
[1:30:39] says but people get so confused because
[1:30:41] they can't understand if he loved me he
[1:30:43] would keep everything away from me
[1:30:44] and no trials no persecution no nothing
[1:30:46] like that he says no that's
[1:30:48] not god's love see it doesn't matter how
[1:30:52] much you feel god loves you
[1:30:55] what matters is a vindicated messenger
[1:30:57] standing here and telling you
[1:30:59] what matters is if hagia says the king
[1:31:01] loves you
[1:31:02] because haggai knows eliezer knows
[1:31:06] and he says that's not how god expresses
[1:31:09] his love to you is by
[1:31:10] building a hedge about you and keeping
[1:31:12] everything away from you
[1:31:13] he says he expresses his love to you by
[1:31:16] saying that he loves you
[1:31:17] and if he has said that he loves you he
[1:31:19] loves you period
[1:31:20] it is non-negotiable because he said
[1:31:24] i have chosen you and his why would he
[1:31:27] choose you if he did not love you
[1:31:33] why there's no logical explanation why
[1:31:36] would he choose you
[1:31:37] if he does not love you by default the
[1:31:40] very fact that he chose you
[1:31:41] proves that he loves you now the next
[1:31:44] question is well how do i know that he
[1:31:45] chose me
[1:31:46] look at the billions of people on the
[1:31:48] face of this earth
[1:31:50] look at the number the small minority of
[1:31:52] them who have even had the privilege to
[1:31:54] hear what you have heard
[1:31:56] let alone out of that small minority
[1:31:59] what other small minority has said yes
[1:32:01] that is the truth and i love that
[1:32:04] how is it possible for you to do that if
[1:32:06] he has not
[1:32:07] chosen you first it is impossible it is
[1:32:10] not possible
[1:32:11] it it cannot happen
[1:32:16] do not discount the pure simplicity
[1:32:19] of the receptiveness of the gospel of
[1:32:22] jesus christ
[1:32:23] indicating your your marriage to him
[1:32:26] indicating your relationship to him
[1:32:29] indicating that he
[1:32:30] did love you indicating that he has
[1:32:34] chosen you
[1:32:36] that is the very basis and way that he
[1:32:40] expresses his love to you
[1:32:42] see you if you want all the flowery
[1:32:45] fillings and
[1:32:46] cloud9 fillings and whatever else that's
[1:32:49] fine
[1:32:50] you know i want more of those but that
[1:32:53] is
[1:32:54] not what my relationship is based off of
[1:32:56] my relationship is based off the fact
[1:32:58] that i
[1:32:59] have a pure understanding
[1:33:02] a proper understanding as the prophet
[1:33:05] said that
[1:33:06] god himself has chosen me and he loves
[1:33:09] me
[1:33:10] even when i fail him every day he loves
[1:33:14] me
[1:33:14] and i know that he loves me is because
[1:33:16] he has came by my way
[1:33:18] and he has whispered his love secrets
[1:33:20] and he has expressed himself to me
[1:33:22] and there is no other reason that he
[1:33:24] would express himself to me if he did
[1:33:26] not love me
[1:33:30] it is that simple don't discount it
[1:33:34] don't get confused in your mind because
[1:33:36] when you get confused in your mind about
[1:33:38] whether he loves you or not
[1:33:39] you will automatically start operating
[1:33:41] in a in a realm of
[1:33:43] fear and then you fall back on your plan
[1:33:47] and your works program let me know how
[1:33:49] that works out for you
[1:33:51] it'll bring more anxiety more depression
[1:33:55] more xanax that's what that will lead to
[1:33:59] but if you can simply come before him
[1:34:02] with a clear conscience and a clear
[1:34:05] accept
[1:34:06] acceptance that he
[1:34:09] loves me because he has
[1:34:12] told me he loves me you say well i've
[1:34:14] never heard an audible voice that he
[1:34:16] came down and says i love you
[1:34:18] listen to a tape
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:22] you want an audible voice there's your
[1:34:24] audible voice listen to a tape
[1:34:27] and when he comes and he says good
[1:34:29] evening friends and something of you
[1:34:31] goes
[1:34:34] tell me more that's him telling you
[1:34:37] that he loves you because it's
[1:34:40] impossible
[1:34:41] for you to have that reaction unless he
[1:34:44] first loved you and chose you
[1:34:46] it's impossible many people may try to
[1:34:49] fake it many people may get the
[1:34:51] intellectual conception of it but i'm
[1:34:53] talking about a true marriage
[1:34:55] i'm talking about a true love for that
[1:34:56] word that when it cuts
[1:34:58] when it comes and it cuts and it slices
[1:35:01] and it dices
[1:35:02] and it strips you down raw
[1:35:05] you'll still come back to it and say
[1:35:08] give me more
[1:35:09] tell me more tell me that you love me
[1:35:18] think not it's strange when you fall
[1:35:21] into these fiery trials
[1:35:25] as many as i love i rebuke and i chase
[1:35:28] him
[1:35:32] the proof of his love is election
[1:35:36] election to what election to reproduce
[1:35:40] the son of man again
[1:35:44] he says god's love was elective love the
[1:35:46] proof of his love was election
[1:35:48] that no matter what happened listen now
[1:35:50] listen
[1:35:51] no matter what happened his love
[1:35:54] was proven truly by the fact that they
[1:35:59] were
[1:35:59] chosen unto salvation
[1:36:04] you say well i don't know if i'm chosen
[1:36:06] under salvation what
[1:36:08] is salvation saints it's the word
[1:36:12] you are saved by the word by
[1:36:16] by the word you are saved i'm going to
[1:36:18] try to think of other ways to say it but
[1:36:20] you you understand it's that simple
[1:36:24] salvation by the word and if
[1:36:27] god has chosen
[1:36:30] to bring his word by your way
[1:36:33] so that you could respond and and given
[1:36:36] you something that you could respond
[1:36:38] appropriately what does that by default
[1:36:41] mean
[1:36:43] he has elected you to salvation
[1:36:48] because he loves you
[1:36:55] son i want you to listen to what i'm
[1:36:57] about to say
[1:36:59] i got some questions to ask you do you
[1:37:02] love
[1:37:02] this woman yes i love her
[1:37:07] yes i love her see he had to answer the
[1:37:09] question first
[1:37:11] he had to answer the question first
[1:37:15] continuing very common but i'm going to
[1:37:16] read it just because i love to read it
[1:37:18] and i could preach it every time that i
[1:37:19] preach but he says the cloudy skies
[1:37:21] and storms of life are no signs of god's
[1:37:23] disapproval neither are they or the
[1:37:24] bright skies and still water signs of
[1:37:26] his love and approval
[1:37:28] his approval of any of us is only in
[1:37:31] the be loved
[1:37:36] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:37:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:41] does he love us
[1:37:45] all yes but how shall we know
[1:37:51] we we shall know
[1:37:54] because he said so
[1:37:58] you say well i just can't make it that
[1:38:01] simple i've got to feel something i got
[1:38:02] to have a sign up
[1:38:03] you'll never it'll never work saints
[1:38:06] it'll never work if
[1:38:07] my wife discerned whether i loved her or
[1:38:12] not by my actions
[1:38:14] and by everything i said and did
[1:38:18] she would be extremely confused
[1:38:22] i would be confused but she
[1:38:27] has to have you're
[1:38:30] you're all his wife's the same i'm just
[1:38:32] saying me whatever
[1:38:34] they have to know at the end of the day
[1:38:38] he loves me because he said he loved me
[1:38:42] period whether he proves it or not now
[1:38:44] obviously if he does love you
[1:38:46] he'll prove that he loves you obviously
[1:38:48] if you love him you'll prove that you
[1:38:49] love him
[1:38:50] but christ loves you
[1:38:54] and the proof of that is because he said
[1:38:57] so
[1:38:58] if you cannot rest on that you were
[1:39:01] going to be a miserable person
[1:39:03] you were going to be up and down up and
[1:39:05] down shirts to church
[1:39:06] pillar to post doctrine to doctrine
[1:39:08] message to message
[1:39:10] whatever you are never going to be
[1:39:13] established
[1:39:14] never you have to have that
[1:39:16] understanding he
[1:39:17] loves me because he said so
[1:39:24] and manifested there's two parts to it
[1:39:28] and manifested that he did
[1:39:31] love us for he brought us to himself
[1:39:36] remember we're we're gentiles not
[1:39:40] jews brought us to himself
[1:39:44] what is himself the word
[1:39:48] the message
[1:39:52] that's why i have a problem when
[1:39:53] somebody tries to make the bible and the
[1:39:54] message two different things
[1:39:56] because i'm not a polygamist i did not
[1:39:58] marry two people
[1:40:00] i married him the word the message
[1:40:05] he manifested that he did love us for he
[1:40:09] brought himself to us
[1:40:12] and gave us of his spirit placing us as
[1:40:15] sons
[1:40:18] how do you know because he said so and
[1:40:22] he brought the message your way
[1:40:24] let it be as simple as it can be and
[1:40:28] don't even
[1:40:28] come to me with you don't know my past
[1:40:31] because
[1:40:32] i don't care about your past did he tell
[1:40:35] you he loved you
[1:40:37] and did he bring the message your way
[1:40:40] who am i to say you're not hiss
[1:40:45] who am i to try to put you in or out who
[1:40:48] is another minister to try to put you in
[1:40:50] and out
[1:40:52] does he love you and did he bring the
[1:40:56] message your way
[1:40:58] and do you love him did you love it when
[1:41:00] he passed by your way
[1:41:04] i don't care about your past i don't
[1:41:06] care about the mistakes
[1:41:08] i don't i don't care about the bad
[1:41:10] decisions
[1:41:12] but what i assure you is the devil does
[1:41:17] the devil does and he'll remind you
[1:41:20] about them every day
[1:41:21] because what's he want to do he wants to
[1:41:24] cause the marriage to fail
[1:41:25] because if the marriage fails there's no
[1:41:27] reproduction and if there's no
[1:41:29] reproduction he can be a squatter
[1:41:31] and if he can be a squatter he can just
[1:41:32] keep this running on and running on and
[1:41:34] running on and running on
[1:41:38] but if the marriage is true because
[1:41:41] there's a proper understanding that he
[1:41:42] does love me
[1:41:44] reproduction takes place and now your
[1:41:48] life
[1:41:48] will draw somebody else to him and
[1:41:51] there's reproduction that takes place
[1:41:53] and now that person's life will walk
[1:41:55] through walmart one day and somebody
[1:41:57] will go
[1:41:58] that's different in a good way
[1:42:01] and they say maybe i want to be like
[1:42:03] that there's something
[1:42:04] there's something drawing me to that or
[1:42:07] somebody will go to work one day
[1:42:10] and a conversation will come up and he
[1:42:12] will express himself
[1:42:14] and now that person says i kind of like
[1:42:17] that
[1:42:18] that sounds good tell me more and
[1:42:20] reproduction takes place
[1:42:22] and then eventually one day the last one
[1:42:24] will be reproduced
[1:42:26] and the squatter will get kicked out
[1:42:28] because he's no longer the accuser of
[1:42:29] the brother
[1:42:30] he has nothing to accuse he loses his
[1:42:32] position and we
[1:42:34] go live on a cloud happily ever after
[1:42:38] praise the lord but the devil don't want
[1:42:42] you to come into a marriage that's why
[1:42:43] he will tell you constantly that he
[1:42:45] doesn't love you
[1:42:46] because if he did love you you sure you
[1:42:48] certainly wouldn't have just did what
[1:42:49] you did
[1:42:54] let it be as simple as the angel made it
[1:42:58] because if you don't if you
[1:43:01] don't you better get by some xanax
[1:43:04] because you're going to need it
[1:43:06] you will be mentally and spiritually
[1:43:08] tore up the rest of your life
[1:43:10] you will never farther yourself in the
[1:43:12] gospel you will never father yourself
[1:43:14] into reproducing the son of man again
[1:43:16] so that the son of man can reproduce
[1:43:18] himself and somebody else again
[1:43:20] you will never come to the point of the
[1:43:22] marriage you have to allow it to be
[1:43:25] that simple he loves me because he said
[1:43:28] so
[1:43:30] and he manifested it by bringing himself
[1:43:34] the word the message by my way
[1:43:37] and i accepted it let it be that simple
[1:43:42] i'm going to go through some scriptures
[1:43:43] real quick don't try to turn you can
[1:43:45] just listen
[1:43:46] second thessalonians if i can find my
[1:43:50] place
[1:43:55] second thessalonians 3 13 but we are
[1:43:57] bound to give thanks always to god for
[1:44:00] you
[1:44:00] brethren be loved of the lord because
[1:44:03] god hath from the beginning
[1:44:04] chosen you to salvation
[1:44:08] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:44:10] belief of the truth
[1:44:12] now read that verse with the proper
[1:44:14] understanding of what the prophet said
[1:44:18] this verse is the very indication and
[1:44:20] confirmation that he does love
[1:44:22] me because he chose me
[1:44:25] from the beginning through salvation
[1:44:29] sanctification of his spirit and belief
[1:44:34] of the truth if
[1:44:37] if you believe the truth god loves you
[1:44:42] sorry it took me a while to say that one
[1:44:44] as well
[1:44:47] don't let it be more complicated than
[1:44:49] what laodicea
[1:44:50] that's what laodicea wants it to be
[1:44:55] let it be as simple as he made it
[1:44:58] where until he called you by our gospel
[1:45:01] to the obtaining
[1:45:02] of the glory of the lord jesus christ
[1:45:03] therefore brethren stand fast and hold
[1:45:06] the traditions which ye have been taught
[1:45:08] whether by word or by epistle now our
[1:45:10] lord jesus christ himself and god
[1:45:12] even our father which hath loved us
[1:45:16] and hath given us everlasting
[1:45:18] consolation and good hope
[1:45:20] through grace comfort your hearts and
[1:45:23] establish you in
[1:45:24] every good word and work
[1:45:28] second peter 1 verse 10 there wherefore
[1:45:31] the rather brethren
[1:45:32] giving diligence to make your calling an
[1:45:35] election sure
[1:45:37] for if you do these things you shall
[1:45:39] never
[1:45:40] fall same thing that i just said
[1:45:43] i was quoting peter and you didn't know
[1:45:45] it
[1:45:46] make your calling and election sure
[1:45:50] because if you do that you will never
[1:45:52] fall
[1:45:53] if you have a proper revelation that god
[1:45:56] truly loves you
[1:45:57] how are you going to fall you can't
[1:46:00] that's what peter's saying but peter is
[1:46:02] saying you better make that sure because
[1:46:04] if you don't
[1:46:06] you're going to fall
[1:46:10] for sow entrance shall be ministered
[1:46:12] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:46:14] kingdom
[1:46:15] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:46:18] wherefore
[1:46:19] i will not be negligent to put you
[1:46:22] always in remembrance of these things
[1:46:24] though ye know them and be established
[1:46:27] in the present truth
[1:46:29] first john 4 16 and we have known and
[1:46:32] believed
[1:46:33] the love that god hath to us god
[1:46:37] is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:46:39] dwelleth in god
[1:46:41] and god in him herein is our love made
[1:46:45] perfect
[1:46:45] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:46:47] judgment because as he
[1:46:49] is so are we in this world
[1:46:52] there is no fear in love
[1:46:56] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:46:59] because
[1:46:59] fear hath torment he that feareth is
[1:47:03] not made perfect in love
[1:47:06] verse 19 is the key we
[1:47:09] love him because he first
[1:47:14] loved us
[1:47:18] make that sure get a proper
[1:47:22] understanding of that
[1:47:24] and i assure you you will move forward
[1:47:26] in the marriage
[1:47:28] with no hiccups
[1:47:31] can i go a little farther i knew you
[1:47:33] would say yes that's why i asked
[1:47:38] that is then the first question
[1:47:41] that has to be answered by the male
[1:47:43] party the bridegroom
[1:47:45] do you love this girl because obviously
[1:47:47] if he tells brother branham
[1:47:49] no we're done here we're not moving
[1:47:52] forward with the wedding
[1:47:54] obviously if christ says no we're done
[1:47:57] you're not moving forward in a wedding
[1:48:00] there are people that that applies to
[1:48:02] jacob have i loved esau have i hated i'm
[1:48:05] not going to go down that avenue
[1:48:07] but just be thankful that you're jacob
[1:48:09] and not esau
[1:48:11] but if god declares his love for you
[1:48:16] that moves us to the next step because
[1:48:19] brother random turns to the lady
[1:48:21] and he says i said to her
[1:48:24] do you love him
[1:48:29] now this is the question this is the
[1:48:32] question we have to answer
[1:48:34] because he's already declared his love
[1:48:36] for us
[1:48:37] how he told us he loved us
[1:48:41] and he brought himself the word the
[1:48:43] message by our way
[1:48:46] he declared his love for us
[1:48:50] but he turns to her and he says do you
[1:48:52] love him
[1:48:55] she said yes sir i do john 14 15.
[1:49:00] if ye love me keep my commandments
[1:49:06] so if you don't keep his commandments
[1:49:09] also known as the word don't try to tell
[1:49:13] me you love him
[1:49:14] i'm not talking about mistakes bad
[1:49:17] decisions
[1:49:18] i'm talking about a desire from your
[1:49:21] heart
[1:49:21] of hearts to keep the word and anytime
[1:49:23] you don't you repent and line back up
[1:49:25] with the word
[1:49:26] that's what i'm talking about see that
[1:49:28] spirit comes right back in immediately
[1:49:30] after i just got spending 30 minutes
[1:49:33] talking about it
[1:49:35] it'll come right back saints and it'll
[1:49:36] come back here in five minutes
[1:49:38] and it'll come back when you walk out
[1:49:39] the doors and it'll come back out
[1:49:41] tuesday wednesday third it will always
[1:49:43] come back
[1:49:44] because he's the author of confusion and
[1:49:46] he knows if he can cause confusion
[1:49:49] there'll be no reproduction that's why
[1:49:51] brother brandon would tell the story
[1:49:52] about women that can't have babies he
[1:49:54] says go adopts it takes all the pressure
[1:49:55] off of them they're not confused they're
[1:49:57] just relaxed and then they conceive
[1:50:00] that's in the natural don't tell me the
[1:50:02] same thing don't apply to the spiritual
[1:50:04] if you will relax spiritually
[1:50:07] in your knowledge and revelation that he
[1:50:09] loves me
[1:50:12] reproduction can take place but if you
[1:50:14] never get past that there's not going to
[1:50:16] be any reproduction take place
[1:50:17] the son of man will never be
[1:50:18] demonstrated again
[1:50:21] if you love me keep my commandments
[1:50:26] what's his commandments acts 2 38 repent
[1:50:31] repent be baptized
[1:50:34] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:50:36] ye shall receive
[1:50:38] him you shall receive the baptism of the
[1:50:41] holy spirit
[1:50:42] you shall receive the word for your day
[1:50:45] repent be baptized
[1:50:49] don't try to go into the marriage if you
[1:50:51] haven't repented or been baptized
[1:50:53] it's not going to work come god's
[1:50:56] provided way
[1:50:57] if ye love me keep my commandments
[1:51:02] you say well i do love him i've repented
[1:51:04] i've given my heart to him
[1:51:06] i've you know i've surrendered and okay
[1:51:08] have you taken his name in baptism
[1:51:11] well is that required if you love me
[1:51:14] you'll keep my commandments
[1:51:17] it really is that simple
[1:51:23] brother brandon says he gave three
[1:51:25] ordinances to the church when he left
[1:51:28] water baptism communion
[1:51:32] and foot washing you say well i've been
[1:51:34] baptized
[1:51:35] with that whole communion and foot
[1:51:36] washing things that's spiritual christ
[1:51:37] has come
[1:51:39] yes he did come spiritually
[1:51:44] but if you want to know whether it's
[1:51:46] still natural or not
[1:51:48] take off your shoes go kick your coffee
[1:51:50] table as hard as you can
[1:51:52] and then tell me how everything's
[1:51:53] spiritual
[1:51:56] it's not all spiritual it's not all
[1:52:00] spiritual
[1:52:02] there is a spiritual application
[1:52:03] absolutely
[1:52:05] but these are ordinances he left to the
[1:52:08] church until he comes naturally
[1:52:10] we will naturally meet him in the air
[1:52:12] but until then
[1:52:13] he says continue in these things until
[1:52:15] that time period
[1:52:17] water baptism communion and foot washing
[1:52:21] there's so many people trying to tell me
[1:52:23] that they're that they're going to the
[1:52:24] marriage supper of the lamb and they
[1:52:26] just want the marriage supper of the
[1:52:27] lamb
[1:52:28] and they won't even eat the marriage
[1:52:29] supper they land with the brother and
[1:52:31] sister
[1:52:33] they want to wash the feet of the
[1:52:34] bridegroom they want to wash the feet of
[1:52:36] the lamb they can't wait to get over
[1:52:37] there and
[1:52:37] worship him and wash his feet but they
[1:52:40] won't wash his feet
[1:52:47] getting ahead getting ahead getting
[1:52:50] ahead
[1:52:51] is there a spiritual application
[1:52:53] absolutely
[1:52:55] but don't go getting so spiritually
[1:52:57] minded you're no earthly good and don't
[1:52:59] go getting ahead of the timeline because
[1:53:02] until you can kick that coffee table and
[1:53:03] it doesn't hurt your foot
[1:53:05] you're still natural and you still need
[1:53:08] water baptism to be instituted into the
[1:53:10] church
[1:53:11] you still need communion naturally and
[1:53:13] you still need to take
[1:53:15] foot washing naturally that's god's
[1:53:17] ordinances
[1:53:18] when our atoms change then so be it but
[1:53:21] until then
[1:53:23] if you love me keep my commandments
[1:53:27] first john 2 15 love not the world
[1:53:30] neither the things that are in the world
[1:53:33] if any man love the world the love of
[1:53:34] the father is not in him
[1:53:38] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:53:39] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[1:53:41] the pride of life is not of the father
[1:53:43] but is of the world what is his
[1:53:46] commandment
[1:53:47] don't love the things of the world if
[1:53:49] you love him you won't love the things
[1:53:50] of the world
[1:53:53] obviously we could spend hours talking
[1:53:55] about the things of the world and what
[1:53:56] you should and shouldn't love
[1:53:58] but i'll just say get in a relationship
[1:54:02] get in a relationship
[1:54:06] and remember what the point is the point
[1:54:10] is redemption the point is spiritual
[1:54:13] multiplication
[1:54:16] the point is to bring forth the son of
[1:54:18] man again
[1:54:22] when you dress yourself the point is to
[1:54:24] reproduce the son of man again
[1:54:30] when you're ruling your wife man
[1:54:33] the point is to reproduce the son of man
[1:54:35] again
[1:54:38] the point is not to wear the long skirt
[1:54:40] to say i wear a long skirt because the
[1:54:42] scripture says to wear the long skirt
[1:54:44] this the point is to reproduce the son
[1:54:46] of man again
[1:54:49] understand the point
[1:54:52] is to be the head of your house
[1:54:55] so that you don't make christ a
[1:54:57] wishy-washy man
[1:55:01] the point is to be the head of your
[1:55:03] house
[1:55:04] and to rule to govern to lead to god
[1:55:07] your wife as christ
[1:55:08] as the church so that
[1:55:12] christ is reproduced again so that
[1:55:15] somebody can see that
[1:55:17] who is a child of god and come to life
[1:55:20] that's the point the point is not to
[1:55:23] obey the rules for the sake of obeying
[1:55:25] the rules so that you don't go to hell
[1:55:28] that's good i don't want to go to hell
[1:55:30] either but that's not the point
[1:55:33] the point is to reproduce the son of man
[1:55:35] again
[1:55:37] a relationship a marriage
[1:55:42] not to be flirting with the world
[1:55:47] first john 4 20 if a man say i love god
[1:55:49] and hateth his brother he is a liar
[1:55:52] for he that loveth not his brother who
[1:55:54] he hath seen
[1:55:56] how can he love god whom he hath not
[1:55:58] seen
[1:56:01] that's so simple i don't even think i
[1:56:02] need to expound on it
[1:56:05] but i want to continue now that
[1:56:08] excerpt i'm saying that correctly that i
[1:56:10] was reading in the church age book about
[1:56:11] god's love
[1:56:13] because he reads that paragraph he or he
[1:56:16] says that paragraph
[1:56:17] about god's love being elective
[1:56:20] and how that we know that he loves us
[1:56:23] but then he asks a question
[1:56:26] how shall i prove my love to him
[1:56:30] remember that's the portion that we're
[1:56:32] in now brother branham has asked this
[1:56:34] girl
[1:56:34] do you love him brother branham is
[1:56:37] asking the same question in the church
[1:56:39] age book
[1:56:40] coincidental i know how
[1:56:43] shall i prove my love to him
[1:56:47] by believing what he said
[1:56:52] and by conducting myself with joy
[1:56:55] admits the trials that he in his wisdom
[1:56:58] allows to come to pass
[1:57:03] it is so simple it's shocking
[1:57:06] but why do we have so many works program
[1:57:10] if we had a proper understanding of this
[1:57:13] why are we so
[1:57:14] bothered in our mind whether we're
[1:57:15] really in love with him
[1:57:18] if we're doing this let it be as simple
[1:57:21] as the prophet made it
[1:57:23] how shall i prove my love to him
[1:57:27] two things he only gives us two things
[1:57:31] why do we want to make it more than two
[1:57:34] believe what he said
[1:57:38] believe what he said
[1:57:42] believe first and foremost what he said
[1:57:44] about you
[1:57:46] and then worry about believing the other
[1:57:48] things but just believe what he said
[1:57:50] about you
[1:57:52] and conduct yourself with
[1:57:55] joy amongst the trials
[1:57:58] that he allows to come your way
[1:58:02] that's how you prove your love to him
[1:58:05] because
[1:58:06] if you don't conduct yourself with joy
[1:58:09] amongst the trials that means you think
[1:58:12] the trial has come
[1:58:14] by a power of somebody else but him
[1:58:18] you think this is something the devil
[1:58:22] can do the devil has done
[1:58:25] the devil was as brother and said is
[1:58:28] punishing me
[1:58:29] god is punishing me because of this bad
[1:58:31] decision that i made
[1:58:32] if he is he'll let you know you made a
[1:58:35] bad decision
[1:58:36] this is what's coming down the pipe grin
[1:58:39] and merit
[1:58:40] but don't spend each and every day
[1:58:43] wondering that every bad thing that
[1:58:45] comes your way if it's god punishing you
[1:58:48] what purpose does god have to punish his
[1:58:51] children
[1:58:51] if he doesn't tell them why he's
[1:58:53] punishing them his purpose is not to
[1:58:55] punish we've been through this we know
[1:58:57] this
[1:58:57] his purpose is not to punish his
[1:58:59] children because he enjoys it
[1:59:01] the purpose is reconciliation so it
[1:59:03] totally defeats god's purpose
[1:59:05] to allow a trial or a tribulation or
[1:59:07] something negative to come your way
[1:59:11] just because he felt like it
[1:59:14] no the purpose is either to bring
[1:59:16] correction and he'll tell you how to
[1:59:18] correct it
[1:59:19] or the purpose is to express himself
[1:59:22] through something
[1:59:25] count it all joy when you fall amongst
[1:59:28] diverse trials diverse temptations
[1:59:31] why because he loves me
[1:59:34] he said he loves me he brought his word
[1:59:36] my way and now i am entering
[1:59:38] such a point in this relationship that i
[1:59:41] can literally flesh out the son of man
[1:59:43] again in this situation
[1:59:46] that's the purpose how would god ever
[1:59:49] express himself thoroughly if everything
[1:59:52] that happened to a believer was good
[1:59:56] he can't and remember what is the point
[2:00:01] the point is to express himself
[2:00:04] so that we would know him to re
[2:00:07] to manifest himself through somebody
[2:00:09] with preeminence
[2:00:10] and to restore fallen eden this is the
[2:00:14] channel that he goes through
[2:00:15] that's why he says conduct yourself with
[2:00:18] joy amongst those because if you don't
[2:00:21] conduct yourself among with joy amongst
[2:00:23] the trials that
[2:00:24] he sees fit to bring your way
[2:00:28] what attraction are you going to have to
[2:00:29] somebody
[2:00:31] you're just going to be like the rest of
[2:00:32] the world a trial comes your way and you
[2:00:34] fall to pieces
[2:00:36] that's what the rest of the world does
[2:00:39] how is there going to be reproduction
[2:00:40] take place there can't be
[2:00:42] because you're just reproducing the
[2:00:43] world that's why he makes it that simple
[2:00:49] conduct yourself with joy amongst the
[2:00:51] trials that he
[2:00:52] sees fit to bring your way remember in
[2:00:55] the book of revelation who's setting on
[2:00:57] the throne
[2:00:58] and who's calling the shots you can
[2:01:00] touch this you can touch that you can do
[2:01:02] this
[2:01:03] you can do that oh by the way don't
[2:01:04] touch the oil in the wine
[2:01:07] remember who's calling the shots each
[2:01:09] and every day
[2:01:11] period the lamb is on the throne
[2:01:15] and if you are his he's calling the
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:20] shots
[2:01:23] i'm going to do one more and then we'll
[2:01:25] close i promise
[2:01:31] he turns back to the man and he says now
[2:01:34] have you got a place to take her after
[2:01:35] you marry her
[2:01:40] he said yes sir
[2:01:43] i don't think i'm going to preach on
[2:01:44] that in the natural realm
[2:01:48] i'll just say that anybody that didn't
[2:01:51] i'm sure you realize that was a mistake
[2:01:55] there's a reason the scripture says
[2:01:57] he'll leave father and mother cleave to
[2:01:58] his wife and
[2:02:00] go on about their merry way two heads in
[2:02:03] the same house will not work
[2:02:05] it's not godly it'll never work and
[2:02:07] that's pretty much about all i'm going
[2:02:08] to say
[2:02:09] i'm sure anybody that's been there
[2:02:10] realizes that
[2:02:15] he says do you have a place to take her
[2:02:18] after you marry her
[2:02:20] remember this is a question for the
[2:02:21] bridegroom
[2:02:24] praise the lord let not your hearts be
[2:02:28] troubled
[2:02:29] ye believe in god believe also in me
[2:02:33] in my father's house there are many
[2:02:35] mansions
[2:02:37] if it were not so i would have told you
[2:02:40] so
[2:02:41] i go and prepare a place for you
[2:02:46] that's what christ did in his marriage
[2:02:48] don't think a natural marriage is going
[2:02:50] to bypass that
[2:02:52] if you don't have a place to take her
[2:02:54] you're out of the program you're out of
[2:02:55] the pattern it's not going to work
[2:03:00] if i go and prepare a place for you i
[2:03:02] will come again
[2:03:03] and receive you unto myself that where i
[2:03:06] am there ye may be also
[2:03:10] what are we talking about saints we're
[2:03:11] talking about the prerequisites to the
[2:03:13] marriage
[2:03:14] see there's things we have to meet and
[2:03:17] there's things he has to meet
[2:03:21] second corinthians 6 14 be not unequally
[2:03:23] yoked together with unbelievers as the
[2:03:25] musicians come
[2:03:27] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[2:03:29] with unrighteousness and what communion
[2:03:30] hath light with darkness
[2:03:32] and what concord hath christ with baal
[2:03:36] i don't think i'm saying that right
[2:03:38] belial maybe
[2:03:40] or what part hath he that believeth with
[2:03:43] an infidel
[2:03:44] and what agreement hath the temple of
[2:03:46] god with idols
[2:03:48] for ye are the temples of the living god
[2:03:49] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[2:03:51] and walk in them and i will be their god
[2:03:53] and they shall be my people
[2:03:55] wherefore come
[2:03:58] out from among them does he have some
[2:04:02] place to take
[2:04:02] us saints oh yes come out from among
[2:04:06] them
[2:04:07] and be you separate saith the lord what
[2:04:09] is this talking about
[2:04:10] why is he saying come out from among
[2:04:12] them because there's a marriage going to
[2:04:14] take place
[2:04:15] and he's got somewhere to take you come
[2:04:18] out from among them and be ye separate
[2:04:20] saith the lord and touch not the unclean
[2:04:22] thing
[2:04:22] and i will receive you and will be a
[2:04:25] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[2:04:27] and daughters saith the lord almighty
[2:04:30] revelation 18 4 and i heard another
[2:04:32] voice from heaven saying
[2:04:34] come out of her my people that ye be not
[2:04:38] partakers of her sins and that you
[2:04:40] receive
[2:04:41] not her plagues revelations 4 1
[2:04:44] after this i looked and behold a door
[2:04:46] was opened in heaven
[2:04:48] why is there a door opened in heaven
[2:04:49] because he's got someplace to take you
[2:04:55] he didn't leave you in the load of cnh
[2:04:57] he had some place to take you
[2:05:00] he didn't leave you in a condition of
[2:05:02] not needing nothing
[2:05:03] he had some place to take you to where
[2:05:05] you realized you need everything
[2:05:08] i have nothing
[2:05:11] a door was opened in heaven and the
[2:05:13] first voice which i heard was
[2:05:15] as it were a trumpet talking with me
[2:05:17] which said
[2:05:18] come up hither does he have some place
[2:05:22] to take you
[2:05:23] yes he's got some place to take you and
[2:05:25] brother branham says the scene changed
[2:05:27] from earthly things to heavenly things
[2:05:30] where does he want to take you to
[2:05:32] heavenly things
[2:05:34] through an open door out of a laodicean
[2:05:37] condition
[2:05:39] come up hither and i will show you these
[2:05:42] things which must be hereafter
[2:05:44] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[2:05:46] behold a throne was set in heaven
[2:05:48] and one sat on the throne why is he
[2:05:52] taking you to heavenly places
[2:05:54] so that you can see him sitting on the
[2:05:56] throne
[2:05:58] it's not a marble throne saints i will
[2:06:00] say this it's not just a marble throne
[2:06:03] there may be a marvel throne i don't
[2:06:04] know i'll tell you when i get there
[2:06:06] but the throne is your heart saints
[2:06:09] where does he want to take you
[2:06:13] to a position to where you can see
[2:06:16] the lamb is on the throne and he is the
[2:06:19] only one that i'm concerned about
[2:06:23] does he have some place to take you
[2:06:26] he's got some place to take us let us
[2:06:28] all stand i'm just going to have to stop
[2:06:30] because there's no ending point and i'm
[2:06:31] not going to get done
[2:06:32] and i'm going to run a wedding and then
[2:06:34] there will be no preamble to the wedding
[2:06:36] and i'll get fired and all that other
[2:06:39] good stuff
[2:06:40] so we're just going to stop but i want
[2:06:43] you to think as we just bow our heads
[2:06:45] together and our pastor would come
[2:06:47] i just want to think solemnly sincerely
[2:06:54] we claim we're the bride of jesus christ
[2:06:57] and no doubt we are
[2:07:00] we profess that we have went into an
[2:07:02] invisible union
[2:07:04] and no doubt we have the bridegroom has
[2:07:08] present
[2:07:09] it's undisputed we acknowledge that
[2:07:13] we recognize that he is here the
[2:07:16] revealed word
[2:07:19] we make these proclamations we
[2:07:22] we say and declare who we are in the
[2:07:26] position that we're in
[2:07:29] but does what we say and what we live
[2:07:33] does it meet the prerequisites to the
[2:07:38] marriage did we
[2:07:40] meet the prerequisite to actually be in
[2:07:43] the marriage or are we just saying we're
[2:07:45] in a marriage
[2:07:47] sincerely examine yourself
[2:07:53] we don't want to end up at the at the
[2:07:55] end of the road
[2:07:58] thinking that we had married christ
[2:08:02] when we really didn't because we weren't
[2:08:05] spiritually mature enough to be
[2:08:07] engaged into a marriage we didn't have
[2:08:10] our written permission
[2:08:12] of fulfilling and doing
[2:08:17] the portions of the word that he told us
[2:08:20] we were
[2:08:20] obligated to do before he married us
[2:08:23] we don't want to bypass that and think
[2:08:26] we're married
[2:08:27] when we haven't met the conditions
[2:08:31] we want to accept the fact that we are
[2:08:36] his
[2:08:37] and his beloved simply
[2:08:41] based on his statement
[2:08:44] that he has declared i love you
[2:08:48] i have brought myself my word
[2:08:52] by your way as a token to prove my love
[2:08:56] to you
[2:08:57] accept that for what it is accept the
[2:09:00] fact
[2:09:01] that we have to express our love back to
[2:09:03] him
[2:09:04] by obeying that word and by conducting
[2:09:08] ourself
[2:09:09] not as the rest of the world when trials
[2:09:11] and tribulations come
[2:09:12] but conducting ourselves with a
[2:09:14] steadfastness
[2:09:16] and an assurance and a settledness and
[2:09:19] with
[2:09:19] joy amongst the chaos and the trials
[2:09:22] that come our way
[2:09:24] with the proper revelation that the lamb
[2:09:26] is on
[2:09:27] the throne and he is in control of my
[2:09:30] life
[2:09:32] let us rest assuredly and have joy in
[2:09:35] knowing and
[2:09:38] know truly that he will not just desert
[2:09:41] me
[2:09:42] he's got someplace for me he has went
[2:09:46] and prepared a place for me
[2:09:48] he has prepared a a
[2:09:51] he has opened the door to the spiritual
[2:09:53] realm for me to come through
[2:09:56] there will be a natural house for me no
[2:09:58] doubt there will be
[2:10:00] when our atoms change but now he has
[2:10:03] prepared a place for us
[2:10:04] out of laodicea through an open door
[2:10:07] in heavenly places with christ jesus to
[2:10:10] recognize
[2:10:11] he is one on the throne of my life
[2:10:15] can we truly follow that pattern
[2:10:19] can we truly go through the filter of
[2:10:21] the word
[2:10:22] can we meet these prerequisites to the
[2:10:25] marriage that's to take place
[2:10:28] i pray that we can and i pray that we're
[2:10:30] not just saying something because it's a
[2:10:32] cliche
[2:10:33] or because it's what we think but we
[2:10:35] genuinely know where we stand
[2:10:39] you examine yourself as i examine myself
[2:10:43] because we want to make sure that at the
[2:10:46] end of this
[2:10:48] somebody can't come along and say no
[2:10:50] that was not a good marriage
[2:10:53] there was not conditions met that have
[2:10:55] to be met we
[2:10:56] don't want that we want to be sober we
[2:10:58] want to be
[2:11:00] grave we want to be
[2:11:03] steadfast in our belief let's pray
[2:11:06] together

[2:11:14] people for their attentiveness lord

[2:11:19] these things that were said

[2:11:24] to

[2:11:27] applied

[2:11:36] each of our
[2:11:37] relationships with you lord
[2:11:40] and i pray that you would just take this
[2:11:42] word that's been spoken
[2:11:43] in such simplicity by your prophet
[2:11:47] so simple breaking it down
[2:11:50] to where we would not miss it lord of
[2:11:53] what has to take place
[2:11:55] lord and i pray that you would allow us
[2:11:58] with a clear conscience and a sober mind
[2:12:02] to approach you and to examine ourselves
[2:12:06] so that we're not putting ourselves in a
[2:12:08] position that we have no right to
[2:12:11] but yet we would never back up on a
[2:12:13] position
[2:12:14] that you have put us in lord may we
[2:12:17] come your provided way may we not
[2:12:20] try to skip a step or skip a timing
[2:12:23] or put something ahead of where it
[2:12:26] should be but
[2:12:27] may we come resting in what you have
[2:12:30] done
[2:12:31] and what you have said in the timing and
[2:12:34] position that you have placed
[2:12:37] and when you have done that let us never
[2:12:40] back up on it lord

[2:12:57] guide and anoint all those that are
[2:12:59] involved and lord may it be one that
[2:13:01] would glorify you lord

[2:13:11] amen god bless you let's sing brother
[2:13:14] john
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:22] returning for
[2:13:25] resting on his wine
[2:13:33] have no earthly love that i'm
[2:13:37] holding to
[2:13:40] you're the one who means everything
[2:13:44] to me so i
[2:13:48] will see
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:09] to you
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:25] not one thing you said you had not done
[2:14:32] someday when i see you standing
[2:14:36] face to face
[2:15:13] and i know
[2:15:34] to you're the one who means everything
[2:15:39] to me
[2:15:42] i will see i
[2:15:46] will worship you
[2:15:57] i will give everything
[2:16:05] [Music]
[2:16:09] praise god my brother ben was preaching
[2:16:14] there i just kept thinking i'm so glad
[2:16:16] that god is not a flirter
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:19] because if he was just flirtatious amen
[2:16:22] you'd wonder whether he really wanted
[2:16:23] you or they wanted to marry you or not
[2:16:25] but
[2:16:25] that's demeaning god's character if god
[2:16:28] has come to you and if god has begun to
[2:16:30] draw you to himself
[2:16:32] he's not a flirter he's announcing his
[2:16:34] intentions
[2:16:35] he's not playing with our emotions he's
[2:16:37] not showing the message just to take it
[2:16:39] away
[2:16:39] just so he can play a little emotional
[2:16:41] game with us but if god has drawn you
[2:16:43] he's declared his intention by the
[2:16:45] drawing
[2:16:48] sometimes people they they say oh god's
[2:16:50] called me and i don't know if god's
[2:16:51] called me and
[2:16:52] i know i'm the bride and i don't know i
[2:16:53] don't know if they're right amen you
[2:16:55] know what you're doing you're demeaning
[2:16:56] the character of the one who's drawing
[2:16:58] you turning him into a flirter but he's
[2:17:01] not a flirter
[2:17:03] he's got an intention he's got a heart
[2:17:05] purpose and his heart purpose before the
[2:17:06] foundation of the world will have a
[2:17:07] bride
[2:17:08] after his own choosing and he's not
[2:17:11] flirtatious friends
[2:17:13] if he's drawing you by this message if
[2:17:15] he's
[2:17:16] wooing you and luring him to himself
[2:17:19] he's stating what his intention is he
[2:17:22] loves you
[2:17:23] and he wants to marry you
[2:17:26] amen enjoyed the message today
[2:17:30] pray god bless our brother i got some
[2:17:32] extra notes
[2:17:34] for the wedding ceremony
[2:17:37] praise be to god what a good day for
[2:17:40] this service
[2:17:42] you know he was talking about the the
[2:17:44] types
[2:17:45] natural typing the spiritual and brother
[2:17:47] benham talking about the woman working
[2:17:49] and the provision and all of those
[2:17:51] things
[2:17:52] brother branham goes to a scripture i
[2:17:54] believe it's in isaiah he says
[2:17:56] in that day seven women will take a hold
[2:17:58] of one man and say give us thy name
[2:18:01] only will eat of our bread and wear our
[2:18:03] own garments
[2:18:04] brother said that's showing an end time
[2:18:07] condition the incoming condition he said
[2:18:09] is marriage and divorce
[2:18:10] but also where a woman does not want to
[2:18:13] come under the headship in
[2:18:15] total care of a man she just wants it to
[2:18:18] take away her reproach by being married
[2:18:20] give us your name but i'll work and
[2:18:22] provide for myself my own garments and
[2:18:25] my own bread
[2:18:26] that's why when brother ben's striking
[2:18:28] at that thing he's striking at it for a
[2:18:30] reason because those things are
[2:18:32] wrong in principle they are wrong in
[2:18:35] principle
[2:18:36] because it demonstrates in the natural
[2:18:38] the wrong thing in the spiritual
[2:18:40] because that's what has happened to the
[2:18:42] churches they want to be called
[2:18:43] christian
[2:18:44] but they want to take care of themselves
[2:18:45] they want to have their own way they
[2:18:47] don't want to submit fully
[2:18:48] amen in full submission and surrender to
[2:18:51] their headship
[2:18:52] and expect full care they still want to
[2:18:55] do their own thing so they don't have to
[2:18:56] have a full submission
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:18:59] it's a form of rebellion spiritually
[2:19:03] self-sufficiency amen is a lack of
[2:19:06] confidence in a form of rebellion
[2:19:09] and that's why those things that's why
[2:19:12] brotherhood strikes against those things
[2:19:14] because they're fundamentally wrong in
[2:19:16] principle
[2:19:18] when you look at the principle behind
[2:19:19] the thing and we don't ever want to be
[2:19:21] that kind of church that's not what he
[2:19:23] had in his heart's purpose
[2:19:25] from before the foundation of the world
[2:19:26] but he's wooing a bride he's calling a
[2:19:28] bride that says
[2:19:29] i've got confidence in you i trust in
[2:19:31] you i'm comfortable with your leadership
[2:19:34] and i'm not going to do anything to take
[2:19:35] care of myself because you promised to
[2:19:37] take care of me
[2:19:39] you bear me on your shoulders
[2:19:43] that's the right approach that's the
[2:19:45] right attitude
[2:19:47] towards christ that's the bride that
[2:19:49] he's looking for
[2:19:50] in this day i said lord
[2:19:54] i'm not capable of taking care of myself
[2:19:58] i'm not capable of providing my own
[2:20:00] bread
[2:20:01] my own manna i'm not capable providing
[2:20:05] my own garment my own covering which is
[2:20:06] the word
[2:20:08] i need you for all of that
[2:20:11] so i surrender all to your headship
[2:20:15] to your leadership i'm not going to go
[2:20:17] around trying to provide my own
[2:20:19] protection
[2:20:20] covering and care and and demean
[2:20:23] your power and ability to take care of
[2:20:25] me but i'm going to surrender
[2:20:28] all to you it says in another church age
[2:20:31] friends
[2:20:32] this is the bright age he's looking for
[2:20:36] character
[2:20:37] amen god bless you as you're dismissed
[2:20:40] let's just sing that again brother john
[2:20:42] if you don't mind
[2:20:46] know the time the bride that you're
[2:20:50] returning for
[2:20:54] dressed in garments white wrinkle
[2:20:58] free
[2:21:01] have no earthly love that i'm
[2:21:05] holding to
[2:21:08] you're the one who needs everything
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:24] hardly me your throne
[2:21:29] i will give anything
[2:21:33] i will give everything
[2:21:36] to you
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:51] there's not one thing
[2:22:01] standing face to face
[2:22:05] my praise for you
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:15] i will worship you
[2:22:19] i will bow myself
[2:22:29] i will give everything
[2:22:33] for you
[2:22:38] god bless you saints pray for us as we
