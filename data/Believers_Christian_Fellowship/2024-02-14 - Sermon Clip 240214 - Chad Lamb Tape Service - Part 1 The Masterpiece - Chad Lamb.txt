TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now we know where did where did Michelangelo get this image that he was going to model this this sculpture after it came by inspiration and it came as an image by inspiration in his mind of what Moses looked like it's important brother Brandon he's trying to show us a type he's using this as a time so if we go to paragraph 44 at the bottom of page nine says now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book and let's open another book and read of the great sculptor the almighty who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking so brother renam is just tying the two together and he's showing where did Michelangelo get the image that he was going to make the sculpt the the sculpture of Moses he got it from inspiration from his own mind where did God get the image of the great work he was doing it was in his mind so let's turn turn back to the beginning here on uh paragraph 33 page 7 bottom of page s there's something he says that I just want to reference we'll start right in the middle of this paragraph where it says and see and see only the man the sculptor himself has in his mind what he's trying to do he is the one you might walk up and say to him what are you pecking on that rock for to The Outsider who doesn't know what's in his heart it's nonsense but to the man the sculptor himself he's got a vision in his mind of what he's trying to make amen I love that God already has in his mind the image of you and I he knows what he's trying to do with his bride he knows what he's been doing over seven Church ages he knows what it's going to look like at the End Amen and and along the way it may not be clear and we may question why this age and why did this happen and why did this go right and why did this go wrong through the seven Church ages we look at it that way but the sculptor has in his mind by inspiration by a vision he already knows what he's going to produce and every stroke has the one object in mind to bring it to this conclusion and the same thing in our life God already has a design in his mind for the way we're going to look at the end of our life's journey and we may not understand every stroke and sometimes we've asked God why why why did you do that why the Chisel right there and why so deep why did you cut so deep and why did you knock such a big chunk off but he already has the Vision in his mind and every stroke every stroke has that vision in mind and he's working it to one goal and that's so he gets you and I in the image he had of us before the foundation of the world praise God what's so beautiful about that is we have trials we have tribulations we have difficulties but he saw me finished before the foundation of the world there's no fear in me not finishing because the master the master Craftsman the master artist is on the job and he knows how hard to strike where to strike where to polish when to beat and when to rub and there's no chance that I won't come into that image because he's working by inspiration
