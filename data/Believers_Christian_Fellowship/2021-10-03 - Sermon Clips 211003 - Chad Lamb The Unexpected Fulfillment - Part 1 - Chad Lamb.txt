TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's two things he talks about that this seal is like it's like the coming of john the baptist and the coming of our lord in the stable what's happening maybe it's the second forerunner and the thing that he foreign maybe it come just like the first time maybe it come like john the baptist and our lord in a stable how many people were driving by that day and knew there was a church service and had no clue what was going on how many people on earth had no clue what was going on jesus was his mother was coming down amen from from nazareth coming out of galilee into into bethlehem how many people knew it she was carrying the word the messiah was within her how many people knew it it becomes such a simple humble way it come from a girl out of nazareth a mean city it didn't come like they would expect this to come a virgin shall conceive well what is our conception of a virgin it's the virgin nation because the glorious nation of israel or it must be the virgin daughter of the high priest it's always got to be something big but when the angel came he came to a little virgin that was chosen before the foundation of the world amen that was going to get water amen a little virgin girl in nazareth that nobody knew about and very few people cared anything about but the time of the promise was going to be fulfilled in her and now she was going to be carrying the word now the word was going to be in her and here she comes walking around pregnant amen and and she is the fulfillment of the prophecy but because they didn't expect the prophecy to be fulfilled that day their interpretation and the fulfillment didn't match so they reject the interpretation and start rumors and lies about how she was impregnated what are they claiming listen what are the lies telling you the lies are telling you that that's some man seeding her but that was no man's seed in her that was the the seed christ amen that was within her and brother benham comes with the seventh seal and he says ah you think something like that would be priest in the vatican but it comes like john the baptist it comes like our lord in a stable i'm telling you the same thing has happened and they've missed it god help us not to keep missing it open our eyes lord and let us see what's happening all around us amen let us recognize our day and its message let us recognize what you're doing in this hour and let us god wash away denominational understanding out of our mind wash away intellectual reading out of our mind and give us your revelation on the word eyes to see and ears to hear because we must have it in this hour
