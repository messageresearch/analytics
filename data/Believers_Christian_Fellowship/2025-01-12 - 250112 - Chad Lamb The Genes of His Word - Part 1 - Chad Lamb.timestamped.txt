[17:21] last Wednesday we weren't really getting

[17:24] we got and so some of the deacons and
[17:27] trustees and even some of the younger
[17:28] Brothers had to slip out help clear the
[17:31] driveway or the the sidewalks and salt
[17:33] and so we just want to say God bless you
[17:35] we appreciate you for doing that for us
[17:39] amen amen let's look at Matthew 13: 24
[17:47] together Matthew chap 13:
[17:52] 24 another Parable put he forth unto
[17:55] them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is lik
[17:57] UN to a man which SED a good seed in his
[17:59] field but while men slept his enemy came
[18:02] and swed tears among the wheat and went
[18:04] his way but when the blade was sprung up
[18:07] and brought forth fruit then appeared
[18:09] the tears also so the so the Servants of
[18:12] the householder came and said unto him
[18:14] sir this not thou so good seed in thy
[18:16] field from whence then haveth it tears
[18:18] he said unto them an enemy has done this
[18:21] the
[18:22] servants the servants said unto him wilt
[18:26] thou then that we go and gather them up
[18:28] but he said nay lest while you gather up
[18:30] the tears you root up also the wheat
[18:32] with them let both grow together until
[18:34] the Harvest and in the time of harvest I
[18:36] will say to the Reapers Gather ye
[18:37] together first the tears and bind them
[18:39] in bundles to burn them but gather the
[18:41] wheat into the
[18:43] barn further down in verse 37 he gives
[18:46] the
[18:46] interpretation of this uh Parable he
[18:49] says in verse 37 he answered and said
[18:51] unto them he that Seth The Good Seed is
[18:54] the son of man the field is the world
[18:57] the good seed are the children of of the
[18:59] Kingdom but the tears are the children
[19:01] of the wicked one the enemy that SED
[19:03] them is the devil the Harvest is the end
[19:05] of the world and the reapers are the
[19:08] Angels amen may God add his Blessing to
[19:11] the word as you can be seated keep your
[19:13] Bibles open we're going to flip over to
[19:16] another verse so we know this Parable
[19:18] really well and the in the parable he
[19:22] begins to talk about a man sowed seed
[19:24] but there come up a a diverse crop amen
[19:27] and there was two seeds seeds that were
[19:29] swn and he tells us here the
[19:30] interpretation he that sowed the good
[19:32] seed or what would be the wheat is the
[19:35] son of
[19:36] man the field is the world the seed are
[19:40] the children of the Kingdom but the
[19:42] tears are the children of the wicked one
[19:44] and Satan swed them so we we know this
[19:46] is a picture of the world of the earth
[19:48] that we live in and the in the uh sewing
[19:51] of the mixed seed that took place all
[19:53] the way back in Genesis and so that's
[19:56] one aspect of the seed that we want to
[19:58] look at but if we go over to Luke
[19:59] chapter 8 let's turn together to Luke
[20:02] chapter
[20:06] 8 in Luke chapter
[20:08] [Music]
[20:15] 8
[20:17] uh verse 4 Luke chapter 8
[20:23] verse4 and when much people were
[20:25] gathered together and were come to him
[20:27] out of every city spake a parable a swer
[20:30] went out to sew his seed and as he sowed
[20:32] some fell by the wayside and it was
[20:34] trotten down and the fowls of the air
[20:36] devoured it and some fell upon the rock
[20:38] and as soon as it was sprung up it
[20:40] withered away because it lacked moisture
[20:42] and some fell among the thorns and the
[20:44] Thorns sprang up with it and choked it
[20:47] and others fell on good ground and
[20:49] sprang up and bare fruit H 100 fold then
[20:52] he goes down to give the interpretation
[20:53] of this in verse 11 he says now the
[20:55] parable is this the seed is the word of
[20:58] God on so we've looked at two Parables
[21:01] and in the two Parables amen Jesus uses
[21:04] seed in two different ways in the first
[21:06] Parable he SWS the seed and the one who
[21:08] SWS The Good Seed or the wheat is the is
[21:11] the son of man the one who SWS The Bad
[21:13] Seed or the tears is is the devil
[21:16] they're of the wicked one one are
[21:17] children of God some are the wicked one
[21:19] and so he's using the seed to speak of
[21:21] people that were swn into the Earth then
[21:24] the second Parable the seed is the word
[21:26] of God so as the word of God goes and it
[21:29] falls in different kinds of soil four
[21:31] categories of soil the thorny places the
[21:33] byways and all of this amen but some
[21:36] fell in good ground and the good ground
[21:38] now is the people the good ground now
[21:41] are the children of God Amen so the
[21:43] question is are you a seed or are you
[21:46] good ground and the answer we know is
[21:47] yes amen that's always the way it is
[21:50] God's always using these Parables to
[21:52] teach a a lesson and he wants us to
[21:54] catch a spiritual lesson so but I want
[21:56] to look at this uh this subject of seed
[21:59] today for a little bit and my my title
[22:03] comes out of this uh quote and I'm going
[22:05] to read you the quote out of God's only
[22:07] provided place of worship says he had in
[22:10] his heart before the foundation of the
[22:11] world a son because he is a father but
[22:14] it was still in the genes of his
[22:18] word still in the genes of his word and
[22:21] he created a man and he had to put him
[22:23] on free moral agency but the man fell
[22:25] but the great sculptor God who made man
[22:27] from the dust of the earth he did didn't
[22:28] settle for that he started making man
[22:30] again and he talk talking about the
[22:32] process coming back from through the
[22:34] prophets from Noah to Moses and he's
[22:36] looking for this man he's trying to
[22:37] rebuild Amen to a Son of God because
[22:40] that's what he had in his mind from the
[22:41] beginning he wanted a Son of God to
[22:43] inherit all of creation and he want his
[22:46] family to be upon the Earth but he says
[22:49] I'm going to go back to this first
[22:50] sentence he had in his heart before the
[22:52] foundation World a son because he is a
[22:54] father but it was still in the genes of
[22:56] his word and I started looking at this
[22:58] statement and it really started to it
[23:01] really started to to mle over in my mind
[23:03] so the title is the uh the genes of his
[23:07] word the genes of his word and I just
[23:09] want to look at that amen because uh so
[23:14] when we look back at the the the the
[23:16] parable of the seed either way we look
[23:18] at it whether the seed is the people or
[23:20] the seed is the word falling into the
[23:22] good ground which are people the seed
[23:24] contains within it the genetics amen
[23:26] this is where the word Gene comes from
[23:29] amen and I think it's so interesting
[23:30] that brother Brenham finished his
[23:31] ministry in 1965 focused on the C Gene
[23:35] he didn't really talk about it before
[23:37] and we know that the that the message is
[23:39] building to something all along it's
[23:41] building it's building it's building and
[23:43] bringing us greater Revelation and more
[23:45] clarity all the time and we know that
[23:47] the prophet is getting greater
[23:48] Revelation and more clarity all the time
[23:50] and he comes to this time amen when when
[23:53] when really there was things going on in
[23:55] the natural world in the scientific
[23:57] world and in the message countdown
[23:59] brother benam tells us that God allows
[24:01] man amen man's achievements to go ahead
[24:03] to show what God's achievements are so
[24:06] he talks about the the age of the
[24:08] automobile going from horse and buggy to
[24:10] automobile amen because we were going to
[24:12] be moving into another Revival and then
[24:14] going into the airplane phase and he he
[24:17] discusses all this at countdown because
[24:19] the airplane amen the wri brothers flew
[24:22] their airplane and took to the air man
[24:24] took to the air amen just before the
[24:26] Pentecostal Revival broke out and isza
[24:28] street so he's showing this achievement
[24:31] in science showing what God's going to
[24:33] achieve spiritually and then brother B
[24:35] says now we're to the astronaut age
[24:37] they're going to they're going to shoot
[24:38] a man outside the atmosphere he's going
[24:40] to go outside the atmosphere of the
[24:42] Earth showing that there's going to be
[24:44] people that are going to be able to lift
[24:45] up out the atmosphere of this Earth
[24:48] beyond the gravitational hole beyond all
[24:51] the laws that have bound us so far Amen
[24:54] in this age there's going to be a people
[24:55] that shoot up through a great power amen
[24:58] and get outside the atmosphere of the
[25:01] earth praise be to
[25:03] God Amen and
[25:06] so he's teaching us this this principle
[25:10] but things began to be discussed around
[25:13] the time that brother bam was here and
[25:14] they just started into this idea of
[25:17] genetics this whole science of genetics
[25:19] starts in and in studying the Gene and
[25:22] Gene mapping and and discovery of DNA
[25:25] and how chromosomes come together and
[25:27] make DNA DNA and how Jo genes work and
[25:30] it was just an infancy there we've seen
[25:32] an explosion of that understanding since
[25:34] that
[25:35] time and brother manham is able to pick
[25:38] up on terminology amen that you wouldn't
[25:40] think a seventh grade educated hillbilly
[25:44] preacher we start talking about
[25:46] something that was just a new scientific
[25:48] discovery but he's recognizing the new
[25:51] scientific ground is showing that God's
[25:53] bringing us into a greater understanding
[25:56] of who we really are Hallelujah and in
[25:59] 1965 he really it becomes the year of
[26:02] the SE Gene I mean that's just me saying
[26:04] that I I don't I'm not trying to label
[26:06] anything but but that's when he really
[26:08] starts to lay this down and talk about
[26:10] the seed Gene the gene of God a
[26:12] spiritual seed and all of these things
[26:14] and so there's such a there's such a
[26:16] powerful truth laying in here that we
[26:18] want to see amen so we know that when
[26:22] that seed went into the ground in the
[26:24] first Parable amen the the the son of
[26:26] man SED good seed and then a wicked one
[26:29] seed another seed we know that in the
[26:31] process of time under the certain
[26:33] conditions that there's genetics inside
[26:36] of those seeds and the genetics within
[26:38] those seeds amen when they get in the
[26:40] right condition they're going to
[26:42] reproduce whatever whatever is embedded
[26:45] in the genes of that seed is what it's
[26:47] going to manifest yeah right so be the
[26:50] wheat seed or the what he calls The Good
[26:52] Seed it begins to manifest what's
[26:55] already on the inside of it amen as it
[26:57] comes through the growing season or
[26:59] through the growing condition but also
[27:01] the tears which he calls The Bad Seed or
[27:03] the children of the wicked one amen
[27:05] they're going to under the same growing
[27:07] condition they're going to manifest
[27:09] what's inside of
[27:10] them amen they they can't change what
[27:15] they
[27:18] are oh praise God this is what this is
[27:22] what the whole understanding of genes is
[27:25] all
[27:26] about they were all already
[27:29] pre-programmed in their
[27:31] DNA those little seeds they couldn't
[27:34] change what they were it was already
[27:38] inside of them this is
[27:41] amazing I I I just looked up
[27:44] jeans uh for a moment I mean on the
[27:48] internet just to get some sort of
[27:50] definition and there's all kinds of
[27:52] information but it it it this the
[27:55] expression it's in your jeans means that
[27:57] a person has an inherit certain traits
[27:59] or characteristics from their
[28:01] parents and we know that brother M
[28:04] discusses that we were all aware of that
[28:07] amen that the the genetics we have come
[28:09] from our
[28:10] parents and so that's why family strains
[28:13] tend to look alike they have certain
[28:14] characteristics that are similar and and
[28:17] you can all you can name a family name
[28:19] and say that's just this family that's
[28:22] just ABC family and everybody knows what
[28:24] you're talking about because ABC family
[28:27] you know they all go to bed early they
[28:29] all get up early and they all tuck their
[28:31] shirts in and they all do this then you
[28:33] say that's XYZ family and XYZ family
[28:36] never on time and they
[28:39] don't and it seems to affect the whole
[28:44] family because you know one group's fun
[28:47] the other's not fun and so one family
[28:50] gets invited to work days the other F to
[28:52] get to parties so so we put them
[28:55] together so we can all you know enjoy
[28:57] each other
[28:59] but there's just certain characteristics
[29:01] you know and we know you know you know
[29:03] it's not fixed we know that there's
[29:04] variables and there's all kinds of
[29:06] ingredients that come down through
[29:07] grandparents and all that and because
[29:08] you can have ABC family that gets an XYZ
[29:11] planted right in the middle and God does
[29:13] that on purpose because that's what we
[29:14] need
[29:16] amen but the reality is those things
[29:19] come through the genetics right I I told
[29:23] you years ago I think I I I think I
[29:25] shared this with you years ago uh I read
[29:28] a book and the book was on
[29:32] the I'm sorry I can't remember the exact
[29:34] I think it was called the Minnesota
[29:36] project I think that's what it
[29:38] was and in the Minnesota project what
[29:41] they did is they they and the reason I
[29:44] did it is because of what brother BM
[29:45] said about jeans so I went to the Lo
[29:48] local library now listen we used to not
[29:50] look up Google I mean we used to
[29:52] actually go to the
[29:54] library right and when I first started
[29:56] doing this as a kid we we actually would
[29:59] pull out index cards out of the library
[30:02] on a certain sub I mean we didn't even
[30:05] have a search program on the computer I
[30:07] don't know how we made it in life I
[30:09] don't know how we know anything how is
[30:11] it we know anything it was a lot harder
[30:14] back then so when I would study things
[30:16] out in the message it was in the library
[30:17] I used to go to the library all the time
[30:19] so I went to the library and I was
[30:20] studying genes and genetics and all of
[30:22] that and I come across this book that
[30:24] was fascinating and I'm I'm pretty sure
[30:26] it was it was I don't know if was titled
[30:28] the Minnesota project but it was
[30:29] discussing the findings of the Minnesota
[30:31] project and it was about twins and what
[30:33] they had done is they found a whole
[30:35] series of twins that have been separated
[30:37] at Birth and adopted into separate
[30:39] families and they were identical twins
[30:42] and they had been and they grew up in
[30:45] different environments they grew up uh
[30:47] in different uh uh uh with different
[30:49] kinds of parents uh situations uh
[30:52] financially they raised in different uh
[30:54] classes they were they were they they
[30:57] and started putting them together and
[30:59] studying them so they would find them
[31:00] through birth records and they would put
[31:02] them together and the interesting thing
[31:04] in the Minnesota project was that no
[31:08] matter how they grew up when they put
[31:12] them together they acted just the
[31:14] same one child would go to an
[31:28] I mean if I mean you could probably find
[31:30] it on Google Now in 30 seconds and they
[31:32] probably got a YouTube video that
[31:34] explains everything in 10 minutes what I
[31:35] had to read a whole book to get but it's
[31:38] interesting because there was even times
[31:42] that these twins were given the same
[31:44] name by their adopted families they were
[31:48] G separated as infants they were given
[31:49] the same name there was two in
[31:51] particular I remember they both got the
[31:52] name
[31:53] James one was James the other was
[31:56] James they GRE up they both became
[32:03] firefighters they both married a woman
[32:07] and the first woman they married they
[32:08] had the same
[32:10] name I can't remember her
[32:12] name and they both had a dog and they
[32:15] named the dog the same
[32:19] name it's
[32:21] crazy there was two two women in the UK
[32:24] that had been separated but they found
[32:26] them together and they brought them back
[32:27] together when they brought them back
[32:28] together they styled their hair the same
[32:30] way they like the same kind of clothing
[32:32] they made the same choices in clothing
[32:34] and they both had they they held their
[32:36] finger out with a little Crook in it
[32:38] when they drank and they both noticed it
[32:39] across the table when they met for the
[32:40] first
[32:43] time so they
[32:45] realized uh and the the whole premise of
[32:48] the book was what affects you more
[32:50] genetics or environment that was the
[32:53] whole premise of the book and what they
[32:54] found out is the most powerful influence
[32:57] in your life is
[32:59] genetics it's not that environment
[33:01] doesn't have one and the the really evil
[33:04] Wicked kind of environment can actually
[33:06] taint the genetics it can actually do do
[33:08] some destruction but just in the normal
[33:11] process of normal life the strongest
[33:14] power on you is
[33:16] genetics the reason you are the way you
[33:19] are you react the way you act many times
[33:21] the strongest pull on that is
[33:24] genetics amen and so when we bring it
[33:28] now into the
[33:30] message the strongest pull on us is the
[33:34] genetics of
[33:36] God that's why a seed had to be planted
[33:39] in us there had to be something more
[33:42] powerful than a natural Earthly life
[33:45] there had to be something more powerful
[33:46] than our willpower and our ability
[33:48] sometime down the road to make the right
[33:50] choice amen God wasn't going to base it
[33:52] on this natural life and this Natural
[33:54] Choice and this natural willpower of a
[33:57] natural mind to do natural things amen
[33:59] but he embedded part of his genetics
[34:01] inside cuz he knew the most powerful
[34:03] force would be
[34:05] genetics we know this in life and that's
[34:08] why they that's why they use genetics
[34:09] and study genetics to get better crops
[34:11] and bigger cattle and all these other
[34:13] things because they know the most
[34:14] powerful voice is
[34:16] genetics praise be to
[34:19] God Gene genes are segments of DNA is
[34:23] what it says which is a a biological
[34:25] blueprint for proteins that form the
[34:26] building blocks of the the cell so
[34:29] you're made up the way you're
[34:30] constructed the way you're built is
[34:31] because of your jeans right the color
[34:34] hair you have the color eyes you have
[34:36] the stature that you grow to many things
[34:39] are are are affected by your jeans and
[34:41] when we go back to the two firefighters
[34:43] named
[34:44] James they both struggled with weight
[34:48] when they met one was about 40 or 50
[34:50] pounds lighter than the other but only
[34:53] because he worked super hard to do it it
[34:56] didn't come natural for him it was very
[34:58] difficult so there are factors that you
[35:01] can there are factors amen that works
[35:03] together with genetics and they
[35:05] environmental factors and choices you
[35:06] make but the underlying power is
[35:10] genes God
[35:14] Amen brother B says
[35:17] uh in the message modern events made
[35:19] clear by prophecy he said but the real
[35:21] ordained of God that real Gene that real
[35:24] germ a soul of God that was in God
[35:26] before the foundation of the world
[35:27] remember you that's really got the
[35:29] spirit of God in you tonight you were
[35:31] here in Christ because he was the
[35:33] fullness of the word amen that real germ
[35:37] that soul of God that was in God before
[35:39] the foundation of the world what kind of
[35:42] genes are in that God's
[35:46] jeans and things that are to be says now
[35:49] the next thing you receive was the
[35:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire now
[35:53] God when this Millennium is over God is
[35:55] going to give the world a baptism of
[35:56] fire it's going to blow the whole thing
[35:58] up the heavens and earth will be on fire
[36:00] Peter said so and the thing will have a
[36:03] baptism of fire renovation of the whole
[36:05] thing and then there'll be a new heavens
[36:07] and new earth that's when that's when
[36:09] where where dwelleth righteousness
[36:11] that's where we
[36:15] are that's where we are amen if we've
[36:18] had the baptism of fire that's where we
[36:20] are amen the new heavens and new earth
[36:23] amen we have become from Mortal beings
[36:25] from time beings to eternal
[36:28] beings when the word of God lit our
[36:30] souls and we became Sons and Daughters
[36:32] of God with the attributes the gene of
[36:34] God in us to be Sons and Daughters of
[36:36] the father God in heaven crying Abba
[36:39] Father so now we find out that we come
[36:42] to this life with a gene embedded in our
[36:44] soul amen those who are the
[36:46] predestinated elect of God they have the
[36:48] genetics of God embedded in their soul
[36:50] amen and a certain time God will send
[36:52] the fire of the Holy Ghost Amen to spark
[36:55] off or light up or or or or bring life
[36:58] or Quicken these are all terms that we
[37:00] use amen this Gene of God this genetics
[37:02] of God that's embedded there to bring it
[37:04] to life to it starts to multiply and
[37:06] starts to work in our lives amen and
[37:09] many times God will use the word to do
[37:10] that and so now we know that the seed
[37:12] that was sown are the children of God
[37:15] but then the seed that was swn was the
[37:17] word of God because the word of God is
[37:19] also part of God amen amen what is that
[37:22] c Gene inside of you part of God what is
[37:24] it it's the word absolutely it's the
[37:27] thought Express it's the word amen what
[37:30] is the word the word is God what is it
[37:32] it's a it's a part of God's thinking
[37:34] it's a part of God's expression it's a
[37:36] part of God and so when that word comes
[37:38] into you what is it amen it's it's part
[37:41] of God it has genetics inside of it amen
[37:45] the true word of God has the gene of God
[37:47] with it that's why it's a seed amen that
[37:50] can fall into ground and that seed when
[37:53] it falls into the wrong soil will never
[37:55] germinate and produce because it takes a
[37:56] certain EnV enironment it takes a
[37:58] certain uh it takes a certain set of of
[38:01] of happenings amen for that thing to
[38:03] germinate and take off if it falls into
[38:05] the Stony ground it it it doesn't work
[38:07] it sprouts up and then it's plucked away
[38:09] when it falls into the Thorns when it
[38:11] falls into the byway but but where that
[38:14] seed begins to grow and reproduce itself
[38:17] is when it falls into the good
[38:19] ground cu the good ground is a match for
[38:21] the seed and the seed is a match for the
[38:23] good ground nothing else is a match so
[38:26] what is in that seed the genes of
[38:30] God so that's why that seed brother REM
[38:33] says in power of transformation or power
[38:35] to transform me he preaches it a couple
[38:36] times under different titles he said the
[38:40] power is already in the seed to
[38:43] transform itself into whatever the life
[38:45] of the seed is it's already
[38:49] there
[38:52] amen so when your parents came together
[38:55] to form you there was 23 chromosomes
[38:58] that came from your father and 23
[38:59] chromosomes that came from your mother
[39:01] they came together and bound themselves
[39:03] together in what is a DNA
[39:05] strand that DNA strand became the book
[39:09] of your
[39:11] life it has all the information of your
[39:14] life is coded and written when those
[39:18] chromosomes came together all the
[39:21] information that would make up you your
[39:23] body your stature your height your
[39:25] temperament your eye color your hair
[39:27] color your your everything else when it
[39:29] came together there and listen not one
[39:31] bit more information was added cuz it
[39:33] was all there it's just been the rest of
[39:35] your life unfolding what's already there
[39:38] amen it's there it's just unfolding
[39:41] what's already
[39:43] there
[39:46] amen and so when this first quote that I
[39:50] went to to get my title when brother
[39:52] venam was saying uh uh that God had in
[39:55] his mind a son from before the
[39:56] foundation of the world it was in the
[39:58] genes of his
[39:59] word that means it's already in his word
[40:03] amen all it needs is that word needs to
[40:06] fall into the right soil at the right
[40:08] time amen the right season of growth
[40:11] under the right conditions with the
[40:13] right moisture and the right light and
[40:14] the right everything and when that seed
[40:16] falls into the right conditions at the
[40:18] right time it'll produce what's already
[40:21] in the seed amen it was already in God's
[40:23] mind it was already in God's mind when
[40:26] he spoke it when he spoke the word the
[40:28] power was already there for it to
[40:29] transform itself into what it already
[40:31] was when he said through Isaiah 700
[40:34] years before Mary was here he said a
[40:36] virgin shall conceive inside that word
[40:39] is the power to reproduce himself it
[40:41] contains the very thought the very Gene
[40:43] of God to transform itself into what it
[40:46] is it just has to fall into the right
[40:48] good ground at the right season amen and
[40:50] the right growing
[40:52] condition when God determined because
[40:54] every seed has its season remember
[40:57] brother man taught us you don't plant
[40:58] wheat the same time you plant your corn
[41:00] everything has a season and it matures
[41:02] at a certain rate and it's harvested in
[41:04] a certain way and there's certain
[41:05] characteristics to every seed and so is
[41:07] the word of God when the word of God
[41:09] Amen when he speaks his word that seed
[41:12] has a certain time to come forth under a
[41:14] certain growing condition and when all
[41:16] the conditions are met the power is
[41:18] already in the
[41:21] seed amen amen so what do we need
[41:24] brother Chad we need to be a seed am
[41:27] right guess what you can't control
[41:29] that you can't you have no control over
[41:33] that that's something God determined
[41:35] before the foundation of the world Amen
[41:38] and you also need to receive a
[41:41] seed because these two things need to
[41:43] come
[41:45] together because the seed children of
[41:47] God are the good ground where the seed
[41:50] word of God is going to produce
[41:53] itself so these two things must come
[41:56] together
[41:57] in the message things that are to be he
[42:00] says now the next thing you receive was
[42:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire oh
[42:03] I already read that sorry God's only
[42:05] provided place of worship The Headstone
[42:07] crying what Grace Grace pass from death
[42:10] and Creed into the Living Word of the
[42:11] Living God God's only provided plan for
[42:14] his age his sons in the word age what
[42:18] age are we living in the word
[42:21] age his sons in the word age quickened
[42:23] by the spirit like a spark that's lit
[42:25] off of something to make it alive
[42:27] and seated now in Heavenly places in
[42:29] present tense already alive and subject
[42:31] to every promise in the word Amen
[42:34] brother B tells us that that you and I
[42:37] with the the portion of God that's
[42:39] planted in our souls you and I could
[42:41] never have come forth in any other age
[42:44] that's what he told us because we were
[42:47] predestinated to come forth in a certain
[42:49] age in a certain season amen so God Amen
[42:52] planted certain genetics in us that
[42:54] would only come into manifestation in a
[42:56] certain season and what season would
[42:58] that be it would be this season the word
[43:00] age the end time the Harvest Time the
[43:03] bride age the free age the abrahamic age
[43:06] everything brother B the astronaut age
[43:08] everything that he labels it at he's
[43:10] showing us we're in a specific time
[43:12] we're in something that's an amazing
[43:13] we're an amazing period of time and in
[43:15] that amazing period of time he planted
[43:18] seeds before the foundation of the world
[43:19] that he knew would grow in this time and
[43:21] it would take a certain environment a
[43:23] certain place for the seed inside of you
[43:25] to grow God
[43:27] and it could only respond and this is
[43:29] what brother said it could only respond
[43:31] to the water and things for that
[43:33] age so it couldn't respond the seed that
[43:36] was in US couldn't respond until we
[43:38] found the matching growing season yeah
[43:42] that's why we went to churches and there
[43:43] was something inside of us brother bam
[43:45] said that little seed was was there and
[43:47] it was somehow working in the background
[43:49] now don't ask me to understand this I
[43:51] don't understand it but it's absolutely
[43:53] the truth because there was a spiritual
[43:54] life already planted down in there
[43:56] though it had to be quick and it wasn't
[43:58] dead amen because eternal life doesn't
[44:01] die it's a portion of eternal life but
[44:03] it was dormant somehow and inactive in
[44:06] some way amen but brother Brenham said
[44:09] you remember you would go to church and
[44:10] church you were looking for something
[44:12] and and others could do something you
[44:13] couldn't do he said that was that little
[44:14] spark of life down in you
[44:18] then but yet it wasn't alive it wasn't
[44:21] active it wasn't ruling your life yet
[44:24] amen but he says then you and he has
[44:27] different ways of explain but you went
[44:28] from this to that to the Methodist to
[44:30] the Methodist and and what was it there
[44:31] was something inside of you there was a
[44:33] craving amen and nothing would meet the
[44:35] craving amen but then you heard the
[44:37] eagle
[44:39] scream and then you realized whatever
[44:41] that was screaming is the same thing
[44:43] that's inside of me amen you know it
[44:45] wasn't it wasn't the eagle we know the
[44:48] story The Eagle in the chicken yard it
[44:50] wasn't that the eagle had to go look in
[44:51] a mirror and look up it wasn't that the
[44:53] eagle had to look at its wings when it
[44:55] heard the scream it it hits something on
[44:57] the inside of the eagle and the eagle
[45:00] recognized the scream right
[45:04] amen and was motivated to leave the
[45:07] chicken
[45:09] yard that was that little germ of life
[45:11] in us then am moving or wanting to move
[45:15] wanting to express but it had to be a
[45:17] certain season and the only kind of rain
[45:19] the only kind of water the only kind of
[45:21] light amen is the message of the hour
[45:23] Amen to bring it to life and to cause it
[45:26] to grow to form
[45:27] manifestation so when we come in contact
[45:29] with the life for this hour which is the
[45:33] Life of Christ the word the message amen
[45:36] when that life light word hit our life
[45:42] yeah quickened
[45:46] it
[45:48] amen like a spark that's lit off of
[45:52] something in the Rapture message brother
[45:54] man said the very Word Church all of
[45:56] these I'm quoting from her from
[45:58] 1965 the very Word Church means called
[46:01] out of as Moses called a nation out of a
[46:04] Nation the holy spirit is called a bride
[46:06] out of a church a church out of a church
[46:08] members from every denomination making
[46:10] up a bride tree it's in the tape the
[46:13] bride tree a bride coming out call and
[46:16] that's the one that the bride tree is
[46:18] the bride rather is the one that's going
[46:20] to be in the Rapture that alone nothing
[46:22] but the bride the elected ones forn by
[46:24] God from the beginning the fathers
[46:27] spiritual
[46:28] genes oh I want to be the father's
[46:30] spiritual Gene why do I want to be that
[46:33] amen I want to be that because without
[46:35] that there's no way I can express what
[46:36] he wants me to express yeah because I
[46:39] can only express the genetics that are
[46:40] inside of me
[46:42] amen amen and and show us the father and
[46:46] it will suffice us from 1962 brother BR
[46:49] says what does the seed
[46:51] do look at a little little apple tree
[46:54] out out here you people raise a lot of
[46:57] apples look a little apple tree when
[47:00] it's no more than that we call in the
[47:02] East a sprig a little tree about like
[47:04] that do you know that every Apple that
[47:07] will ever be on that tree is in it right
[47:08] then amen if it isn't where did it come
[47:11] from where did it come from and that
[47:13] apple tree that's going to produce you
[47:16] hundreds of bushels of apples where did
[47:17] they come from when you set that little
[47:20] plant out about like that just out of an
[47:22] apple seed and it's a set out there and
[47:25] every Apple that'll ever be on there
[47:27] it's got in it then potentially hundreds
[47:30] of bushels of apples that you'll collect
[47:32] off of it and it ain't a half an inch
[47:34] high so he's talking about a little
[47:36] sprig that just come out of the ground
[47:38] yeah there you are where does it come
[47:41] from it's in the Apple
[47:44] then and when you are planted into his
[47:47] death burial and Resurrection planted in
[47:48] Christ and receive his holy holy spirit
[47:51] life in you everything that you've got
[47:53] need of all the way through the Journey
[47:55] is in you right then for you become the
[47:58] seed yeah
[48:00] amen it was already planted now listen I
[48:04] don't want you to get confused it can be
[48:05] confusing following Brother Brenham
[48:07] through because sometimes when you lead
[48:08] early in his ministry amen he tells you
[48:11] you become a son or daughter of God you
[48:13] become a seed when the Holy Ghost comes
[48:15] into you but when he gets to the end of
[48:16] his ministry he doesn't say that he said
[48:18] you always were a Son of God you just
[48:21] didn't recognize it until the Holy
[48:23] Spirit awakened you awakened that life
[48:25] that was already in you so we got to
[48:27] follow the message through amen so that
[48:29] we find out so that we grow as the
[48:31] Revelation grows amen because at the end
[48:33] of his ministry he was trying to bring
[48:35] us to a greater understanding not a
[48:36] denominational understanding but a true
[48:39] understanding that that God planted his
[48:40] life in your soul before the foundation
[48:42] of the world because he had a purpose
[48:44] and a plan in doing so and he knew it
[48:45] was the only Power that would produce
[48:47] what he wanted to produ
[48:49] amen but that seed was waiting to come
[48:52] in contact with another seed another
[48:54] life another part of God and when those
[48:56] two parts of God come together it
[48:59] quickened
[49:01] amen amen so now at receiving the Holy
[49:05] Spirit life in you everything you have
[49:07] need of all along the way through the
[49:08] Journey is in you right then for you
[49:10] become the
[49:12] seed when brother man talks about that
[49:15] little apple you take a little apple
[49:18] seed and you lay that apple seed down on
[49:20] the table and you explain that to
[49:22] somebody what is that apple seed that is
[49:25] 5,000 bushels of apples yeah right like
[49:29] no
[49:31] way that's an apple tree with 5,000
[49:35] bushels of apples
[49:38] yeah you could take it crush it yeah
[49:43] slice it open look at it under a
[49:46] microscope you can't find the
[49:50] bushels you can't find the bark you
[49:52] can't find the leaves you can't find
[49:55] anything but it's there
[49:59] amen amen when you come on this life
[50:02] what was in you a son and daughter of
[50:04] God was in you but you could slice it
[50:06] dice it open and inspect it and you
[50:08] couldn't see it right amen and sometimes
[50:11] as we're growing even when we become mom
[50:13] you plant that little seed so say you
[50:15] believe me at first you may not believe
[50:16] me you do scientific experiments and
[50:18] slice it open and look under Amen in
[50:20] every which way and you can't see
[50:21] anything that I'm telling you there's
[50:23] nothing that I'm telling you that looks
[50:24] like the truth when you look at that
[50:26] little black seat
[50:27] but say you trust me and you put it in
[50:28] the ground and it comes out then all of
[50:30] a sudden it comes out this little
[50:31] spendly thing there's no apples on it
[50:33] there's no bushels there's no nothing
[50:35] you can just pluck it up and say he's a
[50:36] liar and throw it away yeah that's right
[50:39] cuz he told me that that's an apple tree
[50:42] and if I plan it I'll get an apple tree
[50:43] and I'll get 5,000 bushels 10,000
[50:46] bushels or
[50:48] whatever no you got to let the thing
[50:50] grow amen you got to let it grow because
[50:54] an apple tree's inside and mean when
[50:56] that little sprig comes out that's green
[50:57] and tender and barely amen looks like
[51:00] almost almost like a little whatever
[51:02] other any other plant that's out there
[51:03] any other weed amen it comes up it
[51:05] doesn't look like an apple tree with a
[51:07] potential for 10,000 bushels but you got
[51:09] to believe it's there amen you got to
[51:12] let it grow and when it grows it's got
[51:14] the potential inside of it for all of
[51:16] that amen and if it wasn't there it'll
[51:18] never be that yeah but if it's there
[51:22] it's got the potential to be all of that
[51:24] if you let it grow and watch over it as
[51:26] grow and over time it'll develop and
[51:29] it'll put out Limbs and it'll become an
[51:31] apple tree and if you give it time it'll
[51:33] Bloom and if you give it time it'll bear
[51:35] apples amen and you go out to the first
[51:37] season when you begin to Bear apples and
[51:39] you go and you collect all your apples
[51:41] off of this apple tree and you got one
[51:44] bushel he said that man lied to
[51:47] me he told me that was an apple tree
[51:50] with 5,000 bushels that'll produce 5,000
[51:54] bushels but the first growing season
[51:56] only gives you a bushel a bushel and a
[51:59] half see you got to let the thing
[52:02] grow to its full potential amen
[52:08] amen he said
[52:11] now in the message the stature of a
[52:13] perfect
[52:15] man he said it's like a sycamore tree
[52:18] trying to manufacture apples it couldn't
[52:21] do it see although it's a
[52:23] tree but it can't manufacture apples
[52:27] right it's like a church member trying
[52:29] to be part of the
[52:31] Bride although it's a church
[52:34] member to be bride you have to have the
[52:37] genes of
[52:39] bride sycamore tree is a tree it'll grow
[52:42] it'll have bark it'll produce leaves
[52:44] it'll suck up water it'll do so many
[52:46] things that the apple tree does but it
[52:48] can never be an apple tree right because
[52:52] apple tree genetics aren't in the
[52:53] sycamore tree
[52:58] it says it's a tree but it can't
[53:00] manufacture
[53:02] apples it's like a mule trying to
[53:04] manufacture wool trying to be a sheep
[53:06] he's a mule you see he can't manufacture
[53:08] wool he can't do it wool is a gift to a
[53:11] sheep not to a mule he might try to act
[53:14] like a sheep but he's still a mule so he
[53:16] says well I can eat like a sheep I can
[53:18] do this like this sheep and no matter
[53:20] what you can do you've got to be a sheep
[53:22] in order to have
[53:24] wool why because of gen
[53:28] gentics again in Statue of a perfect man
[53:30] he says and let me stop here a minute
[53:32] the Sheep doesn't manufacture
[53:35] wool he has wool because he's a
[53:40] sheep a lot of people try to say well
[53:43] I'll try to get good I'll try to do this
[53:46] don't manufacture
[53:48] nothing no you can't do it a sheep
[53:51] doesn't isn't asked isn't expected to
[53:53] manufacture wool it Bears wool and it
[53:56] doesn't because it's a
[53:57] sheep and when you're a Christian you
[54:00] just bear the fruit of the spirit you
[54:02] don't manufacture it you don't try to
[54:05] make it up don't make yourself something
[54:07] that you're not you just become what
[54:09] you're supposed to be and then it takes
[54:11] care of itself have you heard people say
[54:13] well I tell you I joined a church I
[54:15] really ought to quit this lying you're
[54:17] trying to manufacture something again
[54:19] now you can't do it so there's no need
[54:21] of trying to no more than a mule can
[54:24] make himself have wool can't do
[54:28] it why because a mule has mule
[54:31] genetics and a sheep has sheep genetics
[54:35] amen an apple tree has Apple Tree
[54:37] genetics a syore tree has sycamore tree
[54:41] genetics in the message El Shai from
[54:43] 1960 says what is sin unbelief so when
[54:46] you kill all unbelief why you know
[54:49] that's God's word right then that that
[54:50] he's the same yesterday and forever so
[54:53] all the promises are yours walk through
[54:55] the land it's all yours it belongs to
[54:57] you just enjoy it it's yours God gave it
[54:59] to you the grace of God give it to you
[55:02] it's all yours when the sin question is
[55:04] over you receive the Holy Ghost
[55:06] everything you have need of in life's
[55:08] journey is right there in the Bible for
[55:10] you everything you have need
[55:12] of so when you've received the Holy
[55:15] Ghost and that spark uh the spark is lit
[55:18] and and and the the life of God is
[55:21] embedded in there has come to life and
[55:23] listen everything you have need of in
[55:25] life's journey is there it's already
[55:28] there and everything you'll do for the
[55:30] Lord is there right amen it's programmed
[55:33] in there the fruits of the spirit are
[55:36] programmed in there it's not something
[55:39] that we take and pasted on ourselves
[55:41] amen it's something that has to be a
[55:42] natural flow if it's not a natural
[55:44] outflow then it hasn't come right
[55:47] yet amen
[55:50] amen you can take an apple tree and
[55:54] before it Bears apples it's an apple
[55:56] tree it's ordained to Bear apples but he
[55:58] may get amen may maybe get a little
[56:00] insecure about not bearing apples yet
[56:02] and then he's in the Orchard and
[56:03] everybody else is bearing apples so he
[56:05] can try to you know take some fishing
[56:06] wire and hang some apples off himself so
[56:08] he looks like an apple tree hey that's
[56:10] not going to cut it friends what is that
[56:12] apple tree need to do he needs to have
[56:14] faith in the genetics that's inside of
[56:16] him and in due time the apples will come
[56:18] out amen we don't have to get ahead of
[56:21] the program friends don't feel pressured
[56:23] to be anything that you're not just
[56:25] relax and Trust TR God Amen because if
[56:27] you're a child of God the life of God is
[56:30] going to come
[56:31] out it'll come out amen but when we try
[56:35] to manufacture what we do is we stun our
[56:37] own growth because we get all twisted up
[56:39] inside and we're trying to be something
[56:41] that we're not and actually the best way
[56:43] for things to be produced in our life is
[56:45] for us to actually
[56:47] relax relax and trust God and let the
[56:51] natural process of the spiritual
[56:53] genetics begin to work in our lives
[56:55] that's right
[56:57] so that little poor little apple tree
[56:58] sitting there with all these little
[57:00] apples hanging on his limbs everybody
[57:03] knows he didn't
[57:05] Bloom you have to bloom before you get
[57:07] out I mean and the and the apple trees
[57:10] that have been around for a while
[57:11] they're looking at him and they're going
[57:13] oh poor poor
[57:14] guy I remember when I taped apples to
[57:20] my we've all lived the same kind of Life
[57:24] friends and they don't condemn him
[57:27] because he tied a few apples in the
[57:29] night to his limbs because we all tied a
[57:32] few apples to our limbs when to look
[57:34] like everybody else so we heard some
[57:36] phrases so we just repeated them and
[57:38] when we got in the next Fellowship we
[57:39] didn't even really know what they meant
[57:40] but it sounded really good and everybody
[57:42] got excited when this brother said it so
[57:44] I'll say
[57:48] it I love when the devil's exposed
[57:52] amen and there's an insecurity because
[57:55] he hasn't bore app yet and the question
[57:58] is am I really an apple
[58:01] tree am I really an apple I don't have
[58:03] any apples am I really an apple
[58:05] tree oh praise God that's where we have
[58:09] to know the experience we had with God
[58:11] Amen that God tells us who we are not
[58:14] anybody
[58:15] else that and we don't even have to wait
[58:17] till we see signs of it amen Mary went
[58:20] out confessing that she was bearing CED
[58:22] the Christ child before she felt one
[58:24] thing cuz she believed the angels
[58:26] message to her amen and when we come in
[58:28] contact with the Living God through this
[58:30] message amen and we're awakened to who
[58:32] we really are we have to believe it amen
[58:34] and believe that whatever God planted in
[58:36] me to believe this word I believe it I
[58:39] believe I'm part of this I believe I'm a
[58:40] Child of God I believe this message is
[58:42] for me that God called me to be his
[58:44] bride if I don't have apples yet I will
[58:47] have Apples because he predestinated me
[58:49] to bear fruit there'll be apples on my
[58:52] tree but I'm not going to fake it I'm
[58:54] not going to tie on apples
[58:57] yeah and no matter how insecure I feel
[58:59] and listen friends if you're the only
[59:00] one in the orchard without apples you're
[59:02] going to feel a little
[59:03] insecure but you got to keep going back
[59:05] to the truth that's on the
[59:09] inside and Trust the
[59:15] process let's go to Matthew
[59:18] 28 I want to read a couple scriptures
[59:20] here in Matthew and then in
[59:23] John Matthew 28
[59:33] brother B told us that the Holy
[59:35] Ghost is the power to make the word
[59:39] live so it's the baptism of the Holy
[59:42] Ghost that actually quickens the life
[59:43] that's inside of us and it keeps drawing
[59:45] the life out of us amen it quickens the
[59:48] word it makes the word live so what was
[59:50] it that was in you from before the
[59:52] foundation world it was the word so what
[59:54] makes the word live the Holy Ghost ghost
[59:56] yeah so when you Reed the baptism of the
[59:58] Holy Ghost what did it do it woke you up
[1:00:00] to who you really are it gave you Faith
[1:00:02] to believe that you're a son or daughter
[1:00:04] of God it changed you your thinking your
[1:00:06] outlook on life the direction you're
[1:00:08] traveling in it changed you amen and you
[1:00:11] recognized who you were amen and then
[1:00:14] then that Holy Ghost is still the power
[1:00:17] that brings the word to pass amen what
[1:00:20] word the word that's embedded in your
[1:00:23] soul Matthew 28:18
[1:00:28] 28 and
[1:00:30] 18 says and Jesus came and spake unto
[1:00:33] them saying all power is given unto me
[1:00:35] in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore
[1:00:37] and teach All Nations baptizing them in
[1:00:39] the name of the father and of the son
[1:00:41] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[1:00:43] observe all things whatsoever I have
[1:00:45] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[1:00:47] Always even to the end of the world I
[1:00:50] love this scripture and the reason I
[1:00:52] love this scripture is he says you go do
[1:00:54] this
[1:00:57] right you know what he told them to do
[1:01:00] was like really
[1:01:04] hard he said go therefore and teach All
[1:01:08] Nations how are these
[1:01:11] fishermen with no Financial backing with
[1:01:15] no
[1:01:15] education might not know any other
[1:01:19] languages how are these people going to
[1:01:22] go teach All Nations
[1:01:26] like sometimes the the the expectation
[1:01:31] is so
[1:01:33] high but he finishes it up with now lo I
[1:01:37] am with
[1:01:38] you
[1:01:40] always you're not going to do this by
[1:01:42] yourself you're not going to do this
[1:01:44] without my power you're going to do it
[1:01:45] you're ordained to do it he says I've
[1:01:47] ordained you amen that you'll go and
[1:01:48] bring forth fruit and your fruit shall
[1:01:50] remain they were ordained it was in
[1:01:51] their spiritual genetics to go and take
[1:01:53] the message of Calvary and spread it
[1:01:55] over the world it was already in them
[1:01:57] and he told them to go do it he spoke
[1:01:58] the word over them but he says you're
[1:02:00] not going to do it by your own power
[1:02:02] you're not going to do it by yourself
[1:02:03] but lo I Am With You Always even to the
[1:02:06] end of the world don't worry there's a
[1:02:08] power to make the word embedded in your
[1:02:10] life live and that is the power of
[1:02:12] Christ Living inside of us it's the
[1:02:14] power to make the word live and so God
[1:02:17] has already put it inside of us in our
[1:02:19] genetics and the spirit of God is here
[1:02:21] to draw it out of us and make the word
[1:02:23] that's in us live yeah so go bear
[1:02:29] fruit right that's what you're supposed
[1:02:31] to do yeah go bear fruit that's a
[1:02:33] commandment to you go bear the life go
[1:02:36] bear the fruit go live the life of
[1:02:37] Christ but you're not going to do it by
[1:02:39] yourself don't forget he's with you amen
[1:02:41] amen let's go to John
[1:02:51] 14 John 14
[1:03:01] and John 14 I'd like to read from Verse
[1:03:05] 18 says I will not leave you comfortless
[1:03:09] I will come to you amen let's go to
[1:03:11] verse 20 at that day you shall know that
[1:03:13] I am in my father and ye in me and I in
[1:03:16] you let's go to verse 23 and Jesus
[1:03:19] answered and said unto him if any man
[1:03:21] love me he will keep my words and my
[1:03:23] father will love him and we will come
[1:03:25] unto him and make our Abode with
[1:03:28] him where is the power that makes the
[1:03:31] word live it's in me so my brother said
[1:03:34] when you receed the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:36] Ghost and you were quick anded like a
[1:03:37] spark lit up of something everything you
[1:03:39] have need of is in you for the journey
[1:03:41] from then on Amen because he already
[1:03:44] programmed you through the spiritual
[1:03:46] genetics to do the work for this age
[1:03:48] amen and then he supplied the power to
[1:03:50] bring that program to life amen
[1:03:59] amen let's go to 1 John
[1:04:15] 4:4 there's some things that I find to
[1:04:18] be so helpful to me some understandings
[1:04:20] that the prophet of God gave us for this
[1:04:23] age that we live in because
[1:04:26] if we if we don't understand certain
[1:04:29] things about ourselves then we have a
[1:04:31] hard time correlating the things that he
[1:04:33] told us with the realities that we see
[1:04:35] so we're the sinless Spotless virtuous
[1:04:37] bride of Jesus Christ amen we we are we
[1:04:40] are Christ on Earth we're here to
[1:04:42] manifest the full nature of Christ but
[1:04:45] yet we still live in sticky caer nature
[1:04:49] have flesh and he says it it'll trip you
[1:04:52] up and so it's so good to understand the
[1:04:55] way that we live and 1 John 4 I want to
[1:04:59] read verse 4 he said you of God little
[1:05:02] children and have overcome them because
[1:05:04] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:05:06] that is in the world Amen think about
[1:05:09] that ye are of God little children and
[1:05:11] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:05:14] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:05:19] world what were they overcoming they
[1:05:21] were overcoming the Antichrist
[1:05:24] spirit and
[1:05:26] how are they overcoming the Antichrist
[1:05:27] spirit that was in the
[1:05:29] world because greater is he that was in
[1:05:31] them than he that was in the world Amen
[1:05:34] that's how they were to overcome amen
[1:05:37] let's go to Romans chapter 7
[1:05:51] together Romans chap 7: 21
[1:05:59] Paul says in 7:21 I find then a law that
[1:06:03] when I would do good evil is present
[1:06:04] with me for I Delight in the law of God
[1:06:07] after the inward man but I see another
[1:06:08] law in my members Waring against the law
[1:06:10] of my mind and bringing me into
[1:06:12] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:06:14] my members oh Wretched Man that I am who
[1:06:17] shall deliver me from this body of this
[1:06:19] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:06:22] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:06:25] serve the Lord law of God but with the
[1:06:26] flesh the law of
[1:06:28] sin so the Apostle Paul is explaining to
[1:06:32] us that this this body of flesh is a
[1:06:36] body of death
[1:06:38] right brother brandham i' I've read this
[1:06:41] the last two times I preached this quote
[1:06:43] in the message and knoweth it not when
[1:06:45] he starts to talk about the outside man
[1:06:47] and the senses of the man see taste feel
[1:06:49] smell here he says now that is the evil
[1:06:52] one on the outside
[1:06:56] so the question is where is the
[1:07:02] world greater is he that is in you than
[1:07:05] he that's in the
[1:07:08] world Amen maybe the influences the
[1:07:12] world maybe the evil one like brother M
[1:07:15] said the evil one is the one on the
[1:07:21] outside amen
[1:07:26] and that's the one that must be overcome
[1:07:28] that's the battle that must be fought
[1:07:29] because the Battle Ground is now in the
[1:07:31] mind of man and we know amen we come
[1:07:33] into this condition because of
[1:07:34] hybridization in the beginning and and
[1:07:36] there was a blending of man and animal
[1:07:38] and it Mex messed up the whole thing and
[1:07:41] now the evil one is the
[1:07:45] outside and I'm going to explain that uh
[1:07:48] hopefully here in a couple scriptures
[1:07:49] but I want to read this quote First this
[1:07:51] is from 1964 out of questions and
[1:07:54] answers says somebody told me he had one
[1:07:57] time was converted receiv received the
[1:07:58] Holy Ghost and I said to him how you
[1:08:00] getting along and this is to the Indian
[1:08:01] friend that he
[1:08:02] had he said pretty good and pretty bad
[1:08:05] this is the Indian he called
[1:08:07] Chief this is after he received the Holy
[1:08:10] Ghost he said pretty good and pretty bad
[1:08:15] I said well how do you mean pretty good
[1:08:16] pretty bad and pretty good he said well
[1:08:19] since me received the Holy Ghost he said
[1:08:22] there's been two dogs in me and one of
[1:08:24] them black dog and one of them white dog
[1:08:26] so they argue all the time they growl
[1:08:28] and fight at one another and said the
[1:08:30] white dog wants me to do good and the
[1:08:31] black dog wants me to do bad said well
[1:08:34] Chief which one of them wins the fight
[1:08:36] he said that depends on which one Chief
[1:08:38] feeds the
[1:08:40] most so I think that's a good answer
[1:08:43] here see there just depends on the
[1:08:46] Waring of the body that's in you it
[1:08:48] depends on which one you cater to which
[1:08:51] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[1:08:53] after the things of the world or the
[1:08:54] spiritual nature after the things of God
[1:08:57] that does it I'm so thankful that that's
[1:09:00] in the message yeah amen I don't know
[1:09:02] you but I'm so thankful that's in the
[1:09:03] message because we've been born again
[1:09:05] we've been made new new creatures in
[1:09:07] Christ Jesus all things are passed away
[1:09:08] All Things become
[1:09:10] new but yet I'm struggling with things
[1:09:13] that I don't want to struggle with I'm
[1:09:15] I'm fighting against and resisting
[1:09:17] thoughts and feelings and emotions and
[1:09:19] things that want to take me the wrong
[1:09:21] way and there's a sticky over
[1:09:23] nature brother said that'll always
[1:09:24] bother you amen and the outside man is
[1:09:27] the evil one right but don't forget
[1:09:31] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:09:33] that is in the world amen
[1:09:36] amen why what Spirit do we have brother
[1:09:39] benam said that human Spirit you have is
[1:09:42] a natural Spirit a spirit of the
[1:09:45] world it's a worldly spirit it's a
[1:09:47] spirit that was given to you to interact
[1:09:49] with the world he said it didn't come
[1:09:50] from God but God permitted it is that
[1:09:53] what he said and when you die it'll go
[1:09:55] and be no more so where is it where is
[1:09:58] it it's in the outer man yeah right
[1:10:03] amen and so when we start to think about
[1:10:07] this scripture greater is he that is in
[1:10:09] you than he that's in the world I say
[1:10:12] praise God greater is he that is in my
[1:10:14] soul than he that even were the spirit
[1:10:16] of the world that I have even in the
[1:10:19] flesh that I got through hybridization
[1:10:21] even in even in this uh uh uh evil one
[1:10:24] that I dwell in inside of he that is in
[1:10:26] me is greater than the outside
[1:10:30] man uh let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10:36] 9 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10:39] 9 I'm going to begin reading from verse
[1:10:42] 24 this the Apostle Paul
[1:10:44] now he
[1:10:48] says know you not that they which run in
[1:10:50] a race run all but one receiveth the
[1:10:53] prize so run that you may obtain and
[1:10:55] every man that striveth for the Mastery
[1:10:57] is tempered in all things now they do it
[1:10:59] to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an
[1:11:01] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:11:03] un certain so fight I not as one that
[1:11:05] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:11:08] and bring it into subjection lest that
[1:11:09] by any means when I have preached to
[1:11:11] others I myself should be a Cast Away
[1:11:14] Paul I think recognized the fight yeah
[1:11:17] and I think he recognized where the
[1:11:18] fight was and I think he recognized
[1:11:20] where his enemy was and I think he
[1:11:22] recognized what he needed to do to
[1:11:24] overcome he needed to be diligent he
[1:11:26] needed to be in training he did he just
[1:11:28] couldn't let this body do whatever this
[1:11:29] body wanted to do he couldn't let this
[1:11:31] mind do whatever this mind wanted to do
[1:11:33] but in order to get Mastery he had to be
[1:11:36] temperate or have self-control in all
[1:11:38] things and he had to bring his body into
[1:11:41] subjection amen amen because that's
[1:11:44] where the enemy is and that's what
[1:11:46] brother Brenham says that's what he
[1:11:47] shows us in this little Parable he tells
[1:11:49] about Chief when Chief has the Holy
[1:11:50] Ghost now there's two dogs fighting
[1:11:52] inside of him a white dog and a black
[1:11:54] dog one wants to do do good one wants to
[1:11:56] do bad and he said which one wins the
[1:11:58] fight he said the one that I feed the
[1:11:59] most brother R said that's the way it is
[1:12:01] in the world Amen the one the nature we
[1:12:04] cater to to the
[1:12:05] most and this is what Paul's showing us
[1:12:08] that if we want Mastery if we want to
[1:12:10] win the race and win the prize amen
[1:12:12] we've got to be temperate in all things
[1:12:14] and we've got to bring this body in this
[1:12:17] message in this verse verse 27 he said I
[1:12:20] keep under my body that means to bruise
[1:12:22] or to beat Black and Blue
[1:12:25] yeah so Hey listen that body you dwell
[1:12:27] in is not your
[1:12:28] friend he ain't your buddy right and the
[1:12:32] things he wants aren't good for you and
[1:12:35] the things he tries to convince you are
[1:12:36] true will destroy
[1:12:39] you amen the enem is closer than we
[1:12:42] think right let's go back to First John
[1:12:45] and I want to take a look at
[1:12:47] this and I hope this
[1:12:50] helps 1 John chapter 2
[1:13:02] first John chapter
[1:13:04] 2 verse
[1:13:07] 15 says love not the world neither the
[1:13:11] things that are in the world if any man
[1:13:13] loved the world the love of the father
[1:13:14] is not in him so he told us not to love
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:18] world but look at what he
[1:13:21] says in verse 16 for all that is in the
[1:13:24] world
[1:13:26] so now we're going to find out what's in
[1:13:27] the world what's the world and what's in
[1:13:29] the world the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:13:32] of the eyes the pride of
[1:13:35] life those are all things that are in my
[1:13:38] outside
[1:13:39] man but those are the things that's in
[1:13:41] the
[1:13:42] world but the things that are in the
[1:13:44] world are the things that I struggle
[1:13:45] with in my outside man the lust of the
[1:13:48] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[1:13:50] of life all have to do with the outside
[1:13:52] man yeah so he talks about the world
[1:13:54] he's not talking about out there I mean
[1:13:56] go down the street and you go to this
[1:13:58] side corner and over there's the
[1:14:00] world stay away from the world
[1:14:04] right but all that is in the world is
[1:14:07] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[1:14:09] Flesh and the pride of life where do I
[1:14:13] struggle with that what address do I
[1:14:15] drive to where I struggle with the lust
[1:14:17] of the eyes the lust of us the pride of
[1:14:18] life what evil Place do I drive my car
[1:14:21] to park and go inside of that I struggle
[1:14:23] with this I struggle with that right
[1:14:24] here here in the evil one that I dwell
[1:14:27] in so the world is not as far away as
[1:14:30] you think so don't love the world or the
[1:14:32] things that are in the world but greater
[1:14:34] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:14:36] the
[1:14:37] world amen
[1:14:43] amen let's go to Galatians 5 I know
[1:14:46] we're flipping back and forth but it's
[1:14:48] fun this is our Bible amen this is our
[1:14:51] sword this is this is our strength this
[1:14:53] is what gives us life in this Bible is
[1:14:56] everything we have need of to overcome
[1:14:57] in this journey because it's the word
[1:15:01] and it can all be quickened by the
[1:15:02] spirit Galatians chapter
[1:15:05] 5 verse
[1:15:09] 16 it says this I say then walk in the
[1:15:14] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:15:15] lust of the
[1:15:17] flesh for the flesh lusteth against the
[1:15:20] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[1:15:22] and these are contrary the one to the
[1:15:24] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:15:26] that you would but if you be led of the
[1:15:28] spirit you are not under the law I say
[1:15:31] praise be to God what do I need to do to
[1:15:34] have victory over this evil one is to
[1:15:36] walk in the
[1:15:39] spirit
[1:15:40] amen when you read that the flesh lust
[1:15:43] is against the spirit and the spirit is
[1:15:45] against the flesh that's what Chief was
[1:15:46] describing yeah with his two dogs amen
[1:15:50] analogy that's what Paul was talking
[1:15:53] about when he has to be temper WR keep
[1:15:55] after this body that's what he's talking
[1:15:58] about amen and so we know that the that
[1:16:01] the victory is in the spiritual walk the
[1:16:04] victory is in the inside
[1:16:07] man cuz what is the walking in the
[1:16:09] spirit what is where is the spirit amen
[1:16:12] it's in the Inside Man where is
[1:16:13] overcoming it's in the inside where is
[1:16:16] everything you have need of for this
[1:16:17] journey inside where's the greater one
[1:16:20] that's greater than the world inside
[1:16:22] where's he at inside but I have to walk
[1:16:24] a spiritual life so that what's inside
[1:16:27] can dominate what's
[1:16:30] outside amen let's go uh uh where let's
[1:16:35] go to
[1:16:38] Ephesians Ephesians chapter
[1:16:43] 3 Ephesians chapter
[1:16:50] 3:14 says for this cause I bow my knees
[1:16:52] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:54] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[1:16:56] Earth is named that he would Grant you
[1:16:58] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:17:00] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:17:02] in the Inner Man so how are we going to
[1:17:04] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:17:07] in the Inner Man where's my strength
[1:17:09] going to come from by my spiritual life
[1:17:11] in the inner
[1:17:13] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:17:16] by faith that you being rooted and
[1:17:17] grounded in love may be able to
[1:17:19] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[1:17:21] breadth and length and depth and height
[1:17:23] and to know the love of chist Christ
[1:17:25] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:17:27] filled with all the fullness of God now
[1:17:29] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[1:17:31] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:17:33] think according to the power that
[1:17:36] worketh in us not on us yeah in us not
[1:17:43] to us right in
[1:17:46] US greater is he that is in
[1:17:49] you why because before the foundation of
[1:17:51] the world he planted a seed of himself
[1:17:54] self
[1:17:56] am Amen in in due time he sent the water
[1:18:00] of the word the light of the hour the
[1:18:03] spirit of God to come and Quicken that
[1:18:05] to life and now I can be strengthened by
[1:18:08] strengthened the Inner Man by the
[1:18:12] spirit and now unto him that is able to
[1:18:15] do exceedingly abundantly above all that
[1:18:16] we ask or think according to the power
[1:18:18] that
[1:18:19] worketh in US amen unto him be glory in
[1:18:23] the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:18:25] all ages World Without End amen
[1:18:33] amen amen what do we what do we say all
[1:18:37] this for what are we going in all this
[1:18:38] for because greater is he that's in you
[1:18:40] that's he in the world
[1:18:43] amen amen whatever you're struggling
[1:18:45] with whatever you're going through
[1:18:47] whatever you
[1:18:48] need there's something in you already to
[1:18:51] overcome that why because it's
[1:18:53] programmed into the genetics of God
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:57] amen but when we get in the struggle
[1:19:00] sometimes we go to the wrong
[1:19:03] places I mean sometimes we want Google
[1:19:06] to answer the
[1:19:07] question listen I'm not condemning you I
[1:19:10] want quick answers too I Google
[1:19:12] everything if I want to know how many
[1:19:14] teaspoons are in a cup I'm not going
[1:19:19] to right
[1:19:25] but that's the
[1:19:27] world and that can't give me strength
[1:19:29] and that can't answer my questions and
[1:19:30] that can't solve my problems
[1:19:33] amen but there's already something
[1:19:36] embedded in meise
[1:19:38] God Amen and it it's it's a it's a gene
[1:19:44] let's call it a gene a gene is just a
[1:19:46] certain segment of the DNA and that Gene
[1:19:49] has the information to do whatever kind
[1:19:51] of function or work that it needs to do
[1:19:53] in your body amen there's genes that
[1:19:55] actually uh control how many white blood
[1:19:58] cells you make there's genes that have
[1:19:59] to do with your immune system there's
[1:20:01] genes that that actually replicate that
[1:20:02] and build those proteins so that when
[1:20:04] your body gets in need of something this
[1:20:06] Gene activates and that that Gene
[1:20:08] activates and when it activates it
[1:20:10] brings all the materials together amen
[1:20:11] it rolls together a protein it sends it
[1:20:13] down to become a white blood cell and
[1:20:15] that white blood cell goes out to fight
[1:20:16] the infection that's in your body amen
[1:20:18] it all happens automatically and how
[1:20:20] much do you think about it yeah
[1:20:25] yeah unless you have an autoimmune
[1:20:27] disease you don't ever think about it
[1:20:29] right yeah amen and it's happening
[1:20:33] because it's already in your
[1:20:35] genes it's already there when there was
[1:20:37] a need in your body there's already
[1:20:39] something in the program to meet the
[1:20:40] need yeah amen and the same thing's true
[1:20:44] spiritually you God put a portion of
[1:20:46] himself amen that portion he put of
[1:20:48] himself contains everything we need to
[1:20:51] manifest his ordained purpose in our
[1:20:53] life and when we come against obstacles
[1:20:55] what we need is inside of us amen and we
[1:20:58] might need to hear the word preach Amen
[1:20:59] to unlock what's inside of us we may
[1:21:01] need to have amen an understanding I
[1:21:04] don't know how I mean it comes in many
[1:21:05] different ways but the reality is it's
[1:21:08] not the words from the preacher that
[1:21:10] does it it's the words that the preacher
[1:21:11] that may awaken what's in you but the
[1:21:13] overcoming comes when you're
[1:21:15] strengthened with might in the Inner
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:18] Man and he overcomes in you with his
[1:21:22] mighty power in you yeah that's why we
[1:21:25] can't go to everybody else to be
[1:21:27] delivered we can't go to everybody else
[1:21:28] for all the answers there are gifts in
[1:21:30] the body there are people that you come
[1:21:31] to that'll give Godly counsel but that
[1:21:33] counsel is always by the word the word
[1:21:35] is always there to trigger something
[1:21:37] inside of you that says that's nothing
[1:21:38] but the truth and the spirit of God goes
[1:21:40] to act upon that and bring that out of
[1:21:42] you and bring it to life amen it's not
[1:21:44] what somebody else did for you it's what
[1:21:46] God did in you
[1:21:51] right and that's
[1:21:53] why it's it's so important that we stay
[1:21:56] focused on the inner
[1:21:58] man because that's where overcoming
[1:22:01] really comes from not the honter
[1:22:04] man this is let's go back to Romans now
[1:22:07] I don't really have this in my notes I
[1:22:09] just feel like going and looking at
[1:22:11] it in Romans chapter 7 we read about
[1:22:14] Paul's struggle about who can deliver me
[1:22:16] from this oh Wretched Man I am who can
[1:22:18] delivering me from this body of death
[1:22:21] then at the end he says but I thank God
[1:22:22] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:22:25] and then he goes to chapter 8 and
[1:22:27] chapter 8 is the answer friends
[1:22:29] amen he said 8 verse one there is
[1:22:33] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:22:35] which are in Christ Jesus who walk after
[1:22:37] the F who walk not after the flesh but
[1:22:40] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:22:43] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[1:22:45] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:22:48] for what the law could not do and that
[1:22:49] it was weak through the flesh God
[1:22:51] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:22:53] sinful flesh and forc sin condemn sin in
[1:22:55] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[1:22:57] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[1:22:59] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:23:03] for they that are after The Flesh do
[1:23:04] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:23:06] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:23:08] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:23:11] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:23:14] life and peace because the carnal mind
[1:23:17] is enmity against God for it is not
[1:23:19] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:23:21] can be so then they that are in the
[1:23:23] flesh cannot please God but you are not
[1:23:26] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[1:23:28] that the spirit of God dwell in you now
[1:23:30] if any man have not the spirit of Christ
[1:23:32] he is none of his and if Christ be in
[1:23:35] you the body is dead because of sin but
[1:23:36] the spirit is life because of
[1:23:38] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:23:40] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:23:42] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:23:44] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:23:46] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:23:48] you he says he'll also Quicken your
[1:23:50] mortal bodies when brother bandom comes
[1:23:52] to this he's not just talking about the
[1:23:53] future when you'll have a
[1:23:54] Transfiguration or a resurrection he's
[1:23:56] talking about now when it will Quicken
[1:23:58] your body why did he say he says how do
[1:23:59] you know you used to smoke you used to
[1:24:01] drink you used to be addicted tobacco
[1:24:02] you used to have all of these lust
[1:24:04] problems didn't you but what happened
[1:24:06] now because the spirit quickened your
[1:24:08] body to what to manifest the word amen
[1:24:11] by what power by the power that's in
[1:24:14] you
[1:24:17] amen so so what is the answer to walk in
[1:24:21] the
[1:24:22] spirit what Paul was realizing that he
[1:24:25] must be tempered in all things and
[1:24:27] control this flesh and keep it
[1:24:30] subject that this is the evil one this
[1:24:33] is where the world resides this is where
[1:24:36] I'm struggling with the
[1:24:39] world sometimes we
[1:24:42] think we think if we don't go to bad
[1:24:45] places we didn't go to the
[1:24:47] world well of course that is the world
[1:24:49] it's a manifestation of worldly things
[1:24:51] absolutely it's not a wrong statement
[1:24:54] but sometimes if we if if we keep our
[1:24:57] kids at home we kept them from the world
[1:25:00] but you can keep them home and keep them
[1:25:01] in the world right cuz what is in the
[1:25:05] world the lust of the eyes the lust of
[1:25:06] the flesh the pride of life yeah now
[1:25:08] don't get me wrong I think we should
[1:25:10] keep our kids amen from worldly
[1:25:11] influences absolutely amen especially
[1:25:14] until they come to the time that they
[1:25:15] have the Holy Ghost for themselves we
[1:25:17] have to take responsibility for him
[1:25:18] because their little Spirits pick up on
[1:25:19] all those wrong things so we're
[1:25:21] responsible to keep that separated from
[1:25:23] them amen so don't misunderstand what
[1:25:25] I'm saying but we have to understand
[1:25:27] that the real power is not going to come
[1:25:29] from the boundaries that we put up amen
[1:25:31] that's just temporarily there to hold
[1:25:33] those influences off of them and keep
[1:25:35] them free from it as long as we can
[1:25:37] until they can be born again by the
[1:25:38] spirit of God and then the Overcomer is
[1:25:41] on the inside of them
[1:25:43] amen but we have to understand that and
[1:25:46] understand where the enemy is and where
[1:25:47] the power to overcome is if we don't
[1:25:50] understand where the enemy is then we
[1:25:51] don't realize what's passing through our
[1:25:53] brains is what's tripping us up right
[1:25:56] and we also don't realize amen that what
[1:25:58] God is stirring by his spirit in my soul
[1:26:00] is what I'm Overcoming By so then we we
[1:26:03] get tripped up and don't knowwhere we're
[1:26:04] tripped up and then we run to somebody
[1:26:06] else to try to save
[1:26:07] us and we're getting all messed
[1:26:11] up because greater is he that is in you
[1:26:14] there's a seed in you amen there's a
[1:26:17] life in you to bring everything in that
[1:26:20] seed to
[1:26:21] life and the message leadership the
[1:26:24] prophet says what what a rebuke to
[1:26:26] Christianity we're supposed to represent
[1:26:28] God in eternal life there's only one
[1:26:30] form of eternal life and that's God he
[1:26:32] alone has eternal life and we are
[1:26:34] products of his because we're genes of
[1:26:36] his Spirit then we should conduct
[1:26:38] ourselves women and men like the Bible
[1:26:40] said for us to do not Jezebels of the
[1:26:42] street and rickes of the organization
[1:26:44] but Christian gentlemen Sons and
[1:26:45] Daughters of God born of the spirit of
[1:26:47] God manifesting the light in our days
[1:26:50] and scattering it
[1:26:55] it comes and this is a a a message from
[1:26:57] 1954 I want to read you this quote from
[1:26:59] the message called show us the
[1:27:01] father he said that's the way the man is
[1:27:04] that's born of the spirit of God when he
[1:27:06] takes God's promise into his heart and
[1:27:08] look the only thing that God does is
[1:27:11] plant you in Jesus Christ by the Holy
[1:27:13] Ghost and everything you have need of in
[1:27:15] this Earth's journey is in you when you
[1:27:18] receive the Holy Ghost amen the only
[1:27:20] thing you have to do is draw and push
[1:27:23] out
[1:27:25] I tell you what's the matter with
[1:27:26] Christians tonight you're not drawing
[1:27:28] dividends on your baptism of the Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost draw in and drink and drink and
[1:27:36] drink and drink till you push out
[1:27:39] salvation push out Divine Healing push
[1:27:42] out the baptism of the Holy Ghost just
[1:27:44] drink and drink and drink and you're
[1:27:47] planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of
[1:27:50] Life which is Jesus Christ he that's
[1:27:52] thirsty let him drink
[1:27:54] him that Hearth say come whosoever will
[1:27:57] let him come drink from The Fountains of
[1:28:00] Water of Life freely amen what a
[1:28:02] beautiful thing of him here God in his
[1:28:04] word God's got to keep his
[1:28:09] word what do we need to do we need to
[1:28:11] drink in the spiritual life what
[1:28:15] empowers our spiritual life the word of
[1:28:17] God Amen brother said the Holy Ghost
[1:28:19] feeds on the word amen we've got to
[1:28:21] drink in and receive the word receive
[1:28:24] the spirit of God Amen re receive the
[1:28:27] things of God and keep drinking in and
[1:28:30] let that produce what's on the inside
[1:28:33] and push out everything that's in the
[1:28:36] word we can't hang it on the outside
[1:28:39] like an ornament it's got to come from
[1:28:41] the
[1:28:42] inside but guess what it's there it's
[1:28:46] already
[1:28:49] there he
[1:28:50] says in Statue of a perfect man again he
[1:28:53] says well now that's the way it is
[1:28:55] trying to manufacture Christianity
[1:28:56] Christianity you can't do it the first
[1:28:59] thing you've got to do is be born again
[1:29:00] you've got to be changed and when you're
[1:29:03] changed you become a new creation now
[1:29:05] you're getting right now you don't have
[1:29:07] to worry about the feathers it'll take
[1:29:09] care of itself when you're born again he
[1:29:12] said it's like a crow trying to take
[1:29:13] peacock feathers and and put peacock
[1:29:15] feathers and be a peacock he said
[1:29:17] they'll just fall
[1:29:18] out you can't or a dove amen trying to
[1:29:21] uh uh somebody trying to emulate a dove
[1:29:23] and a crow trying it's not going to work
[1:29:25] amen but you don't have to worry the
[1:29:27] feathers will take care of themselves
[1:29:29] you don't have to say well I want to do
[1:29:31] the works of God I got to do the work
[1:29:32] the works of God will produce itself in
[1:29:34] your
[1:29:35] life if you just drink from
[1:29:39] Christ why because it's already in
[1:29:42] you again in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:29:45] he says after you've done come from here
[1:29:46] to here to here to here what are you
[1:29:48] talking about stature of a perfect man
[1:29:49] growing up Faith Temperance uh
[1:29:51] longsuffering all of these things virtue
[1:29:54] he's talking about growing he says when
[1:29:56] you done come from here to here to here
[1:29:58] to here to here now you're coming into
[1:30:00] the full stature now of a Son of God but
[1:30:02] you got to have this plus all of this
[1:30:04] and you can't even start till you get
[1:30:06] this he's pointing down to Faith now
[1:30:08] remember the black bird with peacock
[1:30:10] feathers don't forget him don't try to
[1:30:12] add it till you're actually born again
[1:30:14] CU it won't work and you can't make it
[1:30:16] work it'll come to this or this here
[1:30:18] it'll crumble somewhere but when you get
[1:30:21] down here a genuine Born Again Dove then
[1:30:24] you don't add nothing it adds to you see
[1:30:28] comes on up all right coming into
[1:30:30] Perfection now he's talking about
[1:30:32] stature for man growing growing into the
[1:30:34] very likeness of Christ amen starting
[1:30:36] and and coming through these virtues
[1:30:38] these virtues are already in the seed
[1:30:41] amen amen you say well I just need more
[1:30:45] Temperance I can't go any further until
[1:30:46] I get Temperance Temperance where you
[1:30:48] going to get Temperance where are you
[1:30:49] going to go find it amen go go go buy
[1:30:52] another dose of it go get somebody lay
[1:30:54] hands on you for it where are you going
[1:30:55] to get Temperance from Temperance comes
[1:30:57] from the life of God inside of you we
[1:31:00] just got to drink and push it out
[1:31:02] remember you're an apple tree there's
[1:31:04] going to be apples on your tree amen
[1:31:07] there's it's going to get there the
[1:31:09] fruits will come don't manufacture don't
[1:31:11] get nervous don't get Hasty be patient
[1:31:14] and keep drinking in the word amen keep
[1:31:19] surrendering and and the trumpet gives
[1:31:21] an uncertain sound he said if the Church
[1:31:23] of the Living God God is the Church of
[1:31:24] the Living God it'll put forth the word
[1:31:26] of the Living God you don't have to add
[1:31:29] peacock feathers nowhere and even
[1:31:30] feather in there will be joined to a
[1:31:32] peacock you can believe that and every
[1:31:35] feather that's joined into the Church of
[1:31:37] God will be the word of God you will
[1:31:39] never inject anything else but the word
[1:31:41] amen because the nature of the spirit
[1:31:43] puts out only the
[1:31:45] word so what is the nature of the spirit
[1:31:47] do inside it pushes out the word praise
[1:31:50] God in the message God hiding himself in
[1:31:53] simplicity
[1:31:54] says you don't ask sheep to Bear wool or
[1:31:56] manufacture wool the Sheep don't have to
[1:31:59] manufacture wool so now my master wants
[1:32:01] me to have some wool this year I got to
[1:32:03] get busy no the only thing he has to do
[1:32:06] is just remain a sheep that's right the
[1:32:09] wool will automatically it will he will
[1:32:12] bear it because and we're not asked to
[1:32:14] manufacture fruits we're supposed to
[1:32:16] produce fruit bear fruits we are
[1:32:19] supposed to Bear fruits and as long as
[1:32:21] you are a fruit tree of God with God's
[1:32:23] word god word will vindicate itself
[1:32:25] it'll bear fruit as long as the word's
[1:32:28] in
[1:32:30] there amen and Jesus said if you abide
[1:32:33] in me and my word in you ask what you
[1:32:34] will it shall be done see you don't
[1:32:36] manufacture it you work you you work
[1:32:39] yourself not up to it it's just actually
[1:32:41] there and it goes on and
[1:32:44] on why do we keep listening to tapes why
[1:32:46] do we keep coming to preaching why do we
[1:32:48] why because we're walking in the spirit
[1:32:50] because we need to nurture this life on
[1:32:52] the inside because it's the life on the
[1:32:53] the inside is where the overcoming power
[1:32:56] is and where God is working mightily in
[1:32:58] us to produce his own life not from the
[1:33:01] outside in From the Inside Out
[1:33:08] amen listen if we
[1:33:11] want abundance of apples on an apple
[1:33:15] tree then then you know you have to
[1:33:18] start with an apple tree can't start
[1:33:21] with a pear tree or a peach tree have
[1:33:23] start with an apple tree tree amen and
[1:33:25] if the apple seed goes into the ground
[1:33:26] and under the right condition it comes
[1:33:27] forth and begins to grow listen every
[1:33:31] Apple that'll ever be on that tree is in
[1:33:34] that tree then it's in the
[1:33:38] sea but the way you tend the life of
[1:33:41] that Apple will determine how much it'll
[1:33:43] produce yeah
[1:33:45] amen that Apple needs water that Apple
[1:33:49] needs light that apple tree needs
[1:33:52] nutrition and there's times that the
[1:33:54] apple tree needs
[1:33:57] pruned you just let it go wild and don't
[1:33:59] tend to it and'll never reach its full
[1:34:03] potential but in order for it to reach
[1:34:05] its full potential it needs a husbandman
[1:34:07] it needs a farmer and every once in a
[1:34:09] while that Farmer's got to whack a few
[1:34:10] limbs
[1:34:13] off praise be to God Amen when God comes
[1:34:16] in and he does a pruning on us and wax a
[1:34:18] few limbs off amen it's never to destroy
[1:34:21] us amen remember when Jesus says amen
[1:34:23] the husbandman of the vine amen when the
[1:34:25] vine bears fruit then he purgeth it yeah
[1:34:29] that it might bear more fruit amen he
[1:34:31] didn't Purge it because he was angry you
[1:34:33] bore some just a little fruit I didn't
[1:34:34] get no he purged it so it bear more
[1:34:37] fruit and there's times that God will
[1:34:39] come and Purge our life trim off dead
[1:34:43] trim off extra trim off access trim off
[1:34:45] anything that's not what he wants amen
[1:34:48] why because what he wants us to do is
[1:34:49] bear fruit it needs a little tending
[1:34:52] amen if if we're going to get all the
[1:34:54] fruit that it has the potential for when
[1:34:56] you look in the Natural Life of Sheep
[1:34:58] amen you want sheep to produce wool when
[1:35:00] you want wool production and you want to
[1:35:02] use the lamb then you've got to take
[1:35:04] care of the
[1:35:06] use they got to have water they got to
[1:35:08] have nutrition they got to have a
[1:35:10] peaceful environment in which they can
[1:35:11] grow wool you can't stand there over
[1:35:13] every day over them and say bear me wool
[1:35:15] and wool doesn't grow you whack them
[1:35:16] over the head with the stick they're
[1:35:18] never going to Bear wool that's right
[1:35:21] amen amen amen but if it's not a sheep
[1:35:25] it's never going to Bear wool
[1:35:28] anyways so if you take something that's
[1:35:30] not a sheep let's say you take a goat
[1:35:32] you put it in the pen and you say if I
[1:35:34] just give this super tender loving care
[1:35:37] the best nutrition and the best love and
[1:35:39] I massage it every day and I play
[1:35:41] classical music you're not going to get
[1:35:43] any wool amen it's not a sheep y but if
[1:35:48] I take care of the sheep the Sheep will
[1:35:49] produce wool amen cuz it's in the Sheep
[1:35:52] to produce wool amen if I don't take
[1:35:54] care of the sheep it may produce wool
[1:35:56] but it won't produce as much wool cuz it
[1:35:58] won't be
[1:35:59] healthy this is why our spiritual health
[1:36:02] is so
[1:36:03] important I mentioned to you the immune
[1:36:06] system that works in your body produces
[1:36:07] red or white blood cells they go out
[1:36:09] they fight infection they do all the
[1:36:10] things that they're supposed to
[1:36:13] do I don't know about you I mean I never
[1:36:16] have you may have but I never woke up in
[1:36:18] the morning and
[1:36:19] says Gene number 342 you need to get
[1:36:22] into action I feel feel a little tingle
[1:36:24] in my throat I'm activating you
[1:36:30] now it just does it
[1:36:33] automatically because that's what it's
[1:36:34] there
[1:36:35] for there's a need and it goes into
[1:36:37] action and a need and I don't control my
[1:36:40] immune system my immune system just
[1:36:42] works but I can do things that have a
[1:36:45] positive or negative effect on my immune
[1:36:47] system amen right y if I eat horrible if
[1:36:52] I sleep horrible if I abuse my body if I
[1:36:56] do all these things then I have an
[1:36:58] immune system and my immune system is
[1:36:59] going to try to do what it's going to do
[1:37:00] but it's going to be less effective in
[1:37:03] doing what it needs to do I'm going to
[1:37:04] be sicker all the time right but if I do
[1:37:07] the things that that I knew to take care
[1:37:09] of my body if I do the right things my
[1:37:11] immune system will work more effectively
[1:37:12] if I get good sleep if I have good
[1:37:14] nutrition if I have exercise if I if I
[1:37:16] have good water if I have all the good
[1:37:18] things I need I have a good atmosphere
[1:37:19] and less stress and all of these things
[1:37:21] if I get in that good atmosphere then
[1:37:23] the the immune system that's already
[1:37:24] there and already designed to work will
[1:37:26] work more effectively
[1:37:28] amen isn't it super simple yeah there's
[1:37:32] a spiritual genetics inside our soul
[1:37:35] that to overcome every obstacle in our
[1:37:37] life but the way we take care of our
[1:37:39] spiritual life it can make it more
[1:37:42] difficult more effective or less
[1:37:44] effective and we all know that's the
[1:37:46] truth yeah it's just simply the truth if
[1:37:49] we we binge eat on garbage and worldly
[1:37:51] entertainment and things of the world
[1:37:53] and our conversations are never centered
[1:37:54] around the things of God we haven't
[1:37:56] taken time in meditation and in prayer
[1:37:58] Devotion to God and feeding on the word
[1:38:01] amen then we're going to keep being
[1:38:02] spiritually sick all the time right amen
[1:38:05] amen it doesn't mean we're not a son of
[1:38:07] God it doesn't mean the seed's not there
[1:38:09] it doesn't mean you're not supposed to
[1:38:10] be the brid tree and you're not supposed
[1:38:11] to bear fruit but the problem is you
[1:38:13] still have an evil one on the outside
[1:38:16] and that dog needs starved amen that's
[1:38:20] right that's the reality that's why you
[1:38:22] know you could we could go along and we
[1:38:24] can make all kinds of rules and say
[1:38:26] don't ever watch this and if you're
[1:38:28] going to watch any YouTube amen make
[1:38:30] sure it's only these sites and only for
[1:38:32] 10 minutes and blah blah blah blah blah
[1:38:34] listen I have no desire to pleas
[1:38:36] that but the reality is if you stay away
[1:38:40] from those things or limit your time on
[1:38:41] it for what you need and you stay
[1:38:43] focused on the spiritual side you'll be
[1:38:45] spiritually healthy that's why there's a
[1:38:47] Temptation sometimes to make regulations
[1:38:49] and rules amen because you know the
[1:38:51] reality that if you do do this you're
[1:38:54] going to suffer if you do this you're
[1:38:55] going to be blessed yeah
[1:39:00] amen right it's just the
[1:39:03] truth if I avoid fellowship if I stay
[1:39:06] with my mind twisted up and entangled in
[1:39:08] things of the world if I feed on things
[1:39:10] that feed the lust of the flesh the
[1:39:11] pride of life the lust of the eyes amen
[1:39:13] and then all of a sudden I come into a
[1:39:15] spiritual obstacle I've not been walking
[1:39:18] in the spirit I've been tending to the
[1:39:20] Flesh and these two are at war with one
[1:39:21] another I'm going to be struggling
[1:39:23] spiritually why and why am I struggling
[1:39:25] so hard spiritually because we got to
[1:39:27] walk in the
[1:39:29] spirit and we shall not fulfill the lust
[1:39:31] of the
[1:39:33] Flesh and not a law not legalism
[1:39:37] reality the truth the true understanding
[1:39:40] that it's already embedded in me it's
[1:39:43] not that I'm broken or I'm wrong and I
[1:39:45] need God to come fix me what I need to
[1:39:47] do is I need to eat right sleep right
[1:39:51] exercise right amen and it will work
[1:39:54] that's why Paul said that he said
[1:39:57] Christian must be temperate in all
[1:39:59] things why because I've got an objective
[1:40:01] I've got a goal he's run a race he has
[1:40:05] self-control and so it's
[1:40:07] already what do you have need of it's
[1:40:10] already inside
[1:40:12] you it's already there friends but I've
[1:40:15] struggled with for the for years the
[1:40:17] answers inside you right I can't seem to
[1:40:20] overcome this the answer if you're a
[1:40:22] child of God born again Again by the
[1:40:23] spirit of God the answer is inside of
[1:40:25] you the Overcomer is inside of you he
[1:40:28] that's greater is he that's in you than
[1:40:30] he's in the world he's already there
[1:40:33] yeah that's why the thing that I can do
[1:40:35] if I as your brother and your friend and
[1:40:37] your pastor could ever encourage you in
[1:40:38] any way I would encourage you to spend
[1:40:40] as much time with the Lord as you
[1:40:42] possibly can we live in a world that's
[1:40:45] full of distractions and it's it's it's
[1:40:47] designed that way we're never going to
[1:40:49] change it we've got to work we've got to
[1:40:50] tid family we got to mow grass you got
[1:40:52] to shovel driveway at this time of year
[1:40:55] there's things that absolutely you have
[1:40:56] to do that take your time and attention
[1:40:58] there's no way of getting around it and
[1:40:59] you shouldn't feel guilty for doing
[1:41:01] those things God planted you in this
[1:41:03] life but we've got to be temperate in
[1:41:05] all things and understand that if I'm
[1:41:08] going for Mastery if I'm going to live
[1:41:09] for Christ if I'm going for a healthy
[1:41:11] spiritual life amen then I've got to
[1:41:14] feed I've got to drink I've got to take
[1:41:16] in good water good nutrition good
[1:41:19] light I got to have rest if your body
[1:41:23] going to be healthy you have to have
[1:41:24] good rest if you want sheep to Bear wool
[1:41:25] they have to have rest how am I going to
[1:41:27] come to rest I only can come to rest in
[1:41:29] the presence of
[1:41:31] God when I take time out of my
[1:41:34] day sometimes I I so enjoy talking to
[1:41:37] some of the the folks who have served
[1:41:39] God all their lives and they're at the
[1:41:41] end of life I remember my wife and I we
[1:41:44] were speaking to Betty Stoner one time
[1:41:45] and many of you remember Betty she was
[1:41:47] 90 some years old when she passed away
[1:41:50] and before she did she fell and she
[1:41:52] fractured her hip and she was bed fast
[1:41:55] she was stuck in bed she couldn't get
[1:41:57] out of bed and but she told us we were
[1:41:59] there visiting and she said oh I love to
[1:42:01] read so I'm thinking oh I know what I'll
[1:42:04] do for Betty we'll get some good books
[1:42:06] and we'll find some stuff and you know
[1:42:07] cuz she's stuck in bed so we asked her
[1:42:10] sister Betty what is it you like to read
[1:42:12] you know we'd like to get you some books
[1:42:13] she goes oh spoken word books
[1:42:20] huah what was her favorite thing to read
[1:42:23] spoken word books not a novel not a love
[1:42:26] story not an adventure not a Sci-Fi and
[1:42:29] listen I'm not condemning if you read
[1:42:30] anything else I read other things and
[1:42:32] enjoy it so I I for recreation I love to
[1:42:36] read a book I'm not that's so you
[1:42:39] understand you love me I love you you
[1:42:41] know me I know
[1:42:44] you but when she said that all of a
[1:42:46] sudden my heart just did something
[1:42:48] exciting me she lived her all of her
[1:42:50] life and come to the end of her life and
[1:42:52] she knew the thing that was most
[1:42:56] needful you go talk to the old-timers
[1:42:58] that have been in this message for 40 50
[1:43:01] 60 years they're always talking about
[1:43:04] the message they just listen
[1:43:09] to they're always talking about the book
[1:43:11] they read the message they listened
[1:43:14] to I think maybe they learned
[1:43:18] something you get to the end of life you
[1:43:20] don't have the physical strength you had
[1:43:21] you don't have the mental strength that
[1:43:23] used to have you can't cover everything
[1:43:25] in life by your
[1:43:27] youthfulness weakness starts to creep in
[1:43:30] and it will for all of us and as
[1:43:32] weakness Creeps in we begin to realize I
[1:43:34] can't do what I used to do I can't care
[1:43:36] for myself I can't make it happen I
[1:43:38] don't have what I used to have I don't
[1:43:40] think like I used to do I don't act like
[1:43:41] I used to do what is it I need more than
[1:43:43] anything I need him more than anything I
[1:43:45] need he that's greater in me than he
[1:43:47] that's in this world because this guy is
[1:43:49] letting me down what I used to depend on
[1:43:52] to earn my Amen to fix things that were
[1:43:54] broke to overcome challenges in my life
[1:43:57] I used to depend on this
[1:44:00] flesh I used to when I was in my 20s
[1:44:03] when I was in my 30s I could work around
[1:44:05] the clock there was days that I put in
[1:44:07] 40 some hours at work and I never slea
[1:44:09] and I was still
[1:44:10] fine and my my Montage was always work
[1:44:14] harder if you got a problem work harder
[1:44:16] you need more money work more hours if
[1:44:18] you got to overcome something you just
[1:44:19] work that's all you got to do is work
[1:44:21] amen what happens when you can't work
[1:44:24] anymore you realize for many of us in
[1:44:27] our youthful years we were relying on
[1:44:29] the outer man we were relying on our own
[1:44:31] intellect and our own strength and our
[1:44:32] outer man and we could always overcome
[1:44:34] obstacles because we were still young
[1:44:36] and still vibrant and we could still
[1:44:37] think and we could still process we
[1:44:38] could still
[1:44:41] do that's why the most glorious time in
[1:44:44] a child of God's life is when those
[1:44:45] leaves are changing
[1:44:48] colors cuz maybe they've learned a few
[1:44:50] things along the way I can't walk like I
[1:44:53] used to I can't overcome I can't I can't
[1:44:56] build a house
[1:44:57] anymore can't R roof my house I can't
[1:45:01] fix my car like I used to I amen so what
[1:45:05] are we left with I need God I need the
[1:45:09] spirit of God to lead me every day of my
[1:45:12] life oh God help me to get
[1:45:15] there now am I said God help you if
[1:45:19] you're 15 16 17 19 20 21 God help you
[1:45:23] get there now because God never intended
[1:45:26] for man to shift for himself he wanted
[1:45:29] to be completely relying upon
[1:45:31] God where is your overcoming power in
[1:45:34] you amen where is he that overcometh in
[1:45:36] you how will he overcome by might in the
[1:45:39] Inner
[1:45:41] Man where is everything that I have need
[1:45:44] of coming from that which is inside of
[1:45:46] me you know what I need to do more than
[1:45:49] anything more than get up early and work
[1:45:50] more hours what I need to do is get up
[1:45:52] early and talk to him longer spend more
[1:45:55] time aligning my thinking with his
[1:45:57] thinking read his word pray meditate
[1:45:59] just think on him listen to good things
[1:46:02] listen to sermons listen to music do
[1:46:04] something to defeat the Inside Man so
[1:46:07] that I could drink and drink and drink
[1:46:09] and then I'm not God there's nothing for
[1:46:10] me to put on on the outside there's
[1:46:12] nothing for me to correct or make happen
[1:46:14] what needs to happen will come from the
[1:46:16] strength from the inner
[1:46:19] man greater is he that is in you than he
[1:46:23] that's in the world that's nothing but
[1:46:25] the truth
[1:46:27] friends and the evil one is that body
[1:46:29] you live in and the world is influencing
[1:46:33] that body in your mind all the time the
[1:46:36] lust of the eyes the the lust of the
[1:46:39] flesh the pride of
[1:46:41] life so where am I going to overcome it
[1:46:44] not through more mind not through more
[1:46:46] intellect not through more willpower

[1:46:51] overcome it with the Inside

[1:47:12] apple tree can do that's all that sheep
[1:47:14] can do is feed on the good grass that
[1:47:16] the Good Shepherd leads him to because
[1:47:19] the Good Shepherd knows what grass
[1:47:20] produces wool and what grass makes him
[1:47:23] sick right if the Sheep's left to
[1:47:26] himself he'll do things to himself amen
[1:47:28] that causes him to not bear wool not be

[1:48:26] bushels all that was in the seed from
[1:48:28] the beginning has been made manifest and
[1:48:32] what did that tree do just took in the
[1:48:35] light took in the water and the
[1:48:37] nutrients and pushed out from the
[1:48:39] genetic life that was
[1:48:41] inside everything God wants us to do is
[1:48:43] already inside of
[1:48:45] us the works were finished before the
[1:48:48] foundation of the world we were created
[1:48:49] in Christ Jesus and the good works which
[1:48:51] God before ordained that we walk in them
[1:48:53] it's already seal it's already known God

[1:48:56] and he's put it inside the seed inside
[1:48:58] of
[1:48:59] you and the message you must be born
[1:49:01] again he says I

[1:50:10] enough fruit in my life or somebody can
[1:50:13] start condemning you because you don't
[1:50:14] have enough fruit in your life the
[1:50:17] reality is what are you going to do

[1:50:48] time to Bear the fruit of Christ in this
[1:50:49] world Amen we need time with the Lord
[1:50:52] with the the word every day brother B
[1:50:55] said a a a Christian prays and reads his
[1:50:57] Bible every day he has
[1:50:59] to why because there's got to be
[1:51:01] something to feed that life inside of
[1:51:03] him to give him
[1:51:06] strength now listen I'm not also saying
[1:51:08] that to condemn you either I've skipped
[1:51:11] days brother brandham skipped days I got
[1:51:14] it on
[1:51:15] tape brother Neville asked him to come
[1:51:19] hunting and he gets to the pull pit he
[1:51:21] says haven't even opened my b for two or
[1:51:23] three
[1:51:26] days why cuz he was down hunting and

[1:51:30] time with the
[1:51:33] Lord so it's not about I read in my
[1:51:36] Bible every day check off the list I'm
[1:51:38] it's not that

[1:51:42] the mentality that's right it should be
[1:51:46] I need more of that life yeah amen I
[1:51:49] need more water I need more light I need
[1:51:52] more nutrients I need to be in that
[1:51:55] presence so that my spirit can relax
[1:51:57] because at rest I can bear wool at rest
[1:51:59] I can bear
[1:52:01] fruit I need to connect with him so that
[1:52:04] my spirit can calm down I need to
[1:52:06] connect with him to get the light and to
[1:52:07] get the water everything that I need of
[1:52:09] to bear fruit I can't just produce and I
[1:52:12] just can't say fruit magically appear it
[1:52:14] doesn't work that way but if I can get
[1:52:16] myself in a healthy spiritual condition
[1:52:18] by walking in the spirit I won't fulfill
[1:52:20] the lust of the flesh I won't be
[1:52:21] dominated by the Black Dog the outer man
[1:52:24] and the white dog will begin to win the
[1:52:26] fight it's so simple that we neglect to
[1:52:30] do it
[1:52:31] right it's so simple but it has such
[1:52:40] power we just need to
[1:52:43] feed Peter tells us as newborn babes we
[1:52:46] should we should desire the sincere milk
[1:52:49] of the word we need to how does a baby
[1:52:53] grow by
[1:52:55] eating Peter tells us in second Peter to
[1:52:57] grow in the grace and knowledge of our
[1:52:59] Lord Jesus Christ we're intended to grow
[1:53:03] grow into the reflection of Christ grow
[1:53:06] where is it it's in the seed gen that's
[1:53:08] in your
[1:53:09] soul where's the power going to come
[1:53:12] from where's the intelligence where
[1:53:14] where is everything it's already inside
[1:53:16] of you we just got to keep it in the
[1:53:19] right conditions for it to grow and
[1:53:22] it'll produce everything he intended it
[1:53:25] to
[1:53:27] produce don't look at yourself in a
[1:53:30] stage of growth and say I'm
[1:53:32] not just because you look like a little
[1:53:34] sprig that's coming out just because you
[1:53:37] haven't bloomed yet just because you
[1:53:38] don't have as many apples as the
[1:53:40] neighbor has listen you know what's more
[1:53:42] important than any of that is
[1:53:44] recognizing you're an apple
[1:53:46] tree yeah you may be next to the other
[1:53:51] you you know Sister self-righteous and
[1:53:54] she tells you how many bags of wool the
[1:53:56] farmer got off her this
[1:53:58] year all the great things she's done for
[1:54:00] everybody and gets up early and bakes
[1:54:02] bread for her whole house and polishes
[1:54:05] her husband's shoes and takes care of
[1:54:08] everybody and and you look at her big
[1:54:10] bag of wool and you look at your little
[1:54:12] bag of wool say I haven't done much for
[1:54:15] the
[1:54:17] Lord you know what that's not the most
[1:54:20] important thing to realize the most
[1:54:23] important thing to realize is I'm a
[1:54:25] Sheep amen I'm a sheep yeah I may not
[1:54:28] bear as much wool I may not look make it

[1:54:40] and come into the Earth to Bear
[1:54:44] wool so what do I need to do maybe I
[1:54:47] just need to change my diet amen my

[1:55:04] spiritual Life of Christ we have no
[1:55:05] Christ to push
[1:55:08] out don't take in nutrients and water
[1:55:10] and Sun the plant has nothing to give
[1:55:13] out if we don't bring it in we have
[1:55:16] nothing to push out we need to focus on
[1:55:18] bringing it in and then let the genetics
[1:55:21] of God work everything out

[1:56:21] my body will take care of itself that's
[1:56:23] right and I'll grow into the stature
[1:56:25] God's ordained me to grow and I'll
[1:56:27] eventually hit where God wants me to hit
[1:56:29] and I'll be as tall or somewhere in
[1:56:31] average of the other guys there's
[1:56:34] nothing you can do to make it happen
[1:56:35] there's nothing you can will it to

[1:58:05] this last quote as we
[1:58:07] finish and the message things that are
[1:58:09] to
[1:58:10] be brother benam says now the only way
[1:58:13] that you can be a son or daughter of God
[1:58:14] is because you have to have eternal life
[1:58:17] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:58:19] life and that's God's life only one form
[1:58:21] of eternal life life that was God there
[1:58:23] to be a Son of God you had to be in him
[1:58:26] always the gene of your life spiritual
[1:58:28] life tonight was in God the Father
[1:58:30] before there was even a
[1:58:31] molecule and you are nothing but the
[1:58:34] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:58:35] was in God as a Son of God now you're
[1:58:39] expressed after his word has come into
[1:58:41] you to light up this age you expressing
[1:58:45] God's life in you because you are a son
[1:58:47] or a daughter of God therefore you get
[1:58:50] what I mean I want to read that sentence
[1:58:53] again now you're expressed after his
[1:58:56] word has coming to you what allowed you
[1:58:58] to express when his word came into you
[1:59:02] to do what to light up this age you are
[1:59:04] expressing God's life in you because
[1:59:08] you're a son or daughter of God not
[1:59:10] because you decided to but because it
[1:59:13] was already inside of you therefore you
[1:59:15] get what I mean you see you are now made
[1:59:17] you're sitting in this church tonight
[1:59:19] because your duty is to express God to
[1:59:21] this Nation this people this
[1:59:24] neighborhood where you associate
[1:59:26] wherever you go God knew that you would
[1:59:28] be here because you have to be one of
[1:59:30] his genes or his attributes you had to
[1:59:32] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[1:59:34] life then it's always was eternal life
[1:59:36] and God before there was a foundation of
[1:59:38] the world knew that you would be here
[1:59:40] and when the word or the water the
[1:59:42] washing of the water of the word fell
[1:59:43] upon you it was expressed in a being now
[1:59:46] you have fellowship with your father God
[1:59:48] just as you have with your Earthly
[1:59:49] father you're a citizen of the king not
[1:59:51] a citizen but you are children Sons and
[1:59:53] Daughters of the Living God if it be
[1:59:56] that eternal life dwells in

[2:02:32] together dear heavenly father we thank
[2:02:34] you Lord for your good word and God
[2:02:37] we're so thankful for this message that
[2:02:39] puts in perspective Our Lives
[2:02:41] Lord Lord Our Lives before the opening
[2:02:44] of the seals was mysterious
[2:02:46] misunderstood we didn't know whether we
[2:02:48] were in or out or up or down or we
[2:02:51] didn't know how to deal with the outside
[2:02:52] man versus The Inside Man the black dog
[2:02:54] and the white dog but God you came and
[2:02:57] you peeled off the layers of confusion
[2:03:00] so that we could see the
[2:03:01] truth God now that truth has been given
[2:03:04] to us for a reason so that we can rest
[2:03:06] in your process and Trust in your
[2:03:09] ways God I believe that I'm speaking to
[2:03:12] True seeds Lord true sheep that you've
[2:03:15] called to Bear wool to manifest your
[2:03:17] life in this hour and Lord it's such a
[2:03:19] difficult task to manifest your life to
[2:03:22] reflect you to be Jesus Christ on the
[2:03:24] earth lord it's more than we as human
[2:03:26] beings can accomplish our minds can't
[2:03:28] even fathom how to accomplish that God
[2:03:30] it's beyond our thinking it's beyond our
[2:03:32] willpower it's beyond our
[2:03:34] ability but God we're not depending on
[2:03:36] any of that we're trusting in the seed
[2:03:38] that you planted in our soul before the
[2:03:39] foundation of the world that you've
[2:03:42] genetically programmed us to be you in
[2:03:44] this age to manifest you reflect you in
[2:03:47] this world so God I pray that you'd help
[2:03:49] us to continue in the way of life that
[2:03:52] you spelled out for us to continue to
[2:03:55] drink in of your spirit to receive your
[2:03:57] word to pull into our souls all that you

[2:04:11] that you've given to us to lay down our
[2:04:13] hearts and rest in your presence knowing
[2:04:15] that you have everything taken care of
[2:04:18] we don't have to stress we don't have to
[2:04:19] be nervous we don't have to be anxious
[2:04:21] because you're a heavenly father that
[2:04:23] has planned out our lives may we rest
[2:04:26] Lord and then this good grass that
[2:04:28] you've given us in this message Lord
