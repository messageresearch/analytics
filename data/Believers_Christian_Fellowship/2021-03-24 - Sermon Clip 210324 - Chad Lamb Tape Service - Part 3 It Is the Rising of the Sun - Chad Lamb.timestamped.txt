[0:07] he said we already he already made us
[0:09] pay for our sins when we were with him
[0:11] in the calvary
[0:13] and that's why brother branham gets gets
[0:15] down and he says
[0:16] it's not that he will it's not

[0:45] everything struck against it there's
[0:46] nothing that can foul it up there's no

[0:57] from here back there with no
[0:58] obstructions
[1:01] what a security that's been given to us
[1:03] there's no hope so in this friend
[1:05] there cannot be a hope so if there's a
[1:08] hope so then we've got to go back to a
[1:10] fundamental revelation and say god
[1:12] i need the assurance of the baptism of
[1:14] the holy ghost to quicken to me the
[1:15] reality that my name is written on that
[1:17] lamb's book of life
[1:19] so that i quit hoping that i'll make it
[1:21] we can't hope that we'll make it
[1:22] we have to know that we've already made
[1:25] it that when he was on calvary
[1:27] i that life that's in me now was there
[1:29] yeah
[1:31] it's secure it's finished amen
[1:36] praise god if we're still in the cycle
[1:38] of hoping
[1:39] and failing and restoring and hoping
[1:41] amen we need to say god
[1:43] i need a deeper revelation i need an
[1:45] assurance that comes from the baptism
[1:47] holy ghost
[1:48] that i know that i know that i know that
[1:50] it's finished for me
[1:52] and then i'm secure
