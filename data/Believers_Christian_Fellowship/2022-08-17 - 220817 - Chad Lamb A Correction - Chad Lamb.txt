you would take over and take control and have your way lord manifest yourself through us speak through these lips and accomplish your purpose in our lives and all things for we surrender all to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen may god bless you we're going to ask you to have your seats starting off thank you musicians that'll be all amen i don't really intend to preach tonight i just want to talk to the congregation for a little bit there's a there is a mistake that i've made and a declaration that i made that i need to retract and i'd like to take a little bit of time and explain that and i'd like to make things right many of you will remember not all of you were here at the time but many of you were you'll remember that about two and a half years ago in february of 2020 i had a service here on a wednesday night and during that service i was preaching about gifts and i was preaching about offices in the church and during that service i made a declaration and i declared unto you that god was rising up a gift amongst us and our brother rich levy and i had declared him to be a prophet in the office of a prophet and i realized now that that was a mistake that i shouldn't have done it i shouldn't have handled things that way and i was it was an error in making that declaration and i would like to retract that statement officially and i'd like to take a few minutes and explain to you why i retract that what the mistake was how i made that mistake and and see if god will just lead us from there um [Music] before that time before february 2020 there was quite a period of time maybe a year or more where the brother was coming to me with many spiritual experiences dreams and visions and audible voices from the lord and they were really quite dynamic they were uh amazing and it had been happening for quite some time and there was a number of those events and they were very supernatural very spiritual and so i had been hearing this from him for a while and one of those supernatural events one of those dreams that he had was a spiritual dream i mean was the dream about the two cylinders and he had shared that with the congregation and as we moved into the first of the year into january going into february of 2020 many of you know that in december that's when the coronavirus began to make news about what it was doing in china and began to move out of china and start to make its way across asia and into europe and there was quite a tension in the air because something was happening something on a global order and something with a lot of significance to it and during that time there was a discussion and there was some points being made that if this is a dream from the lord sent to help the people at this time how can we keep it from the people and i begin to think and ponder those things and think would it be right for me to be the only one to know these things and and and with the tension mounting and the things that were happening i decided to move forward and to let the congregation know what had been going on to make the declaration that i made about our brother and and then praying and trusting that god would bring clarity and that god would interpret the dream and if you remember i asked the congregation at that time to be praying that there was a significant dream that the brother had had and praying that god would bring an interpretation of the dream but after you know about a month there was still nothing that it came no interpretation of the dream and there was still this i'd say this continuation of the rolling of coronavirus through the uh european countries through the european continent and coming into america and we knew that things were getting difficult and there was shutdowns and all kinds of things at that time and it was a it was a disturbing time and i had this this i guess this pressure that i felt that if this was something of the lord and i didn't give it to people and it was something to help the people that i if it was and everything happened and it came out later that i somehow would be guilty of withholding a good gift from the people and so i began to think along those lines and i began to under that pressure that i was feeling i moved forward and i asked brother rich to share the dream with the congregation and many of you were there and remember in the fellowship hall sometime towards the end of march he shared the dream and i really want to apologize for that because it wasn't right for me to do that because i asked the brother to share a dream that had no interpretation and at the end of the night there was no conclusion and i feel like looking back that all of that dead was so confusion into the assembly because by the end of the night and by the end of the discussion we still didn't know if this dream had anything to do with coronavirus or not we still didn't know if it did what it meant for us as individuals or us as an assembly there was no conclusion there was no answer and i felt like what i hoped would be help there was really in the end no help for the assembly because there was nothing there was no takeaway there was no action there was nothing that we could gain from that and and so we moved on from there and you know how things transpired through 2020 and into 2021 and and i began to um i could say really begun to be troubled by why god never gave an interpretation when we were all praying for one why if we i really believed in myself that if god gave a gift and we received a gift that god would bless us for receiving a gift i really felt like that if we would just receive what god had then god would give more and if we received it the way god gave it then if we needed interpretation god would send it so i began to be perplexed on why there seemed to be no conclusion no vindication i felt like if we received it god will back it up god will vindicate it but no vindication came no clarity ever came in fact things just continued to get more murky and more unclear and and i felt more unclear and unsettled in myself as time went on and then i realized one day i was reading christ is the mystery of god revealed and this is when uh i had a bit of an awakening and i realized where my stake my mistake was and in christ as the mystery of god revealed in paragraph 332 i was reading and it says who did the word of the lord come to prophet alone that's right is that right and the prophet had to be vindicated first not not because he said he was a prophet because he was born a prophet and proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then everything else let go and as soon as i read this i actually got out of my seat and got on my knees and began to repent and said god i got ahead of your word because the instructions that we receive here from a prophet are based on the word of god that the prophets not to be received until he's vindicated a prophet first and he says furthermore not not because he says he's a prophet because he's born a prophet and proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then everything else let go and suddenly in a moment of time i realized what grave mistake that i had made that i without having vindication first had made a declaration and a presentation to the congregation and believing within myself that god would back up what i was saying with a vindication and with an interpretation and i got it completely backwards in the word i was supposed to get the vindication first amen and then that was god backing it up and then we could receive a prophet and then all the blessings and everything that would come with that would be on it because we'd be in line with the word and so without meaning to and in my ignorance and in my haste and under pressure i realized i got ahead of the word of god and i took action was not appropriate not correct and then i've been mourning over this realizing that i put the congregation in quite a bit of a spiritual tension because i came to the congregation on that february wednesday evening and i declared to you a declaration of what was going on in the assembly one of our brothers in the gift in the office that that would hold but i gave no vindication that would allow you to receive that gift i basically i was asking you to take it on my word and that was wrong that was completely wrong that was never god's way and i didn't mean for it to be that way but that's the way it ended that night because there was nothing else to go with the declaration only i'm telling you this is what's happening and then you you were asked then to believe what i said but i never offered the vindication that must always associate this gift and so i just want to say that i'm sorry i'm very very sorry i know that it created a spiritual tension amongst the body i know that it was wrong and that i'm sorry for the repercussions i'm sorry for the spiritual tension i'm sorry for the confusion and i just want to ask that you would forgive me for this kind of mistake and i and and pray that i never make a mistake like this again because it's been it's been quite agonizing to realize that um with all the efforts to stay on the word that i got off the word with all the desire to keep a church lying to the word and receiving the gifts of god and obeying god and moving with the spirit i got ahead of the spirit of god and i got outside the word and i led a whole congregation away from the word and and expected them to follow me and accepting something that i should have never declared and so i'm sorry and you know as we move from here unfortunately brother rich and i are not in agreement on the direction i'm taking or on how to move forward but i believe this is the right thing to do and i'm asking god to continue to bring us clarity deliver us from ourselves and help us to stay lined up with the word in all things i've i've learned some tremendous lessons and i've learned that the word of god is pure it is perfect it is right in every way and every idea of man is flawed there's a message called standing in the gap where the prophet of god comes and he begins to explain we know it quite well he begins to explain a situation he found himself in under rejection he was wanting to run away and go into the wilderness and all of this and god corrected him but towards the end of that sermon he makes this statement he says we're on our road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere and at first when i read that it comforted me i thought well praise god the prophet of god make a mistake who am i but my comfort very quickly faded away when i realized the impact of that statement it's the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere and then i realized sincerity is not enough sincerity desire study effort is not enough without god we're nothing if god doesn't help us and lead us if god doesn't correct us and open our eyes we're finished we can do nothing literally jesus said without me you can do nothing and that is so literally true i realize that i am completely helpless pathetic without the spirit of god and that the mistake i made i didn't mean to i was sincere i can say it was a mistake and i can say with all the of my heart it was an honest mistake but yet it was a serious mistake and all of that it was serious it has reconcussions it means something and so you know now i realize sincerity effort desire will all fall short there's a scripture that i read and i want to read to you out of psalms 127 verse 1. it says except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman wakeeth but in vain and it's interesting when you look at the beginning of this psalm psalm 127 there's a title like before many psalms that gives the author or the writer or or something about the psalm and right at the beginning of the psalm it says a song of degrees for solomon so this song was for solomon written to solomon and we know solomon to be the wisest that there was on the earth up to this time and even jesus referring back to the wisdom of solomon as being the greatest amen when he would declare a greater than solomon is now here and solomon also was the greatest king that israel ever had he had the most power the most wealth the most established kingdom he had peace on every side and every enemy was subject to him there was no danger in solomon's time because ev the enemy had been subjected there was prosperity there was peace it was the golden age of israel and in all the power and in all the wealth and in all the wisdom this saw this psalm was written for solomon except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain listen we're helpless without god we are in ourselves in our flesh we are no match for the devil we are no match for the fertility the wisdom of the enemy amen we can we can walk around with a bible in one hand and a message book in the other and if god doesn't open our eyes to the solution in that word we're going to fall flat on our faces reading the bible and reading the message every day of our lives we will read past our solution a hundred times and never see it if god doesn't open our eyes amen we will we will we will try with every effort to do the very best we can and if god doesn't stop us in our tracks we'll go on and make a huge mistake we are desperately dependent upon god and if anything i've learned is how pathetic we are and how wonderful god is and how desperately we need him in every area of our life we need the spirit of god or we will fail in zechariah chapter 4 verse 6 it says then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts the only way that we will overcome the only way not overcome i'll rephrase that the only way that we will survive is by the spirit of god by the leadership of the holy ghost in our lives by god intervening to stop us from failing by god opening our eyes to our mistakes by god bringing correction when we've gone wrong my god stopping us before we go wrong by god opening his word it is the only way that we will survive in this life without god we will fail we are failures to begin with we are in bodies that are fallen and failed and minds that are fallen or failed and it doesn't matter how gifted we are it doesn't matter how talented we are it doesn't matter how many years of experience we have without the ever present that without the ever-present spirit of god we will fail we can serve god 30 years and fail and so i've learned that there's nothing i can do without him and i'm dependent on him and i need to be comfortably dependent upon him and so i just i'm going to ask tonight i don't there's no no preaching no desire to preach but just to pray we need to pray for god's leadership we need to pray for god i've been praying and asking god to forgive me and been repenting from my failures and asking god to keep his sheep through it all and we just need to pray there's not a man alive that we can trust in i hate to say that but there's not a man alive we can trust in only christ can we trust him there's not a gift or a gifted person that we can sit back and rest in we have to trust in god giving us his leadership and there's not a church that we can trust in for without god leading every step the church will fail the pastor will fail the ministers will fail the officers will fail we are we are so dependent on god i just would like to take some time this evening before we're dismissed and just pray together and earnestly pray pray that god would forgive us and god would keep us i really covet your prayers i pray that god would you would ask god to guide me step by step and let me be more sensitive to a spirit than i've ever been before and that god would give me revelation and god would give me you know the correct answer to every question because there are there are questions every day there are decisions to make and and i'm a little gun-shy i'm a little fearful to pull the trigger i just need you to pray that god would give us clarity give us vision give us his vision his discernment give us the right understanding of his word and the right application for that word because we need him to do so and i'm going to ask you two to pray for the officers of the church the deacons and trustees and pray for the ministers that have to break the bread of life amen it's a fearful thing for a fallen human being to have to handle something so perfect and so precious and try their best not to ruin it we need to pray for one another we need to pray for the gifts among us we need to pray for our song leaders and for our musicians because i can tell you the devil would love to enter in any place he could enter in and bring a disruption and get us off the word if there's not one place it'll be another place and if this door is closed he's constantly shaking the doors to find where he can get in and we need to bind ourselves together and pray for one another there's not a gift among us that's not susceptible there's not a gift among us that's not in danger of being misled and misleading others and so we need to pray and i just pray that you would forgive me and and pray for me and i will pray for you man let's all stand together i'm going to ask josiah decide if you can come forward i just want to sing one song together and i want to go to prayer and and we're not going to get back together and dismiss we're just going to pray you're welcome to pray at your seat or pray at the altar i'm going to be spending some time at the altar asking god to keep us and you're welcome to join me who all would like to pray if you need to be dismissed you can be dismissed any time you want we won't have a dismissal when you're done praying you're welcome just to dismiss yourself and go as you feel led to go and we will we will trust in the only one who can keep us we will put our confidence in the only place to put our confidence that almighty god who proved that he loves us by sending us his word will to be the one that keeps us in that word you can have the word but if he doesn't keep us in the word will fail in the word and i believe with all my heart we've got the true word the vindicated word the pure word but without him showing us revealing to us that word we're going to fail and so we need to pray for one another and i'm asking to earnestly pray that god would help us i'm sorry for any confusion that we caused in the assembly i'm sorry for anybody that was hurt i'm sorry for the spiritual pressure that we put on individuals i'm sorry for the spiritual pressure that i put on brother rich by moving forward for the spiritual pressure in his family i'm sorry i'm sorry for every negative effect that this decision has made i'm really really sorry and i pray that god would cover a multitude of sins and that god would heal and god would restore god will fix anything is broken and wrong god will bring clarity wherever there's confusion because i can't do it but i'm depending on him to do the part that we can't do so before we go to prayer i'm going to ask y'all to sing with me can we sing song 200 holy spirit that are welcome in

heart let's keep praying for one another let's never get relaxed and pretend that there's no more enemy and everything's fine and everything will go fine and everything's in order and everything is fine that nobody will ever make a mistake or be misled the potential is always there friends just pray pray for the ministry pray for the pastor pray for the song leaders pray for everybody that has a
