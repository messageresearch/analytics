[0:00] so now Boaz does what he has to do and
[0:03] he's in his claiming Ministry and now he
[0:05] comes
[0:06] he comes to Ruth and Ruth has been
[0:11] gleaning Ruth has now got received a
[0:14] promise uh uh at the new day Ruth has
[0:17] received the six measures of barley and
[0:20] her veil and and now she's rejoicing in
[0:22] that
[0:23] but if Ruth stays with the six measures
[0:27] of barley
[0:28] and never goes to the seventh
[0:31] redemption's not finished
[0:36] it's good barley
[0:38] it's good word it's a heapingful it's
[0:42] something to Rejoice about it's
[0:43] something to be glad in but if we stay
[0:46] with the with with the six seals amen
[0:49] and miss the seventh seal amen then all
[0:51] of a sudden we're still going to wind up
[0:53] in darkness and coldness of winter
[0:55] because this will run out but there's
[0:57] something that's greater
[1:01] and that's the seventh seal which the
[1:04] seventh seal is not a doctor in the
[1:06] Seven Seals of person
[1:09] and the seventh seal is the lord of the
[1:11] Harvest
[1:12] he's the one who gave the six
[1:15] and brother Graham said I'm not the one
[1:17] who opened those seals he opened those
[1:19] seals who the lord of the Harvest the
[1:22] lord of the Harvest and the new day gave
[1:24] the six measures of barley amen but
[1:27] where was the seventh measure it wasn't
[1:29] going to come like the other six
[1:32] have you read that your church have you
[1:34] read the sales book amen the the first
[1:37] seal there's a whole lot of wheat
[1:39] psychics you know they're a whole lot of
[1:40] wheat you go through them all Amen in
[1:42] tying these scriptures together types
[1:44] and shadows showing all of this and you
[1:46] get to the seventh seal and at the end
[1:48] of the seventh seal you're like where's
[1:49] the barley
[1:51] where's the heaping scoop where is it
[1:54] amen you got to look past the scoop to
[1:55] the hand that's holding the scoop
[1:57] because that's when the seventh seal
[1:58] starts to appear
[2:00] and it's the person it's the lord of the
[2:02] Harvest it's the person of the word it's
[2:04] the one who opened the word he's the
[2:06] seventh seal and now in the day of
[2:08] redemption she's got the six measures of
[2:10] barley that's just to show that he's not
[2:12] going to stop until he's done
[2:17] but when he's done he's going to come
[2:19] and take that little bride and they're
[2:21] going to go into a secret room
[2:24] and a third pool in a private chamber
[2:27] and they're going to have an invisible
[2:29] Union that nobody else is going to see
[2:30] and in that visible Union she's going to
[2:33] get the seventh measure of seed and
[2:35] that's not going to be another Doctrine
[2:37] that's not going to be that seventh
[2:39] measure of seed is going to be the
[2:41] person of the word the lord of the
[2:44] Harvest in her
[2:49] and until we come to that point we
[2:52] haven't come to Redemption
[2:56] that's why to wait on the seventh seal
[2:59] is dangerous
[3:00] to deny the seventh seal is dangerous
[3:04] there's nothing wrong with rejoicing
[3:06] over the sick I mean let's Rejoice over
[3:09] the six but once you get the seventh you
[3:12] never have to worry about running out of
[3:14] the six amen because the lord of the
[3:16] Harvest owns the field owns the weed
[3:18] owns the Garners owns it all and he's
[3:20] constantly giving more barley more
[3:23] barley more but you're never going to
[3:25] run out because you are part of the lord
[3:27] of the Harvest you have come as a joint
[3:29] Heir and now there's no fear of the dark
[3:32] winter cycle there's no fear of the
[3:34] apostasy of the seventh age because the
[3:36] lord of the Harvest is your husband he
[3:38] is you and you are him and he is now in
[3:41] you he's injected his seed into you
[3:44] and now you're carrying the seventh seal
