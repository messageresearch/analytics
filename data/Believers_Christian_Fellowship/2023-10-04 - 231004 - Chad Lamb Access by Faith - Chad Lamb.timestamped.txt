[18:09] these lips under your control and speak

[18:38] fun we go straight from Retreat to
[18:41] special after Retreat
[18:43] meetings so while we're standing let's
[18:45] take our Bibles and turn to Second
[18:49] Timothy this reminds me of the
[18:52] past we were in here about 18 years ago
[18:55] and so a lot of memories flooding back
[18:58] and so we thank God when the sound
[19:01] system they're they're not finished
[19:02] they're still doing some connecting and
[19:04] some tuning to that should be ready to
[19:06] go by Sunday but while they're finishing
[19:08] that I thank God we got a place we can
[19:10] still gather and hear the word so this
[19:13] place is just waiting here to be used
[19:16] amen uh let's look at second
[19:19] Timothy
[19:24] 1:9 who hath saved us and called us with
[19:27] a holy calling
[19:28] not according to our works but according
[19:30] to his own purpose and Grace which he
[19:33] has given us in Christ Jesus before the
[19:36] world began man God bless you as you
[19:39] take your
[19:42] seats just want to say once again what a
[19:45] wonderful time we had at The Retreat for
[19:47] all those who were able to gather there
[19:49] it was quite a blessing and and really
[19:51] had great impact on me I felt like I
[19:53] grew quite a bit so I thank God for the
[19:56] word that was preached and for the
[19:57] fellowship that we shared but as I was
[20:00] giving thank yous I forgot one and I

[22:06] sister-in-law sister Anna Marie we bring
[22:08] greetings to everybody they're in
[22:09] fellowship with them down there so many
[22:11] of you remember them when they were here
[22:13] that's good also I want to say hi to
[22:15] Sister Karen Sanders God bless you she's
[22:17] here with uh some friends of hers some
[22:19] friends that we just met brother Derek
[22:21] and sister Denise right and their family
[22:24] so it's good to have you guys here and
[22:27] so what a Time visit this isn't what
[22:29] it's normally like so this is a special
[22:32] visit on a special day but praise God
[22:36] anyhow amen when um when I come to this
[22:39] service I was thinking about the weekend
[22:42] and um something struck me and many
[22:44] things struck me of course but I was
[22:46] wanting to take something that brother
[22:48] Eugene had said early on uh I think it
[22:51] was Friday night and uh I wanted to
[22:54] capitalize on it because there was so
[22:56] much that was said I felt like through
[22:58] the weekend there was so much new
[23:01] revelation and new understanding so much
[23:03] territory being gained it was almost
[23:05] like the borders were just pushed wide
[23:06] open for us and I don't want to just
[23:08] blow by that but I I have a desire in my
[23:11] heart to go back over that again so that
[23:13] we don't lose what God had showed us I
[23:15] really want to spend some time in that
[23:17] and there was something that he said
[23:18] Friday night that I just wrote down and
[23:20] he didn't spend a lot of time on it and
[23:22] I thought I want to go back because I
[23:24] don't want to miss that there was a
[23:25] profound statement that he made and I
[23:27] don't want to miss that so I'm going to
[23:28] do that tonight Lord willing so we
[23:31] started in 2 Timothy 1:9 and it says who
[23:36] has saved us and called us with a holy
[23:39] calling not according to our works but
[23:42] according to his own purpose and Grace
[23:44] so now the the reason that God has
[23:47] called us was not because of us as far
[23:50] as our ability or our works or anything
[23:52] that we've done or earned but according
[23:54] to his purpose and Grace and his grace
[23:57] is his love expressed so that's why
[24:01] we're saved and that's why we're called
[24:03] uh that's the single reason is because
[24:05] he purposed before the foundation of the
[24:07] world and he extended Grace
[24:10] amen so so with that I want to come to
[24:13] Romans chapter 5 so let's turn so keep
[24:15] your Bibles handy we're going to go to
[24:17] quite a few scriptures here really
[24:19] quickly but this next one will be Romans
[24:21] chapter
[24:26] 5
[24:30] and this is the scripture that brother
[24:33] Eugene had us turned to Friday night
[24:35] when he made this statement that struck
[24:37] me in chapter 5 verse one of the book of
[24:40] Romans it says therefore being justified
[24:42] by faith we have peace with God through
[24:44] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we
[24:47] have access by faith un to this Grace
[24:50] wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope
[24:53] of the glory of
[24:55] God uh and when brother Eugene read that
[24:58] if you'll remember he says we have
[25:00] access by faith so the access we have to
[25:04] God's grace and this purpose the access
[25:06] is Faith how do we get in touch with
[25:09] that Grace how do we get in touch with
[25:10] God's purpose amen it's through faith
[25:13] amen and God bless you brother Derek
[25:15] sister Farah I'm sorry we can't even get
[25:17] you into a regular service yet you just
[25:20] move here and go to retreat and then
[25:21] come here but hey just be patient amen
[25:24] you'll get you'll get into the main
[25:26] sanctuary eventually
[25:28] we're just testing you to see if you'll
[25:29] hang with
[25:31] us so therefore being justified by faith
[25:37] that's an interesting statement
[25:38] justified by faith because we know that
[25:41] by his blood he justified us so are we
[25:44] justified by faith or we justified by
[25:46] his
[25:48] blood the answer is yes so I'll just
[25:51] give it to you now the answer is yes
[25:54] amen we are saved by grace amen but
[25:57] we're saved by his blood brother B says
[25:59] over and over we're saved by the blood
[26:00] of God Amen but but we know that we're
[26:03] saved by faith and is it by the blood or
[26:05] is it by faith and the answer is yes
[26:08] because where's my access what's my
[26:10] access to all that God has given me all
[26:13] that God has provided for me I could
[26:14] never provide for myself God has
[26:16] provided but where do how do I access
[26:19] what God has given me and the access
[26:21] point the portal the door is
[26:24] Faith praise God so this is the
[26:27] scripture that he opened with and when
[26:29] he went into that
[26:30] subject and then let's go to back to
[26:33] Ephesian uh Ephesians chapter
[26:37] 2 and then we're going to come back to
[26:41] Romans Ephesians chapter
[26:47] 2 verse
[26:50] 8 Ephesians 2 and8 for by grace are you
[26:53] saved through
[26:55] faith and that not of yourself eles it
[26:58] is the gift of
[26:59] God so if you ever had Faith to believe
[27:03] if you ever have faith to access the
[27:05] things of God that was a gift of God it
[27:08] also wasn't something we earned or
[27:10] worked our way into or had willpower
[27:12] enough to uh come to Faith that also was
[27:14] a gift of God Amen and God We Know by
[27:17] the message of the hour that God Amen
[27:19] planted a seed of predestination within
[27:22] us and that seed of predestination was
[27:24] his Gene his attribute his word a
[27:26] portion of himself and that's what we
[27:28] believe with amen not with our mind and
[27:31] not with our will and we believe with
[27:33] that part of God he's deposited in us
[27:35] before the foundation of the world Amen
[27:37] so you know remember when brother bam
[27:39] talked about um the woman at the well in
[27:42] Samaria who comes to the woman at the
[27:44] well amen and immediately she begins to
[27:46] recognize this is a special gift
[27:48] speaking to me and she goes I perceive
[27:50] you're a prophet and when when she
[27:51] perceives he's a prophet she wants to
[27:53] know the right way to worship God
[27:55] because a prophet can tell her the right
[27:56] way to worship God
[27:58] God and after that he begins to discern
[28:00] her life and and and and and he begins
[28:02] to tell her about the father seeketh
[28:04] such this worship Him these that Worship
[28:06] in spirit and in truth and then she goes
[28:08] Messiah cometh and when he comes he'll
[28:12] tell us these things and then all of a
[28:14] sudden Jesus said I am
[28:16] he she dropped her water pot and went
[28:18] running into the city to tell them all
[28:21] that she had heard and she said is not
[28:23] this the Messiah she believed amen but
[28:26] but the Pharisees brother man went and
[28:28] compared the Pharisee the Pharisee
[28:30] looked at him do the signs and wonders
[28:32] show the sign of the Messiah connect the
[28:34] dots on the word and the Pharisees said
[28:36] you're be elub she said you're
[28:40] Messiah and what brother B said she had
[28:44] representation in heaven she had
[28:45] something to believe with the Pharisee
[28:48] had nothing to believe with but she had
[28:50] something to believe with amen and
[28:52] listen the faith that she had amen that
[28:55] was given to her of God was her ACC
[28:57] access to the grace that was available
[28:59] in that day because the Pharisee had
[29:02] nothing to believe with he had no C Gene
[29:04] of eternal life he had no access to the
[29:06] mercy that was in his
[29:08] day amen to the grace that was available
[29:11] he could not access it because he could
[29:14] not
[29:15] believe let's go back to
[29:22] Romans Romans chapter
[29:26] 4
[29:31] Romans 4 and:
[29:33] 16 therefore it is a
[29:36] faith that it might be by Grace so
[29:40] listen God gave it by Grace not by works
[29:44] but by his eternal love for his elect
[29:47] that's Grace so he wanted it to be by
[29:50] Grace so he had to have a mechanism to
[29:52] where he can make it by Grace not works
[29:55] not effort not abilities not not
[29:57] anything you would do but strictly by
[29:59] his grace but he can he has to have the
[30:01] grace out there because he wants to give
[30:03] it by Grace but he's got a way he has to
[30:06] have a mechanism by which he can get
[30:09] this Grace only to the elect and not
[30:12] to the
[30:14] nonel so he has to come up with a
[30:16] mechanism or an access point he gives
[30:18] the grace now there has to be an access
[30:20] to that Grace and so he makes the access
[30:23] by faith am let's read it
[30:25] again there therefore it is of faith
[30:29] that it might be by grace to the end the
[30:32] promise might be sure to all the seed
[30:35] not to that only which is of the law but
[30:37] to all that also which is of the faith
[30:39] of Abraham which is us the faith seed
[30:42] who is the father of us all God wanted
[30:45] to make sure that you would get this
[30:46] grace and so the the mechanism by which
[30:49] you access this grace is by faith so he
[30:52] deposited a portion of himself in you a
[30:55] part of the word so when the word came
[30:56] con contact with the word it could
[30:58] believe the
[31:00] word and that would be our access to
[31:04] Grace oh praise be to God let's turn
[31:07] over to First Peter we're going to do
[31:10] some flipping back and forth but oh it's
[31:13] good 1 Peter chapter
[31:21] 1 1 Peter chapter
[31:26] 1 verse
[31:31] three blessed be the God and father of
[31:33] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[31:36] His abundant Mercy hath begotten us
[31:37] again unto a lively Hope by the
[31:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[31:41] dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[31:45] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[31:47] reserved in heaven for
[31:50] you it's interesting what would your
[31:52] inheritance reserved in heaven for you
[31:56] be
[31:59] we'll move
[32:01] on who are kept by the power of God
[32:05] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[32:08] revealed in the last time amen so what
[32:12] are we kept by the power of God are you
[32:15] kept by the power of God how are you
[32:18] kept by the power of God through
[32:20] faith you understand that it's not it's
[32:23] the power of God keeping us we can't
[32:25] keep ourselves but how do we come in
[32:27] contact with the power of God how does
[32:29] the power of God keep us the power of
[32:31] God keeps us through faith so how are we
[32:34] saved by grace through faith how do we
[32:37] access grace through faith amen all of
[32:39] this is through faith it is the portal
[32:41] it is the mechanism it is the access to
[32:44] all the things that God has and now
[32:46] Faith is the access to the power of
[32:50] God I mean think about it when brother
[32:52] vom told us he said if if he said if
[32:55] Jesus Christ was standing here on on the
[32:57] platform wearing this suit that I'm
[32:59] wearing today amen he could do no more
[33:01] for you than I can Bo I mean you talk
[33:04] about a statement brother that's an
[33:06] unbelievable statement he said if he was
[33:08] standing here in the suit and you come
[33:09] to him and said Jesus heal me he said I
[33:11] can't heal you I already healed you
[33:13] 2,000 years ago you have to accept it by
[33:16] faith or access it by faith because the
[33:20] power for healing has already been made
[33:22] plain the power for healing has already
[33:24] been purchased amen but the a to that is
[33:27] by
[33:29] faith
[33:31] amen let's go all the way back to Romans
[33:34] chapter
[33:43] 1 Romans chapter
[33:47] 1 verse
[33:50] 16 Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not
[33:54] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[33:56] is the the power of God unto salvation
[33:59] so is the gospel of Christ the power of
[34:01] God to
[34:03] absolutely unto salvation to everyone
[34:08] that
[34:10] believeth think about
[34:13] that the gospel of Christ is the power
[34:17] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[34:22] believeth am but what if you don't
[34:25] believe then it's not the power of
[34:29] Salvation so this is for a specific
[34:32] group those who can believe let's read
[34:35] it again for I'm not ashamed of the
[34:36] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[34:38] God unto salvation to everyone that
[34:40] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[34:43] the Greek so Peter says we're kept by
[34:46] the power of God through faith the
[34:48] gospel of Christ is the power of God
[34:51] unto salvation to all them that believe
[34:54] so there is a power that will keep us
[34:56] there is a power power that will save us
[34:58] there is a power of God available amen
[35:00] but how do I access the power I access
[35:03] it through faith how do I have faith it
[35:05] is a gift of
[35:06] [Music]
[35:08] God I hope when we walk away this
[35:11] afternoon or this evening we don't walk
[35:13] away saying oh I wish I had Faith but I
[35:16] hope we walk away realizing that God has
[35:18] given me something to access everything
[35:21] I have need of not that we go oh if I
[35:23] could believe a little more if you if
[35:25] God put inside of you the capacity to
[35:27] believe this end time message you've got
[35:30] what's inside the the access to
[35:32] everything that God has is already
[35:34] laying inside the ability to believe is
[35:37] is the key in your hand Amen to every
[35:40] promise of God because if you can
[35:42] believe one promise of God you can
[35:44] believe all the promises of God why
[35:47] because to believe Amen to believe this
[35:50] message to believe what God has done in
[35:52] this day amen is going to take something
[35:54] more than intellect something more than
[35:56] teaching something more than willpower
[35:58] it's going to take a deposit of the C
[36:00] Gene of God Amen that was there before
[36:02] the foundation of the world and if
[36:03] that's there it gave you access to
[36:06] Christ in this
[36:08] day but it gives you access to the power
[36:11] of God
[36:15] Amen in the adoption part three brother
[36:18] B says by faith are you saved that's
[36:21] your faith in God now brother Rim's
[36:24] going to say something so strange here
[36:27] by faith are you saved that's your faith
[36:28] in God the blood keeps you clean from
[36:31] sin because it makes a sacrifice the
[36:33] blood doesn't save you the blood keeps
[36:35] you clean that's right how do you say
[36:38] saved by faith are you saved and that by
[36:41] God's forn knowledge calling you you are
[36:42] saved and the blood makes an atonement
[36:45] constantly keeping you
[36:48] clean
[36:49] now brother B here says the blood
[36:52] doesn't save you the blood keeps you
[36:54] clean but you can find a dozen maybe or
[36:57] more quotes where he says we're saved by
[36:59] the blood of
[37:01] God so does the blood save us or do the
[37:03] blood not save us yes we're saved by the
[37:05] blood of God because that's the price
[37:07] that was paid for our Redemption There's
[37:09] No Redemption without the shedding of
[37:11] blood so we are saved by the blood of
[37:13] God but the question is God came and he
[37:16] shed his own blood amen and when he shed
[37:18] his own blood why isn't everyone
[37:23] saved he shed his blood he purchased the
[37:26] whole World why why when he came as a
[37:29] sacrifice and shed his blood if we're
[37:30] saved by the blood of God when the blood
[37:32] of God spilled why wasn't everybody
[37:35] automatically redeemed and saved you
[37:37] know brother bam says that that only the
[37:39] elect is considered in
[37:43] Redemption
[37:44] amen that was what drove him to Calvary
[37:47] was the
[37:48] elect and so now now you know it's not
[37:52] that brother brenham's contradicting
[37:53] himself it's not that he's right in one
[37:56] spot and wrong in the other spot we
[37:58] don't believe that mean we don't believe
[37:59] the message that way but what he's
[38:01] trying to show you is if you're only
[38:03] saved by Blood then everybody who can
[38:05] recognize amen that God shed his blood
[38:07] that Jesus Christ died would
[38:08] automatically be saved but there has to
[38:10] be an access to what that blood
[38:13] purchased and that access is by faith
[38:15] and that's why brother Brenham says
[38:16] you're saved by
[38:18] faith well when you go to the scripture
[38:21] the scripture actually says you're saved
[38:22] by grace amen Ephesians 2 you're saved
[38:25] by grace so am I saved by the blood or
[38:27] am I saved by grace or am I saved by
[38:30] faith and I'll key you off the answer is
[38:34] yes because there has to be some way for
[38:37] you to access the grace amen and that
[38:40] Grace amen brought the blood on the
[38:42] scene by grace to purchase my Redemption
[38:44] and my salvation so I am saved by the
[38:47] blood I am justified by the blood I am
[38:50] saved by faith I am justified by the
[38:53] faith because though justification is
[38:55] available how do I know it's available
[38:57] to me how do I know I'm Justified
[38:59] because I'm justified by faith but
[39:03] there's another scripture that we
[39:04] justified by the blood of Christ am I
[39:06] justified by the blood of Christ or
[39:08] justified by faith and the answer is
[39:12] yes because I have to have an access
[39:16] because he had the way to make it by
[39:18] Grace but he had to ensure that the
[39:21] promise would come to all the seed so he
[39:24] made it by faith so that it could be by
[39:26] Grace because he didn't want us working
[39:29] our way into it cuz he knew in hybrid
[39:31] flesh we would fail we could never climb
[39:33] the ladder fast enough and high enough
[39:35] for our own
[39:37] salvation so he had to set the scenario
[39:40] where he would pay the price where he
[39:42] would have the power of Salvation where
[39:44] he would shed the blood but he would
[39:46] have to have an access point where you
[39:48] can access all of those
[39:51] benefits and that was by
[39:54] faith you might say brother Chad it's
[39:58] rigged and I say yes it's
[40:02] rigged and sometimes that troubles
[40:05] people but don't let that trouble you
[40:08] because if it was not predetermined
[40:11] predestinated
[40:13] rigged there's not a soul on this planet
[40:15] that would have ever been
[40:17] [Music]
[40:19] saved we say oh that's not fair some get
[40:22] it some don't listen we don't you don't
[40:24] understand only the elect is considered
[40:27] in
[40:28] Redemption amen remember the parable of
[40:31] the pearl of great price amen when the
[40:33] merchant found the Pearl amen he sold
[40:36] all that he had he gave up everything
[40:37] and he bought the field amen why did he
[40:40] buy the field because he wanted the
[40:42] Pearl he didn't it's not the field he
[40:45] was after it was the Pearl in the field
[40:47] that Parable is a parable to the kingdom
[40:50] amen Jesus Christ gave up everything he
[40:52] had and paid the ultimate price he paid
[40:54] all that he could pay he paid with his
[40:56] his own blood he paid with his own life
[40:58] he gave up everything and in that in
[41:00] that giving up he bought the field which
[41:03] is the whole world and everything that's
[41:05] contained in the world now belongs to
[41:07] him that right why did he do that for
[41:11] the rede the Redemption of the elect
[41:14] because there was a pearl in the field
[41:16] and he bought the field for the Pearl
[41:18] but if you go to the church age book now
[41:20] all of the sudden we go to the white
[41:22] Throne judgment and realize that as
[41:25] Jesus I mean as as Jesus is
[41:27] administering judgment you have people
[41:29] there who are not the predestinated
[41:31] elect seat of God Amen they weren't even
[41:34] considered in the Redemption as far as
[41:35] the whole purpose for buying the fieldes
[41:38] that makes sense but the but brother
[41:41] bham tells us but because he owns it all
[41:47] amen he can decide what he wants to do
[41:50] with what he
[41:53] owns follow me and that's at the white
[41:56] Throne judgment there are multitudes of
[41:59] people who enter into eternal life not
[42:02] previously having had it because the
[42:04] elect previously had it there's a whole
[42:07] slew of people that come into eternal
[42:09] life not previously having had eternal
[42:13] life and what are they at the white
[42:15] Throne judgment they're saved they enter
[42:17] in he said they enter in to to eternal
[42:20] life to enter into life that that has no
[42:23] End Amen cuz time is abolished at this
[42:26] point so they enter into eternal life
[42:28] although they didn't have eternal
[42:31] life that make sense we
[42:35] together none of those people would
[42:39] enter in if there was not an elect that
[42:42] was lost that needed
[42:44] redeemed not one of them would go in not
[42:47] one of them would pass beyond the portal
[42:49] of time and go beyond the barrier of
[42:52] time not one of them if there wasn't a
[42:54] pearl in the field he was with willing
[42:56] to sell all to buy what looks like is
[42:59] unfair is the greatest Mercy that's ever
[43:02] struck the Earth it amen it is the most
[43:04] wonderful thing that's ever happened
[43:06] that God would give himself to save
[43:09] himself and in the process he would buy
[43:11] it all giving himself the right Amen to
[43:14] choose Amen to allow himself to set the
[43:16] parameters where those who were not
[43:18] initially intended to come in can come
[43:21] in it opened the door to Salvation it
[43:24] blew wide open the door to
[43:30] Salvation this gospel is
[43:33] beautiful this message this message
[43:36] takes everything we've known to a whole
[43:38] another
[43:40] level it makes God so wonderful so
[43:44] powerful so
[43:46] Majestic let's go to Luke Chapter
[43:55] 7
[44:07] Luke chapter
[44:14] 7 in verse
[44:16] 47 this is the story of Simon's the
[44:19] Pharisees home when they did not wash
[44:21] jesus' feet neither gave him kiss or
[44:24] anointing and we know the Harlot did
[44:26] that for him in verse 47 it says
[44:29] wherefore I say unto thee her sins which
[44:31] are many are
[44:34] forgiven for she loved much but to whom
[44:37] little was forgiven the same loveth
[44:39] little and he said unto her thy sins are
[44:43] forgiven and they that sat at meat with
[44:46] with him began to say within themselves
[44:48] who is this that forgiveth sins also and
[44:51] he said to the woman thy
[44:54] faith hath save thee go in
[44:59] peace she was saved by faith which is
[45:04] saved by
[45:06] grace thy faith has saved thee what was
[45:10] it she believed in what was it she did
[45:14] he never said because you anointed
[45:18] me it wasn't her works that the works
[45:21] were an expression of her
[45:24] faith it wasn't because if that's all it
[45:26] took to be saved I would grab a bottle
[45:28] the next chance I had and break it on
[45:30] his head and break it on his feet if
[45:32] that would guarantee me salvation I
[45:33] would go through the motions you
[45:35] understand what I'm saying if there's a
[45:37] work that you can do amen that would
[45:38] guarantee salvation it wasn't the fact
[45:41] that she anointed him with oil it was
[45:42] the fact that she believed this was the
[45:44] Messiah is the reason she anointed him
[45:46] with
[45:47] oil she recognized who he was amen and
[45:50] she was willing to serve him amen and he
[45:52] says you know he he he's there and he
[45:56] he's talking to Simon and Simon you
[45:58] never greeted me Simon you never
[45:59] anointed me Simon you didn't recognize
[46:02] me but this woman has not ceased since I
[46:05] came Amen to anoint my feet and wash him
[46:07] with tears and wipe him with her hair
[46:09] kiss my feet and I
[46:14] say you know in this day in the day that
[46:17] Jesus is saying this all the Pharisees
[46:20] all the Jews they they understand
[46:22] salvation only one way and that is
[46:24] through a substitute tionary lamb or a
[46:26] dove or a goat amen and Jesus is
[46:29] standing here who is the
[46:31] word and you know what blew their minds
[46:34] is that he forgave their sin but he
[46:35] didn't require her to go make an
[46:38] offering he didn't require her to go to
[46:39] the temple to go to the priest to buy a
[46:42] dove to take a goat she didn't have to
[46:43] do anything that they expected her to
[46:46] need to do to be forgiven he was abled
[46:48] simply because he was the word amen he
[46:51] was able to say because you
[46:54] believed
[47:02] Faith was her
[47:03] access to Salvation Faith was her access
[47:07] to forgiveness of
[47:10] sins
[47:14] amen let's go to Matthew chapter
[47:21] 9 we don't have any PowerPoint we don't
[47:23] have a whiteboard this good oldfashioned
[47:26] Bible
[47:29] study Matthew chapter
[47:32] 9 verse
[47:40] 18 and while he spake these things unto
[47:43] them behold there came a certain ruler
[47:45] and worshiped him saying my daughter is
[47:47] even now dead but come and lay thy hand
[47:49] upon her and she shall live and Jesus
[47:51] arose and followed him and so did his
[47:53] disciples and behold a Wom a woman which
[47:56] had which was diseased with an issue of
[47:59] blood 12 years came behind him and
[48:00] touched the Hem of His Garment for she
[48:03] said within herself if I may be if I may
[48:05] but touch His Garment I shall be whole
[48:08] but Jesus turned him about and when he
[48:11] saw her he said daughter be of good
[48:13] Comfort thy faith hath made thee
[48:18] whole and the woman was made whole from
[48:21] that hour and brother bham references
[48:23] this in the message is the rising of the
[48:25] Sun he says now how many has got
[48:27] quickening power now lay your hands upon
[48:30] one another if that quickening power is
[48:31] in you now there is only one thing to
[48:34] keep it from hindering that's your
[48:37] unbelief a woman touched His Garment was
[48:40] made whole a Roman soldier spit in his
[48:42] face and went to hell it depends on
[48:44] where you're at do you believe it am see
[48:49] when when Jesus turned around to the
[48:51] woman he says go thy way and be healed
[48:55] because you touched my hem you're
[48:59] whole right because if that was the case
[49:02] I would throw myself through the crowd
[49:03] and crawled my way over there
[49:06] and it was never going to be a formula
[49:08] it was never going to be a work it was
[49:10] never going to be something that can be
[49:11] replicated to guarantee success it was
[49:14] always going the the mystery was that
[49:17] this grace is going to be sure to the
[49:19] seed by what access by
[49:23] faith and he says he turns around he
[49:25] says your action he didn't say your
[49:27] action made you whole he didn't say your
[49:29] touching made you whole he didn't say
[49:31] your perseverance you're crawling on
[49:32] your knees you're pushing through the
[49:34] crowd it was none of that all of that
[49:36] was an expression of her
[49:38] faith but when he turned around he said
[49:41] daughter be of good Comfort thy faith ha
[49:43] made thee whole what was her access to
[49:46] Healing
[49:48] Faith why did she crawl on her knees and
[49:50] push through the crowd and touch the him
[49:52] of His Garment anyways because she
[49:54] believed in her heart
[49:56] it was an expression of her faith she
[49:59] believed praise God let's go to Hebrews
[50:03] chapter 11
[50:12] now Hebrews chap
[50:18] 11 verse
[50:24] one
[50:28] now Faith is the substance of things
[50:31] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[50:33] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[50:36] good report through faith we understand
[50:38] that the worlds were framed by the word
[50:40] of God so the things which are seen were
[50:42] not made of things which do
[50:46] appear the world was framed by faith
[50:50] yes question is was it framed by the
[50:52] word of God or by faith the answer is
[50:55] yes yes you guys can pass this test you
[50:57] all get a
[50:59] 100 it was the word of God but here's
[51:02] what brother brandom says he says do you
[51:05] know that everything that you see
[51:06] tonight is God's word materialized do
[51:09] you know your body is God's word
[51:10] materialized do you know that be them
[51:12] beans there is God's word materialized
[51:14] do you know that concrete is God spoke
[51:15] and word materialized do you know this
[51:17] whole earth is God spoke and said let
[51:19] there be and he believed his own word
[51:22] and the Earth came into existence if it
[51:24] didn't where did it come from well you
[51:27] say it come off the sun well who spoke
[51:29] the sun into existence see everything is
[51:31] God's word the worlds were framed by the
[51:33] word of God the Bible says so God just
[51:36] spoke it and he believed his own word
[51:39] and that's what it
[51:42] was amen if God Amen if God had to
[51:47] believe his own word and then it come
[51:49] into manifestation what do we need to do
[51:51] with his word to bring it into
[51:54] manifestation believe it let's go to
[51:56] Mark chapter
[52:07] n Mark chapter
[52:12] n verse 23 Mark 9 and
[52:17] 23 says Jesus said unto them if thou
[52:20] cast believe all things are possible to
[52:24] him that believeth
[52:26] what is our access to the
[52:28] supernatural
[52:30] Faith simple
[52:33] faith if thou cast believe all things
[52:37] are possible to him that believeth if
[52:39] you can't believe it's not possible but
[52:43] if you can believe it's
[52:47] possible believe in what brother
[52:50] Chad I just said believe not in want
[52:55] just believe Amen brother B said perfect
[53:00] faith will bring the word into
[53:02] manifestation amen what part do I need
[53:04] to believe just believe whatever you
[53:06] believe you can
[53:08] have not believe here but believe deep
[53:12] down here when it drops from the head to
[53:15] the soul amen then that's
[53:19] god let's go to uh Mark
[53:24] 11
[53:28] Mark
[53:32] 11:20 and in the morning as they passed
[53:34] by they saw the fig tree dried up from
[53:36] the roots and Peter calling to
[53:38] remembrance saith unto him Master behold
[53:40] the Fig Tree which thou curses is
[53:42] withered
[53:44] away and Jesus answered saith unto him
[53:46] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[53:50] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[53:52] mountain be ye be thou removed and be
[53:54] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[53:56] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[53:58] that those things which he saith shall
[54:00] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[54:03] saith therefore I say unto you
[54:05] whatsoever what things soever you desire
[54:08] When you pray believe that you receive
[54:10] them and ye shall have
[54:13] them that that word Can't
[54:17] Fail that Absolut that's a promise of
[54:20] God Amen that if you can believe in your
[54:23] heart and not doubt let's read that
[54:25] again cuz here's the key therefore I say
[54:27] unto you what things soever you desire
[54:29] When you pray believing you re I'm sorry
[54:31] let's go let's go up one more verse 23
[54:33] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[54:35] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[54:36] removed be thou cast into the sea and
[54:39] shall not doubt in his heart but shall
[54:42] believe that those things which he saith
[54:44] shall come to pass he shall have
[54:46] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[54:48] you what things soever you desire When
[54:50] you pray believe that you receive them
[54:53] and you shall have them
[54:56] amen that word Can't Fail that's right
[55:00] brother brandham was musing over this
[55:02] scripture remember he said I never
[55:05] preached on it really because I didn't
[55:06] know I didn't know how to understand it
[55:08] I didn't know how to take it and while
[55:11] he was musing on that while he was
[55:12] thinking about that that's when God came
[55:14] to him and said he started speaking to
[55:17] him about this scripture he's going to
[55:18] show him amen how this works and he
[55:21] begins to tell him amen if you
[55:24] speak it'll be and then he starts saying
[55:26] speak and he doesn't know what to speak
[55:28] for and he says you're hunting you have
[55:30] no squirrels what do you have need of
[55:33] and he starts encouraging him to speak
[55:35] amen and then he speaks the squirrel
[55:37] here and a squirrel there and a squirrel
[55:38] there and whatsoever he said came into
[55:42] manifestation we know this happened five
[55:45] times for him and and we know all of
[55:46] that the squirrels twice and then the
[55:48] salvation of hady writes boys and and
[55:50] then the storm in Colorado and the tumor
[55:52] and his wife amen but every time time
[55:55] God come to him and told him to speak
[55:58] amen and when God came to him and told
[55:59] him to speak how could he doubt in his
[56:02] heart he didn't come up with it it
[56:03] wasn't his idea it wasn't his
[56:05] imagination it wasn't even his own
[56:07] desire amen it was it was something that
[56:10] God wanted to manifest so God come to
[56:12] him and and told him what to do told him
[56:14] it was time and he had no doubt in his
[56:17] heart that it was going to come to pass
[56:19] and that scripture came to
[56:21] life see this scripture this what he's
[56:23] talking about is not trying something I
[56:26] think I'll try to say it and see what it
[56:27] happens I think I I'll conjure up uh uh
[56:29] some emotion and then I'll speak
[56:31] something real forcefully and don't
[56:33] happen that's a failure just waiting to
[56:34] happen this is when God drops something
[56:37] into your heart that's so solid that
[56:38] there's not a doubt in your heart that
[56:40] it'll come to
[56:42] pass this is the faith of God this is
[56:45] not just something that we're working up
[56:47] that's right this is a
[56:49] reality but it is a
[56:52] reality wasn't just a reality in a
[56:54] prophet is a reality for anyone who can
[57:00] believe
[57:03] Amen brother B says the great triumphant
[57:06] General who came down and was made the
[57:09] word made flesh took that word and
[57:11] defeated Satan on every ground and said
[57:13] you destroy this Temple I'll raise it up
[57:15] the third day and why David and the word
[57:18] said that I'll not suffer my Holy One to
[57:20] see corruption neither will I leave his
[57:22] soul in hell and he knew that that was
[57:25] one promise of God that he'd be raised
[57:27] up and he took that word and went to
[57:30] death with it and knowed that that word
[57:32] had to come to
[57:33] pass listen this is the Faith of Christ
[57:36] being expressed in the word of God
[57:38] brother bam tells us in other places he
[57:40] went to Calvary with one scripture
[57:42] saying that he would raise from the dead
[57:44] amen but he believed it amen and here he
[57:47] expresses it he expresses they destroy
[57:49] this Temple and I'll raise it up in the
[57:50] third day amen why brother B said
[57:53] because he he knew David said right
[57:57] David said amen I'll not suffer my Holy
[58:00] One to seek corruption neither shall I
[58:01] leave his soul in hell and he took that
[58:03] scripture and made that Proclamation and
[58:05] went to Calvary knowing that he would
[58:07] raise because of that
[58:10] scripture so Romans 10 says so then
[58:13] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[58:17] the word of
[58:18] God faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[58:21] by the word of God Amen and you know we
[58:24] hear the word of God all the time but
[58:27] but you know so many people in this
[58:29] world can hear the word in these
[58:33] years you can play you can play a audio
[58:37] version of the Bible and you can play it
[58:38] with all kinds of different voices deep
[58:41] masculine voice you can have one that
[58:43] have different voices as the characters
[58:45] change you can put on the audio and you
[58:47] can play the Bible and you can hear the
[58:52] word but it may not bring you faith
[58:55] that's right because you have to have
[58:56] another set of
[58:58] ears and you have to have ears down on
[59:00] the inside that can hear more than these
[59:02] ears can hear the whole world can hear
[59:05] through these ears if it's spoken in
[59:06] their language but there's a select few
[59:08] that can hear with different ears and
[59:10] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[59:12] the word of God why because it's the
[59:14] word coming to the word it's a
[59:17] connection of two parts of the same
[59:19] thing praise
[59:21] God so that's why we have to hear the
[59:26] word in the message the Feast of
[59:30] trumpets brother B says and how will the
[59:34] people that's believing him know it
[59:35] unless they're constantly in the word to
[59:38] know that to know what he is Daniel said
[59:41] the wise shall know but the foolish the
[59:43] unwise wouldn't know they shall know
[59:45] their God now how he shall appear in the
[59:48] last days is to bring the people back to
[59:51] the word so that the bride will know
[59:54] know her husband know her mate the
[59:56] revealed word that's why this has to
[1:00:00] happen what's he talking about he's
[1:00:02] talking about the third pool the latter
[1:00:03] rain he's talking about the The
[1:00:05] Awakening of the Bride he's talking
[1:00:07] about the Capstone coming down he's
[1:00:08] talking about the opening of the word
[1:00:10] he's talking about the opening of the
[1:00:11] seals why does this has to happen it has
[1:00:13] to happen because she needs to hear the
[1:00:16] word amen to give her faith so that
[1:00:18] she'll recognize her husband the
[1:00:20] revealed
[1:00:22] word said it wasn't in the reformers
[1:00:25] wasn't in Luther Wesley and the
[1:00:27] Pentecostals in them scripture says it
[1:00:29] wasn't but it will come that is his
[1:00:32] promise for this age we're living in the
[1:00:34] age that his coming will be in she must
[1:00:37] be identified in him any woman must be
[1:00:40] identified with her husband for the two
[1:00:42] R1 and Christ's bride has to be
[1:00:45] identified with him for the two R1 and
[1:00:48] he is the word amen not the denomination
[1:00:52] the word we are to be the children of of
[1:00:54] the light and the light is the word
[1:00:56] which is made light for this age how do
[1:00:58] we know light except it comes from the
[1:01:00] word all right the word made flesh is
[1:01:03] the light of the age when you see it and
[1:01:06] the Bible said so why did this light
[1:01:09] have to come so that she would
[1:01:11] recognize her mate the revealed word why
[1:01:16] she had let me just say it this way the
[1:01:20] bride needed access to Christ
[1:01:26] so there had to be something to give her
[1:01:29] faith to come into an invisible
[1:01:32] Union because by his grace he came am
[1:01:35] amen by his grace he presented himself
[1:01:38] by his grace the word came in our day
[1:01:41] and presented itself to the bride amen
[1:01:43] but the bride had to have access to
[1:01:45] Christ amen and what was going to give
[1:01:47] her access it was going to be faith that
[1:01:50] would give her access and bring her to
[1:01:51] an invisible Union listen just because
[1:01:55] Christ came didn't mean everybody on
[1:01:58] Earth that day come into an invisible
[1:02:00] Union and married him is that right just
[1:02:03] like when his blood was shed on the
[1:02:04] earth it didn't mean everybody was
[1:02:06] automatically saved when Christ returned
[1:02:08] it didn't mean everybody was
[1:02:09] automatically married there had to be
[1:02:11] access to that there had to be a way to
[1:02:14] connect to that what was the way to
[1:02:16] connect to it it was Faith how was God
[1:02:18] going to bring us Faith he was going to
[1:02:19] open the word and show us the mystery
[1:02:21] amen because in showing us the mystery
[1:02:23] he was going to awake and the faith
[1:02:25] that's laying down inside of us so that
[1:02:27] we can move out into an invisible Union
[1:02:29] with
[1:02:30] Christ amen if it wasn't for the opening
[1:02:32] of the word we would never have access
[1:02:34] to the Christ that
[1:02:38] came praise be to
[1:02:40] God let's go to Hebrews chapter
[1:02:49] 3 Hebrews chapter
[1:02:53] 3
[1:02:55] in verse
[1:03:02] 16 did Brother brandom tell us this is
[1:03:04] uniting signs and
[1:03:07] times right is this the return of the
[1:03:10] word is the word Christ is the
[1:03:13] bridegroom here is the fullness of the
[1:03:15] word here so that's our Promise Land the
[1:03:20] word but here in Hebrews 3:16 he says
[1:03:23] for some
[1:03:24] when they had heard did provoke how be
[1:03:26] it not all that came out of Egypt by
[1:03:28] Moses but with whom was he greed 40
[1:03:31] years was it not them was it not with
[1:03:34] them that had sinned whose carcasses
[1:03:36] fell in the
[1:03:37] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[1:03:39] they would not enter into his rest but
[1:03:42] to them that believed
[1:03:45] not so we see that they could not enter
[1:03:48] in because of
[1:03:50] unbelief they came all the way to the
[1:03:53] promised land
[1:03:55] what God told him he would do to bring
[1:03:57] them out of Egypt and in Exodus and pave
[1:03:59] the way and bring them safely across the
[1:04:01] desert and bring him to the promised
[1:04:03] land god did everything he said he would
[1:04:04] do he sent a pillar of fire he sent a
[1:04:07] prophet he gave him this word he gave
[1:04:09] him safe passage he gave him Mana he
[1:04:11] brought them all the way to the border
[1:04:12] of the promised land but they could not
[1:04:14] go in because they could not access the
[1:04:16] promised land because they didn't
[1:04:19] believe because of unbelief they were
[1:04:22] kept out of the promised land but I want
[1:04:24] to asked you a question 40 years later
[1:04:25] who of that original group went in and
[1:04:28] accessed the promised land it was the
[1:04:29] two who believed Joshua and Caleb they
[1:04:32] went all the way in what gave them the
[1:04:34] access what preserved their life when
[1:04:36] everybody else died in the wilderness
[1:04:38] amen they died they their carcasses fell
[1:04:40] in the wilderness because they couldn't
[1:04:42] access the promises of God because of
[1:04:44] unbelief but there was two who could
[1:04:46] believe and that was their access to the
[1:04:51] promised nothing has
[1:04:53] changed that's the true yeah the dates
[1:04:56] few of the circumstances but everything
[1:04:58] else Remains the
[1:05:00] Same amen we've had a prophet of God a
[1:05:03] pillar of fire promises and signs and
[1:05:06] wonders and brought us right up to the
[1:05:08] promised land brought us right to the
[1:05:10] promise for the hour right to the
[1:05:11] invisible Union right to the marriage
[1:05:13] brought us right to Christ we're
[1:05:15] standing right before him who can enter
[1:05:17] in who can enter into the visible Union
[1:05:20] who can go in and who can't go in the
[1:05:22] ones who have access are the ones who
[1:05:23] believe amen the ones who don't believe
[1:05:26] don't have access to what's standing
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:31] here praise be to
[1:05:34] God now we
[1:05:36] realize that if God has placed a seed in
[1:05:39] me that can believe if I have something
[1:05:42] to believe
[1:05:44] with think about this if I have the
[1:05:47] capacity within me to believe the word
[1:05:50] for this day then God has already
[1:05:54] guaranteed me access into the promises
[1:05:57] the access is by faith but it's not my
[1:06:00] faith it's his faith amen it's his seed
[1:06:02] it's his attribute it's his word that he
[1:06:04] placed inside of me before the
[1:06:05] foundation of the world there's
[1:06:07] guaranteed access the keys in the hand
[1:06:09] the gate will swing open why amen
[1:06:12] because of who I what church I go to
[1:06:14] where I was born who my parents were how
[1:06:16] hard I tried or because I repeated
[1:06:18] everything brother B no because of Faith
[1:06:21] amen faith is the access to everything
[1:06:24] the prophet brought brought us right to
[1:06:28] Promised
[1:06:30] Land but we can go
[1:06:33] in because we have
[1:06:37] access
[1:06:40] amen oh praise God let's go to Matthew
[1:06:53] 13
[1:06:57] Matthew
[1:07:00] 13 and verse
[1:07:07] 53 Matthew 13 and
[1:07:11] 53 and it came to pass that when Jesus
[1:07:14] had finished these Parables he departed
[1:07:16] then when he was coming to his own
[1:07:18] country he taught them in their in their
[1:07:20] synagogue in so much that they were
[1:07:22] astonished and said when hath this man
[1:07:24] this wisdom in these Mighty works is not
[1:07:27] this the carpenter son is not this his
[1:07:29] mother called Mary and his Brethren
[1:07:31] James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and
[1:07:35] his sisters are they not all with us
[1:07:37] whence then hath this man all these
[1:07:39] things and they were offended in him but
[1:07:43] Jesus said unto them a prophet is not
[1:07:45] without honor save in his own country
[1:07:47] and his own house and he did not many
[1:07:50] mighty works there because of their
[1:07:53] unbelief
[1:07:55] believe it wasn't because his power was
[1:07:58] diminished it wasn't because he couldn't
[1:08:00] heal it wasn't because it wasn't even
[1:08:02] because he didn't want to
[1:08:04] heal what hindered was
[1:08:08] unbelief man it's not as though God
[1:08:11] didn't want his children to go to the
[1:08:13] promised land what hindered them was
[1:08:15] unbelief it's not as though God didn't
[1:08:17] want to heal anybody in capernium or
[1:08:19] anybody in his hometown it wasn't that
[1:08:21] he didn't want to it's that he was
[1:08:22] hindered by
[1:08:25] belief amen they lost their access to
[1:08:29] the power that was standing there was
[1:08:31] the power of God there to heal was the
[1:08:33] power of God there to deliver nothing
[1:08:35] changed in the power of God it wasn't as
[1:08:37] though all of a sudden his batteries
[1:08:39] were
[1:08:40] low the power was there but they had no
[1:08:43] access to that power because they
[1:08:44] couldn't do what the Harlot woman do
[1:08:46] wash his feet they couldn't do what the
[1:08:47] Samaritan that the well could do they
[1:08:49] couldn't receive who was in their midst
[1:08:52] they couldn't see it they couldn't
[1:08:53] believe believe it they then they were
[1:08:55] cut off from the access to the power
[1:08:57] that would heal
[1:08:59] them say God give me eyes to see ears to
[1:09:03] hear Faith to believe all that you're
[1:09:06] doing in this
[1:09:10] day in the message the identification of
[1:09:12] Christ in all ages he says this heavenly
[1:09:17] father we are grateful to see the the
[1:09:19] Risen Messiah 1900 years of all kinds of
[1:09:22] Theology and movement but still in the
[1:09:25] darkness of all of it you promised that
[1:09:27] you would appear here in the last days
[1:09:29] in this Sodom day and you would make
[1:09:31] yourself known to the children of
[1:09:32] Abraham the called the elected and here
[1:09:35] you are tonight after 1900 years you are
[1:09:38] just as much alive tonight as you was
[1:09:40] when you talked to the woman at the
[1:09:43] well if he's just as much alive as he
[1:09:46] was amen then that means the power is
[1:09:49] here amen but we have to have the same
[1:09:51] access she had to get the benefit of him
[1:09:54] being
[1:09:58] here it's God manifested in flesh now in
[1:10:01] the flesh of his bride for the bride and
[1:10:04] the husband is the same self flesh these
[1:10:06] two are one and this is what I want to
[1:10:09] hone in on and the church is becoming
[1:10:12] the bride
[1:10:14] amen are you becoming the
[1:10:17] bride and the church is becoming the
[1:10:19] bride all the time by believing the word
[1:10:24] what's her access to be bride her access
[1:10:27] is Faith amen the ability to believe the
[1:10:29] word is what's putting her in the bride
[1:10:31] what's changing her from church from
[1:10:33] denomination to bride how is she making
[1:10:36] this move how is she moving from
[1:10:38] denomination into bride she's moving
[1:10:40] that way by believing the word what's
[1:10:42] her access to brideship her access is by
[1:10:47] faith it's not going to a message church
[1:10:50] it's not getting along with the Saints
[1:10:52] it's not agreeing with the pastor that's
[1:10:54] not access believing the word is
[1:10:57] access and the church is becoming the
[1:11:00] bride all the time by believing the word
[1:11:03] I'm becoming the bride all the time
[1:11:05] because as he shows me the word there's
[1:11:06] something in me that says Amen to it
[1:11:08] amen that's the truth that's the truth I
[1:11:11] didn't know that before I never saw that
[1:11:13] before somebody turned to a Bible and
[1:11:15] they opened the Bible and they showed me
[1:11:16] something I never seen before but there
[1:11:18] was something in me that said that ain't
[1:11:20] nothing but the truth what is that
[1:11:22] that's my access to be
[1:11:25] bride not good works not good deeds not
[1:11:28] going to the right place not a mental
[1:11:30] agreement with all the right things not
[1:11:32] dressing right none of that is my access
[1:11:35] that all is secondary that's a
[1:11:37] manifestation of the faith that I have
[1:11:38] in my heart but what's my access to be
[1:11:41] bride my access is faith in the
[1:11:46] word and the church is becoming the
[1:11:48] bride all the time by believing the word
[1:11:50] so that the word in the church becomes
[1:11:52] the same
[1:11:55] the word in the church making it the
[1:11:59] bride the last
[1:12:02] sign God identifying himself the word in
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:07] church we are not bride because we claim
[1:12:10] to be
[1:12:14] bride I'm not bride because my lips can
[1:12:18] say it I'm bride because my faith and my
[1:12:21] soul can receive it and believe
[1:12:24] my access is Faith amen when that word
[1:12:28] comes and I know I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:12:32] good enough I didn't get it right I
[1:12:34] still don't get it right he should have
[1:12:37] picked a dozen other 10,000 others
[1:12:41] before he picked me it doesn't change
[1:12:44] the fact that I still believe I'm one of
[1:12:45] them by faith I can say I'm one of them
[1:12:49] that's my access to bride that's my
[1:12:52] access to Christ Christ is here amen how
[1:12:56] do I access the Christ that is here by
[1:13:01] faith let's go to Hebrews 11 we've
[1:13:04] preached on this quite a bit recently
[1:13:07] but I don't want to miss it
[1:13:10] here Hebrews
[1:13:16] 11 chapter 11 verse
[1:13:22] 11 through faith also Sarah herself
[1:13:26] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:13:28] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:13:30] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:13:33] who had
[1:13:35] promised listen we know that Sarah was
[1:13:39] struggling with
[1:13:41] faith is that
[1:13:43] right and she wasn't conceiving is that
[1:13:46] right Sarah was struggling and not
[1:13:48] conceiving and struggling and not
[1:13:50] conceiving and she got so old her wound
[1:13:52] was dried up and and there is no
[1:13:54] possibility anymore amen but what was
[1:13:57] her access to the
[1:13:59] promise her access to the promise was by
[1:14:03] faith and we've been through this before
[1:14:06] and we know that Sarah had doubts Sarah
[1:14:08] had doubts about the promise she had and
[1:14:10] really when it comes down to it Sarah's
[1:14:13] doubts all revolved around
[1:14:15] herself her doubt was whether or not she
[1:14:18] was part of the promise she wasn't
[1:14:21] doubting the promise to Abraham she knew
[1:14:23] God talked to Abraham and she knew from
[1:14:25] Abraham's seed there would be H the
[1:14:28] promises were given to Abraham's seed
[1:14:30] she believed that that's why she came up
[1:14:32] with the whole thing with Hagar and
[1:14:34] creating ishmail is because she believed
[1:14:36] the promise was to Abraham and and her
[1:14:38] struggle was not as the promise uh uh to
[1:14:41] Abraham the the struggle is she didn't
[1:14:43] see herself as part of
[1:14:48] Abraham you see what happens when we
[1:14:51] realize we say Amen this is the this is
[1:14:53] the day for the elect seed God's calling
[1:14:55] out a bride there's a bride standing on
[1:14:57] the earth there's an invisible Union
[1:14:59] amen all of that is fine but if you
[1:15:01] can't see yourself as part of that word
[1:15:04] amen there's not a faith to give you
[1:15:06] access to that word and the devil's
[1:15:09] going to do everything he can to try to
[1:15:10] disrupt you and throw doubts into your
[1:15:12] mind amen because he knows your access
[1:15:15] is by
[1:15:16] faith going to make you feel like you're
[1:15:19] unworthy and no good and condemned but I
[1:15:21] would like to take him back to the
[1:15:22] scripture because I am saved by the
[1:15:25] purpose of God by grace before the
[1:15:27] foundation of the world so before I was
[1:15:29] ever unworthy I was declared
[1:15:32] worthy
[1:15:34] hallelujah amen and he knows the end
[1:15:37] from the beginning so if he knew amen
[1:15:39] that I would I would come down in a
[1:15:41] polluted State and in a polluted corrupt
[1:15:43] state I would continue to walk in
[1:15:44] corruption even knowing that he would
[1:15:46] choose me before it must say that his
[1:15:49] purpose is already fixed amen his intent
[1:15:51] is already fixed his Grace is
[1:15:57] sure so whatever the devil points you to
[1:16:00] point back to the
[1:16:03] word before I did one dirty deed he
[1:16:07] already declared and wrote my name and
[1:16:09] the Lamb's Book of Life with indelible
[1:16:11] ink in his own blood and it cannot be
[1:16:15] erased so the easiest thing to do is
[1:16:18] agree with the devil he says you're no
[1:16:20] good you say you're so that's right
[1:16:23] you're right do you know what you did
[1:16:25] the other day you're absolutely right
[1:16:28] and how can you be
[1:16:30] bride I don't
[1:16:32] know you know what I wouldn't pick me
[1:16:34] but oh I'm so thankful he chose me
[1:16:36] before the foundation of the world I
[1:16:38] don't have to argue about it I don't
[1:16:40] have to prove anything I don't have to
[1:16:41] defend myself the only thing I have to
[1:16:43] do is say I I can't help it I believe I
[1:16:46] mean and that's my access that's all I
[1:16:48] need is to believe and if I believe amen
[1:16:51] then the life of the word comes in and
[1:16:53] begins to live its life out of me amen
[1:16:55] and there's an expression of my faith
[1:16:57] that takes
[1:16:59] place
[1:17:01] amen so
[1:17:04] Sarah she herself had to receive
[1:17:06] strength to
[1:17:08] conceive the promise was given to
[1:17:10] Abraham the promise was
[1:17:13] sure when God told Abraham I'm going to
[1:17:16] give you a land and your seed shall
[1:17:17] possess the land he knew it was coming
[1:17:20] through
[1:17:20] Sarah the problem was Sarah didn't know
[1:17:23] it was coming through
[1:17:25] Sarah the problem was Sarah's Faith the
[1:17:28] hindrance was Sarah's Faith the block
[1:17:30] was Sarah's faith it was all about
[1:17:32] Sarah's Faith so God in his grace he
[1:17:34] visits
[1:17:36] Sarah and in this visitation to Sarah
[1:17:39] something takes place in
[1:17:42] Sarah and remember Sarah was already
[1:17:44] turned back
[1:17:46] young that happens on the plains of
[1:17:48] memory brother B said they woke up the
[1:17:49] next morning and they were young they
[1:17:50] went down to Gar in chapter 19 and and
[1:17:53] that and that and that young king wanted
[1:17:55] this
[1:17:56] young she was already young but still no
[1:17:59] conception she would turn back back
[1:18:01] young and there was still no promise
[1:18:03] amen the promise was waiting for one
[1:18:05] thing it was waiting for Sarah to access
[1:18:07] the
[1:18:12] promise friends the word's been given
[1:18:14] the promises went forth the message has
[1:18:16] been declare what's it waiting for it's
[1:18:18] waiting for the bride to access the
[1:18:21] promise
[1:18:24] amen and we become the bride all the
[1:18:27] time by believing the
[1:18:30] word and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:18:32] revealed he says the new birth is Christ
[1:18:34] is a revelation God has revealed to you
[1:18:36] this great mystery and that's a new
[1:18:39] birth now what are you going to do when
[1:18:41] you get all that group together where
[1:18:42] the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony
[1:18:45] and God expressing it through his word
[1:18:47] by the same actions the same things that
[1:18:49] he did making the word
[1:18:51] manifest oh if the church only knew its
[1:18:55] position it will one day then the
[1:18:58] Rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:19:04] is I thought the Rapture would go just
[1:19:06] whenever God decided the Rapture would
[1:19:10] go isn't this
[1:19:13] amazing when God said Abraham you're
[1:19:16] going to conceive and it's just going to
[1:19:18] happen God said it God's all powerful
[1:19:21] God can make anything happen
[1:19:23] amen but there was something that was
[1:19:25] waiting something that was waiting some
[1:19:27] Abraham no seed no seed no seed no seed
[1:19:30] until there was a certain Junction of
[1:19:32] time that God came to Sarah herself and
[1:19:34] unlocked something that was locked up in
[1:19:36] Sarah's heart and it was the faith to
[1:19:39] believe and through faith she received
[1:19:41] strength herself to conceive seed and
[1:19:43] then the promise come into manifestation
[1:19:45] what was the promise waiting for it was
[1:19:47] waiting for Sarah to
[1:19:51] believe oh if the church only knew its
[1:19:57] position what are we waiting on oh if
[1:20:01] the church only knew its
[1:20:02] position it will one day you believe
[1:20:06] that oh day by day word by word we're
[1:20:09] getting there friends Revelation upon
[1:20:11] Revelation we're growing to it amen it
[1:20:14] will one day then the Rapture will go
[1:20:16] when it knows what it
[1:20:19] is I asked you the question what is our
[1:20:23] access to the
[1:20:26] Rapture in the first seal he says but
[1:20:30] think now he wrote this but when he
[1:20:32] started to write those other seven
[1:20:33] Thunders he said don't write it he'd
[1:20:35] been commissioned to write everything he
[1:20:37] seen But when these seven Thunder Over
[1:20:39] in Revelation 10 under he said don't
[1:20:40] write them at all they're mysterious we
[1:20:43] don't know what they are yet but my
[1:20:45] opinion they'll be revealed right away
[1:20:47] and when it do it'll give faith for that
[1:20:50] rapturing Grace for the church to move
[1:20:52] out
[1:20:53] am has the rapturing grace come amen has
[1:20:56] the church started moving out
[1:21:01] amen it's going to be under those seven
[1:21:04] Thunders amen under the revelation of
[1:21:06] the word because Faith cometh by hearing
[1:21:08] the word amen Faith cometh by hearing
[1:21:11] and hearing by the word and this this as
[1:21:14] those the Mysteries are revealed it'll
[1:21:16] give faith for the rapturing grace for
[1:21:19] that church to move
[1:21:21] out do you mean there's rapturing Grace
[1:21:26] amen is Grace something you do or
[1:21:28] something he
[1:21:30] gave is Grace earned or is Grace a free
[1:21:33] gift I want to ask you has the Rapture
[1:21:36] already been given to the church it's
[1:21:38] already been given to the church by
[1:21:40] rapturing Grace now if I've been saved
[1:21:43] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:21:45] and I was saved by the blood of Calvary
[1:21:47] amen but there was a mechanism that
[1:21:48] tapped me into my salvation amen I was
[1:21:50] saved by grac amen yeah through
[1:21:54] faith I'll be raptured by
[1:21:57] grace through
[1:22:02] faith praise be to God it's that
[1:22:07] simple and the count on he said and
[1:22:09] father so many things could be said
[1:22:11] right here maybe the church wouldn't
[1:22:12] understand but I pray that you'll give
[1:22:14] them such a crave for it Lord that
[1:22:16] they'll come and see we're at the end
[1:22:17] time the astronaut age I pray father
[1:22:20] that they'll realize it isn't trying to
[1:22:22] condemn what they had it's only trying
[1:22:24] to give them more rapturing grace what
[1:22:27] is the message trying to do give
[1:22:28] rapturing
[1:22:29] Grace for the hour will come when we'll
[1:22:32] have to have Rapture power not only to
[1:22:35] heal the body but to change it in a
[1:22:36] moment in a twinkling of an eye Christ
[1:22:38] will be so real into our bodies till he
[1:22:41] can change it by his great death what he
[1:22:44] purchased so that means there's
[1:22:46] rapturing Grace and there's rapturing
[1:22:51] power
[1:22:54] I don't think we should be waiting for
[1:22:56] rapturing
[1:22:57] Grace it's
[1:23:00] here I don't think we should be waiting
[1:23:02] for rapturing power right it's
[1:23:05] here all that was given at the opening
[1:23:07] of the
[1:23:09] seals amen that's all
[1:23:12] here what do I need I need
[1:23:17] access to
[1:23:19] it that's what's catching us up right
[1:23:21] now yeah that's what's changes from a
[1:23:24] denomination to the bride that's what
[1:23:26] when we heard the eagle scream brother B
[1:23:28] said you Rapture it up quickly to meet
[1:23:30] it what he says your soul raptured
[1:23:32] didn't it what happened in the opening
[1:23:34] of the seal something in me went to a
[1:23:36] whole another level and now it's
[1:23:39] changing my body amen it's bringing this
[1:23:41] body subject to the word until it
[1:23:43] finally brings it completely subject and
[1:23:45] changes my
[1:23:47] atoms let's go to Hebrews
[1:23:49] 11 now five let's go up a few verses
[1:23:55] by faith Enoch was
[1:23:58] translated right how was Enoch
[1:24:01] translated by faith how was Enoch
[1:24:04] Changed by faith how was Enoch raptured
[1:24:06] by Faith by faith Enoch was translated
[1:24:09] that he should not see death and was not
[1:24:11] found because God had translated him for
[1:24:13] before his translation he had this
[1:24:15] testimony that he please God and without
[1:24:18] faith it is impossible to please him for
[1:24:20] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:24:21] he is and that he's a rewarder of them
[1:24:24] that diligently seek Him how was Enoch
[1:24:27] translated by the power of
[1:24:31] God
[1:24:33] yeah was he translated by
[1:24:36] Grace yeah by the power of God yes by
[1:24:40] the will of God
[1:24:42] yes but what does the scripture
[1:24:45] say by faith Enoch was translated how
[1:24:48] did Enoch access Grace the will of God
[1:24:51] the power of God he accessed it by
[1:24:54] faith amen and how did he get that faith
[1:24:59] it was already in him how did it come to
[1:25:01] manifestation because he walked with
[1:25:04] God he was walking with the word brother
[1:25:07] benam he he dramatizes it for us he said
[1:25:10] he was walking with the word for
[1:25:11] hundreds of years walking with the word
[1:25:13] and finally he got so far down the road
[1:25:16] what was he doing down the road he was
[1:25:18] walking with the word what is the bride
[1:25:20] doing she's walking with the word
[1:25:23] amen and and by that the word the word
[1:25:27] that he was walking with amen was
[1:25:29] unlocking the faith that was in him as
[1:25:31] he was walking with the word and hearing
[1:25:32] the word it was increasing his faith
[1:25:34] until he got so far down the road this
[1:25:37] is what brother Brenham says he got so
[1:25:38] far down the road and says I think I'll
[1:25:40] just go on and not go back home this
[1:25:42] time God all a sudden you say what what
[1:25:45] was it was it the will of God was it the
[1:25:47] decision of God was it the power of God
[1:25:49] the answer is yes but the way brother
[1:25:51] Brown describes it is when Enoch
[1:25:53] realized I don't have to go back
[1:25:55] something un locked inside of him and a
[1:25:57] faith that said I'm so far down this
[1:25:59] walk with God that I'm just going to go
[1:26:01] on and not go back what was it to Enoch
[1:26:04] it was
[1:26:08] Faith sometimes we think it's going to
[1:26:10] be God pulling a big lever
[1:26:15] chunk and then the atoms are going to
[1:26:18] change no it's going to be the power of
[1:26:21] God Amen it's going to be by
[1:26:23] Grace is that right it's going to be by
[1:26:26] his
[1:26:27] will but how is it all going to come
[1:26:29] into manifestation by
[1:26:34] faith brother B says in the Rapture
[1:26:38] message he says but to the church the
[1:26:40] bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:26:44] her it's revealed to her that the
[1:26:47] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[1:26:49] be waiting for that revelation of the
[1:26:53] Rapture now it is a revelation for the
[1:26:56] Revelation is Faith you cannot have a
[1:26:59] revelation without a being faith faith
[1:27:01] is a revelation because it's something
[1:27:03] that's revealed to you faith is a
[1:27:07] revelation the Rapture is a revelation
[1:27:09] to
[1:27:10] her amen how many believe that the
[1:27:14] Rapture has
[1:27:15] come that's a revelation to
[1:27:18] her we're not waiting for the Rapture to
[1:27:20] come we're waiting for the Rapture to go
[1:27:22] and the going of the Rapture is another
[1:27:24] level of
[1:27:26] revelation will it be will it be by will
[1:27:29] it be by faith or will it be by the
[1:27:31] power of God will it be by faith or will
[1:27:32] it be the will of God will it be by
[1:27:34] faith or will it be by grace and the
[1:27:35] answer is
[1:27:38] yes but it's going to take the mechanism
[1:27:40] of Faith because faith is the
[1:27:44] access and the message absolute all the
[1:27:46] way back in 1962 right at the end of 62
[1:27:50] this is December 30th says and I
[1:27:52] remember when he swept down here in that
[1:27:54] big light standing Yonder at the bottom
[1:27:56] of the river 1933 in June when he said
[1:27:59] as John the Baptist was sent forth and
[1:28:01] forrun the first coming of Christ I send
[1:28:04] you with a message to the world to
[1:28:05] forerun the second coming of Christ and
[1:28:08] around the world she went when Revival
[1:28:11] fires had been built for 15 years in
[1:28:13] nearly every Mountain Divine Healing
[1:28:15] across the Nations and the power and
[1:28:17] restoration and now I believe she is
[1:28:19] ready to strike that final climax Yonder
[1:28:22] what's he preaching he's preaching right
[1:28:24] at the end of 1962 what's going to
[1:28:26] happen the next month the next month
[1:28:27] he's going to put the sword in his hand
[1:28:30] and then he's going to send him right
[1:28:31] back then he's going to get caught up in
[1:28:33] a constellation of angels and he's going
[1:28:34] to get sent right back for the opening
[1:28:35] of the seals what is this climax that's
[1:28:37] coming it's the opening of the word it's
[1:28:39] Christ coming to his
[1:28:41] bride he said now I believe she is ready
[1:28:43] to strike that final climax Yonder to
[1:28:46] bring forth a faith that will Rapture
[1:28:48] the church in the glory amen and she is
[1:28:51] laying in the messages we are really at
[1:28:54] the end time we've talked about it and
[1:28:57] everything but the thing has moved upon
[1:28:59] us
[1:29:01] now it's upon us now it's all around us
[1:29:06] now rapturing Grace is here the power of
[1:29:10] the Rapture is here what's our access
[1:29:15] faith and the and the bride goes up word
[1:29:19] by
[1:29:20] word
[1:29:22] why are we coming to church because he's
[1:29:24] constantly unveiling himself and
[1:29:26] unveiling himself he's unveiling us to
[1:29:28] us so that we have the
[1:29:31] faith to conceive we have the faith to
[1:29:35] walk into the Promise by the word of God
[1:29:37] and God is constantly unveiling himself
[1:29:40] to
[1:29:41] us you know there's there's no point in
[1:29:44] worrying about whether you're going to
[1:29:46] make the Rapture or
[1:29:48] not because if you're in the Rapture
[1:29:50] you're going to make the rapture
[1:29:55] if you've if you've resurrected out of
[1:29:57] dead denomination and you've been caught
[1:29:59] up out of Leo DEA and moved into Christ
[1:30:02] amen don't worry the same faith that
[1:30:05] took you into that transition is going
[1:30:06] to change your atom someday and how's it
[1:30:09] going to come it's going to be a
[1:30:10] revelation that strikes amen it's going
[1:30:12] to be the same thing that lifted you out
[1:30:14] of leoda the same thing that lifted you
[1:30:16] out of a denominational way and brought
[1:30:19] you into a bride and brought you into a
[1:30:21] union with Christ that same thing the
[1:30:23] faith on the word of God that brought
[1:30:25] you there is the same thing that's going
[1:30:27] to bring the culmination of the Rapture
[1:30:28] in your life and change your Adams you
[1:30:31] don't have to worry about missing it you
[1:30:32] can't miss it you are it you're in it
[1:30:34] it's all around you amen the faith that
[1:30:36] he's delivering to us is going to match
[1:30:38] the faith that's in the seed and unlock
[1:30:41] access to a body
[1:30:45] chain amen you don't have to worry about
[1:30:48] missing it you're not going to miss it
[1:30:49] if God's already placed inside of you
[1:30:51] something that's been able to make all
[1:30:53] of these moves how do you think you got
[1:30:55] here you got here by the faith of God
[1:30:57] that he's placed down inside of you and
[1:30:58] when he brought the revelation of the
[1:31:00] word there was something in you to
[1:31:01] respond to that Revelation and move out
[1:31:04] you've left false ideas you've left
[1:31:06] false Notions you've left selfishness
[1:31:08] you've left family you've left church
[1:31:10] Traditions you've left it all and moved
[1:31:11] into Christ what did that amen how did
[1:31:14] you access Christ in our day by faith
[1:31:16] where did you get the Faith from the
[1:31:18] seed where did you get the seed from God
[1:31:20] Amen praise
[1:31:25] God don't worry he that's begun a good
[1:31:27] work in
[1:31:29] you he that's begun a good work with you
[1:31:32] will not cease till he's completed
[1:31:35] it it's no fear and will I make the
[1:31:38] message will I will I make the Rapture
[1:31:40] listen don't let anybody preach that to
[1:31:43] you you know it could be today you may
[1:31:44] not make the Rapture amen I made the
[1:31:46] Rapture before the foundation of the
[1:31:48] world and the mind of God I already made
[1:31:51] the rapture nobody's going to preach me
[1:31:52] in and nobody's going to preach me out
[1:31:54] it was determined by the thoughts of God
[1:31:56] before the foundation of the world and
[1:31:58] he planted something inside my soul to
[1:32:01] secure my access to the Rapture and that
[1:32:04] was a part of himself a part of the word
[1:32:06] that when the word is unveiled this word
[1:32:08] and that word they come together like
[1:32:10] magnetism and they unlock a faith inside
[1:32:13] to reach out and obtain whatever the
[1:32:15] word
[1:32:16] is if you've moved thus far you should
[1:32:19] Rejoice amen there's no fear not going
[1:32:21] to make it the same thing that brought
[1:32:23] you here is the same thing that take you
[1:32:25] all the
[1:32:28] way oh God is good amen once God unlocks
[1:32:33] that Revelation he takes fear out of the
[1:32:36] equation we have nothing to fear oh the
[1:32:40] future's
[1:32:42] bright oh the world's getting dark but
[1:32:44] the future is bright bad things are
[1:32:46] going on all around but that's the
[1:32:48] setting for the wonderful things that
[1:32:50] are transpiring in our day
[1:32:54] Shalom little bride good morning all is
[1:32:58] well this is a wonderful day to be alive
[1:33:02] this is a wonderful day to be on earth
[1:33:04] yes sir amen we're going to go far
[1:33:08] beyond far beyond what the church has
[1:33:10] ever done
[1:33:12] am amen that's right that
[1:33:17] right we're we're we're
[1:33:19] going to an AB absolute change in the
[1:33:23] body and the moment and the twinkling of
[1:33:24] an eye when the atoms the very cell
[1:33:27] structure changes into a glorified
[1:33:32] body can you fathom it no can you figure
[1:33:36] it out no do you understand the
[1:33:38] mechanics of that if you do please come
[1:33:41] and explain something to me because I
[1:33:43] have no clue how that's going to happen
[1:33:45] What will be the circumstances what will
[1:33:47] it look like what exactly will happen I
[1:33:49] don't know are you afraid you'll miss it
[1:33:51] abs absolutely not because there's no
[1:33:53] chance of me ever making it there's not
[1:33:55] even a chance of me being saved if he
[1:33:57] didn't predetermine I'd be saved and if
[1:33:59] he didn't put something in me to believe
[1:34:00] with the very fact that I can believe in
[1:34:02] my salvation I can believe in the change
[1:34:04] of my adom because it's the very same
[1:34:07] mechanism that caused me to believe in
[1:34:08] healing caus me to believe in Salvation
[1:34:10] is the very same access I'll get to the
[1:34:13] change of my
[1:34:14] ad do I need to worry about it no what
[1:34:17] do I need to do stay in the word hear
[1:34:19] the word stay under the umbrella of the
[1:34:21] word and let the word wash away
[1:34:22] everything that's not there and have it
[1:34:24] keep unlocking the faith that's on the
[1:34:26] inside until this this brid tree keeps
[1:34:28] growing and blooming and producing
[1:34:31] fruit praise God I don't know about you
[1:34:34] but I'm happy to be alive I'm happy that
[1:34:36] this reality is already struck and I'm
[1:34:38] not worried about what comes next I'm so
[1:34:40] excited with what's here amen there's no
[1:34:42] doubt in my mind that what comes next
[1:34:44] I'm a part of as
[1:34:47] well it's the same mechanism the same
[1:34:50] access what gave us access all along
[1:34:52] will continue to give us access to every
[1:34:56] promise of God it'll be by
[1:34:59] faith amen let's all
[1:35:02] stand that was one statement that
[1:35:04] brother Eugene made he made a lot of
[1:35:07] other statements
[1:35:09] friend we may have a series called post
[1:35:12] Camp
[1:35:14] statements oh I don't want to miss what
[1:35:17] God's given to us I don't want to miss
[1:35:20] even the weekend that we just had and
[1:35:22] the tremendous preaching I don't want to
[1:35:24] just move on to more I want to say Lord
[1:35:26] what was that you were showing us what
[1:35:28] was it you wanted us to
[1:35:30] catch because the preaching of the word
[1:35:32] is not
[1:35:35] entertainment the preaching of the word
[1:35:37] is not so we can go home with an
[1:35:38] enthusiasm and excitement and the
[1:35:40] preaching of his word is not so we can
[1:35:42] go home and pick it apart and criticize
[1:35:43] it well he forgot that quote and he
[1:35:44] forgot this quote and he should have
[1:35:46] taken it from that
[1:35:48] angle no the preaching of the word is to
[1:35:52] change us from Glory into glory to bring
[1:35:56] the word so that so something in us can
[1:35:58] respond back to that
[1:36:00] word amen because the bride goes up word
[1:36:03] by word are you going up do you feel
