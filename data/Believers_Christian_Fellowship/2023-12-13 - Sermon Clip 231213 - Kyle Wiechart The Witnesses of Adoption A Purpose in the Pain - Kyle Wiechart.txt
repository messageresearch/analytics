========================================

if you've ever bought a car or bought a house uh there's a witness you ever notice that there's never a transfer of ownership from one hand to another unless there's Witnesses present right you get a notary public and he's he's identified by the the local governments as a true witness one that can be trusted to oversee this transfer of ownership from the hands of one to the hands of another and so if there's going to be Witnesses on the scene there must be going to a great transfer here of responsibility and ownership from one's hand to another's hand and if I would like to recall to your mind take the book eat the book out of the hand of him that sth so there's going to be a great transfer of responsibility here as brother brandham said in Jesus's Mount Transfiguration when he said this was his adopted moment he said now father could sit down and rest his son would complete the work and so now we know that God is wanting to take a rest he's waiting for your witnesses to arrive on the scene to witness the transfer of ownership and to enforce redemptions rights and those Witnesses very simple faith hope and charity not how well you understand the Seven Seals a living epistle being read of all men a life lived a life expressed taking the book and eating the book and thundering out the mystery of Christ in your own life that's the Thunder I think prophet of God said the voice of what a thousand lived lives read and so these Witnesses must be on the scene there's also another time that you bring Witnesses on a scene it's in a court case have judge if you're on a prosecution or defense both sides produce Witnesses both against and or for and we know when Jesus was condemned to death they brought forth false Witnesses because see death could not be pronounced unless there was Witnesses but we also know that in 1963 when that cloud came down it was the white wigged one the judge for the judge is here to enforce redemption's rights and if redemption's rights is changing hands from him that sth upon the throne to him that was told to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again there must must be three Witnesses witnessing and enforcing life amen testim testifying that life is here as there was false witnesses to condemn him there is true Witnesses here to testify that life has come to you and to me and those Witnesses are faith hope and charity
