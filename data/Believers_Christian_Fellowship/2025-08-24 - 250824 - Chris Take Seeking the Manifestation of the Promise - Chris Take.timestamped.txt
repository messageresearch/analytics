[30:47] true. If you relax, you just, you know,
[30:49] hey, so we're just going to pull up our
[30:50] feet to the table today and um just let
[30:54] the Lord speak to our hearts.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Man, you want to pull up the PowerPoint
[30:58] for me? you know, I'm I'm not a a
[31:00] teacher and um so I'm not super great
[31:04] with PowerPoints. Um so I jump around
[31:07] sometimes, so brother uh whoever's up
[31:09] there on the slides might have to help
[31:12] me out here this morning. But I wanted
[31:14] you to be able to uh read the quotes
[31:17] with me and see the scriptures with me
[31:19] because I have a lot of them and uh I
[31:21] have a lot on our plate this morning. So
[31:24] just trusting the Lord would put it all
[31:26] together for us. And um unfortunately
[31:30] usually what happens is if I have more
[31:32] it still somehow fits in about an hour
[31:35] just comes out a lot faster.
[31:38] So uh we pray that the Lord gives you
[31:42] extra sharp ears this morning or he just
[31:44] helps us to take our time. Amen. We want
[31:47] to minister today on seeking the
[31:49] manifestation of the promise.

[32:36] the Ben and the Kyle just uh
[32:40] we're just uh we're just part of the
[32:43] body
[32:45] &gt;&gt; we're just we're here and you're there
[32:48] &gt;&gt; that's about it we're counting on him
[32:51] &gt;&gt; to speak to us
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 3 in Those days came
[32:56] John the Baptist preaching in the
[32:58] wilderness of Judea and saying,"Repent
[33:00] ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at
[33:03] hand. For this is he that was spoken of
[33:05] by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice
[33:08] of one crying in the wilderness, prepare
[33:10] ye the way of the Lord, make his path
[33:12] straight." And the same John had his
[33:16] raignment of camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair, and the
[33:18] leather girdle about his loins, and his
[33:20] meat was locusts and wild honey. then
[33:24] went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea
[33:27] and all the region round about Jordan
[33:29] and were baptized of him in Jordan,
[33:31] confessing their sins. But when he saw
[33:34] many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come
[33:36] to his baptism, he said unto them, "Oh
[33:39] generation of vipers, who hath warned
[33:41] you to flee from the wrath to come.
[33:44] Bring forth therefore fruits meet for
[33:47] repentance." And think not to say within
[33:49] yourselves, we have Abraham to our
[33:51] father. For I say unto you, that God is
[33:54] able of these stones to raise up
[33:55] children unto Abraham. And now also the
[33:58] axe is laid unto the root of the trees.
[34:01] Therefore, every tree which bringeth
[34:03] forth not fruit, good bringeth not forth
[34:07] good fruit is heuned down and cast into
[34:09] the fire. But Jesus talks about that
[34:13] pruning the vines, right? Cutting the
[34:15] branches off. They don't bring forth the
[34:16] fruit. I indeed baptize you with water
[34:19] unto repentance, but he that cometh
[34:21] after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
[34:23] I am not worthy to bear. He shall
[34:26] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[34:28] fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he
[34:31] will thoroughly purge his floor, and
[34:33] gather his wheat into the garner, but he
[34:35] will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[34:37] fire. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to
[34:40] Jordan unto John to be baptized of him.
[34:43] But John forbade him, saying, I have
[34:45] need to be baptized of thee, and comest
[34:48] thou to me. And Jesus answering said
[34:50] unto him, Suffer it to be so now, for
[34:52] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[34:55] righteousness. Then he suffered him. And
[34:58] Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
[34:59] straight out of the water, and lo, the
[35:01] heavens were open unto him, and he saw
[35:03] the Spirit of God descending like a
[35:05] dove, and lighting upon him. and low a
[35:08] voice from heaven saying, "This is my
[35:10] beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[35:13] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[35:15] Lord Jesus, we are so thankful to be
[35:17] here this morning. So thankful we have a
[35:19] place to come to worship you, Lord, to
[35:22] hear your words spoken. Father, may it
[35:25] truly be said in the spirit of truth,
[35:27] Lord, this morning. May you just move in
[35:29] our hearts. May we receive your words
[35:31] that you have for us. May may new
[35:34] understanding just light our light upon
[35:37] our souls, Lord. That we could see you,
[35:39] Father, greater than we had yesterday,
[35:41] greater than we did this morning,
[35:43] Father. That and in do in doing so, we
[35:46] would draw nearer to you, Father. We
[35:48] thank you, Lord. We just thank you for
[35:49] each one that is here. May you bless
[35:51] them, Father, for coming. Anoint their
[35:53] ears. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we
[35:55] pray. Amen. You can have your seats
[35:57] today.
[35:59] So,
[36:02] seeking the manifestation of the
[36:04] promise. So, the big thing we want to
[36:06] know is what how do we know we're saved?
[36:09] How do we know we got the Holy Ghost? Uh
[36:12] we want to know what is it that we're
[36:14] looking for to know we're walking with
[36:16] God and we're part of God. And and those
[36:18] are those are some of the big questions
[36:20] that we face and and some of the big
[36:21] questions that of the the world faces,
[36:24] right? They and then we see this the
[36:27] problem in denominations is is then
[36:29] there some kind of name on a book uh you
[36:32] you uh you know said some kind of um you
[36:36] know glossalia or some kind of gibberish
[36:38] and you were that that shows you're
[36:40] saved or or there's some uh you do
[36:43] something outside in your flesh and and
[36:46] it shows that you're saved. And brother
[36:48] Brandon had people come to him saying I
[36:50] I don't know if I'm saved. I'm
[36:51] concerned. I'm confused. and he would he
[36:54] would talk to them and and he would see
[36:56] where their heart was and and brother
[36:58] Brandham would minister and he would say
[37:00] that you know that that the evidence
[37:01] that Christ is within you is the fact
[37:03] that you can say amen to every word. So
[37:05] then we're making sure we say amen every
[37:08] time cuz we're looking to hear ourselves
[37:11] testify that something has changed
[37:12] within us. But the biggest thing that we
[37:15] know that we can look at is we look in
[37:18] we look behind us and we realize we're
[37:21] not the person we were. We realize that
[37:24] there's something that's pulling and
[37:26] drawing us deeper into the word of God.
[37:28] And and someone would come to you and
[37:30] say, "Show me, you know, tell me what it
[37:32] is that that that gives you that
[37:34] evidence that that tell me what it is
[37:36] that shows you that you are the
[37:38] manifestation of the promise." And many
[37:41] times we can begin to testify and begin
[37:43] to share how, you know, we're closer to
[37:45] the Lord and how the the Lord opened
[37:47] this up and you were reading in your
[37:48] scripture in your in your in the book
[37:50] and listening to the sermons and
[37:52] something ministered to your heart and
[37:54] they can look at you and say, I don't
[37:56] know what you're talking about. I need
[37:58] evidence.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; And many times, if we're not careful, we
[38:02] fall into that same trap when all he
[38:05] said was, "Seek you first the kingdom of
[38:06] God." Yes.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "And all these things
[38:10] shall be added unto you." In other
[38:12] words, in other words, as you pursue
[38:14] Christ because of the desire in your
[38:17] heart for Christ, that testifies you
[38:19] were part of Christ before the
[38:21] foundation of the world. And many times
[38:24] that is not enough for ourselves. We we
[38:26] are not satisfied with that. And he's
[38:28] asking us, look, just seek the
[38:30] manifestation of the promise. Just seek
[38:32] it. Seek me. Look to me. Testify of me.
[38:36] and and and then you look back and now
[38:39] as you get further down as you mature as
[38:41] a believer someone can ask you and you
[38:42] could say come live with me for a few
[38:45] days and I'll show you come let's let's
[38:48] walk with me a a a pace walk with me you
[38:51] know how did the the two on the road to
[38:53] Emmas know he was it was him he began to
[38:57] minister to them along the way he he
[38:59] they said walk with us and he walked
[39:01] with them and it was when he broke the
[39:03] bread when he did something that
[39:05] testified of who that he was before his
[39:08] death. All the words that they spoke was
[39:11] quickened to their hearts and they
[39:13] realized who he was. It wasn't just that
[39:15] a man stepped forth and broke a piece of
[39:17] bread open. It was that vindicating. It
[39:20] was the manifestation of the promise
[39:22] that he ministered to them along the
[39:25] way.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about, you know,
[39:28] Jesus and all of these things. And and
[39:30] here I'm already way ahead in different
[39:31] places all over, so maybe we just had
[39:33] the slides for no reason. But um he's
[39:36] talking about Jesus and he says, "Well,
[39:38] how do you know that that he was Jesus?"
[39:41] He says, "Because he manifested what the
[39:43] word said about him.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; He he was a virgin born of a virgin. You
[39:48] know, he came from Bethlehem." And and
[39:50] you would think you would say, "Well,
[39:52] why didn't God just make it more
[39:53] simple?" And it was, you know, a nice
[39:56] bulleted list. You know, anybody here
[39:58] like bulleted lists, right? I was
[40:01] explaining to my wife the other day how
[40:02] my brain works and she just shook her
[40:03] head and walked away. So, we're still
[40:05] married though.
[40:07] Actually, today is 12 years. I just been
[40:10] super blessed with my wife and
[40:16] thank you. Appreciate that. I just uh
[40:19] she's the best thing that ever happened
[40:20] to me outside of salvation. It's true.
[40:21] Brother Brandham says it's a great
[40:24] adventure. So,
[40:27] we would like a nice bulleted list, but
[40:29] you know,
[40:32] she said it was an angel
[40:34] and she's from Nazareth.
[40:37] And then and then they lived in or G or
[40:41] I forget the first town she was at. Then
[40:43] they move from from Egypt. They
[40:45] disappear. Bethlehem. He's born in
[40:47] Bethlehem. Just a blip on the map. And
[40:49] then he's gone. And they're back to this
[40:51] town and that town. They're in Egypt.
[40:53] They come back from Egypt and people are
[40:55] looking at them and say well you're from
[40:56] Nazareth
[40:57] just well why couldn't it be simple you
[40:59] know like they grew up in Bethlehem both
[41:03] of them Mary and Joseph and then and
[41:06] then and then there was you know more a
[41:07] priest came and said yes
[41:10] believe Mary she received seed of the of
[41:14] the Lord the Holy Spirit overshadow her
[41:15] yes a priest would come and say and then
[41:17] all of a sudden Kaius would wake up and
[41:19] say I had a dream or I had a vision and
[41:21] there's a woman in Bethlehem hand by the
[41:23] name of Mary and she's pregnant and
[41:25] she's pregnant of the of the Holy Spirit
[41:27] and she's going to bring forth the
[41:28] promised son of the Messiah and then we
[41:31] can all begin to prepare for this like
[41:33] that we say that would have been so much
[41:35] easier.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; That would have been so much more
[41:38] organized.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we we we look and we see, you
[41:42] know, we drive by. There's lots of them
[41:44] here. There's one right that's the
[41:46] entrance. Is that the cornfield there?
[41:49] I'm so turned around in here. The
[41:50] cornfield's there. There's a corn field
[41:52] somewhere in the proximity of this
[41:54] building and it's in nice neat rows. How
[41:56] do we know? You know, we can look at it
[41:58] and we know man put that there cuz it's
[42:01] in nice neat rows.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; You go out in the jungle or you go down
[42:04] into the the wilderness and you know the
[42:07] streams don't run in straight lines.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; The the trees, they're just, you know,
[42:11] they all grow together and then you
[42:13] can't even walk through the brush and
[42:15] and and it's just thick and it looks
[42:17] like chaos. Yet, leave it alone and it
[42:20] thrives. Yeah,
[42:21] &gt;&gt; leave that corn field alone. It won't be
[42:24] here next year.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Something else will be there.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; That's God's organization.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; So, we say, well, you know, if God would
[42:34] have done it this way, it would have
[42:36] been all crystal clear,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; but that's man's organization. Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; See, God wants you God wants you to be
[42:46] pursuing
[42:48] the manifestation of the promise that
[42:49] he's given you.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let's jump back here talking about
[42:56] John the Baptist. And we know we know
[42:58] this this is uh familiar to us. He's
[43:02] out. Brother Brandham's out baptizing.
[43:04] And when he baptizes the 17th person, he
[43:07] heard a voice say, "Look up." He looks
[43:09] up and that pillar of fire come circling
[43:11] down out of the heavens stood right over
[43:13] where I was at and said, "As John the
[43:15] Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[43:17] coming of Christ, your message will
[43:18] forrun the second coming." In Matthew 21
[43:23] 32 says, "For John came unto you."
[43:27] Nice. Those are nice screens. For John
[43:29] came unto you in the way of
[43:31] righteousness. Now Jesus is speaking of
[43:33] of John. And you believed him not. But
[43:36] the publicans and the harlots believed
[43:39] and when you had seen it repented not
[43:42] afterward that you might believe him. So
[43:44] in other words Jesus is saying at some
[43:47] point afterwards you realized who John
[43:50] was. But even in that even in that state
[43:53] they couldn't overcome the fact that he
[43:55] didn't manifest the promise in the way
[43:57] that he they thought he should.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; So they were seeking they come to him
[44:02] and saying look be honest with us.
[44:05] illustrate who are you.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; And he quotes to them scripture.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; He is going by way of manifesting
[44:14] who he he excuse me he is going by way
[44:16] of vindicating who he is by manifesting
[44:19] the word to them.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; But you see they never received the word
[44:24] to begin with. Had they received the
[44:27] word to begin with when he quoted them
[44:29] scripture, they would have say, "Ah,
[44:31] yes."
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And what would they have done? This is
[44:34] what we're going to get to, but I like
[44:35] to just throw out these hints here. What
[44:37] would they have? They what they excuse
[44:39] me, they would have then said, "Where's
[44:42] Jesus?"
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're the man you say you are,
[44:46] the Messiah is close at hand.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; The same thing with the prophet in our
[44:51] age. If people really believed who he
[44:54] was, they would be looking for Christ.
[44:56] They would be saying, "Where is Jesus?
[44:58] You're the man who's supposed to forerun
[45:00] his second coming, and where is he?"
[45:05] &gt;&gt; So now he says, you didn't even believe
[45:07] him. Mark Mark 1:7 to 8. And preached,
[45:10] saying, "There cometh one mightier than
[45:12] I after me, the latchet of whose shoes
[45:15] I'm not worthy to stoop down and
[45:17] unloosed. I have indeed baptized you
[45:19] with water. He shall baptize you with
[45:22] the Holy Ghost. So right here, put a
[45:25] little sticky note in your mind
[45:28] that John had a first and a second
[45:30] ministry.
[45:32] But the whole point of those two, he
[45:34] says, "I baptize you with water, but
[45:36] he's coming to baptize you with the
[45:39] word, to give you the word, to give you
[45:42] the completion of the thing that I am
[45:44] pointing you to." He is the one that's
[45:47] coming. So in other words, there's
[45:49] something coming. all of this, you have
[45:50] followed my ministry up to this point.
[45:53] And something began to stir within John
[45:56] and see something begin to stir within
[45:59] John and he realized he's coming. He's
[46:01] here. He's close at hand.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; What was it? All that I have said to you
[46:06] to this point is is to bring you to the
[46:09] position to receive him when he comes.
[46:13] You see, the men of the church didn't
[46:16] catch the vision of the ministry of
[46:18] John.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; In a simple example, those who should
[46:22] have recognized who he was
[46:27] didn't.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; They were looking to man to reveal
[46:33] Christ.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; They were looking saying, "Where's the
[46:36] one that's going to tell us? We need
[46:38] them to speak plainly. Tell us who you
[46:40] are.
[46:42] tell us when he's coming. You know,
[46:44] Jesus, how how is it that Jesus?
[46:50] The Pharisees came to him and said, "Who
[46:52] who are you?" You know, they they just
[46:54] they mean
[46:56] every time they came, I'm sure in his
[46:58] spirit because he was all God and all
[46:59] man. He probably just groaned inwardly.
[47:02] Here they are again. Here we go. Right?
[47:06] And so they would say, they would ask
[47:08] him over and over and over again, "Who
[47:10] are you?" you know, you say this or you
[47:12] heard this, you've done this. What? Who
[47:13] are you?
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And he would just seemingly give them
[47:17] riddles.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; But he was speaking to them. He was
[47:20] pointing them back to what the word said
[47:22] about him.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But because they didn't believe the
[47:24] word,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; they didn't receive him.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; And they walked away shaking their
[47:28] heads, you know, planning his demise
[47:31] &gt;&gt; because he was he was he was destroying
[47:34] the the kingdom. He was destroying the
[47:37] control that they had over him, over the
[47:40] people,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And so, but then there's this woman at
[47:44] the well, a prostitute. She, you know,
[47:47] who knew the word, right? Cuz she quotes
[47:49] the word to Jesus.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; What happens is she before he even
[47:54] begins to say who he is,
[47:57] obviously she had never seen him before
[47:59] cuz she didn't say, "Oh, you're that
[48:00] Jesus guy."
[48:01] &gt;&gt; She didn't know who he was. He's just
[48:03] some guy there at the well. And and
[48:05] she's probably thinking, "No, you know,
[48:07] probably another customer."
[48:10] &gt;&gt; And he begins to say things to her. He
[48:12] begins to minister to her through the
[48:13] first poll.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; The ministry begins to her and he begins
[48:17] to talk to her and speak to her. And
[48:19] then he discerns her spirit. And because
[48:21] she already believed the word of the
[48:24] Messiah.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; As he begins to minister to her, he
[48:30] hasn't even he hasn't he's just saying,
[48:32] "Hey, the living water, you drink of
[48:34] that, you never thirst again." And so on
[48:36] and so forth. And she's like, "Man, this
[48:38] sounds very interesting." Something was
[48:41] responding to her. And we we want proof.
[48:45] Oh my goodness.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; We want proof. There's your proof. But
[48:49] you see, that's not good enough for sign
[48:51] seekers.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we can be
[48:55] tricked by that spirit and say, "Well,
[48:56] you need to show me something." Look,
[48:58] look, like, give me some kind of
[49:00] evidence. And, and there, right, there
[49:02] is the evidence.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And the woman at the well says, and then
[49:06] he discerns her heart. Brother calls
[49:09] that the messianic sign. He discerns her
[49:11] heart and she says, "You know what?
[49:13] There's a Messiah coming.
[49:17] There's a there's something in her eyes.
[49:18] You never you ever meet somebody?
[49:21] I've met you before. I've never met you.
[49:22] So, we walk up. No, that's not going to
[49:24] work because I need somebody I've met
[49:25] before. We see you. I haven't seen you
[49:27] in a few years. Okay. For example, and
[49:30] and I see you across in in Walmart
[49:33] or uh you know, the auto parts store,
[49:36] some cooler than Walmart. And uh
[49:38] Cabelas, how about that?
[49:41] And I see you over there at the fishing
[49:43] lures and I'm like, "Man, that guy looks
[49:45] familiar." And you look at me, before we
[49:48] say the words, what's your name again?
[49:51] Sorry. Joseph. Brother Joseph. Before we
[49:54] say the name, Brother Jo, Brother Chris,
[49:56] there's a twinkle in the eye. There's a
[49:58] a little recognition in the eye and we
[50:00] say that's brother Joseph, right? What
[50:03] your the thoughts you have of him,
[50:05] suddenly it all clicks together and
[50:06] there's a spark in the eye and you
[50:08] realize he recognized me. Yeah.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; So that's why you can't run away
[50:13] cuz we see it before we say it that that
[50:16] person recognized us. So there's a
[50:18] recognition. So she's sitting there at
[50:20] the well and or she's standing and Jesus
[50:22] is sitting and and and he says and he he
[50:25] says, you know, yeah, you have five
[50:26] husbands and the one you're with now is
[50:28] you're not even married to. And
[50:30] something in her eyes sparks and she
[50:32] goes, when the Messiah comes, he's going
[50:34] to talk just like you. And she's
[50:36] thinking, could it be? Yeah.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Could it be?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And then the third poll,
[50:43] &gt;&gt; he says, "I am he that speaketh to
[50:46] thee."
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he do that to the Pharisees?
[50:51] &gt;&gt; He was he in this in this way. He was
[50:54] trying to
[50:56] &gt;&gt; But they didn't believe what the word
[50:58] said about him.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; They skipped over that part. A virgin
[51:01] shall conceive after many, many years
[51:04] after Isaiah prophesied that. I mean,
[51:06] Isaiah wasn't even a favorable guy.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; So, he said that, you know, did they
[51:12] even talk about it much? They they did,
[51:15] right?
[51:19] They said they believed it. They said
[51:22] yes. I say amen to that.
[51:25] But when the manifestation of the
[51:27] promise was standing there, they could
[51:30] not receive it.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; They could not receive it. So we today
[51:34] are seeking the manifestation of this
[51:36] promise.
[51:39] He says, "And he came into all the
[51:41] countries." Jesus speaking of John,
[51:45] "He came into all the country about
[51:47] Jordan preaching the baptism of
[51:49] repentance for the remission of sins."
[51:52] So we know that and then he so so this
[51:55] is John's ministry. It's just a few
[51:57] scriptures to to refresh our memory on
[52:00] the ministry of John up to Jesus.
[52:07] So,
[52:09] brother uh John says that he's coming to
[52:12] baptize you with the Holy Spirit, to the
[52:14] Holy Ghost. But that didn't come until
[52:16] after Jesus died and you know
[52:20] resurrected again and ascended up and
[52:23] the disciples went into the upper room
[52:25] and begin to pray. Then he sent them
[52:29] what he called the comforter.
[52:31] But John's saying he's coming to baptize
[52:35] you in the Holy Spirit. And Jesus
[52:37] baptized people. But then but then there
[52:41] was there was there was it was it was
[52:45] what was pointing
[52:47] John is basically pointing to he is the
[52:50] beginning.
[52:52] He is the beginning of that promise. He
[52:56] is the the one he's coming. So they're
[52:58] looking to him and they're looking to
[53:00] Jesus saying okay and then he dies
[53:05] and they're saying John's word never
[53:07] came to pass.
[53:09] And then now all you have all these
[53:12] disciples and just hang on with me. You
[53:13] have all these disciples who are saying
[53:15] yes Jesus rose again but the whole world
[53:18] didn't see it. The people who heard John
[53:20] didn't see it.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah right.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So many times God he he gives us
[53:28] excuse me John pointed to him but the
[53:31] completion of Christ's ministry was his
[53:35] return in spirit form to the church.
[53:39] Amen.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; So we see first, second pole, third
[53:42] pole. And we say polls because brother
[53:44] Brandon had this vision where he's
[53:45] fishing, right? Pole. That's a that's a
[53:48] pole. P U L L. First pull, right? It and
[53:51] it's you pull, you catch a fish, you're
[53:53] attracting. That was healing signs in
[53:56] the hands. Second pole we call it. That
[53:58] was just the vision where he he uh and
[54:00] I'm terrible at remembering all these
[54:01] details, but he pulls and he pulls too
[54:03] soon and it's a tangled mess. But that's
[54:04] the discernment. It's stages. You could
[54:07] say stages. First, second, third stages
[54:09] of the ministry. First stage was the
[54:11] healings and second stages was the
[54:13] discernment. The third stage was the
[54:15] point of his ministry.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And it was in that that he unveiled
[54:20] Christ. That Christ was unveiled to us
[54:23] because Christ himself came down.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Right. It's in Revelation says the
[54:27] beginning of the creation of God came in
[54:29] the leady and church age. Brother
[54:31] Brandham says that was Jesus Christ.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And he was created in the womb of Mary.
[54:37] So Jesus had three stages of his
[54:38] ministry as well. So John has three cha
[54:40] three three stages and here comes the
[54:43] word and he says this is him and there's
[54:45] a sign from heaven the cloud
[54:49] &gt;&gt; comes down says this is my son right now
[54:51] John must decrease
[54:54] &gt;&gt; so that he can increase because brother
[54:56] Bham says uh right here
[55:01] skip ahead in influence I must decrease
[55:04] he must increase God can't have two on
[55:07] earth at the same time Only one has the
[55:10] message. You know, I must decrease. He
[55:12] is the messenger. I've been up to this
[55:14] time. Now he takes my place.
[55:17] As Elisha, when Elijah went up and
[55:19] throwed back his robe to Elisha, his
[55:22] ministry was finished. Elisha must take
[55:24] up where he left off.
[55:27] We know Elisha is a type of the bride.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So take up where he left off. So now, so
[55:33] now all of the attention, all of the
[55:36] focus must go to Christ.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; But because we're men and we're living a
[55:43] fallen flesh, people were still attached
[55:46] to John's ministry.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And they came to Jesus and said, John
[55:51] has asked us, "Are you the one?" So John
[55:54] begins to struggle with everything
[55:55] that's happened. But then you know Jesus
[55:57] encourages him but but God has to take
[56:00] him off the scene completely take his he
[56:02] takes his life and and so
[56:06] the whole point and then and then you
[56:08] can again you can go and you can see the
[56:09] three stages of Jesus's ministry
[56:12] &gt;&gt; and the completion of that was
[56:15] redemption
[56:17] &gt;&gt; was the word coming to you and I
[56:20] &gt;&gt; so that Christ could indwell in his
[56:23] people. Yeah. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; But as we understand in the first church
[56:28] age, they lost that.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Because it had to be planted.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Many times we don't understand
[56:35] everything.
[56:37] He said it had to be planted so that it
[56:39] could bring forth
[56:41] &gt;&gt; the original seed today.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. So that was the dark ages. Okay.
[56:44] So now
[56:46] let's jump forward in history to a man
[56:49] by the name of Apollos.
[56:52] He says, ' And a certain Jew named
[56:53] Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
[56:56] man and mighty in scriptures, came to
[56:58] Ephesus. This man was instructed in the
[57:01] way of the Lord.
[57:05] Being fervent
[57:07] in the spirit, he spake and taught
[57:09] diligently the things of the Lord,
[57:12] knowing only the baptism of John.
[57:16] He's a second pole minister.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right. He is a second pole
[57:22] minister. He know he knew John
[57:26] but he hadn't been introduced to the
[57:29] opening of the word which was Christ.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And so much had happened. I where was
[57:34] this guy right? I mean he's fervent in
[57:37] the Lord and uh instructed in the way of
[57:40] the Lord fervent in the spirit and he
[57:41] diligently taught the things of the
[57:43] Lord. So he knew the word. He was
[57:45] preaching the word going boldly and he
[57:47] began to speak boldly in the synagogue
[57:50] whom when Aquilla and Priscilla had
[57:52] heard they took him. So now stop
[57:55] reading. So now
[57:57] so now they here he is speaking boldly
[58:00] in the synagogue and and this is where
[58:02] this is where we're praying on how this
[58:05] all works because we need Aquilla and
[58:07] Priscilla today.
[58:09] God opens up these opportunities for you
[58:12] to begin to minister in fellowship to
[58:14] your brothers and sisters and there's an
[58:16] opening there and there's a door there
[58:18] and and how God can begin to use you. So
[58:20] he's speaking bold and they took him and
[58:22] and here's what they did. They didn't
[58:24] correct him. They expounded unto him the
[58:28] way of God more perfectly.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; So now here's the thing. Here's the
[58:34] thing. He was along the way of God
[58:37] underneath that ministry of John the
[58:39] Baptist.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; He was along in there. He was in that
[58:42] process, but he had got stuck in a in a
[58:45] in a in that position underneath just up
[58:49] to the opening of the word. Just up to
[58:52] when we say opening of the word, we mean
[58:53] the revealing of Jesus Christ.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Just up to that position.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And they begin to tell him more
[59:02] perfectly. So you realize that that it's
[59:04] it's this thing about Christ, it's this
[59:07] thing underneath the ministry of the the
[59:09] of the word being revealed to us and
[59:11] open to us that that is is is more
[59:14] perfect. So in other words, if if I'm
[59:17] looking at a at a and I'm sorry to
[59:20] anyone who's not carpenter anyway,
[59:22] that's how I think of examples, but I
[59:24] think we're all fairly familiar. But if
[59:26] if I'm putting together we built
[59:29] cabinets for a while when I was a
[59:30] teenager. If I'm putting together a face
[59:32] frame for a cabinet
[59:35] and I have it I've taken each board and
[59:40] I've ran it through the planer so every
[59:41] board is exactly the same thickness down
[59:44] to a 64th.
[59:47] Then I take it and I glue it together.
[59:50] It looks really good, but it's not
[59:52] perfect.
[59:54] I must then sand it down starting with a
[59:58] with a high grit about 180 depending on
[1:00:02] 100 work from 100 grit to 120 grit to
[1:00:06] 220 grit
[1:00:08] and now I've expounded unto the face
[1:00:11] frame the way of the cabinet more
[1:00:14] perfectly. Yes.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; So, you could take that phrase frame and
[1:00:19] you see it many times on cheaper
[1:00:21] cabinets and they don't do that part
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; and it's there and you look at it with
[1:00:27] the understanding of the perfection of a
[1:00:31] face frame on a cabinet.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And you realize there's more that could
[1:00:36] be done with this.
[1:00:38] But until you know, until it's revealed
[1:00:41] to you, you look to that and say, "Wow,
[1:00:43] it's perfect."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; So Apollos is looking to what was
[1:00:48] revealed to him saying, "Wow, that's
[1:00:50] perfect."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; But there was something more.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; There was something more that had come
[1:00:56] that Paulos had missed.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So then it was expounded unto him. And a
[1:01:03] Aquilla took him while Priscilla made
[1:01:05] some coffee and tea cake and because
[1:01:09] she's minister ministered unto him as
[1:01:11] well.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Man,
[1:01:14] the best coffee I ever had
[1:01:19] and and he begins to tell him, you know,
[1:01:21] there's this thing called sandpaper."
[1:01:26] And Apollos says, 'You know, I was
[1:01:28] wondering about that. Because every once
[1:01:30] in a while, if you're a child of God,
[1:01:32] what he does is he shows you a glimpse
[1:01:35] of the perfection.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And you and you see it, and it's like it
[1:01:39] passes before you.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And then you when you see the other one,
[1:01:44] you're just like, I
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; something's a little different on this.
[1:01:47] Something's a little different there
[1:01:49] because God is doing something to you.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, saints,
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; I can't tell
[1:01:58] who you are in the Lord, where you are,
[1:02:01] how far you've come, if you'll come. I
[1:02:04] can't tell that.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And neither can you tell that of me.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm using this example because
[1:02:12] I understand with the Holy Spirit, you
[1:02:14] can discern those things, but you never
[1:02:16] want to Me and me and brother were
[1:02:18] talking about this the other day.
[1:02:21] When you meet somebody, if the Lord's
[1:02:23] opened your eyes to the word and you
[1:02:25] meet somebody, you you you can see
[1:02:27] there's something in them that's
[1:02:28] different
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; and it rings true. And you can use that
[1:02:32] in conversation, right? You you know,
[1:02:33] okay, where where you can go and how you
[1:02:35] can fellowship in that kind of way, but
[1:02:37] you don't use that to to say this is
[1:02:38] where you're going and this is where
[1:02:40] you're not going.
[1:02:42] So
[1:02:43] he begins to minister to him and and
[1:02:45] because Aquilla was was already hearing
[1:02:48] things and catching things and and
[1:02:50] understanding more when when Aquilla
[1:02:53] came to him again to talk to him about
[1:02:54] sandpaper.
[1:02:56] Something began to stir inside of him.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; You see, there was already there was
[1:03:00] already something there. You know, I'm
[1:03:02] sorry. I just tried to explain myself a
[1:03:03] second ago and I don't remember where I
[1:03:05] was. I'm trying to get better at that.
[1:03:07] You see, we're still preachers. We're
[1:03:10] still guys, right?
[1:03:13] The devil loves to get he slips that in.
[1:03:16] You know, whatever your weakness is as a
[1:03:17] minister, you'll be preaching along,
[1:03:19] he'll slip that in there and then you
[1:03:20] just he'll try to derail your thought.
[1:03:22] But the God God is always perfect and he
[1:03:24] comes along and he says, "Here's where
[1:03:26] you are." Or he says, "Don't worry about
[1:03:27] it. Go back to your notes."
[1:03:31] So they expanded unto him the way of God
[1:03:34] more perfectly. Brother Frank can just
[1:03:37] like edit that part out. I'm kidding.
[1:03:38] I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.
[1:03:42] And when he was disposed to pass into
[1:03:44] AIA, the brethren wrote, exhorting the
[1:03:46] disciples to receive him, who when he
[1:03:48] was come, helped them much which had
[1:03:50] believed through grace. For he mightily
[1:03:53] convinced the Jews, and that publicly,
[1:03:55] showing by the scriptures that Jesus was
[1:03:58] Christ. So you see now Apollos catches
[1:04:02] what's going on and he receives that and
[1:04:04] he's and he his eyes are open and now he
[1:04:07] begins to minister to the people and he
[1:04:10] and God takes this gift where he was
[1:04:12] already boldly speaking and he begins to
[1:04:14] minister through the word that was given
[1:04:17] for their age.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. And you can go and you can see
[1:04:20] that Apollos was very instrumental in at
[1:04:23] least the Corinthian church and I'm
[1:04:25] imagining other places of as well.
[1:04:27] There's a few scriptures here. He says,
[1:04:29] "Who then is Paul and who is Apollos?
[1:04:31] But ministers by whom you believed? I
[1:04:33] have planted Apollos water, but God gave
[1:04:35] the increase." So God began to use this
[1:04:37] man named Apollos
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; as he understood the word that was
[1:04:41] revealed to him to them in that day,
[1:04:44] right? He received that. But you see
[1:04:46] what happened was now there was these
[1:04:48] these brothers here in in in Corenth. So
[1:04:50] this is before Paul
[1:04:53] I'm sorry. No, while Paul is at Corenth,
[1:04:56] Paul having passed through the upper
[1:04:57] coast came to Ephesus and finding
[1:05:00] certain disciples. Now, interestingly
[1:05:02] enough, that this happens at Ephesus,
[1:05:05] which is the type of the first church
[1:05:06] age. And we are supposed to be the
[1:05:10] that's the alpha and we are the omega
[1:05:12] bride. So, there's a lot of types and
[1:05:14] there's a lot of shadows and there's a
[1:05:15] lot of things that come that came in
[1:05:17] that age that now this is the complete
[1:05:19] manifestation of that in our age. We're
[1:05:21] back, right? We're back. But it's
[1:05:24] different because that seed has
[1:05:26] reproduced itself.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So now we are the completion of what was
[1:05:30] started in Ephesus.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; You have to remember that that they lost
[1:05:34] that
[1:05:35] uh the the spiritual Eve was married and
[1:05:39] fell to denominations, fell to
[1:05:41] organization, fell at Na,
[1:05:43] right? But the second Eve won't be
[1:05:46] deceived.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; That's the bride of Jesus Christ in the
[1:05:49] last age. So it was restored, right? So
[1:05:52] the understanding
[1:05:54] of what was given at Ephesus under the
[1:05:57] ministry of Paul was restored
[1:06:01] and it was restored because sovereign
[1:06:04] grace.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Sovereign grace came down.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; You see divine but says when divine love
[1:06:11] was projected sovereign grace took its
[1:06:14] place. So divine love projected to Mary
[1:06:17] sovereign grace stepped and created a
[1:06:19] man in her womb.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Divine love was projected to our
[1:06:24] age and sovereign grace came down and
[1:06:26] Christ stepped into the bride.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; You received his seed. This is the first
[1:06:31] time in history.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; The first time in history that the bride
[1:06:37] of Jesus Christ, the the his wife is
[1:06:41] receiving a marriage.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; He he was he was talking about it. He
[1:06:47] was alluding to it. He was pointing to
[1:06:49] it. But it's in this age that it
[1:06:52] happens.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; So we look back now Ephesus. Okay. So
[1:06:56] Ephesus received the ministry of John
[1:06:59] the Baptist because he says unto them
[1:07:01] through Apollos. He says unto them, have
[1:07:03] you received
[1:07:06] the Holy Ghost since you believed? And
[1:07:07] they said unto him, we have not so much
[1:07:09] as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:07:12] Ghost. So now Apollos had ministered to
[1:07:15] them. He had only received uh John's
[1:07:18] baptism. And I I should say I'm assuming
[1:07:20] it was Apollos. They'd only received
[1:07:22] John's baptism. And he said unto them,
[1:07:24] "Unto what then were you baptized?" And
[1:07:26] they said, "Unto John's baptism." Then
[1:07:29] said Paul, "John verily baptized with
[1:07:31] the baptism of repentance, saying unto
[1:07:34] the people that they should believe on
[1:07:35] him which should come after him, that is
[1:07:38] on Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus." So now
[1:07:42] they received this first and second pole
[1:07:44] ministry from John the Baptist. However,
[1:07:48] that happened. They're at Ephesus.
[1:07:50] They're the first church. There's 12
[1:07:51] about 12 there, it says.
[1:07:55] But you see, they only came so far. But
[1:07:58] then Paul comes to them, the message of
[1:08:01] the age, and begins to tell them there's
[1:08:03] something that came. The point of the
[1:08:04] baptistry
[1:08:07] was that th that the people that you
[1:08:10] should believe on him that was coming
[1:08:12] after him.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words,
[1:08:17] you should be seeking the manifestation
[1:08:19] of the promise.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; John as an anointed prophet was
[1:08:24] ministering the promise to them, but he
[1:08:27] was not the manifestation of the
[1:08:30] promise.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He was the manifestation of a different
[1:08:33] promise.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; So, I shall be one like crying in the
[1:08:37] wilderness, right? He quoted Isaiah to
[1:08:39] them. He was the manifestation of that
[1:08:41] promise but he was the man ministering
[1:08:44] unto the manifestation of the promise
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. So brother Brandham was
[1:08:51] the the the fulfillment and was the the
[1:08:54] manifestation of the promise of Malachi
[1:08:56] 45 and 6.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; But the point of that was to minister
[1:09:02] about the promise and point us so we
[1:09:05] could say here's the signs, here's the
[1:09:08] scriptures. Now, because of that, and
[1:09:10] because you believe that already, when
[1:09:13] you hear the message, you look and say,
[1:09:15] "Where is Jesus? Where is the Messiah?
[1:09:19] He said he'd come today. Where is he?"
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; But if there's something missing, the
[1:09:26] way of God has not been yet more
[1:09:27] perfectly expounded unto you, you will
[1:09:30] stop with John's ministry. You will stop
[1:09:33] with the ministry of Brother Brandon.
[1:09:35] That's all you will receive.
[1:09:37] and you won't seek the manifestation of
[1:09:40] the promise.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Because now in our age, what is supposed
[1:09:44] to happen?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; You and I, I say this way, the bride of
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ should be manifesting the
[1:09:52] promise.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Where's the signs, brother Chris?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Show me evidence.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; I don't see anything.
[1:10:06] I'm sorry, but that's it.
[1:10:08] But now a son of God says,
[1:10:12] "I never been here before. I'm new to
[1:10:14] this church. Can Can you show me what it
[1:10:16] means?"
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And they go, "I knew it."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; You see, saints, it comes down to the
[1:10:25] end of it. It all depends on the
[1:10:27] sovereign grace of Jesus Christ. It all
[1:10:29] depends on Christ himself revealing
[1:10:32] himself to you. And if you are new, but
[1:10:35] Christ is inside of you, you're not yet
[1:10:37] aware of that. When you meet Christ in
[1:10:38] your brother,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; something testifies back and forth.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; There's a twinkle in the eye. There's a
[1:10:45] a recognition, a glimmer of recognition.
[1:10:47] And now,
[1:10:50] now you see it. And now you're saying,
[1:10:53] God, I want to be the manifestation of
[1:10:55] the promise.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; That is what God is looking for. He
[1:10:59] says, I must decrease. Brother says, I
[1:11:01] must decrease. He must increase. Elijah
[1:11:04] throws the mantle. Elisha must complete
[1:11:07] the ministry.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking to what?
[1:11:12] The manifestation of what the word says
[1:11:14] about the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; that he said.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's why we read it every day
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; cuz we read it and we listen. We read it
[1:11:28] and we listen. And as we do that, our
[1:11:31] revelation increases. And our revelation
[1:11:33] produces what? Manifestation of the
[1:11:36] word.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't know why your wife
[1:11:40] looks at you and say, you know, you've
[1:11:41] been treating me really nice lately."
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Your kids, they're thinking, you know,
[1:11:45] dad's not the same person he used to be.
[1:11:47] And it just gets better and better and
[1:11:49] better and better. Say, "That's not very
[1:11:52] spiritual, Brother Chris." Oh, yes it
[1:11:55] is.
[1:11:56] Oh, yes it is. Because there's only two
[1:11:58] spirits in the world,
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Christ and the Antichrist. And when you
[1:12:02] start living the word,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; that's powerful.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That is powerful.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; In the face of complete and total
[1:12:09] darkness,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; that is powerful. And that will change
[1:12:11] the life of the people around you.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And when they heard this, they were
[1:12:14] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:12:17] When Paul had laid his hands upon them,
[1:12:19] the Holy Ghost came on them. They spake
[1:12:21] with tongues and prophesied. And all the
[1:12:22] men were about 12.
[1:12:25] He says
[1:12:29] in harvest time he says we've been
[1:12:32] baptized the same man that baptized
[1:12:34] Jesus John. We've been baptized to
[1:12:36] John's baptism. So they knew of Jesus.
[1:12:39] John only baptized unto repentance not
[1:12:42] for the remission of sins because the
[1:12:43] lamb hadn't been killed yet.
[1:12:47] He said John baptized unto repentance
[1:12:49] seeing that you should believe on him
[1:12:50] that was to come on Jesus Christ. And
[1:12:54] when they heard this, they were
[1:12:55] baptized.
[1:12:57] And Paul laid his hands upon them. The
[1:12:58] Holy Ghost came upon them. He says, "30
[1:13:01] years later."
[1:13:03] And he says this about the church at
[1:13:05] Ephesus. He says, "These good people at
[1:13:06] Ephesus had heard about the coming
[1:13:09] Messiah."
[1:13:11] Saints, I realize you're faithfully
[1:13:13] taught here. And and and I had two
[1:13:15] sermons
[1:13:17] and I would just came said, "Lord,
[1:13:19] you're going to show me what you want me
[1:13:20] to speak." Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And he showed me Friday night in
[1:13:23] conversation. He showed me this was the
[1:13:25] sermon he wanted me to minister.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So if all of this is a refresher to you,
[1:13:29] say, "Lord, show me what I've missed
[1:13:30] before."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; So I say that again. Look, see the the
[1:13:37] guy got in the way again.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Here's the thing, saints of God.
[1:13:46] Something happened.
[1:13:48] Something happened. Brother Brandham
[1:13:50] came in his ministry and he preaches for
[1:13:51] the first several years, many years he
[1:13:54] preaches and and all of that, you know,
[1:13:56] we go back through the of revelation
[1:13:58] that Christ came, we go back and we and
[1:14:01] we can pull through that. But if that's
[1:14:03] all you get,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; if you just get up to the baptism of
[1:14:09] Jesus Christ, if you just get up to the
[1:14:11] seals and the preaching of the word and
[1:14:13] all and you can listen to those
[1:14:14] messages, I'm not saying you don't
[1:14:15] listen to them, but I'm saying your
[1:14:16] revelation only comes up to that. God
[1:14:18] has to first come and tell you that that
[1:14:21] thing after there, the word after there
[1:14:24] was the message, was the point.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; It's like John preaches a lot of good
[1:14:29] things and he, you know, he's up there
[1:14:30] and he's rebuking the church and
[1:14:31] everyone says, "Yes, tell them vipers
[1:14:33] all about it.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Get him, John." Right? and he he's
[1:14:37] blasting it up and there's a man
[1:14:38] preaching like they've never heard
[1:14:40] preached before and he's baptizing and
[1:14:42] people are getting their lives right and
[1:14:43] there's power and there's fire and then
[1:14:45] and then and then he baptizes this man
[1:14:47] named Jesus and then it's like
[1:14:50] it's not the same anymore. We got to go
[1:14:52] back, John. John, we got to go back, you
[1:14:55] know, get that stick out and start
[1:14:56] smacking the desert floor again and and
[1:14:59] let's get some Pharisees and we can chew
[1:15:00] them out and
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; and then John's in prison and everyone's
[1:15:03] thinking, "Now, what do we do?"
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; The same thing happened with brother
[1:15:11] Brandham. If he's if he's the second
[1:15:13] forerunner,
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; then he's going to be patterned after
[1:15:16] the first forerunner.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And same thing happened. He comes and
[1:15:21] and there's all this, yeah, you know,
[1:15:22] tear them churches down. Yes, we're holy
[1:15:24] rollers. And and and and then and it's
[1:15:26] like, well, the point was you to holy
[1:15:28] roll into Christ
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; and and to stand up the word in flesh.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Don't just keep rolling. Roll unto
[1:15:38] something. There is a purpose for
[1:15:40] something. I don't mean that as a
[1:15:42] slander to anybody. There's a purpose to
[1:15:44] something. God doesn't just come and say
[1:15:46] just shout and and run around and and be
[1:15:49] excited and be excited about the and
[1:15:50] brother Bam encourages that and then
[1:15:52] something changes.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And everyone says we can't have you
[1:15:56] minister for us anymore.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:01] What what what matures a believer?
[1:16:05] Me and brother Ilia was talking about
[1:16:06] this. Excuse me. What's one of the
[1:16:10] greatest not the but one of the greatest
[1:16:13] trials that we face that brings us
[1:16:16] closer and that that causes a maturing
[1:16:19] in our character
[1:16:20] is when someone who should believe
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; what you believe persecutes you for what
[1:16:26] you believe.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] Right?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to have to we're dealing
[1:16:31] with that. But you see, we're looking at
[1:16:34] this pattern here of John the Baptist
[1:16:35] had a ministry and the churches the
[1:16:37] church at Ephesus only heard that. Do
[1:16:40] you think by any great chance the same
[1:16:43] pattern is going to happen today?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; If it happened with the first church
[1:16:48] age, it will happen in the last.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; People looking and saying, "Well, yes,
[1:16:53] John." And there was a season where we
[1:16:55] said, "Yes, baptism unto repentance.
[1:16:59] John the Baptist.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; But then
[1:17:03] the word came.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And he says right here, they heard about
[1:17:08] the coming Messiah. We all heard the
[1:17:10] Messiah was coming. We all knew he's
[1:17:12] coming
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; now. Ready? Oh, this is good. This is
[1:17:16] good.
[1:17:18] John had preached him. They were
[1:17:20] baptized unto repentance of sins,
[1:17:21] looking forward to believing on Jesus.
[1:17:25] How many can say when they heard the
[1:17:26] message that's exactly what you were all
[1:17:29] of you have the ability to raise your
[1:17:31] hands? I know you do
[1:17:34] exercise authority over your body.
[1:17:37] He says but now it was time to look back
[1:17:40] to Jesus and be baptized unto remission
[1:17:42] of sins. It was time to receive the Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost. And when they were baptized in
[1:17:46] the name of the Lord Jesus, okay, next
[1:17:48] quote, next part of the quote, he says,
[1:17:50] "All those dear folks at Ephesus were
[1:17:52] fine people. And anyone of any and if
[1:17:55] anyone had a right to feel secure, they
[1:17:57] did." Notice how far they had come. They
[1:18:00] had come all the way up to accepting the
[1:18:03] coming Messiah. They knew he was coming.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Their own prophet baptized him.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; They had come all the way up. But don't
[1:18:14] you see that in spite of that they had
[1:18:17] missed him. He had come and gone.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; They needed to be filled with the Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost?
[1:18:33] I'm not going to try to preach Brother
[1:18:36] Alistister's sermon.
[1:18:40] But if if Christ is the word
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost is Christ in the
[1:18:45] word,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; you must receive the word.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; How are you sealed? How is a womb
[1:18:51] sealed?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Receiving seed.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Word. The word of God is a seed.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Sealed unto the day of your redemption.
[1:19:04] They at Ephesus received the Messiah,
[1:19:07] received Christ after he had already
[1:19:10] come and gone.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ron puts it that way, but I
[1:19:13] like to say this. When Christ came and
[1:19:15] he was revealed through the ministry of
[1:19:17] the prophet 63 to 65, he's still here.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? The
[1:19:25] Christ came back into the church. He's
[1:19:28] still here.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; So, oh, he came. He came. He came. Show
[1:19:32] me.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; How do you show how we People are
[1:19:38] seeking for the manifestation of the
[1:19:40] promise.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; There's been a promise given. People are
[1:19:43] looking for it. How are you going to
[1:19:45] show them? How are you going to show
[1:19:47] them that you have the truth? You can
[1:19:49] talk about it. You can say you have the
[1:19:51] truth. You can say you've got the word.
[1:19:52] You can use the catchphrases.
[1:19:55] But how? Cuz they're looking.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; They're looking. There's people in the
[1:20:00] pew with you looking. So what does the
[1:20:04] bride have to do? They must manifest
[1:20:07] what the word said about them.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; They must be Christ in flesh.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Look at the fruits. Show
[1:20:17] me the fruits."
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Well, that takes a long time. You know,
[1:20:23] you got to plant a tree and it has to
[1:20:24] grow up and then it has to get
[1:20:26] pollinated and then fruit has to grow.
[1:20:28] I want apples in June.
[1:20:32] Sorry, doesn't happen that way.
[1:20:37] So, you have to have faith that's
[1:20:39] actually an apple tree you planted.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; And then you have to have faith that
[1:20:43] apple tree is going to get the life
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; to produce the apples.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz we've all done that, right? M
[1:20:50] spring, Home Depot's got the sale. Get
[1:20:53] the tree, you plant it, it grows up, and
[1:20:55] they say, "Oh, you got the male tree.
[1:21:00] You need the female tree."
[1:21:03] Oh, you say it's an apple tree. It
[1:21:04] should give me apples. No, no, no.
[1:21:07] Right. So,
[1:21:09] it takes the two.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Christ himself must come and manifest
[1:21:18] himself
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; If you think that sounds confusing, you
[1:21:23] need to go read where Paul says, "Well,
[1:21:25] I will to do good, evil is present with
[1:21:27] me. And though I want to do good, I do
[1:21:29] evil."
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And he was the first church age
[1:21:35] messenger.
[1:21:38] Sounds like riddles.
[1:21:40] until God gives you a revelation.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And that's all it is. It's that simple.
[1:21:45] You see, that's the thing. It's like,
[1:21:47] well, how do we know Jesus was Jesus?
[1:21:50] Cuz he said he was.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He only did that a couple times. But he
[1:21:56] only did that when first the word called
[1:21:59] him out.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You see, she called him out
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; at the well. She said, "Hey, when the
[1:22:05] Messiah comes, he's going to say those
[1:22:07] same things."
[1:22:08] You see, the word identified him first
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; and then he confirmed it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You see, God gives you the word, God
[1:22:16] gives you revelation of the word, then
[1:22:17] he proves that word to you.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I tell people, I said, you
[1:22:21] hear something preached by any minister
[1:22:24] that confuses you or concerns you, go to
[1:22:28] the word. This is why it's so important
[1:22:29] to have your own personal walk with
[1:22:31] Christ and feeding on the word daily
[1:22:33] because then if it's the truth, God
[1:22:35] identifies it to you. God proves it to
[1:22:37] you. If it's not the truth,
[1:22:40] he proves it to you.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; That it's not the truth.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; See, he confirms it. We're not just here
[1:22:50] guessing. Just have faith in a breeze,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:23:03] So he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:23:07] light that his deeds may be made
[1:23:09] manifest that they are wrought in God.
[1:23:13] So again just to recap the vindication
[1:23:15] that Jesus was who he said he was came
[1:23:19] because he fulfilled what the word said
[1:23:21] about him.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[1:23:26] And this is a long or I'm sorry, this
[1:23:28] isn't the long quote. He says, "We all
[1:23:30] here this afternoon who are Christians
[1:23:32] believe that Jesus Christ was God's word
[1:23:34] manifested. We believe he was virgin
[1:23:37] born. He was the tabernacle in which
[1:23:39] Almighty God tabernacled in here on
[1:23:41] earth. Not just a prophet, not just some
[1:23:44] ordinary man, but God himself manifested
[1:23:47] in the form of a man, God with us. Rise
[1:23:51] and shine for the light has come to
[1:23:53] you." Isaiah was the light. I got the
[1:23:56] highlighted portions because we just
[1:23:58] read every word. We'd be here too long.
[1:23:59] Noah was the light of his day. Isaiah
[1:24:01] was the light of his day. Why? He had
[1:24:03] the word manifested.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; The gospel, the Bible words for this day
[1:24:09] is the light of today. Jesus come on two
[1:24:12] lights. So for reference that he's
[1:24:14] talking about John the Baptist and Jesus
[1:24:16] can't shine at the same time. Can't be a
[1:24:19] church light and God's light shine at
[1:24:22] the same time.
[1:24:25] God's light putting out the church
[1:24:27] light. God is separating churchism from
[1:24:31] his light of the promised word of this
[1:24:33] hour that we're living in.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham isn't saying stop going
[1:24:37] to church.
[1:24:39] He's saying if I I if if the light that
[1:24:42] you're following, how do I say this?
[1:24:44] He's saying that that the churchism the
[1:24:46] the the form of coming to church and and
[1:24:48] having everything that involves in in
[1:24:51] church is not the point. You know,
[1:24:53] there's an example that that that I'll
[1:24:55] use here that I think explains it well
[1:24:57] for myself at least. But says, you know,
[1:25:01] he says many things about the end of
[1:25:02] time and and what we're going to face
[1:25:04] and and you know, we have all of our
[1:25:05] guesses and our opinions on that, but
[1:25:07] when it happens, we'll know this is God
[1:25:09] and it always happens different than we
[1:25:11] think it does anyways. But he says, you
[1:25:13] know, at some point the church doors
[1:25:14] will close. I I if if your entire walk
[1:25:18] as a believer revolves around this what
[1:25:21] happens here on Sunday morning and on
[1:25:23] Wednesday night and in between and the
[1:25:25] special things if that's what keeps you
[1:25:28] going
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; right
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; then when church is not there
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; you will fall apart
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; but if your purpose is the light of the
[1:25:39] age which is the revealed word
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; is the open book
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; then this is the bonus
[1:25:47] this. You come here and it bolsters you
[1:25:49] and it strengthens you. And then you go
[1:25:51] to your studies, you go, "The preacher
[1:25:52] talked about that and you're feeding and
[1:25:54] you're feeding and then you come
[1:25:55] Wednesday and the preacher's talking
[1:25:56] about what you were feeding on." And
[1:25:58] then, right, because imagine this.
[1:26:01] Imagine this. Let's say, let's say you
[1:26:03] got to have church. You got to have the
[1:26:05] brothers get up here and sing and the
[1:26:07] musicians play and sing songs and to to
[1:26:11] pull you from your despair and your
[1:26:13] stuper and your fog and and the ideas of
[1:26:17] of your job. And then the preacher comes
[1:26:18] and and gives you all of the, you know,
[1:26:21] the word and you receive it. And then
[1:26:23] there's a nice atmosphere. And then
[1:26:24] there's singing of songs. And then
[1:26:26] there's closing out. And the brothers
[1:26:28] will shake your hand as you go out and
[1:26:30] you can talk with some believers in
[1:26:31] fellowship. And then you go back. And
[1:26:34] then now you go back to your other life.
[1:26:38] And then now you know we're looking in
[1:26:42] the future. Can't come here anymore. You
[1:26:44] can't. Nobody can have church. But the
[1:26:46] Bible says they try to stop ministers
[1:26:48] from preaching.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And say they do stop ministers from
[1:26:51] preaching. Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And now instead of churchism,
[1:26:56] now it's like, hey, what's a secret
[1:26:59] knock?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Slip inside. I don't know. I'm just, you
[1:27:04] know, painting a picture here. And now
[1:27:06] you sit down and, you know, maybe the
[1:27:08] guitar's too loud, so you can just, you
[1:27:10] know, hum, you know,
[1:27:14] as a few come in. And then the brother
[1:27:16] opens the Bible and everyone goes,
[1:27:19] "What's he going to say?
[1:27:22] Everything is about the word of God.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Or you can't even do that. You just
[1:27:26] gather your family in the corner,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; little candle on, I don't know, again,
[1:27:30] painting a picture and you begin and
[1:27:32] everyone's hanging on every word because
[1:27:35] all that you're focused on is the
[1:27:37] ministry of the light of the age. And
[1:27:40] there will be churches having church
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; and saying, "Why don't you just come and
[1:27:46] join us?"
[1:27:48] You saw this pattern behind the iron
[1:27:50] curtain, right?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; People, you know, people gave up because
[1:27:53] they had to have church.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; We have church. Let's go to church.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I wish we didn't have to, you know,
[1:28:00] throw the caveats in there. But our
[1:28:02] flesh gets in the way and people start
[1:28:03] looking, a brother Chris is saying we
[1:28:04] ought to stay home. What's he going to
[1:28:06] say next?
[1:28:09] I won't say it, but you know what I'm
[1:28:11] thinking. There's a nice catchphrase.
[1:28:14] Okay. So that's churchism, right? This
[1:28:18] idea you have to have Oh, see there we
[1:28:21] go again. This idea that that that you
[1:28:23] live, you serve God through church. But
[1:28:26] church is what happens when people who
[1:28:28] serve God come together.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; There. Thank you, Jesus. That perfectly
[1:28:33] puts it there. Church is what happened
[1:28:35] when people who serve God come together.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; How? Doesn't matter. They're together.
[1:28:40] What happens? The word begins to be
[1:28:42] ministered. song begins to come forth.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, how in the world did Paul and
[1:28:48] Silas in the jail? Their feet were in
[1:28:50] stocks, their hands were in stocks, and
[1:28:51] their heads were in stocks.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Blake, you ever tried to sing
[1:28:58] hunched over?
[1:29:00] There's no reason the song leader stands
[1:29:03] to sing.
[1:29:05] Constricts your diaphragm.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas are there, you know. I
[1:29:12] don't know what they sang.
[1:29:15] Whatever songs they had then,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; you know, maybe Paul even wrote one, you
[1:29:19] know, or was it Silas? I don't know who
[1:29:20] began to sing first. It says Paul and
[1:29:23] Silas begin to sing, right?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Am I remembering that correctly?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; So, so, so then it was the song,
[1:29:31] brother. The song set them free.
[1:29:37] know
[1:29:38] the word in them
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; produced the song in the face of
[1:29:45] complete adversity.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz anybody can sing, but not anybody
[1:29:51] can sing sitting in jail.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Anybody can sing in church. Anybody can
[1:29:56] stand up here and and and sing
[1:29:59] and and you know, maybe you think, well,
[1:30:01] that's not your gift, brother, right?
[1:30:03] But they can get up there and make a
[1:30:05] joyful noise unto the Lord.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Anybody can do that. But only the word
[1:30:09] can testify forth in that condition.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Only a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:16] himself can testify forth in that
[1:30:19] condition.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; You say, when we got our arm arm in arm
[1:30:22] and we're we're we're here and we've got
[1:30:24] and and we're just so encouraged and
[1:30:26] we're so challenged, that should
[1:30:28] encourage us for our walk. And you say,
[1:30:30] "Yes, praise God." And you're an
[1:30:32] encouragement to your brother and your
[1:30:33] brother's an encouragement to you
[1:30:34] because outside of these walls, you have
[1:30:37] a personal relationship with Jesus
[1:30:38] Christ, which is look, hey, guess what?
[1:30:42] A personal relationship with Jesus
[1:30:43] Christ does not exist today outside of
[1:30:46] the revealed word of the hour.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; It does not exist outside of the open
[1:30:50] book.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; It's that's just what it comes down to.
[1:30:55] That's the light of the day.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. which brother Brandham said is the
[1:30:59] best day ever because it's all of the
[1:31:02] light.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So what what what's going to
[1:31:07] you come together and you're arm in arm
[1:31:08] and you're there. Now what happens when
[1:31:12] you're alone?
[1:31:13] You know we I had this project one time
[1:31:17] was a commercial project and there we
[1:31:19] were working on the main level but there
[1:31:22] was a basement. I'm a grown man saints.
[1:31:25] I'm a man. I've walked in the woods with
[1:31:27] bears and you know I've seen bears and
[1:31:30] I'm a man and I hated going down in that
[1:31:33] basement.
[1:31:35] You know, it just was like, man, what
[1:31:37] and it just went forever. I mean, there
[1:31:39] was rooms that went way back there and
[1:31:42] they were dark.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; See, Paul and Silas were in the inner
[1:31:46] prison,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; There was no light at all.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; No, it was pitch pitch black. You think
[1:31:53] you got a prisoner you're going to
[1:31:54] execute the next morning? Let's say that
[1:31:56] was the plan. You're going to give them
[1:31:57] a torch.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Here, have a little light.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; No, he's a dead man walking.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; You don't care.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Pitch black. There wasn't no, you know,
[1:32:09] musicians and and song leaders to to
[1:32:11] encourage them out of that position.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; The only thing
[1:32:17] the only thing that can give you light
[1:32:19] in that kind of darkness
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; is the man who can turn on the light.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Brother preaches that sermon, the man
[1:32:26] who can turn on a light.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And he starts preaching about the open
[1:32:29] of the word. We're like, "Oh, this
[1:32:33] why?" Because he turns the light on in
[1:32:34] the darkness of this age.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And guess what? Spiritually speaking, we
[1:32:38] are in the same position Paul and Silas
[1:32:39] were.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "Uter darkness."
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "I couldn't see any further."
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, I think it was after
[1:32:48] 77, he couldn't see any further. See, he
[1:32:50] predicts that 77 will see the close of
[1:32:53] time cuz he couldn't see any further.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Yet here we are.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Lights. But what's the only thing that
[1:33:04] can stand in that kind of darkness is
[1:33:05] the same thing that gave Paul and Silas
[1:33:07] the victory over their circumstances.
[1:33:09] They were the manifestation of the
[1:33:12] promise.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; The word is light when it's vindicated.
[1:33:21] Until the word it promised for the day
[1:33:24] is a vindicated, then it is not light.
[1:33:27] It cannot be. If God said, "Let there be
[1:33:29] light and no sun come in sun come into
[1:33:32] in existence." There is no sign of
[1:33:35] light.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; So he speaks the word. Okay. Okay. But
[1:33:43] when God said, "Let there be light."
[1:33:45] Remember how brother talks about the
[1:33:46] third pole being the spoken word?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And we thought,
[1:33:50] look, I'm young, but I paid attention
[1:33:52] growing up to what preachers said about
[1:33:55] the third pole. We thought it was like,
[1:33:57] yes, we're going to be speaking
[1:33:58] squirrels. What are you moose hunting
[1:34:01] 59in bull,
[1:34:04] right? Or I'm fishing and or I'm like
[1:34:07] the ladies in the, you know, I'm sorry,
[1:34:09] I'm not a lady. I don't have an example
[1:34:11] for you. the sewing machine. I don't
[1:34:13] know.
[1:34:15] Perfect Holland sauce doesn't break cuz
[1:34:18] Holl sauce breaks if you don't do it
[1:34:20] correctly. Mayonnaise breaks too, you
[1:34:22] know. Perfect mayonnaise. Speaking word,
[1:34:23] right? I don't make any fun of that. I'm
[1:34:25] not making fun of that. But you see,
[1:34:26] what was it? It was that the word, the
[1:34:28] spoken word was manifesting itself. He
[1:34:32] says, "Oh, it'll be that spoken word."
[1:34:33] And it was the complete manifestation of
[1:34:36] the word of God that was given. The
[1:34:38] spoken word that was given. The angel
[1:34:40] came to him and said, "Well, what do you
[1:34:41] want?" He says, "Well, I don't know."
[1:34:44] He's like, "Well, aren't you hunting
[1:34:45] squirrels?"
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Right? There was the word first. Okay?
[1:34:51] So, when God said, "Let there be light
[1:34:52] and there was light." That was the manif
[1:34:55] the manifestation of the promise.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; When God promised the Messiah, Messiah
[1:35:00] come, then his word was fulfilled and he
[1:35:04] was the light of the hour. Yes.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Do you see? That's why if the light
[1:35:08] hasn't come, okay, you ready for this?
[1:35:11] If the light hasn't come and you're
[1:35:14] looking for it, you're right in tune
[1:35:16] with God.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; But if the light has come and you're
[1:35:21] still looking for it,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; you're out of sync with God.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You must, like he said about the Ephesus
[1:35:27] church in the the church age book that
[1:35:29] we just read, you must go back
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; to God. This is the same example by the
[1:35:34] Bram says God turned a corner
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; and they kept building a wall.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Now you spiritually are going to
[1:35:41] experience the same thing because some
[1:35:42] of us are younger
[1:35:44] than others.
[1:35:47] And
[1:35:49] you it's not just it's not just the
[1:35:51] bride worldwide.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't deal with the bride
[1:35:57] worldwide.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; He deals with you.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; It's an individual affair. Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; So, he comes to you and begins to
[1:36:04] minister to you under the first pole.
[1:36:07] Then he begins to discern your heart.
[1:36:09] And the minister gets up and he speaks
[1:36:11] to you what you're already thinking
[1:36:13] about. He minister to you what you've
[1:36:15] been praying about.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And the word begins to discern your
[1:36:18] heart and you fall upon a scripture. You
[1:36:20] come to a sermon and brother Brandham
[1:36:22] begins to minister and it's exactly what
[1:36:23] you're looking for already. Already
[1:36:26] what's in your heart. The scripture that
[1:36:28] you opened and it's already there. what
[1:36:30] you were looking for.
[1:36:32] And what is he do? What is he doing?
[1:36:34] He's trying to say, "I am he that
[1:36:37] speaketh to thee."
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; I am he that's ministering to you,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:36:58] Amen.
[1:37:01] That's right.
[1:37:04] What he's telling you is exactly what
[1:37:07] you're looking for.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; What you need is exactly what he's
[1:37:11] speaking to you. All you have to do is
[1:37:13] receive it.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; That's all it comes down to. You have to
[1:37:17] receive what God has spoken to you.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; He's laid it out for you. He took the
[1:37:22] pages and he laid them out one by one.
[1:37:27] He says, "You were born there and then
[1:37:29] this happened and then this happened."
[1:37:32] And he's leading you to what? The
[1:37:35] completion of the whole thing. He's
[1:37:38] telling you, "I have crafted you for
[1:37:41] this day. I have crafted you for the
[1:37:43] position that you're sitting in." Your
[1:37:45] name your name Preston, right?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I'm Chris. Nice to meet you, brother.
[1:37:49] He's crafted you for this day. He's
[1:37:51] crafted you for right here and right
[1:37:53] now. But the brothers told me who you
[1:37:54] were. I didn't guess that.
[1:37:58] They mentioned you and I said, "I know
[1:37:59] who you're talking about. I saw him the
[1:38:01] other day."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Something manifested that you
[1:38:05] have a need of
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; and God lays it all out for you in a
[1:38:09] blueprint and says, "This is it."
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:19] And a minister can come from somewhere
[1:38:20] else who doesn't know everything that
[1:38:22] you're going through
[1:38:25] and we'll hear a little something and
[1:38:26] that's it. And God will use that and
[1:38:28] vindicate and say you need to speak that
[1:38:30] for him.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; You need to speak that for it one person
[1:38:34] doesn't matter. Could be you. Could be
[1:38:36] you. God crafted this thing just for
[1:38:39] that person. And God comes and he
[1:38:40] discerns your heart through the
[1:38:42] ministry.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Is God still alive today? Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Then God is still using man today.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Are we still here?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Do we still have needs?
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Does God still care?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Is his word the truth?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; If it is and you believe everything that
[1:38:59] he's written down,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; then God can speak through the minister
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; and he can discern your heart and tell
[1:39:07] you exactly what you have need of and
[1:39:10] tell you exactly what you you're looking
[1:39:13] for. Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:39:17] he's still real.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But you see, the problem is that we
[1:39:21] fail.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We get in the way.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; But God is perfect in his ways.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the last days that two
[1:39:31] spirits would be so close it would
[1:39:32] deceive the very light if possible. It
[1:39:34] isn't communism, it's churchism. So we
[1:39:37] talked about that.
[1:39:40] Now, in this message, shalom
[1:39:44] here as I I'm coming down to a close.
[1:39:57] He says, "There is a young fellow around
[1:39:59] here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[1:40:01] Now, before Brother Man begins to speak
[1:40:04] this in in this message, he stops and he
[1:40:06] says, "Lord, forgive me for what I'm
[1:40:07] about to say." because he wants to make
[1:40:10] a point. So now he's he's in the the
[1:40:13] person of the Pharisees talking to the
[1:40:16] group the the the other Pharisees and
[1:40:18] Sadducees or whatever, however they did
[1:40:19] it.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And he's and he's saying, "There is a
[1:40:22] young fellow here around here by the
[1:40:24] name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[1:40:27] Again, patterns repeat themselves. So
[1:40:29] this same spirit is here today
[1:40:31] whispering in your ear,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; saying this same thing. There's a young
[1:40:35] fellow around here by the name of Jesus
[1:40:37] of Nazareth,
[1:40:40] dare I say it, Chris take
[1:40:43] talking to you about the opening of the
[1:40:45] book, talking to you about this stuff.
[1:40:48] Brother Chad Lamb,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; brother, you know, whoever.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Gabe Smith,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; right? It doesn't matter. Your dad,
[1:40:56] right? What does your dad know? You
[1:40:58] know, who's this young? Who's this young
[1:40:59] fellow? Who's this old guy? You know,
[1:41:02] who's he? M
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; okay. Now he begins to talk about well
[1:41:06] this is why he is challenging he is
[1:41:09] challenging they are challenging the
[1:41:11] word that's being revealed to the people
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; have nothing to do with him. What does
[1:41:16] our Bible teach us? Oh goodness
[1:41:19] gracious. You see he uses the word
[1:41:21] against the word.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care. He's not looking for
[1:41:26] some. You know I look at it this way.
[1:41:28] You know, it's interesting to think
[1:41:30] about it in this context. Again, more of
[1:41:32] a parable. You know, it's like it's like
[1:41:35] the devil's not all knowing, right?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Can't read your mind.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; You know, he's been crafting his attack
[1:41:42] all these generations and these years,
[1:41:45] but he's not all knowing. So, he
[1:41:47] thought,
[1:41:49] I know what to do.
[1:41:52] The cloud came from a rocket.
[1:41:58] And people left. And I know that hits
[1:42:00] close to home. People left.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And he thought, yes, I have dismantled
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; this message of the hour.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And he's laughing and he's saying, you
[1:42:12] know, it's like that, you know, death,
[1:42:14] death, is he still? He says, I still got
[1:42:16] him. Is he still there? The death says,
[1:42:18] I still got Jesus. He's still down
[1:42:20] there. And the devil says, yes, I've got
[1:42:23] him. And then
[1:42:25] people just kept coming and then there
[1:42:28] was a new pastor and this is happening
[1:42:29] other places and he says he says um
[1:42:33] death do we have him? No, he rose you
[1:42:35] know he came through it.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, right.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; So then he's like man that didn't work.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Please give me some liberty
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; to paint a picture here.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; As I'm not a artist.
[1:42:52] So he says, "Ah yes,
[1:42:56] I have a new idea.
[1:42:59] What if because those people, they they
[1:43:01] all believe the prophet too much. So
[1:43:03] what if I use the prophet to fight the
[1:43:07] word?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; What if I don't even make them denounce
[1:43:11] the prophet?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; What if I what if they don't even turn
[1:43:15] their back on the prophet? They just
[1:43:16] begin to preach against
[1:43:20] the open word,
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; which by the way, he has no idea. So
[1:43:23] he's totally guessing cuz he's like,
[1:43:24] "What is that? What is it?" And it was
[1:43:26] in secret.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; So saints, you can say, "Oh, well, I'm
[1:43:31] not anti- message. I believe in brother
[1:43:33] Brandham.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I believe Brother Brandham came. I
[1:43:36] believe the cloud was actually
[1:43:38] vindication."
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Right? and you begin to minister
[1:43:41] Pentecostal doctrine and Baptist
[1:43:43] doctrine under the guise of the message
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; and you have quotes to back you up,
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; So when we're standing against anti-
[1:43:54] message, are we standing against anti-
[1:43:56] message, which is Christ, or are we
[1:44:00] standing against anti-profit
[1:44:03] people?
[1:44:04] See, the devil got us really distracted
[1:44:06] with all of that.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; People stood up, including me as a young
[1:44:09] man. And I I stood up, you know, and I
[1:44:11] preached the message,
[1:44:13] right? And it was like, well, you know,
[1:44:15] the word just comes and the word
[1:44:17] vindicates itself and the word
[1:44:18] interprets itself by coming to pass. And
[1:44:19] then God, you know, we don't need to get
[1:44:21] up there and start slaying these people,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; The word comes.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I mean, that happened here. I said it
[1:44:27] hit close to home. That happened here.
[1:44:28] The word just began to minister to
[1:44:29] everyone goes, "Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen."
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, the point I'm making
[1:44:34] is what if the word is used against the
[1:44:38] word?
[1:44:39] lowercase W
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; against uppercase W.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; So they're doing the same thing. What
[1:44:48] does our Bible teach us? See, Brother
[1:44:51] Brham, they didn't have the Bible when
[1:44:53] Jesus was walking on earth. Brother
[1:44:55] Brandham is bringing that that pattern
[1:44:58] present.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "What does our Bible teach us?
[1:45:03] God is love."
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Sounds good.
[1:45:08] Who was the fir? Who was the first with
[1:45:10] you when you were born? Your kind old
[1:45:12] priest.
[1:45:15] Who come to you when you was in need,
[1:45:17] didn't have no money, and loaned you
[1:45:19] some money. Your kind old priest who put
[1:45:23] his hand on your shoulder and on your
[1:45:25] mother's shoulder when you was about to
[1:45:26] separate and prayed you back to God.
[1:45:28] Your kind old priest. Who was it that
[1:45:32] was here for you when you were
[1:45:33] struggling? Your church.
[1:45:36] And now you want to say your church is
[1:45:39] wrong.
[1:45:41] Who was it took sides with you when you
[1:45:43] and your neighbor were fussing and
[1:45:45] brought you back together in fellowship?
[1:45:47] Your kind old church. Kind old priest.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Who is it is the last words going to say
[1:45:58] over you at the day out chandonder? Who
[1:45:59] is it? They let you lay there and rot,
[1:46:01] but your kind old priest comes and
[1:46:02] blesses you and sends the word of God
[1:46:05] along with you. Your kind old priest.
[1:46:10] Are you with me?
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; You see, they were using the Torah,
[1:46:15] using the word of Moses, the word of
[1:46:17] their messenger
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; to say Jesus was wrong.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] What about this guy called Jesus of
[1:46:29] Nazareth?
[1:46:31] Jesus of Nazareth, not of Bethlehem.
[1:46:35] People are scratching their heads
[1:46:36] saying, "Look, it says of Bethlehem and
[1:46:40] this guy's of Nazareth. What are people
[1:46:42] doing?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; I got the book in Moses, blah blah blah
[1:46:47] blah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Your kind old priest had to sacrifice
[1:46:50] all of his life. That pastor gave you 30
[1:46:53] years of his ministry
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; and you're just going to walk away from
[1:47:00] him.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; His grandfather was a priest. His great
[1:47:06] great great great grandfather was a
[1:47:08] priest. He put his whole time in the
[1:47:10] organization. He is trained to the word.
[1:47:13] He knows what he is talking about.
[1:47:17] The problem is how did they know
[1:47:22] how what gave what basis did they say he
[1:47:25] knew what he was talking about?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Because somebody told them he knew what
[1:47:29] he was talking about.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the word spoke of what he
[1:47:33] was saying.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; The only way to catch Jesus in their
[1:47:38] midst was they needed to know what the
[1:47:40] word said about the coming Messiah.
[1:47:43] Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Now, now we're talking about fruits of
[1:47:48] the spirit. Kind, love, joy, peace,
[1:47:51] understanding, longsuffering, patience.
[1:47:53] Fruit of the spirit. What about this
[1:47:56] Jesus? Where did he come from?
[1:48:00] They didn't even know where he came
[1:48:01] from.
[1:48:03] 30 years
[1:48:05] he walked around building furniture.
[1:48:12] Jesus,
[1:48:14] I can see his brothers, you know, they
[1:48:16] believe on him later. I think they did.
[1:48:17] I'm not sure. But in the moment, Jesus,
[1:48:21] you're just going through a midlife
[1:48:22] crisis.
[1:48:25] You know, John's a charismatic guy and
[1:48:27] you're just bored. You know, you've been
[1:48:30] back here with dad building furniture.
[1:48:33] By the way, this looks really good, man.
[1:48:34] Good job on this. You know, I mean, look
[1:48:36] at this. You want to give up this craft?
[1:48:40] You want to, you know, I mean, look at
[1:48:42] dad, right? He's getting a hold. He can
[1:48:45] hardly hold the chisel anymore.
[1:48:48] He can't run the planer.
[1:48:51] A few years later, you know, Jesus is at
[1:48:54] it again and his brothers come to him.
[1:48:57] Look, dad's passed on. Somebody's got to
[1:48:59] keep the furniture business going.
[1:49:02] But you're just going to walk away.
[1:49:05] You just, you know, you're in a midlife
[1:49:07] crisis, right? Yeah. We told you about
[1:49:09] it last year. You know, like get a hold
[1:49:12] of yourself. Dad just died. I
[1:49:14] understand. You're sad. You're
[1:49:16] depressed. You know, it's hard losing
[1:49:17] dad. And you're going to go follow this
[1:49:19] guy named I mean, the guy doesn't even
[1:49:21] wear normal clothes.
[1:49:26] He's got camel hair.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; He's like, you know, we've been using
[1:49:30] camels for like 120 years. Nobody's ever
[1:49:32] thought, "Hey, that looks great as a
[1:49:34] tunic."
[1:49:38] And he eats bugs, man. He eats bugs and
[1:49:41] and and he's
[1:49:43] I heard he was, you know, chewing out
[1:49:45] the Pharisees, which I kind of liked,
[1:49:47] but still like, you know, leave that guy
[1:49:49] alone. Don't be getting all weird. And
[1:49:51] Jesus says, "No, it's time for me to
[1:49:54] go."
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; You're going to have the same pattern in
[1:49:58] your life.
[1:49:59] that spirit is going to come whispering
[1:50:01] to you saying, you know, you're going to
[1:50:02] go off the deep end, right?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; And he says, "No,
[1:50:07] I know you're right. And maybe you'll
[1:50:08] delay it for a little bit." Like, I know
[1:50:10] you're right. You just It's too crazy,
[1:50:13] right? Like, we've got this whole thing.
[1:50:15] We got this whole community. We got the
[1:50:17] message and you know, it's everywhere we
[1:50:19] go and there's people and and it's like,
[1:50:21] why? Wh why? And you're saying that like
[1:50:24] like there's people who say they believe
[1:50:25] the prophet and believe the message and
[1:50:27] and and you're saying they're not
[1:50:29] preaching the message. You're trying to
[1:50:32] tell me that my pastor, you know, this
[1:50:34] preacher or or this ministry or or what
[1:50:36] I believe is not true, like there's
[1:50:38] something more or better. Look, we heard
[1:50:41] all about this. Add one word or take one
[1:50:43] word from it. Your place will be taken
[1:50:45] off the book of life. We've heard about
[1:50:47] this, Jesus. I don't think you should
[1:50:49] go.
[1:50:51] But you see, there was something in
[1:50:52] Jesus that couldn't hold him back.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; There was something because he was the
[1:50:57] perfect word made flesh.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Put your halo back in your back pocket.
[1:51:03] He was all God and all man. So he had to
[1:51:06] fight the same demons.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; He had to fight that spirit.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Say, "You're going off the deep end."
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yep. Right.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Look, that girl across town, she's been
[1:51:17] here a few times over the past year. You
[1:51:20] know, Jesus, come on, man. You're 30,
[1:51:22] bro. Like, people get married around
[1:51:25] here at like 15.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; And Jesus just said, "Thanks." And
[1:51:36] walked out.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Thanks, but no thanks.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And walked out. And in every single
[1:51:42] church age, Jesus in his bride said the
[1:51:45] same thing.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; No thanks. And walked out.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; No thanks, Luther.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And walked into Wesley.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Pentecost said, "No thanks, Wesley."
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; And walked into
[1:51:59] what
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; should be Christ himself in the flesh in
[1:52:05] you and I.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; The word revealed.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to go through the same
[1:52:09] thing because this is the age that you
[1:52:11] live in. You can't change it. Yeah,
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; you cannot change when you were born and
[1:52:16] the fact that you are here and this is
[1:52:18] the time that you get to live in.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; You can't change it.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; So, it's time for the bride of Jesus
[1:52:24] Christ to say, "No thanks."
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; And walk out.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Walk out where? What are you going to
[1:52:32] do? Where are you going to go?
[1:52:36] I don't know. But who else has the words
[1:52:37] of life? Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; The pattern repeats itself over and over
[1:52:44] and over again.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; And the devil loves to slip in and say,
[1:52:47] "See, it's your pastor.
[1:52:51] It's you.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You need to walk out of the spiritual
[1:52:55] condition you're in."
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Into the truth.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; You need to tell yourself, the word
[1:53:01] needs to speak back to your body
[1:53:04] and say, "No thanks." Yeah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; And walk into heavenly places.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Say, "No thanks. I know it's a creature
[1:53:11] of time, but he said bone of my bone and
[1:53:14] flesh of my flesh."
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So you body will obey my confession.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Not just for healing of the flesh, but
[1:53:23] healing of the spirit, healing of the
[1:53:26] heart. Wounds come, wounds come upon
[1:53:29] you, and sometimes they come from good
[1:53:32] people that you misunderstood.
[1:53:36] A spirit begin to whisper in your ear.
[1:53:39] And if you could see into the spiritual
[1:53:40] realm right now,
[1:53:44] things are happening. God is speaking.
[1:53:47] At the same time, the devil is
[1:53:49] whispering.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; The word is speaking and there's a war
[1:53:53] within.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; There's a battle within.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And whoever you fed last week is winning
[1:54:00] today.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] So, not much fruit of the spirit there.
[1:54:09] What about this Jesus? All he does is
[1:54:12] try to tear up the schools that we've
[1:54:14] built. Not much fruit of the spirit
[1:54:16] there, is it?
[1:54:18] What did he do up there where them poor
[1:54:21] merchants down there and the
[1:54:22] businessmen, they don't raise sheep. So,
[1:54:24] they set a little pin out there so man
[1:54:25] could bring in a sheep. That poor
[1:54:27] businessman, he wants to offer a sheep
[1:54:29] because it's God's requirement. Oh,
[1:54:33] sounds so good.
[1:54:36] What has this Jesus of Nazareth done?
[1:54:38] Kicked over his tables, took some
[1:54:41] leather, played it together, beat them
[1:54:43] priests out of there, and called your
[1:54:45] kind old priest a snake in the grass, a
[1:54:49] hypocrite.
[1:54:53] Now, you call that fruit of the spirit?
[1:54:55] Certainly not. No more than you think of
[1:54:57] compassions and him going through a
[1:54:59] multitude of people there. Never heard
[1:55:01] of it. Never healed any of them. full of
[1:55:04] compassion. He is full of compassion and
[1:55:06] never healed any of them. People with a
[1:55:08] carnal mind will never know it. It's a
[1:55:12] revelation. Them priests had 10 times
[1:55:16] the fruit of the spirit.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Esau
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; was a good old Christian.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; How would you know what's right? Oh yes.
[1:55:29] Thank you.
[1:55:32] Now we can get down.
[1:55:35] Now we can get down to where the rubber
[1:55:37] meets the road.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; How can you tell?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; How would you know what's right? The
[1:55:45] manifestation of the spoken word of God
[1:55:50] being made manifest the light of the
[1:55:52] hour. Certainly there is what the
[1:55:54] evidence of the Holy Spirit is.
[1:55:56] Believing the word of God when it's
[1:56:00] manifested.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:04] believing the word of God when it's
[1:56:07] manifested.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for the manifestation
[1:56:16] of the promise.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You and I are looking for that word to
[1:56:22] be manifested inside of our lives.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; We're not looking
[1:56:34] Put it this way. What does the word say
[1:56:36] about the bride?
[1:56:38] Go find out. I'm still looking and I
[1:56:41] still keep finding things and finding
[1:56:44] things and finding things.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And the Lord keeps revealing himself to
[1:56:49] me in his sovereignty.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; And the promise becomes life.
[1:56:55] It's so simple, saints of God. It's so
[1:56:58] simple. And when you know the world
[1:57:00] stole that. If you know, you know. In
[1:57:03] other words, if you've got the
[1:57:04] revelation, you know.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; You get it.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; You get it. And if you want to get it
[1:57:12] and you don't, you'll get it.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; If your desire in your heart is, Lord,
[1:57:17] show me. Lord, show me. I want to know
[1:57:20] what all these people are talking about.
[1:57:23] I want to know. Many times it's not even
[1:57:26] people.
[1:57:27] Sometimes you feel like you're alone
[1:57:29] alone on an island, but the Lord keeps
[1:57:32] speaking to you, speaking to you,
[1:57:35] speaking to you, and you you try to you
[1:57:37] try to just, you know, okay, yes. No,
[1:57:39] I'm going to put that behind me, and I'm
[1:57:41] just going to
[1:57:43] you know, I went through that. I
[1:57:44] thought, well, no, no, no, no. See, no.
[1:57:47] Just just focus on the message. Preach
[1:57:49] the message. Preach the Bible. Next
[1:57:51] thing you know,
[1:57:54] there it is again.
[1:57:56] And there it is again, the word building
[1:57:59] up and manifesting and expanding and
[1:58:02] opening up. And I said, "Well, I'm not
[1:58:04] listening to any other man."
[1:58:06] So, but they're preaching the same
[1:58:08] thing. So, no, no, no, focus message,
[1:58:12] the sermons of brother Brand. I'm in the
[1:58:14] Bible. The sermons in the Bible. Then
[1:58:16] he's like third pole, opening of the
[1:58:18] word, seven seals, Christ in you,
[1:58:22] manifesting in you. And then you're
[1:58:25] looking at, oh, he he stepped out, took
[1:58:27] the book, redee redemption's plan, the
[1:58:29] name, your name's written in the book,
[1:58:31] and and you're looking up saying, I have
[1:58:34] lost my mind.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not the same thing over
[1:58:42] and over again. God's trying to show you
[1:58:45] again in his word,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; again in his word from a different
[1:58:50] perspective
[1:58:51] of what he's doing in your life.
[1:58:54] We just looked at John as the forerunner
[1:58:56] and how God worked in him and progressed
[1:58:59] him up to the point and then the word
[1:59:00] came and we see the second forerunner.
[1:59:03] The same exact pattern happened. We can
[1:59:06] look then at a very personal level at
[1:59:07] the woman at the well just like you and
[1:59:10] I. And he begins to speak to us first
[1:59:12] pull second pull and then he reveals
[1:59:14] himself to us.
[1:59:19] Says I am he that speaketh to thee. You
[1:59:21] see, it's the same thing there over and
[1:59:25] over. Sorry, it's not the same thing.
[1:59:28] It's the same vision.
[1:59:30] And the word ministers and he comes
[1:59:32] through this way and he comes through
[1:59:34] this way and he moves and he slips
[1:59:36] through and he comes and he ministers to
[1:59:38] you and then he he points you to this
[1:59:40] over here and he points you to that over
[1:59:42] here and he has you sit and he has a
[1:59:44] minister come and he has your pastor
[1:59:46] preach on a certain thing and you sit
[1:59:48] down and you happen to push play on a on
[1:59:51] a certain sermon and and then God speaks
[1:59:53] to you and God's showing you and all you
[1:59:56] have to do is say,
[2:00:01] you don't have to say anything.
[2:00:02] Actually,
[2:00:04] you just have to surrender to him.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; That's all she did. She said, "You sound
[2:00:12] like the Messiah."
[2:00:16] She was there. And it wasn't cuz she
[2:00:18] said those words. That's where we always
[2:00:21] want to go. Like, okay, what was those
[2:00:22] words that Brother Chris said? Okay,
[2:00:26] you sound like the Messiah.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's just religion.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; And it gets you nowhere.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You have to pray, "God, I need you to
[2:00:37] meet me at the well.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; I need you to meet me." See, that's
[2:00:41] Jacob's well.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Coincidental.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, the word says, "Esau have I
[2:00:49] Jacob have I loved. Esau have I hated."
[2:00:52] Jacob put that well there. Isaiah
[2:00:54] references the heritage of Jacob.
[2:00:58] There she stood looking at the
[2:01:01] manifestation of the heritage of Jacob,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; which was what? Birthright.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; All I want is the birthright. All I want
[2:01:11] is the birthright. All I want is the
[2:01:14] word. How do I know I'm saved? What do
[2:01:16] you want? The word.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Welcome to the kingdom of God.
[2:01:21] What can you never get enough of? The
[2:01:23] word. Welcome to the kingdom of God.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; What were you just reading? What were
[2:01:28] you just feeding on over the past couple
[2:01:29] days? Oh, I heard brother Brandham was
[2:01:30] preaching and a Bible verse and I read
[2:01:32] this over here and the pastor preached
[2:01:34] this over here and then you see again,
[2:01:37] it's not those words you use in
[2:01:38] conversation cuz people do that. It's
[2:01:41] something that speaks from the heart.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You see, stop looking to your brother or
[2:01:47] your sister to confirm what God's done
[2:01:49] in you. Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; And stop looking at your brother or your
[2:01:53] sister trying to confirm what God's done
[2:01:55] in them.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; You just need to get Christ in you.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; You need to focus on him and he will
[2:02:02] lead you. He said, "Yay, though I walk
[2:02:04] through the valley of the shadow of
[2:02:05] death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
[2:02:08] with me. Thy rod and thy staff shall
[2:02:11] comfort me." He is the bread of life.
[2:02:14] And this morning, by his grace and his
[2:02:16] sovereignty, he has broken that bread
[2:02:18] for us. Can we receive that?
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[2:02:23] you so much for coming here and speaking
[2:02:26] to us, Lord. Father, we are so grateful,
[2:02:29] Lord Jesus, that you have come and
[2:02:30] broken the bread of life to us. Lord,
[2:02:32] your word has been spoken. Your word has
[2:02:34] been given not from my own opinions, not
[2:02:37] from my own thoughts, Lord Jesus, but
[2:02:39] Father, you have come and speak spoken
[2:02:41] to us, Lord. Father, you've spoken very
[2:02:43] directly to individuals, Lord Jesus. I
[2:02:46] pray they would receive that, Lord. the
[2:02:47] devil wants to come and and come in with
[2:02:49] doubts and ideas and spirits and
[2:02:51] different things and try to turn us
[2:02:53] aside. But Lord, you have spoken. And I
[2:02:55] pray that Lord, it would be received.
[2:02:57] Now, Lord, there's a promise that said
[2:02:59] if if we would cast our breads upon the
[2:03:02] waters, if we would say if we would give
[2:03:04] it to you and and surrender it to you,
[2:03:06] you would come back and prove that word
[2:03:08] to us. You said your word would not
[2:03:10] return to you void. Father, there's
[2:03:13] going to be a bride coming on that word.
[2:03:15] And Lord, if your word has been spoken
[2:03:17] this morning, which I believe, Lord,
[2:03:19] that word will find a resting place in
[2:03:21] the heart of the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:03:23] and word will come back to word. Father,
[2:03:26] bless your people this morning. Bless
[2:03:28] this church, this assembly, Lord. May
[2:03:30] you continue to encourage them and be
[2:03:31] with them, Lord. May they just cons
[2:03:33] continue to throw themselves at your
[2:03:35] feet and say, "Father, not my will, but
[2:03:38] thy will be done." Thank you, Father. In
[2:03:41] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You
[2:03:44] know, saints of God, I was thinking
[2:03:47] about love the other day, and I almost
[2:03:50] preached on that this morning. I just
[2:03:52] want to say this.
[2:03:54] True love is when you look and say,
[2:03:56] "What can I do for that person? How can
[2:03:59] I how can I encourage that person? How
[2:04:02] can I pray for that person?" You look at
[2:04:03] your wife and say, "What can I do for
[2:04:05] her?"
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; You look for opportunities to please
[2:04:08] her, to put a smile on her face. And the
[2:04:10] wife looks at the husband and says,
[2:04:11] "What can I do to to please him?
[2:04:14] play that. Do you know that song
[2:04:15] pleasing? Yeah. Can you play that? You
[2:04:18] look and say, "I just want I just want
[2:04:20] what can I do?" And and if that's how
[2:04:22] you look at your spouse or that's how
[2:04:24] you look at your your family, you know,
[2:04:26] you'll begin to look to Christ and say,
[2:04:28] "Father, how can I please you?" Esther,
[2:04:30] who was a type of the bride of Jesus
[2:04:32] Christ, what's the difference between
[2:04:34] Esther and Vashi? Oh, you say, "Well,
[2:04:36] she didn't come when she was called."
[2:04:37] And that's true, and there's many
[2:04:38] different types. But what was the
[2:04:40] biggest thing Esther said? I only want
[2:04:42] what the king wants.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, she loved the man before
[2:04:46] she even knew who he was.
[2:04:51] And she began to learn about him.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; She fell in love. You see that right
[2:04:55] back there, the word returning to the
[2:04:57] word. Divine love, divine love in your
[2:05:00] life placed there before the foundation
[2:05:02] of the world begin to project
[2:05:05] and sovereign grace took its place.
[2:05:08] Amen. Jesus Christ himself took the
[2:05:11] place right inside of you because you
[2:05:13] said I that's perfect love agape love is
[2:05:16] perfect love says what can I do for
[2:05:19] Christ I'm not talking about how can you
[2:05:20] clean the church and all those things
[2:05:22] are good I'm talking about personally
[2:05:24] spiritually what can you do what of
[2:05:26] yourself can you surrender you say I
[2:05:28] want that word that you've spoken of to
[2:05:30] be manifested in my life then look and
[2:05:32] say God what can I do to give you more
[2:05:36] what can I do to give you more of
[2:05:37] myself. How can I give myself over to
[2:05:39] you more than I did yesterday? Now,
[2:05:41] we're talking about divine love. And
[2:05:44] when that divine love inside of you
[2:05:46] begins to project,
[2:05:48] sovereign grace takes its place. Jesus
[2:05:51] Christ steps down into you. Oh, saint, I
[2:05:56] feel right for a rapture.
[2:05:59] Let's sing this song. Pleasing, let me
[2:06:01] be pleasing to you. Pleasing.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Let me be pleasing
[2:06:10] Jesus. Just make it a prayer. Lift your
[2:06:12] hands. Let everything
[2:06:16] I do
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; be pleasing
[2:06:22] to you.
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:30] Let everything
[2:06:32] that I pursue
[2:06:37] be pleasing,
[2:06:40] oh Lord,
[2:06:41] unto you.
[2:06:45] Sing it to him now.
[2:06:48] pleasing.
[2:06:52] Let me be pleasing
[2:06:56] to you.
[2:06:59] Let everything
[2:07:02] I do
[2:07:05] be pleasing
[2:07:08] to you.
[2:07:12] Praying.
[2:07:16] Let everything
[2:07:19] that I pursue
[2:07:23] be pleasing,
[2:07:26] oh Lord,
[2:07:28] unto you.
[2:07:31] Let's stand together. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:07:33] Oh, pleasing.
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:39] Let me be pleasing
[2:07:43] to you.
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:46] Let everything
[2:07:49] I do
[2:07:52] be pleasing
[2:07:55] to you.
[2:07:58] Praise.
[2:08:02] Let everything
[2:08:04] that I pursue
[2:08:09] be pleasing,
[2:08:12] oh Lord,
[2:08:14] unto you.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you so much for your being
[2:08:20] attentive this morning. Pray that you
[2:08:22] can just take and say, Lord, when things
[2:08:25] get, he doesn't want you to feel
[2:08:26] overwhelmed. You know, you look at your
[2:08:28] face and you know, you look at yourself
[2:08:30] in the mirror of God's word. You can
[2:08:31] kind of feel overwhelmed sometimes.
[2:08:32] That's that spirit of discouragement.
[2:08:34] You just say, "Lord, I want to be
[2:08:36] pleasing to you." You say, "I want I
[2:08:39] want to know more of you. I want to
[2:08:40] understand you more this week." Make
[2:08:42] that your write it on your sticky note.
[2:08:44] Put it on your screen. Say, "God, I want
[2:08:46] to be pleasing to you." And as you give
[2:08:49] to him, he fills that up with himself.
[2:08:52] God bless you all this morning. Amen.
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:08:56] More that I surrender,
[2:09:02] lighter
[2:09:03] my Lord.
[2:09:07] The more that I release my cares, the
[2:09:12] more you take control,
[2:09:17] the more that I can humble myself,
[2:09:22] the more you lift me up.
[2:09:26] Every day I live.
[2:09:30] Lord, I love you more.
[2:09:37] And the more that I surrender,
[2:09:42] the lighter
[2:09:44] my Lord,
[2:09:47] the more that I release my care.
[2:09:52] more you take control,
[2:09:57] more that I can humble myself.
[2:10:02] Lord, you lift me up
[2:10:06] every day I live.
[2:10:10] Lord, I love you.
[2:10:15] Oh, fill my cup, Lord.
[2:10:19] I lift it up.
[2:10:22] Lord,
[2:10:25] oh come and quench
[2:10:29] this thirsting
[2:10:31] of my soul.
[2:10:37] Bread of heaven,
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:41] feed me till I overflow.
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:48] Oh, here's my cup.
[2:10:52] Fill it up and make me whole.
[2:10:58] Oh, there's millions in this world.
[2:11:00] There are millions in this world who are
[2:11:06] craving
[2:11:09] the visure
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:13] earthly things of
[2:11:16] [Music]
[2:11:19] oh but none
[2:11:22] can match this wonderous treasure
[2:11:29] that I Find
[2:11:32] in Jesus Christ my Lord.
[2:11:38] Fulfill my cup
[2:11:41] Lord.
[2:11:43] I lift it up
[2:11:46] Lord.
[2:11:49] Come and quench
[2:11:52] this thirsting
[2:11:54] of my soul.
[2:11:59] Bread of heaven,
[2:12:02] feed me till I overflow.
[2:12:09] Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me
[2:12:16] whole.
[2:12:19] And there's the hardness
[2:12:24] for the water.
