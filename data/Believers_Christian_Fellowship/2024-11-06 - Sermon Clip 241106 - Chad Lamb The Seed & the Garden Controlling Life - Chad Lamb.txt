========================================

and when the word went forth now it becomes a seed it has to fall somewhere if God said it there's bound to be a womb somewhere for it to fall into so Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that was God he didn't worry about the science the education he didn't worry about the civilization he didn't worry about whether it made sense or didn't make sense he just said what God Said a virgin shall conceive that's that word was a seed that seed moved out it had to find a good ground to get planted and it had to find womb somewhere and that somewhere was the Virgin Mary amen and when the angel of the Lord came to the Virgin Mary when Gabriel came to the Virgin Mary and said listen now it's you you're the one that's going to happen to you she said how's that possible I don't know a man he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you she said be it unto me according to your word not let me think about it not give me some time you know I've got my own plans I want to accomplish some things in life I I I'm going to Bear a reproach you know I I I will become pregnant it'll change the way I walk it'll change my life it'll take over me it'll change my physique it'll change my plans it it yes yeah she didn't care about her plans she didn't care about her physique she didn't care about anything the word had come to her and there was something in her that says I'll receive that seed you can have my body you can have my womb you can have my whole life if it brings me rejection if it brings me if it if it ruins my future marriage to Joseph whatever happens happens it doesn't matter because I'm not here to dictate how life will come I'm not here to control life I'm not here to control the word control the seed control life I'm only here to receive the seed to give it a place to come forth on this Earth amen we are the garden that God wants to plant his seed in he's the gardener he has the seed he wants to plant his seed in the in and in his garden amen and it's not up to the Garden it's up to the gardener it's up to to the male not to the female and the garden can't say you can't plant that seed now I'm not ready when he was ready he came to marry Mary didn't say well give me uh 10 more months let me go I want to get my degree first I want to I want to see if I can become CEO I want to Mary's our example not this modern Church who's got agendas and want to accomplish things and they don't want to surrender to the word of God because it would take over their bodies it would change their walk they couldn't keep doing what they want they can't go on with their own agendas and their own programs and their own ideas and their own scientific achievements and their own accomplishments they're going to have to be bear reproach they're going to have to be rejected they're going to have to give up their life in order what in order to receive this seed that comes from Christ
