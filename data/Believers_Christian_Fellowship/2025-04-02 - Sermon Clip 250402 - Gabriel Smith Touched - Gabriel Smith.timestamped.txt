[0:00] and so she didn't even want to touch his
[0:02] shoulder his hand his foot cuz he may
[0:05] feel
[0:07] it but she said if I could just barely
[0:10] touch that just to
[0:12] himm and not disturb
[0:16] him that's how low she was that's right
[0:20] but it was at that low
[0:22] moment where she had the greatest
[0:26] faith and so many times in life God
[0:30] breaks us down to where we get to the
[0:34] lowest of the
[0:36] low but that's where he wants
[0:42] you and you say why because because we
[0:46] are so she she had to spend everything
[0:50] because she had to get rid of all of her
[0:56] sufficiency when when when the cupboards
[0:58] was empty
[1:03] and every she every
[1:12] homeopathic right when everything was
[1:15] spent and there was nothing
[1:18] left that's what God wanted her and you
[1:22] say well why would God allow that to
[1:24] happen because she had to be just like
[1:27] all of us look some people could just
[1:29] believe it and move on others of us are
[1:31] so
[1:37] stubborn that he has to break us down to
[1:41] such a place to where we have nothing
[1:44] left when we're at our lowest it was so
[1:47] low look where when she got on that
[1:50] ground and where do you think she was at
[1:53] she didn't been I don't believe she been
[1:55] over and touch to him because the Bible
[1:58] says that the people were thr in him
[2:00] that means choking
[2:02] him and and when he said when he stopped
[2:04] and he said who touched me look the the
[2:08] the the multitude choked the word and
[2:12] the disciples rebuked the word but she
[2:16] and her littleness touched the
[2:19] word and when she touched
[2:22] him with something that could not be
[2:25] felt by man virtue left him am when he
[2:31] was not phased by the
[2:33] multitudes but when this little
[2:39] insignificant when she touched him she
[2:43] was able to pull something from
[2:45] him God got her to that place so that
[2:49] she could be totally emptied
[2:53] out the same way he gets us to those
[2:58] places because he he wants us totally
[3:02] emptied out
