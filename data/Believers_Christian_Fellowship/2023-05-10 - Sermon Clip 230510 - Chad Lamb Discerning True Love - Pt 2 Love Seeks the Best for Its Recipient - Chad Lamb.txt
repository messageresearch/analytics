TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now there was a very short route to Palestine to the promised land but God didn't take him on the short easy route because God knew that if they went the short easy route they could see War too early and be discouraged so God took him on a much more difficult route and he moved them by way of the Red Sea where they would get pinned in and trapped then he would open up the Red Sea and bring him across then they would get into the Wilderness amen where their bread would run out and then he would provide bread then they would come to where their water ran out and then he would provide water he took them in a much more difficult path than the easy path right across the top skirting right around the Mediterranean Sea and going right into Palestine and you think God can do anything he wants he could just blow him away and move no God God is always doing what's best for the ones he loves so they wouldn't be discouraged before he moves them around and now what's he doing he's taking them by a harder way because the harder way he keeps reinforcing I'm with you I'm covering for you I'm parting the sea I'm feeding you I'm giving you water why how did they know I mean how did they see God manifesting not through the easy route but through the hard route and the hard route gave God the opportunity to continually manifest his love it manifestes protection and provision and Care amen was manifested in the harder way amen we wonder sometimes why is my life always the harder way amen because God has something better for you and I not the easy way it seems like life's so easy for some amen so hard for others amen give me the way that God has chose because the way that God has chose is for my benefit because his love is always for the benefit of the one who's loved he's not he's not mad at us he's not punishing us he's not trying to kill us but he's bringing us into perfection
