[0:01] Ask me why I'm happy. Oh, I'll just tell
[0:05] you why.
[0:07] Because my sins are
[0:10] gone. And when I meet the scoffer who
[0:14] asks me where they are, I
[0:18] say, "My sins are
[0:20] gone." Oh, they're underneath the blood
[0:25] of the cross of Calvary.
[0:28] as far removed as darkness is from
[0:31] dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[0:35] That's good enough for me. Praise
[0:39] God. My sins are
[0:42] gone. Was at the old time altar where
[0:46] God came in my heart and
[0:50] now my sins are
[0:53] gone. Oh, the Lord took full possession.
[0:57] The devil did depart. I'm
[1:00] glad my sins are
[1:03] gone. For they're underneath the blood
[1:07] of the cross of
[1:09] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[1:12] from
[1:13] dawn. Oh, in the sea of God's
[1:17] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[1:19] me. Praise
[1:21] God. My sins are gone.
[1:25] When Satan comes to tempt me, tries to
[1:29] make me doubt. I
[1:32] say my sins are
[1:35] gone. Oh, you got me into trouble, but
[1:39] Jesus got me out. I'm
[1:42] glad my sins are
[1:45] gone. Oh, they're underneath the blood.
[1:49] Cross of
[1:51] Calvary as far removed as darkness is
[1:54] from
[1:56] dawn in the sea of God's
[1:59] forgetfulness. Good enough for me.
[2:02] Praise God. All my sins are
[2:06] gone and I'm living now for Jesus. Happy
[2:11] night and day
[2:13] because my sins are gone.
[2:17] My soul is filled with music. With all
[2:21] my heart I say I
[2:24] know my sins are
[2:27] gone. Oh there underneath the blood of
[2:31] the cross of
[2:33] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[2:36] from
[2:37] dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:41] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:46] Oh my sins are praise God. Oh praise
[2:50] God my sins. One more time. Oh praise
[2:55] God my sins are
[2:58] gone. Amen. Praise God. The Lord is our
[3:02] rock. In him we hide. A shelter in the
[3:06] time of
[3:08] storm. Secure
[3:11] whatever it'll be tied. shelter in the
[3:15] time of
[3:16] storm. Oh, Jesus is the rock in a wey
[3:21] land. A weary land, a wey land. Jesus is
[3:27] the rock in a weary land. A shelter in
[3:31] the time of
[3:33] storm. A shade by day, defense by night.
[3:38] A shelter in the time of storm.
[3:42] No fears alarm, no foes of pride,
[3:47] shelter in the time of
[3:50] storm. Oh Jesus is the rock in a weery
[3:54] land. A weery land. A weery land. Jesus
[4:00] is the rock in a wey land. A shelter in
[4:04] the time of storm.
[4:07] The raging storms may round us be a
[4:11] shelter in the time of
[4:14] storm. We'll never leave our safe
[4:19] retreat. Shelter in the time of
[4:22] storm. Oh Jesus is the rock in a wey
[4:27] land. A weery land. A wey land. Jesus is
[4:33] the rock in a wey land. A shelter in the
[4:37] time of
[4:39] storm. Oh rock divine, oh refuge near.
[4:44] Shelter in the time of
[4:47] storm. Be thou our helper ever near.
[4:52] Shelter in the time of
[4:55] storm. It's Jesus's rock in a wey land.
[5:01] Weary land. A weary land. Jesus is the
[5:06] rock in a weary land. A shelter in the
[5:10] time of
[5:12] storm. Amen. So thankful for that
[5:15] shelter in the time of storm
[5:18] into the
[5:21] chamber. Be free,
[5:24] Holy Spirit.
[5:27] Oh, speak to me
[5:31] gently as I close the
[5:36] door. Oh,
[5:39] heavenly
[5:41] lover, let your
[5:44] presence cover.
[5:47] Your kind of
[5:51] unending is all I long
[5:57] for.
[5:58] Into the
[6:01] chamber. Be free.
[6:04] Holy
[6:06] Spirit, speak to me
[6:11] gently as I close the door.
[6:18] Heavenly
[6:20] lover let thy
[6:23] presence
[6:27] cover
[6:30] unending is all I want once
[6:35] more. Oh
[6:37] into the
[6:39] chamber be free Holy Spirit.
[6:45] Oh, speak to me
[6:49] gently as I close the
[6:54] door.
[6:56] Heavenly
[6:58] lover, let your
[7:01] presence
[7:03] cover.
[7:05] Shakina
[7:08] unending is all I long for.
[7:15] Amen. As brother Chad comes tonight,
[7:17] let's just sing this. Oh, how He loves
[7:18] you and
[7:20] me. Oh, how He loves you and
[7:28] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[7:36] me. For he gave his life.
[7:42] What more could he
[7:46] give? Oh, how he loves
[7:51] you. Oh, how he loves
[7:55] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[8:02] me. Once
[8:04] again. Oh, how he loves you and me.
[8:11] He loves
[8:13] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[8:21] me. For he gave his
[8:25] life. What more could he
[8:30] give? Oh, how he loves
[8:35] you. Oh, how he loves me.
[8:40] Oh, how he loves you and
[8:47] me. Amen. Let's bow our heads together
[8:51] this evening. Dear Lord Jesus, how
[8:54] thankful we are for your love. For God,
[8:58] as undeserving as we are, you loved us
[9:00] anyhow. You loved us before. And God, we
[9:04] thank you, God, for all that you've done
[9:05] for us and all that you revealed to us.
[9:08] Lord, as we come tonight to feast on
[9:10] your word, we ask, God, that you would
[9:11] come and take control once again, that
[9:14] you would use this method that you
[9:16] orchestrated, this way that you set for
[9:18] us, that you might speak to us, Lord.
[9:20] And may you come and work in the gift
[9:22] you placed here. May you use this vessel
[9:24] of clay for your honor. May you give us
[9:26] ears to hear and our heart to perceive
[9:28] all that you have for us. May we receive
[9:30] your word and may it change us, Lord.
[9:32] May you give us clear vision and good
[9:34] understanding for the hour that we live
[9:36] in. And God, may you accomplish your
[9:38] purpose in each one of us. For that's
[9:40] our desire, Lord, to be used by you,
[9:42] Lord, to be a vessel that you can work
[9:44] through to accomplish your end time
[9:46] purpose. We love you. We ask that you
[9:48] would take part of every part of this
[9:50] service, take control, and have your
[9:52] liberty now as you bring your word to
[9:54] our hearts. In Jesus Christ's name we
[9:57] pray. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. God
[10:01] blesses. You take your Bibles while
[10:03] we're yet standing. Thank you,
[10:04] musicians. We're going to turn to the
[10:07] book of John. And while you're turning
[10:09] there, I just want to send you greetings
[10:11] from Brother Marcus Becker. He made it
[10:12] home safely. So, we certainly enjoyed
[10:14] having him here. We had a wonderful
[10:16] service here on Sunday morning, but also
[10:18] the youth meeting was really wonderful
[10:20] and we enjoyed having him at both of
[10:23] those services. Also want to remind you
[10:25] that this Monday will be the Memorial
[10:27] Day picnic. That'll be at uh Brother
[10:29] Benjamin and Sister Amanda Seabolt's
[10:31] home. If you could please remember, if
[10:33] you haven't done so yet, to sign up at
[10:34] the desk in the foyer so that we can get
[10:36] a good headcount and make good
[10:38] preparations for that, that'd be
[10:40] wonderful. If we could look at uh John,
[10:43] we're going to look at John chap 20.
[10:46] We'll begin reading verse 21. Before
[10:47] that, I want to welcome back Brother
[10:49] Alex and Sister Amy Bartum. It's good to
[10:51] have you guys back with us back from
[10:52] their honeymoon. Amen. Now, we didn't
[10:55] know what seat would be their regular
[10:56] seat because every by time they get
[10:58] married, they have to pick their seat.
[10:59] So, now everybody knows this is their
[11:00] seat.
[11:02] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's look at
[11:04] John 20
[11:09] 21. Then said Jesus to them again,
[11:13] "Peace be unto you. As my father has
[11:15] sent me, even so send I you." And when
[11:18] he had said this, he breathed on them
[11:20] and saith unto them, "Receive ye the
[11:23] Holy Ghost." May God bless you as you
[11:25] have your
[11:26] seats. Amen. And brother Frank, if you
[11:28] can bring up that um title slide. Amen.
[11:32] We're going to continue on with the same
[11:34] thought we've been on in God and
[11:35] partnership with man. This will be part
[11:37] three. We actually have a subtitle,
[11:40] respecting the vessel. And hopefully as
[11:42] we move down this evening and begin to
[11:44] share some of what's on our heart, you
[11:46] can see why we titled it that way. Uh
[11:49] but uh before I get started, before I
[11:52] get going too fast, I just want to once
[11:53] again just thank brother Franco for
[11:55] helping with the PowerPoint. He's the
[11:57] one who he just takes my notes last
[11:59] minute and he's got some way of doing
[12:01] it. I don't know how he does it and he
[12:03] turns it into a PowerPoint which is so
[12:05] nice because it helps me so much. I'm
[12:08] not very good at making them and if I
[12:09] have to make one I get stressed and
[12:11] nervous and all these other things and
[12:13] it takes me a couple hours and he can do
[12:15] it in like 30 40 minutes. I don't know
[12:16] how he does it but it's amazing to me.
[12:18] So, thank you, brother Franco. Amen. I
[12:21] like it because it helps me, especially
[12:22] on a Wednesday night, stay on task, go a
[12:24] little quicker, and we can all read
[12:26] through the quotes and the scriptures
[12:27] together. So, I I appreciate very much.
[12:30] Brother Ram's going to reference, he's
[12:32] going to make mention of this scripture
[12:34] and this next quote of this scripture
[12:36] that we just read. And he says, notice,
[12:39] he said, "As the father sent me, so send
[12:42] I you." The father that sent him went in
[12:44] him to confirm the word. And the same
[12:47] Jesus that sends his people goes in the
[12:49] people that he sends and saying, "The
[12:51] work that I do shall you do also." Sure,
[12:54] he prayed that we might be one. One with
[12:56] him, not one with organization, not one
[12:58] with a system, but one with God. For God
[13:02] in his word is one. And Jesus and God
[13:04] was one. And you and I in the word must
[13:06] be one. That's right. We must be one in
[13:08] agreement with the word. Amen. So in
[13:11] order to be one with the word, you have
[13:13] to be in agreement with the word. Amen.
[13:15] So there's a part that you have to play.
[13:17] There's something in you that you have
[13:18] to agree with the word and then God gets
[13:21] free reign to begin to work his word
[13:22] through us. Amen. But he says the God
[13:25] that went with the God that sent them
[13:27] went with them. And that's what Jesus
[13:29] was telling his disciples. He said,
[13:31] "Peace be unto you as my father has sent
[13:33] me. Even so send I you." And then he
[13:35] breathed on them and he says, "Receive
[13:38] ye the Holy Ghost." And so he showed
[13:39] that the God who sent him came in him.
[13:42] and the God Christ that sent the
[13:44] disciples came in them to do the work.
[13:46] This is what we're looking at with God
[13:48] in partnership with man. He says in
[13:51] souls that are in prison now. So
[13:53] therefore, he has partnershipped, you
[13:55] see, and taken this man earthly and his
[13:58] eternal spirit and put it together
[14:00] because God reflected himself back in
[14:02] that that he became a man when he became
[14:04] Christ Jesus and he was God.
[14:07] God was in Christ and see lived in him
[14:10] reconciling the world to himself and
[14:12] through that perfect man each one of us
[14:14] imperfect that believe in God and has
[14:17] accepted that becomes the perfection of
[14:19] him. So God has a way to take us flawed
[14:23] and imperfect and coming in a perverted
[14:25] way. He's made a way where he can take
[14:27] us sanctify us by by his own blood by
[14:30] the washing of the water of the word and
[14:32] dwell in us now in partnership himself
[14:35] with mankind. It's no longer God above
[14:37] us and it's no longer just God with us,
[14:39] but now it's God moving down into us,
[14:41] moving down into his body to finish his
[14:44] work upon the earth. This is God
[14:46] partnershipped with man. Amen. Amen. And
[14:48] so now we know that the power he told
[14:51] the disciples, a stay in Jerusalem till
[14:53] you be endued with power from on high
[14:56] and it will give you power, amen, to be
[14:58] my witnesses. So you cannot just do it
[15:01] just in the flesh. You can't just go out
[15:02] and decide, I'm going to witness for No,
[15:05] it takes a power that's beyond your
[15:07] power. It takes the power of Christ
[15:09] himself dwelling in you. Amen. To make
[15:11] you a witness. That's why he didn't want
[15:13] him to go into the ministry without
[15:14] being endued with power from on high.
[15:17] Because God is not God has not asked us
[15:19] to do everything by ourselves. That's
[15:22] right. He's promised to be with us in us
[15:27] and in us to the end. Amen. Amen. In
[15:30] John 14:10, he says, "Believest thou not
[15:32] that I am in the Father, and the Father
[15:34] in me." The words that I speak unto you,
[15:36] I speak not of myself, but the Father
[15:37] that dwelleth in me, he doeth the work.
[15:40] Jesus became our example, and he began
[15:42] to show, listen, this isn't just me
[15:44] alone. Amen. This is the father in me.
[15:46] Amen. Doing the work. And then we get to
[15:49] Acts 3 and 12. And when Peter saw it,
[15:52] this is after Peter and John, they
[15:54] prayed and they they healed the the
[15:56] blind man that laid by the gate
[15:57] beautiful and he went leaping and
[15:59] jumping into the temple. And they all
[16:00] came and began to worship Peter and
[16:02] John. And Peter saw it. He answered unto
[16:04] the people, "Ye men of Israel, why
[16:06] marvel you at this? Or why look you so
[16:08] earnestly on us? As though by our own
[16:10] power or holiness, we had made this man
[16:12] to walk." They saw and they heard and
[16:15] they seen what Peter had done. They saw
[16:17] a man go over and take another man by
[16:20] the hand and lift him up. And as they
[16:22] lifted him up, his ankle bones and legs
[16:24] received strength. And the man who was
[16:25] lame from birth and laid there so many
[16:28] decades, Amen. now was running and
[16:30] leaping. They couldn't they couldn't
[16:31] fathom anything else than this man here
[16:34] had power to heal that man there because
[16:37] that's all they saw. But Peter's wanting
[16:39] them to understand something else. Hey,
[16:41] listen. What you saw wasn't our strength
[16:43] or our holiness. We didn't do it. Amen.
[16:46] There's another life inside of us and we
[16:48] did it by the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:50] Christ. Amen. So that's how God will
[16:53] still do his works in this day.
[16:56] Amen. Amen. He'll still accomplish it
[16:58] the same way.
[17:01] In this message, Christ is identified
[17:04] the same in all generations. He says,
[17:06] "Now, what is this? It's a gift." See, a
[17:09] gift isn't something like a stick or a
[17:11] sword you you cut with with and things.
[17:14] A gift is a way to get yourself out of
[17:16] the way. Amen. I have to get myself out
[17:19] of the way. Then the Holy Spirit takes
[17:21] over. See, it isn't what you take and do
[17:24] something with. It's a gift to get
[17:26] yourself out of the way. Then God uses
[17:29] you. So that's why, you know, if you
[17:32] have a gift, you can't even really take
[17:34] credit for the gift because he said the
[17:36] real gift isn't even the gift. The real
[17:38] gift is being able to get yourself out
[17:40] of the way so the gift can operate.
[17:42] Amen. So that we in our flesh don't
[17:44] hinder the thing that God's trying to
[17:46] do. That's the real gift that he's given
[17:48] to us is to learn how to relax and move
[17:50] out of the way and let God move through
[17:53] us in new ministry. This is a quote that
[17:56] we read before, but I want to read it
[17:57] again and I want it to to stay lodged
[17:59] into our minds. He says, "Now you say,
[18:02] well, if he knows it, then why are you
[18:05] preaching?" He says, "He just told us
[18:07] God knows the end from the beginning. He
[18:08] knows all things. He knows who will be
[18:10] saved and who won't. He says, "Then why
[18:12] are you preaching?" He said, "That's God
[18:15] part of God's program. Preaching is his
[18:17] program." When he looked upon the
[18:19] apostles, he looked upon the harvest. He
[18:21] said, "The harvest is ripe and the
[18:23] labors are few. Pray the Lord of the
[18:24] harvest that he will send labors into
[18:27] his harvest." How many remember that?
[18:29] Well, why would they have to pray to the
[18:31] Lord of the harvest to send labors into
[18:33] his harvest if the Lord of the harvest
[18:34] was standing there knowing it would be
[18:37] done? Why? God has so arranged it that,
[18:40] now listen to this, God has so arranged
[18:43] it that his program cannot move without
[18:45] you and I. And as long as we're not
[18:48] doing what God leads us to do, we're
[18:50] paralyzing his program.
[18:53] But when the church moves by the
[18:55] anointing of the Holy Ghost, then we're
[18:57] in God's will doing his program. So this
[19:00] isn't doing everything according to your
[19:02] ideas and your plan or a program of the
[19:04] church, but it's moving by the
[19:06] inspiration of the Holy Ghost. And as
[19:08] long as we do as we don't do what God's
[19:10] leading us to do, then we're paralyzing
[19:13] his program. I think that's amazing.
[19:15] That that quote to me is kind of a
[19:18] mind-blowing quote. We've we've read it.
[19:21] We've talked about it. This isn't the
[19:22] first time we've been through it, but
[19:24] it's mindblowing because we know what
[19:26] paralysis is. Paralysis is an inability
[19:29] to move. If my arm, if my left arm is
[19:32] paralyzed, I have no ability to move my
[19:34] arm. it doesn't function normally and I
[19:37] can do no work with it whatsoever. It's
[19:39] as if it was dead. It's paralyzed. And
[19:42] as long as we're not doing what God's
[19:44] leading us to do, we are paralyzing his
[19:47] program, making it impossible to work.
[19:51] That's that's what's so amazing to me
[19:52] about this quote. It's like, how how can
[19:55] we do that? Can't God do everything?
[19:58] Yes, God can do let's let's look at
[20:01] this, okay? God can do everything. Yes,
[20:03] God can do everything. But the all
[20:06] powerful, all knowing, Amen. all
[20:08] powerful God, Amen. He chose which
[20:11] manner in which he would operate. And he
[20:12] binds himself by his own law and by his
[20:16] own will. And so there are limitations
[20:18] of what God can do. Not limitations
[20:21] somebody else put on him, but
[20:22] limitations he placed upon himself.
[20:25] You remember when he went into
[20:27] compertium and he could not do many
[20:29] mighty works there because of their
[20:30] unbelief. because they didn't believe
[20:33] God could not work.
[20:36] So God, brother Bam says, God is a
[20:38] gentleman. The Holy Ghost is a gentleman
[20:40] and he'll never ram his way into you or
[20:43] force anything upon you. Amen. That's
[20:45] why faith is so important. There has to
[20:48] be an agreement with the word of God.
[20:50] There has to be a faith that lines up to
[20:52] it that gives God, Amen, free access to
[20:55] your free will and allows him to work
[20:57] because he doesn't work contrary to free
[20:59] will. Amen. And part of the partnership
[21:02] he put man uh he he when God put God uh
[21:05] man in partnership with him. He gave him
[21:07] the power of free will or free choice.
[21:09] And that's part of the partnership. And
[21:11] God will not violate that part of the
[21:13] partnership.
[21:15] So if you're not going God's
[21:17] predestinated way, God has a way to help
[21:20] you want to go his way.
[21:24] Amen. He won't force you, but he'll make
[21:27] it really convenient for you to go his
[21:29] way versus the way you want to go.
[21:31] Because the way that we want to go often
[21:34] leads to death and destruction. Not that
[21:35] God causes death and destruction, but
[21:37] our own mind according to our own will
[21:39] leads us that way because it's contrary
[21:41] to the will of God. Amen. Contrary to
[21:43] the word of God. Amen. So God never
[21:46] forces anything. So God can do
[21:48] everything. God can do all things, but
[21:50] there's certain there's certain lines or
[21:52] boundaries he himself will not cross.
[21:55] That's right. And so, if we're not doing
[21:57] what he leads us to do, he won't force
[21:59] us to do it. If we're not doing what he
[22:01] leads us to do, he won't go get somebody
[22:03] else to do it if he's ordained for us to
[22:05] do it because he won't change his
[22:06] ordained plan.
[22:09] So, if we're not doing what he leads us
[22:11] to do, we're paralyzing his program.
[22:14] I find that an amazing
[22:16] statement. And it makes me it makes me
[22:20] tremble a little bit because I don't
[22:21] want to paralyze this program.
[22:24] There's a there's a certain amount of
[22:27] sensitivity we need to God. There's a
[22:28] certain amount of searching God,
[22:31] searching for God and surrendering to
[22:32] God that we all need. Amen.
[22:36] When we look at this scripture, I'm
[22:38] going to go back and we're going to talk
[22:41] about Moses a little bit again like we
[22:43] did last time. But in Acts 7 and when
[22:47] Stephen is is giving his great address
[22:49] before they stoned him before the
[22:51] council in Acts 7, he says when and and
[22:54] when 40 years were expired, there
[22:56] appeared to him in the wilderness of
[22:58] Mount Si an angel of the Lord in a flame
[23:00] of fire in a bush. When Moses saw it, he
[23:03] wandered at the sight. And as he drew
[23:05] near to behold it, the voice of the Lord
[23:07] came unto him, saying, I am the God of
[23:09] thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the
[23:11] God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then
[23:13] Moses trembled and dured not behold.
[23:16] Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy
[23:18] shoes from thy feet, for the place where
[23:19] thou standest is holy ground. And I have
[23:22] seen, I have seen the affliction of my
[23:24] people, which is in Egypt, and I have
[23:26] heard their groaning, and I am come down
[23:28] to deliver them, and now come, I will
[23:31] send thee unto Egypt.
[23:33] this Moses whom they refused, saying, he
[23:36] who made thee a ruler and a judge. The
[23:38] same did God send to be a ruler and a
[23:41] deliverer by the hand of the angel which
[23:43] appeared to him in the bush. He brought
[23:45] them out after that he had showed
[23:46] wonders and signs in the land of Egypt
[23:48] and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness
[23:51] 40 years. So God came down and he says,
[23:54] "I've come down. I've heard the cry of
[23:56] my people. I've seen their trouble. I've
[23:58] come down deliver. Now come, I'm sending
[24:01] you to Egypt because my coming to
[24:03] deliver them will be in you. Amen. It'll
[24:07] be made manifest in you and through you.
[24:09] And Moses, who they refused to be a
[24:11] judge over them, God sent to be a judge
[24:13] and a deliverer to them. So who was the
[24:16] deliverer?
[24:19] Was it Moses or was it God? And the
[24:22] answer is
[24:23] yes. Because it was God and Moses.
[24:26] Remember, it was God partnershipped with
[24:31] Moses.
[24:33] And we go back to this little bit of
[24:35] this dialogue that we looked at in
[24:37] Exodus last time. Exodus 4. And I'm not
[24:39] going through all of it, just a small
[24:41] portion. Says, "And Moses said unto the
[24:43] Lord, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent,
[24:46] neither hi hereto for nor since thou
[24:48] hast spoken to thy servant, but I am
[24:50] slow of speech and of a slow tongue."
[24:54] And the Lord said unto him, "Who hath
[24:55] made man's mouth? Or who maketh the dumb
[24:59] or deaf or the seeing or the blind? Have
[25:01] not I, the Lord? Now therefore, go and I
[25:04] will be with thy mouth and teach thee
[25:07] what thou shalt say?" This is after the
[25:09] third excuse Mo, this is the third
[25:11] excuse Moses is giving. And God's
[25:13] answered him twice before. This is the
[25:14] third time he said, "I'm not eloquent."
[25:16] He said, "Who made the mouth? Who made
[25:17] the mouth that speaks? Who made the ear
[25:19] that hears? Now you go and I'll be with
[25:22] your mouth." Yeah.
[25:24] and teach thee what thou shalt say. And
[25:26] he said, "Oh my Lord, send I pray thee,
[25:29] by the hand of him who thou will send."
[25:32] He says, "God, send somebody else." And
[25:35] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[25:37] against Moses. And he said, "Is not
[25:39] Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know
[25:41] that he can speak well. And also,
[25:43] behold, he cometh forth to meet thee,
[25:45] and when he seeth thee, he will be glad
[25:47] in his heart." So here we we've we
[25:50] talked about this last time in detail
[25:52] how Moses has this dialogue with God
[25:55] where he's constantly trying to get out
[25:56] of what God's asking him to do. God's
[25:59] telling them, "I'm come down to deliver.
[26:01] Now's the time. Now's the season." And
[26:03] listen, Moses used to believe he was
[26:05] that deliverer. He heard what his mother
[26:07] told him. He when he sat on her knee,
[26:09] she talked to him about it. He believed
[26:11] it. But he had already failed. He had
[26:13] run away and he spent 40 years in the
[26:15] wilderness. Now God comes to him and
[26:17] says, "I've come down to deliver. Here's
[26:19] a supernatural sign. You go down." And
[26:21] he starts to say, "But no, I can't. They
[26:23] won't listen." And all of these things
[26:24] and it culminates with the anger of the
[26:27] Lord being kindled against Moses because
[26:30] he wouldn't go. And finally, he he just
[26:33] finished. Amen. I I say God's just
[26:36] finished. But Moses submits and he
[26:39] surrenders and now Aaron will be his
[26:41] mouthpiece. And God gives them these
[26:44] these signs, the sign of the rod and the
[26:46] sign of the hand. And and we talked
[26:48] about that, but I want to spend a little
[26:49] more time on that this
[26:52] evening. In perfect strength, brother
[26:54] Bam says there's so many of us likes to
[26:57] testify or likes to think that we're
[26:59] insufficient. And therefore, we make
[27:02] that an excuse. I have no education. I
[27:05] have no ability. I'm unable to do this.
[27:08] And if you keep that up and do that in
[27:10] that way, keep going like that, then you
[27:12] can't amount to nothing.
[27:16] Does anybody feel insufficient?
[27:19] Incapable, not good
[27:22] enough. Amen. That's a standard common
[27:25] feeling amongst us unless we have some
[27:29] disorder. And we've seen people with
[27:31] disorders, you know, they think too
[27:32] highly of themselves and they think
[27:34] they're the most wonderful thing ever.
[27:36] But in general, human beings are
[27:37] suffering with this lack of of of
[27:40] self-confidence, this understanding of
[27:42] their weakness and inability. But we
[27:44] can't make that an excuse for not
[27:46] serving God or not doing what he's
[27:47] leading us to do.
[27:50] He
[27:51] says, if you if you keep going like
[27:54] that, then you can't mount to anything.
[27:57] But the very thing that we make excuses
[27:59] by our weaknesses, God uses that very
[28:01] thing to tackle the job with. He's He
[28:04] waits for us to get to that condition so
[28:07] that he can use us. We take the excuses
[28:10] and say, "Well, I I can't do this. I'm
[28:12] insufficient. I can't do it." And God
[28:14] takes the very thing to do the job with.
[28:17] That's true. That's the reason why that
[28:19] he chooses us because we're in that
[28:22] condition. The very thing that keeps us
[28:25] from thinking we can be bride is the
[28:28] very reason why he chose us to be in his
[28:30] bride. the very things that keeps us
[28:32] from thinking that we're capable of
[28:33] doing what he asked us to do in this end
[28:35] time by manifesting Christ in the way
[28:38] and in a maturity and the and the
[28:40] fullness of the expression of Christ and
[28:41] the statue of a perfect man in adoption
[28:43] and we think I'll never attain to it. I
[28:45] can't do it because of this this this
[28:47] and this. That's the very reason he
[28:49] chose you. Amen. Is because you can't do
[28:52] it. The very reason he chose you is
[28:55] because you're weak and incapable.
[28:58] That's the very reason he chose Moses.
[29:01] But as long as Moses felt that he could
[29:04] do it in his strength, God wasn't ready
[29:06] to use Moses yet. And so Moses tried and
[29:09] Moses failed. And then he ran through
[29:10] the wilderness for 40 years. And and and
[29:13] in his failure, he moves from such a
[29:17] high position and a high level and the
[29:19] greatest government upon the earth at
[29:21] that time, the greatest kingdom with the
[29:22] most wealth and power, greatest
[29:24] education and all of that. He loses that
[29:26] position. and he comes down and now he's
[29:28] working for his father-in-law, tending
[29:30] his sheep on the back side of the
[29:32] desert. And brother Benham said, "And
[29:33] God gave him a hot-tempered wife."
[29:37] Amen.
[29:42] Until 40 years with a hot-tempered wife
[29:45] and a bunch of sheep and goats on the
[29:47] back side of the desert finally fixed
[29:51] him. So if you have a hotteered wife,
[29:54] don't complain. God's just shaping you
[29:55] and molding you into
[29:58] perfection. Brought him into the
[30:00] position where I can't do it. They won't
[30:03] listen to me. I'm not capable. I'm
[30:06] unable. And God was like, "That's Yeah,
[30:10] perfect. Now you're
[30:12] ready. Now you're ready." And so God, if
[30:17] we could just just adjust our thinking a
[30:19] little bit, that's the way God wants it.
[30:25] God needs us and we need him and he
[30:30] needs us to need him
[30:33] because if we stop needing him, we
[30:35] become dangerous. Amen.
[30:39] Because if he gives gifts and he gives
[30:41] authority, if you think of Moses, the
[30:43] gifts that he gave Moses as a as a
[30:45] mighty prophet and remember Moses even
[30:48] when he was outside the will of God and
[30:51] smiting the rock twice, even though God
[30:54] told him speak to the rock, not smite
[30:56] it, and he smoteed it, because of his
[30:58] position, the rock split and water came
[31:00] anyways
[31:02] because God honored that gift. remember
[31:05] uh uh a member Elisha and the she
[31:08] bears Elisha that wasn't the spirit of
[31:10] Christ. That was an angry prophet. That
[31:13] was that man. But because of his
[31:15] position and the authority and the gift
[31:17] that was in him, God would honor that
[31:19] gift. And when those 42 children were
[31:21] mocking him and said, "Go up, baldhead.
[31:23] Go up." He turned and cursed him. And
[31:25] two she bears came out of the woods and
[31:27] rent and tore and killed 42 of those
[31:29] children. Amen. because of his position,
[31:32] because of his authority, it still
[31:33] worked. But look at how dangerous that
[31:36] is.
[31:37] It's dangerous to be gifted.
[31:41] A man's gift will destroy him.
[31:45] Listen, it was Elvis Presley's gift that
[31:48] sent him to hell. Amen. Amen. He was
[31:52] super talented musician, super gifted
[31:55] singer, and it was the gift that
[31:58] destroyed his life.
[32:00] A a gift is
[32:03] dangerous. An ability, a talent is
[32:07] dangerous. A position with God is
[32:09] dangerous. So God needs the weakness in
[32:13] our life to keep us dependent on him
[32:15] because the gift in our life and the
[32:17] position he wants to put us in is often
[32:19] very
[32:20] dangerous. So let's embrace our
[32:23] weakness.
[32:25] Let's start thanking God that he left
[32:27] weakness in our life. and you say, "Why
[32:29] am I always struggling with this and why
[32:31] can I never seem to get over this and
[32:33] I've always got this?" But that you
[32:35] don't we don't understand. Sometimes
[32:36] that's the very grace of God in our
[32:38] lives to keep us utterly dependent on
[32:40] God. Amen. So that we cannot branch out
[32:43] on our own. We cannot make it on our own
[32:45] because if we did, we would become
[32:47] extremely dangerous.
[32:51] Amen.
[32:54] Amen.
[32:57] Now look in perfect strength he says if
[32:59] you'll notice the Bible it's always
[33:01] those who are trying to get away from it
[33:03] that God
[33:04] uses as long as a man listen very
[33:08] carefully as long as a man wants to do
[33:11] something and thinks he's got enough
[33:14] ability he can put the job over God
[33:17] could never use that man
[33:20] look at Moses running look at Paul
[33:22] running and the rest of them trying to
[33:24] get away from him I said Don't seek
[33:26] nothing. God's got anything for you.
[33:28] He'll give it to you. See, and just let
[33:31] him take care of that. I want you to
[33:34] understand this mentality is so
[33:36] important because
[33:38] if if a man wants to do something and
[33:43] thinks he's got enough ability, he can
[33:45] put the job over, God can never use that
[33:48] man. That kind of thinking is very
[33:51] dangerous.
[33:53] very dangerous because if you think you
[33:56] got to you want to do something for God,
[33:58] you think you've got the ability that
[34:00] meets that need, then all of a sudden
[34:03] you're now doing it and you're not doing
[34:05] it with an utter dependency upon God.
[34:08] Amen. Amen. And that thing will go
[34:11] rogue.
[34:13] It'll go bad because you can do it.
[34:18] Because you can do it and you got what
[34:20] it takes to do it and you want to do it
[34:22] and you know that you can do it. And
[34:24] when you're in that position, that thing
[34:26] will go bad.
[34:29] Who is the most gifted person in heaven?
[34:35] Lucifer.
[34:36] Who could get the job done? Lucifer. who
[34:40] was full of wisdom and perfect in
[34:42] beauty. Lucifer.
[34:45] Amen. I'm telling you, God made him
[34:49] perfect in every way.
[34:53] Because perfect in every way will go
[34:56] bad.
[34:59] And God knew he would go bad because
[35:02] that would serve his purpose because God
[35:04] needed to display his attributes. And he
[35:05] could only display his attributes white
[35:07] against a backdrop of black. And so God
[35:10] needed an antagonist. God needed a
[35:12] reason to be a redeemer. He needed a
[35:14] reason to be a healer. He needed a
[35:15] reason to be a savior. And so God could
[35:18] never make a vessel corrupted.
[35:22] God can't make anything imperfect.
[35:24] He can't make anything that's corrupt.
[35:26] He can't make anything that's evil. God
[35:28] is perfect in every way. He cannot make
[35:31] anything perverted or corrupt or evil.
[35:34] Amen. So what God did was make him
[35:38] absolutely perfect. Amen. Because
[35:41] absolutely perfect was the most
[35:43] dangerous thing for Lucifer and Lucifer
[35:45] became extremely dangerous. And the
[35:47] thing says he was the Bible says he was
[35:49] deceived by his own
[35:52] brightness. He was deceived by his own
[35:54] perfection because he didn't have flaw.
[35:57] He didn't have inability. He could get
[35:59] the job done. He had what it takes. He
[36:01] had the power and the strength to do it.
[36:03] And because of that, he was deceived by
[36:05] his own brightness. And he
[36:07] self-corrupted.
[36:09] And think about what brother Bam tells
[36:11] us. He said Lucifer, Amen, thought he
[36:14] could build a brighter and better
[36:17] kingdom than Michael's humble little
[36:19] kingdom.
[36:21] This this terminology is so important
[36:23] that Brother Ram's showing us a picture
[36:25] when God and Michael is a type of Jesus
[36:28] Christ. He's Christ in an angelic form
[36:30] as the archangel. And in that he had a
[36:32] kingdom and jurisdiction, but it was
[36:34] humble. Amen. So that means it had
[36:38] limits. It wasn't as perfect as
[36:42] Lucifer. So in Lucifer's eyes, Michael
[36:46] had a humble little kingdom. Why did God
[36:49] give Michael a humble little kingdom?
[36:51] Because
[36:53] God didn't want him to go
[36:56] rogue. That's right.
[36:59] I'm telling you, if you're extremely
[37:01] gifted, super intelligent, wise, you've
[37:03] got money, you've got good health and
[37:05] strength, be careful.
[37:07] You're on dangerous ground.
[37:09] But if you got troubles in your life and
[37:11] you're squeezed a little bit and things
[37:13] aren't going well and you really can't
[37:14] figure anything out and you're an
[37:16] emotional roller coaster, then praise
[37:17] God, he can use you.
[37:20] Praise the Lord. Because you have to
[37:22] have him. You can't do it by yourself.
[37:24] And you know you can't do it by
[37:25] yourself. And you know if God asks you
[37:27] to do it and he doesn't help you, you're
[37:28] going to make a miserable mess of it.
[37:29] That's the perfect place to be, friends.
[37:32] That's why God lets us have all kinds of
[37:34] troubles. And we're all surrounded with
[37:35] troubles. I mean, we're like Moses on
[37:37] the back side of the desert.
[37:38] Everything's falling apart. Amen. My
[37:41] household's not even in in harmony.
[37:45] And he finally got him to the place
[37:47] where he knew he couldn't do it. And
[37:49] when he got Moses to the place where he
[37:50] knew he couldn't do it, then God was
[37:52] ready to use him to do it.
[37:56] So, let's not try to pretend we're so
[37:58] perfect.
[38:00] Yeah. Let's not try to be so bright.
[38:03] Let's not try to be the epitome of
[38:05] perfection. Let's just be real. Let's
[38:08] just be genuine and real and have a
[38:11] humble little kingdom like Michael had.
[38:14] That isn't so perfect. And we don't
[38:15] always have it figured out. And I'm not
[38:17] always I don't I'm not always on a high
[38:20] every day, but sometimes I don't feel so
[38:22] good. And I don't really figure it out.
[38:24] And I made a few mistakes along the way.
[38:26] And I made decisions I regret. And and I
[38:28] and I wish I knew better. I wish I
[38:30] understood better. I wish I knew the
[38:31] message better. I wish I knew my Bible
[38:34] better. Instead of saying, "I'm so glad
[38:37] I know my Bible." Why don't we move to
[38:39] the other side and say, "You know what?
[38:40] I really don't know anything like I
[38:42] ought to know it. I wish I had better
[38:43] revelation. I wish I had clearer
[38:45] vision." Amen. I wish I had more prayer
[38:48] time. I wish I was more dedicated. I
[38:50] wish I was more consecrated.
[38:55] Because that's the right
[38:57] attitude for God to use. Not upon our
[39:00] make believe, but where we really are.
[39:03] So, let's just be real because that's,
[39:05] you know, that's where God wants us to
[39:08] be because he wants to use us. And he
[39:12] can only use us when we're dependent
[39:14] upon him. And he can only use us when we
[39:16] think that we're not good enough and we
[39:18] can't do it. Then he can use us.
[39:23] Praise
[39:25] God. It It's amazing
[39:27] how life plays tricks on us and we get
[39:32] deceived by humanity and the common
[39:35] thinking of man. And we don't realize
[39:37] how much of Lucifer's nature was
[39:40] actually injected into humanity at the
[39:42] fall. That's right. There's a pride that
[39:44] comes in and this desire for perfection
[39:47] and this idea that we're full of wisdom
[39:51] and perfect and beauty and everything
[39:53] that Lucifer was. And we we want to be
[39:56] this shining star, this all-encompassing
[40:00] uh bottle of perfection in human flesh.
[40:02] And anything under that, then we start
[40:04] we we go one of two ways. We either uh
[40:07] we either overperform and we strive for
[40:10] this perfection and we try to hide all
[40:12] our mistakes by
[40:14] perfection or we only notice our perfe
[40:17] our mistakes and judge it by perfection
[40:19] and feel like we're unworthy worms no
[40:21] good and we'll never do anything and go
[40:22] and sulk and hide in the corner and
[40:24] never try.
[40:26] We we tend to fall on one of these two
[40:28] sides. But I'd like to be right in the
[40:29] middle. Amen. I'd like to realize, you
[40:31] know what, I I am nothing special, but
[40:34] God still called me. Amen. In my flesh,
[40:37] I can't really accomplish anything. And
[40:39] if God doesn't help me, I'll make a big
[40:40] mess out of everything I try to do. But
[40:43] with God's help, all things are
[40:44] possible. If God before us, who can be
[40:47] against us? If God does the work, it'll
[40:49] come out right.
[40:52] Amen. I I believe those are the vessels
[40:55] that he can use for his glory.
[41:00] 1 Corinthians 15:9 says, Paul says, "For
[41:03] I am least of the apostles, that I am
[41:05] not meat to be called an apostle because
[41:07] I persecuted the church of God. But by
[41:10] the grace of God, I am what I am." Amen.
[41:12] And this grace which was bestowed upon
[41:14] me was not in vain, but I labored more
[41:16] abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but
[41:18] the grace of God which was with me. Look
[41:21] at how he makes this statement. I love I
[41:23] love the way Paul says it. Listen, I'm
[41:25] not even worthy to be called an apostle
[41:28] because in my wisdom, in my zeal, I was
[41:31] I was persecuting the church of God. So,
[41:34] in in the peak of Paul's ability, he was
[41:38] exactly going the wrong direction,
[41:40] fighting against the thing, the truth
[41:41] that he was trying to uphold. So, in all
[41:44] of his wisdom and all of his knowledge
[41:45] and all of his strength, he was
[41:47] absolutely misled, deceived, and going
[41:49] the wrong direction. And so he says,
[41:52] "I'm not even worthy to be called an
[41:54] apostle because I persecuted the church,
[41:58] but not by ability and not by wisdom,
[42:01] not by strength, but by the grace of
[42:02] God, I am what I am." But hey, he says,
[42:06] now the this next sentence is so good.
[42:11] He says, "And his grace which was
[42:13] bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I
[42:15] labored more abundantly than they all."
[42:18] And it's almost like while he's writing
[42:20] or dictating, he corrects
[42:22] himself. But my labor was more abundant
[42:25] than they all, but yet not I, but the
[42:27] grace of God which was in me. I don't
[42:28] want you to think that it was my labor
[42:30] alone. Amen. I labored, but it was the
[42:32] grace of God that was in me. I think
[42:35] Paul learned, Amen. He learned where his
[42:38] strength came from.
[42:41] Again, in perfect strength, he says
[42:43] that's when God can use you. That's when
[42:45] he can use any of you. He can use
[42:47] anybody when we get out of the way, but
[42:50] as long as we got ourselves in the way,
[42:52] then we cannot. So sometimes we, you
[42:55] know, we look at this and say, you know,
[42:57] we get ourselves out of the way and God
[42:59] can use us. We get in our own way so
[43:02] many times and sometimes the way that we
[43:04] get in our way is thinking that nothing
[43:07] God can never use us for anything and
[43:09] we're no good and never will amount to
[43:11] anything. And sometimes that gets in the
[43:13] way. Yeah. because then we just never go
[43:15] do what God's calling us to do because
[43:17] we think there's no way that we can do
[43:18] what God's calling us to do.
[43:20] And knowing we can't do what God calls
[43:22] us to do is a good thing. Amen. But then
[43:25] not doing it is a bad thing.
[43:29] So it's good for us to say I can't do
[43:31] what Lord's asking me to do in my own I
[43:34] can't do it. But if he'll be with me and
[43:37] in me like he promised then I can do it
[43:40] because with God all things are
[43:42] possible. So sometimes the the
[43:45] the excuses that we allow to come into
[43:49] our mind because of our weaknesses are
[43:52] actually preventing us like Moses from
[43:54] just going forward and doing what God
[43:56] called us to
[43:57] do. God says, "I have come down
[44:02] and I'm sending you." Amen. Moses looked
[44:07] at himself and said, "I can't do it."
[44:09] But he forgot who came down.
[44:12] He forgot where the real power was. I
[44:16] mean, God has called us to be his
[44:18] representation on the earth in the end
[44:20] time. And you say, "But I can't. You
[44:22] don't know my past. You know how many
[44:23] times I've tried. You don't know my
[44:24] complexes. You don't know." But don't
[44:27] forget who came down.
[44:29] Don't forget who's come down in this
[44:31] day. What that cloud represents. Don't
[44:34] forget what power has come to accomplish
[44:37] this work. But he's got to do it in
[44:39] partnership.
[44:41] Amen. Amen. Let's go back. I'm going to
[44:44] look at Exodus again. Exodus chapter 7.
[44:47] This is when he comes to
[44:49] Pharaoh. And the Lord spake unto Moses
[44:51] and unto Aaron, saying, "When Pharaoh
[44:53] shall speak unto you, saying, Show a
[44:56] miracle for you, then you shall say unto
[44:58] Aaron, take thy rod and cast it before
[45:00] Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent."
[45:02] And Moses and Aaron went in unto
[45:04] Pharaoh. And they did so as the Lord had
[45:06] commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod
[45:09] before Pharaoh and before his servants
[45:11] and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh
[45:13] also called the wise men and the
[45:15] sorcerers na now the magicians of Egypt.
[45:17] They also did in like manner in their
[45:20] enchantments for they cast down every
[45:22] man his rod and they became serpents.
[45:24] But Aaron's rod swallowed up their
[45:27] rods. Amen.
[45:30] When God was giving a sign to Moses, he
[45:34] told him, "Take thy rod and throw it on
[45:36] the ground." Now, it's a curious thing
[45:39] to me to wonder how long Moses had
[45:42] carried that rod. It was a rod that he
[45:45] had picked up or maybe Jethro gave to
[45:46] him. Maybe he found, he cut, he I I
[45:49] don't know. He shaped, maybe he scraped
[45:51] all the bark off of it. Maybe he carved
[45:52] his initials in. I have no idea. But it
[45:55] was his shepherd's staff that he carried
[45:56] with him. And he had carried it. I don't
[45:59] presumably for some time. And he had no
[46:02] idea that you could throw this thing
[46:04] down. And listen, let's just think. I'm
[46:06] sure Moses had dropped his rod before.
[46:10] Does anybody imagine that maybe he
[46:11] dropped it or laid it down or I'm sure
[46:15] and nothing ever happened. But this
[46:16] time, God said, "Throw it down." And by
[46:18] the power of God, it turned into a
[46:20] serpent. And Moses fled from it. He was
[46:22] afraid. That means Moses had nothing to
[46:26] do with that rod becoming a serpent.
[46:28] Amen. He was only the hand that carried
[46:30] the rod and dropped it at God's command.
[46:33] Yes, sir. God turned it into a servant.
[46:34] Then he says, "Reach forth thy hand and
[46:36] take it by the tail." And he did. And
[46:38] And I I don't know about you, but that
[46:40] would have been probably the most
[46:41] terrifying moment of my life.
[46:44] He had already run from it. It wasn't
[46:46] like he liked snakes. He wasn't a snake
[46:49] handler or he wouldn't have fled from
[46:50] the face of the serpent.
[46:53] But at God's command, he picked it up
[46:55] and it turned back into a rod. Moses
[46:58] couldn't do that.
[47:00] It took God to do that.
[47:02] And God wanted this sign to be
[47:04] demonstrated to Pharaoh for a sign that
[47:07] God had sent him. But God couldn't get
[47:10] that rod to Egypt without Moses.
[47:14] So this was partnership with God. Moses
[47:17] had to carry it. He could not change it
[47:20] to a ser. So he goes down by the word of
[47:23] God and he did what God told him. And
[47:26] this is what the prophet says. But Moses
[47:28] did just exactly what God told him to
[47:30] do. He threw down the rod and it turned
[47:33] to a serpent. And those soussayers came
[47:35] out and threw down their rods and it
[47:37] turned to a serpent. Moses was at the
[47:39] end of his intelligence and at the end
[47:41] of his strength. But that's where God
[47:44] wants to get us just to the end of our
[47:46] road. And then he steps in. It's just
[47:48] like him. Maybe you're so sick this
[47:50] morning till the doctor says you can't
[47:52] live. Drowning men will reach for a
[47:54] straw. That's the way it is when you try
[47:56] to get uh all that we can work ourselves
[47:59] that's humanly that that will do it. But
[48:03] when it comes to a place where there's
[48:04] no other hope then who doesn't believe
[48:07] in divine healing will believe right
[48:09] away then it's their only hope. And
[48:11] Moses was at the end of his reach. Then
[48:13] God steps in and causes his serpent to
[48:16] eat up the serpents of the other men.
[48:18] Then his serpent was no more. Brother
[48:21] Mam says this in Jehovah Gyra in a
[48:22] prayer. He said, "Lord, if we will do
[48:25] our part, you're able to provide for
[48:28] your part. May it be so, Father." Amen.
[48:31] So, think about this Moses who has all
[48:34] this self-doubt already and all this
[48:36] anxiety about going down and he knows
[48:39] the power and might of Egypt. He knows
[48:41] the reputation of Pharaoh. He knows what
[48:43] he's walking into. He knows his own
[48:44] failure. He knows his own inability. And
[48:47] and God's sending him down, but he gives
[48:49] him these signs. And one of them is the
[48:51] rod. and he tells him to go and do it.
[48:53] And so all he's told is to cast this rod
[48:55] before Pharaoh's assign. He's not told
[48:57] anything else. And when he throws this
[49:00] rod down, it turns into a serpent just
[49:02] like God had showed him before in the
[49:04] wilderness. But the part that Moses
[49:06] wasn't told by God is that there'll be
[49:09] other power that can copy and mimic that
[49:11] power.
[49:13] And the magicians came and threw down
[49:15] their rods and it turned into serpents.
[49:18] And just imagine for a minute you're
[49:21] Moses and you're thinking this is
[49:24] exactly why I didn't want to
[49:29] come because he there's nothing he can
[49:33] do. He is powerless. He is incapable. He
[49:38] is unable.
[49:41] God never told Moses to do anything
[49:44] else. He just told Moses to drop the the
[49:46] the the rod and it'll become a serpent.
[49:49] And he did exactly what God says. And
[49:51] listen, uh when when the other
[49:56] magicians threw down their rods and they
[49:58] become serpents too, Moses was at a
[50:01] complete loss as what to do. Brother Ram
[50:04] tells us so. He said Moses just stepped
[50:07] back and watched. There was nothing he
[50:08] can do. He was completely inable,
[50:11] incapable, had no understanding. He was
[50:13] at the end of his intelligence and his
[50:15] ability. There was nothing he can do.
[50:17] And and and Moses doesn't start saying,
[50:20] "Okay, that was just a joke. I was just
[50:26] because Moses is in partnership with
[50:28] God." Don't forget what a partnership
[50:30] is.
[50:32] A partnership is not I do
[50:35] everything, you do nothing, we split the
[50:38] proceeds 50/50. You do everything. No. A
[50:41] partnership is you have your part to do
[50:43] and I have my part to do. Moses did his
[50:46] part. And when it went beyond Moses's
[50:49] ability, there was nothing else for
[50:51] Moses to do but sit still and be quiet
[50:54] and let his partner work.
[50:59] That's exactly what Moses did. Moses
[51:01] realized, I'm on partnership with God.
[51:03] And now we've be we've gone beyond my
[51:05] part of the contract. Hallelujah.
[51:08] Because I'm here for the natural part.
[51:12] I'm not here for the supernatural part.
[51:15] Listen you, brother Chad. Listen, that's
[51:17] still the truth, friends. You can't make
[51:19] anything supernatural happen of
[51:20] yourself.
[51:22] It takes God. Amen. There's so many
[51:25] things that God wants us to do. Hey,
[51:26] listen. You can put your clothes on and
[51:28] you can come to church on time and you
[51:30] can pray and you can worship and you can
[51:31] hear the word. You can open your Bible
[51:34] and read. You can listen to the message.
[51:36] You could, there's a lot you can do. You
[51:38] can testify. You can share the word.
[51:39] There's a lot you can do. But hey,
[51:41] there's just as much you cannot do.
[51:44] I'll tell you what else. Listen, God
[51:47] can't read the Bible for you.
[51:51] You have to read it.
[51:54] God can't come to church for you. You've
[51:56] got to get in the car and you've got to
[51:57] push on the pedal and you've got to
[51:59] come.
[52:01] Amen. You say, "It's not as though, you
[52:04] know, we we decide to miss a few serves,
[52:06] we get tired and we want to sit home and
[52:08] we don't want to come and whatever, for
[52:09] whatever reason, we decide." Listen, God
[52:12] doesn't just pick you up and carry you
[52:14] and teleport you in and sit you here
[52:16] because there's something you need to
[52:17] hear. No, there's a part you have to do.
[52:20] And if you're going to get the benefit
[52:21] out of what God told us is benefit,
[52:23] you've got to do your part to get the
[52:25] benefit that he promised you would get.
[52:27] Right.
[52:29] God doesn't just do the the natural
[52:30] things that you can do. God expects you
[52:32] to do. He doesn't just do it for you.
[52:35] There's so many times we find ourselves
[52:37] getting into a weakened spiritual
[52:38] condition because we haven't done our
[52:40] part of the contract. We haven't been
[52:43] faithful to our part. Faithful in
[52:45] prayer, faithful in the word. Amen.
[52:48] Faithful to listen, faithful to come,
[52:50] faithful to fellowship. We we've we we
[52:52] become unfaithful in our part of the
[52:54] contract. Then we begin to get weak
[52:56] spiritually and then all of a sudden
[52:57] we're like, "Why isn't God this and why
[52:59] isn't God this and why isn't God doing
[53:01] that?" Listen, you've in contract with
[53:04] God. You're in partnership with God.
[53:05] You've let your let it down your end of
[53:08] the contract and now you want the
[53:10] supernatural part of God to cut kick in
[53:12] and cover all of my mistakes.
[53:15] Listen, we've got to do our part.
[53:18] We still we're still expected to do our
[53:21] part and get the benefit from doing our
[53:23] part. Amen. Amen.
[53:26] Paying ti is our part.
[53:29] God's part is to open the windows of
[53:31] heaven and pour out a blessing we can't
[53:32] contain.
[53:34] But why would God do his part when we
[53:36] haven't done our part?
[53:39] It's simple, right?
[53:42] Simple. So when then when we haven't
[53:45] done our part and the blessing's not
[53:47] coming and financial trouble comes and
[53:49] all a sudden we cry out to God to do his
[53:51] part. Amen. But we haven't done our
[53:54] part.
[53:57] So when Moses has done his
[54:00] part, then Moses can sit back and
[54:05] rest. Because this is beyond Moses's
[54:09] ability. There's a serpent on the
[54:12] ground. I dropped the rod. He never told
[54:14] me what to do if there's two other
[54:16] serpents.
[54:18] Like if he had given him instruction, he
[54:19] would know what to do. But God didn't
[54:20] tell him that part. So if God didn't
[54:22] tell him what to do, then there's
[54:23] nothing for him to do. The problem is
[54:25] when that happens to us, we get nervous.
[54:27] We start making up things to do. Yeah.
[54:31] We start figuring out all kinds of,
[54:32] well, we got to do this and we got to do
[54:34] that and we got to come up with this
[54:35] program and I got to say this and it's
[54:36] up to me to do this and that. Listen, if
[54:38] God hasn't told you what to do, if it's
[54:40] not in the word and you've done all you
[54:42] know to do and you come up against
[54:43] something that's beyond your pay grade,
[54:47] beyond your ability, totally beyond your
[54:51] capability, don't start making things
[54:53] up. Just hold still. Just hold still and
[54:58] and let God do his part. And if there's
[55:02] something he needs you to do, he'll tell
[55:03] you what to do. He always has.
[55:07] go back and read the Bible.
[55:11] Anytime there was something for his
[55:12] children to do, he told them what to do.
[55:14] He didn't expect them to go out and make
[55:16] things up.
[55:19] We don't have to become super
[55:21] spiritual. In fact, don't become super
[55:24] spiritual. You just be as regular and
[55:27] plain as you can possibly be.
[55:33] Sounds counterintuitive, but it's
[55:35] exactly the way it needs to be.
[55:37] Because you start putting spiritual
[55:39] pressure on yourself to be some sort of
[55:41] supernatural super dynamic bride and and
[55:44] and you do it in yourself, right? It's
[55:48] going to cause a lot of problems. Amen.
[55:51] There's a part that God has to do. Where
[55:53] will he do it? He'll do it in you. But
[55:56] it'll be him doing it in you. Wait for
[55:59] him to give the answer. Wait for him to
[56:01] speak. Wait for him to do. Wait for him
[56:03] to say. Brother Brandham did some pretty
[56:06] supernatural things. But which of them
[56:09] did he do of his own thinking, of his
[56:12] own design, of his own
[56:13] desire? He He did what God told him to
[56:16] do. He waited for God to tell him to
[56:18] speak, and when he spoke, it happened.
[56:20] And when God didn't tell him what to do,
[56:22] he learned to not do anything. Amen.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:27] Do you remember how many times did you
[56:28] listen on the prayer line and brother
[56:30] Ben will be standing there and at the
[56:31] end of service he's done preaching. He's
[56:33] calling out so many numbers, maybe 15 or
[56:35] 20 numbers lining up over here and then
[56:37] he just starts telling testimonies and
[56:39] he starts talking and he starts doing
[56:40] all kinds of stuff and and and then in a
[56:43] few places he'll say, "Now you know I'm
[56:45] waiting on something."
[56:47] How many times did he had a prayer line?
[56:49] The angel commissioned him, "You're to
[56:51] take a gift of healing to the peoples of
[56:52] the nations." But brother Brandham knew
[56:54] there was something he could not do all
[56:56] by himself. He could go, he could
[56:58] preach, he could testify, he could call
[57:00] the numbers, he could line them up
[57:02] against the wall,
[57:04] but it was going to take that angel to
[57:06] come, that presence to come before he
[57:08] started praying for people because he
[57:11] was in partnership with God. And he
[57:13] could not, there was things he could not
[57:16] do by himself. Amen. That he needed God
[57:18] to come and do. Amen.
[57:22] It's good for us to be
[57:24] simple. It's good for us to be human.
[57:29] Amen. Are we afraid to be human? God
[57:32] wants to use human beings. Amen. God
[57:35] wants to take regular people that are
[57:37] just like everybody else on the planet
[57:40] and he wants to do supernatural things
[57:42] through them. That's the power of God.
[57:45] He wants to use you and I.
[57:52] This is 1 Corinthians 12. This is the
[57:54] Apostle Paul. He said, "For this thing I
[57:56] besought the Lord thrice that it might
[57:58] depart from me." And he said unto me,
[58:00] "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[58:02] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[58:03] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[58:05] glory in my infirmities that the power
[58:07] of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[58:09] take pleasure in infirmities and
[58:11] reproaches and necessities and
[58:12] persecutions and distresses for Christ's
[58:14] sake. For when I am weak, then am I
[58:18] strong." So Paul learned perfect
[58:20] strength and perfect weakness. Paul had
[58:22] an affliction that was debilitating to
[58:24] him in some ways. But God told him,
[58:26] "Listen, don't worry about that. I've
[58:28] done that for a reason." And as soon as
[58:30] he knew that God had a purpose and he
[58:32] was like, "Praise the Lord. I will now
[58:33] glory in my infirmities. For when I am
[58:35] weak, then I am strong." So God uses
[58:39] even our weaknesses because our
[58:42] weaknesses are a constant reminder of
[58:44] how much we need God. Amen.
[58:51] We'll go back
[58:52] here. When God told Moses to drop that
[58:57] stick, he did. And when the situation
[59:00] got out of hand,
[59:03] it required God came on the scene to fix
[59:05] it because Moses
[59:08] couldn't. When when God told Noah to
[59:12] build an
[59:13] ark, God gave him the blueprint. God
[59:16] gave him the instructions. He went about
[59:18] and he did listen the the ark is
[59:21] partnership with God
[59:24] because God didn't saw any boards.
[59:29] God didn't put any pitch on the board.
[59:32] That was that was Noah and whoever was
[59:34] helping Noah.
[59:36] Noah did what God told him to do. He
[59:38] built it according the fashion God told
[59:40] him to build it. He put everything in
[59:42] it. He put in all the stores and all the
[59:44] goods and all the food for all the
[59:46] animals. Amen. But there was parts that
[59:49] Noah could not
[59:51] do. Noah could build it, but Noah
[59:54] couldn't bring all the animals. He
[59:56] couldn't go out. Noah wasn't out
[59:58] lassoing animals and gathering birds and
[1:00:01] gathering this and gathering that. No,
[1:00:04] he just did exactly what God told him to
[1:00:06] do. And at the appointed time, guess
[1:00:08] what? Animals started showing up to the
[1:00:10] ark.
[1:00:12] That wasn't Noah's part. That was God's
[1:00:14] part. But what's the point of God doing
[1:00:16] his part if there's no ark for him to go
[1:00:18] into?
[1:00:21] If there's no food for them to eat, if
[1:00:24] there's no provision that God told him
[1:00:26] to make, and then in God's appointed
[1:00:28] time, he calls him into the ark. He goes
[1:00:30] into the ark and he slams the door
[1:00:31] closed. Amen. But Noah can't make it
[1:00:34] rain.
[1:00:36] Only God can do that part. Amen. So,
[1:00:39] here is Noah in partnership with God.
[1:00:41] And all he had to do was his part. And
[1:00:45] his part was monumental. I say it was
[1:00:48] huge. But that was his part. And when he
[1:00:51] did his part, God did the rest. Amen.
[1:01:00] We get here to
[1:01:03] Numbers. And in the book of
[1:01:06] numbers, it shows where Aaron and Miriam
[1:01:10] start speaking against
[1:01:13] Moses. And
[1:01:15] God God cha chasens them. He chastised
[1:01:18] them for speaking against Moses because
[1:01:20] he had taken an Ethiopian wife. And they
[1:01:22] begin to ridicule him. And they begin to
[1:01:24] say, "Aren't we, you know, gifted like
[1:01:26] you? Aren't we in the same spot you
[1:01:28] are?" And and listen, verse three says,
[1:01:30] "Now the man Moses was very meek above
[1:01:33] all the men which were upon the face of
[1:01:35] the earth." That's the kind of man that
[1:01:37] God wanted to bring deliverance out of
[1:01:40] Egypt. But he didn't defend himself. He
[1:01:43] didn't when he was when he was uh
[1:01:46] accused and when whatever they said
[1:01:48] against him, God now comes on the scene
[1:01:51] and the rest of this chapter, he comes
[1:01:52] on the scene and he begins to correct
[1:01:54] Aaron and Miriam and says, "Listen, I
[1:01:56] I've sent prophets and they see visions
[1:01:58] and dreams, but I speak Moses face to
[1:02:00] face and how dare you speak against my
[1:02:03] servant." Amen.
[1:02:06] It's in this passage. I'm not going to
[1:02:08] read all of it. I'm just going to throw
[1:02:08] it up there so you can jot the numbers
[1:02:10] down.
[1:02:11] He says in verse 8, with him will I
[1:02:14] speak mouthto mouth even apparently and
[1:02:16] not in dark speeches in the similitude
[1:02:18] of the Lord shall he beho be behold.
[1:02:20] Therefore wi then were you not afraid to
[1:02:23] speak against my servant Moses and the
[1:02:25] anger of the Lord was kindled against
[1:02:26] them and he
[1:02:28] departed. This is the same man who God
[1:02:31] was angry at. Right? The same one who
[1:02:35] the wrath of God was kindled against
[1:02:37] Moses. God was angry at Moses. Now Moses
[1:02:40] goes to do the job God called him to do.
[1:02:43] Now when other people are rebuking him
[1:02:45] and other people are against him, now he
[1:02:48] stands up for Moses and he says, "How
[1:02:50] dare you speak against my servant?"
[1:02:53] Amen. This is the same one that he that
[1:02:56] that he was in this conversation with
[1:02:58] and he was frustrated with. Hey, listen.
[1:03:00] This is God's partner.
[1:03:04] Amen. And he was requiring that re that
[1:03:07] they respected his partner.
[1:03:12] This is really important because when I
[1:03:15] picked the title, I picked respecting
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] vessel. And when we look at this, this
[1:03:20] is going to go two ways. The vessel that
[1:03:23] God chooses to work through is his
[1:03:25] choice.
[1:03:27] It's his choice. And we need to respect
[1:03:30] that vessel. Yes.
[1:03:33] And that means that when God chooses us,
[1:03:37] we have to have respect for his choice.
[1:03:41] That's a hard one for us because nobody
[1:03:44] wants to be conceited and and all that,
[1:03:46] but that's not what we're talking about.
[1:03:47] We're talking about simply respecting
[1:03:49] God's choice. God, if that's what you
[1:03:51] want, then here I am. And having enough
[1:03:54] respect for God that this vessel becomes
[1:03:57] his. And it matters where we go, what we
[1:04:01] do, what we say, how we present
[1:04:03] ourselves to the world because now we're
[1:04:05] in partnership with God. And God wants
[1:04:07] to use this vessel. And we have to
[1:04:09] respect God's choice. So we have to
[1:04:11] respect it when it's us, but we have to
[1:04:13] respect it when it's our brother and
[1:04:14] sister,
[1:04:16] too. That's what I want to finish
[1:04:18] talking about with God and partnership
[1:04:19] with man, that we respect God's
[1:04:24] choice regardless of what we see. Amen.
[1:04:27] what they saw was probably something
[1:04:30] worth
[1:04:31] criticizing. He had an Ethiopian wife,
[1:04:34] but he was God's servant. God would take
[1:04:37] care of correcting that.
[1:04:39] Amen. God says, "Why have you talked
[1:04:42] about my servant? Why have you come
[1:04:43] against my servant?" God now took
[1:04:45] offense because this is the vessel God
[1:04:47] was
[1:04:50] using. This is what Jude says. says Jude
[1:04:53] 1:8, "Likewise also these filthy
[1:04:55] dreamers defile the flesh, despise
[1:04:57] dominion, speak evil of dignities. Yet
[1:05:00] Michael the archangel, when contending
[1:05:01] with the devil, he disputed about the
[1:05:04] body of Moses, dur not bring against him
[1:05:06] a railing accusation, but said, "The
[1:05:08] Lord rebuke thee." I want you to watch
[1:05:11] this attitude, and let's be really
[1:05:12] careful now as we move forward.
[1:05:15] Even he he's speaking now of people uh
[1:05:19] uh of people in the church and dreamers
[1:05:21] and the file of the flesh despise
[1:05:23] dominion. That means people have
[1:05:24] rulership speak evil of dignities.
[1:05:26] That's those who are esteemed in honor.
[1:05:28] But he says, listen to this. Yet Michael
[1:05:30] the archangel when contending with the
[1:05:33] devil and disputed about the body of
[1:05:35] Moses dur not bring against him a
[1:05:37] railing accusation but said the Lord
[1:05:39] rebuke you. Even Michael when facing off
[1:05:44] with the
[1:05:45] devil was careful how he spoke to him
[1:05:49] and spoke about him.
[1:05:52] I think this is a good lesson for all of
[1:05:54] us.
[1:05:57] Because he uh Jude is showing us that
[1:06:01] these people speak evil of everything
[1:06:03] and the dignitaries and governments and
[1:06:05] they don't even know what they're
[1:06:06] talking about. But even Michael the
[1:06:08] archangel when disputing with the devil,
[1:06:10] he never took that attitude. That's
[1:06:12] right. Jesus never took that attitude.
[1:06:15] Paul never took that attitude. You never
[1:06:18] hear Jesus speak to Judas that in an
[1:06:21] evil way, making a railing accusation.
[1:06:23] And you never hear the rest of the
[1:06:24] disciples say anything bad about him
[1:06:27] after the fact. Amen. That's right. They
[1:06:29] just leave it alone. Judas served his
[1:06:31] purpose. Right.
[1:06:34] So it's an attitude that we have to be
[1:06:36] careful that we have. Second Peter
[1:06:38] refers to something very similar. Second
[1:06:40] Peter 2:10. But chiefly them that walk
[1:06:43] after the flesh in the lust of
[1:06:44] uncleanness and despise government.
[1:06:47] Presumptuous are they self-will. They
[1:06:49] are not afraid to speak evil of
[1:06:51] dignities. Whereas angels which are
[1:06:53] greater in power and might bring not
[1:06:55] railing accusation against them before
[1:06:57] the Lord. But these as natural brute
[1:07:00] beasts made to be taken and destroyed
[1:07:02] speak evil of the things that they
[1:07:03] understand not and shall utterly perish
[1:07:06] in their own corruption. Amen.
[1:07:11] This the point I want to get
[1:07:13] to. Whatever vessel God has chose to
[1:07:16] work
[1:07:17] through, be very careful how you speak
[1:07:19] about it. Amen. Very, very careful how
[1:07:24] you speak about it.
[1:07:27] Even Even Michael is careful how he
[1:07:30] speaks to his
[1:07:32] enemy. We should keep our words
[1:07:34] courteous at all times at all times and
[1:07:38] let God deal with things,
[1:07:41] not us. There's another part of the
[1:07:45] contract and sometimes it's not our duty
[1:07:48] to deal with that. God will deal with
[1:07:50] that. That's what Michael said. Michael
[1:07:53] said, "I'm I'm come down to get the body
[1:07:54] of
[1:07:55] Moses. You're contesting me. The Lord
[1:07:58] rebuke you, not me, because I'm only
[1:08:02] here to get the body of
[1:08:05] Moses." Let's look at this in in Acts
[1:08:09] 23. But Paul says, "Then said Paul unto
[1:08:12] him, God shall smite thee, thou wited
[1:08:14] wall." He's speaking to the high priest.
[1:08:17] God shall smite thee, thou wited wall,
[1:08:19] for sitest thou to judge me after the
[1:08:21] law, and commanded me to be smitten
[1:08:23] contrary to the law. He told the soldier
[1:08:25] next to him to smite him, and he struck
[1:08:26] him across the
[1:08:28] mouth. And he and he told him, you're
[1:08:30] off the word, basically your whited
[1:08:33] wall. In verse four, and they that stood
[1:08:35] by said, revilest thou God's high
[1:08:38] priest? Then said Paul, I wis not,
[1:08:41] brethren, that he was the high priest,
[1:08:43] for it is written, thou shalt not speak
[1:08:45] evil of the ruler of thy people. Paul
[1:08:48] all of a sudden corrects himself. It
[1:08:51] doesn't mean the high priest is right.
[1:08:53] He's wrong. But because God told him to
[1:08:57] honor authorities, he now realized, I've
[1:09:00] got to honor this authority. And not
[1:09:02] just religious authorities, but all
[1:09:04] authorities. Amen.
[1:09:06] You never see Jesus railing against
[1:09:09] Herod, railing against Pilate, railing
[1:09:11] against Caesar, railing against the
[1:09:13] government. He never does.
[1:09:16] He speaks
[1:09:19] courteously. Look at
[1:09:21] what Jesus said in Matthew 18:10. Take
[1:09:24] heed that you despise not one of these
[1:09:26] little ones. For I say unto you that in
[1:09:29] heaven their angels do always behold the
[1:09:31] face of my father which is in heaven.
[1:09:34] And brother Bram says this, "God may
[1:09:38] send many angels. All of us has guardian
[1:09:40] angels, the children of God." Jesus
[1:09:42] said, "Take heed that you despise not
[1:09:44] these little ones, for their angels
[1:09:45] always beholds my father's face which is
[1:09:47] in heaven." That true. Be careful what
[1:09:50] you do against Christians. Better to be
[1:09:52] drowned in the sea with a rock around
[1:09:54] your neck than to bring an even even
[1:09:56] offense to one of them. Be
[1:09:59] careful. I'll say it this way. Be
[1:10:01] careful what you do or say or how you
[1:10:04] treat the family of God even when
[1:10:06] they're wrong.
[1:10:08] Amen. Because they're still God's
[1:10:10] children. That's right. Be
[1:10:12] careful. Brother Bam says in message
[1:10:15] respects, he said, "Did not Jesus say in
[1:10:17] so much as you have done it unto the
[1:10:18] least of these, my little ones, you have
[1:10:20] done it unto me. And it would be better
[1:10:22] for you that a millstone was hanged at
[1:10:24] your neck and you were drowned in the
[1:10:25] depths of the sea than to offend one of
[1:10:27] them. For I say unto you, behold, there
[1:10:30] are angels always behold my father's
[1:10:32] face which is in heaven. Now we know
[1:10:33] that they are that we being children of
[1:10:35] God, that we are part of God, and God
[1:10:38] demands his
[1:10:40] respects. God wants respect. I was I was
[1:10:44] thinking of a story. Many of you will
[1:10:46] remember this story and and I was trying
[1:10:48] to place it today and I can't remember
[1:10:50] exactly where I heard it, but I'm I'm
[1:10:53] almost positive it's Billy Paul's
[1:10:54] testimony. And brother Billy Paul was
[1:10:57] sharing a testimony of a time that he
[1:10:59] and his dad, they were in his home and
[1:11:01] they were they were talking over
[1:11:02] something. They were working out some
[1:11:04] arrangements. And Billy Paul's little
[1:11:06] boy that was just in a diaper at the
[1:11:08] time, just a toddler, kept running
[1:11:10] through and interrupting and and Billy
[1:11:11] Paul had told him to quit a couple of
[1:11:13] times. And this little boy run through
[1:11:15] and he interrupted again. And Billy Paul
[1:11:17] just ripped over and wapped him on the
[1:11:19] backside. Not anything serious. Just
[1:11:21] whapped him on the backside. He had a
[1:11:23] diaper on, I think it was. wapping him
[1:11:24] on the diaper and and and it wasn't
[1:11:26] serious, but the boy run off and he was
[1:11:28] heartbroken and he cried. And brother
[1:11:30] Brandham looked at Billy Paul and says,
[1:11:31] "His angel didn't like that.
[1:11:34] His angel didn't like that." Not that
[1:11:37] it's wrong to spank a child. Not that
[1:11:40] it's wrong to chasen children and being
[1:11:42] disciplined. That's our responsibility.
[1:11:45] But it's even the
[1:11:47] child has to be respected in a certain
[1:11:50] way. Amen.
[1:11:53] Even the child when he's disrespected in
[1:11:57] a certain way and his little spirit was
[1:11:59] damaged in a certain way, even that
[1:12:01] child's angel didn't like
[1:12:04] that. And if that's true for a toddler
[1:12:07] who's interrupting his dad and
[1:12:09] grandpa, what about for everybody else?
[1:12:15] Men, we need to be careful how we handle
[1:12:18] dignities.
[1:12:21] Because when we say that word dignities,
[1:12:22] we think of like presidents and
[1:12:25] government officials. That's really not
[1:12:27] what it is in the Bible. Dignities in
[1:12:29] the Bible are anybody that has glory or
[1:12:33] honor. And that really is the children
[1:12:35] of God, the family of God. I say it this
[1:12:38] way. Do we believe God's working in a
[1:12:41] many membered body?
[1:12:43] Do you believe you're part of that?
[1:12:44] Raise your hand if you think you're part
[1:12:45] of that many membered body.
[1:12:48] That means God is in partnership with
[1:12:50] you and God is using you to finish his
[1:12:52] purpose on this earth. And so I've got
[1:12:54] to be careful with the way I handle you.
[1:12:57] You got to be careful with the way you
[1:12:59] handle me. That we have to respect and
[1:13:02] honor God's choice and vessels. That
[1:13:05] even when we're wrong, we got to be
[1:13:08] careful how we handle each other.
[1:13:11] It doesn't do good to criticize and to
[1:13:13] condemn and to gossip and speak evil of
[1:13:16] one another because God has ears.
[1:13:20] God has ears and he cares about the way
[1:13:22] we treat one another because God's the
[1:13:25] one who chose each one of us for his
[1:13:27] purpose. And so when I when I looked at
[1:13:30] that story, I remembered and reflected
[1:13:32] back on that story uh of Billy Paul and
[1:13:36] that little I mean he was just a father
[1:13:38] being a father and he was a little bit
[1:13:39] frustrated because he already corrected
[1:13:41] the boy and it's not that he shouldn't
[1:13:43] have corrected him but he should have
[1:13:44] taken him aside and spoke to him and
[1:13:45] treated him with respect not done it in
[1:13:47] front of everybody and taken him to a
[1:13:49] side and given him a proper chastisement
[1:13:51] if it was due chastisement and then
[1:13:53] comforted the child and and restored him
[1:13:55] back to but not just ripped over and
[1:13:56] whapped him in front of everybody. body
[1:13:58] and and hurt his little dignity and and
[1:14:00] hurt his feelings. And
[1:14:03] do we understand?
[1:14:06] His angel didn't like that.
[1:14:09] And then it makes me think, how many
[1:14:10] times have I said and done things that
[1:14:13] the angels didn't like?
[1:14:17] my own family and my own home to my own
[1:14:20] children, my own spouse with my brothers
[1:14:22] and sisters in fellowships and
[1:14:26] and I say, God,
[1:14:28] help me to realize that you're working
[1:14:31] through all of these
[1:14:32] vessels that this is you. When Paul was
[1:14:36] grabbing them and hauling them to
[1:14:38] prison, Jesus come in a pillar of fire
[1:14:40] and say, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
[1:14:45] He said, who are you, Lord? He said, "I
[1:14:46] am Jesus whom you persecute." And he
[1:14:49] wasn't touching Jesus. He was touching
[1:14:50] the body that Jesus was now dwelling in,
[1:14:53] which was the believers. And all of a
[1:14:56] sudden, I realize, God, help me.
[1:15:00] God help me. You say, "Well, I I would I
[1:15:05] wouldn't be like Miriam and Aaron. I
[1:15:08] would never say anything against brother
[1:15:10] Brandham. I never correct him. I never
[1:15:11] condemn him." Do you think Brother Ram
[1:15:14] care? Do you think God cares more about
[1:15:15] Brother Brendon than he does the person
[1:15:16] sitting next to you in the pews? Brother
[1:15:19] Brenham has a higher office. Absolutely.
[1:15:21] He has more authority and more
[1:15:22] responsibility and God honors and
[1:15:24] protects that authority. But you think
[1:15:26] that's more precious
[1:15:28] than the vessel next to us?
[1:15:31] Say, "Oh God, help us to respect the
[1:15:34] vessels that you've chose. Help us to
[1:15:36] speak courteously even in correction,
[1:15:38] even in disagreement. We won't always
[1:15:41] get along and there's always need for
[1:15:42] correction." But brother Ben Brandon
[1:15:44] said, "If you can't go and correct
[1:15:45] somebody and then put your arm around
[1:15:47] them and love them, then you shouldn't
[1:15:49] be correcting them." Because if you want
[1:15:51] to do it and you like doing it, then
[1:15:53] you're probably not the one who should
[1:15:54] do it. If you can't wait to do it, then
[1:15:57] you're not the one to bring a
[1:15:58] correction. Just let somebody else do
[1:15:59] that. If you're eager for it, looking
[1:16:02] forward to it, and you can't wait to
[1:16:03] give them a piece of your mind, and
[1:16:05] you're analyzing all the things that
[1:16:06] you'll say when you just get the
[1:16:07] opportunity to say it, you probably
[1:16:09] shouldn't be the one to say it.
[1:16:13] But if you go in love and your heart's
[1:16:14] burdened for the brother and you've got
[1:16:16] to say something to them, you think
[1:16:17] they're going the wrong way and it just
[1:16:19] kills you to say it and you and and you
[1:16:21] hope they take it the right way and you
[1:16:22] want to restore fellowship and you want
[1:16:24] love, then maybe you're the one who
[1:16:26] should be the one to bring correction.
[1:16:29] If you can res honor them as your
[1:16:31] brother and sister and a child of
[1:16:33] God, and I don't think this applies only
[1:16:36] to children of God. I think it applies
[1:16:37] to humanity in general
[1:16:41] because life is a precious thing to God
[1:16:43] and if he created a soul and he gave
[1:16:45] life then we should treat that life with
[1:16:47] respect
[1:16:49] much more so the household and family of
[1:16:51] God but all humanity and God in the
[1:16:53] Bible in the law even cares about how
[1:16:56] you treat your beast.
[1:16:58] Has anybody read the Bible?
[1:17:01] God even cares how you treat your
[1:17:03] livestock and your animals and your
[1:17:05] beast. And if he cares if and if he gave
[1:17:07] laws on on requiring that you properly
[1:17:10] treat your beast, how about another
[1:17:12] human being? Right?
[1:17:15] We need to have
[1:17:16] respect. Respect for human beings.
[1:17:19] Respect for everything God made.
[1:17:23] I was thinking about that today and you
[1:17:24] think, well, can I kill a spider?
[1:17:29] And it's funny because in the back
[1:17:30] before I came out, I killed a spider. I
[1:17:33] have a confession to make.
[1:17:35] But brother Brandham did say spiders and
[1:17:37] snakes and things like that are just
[1:17:39] representation of evil spirits. So
[1:17:40] praise
[1:17:42] God. But I don't think it means that.
[1:17:44] Brother Brenham was a hunter and and
[1:17:46] there there was sometimes there was life
[1:17:48] that was taken. There's things that have
[1:17:49] to be destroyed because the world is
[1:17:51] perverted and corrupt and things have
[1:17:53] changed their purpose and things carry
[1:17:55] diseases and I you know you know
[1:17:57] understand what I'm saying. But even
[1:17:58] though we have to destroy a life, amen,
[1:18:01] we don't do it cruy. We don't do it uh
[1:18:04] sadistically. We don't take like little
[1:18:06] boys do and take spiders and pluck one
[1:18:08] leg off at a time and see them grow.
[1:18:09] That I don't think God likes that.
[1:18:14] I don't think that's the nature of God.
[1:18:16] I think brother Bam said, "I hunt." And
[1:18:18] he said, "I'm not a killer. I'm a hunter
[1:18:19] and I want to make a clean kill so that
[1:18:21] it dies ethically and dies quickly."
[1:18:24] So life has to be taken. Kill spiders,
[1:18:28] brothers. Do it for your wife. Be the
[1:18:30] hero, but don't torture
[1:18:33] him. It's funny, but you see what I'm
[1:18:35] You see the point?
[1:18:38] Respect. We need to have respect.
[1:18:41] Respect for God, respect for humanity,
[1:18:44] and especially respect for one another.
[1:18:47] God has chosen, my brothers and my
[1:18:49] sisters. He's got a many membered body,
[1:18:52] and he cares how that body is treated.
[1:18:56] Have you ever read Matthew 25? you the
[1:18:59] story of the white throne judgment.
[1:19:01] There's a whole host of people out
[1:19:03] before God and God looks at one group
[1:19:06] and says, "Because you visited me when I
[1:19:10] was in prison, because you clothed me
[1:19:11] when I was naked, you fed me when I was
[1:19:13] hungry, enter you into the joys of the
[1:19:16] Lord prepared before the foundation of
[1:19:17] the world." They said, "Lord, when did
[1:19:19] we feed you, clothe you, visit you?" He
[1:19:23] said, "When you done it to the least of
[1:19:24] these, mine brethren." Who's he talking
[1:19:26] about? He's talking about his elect
[1:19:28] seed, the bride that sitted with him on
[1:19:29] the throne.
[1:19:31] And they're they enter into eternal life
[1:19:34] because of how they treated God in
[1:19:37] flesh.
[1:19:40] Amen. I think God cares about how his
[1:19:42] vessels are treated.
[1:19:46] There's another group. He says, "When I
[1:19:48] was hungry, you didn't feed me. When I
[1:19:51] was naked, you didn't clothe me. When I
[1:19:53] was in prison, you didn't visit me.
[1:19:55] Depart from me.
[1:19:57] And they said, 'Lord, when did we see
[1:19:59] you hunger and not feed?' He said, 'When
[1:20:01] when when you didn't do it to the least
[1:20:03] of these, my brother, you didn't do it
[1:20:04] to
[1:20:05] me. And there's those who miss out on
[1:20:09] eternity and those who enter into
[1:20:11] eternity because of the way they treated
[1:20:14] the word in an earthn vessel.
[1:20:21] It matters.
[1:20:23] It matters.
[1:20:26] 1 Corinthians 12:20 says, "But now are
[1:20:30] they many members, but yet but one body,
[1:20:33] and the eye cannot say unto the hand, I
[1:20:35] have no need of thee, nor again the head
[1:20:37] to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay,
[1:20:39] much more those members of the body
[1:20:40] which seem to be more feeble or
[1:20:42] necessary. And those members of the body
[1:20:44] which we think to be less honorable,
[1:20:46] upon these we bestow more abundant
[1:20:48] honor, and our uncumbly parts have more
[1:20:51] abundant comeliness. For our comely
[1:20:53] parts have no need. But God hath
[1:20:54] tempered the body together, having given
[1:20:57] more abundant honor to the part which
[1:20:59] lack lack. That there should be no
[1:21:01] schism in the body, but that the member
[1:21:03] should have the same care one for
[1:21:05] another. And whether one member suffer,
[1:21:07] all the members suffer with it. Or one
[1:21:09] member be honored, all members rejoice
[1:21:11] with it. Now you are the body of Christ
[1:21:14] and members in particular.
[1:21:17] God has set this whole whole
[1:21:21] scene so that he can work in a many
[1:21:24] membered
[1:21:25] body and we are interdependent upon one
[1:21:28] another and interconnected to one
[1:21:30] another and cannot escape it and should
[1:21:33] not desire to escape
[1:21:35] it. And God, you know, God has given
[1:21:39] different gifts in different places and
[1:21:41] different positions to different ones to
[1:21:43] the benefit of the whole.
[1:21:46] So that my gifts are not for me. My
[1:21:47] gifts are for you. And your gifts are
[1:21:49] not for you. Your gifts are for me. So
[1:21:51] that I'm in a position where there's
[1:21:54] something that I'm lacking that I can
[1:21:57] only get from somewhere else in the body
[1:21:59] of Christ. And God designed it that way
[1:22:02] so that we'd be interdependent on one
[1:22:04] another. Remember God, the fullness of
[1:22:08] the Godhead was in Christ. Christ had
[1:22:11] everything in him. He was independent.
[1:22:13] He was God in flesh. And the fullness of
[1:22:16] the Godhead dwelt in him and he was the
[1:22:18] manifestation of the fullness of God
[1:22:19] poured into him. But on the day of
[1:22:21] Pentecost, that pillar of fire broke up
[1:22:23] in the elix of fire and he poured
[1:22:24] himself into a many membered body. No
[1:22:27] longer will there be
[1:22:29] independence. No longer. Now there's
[1:22:32] going to be a many membered body that is
[1:22:34] interdependent upon one another. So
[1:22:36] there's no room for disrespecting any
[1:22:38] other part of the body. You need that
[1:22:40] part. I need that part. We need one
[1:22:42] another. And God said it this way so
[1:22:45] that you don't have everything you need.
[1:22:51] You don't have everything you need.
[1:22:53] That's right. Remember the spirit divide
[1:22:55] severely as he will the gifts to one a
[1:22:58] gift of faith to another knowledge to
[1:23:00] one wisdom to another working of
[1:23:02] miracles to this to that one in tongues
[1:23:05] and one interpretation one prophecies
[1:23:08] helps and governments and all these
[1:23:10] other and he's divided it up
[1:23:14] so that nobody's a one-man band.
[1:23:17] There's no such thing as a one-man band.
[1:23:19] It's we are all interdependent on one
[1:23:22] another. We cannot make it without the
[1:23:24] body of
[1:23:25] Christ. We have to have one another. And
[1:23:28] God designed it to where you lack.
[1:23:32] Without the rest of the body, you can't
[1:23:35] make it. Amen. That's a
[1:23:38] weakness. But oh, let's glory in our
[1:23:41] infirmities
[1:23:42] because I I have areas in my life that
[1:23:45] I'm completely weak and I'm incapable.
[1:23:47] There's things I cannot do. I need the
[1:23:49] rest of the body. I need your gift. I
[1:23:52] need you. I need whatever God's put in
[1:23:55] you, I need because he's put things in
[1:23:56] you that he hasn't put in me. And he's
[1:23:59] working things in you that he hasn't put
[1:24:00] in me. And there's nobody that can
[1:24:03] operate independent
[1:24:05] of the body. And
[1:24:08] that is a designed weakness by God.
[1:24:15] God designed it that way so that you can
[1:24:18] never go solo.
[1:24:21] Amen.
[1:24:23] So that you're interdependent upon the
[1:24:25] body of Christ.
[1:24:28] Amen. God is so good
[1:24:30] friends because God wants to be manifest
[1:24:33] in a many membered body and he made it
[1:24:36] so we have to rely on each other. Amen.
[1:24:40] And we have to respect one another and
[1:24:43] we have to honor one another because
[1:24:45] that's God's choice.
[1:24:48] Praise God.
[1:24:50] the message expectation. He says, "Now
[1:24:53] God is willing if we are willing. But we
[1:24:55] have our part to play. Each individual
[1:24:57] has a part to play. I can no more make a
[1:25:00] revival out of it or a meeting than
[1:25:01] nothing. And no one individual or no
[1:25:04] just two or three of you. It'll take all
[1:25:06] of us together working together through
[1:25:09] the Lord Jesus Christ to see something
[1:25:11] accomplished here in this city while
[1:25:13] we're gathered together for the kingdom
[1:25:14] of God's sake. Man, the same thing's
[1:25:17] true right here tonight. It's never
[1:25:19] going to happen by one person doing all
[1:25:22] the work. It's going to be all of us
[1:25:25] together for the working for the kingdom
[1:25:27] of God. Brother Bam was going into a
[1:25:30] city to have a prayer meeting and
[1:25:31] revival. He said, "I can't make a
[1:25:33] revival happen myself. It's not and not
[1:25:35] just two or three people can do it. It's
[1:25:37] going to take all of us together to
[1:25:38] accomplish something in the city." There
[1:25:40] was an
[1:25:41] interdependency and that's what God
[1:25:43] wants.
[1:25:46] Ephesians 4:15, "But speaking the truth
[1:25:49] in love, may grow up unto him in all
[1:25:51] things, which is the head, even Christ,
[1:25:53] from whom the whole body, fitly joined
[1:25:56] together, and compacted by that which
[1:25:58] every joint supplies, according to the
[1:26:00] effectual working in the measure of
[1:26:02] every part, making increase of the body
[1:26:04] unto the edifying of itself in love."
[1:26:07] Amen. That is God's design. Amen. God
[1:26:12] wants us to grow up
[1:26:16] together. He wants us to need one
[1:26:19] another. He wants us to depend on one
[1:26:21] another. He wants He He put in us a
[1:26:26] weakness. We talked earlier about the
[1:26:28] weakness that makes us dependent on
[1:26:31] God. But God put a weakness in us that
[1:26:34] makes us dependent on one another.
[1:26:37] So that I'm dependent on the God working
[1:26:40] in
[1:26:40] you and you're dependent on the God
[1:26:43] working in me. Amen. And that's the way
[1:26:45] God wanted it. Praise the Lord. So I
[1:26:48] just want to say I love you. Amen. I
[1:26:50] love every one of you and I thank God
[1:26:52] for you. Amen. Let's all stand together.
[1:26:54] Amen.
[1:27:06] Amen. I think God wants us to love what
[1:27:08] he loves and respect what he respects
[1:27:12] and honor what he uses. And I think if
[1:27:14] we can do that, Amen, we'll bring honor
[1:27:16] and glory to God and we'll be blessed
[1:27:18] because of it. So God is in partnership
[1:27:21] with man. We've been looking for the
[1:27:22] last two services about God in
[1:27:24] partnership with man, me. But now I'm
[1:27:27] looking at God in partnership with man
[1:27:29] and you. And I'm respecting that and I'm
[1:27:32] learning to treat it with respect and
[1:27:34] honor and the glory it deserves so that
[1:27:37] I can get everything that God has for
[1:27:39] me. Musicians, if you want to come
[1:27:41] forward and brother John, let's bow our
[1:27:42] heads together and pray.
[1:27:45] Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord
[1:27:47] Jesus for the wisdom that you've placed
[1:27:49] in your word for the truth Lord that
[1:27:52] you're trying to get to us. God, we know
[1:27:55] that we cannot do anything on our own.
[1:28:00] We need you Lord. We know God that you
[1:28:04] have to be the force behind. You have to
[1:28:06] provide the spirit and power. And God
[1:28:09] that you want to work in man. You want
[1:28:11] to work in flesh. You want to work in
[1:28:13] our flesh.
[1:28:14] and we want to surrender to you and we
[1:28:16] want to come into that contractual
[1:28:18] agreement, Lord, that you desire where
[1:28:20] we do our part and you promise to do
[1:28:22] your part. And we're so thankful, God,
[1:28:25] that you you're always faithful to do
[1:28:27] your part. You never fail. You have
[1:28:30] never failed to keep your word. You are
[1:28:32] always there to do what you promise to
[1:28:34] do. And God, we want help to be more
[1:28:37] faithful. Lord, I want to do my part no
[1:28:39] matter how simple it is. Lord, how
[1:28:42] natural it seems. I want to do my part,
[1:28:44] Lord. I want to be faithful back to you.
[1:28:48] But God, it's not just in myself that
[1:28:51] I'm dependent, Lord, but I I'm dependent
[1:28:53] on my brothers and sisters. And God, and
[1:28:56] I want it to be that way because that's
[1:28:58] the way you designed it, Lord. And open
[1:29:00] my eyes to see how much I need this
[1:29:03] family of God. How interdependent we are
[1:29:06] upon one another. And help us, God, to
[1:29:09] treat one another with greater respect
[1:29:11] and more honor. Help us to season our
[1:29:14] words and to speak sweetly of one
[1:29:16] another. And Lord, even when things have
[1:29:18] to be corrected, help us to be very
[1:29:20] careful in the way we deal with one
[1:29:22] another. Lord, forgive us, Lord, for
[1:29:25] being brash. Forgive us for being
[1:29:27] critical. Forgive us for the harsh
[1:29:30] things that we've said. For Lord, we're
[1:29:32] everyone
[1:29:33] guilty. Guilty of speaking too
[1:29:36] quickly. Guilty of speaking too
[1:29:39] harshly. guilty of condemning your
[1:29:42] children and saying cruel things,
[1:29:45] Lord. But oh God, help us to take the
[1:29:48] attitude of
[1:29:50] Michael. Help us to take a different
[1:29:52] attitude, a different approach,
[1:29:54] Lord. For now, I just want to respect
[1:29:58] you. Respect your children. Respect your
[1:30:01] choice. And be careful, Lord, the way we
[1:30:04] handle one another. God, give us eyes to
[1:30:07] see and our heart to perceive all that
[1:30:09] you've opened before us, Lord. And may
[1:30:11] we be careful with one another and love
[1:30:14] one another the way you desire us to
[1:30:16] love one another. May we say nice things
[1:30:18] about one another. May we cover for one
[1:30:21] another's mistakes and not expose them.
[1:30:23] Lord, may we help one another in our
[1:30:25] times of need. May we be there for
[1:30:27] support and love and encouragement and
[1:30:29] strength. God, make us a body. Make us
[1:30:33] one, not just here locally, but
[1:30:35] globally, Lord. Make us one body in you
[1:30:38] under your headship, Lord. And may we
[1:30:40] all find our position and do our part
[1:30:42] and give back all that we can and
[1:30:44] receive all that we can. And God, may
[1:30:47] you be glorified and honored in it all.
[1:30:50] And may we respect what you respect. May
[1:30:54] we respect what you choose. We love you,
[1:30:56] God. Bless your children. May we go from
[1:30:59] here, Lord, with greater wisdom than we
[1:31:01] had before and with greater direction
[1:31:03] and clearer vision. We ask that you
[1:31:06] would help us and bless us as we honor
[1:31:07] your word. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:31:10] pray.
[1:31:12] Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother John.
[1:31:16] A
[1:31:16] vessel of
[1:31:19] honor for God.
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:25] of that
[1:31:27] soul of
[1:31:30] honor for
[1:31:35] God.
[1:31:38] Sanctified,
[1:31:40] holy so I might
[1:31:45] be a
[1:31:48] vessel of
[1:31:51] honor for God.
[1:31:56] of that
[1:31:58] soul of
[1:32:01] honor for God.
[1:32:06] Oh, a
[1:32:08] vessel of

[1:40:54] me. One day I'll
[1:40:57] reach sweet heaven shore.

[1:41:45] much to
