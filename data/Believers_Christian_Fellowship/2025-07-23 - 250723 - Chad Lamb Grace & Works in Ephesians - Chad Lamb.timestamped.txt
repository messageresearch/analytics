[0:08] Well, they're holding up this ladder
[0:11] that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up
[0:16] the ladder and I'm going home at the top
[0:20] of this ladder. Oh, what joy there will
[0:24] be. And the angels are holding up this
[0:28] ladder for me.
[0:32] Well, as I climb this gospel ladder,
[0:35] always heeding every sign. And I know my
[0:39] Savior's with me and he's teaching me to
[0:42] climb. Every day that I am climbing,
[0:46] there's a battle for me. Every step on
[0:50] this ladder is another victory.
[0:55] Well, they're holding up this ladder
[0:58] that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up
[1:02] this ladder and I'm going home at the
[1:06] top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there
[1:10] will be. And the angels are holding up
[1:14] this ladder for me.
[1:18] There's a mansion being built for me
[1:21] somewhere in glory land. And this ladder
[1:25] that I'm climbing is a part of the plan.
[1:29] I can hear the angels backing. Keep
[1:32] climbing. Don't stop. There's a crowd of
[1:35] life awaiting you when you reach the
[1:39] top.
[1:41] Where they're holding up this ladder
[1:43] that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up
[1:48] this ladder and I'm going home at the
[1:52] top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there
[1:56] will be. And the angels are holding up
[2:00] this ladder for me.
[2:04] Come on, you Christian soldiers. Show
[2:06] this world your light can shine. Get on
[2:09] board this gospel ladder and don't be
[2:13] afraid to climb. Can't you hear the
[2:15] angels cheering? Soon the battle will be
[2:19] over. And we'll celebrate this victory
[2:22] when we reach the other shore.
[2:26] We holding up this ladder that I'm
[2:30] climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder
[2:34] and I'm going home at the top of this
[2:39] ladder. What joy there will be. And the
[2:43] angels are holding up this ladder for
[2:47] me.
[2:48] Well, they're holding up this ladder
[2:51] that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up
[2:56] this ladder. And I'm going home at the
[3:00] top of this ladder. Oh, what joy there
[3:04] will be. And the angels are holding up
[3:08] this love for me.
[3:12] Let's go to E flat.
[3:14] Well, I'm a pilgrim and a stranger.
[3:19] I'm wandering through this world of sin.
[3:25] I'm on my way to that fair city.
[3:30] When the saints go maring in.
[3:36] When the saints
[3:38] go marching in,
[3:41] when the saints go maring in,
[3:46] Lord, I want to be in that number
[3:51] when the saints go maring in.
[3:57] Oh, I know I'll see my Savior
[4:02] if my life is free from sin.
[4:07] Heaven's doors will open for me.
[4:12] When the saints go maring in.
[4:17] Oh, when the saints
[4:20] go marching in.
[4:22] [Music]
[4:23] When the saints go marching in.
[4:28] Oh Lord, I want to be in that number.
[4:33] When the saints go marching in
[4:38] and when we gather around the throne
[4:44] and the gates are closed within
[4:49] I'll be shouting glory glory
[4:54] when the saints go marching in.
[4:59] Oh, when the saints
[5:01] go marching in,
[5:04] when the saints go marching in,
[5:09] oh Lord, I want to be in that number.
[5:14] When the saints go maring and when they
[5:19] crown when they crown
[5:22] him king of kings
[5:25] when they crown him king of kings.
[5:29] Lord I want to be in that number
[5:35] when they crown him king of kings. When
[5:39] the saints When the saints
[5:42] go marching in.
[5:45] When the saints go maring in.
[5:50] Oh Lord, I want to be in that number.
[5:56] When the saints go marching in, well,
[6:01] I'm a pilgrim
[6:03] and a stranger.
[6:06] Wondering through this world of sin.
[6:10] I'm on my way to that fair city.
[6:16] When the saints are marching,
[6:20] [Music]
[6:21] you ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[6:25] tell you why. It's because
[6:29] my sins are gone.
[6:32] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[6:35] where they are, I say,
[6:39] "My sins are gone." For there underneath
[6:43] the blood of the cross of Calvary,
[6:47] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[6:52] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[6:55] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[6:59] My sins are gone.
[7:02] Was at the old time altar where God came
[7:06] in my heart. And now
[7:10] my sins are gone.
[7:13] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[7:16] did depart. I'm glad. So very glad my
[7:20] sins are gone.
[7:22] Over there underneath the blood of the
[7:26] cross of Calvary.
[7:28] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[7:33] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[7:36] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[7:40] My sins are gone.
[7:43] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[7:46] to make me down, I say
[7:50] my sins are gone.
[7:53] You got me into trouble. But Jesus got
[7:57] me out. I'm glad. Oh, my sins are gone.
[8:03] for there underneath the blood of the
[8:06] cross of Calvary.
[8:09] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[8:13] in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[8:16] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[8:21] My sins are gone.
[8:24] and living below
[8:27] in this old sinful world.
[8:31] Hardly a comfort can afford
[8:38] striving alone
[8:41] to face temptation. So
[8:45] where could I go but to the Lord?
[8:52] Where could I go?
[8:56] Where could I go?
[9:00] Seeking the refuge for my soul.
[9:07] Needing a friend to save me in the end.
[9:13] Singing where could I go but to the Lord
[9:17] once more.
[9:20] And where could I go?
[9:24] Oh, where could I go?
[9:28] Seeking a refuge for my soul. For my
[9:33] soul.
[9:35] Needing a friend to save me in the end.
[9:40] We're singing. Where could I go but to
[9:44] the Lord once more?
[9:48] And where could I go?
[9:52] Oh, where could I go?
[9:55] Seeking the refuge for my soul.
[10:02] Needing a friend to save me. In the end,
[10:08] we're singing, "Where could I go but to
[10:12] the Lord?"
[10:15] Here we are.
[10:20] lifting our hands
[10:23] to you.
[10:26] [Music]
[10:28] Here we are
[10:33] giving you thanks
[10:36] for all you do.
[10:42] as we praise
[10:46] and worship your holy
[10:50] name.
[10:51] [Music]
[10:55] You are here
[10:58] [Music]
[11:01] within.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; As brother Chad comes this evening,
[11:06] let's sing verse one.
[11:08] For every answered prayer,
[11:12] [Music]
[11:16] you'll always be there.
[11:22] Oh, for love that hears us when we call,
[11:30] for arms that lift us when we fall.
[11:37] You have always been
[11:41] right beside us.
[11:45] Leading all along
[11:48] the way.
[11:55] And we made it through
[11:59] [Music]
[12:03] because of you. Here
[12:09] we are
[12:13] lifting our hands
[12:16] to you.
[12:22] Here we are
[12:27] giving you praise
[12:30] for all you do.
[12:34] you
[12:36] as we praise
[12:39] [Music]
[12:40] and worship your holy name.
[12:49] Oh, you are here
[12:55] dwelling within
[12:57] our praise for days we cannot see.
[13:03] For days we cannot see.
[13:10] For all is yet to be
[13:17] the trials we may have to face,
[13:24] but will be leaning on your grace.
[13:32] It will be your strength
[13:36] that saves us.
[13:39] Your love that makes us strong.
[13:50] And through it all,
[13:57] we'll sing this song.
[14:01] [Music]
[14:03] Here we are.
[14:06] [Music]
[14:08] Lifting our hands
[14:11] to you.
[14:13] [Music]
[14:17] Here we are.
[14:22] We're giving you praise
[14:25] for all you do
[14:31] as we pray
[14:34] [Music]
[14:36] and worship your holy name.
[14:42] [Music]
[14:45] You are here
[14:50] dwelling within
[14:53] our grave.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[15:02] Oh, heavenly father, how we love you,
[15:04] Lord. How we're so thankful, Lord, that
[15:07] you've given us the permission, the
[15:09] allowance, the opportunity to lift our
[15:12] voice, to lift our hands and tell you
[15:14] that we love you. And God, we've
[15:16] gathered here at your bidding. You've
[15:18] drawn us to yourself, Lord. And we've
[15:20] come, Lord, to hear from you. We've come
[15:23] to receive from you. And God, we've come
[15:25] to give to you, Lord. To give you our
[15:27] hearts, to give you our praises, to give
[15:29] you our worship. And Lord, we've come to
[15:32] receive from you your word, Lord, and
[15:34] your spirit. May you come and fill us,
[15:36] Lord. And may you feed us, God. And God,
[15:39] I pray you take this vessel under your
[15:41] control and speak those words that are
[15:43] so needful in this hour, Lord. And may
[15:46] the right word strike the heart and meet
[15:48] the need of your children, Lord. May it
[15:50] bring results, Lord. For your word
[15:52] doesn't go in vain, Lord, but it'll
[15:54] accomplish what you sent it for. And I
[15:56] pray it would do so tonight, Lord. May
[15:58] your spirit empower us to hear and to
[16:01] receive all that you have for us. We
[16:04] love you. We ask your blessing over it
[16:06] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:10] Amen. God bless you all. It's good to be
[16:12] here this evening. Amen. While you're
[16:14] standing, if you want to grab your
[16:15] Bibles and turn to Romans, we're going
[16:17] to go to Romans chapter 3 and get
[16:19] started there.
[16:21] Uh while you're turning there, I just
[16:24] want to uh let you know that I've asked
[16:26] Brother Jim Swanson to take the service
[16:28] for us this Sunday. So, Brother Jim will
[16:29] be ministering this Sunday. So, I'm sure
[16:31] he'll appreciate your prayers. I know I
[16:33] always appreciate your prayers. I'm sure
[16:35] he will, too. So, we're looking forward
[16:37] to hearing from the Lord on Sunday.
[16:40] Amen. I'm going to continue on with this
[16:42] thought. I've been on the last two
[16:44] services on the message of grace and
[16:46] grace and works and and uh and and then
[16:50] we'll just see how the Lord leads. I
[16:51] never imagined when I started looking at
[16:53] this subject I would preach three
[16:54] services on it. Didn't dream on it. But
[16:56] I' I've been enjoying myself so much.
[16:58] Amen. It's been such a blessing. And
[17:00] it's amazing how you can go back to the
[17:02] fundamental teachings of Christianity
[17:03] that Christians have been talking about
[17:05] for 2,000 years. But in the light of the
[17:07] message of the hour, everything expands.
[17:10] every doctrine, every teaching, every
[17:12] scripture, it expands. And I I just love
[17:15] God for that. Amen. Let's look at Romans
[17:18] chapter 3 23 together.
[17:24] Romans 3 and 23. For all have sinned and
[17:26] come short of the glory of God. Can you
[17:28] say amen?
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; That all includes me. I'm sure it
[17:31] includes you, too. For all have sinned
[17:33] and come short of the glory go of God,
[17:35] being justified freely by his grace
[17:38] through the redemption that is in Christ
[17:40] Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a
[17:43] propitiation through the faith in his
[17:45] blood, to declare his righteousness for
[17:47] the remission of sins that are passed
[17:49] through the forbearance of God. To
[17:52] declare, I say at this time his
[17:54] righteousness, that he might be just and
[17:56] the justifier of him which believeth in
[17:59] Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is
[18:02] excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay,
[18:05] but by the law of faith. Therefore, we
[18:08] conclude that a man is justified by
[18:10] faith without the deeds of the law.
[18:13] Amen. God bless you. May you you may
[18:15] have your seats.
[18:17] If you look uh quickly back here uh in
[18:21] verse 23 again, I'm just want to go over
[18:23] 23 and 24. says, "For all have sinned
[18:26] and come short of the glory of God,
[18:27] being justified freely by his grace."
[18:30] Amen. That's so exciting because I don't
[18:32] have to pay anything. He paid it. Amen.
[18:35] It's freely by his grace. And by the
[18:37] death of Jesus Christ, his grace is
[18:39] bestowed freely upon us through Christ.
[18:42] Amen. And so, I'm so thankful that he
[18:44] said freely. Amen. I don't have to earn
[18:47] it. I don't have to work my way up to
[18:48] it. I don't have to be a good boy for a
[18:50] certain period of time before I can
[18:52] receive his grace. Amen. I've been
[18:54] justified freely by his grace.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so this this uh Yeah, we
[19:02] got the slide up. So this uh um subject
[19:05] we're going to look at, we're going to
[19:06] keep looking up like we did on Sunday on
[19:09] grace and works, but we're going to look
[19:10] at grace and works in the book of
[19:12] Ephesians. And brother Brandham's going
[19:14] to, you know, explain some things
[19:15] through the book of Ephesians for us.
[19:17] And so we're going to take a look at
[19:18] that. So tonight's going to be a bit of
[19:20] a Bible study. I want to go chapter by
[19:23] chapter through the book of Ephesians
[19:24] and I'm going to read segments out of
[19:26] each chapter and we're going to see what
[19:27] brother Benham's talking about. Amen. In
[19:30] this Ephesians and you'll see what I
[19:32] mean here in a minute uh as we get to
[19:34] the quotes. And so I hope none of you
[19:36] are tired and I hope nobody falls asleep
[19:38] and it's okay if you fall asleep. We'll
[19:40] let you stand and read the segment in
[19:41] the next chapter.
[19:44] Amen. I got to do something to make you
[19:48] eager to stay awake. Amen. Praise the
[19:50] Lord. So, so yeah, this is going to be
[19:52] like oldfashioned Bible study, which we
[19:54] haven't done for a while, but I I love
[19:56] it and I'm excited to do it. And and
[19:58] there's times that Brother Ben says
[20:00] things and, you know, we we hear him say
[20:02] things over and over again and they
[20:03] become true to us and we understand the
[20:05] truth of it and is real and we believe
[20:07] it, but sometimes it becomes so accepted
[20:10] that we actually don't go back and dig
[20:11] into what he was saying. And so
[20:13] sometimes it's fun to do that. And so
[20:15] tonight, hopefully we can uh I want to
[20:18] look at James. If you can turn with me
[20:19] to James chapter 2,
[20:22] I'm going to here we looked in Romans at
[20:24] a scripture that has to do with grace.
[20:27] In James, we're going to look at works
[20:32] and go to the book of James.
[20:35] Now, I'm so glad that God sent a prophet
[20:39] &gt;&gt; because if God had not sent us a
[20:40] prophet, amen, we would read uh book of
[20:43] Romans and read what Paul writes about
[20:45] grace being bestowed upon us freely
[20:47] without the works of the law. Then we
[20:49] would go to read James and James is
[20:51] seemingly saying something exactly
[20:53] opposite of what's Paul's saying. And if
[20:55] God hadn't sent a prophet, we would just
[20:57] decide which ones we want to read.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't deny I mean, if we were
[21:02] Bible believing Christian, we wouldn't
[21:03] deny James. We wouldn't say James is
[21:05] wrong, but we would just kind of breeze
[21:07] over it, not know what to do with it or
[21:08] how to handle it, and then just skip
[21:10] over it. That's what we did when I was
[21:11] raised, you know, as a boy. But by the
[21:14] grace of God, Amen. The Bible became a
[21:16] new book. We had a prophet who who
[21:17] interpreted all the writing on the
[21:19] outside of the pyramid, restored us back
[21:21] to the apostolic teaching of the fathers
[21:23] so that we wouldn't have to just skim
[21:25] through stuff. Amen. But he would break
[21:26] it down for us so that we understand
[21:28] there's no contradiction in the word of
[21:30] God. Yeah.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; So when we come to the book of James,
[21:33] let's just read first chapter 2
[21:36] uh verse 17.
[21:39] He says, "Even so faith, if it hath not
[21:41] works, is dead being alone."
[21:44] This is amazing because I Paul spent
[21:48] some quite a bit of time in in Romans
[21:51] and in Galatians uh explaining to us
[21:54] that we've been saved without the works
[21:57] of the law. that it has nothing to do
[21:59] with works and and works is excluded
[22:01] because of faith and and all of these
[22:03] things and that even the righteousness
[22:05] was imputed unto Abraham because he
[22:08] believed
[22:09] &gt;&gt; without works. It was imputed him
[22:11] without works. And so uh uh he spent
[22:13] quite a bit of time in that. And so now
[22:15] it comes in James is telling us that
[22:18] faith if it has not works is dead being
[22:20] alone. How can faith be dead if faith
[22:23] brought me to salvation and brought me
[22:25] to life?
[22:26] But he said, "Faith without works is
[22:28] dead."
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's just keep reading.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, a man may say, "Thou has faith,
[22:35] and I have works. Show me thy faith
[22:38] without thy works, and I will show thee
[22:40] my faith by my works. Thou believest
[22:43] that there is one God. Thou doest well.
[22:46] The devils also believe and tremble."
[22:49] But wilt thou know, O vain man, that
[22:52] faith without works is dead? Was not
[22:55] Abraham our father justified by works
[22:58] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[23:00] the altar? Seeest thou how faith wrought
[23:03] with his works? And by works was faith
[23:06] made perfect.
[23:08] Praise God.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Now
[23:12] he tells us something that seems
[23:14] opposite what Paul told us. Paul told us
[23:18] Abraham was justified by faith apart
[23:21] from works.
[23:24] Now he says, "Abraham our father was
[23:26] justified by works
[23:28] &gt;&gt; when he offered Isaac."
[23:34] &gt;&gt; This is where I thank God he sent a
[23:35] prophet.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Every single time I come across it, I
[23:39] thank God that he sent us a prophet.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we'll get into some of the
[23:44] things Brother Bam says about this, but
[23:47] I want to first look at this last verse.
[23:50] This verse 22. sees thou how faith uh
[23:53] faith wrought with his works and by
[23:56] works was faith made perfect. I want to
[23:58] look at this and break this down this
[24:00] one scripture down for just a moment
[24:02] because how can works make faith
[24:05] perfect? Faith is a gift from God.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace through faith and
[24:10] that of yourselves is a gift of God. And
[24:12] by that faith, Amen, we can enter in by
[24:15] the grace of God. We have access to God.
[24:18] Amen. Through this faith by his grace.
[24:20] So it it's it's it's only by faith. So
[24:23] how can works make faith perfect? Amen.
[24:25] I thought faith was all I needed. Faith
[24:28] in Christ Jesus would bring me into
[24:30] righteousness, bring me into the
[24:31] atonement. Amen. Bring me into
[24:33] salvation. So So what is what is James
[24:36] saying? And I you find out James is not
[24:40] saying what we initially think James is
[24:42] saying.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's no contradiction
[24:45] in the Bible. So in James uh 2:22,
[24:49] seeest thou how faith wrought with his
[24:51] works, and by works was faith made
[24:53] perfect. So faith wrought with his
[24:56] works. This term wrought with, what does
[24:58] this mean in the Bible? It's this it's
[25:01] this Greek word here. It means to work
[25:03] with, to help with, workers together
[25:06] work together. So faith was working
[25:10] together with works.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; They were not in any ways contrary to
[25:14] each other. They were in partnership for
[25:16] the work of God. So faith was helping
[25:20] with working with working together with
[25:24] uh works.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now now we know that works
[25:29] without faith doesn't do any good for
[25:31] the kingdom of God. It has to be works
[25:33] with faith. They have to be a
[25:34] partnership here.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; They have to be working together. So
[25:37] faith wrought with his works. Worked
[25:39] together was helping his works. Amen.
[25:43] This is important because if if we go to
[25:45] the legalist side and we just go to
[25:47] works where somebody can preach to me a
[25:50] standard and have a church standard or a
[25:52] creed and I through a certain amount of
[25:54] willpower, amen, can do all of those
[25:57] works. But if I do those works without
[25:59] the genuine faith and salvation, the the
[26:01] the true faith that is a gift of God,
[26:04] amen, it doesn't do me any good
[26:05] whatsoever towards salvation.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; So I have to start my bases on faith.
[26:11] I've got to believe I can do all of
[26:12] that. But if I don't believe the word,
[26:14] if I don't have true faith in my heart,
[26:16] it does me no good. But if I have true
[26:19] faith in my heart, that faith will work
[26:21] together with my works for the for the
[26:23] kingdom of God. Now, let's go to the to
[26:26] the next step. Uh let's go to the
[26:28] definition. Now says to work together,
[26:32] help in work, be partner in labor.
[26:35] That's what that's how faith wrought
[26:38] with my works. It was a partner together
[26:40] in the labor. It wasn't works apart from
[26:42] faith. It was faith empowering the
[26:44] works.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; To put forth power together with and
[26:48] thereby to assist.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. That's what faith
[26:55] does for us.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; All right. And now let's look at this
[26:59] word perfect. Because now faith wrought
[27:01] with works and by works was faith made
[27:03] perfect. This is what this is what is a
[27:06] little bit uh uh uh um uh this is where
[27:08] we can get a misunderstanding by saying
[27:11] faith works makes faith perfect. Amen.
[27:13] But this word perfect is not the way we
[27:15] typically use the English word perfect.
[27:18] Amen. As in as in flawless without flaw.
[27:21] Amen. This is a different meaning. And
[27:24] let's look here at the meaning. This is
[27:26] the Greek word here out of the
[27:27] concordance says make perfect, perfect,
[27:30] finish, fulfill, be perfect, consecrate.
[27:34] Now the real understanding is going to
[27:36] come when we look at the definitions in
[27:37] the concordance. And so the definitions
[27:39] say to make perfect, complete, to carry
[27:44] through completely, to accomplish,
[27:47] finish, to bring to an end.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Now the next one is to
[27:53] complete perfect add what is yet wanting
[27:56] in order to render a thing full to be
[27:59] found perfect. Now this is my favorite.
[28:02] To bring to the end proposed to bring to
[28:05] the end the goal that's proposed.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; So what is works? How does works make my
[28:11] faith perfect? Because God has something
[28:14] he wants done. Amen. And he wants to do
[28:17] it. And he's got to have people who
[28:18] believe in the word and hear the word.
[28:20] But God didn't want us just to believe
[28:22] the hear word and hear the word. He
[28:24] wants something to be done.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; So when by faith in the anointing of the
[28:28] Holy Ghost, we do the works, we now are
[28:32] bringing to the end the goal of faith.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; So that's how we're perfecting faith
[28:39] because we're bringing the goal of faith
[28:42] to fruition. Amen. To manifestation
[28:44] because God didn't say, "Amen, I just
[28:46] give my word and I want you to believe
[28:47] and that's all you have to do. Now go
[28:49] die." Amen. No. But he wanted us to
[28:50] believe because he wants to use his
[28:52] children who believe and fill them with
[28:55] his spirit so that they can flesh out
[28:57] the word that they believe and the word
[28:58] can come into manifestation. And when
[29:00] that word comes into manifestation,
[29:02] it'll perfect faith
[29:04] &gt;&gt; or fulfill or accomplish.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; What faith is.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; To accomplish, to bring to a close or
[29:16] fulfillment by event.
[29:19] prophecies of the scriptures. So now we
[29:22] look at that little word perfect and it
[29:24] says, you know, faith wrought with our
[29:26] works. Amen. And by works was faith made
[29:30] perfect. It almost made it look like
[29:32] faith wasn't enough. You know, faith
[29:35] wasn't sufficient. I needed works to
[29:38] perfect my faith. Well, if you're
[29:39] thinking of perfect as uh uh uh
[29:41] something that is is perfect now is
[29:44] without flaw or something that is
[29:46] absolutely spotless or absolutely
[29:49] pristine and faith couldn't be that
[29:51] without works and we got the wrong
[29:52] understanding completely and so faith
[29:55] was insufficient. Faith is perfectly
[29:57] sufficient friends. But faith came to do
[29:59] something. And when faith moves us to do
[30:02] the something it was supposed to do,
[30:03] that's the completion of faith. And so
[30:06] faith is empowering or helping the
[30:08] works. So the works are the works of
[30:11] God, not our works, his works. And those
[30:13] works are the completion of the faith
[30:15] that came to us.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why when I read James and
[30:22] I I I I when I read it, I said, "It
[30:25] doesn't make sense to me. It doesn't add
[30:26] up to what Paul's saying. I don't
[30:28] understand it. What did the prophet
[30:29] say?" Amen. What does it mean? Now, all
[30:32] of a sudden, it begins to unlock. And it
[30:33] it's actually super simple.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says,
[30:40] "Abraham was justified by Paul by faith,
[30:43] but by James by works." Abraham was
[30:46] talking what God saw. He he means Paul
[30:48] here was talking what God saw and James
[30:51] was talking what man saw. Show me your
[30:54] faith by your works without your works
[30:56] and so forth. See, then if you don't
[30:58] have works with your faith, it shows you
[31:00] haven't got faith.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; But if you really got faith, you believe
[31:07] it and act like it. That's right. Put it
[31:10] in action.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; This is where Brother Ben's making it
[31:13] simple. He says Paul is looking from the
[31:16] reference of God.
[31:18] And when Abraham believed that was
[31:21] enough for God.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; God imputed righteousness unto him or
[31:25] put on him or put into his account
[31:27] righteousness because he believed.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; But when James is looking at Abraham,
[31:32] he's looking from an earthly human
[31:33] perspective. And and Abraham's faith was
[31:37] made perfect, completed, finished,
[31:39] brought about its purpose. Amen. when he
[31:41] offered up Isaac, showing that he truly
[31:44] believed God
[31:45] &gt;&gt; and did what God said. Amen. So God,
[31:49] listen, this is why um so many modern
[31:53] modern this modern teaching in the
[31:56] modern age throughout Christianity is
[31:58] God looks at my heart. It doesn't matter
[32:00] what I do.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Anybody heard the extreme grace
[32:04] preaching that has become very popular
[32:06] in Leodysia because it suits the
[32:08] Leodysian nature. my rights, people's
[32:11] rights, right? And and uh so now this
[32:16] extreme grace says God looks at my
[32:19] heart, doesn't matter what I do. Well,
[32:21] there's there's a a a a measure of truth
[32:24] to what they're saying that God saved me
[32:27] uh separate completely separate from my
[32:30] works
[32:31] &gt;&gt; because when he saved me, I wasn't even
[32:34] born yet. Amen. And then, amen, he was
[32:37] watching over me and securing me while I
[32:39] was doing all the wrong works.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; And he didn't save me because I started
[32:43] doing right works. He came and found me.
[32:46] Amen. When I was still doing the wrong
[32:47] works.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; So, so God, from Paul's perspective,
[32:52] from the heavenly perspective, God is
[32:55] looking at he's looking for somebody who
[32:57] will believe his word. Amen. And he
[32:58] recognizes faith and then he sealed his
[33:01] faith with circumcision. God is looking
[33:03] for faith and he'll seal that faith with
[33:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for God, that's enough. You're
[33:10] sealed to the day of redemption. That
[33:11] faith was what? Faith was what acquired
[33:14] it. Faith was what triggered it. Faith
[33:16] was what apprehended it. Amen. And God
[33:18] imputed unto us righteousness. The same
[33:20] way. Amen. But yet, God wants his word
[33:24] made manifest on this earth. God wants
[33:26] his word to live in every age. He wants
[33:28] his word to be demonstrated in every
[33:30] age. Amen. So there's got to be a
[33:33] testimony to every age that the word is
[33:35] true. And that testimony is our works.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what man sees.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why works perfects faith
[33:48] &gt;&gt; because it accomplishes exactly what God
[33:51] sent us on this earth to do
[33:54] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[33:56] Listen friends, God sent us here to do
[33:59] works.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:01] Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; But he never intended works to be the
[34:05] basis of our salvation.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; But he's got something for us to do. And
[34:10] that something for us to do is to live
[34:12] his word.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; To display his nature, to be a
[34:16] manifestation of Jesus Christ on the
[34:19] earth in a many membered body. That's
[34:21] what he wants us to do. That's why when
[34:25] we say we have faith and don't have
[34:27] works, it's dead because it's not
[34:29] accomplishing what God wanted it to
[34:31] accomplish.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; But when faith is wrought together with
[34:36] works, not just doing something because
[34:37] somebody said it, but the actual works
[34:39] of God that's anointed by faith, those
[34:42] works, amen, are perfecting faith and
[34:45] accomplishing God's purpose on the
[34:47] earth.
[34:48] Amen. This is why, and we're going to
[34:51] get into more quotes. This is why
[34:52] brother Brandham said, he goes, "I'm a
[34:54] legalist." That brother Brandham was a
[34:56] million miles from being a legalist and
[34:58] in what we term as legalist, but he
[35:00] believed in doing right. He believed in
[35:02] fulfilling the word. He believed in
[35:04] obeying the commands. That's what I
[35:06] believe he's referring to when he say,
[35:07] "I'm a legalist." He didn't believe it
[35:09] was optional if you want to or not to.
[35:11] He believed that God's commandment
[35:13] deserved obedience.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; And then that was the right thing for a
[35:17] Christian to do is obey the word of God.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he never he never taught that
[35:23] that was a basis for salvation or if you
[35:25] can do everything right, it means you're
[35:27] saved. No, you're saved by faith by
[35:29] faith alone. Amen. But that faith now,
[35:32] amen, brings you into the kingdom of the
[35:34] God and the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[35:36] and opens up the word to you and and
[35:37] also gives you the power to live the
[35:40] word that you see.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] So let let's continue on.
[35:47] Uh in 2 Timothy 1:9 he says, "Who hath
[35:52] saved us and called us with a holy
[35:54] calling, not according to our works, but
[35:57] according to his own purpose and grace
[35:59] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[36:01] before the world began." So I'm bouncing
[36:04] back and forth between grace and works.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandham was able to
[36:10] take from both sides and stick it
[36:11] together right in the middle.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Here's first Thessalonians 4:1.
[36:18] Furthermore, when he we beseech you,
[36:21] brethren, and exhort you by the Lord
[36:22] Jesus, that as you have received of us
[36:25] how you ought to walk and to please God,
[36:28] so you would abound more and more.
[36:31] For you know what commandments we gave
[36:34] you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the
[36:36] will of God, even your sanctification,
[36:39] that you should abstain from
[36:40] fornication, that every one of you
[36:42] should know how to possess his vessel in
[36:44] sanctification and honor, not in the
[36:46] lust of concupisitions,
[36:49] even as the Gentiles which know not God,
[36:51] that no man go beyond and defraud his
[36:53] brother in any matter, because that the
[36:55] Lord is the avenger of all such as we
[36:57] also have forewarned you and testify.
[36:59] For God has not called us unto
[37:00] uncleanness, but unto holiness. So this
[37:03] is Paul who taught grace.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; I think it's unusual or odd. How do I
[37:15] say this?
[37:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to say it. You know, so
[37:19] many times you get you're not I'm not
[37:20] premeditated. I don't know what I'm
[37:21] going to say, but I got something on my
[37:23] heart to say, and I don't know how to
[37:24] say because I want to say it in a very
[37:26] very nice way.
[37:28] But you have people who say the gospel
[37:30] is not dos and don'ts.
[37:34] Then what's Paul talking about?
[37:37] &gt;&gt; He's saying don't do this.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Don't do that.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; You should do this.
[37:45] So like if it's not dos and don'ts, I
[37:49] don't understand over 50% of the New
[37:51] Testament
[37:54] &gt;&gt; because so much of the New Testament is
[37:56] telling us how to behave,
[37:59] &gt;&gt; what God's pleased with, what he's not
[38:01] pleased with. So you say that it became
[38:04] fashionable in the end time in Leodysia
[38:07] to say the gospel is not dos and don'ts.
[38:10] But then what is Paul talking about?
[38:11] What's Peter talking about? What's Jude
[38:13] talking about? What's James talking
[38:15] about when they're telling us don't do
[38:17] this, don't do this, don't do this, do
[38:19] this, and do
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[38:21] &gt;&gt; it's dos and don'ts, but it's not the
[38:23] basis for salvation. It won't bring you
[38:26] into salvation. You've got to come by
[38:28] faith and faith alone. You're justified
[38:30] by faith. Amen. By the grace of God
[38:32] alone, apart from anything you ever did.
[38:35] And if you never get anything right,
[38:36] you're still saved.
[38:39] But then after after Paul brings to them
[38:41] the message of grace, he starts telling
[38:43] them, "Now make sure you do this and
[38:45] make sure you do that and make sure you
[38:46] don't do this and make sure you don't do
[38:47] that."
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; So this old term, it's not dos and
[38:53] don'ts. I I sometimes I scratch my head
[38:55] at that and puzzle and say, "I I don't
[38:58] know what you're talking about."
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Uh as if God doesn't care what you do
[39:04] every day with your life.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; As if it doesn't matter to him. Yeah,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; that's not He didn't save me so I can go
[39:10] live my own life. He saved me so I could
[39:12] surrender my life to him so he could
[39:13] live his life through me, which is
[39:15] according to his commandments.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And trying to do God a service
[39:21] without being his will. He says he only
[39:23] reveals this word in the predestinated.
[39:26] Now, when I use that word predestiny,
[39:27] now it's a bad word to use in public,
[39:29] especially when we have mixed crowd
[39:31] between the Armenians and the Calvinist.
[39:34] And I I've asked you not to think I I
[39:36] know it all, but they're both wrong
[39:38] according to the scripture. Grace is
[39:40] what God did for me. Works is what I do
[39:42] for him. We talked about this on uh uh
[39:46] on Sunday. I never remember what day it
[39:48] is. Every time I'm here, it's Sunday.
[39:51] Even when it's Wednesday, it's Sunday.
[39:53] So, you'll have to forgive me, you know.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Marriage and divorce. He
[40:00] says, it's just like today. I read this
[40:03] quote Sunday. There's two great schools
[40:05] of doctrine in the church. One of them
[40:07] is Calvinism. The other are Arminianism.
[40:10] One of them is legalist. The other one
[40:12] is grace. And we come to find out that
[40:15] the people who believe in grace, the
[40:16] Calvinist, they say, "Bless God, it
[40:18] don't hurt me to smoke. It don't hurt me
[40:20] to drink. I can do these things. I've
[40:22] got eternal security." Then we find the
[40:25] other side on the legalist said, "Oh,
[40:27] would like to ball him out. I would like
[40:29] to show him a piece of my mind, but I'm
[40:31] a Christian. and I have to keep still.
[40:33] See, you find yourself on two different
[40:35] roads and neither one of them is right.
[40:38] So, brother Bam is is making this so
[40:41] clear. Now, when we come to the conflict
[40:43] between Calvinism and Armenianism,
[40:46] listen, it it it would take a long time
[40:48] to explain in detail the difference in
[40:50] these two. even to understand one of
[40:52] them. It there's so much writing on it
[40:53] and I I've done some reading on it but
[40:56] just in the way brother Brandham is
[40:57] using it here he's trying to show us
[40:59] what the end result of extreme
[41:01] Calvinistic teaching and Arminian
[41:03] teaching does because Calvinistic
[41:05] teaching is that God saved me apart from
[41:07] me. It had nothing to do with me. It was
[41:09] by his will alone and I have nothing to
[41:12] do with it and I can't resist his will
[41:14] and I will do and I will come to him
[41:16] because he draw me and I can't stop it.
[41:18] Amen. because of his will and and his
[41:20] blood is covered at all. Amen. There's
[41:22] nothing wrong with that teaching
[41:26] until you take it to extreme measures.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So, fundamentally, I mean, there's some
[41:32] problems with it fundamentally, but I'm
[41:33] not getting into the nitty-gritty. I'm
[41:35] just talking in a general term here. So,
[41:36] some of you theologians around just
[41:38] don't just don't pick on me.
[41:41] I'm just trying to get a little bitty
[41:42] summary. Okay? So, so in the Calvinistic
[41:46] teaching then it goes, well, I was
[41:49] always saved. I cannot be unsaved. I'm
[41:51] saved only by grace apart from any works
[41:54] that I can do. And it wasn't my choice.
[41:56] Amen. It was God's choice. Amen. And and
[41:59] it doesn't have anything to do with what
[42:00] I do. So, they take it to extreme
[42:02] Calvinism, not even really what Calvin
[42:04] taught.
[42:06] To the point now where my conduct does
[42:08] not matter because I'm saved by grace, a
[42:11] choice God made before the foundation
[42:13] world. So it's it's totally separate
[42:14] from what I do. Now, Brother Rem tells
[42:16] us that's true.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; But then they ignore a whole another
[42:22] section of the Bible where God wants us
[42:25] to live the live his life.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; When you get into Armenianism,
[42:30] Armenianism say that God just made it
[42:33] possible to be saved. His grace is
[42:35] sending Jesus Christ and there's a
[42:37] possibility, but it's all up to you
[42:39] whether you choose to believe or not.
[42:41] It's not something God predetermined.
[42:43] Amen. It's something that you have the
[42:45] capacity to believe and you hold on to
[42:47] because if you don't hold on to it and
[42:49] you disobey and fall away, you could
[42:51] lose your salvation.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; So this is why brother Brandham talks
[42:55] about the Calvinism and Armenianism this
[42:58] way. He's saying one of them says bless
[43:00] God. It don't hurt me to smoke. It don't
[43:02] hurt me to drink. I can do these things.
[43:04] I've got eternal security. You can see
[43:07] that was the end of that doctrine. or
[43:09] when it brother V said went out on a
[43:11] limb
[43:12] &gt;&gt; not how it started Armenianism when it
[43:15] was all up to you to make your choice
[43:17] and it's based on your decision it's
[43:19] based on your actions now when you have
[43:21] wrong actions
[43:22] &gt;&gt; then you're out of the grace of God
[43:25] &gt;&gt; yeah right
[43:26] &gt;&gt; amen
[43:28] &gt;&gt; and so now that's why he would say I
[43:30] would like to ball him out because
[43:31] there's no conversion in the heart
[43:33] there's only a conformity to a code I'd
[43:35] like to ball them out I'd like to show
[43:37] them a piece of my mind but I'm a
[43:38] Christian, I have to keep still. Why
[43:40] does he have to keep still? Cuz he could
[43:42] lose his salvation.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's all based on his conduct, his
[43:45] ability to do right.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; So, this is what brother Bam's referring
[43:49] to where these two things went out on a
[43:51] limb and got extreme in these two
[43:53] extreme attitudes. Now, he's going to
[43:55] bring him back to the middle. Amen. So,
[43:59] so you find yourself on two different
[44:01] roads and neither one of them is right.
[44:04] little further down in the same quote,
[44:06] he says, "As long as I want to go do it,
[44:08] it's in my heart to do it." Whether I
[44:11] say, "As long as it's in my heart to do
[44:12] it, I go do it." Legalism won't let me
[44:15] do it is because that I know I'd get
[44:17] punished for doing it. But the real
[44:19] truth of it is is when the love of God
[44:21] comes into your heart till you want to
[44:23] do it. That's the truth of it. There is
[44:25] the two schools, not legalism or other
[44:28] or Calvinism. It's both.
[44:32] And that's exactly what brother Brandham
[44:34] taught. He he taught elements of both.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Elements of both.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; So in demonology, I'm going to read
[44:45] three quotes that tell us about the book
[44:46] of Ephesians. I'm going to read them
[44:47] right in the row. Then we're going to go
[44:48] to the book of Ephesians. He says in
[44:51] demonology, physical realm, he says,
[44:53] "Oh, let me correct this just a little
[44:54] bit or say something. Somebody's going
[44:57] to get away and say, Brother Brenham's a
[44:59] Calvinist." No, I'm not. I'm a
[45:01] Calvinist. as long as Calvin now
[45:03] Calvinist is in the Bible.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; But when Calvinist gets out of the
[45:06] Bible, them I'm an Armenian.
[45:09] See, I believe in holiness and I believe
[45:11] in Calvinist, too. But both of them, one
[45:14] run out on a limb went this way, one run
[45:16] on a limb went that way. If it wasn't
[45:18] for the book of Ephesians to bring it
[45:20] back and put it in the right place where
[45:22] God did, we'd all be all mixed up.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But they both got a doctrine, but they
[45:29] go deceit on it. each one that's the
[45:31] holiness and the Calvinist too the
[45:33] Armenian
[45:35] then this next quote he says I believe
[45:38] that before the foundation of the world
[45:40] according to Ephesians 1 that God knew
[45:42] us and knew that he was sending me and
[45:45] the other ministers and so forth to
[45:47] preach the gospel before the world was
[45:49] ever formed. I believe that's scriptural
[45:51] teaching that's got a lot of Calvinistic
[45:54] wing to it. I believe the Calvinist was
[45:56] all right. They got a scripture to
[45:59] stand. So has the Armenian. But they
[46:02] both run out and ride on limbs, broke
[46:04] off, made issues. God just brought the
[46:06] whole thing back and stuck it in the
[46:08] book of Ephesians and straightened it
[46:10] out.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; So there's a way to know what's right.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And brother, I'm saying it's in the book
[46:18] of Ephesians.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And the waters of separation says, "One
[46:22] went to seed this way, other one went to
[46:24] seed that way." But I think the book of
[46:25] Ephesians brings them both right back
[46:28] and puts them in the stump where they
[46:30] belong. So I really like the book of
[46:32] Ephesians. It keeps it kind of keeps us
[46:35] straightened out, brethren, in our
[46:36] theology, doesn't it? The book of
[46:38] Ephesians. So who wants straightened out
[46:40] in your theology? So let's go look at
[46:42] the book of Ephesians together. Turn to
[46:44] Ephesians chapter 1. And brother Franco,
[46:46] if you could bring up the whiteboard for
[46:47] me.
[46:50] I'm going to use it for just a moment.
[46:55] Ephesians chapter 1
[46:58] and I'm just going to go chapter by
[47:00] chapter and I'm just going to put se
[47:02] we're going to read together segments
[47:04] out of the chapter. Now I I'm going to
[47:06] look at this I we're just sailing
[47:08] through this looking at one concept one
[47:11] idea in a simplistic way. We're not deep
[47:14] diving. This is not a deep dive study in
[47:15] the book of Ephesians. We could do that
[47:17] maybe for a year or more but we're just
[47:19] going to do this skim through on this
[47:21] subject we're on. So, first of all, I
[47:24] want to look at
[47:33] Is that spelled right? Yeah. Well, at
[47:35] least that's the way it is in the
[47:36] message.
[47:38] It's good enough for me.
[47:42] So, let's look at the grace side
[47:47] and the works side.
[47:50] I'm just drawing this for a reference.
[47:52] But over here, if you take chapters
[47:57] one, two, and three is on the grace
[48:00] side. And over here,
[48:03] chapters four, five, and six is on the
[48:08] work side. So, it is split right down
[48:11] the middle.
[48:13] It it's exactly as brother Brandham told
[48:16] us that the truth of this is in
[48:18] Ephesians. It's brought together in the
[48:20] theology straightened out in Ephesians.
[48:22] And the first three chapters is about
[48:25] grace and the last three chapters deals
[48:27] with works. So let's start reading. Are
[48:30] we ready?
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Remember what happens if you fall
[48:33] asleep.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Please don't forget Ephesians chapter 1
[48:38] verse one.
[48:40] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[48:43] will of God. So how was Paul an apostle?
[48:47] By the will of God. Amen. Had nothing to
[48:49] do with Paul. To the saints which are at
[48:52] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[48:54] Jesus. Grace be unto you and peace from
[48:57] God our father and from the Lord Jesus
[48:59] Christ. Blessed be the God and father of
[49:01] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[49:03] us with all spiritual blessings in
[49:05] heavenly places in Christ according as
[49:08] he hath chosen us. First of all, I want
[49:10] you to know where do our blessings lie
[49:12] in heavenly places in Christ. Does that
[49:14] make your blessings secure?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; According as he hath chosen us in him
[49:20] before the foundation of the world. So
[49:22] when did God choose you?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world. So
[49:26] after you started doing good works,
[49:28] before you had a chance to do either
[49:30] good or evil, he said, "Jacob have I
[49:32] loved and Esau have I hated." Amen. we
[49:35] were chosen not from the foundation of
[49:37] the world but before before the
[49:40] foundation of the world
[49:42] that we should be holy and without blame
[49:45] before him in love. So what did he
[49:47] choose us for? To be holy and without
[49:50] blame before him in love. That's why he
[49:52] chose us in Christ because Christ would
[49:54] pay the price to make us holy and
[49:56] without blame. Not our conduct but
[49:59] Christ sacrifice.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Five. having predestinated us unto the
[50:04] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[50:06] himself. So, so okay, let's read the
[50:10] whole verse. According to the good
[50:11] pleasure of his will. So, he has
[50:14] predestinated predetermined our destiny.
[50:17] Predestinated us unto adoption of
[50:19] children by Jesus Christ to himself. So,
[50:22] he has already predestinated us to
[50:24] adoption.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; What is adoption? An adoption is taking
[50:27] a son and as a son grows into maturity
[50:30] and placing him in the kingdom. We have
[50:32] been predestinated to be placed in the
[50:34] kingdom.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Before we did the good works that would
[50:38] warrant our placing,
[50:40] &gt;&gt; amen, right?
[50:42] &gt;&gt; You think think about this. Adoption has
[50:44] to do with a son. Amen. And when you're
[50:46] born again by the Holy Ghost, you're a
[50:48] son. But then that Holy Ghost becomes a
[50:50] tutor to lead you and grow you into the
[50:52] stature of a perfect man and bring you
[50:54] into a measure where God can use you to
[50:56] do a kingdom work and he can
[50:58] positionally place you. And as you grow
[51:00] up, amen, as brother Benham taught it in
[51:02] adoption, amen, the boy's got to get the
[51:04] lessons right. Amen. He's got to grow in
[51:06] grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[51:08] Got to grow in temperance and faith and
[51:10] and and and and virtue and all of these
[51:13] things until finally the father gets him
[51:15] to a place and he says, "He's old
[51:16] enough. He's grown enough. I can place
[51:18] him in position that comes by him
[51:20] overcoming obstacles, passing testes,
[51:23] growing. Amen. Growing in grace, growing
[51:25] in knowledge, growing in revelation.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Growing in conduct.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Brandham, in the adoption
[51:33] series, he goes, he says he gives a
[51:35] report on the bad son. Amen. He gives a
[51:37] report on the good son. The report on
[51:39] the bad son and says, "I'm I'm sorry.
[51:40] I'm ashamed to tell you, but your son,
[51:42] he's going out and he's carousing. He's
[51:44] wasting money and he's doing all of
[51:45] that." Amen. He wasn't ready for
[51:47] adoption.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; But the good son, he comes to him. He
[51:51] says, "Now listen, you should have seen
[51:53] the way he handled those sheep the other
[51:54] day, father. He did it just the way you
[51:56] would do it." What's happening? His
[51:58] works are coming to manifest the the
[52:01] will and desire of the father.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; And then he can be placed into adoption
[52:06] after that.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; But guess what? You were adopted unto
[52:14] sons before the foundation of the world.
[52:16] Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Before you got it right, he already knew
[52:19] what position you would hold. He already
[52:20] knew where you belonged in the kingdom.
[52:22] And he already predestinated you to the
[52:24] adoption.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:31] And how did he do it? According to the
[52:33] pleasure of his will. Not what you were
[52:36] asking him to do. what he decided
[52:40] &gt;&gt; through the praise of the glory of his
[52:43] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[52:45] in the beloved. We did not become
[52:48] acceptable. He made us accepted in the
[52:51] beloved.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; All right. In whom we have redemption
[52:56] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[52:59] sins according to the riches of his
[53:01] grace. None of that has anything to do
[53:03] with what you did.
[53:05] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[53:07] all wisdom and prudence, having made
[53:08] known unto us the mystery of his will,
[53:11] according to his good pleasure, which he
[53:13] purposed in himself, still has nothing
[53:16] to do with you.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; That in the dispensation of the fullness
[53:20] of times, he might gather together in
[53:22] one all things in Christ, both which are
[53:25] in heaven and which are on earth, even
[53:27] in him. in whom also we have obtained an
[53:31] inheritance, being predestinated
[53:33] according to the purpose of him who
[53:35] workketh all things after the counsel of
[53:36] his own will. So, was God waiting for
[53:39] you to make a decision? Was God waiting
[53:42] for you to get it right? Was God waiting
[53:44] for you?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. He already predetermined
[53:49] it. He already decided. He already knew
[53:51] what he was going to do. He already knew
[53:52] you were going to do it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And so, in whom we also obtained an
[53:58] inheritance. How did I obtain that
[53:59] inheritance? In him. Not anything I did.
[54:02] By being predestinated. Verse 12. That
[54:04] we should be to the praise of his glory.
[54:06] Who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye
[54:09] also trusted after that you heard the
[54:11] word of truth, the gospel of your
[54:12] salvation. In whom also after that you
[54:15] believed, you were sealed with the Holy
[54:16] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[54:18] of your inheritance until the redemption
[54:20] of the purchased possession unto the
[54:22] praise of his glory. Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; That sounds like pretty good Calvinistic
[54:27] teaching to me.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; You agree?
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's good. Let's look at
[54:34] chapter 2. Let's skip over to chapter 2.
[54:36] Like I said, we could go into much more.
[54:37] We're just kind of breezing through. And
[54:39] it's hard to breeze through, but we're
[54:40] going to try. All right. Chapter 2,
[54:42] verse four. But God, who is rich in
[54:45] mercy, for his great love wherewith he
[54:48] loved us, even when we were dead in
[54:50] sins, hath quickened us together with
[54:52] Christ. By grace you are saved. So when
[54:55] were you quickened with with Christ?
[54:57] When you were dead in sins and
[54:59] trespasses.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Not when you had repented. Not when you
[55:02] had made it right. Not when you had
[55:03] turned over a new leaf. Not when you
[55:05] finally decided that you were going to
[55:07] believe. No. When you were still dead in
[55:11] sins and and and uh trespasses.
[55:15] Uh he quickened us together with Christ.
[55:18] By grace you are saved. And hath raised
[55:20] us up together and made us sit together
[55:22] in heavenly places in Christ. When did
[55:25] he do that?
[55:27] When he raised Christ.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So where is your position in heavenly
[55:33] places in Christ Jesus? When was it
[55:35] determined? Before you had a chance to
[55:38] make a decision.
[55:40] Amen. He hath raised up together and
[55:42] made us sit together in heavenly places
[55:44] in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to
[55:46] come, he might show the exceeding riches
[55:48] of his grace and his kindness towards us
[55:51] through Christ Jesus. For by grace are
[55:54] you saved through faith, and that not of
[55:56] yourselves. It is the gift of God, not
[55:59] of works, lest any man should boast. For
[56:01] we are his workmanship, created in
[56:03] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[56:05] hath before ordained that we should walk
[56:07] in them.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] Calvinistic
[56:12] &gt;&gt; grace. He did it. Even the works you do,
[56:16] he's already ordained that you'll walk
[56:17] in them.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Chapter 3,
[56:24] verse one.
[56:27] For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of
[56:30] Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, if you
[56:32] have heard of the dispensation of the
[56:34] grace of God, which is given me to you,
[56:35] word, how that by revelation he made
[56:38] known unto me the mystery, as I wrote
[56:40] before in a few words, whereby when you
[56:42] read, you may understand my knowledge in
[56:44] the mystery of Christ, which in other
[56:46] ages was not made known unto the sons of
[56:48] men, as it is now, revealed unto his
[56:50] holy apostles and prophets by the
[56:52] Spirit, that the Gentiles should be
[56:54] fellows, and of the same body, and
[56:56] partakers of his promise in Christ
[57:00] by the gospel.
[57:02] Whereof I was made a minister according
[57:04] to the gift of grace of God given unto
[57:06] me by the effectual working of his
[57:08] power. Unto me who am less than the
[57:10] least of the saints is this grace given
[57:12] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[57:14] the unsearchable riches of Christ. And
[57:16] to make all men see what is the
[57:18] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[57:20] beginning of of the world hath been hid
[57:23] in God who created all things by Jesus
[57:25] Christ. to the intent now that that now
[57:29] unto the principalities and powers in
[57:31] heavenly places might be known by the
[57:33] church the manifold wisdom of God
[57:35] according to the eternal purpose which
[57:37] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[57:40] whom we have boldness and access with
[57:42] confidence by faith of him. He's telling
[57:45] us God gave me this revelation that he
[57:47] already decided he was going to have the
[57:49] Gentiles and it's all finished in Christ
[57:53] &gt;&gt; according to his eternal purpose. Not
[57:57] waiting to find out what you would do.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've come through three
[58:02] chapters. Remember our division? Is it
[58:04] still up there? So, now we're halfway
[58:07] through the book of Ephesians, and now
[58:08] we're going to start into chapter 4. We
[58:10] start into chapter four. We're going to
[58:12] see that Paul now uh uh uh uh it's
[58:16] almost like he changes tunes. Now, let's
[58:18] read it here in verse one.
[58:21] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[58:23] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[58:25] vocation wherewith you were called with
[58:27] all loneliness and meekness, with
[58:29] longsuffering, forbearing one another in
[58:31] love, endeavoring to keep the unity of
[58:33] the spirit and the bond of peace.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Is that a commandment?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Is that something you're supposed to do?
[58:41] Then he goes back and there's another
[58:43] mention of grace here in verse 7. In
[58:45] verse 7 he says, "But unto every one of
[58:47] us is given grace according to the
[58:50] measure of the gift of Christ." So what
[58:52] was given to us, the grace of God was
[58:54] given to us. Amen. It's not something
[58:56] that we earned is according to the
[58:58] measure of the gift of Christ. Now let's
[59:01] jump down uh to verse uh 17.
[59:07] Remember, now remember what half of the
[59:09] book we're in.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Are we in the grace or works half?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:15] This I say therefore and testify in the
[59:17] Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[59:19] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[59:21] their mind, having their understanding
[59:24] darkened, being alienated from the life
[59:26] of God through the ignorance that is in
[59:27] them, because of the blindness of their
[59:29] heart, who being past feeling have given
[59:31] themselves over into lasciviousness to
[59:34] work all uncleanness with greediness.
[59:36] But you have not so learned Christ. If
[59:38] so be that you have heard him and have
[59:40] been taught by him, as the truth is in
[59:42] Jesus, that you put off concerning the
[59:44] former conversation the old man, which
[59:47] is corrupt according to the deceitful
[59:48] lust, and be renewed in the spirit of
[59:51] your mind, and that you put on the new
[59:53] man, which after God is created in
[59:55] righteousness, and true holiness.
[59:57] Wherefore putting away lying, speak
[59:59] every man truth with his neighbor. For
[1:00:02] we are members one of another. Be ye
[1:00:05] angry and sin not. Let not the sun go
[1:00:07] down upon your wrath. Neither give place
[1:00:09] to the devil. Let him that stole steal
[1:00:12] no more, but rather let him labor
[1:00:14] working with his hands the thing which
[1:00:16] is good, that he may have to give to him
[1:00:18] that needeth. Let no corrupt
[1:00:20] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[1:00:22] but that which is good to the use of
[1:00:24] edifying, that it may minister grace
[1:00:26] unto the hearers. And grieve not the
[1:00:28] Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
[1:00:30] sealed into the day of redemption. Let
[1:00:32] all bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:00:34] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:00:36] from you with all malice. And be ye kind
[1:00:39] one to another, tender-hearted,
[1:00:41] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:00:43] Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That was a pile of don'ts.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Are we in agreement? Yes.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, he said, "Don't do this, and
[1:00:58] don't do that, and don't do this, and
[1:00:59] don't do this, and don't do this, and
[1:01:01] don't do this, and don't do that."
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Like, I got tired reading the list of
[1:01:05] don'ts.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; So, how can we say it doesn't matter?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; How can we say that the the gospel
[1:01:16] doesn't matter? The word of God doesn't
[1:01:17] matter, what God inspired Paul doesn't
[1:01:19] matter. And also Paul is telling you, he
[1:01:22] says, he says, "Grieve not," this verse
[1:01:25] 30, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God."
[1:01:27] He's telling you not to grieve the Holy
[1:01:29] Spirit. That's something you have to do.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What Paul is not saying is all you
[1:01:34] need to do is get the Holy Ghost. And
[1:01:35] once you get the Holy Ghost, then don't
[1:01:37] worry about anything. You don't have to
[1:01:38] do anything. The Holy Ghost will lead
[1:01:39] you what to do. So whatever you do is
[1:01:41] fine. He's saying, "No, you exercise
[1:01:43] your free will. You control the vessel
[1:01:45] you live in. And you don't you dare
[1:01:47] grieve the Holy Ghost. It's not as
[1:01:49] though I can get the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:51] Ghost and say, "Now I've got the baptism
[1:01:53] of the Holy Ghost. God's in me. Whatever
[1:01:55] I feel to do, I'll do
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; right." Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want to tell anybody don't
[1:02:00] do this or don't do this. I just want
[1:02:02] the Holy Ghost to lead them.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; I don't want to tell them. I don't want
[1:02:07] to give instruction. I don't want to
[1:02:09] give teaching because now they've got
[1:02:11] the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost will will
[1:02:12] lead them. I just need to keep hands
[1:02:14] off. That's not how Paul taught the
[1:02:16] gospel. Paul taught the gospel. Now that
[1:02:18] you got the Holy Ghost, now that you
[1:02:20] know you're a child of God. Now that you
[1:02:22] know it's apart from works, that you
[1:02:23] didn't earn it, you're accepted in the
[1:02:25] beloved, you had nothing to do with it.
[1:02:27] God chose you to adoption. Now God cares
[1:02:29] about how you live. Now don't go do the
[1:02:31] former things. Don't go do what the
[1:02:33] world does. Separate yourself. Live
[1:02:35] sanctified unto the purpose that God has
[1:02:37] called you to.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And don't you grieve the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought the Holy Ghost would
[1:02:44] keep me from grieving the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:45] Yeah, he does. That's the purpose of the
[1:02:47] Holy Ghost. And when you grieve the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost, you feel the grieving of the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost and it brings you back in the
[1:02:51] repentance. But you have a choice to
[1:02:54] make. You've got free moral agency.
[1:02:56] You've got you're still a human vessel
[1:02:58] and you've got the will to do the will
[1:03:00] of God.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And Paul's telling you, will yourself to
[1:03:04] do the will of God.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:10] Amen.
[1:03:12] Praise God. Now let's go chapter five.
[1:03:21] Be therefore followers of God as dear
[1:03:23] children
[1:03:24] and walk in love as Christ also hath
[1:03:27] loved us and hath given himself for us
[1:03:29] an offering and sacrifice for God for a
[1:03:32] sweet smelling savor. But fornication
[1:03:34] and all uncleanness or covetousness, let
[1:03:36] it not once na be named among you as
[1:03:39] become a saint. neither filthiness, nor
[1:03:42] foolish talking, nor jesting, which are
[1:03:44] not convenient, but rather giving of
[1:03:46] thanks. For this you know that no
[1:03:48] whoreonger, no unclean person, no
[1:03:50] covetous man who is an idoltor hath an
[1:03:52] inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
[1:03:54] of God. Let no man deceive you with vain
[1:03:57] words. For because of these things
[1:03:59] cometh the wrath of God upon the
[1:04:01] children of disobedience. Be not ye
[1:04:03] therefore partakers with them. For ye
[1:04:05] were sometimes darkness, but now are you
[1:04:07] light in the Lord. walk as children of
[1:04:09] the light.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul opened their eyes and their
[1:04:13] understanding to grace. He opened their
[1:04:15] eyes to their their predestinated
[1:04:17] position in the adoption of sons in
[1:04:20] Jesus Christ. He tells them that they
[1:04:22] were accepted in the beloved all
[1:04:23] according to God's will. Everything was
[1:04:25] done even even you're saved by grace
[1:04:27] through works and by sorry saved by
[1:04:31] grace through faith and that not of
[1:04:32] yourselves is a gift of God. Amen. not
[1:04:34] of works lest any man should boast. But
[1:04:37] you're created in Christ Jesus unto good
[1:04:39] works. You're created in him to do
[1:04:40] something.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Unto good works. But he already ordained
[1:04:44] them. It's not up to you. He's already
[1:04:45] ordained you what you're going to walk
[1:04:46] in. Now that you've come to this
[1:04:49] position as a son of God, now stop doing
[1:04:52] that. Don't do that. Don't chase the
[1:04:53] world. Don't let anybody deceive you by
[1:04:55] their vain words. Amen. Th those people
[1:04:58] are not worthy of inheritance. They
[1:04:59] won't receive an inheritance. You walk
[1:05:02] worthy of the vocation wherewith you
[1:05:04] were called. What was that vocation? You
[1:05:06] were called to be sons and daughters of
[1:05:08] God. Now walk accordingly.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Paul's not saying you're ordained.
[1:05:15] You've got the Holy Ghost. You go figure
[1:05:17] it out.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; No, brother's so good to teach us we
[1:05:22] still live in a sticky cockab.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; We still live in a cockab flesh and
[1:05:27] sticky cocker nature that picks up
[1:05:29] things.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:31] It's why Paul would lay out in the book
[1:05:34] of Ephesians what you are by the grace
[1:05:37] of God and then what God wants you to
[1:05:39] do. Once you realize the grace of God
[1:05:41] and who you are, he wants you to be his
[1:05:43] son and he wants you to live like a son
[1:05:46] and he wants you to avoid the things
[1:05:48] that give a bad testimony and a poor
[1:05:50] representation of him and damage you and
[1:05:52] hurt you and hurt your testimony and and
[1:05:55] keep you from growing. That's right.
[1:05:59] Amen.
[1:06:01] We can never attain to the adoption
[1:06:03] living this way.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Also, we can't get the modernistic idea
[1:06:08] of the denominational systems that, you
[1:06:11] know, we're born again, we've got the
[1:06:12] Holy Ghost, we believe in Jesus. Amen.
[1:06:14] We're going to heaven, everything's
[1:06:16] fine, and we don't we don't need to say
[1:06:17] anything to anybody. Listen, don't
[1:06:19] forget that it was Paul. Paul, the
[1:06:22] Apostle Paul, who told the people,
[1:06:25] you've got sin among you in the
[1:06:26] Corinthians. sin that's so much not even
[1:06:29] named among the Gentiles that a man
[1:06:30] would have his father's wife. And he
[1:06:32] said, "And you're puffed up with vanity,
[1:06:35] you're puffed up with pride, thinking
[1:06:37] that that won't hurt us.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Leaving the sin among us won't hurt us."
[1:06:43] That's what he said. You're you're
[1:06:44] you're you're puffed up. Rather, you
[1:06:46] should be mourning, but you're puffed
[1:06:48] up. You just let it go. You don't do
[1:06:50] anything about it. And then what does
[1:06:51] Paul tell them to do about it? Paul
[1:06:53] tells them to take that person out of
[1:06:54] their midst and turn them over to the
[1:06:57] devil for the destruction of the flesh
[1:06:59] so that their soul can be saved.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; This is Paul's teaching.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; So this modernistic
[1:07:13] Leodysian gospel is not the Bible.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; It's not the word of God.
[1:07:20] I want to go uh go a little further
[1:07:22] here. Let's go down to the next reading.
[1:07:24] Let's go to verse 15,
[1:07:27] same chapter.
[1:07:30] See then that you walk circumspectly,
[1:07:33] not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the
[1:07:36] time because the days are evil.
[1:07:40] Paul's telling us how to spend our day.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] And he's telling us to walk
[1:07:46] circumspectly.
[1:07:48] Be reflective. Think not as fools but as
[1:07:51] wise redeeming the time because the days
[1:07:53] are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise but
[1:07:56] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:07:58] is. And be not drunk with wine wherein
[1:08:00] is excess, but be filled with the
[1:08:02] spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms
[1:08:05] and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
[1:08:07] and making melody in your heart to the
[1:08:08] Lord, giving thanks always for all
[1:08:11] things unto God and the Father in the
[1:08:13] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:16] tells us what not to do, but he also
[1:08:18] tells us what to do.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It's not just because we're sons of God,
[1:08:23] and it's not just because we have the
[1:08:24] Holy Ghost that we automatically know
[1:08:26] the right things to do. Paul was giving
[1:08:28] them instruction and dos and don'ts.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And he was doing it because they were
[1:08:37] called to adoption.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Not so they can earn merit with God, but
[1:08:42] because they were the children of God,
[1:08:45] called to a position in God and had to
[1:08:47] grow into a position of adoption. So
[1:08:49] that they could serve the purpose of God
[1:08:50] on earth. Amen. They had to know avoid
[1:08:53] this and lean to this, avoid this and do
[1:08:56] this.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] Let's go to uh verse 22.
[1:09:04] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own
[1:09:06] husbands as unto the Lord. Verse 25.
[1:09:10] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[1:09:12] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:09:15] for it. Let's go to chapter six.
[1:09:19] Children, obey your parents in the Lord.
[1:09:21] For this is right. Honor thy father and
[1:09:24] mother, which is the first commandment
[1:09:25] with promise, that it may be well. Did
[1:09:28] he just take them back to one of the ten
[1:09:29] commandments?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I thought we were done with the law.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Children, obey your parents and the
[1:09:44] Lord, for this is right. Honor thy
[1:09:45] father and my m thy mother, which is the
[1:09:47] first commandment with promise, that it
[1:09:49] may be well with thee, and thou mayest
[1:09:51] live long on the earth. And ye fathers,
[1:09:53] provoke not your children to wrath, but
[1:09:55] bring them up in the nurture and
[1:09:56] admonition of the Lord.
[1:09:59] Servants, be obedient to them that are
[1:10:01] your masters according to the flesh with
[1:10:03] fear and trembling and singleness of
[1:10:05] your heart as unto Christ. Not with eye
[1:10:08] service as men pleasers. He's telling
[1:10:10] you how to be an employee.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Not with eye service as men
[1:10:16] pleasers, but as the servants of Christ,
[1:10:17] doing the will of God from the heart.
[1:10:20] With good will, doing service as to the
[1:10:22] Lord, and not to men, knowing that
[1:10:25] whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the
[1:10:28] same shall be received of the Lord,
[1:10:30] whether he be bond or free. And ye
[1:10:33] masters, do the same thing unto them,
[1:10:35] forbearing, threatening, knowing that
[1:10:37] your master also is in heaven, neither
[1:10:40] is there respective person with him. He
[1:10:43] also taught us how to be a boss,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; how to be a servant, how to be a master,
[1:10:48] and he gave instructions. Amen. Listen,
[1:10:50] Paul wasn't leaving the church alone to
[1:10:52] figure it out on his own. He was
[1:10:54] anointed of the Holy Ghost to
[1:10:55] positionally place the church in the
[1:10:57] right order. And he's putting them in
[1:10:59] order. And to put them in order, he
[1:11:02] first has to tell them who they are by
[1:11:05] the grace of God. He's got to tell them,
[1:11:07] amen, that they've come to this position
[1:11:09] apart from works. That's what he does in
[1:11:11] Romans and Galatians. He's telling them
[1:11:13] that you never earned this. Amen. That
[1:11:15] this this this this is the mystery that
[1:11:17] God is going to include the Gentiles.
[1:11:19] You weren't even included in the law.
[1:11:21] You weren't even included. Amen. You
[1:11:23] didn't even know you were part of it.
[1:11:24] This is the great mystery that's been
[1:11:25] revealed by the grace of God that you're
[1:11:27] included, too. But you've been included
[1:11:29] under the measure of grace.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And he positionally places them in the
[1:11:35] in the predestinated will of God. Amen.
[1:11:38] not depending on their will, not waiting
[1:11:40] for their decision and not waiting for
[1:11:41] their actions. God had already done it
[1:11:43] according to the pleasure of his
[1:11:44] goodwill and adopted uh and
[1:11:46] predestinated to adoption of children by
[1:11:49] Jesus Christ and Ford knew where they
[1:11:51] would go and what they would be and what
[1:11:53] they were going to accomplish on the
[1:11:54] earth.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; That's a great place to start.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now that you've come to this,
[1:12:01] let me tell you how you should walk."
[1:12:03] Amen. So that you know how to possess
[1:12:05] your vessel. Right?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he's teaching that. Hey,
[1:12:08] listen. Wait. I'm going to teach you how
[1:12:10] to walk in the vocation where we've been
[1:12:12] called. You got to be circumspect. You
[1:12:14] got to be thoughtful. You got to forsake
[1:12:16] the old ways. You got to give up all the
[1:12:18] old things and the old lust and
[1:12:20] everything of the world. Amen. And
[1:12:22] you've got to come to uh uh the
[1:12:23] holiness. And you've got to come to
[1:12:25] sanctification. You've got to have a
[1:12:27] separated life. Amen. And you've got to
[1:12:29] live clean in your mind and clean in
[1:12:31] your body.
[1:12:33] Sing songs and meditate on the things of
[1:12:35] God. Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Dos and don'ts.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Not for salvation.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Not for merit.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Not for benefits.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; We already got all that.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; But so that we can fulfill our purpose
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; on the earth. So that we can be pleasing
[1:12:59] to the Lord. because what's pleasing to
[1:13:01] him to do his will.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; That's why David was a man after God's
[1:13:08] own heart. He told us in the book of
[1:13:10] Acts, I've chose David, a man after my
[1:13:12] own heart, who would do all my will.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to be after the heart of God
[1:13:17] and I want to please God. And if God
[1:13:20] thought enough to tell us what he likes
[1:13:22] and what he doesn't like, what he wants
[1:13:23] us to do and not wants us to do, then
[1:13:25] there's something there's a gratitude
[1:13:26] inside of me for the understanding of
[1:13:29] what grace really is. There's something
[1:13:31] in me that wants to do everything that
[1:13:33] he desires.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Not because I have to to make it. I
[1:13:37] already made it. Brother Bam told us
[1:13:39] that, you know, he doesn't He goes, I
[1:13:40] don't have to be preaching to go to
[1:13:42] heaven. I do that because I love the
[1:13:44] Lord and I love God's people.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; He exhausted himself. He extended
[1:13:49] himself. He went beyond his human
[1:13:51] strength. He went beyond. He he suffered
[1:13:53] rejection and ridicule and all kinds of
[1:13:55] hardships and financial trouble and and
[1:13:58] and legal trouble with the IRS and
[1:14:00] rejection from all of his friends. He
[1:14:02] went through all of that not because he
[1:14:04] had to to be saved, not because he had
[1:14:06] to to be a son of God, but because he
[1:14:09] had to because he loved God and this was
[1:14:11] God's plan for him and his will for him.
[1:14:13] And he wanted to do the will of God.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:19] And listen, God knew how to correct that
[1:14:20] prophet. Amen. When he got out of line,
[1:14:22] God says, "Don't do that."
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And he never took away his free moral
[1:14:28] agency. He said, he just said, "Don't do
[1:14:30] that.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You go up and fulfill your plans. Your
[1:14:33] wife's not going to stay up there.
[1:14:34] She'll leave and you'll become a bum.
[1:14:36] Don't do it."
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And he listened
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; to his heavenly father, to his Lord.
[1:14:44] Amen.
[1:14:46] I want to read
[1:14:48] a final list of dos. Paul gave us some
[1:14:51] dos, but he gave us a whole lot of
[1:14:53] don'ts.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; But here's another list of dues. And I
[1:14:56] want to close tonight on this list of
[1:14:58] dos.
[1:14:59] Chapter 6, verse 10.
[1:15:03] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[1:15:05] Lord and the power of his might.
[1:15:08] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:15:10] may be able to stand against the ws of
[1:15:12] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:15:14] flesh and blood, but against
[1:15:15] principalities, against powers, against
[1:15:18] the rulers of the darkness of this
[1:15:19] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:15:22] high places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:15:25] whole armor of God, that you may be able
[1:15:27] to withstand in the evil day, and having
[1:15:29] done all to stand. Stand therefore,
[1:15:32] having your loins gird about with the
[1:15:34] truth, and having on the breastplate of
[1:15:36] righteousness, and your feet shaw with
[1:15:38] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[1:15:41] Above all, take the shield of faith,
[1:15:42] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:15:44] all the fiery darts of the wicked. And
[1:15:46] take the helmet of salvation, and the
[1:15:48] sword of the spirit, which is the word
[1:15:51] of God, praying always with all prayer
[1:15:54] and supplication in the spirit, and
[1:15:56] watching there unto with all
[1:15:57] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:16:00] saints.
[1:16:02] That's a whole pile of dues.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And I want to do them all.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; What's he telling him to do? Prepare
[1:16:11] yourself for spiritual warfare.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; That's what he's been instructing them
[1:16:16] in all along.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; He's been telling them a lot of things
[1:16:20] that are natural. Don't do. But there's
[1:16:21] a reason behind all of it. Don't do
[1:16:23] this. There's a reason because it brings
[1:16:25] you down because it it it it you lose
[1:16:28] your separation from the world and your
[1:16:29] sanctification. You ruin your testimony.
[1:16:32] You trouble your mind. There's all kinds
[1:16:33] of reasons for not doing all of these
[1:16:35] things. when he comes around to the
[1:16:37] things to do, there's a good reason to
[1:16:38] do all of these things, too. Because
[1:16:40] this is all about spiritual warfare.
[1:16:42] Because you've been called to be
[1:16:44] overcomers. You're overcomers in Christ
[1:16:46] Jesus, and you're going to be
[1:16:47] overcomers, fleshing out the overcoming
[1:16:50] Lord in this world because that's what
[1:16:52] he wants us to do.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; But he says, he doesn't say just, you
[1:16:59] know, become a Christian and just wait
[1:17:02] till, you know, a helmet drops on your
[1:17:04] head.
[1:17:06] and something in your hand.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be active."
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; This is something we do. Put this on.
[1:17:14] Amen. I love how he says, "Finally, my
[1:17:17] brethren, be strong in the Lord, in the
[1:17:19] power of his might." Amen. Have a
[1:17:21] revelation of what God's given us. Get
[1:17:23] into the word. Amen. Get into the
[1:17:26] message of the hour and be strong in the
[1:17:28] power of the Lord. Amen. And be strong
[1:17:31] in the Lord and the power of his might.
[1:17:33] Amen. because this word has restored his
[1:17:35] power. It's restored his life. It's
[1:17:37] restored the Holy Spirit back into the
[1:17:39] church. Be strong in it.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Because we don't wrestle against
[1:17:44] anything on this earth. It's all
[1:17:46] spiritual. There's spirits behind all of
[1:17:48] these things that Paul mentioned.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; So, we have to take the word and cut
[1:17:54] through it all.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And he tells us to be proactive.
[1:17:58] There's something for us to do. Now you
[1:18:01] see why brother Bam said he was a
[1:18:02] legalist.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; But he said he was a Calvinist.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Is he a Calvinist or a legalist?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; He said both.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Now you look at the book of Ephesians.
[1:18:13] Is Ephesians grace or is Ephesians
[1:18:16] works?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Well, it just depends on if you're first
[1:18:20] half or second half.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; First half is grace. Second half is
[1:18:23] works. Amen. Because why, brother Benam
[1:18:26] said the the the Yeah. Let's I want to
[1:18:28] go back and look at this. Brother
[1:18:29] Franco. I don't know if you can quickly
[1:18:31] pull up the PowerPoint slide. I want to
[1:18:33] look at one more quote as we finish up.
[1:18:36] Oh, good.
[1:18:40] Yeah. Right here. One went to seed this
[1:18:43] way, the other went to seed that way.
[1:18:44] But I think the book of Ephesians bring
[1:18:46] them both right back and puts them in
[1:18:47] the stump where they belong. So, I
[1:18:49] really like the book of Ephesians. It
[1:18:51] keep it kind of keeps us straightened
[1:18:53] out, brethren, in our theology, doesn't
[1:18:55] it?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love the book of Ephesians
[1:19:01] more now than I ever have because God is
[1:19:04] telling us what he's done for us and now
[1:19:06] what he expects us to do.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Does God have an expectation?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Does God expect a certain amount of
[1:19:16] conduct? Does God expect us to give our
[1:19:19] lives in obedience to his word to
[1:19:21] manifest? Yes. God has an expectation.
[1:19:23] But God hasn't left us all by ourselves
[1:19:26] to try to meet his expectation. He's
[1:19:28] given us his spirit. He's given us his
[1:19:29] power. And by his power, we can do what
[1:19:32] he's asked us to do. We can go where
[1:19:34] he's asked us to go. We can manifest
[1:19:36] what he's asked us to manifest. Not by
[1:19:39] not by uh our strength, not by our
[1:19:41] power, but by his spirit.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; The Lord has given us in this age. And
[1:19:46] he's told us what he wants and he's
[1:19:48] given us the spirit to do it. And when
[1:19:49] we get it wrong of his spirit, he can
[1:19:52] correct us. Amen. And bring us back in
[1:19:54] line and bring us to a quick repentance.
[1:19:55] Brother Bram said that's also the work
[1:19:57] of the Holy Ghost. It's not as though
[1:19:59] we're born again, have the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:01] and we always do everything right. We do
[1:20:03] things wrong all the time, but part of
[1:20:05] the work of the Holy Ghost is to signal
[1:20:07] you when you've done wrong, to bring a
[1:20:09] conviction in your heart and drive you
[1:20:11] back to what God wants.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So, he's not left us alone. That's what
[1:20:16] the whole first half of Ephesians is
[1:20:18] about. This isn't about you by yourself.
[1:20:20] It's what God chose to do through you,
[1:20:23] what God wants to do with you. that what
[1:20:25] your life is all about. Amen. This is
[1:20:27] all for you to accomplish on this earth.
[1:20:29] God has ordained you. He's predestinated
[1:20:32] you. He's took care of the sacrifice.
[1:20:34] Amen. Everything is already done. You're
[1:20:37] the one. Now you go and do it.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; How? By the power that he released at
[1:20:43] Calvary to come back into you to give
[1:20:45] you the power to do it.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; But we're going to have to will to do
[1:20:50] the will of God. We're going to have to
[1:20:51] be deliberate in our attentions. We're
[1:20:53] going to have to choose to do what he
[1:20:57] wants us to do.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Because even with the anointing of the
[1:21:01] Holy Ghost, he does not take away free
[1:21:04] choice.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; He helps us sometimes make the right
[1:21:09] choice
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; through external circumstances,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; but he never takes it away.
[1:21:16] And I'm so glad
[1:21:19] I'm so glad there's something I can do
[1:21:21] for him.
[1:21:23] He's done so much for me.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; He redeemed me. He saved me. He
[1:21:29] predestinated me unto adoption. He
[1:21:32] foresaw me crossing the finish line
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; because he wanted me to cross the finish
[1:21:38] line. He ordained it. He predestinated.
[1:21:41] He made everything possible for it to
[1:21:44] come to pass.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:46] And now my appreciation of that
[1:21:51] is everything he said don't do, I don't
[1:21:54] want to do.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Everything he said to do, that's what I
[1:21:59] want to do.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I mess it up on a daily basis, but I
[1:22:04] still that's what I want.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That's where my heart is. That's where
[1:22:07] my greatest desire is to be a son that
[1:22:09] brings satisfaction to my father.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That pleases him. I want the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] to give a good report.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Do you?
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost to go. I don't
[1:22:19] want to be the spoiled child who knows
[1:22:21] my dad will never correct me. I can go
[1:22:23] do whatever I want. No. I want to be the
[1:22:25] son who's diligent because I love my
[1:22:27] dad. I love my father. I love what he's
[1:22:30] done for me. I love who he is. I love
[1:22:31] all about him. And what I want to do is
[1:22:34] I want to be pleasing to him. And I want
[1:22:36] so bad the Holy Ghost, like brother
[1:22:38] Benham traumatizes, the Holy Ghost to go
[1:22:40] back, the tutor back to the father and
[1:22:42] say, "Father, hey, look, look at your
[1:22:44] son. Look at what he's doing. He's doing
[1:22:46] it just like you asked, just like you
[1:22:48] taught, just like you wanted him to do
[1:22:50] it." Friends, that that's the greatest
[1:22:52] desire of my heart is that the Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost can give that report of me.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And I can't even do it without the grace
[1:22:59] he gives me to do it. But I want to
[1:23:01] choose that grace, accept that grace,
[1:23:03] allow that grace to operate in my life
[1:23:05] because I can stop it. I can choose to
[1:23:07] do something else. I can take my own
[1:23:09] will and my own desire and I can push
[1:23:11] that power of grace down and do what I
[1:23:14] want to do because he's left me that
[1:23:15] privilege.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; But oh God, no. Help me, Lord. I want to
[1:23:20] take my will, my desire, my lesson, and
[1:23:22] I want to push it down and let grace
[1:23:24] have its place
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together.
[1:23:31] So, do you have your theology
[1:23:32] straightened out in the book of
[1:23:33] Ephesians?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; If you ever get confused, go back to
[1:23:38] Ephesians.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; If you ever get discouraged, read the
[1:23:41] first three chapters.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And I suggest you read them first.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; So, you have the courage to read the
[1:23:49] last three chapters.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; If you put the first three before the
[1:23:54] last three, then it would be all your
[1:23:56] deeds and your works and your obedience
[1:23:57] that get you grace.
[1:23:59] But oh, what an order to the word. He
[1:24:01] put grace and predestination and his
[1:24:04] will first.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And then he told us what's pleasing to
[1:24:08] him.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; By the time we get to chapter 4, our
[1:24:12] hearts are so full and bubbling over.
[1:24:14] Whatever he tells me to do, I can't wait
[1:24:16] to do because I know who I am and what
[1:24:18] he's done for me.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, abundant grace.
[1:24:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[1:24:28] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful for
[1:24:30] your word, Lord. God, it's so rich. It's
[1:24:34] so alive. It's so true, Lord. And God,
[1:24:38] when we read it, Lord, by the light that
[1:24:40] you shined on it through this message,
[1:24:42] you've illuminated the truth. You've
[1:24:44] you've cut through all the confusion and
[1:24:47] brought us to the light. Lord, you shine
[1:24:50] the light on your word so that we could
[1:24:52] see what what it is you're trying to
[1:24:54] teach us, what it is you're trying to
[1:24:56] show us.
[1:24:57] I say, "Oh God, help us, Lord. Help us
[1:25:01] to realize what you have done for us.
[1:25:04] God, bring us to the first half of
[1:25:06] Ephesians and solidly plant in our heart
[1:25:09] that grace you had before us when you
[1:25:11] accepted us. You made us accepted in the
[1:25:13] beloved by your own pleasure, by your
[1:25:16] own will, by your own desire.
[1:25:19] apart from our works. Before we could do
[1:25:22] good or evil on our worst day, you still
[1:25:25] had chosen to place us in Christ.
[1:25:29] You've lifted us up and seated us in
[1:25:31] heavenly places with Christ. When he
[1:25:34] rose, we rose.
[1:25:36] And God, we're just now beginning to
[1:25:38] realize these things, Lord. And God,
[1:25:41] bring us to the full revelation and the
[1:25:44] full impact of Ephesians 1:3.
[1:25:48] And may that impact in our lives bring
[1:25:52] us to a desire to manifest four through
[1:25:55] six.
[1:25:57] That we can give our lives to you and
[1:25:59] that your spirit can work through us and
[1:26:01] that we can exercise our will to do your
[1:26:03] will. That you would empower us,
[1:26:05] strengthen us, give us revelation, give
[1:26:08] us understanding, show us what you want
[1:26:10] us to do. Teach us what is the right way
[1:26:13] to live in this end time. And Lord, we
[1:26:16] will give you room to work in us. And we
[1:26:18] will align our our heart with your heart
[1:26:21] and our will with your will if you'll
[1:26:24] just come and strengthen us and give us
[1:26:26] power. We surrender it all to you, Lord,
[1:26:29] and ask that you would take control of
[1:26:31] us and manifest yourself through us. We
[1:26:34] love you. We love you for the
[1:26:36] instructions. We love you for the
[1:26:37] teaching. We love you for the message of
[1:26:39] the hour to straighten out all the
[1:26:41] confusion.
[1:26:43] And God, I pray that you would bring us
[1:26:44] into that true understanding of grace
[1:26:49] and works so that our life will come
[1:26:51] into that place
[1:26:54] where Romans and James is both true
[1:26:57] inside of us.
[1:27:00] That we're that your righteous has
[1:27:01] imputed us by faith and we're as
[1:27:03] righteous as you're righteous by faith.
[1:27:07] but that our faith has been made perfect
[1:27:10] because you sent us a power of the Holy
[1:27:12] Ghost that we yielded to and surrendered
[1:27:15] to. And that power worked in us all your
[1:27:17] works and obedience to your word and
[1:27:20] became the completion or the fulfillment
[1:27:24] of your great purpose in our lives. so
[1:27:26] that our works anointed by your spirit
[1:27:30] with our will engaged
[1:27:32] will complete or make the faith perfect.
[1:27:37] That's our desire, Lord. That all you've
[1:27:39] desired for us to manifest in this end
[1:27:41] time will be manifest. That all the
[1:27:44] works that you've before ordained for us
[1:27:45] to do that we'll do and we'll do them
[1:27:48] yielded to you. Lord, we love you. We
[1:27:50] ask that you would help us, Lord. For we
[1:27:52] know that this is the final voice to the
[1:27:54] final age. And it has to do with the
[1:27:56] lives that we live. And it has to be the
[1:27:58] word on display. And it has to come from
[1:28:00] a heart of obedience. And God, I want to
[1:28:03] give you that heart of obedience
[1:28:05] tonight. Forgive me for my failures, my
[1:28:08] shortcomings.
[1:28:10] Lord, forgive me for my laziness, my
[1:28:12] spiritual lethargy. Forgive me, Lord.
[1:28:15] And God, would you come and empower me
[1:28:17] aresh to be more diligent and more
[1:28:19] thoughtful, more circumspect as I walk
[1:28:21] in this life? And my I do what you've
[1:28:24] asked me to do. And I do it with a
[1:28:26] willing heart, with joy in my heart, and
[1:28:28] with thanksgiving. Help me, Lord.
[1:28:31] Provide your spirit. And I yield my
[1:28:34] body. I ask that you'd help us, Lord, in

[1:38:19] How could he desire
[1:38:23] to have fellowship

[1:38:29] There must be some more within
[1:38:34] that only he can see.
[1:38:39] I pray dear Lord
[1:38:42] change my life and give it all to thee
[1:38:51] and grant that every day
[1:38:57] you'll commune with me.
[1:39:04] Did not our hearts burn within us
[1:39:09] as he talked to us by the way?
[1:39:14] He opened to us the scriptures,
[1:39:19] the word revealed to us today.
[1:39:24] We can see the word in person.
[1:39:29] He's among us alive today.
[1:39:34] He opened our understanding

[1:40:26] How could he desire
[1:40:30] to have fellowship

[1:40:45] I pray, dear Lord, please take my life.
[1:40:50] I give it all to thee.
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:58] Grant that every day
[1:41:03] you'll commune with me. Did not our
[1:41:07] hearts,
[1:41:09] did not our hearts burn within us
[1:41:14] as he talked to us by the way.
[1:41:20] He opened to us the scriptures,

[1:42:08] I prayed, "Dear Lord, please take my
[1:42:12] life. Live in me and I in me.
[1:42:21] Grant that every day
[1:42:26] you'll commune with me.
