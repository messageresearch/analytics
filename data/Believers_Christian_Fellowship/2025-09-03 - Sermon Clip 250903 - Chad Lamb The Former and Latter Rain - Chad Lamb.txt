TRANSCRIPT
========================================
This experience of former and latter reign, it took place in the prophet's ministry &gt;&gt; because it fell in the end time. It fell through that prophetic ministry. The former and latter rain fell together. So we can stand here and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes, &gt;&gt; in your ears. It's it's it's already done. But listen, we each have our own experience of former and latter reign. Every bride member has an experience of former and latter reign because I wasn't there in 1962, 63, 60. I came along much later in 1999 in year 2000. But oh, praise God. I had a revival when I saw the restoration of the word when I realized that what had happened to my Bible and what my church was teaching me was wrong and what the truth was. I had a revival. Amen. But then I got stuck between two revivals. Yes, &gt;&gt; I realized what the truth was. I realized what the word was. I realized what the church that happened to the church. I realized that there was a restoration. Amen. But then what about me? Amen. Now all of a sudden I was coming back lining up with the word. Baptized, right? Understood the nature of God. Amen. Understood the church ages and all that. But I had to have a latter reign experience myself. I had to have the breath of God descend upon me. I had to realize what the mystery was laying under those seals. And the great mystery of God under those seals was that I was part of that being. I was part of that life and his life wanted to express in me. &gt;&gt; And talk about a breath, friends. Talk about another word of prophecy, another boost. Amen. Now she's standing on her feet and marching to Zion. &gt;&gt; And this latter former and latter rain, yes, it's history. Yes, it fell in the same day. Amen. But it's still available to anybody who still needs a revival, an awakening. And until all of the bride is awakened. You can still have a former latter rain experience, friends. &gt;&gt; You young people can have a former latter rain experience. Don't get stuck between two revivals. It's all dying down. It's all getting dry. If you're in that place and you believe the word and believe what you've been taught and you know the restoration of the word, I encourage you, keep feeding on the message, keep praying for revelation because there's a latter rain that has to come next. And if not, you'll just be a dead church member standing on your feet looking like an army member but with no life in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This revival is still available to the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I had my experience, but I'm not done with the latter rain yet. I love it when he breathes on me fresh. I love it when it comes fresh again. When I go back to the message of the hour and revelation starts pouring in all over again. It thrills my soul. I'm not done with my latter rain revival. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; because it's through that revival he's going to bring me into every promised work and every manifestation he wants to do. And it's not going to be me doing one bit of it because he left his work to do in her in this specific time. And now he has to do it in and through the bride. That's why he's brought his life back, his breath back, his spirit back &gt;&gt; so that he can have a vessel to work in. And I just want to be that vessel. [Music] I don't want to mess it up by adding my own works. I don't know what he wants to do next. I don't know how to do what he wants to do. I have no capability in my flesh to do and in my mind to figure it out. But I want him to have preeminence because that's the great purpose he's looking for in this day. That preeminence in a group of people &gt;&gt; so that through that revival, he can bring the final manifestation of his life on this earth.
