amen oh I'm so thankful to be here to worship god with you all so thankful to have brother Danny with us you all know brother Danny delmundo he's no stranger he's been here several times and him and I have been friends for I think almost 15 years now and and uh I've really grown to appreciate my brother I've watched him in many places ministering and I've seen what God has used him for and what uh what he's been willing to surrender himself to be used for and I thank God for that you know brother Danny's been a pastor now for almost 30 years and he's traveled all over and God has used him he's been a tool in the hand of God to bring the message to many places he was instrumental God used him in bringing the message to Indonesia and getting the work established there also into Japan in Myanmar and now he has a new open door just beginning in uh South Korea and I've seen him willing to leave and willing to go and willing to surrender and start from scratch with almost nothing and seen God bless it and bring fruit from the ministry and so it's been a real encouragement to me to watch my friend and learn from him and it's been a real blessing to just be associated with brother Dany and his family we know them all quite well and his home church we know them well and it's just quite a testimony there's quite a light that's shining there and I thank God for it it's always so nice that you know know we've had the opportunity to help him in some small way to go a little further Maybe cover a few expenses and it's so nice that he'll come by and stop in and check in with us and we can get to hear from him because we want to continue to help him and bless him and maybe ease some of his load if we can as God uses him to minister this precious message in Asia amen so I'm excited to have him with us again for visit excited to hear the word this morning and to get my portion I want our brother he's familiar with us but I want him to be able to relax I want to be able to just relax and drop back into that channel of inspiration where he can relax and switch gears and God can take over and I know to help him do that is if we can pull on the word it'll help him switch into that gear so I want to do my part and make it easy for our brother amen so we just want to welcome brother Danny now we want him to take his Liberty we'll invite him with the song for the John we are stand [Music] in on Holy Ground and I know that there are angels all around so let us pray [Music] Jesus name for we are standing in his presence on Amen Hallelujah without the presence of the Lord amen this place no matter how beautiful it is is just a regular ordinary ground amen but thank God for his presence that makes it so special Hallelujah so I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and uh I really appreciate being here and uh it's been uh Second Home for us for many years amen and yet every time I stand behind the P pit amen my niece uh keep on shaking but anyhow amen that makes us uh so dependent upon him we cannot do anything without him and so there's nothing we can preach on without this message uh that the Lord has bestowed upon us and using a prophet for this generation and I thank God Amen Hallelujah so i g bring you greetings from my family and uh my little congregation back there in Metro Manila amen our church uh uh I believe most of them are uh streaming right now amen I have prayer warriors on the other side Hallelujah so thank you so much uh brother Chad and uh the family uh brother jeriah and his wife sister Rebecca who picked me up uh from the airport and uh stayed overnight with brother Jonathan and the family and uh uh staying with Brother Kyle the family uh ban with us Kelly amen so I appreciate everyone amen appreciate everyone the whole BCF family uh we really appreciate you and uh thank you for your trust your confidence your prayers is very much appreciated Hallelujah so without further Ado we would like to go on the reading of the scripture uh in Zechariah we're going to use this as our uh text and of course we're going to use few more scriptures to drive our Point by God's help Amen in in the book of Zechariah chap 4 we will read verses 9 and 10 I know this is very much familiar to everyone he said in verse 9 the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads in prayer dear heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity once again to minister your word and Lord there's nothing I can say there's nothing I can do except Lord you open this mouth and speak your words through this lips of clay Lord Lord and uh your people have come here under certain expectation oh God not from a man but from you that we will feed on so God once again we thank you we commit this service into your Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful name amen God bless you you may now be seated amen so the uh the scriptures that we have just read I know this is uh very familiar but we just have to talk few portions of that of it and uh may the Lord uh uh give us something that we will be able to bring home today amen hallelujah so we see that the background of this uh scriptures is the restoration of uh of God's Temple and it says that the foundation of this house his hands not the hands of men but it's the hand of God Amen because God use men uh Inspire them to do something to accomplish for his own glory amen so uh the prophet of God said his hands shall also finish it so he is the author and the finisher of our faith amen he he anything that he has started is going to perform to complete everything that he has started because he's the author he's the finisher he's the alpha amen and he's the Omega he's the beginning and the end so uh so God called us to bring us to a certain place a certain condition a certain atmosphere where he will bring Perfection unto us amen so he said now and and uh he said his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who ha despised the day of small things amen so if we are you know uh I have met lots of Brethren uh in this in this assembly that are doing construction uh by the Elmer and the rest of the Brethren you know so you see uh when we come to the end when we come to the last part of what we are doing whether it's a construction whether it's a simple project when we come to the End Amen uh the last part the last stage of what we are doing amen we we give details amen we are H applying the last the final touches amen and and and and when we come to the finishing touches there are little things that though little they are important and they give detail to the project and everything every every last T every Last Detail that you put in amen uh gives a clear picture of what was in the mind of somebody amen who designed it from the beginning from the very start from from uh orchestrating from the beginning to uh uh to its end so every little detail amen adds Beauty and I believe it's the same thing with the message of the hour we are in the last stage we are in the final part of our journey that everything that we do no matter how little it is amen it adds Beauty it is important brother bam said you know it's not the big things it's not the great things amen that we do but it's the little things that we live undone amen uh so it is very important so H H I would like to tell you also this morning that you are as important no matter how little you are amen your space in the church your portion amen the uhh the seat that occupy amen it is so important because it adds detail to the last stage of our journey amen so now just like you know when when when we remember Noah you know we knowing Noah's like we have said before Noah preached for 120 years amen but I never I don't and will never believe that Noah preached the same thing all throughout these 120 years amen he he he didn't go in the morning and say okay my my my precious family amen uh God said it will rain 40 days and 40 nights amen and then the whole day is going to repeat all these things and then the following day amen it's 120 years amen and 360 days in a year amen so I believe amen that the uh it took 120 years because there's so much detail in the ark of Noah amen every detail amen the piece of wood the uh uh the the kind of Timber everything so every day amen every day when they wake up amen there's always something new amen that that not just something new that they listen to but something new that they have to do on that particular day so they have accomplished so much in 120 years of Noah's Ministry amen because of the details Hallelujah so until they come amen that that that the Last Detail the last word that was being preached by Noah at that time and that Last Detail Hallelujah and that that shut the door amen and started in all the doubts all these uh uh uh Skeptics amen that that you know uh put so much uh uh words amen bringing sarcasm and insult to the family to no and his family amen we're done amen when that last and final detail amen has been laid down Hallelujah so that's why we would like to uh uh give a title on this sermon amen it's just a piece amen so just little it's the last pie piece of the puzzle amen so it's the last piece of the puzzle so we're familiar with that brother bam made mention about uh about the pule that when we place uh something we might uh he said you know we might have a complete uh uh materials of everything uh we might have a cow a tree and a green pasture amen but if you misplay something and you put the cow on top of the tree amen it's horrible amen it's not the right you it's not the right picture amen so it's the same thing with this message of the hour when we misplace something the scripture is complete amen the Bible is complete but it must be every every piece every portion every verse of the scripture must be placed in his rightful position so that we will be able Amen to see the complete picture of what God's perfect plan is amen and this is the problem you know that's why people can can look at the scripture reading the same Bible and they can present three Gods amen they can present you know three persons and then they believe that there is one God it's because amen the pieces are not properly properly placed amen and brother B said it takes the Holy Spirit it takes the Holy Ghost amen so that we will be able to place and position every piece of it thank God Hallelujah so now uh to be able to to communicate my my thought this morning I would like to uh uh us to uh talk about a a a parable that the prophet also used Amen in Luke chap 15 uh there is a parable here and this is the parable of the lost coin amen so it says here in verse 8 either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece do not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she had found it she call it her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost amen so uh brother bam said you know uh this is the message of restoration and uh when we speak about restoration uh it is bringing things in its original condition in its uh every piece in its original Place amen and it's also placing or restoring back in its original condition but uh there's another scripture here that the prophet of God used in relation to this Parable and it says in it we can look at that in Galatians 5 verse 22 it said but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentle goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law okay and of course we see there nine gifts amen and brother BR I'm referring in Galatians 5 in the message the second coming of the Lord he said if you want to look it up look in Galatians 5 you'll find out that that woman represented the church amen and the church in a and is an spouse wife to Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 he repeat it again which is love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience that is the tablet that's supposed to be worn in the church amen so I wonder amen if if if you know brother brandham is I believe is telling us something here so it's not something this is not accident amen that there's only nine gifts and the prophet of God because the prophet is a Seer amen the prophet can see things that are on on on ordinary eyes amen can see amen and so referring to Galatians 5 and then he referred that to the same Parable amen that the church is uh uh being spoused to wife he said that this Parable has something to do with the second coming of the Lord amen so that means there is something lacking in Galatians 5 and no one Among Us have seen that before but thank God we have a prophet in this generation Hallelujah so that's why many churches many Circles of religious groups you know can always repair the scriptures in amen and and and and repair to the nine gifts of the Spirit amen but not realizing that something you know something is missing and here is where it comes to Amen to place everything to make it complete amen the last piece must be placed so we can see the whole picture and I believe the prophet of God has a reason in in this Parable and the Lord help us amen so now going back to the scripture that we have just read Nas made mention now he said now in the last in the in in uh in this day in the in the book of church ages he said it is very evident that the word they refers to men thus we see that the eyes of the Lord in this instance are men of course they will be anointed men Men full of the Holy Ghost for God's Ministries are not in the power of men but of the Holy Ghost putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps amen so it's very clear here amen that the seven spirits of god mentioned in the book of Zariah also being made mention in the Book of Revelation amen H uh uh do not in any way represent seven gods or seven you know but they are the same Spirit of the same God and mean he said it is a continual representation of himself through these seven men amen so he said the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous Ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely they are his eyes and they are his lamps another statement for this purpose amen days of the finishing touches now watch there is a lot of truth lost out there amen and he said why were others compromise on truth but these seventh angel don't compromise on nothing can you say Amen to that amen he had not in any way compromised the truth and then he said he gathers up all the Loose Ends gathers them all up and at his sounding all the mysteries of God should be finish oh God send him all of the Hidden Mysteries were finished when he it was revealed to him by what if these are hidden mysteries the man will have to be a prophet amen amen amen he's not just a reformer he not just you know but he must be a prophet and then uh we just get through and see that the prophet that would come in the last age we would would would be that great Elijah that we've been looking for of course we know we know uh uh who that is now another statement for the days of the finishing touches he said now these stars are falling into their constellation back Yonder that angel coming and said as John was sent to wind up all the Old Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ a message am that we have been hearing amen a message will wind up the Loose Ends and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming and this is the message of the last days amen amen so this message amen being being spoken by the messenger of this generation its very purpose is to introduce the Messiah amen amen hallelujah so we're not we're not just here to to see the sign no but we need to go where the sign is pointing us amen so and let me put a scripture on that in in Amos 5:8 it said seek him that maketh the Seven Stars and Orion Hallelujah and Orion is the the the constellation and out of the many stars amen and in other scriptures amen God knows how many stars there are Amen in the constellation out there in heaven amen and God gave them names so if God was able to give them names and we have you know millions of stars out there and God knew each of of them and don't forget amen that one of those stars represent you one of those stars represent me amen so when when when God said Abraham look at those you know look at those can you number the dust of the earth amen Abraham could not but God knew how many Hallelujah if he know how many hairs we have in our head God knows how many dust there are in the coast amen and he said now amen look at the dust and then and then then God said now God Abraham from the dash you look up amen if you cannot number those uh uh D can you number those stars in heaven amen but and and God said Hallelujah those stars are the numbers of your seeds amen so from dust to Stars so that's the same thing with us amen from th we come amen from the natural birth we come but God amen from the dust amen he lifted us up so that we can see our representation up there in heaven and we know who we are amen and that's why we know how to conduct ourselves in this generation glory to God so understand so that is the reason why amen we we uh uh uh uh we recognize and you know we those three Magi were not able to see amen the Messiah that was born in their generation if they did not follow the star yes so how can you find the pure word in this generation that will send that will bring us prepare us to the Rapture if you don't recognize the sign the prophet but as I say we just don't stop there amen but as this the the parable said seek diligently amen and so in Amos 58 he said seek Him amen that maketh the Stars seek him that identifies the Stars Hallelujah you know in the Book of Revelation you know in his right hand there's seven stars and in this right hand the prophet of God said there very reason why they are in the hand of him because they were personally picked by the Lord himself and because they are in his right hand God is obligated to take care of them to equip them Hallelujah and thank God Amen we are identified at least one of those Stars so no one can PL us out of the the the the hand of God and so you know that's why he said to some of the church that I preach on he said you know people nobody plck them out of the hand of God they plck themselves amen because they fail or they refuse to recognize the stars in their generation the star in their generation amen so if you are identified thank God I am I'm identified with one of those Seven Stars so no one can pla me out of his hand because I am fully represented in the arm of the Lord hallelujah and so now that's the reason we seek Him diligently seek Him seek the person amen amen amen seek him that maketh the Seven Stars in ryion and said now so you see uh uh uh let me quote and again brother bam said now we see Paul a little old hook NOS Jew on his Road arrogant going down to bind them people making that noise and shouting and things throwing them in jail making Havoc of the church Stone Steen witness to it and held their coats he was a terror how would God ever choose a man like that Amen in man's choosing God uh uh Paul failed to meet man's requirement to be among the apostles prise God to man according to man's standards and choosing he cannot feel the missing part among the 12 apostles amen and said and look the Bishops all the apostles they said we'll make a choice somebody to take judas's place and who they choose they chose Maas Maas I believe it's called Maas yeah Matias they chose him by casting lots and not one thing did he ever do he seemed to be a righteous man and God chose the most high-tempered meanest guy there was in the land to take his place and said it's a paradox but that's what God does paradox amen it's hard to understand but that's what God that that's how God do it now if we if we read in in the background here the apostles they were looking for something thing and because now they had Judas all these years amen and Jesus from the very beginning knew am that Judas was a son of predition but Jesus Jesus knowing who he was am he could stand a Judas among the group and even gave him position in the church and God makes no mistakes he knew what he was doing amen so he gave that position so that eventually at the end Judas will expose himself Hallelujah and so now but if you're going to see when when Judas was out of of his place and now they had to choose and and in verse 15 in in in chapter 1 let's see uh one more on this background said and in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about 120 and he said men and Brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost but the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas which was guide to them that took Jesus and he said for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry amen so now when there people in this generation that had obtained part they enjoyed a part of this ministry but later on they fulfilled as the scripture said like you know amen The Same Spirit and and in verse 25 he said that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place wow amen so this shows us that this person all throughout he was he was occupying a space that did not belong to him that's right amen amen and God permitted that to happen for a certain purpose that he should be betay that he should be betrayed amen that he will be rejected that he will be you know H uh uh brought into into the court and he will be accused wrongly amen so that the very purpose of him coming to Earth to redeem his own must be fulfilled so all things work together for forgive for to them that love him amen so you see now for for for h h all those years Judas amen occupied a space occupied a portion in the ministry but this portion did not belong to him in any way and it's not the other disciples that kick him out amen it's the situation it's the circumstances amen until he was exposed later on so of course and now they realize they miss a peace it's no longer complete amen and they had to do something amen and so they did the right thing in verse 24 and they prayed and said thou Lord which knowest the hearts of all men you whether of these two thou Hast chosen amen so there is a component there that disciple the disciples did they prayed and they asked the Lord to lead them to the to their choices amen but among the two amen but that's the only choices they gave God Amen sometimes we put God in a certain place you know we put God in a certain box and we give him option we limit God to what he can do in our lives amen because we want to accomplish something we want to do something and we're praying yeah amen but actually we're praying and forcing God to choose among our own options and God gave it to them yeah right but the timing was wrong amen and the options they gave God was limited hallelujah amen so at least God gave them the better am Ong the two amen hallelujah so your election is coming amen and and there's only two choices amen but you know uh uh we were talking about you know whoever whoever uh wins the election in in the United States amen I said this this is just me and said you know it's they will they will fulfill prophecy Amen in some way God has placed America amen that you you or the whole world is left with nothing with no choice but to fulfill a prophecy amen if Cala wins amen the woman president is literally fulfill bu if Donald wins others will say this going to be the last [Laughter] Trump no choice amen because there's only two choices amen but you see amen God you know he he's going to place us in a certain position we will be placed in a corner where we have no option amen but thank God Amen we realize who we are we know what time we are living in and we identify ourselves in the scripture and we are fulfilling prophecy amen so now you see now he said God but you know in the you know we know the rest of the story amen butam said Matias was men's Choice amen but it came later that God's choice was Paul amen but Paul could not meet human standard because you know he was a witness he he he consented on the death of the first Marty amen he's not he he he could not be as as good as Matias amen but God is absolute amen God Amen uh uh uh God is absolute so now to give us a a a a a a hint in the message hear ye himm he said in in in paragraph 10 he said but there's not one scripture in the entire Bible but what will dve tail and connect with the next scripture every bit of it is one great big picture all the way from the Garden of Eden and the way of Calvary back to the Garden again just one great beautiful picture so the Bible amen when we talk about a a love story amen there is one great picture the greatest love story and amen and and and that is between the bride and the bridegroom everything falls into uh into its place to fulfill God's greatest love story amen so he said from Genesis Amen to Revelation and I do not mean to be Sac religious he said by making this mistake or this statement and if it's a mistake God for forgive me but it's like a jigo puzzle that you have to putting it together you have the Holy Spirit you have to have the Holy Spirit to put it together just like on the jigo pule you get the picture to one side and look at the picture and then place it according to the way the picture looks based on God's point of view yeah amen that's why we always go back Amen to the original pattern where God H uh ordained according to his perfect will amen amen that's why in this generation amen we don't stop we seek amen though we we seek him that maketh those Stars amen we don't stop on the prophet per se amen but we move on we keep pressing on until we get un into the mind of God Amen where we where we are being restored not only uh uh back to the original Fai of the Apostles amen but we we move amen back to the Garden of Eden where where we see how everything started where all the seeds started amen and we don't stop there also through this message of the hour amen this message did not only bring H brought did not only bring us back to the pain of the Apostles where we have the original the original Apostles Doctrine so forth and so on from baptism from the simple things amen but you know it brought us back to the Garden of Eden what what what what originally happened there and so we realize amen how important is it is when we realize what happened in the Garden of Eden then we have a better understanding of the new birth amen hallelujah and it didn't stop just right there amen we're being not just in the beginning but we're being backed further to Eternity hallelujah hallelujah so we see now and and and and and and now we're thinking not the way we we we think but we think the way God thinks Hallelujah because the prophets this our messenger of this generation prophets are seers and they See Vision not just like a movie being played in front of them and that they will see things but the prophet of God said God pick them up and place them so that they will be able to see amen they will be personal witness they will have personal account of things so God pick the prophet in this generation and place him in his mind so that he can see he can tell us what's in the mind of God what a witness we have hallelujah amen so now he said the we're placing in every in in every piece amen we we are occupying each one of us has a space in the body in the mystical Body of Christ so that's why I cannot be brother Chad brother Chad cannot be me amen both brother Chad and myself cannot be brother nessar or the rest of the ministers we are all unique in some way amen we cannot just imitate somebody because our portion in the body is dedicated only for us so you are occupy a space in the body that no one can fit except you am amen so now let's go back here in Luke chapter 15 as we go on with this Parable he said now either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece there are three steps that this woman did number one he lighted the candle and swept the house and seek diligently till she find it Hallelujah so the three steps and God is always perfect in three now he said now uh bana made mention of of uh of uh of a a brother and a sister and they went to a certain place and then they went down and then suddenly uh a person accidentally uh L's back on the light switch amen and the light went off and they could not see anything amen and so the younger sister was shouting and crying hollering and said amen because uh uh she was so afraid because she could not see anything amen but the responsible brother said don't worry amen and he said don't worry amen relax because there is a man there is a man amen that can turn on the light amen so it's the same thing today we have found we seek the man Hallelujah that can actually turn on the light and that's the very reason we see every detail that we need up in this Earthly Journey amen so he said now when we see those things see things that are out of place things that you know and brother bham said you know when you when you come to realize you're out of place and then you look at your homes you look at your uh uh uh even into the churches you know so there's there's something that will move you amen and the next thing that you do when you when you turn on the light and by said the next thing that you have to do is to do house cleaning amen hallelujah and and then when you Place everything and then you find out there's something that is out of place or something that is missing Hallelujah have you experienced going to a holiday and uh everybody's prepared the food amen everything the hotels where you're going to and then everybody is in the van amen and then suddenly when you're going to start the van you lost the key you don't have the key that's a small piece amen but you cannot you cannot leave home you can't leave the compound you're not you're not going to enjoy the holiday you have been planning for so long A Time amen because you're missing a simple piece hallelujah amen and so now everybody you know everybody will go back but you see when you when you're looking for the key and there there's only one thing sure amen you you you drove back your car that means you didn't leave the key anywhere else all right amen and brother Benham said this woman mentioned in the parable amen was not a prostitute because in during those time when when a woman you know in our days we uh H uh when there's a wedding uh there's a wedding ring right but brother bam said in the Oriental Customs amen they don't have the ring but they have tablets amen and all the these tablets represent each one represented a virtue and it shows that a woman is married amen so that shows amen and it is publicly uh uh publicly known amen but if a woman woman in the absence of her husband maybe she's a he's a soldier and and he has to fought amen uh uh in another country another place amen and and he had to go back so when he goes back and something is missing in those tablets that means uh uh she lived as Unfaithful in the absence of her husband so that was a customary during those days it was was part of their culture amen but brother mam said declared that this woman in the parable was not a prostitute she was a faithful woman amen but accidentally or something happened amen uh uh probably when when she was doing something anden she lost one of the pieces Hallelujah and then as she face the mirror she look and she notice something is missing Hallelujah and brother bham said she did not go to the neighbor she did not go wherever amen hallelujah no need to go to Walmart or or anything amen but she knew right there that it was only misplaced amen it's in there in the inner house because she's a faithful wife I believe the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is a faithful woman but just something along the way have happened something you know uh uh uh uh uh things beyond our control you know things sometimes we're being trap or we do things but that that you know but you see this woman amen this woman realize that she is missing something one among the 10 tablets or coins is missing Hallelujah so sometimes you know we're looking for something sometimes even in our household in the family sometimes we're looking for answers outside our home amen sometimes what we're looking for is just in our home Hallelujah sometimes relationship is almost going into breakdown amen we cannot we can no longer move on because of things amen and sometimes you know people you know uh uh uh a lot of people they drink wine you know not to justify not to justify and not I'm not I'm not encouraging you know that if you have problem you go to drink wine or go to some other fellowships amen but not everybody are bad people but they're just looking for some fellowship because they're looking for something they're missing something amen they're finding something that could satisfy amen what they were looking for and they cannot find it at home Hallelujah and that's why brother brandham said you know what we have to do is that we make our home nice so their family our children will always miss going back home because we have a nice that is a home that is so nice amen fulfilling amen the word of God in this this generation so just like that woman amen just you you remember that woman at the well when he met when she met the Lord she already had six men because when the Lord asked her call your husband she said I have no husband and Jesus said yes you said right because you had five and the six that you have is still not your husband amen amen but you know the B of God said you know this woman because a woman needs a head as the bride needs the headship of Christ so this woman was looking for a rightful head that will take care of her in search of something Amen in search of something that you know could protect her somebody that could answer provide for her needs amen and again not to justify amen this woman leave one man after the other because she was looking for that missing pieace of her life amen amen and she was actually looking for the most important portion of herself and that is headship amen that's the reason she had six amen but because amen but because amen the Lord Jesus Christ is the genuine head and that woman you know although the Lord was was going into another Direction but she felt a missing peace is in this direction anden he moved amen he stepped into this and went to that h h h well and he found that woman amen amen that was a missing peace of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so he was the one who look for her right no wonder you are here you know we've been out there we didn't know who he is we didn't know amen we realize amen we're missing something we're looking for our lives we're looking for our future we're looking for something that will satisfy our desires amen something that will make us happy fulfilled and everything amen but we miss the target all those years amen but somewhere along the road Hallelujah somebody's also looking for her portion for his portion somebody's looking for that missing peace and I thank God Amen the Lord has found that missing peace and that's the reason you are here hallelujah because he found us amen amen amen he came down amen he became a servant he occupied Hallelujah the lowest the lowest portion just to find us amen and now we're occupying a portion Hallelujah so that's why you're here and he said now amen he said that's why amen he said it's later than we think we don't come to church just to occupy a few amen otherwise we're just members of a certain organization but we don't come to church to occupy a few we do not come to church to hear a good sermon amen hallelujah that satisfies me somehow amen you don't come to CH to occupy a Pew we do not come to CH to hear a good ser sermon or come to church to hear good music they all got their place but what we better come to church to do is check up with God and our soul salvation for the day of redemption is near every time we come to church amen we're we're in Search Lord what do you want me to do Lord what do you do you want me to fulfill Lord I want to hear something that will not just satisfy my emotion my want my desire amen but let me hear something that will help me to come closer to you and fulfill your perfect will hallelujah amen not just my will but your will be done Lord no matter how it hurts Hallelujah no matter you know if if if if it comes to some kind of a rebuke a reminder of something of some sort Lord hallelujah let your will be done be it unto me Lord according to your word hallelujah we come here with open heart amen so that God can check our hearts because we are we're doing this we're in the last part of our journey amen and we do not want to commit mistake just because we have our own choosing that's amen hallelujah and so Jesus Christ God's son like like in this he said to a woman in her subject tonight we find this woman her husband had gone and she had lost one of the coins out of her tablet now in his said he he will try to explain that amen and he said so we see in the first verse in the next verse he said in Luke 15:9 and when she had found it when we found something you know when she had found it she call it her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost Hallelujah all these years I'm looking for something so that's why we we we go out there we witness we evangelize not because an organization send us but it's because there is a joy Hallelujah immeasurable Joy we're just testifying that I have found something that all these years I'm looking Hallelujah the thing that I have been missing something that have you know I look for all these things I mean I look in in in the word looking for some friends looking for some uh H organization religious group whatsoever it is I'm looking for personalities Sports everything Hallelujah but none of those things satisfied me and completed my search amen Hallelujah until I found him thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah and he said for I have found the peace which I had lost amen and what this did this woman lost he said now he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church now we're giving the the the message is giving us a clue yes why there's only nine and there's a missing peace amise God because you can have all this gifts but in the absence of Revelation amen that's it right amen right that's why Satan hates revelation amen he can he can manifest he can show all these gifts might be you know uh uh might be literally being witnessed before us but in the absence of Revelation and what keeps us going what keeps us happy Amen to keep serving the lord of all these trials of all these struggles amen but because we have a revelation that all things work together for good thank God for that Revelation Hallelujah so we're not just aiming asking for all these gifts to be made manifest but we're asking Revelation from the Lord because that is what stimulates our faith that is what stimulates the word that we are hearing you might be hearing the same word you might be hearing the same sermon but but in the absence of Revelation that comes from the Lord we will miss the target glory to God Amen so he said now he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army so if they the bride get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely tarted today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it Hallelujah that completes the pieces amen he said Satan hates Revelation but we love it with through Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them so what import it is so important that's why when we get the Revelation we're not confused amen you know why other religious organization can can manifest all the similar things amen now when we get the revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church then we are not confused because we have the great re the true Revelation and he said the Bible said now if the true church get the true Revelation and what she is and what she stands for she can do Greater Works amen hallelujah so that's why you remember that that uh illustration that brother brandham said uh he said there was there was a young boy who lived in the countryside and never seen a mirror all his life amen but suddenly amen one of the relatives invited them and and and and then he was walking in in the home and then he passed by a mirror amen and as he passed by that mirror he saw somebody and he was scared initially amen so he thought he was alone but suddenly he saw somebody amen and then when he when he got all his you know he put all his emotion and become bre a little bit amen and he just stop and look at the mirror amen and as he look at the mirror he moved one of his hands and that guy is imitating him and move another hand he's really doing what I do amen and then suddenly he realized amen then then he R to his mother and he said said Mama I saw myself that's me in the mirror it's the same thing when we are reading the scripture this is our mirror amen when we look at the stature of a perfect man amen we see and we see all these steps Hallelujah we see amen little by little amen it's not just something amen uh it's not just a program it's not a Creed it's not uh a method of good living Hallelujah but the word tells us there is a bride that is pure that is perfect Hallelujah that uh he will present to himself without wrinkles amen and suddenly we said that's me that's why God separated us hallelujah from the rest of the Christian world you realize you become an ODB to this world Hallelujah because God just made us so different glory to God Amen Hallelujah so now he said uh uh when we that that's why when we see uh uh when we testify he said and when she had found it she called it her friends and her neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost then we come to go out as a witness and we are given a certain responsibility that this truth will not stop only with us but when we realize there's still something out there Amen brother bham once said amen it's not fair that we are hearing this message time and time again we hear we hear this message many times but there's still people out there that have not heard the message not even a single time Hallelujah then we realize and then we we we place then the holy spirit that called us amen has led us into a certain position and then we speak as the Holy Spirit say come Hallelujah we just testified and he said so we realize what he said that's the reason Christ has to say in his mediatorial seat back there as an intercessor until that last one comes in at the last age and this Revelation then of what he has been breaks forth upon the people and they see what's happened amen so he said now amen he has moved amen from his throne into the Throne of our hearts and that's why we go out there hallelujah amen because we peel the burden the mercy is being placed upon us amen then when you realize amen that greatest atonement is in your heart Hallelujah you realize now amen there's always you know there's always the World War I all these wars and rumors of War amen is always almost going to happen but it's not happening yet because we still have one out there amen amen and their only hope is you amen because you hold in your hand you have in your heart am the grace of the Lord amen amen and because of us people will realize they need salvation amen the world will realize Hallelujah there is redemption and there is room at the cross all the time amen amen hallelujah and so now uh in in in in in the prophet's illustration you know uh he used all these terms Capstone headstone cheap Cornerstone the KE the Keystone amen but I believe they speak the same thing amen because the cheap Cornerstone that was rejected that's Christ amen the head of the Bride The Headstone is Christ amen uh uh the pyramid amen the pyramid brother bham said there is no cstone being put on it so even in the natural pyramid they miss a missing piece but we know that in this generation the last piece of the puzzle must be laid on Amen Hallelujah so the cup is Christ the head is Christ the chief Corner amen and the stone amen when he when he spoke to Peter he said amen Peter what do people say I the son of man am he said oh you're you're they say you are among the prophets you're Elijah Jeremiah amen and or one of the prophets but how about you Peter what is your personal Revelation because this is the peace that they miss what is your personal revelation of who the son of man am and Peter said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah Peter you have not learned it you have not heard it from anyone but my father is in heaven rebuild it unto you and Upon This Rock upon this great Stone upon this revelation of who I am upon this revelation of what the real cup is and who is your head is and who is your key is amen it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's the revelation of the word hallelujah amen thank you Lord so it's exactly placing us amen and when we realize when we get the true revelation of who we are and what you are and what you stand for then you know how to conduct yourself Hallelujah and we can lay the last missing pieace and because of that Hallelujah sometimes you know uh uh people don't realize that when they hear the word of God you know all of us are fulfilling something as we have said you're not just sitting there to occupy of you you're not just a visitor here you are not an accident to come by here God place you here for a certain purpose amen and no matter how little our participation is in the body it is important you are important I am important as you are Hallelujah so I so so I believe Hallelujah that you will not be complete without brother Dany I'm not complete without you amen because we occupy a portion in the body amen hallelujah until we fully complete God's purpose in our lives amen uh just like in uh you know in in a certain Orchestra where you know there are hundreds of uh uh you know musician playing the violin and then there other instruments you know you have the piano you have the keyboard and all this and all these instruments and as you watch the or sometimes I I watch a certain Orchestra and you know it there's really something in it and as the uh uh uh uh the director you know he he he he put the you know he he make all this compass and everything but one day I noticed something you know this one who holds a little triangle that piece I don't know how it is called how it is called but it's just a simple triangle amen and you know he just T it sometimes once and there are hundreds of violin players great musicians great director amen and you know this one holding this little piece a triangle Hallelujah and all everybody and then suddenly amen he's waiting for your time amen it's coming it's coming to a certain Climax and and and you know uh the director is giving all he got and all the instruments all the violin you know putting all their hearts together amen and suddenly amen that portion he just said that's all she has to do right but without it the music is not complete amen it is one of the details of that musical piece Hallelujah you might be sitting there and you don't know what to do you might be sitting there and Lord what what should I do I want to be a a a a you know I want to be an active member of the body God is the holy spirit that's place in you there and you're just like that somebody who's holding that piece of triangle and and when you do your portion you complete the musical piece amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord you love him this morning amen and so now all these things God makes us and so it's it's it's the revelation of who we are is the revelation of what we have to do and and and because of that by knowing it we will be an effective member of the body amen one time brother Benham was answered was questioned he said h h h the question was he said brother benam would the bride of Christ have would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture yes and brother man said sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ sure she consist of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ that she's got a Ministry a great ministry and I like how the prophet closed this paragraph he said he's got a Ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it will be so humble amen hallelujah remember the Rapture is a secret catching away yeah right it's not even making noise for the whole world to see what's going on Amen it's a secret catching away amen there is silence somewhere because there is an invisible Union taking place but in this world you know we live in the world you know we're social media and everything that everybody wants to be on top everyone everybody wants to be noticed but the Propet of God said the ministry the last piece of God's Ministry of the Bride it will be so humble I'm not saying we have to be silent and we don't have to say Amen you know I jump when I F the Holy Spirit you know uh although H uh I understand you know that all these expression these are just expression but it's the holy spirit amen placing us into the body of Jesus Christ amen and that is what we really uh uh uh uh need to know amen and so uhh even the prophet of God Amen even the prophet of God one time you know he's the prophet of this generation but did you remember one time he was standing right at that huge building and he said Lord you know reminding about Orel Roberts and THL osbor look what they've got amen I done hope all these things amen probably you know he said he said when I stood outside there we just couldn't hardly get my breath from such Majesty that a poor boy born in a Dugout a Pentecost costal could do and bring that into that great Mammoth building and I thought oh God maybe I am not worthy just then a little voice came down through those corridors and said but I am your portion Hallelujah when I read this I come to realize amen God has se truly separated us amen you know that our faith blessing is not just the things that we see outside amen because he said this physical expression though God is able to do that amen this is not the basis but this basis is election amen that we are part of being the Beloved but look the prophet of this gener ation was not excused when he saw all these things that these two ministers you know have you know have gotten that kind of inspiration from his ministry till Osborne until now he is testifying about the ministry that he witnessed upon brother Brenham Hallelujah and so now he said but you see but Lord maybe I I I'm not able to handle all these things I don't have the capacity amen but we we could feel what's behind amen what's behind those statements Hallelujah but brothers and sisters when we come to realize that when we open our hearts and we have we we give a portion a space there that God will occupy amen and then we realize that he is our portion and when he becomes our portion there's nothing we can ask for am am that completes amen that F all the cracks in our lives because he is our portion Hallelujah so now everything that we that we have need of you know even even even Paul amen when when when he come to the point at the end of his journey of life amen he was going you know to to the place where he will be offered he said I did my time has come this my time to be offered but brother brandham said am mean that was the ceiling of Paul's Ministry and what was the ceiling of his ministry when he was just right there and he is going to be martyred Hallelujah he was being and and and and brother brenon made mention about you know uh uh even his own life even his ministry he mentioned Demas he mentioned all you know any experience but all these things e even the life you know even the life of Spurgeon I read a portion of Spurgeon and he and he said in his life he had he had two years he said I had two years of the most bitterest experience to be [Laughter] betrayed but at the end Spurgeon said Lord all these years all my life I tried my best to build my reputation but at one time in the moment of my life somebody has to destroy it and it looks like I'm going to lose my reputation but Spurgeon said I'm repacing it you can search it if you want Spurgeon said but Lord amen now I realize I built all this reputation on myself I tried to be good I tried to be the best amen because I want to face you amen according to your perpose but now it seems like I'm losing my reputation but now I realize I'm losing my reputation not somebody has taken it but in that way I will be nothing so that only your reputation will come up Allelujah thank you Lord Jesus so sometimes and in the closing of this little sermon I would like to uh uh to close with the illustration that brother bham made mention when uh when he mentioned in one of his meetings uh and he mentioned about brother Edie Bisal you know about this in his illustration there is this uh grizzly bear and that Mammoth uh uh Beast with 42 in Horn amen and then there is one guy who's wearing a green checkered shirt you fully know the story but there's one point that I just want to leave with you this morning amen so in that in said said I have not been disobedient just like Paul to the Heavenly Bishop so in that illustration even his BR even uh uh the brother who's guiding him were even expressing some kind of a uh attitude that seemed to be doubting what was the what brother Bram was telling you know brother Bram I've been looking around you know and I could look so far and I cannot see any huge Beast down here amen but you see all these things you know all this H H uh what do you call this all this characters all these items all these pieces in the vision brother brandham said must come to pass he said everything that God have shown me in the entire Ministry of mine not a single time God failed and I saw that will happen and he was telling that story amen if you're going to uh uh to read the the the the the message or hear the message in the entitled proving his word I mean he said brother brother Eddie was Al when the lord gave me the vision about the bear and the Caribou amen so when when brother bham was relating this brother adisc and wife were in the audience amen and so now when he was telling this story amen so uh uh all the pieces amen were there now he said I saw now I saw the grizzly bear and the g the grizly bear amen uh when it stood before them it was so huge it's so monstrous and and and and the brother said butam amen in Your Vision you said that you shoot the Beast you shoot that bear why don't you why don't you shoot him right now and brother bam said no because in the vision I shoot him in the heart that means he was facing but brother brandham in no time when he faced Us in no time he can jump on us and just tore us to Pieces break us into pieces amen but I have to be obedient to the Henly Vision I shoot him in the heart and this rifle with that distance will not even touch him amen so he must be as at a certain distance amen and so when when when the grizzly bear Pace on them and and it and and and it s him and it s them amen he was ready to attack and brother Bram amen aimed the rifle and at a certain distance amen he shoot it and he and he said it looks like it didn't hurt him but suddenly amen it fell just few yards and it was so huge and then what about the caribou and what about the hand that reaches out amen so all these things must come to pass because it is thus sayth the Lord It's the pieces all the pieces must be there amen hallelujah so you know the story most of you know the story very well and so later on then the kibu came amen and when they were down there and they have to you know they have to to measure amen uh as as as the edge of the uh measuring tool is you know repeatedly it's falling and another hand must pick it up amen another must pick it up and so the vision that is show there is a hand that that reachs and and they they measure it from tip to tip and the brother said brother Brandon it's 42 in perfect but what about the green checkered shirt amen and I heard the story that brother Ed Bisal was even asking sister Ruth to throw it maybe it's too old maybe it's not you know but uh from from Brother Ed's point of view it's better you you throw it amen and so when when when he left you know it was not by the Ed the beast that's why when brother bam asked is there anyone who's in green checkered shirt and brother Ed did not answer because he never knew that that green Checker chirt was there all right so now something has to happen that along the way brother Eddie Bisal stumbled or he sleep and he got dirty and wet and now now he has to change and he has to go back to his double bag and as he open it on top of that that's the last piece to make the vision complete and what will brother Ed do he picked that green checkered shirt and he wor it and when the prophet look here it is the last piece of the vision was being placed now let me leave this thought in your mind brothers and sisters the one who placed that green checkered shirt the last piece of that prophecy sister Ruth pisca was not there he was out of the picture he was behind the scene but the last piece that she laid there completed the vision in this day and age it's the bride on the sin but it's not something just like the third pool it's not a public show am the bride is behind the scene on the other side there might be people that will be shaking hands with you you don't know you don't realize what you're doing in the mission fieldj you don't realize what you're putting on into something but there are people out there who's hearing the gospel yes you're laying the last piece of the prophecy see to complete the vision in this last generation you're doing something that other people may not realize amen you're you're doing accomplishing something in the church maybe just praying in one corner praying for your pastor praying for the brother that is sick praying for somebody that you know amen is struggling and brother bam said when we pray for somebody we need to enter into their condition Hallelujah no one notice it but we place the last piece of the APLE Hallelujah we may be the last piece of the APLE it may be the last predestinated seed that will hear the message because they hear it through somebody that you sent out there amen they can go to the parang areas where we cannot go amen but there are missionaries that going to the parang areas crossing the sea amen climbing these mountains amen and everything and then on the other side he said I want to see amen that that that when I see that light that hovering covering circling that men on the other side and then at that point I will realize I have a portion in that you place the last piece you complete the last piece of the prophecy Hallelujah as we call on our musician this morning Hallelujah let's prepare ourselves to pray and may we realize number one you are so important you're among the pieces that completes this local Body of Christ here in Lima amen and whatever you do is as important no matter how little it is it is as important as the great things that are being accomplished for God's glory in this generation as I call on brother Chad amen may we uh stand up amen and I just want to leave a short prayer for you and I request also prayer amen prayer for me for my family for my little congregation prayer for the things that we are doing realizing that we are at the last portion of this age and we just want to do whatever we can in search of that last predestinated seat we appreciate your prayers we appreciate all your support amen your trust and confidence amen are the pieces that completes the prophecy let's bow our heads in prayer dear heavenly father Lord I commit this congregation into your Mighty hand from the pastor Lord brother Chad this family and these faithful Believers Lord Jesus Lord may we realize this morning that whatever we occupy whatever we do that out of our faithfulness out of our sincerity everything Lord no matter how little it is no matter how great it is we want to be led by your Holy Spirit that whatever we do whatever we contribute will add detail to the greatest picture you want to show in this generation that we belong Lord you have sons and daughters out there they're silently doing things others may not realize but Lord we have there's seven spirits there's seven eyes watching over over us nothing is hidden Lord into your sight everything Lord not even the things that we do without aiming for any credits Lord you see all these things father God I just pray that any little thing that we can take part on will glorify your name and something that will accomplish what you have ordained for us to do this is my prayer as I commit this family into your Mighty hands in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah God bless you and thank you God bless you brother thank you brother thank you brother give me more [Music] reel let my flesh be all forsen let the word of God guide me on on my way so he can have preeminence each day give me more [Music] reation that my life be your [Applause] reflection for I know this word is my Redemption give me more ration give me more ration let my flesh be all forsaken that the word word of God guide me on my way so he can have preeminence each day give me more reation let my life be your reflection for I know this word is my Redemption give me more reel amen oh that's the greatest thing the greatest peace is revelation I was so encouraged by the word today and you realize that uh when he went to the story of brother brandham started talking about brother brandham reflecting on his life in comparison to the great buildings and the great works of these men and you could see the humanity and brother Brenham the the the disappointment maybe feeling like he didn't measure up in some way but in his disappointment and maybe his confusion God gave him the greatest Revelation I am your portion amen oh may God make that a revelation for us today that he is our portion and if he's my portion what else do I need he's the greatest thing there is oh I'm so thankful to God and I pray that God would give that Revelation to each one of us that he is our portion that he's our head that he is the he is the missing piece in all of our Lives amen he's the great peace and may his love come down and cap Our Lives May the head ship Unite with us and may we find that missing portion that completes each one of us and if that be so then we will become the missing pieace the detail that this world needs to complete the picture of Christ because the picture of Christ is Christ United with his bride a many membered bride and what a reminder to not look to the great big things cuz if we're only looking to the big things we might be missing the key thing that God wants us to do just to live our portion I love the story he told of brother bisco and sister bisco how brother bisco had told her to throw away the shirt he didn't even want it anymore but it had a tear or something in it but she mended it and put it back in his bag you know she may have never known how important that was or what inspired her to fix it and put it back in you know there's some things that we don't even know that we're doing doing but we just have to trust that God's called us to fulfill a role and God has a purpose in our lives and just move forward as God leaves and live for him and let him sort it all out amen she put that in there and and all of the things transpired and and like the brother was saying it fulfilled the vision and she didn't even know that she was instrumental in the missing piece we may not know we may not even know what we're doing but we have to believe that he's my portion and he'll lead and guide me in every way that he wants me to live and God will get Glory out of my life and there come a day that she was sitting in a service and brother Brenham started telling that Serv story and maybe it was then that she realized how instrumental her part was that without her it would have never been fulfilled and I wonder if maybe just maybe at the wedding supper maybe as the as the bridegroom gets up and starts telling stories maybe it's then we real real ize the part that we play but I want to be faithful even if I don't know today even if I can't see it even if I can't measure it even if I can't measure it up to somebody else's great buildings I I help me God not to care that's The Human Side we all care about those things we all want to do our part but help me God to look beyond that and see my reward is you you're my portion you're my reward and maybe if we can be faithful to him in all things at the marriage supper he might might unfold the rest of the story we realize what our prayer our attendance our kindness our thoughtfulness our our word how instrumental it was to fulfill the vision along the way amen help me God I needed to hear this help me to quit looking for big things and help me to embrace my portion which is him help me to trust him to leave and guide me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake and whatever he wants out of my life that's what I want him to get whatever part he wants me to play I already have my portion I don't need a building don't need a monument don't need recognition I already have my portion now I want him to get out of my life what he desires oh how good the word is to encourage us to keep aligning our Focus to the right things to move us away from the Earthly into the heavenly vision like God did for brother brandham may he do the same for us today forget these things just look to him he's our portion man how many will pray for our brother Danny dunda I know he's testified to me that God has opened a new door for him in South Korea he set a burden on his heart for South career for years and God has supernaturally opened the door and giv him a contact and he's hoping to go yet this year here amen will you commit to pray for him that God will use him to go bring the light of the Gospel the revelation of the headship to somebody else who's waiting to hear maybe there's somebody in South Korea who's had six husbands but they're looking for the one that will complete it the seventh Christ himself to be their portion amen let's just remember our brother pray for him and his family his home church and all those that assist him what he's doing let's pray for them also want to mention to you that we had a wonderful time this past Friday as we went to holes County and participated in the wedding of sister Annie we appreciate all your prayers I know several of you were able to make it there and help them celebrate and I'm so happy for her amen may God bless them and we thank you for your prayers and your support man how many of you have been encouraged Lord if it's just a triangle
