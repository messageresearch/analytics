[0:00] Sarah was turned back Young
[0:03] but remember said she woke up in the
[0:05] morning and they were shocked looked in
[0:06] the mirror she screamed he dramatizes
[0:09] they returned back young amen then
[0:11] there's a little trouble in the land
[0:12] they go down to Gerard and I beat him
[0:14] like the king of garage he wants to take
[0:15] her
[0:17] at 80 years old and make her his his
[0:20] wife because she's a beautiful virgin
[0:23] the scripture is giving us an indication
[0:25] Something's Happened to this woman why
[0:28] does the king of garage who could have
[0:29] any virgin he wants one an 80 year old
[0:31] woman
[0:34] because she had been turned back Young
[0:36] but just because she was brought back to
[0:38] Virgin condition
[0:40] did not mean she would conceive seed
[0:43] because in her original virgin condition
[0:45] she could not conceive seed
[0:48] she had been married for Years brother I
[0:50] said possibly since she was 16 years of
[0:52] age amen and she never conceived she
[0:54] needed something more than just be
[0:56] brought back to Virgin condition
[0:59] she needed to conceive seed
[1:02] and all the time through Genesis Genesis
[1:06] we have God coming to Abraham God
[1:08] speaking Abraham God coming to Abram God
[1:10] coming to Abraham God coming to Abraham
[1:12] but then God says I will visit you
[1:13] according to the time of life I will
[1:15] visit you he says I will visit you
[1:17] according to the time of life and that
[1:19] visitation shows up later in Genesis and
[1:22] in Genesis he says and the Lord visited
[1:26] Sarah
[1:29] this time it wasn't Abraham it was it
[1:32] was Abe it was Mrs Abraham because
[1:34] that's who needed the visitation for
[1:36] this manifestation
[1:38] but he told Abraham I'll visit you
[1:40] because she was part of Abraham she was
[1:42] Abraham she was the part that was going
[1:45] to bring forth the promised son that
[1:47] came out of Abraham so he says I will
[1:49] visit you and that visitation is the
[1:52] seventh seal it's the secret because we
[1:54] don't know the conversation we don't
[1:56] know what the Lord said we don't know
[1:57] anything it just says he visited Sarah
[1:59] and Sarah conceived
[2:05] that's the hour we're living in that's
[2:07] what's happening to you and I
[2:10] in the mystery of the seventh seal in
[2:12] the silence in the little room in the
[2:14] place where nobody can explain what's
[2:15] going on Amen he's visiting you who are
[2:18] you part of Christ part of the word he's
[2:21] visiting the part of the word that now
[2:23] has to manifest the word in this
[2:24] generation
[2:27] and he's visiting you in the privacy of
[2:30] your heart
[2:35] where you can't even copy
[2:38] you can't even copy somebody else's
[2:40] visitation because there's no example
[2:42] given
[2:44] the Bible doesn't say what happened to
[2:46] Sarah just said the Lord visited her and
[2:49] we see the results she conceives and
[2:51] brings forth to child
[2:53] and the 10th Vision when they went into
[2:55] the little room they came out the other
[2:57] end changed still restored whole but
[2:59] they couldn't explain what happened
[3:01] you could just see the results of what
[3:03] happened and so now God he said the
[3:05] third pull it'll be a secret because
[3:08] there's not going to be any imitation of
[3:10] this there won't be an imitation all
[3:13] there will be as a result a
[3:14] manifestation but not an imitation
[3:19] God will visit you in the privacy of
[3:21] your heart where under the seven still
[3:23] under the end time under the Fulfillment
[3:25] of the promise under the completion
[3:27] of the Gentile dispensation
