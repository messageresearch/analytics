========================================

we had no desire to sin but but we trapped into sin we caught up but that seed Soul attributes Gene always longing for something eternal that's why he sent the Holy Ghost and quickened that seed and when that seed is quickened we recognize the part of the scripture for this day because we are the part of that scripture deep was calling to the Deep and when deep cold there was something deep in us to respond that call amen because the same part was here we are that's all is a part of the world amen so when Jesus came he said I will build my church no man I will build so that church is not something who comes accidentally amen church is was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and but Branham said that is his great secret the mystery threefold what God was he poured himself into Christ and what Christ was he poured himself into the church and no both together amen God had preeminists in the Sun the same preeminist son has in the church in the pride no both together restored going back in the Garden of Eden
