[0:00] what was the whole purpose of of
[0:02] chastisement in a church setting and
[0:04] church discipline was for the saving of
[0:06] the Soul
[0:07] the whole purpose is for a real genuine
[0:10] love it's not love to let the sin remain
[0:13] amen and think somebody think that
[0:15] they're okay they're destroying
[0:16] themselves and destroying the people
[0:18] around them
[0:19] but true love says no we can't do this
[0:22] we must deliver you if you won't repent
[0:24] we must deliver you unto Satan amen for
[0:27] the destruction of your flesh that's all
[0:30] harsh amen but that's what God did to
[0:32] his children in order to save them
[0:36] and so sometimes chastisement seems so
[0:39] harsh and so hard amen but true
[0:41] chastisement is an act of true love
[0:46] amen churches today won't call out any
[0:49] sin
[0:50] not just Grievous and no sin no allow
[0:54] adultery and fornication and and and and
[0:57] and multiple marriages and all of these
[0:59] things just continue on and on and on
[1:01] and on and on and then and then
[1:03] constantly amen they're told God loves
[1:05] you God who blesses you God is your
[1:07] servant he he he wants to take care of
[1:10] you and do everything for you and make
[1:12] your life easy and make your life good
[1:14] and no correction no correction no
[1:16] correction and the people are being
[1:18] destroyed from within
[1:22] all kinds of devils are permitted to
[1:25] operate in their lives and take over
[1:26] them and bring destruction and keep the
[1:29] promises of God everything that's
[1:30] promised from the pulpit is not coming
[1:32] to pass because because there's no sin
[1:34] being purged out of the camp and the
[1:36] devil is allowed to sit right there and
[1:38] take advantage of the open door
[1:45] that's not love
[1:47] but it's called love
[1:50] they'll call themselves a Grace Church
[1:51] we're a Grace Church not a law Church
[1:55] Well a true Grace Church will have Grace
[1:57] enough to tell the truth
[2:00] because that's love
[2:02] love is not going to let you sit there
[2:05] in your sin and be destroyed but tell
[2:08] you this is not the word of God and if
[2:10] you can't line up to the word of God you
[2:12] can't stay here because you have to go
[2:14] amen and get your chastisement so that
[2:17] your soul can be saved because we're not
[2:18] going to let your soul die in a pew
[2:22] [Applause]
[2:24] what's called love is promoting death in
[2:27] pews you die in the church because they
[2:31] love you too much to correct you
[2:34] that's not love
[2:36] that's promoting death spiritual death
[2:39] going on in churches while praises and
[2:43] blessings are being showered upon the
[2:44] congregation
[2:46] so God help us never to get down to this
[2:49] path to where we just want membership
[2:51] and we just want people and we don't
[2:52] want hard things we don't want to deal
[2:53] with hard things and we don't want to
[2:55] say hard things amen because that's not
[2:57] love that's only a selfish love that
[2:59] doesn't want to go through the
[3:01] difficulty of tackling a difficult
[3:03] situation
[3:04] but love will sacrifice self for the
[3:07] benefit of its recipient
[3:09] and sometimes it doesn't look like love
[3:11] but it's love
[3:13] because that's how God loves and if I
[3:16] want to be like God I'm going to have to
[3:18] act like God
[3:20] many times we have to do things we don't
[3:22] want to do
