[0:00] I do a little exercise sometimes when I
[0:02] have a a young couple ready to get
[0:04] married and they're sitting in my office
[0:06] we're talking and I say listen and I I
[0:10] start to I start to uh make some phrases
[0:12] I say okay let's say this young man
[0:14] looks at you and he says you know what
[0:17] you are so precious and dear to me I
[0:20] love you I love everything about you
[0:21] when you walk by my heart skips a beat I
[0:24] can't stop thinking about you and you're
[0:26] the sweetest thing God ever made and I
[0:27] asked a sister I said does that kind of
[0:29] talk feel good she said oh yeah
[0:31] that feels good
[0:33] then I say I go to the young man I say
[0:35] okay now the sister looks at you and
[0:36] says you are such a sweetie you're a
[0:39] sweetie pie
[0:40] you're so gentle and sweet and tender
[0:42] and everything about you
[0:45] I told the brother I said it I mean it's
[0:47] not bad
[0:49] I mean it's not bad it's okay
[0:52] but what if she looks at you and says
[0:53] you know what I really respect you for
[0:55] the kind of man you are
[0:57] I look up to you and admire you for the
[0:59] standard taking the life that you live
[1:02] and and I could place myself under your
[1:04] headship because I respect and honor you
[1:06] now you guys tell me which one do you
[1:08] want to hear on a regular basis
[1:11] do you want to be the sweetest guy at
[1:13] work
[1:14] you're in the weld shop
[1:17] and all the other welders look at you
[1:18] and says he is the sweetest guy in this
[1:22] show
[1:24] it doesn't move the men it doesn't
[1:27] because that's not the way they're made
[1:29] that's not their position there's
[1:31] nothing wrong with being sweet and if
[1:32] your wife looks at you and say you're
[1:33] being so sweet that feels good too but
[1:35] that I mean that can't be all there is
[1:37] to it amen there's got to be some more
[1:39] but when your wife looks at you and says
[1:41] you know I really respect you for what
[1:42] you just did
[1:44] I'm telling you you're going to make a
[1:46] man out of that man by the way you speak
[1:48] to him
[1:49] and if you want a man to be your
[1:50] Defender and your protector and stand on
[1:52] the front line and shield you from Darth
[1:54] you keep talking to that man that way
[1:56] and that man will go slay a dragon for
[1:58] you
[1:59] is that right
[2:00] he'll give his whole life to you why
[2:02] because that's what God called him for
[2:05] and if you love him that way you Empower
[2:07] him to be what God called him to be but
[2:10] if you look at your wife and say you
[2:11] know I really respect the way you work
[2:13] around here
[2:17] you put in a good day's work like a man
[2:20] you're not lounging around you
[2:25] something about is not working
[2:28] and if you're just now realizing today
[2:30] that that's not good
[2:33] Take Your Wife by the hand and come see
[2:35] me
[2:36] we'll make an appointment
[2:40] because we have to respect the nature
[2:42] that God made in each one
[2:44] and we have to know what God's wanting
[2:46] to do through the man and what God's
[2:47] doing to the woman and when we
[2:48] understand that and Empower that and
[2:50] respect that
[2:52] then all of a sudden you have a marriage
[2:54] that moves into harmony into unity and
[2:56] everything's operating the way God wants
[2:57] it to operate and we begin to move
[2:59] forward that way
[3:01] and so if we can get this verse right in
[3:05] our homes then a man love his wife even
[3:08] as himself and see that the wife
[3:09] reverends her husband you're going to
[3:10] have success after success in every
[3:12] trouble do this in every difficulty do
[3:15] this every day do this and you're going
[3:17] to have a successful marriage
[3:19] it will work because that's the way God
[3:21] intended for it to work
