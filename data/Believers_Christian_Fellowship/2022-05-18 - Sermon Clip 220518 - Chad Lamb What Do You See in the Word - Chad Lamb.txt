TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this little boy all he had was a piece of broken mirror you know how broken mirror is you know it's not steady on the edges and so it's a little distorting the edges maybe a crack running through it if you want to comb your hair you kind of have to move your head you can't even see you can only see so much of yourself you probably can't even see your whole hairline amen until you move your head a little bit and make sure that the left and the right side is okay all right we're okay and we move on if a little boy wanted to see anything he had to get a box and climb up and just peek up into it and he might see a little bit of his face or all of his face who knows how much amen but but this little boy who can only see so much of himself listen that little broken mirror is denominational traditional ideas it's only a little view of the word amen luther had a little view of the word wesley had a little view of the word pentecost had a little view of the word why because the nomination that came and broke up the word and they each grabbed a piece of broken mirror and they could only see a little bit in this mirror but this little boy when he went on a journey amen he come to a place that had a complete mirror and i want to tell you that there's a complete mirror that's been restored at the end of the ages this message has brought a complete full length perfect mirror no cracks no missing pieces amen it's all been put back together and made perfect and i'll tell you what else this mirror is not distorted it's not bent on the edges it's not twisted it's not flex amen it doesn't give you back a funny view of yourself you know if somebody takes the word and they bend it and they take this mirror and they bend it amen you'll get an odd reflection of yourself and you'll walk away horrified because you're three foot tall and 500 pounds that's what man does to the word and when you look into man's broken piece of the word in man's distorted word amen it always gives you the wrong picture of yourself you either can't see all of yourself or what you see is twisted up and distorted until you walk away with the wrong view of who you are but in this day we've got a complete mirror a perfect mirror a perfect word by god's grace we have a perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication the word has been restored and now you can stand in front of that mirror and know what god's idea was of you before the foundation of the world how he wants you to live how he wants you to dress how he wants you to speak how he wants you to talk what the reflection of jesus christ in a female form should look like because the word has been restored and when you look in that you see yourself the way god wants you to look the way god sees you and when you see that you can be changed into that image from glory and to glory by the spirit of the lord not by might not by power but by my spirit but you'll never be changed into that image until you get in front of the mirror the full mirror
