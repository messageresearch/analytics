[5:19] one
[5:21] i want to continue looking in the book
[5:23] of genesis for a little bit i've really
[5:24] been enjoying
[5:26] genesis just going back and looking at
[5:28] some of these things again
[5:29] and none of the things we talk about or
[5:31] look at are
[5:33] are i guess brand new or something that
[5:37] would be shocking but it's just so good
[5:38] to look at them again
[5:40] and see what comes to light when we look
[5:42] at it again and
[5:45] before we turn there i just want to say
[5:47] i got good reports from the youth camp
[5:49] out over the weekend this past weekend
[5:51] they enjoyed that
[5:52] and brother joseph scott gave us
[5:53] testimony to the youth and they really
[5:55] enjoyed that
[5:56] so thank you brother joe and amen thank
[5:58] you brother kyle and sister kerry for
[6:00] putting that on it was a good time
[6:02] amen it makes me wish i was youth again
[6:06] but my youth days are coming back soon
[6:11] with a new body amen second peter
[6:14] chapter one verse two
[6:17] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[6:20] through the knowledge of god
[6:21] and of jesus our lord according as his
[6:24] divine power hath given unto us
[6:26] all things that pertain into life and
[6:28] godliness
[6:30] through the knowledge of him that hath
[6:31] called us to glory
[6:33] and virtue whereby are given unto us
[6:36] exceeding great and precious promises
[6:38] that by these we might be partakers of
[6:40] the divine nature
[6:42] having escaped the corruption that is in
[6:44] the world
[6:45] through lust it's the last part of that
[6:48] verse that we talked about before but i
[6:50] can't get away from
[6:52] we've been made partakers of his divine
[6:54] nature having escaped the corruption
[6:56] that is in the world through lust
[6:57] because all the corruption that has come
[6:59] into the world has come through lust
[7:02] and by his divine nature we have escaped
[7:04] them amen let's bow our heads and pray
[7:07] lord jesus we thank you we thank you
[7:10] father that we can come here
[7:12] and we can put all of our little licks
[7:14] of fire together lord
[7:15] we can warm one another in this
[7:17] atmosphere in this blaze lord
[7:19] we can enjoy your presence and enjoy
[7:21] worshiping you together
[7:23] nor may you be pleased with our worship
[7:25] lord as we turn to the word now lord as
[7:28] we read these scriptures and
[7:29] we look at what your prophet has taught
[7:31] us lord i pray that you would just
[7:32] open it to us give us eyes to see in
[7:35] ears to hear lord
[7:37] may we grow today lord may you feed us
[7:39] from your own hand and
[7:40] may we grow spiritually lord to become
[7:42] what you want us to be in this
[7:44] hour may we overcome by the word lord
[7:47] i pray to feed your sheep and have
[7:49] preeminence among us
[7:50] and take your liberty amongst us this
[7:52] evening in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:55] amen you can all have your seats
[7:59] uh we'll
[8:02] turn to genesis chapter five
[8:06] and go back here and look in genesis
[8:09] chapter five
[8:10] i want to read a quote quickly here
[8:13] in the message faith from 1956
[8:17] the prophet of god says and everything
[8:20] that we've got here today began in
[8:21] genesis
[8:22] that's why i've enjoyed this study of
[8:25] genesis so much and taking our time and
[8:27] just going through and looking at it
[8:29] because i i feel like personally like
[8:31] brother branham said this is the seed
[8:32] chapter
[8:33] of the whole bible and everything that
[8:35] begins in genesis
[8:37] amen works its way all the way through
[8:39] the bible where there's two
[8:40] there's two vines that begin to move
[8:42] down through here
[8:43] and i feel like if if you can begin to
[8:46] see it
[8:46] and comprehend it and understand it see
[8:49] the beginning and see how it acts and
[8:51] see the nature of it
[8:52] you can spot it everywhere amen so we
[8:55] see how it begins we see the nature of
[8:57] it in the beginning
[8:58] we see how the vine began to move and
[9:00] intertwine
[9:01] and begin to wrap its its itself around
[9:04] the word and move down through and you
[9:06] begin to see nothing's ever changed
[9:08] it's the same thing it was then as it is
[9:10] now and god has equipped us to overcome
[9:15] he said genesis is the seed book or the
[9:17] crop book where god planted first
[9:19] and satan planted the tares and it all
[9:21] comes down as a vine growing up and
[9:23] today
[9:24] we're at the harvest time of the whole
[9:25] thing but every cult that we got on the
[9:28] earth today with time and
[9:29] historians like hislops to babylon
[9:31] josephus and many of the early writers
[9:34] we could go back there and prove every
[9:36] cult with
[9:37] uh every action that it's got begin in
[9:40] genesis
[9:41] and the church of the living god begin
[9:43] in genesis so i'm not just going to find
[9:45] the origin of every cult but i'm going
[9:47] to find my origin
[9:49] in genesis amen it says so the vines are
[9:52] growing right up but by their fruit you
[9:54] know what they are
[9:55] by what they produce maybe lord willing
[9:58] i'll speak on it one night
[9:59] before we leave the true and false vine
[10:03] then he says in israel in the church
[10:04] part four for this is the day brethren
[10:07] you'll bear me record a day of isms
[10:09] i've been studying genesis now for two
[10:11] years of genesis
[10:13] that's the beginning the going forth the
[10:15] seed chapter
[10:16] and you notice that all those cults of
[10:18] this day are beginning in genesis
[10:20] they had their start back in genesis
[10:22] winding up out here in the last day
[10:25] for instance many of them like how the
[10:27] formal religion begin and came
[10:29] how it come on out and come down through
[10:31] the sons of noah ham
[10:32] out of ham he had nimrod nimrod bit that
[10:35] built the tower of babel
[10:36] babel comes on down through king
[10:38] nebuchadnezzar's time and
[10:39] on out into revelations babylon how that
[10:42] little seed started way
[10:44] back there at the east side of the gates
[10:45] of eden coming on down
[10:47] winding out all kinds of cults and
[10:50] everything started back there
[10:51] winding themselves out to the end all
[10:54] the way back when
[10:55] came offering the wrong kind of worship
[10:58] to god
[10:58] a cain of his own desire of his own
[11:01] choosing of his own reasoning began
[11:03] to start a kind of worship amen that
[11:06] would continue all the way down through
[11:07] and you'll find it all the way in the
[11:09] book of revelations in chapter 17.
[11:12] started at the very beginning goes all
[11:14] the way to the end
[11:16] so let's look at genesis chapter five
[11:20] and for a subject tonight i want to talk
[11:22] about two buildings
[11:23] for two purposes two buildings
[11:27] for two purposes so it's very easy to
[11:30] understand what we're going to talk
[11:31] about
[11:31] there's going to be two there's going to
[11:33] be two buildings that are constructed
[11:35] and they're for two different purposes
[11:37] and these two buildings are going to
[11:38] straddle the flood one before and one
[11:40] after
[11:41] we want to talk about two buildings and
[11:43] two purposes
[11:45] genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and
[11:48] enoch lived 65 years and began begotten
[11:50] methuselah
[11:52] and enoch walked with god after he begat
[11:54] methuselah
[11:55] 300 years and begot sons and daughters
[11:58] and all the days of enoch were 360 and
[12:00] five years
[12:01] and enoch walked with god and he was not
[12:04] for god took him
[12:06] so here we have an introduction to the
[12:09] seventh from
[12:10] adam this man named enoch and we know by
[12:12] the scriptures
[12:14] he is a prophet jude tells us that he
[12:17] prophesied he was the seventh from adam
[12:19] jude chapter 1 verse 14. he says enoch
[12:22] also the seventh from adam prophesied
[12:24] of thee saying behold the lord cometh
[12:25] when ten thousand of his saints
[12:27] so enoch was prophesying of the return
[12:30] of the lord he was prophesying of our
[12:32] day he was prophesying in the end time
[12:34] all the way back in the beginning he was
[12:35] the seventh from adam brother adam tells
[12:37] us he's a type of the
[12:39] the seventh church age amen and there's
[12:41] going to be a rapture
[12:42] in the seventh church age and so he
[12:45] begins to type all this out and we get
[12:47] introduced to this enoch
[12:48] keep your place in genesis and let's
[12:50] turn to hebrews 11
[12:52] together we want to read about this
[12:56] brother enoch hebrews 11
[13:00] and 5.
[13:03] by faith enoch was translated that he
[13:06] should not see
[13:06] death and was not found because god had
[13:10] translated him
[13:11] for before his translation he had this
[13:13] testimony that he pleased god
[13:16] and we know that the scripture tells us
[13:17] that after he begot methuselah he walked
[13:19] with the lord
[13:21] 300 years so in his walking with the
[13:23] lord
[13:25] he pleased the lord he said that he
[13:27] pleased god
[13:28] but verse 6 says but without faith it is
[13:31] impossible
[13:32] to please him for he that cometh to god
[13:36] must believe that he is
[13:37] and that he is a rewarder of him that
[13:38] diligently seek him
[13:40] so now we find out this mystery of the
[13:43] walk with god because he
[13:45] he walked with the lord but it says that
[13:47] that before he was translated he was
[13:49] found
[13:50] that that uh it says here that before
[13:54] his translation god before god
[13:57] translated before his translation
[13:59] he had this testimony that he pleased
[14:01] god
[14:02] so enoch pleased god but there's only
[14:05] one way to please
[14:06] god and the only way you can please god
[14:08] is by faith
[14:10] so enoch amen we're going to talk about
[14:13] enoch
[14:13] we're going to talk about the pyramid
[14:15] that he built because brother benham
[14:16] tells us that enoch built the great
[14:18] pyramid
[14:19] amen in egypt and and enoch built that
[14:22] structure
[14:23] amen but it wasn't enoch's works that
[14:26] pleased god amen
[14:27] it was enoch's faith that pleased god
[14:31] and so we want to talk about this and
[14:33] look at this but i want to go to one
[14:34] other scripture
[14:36] in isaiah we can go to isaiah 19.
[14:50] isaiah 19 and verse 19
[14:57] in that day shall there be an altar to
[14:59] the lord in the midst of the land of
[15:00] egypt
[15:01] and a pillar at the border thereof to
[15:03] the lord
[15:04] so at the border of egypt there's a
[15:06] pillar unto the lord
[15:08] and that pillar is the pyramid
[15:10] [Music]
[15:11] a pillar at the border there to the lord
[15:13] and it shall be for a sign and for a
[15:15] witness unto the lord
[15:16] of the host in the land of egypt for
[15:18] they shall cry unto the lord because of
[15:20] the oppressors and he shall send them a
[15:22] savior
[15:22] and a great one and he shall deliver
[15:24] them
[15:26] amen so brother brahm says in the in the
[15:29] message adoption part 4
[15:31] from 1960 it says god wrote three bibles
[15:35] one of them was the zodiac in the skies
[15:37] that's the first bible man was to look
[15:38] up to realize that god is from above
[15:41] follow the zodiac did you ever study it
[15:44] it
[15:44] even gives every age even the cancer age
[15:47] it gives the beginning the birth of
[15:48] christ
[15:49] what is the figure in the first figure
[15:50] in the zodiac the virgin what's the last
[15:52] figure leo the lion
[15:54] the first coming and second coming of
[15:55] christ all of it's written in there
[15:58] then the next bible was written was in
[15:59] stone called pyramid
[16:01] god wrote in the pyramids if you study
[16:03] them watch the ancient histories and
[16:05] wars
[16:05] how they were built before the
[16:07] antediluvian destruction
[16:09] the third was wrote on paper the bible
[16:12] for the great smart intellectual world
[16:13] to come
[16:14] now as god has moved down through the
[16:16] age we're at leo the lion
[16:18] we're at the capping of the pyramid
[16:20] we're in the book of revelations at the
[16:22] last chapter
[16:24] amen brother branham says there's three
[16:26] bibles amen the
[16:27] zodiac the the pyramid amen and the and
[16:30] then the
[16:31] the written bible that we have in paper
[16:33] but he
[16:34] but brother bam is going to be very
[16:35] clear he's now in 1960 adoption he's
[16:38] preaching
[16:38] he says now we've come to leo the lion
[16:41] so he's pointing to the first bible and
[16:43] shows you where we are in the bible
[16:44] he points to the second one he says now
[16:46] we're at the capping time of the pyramid
[16:48] and then he points to this bible he says
[16:49] now we're in the book of revelation in
[16:51] the last chapter
[16:53] hey i don't know about you but it looks
[16:55] like the end of the book the end of the
[16:56] book the end of the book
[16:59] amen so it doesn't matter which book you
[17:02] look at
[17:03] which gospel he wrote amen we're at the
[17:05] end of the book
[17:08] and the message perseverant from 64 says
[17:11] noah was
[17:12] living in a scientific age when they was
[17:15] perhaps could shoot at the moon with
[17:16] radar
[17:17] jesus said it was a day like this as it
[17:20] was in the days of noah so will it be
[17:22] in the coming of the son of man now we
[17:25] know down in egypt we see these pyramids
[17:28] we could not reproduce them today we
[17:30] have no power to do it
[17:31] they had a hold of atomic power or some
[17:33] kind of power that built the pyramids
[17:36] we couldn't put these boulders up there
[17:37] by no means neither could we reproduce
[17:39] that sphinx
[17:40] there is no way of doing it we don't
[17:42] have the material to make a mummy embalm
[17:44] a body that looks even natural for
[17:46] thousands of years we've lost that art a
[17:48] dye that won't fade out
[17:50] many many things they had then that we
[17:53] are completely blind of
[17:54] and they built that pyramid so setting
[17:56] so sinner in the earth
[17:58] no matter where the sun is there's never
[17:59] a shadow around it never a shadow at the
[18:01] pyramid
[18:02] oh the architecture the instruments they
[18:05] had
[18:06] is far beyond now
[18:09] i read this for a purpose because
[18:12] we know that that noah lived in a
[18:15] scientific day we understand that
[18:17] uh brother ben starts talking about they
[18:19] had advanced science
[18:20] more advanced than our science and our
[18:23] science is growing fast because it's got
[18:25] to match that day amen as it was in the
[18:27] day of noah so it has to be in this day
[18:29] in the coming of the son of man so
[18:32] but the reason
[18:36] i want to look at that is because
[18:39] brother brahm told us that cain's line
[18:41] amen were smart and shrewd and
[18:43] intellectual
[18:44] and scientific and they had all of this
[18:47] development and all this technology
[18:49] amen and in seth's line were
[18:52] simple sheepherders and farmers and all
[18:55] that amen but
[18:56] but you realize enoch built the pyramid
[19:00] and he used technology he said they
[19:03] built that pyramid with some sort of
[19:04] atomic power
[19:05] or something that we don't have today
[19:07] amen and when when noah amen when noah
[19:10] built the ark amen there was a lot of
[19:12] technology that went into that ark
[19:15] amen to get it constructed to hold up to
[19:17] the rain to the waves to the wind
[19:19] to whatever beating it was going to be
[19:21] it had to be constructed it had to be
[19:23] engineered it had to take the abuse it
[19:25] had to hold up for the duration
[19:27] amen it had to have enough room enough
[19:29] chambers it had to have a place for
[19:31] storing food a way for collecting water
[19:33] amen a way to get light on the inside i
[19:36] mean there was a lot of technology
[19:38] in there amen and in the pyramid it took
[19:40] a lot of technology to build the pyramid
[19:42] it was precisely measured it was
[19:44] accurately surveyed
[19:45] amen it was leveled on a level plane
[19:48] amen there's a lot of technology that
[19:49] went into that
[19:50] amen and so when we look at you know
[19:53] they're simple
[19:54] sheepherders and farmers it doesn't mean
[19:56] that god can't pluck up a sheep herder
[19:58] and a farmer
[19:59] and do marvelous things with them
[20:02] things that are breathtaking things that
[20:03] are standing to this day
[20:05] when most everything else that a man has
[20:07] made has crumbled and fallen to ruin
[20:09] amen but there's a pyramid still
[20:11] standing there that was made by a simple
[20:13] sheepherder or farmer amen because the
[20:15] simple sheep of her farmer wasn't using
[20:18] his own mind
[20:21] amen he wasn't using his own mind he
[20:23] wasn't using his own intellect amen
[20:25] enoch was not the architect of that
[20:28] pyramid
[20:28] god was the architect of that pyramid
[20:31] but he was a prophet who could catch the
[20:33] dimensions who could catch the technique
[20:35] who could catch what god wanted amen and
[20:37] he would do it the way god said do it
[20:40] maybe he didn't even understand why he
[20:42] was doing it that way
[20:44] but all he had to do was do it the way
[20:46] it was shown to him
[20:47] the way the father said and if he did it
[20:49] that way there would be a monument that
[20:51] would be standing as a pillar in egypt
[20:53] for a sign today
[20:57] so it doesn't mean hey we use technology
[20:59] to spread the word of god amen
[21:01] we we use internet and we use all kinds
[21:04] of
[21:05] you know i don't even know the name of
[21:06] the stuff that we use
[21:10] but it's not about figuring out it's not
[21:12] about being wise it's not about the
[21:13] wisdom of
[21:14] man it's about the simplicity to do what
[21:17] god says do
[21:18] and watch the miraculous follow watch
[21:21] the amazement
[21:22] i mean how many times what we'll say
[21:25] this way i'll use it for an example you
[21:27] know so many times
[21:29] you make choices in life and you don't
[21:31] know why you're doing it but
[21:32] god shuts the door he opens a door he
[21:35] gives you a check or
[21:36] he gives you a green line and you don't
[21:37] know why but you'll buy that property or
[21:40] you'll sell this one or you'll hold off
[21:41] or you'll
[21:42] buy this car you don't have a good
[21:43] feeling about that one amen you don't
[21:45] have the wisdom to figure it out but
[21:47] you've got the leadership of the holy
[21:48] ghost
[21:49] and many times we've made decisions
[21:50] sometimes because we got forced into a
[21:52] corner
[21:54] sometimes because we had no other choice
[21:57] amen but we knew
[21:58] god was in charge we knew god was our
[22:00] father and we moved forward anyways
[22:02] and 10 years later you find out that was
[22:03] the only choice
[22:05] that would work that was the only thing
[22:07] and people say how did you know to sell
[22:09] then how did you know not to sell then
[22:11] how did you know to wait and all the
[22:13] prices were going to come down
[22:16] you can say all i was doing was watching
[22:18] the sheep
[22:22] see mankind wants to be smart
[22:27] you know the thing that we fight is that
[22:30] old hybrid nature within us
[22:33] that wants to be somebody wants to act
[22:36] like we know we got our act together
[22:38] i knew i was watching the market and i
[22:40] knew that these key indicators i was
[22:42] going to pull the trigger and double my
[22:44] money
[22:47] my goodness if you're a son of god he'll
[22:49] let you lose your money
[22:52] because he wants the leadership i think
[22:56] you know watching this trend this is
[22:58] going i'm going to buy this and i'm
[22:59] going to buy a bunch of these
[23:01] all these widgets because in in five
[23:03] years everybody's going to want these
[23:05] widgets and
[23:05] you know what happened five years from
[23:07] later now to go the other way and you'll
[23:09] have a trailer load of widgets that
[23:10] nobody wants
[23:14] i mean we had people buying beanie
[23:17] babies because they're going to be worth
[23:18] millions
[23:19] who wants a beanie baby today
[23:23] these are going to be collector's items
[23:25] there's going to be a hot market it was
[23:26] a hot market for a year or two
[23:30] but so many times in our lives by the
[23:32] leadership of god sometimes without us
[23:34] even knowing it just the circumstances
[23:35] of life
[23:36] amen god leads in a way we would have
[23:38] never chose we couldn't figure out
[23:40] we didn't understand but it was perfect
[23:44] where we went to school what job we got
[23:46] when we started when we stopped
[23:48] amen it was perfect amen it was perfect
[23:51] and it works out perfect
[23:53] and it's beyond stellar the way it works
[23:55] out amen
[23:56] and we could be just as mesmerized as
[23:58] noah was when he finished the boat
[24:00] and it worked it floated amen
[24:04] and it worked and it was comfortable and
[24:05] it was dry and there's room for all the
[24:07] animals and
[24:08] everything god told him to build fit
[24:10] just right and
[24:11] there was the right amount of room for
[24:13] all the animals and he never had to
[24:14] count
[24:15] animals he never had to count space he
[24:17] didn't have to do square footage
[24:18] calculations
[24:21] but if he built the way god said i mean
[24:23] by the time all the animals were
[24:25] gathered in
[24:26] seven pairs of clean animals a pair of
[24:28] unclean animals
[24:29] amen there was room for them all food
[24:31] enough for the entire journey
[24:35] i don't know how noah may not have known
[24:38] how
[24:39] we've got to follow the leadership of
[24:41] the lord
[24:44] and now enoch builds this pyramid
[24:48] and he is one of those simple brother
[24:51] venom said all of seth's line was
[24:53] simple maybe he said maybe ignorant when
[24:57] he talked about noah
[24:58] i mean illiterate sheepherders and
[25:02] farmers
[25:03] i tell you friends we don't have to have
[25:06] life figured out
[25:09] we just have to stick with the word
[25:13] and let the word let the word
[25:16] do its own work
[25:20] brother rem says in the true easter seal
[25:23] from 1961
[25:24] so there's no top on the pyramid what is
[25:27] it enoch built it before the flood
[25:30] it was a memorial that's the reason
[25:31] never destroyed during the time of the
[25:33] flood
[25:33] there's nothing destroyed it because it
[25:36] is a memorial
[25:37] so god had it built to be a memorial
[25:40] he intended it for it to stay he
[25:43] intended it for to be in a memorial
[25:45] amen if you think about it
[25:49] that structure that giant structure
[25:52] survived the flood
[25:54] it was built in such a way that it would
[25:56] survive the flood god
[25:58] knew the flood was coming amen when god
[26:00] had enoch building
[26:01] he built it to survive the flood
[26:04] and so you can see how
[26:08] after the flood maybe those who
[26:11] who who you know after the destruction
[26:13] and known as family come out
[26:15] and men begin to multiply on the face of
[26:17] the earth and the story of the
[26:19] destruction and the story of the flood
[26:20] is passed down
[26:21] amen but the people can see that there's
[26:24] still this pyramid that survived
[26:27] and that pyramid it made it through amen
[26:29] because the word of god is not destroyed
[26:32] by the judgment of god the word of god
[26:33] will stand amen
[26:35] and there's a judgment coming to this
[26:36] earth a judgment of fire but the word of
[26:38] god and all the attributes all the word
[26:41] of god you and i
[26:42] and every seed of god are going to make
[26:44] it through the judgment and be still
[26:46] standing
[26:47] that pyramid that city that temple that
[26:49] tabernacle
[26:50] will be standing on the other side
[26:53] because god built this one
[26:55] god's the architect of this building
[26:57] we're the lively stones that he's shaped
[26:59] by the word
[26:59] amen and what does he use to do it amen
[27:02] who built that
[27:02] pyramid god built that pyramid but he
[27:04] used enoch
[27:07] amen and god has built this church amen
[27:09] through seven church ages
[27:11] god has done it but he's done it through
[27:12] apostles and prophets and pastors and
[27:14] teachers and evangelists and he's done
[27:16] it through brothers and sisters because
[27:18] iron sharpeneth iron so there's a man
[27:20] sharpened at the countenance of his
[27:21] friend
[27:22] and god has used people to build
[27:26] this pyramid of his bride and it'll
[27:29] stand the destruction it'll be on the
[27:30] other side
[27:33] brother brahma goes on and talk about
[27:34] this pyramid in the 70 weeks of daniel
[27:37] he says now
[27:38] then after that age lived by the
[27:41] wesleyan age come in the
[27:42] pentecostal age with the baptism of the
[27:44] holy ghost see you're shaping up
[27:46] all the time now remember that headstone
[27:48] wasn't on it yet why
[27:50] they they shaped the church exactly or
[27:52] their pyramid in shape to fit the
[27:54] headstone
[27:55] oh friends catch that
[27:59] they they the pyramid is shaped to fit
[28:02] the headstone
[28:04] the headstone is not shaped to fit the
[28:06] pyramid
[28:08] and the pyramid is the body of the
[28:10] church and the headstone is christ
[28:12] amen and the church has been built over
[28:15] seven church ages to
[28:16] fit the headstone amen the headstone is
[28:19] not adjusting to the church
[28:21] the church is being shaped to fit into
[28:23] the headstone
[28:24] we're growing up unto all things unto
[28:26] the head which is christ
[28:30] so god has been shaping god has been
[28:32] building amen he's been building his
[28:34] his tabernacle with the living stones
[28:38] but brother abraham says you know why
[28:40] didn't they put the pyramid
[28:41] on and then they can't cap or when they
[28:43] put the cap they can't put the cap on
[28:45] till the
[28:45] end but you realize the cap had to be
[28:48] known from the beginning
[28:50] the revelation of the capstone has to be
[28:52] primary
[28:53] because the whole building is building
[28:55] to the measurement of the capstone
[28:57] so there must be the revelation of the
[29:00] capstone
[29:01] first before the building
[29:04] amen you can never build the building to
[29:06] match the headstone
[29:09] amen that's why christ came first the
[29:12] headstone came first
[29:13] and he became the cornerstone now the
[29:15] cornerstone will become the head of the
[29:17] corner
[29:18] the headstone amen so now everything is
[29:21] building
[29:21] into christ and that's how this pyramid
[29:23] was built
[29:25] so now there's a there's a mystery
[29:27] laying there
[29:28] amen and when especially us as believers
[29:31] when we look at the pyramid
[29:33] the attraction in the pyramid is the
[29:36] missing piece
[29:39] i mean it's amazing structure you walk
[29:41] up to it and what it would have looked
[29:42] like before they took the casing stones
[29:44] off i can't imagine
[29:45] it would have been smooth limestone
[29:47] white on polished white
[29:49] it would show it would shine and the
[29:51] sunlight
[29:52] and it would almost glow it must have
[29:55] been an amazing sight to see it was
[29:56] humongous it was perfect
[29:58] it was perfectly smooth it reflected
[30:00] perfectly amen
[30:02] but there's no way after walking around
[30:04] and looking at this it doesn't take very
[30:06] long to your
[30:07] your attraction your attention goes to
[30:09] the part that's missing
[30:12] because there's a hidden mystery
[30:16] and the mystery is the missing piece the
[30:17] mystery is the capsule and the mystery
[30:19] is the seventh seal
[30:22] amen same thing for us he's building it
[30:24] building it building it
[30:26] because the great climax is the coming
[30:28] of christ
[30:30] the cap off his pyramid
[30:33] he said the pyramid is shaped to fit the
[30:36] headstone
[30:39] that means when the plane is leveled
[30:43] it's leveled with the headstone in mind
[30:49] it has to be because you have to know
[30:51] how wide to make the base
[30:53] and what angle you're going to make it
[30:54] to match the angles of the headstone
[30:56] so when they're clearing the base and
[30:58] they're laying the limestone foundation
[31:00] or whatever stone i don't remember what
[31:02] stone it was
[31:02] they're clearing a plane a huge plane
[31:05] and they're getting huge stones in there
[31:06] for the foundation to support this
[31:08] weight
[31:08] they enoch already has a revelation of
[31:12] the capstone
[31:13] before he ever starts clearing the land
[31:17] everything that's done through the bible
[31:20] friends
[31:21] remember this is the second bible amen
[31:23] everything that's done
[31:24] in the building of this bible the
[31:26] writing of this bible everything has to
[31:28] do with the headstone
[31:31] it's all built to the headstone it's all
[31:33] built with the headstone in mind
[31:34] it's all built to this grand final
[31:36] climax of the headstone uniting with the
[31:38] body
[31:39] and the whole bible is written for that
[31:41] moment for that purpose
[31:44] everything you read has the headstone in
[31:46] mind everything that's written
[31:48] all the foundation the seed chapter that
[31:50] was laid everything that god said and
[31:52] did in shadows and times
[31:53] it all has the capstone in mind it's all
[31:55] about the seventh seal it's all about
[31:57] the captain the head connecting with the
[31:59] body
[32:01] everything we read he said but the
[32:04] headstone never did come
[32:05] oh you see where i'm at don't you the
[32:08] ministry from luther
[32:10] until the end of pentecost in that
[32:11] little bitty minority up there
[32:13] that's the reason the light almost goes
[32:15] out in the age there on the calendar on
[32:16] the chart
[32:17] it's the pentecostal age the pentecost
[32:19] are not the pentecostal denominations
[32:21] because they've done just exactly like
[32:23] the laodicean
[32:24] they are laodicean they did like the
[32:26] nicolaitans organized
[32:28] but the true church all over the world
[32:30] is shaped down to a place
[32:32] there's come a ministry among them just
[32:34] exactly like the ministry of jesus
[32:36] christ
[32:37] now what they got they got the thing in
[32:39] condition now
[32:40] what's the next thing this rejected
[32:43] stone to the pyramid cut out of the
[32:44] mountain without what without hands
[32:47] god sent it do you see it the rejected
[32:49] one the rejected stone
[32:50] is the head is the head the capstone and
[32:54] everyone they rejected through this
[32:56] gentile ages
[32:57] is christ and the very ones are the very
[33:01] one that they rejected through this
[33:03] gentile age is christ
[33:04] christ is the rejected stone and christ
[33:07] was not cut out and put there as a vicar
[33:09] or a son of god or some great dignitary
[33:12] in the church i want you to listen this
[33:13] he said the hat the headstone's not
[33:15] going to be a pope a great dignitary a
[33:17] vicar
[33:18] this is he's talking about christ the
[33:20] rejected stone
[33:22] he said he's not i won't read this again
[33:24] christ was not cut out and put in here
[33:26] as vicar or son or son of god or some
[33:29] great dignitary in the church
[33:30] he's the holy spirit
[33:34] and the cap of the pyramid will be
[33:36] christ coming well what way will he be
[33:39] coming
[33:39] it'll be the full measure of the holy
[33:41] spirit back in the church again
[33:43] the capstone do you see it amen
[33:47] 1962 in the message perseverance so the
[33:51] church now
[33:52] if the headstone comes in luther's time
[33:54] look what out of the way place it would
[33:56] have been
[33:57] so if you're building the pyramid and
[33:59] you're only getting so far and you stop
[34:01] and you try to put the headstone down
[34:02] there
[34:04] it doesn't fit it can't come
[34:07] to the right time
[34:12] look if it come in wesley's time it'll
[34:14] come in its own predestinated time
[34:16] but the church will be joined will be
[34:19] honed in
[34:20] such a condition until the church
[34:22] ministry will be so close
[34:23] and be just exactly the same kind of
[34:25] ministry that jesus had
[34:27] to make it all fit together for the
[34:28] rapture like the head
[34:30] knows more than the feet see the eyes
[34:32] are more in use than the feet
[34:34] the eyes is a prophet of the church
[34:37] it foresees and all these things come
[34:40] in the head the head part
[34:43] so if the eyes were here that's the head
[34:46] part
[34:48] the headship was coming the son of man
[34:50] amen the son of man ministry was coming
[34:53] the capstone was coming the holy ghost
[34:55] was coming back in the church
[34:59] so we know as this great pyramid was
[35:02] built it was actually the second bible
[35:04] being written
[35:06] and it was all written with the seventh
[35:08] seal in mind it was all written with the
[35:10] capstone with christ in mind
[35:12] everything was done in preparation
[35:14] everything was built and fashioned
[35:15] according
[35:16] to the capstone
[35:20] and and they took stones
[35:23] amen took stones
[35:27] and the stones were shaped and placed
[35:31] and each stone had a place and not all
[35:34] the stones are the same shape
[35:37] so there's there's all kinds of stones
[35:40] of irregular shape and
[35:42] and different dimensions in different
[35:44] ways amen because god
[35:46] was going to make amen this this temple
[35:49] out of a mini-member
[35:50] body you and i and his peace taking the
[35:53] stones
[35:54] and he's not creating anything enoch is
[35:57] not
[35:58] recreating anything all enoch is doing
[36:00] is taking what god's placed in the earth
[36:02] and he's shaping it he's not changing
[36:06] what it is he's shaping it to fit into
[36:08] its place
[36:10] when we came to the earth amen the word
[36:12] is shaping us to fit into our
[36:14] predestinated place
[36:17] so he's he he's just shaping he's just
[36:19] taking the stone and shaping it
[36:21] and putting it to its place and i
[36:23] believe it was all done by revelation
[36:27] and everything was built for the
[36:29] headstone
[36:31] and then we had the flood and and god
[36:34] would pull out another simple shepherd
[36:36] and no one he would begin to give him
[36:38] dimensions of a boat and
[36:40] the technology of the boat and the
[36:41] construction of a boat and tell them
[36:43] what kind of wood to use and how to
[36:45] pitch it inside and out and how to
[36:46] prepare it then we would have a flood
[36:48] that would destroy
[36:49] would destroy what man's made would
[36:50] destroy man off the face of the earth
[36:52] amen
[36:53] but that testimony that memorial will
[36:55] live on
[36:57] but after the flood right after when men
[36:59] begin to populate
[37:01] we see that men congregate together to
[37:03] build another
[37:04] building of great magnitude
[37:08] and that's the one i want to look at now
[37:11] and brother brahma says in the message
[37:12] oneness from 1962
[37:16] said a false union brought judgment on
[37:18] the earth to even adam
[37:19] in eden and a false union brought the
[37:22] floods of god's judgment on the earth
[37:23] because the daughters of cain flirted
[37:25] with the sons of god
[37:26] and they fell for it and united together
[37:28] again there you are
[37:29] false union nothing could nothing could
[37:32] happen
[37:33] what did god do he destroyed the whole
[37:34] thing all but precious old noah and his
[37:37] family
[37:37] they got together and again after that
[37:40] after the death of noah
[37:41] that spiritual family of noah first
[37:43] thing you know the children of man began
[37:44] to look at one another again
[37:46] what did they do they said now we're not
[37:48] infidels
[37:49] we all believe in god pay attention
[37:53] we all believe in god
[37:56] and these are going to be primarily
[37:58] directed by the sons of ham
[38:00] ham begot cush cush begotten nimrod
[38:03] nimrod's the one who's going to build
[38:04] this
[38:05] this tower of babel and this is what
[38:07] we're getting into now
[38:08] but he says we're not infidels we all
[38:10] believe in god
[38:12] so the foundation of the tower of babel
[38:15] was not
[38:16] that was not based on uh uh
[38:19] some new uh deity
[38:23] it was it was saying we believe in god
[38:25] we believe in the one god
[38:27] we believe in the god who created all
[38:29] things
[38:30] so so look at the foundation so they got
[38:33] a fellow by a leader some great
[38:35] archbishop by the name of nimrod
[38:37] and they built a tower i love
[38:40] how brother branham mixes these
[38:41] terminologies he's talking about nimrod
[38:44] and he calls him an archbishop or a
[38:46] bishop
[38:48] one place i think it was if i remember
[38:49] right he called him a pope
[38:51] what's brother brahm trying to do he's
[38:52] trying to take the story of nimrod and
[38:54] plant it right here today
[38:56] so we don't miss the whole point of the
[38:59] story this is the seed
[39:00] this is the beginning of the catholic
[39:02] church and false religion
[39:04] amen and now this is the beginning of
[39:06] the the and the harlots amen
[39:09] but it started off by saying hey we're
[39:11] not infidels we all believe in god
[39:13] so they got this great archbishop by the
[39:15] name of nimrod and they built a tower
[39:17] they wasn't infidels but they believed
[39:19] there was a heaven
[39:20] they believed there was a hell they
[39:22] believed in judgments but the children
[39:24] of god were the daughters of man again
[39:26] and they made themselves a union falsely
[39:28] and built a great big cathedral a great
[39:31] big
[39:32] organization and all the other places
[39:35] was to babel was to pay tribute to it
[39:38] and they said i tell you what we can do
[39:41] you know we're smart where'd they get
[39:43] that wisdom
[39:44] from the devil this wasn't the
[39:47] simple sheep herder smart
[39:50] this wasn't the simple sheep herder amen
[39:53] that can
[39:54] construct a building that would be the
[39:55] second bible written that would make it
[39:57] through the judgment of god
[39:59] this was a different kind of wisdom a
[40:01] different kind of smart
[40:04] one one was wise by humility
[40:09] by simplicity and one was wise by a
[40:12] demonic anointing
[40:14] there's two kind of wisdom there's the
[40:16] wisdom that comes from god the wisdom of
[40:18] god
[40:18] and that always comes through humility
[40:20] and simplicity
[40:22] the wisdom of god comes when you say i
[40:25] know
[40:26] nothing when you say i can't figure it
[40:29] out i don't understand it
[40:31] i don't know what to do next i don't
[40:32] know what the right choice is
[40:34] i'm all tangled up on the inside and god
[40:36] if you don't show me the way i can't
[40:38] take a step
[40:40] and then all of a sudden the wisdom of
[40:41] god comes down in the leadership of the
[40:43] holy ghost
[40:43] amen you pick that foot up and he puts
[40:45] it right down in the right spot
[40:48] and all of a sudden you find out the
[40:49] walk is ordained
[40:51] so there's a two different kinds of
[40:53] wisdom here
[40:55] he says you know we're smart where they
[40:57] get that wisdom from the devil that's
[40:59] exactly
[40:59] they got it from the devil like eve did
[41:02] got it from the devil so they said we'll
[41:03] build ourself an
[41:04] organization will please god
[41:08] oh this is cain's religion moving on
[41:11] cain's religion more advanced
[41:14] will please god and i'll tell you what
[41:16] we'll do
[41:17] we'll all have little stair steps we'll
[41:19] run up and sing and enjoy with the
[41:21] angels
[41:22] and come back down here and live the way
[41:24] we want to
[41:26] look at this the the reason this is so
[41:28] important amen
[41:29] what brother benham is telling us he's
[41:31] not just telling us the story of nimrod
[41:33] he's showing us the seed the beginning
[41:35] how this thing started and we'll get
[41:37] into religion where people will go out
[41:39] on a drinking drunken spree with
[41:41] adultery and all of that
[41:43] on a friday night as long as they can go
[41:45] to the confessional booth on saturday
[41:47] and confess it what are they doing
[41:49] they're climbing up the tower of babel
[41:50] to go to heaven to sing
[41:52] to come back down to earth to live any
[41:53] way they want
[41:55] you say well that's the catholic church
[41:57] i tell your friends the protestants are
[41:58] guilty of the same thing
[42:00] and we can be guilty of it in the
[42:01] message too i do my religious duty i do
[42:04] my devotion i say i believe the message
[42:06] but i still
[42:07] at the core of it do what i want to do
[42:09] anyways
[42:14] the truth friends
[42:17] seen people make choices amen that are
[42:20] contrary to the word of god
[42:22] contrary to the message amen but they'll
[42:24] stay religious amen and they'll stay in
[42:26] the church or stay in the message
[42:28] amen and if one church doesn't accept
[42:30] their unbelief amen and their
[42:31] disobedience to the word they'll just
[42:33] leave that church and go find another
[42:34] one and stay there
[42:35] why because they want a tower of babel
[42:38] they don't want a relationship with god
[42:40] [Applause]
[42:42] so we don't want to just say
[42:44] confessional booth amen
[42:46] and you know we that's a clear-cut
[42:48] example amen but the devil's a lot
[42:50] trickier than that amen
[42:52] he's going to slip in if he can get us
[42:54] to build our own tower of babel
[42:56] and we can take the message and
[42:57] manipulate it to our own understanding
[42:59] and build our own tower where we feel
[43:01] like we can climb up and sing with the
[43:03] angels amen and go back down and live
[43:05] any way we want
[43:08] it doesn't work that way amen i mean
[43:11] we've seen the
[43:12] scene with my own eyes i've seen and
[43:14] then things
[43:15] change since we come into the message
[43:17] dress and attire and attitudes and
[43:19] activities places we used to not want to
[43:22] go to restaurants we wouldn't go into
[43:24] amen
[43:24] and places vacations we wouldn't take
[43:26] amen and we act in ways and do things
[43:29] and play games and
[43:30] dress in ways we just not when we come
[43:32] to the message 20 years ago we wouldn't
[43:33] do it
[43:38] maybe we just got smarter
[43:42] i don't want to be smarter i don't want
[43:43] to live my own life i want to surrender
[43:45] my life i want to be that simple sheep
[43:47] herder
[43:47] says god i don't know i get so tangled
[43:50] up in myself sometimes i think i'm right
[43:51] and i find out i'm wrong
[43:53] sometimes i think i'm righteous and i
[43:55] find out it's only selfishness
[43:56] god you've got to judge me god you've
[43:58] got to take your word and shape me
[44:00] i can't do this on my own amen
[44:04] i want to surrender i want to be simple
[44:06] amen i want to
[44:08] labor in the word and i don't i want to
[44:10] take your word amen and i want to see it
[44:12] fit into its place
[44:15] don't want to i don't want to build a
[44:17] tower of babel
[44:18] [Music]
[44:19] don't want to build a religion that
[44:21] makes me feel satisfied
[44:22] why because they believed god they
[44:25] believed in a heaven they believed in a
[44:26] hell
[44:27] they believed in judgments
[44:36] i'll read that sentence again we'll run
[44:37] up and sing and enjoy with the angels
[44:39] and come back down here and live the way
[44:41] we want to
[44:43] the devil's still living see it was
[44:46] against the commandments of god they
[44:47] didn't keep his commandments
[44:49] what did god do well they built a tower
[44:51] of babel false again
[44:52] so god confused them and separated them
[44:57] they built a catholic church so god
[45:00] confused them and separated them through
[45:02] the protestant
[45:02] reformation he's done the same exact
[45:06] thing friends
[45:08] build a man-made religion amen took the
[45:10] new testament altered at nicolaitan
[45:12] cousin come
[45:12] in formed an organization built a
[45:15] catholic church amen
[45:16] and then god came down and confused it
[45:18] amen and
[45:19] separated them not into nations but in
[45:21] denominations and made it where they
[45:23] didn't understand one another's language
[45:25] the lutheran didn't understand the
[45:27] catholics and didn't understand the
[45:28] baptism didn't understand the wesleyans
[45:30] the pentecostals didn't understand the
[45:31] lutherans
[45:34] but in the end time the devil's working
[45:36] is trickery to bring it right back to a
[45:37] tower of babel again
[45:40] there was a one world religion there was
[45:42] a one world government with a one world
[45:43] religion
[45:44] and there will be again
[45:47] because what started in genesis winds up
[45:50] the same in the end
[45:54] let's look at genesis chapter 10.
[46:00] verse 8.
[46:08] genesis 10 and 8 and kush begotten
[46:10] nimrod
[46:12] he began to be a mighty one in the earth
[46:15] i just think this language is so amazing
[46:18] when you look through the genealogies it
[46:19] doesn't say this about anybody else
[46:21] and when the bible says something and
[46:22] puts emphasis on it through repetition
[46:25] amen it's to draw your attention to
[46:26] something so let's read this
[46:28] and cushby got nimrod he began to be a
[46:30] mighty one in the earth
[46:32] and he was a mighty hunter before the
[46:33] lord wherefore it is said
[46:35] even as nimrod the mighty hunter before
[46:37] the lord
[46:38] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[46:40] babel and eric
[46:42] and akkad and kaunai in the land of
[46:45] shinar
[46:46] and out of that land went forth asher
[46:48] and built in nineveh
[46:49] and in the church age book brother ben
[46:51] says he tells us that that's
[46:53] actually not correct translation he said
[46:55] he said out of that land he went forth
[46:57] to assyria and built nineveh so it's
[47:00] nimrod who built nineveh
[47:04] and the city rio both and kayla resin
[47:07] between nineveh and kayla the same
[47:08] is a great city it goes on to talk about
[47:12] some more of his accolades but
[47:14] but you realize now the bible when we're
[47:16] going through these genealogies
[47:17] amen it doesn't really tell us anything
[47:19] about cush amen amen although brother
[47:21] branham does in the church age book
[47:23] tells us about cushion but
[47:24] it doesn't it comes in nimrod and it
[47:26] said he began
[47:27] to be a mighty one in the earth
[47:30] now all of a sudden amen now the mighty
[47:33] one is not jehovah god is not the father
[47:36] god
[47:36] amen but now on the earth is rising up a
[47:39] mighty one
[47:41] now we're getting into a new
[47:42] dispensation where man will rule over
[47:45] man amen will they start to look to a
[47:47] strong one a mighty one
[47:48] to be their defender their protector
[47:50] their leader amen are no longer the
[47:52] leadership of the holy ghost
[47:55] no longer the leadership of god
[47:58] and so nimrod the name nimrod
[48:02] means rebellion rebellion
[48:06] when it says he became a mighty hunter
[48:08] before the lord
[48:10] this is not this is not a good
[48:12] connotation it's not like
[48:13] oh yeah he was a good hunter before the
[48:15] lord but it's almost
[48:17] it almost has that in the language that
[48:19] it almost denotes that he was a mighty
[48:21] hunter
[48:21] before or above amen the lord
[48:25] his fame began to grow he became mighty
[48:28] upon the earth and he became a mighty
[48:30] hunter before the lord not just in the
[48:31] presence of the lord but before the lord
[48:34] and people started to look to nimrod
[48:38] let's go look at chapter 11 verse 1.
[48:43] and the whole earth was of one language
[48:47] and of one speech
[48:50] [Music]
[48:52] we're quickly coming back to this
[48:57] the separation in languages is not so
[49:00] difficult as it used to be
[49:04] english is predominant but even if it's
[49:05] not you've got google translate on your
[49:07] phone
[49:09] i mean everything is translating so fast
[49:12] and now the earth is coming back to one
[49:14] language in one speech
[49:16] and not just one language in one one
[49:18] speech not just like everybody's
[49:19] speaking english
[49:20] but coming back to say the same thing
[49:24] the they're coming back to one way of
[49:26] thinking one frame of mind
[49:28] the whole earth is going to gather back
[49:30] to a certain mindset to a certain
[49:32] so so certain we need a mighty hunter we
[49:35] need
[49:36] a mighty one on the earth we need
[49:38] somebody to save us protect us help us
[49:40] lead us we're coming back to that
[49:43] friends
[49:46] and it came to pass as they journeyed
[49:47] from the east that they found a plane in
[49:49] the land of shinar
[49:50] and they dwelt there and they said one
[49:53] to another
[49:53] go to let us make brick and burn them
[49:57] thoroughly
[49:58] and they had brick for stone and slime
[50:00] had them from order
[50:02] and they said go to let us build us a
[50:04] city and a tower whose top may reach
[50:07] into heaven
[50:08] and let us take make us a name lest we
[50:10] be scattered abroad upon the face of the
[50:12] whole earth
[50:14] and the lord come down to see the city
[50:16] in the tower which the children of men
[50:17] builded
[50:18] and the lord said behold the people is
[50:21] one
[50:22] and they all have one language in this
[50:25] they begin to do
[50:26] and now nothing will be restrained from
[50:28] them which they have imagined
[50:31] to do look at the power
[50:34] of unity look at the power
[50:38] of unity
[50:41] go to let us go down there and confound
[50:44] their language
[50:45] and they may not understand one
[50:46] another's speech so the lord scattered
[50:49] them abroad from thence upon the face of
[50:51] the earth and they left off to build the
[50:53] city
[50:54] therefore is the name of it called babel
[50:56] because the lord did
[50:57] there confound the language of all the
[50:59] earth and from thence did the lord
[51:01] scatter them abroad
[51:02] upon the face of the earth see they were
[51:06] actually going against the will of god
[51:07] to begin with because when god
[51:09] sent them forth out of the ark he told
[51:11] them to go and replenish the earth amen
[51:14] he actually wanted them to go forth and
[51:16] go abroad
[51:17] and go out and separate and go replenish
[51:19] the earth but what they wanted to do was
[51:21] congregate together
[51:22] because they wanted to make a name for
[51:24] themselves and build a great city
[51:26] and come up with their own protection
[51:27] and their own plan and their own worship
[51:30] they wanted to become mighty amen not
[51:33] humble sheepherders with just my family
[51:35] back here on the back side of this
[51:37] mountain because that's what god wanted
[51:38] god wanted the people spread abroad
[51:40] amen but they gathered together because
[51:42] they wanted something different than
[51:44] what god wanted
[51:47] amen that's why god wants local
[51:49] assemblies with a local pastor
[51:52] sovereign local assemblies independent
[51:54] from all others
[51:55] that's what god wants not
[51:58] conglomerations not collections of ideas
[52:01] not denomination god doesn't want that
[52:03] god wants us to spread abroad amen
[52:05] and he wants individual family units he
[52:07] wants individual
[52:08] churches with individual leadership and
[52:10] there's sovereignty led by the holy
[52:12] ghost
[52:15] so brother baby says in god's chosen
[52:17] place of worship
[52:19] he said nothing is typed in the old
[52:21] testament anywhere in the bible of the
[52:23] church
[52:23] but the forced unity of babel tower
[52:26] that's the only thing that types to
[52:28] unity because it was by nimrod a wicked
[52:30] man who went out and forced all the
[52:31] little countries to come into one place
[52:34] in this great tower it was a religious
[52:36] worship of course
[52:37] but not considered in the word of god so
[52:39] there is where you see denominational
[52:41] religion type the tower of babel
[52:43] in the old testament which this religion
[52:45] was certainly a religion but not the
[52:46] religion of the word of god
[52:50] in the pergament church age out of the
[52:51] church age book he says babel is the
[52:53] original name for babylon
[52:55] it means confusion it was literally
[52:57] started by cush
[52:59] the son of ham but was brought to a
[53:01] kingdom of power and grandeur under his
[53:03] son nimrod the mighty hunter
[53:05] nimrod according to the genesis 11
[53:07] account and also according to profane
[53:09] history
[53:10] set out to accomplish three things he
[53:12] wanted to build a strong nation
[53:15] outside the will of god
[53:19] see it sounds the human reasoning under
[53:22] the logic of the devil sounds good we
[53:24] want to build a strong nation
[53:25] god never told them to build a strong
[53:27] nation
[53:28] god didn't want them to build a strong
[53:30] nation he wanted them to scatter abroad
[53:32] and replenish the earth
[53:34] but he wanted to build a strong nation
[53:36] which he did
[53:37] he wanted to propagate his own religion
[53:40] which he did and he wanted to make a
[53:43] name for himself
[53:45] which he also accomplished his
[53:48] accomplishments were so monumental that
[53:50] the kingdom of babylon was called the
[53:51] head of gold amongst all world
[53:53] governments
[53:54] that his religion gained prominence is
[53:57] proven by the fact that scriptures
[53:58] identify it with satan completely
[54:00] in isaiah chapter 14 and in revelations
[54:03] chapter 17 and 18.
[54:05] and by history we can prove that it
[54:07] invaded the whole world
[54:08] and is the basis for every system of
[54:11] idolatry
[54:12] and the theme of mythology though the
[54:14] names of the gods differ in various
[54:15] sections of the land
[54:16] according to the language of the people
[54:19] so all mythology all idolatry all cults
[54:21] and all false religions started here
[54:23] because nimrod
[54:25] wanted to make a strong nation he wanted
[54:27] to propagate his own religion
[54:29] and he wanted to make a name for himself
[54:31] that sounds
[54:32] just like lucifer saying i will i will
[54:36] i will
[54:39] well the rope says in the message united
[54:40] under one head and god said in his word
[54:43] no man can come to me except my father
[54:44] draws him first you're seeking to find
[54:46] what's drawing you
[54:47] but it's god has to draw first the
[54:50] scripture says and how true it is but we
[54:52] find out here that
[54:53] they have united under one great leader
[54:55] and when you get
[54:56] man under leadership of man then he gets
[54:59] some ideas of his own
[55:00] trying to achieve something that he can
[55:02] design or do
[55:04] himself
[55:12] brother barron ties it in the catholic
[55:15] church with babylon
[55:16] and the message of serpent seed from 58
[55:18] he said out there came
[55:20] ham him with his wife and he had a curse
[55:22] put on him from ham came nimrod who
[55:24] built babylon
[55:25] out of babylon come the catholic church
[55:27] the beginning of it
[55:33] now i want to look at this quote in the
[55:36] pergameon church age from the church age
[55:38] book
[55:39] it's out of the same section we quoted
[55:40] before it said monotheism
[55:43] turned to polytheism in babylon
[55:46] the worship of one god to multiple gods
[55:49] monotheism turned to polytheism in
[55:51] babylon the devil's lie and the devil's
[55:54] mysteries rose up
[55:55] against the truth of god and the
[55:57] mysteries of god in that city
[56:00] satan truly became the god of this world
[56:03] and exacted worship from those
[56:05] that he had duped caused them to believe
[56:08] that he was truly the lord
[56:14] see this is the danger
[56:17] of using your own reasoning
[56:20] this is the danger of going against a
[56:22] command from god
[56:24] and saying i want i want i want
[56:28] i think this is best i think we should
[56:30] do this
[56:31] i think this and the danger is that is
[56:33] that's the leadership from satan not
[56:35] from god because god will always lead
[56:36] you to stick with the word even if you
[56:38] don't understand
[56:39] even if it doesn't make sense and even
[56:41] if it looks like it's doomed for failure
[56:44] amen god the holy ghost will always keep
[56:46] you with the word
[56:48] even if it looks like it's going to
[56:49] completely fall you stay with the word
[56:53] but when you go down the path of taking
[56:55] your own mind and own wisdom we know
[56:57] that's just anointing of the devil
[56:59] amen and he he became the god of this
[57:03] world and exactly worship from those
[57:05] that he had do
[57:06] causing them to believe that he was
[57:07] truly the lord
[57:09] they were worshiping the devil but they
[57:11] believed he was truly the lord
[57:15] the polytheistic religion of the enemy
[57:17] began
[57:18] with the trinitarian doctrine it was way
[57:21] back there in antiquity that the one god
[57:23] and three persons idea came into
[57:25] existence
[57:27] so when brother branham is coming and
[57:29] he's teaching water baptism in
[57:30] jesus name and and the truth of the
[57:33] oneness of god
[57:34] what is he doing he's fighting this
[57:36] religion from all the way back in the
[57:38] tower of babel
[57:40] amen has moved all the way through and
[57:42] come through all of its various forms
[57:44] and traditions and got perfected amen
[57:46] down to a doctrine in the christian
[57:48] church and when brother benham comes out
[57:50] amen what's he doing he's restoring the
[57:52] truth amen from way back in genesis amen
[57:55] when
[57:55] everybody in the world believed in one
[57:57] god
[57:58] and he's bringing us back to the truth
[58:02] proverbs 14 12 says there was a way
[58:04] which seemeth right unto a man
[58:06] but the end thereof are the ways of
[58:08] death
[58:10] that's not the way we want to go
[58:13] and god's provided place of worship from
[58:15] 1965
[58:17] brother says and the people worship the
[58:18] devil don't even know what they're doing
[58:21] they worship the devil in churches
[58:25] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[58:27] of man creeds
[58:28] and tradition and then in
[58:33] he tells us there's people worshiping
[58:37] the devil and don't know it
[58:40] why how did we get to where we're
[58:42] worshiping the devil and don't know it
[58:44] the way we got there is we left off the
[58:46] commandment of god no matter how
[58:48] simple and humbled it looked to do
[58:49] something that seemed right in our own
[58:51] eyes
[58:52] that's how you get to worshiping the
[58:54] devil amen what they wanted to do was
[58:56] worship god
[58:57] what they thought they were doing was
[58:59] worshiping god but they were duped by
[59:00] the devil
[59:01] amen into believing that he was the lord
[59:04] and he was ex
[59:05] he was extracting their worship amen
[59:07] because god wasn't receiving their
[59:08] worship because they had left the word
[59:14] now listen to this thinking brother goes
[59:16] into in the end time evangelism
[59:18] said after noah had the ark and then
[59:20] immediately after that nimrod
[59:22] that renegade he built a tower and said
[59:24] if the floods would come
[59:26] we'll just climb up and get above it
[59:29] actually believing that they can
[59:31] circumvent the judgments of god
[59:34] actually believing that the judgments of
[59:36] god will not take effect on us
[59:38] because of our religion because of our
[59:41] tower because of our religion
[59:43] amen we will if if something happens
[59:46] we'll just stick with our religion amen
[59:49] and we'll bypass the judgment the
[59:50] judgment won't have effect on us
[59:52] because we'll stick with our religion
[59:56] nothing's changed everything remains the
[59:59] same
[1:00:00] let's go back and look at genesis 11
[1:00:03] and verse 3. and they said one to
[1:00:07] another
[1:00:08] go to let us make brick and burn them
[1:00:11] thoroughly
[1:00:12] and they have brick for stone and slime
[1:00:13] and they from mortar
[1:00:16] i mean when you come and look at this
[1:00:17] you come to a hundred percent
[1:00:19] man-made religion when
[1:00:22] when enoch built amen when he built the
[1:00:25] pyramid when he wrote the second bible
[1:00:27] he took what god had made and god had
[1:00:29] ordained and all he did was shape it
[1:00:31] they gave away god when it shaped and
[1:00:33] placed it where god wanted it placed
[1:00:35] amen but when we come to the tower of
[1:00:37] babel amen they make
[1:00:38] bricks and they bake them in the oven
[1:00:40] and they make slime for mortar
[1:00:42] it's a hundred percent man-made
[1:00:44] doctrines and creeds and traditions of
[1:00:46] man
[1:00:47] amen and they're trying to build
[1:00:49] something amen that will survive the
[1:00:51] flood
[1:00:52] amen but there's already a memorial set
[1:00:54] up that says
[1:00:55] this is what will survive the flood this
[1:00:57] is what will make it through the
[1:00:59] judgment
[1:00:59] this is what will survive and this is
[1:01:01] the only thing that will survive
[1:01:02] amen it is something that's inspired by
[1:01:04] god it is the word of god amen
[1:01:07] word upon word amen word by word that
[1:01:09] was built by the inspiration of god
[1:01:11] it survived the flood and now they're
[1:01:13] trying to replicate what god had done
[1:01:16] because that's what the devil has done
[1:01:18] in his religion in his false forms of
[1:01:19] worship
[1:01:20] he's trying to replicate the true word
[1:01:22] and the true form of worship
[1:01:26] and where did this start it started in
[1:01:28] genesis friends
[1:01:29] everything we see when you drive down
[1:01:31] the road and you see church after church
[1:01:32] after church and steeple after steeple
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:35] and people living any way that they want
[1:01:37] to live in total disregard for the word
[1:01:39] of god but they'll go back into their
[1:01:41] tower of babel every sunday
[1:01:44] and they'll climb up the steps and sing
[1:01:46] with the angels and climb back down and
[1:01:48] live any way they want
[1:01:49] and believe that if the judgment was to
[1:01:51] come i will be spared from the judgment
[1:01:53] if i stick with this tower
[1:01:56] in every corner on every street there's
[1:01:58] a steeple and
[1:01:59] a light and a sign amen what is it
[1:02:02] towers of babel
[1:02:03] towers of babel towers of babel baked
[1:02:05] bricks
[1:02:06] man he dug something out of the word he
[1:02:08] manipulated and changed it in his own
[1:02:10] fashion
[1:02:11] he heated it up for his own purpose and
[1:02:13] he made brick for stone
[1:02:15] what does that mean instead of true
[1:02:17] revelation he came up with his own
[1:02:18] understanding of the word he took the
[1:02:22] spoken word of god which was the earth
[1:02:23] that was created by the spoken word of
[1:02:25] god
[1:02:25] and he took and he dug it and he
[1:02:27] manipulated and he changed it and he
[1:02:29] ground it and he put it together and he
[1:02:31] heated it up in his own oven
[1:02:33] to make to make and he said we have
[1:02:35] bricks
[1:02:36] for stone
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:39] enoch had stone for stone
[1:02:42] enoch had the original enoch had
[1:02:44] revelation
[1:02:45] enoch had the predestinated word in a
[1:02:47] predestinated position amen
[1:02:50] because the architect had already
[1:02:52] designed it he had placed it he had put
[1:02:54] it on the earth
[1:02:54] these stones were meant to be in that
[1:02:56] spot amen and all you have to do is
[1:02:58] chisel them out of the cory and they'll
[1:03:00] fit right into where they belong
[1:03:02] [Applause]
[1:03:04] enoch had stoned for stone but nimrod
[1:03:07] made brick for stone so their revelation
[1:03:11] was
[1:03:11] based on man-made doctrines
[1:03:18] i don't know about you friends but i
[1:03:20] want stone for stone
[1:03:21] i don't want brick for my stone i don't
[1:03:23] want to build any kind of religion out
[1:03:25] of stone
[1:03:26] amendment bricks for stone i want the
[1:03:28] originals revelation the original
[1:03:30] revelation on the word that god placed
[1:03:32] there before the foundation of the world
[1:03:34] that he's carving out for a certain
[1:03:36] season for a certain time
[1:03:38] to fit in a certain place
[1:03:42] let us make brick and burn them
[1:03:45] thoroughly
[1:03:47] they had brick for stone slime had they
[1:03:50] for mortar
[1:03:52] and they said go to let us build us a
[1:03:53] city and the tower
[1:03:55] whose top may reach unto heaven let us
[1:03:58] make us a name
[1:04:01] they by their own mechanism
[1:04:04] wanted to reach god
[1:04:08] but god already had a mechanism for
[1:04:10] fellowship
[1:04:12] but they by their own mechanism by their
[1:04:14] own design
[1:04:15] by their own way wanted to get into the
[1:04:18] heavens
[1:04:19] by their own design
[1:04:23] and they wanted to make a name
[1:04:26] for themselves so that we're not
[1:04:29] scattered
[1:04:33] when enoch built that pyramid
[1:04:38] enoch was the tool in god's hand
[1:04:42] god built that pyramid god wrote that
[1:04:45] bible
[1:04:48] we have the written bible and the
[1:04:49] written bible was written by how many
[1:04:51] different authors
[1:04:53] how many different prophets pinned the
[1:04:54] pages how many different how many
[1:04:57] different ones pinned it out
[1:04:59] but who wrote the bible god wrote the
[1:05:01] bible
[1:05:04] who built the pyramid god built the
[1:05:06] pyramid but he used enoch
[1:05:12] enoch when he built the pyramid didn't
[1:05:16] chisel his name in the side of it there
[1:05:22] was nothing
[1:05:22] in that pyramid to bring glory or fame
[1:05:25] or honor to enoch
[1:05:29] it wasn't for enoch's name it wasn't for
[1:05:31] enoch's legacy
[1:05:32] it wasn't it wasn't for enoch's
[1:05:35] because what was enoch doing enoch was
[1:05:38] not
[1:05:39] enoch was not trying to make a name for
[1:05:41] himself or be a mighty one on the earth
[1:05:43] or a mighty hunter before the lord
[1:05:45] he was just humbly walking with the lord
[1:05:48] daily walking with or his interest was
[1:05:51] the lord his interest was the lord's
[1:05:52] work
[1:05:53] he was building a pyramid not to save
[1:05:55] himself
[1:05:56] not to make a name for himself and
[1:05:58] because the building of the pyramid
[1:05:59] didn't save him
[1:06:00] his faith in the word of god is what
[1:06:02] saved him
[1:06:04] but he built the pyramid because god
[1:06:06] told him to build the pyramid
[1:06:08] his building the pyramid was his love
[1:06:09] for god
[1:06:12] but his faith is what pleased god and so
[1:06:15] enoch was interested in pleasing god
[1:06:18] enoch was interested in walking with god
[1:06:20] enoch was not looking for his own
[1:06:22] protection
[1:06:23] his own salvation his own city his own
[1:06:26] name
[1:06:26] his own glory his own fame what he did
[1:06:29] he did for god
[1:06:31] what nimrod in this group did they did
[1:06:33] for themselves
[1:06:38] that's what i want to do today today
[1:06:43] i want to please god i want my faith in
[1:06:45] his word to please him
[1:06:46] i want everything i do to please him
[1:06:48] amen not build a name
[1:06:50] build fame amen have a legacy leave
[1:06:53] something behind where everybody
[1:06:54] remember you amen there's not a secret
[1:06:56] plaque
[1:06:57] amen in the in the corner of the of the
[1:06:59] pyramid that says
[1:07:01] enoch built this it wasn't for enoch
[1:07:06] and as we labor in the word of god amen
[1:07:08] as we labor revelation by revelation
[1:07:10] working in the vineyard of god
[1:07:11] amen let us do it for him not for us
[1:07:14] amen everything we do let's do it by his
[1:07:16] direction by his placing by his
[1:07:18] revelation
[1:07:18] not for our name not for our faith amen
[1:07:21] but just
[1:07:22] let our pleasure be just to walk with
[1:07:24] him
[1:07:26] because if not we'll find ourselves
[1:07:29] shortcutting the process
[1:07:30] and baking bricks
[1:07:34] so that we can go faster
[1:07:37] you know the revelation of god comes
[1:07:39] slow and steady
[1:07:43] i don't know how long it took enoch to
[1:07:45] build the pyramid
[1:07:47] he was on the earth before he's
[1:07:48] translated 365 years i don't know how
[1:07:50] long it took him
[1:07:51] but the revelation of god comes steady
[1:07:55] and i don't know that enoch i don't know
[1:07:58] i don't know that enoch
[1:07:59] could go one step further until he got
[1:08:01] more instructions from god
[1:08:05] but in the tower of babel they could go
[1:08:06] as fast as they wanted to go because
[1:08:10] they were doing it their own way
[1:08:13] sometimes we can get tempted
[1:08:17] in helping god along
[1:08:20] we want this thing to get on and we can
[1:08:23] become tempted
[1:08:25] to bake bricks to make our own
[1:08:28] revelation
[1:08:29] fit the picture so that we can take
[1:08:32] another step higher
[1:08:35] we got to get higher we got to go higher
[1:08:37] yeah we got to go higher i want to go
[1:08:39] higher
[1:08:41] but i just want to walk with him i just
[1:08:43] want to walk with the lord
[1:08:45] i want his pleasing with him and and i
[1:08:48] i'm just going to have an imagination if
[1:08:51] you allow me to have imagination
[1:08:53] i can imagine enoch walking with the
[1:08:55] lord and just that
[1:08:56] daily walk walking with the lord and
[1:08:59] they finally come by
[1:09:00] and there's a big stone over there and
[1:09:02] god says that's the next one
[1:09:06] that's the next one and he's not like
[1:09:09] praise god that's the next one and just
[1:09:11] takes it and puts it in place
[1:09:14] he wasn't the engineer he wasn't the
[1:09:16] architect
[1:09:18] you understand what i'm saying just be a
[1:09:21] sheepherder
[1:09:22] just walk with the lord don't bake
[1:09:24] bricks friends
[1:09:26] let us not bake any bricks and make our
[1:09:28] own tower and try to get another step
[1:09:30] closer to heaven to get
[1:09:31] higher in revelation god will take us
[1:09:34] there don't bake bricks
[1:09:40] brother bam says in the message the
[1:09:41] inside
[1:09:43] he said so adam
[1:09:47] to hold on to something made of fig leaf
[1:09:49] to cover his
[1:09:50] his wife's nakedness but he found out
[1:09:52] that that what he
[1:09:53] had in his hand did not work on down
[1:09:56] through the ages we could count men if
[1:09:58] we only had time
[1:09:59] let's take two or three of them anyhow
[1:10:01] let's take nimrod nimrod thought the
[1:10:03] same thing
[1:10:04] after the flood he was conscious that
[1:10:05] there was a god who would judge the
[1:10:07] wicked
[1:10:08] for they had just come out of the flood
[1:10:09] and he knew that it was sin that caused
[1:10:11] god to destroy the world
[1:10:13] therefore knowing that sin again would
[1:10:14] make god do the same thing
[1:10:16] he tried to achieve something to make a
[1:10:18] tower that
[1:10:19] men could run up in heaven if it got bad
[1:10:22] here on earth
[1:10:23] and live in heaven and then come back
[1:10:25] down on earth and sin
[1:10:26] and go back into heaven again
[1:10:30] friends that's the whole point of
[1:10:32] religion
[1:10:35] that's the roots that's the beginning
[1:10:36] that's the whole point
[1:10:38] cain never actually wanted to serve god
[1:10:42] because if cain actually wanted to serve
[1:10:45] god he would have done what god said
[1:10:47] when god said do is your brother
[1:10:50] cain wanted to worship but he didn't
[1:10:52] actually want to serve god
[1:10:54] do you understand i hope you can catch
[1:10:56] what i'm saying there's something in the
[1:10:58] heart of man that craves to worship that
[1:11:00] wants to worship
[1:11:01] amen that's why churches are so
[1:11:03] successful is because there's something
[1:11:05] in the heart of man that craves to
[1:11:06] worship
[1:11:07] amen cain wanted to worship but cain did
[1:11:10] not want to serve god
[1:11:15] and so nimrod wanted to worship
[1:11:18] but he didn't want to be obedient so the
[1:11:21] start of religion
[1:11:23] amen in cain was for
[1:11:27] self-gratification further on in the
[1:11:29] court he said now
[1:11:30] that's been the idea of men all along
[1:11:32] the road trying to sin
[1:11:34] and live in earth and be in heaven at
[1:11:36] the same time
[1:11:37] you cannot do it you can't do it you
[1:11:40] said you can't serve god and ma'am and
[1:11:42] that's the reason we believe tonight in
[1:11:43] a total abstaining from sin
[1:11:45] getting away from it it's poison do not
[1:11:47] fool around
[1:11:49] do not fool around it don't tolerate it
[1:11:52] at all
[1:11:53] have nothing at all to do with it don't
[1:11:55] don't see how close you can come to it
[1:11:57] without sinning
[1:11:58] see how far you can stay away from him
[1:12:00] anything that looks sinful stay away
[1:12:01] from it don't have anything to do with
[1:12:03] it at all
[1:12:04] so nimrod with his great mastermind he
[1:12:06] tried to achieve this and if you'll
[1:12:08] notice it's always been
[1:12:09] since man was created if you run the
[1:12:12] genealogy of cain's children they all
[1:12:14] become
[1:12:14] scientists mighty men workers in the
[1:12:16] earth with metal and wood and so forth
[1:12:18] they were smart intellectual side but
[1:12:21] says children were peasants
[1:12:23] sheepherders humble now that's the same
[1:12:26] way it is today
[1:12:27] those who are depending upon some
[1:12:29] man-made mechanical something
[1:12:31] that they can put their hands on and say
[1:12:33] this is it this is it
[1:12:35] something that man has achieved himself
[1:12:37] then you find out mostly that those kind
[1:12:39] who are trying to they're trying to
[1:12:40] escape the blood atonement
[1:12:43] back to the right way because the blood
[1:12:46] atonement
[1:12:46] amen is the blood was shed amen and the
[1:12:49] life left the blood and now it's the
[1:12:51] life that's the token for us
[1:12:53] and they're trying to avoid amen that
[1:12:55] token life
[1:12:59] now but nimrod after a while in the
[1:13:01] building of the tower god said it in the
[1:13:04] heavens and laughed at him and
[1:13:06] he come almost completing i want you to
[1:13:09] notice that he was
[1:13:10] almost achieved what he started to do
[1:13:13] but then all of a sudden god just turned
[1:13:14] the thing the other way
[1:13:16] and the thing went to pieces it went
[1:13:18] into dust just like adam's fig leaf
[1:13:20] apron went to dust
[1:13:21] so did nimrod's tower go to dust
[1:13:24] i tell your friends now at the end time
[1:13:26] he's going to just about complete
[1:13:28] the tower of babel he's just about to
[1:13:31] complete it god's going to turn it
[1:13:33] upside down again
[1:13:37] i want to read just a couple scriptures
[1:13:40] together if you turn to romans i want to
[1:13:41] read a couple scriptures in romans as we
[1:13:44] close
[1:13:55] see nimrod
[1:13:58] was building a program that didn't
[1:14:01] require faith in the word of god
[1:14:06] enoch didn't have a program
[1:14:10] enoch had a walk enoch did not have
[1:14:14] a religion enoch had a walk
[1:14:18] see we could be two people sitting in
[1:14:22] the same seat
[1:14:23] same few one can have religion and one
[1:14:26] can have a walk
[1:14:28] it doesn't matter where you go to church
[1:14:30] it matters what your motive is in your
[1:14:32] heart
[1:14:33] it's not about the right church the
[1:14:35] right ministry when we know those things
[1:14:37] are important we must be led by god to
[1:14:39] the right place where we belong under
[1:14:40] the right ministry of the word
[1:14:42] we know that but don't just think that
[1:14:44] if i land in the right spot it's
[1:14:46] automatically right with me
[1:14:47] no it's only right with you when it's
[1:14:49] right with you
[1:14:52] it's only right with you when it's right
[1:14:54] with you amen we want to
[1:14:56] have enoch's walk amen as we labor in
[1:14:59] the word
[1:15:00] revelation upon revelation we want to
[1:15:02] walk with god
[1:15:03] amen but nimrod wasn't interested in
[1:15:05] walking with god he was interested in
[1:15:07] building something that would satisfy
[1:15:08] his thirst for worship
[1:15:10] but allow him the liberty to do as he
[1:15:12] wished
[1:15:14] and we want to walk friends and enoch
[1:15:18] and his walk with god
[1:15:20] we found out in hebrews that he pleased
[1:15:22] god before his translation this was his
[1:15:24] testimony that he pleased god and the
[1:15:26] next verse says but without faith it's
[1:15:27] impossible to please god
[1:15:29] so what please god i would like to say
[1:15:31] it says it wasn't
[1:15:33] just the fact that he built the pyramid
[1:15:38] man because it wasn't the laying of the
[1:15:42] stone that pleased god
[1:15:44] it was the faith in his heart that moved
[1:15:46] him to lay the stone
[1:15:49] hope you understand what i'm saying it's
[1:15:51] not the religious acts it's not the
[1:15:53] obedience
[1:15:53] amen we can we can have a desire amen to
[1:15:57] to look good or be good or really a
[1:15:59] desire sometimes we have a desire to not
[1:16:01] be wrong
[1:16:03] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:16:05] sometimes we have a motivation to not be
[1:16:07] wrong
[1:16:08] and then that motivation to not be wrong
[1:16:10] we'll put forth some great efforts
[1:16:12] to do things that are right
[1:16:16] but sometimes that's not faith sometimes
[1:16:18] that's just fear
[1:16:22] but enoch wasn't motivated by fear enoch
[1:16:24] was motivated by faith
[1:16:27] he believed what god told him he did
[1:16:29] what god told him his action was a
[1:16:31] testimony of his faith
[1:16:33] and he pleased god but what pleased god
[1:16:36] his faith
[1:16:40] the tower of babel it was their
[1:16:43] lack of faith that caused destruction
[1:16:47] let's look at romans chapter 10 we'll
[1:16:49] just read a couple scriptures
[1:16:50] and we'll close
[1:16:56] romans chapter 10 verse 1
[1:16:59] rather in my heart's desire and prayer
[1:17:00] to god for israel is that
[1:17:02] they might be saved for i bear them
[1:17:05] record that they have a zeal of god
[1:17:06] but not according to knowledge for they
[1:17:09] being ignorant of god's righteousness
[1:17:11] and going about to establish their own
[1:17:13] righteousness
[1:17:15] have not submitted themselves unto the
[1:17:17] righteousness of god
[1:17:19] for christ is the end of the law for
[1:17:20] righteousness to
[1:17:22] everyone that believeth
[1:17:26] they read that again
[1:17:30] they were ignorant of god's
[1:17:32] righteousness
[1:17:34] they didn't understand or have no
[1:17:36] knowledge of god's righteousness
[1:17:39] and they went about to establish their
[1:17:41] own righteousness
[1:17:43] what was their own righteousness keeping
[1:17:45] the law
[1:17:47] but they were ignorant to god's
[1:17:49] righteousness because god's
[1:17:50] righteousness wasn't
[1:17:52] the obedience of keeping the law god's
[1:17:55] righteousness
[1:17:56] was faith three
[1:17:59] again let's read that again
[1:18:02] for they being ignorant of god's
[1:18:03] righteousness and going about to
[1:18:05] establish their own righteousness
[1:18:07] have not submitted themselves unto the
[1:18:08] righteousness of god
[1:18:10] for christ is the end of the law for
[1:18:11] righteousness to everyone
[1:18:14] that believeth romans chapter 1
[1:18:23] verse 17.
[1:18:27] for therein is the righteousness of god
[1:18:29] revealed from faith to faith that is
[1:18:31] written
[1:18:32] the just shall live by faith
[1:18:37] romans chapter 3 verse 21
[1:18:43] but now the righteousness of god without
[1:18:45] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[1:18:47] the law
[1:18:48] and the prophets even the righteousness
[1:18:50] of god which is by faith of jesus christ
[1:18:52] unto all and upon all them that believe
[1:18:55] for there is no difference
[1:18:59] it's the faith of jesus christ
[1:19:03] it's the faith that enoch had
[1:19:06] it's the simplicity of walking with the
[1:19:09] lord
[1:19:09] and just believing him and being humble
[1:19:12] and not getting ahead of his program
[1:19:14] not building any man-made system to
[1:19:16] justify any of my actions
[1:19:17] but just humbly walking with the lord
[1:19:19] and pleasing him because i believe his
[1:19:21] word
[1:19:22] i believe all of his word and i just
[1:19:24] want i just want to be pleasing to him
[1:19:26] i don't want to please my neighbor and i
[1:19:28] don't want to please the other person i
[1:19:29] don't want to satisfy
[1:19:32] i don't want to satisfy a general
[1:19:34] conception and a thought in the people
[1:19:35] all around me
[1:19:38] i don't want to do something just
[1:19:39] because all the people at the church
[1:19:42] i just want to walk with god i want
[1:19:46] to walk with him i want to understand
[1:19:51] that pyramid i want to walk with the
[1:19:54] word i want to be the word i want
[1:19:56] i want to be ingrained and embodied
[1:19:59] everything i do
[1:20:00] amen is working with that word amen with
[1:20:02] the revelation of the word by the
[1:20:03] leadership of god
[1:20:05] amen i want it to be something that will
[1:20:07] will make it through the judgments
[1:20:09] not my own works and not my own ideas
[1:20:11] for my own motives and my own selfish
[1:20:14] reason
[1:20:15] but i just want to walk with god
[1:20:18] because in genesis there was two
[1:20:20] buildings
[1:20:22] but they had two different purposes
[1:20:25] one was god's building that god built
[1:20:28] for a memorial
[1:20:30] and for a testimony and it was the
[1:20:32] second bible that was written on earth
[1:20:34] it didn't do anything to reframe her
[1:20:36] glory to enoch and it wasn't for enoch's
[1:20:38] purpose and it wasn't to satisfy
[1:20:40] any craving in enoch it was for god
[1:20:44] that building was for god and it was
[1:20:46] built on the word it was built by the
[1:20:48] word
[1:20:49] it was the word word by word
[1:20:52] and that building survived the judgment
[1:20:55] of god because god does not judge his
[1:20:58] word
[1:21:00] but in genesis there was another
[1:21:01] building that was built but it was for a
[1:21:03] different purpose
[1:21:05] it was for the glory of mankind it was
[1:21:07] for the selfishness of man
[1:21:09] it was to satisfy a craving for religion
[1:21:11] and a craving to worship
[1:21:12] it became a deception that the devil
[1:21:14] used so that he would rob
[1:21:16] amen the worship that was intended for
[1:21:17] god because he was working with the
[1:21:19] lusts of man
[1:21:21] so it was one building that was built
[1:21:22] for the desire of god
[1:21:24] in one building that was built for the
[1:21:25] lust of man
[1:21:29] i say god help me to put all my efforts
[1:21:32] in your building
[1:21:35] not my building god help us
[1:21:40] to surrender ourselves humble ourselves
[1:21:44] and get rid of all selfish desire and
[1:21:46] all religion
[1:21:47] help us to walk with you and wait for
[1:21:49] you to tell us what to do
[1:21:51] let's all stand
[1:21:56] we find the tower of babel
[1:22:00] god comes down in genesis and he
[1:22:03] confounds their languages and separates
[1:22:05] them out
[1:22:06] and they go and it ends off the
[1:22:07] construction and brother branham says it
[1:22:09] turns to dust it falls into rubble it
[1:22:11] falls in the ruin
[1:22:13] but that was just the physical building
[1:22:16] because babel continued on it became
[1:22:20] babylon and then it moved all the way
[1:22:22] through and it became mystery babylon in
[1:22:25] the book of revelation so what we find
[1:22:27] in genesis we find in revelation chapter
[1:22:30] 17 and 18
[1:22:32] the and the harlots showing that
[1:22:34] nothing changed
[1:22:36] man kept right on doing what man wanted
[1:22:38] to do
[1:22:40] and i'll tell you let's take it home a
[1:22:42] little tighter
[1:22:45] there's a war inside each one of us
[1:22:48] there's a war inside of each other was
[1:22:50] to build two buildings
[1:22:54] there's a part of us if we're the
[1:22:55] children of god with the seed of god
[1:22:57] there's something in us that wants to
[1:22:58] walk with lord and we want to build
[1:23:00] amen this building for god we want to
[1:23:02] build this memorial for the word of god
[1:23:04] amen but there's another part of us
[1:23:06] that's craving baked bricks
[1:23:10] to satisfy the flesh and that's why we
[1:23:13] crucify the flesh
[1:23:14] and the lust thereof and we stick to the
[1:23:18] lord
[1:23:19] we're not looking friends we're not
[1:23:21] looking for deception to come from the
[1:23:23] catholic church
[1:23:27] we're looking for the deception that'll
[1:23:29] come from that spirit that will sit on
[1:23:30] your shoulder to tempt you to bake a
[1:23:32] brick
[1:23:35] that'll tempt you to take your own
[1:23:37] understanding
[1:23:38] and and put it next to the word of god
[1:23:43] that's the temptation friends that's
[1:23:45] what we've got to be aware of that's
[1:23:47] what we're going to die out too
[1:23:48] brother brenham didn't say your enemy's
[1:23:49] the catholic church he said your enemy
[1:23:51] is the one you look at in the mirror
[1:23:52] when you wake up in the morning
[1:23:57] there's two buildings for two purposes
[1:23:59] amen we've got to be careful amen we've
[1:24:01] got to watch we've got to judge
[1:24:02] ourselves we've got to guard against the
[1:24:03] enemy
[1:24:04] amen we've got to stay on guard and walk
[1:24:06] with the lord
[1:24:10] and let all selfish lust go away
[1:24:13] it's my greatest desire that i could die
[1:24:16] more my greatest desire
[1:24:19] is to not go the way of nimrod and babel
[1:24:22] but to stay like enoch stayed and walk
[1:24:26] with god
[1:24:27] walk by revelation have faith that
[1:24:30] pleases my god
[1:24:32] faith in his word faith in the whole
[1:24:34] word
[1:24:35] i want to please him because i have
[1:24:36] faith in the word that slays me
[1:24:42] i have faith in the word that bruises me
[1:24:45] and i love it let's bow our heads and
[1:24:48] pray
[1:24:51] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:24:55] god as we look and the book of genesis
[1:24:57] as your prophet told us to look
[1:25:00] that it's the seed it's the beginning
[1:25:02] lord
[1:25:03] god we can look and see that seed and
[1:25:05] see that beginning
[1:25:06] and lord we see today all those things
[1:25:10] have matured all those things have come
[1:25:12] to full harvest maturity

[1:25:49] us your own
[1:25:50] faith that we might understand the
[1:25:52] righteousness of god because we believe
[1:25:54] your word

[1:25:58] flesh and stay true

[1:27:47] christ's name we pray
[1:27:49] amen one last thing i'd like to say
[1:27:53] about
[1:27:54] the pyramid that enoch built
[1:27:59] is when enoch was done with it it was
[1:28:01] the way god wanted it
[1:28:03] and enoch didn't have to add any extra
[1:28:07] adornment to make it flashy
[1:28:11] he didn't have to put a little gold trim
[1:28:13] here a little extra this or that
[1:28:16] and god's built a bride in this day word
[1:28:18] upon word
[1:28:19] and when enoch was done with that
[1:28:20] pyramid it was the word and the word
[1:28:23] only
[1:28:25] and this bride is going to have the word
[1:28:28] and the word only
[1:28:30] no extra intellectual adornment no
[1:28:33] little extra flair from personal one or
[1:28:35] personal desire
