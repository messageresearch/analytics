back with him will remember me as the ring bearer in his marriage to Janet in 1980 right no okay I had to write a few uh words about my Uncle Timmy and uh I know a person's life is like a diamond there's many fast ETS and you can you can look through the different facets and they reflect light differently and so um I'm hoping the things I share uh will connect with the way you knew my Uncle Timmy because to me he was just always Uncle Timmy U my memories begin in the 70s and this is the first time in 50 years where uh my Uncle Tim will not be a tangible part of of my life uh in the circle of those I love and care about uh but although he's become a memory what a great memory he is and to remember means to memorialize and so in a way when we remember someone we bring them to life in our own minds in our own in our own hearts even though we know as my dad said on the phone the other day he goes he's fine he's he's the only one of us right now is fine and I think that's a good thing to remember Uncle Tim is ju doing just fine it's for ourselves that we grieve today my Uncle Timmy uh inventive and creative he had a work shop in his home in ramble Ridge uh uh was filled with uh dremels and tools and parts and pieces mostly airplanes and gliders things that were together and would be together and things that were broken and need to be put together again he exuded fun and energy for Life anytime I I I picked up the phone I'd see his name on my phone and say Tim erant two or three times a year I'd call me hey nephew I mean he just always hey there's always this energetic sing songy note in his greeting I got a birthday text a month early this past year for my 50th it was actually on my I think it must have been Daniel's birthday it was November 16th and uh said hey nef just didn't want to forget your birthday this year and uh don't real thank you it's a month early but 50 is a big one so thank you Uncle Tim it's awesome which brings me to the next one he cared about and took time for people and um uh just in his demeanor I I guarantee if he were walking these this place today and we couldn't see him he'd be wanting to comfort every single one of us he made parachutes and from wax paper and string he did it at the at the table for me at 9705 Redman Avenue at the kitchen table I remember just being in awe of how is this going to work out it might have been a garbage bag garbage bags and string he loved to sail he loved to fly in airplanes he loved to ride motorcycles he did all three with with his brother his big sister his dad with me and that's quite a blessing in fact I think there was a morning on a Saturday where I got to 100 miles hour on the Nighthawk with him I think it's okay to tell that now I think um in the obit Bo what a great picture I opened my my uh I opened Facebook I think it was Daniel posted it and I never know should you like an obit u i just but but I thought that picture what a that captures the face you could have put any the only thing missing was a Bluetooth earpiece but other than that fantastic but he told stories and there was always a a a boom there was always a vocal emphasis at the major plot point this was boom you know he would shout the point he wanted to emphasize and uh wow uh my brother uh is in Saudi Arabia he couldn't be here here he'll be here on the 25th but he says remember to tell the story of Grandpa saving his life by building him a toy crossbow out a surgical tubing and then quickly dismantling it when he found that uh it put an arrow through the garage door this is too dangerous to give to his 10-year-old he taught me chords to more than one pop song so like could played on the piano I know this is the church crowd but Steve Winwood's Valerie I can hear him playing that I can hear Peter and the Wolf I can hear him coming over that's not Benny and the Jets this is Benny and the Jets one night he rented he and Janet took me to Benson to their new house and they're newly married rented a VCR in the in the evening so I could see Empire Strikes Back because I'd seen the first one I'd seen Return of the Jedi but I'd not seen Empire Strikes Back come to my place we'll rent this suitcase sized VCR take it home I'll show you uh Empire Strikes Back it was fantastic took me to the driving range to hit buckets of balls he came way out to boy town almost where I lived and took me down to a hit balls at the driving range on 120th one of my favorite memories he made a surprise visit to our driveway one night I looked out the window and I couldn't tell what kind of what is this in my driveway it was unexpected there was no cell phones in 1986 and out under the uh garage light was a white Acura Integra and me and Dad went out and he took us on a rip roaring thrilling ride through the darkened roads of West Omaha uh which I'm still a little bit unnerved by put that car through its paces and what just a what a fun EXC uh what a fun moment he was blessed with the sense of adventure he was blessed with Janet and I got to say you my grandpa if he was here he'd say you know what Tim told me when he got engaged I saidwell Tim she's taller than you and he said Dad she's worth the climb' Grandpa he told that story just about every time he interacted with him I'm sure you all have heard it right oh that's a surprise to you Lori told me to be careful he was blessed with Daniel what a sharp mind and sharp wit Nathan who's I and I know you guys all have this musical ability but I remember at the wedding a a little over a year ago now when you were playing piano and good grief Matthew man he's so proud of you and I think he'd be proud that you're twice as height now somebody's got to be the fork in the errant tree and get us get us up there you know he endured a major loss early on in life with his mother passing in 1977 my grandmother Janet sent me this amazing poem this week and I was like I read it to Lori in my kitchen and I'm crying and Lor's crying my girls are crying I was like I can't read this up there but it's fantastic if if you get a chance ask Janet to share it if if she's willing um he endured more than one his sharei of struggle late in life too but he kept on keep keeping on and isn't that all of us any of us can do it's a great uh psychologist to see him all over YouTube Jordan Peterson who says life is terminal and that's real life all comes down to this but then life opens up into something more and something greater and that's the part we got to keep in mind right yeah it comes down to this here on this side but we have this great hope of the Glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ and he persevered through it all he kept that in mind he inspired and he impacted us all along the way Lori and I got to visit him a couple months ago uh out in um ad delphus I think it was and before I left I got to I was with with with these guys for just a few hours I went but before I left I hugged him I just whispered and him as is here I thanked him for many of the things on this list cuz at some level you just know this day came much too soon I feel a little ripped off and I'm sure you don't feel much different from me much too soon much too fast for my liking liking as a great uh great preacher on the radio Jay Vernon McGee once said you might not like how God runs the universe and you might even have a better plan but you don't have a universe so I trust this wonderful man to the hands of his wonderful Creator the one who gifted him to us in the first place I look forward to the hope of the Glorious appearing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I think of these words from the old hymn God Moves In A mysterious way he says you fearful Saints fresh courage take the clouds you so much dread are big with mercy and shall break in blessings on your head I'm thankful for the time I had with my Uncle Tim and for being able to share this reflection with you today God [Music] bless very soon we'll all go home and walk the streets of gold and each one of us a portion Heaven share but for all the jewels and gold and the riches yet Untold these things are not the reason I'll be there I want to see Jesus at at the end of the race I want to see Jesus and look on his face life trials will see nothing every pain that we bear I want to see Jesus and that's why I'll be there all the prophets we shall we and we'll sit down at their feet and for years we'll sit and listen to them share all the things that they will tell and my soul it shall compel but the prophets aren't the reason I'll be there I want to see Jesus at the end of the race I want to see Jesus and look on his face like trials will see nothing every pain that we bear I want to see Jesus and that's why I'll be there all sorrow Temptation disappointment frustration these things he will erase when on that day I look upon his face so I leave you with this song keep your chin up and move on and press ahead until the race is done for there's one thing for sure you will win if you wi but the race is not the reason why we run I want to see Jesus at the end of the [Music] race I want to see Jesus and look on his face life trials will seem nothing every pain that we bear I want to see Jesus that's why I'll be there I want to see Jesus that's why I'll be there [Music] it's hard to tell how far I wand upon this Fallen Earth [Music] Below I longed to reach the heavens I felt calling to me but just why I did not know I searched in vain to find the answers it seemed the truth could not be found there were so many saying why can't you just be happy but I wasn't happy on the ground still I believe there was an answer and knew the truth was something rare then one day truth came and found me and wrapped its wings around me and I was carried in the airrow free freom oh Freedom how the truth has Set Me Free now I'm flying higher and oh how far I see and know how far I see I see [Music] Till There were those who always question if what I found was really true I gave them many scriptures but Lord they just can't see it it must be hidden from their View I tried my best to give an answer just how it is I made this choice I did my best to tell them how my heart burns within me every time I hear that voice so freom oh Freedom how the word has made me so now I'm flying higher than I ever flown before then I've ever flown before before there comes a time when you must go your separate ways you have to walk this walk alone but late at night when you're down on your knees to pray just hold him up in prayer and and move on oh freom oh [Music] Freedom never more to R now I'm flying ever higher [Music] and I am going home and I am going home going [Applause] [Music] home oh freedom [Music] oh what a life amen what a brother I um known brother Tim well over 20 years somewhere in the vicinity of 22 23 years and and uh we all knew brother at him and we knew him to be everybody's friend he was everyone's friend wonderful brother wonderful friend and I think Jason did such a marvelous job encapsulating his life and memories that we all knew and the way that we all knew and loved brother Tim and I'd like to just take a few minutes while we're gathered here this morning and I'd like to talk on the subject of life and death and just share a few things from the scripture and uh I was I'd like to read from John 10:10 to begin with I'm just going to read the second half of the verse Jesus is speaking and he says I come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly man Jesus came that they might have life and have it more abundantly me we all knew uh brother Tim in this life in one capacity or another and our relationship was all in one way or another but what we all enjoyed was the same life it was the life that was encapsulated in that vessel that we knew the brother that we shook hands with and the family member that we embraced but within that vessel was a life and that life was our brother Tim and uh he was full of life he was a lot of fun and he was always a lot of fun to be with he was adventurous he was funny and he loved to make you laugh it it was remarked before but I like to remark again brother Tim could take the most mundane and routine of daily stories and make it the funniest thing you've ever heard in your life and if somebody else told that story it would be a total dud and a flop you tell it and then you would laugh and everybody look at you but he can take normal what we would call normal and make it hilarious because he found the humor in things he found the joy he found those things and was able to highlight the things that that made it funny amen so we all got to share in that and and one way or another and we saw too a man who was very Bound in many ways because of crippling arthritis that through the decades that he fought with that it bound him more and more but though arthritis would bind him physically it can never stop that Spirit within him from expressing life it couldn't stop the life from being manifest it was only a limitation and then we saw uh five months ago as he had the stroke how how limiting the stroke was he lost the ability to communicate with his family and there would be little glimpses that he would say little phrases but for the most part he lost his ability to communicate to share what was going on inside and so for many in many ways for the last five months he hasn't been able to express that life that we love so much and it was so hard to watch and so hard to see but I'm so thankful there's no limitation to him now there's no barrier to his expression all the life that was in brother Tim is still alive and I guarantee he's expressing Life as we speak the barriers and the bars have been removed and so we're thankful for that brother Tim's Faith was expressed in his songs as you've heard already today a couple of those before the service and during the slideshow amen we don't have to speak of his faith or convince you of his faith many of you knew it but his song portray it they encapsulate it and they live on his faith what he believed in whom he loved and where he placed his confidence continues on and we're thankful for that and at the request of his family we were able to make about a 100 copies of his CD they titled freedom and it's out in the forer and you're welcome to take one with you as you go so that you can listen to brother Tim's faith and the expression of the life that was within him as we go back to the scripture that I read that last half half of John 10:10 says I come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly and it's interesting to note that Jesus when he came he was speaking to people who were already alive but he came that they might have life so it's it's interesting because they were alive they were breathing they were eating they were walking on the earth they had a form of life but he came that he might give them life and that life more abundantly so the life that Jesus is talking about maybe is a little more than the life that we come to understand as human beings we have a certain Paradigm we have certain way of viewing things like life and death and that Paradigm is is it's a narrow Vision because it's only it's been gained through this life through the birth that we had through a mother and a father the years that we spent upon this Earth our education and the things we've experienced we come to understand life and death in one way in human terms but as we find in the scripture Jesus and the disciples they had a totally different concept of life and death and that's what I'd like to speak on a little bit in Genesis 2:7 says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul this is where we get our understanding of life upon this Earth and life in this Dimension and life in these bodies that at the breath of life and me this man became a living soul and he became animated in what we call this Dimension or on this Earth Earth or in this world and he was given instructions and we know that he failed to keep those instructions and and that came forth in in verse 17 of the same chapter but the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so it was the first mention of death in this life that we understand that came forth when he breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of man and so there was already a promise that if you corrupt this way it'll bring death he goes on after man fell and he and he disobeyed the Commandments of God and and Jesus comes on the SE or God comes on the scene he begins to dish out the punishment the retribution and verse 19 of chapter 3 says in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and at the dust shalt thou return so we know he formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and here he's saying conclusively that you were taken out of the dust and the dust you'll return but I'm here to say that the Bible gives us a more full picture of this life and this death because what's referred to here is what we know as mortal life what we know is human life what we know is this existence but we know that there's more life than this and life is much grander than this in James chapter 4 James says whereas you know not what shall be on on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away and so we know that really at most we just have a handful of years upon this Earth in this form in this dimension in this life and it goes by too fast remember when I was young I used to think time dragged along but now standing here probably halfway or more than halfway through my life I realized time flies life is short it's brief as we say goodbye to friends that we've shared life with for years we realize how quickly it all goes away and it's like a vapor this word vapor is like the fog that lifts off the Earth and in the morning you can see the vapor the fog and but when the sun comes out very quickly it's dissipated it's gone and you can't tell where it went you can't see and that's the way life is in human speaking in human terms it's here we can see it but at some point it just vanishes away and where it is can we tangibly grab it and say and hold on to it and know where it went it just seems to have disappeared that's our perspective but I'd like to begin sharing another perspective not the Mortal but the immortal not the one from this world but the one that goes beyond this world the prophet of God for age begins to tell us something about death he gives us a definition which is grander than the one that we have in this life said the word death means separation and I'd like to just share with you death as separation because we all feel it today what we feel in the death of our brother Tim is separation we're separated from our brother we can't speak to him like we used to speak to him we can't shake his hand hug his neck there's a separation and that's part of death that's an attribute of death is separation and that's why we're g leing because we're mourning that loss the loss of that life and the access we had to that life was through the physical body it's the only way we could access the life that was inside was through our brother's Tabernacle and now that's been separated from us and the life has gone elsewhere and the Tabernacle soon will go into the ground fulfilling the words of the Lord in Genesis and and so death for us is a separation but death for Tim was was different it wasn't a separation it was more of a unification he went to unify with Saints who had gone on before he was birthed into a whole new world and he experienced life and a whole new level so for us death is one thing for him death was something else the prophet goes on to say the physical death does not mean that we are dead but the physical death that we have to go through here yet it is not death we're still in the presence of God we move from this this place to a closer place with him in his presence and Jesus refers to this in the gospels in Matthew 9 when he's going to to raise gyrus his daughter he's called upon because she's grievously sick word comes that she's died he enters into the house and Jesus says this give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn here's Jesus the the fullness of the godhead bodily all the wisdom and the understanding of God uh formed into a human being and he makes a declaration that she's not dead they all knew she was dead according to their definition of death yeah but Jesus knew something more than what they knew they knew she not she's not dying she can't die for she's a child of God he says she sleepeth and they laughed him the scorn and they felt justified in their laughter amen because it was the narrow vision of humanity that gave them the privilege of laughing at the Lord but his perspective was much greater than theirs yeah I'd like this morning to take his perspective on life yeah in John 1111 when he gets word in John chap 11 that his friend Lazar is sick grievously sick unto death he doesn't move he hesitates and doesn't go then after a few days he tells his disciples our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that may I wake him out of his sleep and his disciples totally misunderstood their language because they're still in the narrow vision of humanity and they say oh if he sleepeth he do well they thought he was resting and recovering from his sickness so Jesus had to rephrase his sentence in terminology they would understand he said Lazarus is dead but he had already said he's sleeping yeah because he knew Lazarus wasn't dead he was on his way to raise him from the dead amen so in Romans uh the Apostle Paul says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death carnally minded does not mean Wicked it doesn't mean evil carnally minded means natural to be naturally minded to have the natural mind that we're born with and grow up with that natural mind that perceives the world a certain way that's learned that life is a certain thing to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so we're seeing life is different than what we thought and death is different than what we thought now just to have the natural mind is death to have the spiritual mind is life and peace in 1 Timothy Paul says but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth so we can be living what we call living as a human being we can have animation in this Dimension we can be in a body and have a spirit and eat and drink and sleep and do all all the things we do in life but the Bible would consider us dead dead yet while we live seems very odd but it's the reality in Ephesians Paul says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins those who have been made alive and been born again by the spirit of God they were dead we were dead in trespasses and sins we were alive in the natural sense but dead in the spiritual sense so in one way we were alive but in the greater more profound way we were dead because death means separation we were separated from the things of God we were removed from understanding knowing and and communing with God we had a type of death in this what we call life but he's quickened us that means to make alive who were dead in trespasses and sins the reason brother Tim can't die is because he's already been made alive years ago when he came to the understand of Christ and he surrendered and he accepted what the Lord had done for him and the word that the Lord presented to him amen when he embraced that fully and by faith he was born again he had life life that could never fade away life that could never be terminated life that would continue on for eternity Paul goes on a few verses later to say but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us when we were dead in sins and ha hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we were he's speaking to people and of people that were very much alive in the dimension we call life but yet they were dead but yet being dead they were made alive Amen in Matthew 8 Jesus says another one of his disciples said unto him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father father but Jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead how do dead people bury dead people you see it's a different understanding of life and death the spiritual understanding is far beyond the natural understanding let the bad dead bury the dead in our natural understanding there's no way a dead man can take a spade in a shovel and dig a hole but Jesus was looking at things from a different Vantage Point altogether he said let the Dead bear their dead come and follow me even the parable he tells of the prodical son the son who wanted to go explore the world and separate from his father's home and and go and live extravagantly he gathered his inheritance and he went to a far country and he spent it lavishly until it was all spent and he had nothing left and in his despair he remembered his father and he came to himself and wanted to go back to his father's house only this time humbled he wanted to return as a servant and as he come back to his father's house house remember death is separation here's a young man who was separated from his father and he comes back and the and and he's wanting to ask his father just to take him back as a servant he wants to repent and he does so but the father doesn't take him back as a servant he takes him back as a son cuz he was always his son there was never a time that he wasn't his son but his son was separated and listen to what the father says the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be marry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be mared so even the expression the father of the prodal expresses this is my son was dead how was he dead he was alive somewhere else he was living righteously he was spending the wealth that he had he he found himself even for Life eating would have eaten the slop of the pigs so he was alive but to the father he was dead because of the separation but now as he came back to the father he was no longer dead but he's alive again yeah amen he was always his son but now his son separated was dead but now his son returning to the father is alive oh this is Brother Tim's story this is my story this is your story if youve believed the word word of God and accepted the pardon of Jesus Christ and you you've accepted his word in fullness amen you were dead in sin and trespasses you were separated alienated from the things of God having a mind darkened uh in the ways of God Amen but but one day we came to ourselves and we recognize that we have a father a heavenly father and we can go back and in humility we recognize we were wrong and ask him if we could be a servant but he would never take a son back as a servant because he would only take a son back as a son and he took our brother Tim back as a son and robed him and clothed him gave him the ring and this my son that was dead is alive Jesus said in John 5 verily verily I say unto you he that beareth heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but is past from Death unto life he that hear Heth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shows that there was already life inside just like the son was always the son but he had to come back to life ending the separation unifying again with the father from Death unto life in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men so in this word and we we know in John uh 1:14 a few verses later it said and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we know that that word was encapsulated in the body and we know it is Jesus Christ so in the word there's life and that life is the light of men and Jesus Christ is the word made flesh this is what our brother Tim Found Jesus said in John 8 I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life praise God John 11 says Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die yeah believest thou this what a question he asked her amen he says uh whosoever believeth in me he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live he's coming back to the resurrection of Lazarus but he's speaking more of just Lazarus he's speaking of you and I though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die Jesus was speaking to a woman I believe named Martha either Martha or Mary at this time Martha would believe in the Lord Jesus she would see the miracle she would accept him she would see him die she would witness to be a witness to his resurrection and she would believe very much but in that belief in the human sense of the word she would die but he made a promise who who liveth and believeth in me shall never die so that means these words didn't have to do with our Earthly existence in this Tabernacle of Flesh he was speaking of a much greater life than this life yeah because the ones he told that to first they would pass off the scene they would cease to breathe their existence in this Dimension it would terminate at some point but their life could never End Amen that was the promise the prophet says death means separation he only separates from our seeing but he's always alive this refers to our brother Tim he only separates from our seeing we we sense death is separation he's separated from our seeing but his life is not terminated right says he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life we can't die we got eternal life eternal anything anything Eternal never had a beginning or an end so that's God's own life brother Tim had God's own life and that life in him led him back to his father's house one point he came to himself and he came back back under the preaching of the word under the message of the hour and he returned back to the father's house and unified with his father and he moved from Death unto life and now he that believeth liveth and believeth in him shall never die I'm here to say brother Tim Aaron is not dead but he's alive amen and that life that he has is the same life we can have if we could but hear his voice and respond if we could but hear his words and Believe on him that sin and if we could have the same faith brother Tim have we could have the same life that brother Tim now has for those who have accepted it were so grateful for life and when you read through the scriptures and you read the histories of Godly men you'll find that the disciples and the followers of Christ and and even The Godly Saints down Through the Ages they never feared death they come to death's door and they didn't back down they didn't go crying they didn't go afraid but they realized within themselves this what we call death death is only entrance into more life yeah it's only freedom from a barrier it's it's going Beyond a closed door into an open door it's busting out of what's Limited us amen those of us who've accepted Christ you know in your life there's limitations that come through living in this human flesh amen it's been born wrong it's been perverted by corruption and and now amen the freedom comes from baking breaking Beyond these barriers and moving beyond and every saint that came to that door was happy to make the step across for them death wasn't fearful for them death wasn't agonizing for them death wasn't a terror for them death was release yes it's separation yes brother Tim had a separation too he separated from a body that was tormented and Afflicted he separated from a body suffering the ravages of a stroke where he couldn't communicate with his family I think that was a wonderful separation yeah oh that glorious day for brother Timothy Aaron that last Sunday about just before 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon as we would count time our brother made the most Glorious Step he's made thus far when he had death separation from this life into what he had always longed for yeah what a wonderful death what a glorious death what a magnificent death how thankful he was for his separation amen oh I hope we're longing for our separation yeah to separate from this body of death that's what Paul said who can separate me from this body of death there's coming a separation and I'm looking forward to it our separation whether it comes by the change in the body and being caught in the air or we must go by the grave like our brother our separation will only be a separation from what's terminal what's temporary what's hazardous it'll be a glorious separation for us who believe we will separate from this by death but it will also be for us a a unification not a separation yeah we will come to join the Saints of old and we will live gloriously with them we'll be unified once again with brother Tim yes amen for us we can also have a glorious separation if we would separate now from our old ways and our old life and our old thinking our mind that has been darkened and polluted by corruption if we'll separate by means of death not of ceasing to breathe or walk but if we'll die to ourselves die to our selfishness our pride die to our own ideas and our own ideology our own misconceptions of God if we'll die to oursel and accept God's provided way his voice in this day we can move also from death into life and believe his word and never die yeah amen what an opportunity we have in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 1 it says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens guess who's already moved into that house yeah our precious brother and I'm so grateful he separated to find more life so thankful he's moved into that body that God had prepared for him that's Eternal in the heavens further down in verse 8 it says we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord prophet of God also told us this was such a consolation he said you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here too just in another dimension faster than this right through this room he starts to describe TV and we know now by Wi-Fi and internet it's all travel another world is moving within this world it's just traveling at a speed we can't comprehend unless we have a way to dial into it but Heaven's right here too the Saints are here the Glorious Realms of Eternity it's all around us friends it's just moving at a different speed but God has given us a portal he's given us a way that we can have a a tuning device a router you should say we could say or or a cell phone or some way we can pick up the signal amen and the mechanism he uses his word and his word's been restored in the end time and and that word can bring his spirit and that Spirit becomes the thing that Tunes the radio frequency in and we can pick up the message there's life here there's life all around us there's more life here than death amen for eternal life is present the Heavenly realm is here we're just separated from it in a way because of these bodies but one day we'll separate from these bodies we may call it death and death might mean many things to many people but with a Heavenly perspective death is a glorious thing when we died to ourselves took up our cross and followed him we found life when we died in this natural man and he ceased to breathe and we relay the rest we went on to a Heavenly prize a body prepared for us in the heavens from that perspective death is wonderful death is a blessing death is our privilege we who remain we feel death still as a sting a sting of separation of loss where we can no longer hold our brother touch him speak to him but I'm so thankful that we had a prophet in this day who was privileged to go beyond the curtain of time and see the saints that have passed on when he went on he found them in bodies very much looking human ones that he could touch and hug and embrace and speak to he it was such a consolation to him to find out that we went we weren't a vapor or a mist or some floating Spirit but that we were in a form like we were on Earth and only perfect and beautiful at the peak of humanity amen and age somewhere between 19 and 21 years old at the peak of strength and glorious and young and fresh and in Perfection and having sweet communion and fellowship where there was life only life where there was love only love where there was light only light oh I'm so glad we've gotten this picture for when Paul went there was things he couldn't say but this brother went and he could come back and tell us what he saw and give us such a glorious consolation in hours like this but also such an anticipation in us for our time of Separation God is so good so thank thankful to know where brother Tim is we feel this thing of Separation we will in the days and weeks and months that come it'll hit us like waves as we remember hear a song see a picture but remember that's only temporal that's only Earthly that's only in this dimension in these parameters of time that is going to be broken open one day amen the pain that we feel may it just cause us to strive that much more to see again to fight for the cause to keep pressing on for our great reunion I'd like to conclude with this verse of scripture from Brother Paul as he writes to Timothy this is at his point of death he knows that he's leaving this world says for I am ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness with the Lord the righteous judge who the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing man what a reward that is coming to us all men I'd like to conclude in a word of prayer after I'm conclude the prayer brother Ashton crook is going to sing a song a song that brother Tim had written but I'd like for us all just bow our heads for just a moment and I'd like to say just before we pray that this life that we know is life it's a vapor it's a Mist we're thankful for the joys that we have in this life the family the friendships the laughter the experiences the adventures and brother Tim enjoyed them all more than anyone but they will all fade away one day and true life will break forth true life the life that feeds all of the joy and all of the pleasure all of the goodness that we experience but is so much greater than the limitation of this human life let us not just live to have some fun in the Box in parameters of birth and death natural life but let us strive to have real life true life eternal life as our heads are bowed let's just join in prayer together and commit ourselves to the Lord dear heavenly father I thank you Lord Jesus that you came and you taught us what life really is you taught us what death really is so that we can Lord be lifted above and beyond the parameters of our limitations of humanity that we could see things more as you see them so that we wouldn't fear This Thing Called Death we learn to embrace it that we would not waste this thing called life but that we' use it for your glory that in this natural life we would surrender it and die to take up our cross to crucify ourselves for your sake that we might find true life that we can have death so that we can come to life so that we'll never die thank you God for your word I pray that it strike the hearts of your children may encourage us to keep pressing on for life is worth fighting for life is worth striving for that we've received the life which is the light of men God for those who have not yet died to self surrendered this Natural Life in exchange for eternal life I pray that you'd prick their hearts now that you'd begin working in them and give them the process Lord call them let them hear their father calling may as the prodical son did may they come to themselves Lord and realize what life really is and Lord may they return back to your house humble broken understanding are failures and may they find you a loving father willing to take a son back as a son to wash and robe and cleanse and your own righteousness with your own life and give us your own Rewards God may that be our experience God if time continues to go for decades more many of us will have to pass through the same gate our brother Tim passed through May we do so with joyful expectation stepping from this life to a one that's far greater God those of us who remain Lord to the finality of your coming where Lord we see the saints that are risen and our new bodies materialize around this one may we ever pressed towards true life may we never fear what is just temporary death and we love you we ask your blessings Lord change us make us live a life worthy of your gospel we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen wanted to say something real quick I the pleasure of knowing Tim not

special it you know when you're 6'4 hugging somebody who is significantly shorter than you it fits differently it kind of feels like hugging one of your own kids but he gave the best hugs and I will
