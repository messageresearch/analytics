announcement many of you know we've had brother david cornmeiser with us from germany brother gerd roadwall's grandson has been helping out in the office and working with brother franco for the last eight weeks and he's leaving friday going back home so this wednesday evening after church we'd like to have a send-off for our brother in the fellowship hall cake and coffee will be served so please come and join us he's been a real blessing to have around and it's been wonderful to visit with him so if you'd help us give him a proper send-off we'd appreciate that this wednesday after the service i also want to remind everybody that communion is this coming sunday so it's the first day of the month and it'll be communion so we don't want anybody to miss that praise the lord let's read in daniel chapter 12. god bless you brother howard sister darlene and your family it's good to have you as lima residents amen i'm surprised you're on time to church now that you live so close praise the lord what are you five minutes away five minutes praise god that's a big difference isn't it hallelujah we're happy for you it's privileged to have you here let's look at verse seven daniel chapter 12 verse 7. and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time times and a half time and a half which is three and a half years and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord that we can come to read this passage of scripture lord and it has so much more meaning to us than ever before and lord we just believe that we're your chosen where you're elected and you're revealing yourself to us because you want us to know god i pray that you would purify us and make us white by the washing of the water of your word and lord as we look into these things lord there's no man that could open these seals lord only you the lamb could open them but lord as we look into them we pray that you just open our eyes to see lord to understand that we might gain strength for this journey and strength for the flight out of here we love you we ask your blessing to be upon us your preeminence would be in this place that you would take this vessel and minister your word to your children in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated lord bless you i want to say we had a really wonderful youth meeting this past friday night at the collider park and we thank sister joyce for putting that together and those who helped her we had a really nice time and and we went over the third pool with the youth and just it was just amazing you know you have i i always marvel that we've got young adults and teenagers that sit there and they get excited hearing about three pools a vision of an end time prophet and the third pool and the opening of the word and you've got young adults and teenagers that are getting excited and responding and saying amen and nodding their head in a park and picnic tables sitting around and you know i love this lesson it was my favorite because i got to use a fishing pole and so i got to show them the vision and the three pools and but it was amazing that the young people want to know these things they weren't interested in what game they could play or what the activity was for the afternoon they came for the word they enjoyed the word and they enjoyed the fellowship and i just say god bless them amen it's amazing so we had a wonderful time and i enjoyed myself very much but you know many shall be purified and made white and tried this word is going to purify many and make them white and try them right because brother branham said this evil age is to prove to satan that she's not like eve was that she's going to be tried by the word but she's not going to fail by the word she's predestinated not to and that's why god has opened excuse me the word to this bride let's turn to the book of revelation if we could bring up the powerpoint excuse me we're staying in the fourth seal and you'll have to excuse me for lying vanities but i don't give them any credit and i don't care beans about what's going to happen and whatever i just preach it doesn't bother me don't let it bother you let's just keep going amen so if the if something happens we'll just keep going we don't care and now that i mentioned it everybody starts coughing that's a bunch of lies amen let's just focus on the word and let that fade off the scene praise god yep there it is so we know that that we've we've had for for almost 2 000 years the seals amen that were opened they were opened in symbol form but the thunders were closed with the thunders as the revelation of what the symbols meant and so it's been a closed book for thousands of years but at the end time we read here that it's going to be open let's look at revelations 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice is when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so here john was commissioned to write he was supposed to write everything he saw but he gets to this point and the mighty angel comes down roars is when a lion roareth amen this is the mighty angel this is this is christ coming down with an open book in his hand so it's the return of christ amen in angelic form in the form of the holy ghost coming with an open book in his hand and he roars as when a lion roareth because this is the coming of the king and he's coming looking for his queen to come stand by his side but then there was seven thunders that uttered their voices and john being a scribe he was told to write everything that he saw and everything that he heard and he goes to do what he's supposed to do but he was told to seal it up which brings us right back to daniel because daniel had seen these things and heard these things but he wanted another understanding or greater understanding and he was told to seal the things up he said they're sealed up until the time of the end and here we have john standing there seeing the vision almost 2 000 years ago and he catches the revelation of the seven thunders and he goes to write them down and he's told to seal them up amen because it's got to be sealed up till the time of the end so the time that these things are unsealed is the time of the end and that's why brother branham calls revelations 10 he calls it the seventh seal and he calls it the end time seal because when the seventh seal opens he said the preaching of those seven thunders amen that that's what it was and so preaching of the seven seals was the seven thunders and that's the end time seal because it's sealed till the time of the end so the time that it's unsealed marks the end time all right that's why the seventh seal is the end time seal verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever skip down to verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so we see here that that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound brother branham said not when he went out in healing campaigns and on evangelistic but when he began to reveal the word amen that's that's when he began to sound and so the seventh angel began to sound amen and the mystery of god should be finished so we know that there's something important that that's the voice god is in this last day drawing us to the voice let's go back to chapter six of revelation revelation chapter six verse seven we're going to read the two scriptures that pertain to the fourth seal chapter six verse seven and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast i remember we talked sunday this is the first time this terminology is used in the first four seals before i heard the beast say and i've heard the voice of the sec or i've heard the second beast say i heard the third beast say for the previous third three three times that the beast spoke it said i heard the beast say but now when we get to the fourth beast is that i heard the voice of the fourth beast so god is honing us down so that we can catch that there's a voice here speaking amen it was it was the it was the great eagle the mighty eagle speaking through a prophet eagle and it was the voice of the fourth beast it was the voice of the seventh angel now let's go back to revelations chapter three and verse 20. this is the seventh church age so we've got the seventh church age the fourth seal and revelations 10 7 the seventh angel and they're all saying the same thing revelation 3 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in and sup with him and he with me so here in the seventh church age we're at laodicea he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice not if anybody hears my knock he's standing at the door because he's been put outside the church in laodicea and he's knocking to get in but how's he knocking he's knocking with his voice if any man hear my voice and open the door i'll come into him and when we get to the fourth seal the fourth seal takes place at the laodicean church age these all come together and in the four seal he heard the voice of the fourth beast amen and that voice of the fourth beast was the voice of the seventh angel amen so here we have revelation 10 7 revelation 6 7 and revelations 3 20 all pointing to the same thing hallelujah i love the word of god it just keeps getting clearer and clearer and clearer so we another thing i want to explain and this will get clearer later don't don't don't get ahead just listen to what i'm saying because i want to lay a foundation uh i'm hoping to to do some teaching today but we'll see because sometimes i go to teach and we preach and sometimes i go to preach and we teach we just trust god to do whatever he wants to do you just get what you need from the lord today and everything will be just fine but we find that the fourth seal and the fifth seal and the sixth seal and the seventh seal all overlap and intertwine so when we're coming through the first four seals it's following the church ages it's moving up and brother branham said like going up steps one laps over the other just like the church ages when you get to the fourth seal you've come to the end of the church ages and the fourth seal goes on into tribulation which is the sixth seal because when the bride goes up the devil comes down and incarnates amen the beast who's riding the fourth horse and goes into tribulation so you can see the fourth c on the sixth seal run on parallel tracks and the fifth seal has something to do with the fourth with the with the fourth seal and the sixth seal also and the seventh seal because it's the end time seal so so don't get in your head that we have to finish one before we move to the next one and finish this before we move to the next one those last several seals are all intertwined and happening at the same time so we'll go into that more as we go on in the seals but but but don't don't let that clog up your mind just take it for face value and we'll explain more later brother branham says in the souls that were in prison now the mystery was in the seven seals when these seven seals were opened they opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and then these seven seals held the entire mystery of it so this is we've been over this before but this is really important to know that we're not just talking about the church ages we're not just talking about what happened in the last 2000 years but there's a there's a revelation contained in the seven seals that's explaining redemption and explaining the redemption of the seed of god and it explains the whole bible because the whole bible is talking about man falling and man being restored so the book of redemption covers that so for us it's now an open book it's been unsealed and it's been opened and the fourth seal says so happy to be back in the house of the lord tonight in the service again i'm so happy just thought this one wouldn't come he's talking about the fourth seal thought this one wouldn't come but it finally did and so i'm so thankful that being the last of those four horse riders which i think is one of the main messages to the church at this time and i'd say that's true one of the main messages to the church of this time because this is where we are friends in the fourth seal excuse me he says but if you'd set down with one of them seals why you could take a month's sermon every night right on the seal and still not touch it on one of them and that's how much there is to it but i just hit the high spots of it then you can see what it's all about up until several months ago i had no clue what this meant because i was looking at the seals as purely historical covering the church ages and just explaining how the church fell amen at nicaea and with that understanding you read through the seals and yep i got it it's historical and it shows how the church fell amen and we got it but but that's not what brother benham said about the seals he said they're much more to it than that it's not just for what happened it's also for what will happen when he comes to the fifth seal he said lord let us see these things so we know what we should do in the days that are ahead amen so it's important to know that that this is the entire mystery of the whole bible lays in these seals i think we're on our third sermon on the fourth seal and we'll see what god will do how open it but we know this is the pale horse all the previous three are wound up into this one and the previous three are a religious power a political power and demon power all united into one and this is the pale horse that rides in the fourth seal it's spiritual death it's also physical death it's the incarnate devil amen but god sent out to combat that the anointing of the eagle which is god himself which is prophets and children of god amen are you an eagle then hey you're in the fourth seal remember the eagle is totally different than the first three beasts i mean the first three beasts are earth-bound beasts the the fourth is not earthbound he can fly the first four start on milk or the first three start on milk the fourth doesn't start on milk he starts on meat amen it's totally different anointing than what we had before amen it is god himself amen and first it was god himself the great eagle showing himself and a prophet eagle brother branham so now we have a son of man revealing the son of man we know that and that's the first display amen that's coming forth to bring forth the word because there's a restoration back to the original word we believe that but the word can never come without prophets it never has it never will it takes profit so an eagle had to come and the great eagle had to speak through this eagle that he could restore the word and when he restored the word he was restoring the church back to its right position and when he did he's calling for all the little eaglets to come up and manifest himself and he's calling not for just a prophet eagle in this day he's calling for all the eagles to come to manifestation hallelujah and when they all come to manifestation and they all come into maturity then they all fly away home hallelujah so but now when it comes forth the eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets the eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle so goes so high there ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there he sees where he's at some people get up there and can't see where they're at so don't do no good to get up there see this eagle flies with prophetic vision amen and and that's unlocked to the children of god by revelation not by intellectual understanding but by revelation now wednesday wednesday we were talking about satan cast down and i'm not gonna have time to go into that so if you weren't here wednesday i encourage you to go watch it watch that service there's some things i said there that i want to pull out and labor on today but but satan's cast down and satan's cast down when the bride goes up so these eagles coming to their position to full maturity being able to fly into the heavenlies when they go satan is cast down and when he's cast down he fully incarnates one man on earth and that's the pope he's called the beast amen all right but before that we see that the the antichrist spirit is coming to fullness already and the devil is incarnating a church a group of people to bring about the world council of churches and unite them back to build the system that'll shut down the bride and while that's going on god himself is incarnating his church so you have the devil entering a church and you have god entering a church and you have the same thing you've always had you've always had this warfare that started in heaven when lucifer rebelled against michael and it's always been satan in christ every time it's always been christ an antichrist it's always been life and death and that's why when we get to the fourth anointing to the fourth beast now there's a prophet on the scene and when there's a prophet there now this horse rider who's been riding the white horse and the red horse and the black horse now there's an eagle here that can say that's death that's who that is now you know who's been riding all along couldn't happen until the eagle was flying couldn't happen until the prophet was on the scene so now in this the seal today we want to talk about uh the the word coming back the return of the word because we find out that the word returns to the church in the fourth seal hallelujah now i'm going to stop and slow down because i like to stop and slow down sometimes i get ahead of myself and i forget some things we have to remember that jesus christ is the word don't ever forget that amen when the logos came out of god that was the sun when the logos came out of god when the thought of god began to materialize and the word of god came forth as the logos that's the son of god and god and jesus christ is the word and the word was made flesh and received the name of jesus christ the anointed one and that is the word jesus christ is the word don't ever forget that so when we talk about return of the word we're talking about the return of jesus christ it's the return of the person of the word amen it doesn't do any good to get all the greek understanding of all these words amen we're not looking for an understanding of words we're looking for the return of a person amen hallelujah this is going to be good just just be patient don't don't i've got several quotes i want to read don't get distracted don't lose me stay right with me because this is going to be really really good genesis 3 14 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon my belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and we know starting here is a prophecy of jesus christ coming on the scene this is the prophecy of the woman of the seed the the seed of the woman i'm sorry the seed of the woman that will bruise the head of the serpent so laying right here at the fall god gives a prophecy and what brother barum tells us is god is saying i'm going to restore you and the only way i can restore you is when i bring the the word and full manifestation through you and when i bring the word and full manifestation through you that will restore you oh bring it home write today right today when he takes the woman that has fallen in the eve she she was beguiled by the serpent she come and by deception she fell by the word of god but god is going to bring away to redeem her back and the only way to redeem her back is he has to bring the word through her into full manifestation and when he brings the word through her to full manifestation that's her redemption do you know what day you live in you live in the day where the word is coming through the bride and the word coming through the bride is her redemption it's the same prophecy that was laid down here that brought jesus christ in physical form is the same exact prophecy that brings him back in full word form and that is your redemption oh hallelujah you're working on an ancient prophecy one of the first prophecies of redemption the first prophecy of redemption that was laid down in the scripture is the one that we are still relying on today hallelujah don't forget the word is eternal and it never fades away and it always works this prophecy wasn't just to eve amen it was to the seed of god prophet of god says now notice the natural woman fell and god made a way for her to be redeemed although she had fallen he made a way now that was the first bride on earth fell before her husband and her were married she fell by reason of reasoning instead of staying with the word she fell and she fell to death eternal separation with her she took her husband and everything else there was on earth she fell but now but god full of mercy made a way to redeem the woman and now he promised her telling her that sometime in the future the true word would come to her again the true word would be made known to her now remember that because he promised christ through the woman and christ is the word saint john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt with us god dwelt with us in flesh he was the word hallelujah so this prophecy of thy seed amen a woman doesn't have a seed so this is the seed of christ the word coming through the woman and that that will bruise the serpent's head he goes on to say now now we notice that god told eve that after so long a time the word is coming back to you how did she fall i want the class to say it what did she fall from what did eve fall from the word don't don't think in your mind that she fell because of adultery adultery was the attribute amen or the physical manifestation of her fall amen but she fell her fall was by by disobeying the word actually by disbelieving the word and by disbelieving the manifestation of her lack of faith was adultery but she didn't fall by adultery she fell by disbelief hallelujah that's why you can't fall by drinking and smoking and running around that's not what you fall by you fall by unbelief amen and that's why this bride is being restored back to the original faith or belief of the fathers because she overcomes by faith because the problem was unbelief and god's going to take care of unbelief what did he fall from the word is that right the word and god said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right after so long a time the word would be known to her all right the word would come for one purpose now hold tight now what i'm saying the word would come to her for one purpose that was for redemption the woman needed to be redeemed amen the whole human race needed to be redeemed because of what happened in the beginning and now the word was going to come the seed of the woman was going to come it was going to come for one purpose and one purpose only and that was for redemption hallelujah jesus spoke the same thing when he was on earth he would send it again listen jesus is here jesus was on earth the fullness of the word made manifest in a body and he's come in the purpose of the word coming through the woman he's now the seed of the woman he's now the fulfillment of genesis 3 he's the fulfillment of the prophecy that yet he standing on earth is the fulfillment of the prophecy knows that this woman is going to do the same thing again so he lays down another prophecy in matthew 17 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said to them elias truly shall first come and restore all things now here you have the fullness of the word standing here the the promise of genesis 3 is standing on earth he's right here the fullness of the word that's coming for redemption but yet he knows that something else has to happen in the plan of redemption and though he's the promise of genesis 3 genesis 3 is not going to be finished genesis 3 is going to finish later what prophecy brought your redemption genesis 3 when was it made manifest to you 2000 years ago no now it's being made manifest right now we're in genesis 3. hallelujah hallelujah nothing ever changes or fades away in the word it just keeps working on down so now jesus is here and he's saying amen he is come he is god in flesh he is the word made flesh and he's going to give his life to pay the price of redemption to buy back all that's been lost oh that had been and all that will be lost he's there but yet while he's there he's saying there's an elias that shall first come and restore all things he's laying down a prophecy that something's going to happen and there's going to be a need for a further restoration because remember john the baptist came to prepare a way not to restore he came to prepare the way of the lord but he never came to restore anything back because the only thing he could restore was back to the law of moses and they don't want to go back to the law they're moving to grace so he prepared a way for grace to come but after grace come they're going to fall away amen and there has to come an elias and elijah that will restore back so jesus on earth the fullness of this promise is now saying it's not finished we're going to be restored back hallelujah now god promised spiritual eve at pentecost pay close attention now god told spiritual evil pentecost told her even before it happened now he's not talking about the pentecostal revival from 1906 he's talking about when pentecost fell on the early disciples back in the book of acts god promised spiritual eve at pentecost told her even before it happened 400 years before the church ever fell that they would fall away and they would do what they've done but he promised in the last excuse me in the last days he would send the word again now remember when he promised the woman in genesis 3 that he would send the word the word came for one reason and one reason only that was for redemption and now he's speaking to the the pentecostal church and jesus is saying elijah shall first come and restore all things because he knows there's going to be a need for a restoration all things had come all things had come amen the word had come in full measure the word had given its life now the the person of the word and the holy ghost had come upon the church all things had come but yet jesus knew that there would have to come something to restore because people would lose hold of redemption hallelujah so where does he give this promise in pentecost acts chapter 3 verse 19 says peter says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before was priests unto you whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things that word restitution means restoration so now he's saying jesus christ had already come amen the spirit of god had already returned amen the church had already come to life but yet he's already laying a prophecy down right here in acts chapter 3 saying that the the heavens must receive jesus christ amen until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophet since the world began this prophecy has been going since the world began and this is a prophecy in genesis chapter 3 that the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent so here in acts he's already saying there must come a restitution jesus christ must be received in the heavens until the restitution of all things that's why it's so important that you catch the sign of his coming because he must be received into the heavens until the restitution of all things until the time that the prophecy in genesis 3 is going to finally be fulfilled amen there must be a all things have come but we're going to fall away from all things and there must be a restitution back to it and that's why when we see the sign of his coming in the cloud there we see brother brahman said what is that he said that's our lord up there what is this it's the time for the restitution of all things this is genesis 3 all over again friends it says now here we are at the end time and spiritual eve just as hebrew eve was promised the hebrew bride was promised the word would return and a spiritual bride from pentecost when she fell at nicaea she promised in the last days that the word would come again if you want another scripture take take over here revelations 10 and the hour and the time of the last angel the seventh angel seventh messenger begins to sound the mystery of god is finished the restoration back to the word the bible said that his messenger of the last days would be restore them back to the original faith again back to the faith of the fathers what are we going back to we're going back to the promise of genesis 3 the seed of the woman we've got to be brought back to the fullness of the word again the fullness of the word coming in flesh we've got to be restored back again how many believes that that's the restoration or the restitution of all things that's when elias shall come and restore all things what we've come to now is friends we've come to not just a prophet showing up and doing miracles and signs it's not that it's bringing us back to the prophecy at the fall when the at the fall when he said the seed of the woman shall come and bruise the head of the serpent and now the seed of the woman came and the fullness of a body called jesus christ and when he comes now he's saying but eli shall come and restore all things because he's got to lay down his life and he knows that that that that natural eve the woman in the garden she fell from the word then he started hebrew eve right and hebrew eve did the same thing that natural eve did the hebrew church fell from the word and now the pattern is set the pattern is set the pattern is set so now spiritual eve at pentecost is going to do the same thing she's going to fall by the word and the only way to restore the woman in the beginning the only way that she could be restored was to receive the seed of the woman amen and the only way that we can be restored is to receive the same thing the fullness of the word so the word comes for one reason and that's for redemption it didn't come to make us excited it didn't come for a show it came for redemption hallelujah brother branham said when he come the word that he had promised come for the wedding he found her wrapped in her substitute so bad that she wouldn't take the real promise that had been made the word christ so when he come to the hebrew church they had been given substitutes until the time that this promised seed would come and when the promised seed would come the substitutes were to be done away with because now the lamb is here we don't need a substitutionary lamb now the lamb of god is here but they so enjoyed the substitutionary system and it becomes such a tradition and so entrenched that now when the lamb himself come they wanted to stay with the substitutes and they rejected the true lamb of god maybe you don't get it let me go over it again i want you to get this she was promised the bride eve to be a redeemer her redeemer would be the word and when the word came made flesh she rejected it she was given substitutes given substitutes to go on until the redeemer came and when the redeemer came she wanted to continue with her substitute and rejected the true word and that was the hebrew bride god promised the spiritual eve as same as he did natural eve that again the word would be restored to her in the last days he would restore it the church to the original word again so now we find out when when god kept his word from genesis 3 and he brought the seed that came through the woman he brought it in a human form called jesus christ and that was the word made flesh that was the full measure of the word of god standing on earth and flesh and it had to come as a human being so that it could be slain and shed the blood which is the price of redemption to buy back all of that seed but when it came they were so used to what they had been given to hold on to until that time amen that they wanted to keep what they had and not take the promise of genesis 3. and for them they missed out on redemption the same thing has happened today the same things happened today now now the full word comes he displays the life he sheds his blood and that life of that blood excuse me the life that was in jesus christ comes back into the church now the church has all things amen they've got the full word of god they've got the life of god on the inside they've come to redemption amen but they would fall away from that place and they would begin to do what the first eve did and when the first eve fell away amen she fell away from the word now this eve is going to fall away from the word by compromising on the word by changing the word by taking creeds and dogmas instead of the word and now she's going to fall away and god would allow that system to go and he had a covering for that system and he was called the kinsman redeemer back behind the throne laying seven stripes of blood to cover the ignorance of the people but god god's desire was not for people to remain in ignorance god's desire was for the promise of genesis 3 to come to fulfillment amen god didn't want a bride that was stuck in ignorance he didn't want a bride that had to be covered for he wanted a bride to come to the full life of jesus christ to the full measure of the word that was his purpose so he had laid down a prophecy before she would ever fall from the word that jesus christ must be received in the heavens until the restitution of all things as spoken of by all the holy prophets since the beginning of the world friends here we are all prophecy from the beginning of the world has been speaking about this coming word what did it come for for redemption brother brahm says in the message the token now remember i'm still just laying a foundation so pay close attention you guys are good students just don't sleep on me or you have to come sing a special if i catch you singing you got to come sing a special and i'll play the piano for you that should keep everybody awake and remember israel came through many things but it was in the evening time when the token was required not in the morning not in the preparation not the 14 days of keeping up the lamb israel knowed something was coming so did luther know so did wesley know it so did finney knox calvin noah this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that these things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they looked forward to it so brother remembers referring now to the token he's talking about the passover amen and the passover feast in egypt they were they were taken to take a lamb they were hold up the lamb and and when they found the lamb had no blemish there was no sickness they found that it was a perfect lamb then they would slay the lamb and collect the blood then after they collected the blood in the evening time they were to take that blood and they would apply it to the little and the doorpost to show that this house is under the blood of a lamb that that blood that's on display is the token now listen the blood is not the token you got to catch this you could have killed the lamb and put it in a bucket and had it sitting beside the door and when the death angel came the death angel would enter in and smite the firstborn of that house because that wasn't the token amen the token was the life on display the blood represents the life and when that was painted so all the world could see that this house is under the token this house is under the life of the lamb and the life of the lamb is on display that's the token and that token was not to be on display until the evening time and until the evening time they were just to keep up the lamb all right watch the lamb see that it's a perfect lamb there's nothing wrong with the lamb the lamb doesn't limp it doesn't have an injury there's not a blemish on it and when they find that the lamb is perfect then they slay the lamb and after they slay the lamb then they take the blood and they put the blood on display and and you know all of israel was forbidden in leviticus to ever eat the blood of an animal because the scripture says the life is in the blood so this blood represents the life that was in the animal amen and in the evening time there's got to be this perfect lamb that's been held up how long has it been held up it's been held up amen it's been held up for two sabbaths because it's the word friends it's the word it's the word it's the word when jesus christ came you say he was a man he was the word made flesh it was the word it was the word that bled it was the word that died it was the blood of the word so brother branham said the old testament in the new testament are two sabbaths so the lamb has been held up through two sabbaths amen the word has been shown now from the old testament through the new testament now we've found that the lamb is perfect amen it's without blemish there's no fault in it it doesn't limp it doesn't halt there's not a spot on it we found out this word is perfect amen and then in the evening time by the evening time messenger he would take and put that lamb on full display and what would the priest of the day do they would take the lamb and they would crucify it a second time spilling the blood of the word the pattern set it has to continue that's why brother branham would come along and preach indictment he said i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ and then people are like you're crazy how did we crucify him because he is the word and when the word came back in full measure and the seals were open and it was rejected by the clergy worldwide that was the second crucifixion of jesus christ and now that blood was collected and now there's a life that comes with that and that life has to be on display in the evening time what is it it's the life amen that was in the sacrifice now has to be on display over your house showing that your house was has been paid for has been redeemed by the life that was in that sacrifice and now when you live the life of the word which is the life of jesus christ when you see the word and you line to that word without making excuses amen without compromising on it but when something in you this is a spirit of god wants to live every word every jot every tittle every line every everything that was taught and everything that was said that brings the life on display showing that the word has bled for me the word has died for me and now i have the token evidence that a perfect lamb has died for me without the token life there's no evidence that the you may have seen a perfect lamb you may have seen the slaying of the perfect lamb but until you take that blood and you paint it over your house their token is not applied the death angel will march right in and he could go right past that bucket of blood he could walk right past the bucket of blood once he gets in he can see the charred remains amen of the lamb but if there's nothing on display over the house there's nothing to keep the death angel out we've come to the time friends amen brother bam said the message isn't just to be talked about it's to be on display it's to be lived what life it's the life of jesus christ what life is that jesus christ is the word so the life of the word has to be on display hallelujah when in the evening time through seven church ages been holding up the lamb proving it's a perfect lamb proving the word never fails showing through the restoration coming through luther coming through wesley coming through pentecost showing that it's a good lamb there's nothing wrong with the lamb but in the evening time the token must be on display israel knew something was coming but it was in the evening time this is out of the token message it was in the evening time when the lamb's blood the token was placed on the on the door yet the lamb was already put up now listen close it's been the lamb all the way through remember the lamb remember this is the word of god it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time but now is token time something's changed marking that we've come to the evening time because it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time see there wasn't the evening time yet they couldn't display the life that's why luther could smoke and curse and persecute the jews and he was absolutely fine because the lamb was back there laying down seven stripes to cover the ignorance the full word hadn't been opened and luther couldn't know those things so now he couldn't have the token on display brother branham said all those seven ages had a dip in the holy ghost a dip in the holy ghost a dip in the holy but now we've come to the full measure of the holy ghost which is the life that was in that lamb hallelujah friends it's available it's here it's token time it's time for the life of the word to be on display amen over his house and his house is his body his church it was the lamb all the way through it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time but now this marks a transition but now you can't go the denominational way it's not going to work anymore you can't go with a partial life lived it won't work anymore because the partial life lived it can only work when there was something back there behind the throne laying down seven stripes of blood to cover for ignorance but now that the full word has come there's no covering for ignorance because the word is here so now it's become we've transitioned from the from the time that that that ignorance would be winked at and luther's age and ignorance would be winked out in wesley's days but now ignorance is no longer going to be winked at because there's no excuse because the full word has come and it's been so thoroughly vindicated you can't deny that this is the word god himself proved this is the word he proved it night after night after night on the platform through signs on miraculous things that we could we could go on for days talking about the vindication of the word amen but but the vindication of the word was only to prove that this lamb is now here the seed of the woman has come amen it's been rejected a second time and now it's token time it's time to take that life and put it on display for the world to sing so you can't it doesn't work anymore to say you know i i just have a bunch of struggles you know i just there's no time for that anymore it's token time we're not under luther's day amen the lamb has been slain we're not under coverings for ignorance anymore once we realize that this is wrong now we've got to get on our face and say god i realize by your word that when i'm living my life isn't matching your word and god the token must be on display i need something more than i have right now i need you to come by the baptism holy ghost and burn that out of my life and you live your life through me amen it's not something you can do yourself but when you recognize it in desperation desperation always calls god on the scene don't ever sit there and think well it's okay to compromise a little bit god knows my heart yeah god knows exactly what's in your heart man's heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it you could sit there and deceive we could deceive ourselves thinking well you know it's just a little of this and it's just a little of that friends it's not holding up the lamb time anymore this is token time the death angels on the march amen we're coming to a time to the showdown time and only that life on display is going in it's time to come to desperation and say god i'm not toting the line and i seem to have no power to overcome amen i need the life that was in the blood that was shed at calvary i need that life to come in me to make a token display to make sure i'm safe there's no other way it was okay for luther to drink and smoke and swear and persecute jews it was okay for wesley to skip out on the baptism of the holy ghost it was okay in those days for certain things because it hadn't been revealed yet but it's not okay today that should put us all into desperation i should put every one of us on our face every day saying lord you've called for nothing less than the life of jesus christ to be on display what did it friends the word is returned the word is returned the seed of the woman is here the promise of the fathers is here he said in joel joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord for your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month a time when the former and latter reign would fall together and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil amen we've come to the time when the floors are full of wheat and the vats do overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer were my great army which i sent unto you and you shall eat plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed when when he restores back all that the caterpillar the canker worm the palmer worm and the locust has eaten when he restored back the bride tree and will never be ashamed again hallelujah in the fourth seal early in the fourth seal brother brahm tells another story and i think we've learned by now that these stories should get our attention when he begins to break down a story all of a sudden antennas go up and we're like wha what's this all about and brother adam the seventh seal he draws our attention to something he said i'm sure that you've noticed that the things that's been happening this week i'm sure you noticed that the little collins boy laying there dying the other night that little leukemia girl the kingdom of god is coming now brother van points to a couple healings that had taken place that week and he said i'm sure you've noticed the little collins boy lying there dying the other night and that little leukemia girl he points to two things and then he says the kingdom of god is coming and it's becoming more from negative to positive as it has been now that ought to choke people from justification to sanctification to the battle of the holy ghost and then here here see we're just drawing closer to god all the time in the fourth seal paragraph seven he's starting very early in the seal he starts talking about a story she noticed when he showed himself to daniel in the vision there'd be a representation of one king like a goat in this place or maybe a tree in next place it would be a statue things he's just making the same thing all the time just be sure that we don't miss it he's showing types and shadows and i was certainly thrilled just a few moments ago talking to a little lady sitting here about 85 years old and she before i let before i went to go west why there was a little girl up in ohio that was i think so that was dying with last stage of leukemia now leukemia is cancer in the blood now remember brother branham in the seventh seal drew our attention to two cases the collins boy and the leukemia girl now look leukemia is cancer in the bloodstream friends we've had cancer in the bloodstream since the fall in the garden of eden there's been a problem with the bloodstream amen but yet there's something that has to come back there has to come a blood that will fix the problem in the blood why was it jesus had to be virgin born why was it there had to be shedding of blood for the remission of sins because the cancer was in the blood so now brother ben i'm right in the fourth right in the fourth seal because the four seal friends is the wrap up of the gentile dispensations the fourth seal is the finishing of the church ages the fourth seal will take the church all the way into the rapture and then lucifer will come down himself the devil will inject himself into the beast and ride out the tribulation so right in the for seal everything wraps up in the fourth seal for the bride we got that so the four seal he's talking about there's leukemia it's cancer in the bloodstream oh the little thing was you know such an awful condition that there was no more hope for her at all they were feeding her by the veins the operation and so there was real poor family brother kid they told them about the lord answering prayer so much and they got together i think and hired someone and brought the little girl down and she was a very pretty little girl about six or seven or nine years old and she was back there in the room and when we went before the lord the holy spirit gave a word to her and they had to take her and have to they had to take her and they have to take her and feed her you know that way through the veins and when she left she was crying for a hamburger and so taking her food by mouth and they gave her the hamburger and just went ahead feeding her natural in short time a few days they'd taken her back to the doctor and they the doctor just simply couldn't understand he said like it even wasn't even the same girl said why there's not even one trace of leukemia about it nowhere nowhere at all and she was dying they done give her up just feeding her through the veins she had done turned yellow you know how they get so she was already pale she was already in the pale horse so now she's at school playing with the other children just as happy as she can be that's the leukemia girl now let's read about the collins boy he picks the story up in detail in the fifth seal he says now i've got a testimony that i'd like to give i heard it i could i could be that that i'm wrong i think the people are here that testimony applies to then a few days ago you know a few days ago when i was at my home now in arizona i got a call that said there was a little boy that had rheumatic fever and that goes to the heart so he's got a problem with the heart we find out later it was rheumatic fever in his bloodstream see the two cases brother branham points to and the seventh seal one leukemia cancer in the blood one rheumatic fever disease in the blood and it's affecting his heart but under the fourth seal there's going to be something that's going to fix the blood listen i'll just love what the prophet says just listen his father and mother are such darling precious friends of mine as one of our deacons here church brother collins his little boy little mikey was suffering with romantic fever of the heart and the doctors had sent him home put him in the bed and told the parents not even to let him up nor raise him up and take a drink of water but take it out of a straw he was so bad and the parents faithful come to the tabernacle here and believes a few nights ago we'd announced healing service on sunday but seeing that we're going to have to answer questions so then we had to admit the healing service then i had a little something that i've been keeping in my in the inside of my heart and the mother and father wanted to know if they could bring the child to the room and they brought the little fellow out there and the holy spirit pronounced him healed and so the parents being respected that taken the little fellow home and sent him to school just sent him on to school the doctors got a hold of it so the doctors wasn't very well pleased with such a thing so he told the mother that the baby should be in bed of course and she'd give him the story and i think the man i understand is a christian believer by the nomination a seventh day adventist the doctor is so it's time he said it's time for the child to be examined so you ought at least to have it examined she said very well took the child down and the doctor examined it the blood where the rheumatic fever lays and so i understand that the doctor was so amazed he didn't know what to do the little boy is perfectly normal sound and well now is the comments here might have told that wrong is that right sister collins yep that's little mikey collins just about six seven years old and what happened right in that room about three nights ago oh there had to be somebody in that room besides human beings it was the great mighty jehovah that's right that comes to honor his word and i'm so grateful to hear that so here we've got the collins boy and and in the seventh seal brother ben's now said did you notice what's been happening this week you see that colin's boy and that leukemia girl the kingdom of god has come the kingdom of god is coming and he gives a little bit of detail here that i want to i want to hone in on on the fifth seal it says two or three days after that in school we went to doctor and the doctor was so amazed he said there's not even one trace of leukemia found in the child brother is referring back to the same stories we just talked about found in the child now that's instantaneously on the mark the power of almighty god to take a bloodstream and cleanse it out right like that and put the pulsation of new life back in there because your bloodstream is your life mortal and create new cells and clean out the old and what is it it's absolutely i say this it's a creative act of the almighty god to take a bloodstream that's contaminated with cancer and to the little fellow yellow and puffed out and within just a few moments time a brand new bloodstream hallelujah natural types of spiritual here comes brother branham and the seals and he gets through the force he starts talking about this leukemia girl and he's trying to draw your attention to something that there's disease in the blood amen this boy with rheumatic fever it's affecting his heart he's got the rheumatic fever in the blood but here in just a moment's time there's a god on the scene that can totally change a contaminated bloodstream and make a new bloodstream and friends i tell you there's a god on the scene today by the opening of the word that brought back the fullness of the holy ghost that can change your contaminated bloodstream that old life that you used to live that hybridization he can change it and give you a brand new blood transfusion with the blood of the life of jesus christ what did it the opening of the word it brought it brought the promised seed the son of god jesus christ back again to do what to change your contaminated blood life come to the world with you've got cancer in your blood or you may have nothing wrong with your physical blood but that life that's in you is contaminated amen that natural life that you've lived in this natural body it's cancer ridden it's got rheumatic fever and it's affecting your heart but there's a god amen there's a god because the kingdom's coming down but there's a god who wants to give you a blood transfusion he wants in a moment's time to clean out the bloodstream and give you new blood cells the life of jesus christ we're not living in luther's day it's not wesley's day it's not even the falling of the gifts in pentecost this is the person of the holy ghost himself come down to eject his life into your life to purify that old life and give you the life of jesus christ and that life is the token in this day and without that life you're susceptible to the death age hallelujah but there's a purpose for this coming it's not just to shout and dance and have a good time we're so excited about the old life being cleansed how many is excited about the old life being cleansed about there being a power here that will purge out and burn out all the sin nature all that's wrong and give a new life amen but there's a purpose for that because the bride could never attain to the position that she was called to be with guilt and condemnation and the former life plaguing our thoughts friends we're called something to something higher than that we can't be sitting here and now this is when we get right down to home because we can't be sitting here expecting to manifest the full life of jesus christ still feeling condemned in our flesh you go to pray for somebody and oh you know brother branham went to went to pray for a little child that was sick and brother branham had sinned right he had had his wife lied to the lawyer for him to cover for him he stepped out of the house and now he goes down to pray and he's prayed for thousands of people thousands of times and time after time after time god answers his prayer and they're healed but he goes this time and as he goes to move his hands to the child amen the lord speaks to him said how can you pray for that child after what you've done you lied see what condemnation will do condemnation will stop the manifestation of a son of god but if your heart continues we have one greater we have one greater we have an advocate who can clean the bloodstream we are called to token life we've been called to manifest the very life of jesus christ but of old things in the past and old ways and old habits and our old self every time we go to pray if it's plaguing us then we don't have prayer of faith every time we go to act and we step out all of a sudden we're condemned because of our past condemned because of what we used to be condemned because of what we've done friends there's got to be something coming this day that'll break that completely away from you and what is it it's a perfect blood from a perfect lamb amen the lamb's been held up for so long showing that he's perfect but but the blood has come the life of the blood has come in full measure this day to prove that you're perfect oh you still don't believe it amen you are the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ you never did it in the first place amen in your first condition you never sinned in your first condition you were perfect and your first condition you came from god there's absolutely nothing wrong with you but the virgin birth amen believing in this virgin word that's come back by faith in that being washed by the blood of the lamb puts you back in your original condition which is perfect attribute of god son or daughter of god fully redeemed he said wednesday you've got to stop looking at yourself because god's not looking at you when you come down to prayer and you kneel down before god and you start making requests and supplication god's not even looking at you he's looking at the lamb and if the lamb is perfect you're perfect because you've identified yourself with this lamb amen when the worshiper would come in the old times under substitution he'd bring a lamb amen and he could have he could have had dirty garments he could have been tattered he could have been bruised and beaten himself but the pie priest never looked at the man it didn't matter what kind of condition this man was in he put his eyes on the lamb because if the man brought a perfect lamb this man was going to be made perfect so the man couldn't just come and drop off his lamb and go off and say the lamb took care of it but this man at the time of the slaying of the lamb he would have to take his hands and put his hands on the lamb and be completely identified with the lamb and when he was completely identified with the lamb then they would slay the lamb and the innocent life of the lamb would cover his sins that's why we have to come and be completely identified with our lamb completely 100 percent identified with the word of god and then we're perfect we can't walk around with condemnation you know if we're guilty and it's not under the blood then let guilt drive you to desperation amen and receive the life amen of god but let it purge you so thoroughly clean that your blood issues change and you receive a blood transfusion and now you have the life of jesus christ on the scene and you're now perfect in the eyes of god here's what brother branham says i i want you to just listen to me we're in the same place the same quote when he talks about god doing a blood transfusion he says within just a few moments time a brand new bloodstream now listen to what the prophet says next i believe i'm not going to speak in his name i'm going to speak in my revelation of my faith this is what brother branham's saying my revelation of my faith what happened in sabino canyon the other day i believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator i believe he can make a squirrel appear if a man or woman just got a part missing and that's complete animal itself oh god i love him do you believe amen brother rem said in the feast of trumpets he's talking about those two witnesses and they're bringing israel back to the feast of atonement where they're going to recognize that they rejected the lamb and they're going to come in contact with jesus christ the true lamb for the atonement he says the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal and world tradition to the genuine atonement the word what is the genuine atonement the word this is exactly why that you can see jesus christ nailed to a cross amen 2 000 years ago but reject jesus christ come in the fullness of his word today and you have not come to the fullness of atonement you have recognized where atonement was you have recognized the purchase of atonement but atonement is the word and the seventh angel's message is to bring us to the full measure of atonement which is the full word if you got the full word and received the full word you've received the true atonement and what is atonement it's a covering of your sin now you have no sin it says in christ the mystery of god revealed the church is the blood of christ oh friends church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood when you receive the life that was in the blood you've received amen that is the token of the blood that's the evidence of the blood that is the blood it's the spirit of god amen it's the spirit that was in that blood he goes on to say the prophet goes on to say when we really place our hands upon our sacrifice jesus and feel in our hearts that we're guilty and know that what we're doing the blood of that sacrifice the life that was in the blood was god himself so he comes back upon you the holy spirit on on another message he says now but when jesus the son of god virgin born shed his blood the life that was in that blood was god itself the bible said we are saved by the life the blood of god not the blood of new a jew not the blood of a gentile but the life of god now the token is not the blood it is the life that was in the blood the holy spirit see the world wants to claim that they're under the blood of jesus christ my question is where is it we're under the blood of jesus christ we're under the true atonement where is it brother ben said that blood was spilt and the in the in the ground of judea went back into the dust but what is it it's the life that was in that blood that's the fullness of atonement that's what's come back when the word came back the life came back now there's just a couple more things i want to say and then we'll go i want us to catch something brother branham links two things together in the fourth seal that's going to be really important for you and i this is tremendous faith building for me now he says at the feast of the trumpets he said the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it jesus said in john 6 53 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you i don't know how you get around that how are we going to get around that jesus said unless you eat amen unless you accept ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you how are you going to eat his flesh and drink his blood what is his flesh he's the word made flesh unless you eat his flesh and drink his blood what's his blood the life is in the blood it's the holy ghost unless you eat his word receive his word and drink of his spirit you have no life in you john 6 there's no there's no wiggle room around here we can't get around the scripture unless you and this is why this is why the catholic church came up with transubstantiation because they knew they don't have the word and they don't have the life so they had to come up with a substitute and the substitute amen is a round wafer and wine and they're saying when we pray a certain prayer and ring a little bell all of a sudden this turns into the literal body of jesus christ and the literal blood of jesus christ and now when you eat that wafer and drink that blood you've received him and now you have life amen what a bunch of nonsense it's become our money-making racket worldwide amen they come to communion so that you can be part of christ oh my goodness he wasn't talking about a natural bread and a natural blood he said unless you does you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but friends the blood was limited amen and the and the bread has been limited for 2 000 years the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000 years so now you have a weak anemic church that's only getting portions of bread not the full portion little pieces of bread and only little sips amen a dip in the holy ghost here a dip in the holy ghost there but they're not able to come to the full life because they only have a little bit of bread and a little bit of wine now you see why the seals had to be open and the word had to be restored because the full life has to come back now we've got to come back to genesis 3 the seed of the woman has to come back to the church not just a piece here and a piece there and a little sip here but now the whole bread jesus says i am the bread of life it comes down from the father amen now the word has been restored under the fourth seal we see 1963 takes place the opening of the seals and now all the bread has come back amen all of the word has been restored and when all the words restored all of the holy spirit has been restored now how much of the life of jesus christ can you live how much of the life of jesus christ can you live if you have full word and full spirit which is full life then you can live the full life of jesus christ all that he did you can do amen all that happened in him all that happened in the bridegroom can happen in the bride because now we've received the full measure again not a portion not a bit not a dip but the full baptism of the holy ghost bringing the full life of jesus christ with the full measure of the word and bringing the word to pass now listen to what brother man says under the fourth seal how he ties these things together i believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the bases of the blood of jesus christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it came from where did it come from lucifer i said this before but i think some people missed it i want to lay this down here real good we've come back to now we're not under a portion of the spirit and a portion of the word living a portion of the life we understand that the revelation of jesus christ should do something to us it should change the way we live the message didn't come so that we could write textbooks and debate with theologians that's pointless that's an absolute waste of time but the revelation came that by revelation of the word it brings the life of the word which should be on display it should actually change the way we live amen and as god reveals more to us we should be living a more a more christ-like life not less so as we walk along and god reveals more we shouldn't be living a less of a life we should be living more of the life right and so now we've come now to where we're not taking a dip and we're not here for the covering of sins of ignorance but we've come to the full atonement the word and that full atonement will absolutely remove every bit of your sin and drive it back to where it came from and it came from lucifer himself and this is the point that i want to make when a sinner goes down with their sins attached to them they haven't come to atonement haven't come to the word when a sinner goes down with sins he comes up in the white throne judgment with his sins and he stands judgment for his own sins now we know that sin originated in heaven when lucifer rebelled against a god but but lucifer now has come down and caused deception in eden caused the woman to fall and now there had to be redemption and all these things happen but whenever we go down with our sin we come up with our sin lucifer stands over here and he's guiltless but when a son or daughter of god passes through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ that sin is broke off of them broke up and sent back to the originator the original perverter of the word and it goes back to lucifer so now when we stand there on the day of judgment we have come up totally completely sinless we're not to be judged for anything because there's no sin attached to us but everything that you ever did wrong and everything that you ever tricked into doing and everything that happened because of hybridization now you're sitting on the throne sitted beside christ jesus and don't you know that the saints shall judge the world he give judgment unto his saints and we're sitting here judging the world and here comes lucifer and attached to lucifer is everything that you ever did wrong not to you to him amen when a sinner goes down though he's duped by the same thing you're duped by though he's fallen at the same condition you're falling by he comes up bearing his own sins and the own consequences for his sins and he has to stand judgment that way and lucifer is scot-free why do you think he hates you so much why do you think he hates this word so much because the children of god are the only ones that can condemn him the children of god coming through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ through the price of redemption they are the only ones that can condemn him and when you pass through this the bleach it breaks it off of you and sends it back to the original perverter satan himself and he comes before you oh how the tide has turned oh how things have changed i'm now spotless and literally white i'm now the bride of jesus christ sitting on the throne and now he comes everything that he tried to pin to me everything that he tried to do to me he is now standing in front of me facing for his own crimes and i'm completely guiltless he said wednesday haman is going to hang on his own gallows and satan is going to fall by his own deception so in the fourth seal brother brahm said it goes through the clorox it bleeds the chemicals and sends it plumb back to where it came from and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does and sets a man across the chasm again as a son of god see and then he becomes the creative power of god is in him and at least whenever god can command it to be done it'll be done we and we get back amen see that when moses under the blood of bulls and when he met that light that pillar of fire in that burning bush and stood down there in a commission god had given him and he was a prophet and when the word of the lord came to him he spoke in even things created by the word and now if it'll do that under the blood of bulls what about the blood of jesus not covered but remitted altogether and you stand in the presence of god as a redeemed son now see the church is far beyond its standard of living brother branham takes this cloroc bleach and you coming free he takes that and puts you in condition to manifest the word of god it brings you across the chasm as a son of god and the creative power of god is in you and whenever god commands it to be done you can speak why what does that the clorox bleach of the blood of jesus christ brings you back across the chasm there was a chasm because of sin amen and jesus didn't just build a bridge across the chasm brother dwayne lawson was talking about this at camp he didn't just build a bridge across the chasm what he did is he removed the chasm and brought you back by the belief of the blood of jesus christ back to your original sinless condition and now you're standing with god on his side and now a fully redeemed son of god further in the force theo said that's what the blood of jesus christ does to the true child of god when he confesses that sin and stands there justified mercy goodness even is so great till god said i can't even remember it anymore and he's absolutely my son verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain he connects these two things listen to this he's connecting full redemption full atonement being purged of your sin he connects it with if you say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe in what you said it shall come to pass you can have what you have said you are a redeemed son amen i know that's true i've seen squirrels to appear yonder on six different times that not one that i would be and not the one that would be sitting here just as he can create squirrels the same as he can create flies or frogs or anything else he's god the creator that's right and with no mortal being but when the sin of that mortal is confessed and dropped into the clorox of the bleach of jesus christ that bleach is all sin he's purely unadulterated without sin without fall he that's born of god does not commit sin for he cannot sin the bleach stands between him and god how could it ever get there when it breaks it up and sends it right back to the one who perverted it it breaks it up and sends it right back to the one who perverted it and the fourth seal brother branham starts talking about this blood condition that's completely clear then he starts talking about the the restoration of the word bringing us back into this the seed of the woman back to full redemption back to a full life and he ties it together with speaking creation why because with revelation you understand that we're totally sinless there's no condemnation therefore to them that are in christ jesus we're free friends when god quickens it in your heart you can speak it when god drops it by faith into your heart you can ask for it if it's in the word you can have it if he quickens it to your heart you can have it why because you've come to the realization there is no sin in me but the problem is we see the word we understand the word we believe the word but our heart conditions god begins to stir in our heart build faith but all of a sudden but i dis and i that and i this we need a good dose of the bleach of the blood of jesus christ and a revelation that we are now the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ and what we see in the word we come before god in a sinless condition to ask for what we need and when god begins to quicken into your heart just speak it friends amen speak it but these polluted lips they're not polluted lips they're purified lips this old me and this all that there's not a thing wrong with you friends in the eyes of god you're perfect amen ask what you will and it shall be done for you i want to finish with this quote musicians if you can come brother tommy in the church age book the revelation of jesus christ so how we need a revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit i thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation think about this revelation is not making you smarter so you can go show somebody how much you know revelation is life-giving well i you know i don't understand and these things are so hard and i don't think you have to know that i think god just looks at what's in your heart sorry friends revelation is life-giving revelation is not intellectual conception revelation is not textbook understanding revelation is when god quickens into your heart and you say that's nothing but the truth explain it i can't but it's nothing but the truth i know it's the truth what did you just hear i can't tell it to you but something inside of me said that's the truth that's revelation friends you listen to the tape and something inside of you stirs and a minute later somebody asked you to explain the seven seals i can't explain it to you but i believe it that's by revelation friends and revelation is life-giving he said may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it by what by a fresh revelation all right he said the church is going to become something they're going to become by by a fresh revelation they're going to become something does anybody know what we're going to become it's going to take a fresh revelation if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven what is this word to do give you continuous life-giving prevailing revelation and by it the prevailing revelation by a fresh revelation amen you become the word manifested see it's never been based off willpower it's never been based off your ability to do right or wrong the revelation amen of where we are and what we're doing brings the life of god and the life of god amen is on display and is the word made manifest it's not good enough to say well the prophet did all that that's wonderful the prophet did all that the bride's supposed to live that life the whole bride not each of us have to become a prophet we don't all have to raise the dead we don't all have to do those wonderful things amen but but but that life should be in the bride that life should be in the bride and how we gonna do it because we're perfect we are sinless as god is why true atonement has come and we've stepped into the true atonement and now the old hybridization the blood condition the cancer in your blood you've got a new bloodstream in a moment's time he gave you a new bloodstream and now that's the life that we live i said i was going to tell you the last quote but that was the last quote while you're sitting let's stand and we'll try to make this the last quote while you're standing second corinthians 5 21 says for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him in the church age book in the revelation jesus christ he says he refers to the same scripture for second corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ it says that he jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have become the very righteousness of god don't call yourself anything less don't confess anything less that by your union with jesus christ he became sin for you that in him you might become when you're in him baptized in him by the baptism of the holy ghost you might become the righteousness of god so then why can't you ask for what's in the word yes why can't you pray for the sick and expect him to be well why can't you amen why can't a family gather together under the high priest of daddy when somebody's sick in the family why can't they pray and expect that god will answer the prayer why because they've become the righteousness of god by being birthed in jesus christ he says we must accept the fact that by our union with him have become the very righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other so if you reject the fact that you've become the righteousness of god you reject the fact that he became sin for you and you're not even saved that one's a good one tell the devil just stick that right in his eye next time he comes down then on the pike and wants to accuse you amen everything under the blood fully redeemed amen to reject the fact that you're the righteousness of god would also be to reject the fact that he became sin for you and then you're not saved but if you're saved and your life is tucked away in jesus christ and you've come to the full atonement in our day the word then you are as righteous as god is righteous because on you have become the very righteousness of god because to say that i've come to the true word i've come to the atonement for this day i've come to the baptism of the holy ghost but i'm still a rotten sinner then you make god's blood worthless [Applause] you by your own confession has denied the righteousness of god because that was god's blood that was shed for you that's god's word that has come down in the fullness of atonement and if his word can't wash you with the water of the word and make you spotless white and wrinkle free then god's not god and your connective confession of your condition is making god less than what he is i don't want to be standing in line on that in the day of judgment taking the very holiness of god and making it dirty the very righteous word of god and saying it's not good enough because if you've come to the word for your day if you've come to the full measure of the opening of the word and you've received it with all your heart and received the baptism of holy ghost then you are pure snow white sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ and when you go around saying i'm no good i'll never amount to nothing i'll never get over this you have taken the righteousness of god and polluted it with your own words never let a negative confession come out of your mouth concerning the word you are the very righteousness of jesus christ by being born again and being in christ his word is holy he is holy i may not feel like i'm worth two cents it don't matter the word says i'm perfect i may be having a crummy lousy day i may have had somebody at work make fun of me i may have somebody call out my errors and call out my mistakes and show how horrible i am and everything i try to do amen that doesn't make any difference because i don't read that in the word what i read in the word that he became sin for me then in him i might become the very righteousness of god and with a revelation of being in that condition what's going to stop you from overcoming in this life see the devil is lying to you he's always been lying to you he always will lie to you but if he says anything other than what this scripture says if you're born again in jesus christ if he tells you anything than this he's lying to you [Applause] hallelujah it's time to shut him up and the only way to shut him up is with the word to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other if he became sin for you then your men made the righteousness of of god now we know the bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it's not real to the majority of god's children it's just a good verse in the bible but we need to have it made alive to us that we take that will take revelation friends i don't know about you but i'm tired of saying something different than what the word says i'm tired of the devil telling me something different than what the word says but i'm going to say what the word says because it builds faith and we've got to operate a life of faith not unbelief but faith amen if you believe how many believe he became sin for you you personally that that he was made sin for you not sinful he didn't do a thing wrong but all your sin was put on him he was made sin for you if you believe that then you are by being in him you are the very righteousness of god you are the evidence of his righteousness you're the evidence of his holiness you're the evidence of his perfection amen well you know brother branham talks all through the seals about revelation 19 jesus christ returning on a white horse amen and he says behind him follow the resurrected saints on white horses and white robes what are the white robes the righteousness of the saints what are the righteousness of the saints it's the righteousness of god he kept his word he provided a sacrifice he restored the word and he put it on you making him righteous your white robe is evidence to his righteousness your perfect condition your total atonement your 100 unification with god amen it is evidence of his righteousness his power of his word and his holiness not yours it's something he did you didn't do it he did it he decided before the foundational world he provided the lamb he brought the prophet on the scene he he restored the word he brought it down your path he gave you by grace the faith to receive it it's not what you did he did it has nothing to do with you so when it comes time to operate in the word of god quit talking about what you're doing because it has nothing to do with you it comes time now to take and apply the word and live the word and perform the word and all of a sudden we quit talking about what god's done we start talking about what we are amen it was never based on what you are and what you've done and what you look like and how you feel it's never been based on that so quit bringing that into the equation look at the lamb he's looking at the lamb look at the restored word look at the true atonement look at the power of god and believe and then just start walking in the life of jesus christ hallelujah don't make the holy word of god polluted and corrupt by your negative confession if he's if he made you perfect by his washing of the water of his word if he brought the true atonement in our day to make you perfect if he brought you through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ and removed all your sin and sent it back to the original don't you ever say anything different what if i make a mistake if you make a mistake you come back to the fountain you repent and you stay in your sinless condition if i make a mistake don't i have to do pencils and all of a sudden not pray for healing for a couple years and what you know don't i have to don't i have to sit on the sidelines for a while and not get back in the game who told you that has anybody ever heard that before has that ever whispered in your mind oh i can't even go to church i've been so condemned i've had such a horrible day i've done so much wrong i can't pray for this i can't pray for that hey listen brother branham went down to pray for that little baby and and also he said how can you pray you lied so he went and he talked to the lawyer and made it right then he went and prayed and he came right back he didn't sit on the sidelines he didn't take a timeout he didn't put himself in the penalty box once he took care of repentance he came right back he laid his hands on that baby and that baby was healed [Applause] you don't have to go to some devil's penalty box amen he's the one who's at fault not you and when you come under the atonement the blood of jesus christ you take it off of you and put it right back on him he can go sit in his own penalty box but i'm not taking time out from living the life of jesus christ just because i'm in a human condition and fall down once in a while i'm not stopping i'll get right back up dust my pants off repent if i got to make things right i'll make it right and i would that moment pray for the sickest person that would come here and ask for it why because of his righteousness not mine because of his word not my word because of his actions not my actions fourth seal the word came back to the church what came back with the church everything when the word came back it was the restitution of all things elias came first to restore all things jesus christ was received in the heavens until the restoration of all things but when it's time for the restoration of all things we see revelations 10 the mighty angel descend with an open book in his hand coming down for the restitution of all things and now you yourself are fully restored back to god he brought you across the chasm now you're standing on god's side a fully redeemed son or daughter of god don't let anybody ever tell you anything different anything different from that revelation is a lie how are you going to be lost you can't be lost how are you going to fall away you can't fall away you've already been brought across the castle oh god is good friends i love him i love him because he first loved me i believe him because by his grace he's given me faith to believe him he's done it all all i'm doing is responding to what he's done he's the husband sending love letters i'm just the humble little servant girl who now has this king paying attention to her don't know how to act exactly never had anything like this before lived a horrible life lived a dirty life just a little peasant little servant girl and all sudden the king himself writes me a little note and sends it over and says i've been thinking about you that's what these messages are they're love letters from the king to you he writes another one and says your condition's not your fault that's right another little letter says i've known all about you before you were born and where you're at now is not your fault it's a fault of an enemy if you'll be mine i'll take care of all of that for you and we're just a little servant girl the peasant girl's been beat up and knocked around all her life and lived a wicked life and done horrible things she thinks how can these things be how can i believe these things but something on the inside starts to turn and say i believe what he's writing i believe what he's saying it doesn't make any sense why me how could it be me i i'm the lowest of the lowest the worst of the worst how can it be me but there's something in me that believes it's for me the king writes another little letter he writes a little letter i've got a place prepared for you something inside though in a ragged condition something inside says that ain't nothing but the truth see that little girl is going to be redeemed and it's not going to be because of anything she's done but it's going to be what she yielded herself to all she has to do is respond to the love letter all she has to do is accept the offer all she has to do is receive the invitation and friends you may be that little ragged girl a little servant girl who's been beat up and knocked around by the world and made to feel absolutely worthless and no good but have you have you read the king's love letter have you heard him whispering to you those little love secrets is there something in you that's just silly enough you silly little girl to believe what he's saying what is that where did that come from you were born to be united to the king you can't make it happen you couldn't make him right you you couldn't make him you you couldn't make him pay attention to you you couldn't do anything but all you can do is respond how many feels like responding right now love letter let's bow our head their heavenly father we thank you for your word lord we know that in our day the day that we're living lord you're here in the full measure the fullness of atonement has come to bring a perfect life to bring perfect faith for a perfect life for a perfect rapture lord give us a revelation of how holy you are and that we have become your righteousness lord let the lies of the devil that has lied to your people let it just fade off the scene now god your prophet told a story about the little wash girl her cousin's lord wanted to win over the the fine young man but he wanted something different he wanted character so he went to the washer girl and he began to speak to her and woo her and gave her an invitation she accepted it nobody else believed it lord they all mocked her and they all made fun of her and told her she was silly for believing something so foolish but she couldn't help it inside she believed and because she believed she made ready oh god let us be like that washer woman lord let us believe and if we believe let's accept the offer lord and help us to make ready lord let us get the garment put on lord and get everything in preparation for we can hear the wagon wheels on the road you're coming lord let us be in the garment lord we thank you o god clothe us in your very righteousness so that we can come to meet you while we wait let us live that life lord above all other life the life of jesus christ the token that's on display in this hour we thank you lord draw us lord out of our own thinking let us think like the word not like we've thought all of our lives let us reject that thinking lord now let us deny those thoughts lord and only think what your word says lord help us to bring every thought subject captive to the obedience of christ let us only think thoughts that come from your word let us only speak words that are found written in the pages of your bible let us live the life you've called us to live we ask it in the name of jesus christ bless your people lift us higher on eagle's wings with a fresh revelation lord that'll help us manifest the word of the hour we ask for these things in jesus christ's name amen god bless you saints sing brother justified justified you have not done it in the first place you're justified [Music] justified oh
