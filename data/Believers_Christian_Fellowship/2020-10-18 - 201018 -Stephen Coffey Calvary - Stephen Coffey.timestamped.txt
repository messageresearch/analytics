[7:19] house of the lord this morning
[7:21] isn't this a wonderful place to be
[7:25] it's cold outside spitting rain so for
[7:28] that reason it's a good
[7:29] good place to be but aren't you happy to
[7:32] be in the house of god
[7:34] with people of like precious faith able
[7:38] to listen to the word to worship god in
[7:40] spirit and in truth
[7:42] that is something that we should not
[7:43] take for granted
[7:45] isn't that wonderful praise the lord
[7:48] maya it's good to be with you look
[7:50] around see so many different friends
[7:53] it's just a pleasure to be with you very
[7:55] thankful that brother chad invited me to
[7:56] be here with you today
[7:58] it's an honor and it's a real privilege
[7:59] to be among you
[8:02] amen well if you would i'd like to
[8:04] invite you to take your bibles with me
[8:05] thank you musicians
[8:08] enjoyed the the music and the singing
[8:10] brother nathan enjoyed that
[8:12] special wish i was going to be here next
[8:13] weekend to hear you
[8:15] but uh we'll be praying for you
[8:19] i'd like to invite you to turn with me
[8:22] if you would to the book of galatians
[8:24] and i'd like to read in chapter six
[8:27] galatians the sixth chapter
[8:35] and uh it was also good to be with
[8:39] the lamb family yesterday as they
[8:40] celebrate the uh
[8:42] the marriage of um of two wonderful
[8:45] young individuals
[8:47] and uh to witness the
[8:50] marriage of a lamb not the lamb
[8:54] that was uh you knew that joke was
[8:56] coming but uh
[8:58] it still cracked me up a little bit i
[8:59] enjoyed being with him you know i think
[9:01] brother branham said
[9:02] the best gift that god could give a man
[9:05] outside of his salvation
[9:07] is a wife a good wife and
[9:10] that's the truth that's nothing but the
[9:13] truth
[9:14] a good portion of who i am today is
[9:15] because of my wife
[9:17] and um and all that god has brought us
[9:19] through and brought us together for
[9:21] but you know marriage takes work it's
[9:23] not an easy thing you old-timers can uh
[9:26] tell me of that much more easily than i
[9:29] could
[9:29] at this point in my life
[9:32] but there's nothing there's nothing
[9:34] better
[9:35] than having someone who loves you and
[9:37] that you love you dwell together
[9:39] you you learn things together you learn
[9:42] about each other
[9:43] you grow you change together
[9:47] change is inevitable it's the only thing
[9:48] that is constant
[9:50] and you change together it's a beautiful
[9:52] thing it's crazy to think that you could
[9:54] take two humans from two separate
[9:55] families
[9:56] merge them together and they get along
[9:58] and then they create more humans who do
[10:00] the same thing
[10:01] it's a fabulous institution
[10:05] but uh it works
[10:09] praise the lord galatians the sixth
[10:12] chapter
[10:15] i'd like to read verse 14 with you
[10:19] but god forbid that i should glory
[10:24] save in the cross of our lord jesus
[10:25] christ
[10:27] by whom the world is crucified unto me
[10:30] and i unto the world
[10:34] let's pray if you bow your heads
[10:35] heavenly father
[10:38] lord thank you for all the many things
[10:41] that you have given to us
[10:44] thank you for your blessings and may we
[10:47] count every blessing
[10:48] which are many
[10:52] lord we thank you for the truth as we
[10:55] pursue it the best we can
[10:58] lord by your grace today may we seize
[11:01] everything that you have for us may you
[11:04] encourage
[11:05] may you lift up may you instruct
[11:10] may you remind
[11:13] lord we pray that you'd afflict the
[11:16] comfortable
[11:17] comfort the afflicted we surrender
[11:21] ourselves entirely into your hands
[11:24] we love you so much we say thank you
[11:29] bless these few moments that we have
[11:31] together in the name of the lord jesus
[11:33] christ we pray
[11:34] amen you can have your seats thank you
[11:36] for standing with me
[11:47] i was uh reading this week and and the
[11:51] life
[11:52] and the ministry of the apostle paul has
[11:55] always been of great interest and a
[11:57] wonder
[11:58] to me if i could write a book no one
[12:01] would read it but if i could write a
[12:02] book
[12:04] i would write it on the life of paul
[12:09] as as it as it should uh uh be a wonder
[12:13] to every christian
[12:14] the life of paul from what i can tell
[12:16] the uh
[12:17] a little over half of the new testament
[12:19] is attributed to paul more than half of
[12:21] the
[12:21] of the new testament is attributed to
[12:22] paul and then even when we look at the
[12:25] book of acts
[12:25] about his life the book of acts is
[12:28] largely about
[12:29] his life and uh
[12:32] the pauline of epistles that have been
[12:34] called in the in the
[12:36] on to the book of acts with the with the
[12:38] uh anointing of a lion
[12:40] he charges into the the world
[12:44] with the message of the gospel he gives
[12:47] the church
[12:48] the knowledge of their first love
[12:52] he he he was the one that that that
[12:55] spread it around
[12:57] and they caught a hold of the vision and
[12:59] they
[13:00] they grasped the message of the hour
[13:03] and he was the one that led that charge
[13:05] into a world
[13:06] that knew hardly anything of christ they
[13:09] knew nothing of christianity
[13:13] and he presented that to the first
[13:15] church
[13:16] i admire the experiences that he went
[13:20] through in his life
[13:21] i i admire most importantly as i was
[13:24] just remarking
[13:25] his obedience to the scriptures and uh
[13:28] of which he was a great scholar and a
[13:30] well-studied man
[13:32] of the truth and of the of the torah of
[13:34] the bible
[13:35] as well as um uh uh within the sanhedrin
[13:38] and all of the
[13:39] inner inner workings of the temple he
[13:41] was well studied he was a scholar of the
[13:43] scripture
[13:45] and so later in his life as he began to
[13:48] serve christ he submitted in obedience
[13:51] to the word which he believed all of his
[13:53] life in a greater way as it was revealed
[13:55] to him
[13:57] and what i find remarkable and what we
[13:59] find in the life of paul
[14:00] is that it take to obey is better than
[14:03] sacrifice
[14:05] as as the prophet samuel said but as we
[14:08] see from the life of paul it takes
[14:09] great sacrifice to obey
[14:14] and brother branham said that apostle
[14:16] paul was a bible scholar and a man who
[14:18] experienced so much but he never rested
[14:20] his doctrine
[14:21] upon his his experiences alone
[14:24] and i think that's very important that
[14:25] we that we we know that because as
[14:27] believers we experience
[14:29] so much we we have the blessing of his
[14:32] presence in a way
[14:32] that many people don't have it we
[14:34] experience it so much but it's important
[14:36] that we don't rest our doctrine on the
[14:38] experience alone
[14:39] and paul did not do that and he was a he
[14:42] was a hebrew by birth a citizen of rome
[14:45] and he studied in a greek university and
[14:49] so he was a well-rounded individual he's
[14:50] well educated
[14:52] of course but uh if you look the the
[14:55] the jews had a concept of light
[14:58] and i heard someone say this one time he
[15:00] they had a concept
[15:01] of what the light was that god is light
[15:04] and the romans had this idea of glory
[15:06] for the glory of rome
[15:08] and the greeks just lifted up knowledge
[15:12] to the point that it was unhealthy so
[15:13] the jews understood that the concept of
[15:15] light
[15:16] the romans went for the the glory of
[15:19] rome and the greeks
[15:20] were consumed by knowledge in the
[15:22] pursuit of such
[15:24] and then in second corinthians chapter
[15:26] four and verse six paul
[15:28] with his ability and his his intellect
[15:31] um in his revelation
[15:35] and by the inspiration of the holy
[15:36] spirit he says and he brings all three
[15:39] of those different components of his
[15:40] his background together and he says for
[15:42] god who commanded the light to shine
[15:45] out of darkness hath shined in our
[15:48] hearts
[15:48] to give the light of the knowledge of
[15:50] the glory of god
[15:52] in the face of jesus christ so he brings
[15:55] his hebrew background
[15:56] his roman citizenship and the knowledge
[15:58] of the greeks and
[15:59] and his understanding of that and he
[16:01] brings it together and he says
[16:03] uh uh he he takes the abstraction of the
[16:07] messiah and brings it to the embodiment
[16:09] of the lord jesus christ
[16:10] all in that all in that scripture he
[16:12] commanded the light to shine out of
[16:14] darkness and
[16:15] hath shined in our hearts in the light
[16:16] of the knowledge of the glory of god
[16:18] in the face of jesus christ it's
[16:20] magnificent
[16:23] and uh he says here
[16:26] in our text a man with with
[16:30] his intellectual ability and he he said
[16:32] many times as he was going around
[16:35] uh different places he said i come not
[16:37] to you in the wisdom of man
[16:38] or the with the enticing words of man's
[16:40] wisdom i come to you in the power of god
[16:42] alone but with his ability to think
[16:46] and and to construct an argument and
[16:48] with his background
[16:50] he comes to this point in his life
[16:53] which was actually towards the end of
[16:55] his life when he wrote
[16:57] the book of galatians with his tenacity
[17:00] for what he believed in with all of his
[17:03] experience with all of his suffering
[17:06] and most importantly with his
[17:07] understanding of the revelation of the
[17:09] message of the hour
[17:12] he says god forbid
[17:16] that i glory in anything
[17:20] or anyone save
[17:23] the cross jesus christ
[17:29] now it's important i believe as
[17:31] believers that we
[17:32] grow in the knowledge of christ as the
[17:35] spirit of wisdom and of revelations as
[17:37] it says in ephesians
[17:38] uh i believe ephesians 1 17 uh
[17:41] as paul he prays that the the god of our
[17:44] lord jesus christ the father of glory
[17:46] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[17:47] and of revelation in the knowledge of
[17:49] him
[17:50] so as believers as christians we we must
[17:53] grow and in grace and acknowledge we
[17:54] must
[17:55] mature the seed that god has placed
[17:57] inside of us
[17:58] it grows and it produces fruit it's not
[18:01] for the intention of just sitting there
[18:02] and looking pretty
[18:03] the christian life is to be manifested
[18:05] it's to be exemplified
[18:07] it's to be something that that has an
[18:09] action uh uh
[18:10] from it it's it's to be in action uh
[18:13] your faith is to be in action god never
[18:16] intends for you to stay
[18:17] in the same place he intends for you to
[18:19] do
[18:20] you're not to be just hearers alone you
[18:23] are to be doers of the word
[18:25] and so we must take what we hear and we
[18:27] must grow
[18:28] in grace and in in in the knowledge of
[18:31] him
[18:31] by the spirit of wisdom and of
[18:33] revelation who is the holy ghost
[18:36] that works among us and in us
[18:39] it's natural that we mature from the
[18:42] elementary things of christ as a newborn
[18:44] christian
[18:44] you you learn things you hear things
[18:47] that are new and fresh to you
[18:48] but you must grow you must increase your
[18:51] understanding
[18:52] you must go forward in christ that is
[18:55] his intention that's the goal
[18:56] that's what happens when you water a
[18:58] plant you receive growth
[19:00] if you subject the plant to the right
[19:02] atmosphere you have
[19:03] fruit and so that's god's intention
[19:07] we grow in revelation we grow in the
[19:09] knowledge of him
[19:10] hebrews chapter 6 verses 1 through 5.
[19:12] therefore
[19:13] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[19:15] of christ let us go on
[19:17] unto perfection not laying again the
[19:19] foundation of repentance from dead works
[19:21] and of faith toward god of doctrine of
[19:23] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[19:25] of the resurrection of the dead
[19:27] and of eternal judgment and this we will
[19:29] do if god permit
[19:32] so he's saying and and this is uh paul
[19:34] saying to the hebrew church he says
[19:36] this we will do if god permit this is
[19:38] where you were
[19:39] i want god to take you further so don't
[19:42] stay where you are
[19:43] we should move further than where we are
[19:46] don't just don't just stagnate the
[19:49] purpose of the lord jesus christ in his
[19:51] people
[19:52] is to make them fulfill the word of god
[19:54] in their daily life
[19:56] what is the purpose of of god's word if
[19:59] it isn't to
[20:00] manifest in your own life if it isn't to
[20:02] change you if it isn't to mold you and
[20:04] shape you
[20:05] more into the likeness of jesus christ
[20:07] himself
[20:08] that is the purpose of the word that is
[20:10] what the word does is it changes
[20:13] and so he's saying this we will do if
[20:16] god permit you've heard the gospel cry
[20:18] you've desired the sincere milk of the
[20:20] word as as peter said
[20:22] as babies in christ you desired this
[20:24] once you tasted
[20:25] that the lord was good you desire this
[20:27] sincere milk of the word
[20:28] and then paul he would later say to the
[20:30] corinthians
[20:32] later on he said i have felt i have i
[20:34] have fed you with
[20:36] milk and not with meat hitherto uh
[20:38] because you are not
[20:39] able to bear it so there is a time and a
[20:41] season when you are able to
[20:43] bear certain things and mature in
[20:46] revelation and understanding
[20:48] and god knows exactly where each one of
[20:50] you are
[20:51] you should never feel ashamed if you
[20:53] don't understand something
[20:55] god has a purpose in what you understand
[20:57] and what you know and what you can
[20:58] comprehend
[21:01] you don't have to feel like you're
[21:02] you're uh uh
[21:04] not as spiritual as somebody else and
[21:06] and you you you condemn yourself
[21:08] for it god knows exactly where you are
[21:10] in your walk with him
[21:12] and he is the leader of your walk with
[21:14] him
[21:15] isn't that right it's not the it's not a
[21:17] denomination it's not the church it's
[21:19] not any one pastor
[21:20] it's god and the individual and he is
[21:23] concerned about what you know
[21:25] what you understand and how you grow and
[21:27] the pace at which you grow
[21:30] this we will do if god permit and and he
[21:33] said
[21:33] paul said to the corinthians he said i'm
[21:35] not able to feed you yet because you're
[21:37] not there
[21:38] so you do grow you will get there just
[21:40] give a time
[21:41] and pray and give yourself to the lord
[21:43] so he can take you there
[21:45] so the holy ghost can take you there
[21:46] when you get ahead of god's timing
[21:48] that's when you get yourself into all
[21:50] kinds of trouble
[21:54] god knows when we're ready and he he
[21:56] knows and he will grow you as you need
[21:59] first corinthians 3 7 so neither
[22:02] is he that planteth anything nor he that
[22:04] watereth
[22:06] but god that giveth the increase it's
[22:09] god
[22:09] that increases what you know what you
[22:11] understand what you have in your heart
[22:13] it's he that does the the building and
[22:16] the growing
[22:18] then peter comes right along in second
[22:20] peter in chapter
[22:21] one in verse 10 through 14 and he says
[22:24] wherefore the rather
[22:26] brethren give diligence to make your
[22:28] calling and election sure
[22:30] for if you do these things you shall
[22:31] never fall
[22:33] and for so an entrance shall be
[22:34] ministered unto you abundantly
[22:36] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[22:39] and savior jesus christ
[22:41] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[22:44] you
[22:44] always in remembrance of these things
[22:48] though ye know them and be established
[22:51] in the present truth
[22:52] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[22:54] the tabernacle
[22:55] to stir up by putting you in remembrance
[22:59] knowing that shortly i must put off this
[23:02] my tabernacle
[23:03] even as the lord jesus christ lord jesus
[23:06] christ
[23:06] has showed me he says now listen i know
[23:09] that you're establishing the present
[23:11] truth
[23:11] but i pray and i hope that i can stir up
[23:14] what is inside of you
[23:15] and bring to your remembrance the things
[23:17] that you are to do
[23:18] to bring to your remembrance the things
[23:20] that are perhaps more
[23:22] elementary he says if you do these
[23:25] things then you will never fail
[23:26] you will never fail
[23:30] and i believe and i as as what's been on
[23:33] my heart
[23:34] for the past couple weeks and it's just
[23:36] been pressing on my heart it's pressing
[23:38] on my heart even before brother chad
[23:39] asked me to come and speak
[23:41] there is one passage of scripture
[23:45] that i pray never becomes common to me
[23:51] and i also pray that it never becomes
[23:53] common to you
[23:55] as i fear there is a danger of it
[23:58] becoming so
[24:00] as as i was thinking and just in my own
[24:03] heart and in my own mind
[24:05] i i felt like i had lost just the
[24:08] the impact of it it's it's matthew
[24:11] chapter 27
[24:13] verse 27 through 56.
[24:16] it's the story of calvary
[24:20] the story of the cross
[24:24] i hope that that passage matthew chapter
[24:28] 27
[24:29] that it never becomes common to me
[24:33] i feel as many people
[24:37] and sometimes they've lost the impact
[24:42] or the feeling it's not about feeling we
[24:45] know that's not about feeling alone
[24:48] but they've lost the impact of the cross
[24:53] the passion of the christ
[24:57] peter he says in in paul paul says i i
[25:01] pray
[25:02] that you you'd grow
[25:05] in grace and acknowledge and then peter
[25:06] comes right behind and he says you've
[25:08] been established in the present truth
[25:11] but i bring to your remembrance
[25:14] i want to stir up that which you know
[25:17] that which you know to be the truth
[25:22] i believe uh we're in danger of the
[25:25] magnitude of the cross and perhaps i'm
[25:27] just speaking from personal experience
[25:29] so
[25:30] forgive me if you will but i believe
[25:32] some
[25:33] sometimes we're in danger of losing the
[25:34] magnitude of the cross
[25:36] to where it becomes common to us and it
[25:39] has no impact it doesn't move us
[25:43] emotionally it doesn't move us but and
[25:46] and we
[25:46] emotion is is good a lot of times we say
[25:50] it
[25:50] it's it's it can be dangerous and it can
[25:53] be
[25:54] but emotion is good god gave it to you
[25:57] for a reason
[25:58] he made you that way for a reason and to
[26:00] be moved
[26:01] by what what what christ did for us
[26:05] as a group of believers with the
[26:07] understanding that we have
[26:08] with the revelation that we have with
[26:11] the depth of the mystery that we have
[26:14] and to not be moved by the cross what a
[26:17] shame
[26:20] it's often the the first thing that you
[26:22] are taught when you're a young christian
[26:24] new in the faith but as time goes on you
[26:25] learn new things you grow and you mature
[26:28] but as you go spiritually in the message
[26:29] of the hour you experience
[26:31] amazing things uh that that most people
[26:34] on this planet uh uh uh could never
[26:37] experience um you you experience the
[26:41] presence of god in a way that most
[26:43] people will never have the privilege of
[26:45] experiencing
[26:46] the vast majority of the people on the
[26:47] earth will never uh
[26:49] be in the midst of a group of believers
[26:51] who are worshiping god as they should
[26:54] and and praising the lord jesus christ
[26:57] and you have that privilege and not only
[26:59] that you you have that privilege
[27:00] several times a week and you step into
[27:03] that and you experience that and you go
[27:05] through that
[27:06] and you have that that that honor of
[27:08] being in that presence you grow in grace
[27:10] and acknowledge and you're
[27:11] you you you are the grace the only grace
[27:15] that the world will ever experience
[27:18] you and and your relationship with
[27:20] christ and
[27:21] them seeing who you are is the is the
[27:24] only grace that they will ever see
[27:26] and you are that grace to them
[27:30] you as a result of your uh
[27:33] relationship with christ as a result of
[27:35] the presence of god in our midst
[27:38] uh you are hidden from the storm
[27:42] that that rages in the hearts of
[27:44] everyone that does not know the goodness
[27:46] of christ
[27:47] you are hidden from that storm and when
[27:49] we think we have problems
[27:51] we are hidden from so much
[27:54] and and however 2020 has impacted you
[27:57] you are hidden
[27:58] and and hidden under the wing of of
[28:01] christ
[28:02] more than you realize you are kept from
[28:05] evil
[28:06] more than you realize god won't tent you
[28:09] more than what you can bear
[28:10] but you are kept from the evil one much
[28:13] more than you could ever
[28:14] understand and then the enemy that lurks
[28:18] in the shadows and
[28:19] and wants to pounce on you and is kept
[28:22] by the grace and mercy of god
[28:24] and you have that privilege
[28:28] you fight the enemy on a daily on an
[28:30] hourly basis but you don't
[28:31] fight the victory or fight the enemy for
[28:34] victory
[28:35] you fight the enemy from a position of
[28:37] victory
[28:39] you are victorious you are an invincible
[28:42] army
[28:43] and thus you fight the enemy not for the
[28:45] victory not
[28:46] for the win you fight from a position of
[28:49] the wind
[28:50] you've already got the win
[28:51] [Applause]
[28:53] that's who you are you experience the
[28:55] richness and the goodness of god
[28:57] almighty
[28:59] and and you you have to keep yourself
[29:00] humble about it
[29:02] we've come so far in the opening of the
[29:04] word
[29:06] in the revelation that we have and it's
[29:09] a good thing
[29:10] all of those are good things but i
[29:14] believe in the midst of all this so many
[29:15] times
[29:18] we can fail to remember
[29:22] even though we say it over and over and
[29:25] over that there was a real
[29:27] man jesus of nazareth
[29:31] that was beaten and bruised
[29:34] he was a lamb led to the slaughter
[29:38] so that you could say and have
[29:41] all of what i just said
[29:45] he did that so that you could sit here
[29:49] and have all of that
[29:55] the apostle paul says far be it
[29:58] from me to boast in anything
[30:02] or anyone save the cross of jesus christ
[30:08] may we never trivialize the cross
[30:12] may we never do that
[30:15] christ's death and burial and
[30:17] resurrection is is not
[30:19] elementary in my opinion it's one of the
[30:22] deepest subjects that you could possibly
[30:23] talk about
[30:25] it's it's the reason that we are here
[30:28] and with the revelation of the opening
[30:30] of the word you can look back and see
[30:33] the truth of what the resurrection
[30:34] really was to us
[30:36] we can see what the resurrection
[30:38] produces in us
[30:40] with with the understanding that we have
[30:42] and and and
[30:44] within the remembrance of the cross
[30:47] lays the mystery of your future
[30:50] your expected end within the mystery of
[30:53] the cross
[30:54] lays your expected end and i believe by
[30:56] his grace and by his mercy towards you
[30:59] the reason that the cross is so
[31:01] important the reason that we should
[31:03] never
[31:04] trivialize it the reason that it should
[31:06] never lose its impact
[31:07] on us as individuals and move us
[31:10] emotionally
[31:11] is because the same power that raised
[31:14] jesus christ from the dead
[31:16] dwells in you today the same power
[31:20] that raised jesus christ from the dead
[31:23] it dwells in every single one of you
[31:26] you may be tired you may be anxious you
[31:29] may be depressed
[31:30] you may be uh worried about the week
[31:32] ahead you may be worried about your job
[31:34] loss
[31:34] you may have any of the issues that come
[31:37] as a result of living in laodicea
[31:39] but you have inside of you the
[31:42] resurrection power
[31:46] you have inside of you the same power
[31:49] that brought jesus christ from the grave
[31:53] it lays inside of you and god promised
[31:56] in isaiah 55
[31:57] the word will not come back to me void
[32:00] it will not come back to me without have
[32:02] achieving what i
[32:04] set it out to accomplish and you have a
[32:06] promise in you
[32:08] that the same power that was in jesus
[32:10] christ
[32:11] that raised him from the dead is inside
[32:13] of you today
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:16] that's why we should never lose the
[32:18] impact and the emotional
[32:21] impact of the cross of jesus christ
[32:26] may there be inspiration in the present
[32:31] that comes from the remembrance of the
[32:33] cross revelations 12
[32:36] and and the bride uh uh overcame satan
[32:40] uh himself by the blood of the lamb
[32:44] we can see this story from genesis to
[32:47] revelation
[32:48] the story of the cross but before even
[32:52] that in the mind of god in the
[32:53] foundation of the world
[32:54] even before the beginning it was in the
[32:57] mind of god
[33:00] 1949 the deity of jesus christ brother
[33:02] branham he says the same power of christ
[33:04] that was hung on calvary's cross
[33:06] the same god that raised him up in the
[33:07] day of resurrection
[33:09] is in you now and you that's got the
[33:12] holy ghost
[33:13] oh don't you love him oh hear his voice
[33:16] today
[33:18] you know the interesting thing uh i know
[33:20] some of you was talking about the rich
[33:21] last night about the uh
[33:22] the trip that they took to israel and
[33:25] you know i stood
[33:26] at golgotha's hill and i've looked at it
[33:28] and i've been there i've been at the
[33:30] tomb
[33:31] and you know i i never experienced any
[33:33] power there
[33:34] i i felt let down i'll be completely
[33:38] honest with you
[33:40] i was there and i was expecting this you
[33:42] know great
[33:43] feeling and i felt nothing
[33:47] i was recently i was on a work trip and
[33:48] i was in louisville and i went by
[33:50] brother branham's grave
[33:51] and i was standing there and i was
[33:52] thinking this is brother brandon's grave
[33:54] i had never been there
[33:55] just until recently and uh
[33:59] i was standing there and i was looking
[34:01] at it i was thinking man
[34:03] this is brother brandon's grave and i
[34:05] felt
[34:06] nothing i went to the place where the
[34:08] angel came down
[34:10] in the in the in the place and i matched
[34:12] it up with the photo and was standing
[34:13] right there and i was thinking
[34:14] this is awesome but i felt very little
[34:19] and you know what came to me is a
[34:20] realization that oh
[34:22] it's not there anymore it's in me
[34:26] i realized oh that's that's that's why
[34:29] this is an amazing place it's sacred to
[34:31] god
[34:31] it's an amazing place it's an amazing
[34:33] piece of geography on the face of the
[34:34] earth
[34:35] but god is not there anymore he's in me
[34:39] and i realized that that the power that
[34:41] was there
[34:42] has transformed itself into me why
[34:45] i don't know i still ask the question
[34:48] why
[34:48] but it is and i believe it is and my
[34:51] faith makes it so
[34:53] and i'm there by the revelation of jesus
[34:56] christ
[34:56] as the spirit of wisdom and of
[34:58] revelation works in the knowledge that
[35:00] we have of him
[35:01] he brings you into an awareness that you
[35:04] are
[35:04] the godhead bodily
[35:08] may the cross have its full effect in us
[35:10] today
[35:11] i i pray that it would may that may i
[35:14] pray that it would move you
[35:16] today i pray that as
[35:19] just in thinking of it just in bringing
[35:21] it up that it would remind you of who
[35:23] you are
[35:25] because of of calvary's cross sin was
[35:28] finished because of calvary's cross
[35:31] those who accepted your victory over
[35:34] death
[35:35] was won because of calvary's cross
[35:38] your healing was signed sealed and
[35:40] delivered
[35:42] your healing was signed sealed and
[35:43] delivered
[35:45] because of the cross your anxiety your
[35:48] depression
[35:49] your mental struggle your issues was won
[35:52] and finished
[35:54] because of calvary's cross
[35:58] because of calvary's cross you as the
[36:00] elect of god
[36:01] you see your redemption story clearly
[36:03] unfolding before you
[36:07] and your eternal future of godliness and
[36:09] peace and joy
[36:10] was purchased for you because
[36:13] of calvary's cross
[36:16] no matter how humble you are or how
[36:18] spiritual you are
[36:21] or how knowledgeable you are no matter
[36:24] how
[36:25] uh uh uh how how high you may feel
[36:29] you and me on the same level kneeling
[36:31] before the cross
[36:33] no matter how good you've been or how
[36:37] bad you've been you and me are on the on
[36:40] the same level
[36:41] as we kneel before the cross we're on
[36:44] equal ground
[36:47] you're we're we are on equal ground
[36:50] because it was god that brought us there
[36:52] you didn't choose to find yourself to
[36:54] the foot of the cross
[36:56] it was he that brought you there you
[36:59] didn't you didn't choose
[37:01] to find yourself to the place where sin
[37:04] would be finished for you he brought you
[37:06] to that place he brought you
[37:09] to the foot of the cross for god so
[37:11] loved the world
[37:12] that he gave he brought you to that
[37:15] place
[37:19] you are here this morning not by your
[37:21] own doing but because
[37:23] god loved you
[37:28] i pray that impacts you we're all
[37:31] sitting in this room today
[37:34] because he loved you
[37:38] god forbid that we should glory in
[37:40] anything
[37:42] or anyone save
[37:45] the cross of jesus christ
[37:50] if you have your bibles open to matthew
[37:52] 20 uh
[37:53] seven and forgive me um
[37:57] for for doing this
[38:01] five thousand years ago abraham is
[38:03] walking up the mountain
[38:05] with a promise in his son and he's going
[38:07] to express his faith in god
[38:09] not an intellectual faith but a real
[38:10] genuine faith he's going to offer his
[38:13] son
[38:14] as an expression of his faith in god and
[38:17] abraham was there
[38:18] with his son and he has the dagger and
[38:20] he's
[38:21] bringing it down on his son and god
[38:22] stops him and said
[38:24] abraham because you have done this your
[38:27] seed
[38:28] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[38:32] and daniel would write later on in in
[38:34] daniel 7 18 he said the saints of the
[38:36] most high
[38:37] shall take the kingdom and possess the
[38:39] kingdom forever forever
[38:41] and abraham called that place uh that
[38:44] that
[38:44] happened when the angel stopped his hand
[38:48] he called it jehovah jireh the lord will
[38:50] provide
[38:51] and 2 000 years ago from this point
[38:54] on the same mount abraham was to
[38:56] sacrifice isaac uh
[38:58] he fulfilled the promise god fulfilled
[39:01] the promise
[39:03] and gog off this hill on calvary and he
[39:05] took his son up that hill
[39:09] and as the knife was coming down that
[39:11] time it didn't stop
[39:12] god led his son up calvary's hill and
[39:15] the knife was not
[39:16] not withheld
[39:19] because it is is written in isaiah
[39:23] the word will not return unto him void
[39:26] it was predestinated to be so
[39:28] brother branham said in 1956 he said in
[39:30] the era of god's deliverance shot from a
[39:32] bow
[39:32] i love that title he says look yonder at
[39:35] calvary
[39:36] where a man hung on the cross and died
[39:38] and the only real example that was ever
[39:40] put on the wall
[39:41] in the world for human beings to live by
[39:44] is the man christ jesus
[39:49] uh again forgive me if you will
[39:53] but i don't know the last time that
[39:54] you've read this
[39:56] turn with me to matthew chapter 27. if
[39:59] you would let's start in verse 27. now
[40:01] this is before
[40:02] uh uh and i'm just going to go over this
[40:04] as time allows
[40:05] judas who was four ordained to
[40:09] um his condemnation betrayed jesus
[40:12] already
[40:13] and the the the sham trial which wasn't
[40:16] even really a trial at all
[40:18] it's basically a mob the sanhedrin they
[40:20] delivered jesus to pilate
[40:22] and um pilate plays uh politics and
[40:25] and he learned the inner working the
[40:28] inner workings of god's perfect will
[40:30] and how little power he actually had and
[40:32] uh we all learned that lesson at some
[40:34] point or another
[40:35] and they released barabbas and jesus is
[40:37] condemned to the cross and pilate washes
[40:39] his hands
[40:40] and the the people themselves cry out
[40:42] his blood be upon us
[40:43] and they were they remain in their
[40:45] blindness to this day and then starting
[40:47] in verse 27
[40:50] then the soldiers of the governor took
[40:52] jesus into the common hall
[40:54] and gathered unto him the whole band of
[40:55] soldiers and they stripped him
[40:57] and put him on a scarlet robe and when
[41:00] they had played at a crown of thorns
[41:03] they put it on his head and a reed in
[41:05] his hand and they bowed the knee before
[41:07] him
[41:08] and mocked him saying hail
[41:11] king of the jews and they spit upon him
[41:14] and they took a reed
[41:16] they smote him on the head
[41:20] after that they had mocked him they took
[41:23] the robe
[41:23] off from him they put his own raiment on
[41:27] him
[41:28] and led him away to crucify him as a
[41:32] society i i believe that we have
[41:34] become numb to violence
[41:37] it doesn't impact you especially if
[41:40] you're around hollywood at all
[41:42] it doesn't impact you you don't feel it
[41:46] even if you've seen news stories of
[41:48] bombings or whatever it may be
[41:49] violence doesn't impact us as a society
[41:51] hardly anymore some people who are more
[41:53] responsive to blood than others
[41:54] but violence as a whole does not impact
[41:58] us
[41:58] and if you think about this for the
[42:00] romans the romans who gloried in
[42:02] and it was a sport for people to have
[42:06] hand-to-hand combat with swords and
[42:07] spears
[42:08] and to to cut each other open only it to
[42:10] be finished off by predatory animals
[42:13] if they survived in an arena and they
[42:15] called that
[42:16] sport for them
[42:19] there had to be something far worse for
[42:21] a criminal
[42:22] if they called that sport and it was
[42:24] around that time that rome fell when
[42:27] sports was at its apex
[42:30] and if they called that sport then there
[42:32] had to be something far worse
[42:33] for a criminal that's what the romans
[42:35] did hollywood has done its best to
[42:38] capture the scene
[42:39] of the passion of the christ
[42:42] but i don't think we i don't think we
[42:44] fully grasp it
[42:47] we can read just just so just so
[42:49] casually
[42:50] and they stripped him and they put on
[42:52] him a scarlet robe when they had plated
[42:54] a crown of thorns
[42:55] i don't know if you've ever seen the
[42:57] actual thorns that they would put on his
[42:58] head but those
[42:59] bushes are all around and they're
[43:01] they're two or three inch
[43:03] thorns very narrow very sharp
[43:06] and they took that and they they they
[43:09] pushed it down
[43:10] on on jesus's head
[43:15] the the savior the man that the decide
[43:18] the disciples called
[43:20] master the one that we
[43:23] we look to the person of the lord jesus
[43:26] christ because he was the word
[43:28] made flesh and we we think about that we
[43:32] think about that
[43:33] that man who was there
[43:36] and i wonder how much it actually moves
[43:38] us what actually went on
[43:40] because it was your sins and it was my
[43:43] sins that put him there
[43:47] after that they had mocked him they took
[43:48] the robe off
[43:50] they took jesus and they beat him until
[43:52] his bones laid bare brother branham said
[43:54] they they beat him until his bones
[43:56] stared at you
[43:57] as the psalmist wrote in psalm 22 17 i
[43:59] made i may tell
[44:00] all my bones that they stare upon me
[44:04] and i just i just want you and forgive
[44:06] me for for
[44:07] um speaking on such an elementary level
[44:10] it's pressing on my heart don't don't
[44:13] miss the opportunity
[44:14] to grasp the humanity of the situation
[44:19] don't don't miss the opportunity to to
[44:22] remember the horrible nature
[44:25] of what happened to jesus christ
[44:31] i think the romans believed that this
[44:34] method of humiliation of
[44:36] of beating of of uh crucifixion
[44:39] was more a scare tactic than it was
[44:41] anything else if people would witness
[44:43] this
[44:43] in capital punishment perhaps they would
[44:45] just um
[44:46] they would uh um
[44:50] pers dissuaded away from crime and i
[44:52] agree with him
[44:54] it was the most painful death that they
[44:56] could concoct
[44:58] to beat him to to mock him to strip him
[45:02] naked
[45:03] to an open shame and for him to
[45:07] willingly
[45:07] submit to it he knew that it was going
[45:10] to happen
[45:11] he prayed lord would this could this cup
[45:13] pass from me
[45:14] and yet he willingly submitted himself
[45:16] to that kind of brutal torture
[45:18] in the pain and the severity of being
[45:20] beaten like that
[45:22] and in the the the the blood running out
[45:24] of of him
[45:25] even before all of this the the the
[45:28] horrible nature of the actual cross took
[45:29] place
[45:30] and he's there remember isaiah 53 it
[45:33] says for he was wounded
[45:35] for our transgressions
[45:38] and he was bruised for our iniquities
[45:41] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[45:43] him
[45:43] and with his stripes we are healed
[45:49] 55 in the redeemer and redemption
[45:52] once placed your hands by faith on the
[45:54] head of the lord jesus
[45:55] feeling the the the pains of his
[45:57] suffering yonder at calvary
[45:59] in your stead remember it was your sins
[46:01] that done it to redeem you
[46:03] he did it god himself become flesh so
[46:06] that he could pull the stinger
[46:08] out of death
[46:11] they mocked him and i think few group
[46:13] fewer groups of people
[46:14] could be more obscene and and uh
[46:18] horrible to be around than a group of
[46:20] roman soldiers
[46:22] and they said that the band of soldiers
[46:23] the entire band came around him
[46:25] they prodded him with a stick they gave
[46:26] him a reed because a king needs a
[46:28] scepter
[46:28] they pressed the the crown of thorns
[46:31] upon his head
[46:33] and pushed it down
[46:37] and then in verse 32 it says and they
[46:40] came out they found a man
[46:42] named simon cyrene uh uh
[46:46] by name cyrene is a place in libya
[46:48] that's about 900 miles away
[46:50] and uh they actually um he had traveled
[46:53] over 900 miles to be there for the
[46:55] passover
[46:56] because there's a there was a group of
[46:57] jews at that time there's a group of
[46:59] jews in
[47:00] that that place and they would have most
[47:02] likely been in jerusalem because of that
[47:04] and so he was there you never know what
[47:06] what the lord is doing in your footsteps
[47:09] to guide your footsteps to where you are
[47:11] today
[47:12] and and simon was there and they asked
[47:14] him to come and and they compelled him
[47:16] to bear his cross
[47:16] verse 33 and when they were come unto a
[47:19] place called golgotha
[47:20] that is to say a place of a skull
[47:24] jesus was to carry his own cross through
[47:26] the via del rosa i've walked that
[47:28] it's a long walk most likely he carried
[47:32] uh
[47:32] only the vertical beam which have which
[47:34] according to the lumber that was there
[47:36] would have weighed about a hundred to
[47:37] 200 pounds i i don't know exactly i'm
[47:40] just assuming
[47:42] this was during the passover so there
[47:44] were busy people all along the streets
[47:47] people running about families in town
[47:50] this walk is a long
[47:52] walk and in the heat it's hot
[47:56] it's a miserable it's a it would be a
[47:57] miserable place to be
[48:01] in 34 34 they gave him vinegar to drink
[48:04] and mingled it with gall
[48:06] and when he had tasted thereof he would
[48:08] not drink
[48:10] according to the research that i could
[48:11] do that was a cheap
[48:13] roman wine and it was mixed with gall it
[48:15] was actually
[48:16] almost a sensory relieving drug so it
[48:20] was actually a cheap wine a vinegar wine
[48:22] that would actually relieve or dull
[48:24] temporarily the senses
[48:25] so when it says here that he he drank
[48:28] mingled with gall and when he had tasted
[48:30] it thereof he would not drink so he knew
[48:32] what it was and he wouldn't drink it in
[48:33] other words
[48:34] he wanted to bear the full impact of the
[48:37] pain
[48:38] that he was just about to endure he
[48:40] refused
[48:42] uh for better lack of the term the advil
[48:45] that he could have taken the tylenol
[48:48] that he could have taken
[48:49] he said i don't want any of it he
[48:50] refused it he said i want to feel
[48:53] the full impact of the pain and of the
[48:56] anxiety that i'm about to go through
[49:00] 35 and they crucified him they parted
[49:03] his garments casting lots that it might
[49:05] be fulfilled which was
[49:06] spoken by the prophet they parted my
[49:08] garments among them and upon my vesture
[49:10] did they cast lots
[49:13] they crucified him they you you probably
[49:16] know
[49:17] much of this is what i'm saying and uh
[49:20] again i apologize for being so
[49:21] elementary
[49:23] but perhaps some of you need to hear
[49:24] this maybe maybe this is this is what
[49:27] you need to hear today
[49:28] there's also children here who perhaps
[49:31] need to
[49:32] to hear the impact of the cross there
[49:34] was um
[49:36] they would take and he most likely
[49:38] carried the long beam
[49:39] uh that was there or the the cross beam
[49:42] that was there and they would tie the
[49:43] cross
[49:44] beam to them was about 100 200 pounds
[49:45] and they walked him to the place
[49:47] of the skull on calvary's hill and then
[49:50] he was there and then they would take
[49:52] that and place it on the main beam which
[49:54] was
[49:54] uh typically ready to be hoisted or
[49:56] already there
[49:58] and then they would hoist them up with
[49:59] ropes or whatever it would be pulley
[50:00] systems
[50:01] and so they they had him there and then
[50:03] they would they would put the individual
[50:05] down
[50:05] and they would take the nail which uh
[50:07] there was a body exhumed in jerusalem
[50:10] near near around the city that was
[50:13] actually crucified by the romans during
[50:14] that time they dated it back to that
[50:16] time
[50:17] and they they knew that the the nails
[50:19] would have been probably seven eight
[50:20] nine inches long and they would be
[50:22] tapered uh iron nails
[50:24] and they'd be very sharp and they would
[50:25] they would just that's what they used
[50:27] for the crucifixion was that length of a
[50:28] nail
[50:29] and so they would put it some say they
[50:31] put it on his wrist
[50:32] thomas said i want to feel his hands and
[50:34] jesus said i want to put it in my hand
[50:36] so
[50:36] i believe they put it in his hands and
[50:38] the hands are not able
[50:40] to to handle that weight so when you put
[50:43] when you put the nail that's why a lot
[50:44] of people think they put it on the wrist
[50:46] because the hands are the the wrist can
[50:48] handle the body weight of a 150 pound
[50:50] man
[50:51] but the hands cannot they would just
[50:52] tear apart and so
[50:55] wherever they put the nail they would
[50:57] put it there and they drove it in and
[50:58] they drove both nails in
[51:00] and then they put the feet typically on
[51:02] a little step or something like that
[51:04] and they put both of his feet there and
[51:06] they they nailed the feet
[51:08] down and what would happen is they they
[51:10] because of that support
[51:12] they would let their their knees go a
[51:15] little bit
[51:15] because they felt the support so they
[51:17] pushed themselves up and jesus at this
[51:19] point was was very bloody and his blood
[51:21] had had largely let out and so he he
[51:24] didn't they wouldn't have the strength
[51:26] and so they made this
[51:26] as excruciating as they possibly could
[51:29] and so when he was there
[51:30] they would they would let the the the
[51:33] cross
[51:34] do its work and they would let their
[51:37] knees give way and it would put the
[51:39] pressure on the hands
[51:40] and then when they did that it would
[51:41] restrict the the lungs
[51:43] to the point where they couldn't breathe
[51:45] in or breathe out so they could
[51:47] they could inhale but they couldn't
[51:48] exhale and so they'd have to push
[51:50] themselves up
[51:51] on that little post where their feet
[51:53] were which were nailed
[51:54] into the the the post so it's
[51:57] excruciating pain and they'd have to do
[51:59] that to exhale
[52:00] and then they would let themselves go
[52:01] down and eventually that that
[52:03] excruciating
[52:04] pain would would give way and they would
[52:06] die
[52:07] but typically it took a long time almost
[52:10] nine hours to die
[52:12] so that's why they would come by and
[52:14] take a post and break the knees of the
[52:16] individual
[52:16] they'd stab them they'd do whatever they
[52:19] could to get them to die because the
[52:20] roman soldiers didn't want to just stay
[52:22] out there
[52:22] until they died they unless they wanted
[52:24] to leave them out there
[52:26] for for for a longer time in which case
[52:28] the birds and everything would come in
[52:30] and and and pick at it and
[52:34] this this is this is what jesus endured
[52:39] and uh
[52:43] i was i was just i was just sitting in
[52:45] my office and i was just thinking of
[52:47] this
[52:48] and uh like ben
[52:51] sitting his office and you just the lord
[52:53] just moves you in certain ways
[52:55] and i just began to cry and i realized
[52:59] in myself i don't think i've ever cried
[53:02] about this
[53:04] i don't think that i have ever cried
[53:08] after reading what happened to the lord
[53:10] jesus christ on the cross
[53:13] which he did for me
[53:17] he took on my inability to save myself
[53:23] he he endured that excruciating pain and
[53:26] and refused anything that would dull his
[53:28] senses
[53:29] he he wanted to feel the full
[53:32] impact of the pain for me
[53:37] he he did that so that i could stand
[53:41] here today
[53:42] and say with faith i am redeemed
[53:48] i am the redeemed
[53:53] i i realized i don't think i had ever
[53:54] cried about it
[53:57] and you can imagine the people that were
[53:58] around you can imagine the disciples who
[54:00] were witnessing this
[54:02] not not filled with the holy ghost yet
[54:04] and they were witnessing this and they
[54:05] were thinking
[54:05] what on earth i imagine it may have been
[54:08] very similar to the people
[54:09] who surrounded brother branham right
[54:10] after he died a horrible car accident
[54:13] it didn't make sense at all and people
[54:15] were saying what do we do now
[54:17] he left no instruction on the on the uh
[54:19] on what the church
[54:20] should do after he passed away speaking
[54:23] of brother branham
[54:24] he left no instruction on okay now this
[54:26] is what happens this guy needs to start
[54:28] this church
[54:29] brother perry needs to go here but the
[54:30] biscuit needs to go there you need to
[54:31] have all these different guys doing this
[54:33] he left no instruction everybody just
[54:35] went home
[54:37] they didn't know what was to happen but
[54:40] then they began to get into the word
[54:42] then they began to go back into what he
[54:44] actually said and he said
[54:45] now was what what did he actually say
[54:47] then you begin to see the books come out
[54:49] and people got the word
[54:50] and they began to get in the word it was
[54:51] an exact fulfillment of revelations 10
[54:54] 8-11
[54:55] where john took the book and it became a
[54:57] part of him in other words
[54:58] they caught the vision they were around
[55:00] it and they saw it and very few of them
[55:02] actually
[55:02] understood the impact of what was
[55:04] happening until they caught the vision
[55:07] and that's when god fulfilled his own
[55:09] word and filled them with the revelation
[55:11] of the hour
[55:12] and then it spread around to the rest of
[55:13] the world
[55:15] i imagine the people around jesus christ
[55:17] may have experienced
[55:18] the same type of feeling what on earth
[55:21] is going on
[55:24] this this was supposed to be the man
[55:25] that was going to lead us out of out of
[55:27] roman captivity or this was the man that
[55:29] was supposed to
[55:30] lead us into the very heavens it's it's
[55:32] themselves it's itself
[55:34] and he's he's dying like this
[55:41] i i can't imagine what it would have
[55:42] been like to have been able to say
[55:45] from the people that were there uh i saw
[55:49] the actual blood of jesus christ on that
[55:51] cross
[55:52] i actually saw the actual blood of jesus
[55:55] christ run red
[56:00] 1939 and they passed and reviled him
[56:02] wagging their heads and saying
[56:04] that thou destroys the temple and build
[56:06] us it up in three days save thyself if
[56:08] thou be the son of god
[56:09] come down from the cross likewise also
[56:12] the chief priests mocking him
[56:13] with the scribes and the elders and they
[56:15] said he saved others and himself he
[56:17] cannot save
[56:18] and if he be the king of israel then let
[56:19] him now come down from the cross
[56:21] and we will believe him and he trusted
[56:23] in god and let him deliver him now and
[56:25] he
[56:26] they made an open mockery of him
[56:31] and now in the sixth hour verse 45 there
[56:33] was a darkness over all the land
[56:35] unto the ninth hour and in the ninth
[56:37] hour jesus cried with a loud voice
[56:38] saying
[56:40] lama suboxone that is to say my god my
[56:43] god why hast thou
[56:44] forsaken me brother branham said in 1959
[56:48] he said living dying buried rising
[56:50] and coming he said but because he died
[56:53] of grief he he because
[56:57] he came to his own and his own received
[56:59] him not
[57:00] he died of a broken heart and when he
[57:03] knowed
[57:04] the very creatures of time that that he
[57:07] would die to redeem
[57:08] had spit on his face and he was rejected
[57:11] of man
[57:12] i think brother branham said that about
[57:14] someone else that had said that
[57:16] he died of a broken heart
[57:20] verse 51 and behold the veil of the
[57:22] temple was rent and twain
[57:24] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[57:25] did quake and the rocks rent
[57:28] in the temple the earthquake that
[57:30] happened as a result
[57:31] of the crucifixion it had ripped the
[57:34] veil
[57:35] in the temple from the top to the bottom
[57:37] so no man did that ripping
[57:39] god ripped it because it was from the
[57:40] top to the bottom in 1961 in abraham's
[57:43] grace covenant he says
[57:44] and now that was uh he's saying i'm
[57:47] going to take the covenant like this
[57:48] abraham and he took the
[57:50] the abraham and showed him what he was
[57:52] going to do with jesus christ the seed
[57:54] of abraham caused
[57:55] through abraham come isaac and isaac
[57:57] come christ and through christ
[58:00] the supreme sacrifice was made and all
[58:02] these others was natural seed
[58:04] israel israel israel israel but through
[58:06] christ open the
[58:08] veil to either jew or gentile greek bond
[58:11] or free
[58:11] male or female and that we all might
[58:14] enter into the shekinah glory
[58:16] which was only for jews alone but now
[58:18] it's for whosoever will
[58:20] let him come in first peter 3 18 it says
[58:24] for
[58:24] christ who also hath suffered for sins
[58:26] but
[58:27] just for the unjust that he might bring
[58:30] us to god
[58:31] being put to death in the flesh but
[58:34] being quickened in the spirit
[58:41] i i was sitting there in my office and i
[58:44] began to ask
[58:45] uh just as i was reading this and i was
[58:46] just in tears and i i
[58:51] the the question always comes
[58:54] why why did he have to do this
[58:58] and i i believe that we know that um
[59:02] and you don't have to turn there but
[59:03] john chapter 12 and verse 24 it says
[59:05] very very i say
[59:07] unto you except a corn of wheat fall
[59:09] into the ground and die
[59:11] it abideth alone but if it die it
[59:13] bringeth forth much fruit
[59:14] and i think a part of you may ask
[59:18] whether it impacts you greatly or even a
[59:20] little bit of
[59:21] of what happened when he was bruised for
[59:24] our iniquity and when he was crucified
[59:27] however much it moves you there's a part
[59:29] of you that may ask
[59:30] why did this have to happen it doesn't
[59:32] make sense to us
[59:34] why did it why didn't he just freely
[59:36] give it to us why didn't he just
[59:38] freely redeem us why why why didn't he
[59:40] uh
[59:41] just just totally do away with sin and
[59:44] and
[59:44] and death why didn't he just totally do
[59:46] away with it why why this process
[59:48] and then john except a corn of wheat
[59:51] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[59:52] alone
[59:53] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[59:55] fruit now
[59:56] we know that with within the message uh
[59:59] we know that there is
[1:00:00] the law of reproduction we know that
[1:00:03] very well
[1:00:04] and we're very familiar with it uh how
[1:00:07] every seed can bring forth of its own
[1:00:08] kind
[1:00:09] so we know that if if you put an apple
[1:00:11] seed in the ground the law of
[1:00:12] reproduction says
[1:00:14] you will get apples if you put this in
[1:00:17] the ground if you put corn
[1:00:18] you'll get corn the law of reproduction
[1:00:20] is is alive and well
[1:00:21] but uh it's the other part of that
[1:00:24] overriding
[1:00:25] the law of reproduction is the law of
[1:00:28] life and death
[1:00:30] so overriding the the law of
[1:00:32] reproduction
[1:00:33] is the law of life and death because in
[1:00:36] the reproduction of the plant
[1:00:37] there is life but there is also death
[1:00:41] so for the law of reproduction to work
[1:00:43] there must be overriding at the law
[1:00:45] of life and death in 1960 um in the five
[1:00:48] identifi
[1:00:49] identifications of the true church of
[1:00:50] living god he says the first
[1:00:52] thing he created was angels to worship
[1:00:55] him
[1:00:56] then he becomes god so isaiah 14
[1:01:00] describes how lucifer in his heart was
[1:01:02] conceived to exalt himself above the
[1:01:04] throne of god
[1:01:05] and and gets down from the realm of
[1:01:07] heaven and
[1:01:08] and so god separated the light from the
[1:01:10] darkness and we see that in
[1:01:12] in genesis there was there was light and
[1:01:14] the light was separated from darkness
[1:01:16] in 1955 and i will restore he says now
[1:01:19] the book of genesis is the beginning the
[1:01:21] very word genesis
[1:01:23] means the beginning now everything began
[1:01:25] in genesis evil began in genesis
[1:01:27] good began in genesis life began in
[1:01:29] genesis and death
[1:01:31] began in genesis what i find is that
[1:01:34] people
[1:01:34] acknowledge that there is life you
[1:01:37] acknowledge that there is life that the
[1:01:38] life of god
[1:01:39] the presence of god is is among us here
[1:01:42] uh uh uh
[1:01:43] in in his life and we understand that uh
[1:01:46] uh that there is life
[1:01:47] in them but oftentimes we understand uh
[1:01:50] um
[1:01:50] the the fact that without death
[1:01:54] that life could not be there
[1:01:57] because life comes only through death
[1:02:02] in uh genesis god creates man and the
[1:02:04] places him in the garden and puts the
[1:02:06] law in place
[1:02:07] the law of life and death the death is a
[1:02:09] consequence of of of breaking
[1:02:11] the word so we're he's there in the
[1:02:13] garden of eden and eve was nowhere
[1:02:16] present
[1:02:16] when he placed the law of life and death
[1:02:18] and order
[1:02:19] and i find that interesting that that
[1:02:21] eve wasn't there um
[1:02:23] uh uh there was no uh if if um
[1:02:26] uh she was not present in bodily form if
[1:02:29] you will
[1:02:30] when god set the the law of life and
[1:02:32] death in order
[1:02:33] death wasn't a concept that was foreign
[1:02:35] to god where where
[1:02:37] one day the woman pulled from the man's
[1:02:39] side messed everything up that's not how
[1:02:41] it happened
[1:02:42] death was a concept to god before there
[1:02:45] ever was a man before there was a woman
[1:02:48] god had in his mind that there would be
[1:02:52] death because he placed in the word this
[1:02:54] is the tree of life
[1:02:55] this is the tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:56] and evil he said to eat thereof is death
[1:02:59] and to eat this is life and eve was not
[1:03:02] present when he said that
[1:03:03] so the overriding the law of
[1:03:05] reproduction is the
[1:03:06] is the law of life and death in 1965
[1:03:09] god's chosen place of worship
[1:03:10] and that's just what god has two
[1:03:12] different laws and one of them is the
[1:03:14] law of death
[1:03:15] and the other one is the law of life god
[1:03:17] has two laws follow him and serve and
[1:03:19] worship him his life
[1:03:20] to reject him is death god has two laws
[1:03:27] 1962 from that time there was a time
[1:03:29] when
[1:03:30] there was no death on the earth there
[1:03:32] was a time when man didn't have to die
[1:03:35] but because eve reasoned listen to
[1:03:37] satan's reasons against god's word
[1:03:40] death began to reign from that time on
[1:03:43] and we know that the blood of the lamb
[1:03:45] which was slain
[1:03:46] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:03:49] world
[1:03:49] so god had his in mind the idea
[1:03:53] of a slain lamb he had the idea of death
[1:03:56] before there ever was the foundation of
[1:03:58] the world itself
[1:04:00] death was not a foreign concept to god
[1:04:03] it was not something that came in
[1:04:04] and messed the plan of life in order to
[1:04:07] receive life
[1:04:08] god placed in order the law of life and
[1:04:10] death
[1:04:13] life can only come from death
[1:04:17] it was under a conditional basis you
[1:04:19] cannot eat thereof
[1:04:20] and death came through the woman life
[1:04:23] comes from the male
[1:04:25] life comes from christ he is the author
[1:04:27] of life and when satan rejected god and
[1:04:29] wanted to be
[1:04:30] like him and and separated uh
[1:04:33] separated death was was separated from
[1:04:35] life but there was death created there
[1:04:37] was life there was the original seed
[1:04:39] there was the word a thought expressed
[1:04:42] and yet all of the attributes were in
[1:04:44] the mind of god
[1:04:46] and there was the lamb slain so when
[1:04:48] there was god when the word
[1:04:51] was there in the beginning with god in
[1:04:53] the word was god
[1:04:54] there was also the slain lamb
[1:04:59] now we take in 1959 a bomb in gilead and
[1:05:01] i want you to listen close to this
[1:05:03] now we take a grain of corn and put it
[1:05:05] on in in the ground
[1:05:06] and it may be a pretty grain of corn
[1:05:10] all polished up looks real nice but as
[1:05:12] long as it remains in that condition
[1:05:15] that's all it'll ever be so you can have
[1:05:18] a seed
[1:05:18] you can have an apple seed you can have
[1:05:20] a grain of corn you can have whatever
[1:05:22] you want
[1:05:23] and it's beautiful and it's nice and you
[1:05:24] can polish it but as long as it remains
[1:05:27] in that
[1:05:27] form that's all it will ever be
[1:05:31] and so we find then because the the lamb
[1:05:35] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:05:36] world
[1:05:37] there was more for there to come from
[1:05:39] the word from the seed
[1:05:40] than just to be the word there was more
[1:05:44] to it
[1:05:44] than just to be god in himself alone as
[1:05:47] the word
[1:05:48] he says now sometimes we join church and
[1:05:51] a lot of pretty things in it and maybe
[1:05:52] so forth and maybe we tried to
[1:05:54] um uh do pretty ourself up and go to
[1:05:57] church and got to know something or
[1:05:59] another
[1:05:59] to wear to church and is that all church
[1:06:02] means to you
[1:06:02] then i'm persuaded that you need a new
[1:06:04] birth it's exactly right that grain of
[1:06:06] corn will never produce any new
[1:06:08] life until the old grain rots away from
[1:06:12] it
[1:06:13] now the important concept to understand
[1:06:15] is that
[1:06:16] in the scripture we see that if a grain
[1:06:18] of corn
[1:06:19] abides alone and it goes into the ground
[1:06:21] and dies
[1:06:22] then it will bring forth much fruit but
[1:06:24] if you plant that grain of corn into the
[1:06:26] ground
[1:06:27] and you you you see that we are a seed
[1:06:30] word
[1:06:30] bride so don't lose the analogy here
[1:06:34] so you see the seed going to the ground
[1:06:36] if you take that piece of uh
[1:06:38] seed and you go back a few months later
[1:06:40] when the stalk is there
[1:06:41] and you pull it out of the ground and
[1:06:43] you look for the seed the seed is gone
[1:06:46] there is no more seed what it did is it
[1:06:49] produced
[1:06:50] something else and what you have to
[1:06:53] understand is that death
[1:06:55] is not to die it is merely a
[1:06:58] transformation
[1:07:00] to die is not death it is merely a
[1:07:03] transformation
[1:07:04] so if you go back and try to find the
[1:07:06] seed it's changed its form
[1:07:08] it's not there anymore so if
[1:07:12] a corn of wheat goes in a corn a corn of
[1:07:15] corn
[1:07:15] goes down into the ground and abides
[1:07:17] alone
[1:07:18] it dies but b but through
[1:07:21] death comes life and this was a concept
[1:07:25] that was in god's mind
[1:07:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:28] because the lamb was slain
[1:07:30] then and so if you pull the the seed up
[1:07:33] then and you look at it
[1:07:34] and you see more corn on top it died and
[1:07:37] it produced more fruit
[1:07:38] what it did is it didn't just remain its
[1:07:40] form that in that sense
[1:07:42] it moved up into the plant the very life
[1:07:45] that was on the inside of the seed
[1:07:47] changed its form it rotted off the core
[1:07:50] of the seed and it moved up into the
[1:07:52] plant
[1:07:53] and now the seed is gone it's no more
[1:07:55] the seed now
[1:07:56] it's the fruit in which it produced so
[1:07:59] the very concept of life
[1:08:01] is it cannot exist without there being
[1:08:04] death
[1:08:04] death is a means of transformation
[1:08:08] in order for you to have the same
[1:08:10] resurrection power
[1:08:11] that jesus had on the cross he had to go
[1:08:14] into the ground and die
[1:08:16] he had to receive the sins of those who
[1:08:18] he was dying for
[1:08:20] so that you could revive in newness of
[1:08:22] life
[1:08:25] when the new birth comes in it cannot
[1:08:27] come until there's a death
[1:08:29] first and people don't want to die i
[1:08:31] believe it was in um
[1:08:33] a perfect um strength in perfect
[1:08:36] weakness
[1:08:37] sermon i believe that was a sermon when
[1:08:39] he said what we need is a good
[1:08:40] old-fashioned dying out
[1:08:43] he says now in this sermon bomb and
[1:08:45] gilead he says now people don't want to
[1:08:47] die they don't want the simple leadings
[1:08:49] of the holy spirit
[1:08:51] and sometimes i think we can fight
[1:08:53] against the simple leadings of the holy
[1:08:55] spirit
[1:08:56] without even realizing it
[1:08:59] people don't want to die but but there
[1:09:02] cannot be life until death first
[1:09:04] they want to take their own thinking of
[1:09:06] it and you can't take your own
[1:09:08] your thoughts you got to think his
[1:09:10] thoughts let the mind of god of christ
[1:09:12] be in you
[1:09:12] amen and then when it's in you as far as
[1:09:15] the world concerned
[1:09:16] it'll bring new life and it'll bring
[1:09:18] resurrecting life
[1:09:21] it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a
[1:09:23] new person it'll bring a new faith
[1:09:25] it'll bring you from death unto life
[1:09:29] now there is no condemnation to those
[1:09:30] that are in christ jesus they have
[1:09:32] passed
[1:09:33] from death unto life so in the cross of
[1:09:37] jesus christ and i believe i said this
[1:09:39] the last time i was here but i just want
[1:09:40] to go over it again briefly if
[1:09:42] if um we see in in first corinthians
[1:09:45] chapter 15
[1:09:47] that christ was clearly the second adam
[1:09:50] and we see that if the first adam if if
[1:09:52] the wife was taken from adam's side
[1:09:55] then in the second atom he she would
[1:09:58] also have to be taken from his side
[1:10:00] and so that's how we know that we are as
[1:10:02] it says in ephesians chapter 5
[1:10:04] i am flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:10:06] bone and if we were there
[1:10:08] in the beginning with god as it says we
[1:10:11] were if the lamb was slain before the
[1:10:13] foundation of the world
[1:10:14] then he had the idea of the cross in his
[1:10:16] mind
[1:10:17] before there ever was a foundation of
[1:10:19] the world before there ever was a person
[1:10:21] because the law of life and death
[1:10:23] overrides the law of reproduction
[1:10:25] and so he had this concept of death but
[1:10:27] he had this concept of life
[1:10:29] coming from death it wasn't just the
[1:10:32] word it was to produce
[1:10:33] more word it was to produce a bride for
[1:10:36] his son
[1:10:37] and so in the first adam there was eve
[1:10:39] in the second adam there was
[1:10:40] also an eve but when we were cr
[1:10:44] when when the word was in the beginning
[1:10:45] the word was with god and the word was
[1:10:47] made flesh and it dwelt among us
[1:10:49] then it was he in the beginning we were
[1:10:52] in christ because we were flesh of his
[1:10:54] flesh and bone of his bone
[1:10:55] how many of you believe that you are
[1:10:57] flesh of his flesh and born of his bone
[1:10:59] you were there in the beginning with god
[1:11:01] because you were in the mind of god then
[1:11:03] you were in the mind of god because you
[1:11:05] are an attribute of god
[1:11:07] that portion of your soul that's in you
[1:11:09] that is eternal it was with god in the
[1:11:11] very beginning
[1:11:12] before there was a foundation of the
[1:11:13] world
[1:11:15] so you were there with him he was the
[1:11:17] word he was with god he was god
[1:11:19] and then he comes and it the the word
[1:11:21] was made flesh and it dwelt among us
[1:11:24] and so now the word is living among us
[1:11:26] and it dwells inside of us
[1:11:28] now jesus christ the person of jesus in
[1:11:30] nazareth he was there on the cross
[1:11:33] and if he was there paul in galatians 2
[1:11:37] 20 he says i was crucified
[1:11:39] with christ paul was not crucified with
[1:11:42] christ in the natural
[1:11:44] so how could he say i was crucified with
[1:11:47] christ
[1:11:47] nevertheless it is not me who lives it
[1:11:50] is christ who lives in me
[1:11:52] so if he could say i was crucified with
[1:11:54] christ then that means that he must have
[1:11:56] still been in christ
[1:11:58] and if the first eve was taken from
[1:12:01] adam's side
[1:12:02] and to be flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:12:05] his bone
[1:12:06] then that means that the second eve must
[1:12:08] still have been
[1:12:09] inside of christ when he was on the
[1:12:12] cross
[1:12:13] so that means that you as the word were
[1:12:16] still
[1:12:16] in christ when he was on the on the
[1:12:18] cross so that means that when he died
[1:12:21] and when he took unto himself death when
[1:12:24] he took them to himself
[1:12:26] your sins and your iniquities and your
[1:12:28] wrongs
[1:12:29] and your depression and your anxiety and
[1:12:32] all of the things that you struggle with
[1:12:33] as human beings
[1:12:35] when he was still on the cross you were
[1:12:38] inside of him
[1:12:39] you were in him there and then he sent
[1:12:43] his holy ghost back
[1:12:44] to as as the ages rolled on and as
[1:12:47] people pop
[1:12:48] up they they receive the word and
[1:12:50] they're anointed of the holy ghost
[1:12:51] and that seed that eternal seed they
[1:12:54] become the seed word bride
[1:12:56] by understanding the revealed word of
[1:12:57] the hour walking in the light
[1:12:59] and they receive the holy ghost and then
[1:13:01] they are made alive in christ
[1:13:03] they step into that stream of eternity
[1:13:06] they step back into that stream of
[1:13:08] eternity
[1:13:10] so christ was there in the beginning he
[1:13:12] was the word and then he was on the
[1:13:14] cross
[1:13:14] he was still male and female on the
[1:13:17] cross
[1:13:18] god hasn't taken that that female
[1:13:20] portion out of him yet
[1:13:21] and then he dies and he goes into the
[1:13:23] ground and the reason that we have
[1:13:26] a death is to produce life because to
[1:13:29] die
[1:13:30] is not death and so he raises again
[1:13:33] and when he raises again we rose with
[1:13:36] him
[1:13:37] and that is how paul could say i am no
[1:13:39] longer i am i am crucified with christ
[1:13:42] i was there in him on the cross and now
[1:13:45] it's no longer me who lives it's christ
[1:13:47] who lives in me
[1:13:50] nevertheless we live you don't dig the
[1:13:53] plant up and see the seed
[1:13:54] the seed grows up into itself and it
[1:13:57] produces fruit
[1:13:58] and you see the fruit you are the fruit
[1:14:03] you are what christ produced as a result
[1:14:05] of going into the ground
[1:14:07] and dying and producing life so the very
[1:14:10] reason that we can
[1:14:11] say it is it is uh this is the same
[1:14:14] power that raised up christ from the
[1:14:16] dead
[1:14:16] also dwells in your mortal bodies and it
[1:14:19] will raise your mortal bodies
[1:14:21] the reason we can say that is because we
[1:14:23] were in the mind of christ
[1:14:24] before the foundation of the world and
[1:14:27] then when he was on the cross
[1:14:28] you were on the cross with him and then
[1:14:31] he pulled the bride out of himself
[1:14:33] the second eve then you have the
[1:14:36] consequent
[1:14:37] uh seven church ages life
[1:14:41] christ died and we died to ourselves
[1:14:45] to change into the likeness of the seed
[1:14:46] that's in there
[1:14:48] god did this to express himself that's
[1:14:51] why he put the law of death and order
[1:14:53] before eve was even in the picture is
[1:14:55] because he had the intention
[1:14:56] of producing life in you when we think
[1:15:00] about the cross when we think about the
[1:15:03] passion of the christ
[1:15:05] i pray that it moves you but it's not
[1:15:09] the end of the story
[1:15:11] it's not the end of the story and as he
[1:15:14] was there
[1:15:15] i i don't believe that god i don't i
[1:15:18] don't think
[1:15:18] the angel moved the stone to let god out
[1:15:21] i think he removed the stone to let us
[1:15:23] in
[1:15:25] and so we we get in and he's not there
[1:15:28] and he comes back and he and he says uh
[1:15:30] um
[1:15:32] uh uh uh he comes back just just to say
[1:15:35] it simply
[1:15:35] he comes back in revelations 1 18 he
[1:15:37] says uh in revelation 1 18
[1:15:39] i am he who lives and was dead
[1:15:43] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:15:47] amen and i have the keys
[1:15:50] of hades and of death
[1:15:54] only through death comes life jesus as a
[1:15:57] result of his death he crossed jordan's
[1:15:59] river
[1:16:00] and then he comes back across jordan's
[1:16:02] river because of my
[1:16:03] inability to save myself
[1:16:07] sin was a tone for healing was atoned
[1:16:10] for
[1:16:10] 1965 in the easter seal but the enemy
[1:16:13] says he is the judge
[1:16:14] and we are the witnesses that he's
[1:16:16] redeemed us and in
[1:16:17] us lays by the grace of god today
[1:16:21] that resurrecting power
[1:16:26] romans 6 4 he says therefore we are
[1:16:28] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:16:31] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:16:33] the dead and the glory of the father
[1:16:36] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:16:38] of life
[1:16:40] colossians 2 he says he made a show of
[1:16:43] the enemies of the principalities and
[1:16:44] the powers of this world openly
[1:16:46] triumphing over it
[1:16:54] i don't i don't think any of us in this
[1:16:56] room will ever understand
[1:16:59] how someone could love us so much to do
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:03] i just don't think we will i think
[1:17:05] fathers have a greater grasp of it
[1:17:07] in in in the thought of actually uh as
[1:17:10] abraham did in type
[1:17:12] uh of of actually having to sacrifice is
[1:17:16] his son and being will and having the
[1:17:18] willingness to obey
[1:17:20] the word because the obedience to the
[1:17:21] word requires great sacrifice
[1:17:25] i don't think any of us will ever really
[1:17:26] truly understand what that meant
[1:17:30] but you know i i believe this with all
[1:17:33] of my heart
[1:17:35] i believe that he's the same yesterday
[1:17:37] today
[1:17:39] and forever and i believe as human
[1:17:43] beings
[1:17:44] we all struggle um many are the
[1:17:47] afflictions of the righteous
[1:17:49] we go through many different trials and
[1:17:51] in situations we go through many
[1:17:52] different
[1:17:53] mental issues health issues we're not
[1:17:56] exempt from that we're not exempt from
[1:17:58] corona
[1:18:01] we live in this world we're not of it
[1:18:05] but i want you to grasp the reality of
[1:18:08] this
[1:18:09] that he who raised jesus christ from the
[1:18:11] dead
[1:18:12] man who endured all of that and died
[1:18:16] and rose again the same power that rose
[1:18:20] him from the dead
[1:18:21] it's inside of you
[1:18:26] and you think you're sitting there and
[1:18:27] you think i believe that brother steve
[1:18:29] i don't understand it i can't fully
[1:18:31] grasp it but i believe it
[1:18:33] and then you're thinking in me really
[1:18:38] the same power that raised jesus christ
[1:18:41] from the dead
[1:18:42] it dwells in you today this is not a
[1:18:45] tomorrow thing
[1:18:47] this is not next week it's right now
[1:18:52] for healing for deliverance
[1:18:56] from the things that you struggle with
[1:19:00] life can only come through death
[1:19:03] and he he died so that we could have
[1:19:07] life
[1:19:08] this morning so in the face of that
[1:19:12] and in that revelation as as jesus said
[1:19:14] to peter
[1:19:15] upon this rock i will build my church
[1:19:16] upon the revelation of who he is
[1:19:18] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:19:21] that revelation
[1:19:23] and and the new birth simply put by
[1:19:26] brother banham
[1:19:26] was the revelation of who jesus christ
[1:19:28] is to you personally
[1:19:30] and so to to look back in the
[1:19:32] remembrance of the cross
[1:19:33] lays the mystery of your future and to
[1:19:36] to remember that
[1:19:37] and to think about that and just just to
[1:19:39] read the scripture
[1:19:40] whether it impacts you greatly or not
[1:19:42] just to just to read that scripture
[1:19:45] and to know he did that because of me
[1:19:48] he did that for me and i am here because
[1:19:51] of him
[1:19:53] and now sitting in your seats today is
[1:19:56] the same
[1:19:57] resurrecting power and keep in mind
[1:20:01] that the word it cannot return unto unto
[1:20:04] god void in other words it won't
[1:20:07] accomplish what it was set out to
[1:20:08] accomplish
[1:20:10] it it we it won't uh it won't not
[1:20:13] accomplish that which he was set out to
[1:20:14] accomplish
[1:20:15] it won't um uh not achieve that which
[1:20:18] god intended for it to
[1:20:20] achieve in you it can't do it
[1:20:23] it's impossible and so you're sitting
[1:20:26] there and you're thinking
[1:20:27] but i've got this and i've got this and
[1:20:30] i'm dealing with this
[1:20:31] and i'm struggling with this well
[1:20:33] welcome to laodicea
[1:20:35] hello did you expect any different
[1:20:38] what did you expect did you expect an
[1:20:40] easy life laying on a bed of ease
[1:20:43] 2020 has proved you wrong
[1:20:48] and so we think about all the different
[1:20:49] things that we have oh by the grace of
[1:20:51] god we have those things
[1:20:52] so that god can overcome them in me so
[1:20:55] that he can prove himself alive
[1:20:57] in me so therefore i glory in my
[1:20:59] infirmities
[1:21:01] therefore whatever you're dealing with
[1:21:03] all throughout the room
[1:21:04] which it could be vastly different one
[1:21:06] from another could be very serious it
[1:21:07] could be health it could be mental
[1:21:09] whatever it is vastly different one from
[1:21:11] another therefore
[1:21:12] glory in your infirmities because in
[1:21:15] your weakness
[1:21:16] he is made strong it's because he
[1:21:19] already paid the price
[1:21:20] for your sins for your weakness for your
[1:21:22] inequalities
[1:21:24] that you can say i'm the redeemed
[1:21:27] you can sit here today and claim the
[1:21:30] authority of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:32] as his elected of god because he paid
[1:21:34] the price
[1:21:35] because life has come as a result of
[1:21:38] death
[1:21:40] you have risen in newness of life and
[1:21:42] therefore
[1:21:43] because he paid the penalty of death
[1:21:45] because life can only come
[1:21:47] from death because he paid the penalty
[1:21:50] of death
[1:21:52] you have only life before you
[1:21:56] you have only life before you whether or
[1:21:58] not you experience death in the natural
[1:22:00] remember to death to die is not death
[1:22:03] so whether you die in the natural it is
[1:22:05] not death because
[1:22:07] christ paid the penalty of death for you
[1:22:10] so now all you have in front of you
[1:22:13] is life
[1:22:16] you are an invincible army
[1:22:21] you say brother steve i don't know what
[1:22:22] the will of god is for me
[1:22:24] you've got it this is the will of god
[1:22:27] for you
[1:22:28] the decisions that you make who you
[1:22:30] marry those are those are
[1:22:32] just stepping stones in the process of
[1:22:34] accomplishing his will
[1:22:36] concerning you so many young people they
[1:22:39] worry about wow you know
[1:22:40] where do i go to school what do i what
[1:22:42] do i learn what do i do for a job
[1:22:43] just relax i believe brother lonnie was
[1:22:47] the one that said the key to the
[1:22:48] spiritual is to relax
[1:22:50] just relax this is the will of god
[1:22:52] concerning you
[1:22:54] the decisions that you make the the
[1:22:56] scripture we were talking the other
[1:22:57] yesterday the scriptures of of of a good
[1:22:59] man are ordered by the lord
[1:23:01] the footsteps of a righteous man are
[1:23:02] ordered by the lord in other words you
[1:23:04] may not know
[1:23:05] the decision that you need to make
[1:23:06] exactly you may not have an exact word
[1:23:08] from the lord
[1:23:09] it takes footsteps in order to be
[1:23:10] ordered by the lord
[1:23:12] so just just put your foot up and say
[1:23:14] lord where do you want me to put it
[1:23:16] where do you want me to place it you
[1:23:17] have all the power of heaven
[1:23:19] behind you which is he only acts in
[1:23:22] accordance to his word
[1:23:24] so don't abuse that he only acts in
[1:23:26] accordance to his word so don't say well
[1:23:28] the lord told me to do this and then
[1:23:29] it's totally off the word
[1:23:31] come on now
[1:23:34] but on the basis of the word which is
[1:23:36] what the holy spirit acts upon
[1:23:38] you have all the power of heaven behind
[1:23:41] you
[1:23:42] so therefore if you struggle with
[1:23:44] something
[1:23:45] if you have need of of healing if you're
[1:23:48] worried about something
[1:23:50] he is more than able
[1:23:54] you have been made more than conquerors
[1:23:58] because he paid the penalty of death
[1:24:00] which life can only come through death
[1:24:04] you everybody in this room
[1:24:07] you only have life before you
[1:24:11] you've passed from death unto life may
[1:24:16] we never
[1:24:17] trivialize the cross
[1:24:21] would you buy your heads musicians would
[1:24:23] come for the ben the chad
[1:24:27] brother ben if you would sing maybe a
[1:24:28] song or two and lead us in worship
[1:24:31] i want to pray with you
[1:24:37] gracious heavenly father
[1:24:44] god forbid we boast in anything
[1:24:48] or anyone
[1:24:52] save the cross of jesus christ
[1:24:58] lord may we know may we be stirred up as
[1:25:01] peter said in the remembrance
[1:25:04] may we be stirred up in us the reality
[1:25:07] of who we are
[1:25:08] in you
[1:25:11] it's a revelation of who you who we are
[1:25:14] in you
[1:25:15] in the person of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:16] lord
[1:25:18] lord and you we we can be we can really
[1:25:22] be changed we
[1:25:26] we can really overcome there's power
[1:25:30] behind the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:32] and you said you'd be in the midst of us
[1:25:34] when we gather in your name
[1:25:35] and we believe that you are here we know
[1:25:37] that you're here lord
[1:25:43] and lord i i pray
[1:25:47] for the people in front of me as brother
[1:25:50] nathan saying i pray for my family
[1:25:55] lord that we would know the full measure
[1:25:57] of the power
[1:25:59] of the cross
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:03] lord it's it's with the the eyesight of
[1:26:08] an eagle
[1:26:09] we can look back across the pages of
[1:26:11] history and we can see
[1:26:13] lord we are the elect of god we we
[1:26:17] are the bride of jesus christ but it's
[1:26:19] only
[1:26:20] through the cross it's only through your
[1:26:24] death
[1:26:25] that we can say that we have life today
[1:26:28] but lord may we not just be hearers of
[1:26:30] it but may we
[1:26:32] be doers may you help us to do
[1:26:37] and myself and i'm sure many can say the
[1:26:40] same lord
[1:26:41] and i think so many times we just failed
[1:26:44] to do
[1:26:46] we think oh you know i've got to do this
[1:26:49] and i've got to do this but
[1:26:50] but it's not that it's in resting in the
[1:26:52] power of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:54] it's in yielding to the word of god
[1:26:57] lord it's in surrendering
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:03] lord may we fully surrender everything
[1:27:06] to you
[1:27:06] maybe there's someone who hasn't done
[1:27:08] that yet lord
[1:27:10] today is the day may it not be tomorrow
[1:27:14] may not be next week may i overcome may
[1:27:16] you help me to overcome today
[1:27:18] and tomorrow is going to be another
[1:27:19] battle for itself
[1:27:21] but i'll deal with tomorrow tomorrow
[1:27:23] today i want to surrender myself
[1:27:25] entirely to you i want to know the power
[1:27:28] of the resurrection
[1:27:29] in my life in my daily walk with the
[1:27:32] lord
[1:27:33] i want to be able to overcome the enemy
[1:27:36] that sets itself before me
[1:27:39] i want to know the reality of the power
[1:27:43] of the resurrection
[1:27:45] lord would you grant it today would you
[1:27:47] move through our hearts lord
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:55] lord we're all on equal grounds before
[1:27:57] the cross
[1:27:59] for that i'm thankful
[1:28:02] i think everyone in this room could say
[1:28:03] we're probably the lowest
[1:28:06] lord we're all on equal grounds the lord
[1:28:08] together
[1:28:09] may we say as the bride of jesus christ
[1:28:13] lord if it weren't for the cross where
[1:28:15] would we be
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] move in our hearts lord move in our
[1:28:19] minds bring both our mind and our hearts
[1:28:22] subject to the word of god
[1:28:25] granted father that you'd speak to us
[1:28:28] just in the stillness and the beauty
[1:28:30] of your presence
[1:28:35] and in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:36] do we pray
[1:28:38] do we ask these things and do we say
[1:28:41] thank you
[1:28:44] amen and amen i wonder if you'd stand
[1:28:47] for the ban won't you come and sing
[1:28:51] in the cross
[1:28:58] in the cross
[1:29:03] be my
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:22] shall find your rest
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:44] in the crosstalk
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:04] my
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:18] r
[1:30:23] praise the lord amen may it never become
[1:30:27] common to us
[1:30:29] as our brother said i enjoyed so much
[1:30:32] the reflection the reminder
[1:30:35] of what god has done for us but the
[1:30:37] present tense
[1:30:38] impact that i have has on us today
[1:30:42] it wasn't a reminder for reminder sake
[1:30:44] it was a reminder
[1:30:45] to refresh in us the reality of what
[1:30:47] today is
[1:30:49] what was purchased for us what was
[1:30:50] accomplished at calvary
[1:30:52] is being manifest out today
[1:30:55] it's a living reality of what god has
[1:30:57] done for us
[1:31:00] so many things that were impacting me
[1:31:02] all over again as he began to speak is
[1:31:05] the crucifixion displays the cost of sin
[1:31:09] the required punishment for failing the
[1:31:12] word
[1:31:14] and jesus took the required punishment
[1:31:16] the wrath of god was poured out upon him
[1:31:19] because man had rejected the word of god
[1:31:22] and we
[1:31:23] had rejected the word of god we had
[1:31:26] failed on the word and
[1:31:27] so he took my place the crucifixion
[1:31:31] displays the cost of sin
[1:31:33] but at the same time it displays the
[1:31:36] value
[1:31:37] of god's elect because the value of
[1:31:40] something is the price you're willing to
[1:31:42] pay for it
[1:31:44] and what was the price that god was
[1:31:46] willing to pay for his lost children
[1:31:49] his own death on calvary sort of
[1:31:52] two things it displays the cost the
[1:31:55] grievance
[1:31:56] that must be paid for in sin but also
[1:31:59] the value that god esteems on you and i
[1:32:02] that the blood of his only begotten son
[1:32:05] would be shed in exchange for the
[1:32:07] purchase price of my soul
[1:32:10] that makes us more than just the dirt
[1:32:12] that we dwell in
[1:32:14] but it makes us purchase dirt something
[1:32:17] of great value to god
[1:32:20] and i was reflecting on the statement
[1:32:21] brother brenham said that tree of life
[1:32:23] was cut down
[1:32:25] out of the tree of life would come the
[1:32:26] bride tree and the bride tree fully
[1:32:29] matured would be the tree of life
[1:32:30] restored back to him again
[1:32:32] the seed that went in the ground would
[1:32:34] grow back to become the bride tree and
[1:32:36] the bride true would be the tree of life
[1:32:38] restored back again
[1:32:40] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:32:44] another thing he said is the
[1:32:45] resurrection power is in us now
[1:32:48] if the resurrection power the same the
[1:32:51] same spirit dwell in us that dwell in
[1:32:53] christ that raised him from the dead
[1:32:55] it'll quicken your mortal bodies and
[1:32:57] brother branham did not make that a
[1:32:58] future tense
[1:33:00] scripture he made that a present tense
[1:33:01] scripture
[1:33:03] he said it'll quicken your mortal body
[1:33:05] he said it's already begun you used to
[1:33:07] smoke you used to drink you used to lie
[1:33:09] you used to lust
[1:33:10] what was that that changed all of that
[1:33:13] it wasn't your willpower was the
[1:33:14] quickening power of god
[1:33:17] the same spirit that raised him from the
[1:33:19] dead is the same spirit that raised us
[1:33:21] out of dead denominationalism and false
[1:33:23] understanding of the word
[1:33:24] and all kinds of infractions and
[1:33:26] penalties in the sin
[1:33:27] and the flesh so if he's already done it
[1:33:32] and he's already done it in us
[1:33:35] then the change in the body is a
[1:33:37] foregone conclusion
[1:33:39] because he changed me from a life of sin
[1:33:41] to a life that serves him
[1:33:43] he changed me from habits i couldn't
[1:33:45] overcome with willpower
[1:33:46] he took away sinful desires he quickened
[1:33:49] me out of dark denominationalism it gave
[1:33:51] me eyes to see
[1:33:52] amen the body change is a foregone
[1:33:54] conclusion i'm not worried about the
[1:33:56] body change
[1:33:57] it's already changing
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:01] that's what calvary has produced for us
[1:34:05] it's a sure thing it's not a guess
[1:34:08] it's not a hope it's faith it's
[1:34:11] something that's already been
[1:34:12] accomplished
[1:34:13] it's something that's already working
[1:34:15] i'm not worried about what will work
[1:34:17] i'm looking at what's working and what's
[1:34:20] working will produce everything
[1:34:23] i appreciate brother steve his wife
[1:34:25] being here
[1:34:26] i want to say god bless him god bless
[1:34:29] him for taking the time
[1:34:31] to remind us of what's been done for us
[1:34:34] and what it's producing now and what it
[1:34:37] will produce in the future
[1:34:40] let's pray for our brother that god will
[1:34:42] bless him
[1:34:44] amen let's just bow our heads and praise
[1:34:47] we're dismissed
[1:34:51] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:34:55] for god when we were unable you did for
[1:34:58] us what we could not do for ourselves
[1:35:02] lord you foresaw lord all these things
[1:35:05] and knew what they would be
[1:35:06] and you had a conclusion already in your
[1:35:09] mind it was an accomplished work before
[1:35:10] it was ever acted out
[1:35:13] god in the acting out in the display of
[1:35:15] what was in your mind we saw how
[1:35:17] horrible sin really is
[1:35:19] when we saw what a horrible death our
[1:35:22] savior died
[1:35:24] we can look and we can realize the cost
[1:35:27] of sin
[1:35:28] the price that had to be paid displayed
[1:35:31] how horrible sin is
[1:35:34] but also god that you would stop at
[1:35:36] nothing
[1:35:37] to redeem back your chosen ones that you
[1:35:40] wouldn't leave us lost lord that you
[1:35:42] wouldn't leave us in a fallen condition
[1:35:44] but you intended lord to raise us up for
[1:35:47] your glory
[1:35:49] god i pray that the reality of that
[1:35:51] would be a living reality in our
[1:35:53] everyday life
[1:35:54] that this flesh would be taking on the
[1:35:56] reality of that quickening power that's
[1:35:58] within us
[1:36:00] that would change us into the likeness
[1:36:03] of jesus christ from glory unto glory
[1:36:06] day by day lord decision by decision may
[1:36:09] that spirit working in us
[1:36:11] keep quickening these bodies until the
[1:36:13] last final quickening changes these
[1:36:15] atoms
[1:36:16] for we believe it lord we see it we're
[1:36:18] realizing it
[1:36:19] it's going on all through us well thank
[1:36:22] you
[1:36:23] all we can say is thank you lord
[1:36:26] we appreciate it we're grateful lord
[1:36:30] we're so blessed lord by what we've been
[1:36:32] reminded
[1:36:33] man may we never forget it lord or take
[1:36:36] it for granted but always with deep
[1:36:37] appreciation in our hearts look to
[1:36:39] calvary lord with a
[1:36:41] with a warmth inside knowing that you
[1:36:43] paid the price and we are redeemed
[1:36:45] and the work is finished and i can rest
[1:36:47] in that
[1:36:49] and may you today lord with your
[1:36:51] quickening power that's in your bride
[1:36:53] may you finish the portion of the work
[1:36:54] that you left to do in and through your
[1:36:56] bride
[1:36:57] and may you do it now through me lord
[1:36:59] through my brothers and sisters by the
[1:37:01] quickening power
[1:37:02] may you bring every spiritual reality to
[1:37:04] light in our flesh
[1:37:07] may you have that great victory that you
[1:37:09] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:37:12] when the final victory death
[1:37:15] is put under your feet when these bodies
[1:37:18] change born
[1:37:20] while we ask that you would bless us as
[1:37:22] we go from here
[1:37:24] as my family and i part and separate
[1:37:26] lord it's always difficult for me to
[1:37:28] leave the assembly even for a vacation
