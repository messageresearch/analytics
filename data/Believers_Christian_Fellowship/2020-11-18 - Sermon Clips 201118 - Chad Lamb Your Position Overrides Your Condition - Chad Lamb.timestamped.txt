[0:00] the only place to have joy the only
[0:02] place to have victory
[0:03] the only place to overcome is in the
[0:05] secret of the tabernacle
[0:07] because out there are enemies that want
[0:09] to eat his flesh out there there are
[0:10] foes that are gathered around
[0:12] out there is every force that would try
[0:14] to destroy him but the place of
[0:15] rejoicing the place of joy
[0:17] amen the place of security the place of
[0:19] safety is
[0:21] in the pavilion in the secret of the
[0:22] tabernacle up upon the rock
[0:24] and that is our position friends and our
[0:27] position in this rapture cycle
[0:29] transcends our condition
[0:32] our position amen is overriding our
[0:36] condition
[0:37] because it doesn't matter what condition
[0:38] we're in you can be sick you can
[0:40] you can have complications you can have
[0:42] distresses you can have work pressures
[0:45] but your position overrides your
[0:47] condition your conditions should never
[0:49] override your position
[0:51] you can see because there's been a place
[0:53] provided for us because there's been a
[0:55] rock that has been revealed to us in
[0:57] this day
[0:58] the revelation of jesus christ christ
[1:00] the mystery of god revealed
[1:02] opened amen as the seals were open now
[1:04] there's a place
[1:05] up on a rock up above our enemies where
[1:07] our head can be lifted up
[1:09] and then we can go into the pavilion of
[1:11] the lord and through the chambers of the
[1:12] lord into the secret chamber of the lord
[1:15] to the secret place of the tabernacle
[1:18] and in there we have joy and there we
[1:19] have rejoicing and there we have
[1:21] shouting
[1:21] and there we have security and there we
[1:23] have peace and there
[1:26] we're feasting with the lamb feasting on
[1:29] the lamb
[1:30] eating the manna that has been preserved
[1:36] seated with christ jesus in heavenly
[1:38] places but i want to tell you
[1:41] in this day that's the only place to be
[1:45] everywhere else amen will bring distress
[1:47] amen we'll bring stress
[1:49] amen we'll bring depression we'll bring
[1:51] anxiety we'll bring fear
[1:58] i say if god has provided us a place
[2:01] in this rapture cycle then it behooves
[2:05] us to stay in that place
[2:09] and the whole goal of the enemy is to
[2:11] get us to look outside
[2:14] and the war now the struggle is just to
[2:17] stay in the place that's provided
