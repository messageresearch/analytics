TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we can make a statement I believe everything that he said really what you're doing is just admitting that he is the authority and that's fine like that's step number one we got to get past that a lot of people haven't but just saying I believe everything that he said recognizing him as the authority and not knowing what he said to apply it to your life does that really do you any good there's going to be a lot of people on Judgment Day not arguing who the Authority for this age was Satan's going to be right there with them Satan knows God sent a prophet Satan knows who the Authority for this age was is that the promised word for the hour then I'm not trying to be dogmatic on it but I've just seen it for too many years this message is Christ he bled and died for this message if he bled and died for this message which did he feel was more important amen right so why would we be ashamed to say that we've come past the penalty that was paid he's the one himself who said that's more important I'm going to lay my life down for it right would it not be an insult to him to just say we're going to stay here we're going to stay here and preach the penalty's been paid the penalty's been paid the P's been paid and you know what that's equivalent to that's equivalent to going to the pawn shop giving the GU the $100 for whatever it is you pawned and then been like see you later that's right the price has been paid you've still got to take it you've got to claim it which was more important the $100 or the item that you gave the $100 for that's right this is the same principle and I've got the prophet to back it up he says not Calvary was the most Sublime portion of scripture but Revelation 55 was the most Sublime portion of scripture why because he knew the principle the price has been paid but if you don't take that which you've paid for why pay the price for it right why leave it in the pawn shop
