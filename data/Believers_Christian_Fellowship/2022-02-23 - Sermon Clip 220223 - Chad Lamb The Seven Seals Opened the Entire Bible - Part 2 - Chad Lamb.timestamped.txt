[0:00] something not my flesh my flesh is
[0:03] rotten you know this is one of the
[0:04] problems we run into when we start
[0:06] talking about the bride is the
[0:07] expression of christ people start to
[0:09] look to flesh and they say you make a
[0:11] mistake and you do something wrong
[0:13] that's not the part i'm talking about
[0:14] i'm talking about something down in the
[0:16] soul amen that seed gene of god that
[0:18] expresses the word of god amen and so
[0:20] when you see me if you see me make a
[0:22] mistake and you see me do something
[0:24] contrary to the word i just want to tell
[0:26] you right now amen that's not god that's
[0:28] me
[0:30] that's my old hybrid flesh amen as my
[0:33] old nature raising up that's not god
[0:35] that's me
[0:37] but when you see an expression of christ
[0:39] come through me amen and it matches the
[0:41] word it surrenders to the word and
[0:42] expresses i want you to know that's not
[0:44] me that's him
[0:48] see we have a hard time separating the
[0:50] outer man from the inner man the hybrid
[0:53] part from the sea gene of god and if we
[0:55] could just do that we would realize so
[0:57] much of what we struggle with is the
[0:59] outer man and the outer man is going to
[1:01] crumble to pieces one day be dead or be
[1:04] changed amen this is not the part that
[1:06] we're worried about it's the part down
[1:08] on inside that came from god god will
[1:10] refashion the outside amen so that he
[1:13] can live in a full expression on the
[1:14] inside
[1:16] but that's where the confusion comes in
[1:18] you know how can i be the manifestation
[1:20] of christ and i just i mean i talked
[1:23] hateful with my wife yesterday that's
[1:25] not the manifestation of christ that's
[1:26] you in your hybrid form
[1:29] but when you surrender and humble
[1:31] yourself amen and the holy ghost moves
[1:33] you back and you surrender and you make
[1:34] things right that's not you that's god
[1:36] in you
[1:39] when you surrender to this word when you
[1:40] hear the prophet straighten out the
[1:42] scriptures and you say that's right when
[1:44] he straightens out the doctrine and you
[1:45] ditch your ideas and you say that's
[1:46] nothing but the truth that wasn't you
[1:48] that was him
[1:51] if we recognize that
[1:53] a lot of the manipulation that the enemy
[1:56] tries the tactics he tries on us will
[1:57] begin to go away and say listen
[2:00] i know i messed up that's not god's
[2:03] faultless mind
[2:06] i know i failed to manifest christ today
[2:08] that wasn't his fault that's mine
[2:10] but there's something in me that's going
[2:12] to come back and say i'm sorry god amen
[2:15] i'll give myself to you and i'll lay
[2:16] myself at your feet and take me and do
[2:19] your will with me and manifest yourself
[2:21] through me and let this word live in me
[2:23] that's him that's the seed that's rising
[2:26] up and saying it's got to be him and not
[2:28] me
