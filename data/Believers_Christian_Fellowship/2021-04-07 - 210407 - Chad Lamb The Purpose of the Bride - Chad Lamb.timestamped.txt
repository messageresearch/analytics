[7:15] praise the lord god bless you friends
[7:17] this evening
[7:18] and then while we're standing let's take
[7:20] our bibles and go to genesis chapter one
[7:24] i hope you don't ever get tired of me
[7:25] turning to genesis chapter one
[7:28] amen but praise god it's just the way it
[7:31] is
[7:33] so we want to follow the leading of the
[7:34] lord and
[7:36] look here at genesis chapter 1 and verse
[7:39] 26
[7:40] we've read this a lot through our lives
[7:42] and we've read it a lot of
[7:44] late and we may read it a lot more as we
[7:46] continue on
[7:47] but we'll start here genesis 1 26 and
[7:50] god said let us make man in our image
[7:53] after our likeness and let them have
[7:56] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[7:57] over the fowl of the air
[7:59] and over the cattle and over all the
[8:00] earth and over every creeping thing that
[8:02] creepeth
[8:03] upon the earth and god created
[8:06] man oh thank you brother
[8:09] i'm just gonna share
[8:13] so god created man in his own image and
[8:15] the image of god created he him
[8:17] male and female created he them and god
[8:20] blessed him and god said unto them
[8:22] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[8:25] the earth and subdue it
[8:26] and have dominion over the fish of the
[8:28] sea and over the foul of the air
[8:30] and over every living thing that moveth
[8:32] upon the earth
[8:34] let's pray lord jesus we ask that you
[8:37] would bless
[8:38] this reading of your word lord and lord
[8:40] we pray god to be more than just the
[8:42] ability to read but
[8:44] may you do more than that for us now
[8:46] lord may you break it down by revelation
[8:49] may we absorb it lord by revelation
[8:51] may we become one with this word and may
[8:53] it be in us
[8:55] living and breathing and moving through
[8:57] us lord
[8:58] we surrender ourselves to you we pray
[9:00] that you would come and break the bread
[9:01] of life this evening for us that
[9:03] we might feed from your hand lord jesus
[9:06] we ask it in jesus name
[9:08] amen you can be seated
[9:11] and i want to begin with a quote
[9:16] here this evening and i quoted part of
[9:18] this at the end of the service on
[9:21] sunday and i just want to spend a little
[9:23] more time in it
[9:25] because it's i find it amazing but it's
[9:26] out of the pergamian church age from the
[9:28] church age book
[9:29] and it's the section that's uh in
[9:31] italics there because
[9:33] it's where brother branham was told by
[9:34] the angel lord to pick up his pen and
[9:36] write
[9:37] and he began to write and so it's
[9:39] italicized there in the church age book
[9:41] and that's where i'm going to begin
[9:42] right at the beginning of that and just
[9:43] read a portion of that
[9:45] he begins he says here's what i'm trying
[9:47] to say to you the law of reproduction is
[9:50] that each species brings forth after its
[9:52] own kind
[9:53] amen this is a this is an important
[9:55] foundation that we want to get a hold of
[9:58] that each specie brings forth of its own
[10:00] kind
[10:01] even according to genesis 1 11 and god
[10:04] said let the earth bring forth grass
[10:06] in the herbing seed and the fruit tree
[10:08] yielding fruit after its kind
[10:10] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[10:12] and it was so
[10:14] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[10:16] into a plant
[10:17] and thence into fruit the very same law
[10:20] applies to the church today
[10:22] whatever seed started the church will
[10:23] come forth and be like the original seed
[10:26] because because it is the same seed
[10:30] in these last days the true bride church
[10:32] christ's seed
[10:33] will come to the headstone and she will
[10:36] be the superchurch
[10:37] a super race as she nears him they and
[10:39] the bride will be so much like him
[10:41] that they will even be in his very image
[10:44] this is in order to be united
[10:46] with them they will be one they will be
[10:49] the very manifestation of the word of
[10:51] the living god
[10:52] denominations can never produce this
[10:54] wrong seed
[10:55] so you put in parentheses wrong seed
[10:57] that's the reason they can never produce
[10:59] this they have the wrong seed
[11:02] because each species brings forth after
[11:04] its kind
[11:06] so the denominational seed must always
[11:08] produce a denominational life
[11:10] but it has to be christ's seed and
[11:12] christ's seed produces christ
[11:16] the denominations cannot produce produce
[11:18] this wrong seed
[11:19] they will produce their creeds and their
[11:21] dongas mixed with the word
[11:23] this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[11:26] product
[11:27] now now i want to get into this a little
[11:29] deeper pay close attention here the
[11:31] first son
[11:32] adam was the spoken seed word of god
[11:36] he was given a bride to reproduce
[11:38] himself
[11:40] that is why the bride was given to him
[11:42] to reproduce himself
[11:45] so i took out of this a a text for
[11:48] tonight
[11:49] and for a title i want to say the
[11:51] purpose of the bride that's our title
[11:53] tonight the purpose of the bride and i'm
[11:55] taking it from
[11:56] this quote here and i'm going to read
[11:58] this again
[11:59] the first son adam was the spoken seed
[12:01] word of god
[12:02] he was given a bride to reproduce
[12:05] himself
[12:06] that is why the bride was given to him
[12:09] to reproduce
[12:10] himself to produce another son of god
[12:14] but she fell she fell by hybridization
[12:17] she caused him to die i think this thing
[12:21] this is amazing
[12:22] amen because because the word alone has
[12:26] life
[12:26] and believes the word brings death
[12:28] anything outside the word brings death
[12:30] the word alone brings life the word
[12:32] alone
[12:33] is life so we understand that concept
[12:36] so now when she left the word amen when
[12:40] she went with reasoning and wisdom
[12:42] contrary to the word of god now her act
[12:44] was going to bring
[12:45] death amen but adam was going
[12:48] to redeem her redeem his wife amen and
[12:52] redeeming his wife he would have to
[12:54] leave the word
[12:55] amen and when he left the word it caused
[12:57] him to die
[13:00] it caused him to die amen
[13:04] now says the second son jesus also a
[13:07] spoken seed word of god
[13:08] was given a bride like as was adam but
[13:11] before he could marry her she
[13:13] also had fallen she like adam's wife was
[13:16] put to the test whether she would
[13:17] believe the word of god and live
[13:18] or doubt the word and die she doubted
[13:21] she left the word
[13:22] she died okay now we go all the way back
[13:26] to god's original purpose and god's
[13:28] original intent
[13:30] amen adam was given a bride to reproduce
[13:33] himself
[13:34] amen and so we see a concept with god
[13:37] that god is going to take male and
[13:39] female and male and female together will
[13:41] reproduce
[13:42] life it's a concept that's a law of god
[13:45] every seed will bring forth after its
[13:47] own kind but when when adam was going to
[13:49] bring forth after his own kind
[13:51] he was given a wife and that wife was
[13:53] going to be given to him to reproduce
[13:55] himself
[13:55] but instead of waiting on the word amen
[13:58] she went without the word she went by
[14:00] reasoning and wisdom
[14:01] and by reasoning and wisdom she brought
[14:04] death
[14:04] not life and so
[14:08] so it caused adam to fall she caused
[14:11] adam to die amen but then god
[14:15] restored adam amen in the last adam
[14:18] which we know is jesus christ
[14:19] and the bible refers to him as the last
[14:21] adam because there's no more
[14:23] need for another atom after him we don't
[14:27] need another adam he is the last adam
[14:29] because he is the son of god amen he was
[14:32] god reproduced himself in flesh the body
[14:35] that he created and dwelt in as the son
[14:37] of god
[14:38] and he lived the perfect life he kept
[14:40] all the law he never was disobedient to
[14:42] the father
[14:42] amen and god had restored back adam
[14:45] amen and restoring back adam now he came
[14:49] in full obedience to the word not
[14:51] leaving the word not leaving one eye out
[14:53] of the word
[14:54] this adam didn't leave the word to
[14:56] redeem his wife this adam stayed with
[14:59] the word and
[15:00] gave his life and death voluntarily to
[15:03] redeem
[15:03] his wife and then the god raised him up
[15:07] they met on the third day
[15:09] and now he can die no more because
[15:12] he kept the word to redeem his wife he
[15:14] didn't leave the word to redeem his wife
[15:17] it makes sense so he kept the word amen
[15:19] and gave his life to redeem his wife
[15:21] amen and he cannot die but when she left
[15:24] the word
[15:26] she doubted she left the word she died
[15:31] we still could not bring forth the full
[15:33] purpose of god
[15:35] because she died so when she caused
[15:38] adam to die we couldn't bring forth the
[15:41] purpose of god
[15:42] amen so now he had to restore adam when
[15:44] he restored adam
[15:46] he gave adam back another bride but that
[15:48] bride left the word
[15:50] she fell she died so now it's
[15:53] the the plan of god is still needing one
[15:56] male
[15:57] and one female amen it still needs the
[16:00] male
[16:00] and the female of the same specie
[16:05] because this cannot be hybridization
[16:07] amen so god's purpose god's plan
[16:10] would still require amen a son and the
[16:12] son's bride
[16:14] amen to come together to reproduce amen
[16:17] another son of god to reproduce the life
[16:20] of the son again upon earth
[16:23] and so god now he cannot leave it in
[16:26] that condition he has to restore
[16:29] because he's got to bring it back to his
[16:30] original intent his original perp
[16:32] his original plan and when he told them
[16:35] be fruitful
[16:36] multiply and replenish the earth amen
[16:38] now he's got to bring forth of his word
[16:40] and it failed the first time and now he
[16:43] restored adam
[16:44] now adam's bride now the one that was
[16:46] was given to him as a restored last adam
[16:49] jesus christ
[16:50] bride she fell amen and she died but god
[16:53] began to build back amen
[16:55] to bring back another bride because
[16:57] there's got to be a bride that will
[17:00] finish the purpose
[17:04] then he goes on to say here in this pick
[17:06] up your pen and right section
[17:09] from a little group of the true seed of
[17:11] the word see it has to come from the
[17:13] true seed of the word
[17:14] because there can be no hybridization
[17:19] so it's got to be of the same seed same
[17:22] word
[17:23] same specie
[17:26] from a little group of the true seed of
[17:28] the word god will present christ with
[17:30] the beloved bride
[17:31] you see why a denomination a church
[17:33] system can
[17:34] never accomplish this amen because
[17:36] they've already been hybridized they've
[17:38] already been brought forth on the wrong
[17:40] scene
[17:41] amen it can only be when god brings back
[17:44] a
[17:44] virgin bride amen and how is she virgin
[17:47] she's virgin by the word
[17:49] because there came a word in this day
[17:51] amen with such
[17:52] life and such power that the word in
[17:55] this day
[17:56] would break every barrier of
[17:57] denominationalism every barrier of
[18:00] hybridization amen
[18:01] and pierced down to the genuine original
[18:04] seed that's down on the inside of the
[18:06] children of god
[18:07] and would pierce all the way down and
[18:10] awaken that seed and that seed is virgin
[18:12] amen
[18:13] and when that seed wakes up and comes to
[18:16] life it takes the pure word for the day
[18:18] to depart the waters of confusion amen
[18:21] to part away
[18:22] all denomination and all creeds and all
[18:24] dogmas but it takes that bright light in
[18:26] this last day
[18:27] to move it all away amen to strike the
[18:30] original seed that's down in the soul
[18:33] and bring it to life and when it does
[18:35] that's a
[18:36] virgin born again new creation of christ
[18:39] jesus
[18:40] virgin bride never did it in the first
[18:43] place you were trapped into it
[18:45] of no fault of your own amen god is
[18:48] going beyond the mind beyond the flesh
[18:50] beyond the human spirit all the way down
[18:52] to the seed
[18:53] with the word that can bring that seed
[18:55] to life in this thing
[18:57] so that he can present him his his last
[19:01] adam so he can present his last adam
[19:04] with the bride
[19:05] to fulfill the purpose
[19:10] aren't you glad you have the message
[19:12] inside aren't you glad you're alive in
[19:14] this day
[19:16] man there's chaos breaking out all
[19:19] around but i'm glad i'm here today
[19:21] i'm glad many prophets and wise men have
[19:25] longed to see your day amen and have not
[19:27] i tell you there's many all the way down
[19:29] through the church ages that long to see
[19:31] this day
[19:32] to understand amen there was men who
[19:34] poured over their bible
[19:36] and then poured over the writings of the
[19:38] fathers to try to understand this great
[19:40] mystery of god
[19:41] amen but to us it's been freely given
[19:44] amen what a day that we live in friends
[19:49] from a little group of the true seed of
[19:51] the word god will present christ with a
[19:53] beloved bride
[19:55] i want to ask you a question who's
[19:58] presenting whom to who
[20:02] he doesn't say there's finally going to
[20:05] come a group
[20:06] of people who get their act together he
[20:09] didn't say there's finally
[20:10] after all denominations finally the
[20:12] people will wake up and realize the
[20:14] nominations failed and they'll get their
[20:15] act together they'll come back to the
[20:17] word
[20:17] no god amen he's going to take from the
[20:20] true seed of the word
[20:22] he's going to take god is going to
[20:24] present him son of bride
[20:26] this is god's doing this is god's work
[20:28] that's why you can't
[20:29] it won't fail friends it can't fail it's
[20:33] prophesied in this day not to fail
[20:36] from a little group of the true seed of
[20:38] the word god will present christ with a
[20:39] beloved bride
[20:41] she is virgin of his word she is virgin
[20:45] because she knows no man made creeds or
[20:47] dogmas
[20:48] by and through the members of the bride
[20:50] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[20:52] of god to be made manifest
[20:54] in the virgin the word of promise came
[20:57] to the virgin mary
[20:59] but the word of promise was he himself
[21:03] to be made manifest so
[21:06] the word came to mary mary wasn't
[21:08] looking for the word
[21:12] the word came to mary and she received
[21:15] the
[21:16] word and the life of that word came into
[21:19] mary and produced its own life
[21:22] and lived its own life in her and came
[21:24] through her
[21:26] it wasn't what mary did mary had nothing
[21:29] to do with it it was what mary
[21:30] surrendered herself to
[21:33] what she accepted what she believed what
[21:35] she received by faith
[21:36] that's all that mary could do but the
[21:37] word came to mary amen
[21:39] it was in a form of the promise and the
[21:41] promise was he
[21:42] himself to be made manifest in the
[21:45] virgin
[21:51] god was made manifest he himself
[21:54] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[21:57] word of promise
[21:58] in the virgin it was an angel that had
[22:00] brought her the message but the angel's
[22:02] message was the word of god
[22:04] isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time
[22:07] all that was written of him because she
[22:10] accepted
[22:11] his word to her
[22:14] it still takes a female
[22:18] it still takes a female brother brethren
[22:21] said in the restoration of the bride
[22:22] tree
[22:23] he said but what he was god's perfect
[22:25] prophet tree the example tree the
[22:27] bridegroom tree
[22:28] amen glory going to say something
[22:30] directly he is the bridegroom tree do
[22:32] you believe it
[22:33] from the garden of eden then the
[22:35] bridegroom tree
[22:36] without the female don't bear fruit so
[22:39] he's
[22:40] got to have a bride tree
[22:44] amen god said it all the way up in the
[22:46] beginning in the shadow
[22:48] he couldn't do it by himself when he was
[22:50] alone he's got to have a bride tree to
[22:53] bring forth amen
[22:54] and so the the bridegroom tree without
[22:56] the female don't bear fruit so he's got
[22:58] to have a bride tree
[23:00] she has got to be born of the same
[23:01] material the word
[23:03] made flesh in the tree hope you get it
[23:06] it's the same life in the female tree
[23:08] the bridegroom as it is in the bride the
[23:10] works that i do
[23:11] shall you also praise be to god
[23:16] so there's still there still has to be
[23:19] amen a female there still has to be a
[23:21] virgin that can be presented
[23:23] unto the sun and to the last adam so
[23:25] that so that that bride can be given to
[23:28] him so that he can reproduce himself
[23:31] and and you know when it came to the
[23:34] virgin mary which
[23:35] now he's typing this in this section in
[23:38] the pergamus church age
[23:39] when it came to mary amen mary didn't
[23:42] have to
[23:43] strain and she didn't have to strive and
[23:45] she didn't have to be wise and she
[23:47] didn't have to be educated and she
[23:49] didn't have to pour over the manuscripts
[23:51] amen to get to this place all she had to
[23:54] do was receive what the angel was
[23:56] telling her
[23:56] and she amen she had to accept it she
[23:59] had to believe it
[24:00] she had to receive it amen
[24:04] and that's all that he needs for us to
[24:06] do in this day is just surrender to it
[24:08] amen
[24:09] just accept what what he's telling her
[24:11] the word is coming
[24:13] to the bride the bride just needs to
[24:14] accept it he accomplished all that he
[24:17] promised in that day
[24:18] because she accepted the word
[24:23] let's turn to isaiah together i want to
[24:26] read a couple places here in the
[24:27] scripture
[24:28] isaiah 53.
[24:36] isaiah 53
[24:40] and verse 4.
[24:45] and isaiah 53 and verse 4 says surely he
[24:48] hath borne our griefs
[24:50] and carry our sorrows yet we did esteem
[24:52] him stricken smitten of god
[24:54] and afflicted but he was wounded for our
[24:56] transgression he was bruised for our
[24:58] iniquity and the chastisement of our
[25:00] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[25:03] we are healed all we like sheep have
[25:06] gone astray
[25:07] we have turned everyone to his own way
[25:09] and the lord hath laid on him the
[25:11] iniquity
[25:12] of us all he was oppressed and he was
[25:15] afflicted
[25:16] yet he opened not his mouth he has
[25:18] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[25:20] as a sheep before he shares his dumb so
[25:21] he opened not his mouth
[25:23] he was taken from the prison and from
[25:25] the judgment who shall declare his
[25:27] generation
[25:28] for he was cut off out of the land of
[25:30] the living for the transgression of my
[25:32] people
[25:33] was he stricken so the question that i
[25:36] want to leave with is this question
[25:37] that's asked here in isaiah
[25:39] uh 53 and 8 for who for
[25:42] for who shall declare his generation
[25:46] for he was cut off out of the land of
[25:48] the living
[25:51] he was cut off amen he was cut off
[25:54] before
[25:55] he could take a wife before he could
[25:57] bring forth children before he could
[25:59] bring forth his generation he was cut
[26:01] off
[26:01] he was cut off out of the land of the
[26:03] living so who will declare his
[26:05] generation
[26:07] we pick up this same scripture over in
[26:09] acts chapter
[26:10] 8. let's go to acts chapter 8.
[26:15] this is amazing this question because in
[26:18] isaiah
[26:19] when he asked a question but he doesn't
[26:21] give the answer to the question
[26:28] and let's look at acts chapter 8
[26:33] and verse 26 we'll start at verse 26.
[26:40] in the angel of the lord spaking the
[26:41] philip saying arise and go toward the
[26:43] south and to the way that goeth down
[26:45] from jerusalem
[26:46] unto gaza which is desert and he rose
[26:49] and went and behold a man of ethiopia
[26:51] a eunuch of great authority under
[26:53] candace queen of the ethiopians
[26:55] who had the charge of all her treasure
[26:57] and had come to jerusalem for the
[26:58] worship
[26:59] was returning and sitting in his chariot
[27:01] reading isaiah's the prophet
[27:04] then the spirit saith unt unto philip go
[27:07] near and join thyself to hysteria
[27:10] and philip ran thithered to him and
[27:12] heard him read the prophet isaiah and
[27:14] said understand us thou what thou
[27:15] readest
[27:16] and he said how can i except some man
[27:18] should guide me
[27:20] and he desired philip that he should
[27:21] come up and sit with him
[27:23] and the place of the scripture which he
[27:24] read was this he was led as a sheep to
[27:27] the slaughter and like a lamb
[27:28] dumb before his shearer so opened he not
[27:31] his mouth
[27:32] in his humility his judgment was taken
[27:34] away and who shall declare
[27:36] his generation for his life is taken
[27:39] from the earth
[27:41] oh boy what a good question
[27:45] who shall declare
[27:49] his generation for his life was taken
[27:51] from the earth and the eunuch answered
[27:53] philip and said i pray thee of whom
[27:54] speaketh the prophet this
[27:56] of himself or some other man then philip
[28:00] opened his mouth and began at the same
[28:02] scripture and preached unto him
[28:04] jesus amen i want to ask you who was
[28:07] there to declare his generation
[28:09] philip was there to declare his
[28:11] generation the question was
[28:13] amen who shall declare his generation
[28:16] this is the place where the eunuch was
[28:17] reading from
[28:18] amen and he was reading as the lamb led
[28:20] the slaughter and he opened not his
[28:22] mouth and
[28:22] who shall declare his general generation
[28:24] for his life was cut off from the land
[28:26] of the living
[28:27] and he asked the question who is the
[28:29] prophet speaking of
[28:30] amen because now the fulfillment of this
[28:33] prophecy
[28:34] the fulfillment of the lamb led as a
[28:36] slaughter he that
[28:37] amen he that opened not his mouth that
[28:39] fulfillment was jesus christ but he was
[28:42] cut off from the land of the living
[28:44] and now the eunuch has a question about
[28:46] who he is and what's the fulfillment and
[28:48] who is this speaking of
[28:49] amen and who's going to declare his
[28:52] generation
[28:54] that's what it ends with and philip
[28:56] beginning at the same
[28:58] scripture preached unto him jesus
[29:00] because there was somebody
[29:02] on the earth a bride amen that could
[29:04] declare his generation
[29:06] [Music]
[29:09] praise be to god brother abraham says
[29:12] and
[29:13] the spoken word is the original seed the
[29:15] eunuch
[29:16] he had been with all the dd's and ld's
[29:18] and everything but
[29:19] why didn't he get something he come back
[29:22] down studying the prophecy of isaiah
[29:24] brother man said he was up at the camp
[29:26] meeting in jerusalem amen with all
[29:28] you know the you know the theologians
[29:30] and everything and he didn't get the
[29:32] answer to his question because there's
[29:33] got to be somebody
[29:35] who can declare his generation
[29:39] he says he goes on to say the same quote
[29:43] although an angel directed philip to him
[29:46] but the germ of life had to come through
[29:49] the body
[29:50] philip oh brother now we're on the line
[29:53] where did the germ come from
[29:55] through the angel the angel showed him
[29:57] where to go
[29:58] an angel is a messenger here is a son
[30:00] philip had the germ the message
[30:02] the word that's how a child can be born
[30:08] hey amen who will declare his generation
[30:10] amen
[30:11] where who's going to continue amen where
[30:13] where's the progeny going to come from
[30:15] where's the children going to come from
[30:17] who will declare his generation philip
[30:19] was there he had the seed which was the
[30:21] message the word
[30:23] amen that's how children can be born
[30:26] because it's got to come from the body
[30:28] of christ amen
[30:30] philadelph laid his hands upon him
[30:32] philip baptized him in the name of jesus
[30:34] christ
[30:34] there come forth the spirit of god sure
[30:37] now the germ had to come from the body
[30:40] what body christ body correct and philip
[30:43] was a member of the
[30:45] body hallelujah
[30:51] two paragraphs down he says and while
[30:53] peter
[30:54] spake these words he goes right to peter
[30:56] to cornelius's house
[30:57] while peter spake these words not the
[30:59] angel not the cardinal
[31:01] well peter spake these words what he was
[31:04] the body
[31:06] he had the word the word took hold o
[31:09] brother
[31:10] oh my angel directed it but the life
[31:13] come through the body of christ
[31:17] because the man and the woman has become
[31:19] one amen
[31:20] she has his life she has his word she
[31:22] has the message
[31:23] amen and life has to come through the
[31:25] body of christ
[31:27] who shall declare his generation
[31:30] i say it can only be his bride
[31:34] she's the only one that can do it
[31:38] brother branham says in christ is the
[31:40] mystery of god revealed there's just one
[31:42] little phrase
[31:43] he said the word only has life
[31:47] the word only nothing else the word only
[31:50] has life and and christ
[31:54] or the message it is the rising of the
[31:55] sign he says notice the very message of
[31:58] the gospel
[31:59] itself is to prove to the people that he
[32:01] has risen
[32:03] go tell my disciples that i am risen
[32:05] from the dead and i will meet them to
[32:06] confirm this to them
[32:08] oh god how in the last day there shall
[32:10] be light again across the earth
[32:11] and i'll prove to my disciples go tell
[32:14] them that i'm not dead
[32:15] i'm not a tradition but i'm a living
[32:18] christ i'll meet them take this message
[32:20] to my disciples
[32:22] that i am risen from the dead the gospel
[32:25] good news you say is that right hebrews
[32:27] 13 8 said
[32:28] he's the same yesterday today and
[32:30] forever we his beneficiaries
[32:33] are to prove his life is in us now
[32:36] the beneficiaries of his life the life
[32:39] there never was a life
[32:40] lived like it he was the son of god and
[32:43] he died and that shut it out
[32:44] but when he raised again from the dead
[32:46] on easter morning then we
[32:48] as his servants are commissioned by him
[32:50] to go into all the world and to bring
[32:52] this good news to every person
[32:54] that he is living and how can we do it
[32:57] by word only if it is written the gospel
[32:59] came not in word only
[33:00] but through the power and manifestation
[33:02] of the holy spirit to prove
[33:04] that he is alive
[33:08] praise god philip had more than words he
[33:12] had the message he had the seed he had
[33:13] the germ but he had the life
[33:15] [Music]
[33:17] the word brings life the word is life he
[33:20] had the life of the word and he had the
[33:22] message of that lie
[33:23] amen and he had something that he could
[33:25] give out
[33:28] and the message the choosing of the
[33:29] bride
[33:31] so i remember one time a prophet went to
[33:35] take a king to make a king out of
[33:37] jesse's son to take another king's place
[33:40] saul and so jesse brought him out his
[33:43] great big fine boy he said the crown
[33:45] will look right on his head
[33:46] the prophet went to pour the oil on him
[33:48] he said god has refused him
[33:50] and he refused every one of them till he
[33:52] came to the little old stoop shouldered
[33:54] ready looking fellow and he poured the
[33:56] oil upon him and he said god chose him
[33:58] see
[33:58] we choose by sight god chooses by
[34:00] character
[34:02] character there never was a character
[34:05] like jesus
[34:06] christ
[34:09] i want you to think about that statement
[34:12] there never was a character like jesus
[34:16] christ
[34:18] jesus christ was the reflection of god
[34:21] he was the image of god and made
[34:23] manifest
[34:24] he was something that the world could
[34:26] look to and know what the father is
[34:30] well what the characteristics of god
[34:31] were what the attitude and approach of
[34:33] god
[34:34] they could they could look to the son
[34:35] they could look at jesus christ and the
[34:37] son was a reflection of his father
[34:41] and there never was a character like
[34:43] jesus christ
[34:45] it lives in you and manifest him we see
[34:47] it's true
[34:49] it's not worldly beauty of him that
[34:50] attracts his bride
[34:52] it's his character the character of the
[34:55] church
[34:56] that jesus looks for
[34:59] not where it's big buildings where it's
[35:00] great denomination where it's big
[35:02] membership
[35:03] he promised to meet with wherever two or
[35:05] three are gathered
[35:07] together see
[35:10] there never was a character like christ
[35:16] so christ can never have a bride
[35:20] unless there's a bride like him amen
[35:25] because brother brahma even told us he
[35:26] said a a man that'll take a wife
[35:29] shows what he's thinking of his future
[35:31] home shows what's on the inside of him
[35:34] by the wife that he chooses
[35:37] and that's why christ could not be
[35:39] united with any of these denominations
[35:41] because
[35:42] they didn't have his character his
[35:44] character was i only do that which the
[35:46] father shows me
[35:47] he did nothing outside the will of his
[35:49] father he did
[35:50] nothing unless his father first showed
[35:52] him he was a son
[35:53] in absolute perfect submission to the
[35:56] will of his father
[35:58] and he could not have a wife with any
[36:00] different character than his character
[36:03] because he cannot bring forth
[36:04] hybridization amen
[36:06] she must be of the same root amen
[36:09] she must have this she must be the same
[36:12] specie that he is
[36:15] because he cannot christ will not hybrid
[36:18] amen so he can
[36:19] only unite with what has come from the
[36:21] same source as him or as the same specie
[36:24] as him
[36:25] and he is the manifested word he can
[36:28] only unite with the manifested word
[36:30] amen but when we saw the fullness of the
[36:32] word made manifest
[36:33] it had a character to it amen it had it
[36:36] had a
[36:37] an obedience and a submission amen and a
[36:40] gentleness and a sweetness and
[36:42] a character and a zeal for the word all
[36:44] of these things that we saw in jesus
[36:46] christ was the character
[36:47] that was reflecting the father amen now
[36:50] in the sun that had been restored
[36:52] from the sun that fell all the way back
[36:54] in the garden that was restored and
[36:55] there was never a character like this
[36:57] character
[36:58] but god was going to present him a
[37:00] virgin bride amen
[37:01] and that virgin bride will be a mere
[37:04] match to him
[37:05] she must have the same character he
[37:08] cannot unite with another specie
[37:12] that's why amen
[37:16] what we do and how we act and our
[37:19] temperament
[37:19] matters friends it matters because
[37:23] christ is looking for character
[37:24] he's looking for something that will
[37:26] reflect him
[37:29] god amen god was looking for a son that
[37:33] could reflect
[37:34] him and all of them failed
[37:38] until he got to this son he was looking
[37:41] for now a wife that would reflect
[37:43] the husband but they all failed until he
[37:45] gets to this one
[37:46] amen so now by the spoken word he's
[37:49] going
[37:50] to create his own bride by spoken word
[37:54] so he's going to speak the word and
[37:56] inside of you is a receptor for that
[37:58] word
[37:59] if you're bride of jesus christ down
[38:01] inside of you has been implanted
[38:03] something
[38:04] from before the foundation of the world
[38:05] that was placed in your soul
[38:07] way back there that's been waiting amen
[38:09] for the right season for the right time
[38:11] to spring the life
[38:12] and it's a receptor for this spoken word
[38:14] in this day
[38:15] amen so that he can have a spoken word
[38:17] bride
[38:18] not a reformed bride amen not a trained
[38:21] bride
[38:22] he wants a spoken word bride
[38:25] and the only way he can have a spoken
[38:27] word bride amen
[38:29] because all of humanity was sown into
[38:31] hybridization
[38:33] how is he going to bring this back amen
[38:35] we see
[38:36] what he did with his son he actually
[38:38] sowed a life
[38:39] his life into the virgin womb of a woman
[38:42] and that
[38:42] life amen came forth an absolute
[38:45] perfection no hybridization
[38:48] but his bride now has come through the
[38:50] same way
[38:51] that all humanity has come amen we in
[38:54] our flesh
[38:55] and we weren't born amen the way jesus
[38:57] christ was born
[38:58] we were born fallen in a fallen
[39:00] condition with a fallen nature with the
[39:02] fallen spirit
[39:04] but god had implanted a portion of
[39:07] himself
[39:08] in our soul before the foundation of the
[39:10] world amen because he was going to have
[39:12] a spoken word
[39:14] bride and he knew that when he got to
[39:16] the time
[39:17] that he was going to unite christ with
[39:19] his bride that he would send the purity
[39:22] of the spoken word in our day
[39:24] without without mixture with
[39:25] denomination without hybridization
[39:28] but back to the pure original word
[39:32] and the pure original word was going to
[39:34] come and connect with that seed
[39:36] and it was going to be spoken word
[39:39] bringing spoken word life
[39:41] spoken word birth to a spoken word
[39:44] virgin bride it's the only way he can
[39:47] have a virgin bride in this day
[39:51] is he must bring a virgin word
[39:54] a pure unadulterated word
[39:58] and that pure unadulterated word when it
[40:02] goes down to the pure seed of god
[40:06] and quickens it to life he now has a
[40:09] new creature a new creature born again
[40:14] erases the first birth born again a new
[40:17] creature in christ jesus
[40:19] in the soul and that
[40:22] is a spoken word bride and she's virgin
[40:25] of his word because she was birthed by
[40:27] the virgin word
[40:29] she wasn't birthed by hybrid word she
[40:32] was birthed by the virgin word
[40:37] and being birthed by the virgin word she
[40:39] will have his characteristics
[40:43] she will have his character that
[40:45] character he had to fully submit to the
[40:47] word she'll fully submit to the lord
[40:50] no matter what she grew up in what
[40:51] chicken yard she was in or
[40:53] what denominational church she raised up
[40:54] and what idea or concept of man when she
[40:56] came in
[40:57] when she sees that word no matter how
[40:59] she was taught when the word said you
[41:00] women don't cut your hair she said
[41:02] that's it for me
[41:03] i'm not gonna cut my hair when the men
[41:05] were told dropped these filthy habits
[41:06] and dropped this they said i'll drop it
[41:08] why because she has his characteristics
[41:14] that's the bride that he's looking for
[41:17] that's the only kind he can unite with
[41:19] the one that's the same specie so
[41:21] there's now no more hybridization
[41:26] praise god i'll say like brother bear
[41:29] said now do you see the message
[41:32] now do you see the message now do you
[41:35] know what those seals were hiding now do
[41:36] you know what those seals uncovered
[41:39] what he's been doing is he's building
[41:40] back at churches he's getting it back to
[41:42] a condition
[41:43] where he can bring a spoken word birth
[41:45] and unite it back
[41:46] to his perfect sign amen so that now
[41:49] she can declare his generation and
[41:51] finish the work
[41:52] and finish the purpose amen
[41:56] and finish the plan of god
[42:01] brother ben said in the message things
[42:02] that are to be now the only way that you
[42:05] can be a son or daughter of god
[42:07] because you have to have eternal life
[42:09] and there's only one form of eternal
[42:11] life and that's god's life
[42:12] only one form of eternal life that was
[42:14] god there to be a son of god you had to
[42:16] be in him always
[42:18] the gene of your life spiritual life
[42:20] tonight was in god
[42:21] the father before there ever was
[42:25] before there was even a molecule and you
[42:27] are nothing but the manifestation of the
[42:30] gene of life that was in god as a son of
[42:32] god
[42:33] [Music]
[42:34] now you're expressed after his word has
[42:37] come
[42:38] in you to light up this age you are
[42:40] expressing
[42:41] god's life in you because you are a son
[42:45] or daughter of god therefore
[42:46] you get what i mean see you are you are
[42:49] now made you are sitting in this church
[42:51] tonight
[42:52] because your duty is to express god to
[42:54] this nation
[42:55] and this people and this neighborhood
[42:57] where you associate
[43:02] amen let's turn to colossians 1
[43:06] this is another scripture we quote all
[43:08] the time
[43:09] almost every service but i'm not going
[43:12] to apologize for it
[43:16] colossians chapter 1 verse 26
[43:20] even the mystery which had been hid from
[43:23] ages
[43:23] and from generations i hope that means
[43:27] more to you than it's ever meant just
[43:28] that terminology
[43:30] the mystery that's been hid from ages
[43:32] and generations i tell you friend
[43:33] there's been a mystery amen
[43:35] the mystery of the old testament was
[43:37] jesus christ but the mystery of the new
[43:38] testament is the bride of christ
[43:41] there's been a mystery that was
[43:42] foreshadowed all the way back in the
[43:44] garden
[43:44] and there's been a mystery all along but
[43:46] now to the bride it's not a mystery to
[43:48] the bride it's a secret and now she has
[43:50] the fellowship of the mystery
[43:54] even the mystery which has been hid from
[43:55] ages and from generations
[43:57] but now is made manifest to his saints
[44:00] to whom god would make known what is the
[44:02] riches of the glory of this mystery
[44:04] among the gentiles
[44:05] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[44:10] that's it friends this is the revelation
[44:13] of the mystery
[44:15] what is the revelation of the mystery
[44:16] christ in you
[44:19] the hope of glory
[44:23] brother ben said in christ is the
[44:24] mystery of god revealed he says
[44:26] it's god himself see it's becoming to a
[44:30] place and he's governed
[44:32] the body all the way through then the
[44:33] complete body of christ is revealed in
[44:36] the form of a bride
[44:37] catch that terminology
[44:40] the complete body of christ is revealed
[44:43] in the form of a bride
[44:45] that was taken out of his side like adam
[44:48] did at the beginning like adams was
[44:49] rather
[44:50] at the beginning so
[44:57] he says it's god himself
[45:00] see it's becoming to a place and he's
[45:03] governed the body
[45:04] all the way through he's he's been
[45:06] governing the body all the way through
[45:08] then the complete body of christ is
[45:11] revealed in the form
[45:13] of a bride that means the complete body
[45:16] of christ
[45:18] wasn't completed before when jesus
[45:20] christ was here
[45:23] but the complete body of christ is
[45:26] revealed in the form of a bride
[45:29] that was taken out of his side
[45:35] in choosing of the bride i read this
[45:36] quote last sunday but in the message the
[45:38] choosing of a bride he says the other
[45:40] is pregnanted by the word of god it will
[45:43] bring forth the body
[45:44] the finished body of jesus christ which
[45:47] is the bride
[45:50] because why because there's been a
[45:52] foreshadow laying down
[45:54] all the way in the beginning in the book
[45:56] of genesis this seventh seal was
[45:58] revealed
[46:00] it was laying there in a shadow that
[46:02] when his first son adam would come
[46:05] within adam was the components to make
[46:07] his bride
[46:08] amen his flesh and his spirit was there
[46:12] but when god looked down on it he said
[46:13] it's not good that man should dwell
[46:15] alone
[46:16] amen and god was not in the habit of
[46:18] saying his creation was not good
[46:22] and he said it's not good that some man
[46:24] shall dwell alone i will make for him a
[46:25] help meet amen
[46:27] and then he pulled out of his side a rib
[46:29] amen and brother man told us he split
[46:31] the feminist spirit from him
[46:32] and he formed the woman and he united
[46:34] two together and brother branham said in
[46:36] the crowning
[46:37] act of creation and now when god is done
[46:40] with this
[46:41] he makes the statement when he saw all
[46:42] that he had done and all that he made
[46:44] behold he said it is
[46:45] very good and after that he takes a rest
[46:52] so all the way back we begin to see
[46:56] that god was creating creating creating
[46:58] creating
[46:59] he got to the sixth day it looks like
[47:01] he's done
[47:04] he comes all the way up in this
[47:05] evolutionary style of creation brother
[47:08] branham said
[47:09] from the sea creatures and the birds and
[47:11] the frogs and works his way all the way
[47:12] up
[47:13] and finally he's got something that's
[47:15] reflecting his image and flesh
[47:17] and it's a son it's adam and he gets
[47:19] this and it looks as if he's done
[47:21] this is the mystery friends because this
[47:24] isn't the masterpiece yet
[47:26] this is part of the masterpiece but the
[47:29] masterpiece image is a masterpiece
[47:31] family amen it can't just be the first
[47:33] part
[47:34] so in god's mind he knows he's not done
[47:37] amen it looks like a climax but it's not
[47:39] a climax it's a false climax
[47:44] and it looks like he's done but he's not
[47:46] done amen and he
[47:47] puts him in dominion and then he he
[47:49] places him in dominion in the garden and
[47:52] over all he's as a god on the earth and
[47:54] it looks as if he's finally achieved
[47:57] all of his creation up to the capping
[47:58] he's done amen
[48:00] but then he says it's not good
[48:04] when he looks at his masterpiece he's
[48:05] made all the breaststrokes amen he's got
[48:08] in the setting
[48:08] he's put his son in the beautiful
[48:10] setting i mean he's worked and worked
[48:12] and worked and he finally
[48:13] he's got everything and he steps back
[48:15] and he looks and he says
[48:16] it's not good that man should dwell
[48:20] alone
[48:22] so you can see that god doesn't have
[48:25] afterthoughts you believe that
[48:29] he's not learning as he goes amen he's
[48:31] not getting to a place and say
[48:34] you know what i never even thought of
[48:36] this
[48:38] but it's not good that he's alone i
[48:40] can't believe i
[48:43] god already knew he already had his
[48:45] heart desire he already had a plan
[48:47] he already had an achievement a goal
[48:49] something he wanted to do
[48:50] and now he's showing it all the way back
[48:52] in genesis amen
[48:53] and in in in that son is a bride in that
[48:57] son
[48:58] amen is a daughter amen and he looks
[49:00] down he says it's not good that she
[49:01] dwell alone
[49:02] he hasn't come to his climax yet it only
[49:04] looks like the climax
[49:06] but the crowning act of achievement the
[49:08] climax will be when he pulls
[49:10] out of adam the female amen and brings
[49:12] the two and unites them back together as
[49:14] one
[49:15] and brother branham said that is the
[49:16] crowning act of all of creation
[49:21] and god couldn't rest until he got that
[49:27] and he cannot rest now until he finishes
[49:30] this bride amen
[49:31] until he finishes this bride amen until
[49:34] he gives the last adam the last woman
[49:36] amen
[49:37] until there's a final complete now we've
[49:39] come back
[49:40] he's got a son that reflects his
[49:42] character now that was fully submissive
[49:44] and obedient to the word
[49:45] now that son needs a bride of his same
[49:48] character
[49:49] and that bride's going to have to come
[49:50] out of him
[49:52] just like the first one it's got to be
[49:53] the same species got to come out of him
[49:55] and now this bride has got to come out
[49:57] of christ to be the bride of christ to
[49:59] be united back to him
[50:01] amen to do what to reproduce his life
[50:04] again
[50:05] and until god has finished that he
[50:07] cannot rest
[50:13] amen
[50:18] praise god
[50:21] the other is pregnant by the word of god
[50:24] he was speaking of the false church now
[50:25] that's been impregnated by the ideas of
[50:27] man
[50:28] wrong conception the other is pregnanted
[50:31] by the word of god
[50:32] and will bring forth the body the
[50:34] finished body
[50:36] of jesus christ which is his bride
[50:39] the body of christ isn't finished yet
[50:43] because until the masterpiece is fully
[50:46] restored
[50:47] it's not finished yet how many knows
[50:51] that
[50:51] a man and his woman is one and christ is
[50:53] one body the word
[50:55] the bride will have to be the rest of
[50:57] that body
[50:58] and to two together makes the one body
[51:00] again like adam was at the beginning
[51:03] man his wife are one
[51:08] what is the purpose of the bride to
[51:11] reproduce
[51:12] another son of god to reproduce himself
[51:17] again in the spoken word is the original
[51:20] seed he says that's what the matter
[51:22] today you want some kind of phony makeup
[51:24] with screaming jumping speaking in
[51:26] tongues and something instead of waiting
[51:27] for the real word of god to be manifest
[51:30] through the bride
[51:31] them kind that takes the word them kind
[51:34] that takes the word
[51:36] is god's true bride bringing forth
[51:39] children
[51:42] it's got to be by the word amen and it
[51:45] wasn't that
[51:46] it was not that eve did not want to
[51:48] bring forth children and the deception
[51:50] they meant
[51:50] eve was wanting to bring forth children
[51:52] she had a commandment to multiply and
[51:54] replenish
[51:55] but she didn't wait for the word amen
[51:58] she went by reasoning and by wisdom and
[52:00] any time amen the churches ever
[52:03] failed to wait on the word and go by
[52:06] reasoning and wisdom
[52:07] he mentions caused a failure
[52:12] but them kind that takes the word
[52:15] is god's true bride bringing forth
[52:18] children
[52:20] they can't die a child the bride brings
[52:24] forth on the word
[52:25] can't die all the denominations die
[52:29] they bring death and because only the
[52:30] word has life amen
[52:32] only the word is the seed only the word
[52:35] has life amen
[52:37] so they can't die a child the bride
[52:38] brings forth on the word can't die
[52:40] because it's the word amen did you get
[52:43] that did you get it
[52:44] she can't die the child can't die
[52:47] because he's a word child he's a seed
[52:49] child he's an
[52:50] eternal child hallelujah
[52:56] spoken word is the original seed again
[52:58] now for the birth of the word is christ
[53:01] not of polluted with denominations the
[53:03] early church no denominations just the
[53:05] word and spirit
[53:06] and spirit irrigated amen god laid the
[53:10] word down like that and the holy spirit
[53:12] irrigated it
[53:13] and there she went she brought forth
[53:15] children
[53:16] certainly so god is showing
[53:19] us that the purpose originally amen is
[53:22] to be fulfilled in this day
[53:24] to bring forth children
[53:28] in the message christ is the mystery of
[53:29] god revealed he says and remember
[53:31] we are now as his bride pregnant with
[53:34] his spirit
[53:35] oh my the church bearing children see
[53:38] impregnated by his spirit
[53:40] with his name bearing his name bearing
[53:43] his life
[53:44] bringing forth the signs of his life
[53:46] evident with the preeminence as
[53:48] evidence of his resurrection showing
[53:50] that he is not dead but alive
[53:51] forevermore
[53:52] this is eternal life and vindicated
[53:55] vindicates to the world that we are
[53:56] alive
[53:57] in him how do you know because you're a
[54:00] church member
[54:00] because christ is living through you so
[54:03] pregnant
[54:04] with his spirit that you're a prisoner
[54:06] to anything else
[54:07] you're confined oh my to the gospel
[54:09] confined to the word
[54:11] and all the children that you can bring
[54:12] forth is that because you're a prisoner
[54:16] amen if we want to bring forth the right
[54:18] kind of life if we want to bring forth
[54:20] amen who shall declare his generation
[54:23] amen when philip there with the word
[54:25] had the life had the spirit had the word
[54:28] had the message
[54:29] when god amen picked him up and told him
[54:32] to move from here and move over there
[54:34] why because life comes through the body
[54:37] and he he has got to use him
[54:39] amen to bring forth life to this you
[54:41] knocked the eunuch there's going to be
[54:44] another child born
[54:48] but he's got to be born amen by the
[54:50] message
[54:51] by the word amen it's got to come amen
[54:54] through the life has got to come through
[54:56] the body
[54:56] so he brings philip over amen philip
[54:59] begins to explain to him the question he
[55:01] has out of the scripture
[55:02] and he's now declaring his generation
[55:06] and he physically takes him and lays
[55:08] hands on him amen baptizes him in jesus
[55:10] name laid his hands on him for the
[55:11] baptism of holy ghost amen and
[55:13] immediately he's gone
[55:14] boom he disappears and he shows up miles
[55:17] away in another city
[55:20] why because another child is born amen
[55:23] that ethiopian eunuch had come to life
[55:25] now he is part of the body he is part of
[55:28] the bride
[55:28] amen he now is going to bring forth life
[55:31] and brother benham said that ethiopian
[55:33] took the
[55:34] message down to ethiopia amen and
[55:36] started a revival down there
[55:39] why how how is he going to get to
[55:42] ethiopia how is he going to start a
[55:43] revival in ethiopia amen he's got to
[55:46] have the birth of the word and a child
[55:48] and there's got to be a vessel a bride
[55:50] upon the earth that'll carry that life
[55:52] that word that seed amen and bring forth
[55:54] another child
[55:55] then that child will go start a revival
[55:58] all the way in ethiopia
[56:00] this is god's plan amen
[56:04] amen
[56:08] that's why you know the
[56:11] there's so much you know attempts at
[56:14] evangelism in the denomination world
[56:15] that has no effect
[56:17] because god's method is to be contact he
[56:20] said salt must make contact to preserve
[56:22] life
[56:23] and the life goes from one to the other
[56:26] to the other to the other
[56:29] so who who on this planet
[56:32] has life and who can bring forth the
[56:34] seed
[56:36] who can bring forth the children of god
[56:38] because when the last one comes in
[56:41] then the rapture will go
[56:49] she is impregnated with the spirit he
[56:52] says in christ the mystery god revealed
[56:56] so confined to the gospel
[56:59] nothing else no other idea just the word
[57:02] confined to the word and all the
[57:05] children that you can bring forth is
[57:06] that
[57:07] because you're a prisoner
[57:12] praise god
[57:17] the other member said in future home he
[57:19] says like
[57:20] how them blind people can't see the
[57:22] serpent seed right there
[57:24] eve was put here on the earth and before
[57:26] satan ever touched her
[57:28] or anything else god said to them
[57:30] multiply
[57:31] and replenish the earth that's right but
[57:33] satan comes in here
[57:34] and that was adam's son then adam was a
[57:37] direct descendant of god
[57:39] and you only take the nature of your
[57:41] parent
[57:43] so brother ram is showing serpentine and
[57:45] he's showing the nature of cain
[57:47] and he's showing that cain could not
[57:49] have come from adam
[57:52] because the nature of cain
[57:56] and that's why denominationalism does
[57:59] not come from christ
[58:01] because they do the same thing that cain
[58:03] did amen they
[58:04] they have will worship self-will worship
[58:06] and worship according to their own
[58:08] dictates and their own judgments and
[58:09] their own desires
[58:10] and even when presented with the truth
[58:12] amen they will not take the truth but
[58:14] they continue on in their own way
[58:17] and so when you look at that that's why
[58:19] brother branham could look and he can
[58:21] say amen
[58:22] none of these amen none of these are
[58:25] are the bride of christ
[58:28] because they don't have the same nature
[58:30] amen they don't have the nature
[58:32] that that that church that system was
[58:34] not birth of christ
[58:36] because now they take their own word
[58:37] over the word of god
[58:39] now they go and do their own thing in
[58:40] their own way amen they've got a
[58:42] different
[58:43] nature than the nature of christ because
[58:44] christ never took his own way
[58:46] he only did that which the father showed
[58:48] him so when a church
[58:50] begins to take its own way amen and make
[58:52] its own decisions and do its own thing
[58:55] amen you can show it's showing that the
[58:57] birth wasn't right there was something
[58:59] wrong with the birth
[59:00] amen and brother brenham can
[59:04] look at that and say the denominations
[59:06] have all failed all the
[59:07] all the lutherans can bring forth is
[59:09] lutherans
[59:11] and the wesleyans will bring forth
[59:13] wesleyans and the pentecostals will
[59:14] bring forth pentecostals
[59:17] but the word bride can bring forth the
[59:19] word
[59:21] because she has the word she has the
[59:23] life she can bring forth
[59:25] a replica life of jesus christ
[59:29] a child that's born of the word becomes
[59:32] a prisoner of the word
[59:33] becomes bound by the gospel amen will
[59:36] only do
[59:37] what the word says
[59:41] and the message questions and answers
[59:42] from 1962 brother says and then
[59:45] when adam's son finally was born he was
[59:48] a gentle
[59:49] sweet humble meek person like adam
[59:53] we finally got to abel and the neighbor
[59:55] was killed and then seth was his
[59:57] replacement
[59:57] and when we finally get to adam's son
[1:00:00] adam's son reflected adam's nature
[1:00:04] when you get to abel abel now was
[1:00:07] worshipping amen
[1:00:08] by revelation amen he was worshiping god
[1:00:11] according to god's desire and now adam's
[1:00:14] son is reflecting adam's nature
[1:00:16] then seth is born and when seth was born
[1:00:18] now men begin to call
[1:00:20] upon the name of the lord now seth is
[1:00:22] reflecting his father's nature
[1:00:23] but cain in that line prove amen by
[1:00:26] their conduct and by their actions and
[1:00:28] by what they do with the word
[1:00:30] proved that they didn't come from the
[1:00:32] word
[1:00:36] amen and i said god let me
[1:00:39] live so surrender to the word amen that
[1:00:42] it reflects who my daddy is amen
[1:00:45] where i came from who my husband is and
[1:00:47] every child amen that we bring forth man
[1:00:50] everybody we witness to receives the
[1:00:52] message may they have the same character
[1:00:55] of jesus christ
[1:00:56] amen not propagating selfishness not
[1:00:59] propagating pride
[1:01:00] not propagating any attributes of
[1:01:02] lucifer
[1:01:07] it becomes so dangerous because it's so
[1:01:09] subtle
[1:01:10] and it gets so mixed but i say friends
[1:01:13] we have no desire and i know you're like
[1:01:15] me
[1:01:15] we have no desire to bring forth
[1:01:18] anything but the word of god
[1:01:21] amen but we must reflect the character
[1:01:24] of christ amen
[1:01:25] and gentleness and sweetness and
[1:01:27] humility and reverence and
[1:01:29] obedience and submission amen these have
[1:01:31] to be the characteristics of the bride
[1:01:33] because if not you're going to get a
[1:01:35] hybridization somewhere
[1:01:37] because he can only bring forth when he
[1:01:39] has a bride that's the same species
[1:01:44] i say god amen let me die out the self
[1:01:47] amen and be a word bride
[1:01:49] completely bound in chains of love
[1:01:52] confined to the gospel amen and the only
[1:01:54] thing that we propagate is the word
[1:01:59] not our own desires and our own goals
[1:02:02] and our own
[1:02:03] ambitions amen that's where churches
[1:02:06] have failed denominations have failed
[1:02:08] all the way down through amen instead of
[1:02:10] propagating the word they begin
[1:02:12] propagating their ambition
[1:02:14] amen that comes all the way back from
[1:02:16] their father lucifer amen
[1:02:18] instead of moving on in the word they
[1:02:20] got ambitious amen they had a program
[1:02:23] they had an
[1:02:23] agenda they had an achievement that they
[1:02:25] wanted to achieve
[1:02:26] amen and it was absolutely wrong and
[1:02:29] instead of bringing life
[1:02:30] amen it started to bring death
[1:02:34] i said let us be the bride of jesus
[1:02:36] christ and never push an agenda
[1:02:39] never bring our own will our own desire
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:42] but to wait patiently on god so god can
[1:02:45] bring his
[1:02:46] will his desire his word and his word
[1:02:48] only
[1:02:49] so that there's anything that's brought
[1:02:51] forth from our efforts it'll bring forth
[1:02:53] another child of god
[1:02:55] born by the seed word of god reflecting
[1:02:58] back the life of that word
[1:03:02] amen okay finish this quote
[1:03:07] then when adam's son finally was born he
[1:03:09] was a gentle sweet humble meek person
[1:03:12] like adam
[1:03:14] so i wonder
[1:03:18] if if we're going to bring forth
[1:03:19] children of god
[1:03:21] what nature are they to have and if
[1:03:24] we're going to call ourselves bride of
[1:03:26] jesus christ what nature are we to have
[1:03:29] i say god reflect yourself in me lord
[1:03:34] birth by the word and the word only
[1:03:36] reflecting back the word
[1:03:38] in the word only but this fellow he's
[1:03:42] referring to cain now
[1:03:43] where did that pure lying where did that
[1:03:45] sin come from
[1:03:47] where did this fellow came that murder
[1:03:49] and the bible said that the devil is a
[1:03:51] murderer
[1:03:51] where did that lie come from the devil
[1:03:54] is the father of a lie he is a liar and
[1:03:56] the father of a lie
[1:03:57] it had to come from some resource
[1:03:59] outside of god
[1:04:01] so cain was the evil one and his father
[1:04:04] was satan
[1:04:05] and he brought forth this evil one
[1:04:10] praise god let's turn to john chapter 8.
[1:04:14] i want to finish in this portion of the
[1:04:16] scripture because it so
[1:04:18] embodies everything that we've read from
[1:04:21] the prophet what we've been talking
[1:04:23] about this evening
[1:04:25] john chapter 8 verse 38 and we know that
[1:04:28] the jews now are
[1:04:30] disputing with jesus christ
[1:04:35] in verse 38 says i speak that which i
[1:04:37] have seen with my father
[1:04:40] and you do that which you have seen with
[1:04:42] your father
[1:04:45] they answered and said unto him abraham
[1:04:46] is our father jesus saith unto them
[1:04:49] if ye were abraham's children you would
[1:04:51] do the works of abraham
[1:04:54] what a simple concept friends
[1:04:57] let's not make this complicated but
[1:04:59] let's keep it simple
[1:05:00] amen if you were abraham's children you
[1:05:02] would do the works of abraham
[1:05:04] now you know brother branham's not
[1:05:06] saying i'm not saying jesus wasn't
[1:05:08] saying
[1:05:09] that every action that they had to make
[1:05:11] amen had
[1:05:12] to be exactly correct like there's no
[1:05:14] more room for error or making a human
[1:05:16] mistake or doing that's not what we're
[1:05:17] talking about friends
[1:05:19] but we're talking about when it comes to
[1:05:20] the word and your will versus the will
[1:05:22] of the word
[1:05:23] amen there's that's where the problem
[1:05:25] lies amen
[1:05:26] when we'll manipulate the word or leave
[1:05:28] a peace out or add our own agenda or
[1:05:30] idea to it amen
[1:05:31] when we begin to do that you can tell
[1:05:33] there's a wrong influence somewhere
[1:05:35] going to bring a hybrid life out amen
[1:05:37] and if we if we manipulate the word at
[1:05:40] all soften it or change it or do
[1:05:42] anything to the word to try to bring
[1:05:44] forth children
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] if we try amen to make this message more
[1:05:51] palatable amen
[1:05:52] if we try to leave out some of the
[1:05:54] bitter places amen of the land
[1:05:56] if we try to manipulate or change or
[1:05:59] flex
[1:05:59] or or somehow mold or pretty upper make
[1:06:04] more appetizing if we do anything to
[1:06:06] this message to try to win
[1:06:07] souls we are going to reproduce the life
[1:06:10] of lucifer not the life of christ
[1:06:15] amen because the children of god
[1:06:18] are born amen when the light of the age
[1:06:21] strikes that seed it comes to life when
[1:06:23] the pure unadulterated raw
[1:06:25] amen pure virgin word strikes a virgin
[1:06:28] seed
[1:06:28] it brings forth a virgin daughter
[1:06:32] but we don't manipulate it amen we don't
[1:06:35] change it we don't uh
[1:06:36] we don't make it uh more palatable or we
[1:06:39] don't add sugar to it to get the kids to
[1:06:41] take it
[1:06:44] those things are all dangerous that's
[1:06:46] reasoning and ideas of man
[1:06:49] trying to bring forth children amen we
[1:06:52] don't want to bring forth
[1:06:54] children we want to bring forth his seed
[1:06:56] amen and i only want to bring forth his
[1:06:58] seed
[1:06:58] if that's one more for the duration of
[1:07:01] our existence on this earth that's the
[1:07:02] only one we want
[1:07:06] that sounds horrible but that's the
[1:07:08] truth
[1:07:10] jesus came to seek and to save what was
[1:07:12] lost he came to save his own
[1:07:14] he said i didn't come i don't pray for
[1:07:16] the whole world amen i didn't come for
[1:07:17] the whole world but i come to say mind
[1:07:19] that we're in the world
[1:07:21] the ministry of jesus christ was the
[1:07:23] seek and to save that which was lost his
[1:07:25] own sheep
[1:07:26] that were lost and the ministry of
[1:07:27] christ is now in the bribe
[1:07:31] paul and barnabas amen they're going in
[1:07:33] their journey and they're preaching amen
[1:07:35] and as they're preaching the jews begin
[1:07:37] to resist them and he said it was
[1:07:38] needful that the gospel be first
[1:07:40] preached to you but be seeing that you
[1:07:42] count yourself unworthy of eternal life
[1:07:45] lo we turn to the gentiles
[1:07:47] then the gentiles began to rejoice and
[1:07:50] be glad
[1:07:50] and as many as were ordained unto life
[1:07:54] believed they didn't all believe
[1:07:57] but those that were ordained to life
[1:07:59] believe amen and paul
[1:08:00] didn't have to change his gospel to get
[1:08:03] the jews to keep him in the synagogue a
[1:08:05] little bit longer so that he could win
[1:08:06] the gentiles
[1:08:10] what do you do he preached the gospel
[1:08:12] that got him rejected he preached the
[1:08:14] gospel that got him kicked out
[1:08:15] he preached the gospel that got him
[1:08:17] stoned he preached the gospel that had
[1:08:18] him hated
[1:08:19] but he preached the gospel that those
[1:08:21] who were ordained to life would believe
[1:08:25] because we're not bringing forth our own
[1:08:27] children amen the bride doesn't have her
[1:08:29] own seed
[1:08:30] she's not out there trying to find a
[1:08:32] seed so she can replicate replicate
[1:08:34] replicate
[1:08:34] he said many more are the children of
[1:08:37] the desert
[1:08:38] the desolate than of the righteous
[1:08:42] it's not about winning numbers it's not
[1:08:44] a soul-winning program that's
[1:08:46] denominationalism amen
[1:08:47] it's about finding the lost seed and you
[1:08:50] can only find it with the true word
[1:08:52] for your day amen
[1:08:57] amen this message is powerful if we
[1:09:01] leave it alone amen
[1:09:03] this message has the power to bring a
[1:09:05] new birth if we leave it alone amen
[1:09:07] but if we tamper with it all it's going
[1:09:09] to do is bring some sort of reformation
[1:09:12] amen a little bit of morality mixed in
[1:09:14] with some reformation
[1:09:15] and an understanding of scriptures
[1:09:19] and another child of the devil
[1:09:23] that sounds horrible but as soon as you
[1:09:25] begin to hybrid it it can only bring
[1:09:27] forward hybrid life
[1:09:31] it's got to be left pure it's got to be
[1:09:33] left virgin
[1:09:34] it's got to be left powerful it's good
[1:09:36] the word has got to be left alone
[1:09:38] amen the woman does not have the right
[1:09:40] to manipulate the seed
[1:09:42] all she has the right to do is receive
[1:09:43] the seed
[1:09:49] so now very simple concept he says
[1:09:53] i speak that which i've seen with my
[1:09:56] father
[1:09:57] and you do that which you have seen with
[1:09:59] your father
[1:10:01] the answer said unto him abraham is our
[1:10:03] father do you say to him if you were
[1:10:04] abraham's children you would do the
[1:10:06] works of abraham
[1:10:08] what did abraham do abraham believed on
[1:10:10] him that was sent to him
[1:10:13] he believed the word of the lord and the
[1:10:14] day that it came to him
[1:10:16] the message of his day the message of
[1:10:18] the hour abraham believed it
[1:10:22] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[1:10:25] hath told you the truth
[1:10:27] which i have heard of god this did not
[1:10:30] abraham
[1:10:34] you're abraham's children
[1:10:37] but you don't do what abraham does
[1:10:42] and you say you're born of the word for
[1:10:43] this hour but you don't stay true to the
[1:10:46] word for this hour
[1:10:48] there's something wrong
[1:10:54] he says now
[1:10:58] this did not abraham verse 41 you do the
[1:11:01] deeds of your father
[1:11:02] then they said unto him we be not born
[1:11:04] of fornication we have one father
[1:11:06] even god you think they didn't know
[1:11:08] serpent seed
[1:11:12] jesus said unto them if god were your
[1:11:14] father
[1:11:15] you would love me
[1:11:18] i'm telling your friends if god is the
[1:11:21] father of these individuals out here
[1:11:22] you're witnessing to
[1:11:23] they will love the word because the word
[1:11:25] is christ this message
[1:11:27] is christ amen this message this word is
[1:11:30] christ
[1:11:30] and christ is now here in the formation
[1:11:32] of his bride if they love christ
[1:11:34] they'll love you amen and they'll love
[1:11:36] you for telling them the truth
[1:11:41] if god were your father you would love
[1:11:43] me for i proceedeth forth and
[1:11:46] and came from god neither came i have
[1:11:48] myself but he sent
[1:11:49] me why do you not understand my speech
[1:11:52] even because you cannot hear my word
[1:11:56] i've said this before but they weren't
[1:11:58] deaf obviously they were communicating
[1:11:59] with them
[1:12:01] they were spiritually deaf they had no
[1:12:05] ears in the soul
[1:12:08] you are of your father the devil and the
[1:12:11] lust of your father you will do
[1:12:13] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:12:16] abode not in the truth because there is
[1:12:18] no
[1:12:18] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[1:12:22] speaketh of his own
[1:12:23] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:12:26] and because i tell you the truth you
[1:12:28] believe me not
[1:12:30] which of you convinceth me of sin and if
[1:12:32] i say the truth
[1:12:33] why do you not believe me he that is of
[1:12:36] god
[1:12:36] heareth god's words ye therefore hear
[1:12:39] them not
[1:12:40] because you are not of god
[1:12:46] see jesus didn't
[1:12:49] play around with the message
[1:12:54] and jesus didn't say oh you know i'm
[1:12:58] sorry
[1:13:00] that you didn't agree with me you're
[1:13:01] fine i'm fine we're all fine
[1:13:06] but jesus told him the truth because
[1:13:07] only the truth can set you free
[1:13:10] only the truth can set the seed free
[1:13:13] inside the soul
[1:13:14] that's bound over a cloud of darkness a
[1:13:17] cloud of denominationalism a cloud
[1:13:19] of man's ideas and hybridization only
[1:13:22] the truth can
[1:13:23] set that seed free
[1:13:26] now that doesn't mean that you present
[1:13:28] the message arrogant and mean and rough
[1:13:30] and nasty i don't believe that
[1:13:31] whatsoever brother branham gave us a
[1:13:33] perfect example
[1:13:34] of how to present but as nice as you can
[1:13:38] tell the truth
[1:13:41] with as much love in your heart for a
[1:13:43] lost soul as you can
[1:13:44] tell the truth don't water it don't
[1:13:47] manipulate it
[1:13:48] don't change it just tell the truth but
[1:13:50] tell it with as much
[1:13:51] love i mean if you're telling the truth
[1:13:53] to tell somebody off with the truth then
[1:13:55] you've got the wrong
[1:13:56] spirit to begin with
[1:14:00] amen we've been too many times amen
[1:14:03] we've been guilty
[1:14:04] of telling the truth
[1:14:08] and trying to tell it like jesus did
[1:14:12] amen but the only thing we were doing
[1:14:15] was mad and we wanted to tell somebody
[1:14:17] else so we told them the truth
[1:14:20] without the spirit of truth you can't
[1:14:23] tell the truth without the spirit of
[1:14:24] truth amen
[1:14:25] the spirit of truth and truth go
[1:14:27] together amen you were telling the truth
[1:14:29] with the spirit of another individual
[1:14:31] that was not christ
[1:14:33] [Applause]
[1:14:34] and we've all been guilty of it i said
[1:14:36] god forgive me and never let me do it
[1:14:38] again
[1:14:38] but if i bring the truth let me bring it
[1:14:40] in the spirit of truth amen
[1:14:42] and god is love amen and god is the one
[1:14:44] who told us
[1:14:45] don't just love those who love you back
[1:14:48] if you just love those that love you
[1:14:50] back what reward have you you love those
[1:14:52] amen that hate you that would
[1:14:54] despitefully use you that would do all
[1:14:55] manner of evil against you
[1:14:57] you love them because god loves the
[1:14:59] world he sendeth the reign on the just
[1:15:01] and the unjust amen so when we tell the
[1:15:05] truth we're telling the truth
[1:15:06] it may be just an unjust it may be tear
[1:15:09] but
[1:15:10] god sends the rain on the tear and the
[1:15:12] wheat
[1:15:17] amen why because of love
[1:15:24] jesus was not motivated by anger help
[1:15:27] self-preservation
[1:15:28] or attitude or arrogancy
[1:15:33] so when he said what he said the only
[1:15:35] way he could say it was out of love
[1:15:37] because god
[1:15:38] is love and god with his father
[1:15:41] it may hurt it may sting amen but it was
[1:15:44] the only thing that could help
[1:15:47] and i say god help me to tell the truth
[1:15:48] with a spirit of love
[1:15:52] because i've got to be of the same
[1:15:54] species
[1:15:56] you and i if we're going to bring forth
[1:15:58] children of this kingdom if we're going
[1:15:59] to declare his generation
[1:16:01] if we're going to help finish the body
[1:16:03] of christ
[1:16:05] then we can only bring forth by his word
[1:16:07] but we first must be the same species
[1:16:11] we first must be a spoken word bride
[1:16:15] brought to life by the spoken word and
[1:16:17] now virgin by a spoken word birth
[1:16:21] because he can only have a virgin bride
[1:16:23] and how are you going to be virgin with
[1:16:25] all you've done and all you believed
[1:16:26] wrong all your life
[1:16:28] how are you going to be a virgin birth
[1:16:30] bride when in the womb of your mind you
[1:16:32] have received all kinds of other seed
[1:16:34] all your life
[1:16:37] the only way to be virgin is to be born
[1:16:39] again
[1:16:41] then the old man is dead the new one has
[1:16:44] been brought forth by the word
[1:16:46] and as now as a virgin bride that can be
[1:16:48] presented to christ
[1:16:51] and as a virgin bride in this day by a
[1:16:54] by a virgin word amen being presented to
[1:16:57] christ
[1:16:58] now christ now can work through his
[1:17:00] bride
[1:17:01] to what to reproduce himself
[1:17:04] to bring forth another child
[1:17:09] and that child must be brought forth on
[1:17:12] the word
[1:17:13] so first you have to be the same specie
[1:17:17] got to be converted to be whatever he
[1:17:19] was
[1:17:21] you and i have to be the same then we
[1:17:24] must be united with him
[1:17:26] and as we're united with him then we
[1:17:29] must declare
[1:17:30] his generation in declaring his
[1:17:34] generation
[1:17:35] the germ of life the message the word
[1:17:37] the life comes forth
[1:17:39] and can contact another seed of life
[1:17:42] and the process can go on and on and on
[1:17:46] and on but it
[1:17:50] must be done correctly
[1:17:54] it must be sowed in love
[1:17:58] the life you live must be lived in
[1:18:00] absolute surrender to christ as a loved
[1:18:02] slave to christ
[1:18:04] the attitude that you reflect must be
[1:18:06] his the love that you must portray must
[1:18:08] be his
[1:18:09] it has to be him in you
[1:18:12] doing the works and then when god can
[1:18:15] flow
[1:18:16] through you and through me amen he can
[1:18:20] bring forth another child and another
[1:18:22] child
[1:18:23] and when the last one comes in the
[1:18:26] rapture will go
[1:18:29] i say god be praised said lord
[1:18:33] here i am here i am lord
[1:18:38] god you've called me you spoke to me
[1:18:41] you've quickened something that's in me
[1:18:43] and lord let me be
[1:18:45] bound by the gospel let no
[1:18:48] hybrid hybridized thoughts come in my
[1:18:50] mind actions come into my
[1:18:52] my actions lord let me be so surrendered
[1:18:55] to you
[1:18:56] that you can use me to complete your
[1:18:59] body
[1:19:01] how many more seeds out there how many
[1:19:03] more members of the body are lacking i
[1:19:05] have no idea
[1:19:06] they may all be in already we don't know
[1:19:09] but until we know let's go seek
[1:19:13] to save that which is lost
[1:19:17] let's give a true reflection of a true
[1:19:20] jesus christ
[1:19:21] let's portray a true life surrender to
[1:19:23] him and let's give
[1:19:24] true word true seed word that can bring
[1:19:27] life
[1:19:28] and if we're honest and if we're true if
[1:19:31] we're totally surrendered and totally
[1:19:33] submissive and speak the truth in love
[1:19:35] then if there's a seed out there it'll
[1:19:37] come
[1:19:38] it'll bring forth another child what we
[1:19:41] don't want to do is we don't want to
[1:19:43] look all around us
[1:19:45] and we don't want to look all around and
[1:19:47] say you know we've brought this to life
[1:19:49] and this the life and this the life
[1:19:51] and all the children that we have
[1:19:53] birthed have no reflection
[1:19:55] to jesus christ
[1:20:00] eve could say i have gotten a man from
[1:20:02] the lord
[1:20:04] but when cain acted the way he acted it
[1:20:06] proved who his father was
[1:20:12] and a church can say we've brought forth
[1:20:15] for christ we brought forth for christ
[1:20:17] but what we
[1:20:18] bring forth for christ will reflect who
[1:20:20] their daddy is
[1:20:24] and if everyone that we bring to christ
[1:20:26] amen begins to reflect their own will
[1:20:28] and their own desire their own life
[1:20:30] and something other than just the pure
[1:20:32] message begins to mingle it and mix it
[1:20:34] i tell you we need to be careful of what
[1:20:36] seed we're receiving and what seed we're
[1:20:38] dispensing
[1:20:40] but if there's some life that's coming
[1:20:42] forth amen from us
[1:20:43] as individuals or from this assembly it
[1:20:46] better be a life that reflects the
[1:20:47] father that reflects christ
[1:20:53] but when but when she brought forth
[1:20:57] abel he had a different nature
[1:21:02] when she brought forth seth he had a
[1:21:05] different nature
[1:21:07] and i say god we want to bring forth but
[1:21:09] we want to bring
[1:21:10] forth the completion of your body
[1:21:15] and me and my brothers and sisters and
[1:21:17] our children that are coming up
[1:21:19] and visitors and family members and
[1:21:21] those that will come in we want to sow
[1:21:22] the right seed in the right spirit with
[1:21:24] the right life
[1:21:26] to bring forth a life to complete the
[1:21:29] body of christ
[1:21:31] praise god why don't we labor in this
[1:21:33] together amen
[1:21:35] god bless you let's stand musicians if
[1:21:37] you'll come
[1:21:39] brother ben if you'll make your way up
[1:21:46] praise be to god when god
[1:21:50] was alone in heaven the first thing to
[1:21:52] come forth from god was the word
[1:21:55] i was the logos and through the logos
[1:21:58] and out of that logos he created
[1:21:59] everything that was created
[1:22:02] so out of god came the logos and out of
[1:22:05] the logos came all of creation
[1:22:08] but then out of christ will come abroad
[1:22:13] and out of the bride will come the rest
[1:22:15] of the body of christ
[1:22:17] it's the same pattern reflected there
[1:22:19] it's the same pattern reflected down
[1:22:21] here
[1:22:22] and i say god use us for your glory
[1:22:26] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:22:30] god we thank you that you've made the
[1:22:31] gospel so clear to us
[1:22:33] in this day lord you've made the
[1:22:36] preaching of the gospel and the
[1:22:37] ministering of the word lord by
[1:22:38] demonstration
[1:22:40] you've put it before our eyes so we
[1:22:41] could see it
[1:22:43] we see your word that's been opened to
[1:22:45] us now we have no excuse lord
[1:22:48] god i pray you help us to surrender a
[1:22:50] greater surrender than we've ever had
[1:22:52] before
[1:22:54] god may it just be you and us and
[1:22:56] nothing else
[1:22:58] may we have a virgin birth by a virgin
[1:23:00] word so that we can be a new creation by
[1:23:03] spoken word
[1:23:04] and that we can be that virgin bride for
[1:23:07] all of our mistakes we pray you forgive
[1:23:09] us lord
[1:23:11] you'd wash us by the washing of the
[1:23:12] water the word
[1:23:14] but god you know our hearts desire you
[1:23:16] know what's in the core of each of us
[1:23:18] we just want to reflect you lord
[1:23:22] lord i pray that you would give us that
[1:23:24] power by your spirit lord
[1:23:26] to lift us up out of ourselves and out
[1:23:28] of laodicea
[1:23:30] out of selfishness lord to be loved
[1:23:32] slaves to you to reflect your life
[1:23:35] and god may you use us our lips our
[1:23:38] actions lord our conduct our appearance
[1:23:41] may you use us to spread forth this
[1:23:44] gospel message
[1:23:46] may through us lord you may bring more
[1:23:48] children to the kingdom
[1:23:51] more members of that body lord that you
[1:23:54] might complete your body
[1:23:57] in the form of your bride we're here
[1:24:00] surrendered to you asking that you take
[1:24:01] us
[1:24:02] and use us and have preeminence through
[1:24:03] us we see our purpose lord all the way
[1:24:06] back in the beginning what the purpose
[1:24:08] for the bride was
[1:24:09] and it continues on but you will fulfill
[1:24:11] that purpose
[1:24:12] in this day and we surrender ourselves
[1:24:15] to you and we're surrendering ourselves
[1:24:17] to that purpose
[1:24:19] god we love you have preeminence among
[1:24:21] us
[1:24:22] use us for your glory in jesus christ's
