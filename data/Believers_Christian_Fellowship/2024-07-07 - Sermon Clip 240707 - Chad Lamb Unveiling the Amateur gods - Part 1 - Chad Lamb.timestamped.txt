[0:00] remember how brother brandham tells us
[0:02] that the only real Sin there is is
[0:04] unbelief said unbelief in what unbelief
[0:07] in the word of God what did they have
[0:09] what did these spies have in the rest of
[0:11] the nation when they rose up in a bitter
[0:12] cry amen at the at the at the testimony
[0:15] of the the 10 false Witnesses amen they
[0:18] they cried out and wanted to go back to
[0:20] Egypt and all that amen they they they
[0:22] were cut out he was displeased with them
[0:24] because they provoked him in the
[0:25] wilderness by what by not believing his
[0:28] promised word when they come face to
[0:30] face with it they did not believe it
[0:33] amen and so now they were kept out of
[0:35] the promise who was kept out of the
[0:36] promise those that didn't
[0:38] believe now now listen close this is
[0:42] what I want to drive down to it wasn't
[0:46] the ones who were vile and wicked and
[0:48] nasty and had a temper and and didn't
[0:50] always do what Moses said he cut them
[0:51] out because they were hard to deal with
[0:53] that wasn't how he differentiated who
[0:55] went in and who didn't go in and he
[0:58] didn't he didn't take Joshua and Caleb
[1:00] because they were always nice to their
[1:01] neighbor and they said sweet things and
[1:02] they took care of their mom really well
[1:04] he that's that was never the
[1:05] differentiating point that was not the
[1:07] deciding factor but it came down to the
[1:10] basis of faith and
[1:11] unbelief the separation line was faith
[1:14] and unbelief amen that the the the
[1:16] whether you went in or not who didn't go
[1:18] in those that didn't believe what didn't
[1:20] they believe they didn't believe this
[1:22] portion of the word there was others
[1:23] they could claim to believe there was
[1:25] others they acted and participated in
[1:27] but they didn't accept this truth that
[1:29] God God was going to give that land to
[1:31] them when they saw all the
[1:32] unsurmountable odds and they provoked
[1:35] God unto wrath amen and he rejected them
[1:38] and he said they're not going to go in
[1:39] they will not go in and they everyone
[1:41] died in the wilderness but there was two
[1:43] who went in not because they were nicest
[1:45] and better looking and more intelligent
[1:47] that wasn't the basis the basis for them
[1:50] entering in when the others were
[1:51] rejected is because said if God beest
[1:54] were more than able they're but bread
[1:55] for us cuz we believe what Moses said
[1:58] all the way back in Egypt come from God
[2:00] and it's nothing but the
[2:02] truth those are the two that went in
[2:04] it's not Good Conduct amen it's not bad
[2:08] conduct it's faith and in belief in the
[2:10] promised word of
[2:13] God and when I say that I feel like I
[2:16] have to qualify my statements because
[2:17] the more people hear you say something
[2:19] the more questions you have listen it
[2:20] doesn't mean that you're not going to
[2:22] have righteous acts and righteous Deeds
[2:24] amen that's the outcropping of Faith
[2:26] amen if you have faith genuine faith in
[2:28] the word of God you will obey the word
[2:30] of God and when you get off the word of
[2:32] God you'll repent and come back in line
[2:34] with the word of
[2:35] God understand we're not saying act any
[2:38] way you want you're going to go in any
[2:39] ways that's fine no that's a very clear
[2:41] indication that you don't believe the
[2:43] word of God if you trample over it so
[2:45] lightly and esteem it so
[2:49] little but conduct is not the
[2:52] basis faith is the basis
