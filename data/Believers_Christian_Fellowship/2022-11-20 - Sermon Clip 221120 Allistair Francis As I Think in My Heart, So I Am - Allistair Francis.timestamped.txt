[0:00] message people still want to show that
[0:02] today it's about how messy one gets at
[0:05] the
[0:06] altar how emotional how spiritual it
[0:08] gets to the altar you got to had that
[0:10] experience
[0:13] brother see how quiet he
[0:15] got because you're so used to hearing
[0:18] that so watch The
[0:25] Experience some of you parents in the
[0:27] message don't know
[0:28] this I was never in
[0:32] Egypt I was in this message from from
[0:35] the
[0:36] beginning my parents grew me up not
[0:39] doing anything wrong I dressed right
[0:41] from the very beginning I spoke right I
[0:44] never spoke slang never swore never
[0:46] drank never never smoked never had any
[0:49] girlfriends never
[0:51] straight I grew up perfect according to
[0:53] messy standards so I reached the point
[0:56] where they wanted me to have an
[0:58] experience with God yes and I had a
[1:01] Frank talk with my father and said tell
[1:04] me what to repent
[1:07] of cuz you want me to have that
[1:09] experience and my father and I had a had
[1:13] a relationship where we could talk this
[1:14] way and it was the first time he looked
[1:16] at me with a
[1:18] realization that there was no way I was
[1:20] going to have that
[1:22] experience being in the message all my
[1:25] life and being brought up not doing
[1:28] anything wrong so I was so specific with
[1:30] him I said so must I must I Repent of
[1:33] that one time I lied to
[1:35] Mom is that going to be it or when I
[1:38] fought with my brother does that make me
[1:40] a
[1:41] sinner I'm a Believer I believe the
[1:45] word how you came from the denominations
[1:49] the some of the deacons the brothers
[1:51] they drank smoke they saw a
[1:54] change they could cry about wrong things
[1:57] they did and how unworthy they were the
[2:00] message save them I can't do
[2:03] that you brought me up but now when I
[2:06] see all the people come to the front and
[2:07] they're just crying and and they're
[2:09] remembering what happened in their life
[2:11] before and so on they having this
[2:13] experience I don't have that and I can't
[2:17] fake
[2:19] it what do I do it's the first time he
[2:22] looked at me and he said Son there's
[2:25] only one thing the word has to be
[2:27] revealed to you personally when that
[2:30] happens you're going to know what to
[2:33] repent
[2:34] of and it happened and you'll never
[2:38] believe well you will now you'll never
[2:40] believe what it was I realized I had to
[2:43] repent of everything in my message life
[2:46] was
[2:49] self-righteousness I had to repent of
[2:51] self-righteousness which my parents
[2:53] never needed to repent
[2:55] of and repent means to change your
[2:58] thinking
[3:01] I realized when I came to the word and
[3:03] saw my place in the logos and it was
[3:05] revealed to me and I and I thought Lord
[3:08] I've been faking all this time I've been
[3:10] an Esau I need to repent of that
[3:13] thinking I know who I am now from that
[3:16] day
[3:18] changed I I don't stop
[3:21] crying glory to God
