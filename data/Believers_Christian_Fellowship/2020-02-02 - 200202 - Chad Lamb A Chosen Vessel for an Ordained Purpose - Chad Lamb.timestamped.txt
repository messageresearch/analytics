[5:06] that especially man
[5:08] god was moving man it's our privilege
[5:11] as children of god to worship our father
[5:14] amen when he's revealed so much to us
[5:16] and he's placed us and he's called us
[5:18] and
[5:19] he's showed us who we are amen it
[5:21] doesn't it
[5:22] somehow there's such a humility that
[5:24] comes with that
[5:25] such a desire just to tell him how
[5:27] wonderful he is
[5:28] how beautiful he is how precious he is
[5:30] to us
[5:32] oh praise be to god we love you this
[5:34] morning we're so glad to be together
[5:36] man while we're standing let's just take
[5:37] our bibles and go to the word
[5:42] let's turn to ephesians chapter one so
[5:44] say god bless you visitors that are with
[5:46] us we appreciate you being here

[5:54] moving amongst us amen
[5:57] amen praise be to god
[6:02] god is good
[6:06] and i want to read here from ephesians
[6:09] chapter 1
[6:11] verse 3 said blessed be the god and
[6:15] father of our lord jesus christ who hath
[6:17] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[6:19] in heavenly places in christ
[6:23] are you there if you're there
[6:26] in heavenly places in christ if you're
[6:28] already there
[6:30] not hoping to someday be there but if
[6:32] you're already there
[6:33] you're blessed with all spiritual
[6:35] blessings and sometimes i believe we
[6:38] live below our privileges because we
[6:39] don't realize where we've already
[6:41] attained to
[6:42] by the grace of god we're already in
[6:45] heavenly places in christ jesus
[6:47] therefore we're blessed with all
[6:48] spiritual blessings already
[6:51] and so so many times we're waiting for
[6:53] something to happen and the reason we're
[6:55] waiting to
[6:55] not realize it's already here amen we're
[6:58] already partakers it's already mine it's
[7:00] already
[7:00] portioned to me god is looking for
[7:02] somebody who can believe it amen
[7:05] when jesus was here on earth amen the
[7:07] the power to heal was here the prophet
[7:09] was here
[7:10] the one that moses spoke of was there
[7:12] amen but they didn't realize he was
[7:14] there
[7:15] amen but there was a little woman with
[7:17] the blood issue amen and she realized
[7:19] there's something there
[7:21] amen she knew within herself if i can
[7:23] but touch the hem of his garment
[7:24] i can be made every bit whole amen why
[7:27] she wasn't waiting for something to come
[7:29] she realized it was here
[7:32] and she got what she was seeking because
[7:35] her revelation
[7:36] is that that was there amen if our
[7:39] revelation is that i'm already there i'm
[7:41] already seated in christ in heavenly
[7:43] places
[7:44] now i'm blessed with all spiritual
[7:46] blessings i am a spiritual king and a
[7:48] spiritual priest
[7:49] i'm not waiting i'm here
[7:52] it's all mine friends it changes our
[7:55] behavior
[7:57] changes our attitude it changes our
[7:59] thinking
[8:01] amen let's read that again blessed be
[8:03] the god and father
[8:04] of our lord jesus christ who hath
[8:06] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[8:08] in heavenly places in christ according
[8:12] as he has chosen us in him before the
[8:15] foundation
[8:16] of the world that means you were in him
[8:20] before the foundation of the world
[8:22] he's chosen us in him before the
[8:24] foundation of the world so where were
[8:26] you
[8:27] in him when were you chosen in him
[8:31] before the foundation of the world that
[8:34] we should be
[8:34] holy and without blame before him in
[8:37] love
[8:39] amen having predestinated us unto the
[8:41] adoption of children by jesus christ
[8:44] to himself according to the good
[8:46] pleasure
[8:47] of his will
[8:50] that's the scripture that thrills me
[8:52] despite what i wanted
[8:54] in life despite what i hoped for no
[8:55] matter how much i longed to be his or
[8:58] long to be accepted by him or long
[8:59] amen it wasn't my purpose or my will
[9:02] that brought anything to pass it was his
[9:05] will and his purpose
[9:06] and because he had a will and he had a
[9:08] purpose he chose us in him before the
[9:10] foundation of the world
[9:11] so that his will and his purpose will
[9:13] never be defeated
[9:14] and he chose us that way so that we
[9:16] could be holy
[9:17] and blameless in love
[9:21] everything's already taken care of
[9:23] friends
[9:24] there should be no worry no fear no
[9:27] scare among us
[9:29] amen this morning by the grace of god
[9:32] i'd like to minister on a subject
[9:34] a chosen vessel for an ordained purpose
[9:38] a chosen vessel for an ordained purpose
[9:41] let's just bow our heads and ask the
[9:42] lord's blessing dear heavenly father
[9:45] we love you lord jesus and we thank you
[9:47] god for all that you're doing for us
[9:50] god your your plan of salvation your
[9:53] plan of redemption
[9:54] is mesmerizing it's amazing lord as you
[9:57] begin to open it up
[9:59] we begin to see that you've included us
[10:02] lord
[10:03] that we are part of this plan of
[10:06] redemption we are part of your plan
[10:08] a part of your thinking a part of your
[10:10] mind from before the foundation of the
[10:12] world
[10:12] and lord when we see that and the
[10:14] reality strikes our heart lord
[10:16] it's amazing god we don't want to take
[10:19] it for granted we don't want to just
[10:20] speak it as words or phrases but lord we
[10:22] want the reality of that to strike into
[10:24] our souls
[10:25] and bring forth the fruit that you've
[10:27] ordained for this moment in time
[10:29] for this hour and for this place we just
[10:31] asked all that you would take
[10:32] preeminence lord over the vessels that
[10:34] are gathered here
[10:35] that you would have your way in every
[10:38] part of the service
[10:39] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[10:42] you can be seated god bless you
[10:50] amen when we talk on this subject i've
[10:53] ministered on these things
[10:56] many times before this is not anything
[10:58] new there's nothing
[10:59] new here but it just becomes more vivid
[11:02] all of the time it becomes a greater
[11:03] reality in our lives all the time
[11:05] and like i mentioned before when the
[11:07] eagle starts soaring when you see him
[11:09] catching up draft you'll see the eagles
[11:11] start circling
[11:12] and circling and circling but every
[11:15] circle they're going higher
[11:17] and many times we circle back through
[11:18] the same things that
[11:20] that the prophet of god taught the same
[11:21] things that we preached before
[11:23] but each time we're going a little
[11:24] higher and seeing a little more clearly
[11:26] and a little higher
[11:27] and the prophet of god said the the
[11:29] higher an eagle goes the
[11:30] better its vision is amen and every time
[11:33] we're circling here in this
[11:34] updraft of the word we may cover the
[11:36] same theme again but when we go a little
[11:38] bit higher
[11:39] and a little bit higher and a little bit
[11:41] higher
[11:42] amen i want to read a quote from the
[11:45] prophet of god
[11:46] from the god who is rich in mercy from
[11:48] 1965.
[11:50] now we might i might inject just a
[11:52] little bit of doctrine here that
[11:54] if you don't believe it all right that's
[11:56] that's just okay i do believe it
[11:59] me too i believe that a man when he's
[12:03] born in this world
[12:04] that when you're a little baby born in
[12:06] the world you could not have been here
[12:07] without being the foreknowledge of god
[12:09] because he's infinite he knows all
[12:11] things
[12:12] when that little baby is born into the
[12:14] world there is something in that baby
[12:15] if he's ever going to have life there's
[12:18] a little something in there
[12:19] in that child then that he comes to
[12:21] sooner or later
[12:24] that little seed is in him now if you'll
[12:26] just take the scriptural plainly
[12:28] declares that
[12:31] now if you've got eternal life tonight
[12:32] if we have eternal life
[12:34] then we always were because there's only
[12:36] one form of eternal life we always were
[12:39] and the reason we were because we were
[12:41] part of god and god is the only thing
[12:44] that's eternal
[12:46] amen if we can have faith that we have
[12:47] eternal life we have to have faith that
[12:49] we were in god
[12:50] amen that god's family came from him
[12:53] amen you know my family came from me
[12:56] my children came from me and the
[12:58] children of god came from god
[13:00] they're a part of god they belong to god
[13:02] when we say
[13:03] heavenly father it's not just a phrase
[13:05] it's not just a term
[13:06] it's declaring origin when i say you're
[13:09] my father i'm declaring my origin that i
[13:12] came from you
[13:13] i'm one of your attributes i am i'm a
[13:15] child of yours and if i'm a child of
[13:17] yours i came from you
[13:21] amen so many things we get caught up in
[13:23] christian phrases amen and they become
[13:25] phrases with no meaning
[13:27] but the actual when we actually speak
[13:29] these words with understanding
[13:30] they have tremendous impact these are
[13:33] powerful
[13:34] things that we say he's my father
[13:37] well hallelujah if he's your father then
[13:39] you're the same thing he is
[13:41] [Applause]
[13:44] when jesus says that he was the son of
[13:46] god they knew he made himself
[13:48] equal to god amen the the
[13:51] the the jews the scholars and the rabbis
[13:53] in that day they understood clearly that
[13:55] if jesus could say
[13:56] i'm the son of god then he immediately
[13:58] put an equal sign between him and god
[14:01] and if i today can say i'm a son of god
[14:04] what does that do to me
[14:06] amen what am i in any different position
[14:10] i'm in a different category so of course
[14:12] not jesus christ but a child of god
[14:15] part of god he goes on to say now we are
[14:18] part of god you always was
[14:20] you don't remember it because you were
[14:22] only an attribute in god
[14:23] you were only in his thinking your very
[14:26] name if it ever was on the book of life
[14:27] it was put there before the foundation
[14:29] of the world
[14:30] he knew what you were
[14:33] oh praise god we've heard that we've
[14:36] heard that year after year after year
[14:38] we've read it in the scripture
[14:39] all whose names were not written in the
[14:41] book of life from before the foundation
[14:43] of the world
[14:44] we've read it we know it but it's got to
[14:46] become a living reality
[14:48] that takes all fear right out of your
[14:50] mind because it's already determined
[14:52] it's already happened
[14:53] it's already written and he's not going
[14:55] to change it
[14:59] he said i'm only saying this not to mix
[15:01] up doctrine but to straighten it out
[15:05] that we might get away from this fear
[15:07] and
[15:08] scare why is he teaching this
[15:12] to get us away from this fear and scare
[15:14] always scared
[15:16] that i'm going to mess up and i'm not
[15:17] going to be a child of god always is
[15:19] scared that
[15:20] somehow i'm not going to make it i'm not
[15:21] going to be one of them i'm not going to
[15:23] make the rapture i'm not going to be in
[15:24] heaven
[15:25] amen you didn't make the rapture because
[15:28] of your earthly conduct
[15:29] you made the rapture because your name
[15:30] is in the lamb's book of life from
[15:32] before the foundation of the world
[15:34] you've already made the rapture because
[15:36] god could declare
[15:37] that there would be a rapture knowing
[15:39] that there was going to be somebody in
[15:40] the rapture
[15:41] and he wouldn't declare there's a
[15:42] rapture unless he knew who was in the
[15:44] rapture
[15:47] god knows the end from the beginning
[15:50] amen what's brother brahm trying to do
[15:52] what are we trying to do
[15:53] take away the fear and scare you
[15:56] amen it's so hard sometimes we realize
[15:59] we're children of god
[16:00] we're expressed attributes of god but
[16:02] when you're walking through the store
[16:04] when you're driving down the road when
[16:05] you're sitting at a red light amen it's
[16:07] so easy
[16:08] to slip back into spiritual amnesia it's
[16:11] so
[16:11] easy for all of us to go back to just
[16:14] thinking of our human existence only
[16:17] in our human life in the beginning and
[16:20] that we began at our our
[16:22] natural birth amen where we had two
[16:24] earthly parents and we come forth
[16:26] in a hospital or someplace like that and
[16:28] began to live a life and
[16:30] and that's spiritual amnesia
[16:34] forgetting what was before forgetting
[16:37] where we came from and forgetting who we
[16:39] really are
[16:40] and it's so easy amen to drive down the
[16:43] road
[16:44] amen and slip back into that carnal
[16:47] natural just carnal existence amen but
[16:50] god is wanting us all the time to
[16:52] realize you're not
[16:54] just a carnal it's not just carnal
[16:56] experience it's not just earthly
[16:58] but you come from god you're going back
[17:00] to god you're an expressed attribute of
[17:03] god
[17:03] amen he wants to mold you after the
[17:05] image of himself he wants you to express
[17:08] there's this portion of himself that he
[17:09] wants to express through you
[17:11] [Applause]
[17:12] and he wants us to stay conscious of
[17:14] this all the time and quit slipping back
[17:17] amen into the in to the false amen
[17:19] slipping back into the negative but he
[17:21] wants us to stay
[17:22] focused on the positive so that this can
[17:24] be a proper reflection of what's over
[17:26] there
[17:27] [Applause]
[17:30] see it's so easy that's why
[17:34] that's why sometimes we harp and we
[17:36] preach on worldly entertainment
[17:38] and being caught up in the things of the
[17:40] world and in movies and entertainment
[17:42] and sports and
[17:43] and all of this social stuff because the
[17:46] the problem isn't
[17:47] and the problem is it it pulls you back
[17:50] into spiritual amnesia
[17:51] [Applause]
[17:53] that's the real problem it's constantly
[17:56] pulling you back
[17:57] amen we're not just harping on it to
[17:59] harp on it we're harping on because
[18:00] we've got to stay
[18:01] in the word because the word brings us
[18:03] the reality the word tells us who we are
[18:06] amen constantly feeding on that word
[18:08] gives you a proper identification of who
[18:11] you really
[18:11] are constantly in fellowship around the
[18:14] word
[18:15] amen fellowship on the things of god
[18:18] in the house of god hearing the
[18:21] preaching listening to the tapes
[18:23] reading our bible in prayer these things
[18:26] keep us in the right frame of mind
[18:29] but the things of the world amen cloud
[18:32] they fill
[18:32] our mind with other things and begin to
[18:35] take us away from the spiritual reality
[18:37] amen they become addictive to the flesh
[18:39] amen and the whole attempt is to pull
[18:41] you away from the spiritual
[18:43] and keep you planted in the cardinal
[18:45] because if you stay
[18:46] carnal and carnally minded amen the the
[18:49] devil could easily defeat us
[18:52] but when we focus on the true spiritual
[18:55] reality
[18:56] the devil cannot stand before the
[18:58] expressed word of god
[19:01] amen so sometimes these it seems like
[19:04] we're just harping or preaching or just
[19:07] blasting certain things
[19:08] we don't realize those things bring
[19:10] influence and the influence take us away
[19:12] from the influence of the word
[19:14] we can't walk two roads at the same time
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:18] god wants his bride singularly focused
[19:21] on him
[19:26] praise be to god don't know where i'm at
[19:30] so i might just repeat a little bit
[19:33] i'm only saying this not to mix up
[19:35] doctrine but to straighten it out
[19:37] then we might get away from this fear
[19:38] and scare you don't know who you are
[19:42] you're not going to be but now you are
[19:45] sons of god
[19:46] you always were the sons of god
[19:49] for when god had you in his thinking at
[19:51] the beginning you have to be
[19:53] some part of you your life that's in you
[19:55] now had to be with god before there
[19:58] well when he before he even became
[20:00] material here on earth before there was
[20:02] anything
[20:02] but god you were one of his attributes
[20:05] he knowed what your name would be
[20:07] he knowed the color of hair you would
[20:09] have he knowed all about you
[20:11] the only thing happened is when you you
[20:13] be being a sinner
[20:14] many of you can fellowship with me on
[20:16] this thought when you was a little boy
[20:17] or little girl
[20:18] you would walk around and there would be
[20:20] a certain thing that would just
[20:21] where it wouldn't bother the other kids
[20:23] it seemed like there was something in
[20:24] you that cried out
[20:27] that could be even in the midst of your
[20:28] sin doing horrible things but there was
[20:30] still something there
[20:34] there was something somewhere there was
[20:36] something somewhere
[20:37] yet you were a sinner you remember that
[20:40] certainly
[20:40] now what was that that was that little
[20:43] form of life
[20:44] in you then there was a little form of
[20:48] life in you then amen it's a little
[20:50] portion
[20:51] of god a portion of eternal life a
[20:54] little piece of himself
[20:55] and it was there then it doesn't come to
[20:57] you at some point
[20:59] amen the life of god comes to the life
[21:02] of god laying there amen to quicken it
[21:05] to life
[21:05] to bring it into manifestation to bring
[21:07] you to the realization of what's there
[21:10] [Music]
[21:13] praise be to god
[21:17] that was that little form of life in you
[21:19] then and then after a while you heard
[21:22] the gospel
[21:23] maybe you went to church you picked out
[21:24] this and that and went from denomination
[21:26] to denomination but one day
[21:28] you being part of god you had to be part
[21:30] of the word
[21:31] and when you heard the word you know
[21:33] where you come from
[21:34] you know what was the truth
[21:38] you were always the seed was in you
[21:40] always the word
[21:41] seen the word that was in you get that
[21:44] the word seeing the word that was in you
[21:48] who is the word god god is the word
[21:53] and the word seen the word that was in
[21:55] you
[21:57] and the word was god
[22:00] and the word seen the word what's in you
[22:07] it's not different friends it's not
[22:09] anything different the problem is the
[22:10] carnal mind can't say
[22:12] that but the spiritual mind can say
[22:13] that's thus stayeth the lord that's the
[22:15] truth
[22:19] amen
[22:23] the the word
[22:26] when you heard the word you know where
[22:27] you come from you know that was the
[22:29] truth you were always the seed was in
[22:30] you always the word seen the word that
[22:32] was in you
[22:33] that was before the foundation of the
[22:34] world saw the word
[22:36] and you come to it like my little eagle
[22:38] story of how the little eagle was
[22:40] hatched out under a hen and
[22:41] the little fellow walked with the
[22:42] chickens the hen clucked and
[22:44] he didn't understand her clucking and
[22:46] the little chickens their diet they
[22:47] had in the barnyard he didn't understand
[22:49] them how that they did that but there
[22:51] was something in him
[22:52] seemed to be different from what the
[22:53] chicken was because of the beginning
[22:56] he was an eagle see he he didn't have to
[23:00] change from what he always was
[23:04] he had to have something to wake him up
[23:05] to the reality of what he always was
[23:08] you weren't changed from tear to weed
[23:11] you weren't changed from goat to sheep
[23:13] if you're a sheep you're always a sheep
[23:15] if you're a wheat you were always a
[23:16] wheat
[23:17] but something came to wake you up to
[23:19] what you always were
[23:25] that's right one day his mama came
[23:27] hunting him and when he heard the scream
[23:28] of the ego it was different from the
[23:30] cluck of the hen
[23:31] and that's the way it is with every
[23:32] born-again believer you can hear all the
[23:34] theology you want to and
[23:36] all the men made discrepancies but when
[23:38] the word flashes out there then there's
[23:39] something take a hold
[23:41] you come to it i mean that's why i said
[23:43] before i'm not going to preach the
[23:44] message in a theological way
[23:46] to try to entice somebody's mind amen
[23:49] because that'll never
[23:50] hold amen we're not looking for
[23:52] convincing chickens that they might be
[23:54] eagles
[23:54] but we're giving an eagle screen to
[23:56] attract the ones that are all
[23:58] ready eagles they're all ready and eagle
[24:01] but they don't know they're an ego but
[24:03] there's something
[24:04] in them that can connect to the word of
[24:06] this hour preached in its full power and
[24:08] authority
[24:09] there's something already there when
[24:11] they hear the scream something inside
[24:13] says
[24:14] amen their mind might be absolutely
[24:16] saying i've never heard this how is this
[24:18] right this can't be true
[24:19] but something inside is leaping for joy
[24:21] because it's finally found
[24:23] something that came from home amen this
[24:25] is something familiar
[24:26] something from home and the spiritual
[24:28] amnesia is starting to break
[24:33] amen
[24:39] but when the word flashed out there was
[24:41] something take a hold you come to it
[24:43] you who were once dead in sin has he
[24:45] quickened
[24:46] there has to be life there to quicken
[24:49] first
[24:51] gone by his foreknowledge knowed all
[24:52] things and we were predestinated to be
[24:55] sons and daughters of god
[24:56] ye who were once dead in sin and
[24:58] trespasses wherein we all had our times
[25:00] past
[25:01] but hath he quickened look at paul when
[25:03] paul was a great theologian
[25:05] but when he come face to face with that
[25:06] word jesus
[25:08] it quickened he come to life right quick
[25:11] because he was ordained to be that
[25:15] that he was the part of the word and
[25:17] when the word saw the word
[25:19] it was it was his nature
[25:22] when the word saw the word as you
[25:25] realize when we come to the truth of
[25:26] this hour
[25:27] the message been given to us by a
[25:29] prophet of god when we come to the
[25:31] restoration of the word
[25:32] that was originally given to the to the
[25:34] pentecostal fathers
[25:35] when you come to that it wasn't your
[25:38] mind that caught anything
[25:39] it wasn't your intellect it was the word
[25:42] that saw the word
[25:44] it was the word inside that saw the word
[25:47] for the hour made manifest
[25:48] and those two things clicked together
[25:55] and when the word saw the word it was
[25:57] his nature all the clucking of the hens
[25:59] and the orthodox churches didn't have no
[26:01] effect upon him
[26:02] he had saw the word it was part of him
[26:05] he was an eagle
[26:06] he wasn't a chicken he was just in the
[26:08] barnyard with them but he was an
[26:09] eagle to begin with what were you to
[26:12] begin with
[26:13] an eagle how do you know because i heard
[26:16] the eagle scream
[26:17] and it resonated inside
[26:21] and sirs we would see jesus he said in
[26:23] the beginning god was not even god
[26:25] he was the great eternal and in there
[26:27] was attributes
[26:28] attributes was his thoughts and then he
[26:30] become a word like this
[26:31] and a word expressed well a thought
[26:33] expresses a word a word expressed as a
[26:35] thought
[26:36] and then remember if you ever was in
[26:38] god's thinking you always will be there
[26:41] if you got eternal life you are the
[26:42] expression or the
[26:44] attribute of his thought for this age
[26:48] you got that that's not a generic
[26:50] thought
[26:52] if i could hammer that down if he
[26:54] thought of you it wasn't a generic
[26:56] thought
[26:57] he didn't just think of you but he
[26:58] thought of you
[27:00] in this age and he thought of you
[27:03] in your body and he thought of you
[27:07] in your position in place
[27:10] because that's how he saw you that's how
[27:12] he wanted you
[27:13] amen that was to accomplish something in
[27:16] this age
[27:17] it wasn't a generic thought it was a
[27:18] very specific thought
[27:26] there was only one eternal life and it
[27:28] always existed
[27:29] and you and his mind existed before
[27:31] there was a world that's the reason he
[27:33] said he chose you before the foundation
[27:34] of the world it isn't what we think
[27:36] what somebody else thinks it's what god
[27:39] eternal
[27:40] you always was see in his thinking
[27:43] so it didn't matter what you thought
[27:44] about it it didn't matter how
[27:46] wrong your thinking was it was his
[27:48] thinking from the beginning
[27:50] that's what we're coming to
[27:54] and modern events made clear my prophet
[27:56] said you were a gene of your father and
[27:58] you were in your father yet your father
[28:00] had no fellowship with you
[28:02] he was in there but you knew it not and
[28:04] he knew it not but you were manifested
[28:06] that
[28:06] you might he might have he might
[28:08] fellowship with you
[28:09] and you being born again you're born of
[28:11] eternal life and that's the only one
[28:13] form of eternal life and that's god's
[28:15] life zoe the greek word zoe
[28:17] only one form of eternal life then if
[28:20] you are a son of god
[28:21] or daughter of god you were in god all
[28:24] the time
[28:26] but he knew what bed in time that you'd
[28:28] be planted
[28:30] all this should give us great
[28:31] consolation friends
[28:34] god knew what bed and time that you
[28:35] would be planting
[28:38] you were ordained to be in the flesh
[28:41] body you're in
[28:43] and you were ordained to come to earth
[28:45] in the time you came to earth
[28:48] you were born at a specific time in a
[28:50] specific
[28:51] place under a specific sign in the
[28:54] heavens you believe that
[28:56] because every seed of god was ordained
[28:59] and
[28:59] placed positionally by god's thinking
[29:02] before the foundation of the world he
[29:04] knew what bed and ground it would be
[29:05] planted in
[29:10] he knew what bed and time you would be
[29:12] planted so now you're made a creature a
[29:14] son of god manifest his son or daughter
[29:16] of god to meet the challenge of this
[29:17] hour
[29:18] to vindicate the true and living god of
[29:20] this hour the message that's coming
[29:22] forth in this time
[29:24] you're here amen you're not here to have
[29:27] a job
[29:27] and have a family and make a retirement
[29:30] and enjoy a few pleasures in life you're
[29:32] here to manifest the true and living god
[29:34] the message that's come forth in this
[29:36] hour you're here to manifest the message
[29:38] which is the word of god which
[29:40] is the true and living god and so we
[29:42] gotta
[29:43] we gotta quit letting the world strip us
[29:46] from our position and strip us from our
[29:48] placing
[29:49] we're here to manifest the true and
[29:51] living god the message that's come forth
[29:53] in this hour
[29:54] amen we've got to quit being carnal and
[29:57] quit
[29:57] being worldly
[30:00] because that's not what we were put here
[30:06] for
[30:08] praise be to god
[30:14] he said that's right you was done there
[30:17] before the foundation of the world
[30:19] if he wasn't chose that way no matter
[30:21] how much you try to impersonate it
[30:22] you'll never make it
[30:24] let's turn to ephesians chapter 2.
[30:39] ephesians chapter 2 verse 8. for by
[30:50] grace are you saved through faith
[30:52] and that not of yourselves it is the
[30:53] gift of god
[30:55] boy you really did a pretty good thing
[30:57] when you finally figured out
[30:58] that the word of god is true and i
[31:00] should go ahead and get saved
[31:04] you didn't do nothing
[31:07] amen for by grace you're saved through
[31:11] faith
[31:12] and that not of yourselves it's the gift
[31:14] of god
[31:17] not of works lest any man should boast
[31:20] you can't be proud about getting saved
[31:23] you can be thankful you can be grateful
[31:26] but you can't be proud because you
[31:29] didn't do it
[31:31] for we are his for we are his
[31:33] workmanship
[31:35] created in christ jesus unto good works
[31:38] which god hath before ordained that we
[31:40] should walk in them
[31:42] let's catch that
[31:46] he saved us by grace through faith and
[31:48] not on us not
[31:49] that not of ourselves is the gift of god
[31:51] why
[31:52] not of works so you can't boast for we
[31:55] are his
[31:56] workmanship his creation his molding his
[31:59] fashioning we are his workmanship he
[32:01] worked
[32:01] us and made us we are his workmanship
[32:04] created in christ jesus unto good works
[32:09] so there's works for us to do which
[32:12] god hath before ordained that we should
[32:14] walk in them
[32:16] you mean he didn't just save me so i
[32:17] could be saved
[32:19] he didn't just give me faith so that i
[32:20] could have faith no you're saved by
[32:22] grace through faith
[32:24] because he had a purpose for your life
[32:26] he you're his workmanship his creation
[32:28] his
[32:29] fashioning his moaning ordained
[32:32] unto good works creating crises in the
[32:35] good works ordained that we should walk
[32:37] with them before
[32:38] god has already determined there's
[32:40] something for you to do
[32:42] and if we're to do that we've got to be
[32:44] serious about it we've got to surrender
[32:46] our lives completely to him because
[32:48] there's something he wants to do
[32:49] he saved us for his purpose not our
[32:51] purpose he saved us by his will not our
[32:54] will
[32:57] let's go to second timothy 1 7.
[33:06] i i think brethren we we've got to get
[33:09] away from the
[33:09] idea that the minister is called and
[33:11] ordained
[33:14] are certain gifts or are certain
[33:15] officers in the church or certain
[33:17] positions
[33:18] they're called and ordained amen that
[33:20] that
[33:21] that that thinking will allow you to sit
[33:23] in your seat
[33:24] amen and not fully express the attribute
[33:26] that's inside of you
[33:27] that thinking will hinder and hamper the
[33:29] expression of god in this age
[33:31] we think well the one on the platform's
[33:32] ordained to be there certain officers in
[33:34] the church they're ordained and called
[33:35] to be there and you know i'm just here
[33:37] i'm just here to be part of the whole
[33:39] the whole thing and watch the ones
[33:41] called to work do the work no you're
[33:42] called to do the work
[33:44] each one of us individually are called
[33:46] according to his purpose nothing's
[33:48] without a purpose
[33:49] you're positionally placed you're there
[33:50] to fulfill a purpose to express a
[33:52] certain portion of the attribute of god
[33:54] that's inside of you
[33:55] that only you can express amen nobody
[33:58] else can express it
[33:59] so we got to get away from the whole
[34:01] mentality that those are they're called
[34:03] and they're called in their place
[34:05] but i'm nothing amen that's the devil
[34:08] that's the devil trying to stop the work
[34:10] of god in this age
[34:11] because you're called to manifest the
[34:14] true and living god the message of this
[34:16] hour
[34:16] you not the preacher alone you not the
[34:19] ministry alone you
[34:20] not the officers in the church you
[34:23] you at work you and your home you when
[34:26] you drive down the road
[34:27] are called to manifest the true and
[34:29] living god
[34:30] [Applause]
[34:32] so if we have the wrong thinking we
[34:34] bring forth the wrong manifestation
[34:37] [Applause]
[34:38] because as a man thinketh in his heart
[34:40] so is he
[34:41] we've got to take our thinking and tune
[34:44] it in and dial it in to match what the
[34:46] word says about us
[34:47] because the word doesn't say you're just
[34:49] a hanger on you're just a tagging along
[34:51] no the word doesn't say that the word
[34:53] says you're you are his workmanship in
[34:56] christ jesus
[34:57] amen and ordained unto good works
[35:00] which he before ordained you should walk
[35:03] in them
[35:04] if you're not going to do it who's going
[35:06] to do it nobody else because you were
[35:07] ordained to do it
[35:11] see there's spiritual laziness that
[35:13] creeps in
[35:14] and the devil wants to bring back
[35:16] spiritual amnesia amen so that we can
[35:18] just
[35:19] be a church member there is no such
[35:21] thing as just being a church member
[35:24] there are only sons and daughters of god
[35:27] and a son and daughter of god of
[35:29] absolutely they'll be part of an
[35:30] assembly
[35:31] for sure they'll be part of a body amen
[35:33] they'll be contributing but they won't
[35:35] be a part as a church member
[35:36] they will be a contributing part as a
[35:38] son or daughter of god
[35:40] positionally placed by god with the
[35:42] revelation that i'm here in
[35:44] this body with this temperament for his
[35:46] purpose
[35:49] the devil is trying to hinder the
[35:51] expression of god
[35:52] amen by trying to take away people's
[35:55] authority and their position
[36:01] second timothy 1
[36:05] and 7.
[36:12] for god has not given us the spirit of
[36:14] fear but of power
[36:15] and of love and of a sound mind
[36:19] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[36:20] testimony of our lord nor of me as
[36:22] prisoner
[36:23] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[36:25] of the gospel according to the power of
[36:26] god
[36:27] who have saved us and called us with a
[36:30] holy calling
[36:31] not according to our works but according
[36:33] to his own purpose and grace
[36:35] which was given us in christ jesus
[36:38] before the world began
[36:43] when was your purpose declared and when
[36:46] was your purpose given to you
[36:48] when you were in christ jesus before the
[36:51] world began
[36:53] that's an eternal purpose for your life
[36:57] don't let the devil tell you anything
[36:59] different don't let the devil make you a
[37:02] church member
[37:05] god's calling you to be a son and
[37:06] daughter of god and the devil's trying
[37:08] to make you comfortable being a church
[37:09] member
[37:10] he's trying to make you comfortable just
[37:12] coming to church on wednesday coming
[37:14] church on sunday
[37:14] living a decent moral life believing
[37:16] that god sent a prophet and there's a
[37:18] message
[37:18] and i'm just going to be a church member
[37:20] and that's my position and that
[37:22] that position will hinder the expression
[37:24] of god in your life
[37:25] that position will not that that
[37:27] mentality will not put you in your
[37:29] position
[37:29] because god has a position for each
[37:32] individual
[37:33] in his body amen but
[37:36] but the devil's trying to get us just to
[37:38] be satisfied which is being in the
[37:40] message of just being in the church
[37:42] that's not what you're called for you're
[37:43] called to be a son or daughter of god an
[37:45] expressed attribute of god see this
[37:50] message didn't come to puff up a man
[37:52] this message didn't come to prop up a
[37:54] certain category over another category
[37:56] this message that came this message came
[37:58] to lift the bride into her position
[38:01] and the bride is the many member body of
[38:03] jesus
[38:04] christ on earth today and it's many
[38:06] members
[38:07] and every member counts and every member
[38:10] has a position
[38:11] and every member has a job
[38:15] so this message didn't come to promote
[38:17] one over another this
[38:19] this message came to lift the bride into
[38:21] her position
[38:26] amen let's read that again
[38:29] verse nine who hath saved us and called
[38:32] us a
[38:33] a holy calling not according to our
[38:36] works
[38:37] it wasn't what you did that got you
[38:39] anything
[38:42] it you didn't get your position by what
[38:44] you did you got your position before the
[38:46] foundation of the world
[38:47] and his purpose for you was determined
[38:49] before the foundation of the world when
[38:50] you were in christ jesus
[38:56] not according to our works but according
[38:58] to his own purpose
[39:00] that's why if we feel like if i do
[39:03] everything right
[39:04] if i just get right and i really study
[39:06] the message i'll read the message
[39:08] and i really come to church and i really
[39:10] pray and serve god
[39:11] amen then god will give me a position
[39:15] wrong thinking you already
[39:18] have a position you're not hoping for
[39:22] one
[39:23] you're not trying to attain to one
[39:25] you're not working your way up into one
[39:27] you already have a position that was
[39:30] given to you
[39:31] in christ jesus before the foundation of
[39:33] the world and you're the one
[39:35] for that position nobody's gonna take it
[39:37] no it's not going anywhere
[39:42] we've got to step into that and express
[39:44] what god wants us to express in that
[39:45] position
[39:50] amen not according to our works but
[39:52] according to his own purpose and grace
[39:54] which was given us
[39:55] in christ jesus before the world began
[39:57] but is now made manifest by the
[39:59] appearing of our savior jesus christ who
[40:01] has abolished death and hath brought
[40:03] life and immortality to light
[40:05] through the gospel let's go over to
[40:08] romans 8.
[40:17] romans 8 and 28.
[40:27] and we know that all things work
[40:28] together for good to them that love
[40:30] god to them who are he called according
[40:32] to
[40:34] his purpose
[40:38] now let's look at this scripture this
[40:41] scripture has been a scripture given for
[40:42] consolation and it is it's a good
[40:44] consolation type scripture
[40:46] when you're going through troubles when
[40:47] things are difficult amen that
[40:49] that all things work together for good
[40:51] that's absolutely true
[40:52] but all things work together for good
[40:54] because of his purpose
[40:57] not because how special you are and how
[40:59] nice you are and how good what a good
[41:01] boy or girl you've been and
[41:02] how much you've been obedient and nice
[41:04] and done nice things
[41:05] that's not what happens amen all things
[41:08] work together for good
[41:10] for to them that love god and are the
[41:12] called according to his purpose
[41:14] everything's working good because of his
[41:17] purpose
[41:19] that's why in the midst of the worst
[41:21] trial of your life you can sit back and
[41:23] relax
[41:24] because nothing will defeat his purpose
[41:26] in your life
[41:28] we don't have to be afraid we don't have
[41:30] to be scared
[41:31] amen we've got to have confidence in god
[41:33] more confidence in god than our works
[41:35] more confidence in god than our will
[41:37] more confidence god than our thinking
[41:39] because it wasn't our thinking it wasn't
[41:40] our will it wasn't our works that put us
[41:42] in this position
[41:43] but the position was determined in
[41:45] christ jesus before the foundation of
[41:46] the world
[41:47] and we've got to believe that
[41:50] but but satan comes in and gets us to
[41:53] start acting like
[41:54] it's based on our works and our ability
[41:57] and our thinking
[42:02] why we live so defeated and so under our
[42:04] privileges and so nervous and scared all
[42:05] the time
[42:06] because we think i'm not getting it
[42:08] right and i'll never get it right
[42:10] and that's not it friends everything is
[42:12] going to work out
[42:13] because of his purpose everything's
[42:15] going to work together because
[42:17] his attributes will be on display he
[42:19] will not be defeated
[42:20] sons and daughters of god are not going
[42:22] to be lost amen they're going to fulfill
[42:24] the purpose he purposed
[42:26] in christ jesus before the foundation of
[42:27] the world nothing will stop that
[42:32] we got to get comfortable with that fact
[42:34] comfortable with the fact that he
[42:36] called me he chose
[42:39] me he placed me i'm here not by my will
[42:43] i'm not for my purpose but i'm here by
[42:45] his will for his purpose
[42:47] and i might as well get comfortable with
[42:48] that so that i can start expressing what
[42:51] he wants me to express
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:55] we've been so inhibited by wrong
[42:57] thinking we've been so held back by
[42:59] wrong thinking and lack of understanding
[43:02] we're spiritual creatures ordained of
[43:04] god to works
[43:05] and we've been holding back because
[43:07] we've been looking at the natural too
[43:08] much
[43:09] and we've been inhibited by the wrong
[43:11] understanding wrong teaching
[43:12] wrong doctrine carnal mind we've got to
[43:15] be lifted up into the spiritual and
[43:16] understand that i'm here to fulfill his
[43:18] purpose
[43:19] and i can do what he's called me to do
[43:21] and nothing can stop the works of god in
[43:23] my life
[43:26] but to speak with confidence move with
[43:28] confidence
[43:29] walk with boldness
[43:34] why is the sons and daughters of god so
[43:38] timid
[43:40] concerning the word of god it's our
[43:43] portion it's who we are
[43:44] it's what we are and if somebody's going
[43:47] to express the word of god in this age
[43:49] who's going to do it
[43:51] it's going to be the children of god
[43:58] look at this again romans 8 28 and we
[44:01] know that all things work together for
[44:03] the good to them that love god to them
[44:04] who are
[44:05] they called according to his purpose for
[44:07] whom he did for no he also did
[44:09] predestinate
[44:10] to be conformed to the image of his son
[44:12] that he might be the firstborn
[44:14] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[44:17] predestinate them he also called and
[44:19] whom he called
[44:20] let he also justified whom he justified
[44:23] then he also glorified
[44:28] future tense past tense
[44:32] are you hoping to be glorified nope i've
[44:35] already been glorified
[44:37] am i hoping to make it the glory no i
[44:39] came from glory
[44:41] and in the mind of god i've already made
[44:43] it i went full circle i've already
[44:44] arrived i'm not worried about arriving
[44:46] i'm not worried about making it i'm not
[44:48] worried about being a son or daughter of
[44:50] god
[44:51] all i'm worrying about is stripping away
[44:53] the carnal
[44:54] walking by the spirit so i can catch
[44:55] what he's trying to do this moment in my
[44:57] life
[44:58] i'm not i'm not afraid of making it i'm
[45:00] not afraid of things working out
[45:01] i'm not afraid of the devil i'm not
[45:03] afraid of diseases
[45:05] i'm not afraid of financial
[45:06] circumstances i'm not afraid of the
[45:08] government
[45:09] i'm not afraid of anything
[45:13] see that strips us away i mean it kills
[45:16] our spiritual sensitivity because we're
[45:17] always worried and afraid and worried
[45:19] about something but when you can strip
[45:21] the fear and the scare away
[45:22] then you can get tuned in with god and
[45:24] say god what are you trying to
[45:25] accomplish
[45:26] with this vessel with this attribute at
[45:29] this moment
[45:31] that's the life the bride has to live
[45:33] she's going to be consciously aware
[45:34] moment by woman he's got pre he's going
[45:37] to have preeminence in me
[45:38] he's accomplishing his purpose he's
[45:40] doing something in me
[45:41] i'm not waiting for it to happen it's
[45:43] happening now god make me sensitive
[45:46] god let me be tuned in god let me walk
[45:49] amen by the spirit
[45:53] the bride's got to it's got to come
[45:55] higher it's got to change
[45:56] the same old same old's not going to
[45:58] work there's got to be a greater
[46:00] preeminence a greater sensitivity
[46:02] a greater walk in the spirits
[46:05] and how are you going to get there if
[46:07] you're afraid
[46:09] afraid you're not going to make it
[46:10] afraid you're going to be lost afraid
[46:12] that if you mess up you'll be kicked out
[46:14] of that's why the prophet of god came to
[46:16] correct this wrong doctrine
[46:18] to set it straight so he can take the
[46:21] fear and scare away so that we can be
[46:23] who we were always called to be
[46:27] the devils tried when you were a child
[46:29] to wrap chains around you
[46:33] with circumstances and complexes and
[46:36] fears
[46:38] we've got all kinds of complexes
[46:42] the prophet of god dealt with complexes
[46:45] what the devil tried early on
[46:49] to label you
[46:54] all of you got one or another you got a
[46:57] label
[46:59] you were the rebellious one and you're
[47:00] the stupid one or you're the
[47:03] product of that that's right you got a
[47:05] label if it wasn't direct maybe it was
[47:08] indirect
[47:10] but the devil amen deception always
[47:13] comes
[47:13] the the fall always comes by deception
[47:16] deception comes by a lie
[47:19] and the devil from the time we were
[47:21] little tots tried to get us to believe a
[47:23] lie
[47:25] i'm the rebellious one i'm no good i
[47:28] won't amount to nothing
[47:29] i'm the stupid one
[47:30] [Music]
[47:34] if you're human you've had something
[47:35] like that
[47:38] nobody wants me i'll never be good
[47:42] enough
[47:44] lie lie lie
[47:47] lie lie
[47:50] in the flesh that's all true
[47:53] but in the mind of god that's all a lie
[47:56] [Applause]
[47:58] and we've walked around with chains
[48:01] unnecessarily
[48:03] because we identified with the lie and
[48:06] believed it
[48:06] amen i'm not the spiritual one
[48:12] i'll never get it i'll never understand
[48:16] lie lie lie lie
[48:20] what are we going to start saying what
[48:23] the word says
[48:26] i was chosen in him before the
[48:28] foundation of the world he's ordained me
[48:30] unto good works that he ordained before
[48:32] that i should walk in them
[48:33] amen he's got a purpose in my life and
[48:35] there's something he wants me to do and
[48:36] i'm not accepting that label
[48:38] i'm accepting this label the label i'm
[48:41] accepting is son of god and with that
[48:43] label
[48:44] i'll overcome that complex i'll conquer
[48:47] that idea
[48:48] and that wrong teaching and that wrong
[48:50] concept by the word of god
[48:51] [Applause]
[48:53] see there's a difference between
[48:54] confidence and arrogance
[48:57] arrogance is somebody who doesn't really
[48:59] have it but trying to make others think
[49:00] they got it
[49:03] that's arrogance but a true revelation
[49:05] won't bring arrogance it will bring
[49:06] confidence and confidence
[49:10] doesn't have to prove anything it's
[49:11] already proved
[49:14] the bride of jesus christ doesn't have
[49:15] to prove anything amen that's why
[49:17] amen they they tried to trap jesus
[49:19] christ but brother bam said he never
[49:21] clowned for anybody
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:24] do this and do that raise him up in the
[49:26] graveyard and
[49:27] they tried to get brother branham to do
[49:28] the same thing
[49:30] but you don't have to prove anything
[49:32] because you're not afraid of anything
[49:33] amen if somebody doesn't believe you so
[49:35] what
[49:37] it's not my job to convince everybody
[49:39] that divine healing's true it's not my
[49:40] job to convince everybody that the
[49:42] message is true if they don't believe me
[49:43] that doesn't change me
[49:46] the only time we get hindered is when we
[49:48] have to convince somebody
[49:50] and we got to convince them i'm right
[49:51] because if they don't think i'm right
[49:53] then there's a doubt inside of my heart
[49:54] that they're expressing by their
[49:56] unbelief
[49:57] and then we get combative and then we
[49:58] get argumentative and then we try to
[50:00] at this angle and that angle and why
[50:02] what we're actually trying to do is get
[50:04] to them to confirm what we're saying so
[50:06] that it covers the unbelief in our heart
[50:13] but confidence doesn't argue confidence
[50:16] doesn't fight
[50:16] confidence isn't afraid confidence
[50:18] doesn't have to prove anything
[50:20] confidence is built on faith which is a
[50:23] revelation
[50:25] i know who i am that's why jesus christ
[50:28] didn't have to speak at his trial
[50:32] what did he have to prove he knew he was
[50:33] the son of god
[50:36] he didn't have nothing to prove he was
[50:38] just walking in the will of god
[50:40] his father was in total control
[50:43] when he's getting punched his father's
[50:45] in control
[50:46] beard ripped out of his faith father was
[50:48] in control spit on
[50:50] father was in control oh may god let us
[50:53] get to that position
[50:54] that no matter what's happening my
[50:55] father's in control and i'm here to
[50:57] express something in his nature
[51:00] there's part of the word that's
[51:01] predestinated for this hour that's got
[51:03] to be alive and flesh
[51:04] and he's chose my flesh
[51:08] and if this circumstance comes to me
[51:10] it's so that
[51:11] he can gain victory so that he can be
[51:14] expressed in this situation
[51:17] now i'm not afraid of the situation
[51:19] because it came
[51:20] for his purpose and for his glory
[51:24] that's confidence amen
[51:28] let's go to psalms 139.
[51:52] psalms 139 verse 13
[51:56] david is writing this psalm says for
[51:58] thou has possessed my reigns
[52:00] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[52:03] i will praise thee
[52:05] for i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[52:07] marvelous are thy works
[52:09] and that my soul north right well
[52:12] my substance was not hid from thee when
[52:14] i was made in the secret and curiously
[52:16] wrought rotten the lowest parts of the
[52:18] earth thine eyes did see my substance
[52:20] yet being unperfect and in thy book all
[52:23] my members were written
[52:26] which in continuance were fashioned when
[52:28] as yet there was
[52:29] none of them when you didn't have
[52:32] fingers he wrote your fingers in the
[52:34] book
[52:38] when your members were being fashioned
[52:40] to continue
[52:41] he wrote them in the book and knew them
[52:43] before they were formed yet
[52:49] let's read that again thine eyes did see
[52:51] my substance yet being unperfect that
[52:53] means
[52:53] you weren't finished you were just
[52:56] starting
[52:57] and in my book all my members were
[52:59] written which in contingents were
[53:01] fashioned
[53:01] when as yet there was none of them
[53:05] how precious precious also are thy
[53:07] thoughts unto me o god
[53:08] how great is the sum of them if i should
[53:11] count them
[53:11] they are more in number than the sand
[53:13] when i awake i am still
[53:15] with thee can you have that same
[53:18] revelation
[53:20] before i came to the earth before i was
[53:22] formed he
[53:23] knew my members he knew what i would
[53:27] look like
[53:28] he knew where i would be born he knew
[53:30] what my parents would be
[53:31] he knew my digits he he knew my limbs
[53:36] because he had a purpose in making it
[53:38] thus and everything was fashioned for
[53:40] his purpose
[53:42] can we believe that and if you can
[53:43] believe like david can believe then you
[53:45] can believe the next statement
[53:46] how great are thy thoughts about me
[53:51] how precious also are their thoughts
[53:52] unto me oh god how great is the sum of
[53:55] them amen
[53:56] if you thought about me before i was
[53:58] even born how much have you thought
[54:00] about me
[54:01] if you thought about me amen before my
[54:04] members were formed before i came to
[54:05] this earth
[54:06] before you were using me in this
[54:07] capacity if you thought about me then
[54:10] how much have you thought about me david
[54:12] says great is the sum of those thoughts
[54:17] when we go back up to verse
[54:22] 14. says i will praise thee for i am
[54:25] fearfully and wonderfully made this word
[54:29] wonderfully
[54:30] is paula from the hebrew
[54:33] it means to be distinct marked out
[54:36] be separated be distinguished
[54:42] praise be the god
[54:45] when god made us we were fearfully
[54:48] with reverence in all
[54:51] fearfully and wonderfully distinguished
[54:53] and separated
[54:55] individually and precisely we were made
[55:00] not like everybody else
[55:04] not a clone but distinctly
[55:08] and separate were you fashioned
[55:11] because he's got a separate and distinct
[55:14] attribute for you to express
[55:16] so he formed you in a distinct and
[55:19] precise way
[55:21] with all and reverence why because that
[55:24] vessel is going to contain the very life
[55:27] of god
[55:30] that human vessel is going to hold
[55:33] eternal life
[55:34] and that human vessel is going to be the
[55:36] betting ground of the word
[55:38] and that human vessel is going to
[55:40] manifest the word in that day
[55:46] now we've got to get away from thinking
[55:49] i'm made wrong there's something wrong
[55:51] with me
[55:53] amen that thought's got to die too
[55:57] i'm wrong there's something wrong with
[55:59] me
[56:01] there's nothing wrong with you just
[56:03] surrender your life let the holy spirit
[56:05] come in and burn out everything that's
[56:07] not supposed to be there
[56:08] but god is not going to change the
[56:10] essence of how he made you
[56:13] because he made you fearfully and
[56:15] wonderfully to complete a task on this
[56:17] earth
[56:18] and if we keep thinking why am i this
[56:20] way i wish i were that way
[56:21] you're denying the very purpose of god
[56:25] and the devil gets us to say things that
[56:27] are contrary to the word of god
[56:30] i wish you had made me like this oh
[56:31] please don't ever say that again
[56:34] oh i feel like god made a mistake when
[56:35] he did this god doesn't make a mistake
[56:39] we got to quit wishing we were like
[56:41] brother so and so our sister so and so i
[56:43] wish i was like this
[56:44] don't ever do that again because god
[56:46] doesn't need two of the same thing
[56:48] [Applause]
[56:49] [Music]
[56:50] he needs something unique separated
[56:53] fearfully and wonderfully made
[56:56] see the bride's going to be in her
[56:57] position every member
[57:00] and she's not going to be afraid she's
[57:02] not going to have doubt she's going to
[57:03] know where she's placed
[57:04] and she's going to stay in that place
[57:05] because there's power that comes from
[57:10] positions
[57:12] you realize in an army everybody's got a
[57:15] different job to do
[57:16] you have the infantryman you've got the
[57:18] artillery you've got the supply chain
[57:20] you got the cooks you got the air force
[57:22] you got everybody they're all working
[57:24] together for the same objective
[57:26] and this is a mighty marching army this
[57:28] bride is supposed to be an invincible
[57:30] army
[57:30] but we're not all the same thing in this
[57:33] army
[57:33] and we can't all be the same thing if
[57:36] you sent out an army of a hundred
[57:37] thousand men
[57:38] and they were all infantry they'd last
[57:40] about two days amen they'd run out of
[57:42] ammo the first day
[57:43] they'd run out of food they would faint
[57:45] be weary and all die
[57:48] so why do we all want to be the same
[57:50] thing we're all the same thing there's
[57:52] no power there's no overcoming but we
[57:54] all have to find what god made
[57:56] how did god make me what is what am i
[57:59] interested in
[58:00] what am i good at what am i can do how
[58:02] can i contribute
[58:03] that's the exact way he wants you to
[58:05] contribute
[58:07] oh i wish i could drive the tank
[58:13] somebody's got to fix the tank
[58:15] somebody's got to put fuel in the tank
[58:20] if if the guy who's supposed to put fuel
[58:22] in the tank is off daydreaming and
[58:24] moping around and pounding because he
[58:26] doesn't get to drive the tank
[58:30] and he forgets to put gas in the tank
[58:33] because he's so distracted by what he's
[58:35] not
[58:37] and not paying attention to what he is
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:40] [Music]
[58:42] not a preacher i'm not a songly i'm not
[58:44] a singer i don't have super spiritual
[58:46] gifts
[58:46] amen forget about that don't pay
[58:48] attention to any of that
[58:50] be what you are start getting
[58:52] comfortable with the fact you're
[58:53] fearfully and wonderfully made
[58:55] he looked after your temperament he
[58:56] looked after your nature
[58:58] he got it all right he selected your
[59:00] parents all the way back for generations
[59:02] to get the right mix so that you can
[59:05] express
[59:05] a certain attribute of god quit worrying
[59:08] about what you're not
[59:09] and start focusing on what you are
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:15] we can't all do the same thing
[59:18] but when everybody gets in their place
[59:20] what a beautiful thing it is
[59:22] when it's running like clockwork and
[59:23] everything's just working the way it's
[59:25] supposed to be
[59:26] because everybody's operating the way
[59:27] they're supposed to operate the infantry
[59:29] men are good
[59:30] infantry men amen the artillery are good
[59:33] and accurate
[59:37] well the guy from the infantry says i'm
[59:38] sick of this i want to go fire the
[59:40] cannon
[59:40] amen and he doesn't know how to dial it
[59:42] in he can't even do his calculations
[59:44] right he doesn't understand geometry
[59:46] and all of a sudden he's lobbing mortars
[59:47] on his own guys
[59:52] that's what happens when somebody
[59:53] without a gift gets in the pulpit
[59:55] [Applause]
[59:57] because they're not built for it they're
[1:00:00] not made for it
[1:00:01] but we all got a place to be amen and
[1:00:04] when everybody gets in their place and
[1:00:05] gets
[1:00:06] happy in where god has put them then
[1:00:08] you're going to see a mighty marching
[1:00:10] army
[1:00:10] an invisible army not because we're the
[1:00:12] same but because we're
[1:00:14] different not because we have the same
[1:00:16] spiritual gifts because we have
[1:00:17] different spiritual gifts
[1:00:22] praise be to god i'm fearfully with
[1:00:25] reverence in awe
[1:00:27] and wonderfully to be distinct
[1:00:30] to be distinguished and separated
[1:00:34] that's how i'm made and i'm no
[1:00:37] longer going to complain about it
[1:00:42] i mean i i tell you i watch other men
[1:00:45] preach and i sit and marvel i'm like oh
[1:00:46] they're so good at that
[1:00:48] oh nobody can tell a story like that
[1:00:50] look how
[1:00:52] i'm like oh i wish i could do it that
[1:00:54] way i wish i was smoother that way i
[1:00:56] wish i could
[1:00:59] i'm done thinking those thoughts
[1:01:02] because i know where god's placed me and
[1:01:05] i know god has god made me
[1:01:06] amen i used to apologize because i read
[1:01:08] so many quotes amen i'm not apologizing
[1:01:10] anymore i'll read pages of quotes every
[1:01:12] service because that's how god made me
[1:01:15] and i know the way god made me and put
[1:01:17] me in this position
[1:01:18] amen will be the right the right
[1:01:21] ministry gift
[1:01:22] for the people that he gathers to this
[1:01:23] place this gift is matching these people
[1:01:26] in this place
[1:01:29] and i can't apologize for it anymore and
[1:01:32] i can't try to change it or wish it was
[1:01:33] different
[1:01:34] i'm absolutely satisfied with the way he
[1:01:36] made me
[1:01:38] if you watch my bald head for 10 minutes
[1:01:41] while i read a quote
[1:01:42] that's the way it's going to be because
[1:01:43] that's the way he made me
[1:01:46] and if i try to do anything different
[1:01:47] it's not going to work
[1:01:50] i've tried and it's failed
[1:01:54] we all have to get to that place i'm
[1:01:57] this and i'm comfortable being this
[1:01:59] this way i'm not trying
[1:02:02] to fashion after sister this or brother
[1:02:04] that because i've got them
[1:02:06] on a pedestal nobody should be on your
[1:02:08] pedestal
[1:02:09] brother brandon the prophet of the age
[1:02:11] he said if you love me
[1:02:13] call me brother but that was a brother
[1:02:17] with a powerful gift
[1:02:20] the gift was reverence the gift was
[1:02:23] lifted up
[1:02:24] but the man was a brethren
[1:02:28] we have to look at each other the same
[1:02:30] way we're brothers and sisters
[1:02:33] there's no categories
[1:02:37] there's no there's no stations one above
[1:02:39] the other there's
[1:02:40] offices and there could be an office one
[1:02:43] office over another office that's fine
[1:02:46] that's an office but the man is still a
[1:02:47] brother
[1:02:50] we've got to be careful that we keep a
[1:02:52] brother or brother in an office in
[1:02:54] office
[1:02:58] praise be to god let's go to jeremiah
[1:03:02] chapter 1.
[1:03:09] these things are so common i think we
[1:03:12] forget them
[1:03:16] i'd say it this way i told one brother
[1:03:20] this thought is simple but not
[1:03:22] simplistic
[1:03:27] it's not difficult but it's profound
[1:03:31] because we catch it in the right
[1:03:33] revelation it changes everything
[1:03:39] jeremiah 1 and 4
[1:03:42] when the word of the lord came to me
[1:03:44] saying before i formed thee in the belly
[1:03:46] i knew thee
[1:03:47] that probably only applies to jeremiah
[1:03:54] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[1:03:57] thee
[1:03:58] and before thou comest forth out of the
[1:03:59] womb i sanctified thee
[1:04:01] and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:04:04] nations
[1:04:08] god formed him to be
[1:04:12] a prophet to the nations
[1:04:16] before jeremiah had a chance to make a
[1:04:19] decision
[1:04:22] he was ordained to be a prophet to the
[1:04:24] nations
[1:04:26] and before jacob esau could make a
[1:04:29] decision or do good or bad
[1:04:30] and jacob have i loved esau have i hated
[1:04:34] and jeremiah was already given his
[1:04:38] job
[1:04:40] before he was formed in the mother's
[1:04:42] body
[1:04:44] let's read it again
[1:04:48] the word of the lord came unto me saying
[1:04:50] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[1:04:52] thee
[1:04:53] and before thou cometh forth out of the
[1:04:55] womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee
[1:04:56] a prophet unto the nations
[1:05:00] jeremiah didn't get to pick his position
[1:05:05] he didn't get to pick what time he would
[1:05:07] be born on earth
[1:05:09] he didn't get to pick the gifts that
[1:05:11] would be him he didn't get to pick
[1:05:13] his physical characteristics and make up
[1:05:17] god picked it because god knew the job
[1:05:20] that he was going to do and he made him
[1:05:21] in in a way that he could do it
[1:05:24] jeremiah was called the weeping prophet
[1:05:27] he had a certain nature that god wanted
[1:05:29] to express in that day
[1:05:30] and he was made that way
[1:05:34] brother ben says in events made clear by
[1:05:36] prophecy
[1:05:38] god does his own choosing by
[1:05:39] predestination chooses the prophets for
[1:05:41] every age notice it
[1:05:42] he fixes the nature of that prophet to
[1:05:44] fit that age
[1:05:48] see he fits his style whatever he does
[1:05:50] he fits him whether he's educated or not
[1:05:52] educated he fits that gift
[1:05:54] the manner that he'll preach and the
[1:05:55] gifts he'll have and the message for
[1:05:57] that certain age god predestinated that
[1:05:59] certain thing to happen
[1:06:00] and there's not another thing can take
[1:06:02] its place care what it is how many
[1:06:04] man-made achievements nothing can take
[1:06:06] its place
[1:06:06] he's predestinated a man maybe an
[1:06:09] ignorant man he might have
[1:06:10] predestinated him another kind of man
[1:06:12] whatever he is he gives him his class
[1:06:15] his gift give him his nature his style
[1:06:18] and whatever it is how he expresses
[1:06:20] himself and whatever he does
[1:06:22] he makes the man of the hour to catch
[1:06:24] the people of the hour
[1:06:27] amen why because the man of the hour
[1:06:30] is going to have to catch a certain
[1:06:32] people of the hour
[1:06:34] and the people of the hour are going to
[1:06:36] have a certain characteristic
[1:06:38] i mean in that characteristic of the
[1:06:39] people of the hour it's only going to
[1:06:41] take that profit of the hour to catch
[1:06:43] that characteristic and the people of
[1:06:44] the hour
[1:06:45] so god makes him in the way to catch him
[1:06:48] his style
[1:06:49] the way he expresses himself the way he
[1:06:51] speaks his
[1:06:52] nature the things he likes
[1:06:56] that's probably only for prophets
[1:07:00] remember we're all sons and daughters of
[1:07:02] god
[1:07:06] oh praise be to god i don't
[1:07:09] when i say sons and daughters of god i
[1:07:11] don't want to get the wrong thinking
[1:07:12] either why
[1:07:15] because when jesus says i'm the son of
[1:07:16] god they went to stone him because him
[1:07:19] being a man made himself equal to god
[1:07:23] it wasn't just a son of god like
[1:07:25] something separate from god
[1:07:27] or something else other than god that's
[1:07:30] not the jews knew what he was saying
[1:07:33] when he's saying he's a son of god he
[1:07:34] made himself equal to god
[1:07:36] because the son of god comes from god's
[1:07:38] part of god connected to god
[1:07:39] is god expressed and so when we say
[1:07:43] we're sons of god
[1:07:44] we're not something separate from god
[1:07:46] something in addition to god
[1:07:47] uh something a different a different
[1:07:49] something else different than god
[1:07:51] it's the same thing it's god expressed
[1:07:54] in his attributes as sons and daughters
[1:07:55] of god
[1:07:56] it is god amen it is god expressed in
[1:08:00] this world
[1:08:01] that's sons and daughters of god we've
[1:08:04] got to stop thinking
[1:08:05] i'm a son of god like you're something
[1:08:07] different than god you're not anything
[1:08:08] different than god you are god
[1:08:10] portioned out in a little attribute and
[1:08:12] a little piece to have a certain
[1:08:14] expression that he labels his son
[1:08:16] so that it can be expressed in a certain
[1:08:18] way
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:19] but what is that son of god what is that
[1:08:22] attribute of god it's
[1:08:24] god it's just a little piece amen
[1:08:28] it's just a portion but a portion of god
[1:08:31] is still god
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:36] that's why the scripture says the
[1:08:37] prophets were called
[1:08:39] gods little gods
[1:08:42] from the great god father is god sons
[1:08:45] are gods
[1:08:49] why it's the same thing
[1:08:53] same thing different expression right
[1:08:57] that should take the scare away that
[1:09:00] should take the fear away
[1:09:06] let's go to luke chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:09:09] i just want to keep laboring in this
[1:09:11] thought if you'll bear with me
[1:09:13] just want to stick with it for a little
[1:09:16] bit longer
[1:09:20] chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:09:23] what i mean it's simple but not
[1:09:25] simplistic
[1:09:27] it's not complicated but it's powerful
[1:09:36] i mean there come a time
[1:09:41] where peter
[1:09:46] realized that he was the son of god
[1:09:52] there came a time for peter when all the
[1:09:55] scare went away
[1:09:59] and the very authority that he was
[1:10:02] afraid of
[1:10:04] was the one that he'd faced down in the
[1:10:05] council
[1:10:08] the very one that he was running from
[1:10:11] during jesus trial
[1:10:13] peter could boldly and calmly talk to in
[1:10:15] his trial
[1:10:18] you realize what a revelation will do
[1:10:23] he caught who he was by the new birth
[1:10:27] he understood his position and he could
[1:10:29] stand there
[1:10:30] when they threatened him they they
[1:10:32] arrested him
[1:10:33] they threatened him they imprisoned him
[1:10:35] they brought him up to scare him
[1:10:37] he meant to try to threaten him and they
[1:10:39] said no longer preach in his name
[1:10:42] and he says you tell me is it better to
[1:10:44] obey god or better to a
[1:10:45] man he wasn't he wasn't trying to prove
[1:10:49] anything
[1:10:50] he wasn't defending himself he wasn't
[1:10:52] scared amen when the apostle paul
[1:10:54] began to give answers to felix amen
[1:10:58] when he began to answer the question
[1:11:00] that he wasn't trying to get out of
[1:11:03] prison
[1:11:05] paul was not trying to go free paul was
[1:11:08] trying to convert the one he's talking
[1:11:10] to
[1:11:12] when he got in front of the magistrate
[1:11:13] when he got in front of of the authority
[1:11:16] and the governor
[1:11:17] what did he do he preached the message
[1:11:22] he said you know what what have they got
[1:11:24] against you he says well i'm called here
[1:11:26] because of the resurrection and started
[1:11:29] preaching to them the resurrection of
[1:11:31] jesus christ
[1:11:33] he wasn't trying to make a case he
[1:11:35] wasn't trying to
[1:11:36] to manipulate any situation to go free
[1:11:39] amen he was just there because he wasn't
[1:11:41] afraid he was placed there by god
[1:11:43] all he had to do was speak the word and
[1:11:45] god was going to do what god was going
[1:11:47] to do
[1:11:50] we don't have to be afraid
[1:11:53] luke 1 11
[1:11:58] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[1:12:00] the lord standing in the right side of
[1:12:02] the altar of incense and when zacharias
[1:12:04] saw him he was troubled and fear fell on
[1:12:06] him
[1:12:07] but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:12:09] zacharias for thy prayer
[1:12:10] is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall
[1:12:12] bear thee a sign and thou shalt call his
[1:12:14] name
[1:12:14] john and thou shall have joy and
[1:12:16] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:12:18] birth
[1:12:19] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:12:20] the lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:12:22] nor strong drink
[1:12:23] and he shall be filled with the holy
[1:12:25] ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:12:27] and many of the children of israel shall
[1:12:29] be turned to the lord their god
[1:12:31] and he shall go before them in the
[1:12:32] spirit and power of elias
[1:12:34] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:12:36] children and the disobedient to the
[1:12:38] wisdom of the just
[1:12:39] to make ready a people prepared for the
[1:12:41] lord
[1:12:43] praise god he wasn't
[1:12:46] even conceived yet
[1:12:50] of john the baptist he wasn't even
[1:12:52] conceived yet
[1:12:56] but he was a portion of the word in the
[1:12:59] thoughts of god
[1:13:00] that had to be expressed in this
[1:13:01] dimension god had already ordained it he
[1:13:04] had already fashioned it he knew it was
[1:13:06] coming so when zacharias there
[1:13:08] gabriel the angel could come and tell
[1:13:09] him exactly
[1:13:11] what he would do the scripture he would
[1:13:14] fulfill
[1:13:15] and the very nature that he'd have
[1:13:18] of elijah john the baptist didn't get
[1:13:23] the pick
[1:13:25] because god picked when john the baptist
[1:13:27] was with him as an attribute and his
[1:13:28] thought before the foundation in the
[1:13:30] world it was already determined it was
[1:13:31] already
[1:13:32] decided now it was time to bring it out
[1:13:34] into manifestation
[1:13:35] and he could tell zechariah exactly what
[1:13:37] his name is going to be called
[1:13:38] what attributes you're going to have
[1:13:40] what portion of scripture is going to
[1:13:41] fulfill
[1:13:41] what nature he's going to have
[1:13:45] you think god didn't know about you you
[1:13:47] didn't think that
[1:13:48] you had the same position john the
[1:13:50] baptist that in the thoughts of god god
[1:13:52] knew you would come
[1:13:54] when you would come and what portion of
[1:13:56] his thinking that you would manifest in
[1:13:57] this life
[1:13:59] it's already determined he already knew
[1:14:01] we just have to get comfortable with
[1:14:03] that fact
[1:14:04] and we've got to believe it as truth
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:09] let it override every doubt let it
[1:14:11] override every question
[1:14:12] let it override every complex in every
[1:14:14] label that you've ever received
[1:14:16] let this truth override all of that
[1:14:22] brother bam said in super sign now i
[1:14:24] know you're going to remind me of what
[1:14:26] jesus said about
[1:14:27] if you can receive it this is elijah
[1:14:28] that was to come
[1:14:30] in that forgotten beatitude in matthew
[1:14:32] 11 6 when the disciple john
[1:14:34] after john like elijah woodsman lived in
[1:14:37] the woods
[1:14:38] a woman hater like elijah elijah
[1:14:40] condemning the women
[1:14:41] just as hard as he could by the way they
[1:14:43] were living and what did john do
[1:14:45] the same thing it's not lawful for you
[1:14:48] to have her
[1:14:49] the immoral woman the nature of that
[1:14:51] prophet
[1:14:53] the nature of that prophet wasn't his
[1:14:56] choice
[1:15:00] the nature of the prophet he loved the
[1:15:02] woods he loved to stay in the woods
[1:15:05] not because he wanted to love the woods
[1:15:10] do you understand he didn't decide one
[1:15:13] day to love the woods
[1:15:14] he was pre-programmed to love the woods
[1:15:21] too many people have tried to imitate
[1:15:23] brother branham and be a lover of the
[1:15:24] wilderness and lover of the woods
[1:15:26] and go hunting when it's not in their
[1:15:28] nature
[1:15:29] when the prophet did it i've got to do
[1:15:31] it he loved nature he saw god in nature
[1:15:32] i've got to go do the same thing
[1:15:34] that was his nature not your nature he
[1:15:37] didn't do it just because he wanted to
[1:15:39] he did it because he was pre-programmed
[1:15:41] to come in the spirit
[1:15:42] and nature of elijah and he was
[1:15:45] pre-programmed to love the woods
[1:15:48] and god put his parents together to get
[1:15:51] a nature in him that would love the
[1:15:52] woods and he made sure that his mother
[1:15:55] was half indian and that cherokee blood
[1:15:57] would come down through and he made sure
[1:15:58] there was enough irish blood in there to
[1:16:00] make him a fighter because he needed to
[1:16:01] be a fighter
[1:16:02] and enough cherokee blood to give him a
[1:16:04] woodsman because he needed to be a
[1:16:05] woodsman
[1:16:07] and he made sure the grandparents got
[1:16:08] the right spot and the parents got in
[1:16:10] the right spot
[1:16:11] why because he was putting in him a
[1:16:13] nature that he didn't choose
[1:16:15] but was already there because it fit the
[1:16:17] word of god
[1:16:18] and the portion that he had to fulfill
[1:16:20] of the word of god
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:24] we're not imitating one another i don't
[1:16:26] have to be what brother branham was
[1:16:28] i'm not him he did his part i'm doing my
[1:16:32] part
[1:16:32] you don't have to be me and i don't have
[1:16:34] to be you we don't have to imitate
[1:16:36] anything we don't have to pretend
[1:16:38] [Applause]
[1:16:41] you don't have to go on a hike one day
[1:16:42] and you say oh
[1:16:44] if if i could just hear a bugle call
[1:16:46] amen it would do something to my heart
[1:16:48] because it did the brother bread
[1:16:49] you might hear a bugle call and it means
[1:16:50] nothing to you
[1:16:52] that doesn't make you not a child of god
[1:17:02] the bride is being liberated by the word
[1:17:05] of god
[1:17:06] we don't want imitation we don't want
[1:17:08] put on we want freedom to express
[1:17:11] the programming that came in our
[1:17:12] spiritual dna
[1:17:14] and god fashioned the flesh by bringing
[1:17:18] parents together to bring out a certain
[1:17:20] characteristic
[1:17:21] in your human flesh that would accent or
[1:17:24] be able to express
[1:17:25] the nature that was in the seed
[1:17:29] god worked hard to get it this way quit
[1:17:31] trying to undo all of his work
[1:17:36] hallelujah the nature of that prophet he
[1:17:39] loved the woods he stayed in the woods
[1:17:41] he came forth fearless he was against
[1:17:43] organization you generation of vipers
[1:17:45] who's warned you to flee the wrath to
[1:17:47] come
[1:17:49] for god's able these stones the right
[1:17:50] shield abraham he pulled no punches
[1:17:53] why did brother bradham go through so
[1:17:55] much time explaining how similar john
[1:17:58] and elijah was
[1:18:00] because that spirit of elijah had to
[1:18:02] come back five times
[1:18:04] and the fourth time it would arrive it
[1:18:06] would be in the prophet for this age
[1:18:09] and the characteristics that he had were
[1:18:12] pointing to his fulfillment of the
[1:18:14] scripture
[1:18:18] he wasn't putting on
[1:18:21] he didn't decide to love the woods
[1:18:23] because he read in the bible elijah
[1:18:24] loved the woods
[1:18:26] he didn't have to put nothing on
[1:18:32] you don't have to put nothing on you
[1:18:35] don't have to pretend
[1:18:36] anything don't pretend
[1:18:40] don't pretend to be spiritual
[1:18:45] don't pretend don't pretend to try to
[1:18:48] talk deep when you're not deep
[1:18:49] maybe you're not supposed to be deep
[1:18:53] don't try to be deep don't try to be
[1:18:55] spiritual don't try to be anything
[1:18:57] just be what god made you to be
[1:19:00] find that place in him where you're
[1:19:03] comfortable that you know
[1:19:04] that i'm his that he called me that i
[1:19:06] belong to him and i am what he wants me
[1:19:08] to be and get comfortable in that
[1:19:10] and get tuned in in the spirit where he
[1:19:11] can lead you the way he made you
[1:19:15] and quit feeling condemned because this
[1:19:17] one's so deep and when we when we preach
[1:19:19] on this i can't put it together and i
[1:19:20] can't ever explain it
[1:19:22] and maybe it's not your job to explain
[1:19:23] it it's only your job to believe it
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:28] don't try to explain don't try to be an
[1:19:30] intellectual don't
[1:19:31] don't try to be a super spiritual don't
[1:19:33] try anything
[1:19:35] just be what he made you to be
[1:19:39] and learn to get comfortable walking in
[1:19:41] the place he puts you
[1:19:42] in the body he puts you in in the place
[1:19:44] he puts you in
[1:19:48] if you only knew all these hard
[1:19:49] experiences i had who ordained the hard
[1:19:51] experiences
[1:19:53] if you only knew my childhood who
[1:19:55] ordained what parents you would be
[1:19:56] brought through
[1:19:58] if you only know what i've suffered
[1:19:59] through who ordained the suffering
[1:20:04] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:20:05] get his attribute to be expressed
[1:20:08] he's trying to fashion he's trying to
[1:20:10] mold he's trying to get everything in
[1:20:12] position to explain
[1:20:13] express himself
[1:20:17] hallelujah
[1:20:22] romans 9.
[1:20:39] romans 9
[1:20:42] and 20.
[1:20:46] name but old man who art thou that
[1:20:48] replies against god shall the thing form
[1:20:50] say to him that formed it
[1:20:51] why hast thou made me thus
[1:20:55] hath not the potter power over the clay
[1:20:56] of the same lump to make one vessel into
[1:20:58] honor
[1:20:59] and another unto dishonor
[1:21:04] what right do we have to say why'd you
[1:21:06] make me this way
[1:21:09] but we should be saying is god how do
[1:21:10] you want to use me this way
[1:21:14] and we can constantly go on our knees
[1:21:16] and pray god if there's anything that
[1:21:18] you don't want
[1:21:19] hanging over in my nature cut it out
[1:21:22] cut it out but one thing he's not going
[1:21:24] to do is change the very essence of how
[1:21:26] he made you that's going to remain the
[1:21:28] same
[1:21:33] brother says in the in the rapture now
[1:21:35] so were you if you got eternal life
[1:21:38] you were in god before there ever was a
[1:21:41] world you are part of a son of god an
[1:21:43] attribute of god
[1:21:44] he knowed the very age you were coming
[1:21:48] he predestinated you to that age
[1:21:52] what age are we coming you say brides
[1:21:54] age that's wonderful
[1:21:56] i'm coming the bride i was predestinated
[1:21:58] to be in the bride in the bright age
[1:22:00] but i was also predestined to come
[1:22:05] in the age of satan's eden
[1:22:09] the two take place at the same time
[1:22:12] so i was predestinated to be expressed
[1:22:15] in this
[1:22:16] age there is no deception
[1:22:19] there is no power of hell there is no
[1:22:21] demon influences
[1:22:23] there's no two hundred thousand thousand
[1:22:25] demons that's been released in this day
[1:22:26] that is going to stop the expression of
[1:22:28] god
[1:22:30] there's nothing to be afraid of
[1:22:33] because why he predestinated me to live
[1:22:36] in the age
[1:22:36] where two hundred thousand thousand
[1:22:38] demons has been released from the river
[1:22:40] euphrates
[1:22:40] and has left the the armies of hitler
[1:22:43] stalin and mussolini and now come into
[1:22:44] the ecclesiastical system
[1:22:46] to come after the bride i've been
[1:22:48] predestinated to live in this age
[1:22:50] so that means this age will not overcome
[1:22:53] me it means those two hundred thousand
[1:22:55] thousand demons in the ecclesiastical
[1:22:57] room will
[1:22:58] not overcome me
[1:23:01] why because he knew what age i would be
[1:23:03] in and he programmed me with my
[1:23:06] spiritual dna
[1:23:07] in this age to overcome these obstacles
[1:23:13] everything you're facing you're already
[1:23:15] programmed to overcome
[1:23:18] he'll put nothing more on you than you
[1:23:20] can bear what does that mean
[1:23:21] that means he already knows what you can
[1:23:24] bear because you're programmed
[1:23:25] pre-programmed to overcome certain
[1:23:27] things
[1:23:28] and he'll not allow the thing to come
[1:23:30] that you're not already programmed to
[1:23:32] overcome
[1:23:35] god orchestrates the events in our lives
[1:23:38] he's already got his program set he's
[1:23:41] already got his purpose declared
[1:23:42] and everything is moving according to
[1:23:44] his will
[1:23:46] that's why you can't say this is too
[1:23:48] much for you it's not too much for you
[1:23:52] because his word said it wouldn't be too
[1:23:54] much for you
[1:23:57] so if something comes on you and you get
[1:24:00] that overwhelming feeling
[1:24:02] this is too much i can't do it you got
[1:24:04] to drop back into another realm
[1:24:07] and go to the word of god says he'll put
[1:24:09] nothing more on you than you can bear
[1:24:11] that means he built me for this trial
[1:24:17] if somebody has to overcome that trial
[1:24:20] to express god
[1:24:22] and you say god not me
[1:24:26] then really what you're saying is god
[1:24:27] give it to my brother
[1:24:31] because somebody has to express that
[1:24:35] somebody has to get victory over that
[1:24:37] thing somebody has to express that
[1:24:39] attribute of god
[1:24:40] and if you're saying god not me you're
[1:24:41] saying god give it to somebody else
[1:24:44] yes instead of accepting what god has
[1:24:47] done
[1:24:48] and saying god give me wisdom give me
[1:24:50] your word let me express
[1:24:51] what you want expressed god we're going
[1:24:54] to have
[1:24:55] victory amen you're going to have
[1:24:56] victory through this vessel for your
[1:24:58] glory
[1:25:00] we have to have a greater confidence he
[1:25:03] preached destiny due to that age
[1:25:05] to take that place and no one else can
[1:25:07] take it
[1:25:08] i care how many impersonations and
[1:25:10] things you've got to be there because he
[1:25:12] knew you would be there
[1:25:13] now you were made manifest now you can
[1:25:15] fellowship with him and that's what he
[1:25:16] wants
[1:25:17] he longs for fellowship to be worshiped
[1:25:19] but if your life did not always was an
[1:25:21] attribute of god you're just a mimic of
[1:25:23] christianity
[1:25:24] there'll be millions and billions of
[1:25:26] them they'll just be mimics of
[1:25:27] christianity
[1:25:31] things that are to be just like your
[1:25:33] birth here
[1:25:34] i said you was prepared god knew you
[1:25:36] would be here
[1:25:38] did he know were you prepared
[1:25:43] then what are we scared of
[1:25:47] and now you know even things that your
[1:25:48] parents done people think that that
[1:25:50] isn't visited from generation to
[1:25:51] generation but it is
[1:25:53] further down he says you were you were
[1:25:55] all pre-planned by
[1:25:57] god nothing happens by
[1:26:00] chance oh that's the thing we have to
[1:26:04] remember right in the middle of
[1:26:05] of a dreadful situation we got to go
[1:26:07] right back to this
[1:26:10] we were all pre-planned by god nothing
[1:26:12] happens by chance with god he knows all
[1:26:14] about it
[1:26:14] it's all pre-planned planned for many
[1:26:16] generations back
[1:26:18] so that you could be here tonight did
[1:26:20] you know that
[1:26:27] let's go to hebrews chapter 4.
[1:26:32] praise be to god
[1:26:38] i don't know about you but i'm feeling
[1:26:39] like my feet are on solid ground
[1:26:44] brother brown said the world's falling
[1:26:46] apart he said
[1:26:48] let it fall apart the condition of the
[1:26:51] world's not scaring me
[1:26:54] condition of the falling part of the
[1:26:56] world is not scary
[1:26:58] to me because we've been
[1:27:01] placed here for the falling apart of the
[1:27:05] world
[1:27:08] hebrews 4 3
[1:27:12] for we which have believed do enter into
[1:27:14] rest as he said as i have sworn in my
[1:27:16] wrath
[1:27:16] if they shall enter into my rest
[1:27:18] although the works were finished
[1:27:20] from the foundation of the world
[1:27:25] it's finished all the works of god were
[1:27:28] finished before the foundation of the
[1:27:29] world
[1:27:30] now it's just being manifested acted out
[1:27:33] but it's already been finished
[1:27:35] it's finished in the mind of god
[1:27:38] brother said god can't have a new
[1:27:41] thought
[1:27:45] jehovah jireh 1961 see we have to be
[1:27:48] what we are
[1:27:49] gifts and callings are without
[1:27:50] repentance when you were born in this
[1:27:52] world before the world ever began
[1:27:54] god knew you positionally placed you if
[1:27:56] that isn't so then the bible isn't so
[1:27:58] that's exactly
[1:28:01] you're not earning gifts
[1:28:06] 1964 the harvest time the potter as
[1:28:09] roman 8 tells us who can tell the potter
[1:28:11] can the clay say make me thus and thus
[1:28:13] see no god has to display all of his
[1:28:15] attributes and so
[1:28:16] he has to make one vessel of dishonor
[1:28:19] another one to honor
[1:28:20] to show that one up of course now but he
[1:28:22] is sovereign you see nobody can tell him
[1:28:24] what to do
[1:28:25] and he makes us different even we're
[1:28:27] told in the bible that the stars differ
[1:28:29] one from another
[1:28:30] one star difference from another you
[1:28:32] know there is
[1:28:34] you know there is a difference in heaven
[1:28:36] in angels angelic beings
[1:28:38] there is angels there is cherubims there
[1:28:40] are seraphims
[1:28:41] they're different they're differences
[1:28:43] there and we are all different
[1:28:45] and god has big mountains he has planes
[1:28:48] prairies grass desert water
[1:28:50] see he's different he's a god of variety
[1:28:52] and look at his people here this morning
[1:28:54] and some of us white some black
[1:28:56] some brown some yellow some red it's his
[1:28:58] people
[1:29:00] god doesn't want us to be the same we
[1:29:04] shouldn't want us to be the same
[1:29:08] and the message things that are to be he
[1:29:10] says
[1:29:11] jesus has gone to make ready are coming
[1:29:13] there notice in my father's house's many
[1:29:15] mansions
[1:29:16] or let us i don't mean to add to the
[1:29:18] word or take from it because we're not
[1:29:20] to do that
[1:29:21] he said in my father's house
[1:29:25] are many kinds of mansions i don't
[1:29:28] believe that when we get to heaven that
[1:29:30] we'll all just look alike just exactly
[1:29:32] alike
[1:29:32] i don't believe that we'll all be
[1:29:33] blondes or brunettes or
[1:29:35] are all big or all giants see what
[1:29:38] brother ram just said
[1:29:41] different kinds of mansions or abodes or
[1:29:44] dwelling places
[1:29:46] he says we're not all going to be the
[1:29:47] same we're not going to be blonde
[1:29:50] or brunette are little are giant
[1:29:55] this is just a reflection of that do you
[1:29:58] believe that
[1:29:59] this is just a negative reflection of
[1:30:01] the positive that's already there
[1:30:04] if that's true then that is already set
[1:30:10] so how are you going to change this if
[1:30:11] that's already set
[1:30:17] we just need to get the right influence
[1:30:20] to think the right thoughts
[1:30:22] to perform the right things
[1:30:27] he says i believe that god is a god of
[1:30:30] variety the world proves that he's got
[1:30:32] big mountains little mountains he's got
[1:30:33] planes he's got deserts
[1:30:34] he's got different things because he
[1:30:36] made it the way he wanted it
[1:30:38] and he made the season summer winter
[1:30:40] spring on him he made the season it
[1:30:41] shows
[1:30:41] he's a god of variety he made you in a
[1:30:43] variety some men are real blusterous
[1:30:45] and some are real dogmatic and others
[1:30:47] are fine others are kind and you're just
[1:30:49] kind of all different kinds of people
[1:30:51] in his kingdom
[1:30:55] we think if i'm going to be in the
[1:30:57] kingdom of god i got to be just like
[1:30:58] brother so-and-so
[1:30:59] and be so pious and so quiet and so
[1:31:01] humble and me can hardly say anything
[1:31:05] peter wouldn't have made it
[1:31:10] amen don't let the devil lie to you
[1:31:14] anymore
[1:31:16] if god made you that way it's for a
[1:31:18] purpose
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:21] look at saint peter and judge him by
[1:31:23] andrew
[1:31:24] andrew is that prayer warrior just
[1:31:25] staying on his knees all the time and
[1:31:27] the apostle peter was one of those
[1:31:28] firebrands that preached and so forth
[1:31:30] and paul was more scholarly more like
[1:31:32] like the prophet or something and set
[1:31:34] back now think about what he's saying
[1:31:36] this is profound
[1:31:37] what if peter thinks he should be like
[1:31:40] andrew
[1:31:42] i mean there's nothing wrong with being
[1:31:43] on your knees praying all the time
[1:31:45] there's a good attribute i like that
[1:31:47] that's a good thing to like and want
[1:31:49] but andrew was positionally placed to be
[1:31:52] a prayer warrior
[1:31:54] peter was positionally placed to be out
[1:31:56] front preaching
[1:31:58] do you get that if peter would have went
[1:32:01] and tried to do andrew's place
[1:32:02] he would have never succeeded and andrew
[1:32:04] would have never succeeded in peter's
[1:32:05] place
[1:32:06] and we could all say oh that andrew he
[1:32:08] prays hours and hours every day
[1:32:10] oh i'm just going to be like that if god
[1:32:13] didn't make you like that you'll never
[1:32:14] be successful like that
[1:32:16] you're just trying to imitate what god's
[1:32:18] given somebody else if god has called
[1:32:20] you to be a prayer warrior it will come
[1:32:22] natural that doesn't mean we don't pray
[1:32:25] we all pray we should spend time and
[1:32:27] pray
[1:32:27] we should set time aside to pray that's
[1:32:29] not what i'm saying but if god has
[1:32:31] called you to
[1:32:32] hours of intensive prayer and
[1:32:33] intercessory prayer it will
[1:32:35] come natural when you shed the things of
[1:32:38] the world and you
[1:32:40] quit thinking worldly thoughts and get
[1:32:41] tuned in with the spirit of god it'll be
[1:32:43] a natural
[1:32:44] outcropping of the way you're already
[1:32:45] programmed
[1:32:48] but to decide to be a prayer warrior is
[1:32:52] nonsense
[1:32:54] to decide to be a witnesser is nonsense
[1:32:58] brother so and so he's always witnessing
[1:33:00] to somebody standing in line
[1:33:02] goes to dinner with a stranger and next
[1:33:04] thing you know he broke the seals to him
[1:33:09] it's true right
[1:33:12] but then you try to do it and fall flat
[1:33:14] on your face
[1:33:17] and you make it worse been better if you
[1:33:20] just been quiet
[1:33:24] it's not your gift
[1:33:27] we've got to get comfortable with who we
[1:33:28] are
[1:33:30] we're not all witnesses we're not all
[1:33:33] preachers we're not
[1:33:34] all prayer warriors but some of us are
[1:33:36] prayer warriors
[1:33:38] some of us are preachers some of us are
[1:33:39] evangelistic some of us are witnesses
[1:33:42] some of us are caretakers
[1:33:47] some of us our job is just to care for
[1:33:49] the other sheep in the body
[1:33:52] just to give them care fix them a meal
[1:33:55] send them a card sometimes that's our
[1:33:57] job
[1:33:58] and if that's your job it'll be a
[1:34:00] natural expression of what god
[1:34:02] programmed into
[1:34:05] and if that's what god programmed into
[1:34:07] don't think that your job is
[1:34:09] littler than somebody else's job
[1:34:13] remember the guy putting the gas in the
[1:34:14] tank
[1:34:16] it's not littler than the guy driving
[1:34:18] the tank
[1:34:20] if we start to think that way then also
[1:34:22] we have a breakdown somewhere and the
[1:34:24] whole thing starts come crashing down
[1:34:26] because every joint must supply
[1:34:29] every joint must supply for the
[1:34:32] edification of the whole body
[1:34:35] if god's called me to be a caretaker i'm
[1:34:37] a caretaker
[1:34:39] if god's calling me to be an encourager
[1:34:41] i'm going to encourage her if whatever
[1:34:43] but it's got to come natural you're
[1:34:44] already programmed to do it
[1:34:48] and don't be dissatisfied with your
[1:34:51] portion
[1:34:53] don't be dissatisfied just get to the
[1:34:55] place where you say god
[1:34:56] help me to do the best of whatever you
[1:34:59] called me to do
[1:35:00] help me to do it unreserved help me to
[1:35:02] do it by your leading help me do it by
[1:35:04] the leading of your spirit
[1:35:05] not my mind but let your spirit lead me
[1:35:07] into what you want me to do
[1:35:09] and it's amazing different people with
[1:35:11] different gifts will catch different
[1:35:13] things
[1:35:15] there'll be people i'll talk to and
[1:35:17] they'll say did you catch that in the
[1:35:18] service when that changed and i'll be
[1:35:20] like
[1:35:21] i'm the pastor am i supposed to catch
[1:35:22] that
[1:35:27] and i didn't catch it it used to really
[1:35:30] bother me i'm like
[1:35:31] am i not spiritual
[1:35:36] some and two or three people will say
[1:35:38] did you catch that and i'd be like
[1:35:39] i missed it am i even a son of god
[1:35:46] but it's funny but the devil does that
[1:35:47] to all of us
[1:35:50] but there are some people who are
[1:35:51] spiritually sensitive
[1:35:55] but they're not good at other things
[1:35:57] there's some people who are not a
[1:35:59] spiritually sensitive
[1:36:00] and they're really good at other things
[1:36:03] you have gifts of administrations
[1:36:05] and helps wisdom
[1:36:09] knowledge they're not all supposed to be
[1:36:11] the same
[1:36:13] so the brother is super sensitive he
[1:36:15] said did you catch that in the service
[1:36:16] and when the other brother says no he
[1:36:17] doesn't go
[1:36:20] i did and brother so-and-so did
[1:36:24] because just a few days later this
[1:36:25] brother's going to do something that's
[1:36:26] going to save your hide
[1:36:30] because you'll miss it we have to have
[1:36:34] confidence in ourselves and we have to
[1:36:35] have confidence in one another
[1:36:38] we have to start saying that my that
[1:36:40] sister is really good at that
[1:36:41] i'm not good at that but i'm going to
[1:36:42] ask that sister if she can help me
[1:36:45] i know that sister spends hours a day
[1:36:47] praying i'm going to ask her to help me
[1:36:48] pray for this need
[1:36:51] this brother he's real sensitive i'm
[1:36:53] going to ask him a question
[1:36:56] that brother he's really good with the
[1:36:58] word he's really good at the details
[1:36:59] there's something i'm going to go ask
[1:37:00] that brother
[1:37:04] if we don't understand what god's doing
[1:37:06] we'll label somebody
[1:37:08] as not spiritual and somebody else is
[1:37:10] intellectual and somebody else is a fly
[1:37:11] by night
[1:37:14] well they're not grounded they're just
[1:37:16] spiritual they're just flipping
[1:37:18] well he's intellectual he's not
[1:37:19] spiritual
[1:37:22] see how dangerous that is
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] it's like saying you're just an
[1:37:27] infantryman but you're just in the
[1:37:28] supply chain
[1:37:33] you see what i'm saying we've got to
[1:37:34] have confidence in one another and we've
[1:37:36] got to be thankful that that brother's
[1:37:38] different than me and that sister's
[1:37:39] different than me because i need her and
[1:37:41] she needs me
[1:37:41] amen and i need him and he needs me
[1:37:44] because this is a body
[1:37:45] a body ministry a body of jesus christ
[1:37:47] that is called the bride
[1:37:49] that has to be on display fully
[1:37:51] functioning
[1:37:52] on display not just a minister and a
[1:37:55] pulpit but a
[1:37:56] body on earth and we've got to have
[1:37:59] confidence in one another and we've got
[1:38:01] to trust in the gifts that are in one
[1:38:03] another
[1:38:04] we have to have first confidence in
[1:38:06] ourselves and have faith in what god has
[1:38:08] done as us
[1:38:09] and then we have to have faith in what
[1:38:10] god has done in my brother
[1:38:13] and quit trying to evaluate and rate and
[1:38:16] i'm more spiritual and they're less
[1:38:18] spiritual and i
[1:38:18] i'm right and they're wrong stop all of
[1:38:20] that nonsense and let god do what god's
[1:38:22] done
[1:38:23] god has built his army and in his army
[1:38:26] everybody's got a place amen and i don't
[1:38:28] care if they're cooking
[1:38:29] i need to cook with no strength how are
[1:38:33] you gonna fight
[1:38:34] you need somebody who understands
[1:38:36] nutrition somebody who
[1:38:37] understands calorie count somebody who
[1:38:39] can get you through the next battle
[1:38:44] you understand you need somebody who
[1:38:46] understands logistics and gets the
[1:38:48] details
[1:38:48] you don't want your super spiritual
[1:38:50] person working on the details
[1:38:53] i tell you one thing right now if you're
[1:38:55] planning a camp don't get your super
[1:38:57] spiritual person to play in your camp
[1:39:03] because you won't have meals
[1:39:08] not everybody will have a bed
[1:39:12] but they just know that the lord will
[1:39:14] work it all out
[1:39:19] and they're right because the person
[1:39:21] who's detail-oriented with
[1:39:22] administration that gifts will see the
[1:39:23] failure and jump in and fix all their
[1:39:25] mistakes
[1:39:27] we laugh because it happens every day
[1:39:30] all around us it's taking place
[1:39:32] if we could just learn to trust it
[1:39:35] trust it and be thankful god made it
[1:39:38] that way
[1:39:40] i thank god this brother's wired that
[1:39:42] way and that sister is wired that way
[1:39:44] i'm thankful because that's what we need
[1:39:46] as a body
[1:39:48] god knew what he was doing he brought us
[1:39:50] together if he's ordained us to be here
[1:39:52] in this assembly as one body
[1:39:54] god knew each piece that had to be here
[1:39:56] and each piece has a
[1:39:58] specific place and a position
[1:40:01] and i'm thankful for all of them we've
[1:40:04] got to adjust our thinking
[1:40:07] and be so thankful for what god has done
[1:40:09] and thankful for a body
[1:40:11] not thankful for individuals
[1:40:16] i'm so glad that we got good preaching
[1:40:20] what good is good preaching if you don't
[1:40:22] have a sound system
[1:40:25] or even a church building
[1:40:29] because you have no trustees you don't
[1:40:30] have audio no audio visual people
[1:40:33] you see what i mean what if nobody
[1:40:36] claimed it
[1:40:38] some of you quit coming to church
[1:40:44] but you see what i mean it's not just
[1:40:47] one this and one that and this is the
[1:40:48] most important
[1:40:50] we've got to stop thinking like that
[1:40:53] let every joint supply freely so that we
[1:40:56] can be all that god's called us to be
[1:41:02] amen we're still in things that are to
[1:41:06] be
[1:41:07] god's the god of variety
[1:41:10] he's talking about andrew and peter
[1:41:14] andrew is that prayer warrior just stay
[1:41:15] on his knees all the time and apostle
[1:41:16] peter is one of those firebrands that
[1:41:18] preached and so forth
[1:41:19] and paul was more scholarly like like
[1:41:21] the prophet or something and set back
[1:41:23] and see moses wrote the first four books
[1:41:25] of the old which he wrote the old
[1:41:26] testament the rest of it was the laws
[1:41:28] and kings and psalms and so forth
[1:41:29] and what someone wrote of the prophets
[1:41:31] but moses wrote the laws the first four
[1:41:33] books
[1:41:33] of the bible genesis x's leviticus
[1:41:35] deuteronomy and then paul wrote the new
[1:41:37] testament that's true
[1:41:38] matthew mark luke and john were the acts
[1:41:40] of what taken place and so forth but
[1:41:42] paul separated the law in grace
[1:41:44] and put it into its place he was the
[1:41:46] writer of the new testament he gave us
[1:41:48] the writings of the new testament
[1:41:49] setting the word of god in order now
[1:41:51] notice
[1:41:52] many mansions many kinds of mansions
[1:41:55] like many kinds of hills like many kinds
[1:41:57] of rivers springs lakes
[1:41:59] they were here when you come here first
[1:42:01] because the kindness of your heavenly
[1:42:03] father placed them here
[1:42:04] because some men like mountains some
[1:42:06] like waters
[1:42:08] some like deserts and some like lime
[1:42:12] ohio
[1:42:14] i had to put that one in there
[1:42:17] amen good thing the beauty of the people
[1:42:20] is the k
[1:42:21] beauty of the church is the character of
[1:42:22] the people not the landscape around it
[1:42:27] you know you're coming he knew your
[1:42:29] nature
[1:42:30] what you would be so he made it just the
[1:42:33] way that you could enjoy it
[1:42:36] that's his natural creation he knew what
[1:42:39] you would be and what nature you'd have
[1:42:40] so he made his natural creation
[1:42:42] match what you would enjoy
[1:42:46] we weren't all supposed to enjoy the
[1:42:47] same thing
[1:42:49] he made plans for somebody to enjoy he
[1:42:51] made deserts for somebody enjoy he made
[1:42:52] mountains for somebody to enjoy
[1:42:54] he made lakes and oceans and water for
[1:42:56] somebody to enjoy
[1:42:58] he made prairies for somebody to enjoy
[1:43:00] do you understand he made it because he
[1:43:02] knew what characteristic
[1:43:03] that he would come in as children and
[1:43:06] they're not all supposed to be the same
[1:43:11] my wife she likes it where she can see
[1:43:13] forever
[1:43:15] i like to be in the holler in the midst
[1:43:17] of the trees all hidden in
[1:43:20] she likes to be up where she can see for
[1:43:24] we have two different likes
[1:43:27] but i like mine better
[1:43:31] but you can't fake it it's either there
[1:43:34] it's not and god created this world
[1:43:36] because of the nature we'd come with
[1:43:39] if he did that on the planet
[1:43:44] if he constructed this planet in a
[1:43:47] certain way
[1:43:48] and let volcanoes erupt here and
[1:43:50] glaciers move here
[1:43:54] just because his expressed attributes
[1:43:56] would like it one way or another
[1:43:58] if he could orchestrate the entire
[1:44:00] planet
[1:44:02] to match the nature of his children what
[1:44:04] about your daily life
[1:44:08] what about the things that are happening
[1:44:09] all around you they're all there for a
[1:44:12] reason
[1:44:13] god has something he wants to be
[1:44:18] expressed
[1:44:21] he says in the identified masterpiece of
[1:44:23] god from 64.
[1:44:25] he has a purpose in your life
[1:44:28] each individual
[1:44:31] can you believe that i mean really
[1:44:34] believe it
[1:44:35] like don't believe that each individual
[1:44:37] is important but believe this
[1:44:39] individual it's easy to say oh yeah
[1:44:42] every individual matters that's not what
[1:44:43] i'm asking you to believe
[1:44:44] i'm asking you to believe that this
[1:44:45] individual you yourself
[1:44:47] he's chosen me he's ordained me he's
[1:44:50] placed me
[1:44:51] i'm one of his attributes me as an
[1:44:53] individual
[1:44:54] is what he wants and he has a purpose in
[1:44:57] your life each individual that no
[1:44:59] one else on the face of the earth can
[1:45:01] take your place
[1:45:04] do you see why this matters so much it
[1:45:06] matters what we do it matters where we
[1:45:08] go
[1:45:08] it matters what assembly we're in
[1:45:12] i mean we don't just pick churches in
[1:45:13] the mini mighty mode because god has
[1:45:14] something to express through that
[1:45:16] individual
[1:45:16] and he has a place for that individual
[1:45:20] and we have to be led by god where's my
[1:45:22] place where do you want me
[1:45:24] where do you want this expression to fit
[1:45:26] into a body to bring greater life to the
[1:45:28] body
[1:45:32] he has a purpose in your life each
[1:45:33] individual no one else on the face
[1:45:34] either can take your place
[1:45:36] god has got something for you you're
[1:45:38] made like that you just did that way for
[1:45:40] a purpose
[1:45:41] god is sovereign in his work he thinks
[1:45:43] different
[1:45:44] we're different one from another notice
[1:45:47] in the animal life we find out the
[1:45:48] animal life there's one animal god made
[1:45:50] a beast of burden like the horse
[1:45:51] and he has to work and the cows are
[1:45:53] sacrificed and the lion and the tiger
[1:45:55] roams the forest
[1:45:56] without any labor or anything he made a
[1:45:58] great big animal like an elephant
[1:46:00] and he made a little bitty fella like a
[1:46:01] mouse now who is there to tell god what
[1:46:03] to do and how to do it
[1:46:05] he does it his own way and he makes the
[1:46:08] mountains he makes the deserts he makes
[1:46:10] the seas he makes the planes he makes
[1:46:11] one kind of tree a hardwood
[1:46:13] palm and so forth he does it he makes
[1:46:15] men different he gives us each one a
[1:46:17] different place
[1:46:18] and a palm tree can never be a hickory a
[1:46:20] hickory tree can never be a palm
[1:46:22] nobody can take your place and you
[1:46:24] shouldn't try to take anybody else's
[1:46:25] place
[1:46:27] because you are an individual to god and
[1:46:30] god has a purpose for you
[1:46:31] he made you thus why did he do it he is
[1:46:34] sovereign
[1:46:36] he's got a reason for it being that way
[1:46:38] but we find out that we're all
[1:46:40] guarded by the word in heaven we look at
[1:46:43] the celestial bodies the bible says that
[1:46:45] even one star differs from the other
[1:46:47] there is serious and different ones and
[1:46:49] mars and jupiter and all those different
[1:46:50] ones
[1:46:51] they differ one from the other the sun
[1:46:53] differs from the moon and the moon from
[1:46:54] the stars
[1:46:55] and there's angels such as their
[1:46:56] seraphims and cherubims and angels and
[1:46:58] great angels and degrees
[1:47:00] and even in the new world to come the
[1:47:01] kings of the earth bring their honor
[1:47:03] into the city
[1:47:04] we're always going to be that way
[1:47:10] we're always going to be that way
[1:47:15] do you know what that means when you get
[1:47:17] a body change
[1:47:19] you're still going to be that way
[1:47:23] brother ben said in the millennium we
[1:47:25] got work to do
[1:47:28] we're not just going to sit around we
[1:47:29] got works to do we got jobs to do
[1:47:33] well have you ever seen a work crew with
[1:47:35] everybody has the same job
[1:47:39] we're all hammering on the same nail
[1:47:43] doesn't work this is just a reflection
[1:47:46] of that
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] god is not changing he's got a
[1:47:51] characteristic and a nature in you
[1:47:53] that's not going to change it's just
[1:47:54] going to come to a greater perfection
[1:47:57] it's not going to change greater
[1:47:58] perfection greater maturity more
[1:48:00] perfectly refined but not changed
[1:48:04] and when we go to the millennium we're
[1:48:05] going to recognize each other
[1:48:07] and each other's gifts and watch each
[1:48:08] other work in our gift
[1:48:11] because there's going to be a king on
[1:48:13] the throne that knows the way you're
[1:48:14] wired
[1:48:16] a king on the throne of david earthly
[1:48:18] king earthly throne
[1:48:20] that knows the way you're wired and
[1:48:21] knows what he built you for and knows
[1:48:23] what you're supposed to express
[1:48:24] and he's the one giving out the work
[1:48:26] assignments
[1:48:28] and when he hands you your work
[1:48:29] assignment something in you says oh
[1:48:32] i've always wanted to do this
[1:48:35] it's not work it's not labor it's not a
[1:48:38] drudgery it's not a punishment
[1:48:40] amen he's given you something that
[1:48:42] exactly matches the way he built you
[1:48:44] inside
[1:48:44] and when those two things come together
[1:48:46] you're like oh i'm so excited
[1:48:48] i can't wait to do it there's going to
[1:48:51] be no work assignment on that day says
[1:48:53] oh
[1:48:54] jesus do i have to
[1:49:00] why should we act that way now
[1:49:04] [Applause]
[1:49:06] if we're acting that way now maybe we
[1:49:08] haven't found our place yet
[1:49:11] maybe we need to pray and say god you've
[1:49:14] built me for a reason
[1:49:16] and there's a purpose in my life and you
[1:49:19] purposed it
[1:49:20] and you ordained for me to do certain
[1:49:22] works before the foundational world i'm
[1:49:24] here lord
[1:49:24] make me sensitive to your spirit reveal
[1:49:26] to me what you want me to do
[1:49:28] lord let me tune me into your program
[1:49:30] from my life and your purpose
[1:49:31] have your way have preeminence
[1:49:38] we're never going to get away from that
[1:49:39] word preeminence this is the season for
[1:49:41] full preeminence
[1:49:43] it affects everything
[1:49:51] cherubims and angels and great angels
[1:49:53] are all different we're always going to
[1:49:55] be that way
[1:49:56] because god is not a sears and roebuck
[1:49:57] harmony house he's a god of variety
[1:50:00] he makes one one way and one another but
[1:50:02] we must serve him in the way that
[1:50:04] god made us
[1:50:08] and be glad and stay behind his word and
[1:50:11] that's the way god did it
[1:50:15] letting off the pressure in 1963 now god
[1:50:18] created the creation is expressing
[1:50:20] himself back in creation
[1:50:21] and he's not a god just of one solid
[1:50:23] sears and roebuck harmony house
[1:50:24] he's a god of variety he makes big hills
[1:50:26] little hills he makes deserts he makes
[1:50:28] lakes he makes little trees big trees
[1:50:30] white flowers red flowers
[1:50:31] makes little men big men red-headed
[1:50:33] women black-headed women
[1:50:38] if you're little don't ask to be tall if
[1:50:41] you're tall don't ask to be little
[1:50:43] god knows what he's doing
[1:50:46] because he's the god of rhine and he
[1:50:48] makes some rich and some poor
[1:50:55] he makes some rich and some poor
[1:51:01] everybody's trying to get rich don't
[1:51:04] god's the only one who can make you rich
[1:51:06] he makes some rich some poor some in
[1:51:09] between
[1:51:11] but we got a place to serve god and
[1:51:14] that's the place that he's placed us
[1:51:15] in if we'll just abide in that place
[1:51:23] the prophet of god says according that
[1:51:26] he has
[1:51:27] chosen chosen us
[1:51:30] in him who done the choosing god did you
[1:51:34] didn't
[1:51:34] i didn't god did you haven't chosen me
[1:51:37] but i've chose you said jesus
[1:51:39] according he has chosen us in him chosen
[1:51:42] us the elected now the ones that's
[1:51:44] in christ jesus he chose us in him when
[1:51:47] yesterday the day before listen at the
[1:51:49] scriptures
[1:51:50] before the foundation of the world
[1:51:53] i'm surely not reading that wrong that's
[1:51:55] the way it reads here in the king james
[1:51:57] version
[1:51:57] god chose you in christ before the
[1:51:59] foundation of the world was ever laid
[1:52:01] then if god knew that what are you
[1:52:04] scared about
[1:52:07] if i could wrap up everything i've said
[1:52:10] into these last couple of minutes
[1:52:12] what are you scared about
[1:52:16] if you believe the things that we preach
[1:52:18] if you believe what the prophet said and
[1:52:20] you believe the preaching today
[1:52:21] what are you scared about
[1:52:26] if god knew way back before the
[1:52:28] foundation the world to choose you in
[1:52:29] christ
[1:52:30] and you come and accepted the call what
[1:52:32] you scared about
[1:52:35] if something in you heard the eagle
[1:52:36] scream and jumped up to meet it in the
[1:52:39] air and knew it was the truth
[1:52:40] amen what are you scared about you know
[1:52:44] you couldn't have recognized that was
[1:52:45] eagle food
[1:52:46] unless you heard from your theophany if
[1:52:48] you heard from the authority you have a
[1:52:50] theophany an eternal body in the heavens
[1:52:53] what are you scared about there's now no
[1:52:55] more fear i heard the eagle scream
[1:52:57] i knew what it was whatever it screamed
[1:52:59] resonated solid in my heart and i rose
[1:53:02] up to meet it in the air
[1:53:03] hey praise god there's nothing to be
[1:53:05] scared about
[1:53:14] first john 4 17 hearing is our love made
[1:53:17] perfect
[1:53:19] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:53:20] judgment because as he is
[1:53:23] so are we in this world
[1:53:26] this is how our love is made perfect
[1:53:30] because as he is in the world so are we
[1:53:36] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:53:39] love
[1:53:39] cast out fear because fear hath torment
[1:53:43] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:53:45] love
[1:53:46] we love him because he first loved us
[1:53:51] perfect love cast out all fear but you
[1:53:54] have to know
[1:53:56] that you love him because he first loved
[1:53:58] you
[1:53:59] and chose you and ordained you and
[1:54:02] fashioned you
[1:54:04] and placed you
[1:54:08] message gyrus and divine healing the
[1:54:10] prophet said perfect love cast out all
[1:54:12] fear
[1:54:13] love and faith is the same thing
[1:54:19] that's a big statement love and faith is
[1:54:23] the same thing see
[1:54:24] love perfect love cast out all fear
[1:54:27] which gives faith love and faith is the
[1:54:30] same thing
[1:54:32] that's why we can't say oh i love god i
[1:54:34] love god i love god
[1:54:35] but have no faith
[1:54:40] because if we really loved him because
[1:54:41] he first loved us
[1:54:43] if our love for him is a reciprocation
[1:54:45] of his love for us
[1:54:46] it drives out fear why because he first
[1:54:49] loved us
[1:54:50] when before the foundation of the world
[1:54:53] and nothing will defeat his love our
[1:54:55] purpose for us
[1:54:56] what are you scared about i want to say
[1:54:59] nothing
[1:55:01] can your flesh man your spirit realm get
[1:55:03] scared absolutely but there should be
[1:55:04] something inside
[1:55:06] that'll take control something in the
[1:55:08] watchtower that'll take control and say
[1:55:10] no there's nothing to be afraid of i
[1:55:12] will not let fear control me
[1:55:15] because by revelation i know that this
[1:55:18] trial was ordained by god
[1:55:19] and he's built me and positioned me and
[1:55:22] placed me to overcome this
[1:55:25] i've got to have confidence in what he's
[1:55:27] done
[1:55:28] can you have confidence in what he's
[1:55:30] done let's start acting like it
[1:55:33] had to quit being so timid the bride's
[1:55:36] not supposed to be timid
[1:55:38] she's supposed to be confident not
[1:55:41] arrogant
[1:55:42] confident no weapon formed against him
[1:55:47] shall prosper nothing shall happen
[1:55:51] that he didn't first approve
[1:55:54] and he didn't approve it for our
[1:55:56] destruction he approved it for our
[1:55:58] perfection
[1:56:00] nothing's out of kilter with god the
[1:56:02] clock's just ticking right on time
[1:56:05] all these things have to be this way
[1:56:08] you were ordained and placed in a
[1:56:10] certain body of flesh that he watched
[1:56:12] generations over
[1:56:14] to get it molded a certain way for a
[1:56:16] certain expression
[1:56:17] and he brought you forth in a certain
[1:56:18] time and placed in you a certain
[1:56:20] attribute of himself and we don't all
[1:56:22] get the same attribute
[1:56:24] and that attribute was ordained to be
[1:56:27] expressed in that flesh
[1:56:29] in this time under these conditions
[1:56:33] what are we scared about let that drive
[1:56:36] all fear out
[1:56:37] that's perfect love that's a realization
[1:56:41] of what he has done for me man let's all
[1:56:44] stand
[1:56:53] musicians if you don't care to come
[1:56:57] the prophet of god told us
[1:57:02] that when a chime builder a bell maker
[1:57:04] he wants to make these chimes he's got
[1:57:06] to mix the metals
[1:57:08] so much copper and or so much brass and
[1:57:11] so much ten and so much of this
[1:57:13] to get that certain thing and brother
[1:57:16] branham said he did that for you
[1:57:19] he said he bred this one to that one
[1:57:24] i mean this sounds like farming
[1:57:28] he bred this one to that one and this
[1:57:30] one to that one
[1:57:31] to get you just a certain way so that in
[1:57:34] his great symphony
[1:57:36] you've got that certain thing
[1:57:40] and you might ting all the time or you
[1:57:42] might ting occasionally
[1:57:43] but nobody else can play the note you
[1:57:45] ordain to play in the part you're
[1:57:47] ordained to play
[1:57:48] brother bam said like the great symphony
[1:57:50] amen you might stand there with that
[1:57:52] symbol
[1:57:53] and he which waits and he reads the
[1:57:54] sheet music and he waits the man waits
[1:57:55] and he waits and waits finally gets his
[1:57:57] part
[1:57:57] bang and that's the only thing he does
[1:58:01] but it's an instrumental part of the
[1:58:03] program and it was written in there by
[1:58:04] the conductor and
[1:58:05] somebody's got to do it
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:08] and if god called us to do it let's do
[1:58:10] it with our whole heart
[1:58:11] if i if i'm just here for one specific
[1:58:14] thing and if i'm just here to do one
[1:58:15] little thing if i'm just here for this
[1:58:17] one little part in the body
[1:58:18] let's give our whole heart to it let's
[1:58:20] stay with the music let's stay with the
[1:58:22] program
[1:58:22] let's stay engaged with what everything
[1:58:24] else is happening so when it comes time
[1:58:26] we can bang oh that sounds good
[1:58:32] we've got to stay in our position don't
[1:58:34] get out of position
[1:58:36] don't don't get distracted by the world
[1:58:38] don't start playing around with worldly
[1:58:40] things and entertainment
[1:58:41] don't don't don't just get distracted
[1:58:43] and all of a sudden wednesday's not so
[1:58:45] good i'm tired and i'm a little too busy
[1:58:47] and
[1:58:47] don't get distracted now's the time to
[1:58:49] pay attention
[1:58:51] god put us here for a purpose to be
[1:58:53] conformed into this image of his dear
[1:58:54] son
[1:58:56] to play our part i say let's have faith
[1:58:58] in what he's done
[1:59:01] he said i have no faith in myself do you
[1:59:03] have faith in him
[1:59:06] if you have faith in him then you have
[1:59:07] faith in the place he puts you in the
[1:59:10] body he puts you
[1:59:11] with the nature he placed in you
[1:59:14] i hate myself don't say anything like
[1:59:16] that don't ever say that
[1:59:20] god made it the way he wants it i wish i
[1:59:23] was different don't ever say that
[1:59:25] you can say i wish i was more
[1:59:27] surrendered
[1:59:29] you said i wish i was more under his
[1:59:30] control i wish i was more sensitive to
[1:59:32] spirit
[1:59:32] you can say all of those things but
[1:59:34] don't say what the word doesn't say
[1:59:38] start to embrace what god's done and
[1:59:40] have faith in it and walk in faith and
[1:59:42] confidence
[1:59:43] i think so many times we don't express
[1:59:45] what god wants to express
[1:59:46] it's because we're timid because we
[1:59:48] don't have faith in the way he's made us
[1:59:52] how many times have you felt to say
[1:59:53] something but you held back
[1:59:56] and later you regretted it you knew you
[1:59:58] missed something
[1:59:59] how many times does that happen
[2:00:03] how many times have you felt to say
[2:00:05] something to somebody or encourage
[2:00:06] somebody or write to somebody
[2:00:08] and then a week or two later you find
[2:00:09] out that something happened to them
[2:00:12] and you knew you missed it what is it we
[2:00:14] don't have confidence in the way he made
[2:00:16] us
[2:00:17] that nature that he put on us if we're
[2:00:19] tuned into god and we're living for god
[2:00:21] it's a natural expression and when those
[2:00:23] things come we've got to start acting on
[2:00:24] them
[2:00:25] because they're here not for you they're
[2:00:26] here for the body
[2:00:28] we've got to start having faith in the
[2:00:30] way he's made us and act on those things
[2:00:32] when he moves you to write what he moves
[2:00:33] you to say when he moves you to visit
[2:00:35] just do it we're so
[2:00:39] timid because we got such a concept from
[2:00:42] the world that we're wrong
[2:00:43] and somehow can't be right and somehow
[2:00:45] there's something wrong with us
[2:00:47] that's not the what the word of god says
[2:00:49] we've got to get comfortable
[2:00:51] i say like this we got to get
[2:00:52] comfortable in the skin he's put us in
[2:00:58] not confidence in the flesh but
[2:00:59] confidence in god who orchestrated the
[2:01:02] flesh
[2:01:03] who gave you a certain nature to express
[2:01:06] a certain thing and start to believe
[2:01:08] that god can actually use you
[2:01:11] that that thought you had was actually
[2:01:13] inspiration of the holy ghost
[2:01:15] that that little desire you had to do
[2:01:17] that for that brother
[2:01:18] or give a gift or write a note or go
[2:01:21] visit somebody
[2:01:22] that little desire that you had was
[2:01:23] actually the holy ghost moving in your
[2:01:25] life
[2:01:26] you got to actually believe it and if
[2:01:28] you believe it and we all believe it and
[2:01:30] we all start operating by the leadership
[2:01:32] of god
[2:01:32] you're going to see a mighty marching
[2:01:34] army moving forward unstoppable and
[2:01:36] invincible
[2:01:38] because everything's turning
[2:01:39] everything's moving the way it should
[2:01:42] say relax everything's okay
[2:01:46] don't be scared and don't be afraid of
[2:01:49] making a mistake
[2:01:54] don't be afraid of making a mistake
[2:01:58] i'd rather make a mistake once in a
[2:01:59] while than do nothing
[2:02:04] i'd rather god i make a mistake and god
[2:02:07] have to correct me and put me back on
[2:02:08] track than to sit in my seat and never
[2:02:10] have done nothing for the lord
[2:02:13] let's be in motion and let god do
[2:02:15] something
[2:02:16] let god work with us according to our
[2:02:18] temperament according to our makeup
[2:02:20] according to the nature he gave us
[2:02:22] you've got a
[2:02:23] certain element a certain attribute that
[2:02:27] only you can express
[2:02:29] don't wait for somebody else to do it if
[2:02:31] the inspiration strikes you
[2:02:33] don't wait for somebody else to do it
[2:02:35] you're wired
[2:02:36] like nobody else is wired do you believe
[2:02:40] that
[2:02:41] accept it by faith and learn to operate
[2:02:44] in them
[2:02:45] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[2:02:48] you lord for this day
[2:02:50] we thank you for the words that you
[2:02:52] spoke to us lord and god my prayers is
[2:02:54] more than words
[2:02:56] it's more than a sermon lord but it
[2:02:58] becomes our life
[2:03:00] because this is the hour for full
[2:03:01] expression this is the hour for
[2:03:03] manifestation
[2:03:04] this is not the time to do things the
[2:03:06] way they were done before
[2:03:07] but this is a time for every joint to
[2:03:09] supply
[2:03:11] god help us to be what you've called us
[2:03:13] to be help us to be
[2:03:15] in the image you've called us to be in
[2:03:17] help us to display what you want us to
[2:03:19] display
[2:03:20] god i surrender to you and i ask that
[2:03:22] you would just do what only you can do
[2:03:24] god we give ourselves afresh to you and
[2:03:27] forgive us lord for the negative
[2:03:29] thoughts we've had of ourselves
[2:03:31] forgive us lord for downplaying or or
[2:03:33] trivializing something that you've done
[2:03:35] in us
[2:03:36] god i pray that you would move all your
[2:03:38] bride above the
[2:03:40] false notions above the wrong teaching
[2:03:43] knowing that you would move us all
[2:03:44] above the complexes that were placed in
[2:03:46] our lives and bring us into that full
[2:03:49] expression that you ordained before the
[2:03:50] foundation of the world
[2:03:52] help us to be tied in with you cut off
[2:03:55] from the world
[2:03:56] and the influences of the world and let
[2:03:57] us be tied into you to move by the
[2:03:59] moving of your spirit
[2:04:01] we ask it lord in jesus christ's name
[2:04:05] we love you god and we ask that you and
