[0:12] Well, since I saw my name in the book of

[5:09] Amen. It's good to be with you this
[5:11] morning. Let's go to the key of F.
[5:13] Washed by the water.
[5:15] Do you know what it is not to have one
[5:20] guilty feeling? Not to wonder where
[5:23] you're going when you die.
[5:27] Not condemned by the past. Not afraid of
[5:31] what tomorrow holds in store and know
[5:34] the reason why.
[5:38] Yes, that's just how it is when you go
[5:41] down in the water. For by faith you
[5:45] believe in what you've heard.
[5:48] It's no impossible dream. You can start
[5:53] over clean
[5:55] when you're washed by the water of the
[5:58] word.
[6:01] Are you wash
[6:03] by the water?
[6:07] Washed by the water of the word.
[6:11] Are you washed
[6:14] by the water?
[6:17] Washed by the water of the word.
[6:22] It's like being born again with a whole
[6:26] new life to live, never having to look
[6:29] back to what you've been.
[6:33] Cuz according to the Lord, you become a
[6:37] new creation. And where he's concerned,
[6:40] there never was no sin.
[6:43] For when God looks at you, he no longer
[6:47] sees a sinner but a saint who's been
[6:51] washed white as snow.
[6:54] Not by anything we've done. By the blood
[6:58] of God's own son.
[7:01] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[7:06] Yes, I'm washed
[7:09] by the water.
[7:12] Washed by the water of the word.
[7:17] Yes, I'm washed
[7:19] by the water.
[7:23] Washed by the water of the word.
[7:27] It's like being born again with a whole
[7:31] new life to live. Never having to look
[7:34] back to what you've been.
[7:38] Because according to the Lord, you've
[7:41] become a new creation. And where he's
[7:44] concerned, there never was no sin.
[7:49] For when God looks at you, he no longer
[7:52] see the sinner by the saint who's been
[7:56] washed white as snow.
[7:59] Not by anything we've done, by the blood
[8:03] of God's own son.
[8:06] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[8:10] Yes, I'm washed. Yes, I'm washed
[8:14] by the water.
[8:17] Washed by the water of the word.
[8:22] I am washed
[8:25] by the water.
[8:27] [Music]
[8:28] Washed by the water of just your voices.
[8:32] Yes, I'm washed
[8:35] by the water.
[8:38] Washed by the water of the word.
[8:43] I am washed
[8:46] by the water.
[8:48] [Music]
[8:49] Washed by the water of the word once
[8:52] more. So glad I'm washed
[8:57] by the water.
[8:59] [Music]
[9:00] Washed by the water of the word
[9:05] that I'm washed
[9:07] by the water.
[9:10] I'm walk by the water of the word.
[9:15] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[9:17] offering of praise. So thankful that
[9:19] he's washed us by the water.
[9:22] Amen.
[9:27] He wasn't looking at me
[9:32] when he took me in.
[9:36] He wasn't looking at my heart
[9:41] that was black by sin.
[9:45] He was looking at the blood
[9:50] flowing rich and free.
[9:54] That precious blood
[9:59] that covers me.
[10:03] He wasn't looking at me
[10:08] when he took me in.
[10:12] He wasn't looking at my heart
[10:17] that was black by sin.
[10:21] He was looking at the mud
[10:25] flowing rich and free.
[10:30] That precious blood
[10:34] that covers me.
[10:40] Through it all.
[10:44] Through it all,
[10:49] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[10:54] I've learned to trust in God.
[11:00] Through it all,
[11:05] through it all,
[11:09] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[11:16] Verse one,
[11:18] [Music]
[11:20] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[11:26] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[11:30] And there have been times I didn't know
[11:33] right from wrong.
[11:39] But in every situation,
[11:44] God gave blessed consolation
[11:48] that my trials came to only make me
[11:53] strong.
[11:58] Through it all,
[12:03] through it all,
[12:07] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[12:12] I've learned to trust in God.
[12:17] Through it all,
[12:21] through it all,
[12:26] I learn to depend upon his word.
[12:34] [Music]
[12:35] I thank God for the mountains
[12:39] and I thank him for the valleys.
[12:44] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[12:48] me through.
[12:53] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[12:59] know that he can solve them. I'd never
[13:04] know what faith in God can do. Through
[13:09] it all,
[13:12] through it all.
[13:16] Through it all,
[13:20] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[13:24] I learn to trust in God.
[13:29] Through it all,
[13:34] through it all,
[13:38] I learn to depend upon.
[13:43] Verse three,
[13:47] I thank God for the mountains
[13:51] and I thank him for the valleyies.
[13:55] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[13:59] me through.
[14:04] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[14:09] know that he could solve them, I'd never
[14:14] know what faith in God could do.
[14:21] Through it all,
[14:25] through it all,
[14:29] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[14:34] I learn to trust in God.
[14:38] Through it all,
[14:42] through it all,
[14:46] I learn to depend on his word.
[14:55] Let
[14:57] me walk with you, Jesus.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:05] Never
[15:07] leave me alone.
[15:14] Without
[15:15] you, I
[15:18] could never
[15:20] [Music]
[15:23] never make heaven
[15:27] my home.
[15:32] I've been on the mountain with Jesus.
[15:41] I've been in the valley
[15:45] so low.
[15:48] [Music]
[15:49] But not one time has he ever failed me.
[15:58] went to him with my burdens. I go, "Let
[16:04] me walk.
[16:08] Let me walk with you, Jesus.
[16:17] Never
[16:19] leave me alone.
[16:25] Without
[16:27] you, I could never.
[16:34] I'll never make heaven my home. I know
[16:40] that you'll walk.
[16:42] I know that you'll walk with me, Jesus.
[16:50] And you'll never
[16:53] leave me alone.
[16:59] For without
[17:01] you, I could never
[17:07] [Music]
[17:09] make
[17:11] my home.
[17:17] I was born
[17:20] to be
[17:23] a dwelling
[17:27] place,
[17:30] a home
[17:32] for the presence of the Lord.
[17:42] And my life
[17:46] now be
[17:49] separated
[17:52] unto thee,
[17:55] that I might be
[17:58] what I was born
[18:02] to be.
[18:07] For I was born
[18:11] to be
[18:13] [Music]
[18:15] a dwelling
[18:19] place,
[18:21] a home for the presence
[18:26] of the Lord.
[18:33] Let my life
[18:37] now be
[18:40] separated
[18:42] unto thee,
[18:46] that I might be
[18:49] what I was born
[18:53] to thee.
[18:57] Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen.
[19:00] And as we go to prayer, I wanted to uh
[19:02] remind you that brother Benjamin Seabold
[19:04] is away ministering. He's over in
[19:06] Pittsburgh ministering for brother John
[19:08] Kadima this morning. And then also
[19:10] brother Kyle Wer is across town
[19:11] ministering for Bible believers. So as
[19:13] we pray for this service, we want to
[19:15] remember our brothers away ministering
[19:16] as well. Let's bow our heads together.
[19:20] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[19:22] Father, for your grace in our lives.
[19:24] Lord, we're so thankful that you've
[19:26] brought us together once again to hear
[19:28] your word. And God, may we never tire of
[19:31] you revealing yourself to us. May it
[19:34] never become common to us, but may each
[19:36] opportunity be a blessing. Lord, we've
[19:38] come, Lord, to just open our hearts to
[19:40] receive you, Lord. May you come and
[19:43] Lord, plant your seed deep in our
[19:44] hearts, Lord. And may you produce, Lord,
[19:47] the crop that you desire from this word,
[19:50] Lord. I pray you take control of my
[19:52] mouth, Lord, this vessel. May it be used
[19:54] for your glory. May you grant us all
[19:56] ears to hear and our heart to perceive
[19:58] all that you're sharing with us. Lord,
[20:01] bless our brothers who are away
[20:02] ministering, Brother Benjamin, Brother
[20:04] Kyle. May you anoint them and inspire
[20:06] them and bless the services and the
[20:08] congregations that are gathered in those
[20:09] places. And God, may your work be done,
[20:12] Lord, in your bride. And may we come to
[20:14] reflect you and only you in this world.
[20:16] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name we
[20:19] pray. Amen.
[20:21] Amen. God bless you. While you're
[20:23] standing, if you'll grab your Bibles and
[20:25] turn with me to Genesis chapter 1. We're
[20:28] going to continue on with the uh same
[20:31] thought as we were we started on uh
[20:33] Wednesday. Um I hope you brought your
[20:37] booklets.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take a few services.
[20:40] We have some more if you need them. The
[20:41] deacons have some at their seats.
[20:43] There's some out and the four. If you
[20:44] need to grab another one, feel free to.
[20:46] But if you don't mind, just tuck it in
[20:48] your Bible for the next few services. Uh
[20:50] because it might take us a couple to get
[20:52] through it. Amen. I thought it would be
[20:53] like a quick reading, but it's like
[20:55] anything else that God gives. Amen.
[20:57] Everything is packed so full of meaning
[20:59] and we we want all that we can get out
[21:01] of it. Amen. And we realize that as time
[21:03] goes on, God keeps revealing more and
[21:06] more and more. So we can go through this
[21:08] now. We can come back two years from now
[21:09] and we can go through it all over again.
[21:11] That's what I love about the word of
[21:13] God. It's eternal. Amen.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also wanted to remind you that
[21:18] I'll be uh I and my family will be
[21:20] leaving this Thursday on our vacation.
[21:22] So, I'm planning on preaching Wednesday
[21:24] night and then we'll uh be heading out
[21:26] early Thursday morning. Uh while I'm
[21:28] gone, that first Sunday on the 17th,
[21:30] Brother Gabe Smith will be preaching uh
[21:33] for us here. As of right now, the
[21:34] Wednesday service is cancelled because
[21:36] of the projector project when they're
[21:38] redoing the projectors here in the
[21:40] sanctuary. And then the following
[21:42] Sunday, Brother Chris T will be taking
[21:44] the service for us. So, if you could
[21:46] just keep all of that in prayer, the
[21:47] project, the brothers, the services, and
[21:50] our family. Amen. Just just pray that uh
[21:54] that it all goes smoothly. Amen. Also,
[21:57] we want to welcome some visitors. We got
[21:58] a few visitors here. We just want to say
[21:59] God bless you. Amen. The Ley family has
[22:02] some relatives here. God bless you. It's
[22:03] good to have you here. And Sister Kay
[22:05] Yesi has her family with her. God bless
[22:07] you. It's good to have you all here as
[22:09] well. Amen. Well, let's turn to Genesis
[22:12] chapter 1
[22:14] and let's look at uh verse 9. We read
[22:17] this last time. We're going to read a
[22:19] shorter portion, but we know that uh
[22:22] brother Brandham when he come to the
[22:23] message spoken word is the original
[22:25] seed. His opening scripture was Genesis
[22:27] 1 1-13. But we're going to pick it up
[22:30] here in verse 9.
[22:32] And God said, "Let the waters under the
[22:34] heaven be gathered together unto one
[22:36] place, and let the dry land appear." And
[22:38] it was so. And God called the dry land
[22:41] earth, and the gathering together the
[22:43] waters called he sees. And God saw that
[22:45] it was good. And God said, "Let the
[22:48] earth bring forth grass, the herb
[22:49] yielding seed, and the fruit tree
[22:51] yielding fruit after his kind, whose
[22:53] seed is in itself upon the earth." And
[22:56] it was so. And the earth brought forth
[22:58] grass, and the herb yielding seed after
[23:00] its kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
[23:02] whose seed was in itself after his kind.
[23:05] And God saw that it was good. And the
[23:07] evening and the morning were the third
[23:09] day. Amen. God bless you as you have
[23:11] your seats. And may God bless us as we
[23:14] look at his word and give us eyes to see
[23:17] and ears to hear. Amen.
[23:20] It's amazing how his word has not
[23:22] changed for hundreds and thousands of
[23:25] years. It's stayed ever the same in in
[23:28] the Bible. It's been passed down from
[23:29] generation to generation. So, it's not
[23:32] that we need God to uh somehow anoint
[23:35] his word. His word's already anointed.
[23:37] It's perfect. God needs to anoint our
[23:39] eyes. Amen. Our understanding to see
[23:41] what's already laying there. So, we just
[23:43] pray that God would do that for us and
[23:45] give us understanding. If we could go
[23:47] ahead and bring up the PowerPoint. We're
[23:49] going to continue on. Keep your
[23:51] notebooks handy. Keep your Bibles in and
[23:53] these little booklets handy. And we're
[23:54] going to bounce around between those
[23:56] things uh together. Uh just as a little
[24:00] bit of a a recap, uh we're going to go
[24:04] into the section from the message where
[24:06] brother Brandham was told by the Holy
[24:08] Spirit to pick up his pen and write. And
[24:11] and we know if we if we read the
[24:13] message, spoken word is the original
[24:15] seed. We know brother Brandham was
[24:17] struggling with something. He didn't
[24:18] know what the next step was. He's come
[24:20] to a transition in the ministry and a
[24:22] transition in time. And he and he's
[24:25] asking the Lord, "What do I We're going
[24:26] to read some of those quotes like we did
[24:28] last time. And that that is the
[24:30] background for pick up your pen and
[24:32] write. And I think it's really important
[24:33] to understand the background because if
[24:35] we know what the prophet was questioning
[24:37] and what he needed and what he was
[24:38] desiring and what he was praying and
[24:41] what spoken word of the original seed is
[24:43] all about, then we understand what the
[24:45] Holy Spirit was trying to say. Amen. And
[24:47] pick up your pen and write. And like I
[24:49] said before, we've taken quotes from
[24:51] this. We've read it. We we've enjoyed
[24:53] it. uh we we we've we've preached on
[24:55] parts of it, but I just had a desire in
[24:58] my heart to go through the whole thing
[24:59] again. And as I did, I started realizing
[25:02] it's such a special special message that
[25:04] God gave to us through the prophet. And
[25:06] I just want to slow down and look at it.
[25:08] Amen. And then maybe circle back around,
[25:10] look at it again. I don't know. But I
[25:12] just I thank God for everything that
[25:14] he's given to us.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother Benham here is in
[25:18] coming into 1962,
[25:21] like I said before, 1962 is a pivotal
[25:24] year in his ministry. It marks a change.
[25:27] It it's it's we're coming in we're
[25:30] coming in as the bride of Jesus Christ
[25:32] into a dispensational change. We're
[25:34] coming into the finishing up of the
[25:36] denominational age and the church ages
[25:38] and the ushering forth of the bride age
[25:40] where brother Ram is getting ready to
[25:41] move into his real commission to his
[25:43] real calling as a prophet and the
[25:45] opening of the seals. Amen. And he says
[25:47] all of these things but in 1962 he
[25:50] starts to sense that there's a change
[25:52] coming and he starts to preach in spoken
[25:54] word is the original seed about this
[25:56] change coming. And I think it's
[25:58] remarkable that this message uh spoken
[26:01] word is the original seed is a six-hour
[26:04] sermon. Brother M calls it one sermon,
[26:06] but he had to split it into two parts,
[26:07] morning and night, so everybody could
[26:09] break for lunch and come back, but it
[26:11] was one continuous thought. These are
[26:12] not two separate sermons. They were two
[26:14] parts to the same sermon. Amen. The
[26:16] spoken word is the original seed. And he
[26:18] comes back uh to Genesis 1. And it's
[26:21] amazing when he's going to preach this
[26:23] message, this pivotal message. He goes
[26:25] right back to the beginning in Genesis,
[26:27] the seed book of the whole Bible and
[26:29] through the original chapter, and he
[26:30] starts to show God laid down a
[26:32] principle. And that principle was that a
[26:34] seed must bring forth after its kind and
[26:36] can only bring forth after its kind.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the title is the spoken
[26:42] word is the original seed. So what's the
[26:45] original seed? God's spoken word. That's
[26:47] the original. Everything was made by
[26:49] God's spoken word. Everything that we
[26:51] see, everything we interact with is
[26:53] God's spoken word on display.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, now remember,
[26:58] every spoken word of God is the original
[27:01] seed. God planted everything in the
[27:04] earth by his word, and as long as you
[27:06] stay with the original seed, it will
[27:08] breed itself right back and reproduce
[27:10] itself again. Hybrid, it dies. Oh, it's
[27:14] such a principle. He lays it down right
[27:16] here early in the message. And I hope
[27:18] that that God will help us that realize
[27:20] the principle and stay with it because
[27:23] God's spoken word is the original seed.
[27:25] And remember, every original seed will
[27:27] bring forth after its kind. And it will
[27:29] always reproduce itself again,
[27:30] perpetuate on and on and on and on and
[27:32] on. Amen. God planted an oak tree how
[27:34] many thousand years ago? And that oak
[27:36] tree keeps perpetuating itself again and
[27:38] again and again. As long as you don't
[27:40] hybrid it, it can breed itself back. And
[27:42] it can continue to be an oak tree. It
[27:44] can be a pear tree. It can be an apple
[27:46] tree. It can be whatever he made it to
[27:48] be. It can continue that way unless you
[27:50] hybrid it. When you hybrid it, you
[27:52] modify it. And as you modify, it can
[27:54] never come back to its original form
[27:56] again.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; This is such a principle that he's
[27:59] laying down. Amen. And it becomes so
[28:01] pivotal that we understand it. I know we
[28:03] understand it, but I don't think we
[28:05] understand it enough.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Help me God to understand it more is my
[28:09] prayer.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] So he says,"Now, oh, I remember sitting
[28:15] there in a room." Oh, praise be to God.
[28:20] I remember sitting there in a room three
[28:22] days in there praying and waiting on the
[28:24] Lord, fasting, when that struck me. I
[28:26] thought, "Oh, God, what is it? Here I am
[28:29] in a picture. Here I am. Here I am. If I
[28:32] bring up this much to the church, where
[28:34] will I be? I'll I'll I'll have them on a
[28:37] limb. What can I do? I've done seen the
[28:39] church as every type and shadow and
[28:42] everything else. She's gone. Show she's
[28:44] gone. What will you do? So, brother
[28:48] Brandham is struggling now. And what's
[28:50] he struggling with? He he is he is
[28:53] saying, God, I realize I see in every
[28:55] type and shadow I see in everything that
[28:57] the church is finished. It's done. And
[28:59] he's talking about the denominational
[29:01] systems, the systems of man. The church
[29:03] system is finished. It can't go any
[29:05] further. and God can't use it anymore to
[29:08] accomplish what he's got wanting to do
[29:10] in this age. And brother Bam comes to
[29:12] that and realizes that and understands
[29:14] it, but he doesn't know what the next
[29:15] step is. And that's what he's asking
[29:17] God, what do I do now? And he says he
[29:19] was praying three days and fasting. Then
[29:22] he says, "We believe we're in the end
[29:25] time. Do we do you believe that before
[29:28] you have a crop now you have to plant a
[29:30] seed? You see why I've let churches turn
[29:33] me out? Tell me everything. Call me all
[29:36] kinds of names, everything else, and
[29:38] just stay right with that word. See,
[29:40] there's a plant. A seed's been planted.
[29:44] Seed been planted. It's already been
[29:46] planted, friend. It's already done. I
[29:48] can say it now. It's over, right? She's
[29:51] done. Been planted. Oh, yeah. So is
[29:53] denominational seed. All the rest of
[29:56] them. And brother starts showing us. And
[29:58] and this is all review from Wednesday,
[30:00] but please bear with me as I review.
[30:02] Amen. Because the review is fun, too.
[30:04] Amen.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the truth. Amen. So, as as we s
[30:09] saw, there was a great revival that
[30:11] struck America post World War II and
[30:13] that revival. Amen. Brother Brandham was
[30:15] very much the spearhead of that revival,
[30:17] bringing a healing ministry. And there
[30:19] was tent campaigns and tent meetings all
[30:21] over the United States. Amen. And there
[30:23] there was great revivals crisscrossing
[30:25] the country after World War II. Amen.
[30:28] And out of the revival, Amen. There came
[30:30] many prominent men. And brother Bam
[30:32] mentions uh he mentions two of them,
[30:34] Oral Roberts and and Billy Graham,
[30:36] showing that they were the head
[30:37] planters, amen, of the of the
[30:39] evangelical or the denominational group
[30:41] and the Pentecostal group. But brother
[30:43] Brandham himself was criss-crossing the
[30:45] nation, planting another seed. And that
[30:47] seed was a seed of the original word
[30:49] back to what the Bible taught, back to
[30:51] Paul's teaching. Amen. Because he had to
[30:53] tie together all the loose ends. Amen.
[30:56] Before, Amen. he got to the mystery that
[30:58] was hidden inside the white rock. Amen.
[31:01] So that's what he was doing. And brother
[31:03] Bam started in the healing campaign. And
[31:04] remember, he would start by saying, "Now
[31:06] I don't do any teaching. I'm just
[31:08] hearing the other men preach and I just
[31:10] come with a gift." And that's all
[31:12] through 47 and up to 53. But in 1953, he
[31:16] starts saying, "Now I'm going to start
[31:17] teaching because it's not being done."
[31:19] And we have to start teach. And you
[31:20] start seeing, hey, from 53 to 61,
[31:23] Brother Benham's really starting to
[31:25] teach and lay down the word. And he
[31:27] teaches the oneness of God, water
[31:28] baptism in Jesus name. serpent seed and
[31:31] he starts bringing all these truths back
[31:33] to the church. Amen. And starts playing
[31:35] there. He preaches the church ages and
[31:37] he lays them in straight and he shows us
[31:39] the history of the church and where it's
[31:41] got up to this point. And when he come
[31:42] and that's in 1960 towards the end of
[31:44] 1960. Amen. Then he shows us that
[31:47] there's going to be an opening of the
[31:48] seals in the beginning of 1961 and goes
[31:51] to Revelation chapter 4 and Revelation
[31:53] chapter 5. And he stops because he can't
[31:55] go any farther till God brings him into
[31:57] a transition. Right.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; And that's how he moves into 1962.
[32:02] Oh, praise be to God. I thank God that
[32:05] he's recorded this message. He's given
[32:07] it to us and and all of its beauty.
[32:09] Amen. So, we can watch the progression
[32:10] of God and see what God's trying to do.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Now, he comes to this message and now he
[32:18] knows that the seeds have been sown. He
[32:20] said the denominational seed sown, the
[32:22] Pentecostal seed is, as far as
[32:24] denomination goes, is sown. Amen. the
[32:27] evangelical, the Pentecostal is sown. He
[32:30] says, "But the word has been sown."
[32:33] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Now watch what comes
[32:35] next." Amen. It's been sown. Amen.
[32:37] During the the former rain, which is the
[32:40] teaching rain, which is the revival rain
[32:42] that was falling in that period, so that
[32:44] the seed could come and start the
[32:46] growth. Amen. But he said the seed's got
[32:48] to get in under the uh former rain
[32:50] because there's coming a ladder rain
[32:52] that's going to bring it to full
[32:53] harvest, maturity, and finish the full
[32:55] product.
[32:57] that we're not getting into today
[32:59] unless you keep pulling and we'll go
[33:01] right there
[33:02] &gt;&gt; because I'm pretty excited about it.
[33:04] Amen. Because it has everything to do
[33:06] with you and I today.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; So, this is the progression that he's
[33:10] on. And and it's interesting. I'm going
[33:12] to read a couple lengthy quotes to you.
[33:14] So, just keep your mind dialed in. Amen.
[33:17] And and and don't let your mind wander.
[33:20] In 1962, early in February, February 4th
[33:23] of 1962, right at the beginning, Brother
[33:27] Bram comes and says, "We see that
[33:29] astronomers are predicting sometime in
[33:32] this early part of the first part of the
[33:34] month, beginning on the second or the
[33:36] 5th or somewhere along this month, the
[33:38] Indian astronomers predict the world to
[33:40] blow to pieces." And the American
[33:42] newspapers make fun of it. I do not
[33:45] believe the world's going to blow to
[33:46] pieces. But I do say it's wrong to make
[33:48] fun of it because something's fixing to
[33:51] happen one of these days. Something
[33:53] similar to that when the five planets,
[33:55] Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and so forth comes
[33:57] into there. They they never had did it.
[34:00] Oh, they claim maybe 25,000 years ago,
[34:02] but who was back there to know it? I
[34:04] predict that this has a spiritual
[34:06] application. Remember what I'm saying
[34:08] about 1962? Here we are, February 1962.
[34:12] Amen. I I predict that as a spiritual
[34:15] application, I believe it's the coming
[34:19] in of the issue of God that the great
[34:21] revelations of the word will be open
[34:23] during this time.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Was he right?
[34:28] &gt;&gt; This is before Amen. be this is before
[34:32] the vision or the dreams and the vision
[34:33] that send him out west. This is before
[34:35] Amen. the revelation of the seven seals.
[34:37] This is all coming before. So he knows
[34:39] something's coming. He's sitting here
[34:41] sensing it, feeling it, seeing it in
[34:43] every way. But he doesn't know the next
[34:45] step. That's why he's praying to God
[34:47] before pick up your pen and write. But
[34:48] here he comes. This is February,
[34:50] friends. He preaches uh spoken word as
[34:52] the original seed in the middle of March
[34:55] about 6 weeks later after he says this.
[34:58] He says, "I believe it's the coming in
[35:00] of the issue of God. The great
[35:02] revelations of the word will be open
[35:03] during this time." Remember, they claim
[35:05] it was three stars come into their
[35:07] orbits when Jesus was born. And this is
[35:09] five. And five is grace, the number of
[35:12] grace. Three is the number of
[35:14] perfection. Five is the number of grace.
[35:16] Jee su g r a ce f a i t h so forth.
[35:21] Number of grace. God ever sends his
[35:23] power to the church. It'll be his grace.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; It won't be the obedience of the people.
[35:30] And I say I when he says things like
[35:33] that, my heart just jumps. Amen. Because
[35:35] there's no way we could ever be good
[35:36] enough to get this kind of grace or get
[35:38] this kind of power or get what we need
[35:39] in the end time to be what he's
[35:41] prophesied this church will be. But it
[35:43] comes by his grace. Amen. That's why
[35:45] Zerubabel, the ministry of the seventh
[35:47] angel, Amen. brings forth the headstones
[35:49] with shouting of grace. Grace, double
[35:51] grace. Amen. Because it's God's grace to
[35:53] save me. It's God's grace to start the
[35:54] church. It's God's grace that'll finish
[35:56] the church.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the coming of the headstone.
[35:59] The capping off of the church. And it's
[36:01] by grace, not merit, not effort, not
[36:03] intellect, not study, not teaching, but
[36:05] grace.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Isaiah said in the 40th
[36:11] chapter, how cry to Jerusalem and her
[36:13] warfare was over. Yet she was guilty of
[36:15] idolatry, but it was God's grace that
[36:17] was sending it. God, if God sends
[36:19] anything to us, it'll be his grace, not
[36:21] our merits.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; So, it may mean something. I predict
[36:25] that there'll be a change.
[36:28] February 1962.
[36:31] I don't know what it'll be, but I
[36:34] believe it's fixing to happen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; We're on we're right on the eve of it
[36:39] now.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; So then six weeks later, he'll come and
[36:45] he'll preach spoken words, the original
[36:46] seed. And that's what we've been quoting
[36:48] out of. That's where right before the
[36:50] message, he's told to pick up your pen
[36:51] and write. And he has a message from the
[36:53] Holy Spirit uh to the church. And so uh
[36:56] we'll read that. But the next day he
[36:58] preaches on Sunday. I believe it's
[37:00] Sunday uh March 18th. Uh he preaches
[37:04] spoken word the original seed, morning
[37:05] service, evening service. And then after
[37:07] the evening service, he gets in a car
[37:09] and he drives down to Georgia and he has
[37:11] one meeting on Monday in Georgia. And
[37:13] the meeting on Monday in Georgia the
[37:15] next day is the end time sign seed. So
[37:19] he preaches till evening, goes home,
[37:20] does whatever he's got to do. I presume
[37:22] pack, shower, change, I don't know, and
[37:24] get in the car and drive all the way to
[37:26] Tiffan, Georgia. Amen. And then that
[37:28] next evening, Monday evening, he's
[37:30] preaching the end time sign seed.
[37:34] Then he goes and says, "All of his
[37:36] numbers, his numerals of God is perfect,
[37:39] is in perfection." Now three is the
[37:41] number perfection. Just before now, he
[37:43] says, "Listen now close. When the little
[37:46] baby Christ was born, three stars went
[37:48] together and made the one morning star
[37:50] that reflected the coming of an infant
[37:52] Christ a perfect one. Now what's
[37:55] happened? We see a roar in the paper
[37:58] across the television out across the
[38:00] nations where five stars just fell in
[38:02] line with the world. What's five? A
[38:04] number of grace. Every time those stars
[38:06] come, then something happens on earth.
[38:08] What's taking place? Five stars fell in.
[38:11] What is it? An introducing of what?
[38:14] Remember, God says whenever he does
[38:16] something, he'll show signs in the
[38:18] heaven above and on the earth below.
[38:20] Amen. And the stars were given for
[38:21] signs. Amen. And so, it takes a prophet
[38:24] of God to know what the signs are. We
[38:25] can look up there all day long. Amen.
[38:27] And just guess. And in our guessing,
[38:29] we'll get everything wrong. But a
[38:30] prophet of God is the tool that God has
[38:32] used to interpret his word.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Remember, the heavens declare the glory
[38:36] of God. The Bible was first written in
[38:38] the stars.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when what brother man was
[38:44] talking about back when he was in Febru
[38:46] on February 2nd or February 4th when he
[38:49] preached about that that coming that
[38:52] alignment was an alignment of five
[38:54] planets. The five planets that are
[38:56] visible to the naked eye they come into
[38:59] a conjunction they come into an
[39:00] alignment with the sun and the moon and
[39:03] there was a total solar eclipse uh and
[39:06] it all transpired between the 4th and
[39:08] 6th of February. So, fifth being the the
[39:12] center point of that. And and then when
[39:15] I looked it up on the internet just to
[39:16] find out what day it happened, I just
[39:18] typed it in and pulled it up and and
[39:20] they talked about the the the planets,
[39:22] they named them, the sun and the moon
[39:24] all in conjunction and then the solar
[39:26] eclipse. And then they they made a
[39:28] statement. They said some believed that
[39:30] it was the beginning of the end time.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; It was the beginning of the end time,
[39:38] but there's no scientific evidence to
[39:40] back this up.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; I just said, "Praise God." Amen. We
[39:46] don't need scientific evidence to back
[39:48] it up. Amen.
[39:50] Praise be to God. I don't know why that
[39:52] made me so happy.
[39:54] We know a little something the
[39:55] scientists don't know. Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Because God sent a prophet.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wasn't for science. It's
[40:03] not for them to know. It's for you to
[40:05] know.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; So
[40:09] back in the end time sign seed sermon,
[40:12] he says five stars fell in. What was it?
[40:14] An introducing of what?
[40:18] Since then, just look what's taken
[40:19] place. Germany almost washed off the
[40:21] map. Some of the magi said that the
[40:23] world would burst like a watermelon.
[40:25] Every distressful thing's prophesied by
[40:28] them for the last days. Look what's
[40:29] taking place. is England the other day
[40:31] had a storm that blowed away 70,000
[40:33] houses in one day. Disaster everywhere.
[40:35] California, Los Angeles, like to wash
[40:37] into the ocean. What is it? The
[40:39] beginning of sorrows. Earthquakes is
[40:41] picked up everywhere. Why is it five
[40:43] stars come in line? Grace, God's grace.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Benam, it's amazing. There
[40:51] he's talking about judgment, birth
[40:53] painans, uh judgment striking the world.
[40:55] But he says five is grace. Five plants
[40:57] the line grace. It's grace to who grace
[41:00] is given to. It's judgment to the rest
[41:02] of the world.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Grace, God's grace. Now listen what he
[41:08] says. What's happened? An infant church.
[41:13] Then he shouts, "Hallelujah.
[41:15] A bride infancy that the power of God
[41:18] has be to fall on her. She's taking form
[41:21] a bride for this bridegroom." That three
[41:24] stars meant his perfection of the
[41:26] heavenly father of the Trinity.
[41:28] excuse me, becoming one on the earth
[41:30] among us. God's office is becoming one
[41:33] office. What happened now? It's the
[41:36] church of the living God coming together
[41:38] under the word of God and the astronomic
[41:41] heaven is announcing her approach.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Might not believe that, but it's the
[41:46] word just the same. Yes, sir.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; What's happening? I'm closing. I might
[41:54] say this, friends. The church is coming
[41:56] forth. God's going to have a church
[41:58] without spot or wrinkle. And she's
[42:00] predestinated. God said so he would have
[42:02] it. That makes it right. Who's a member?
[42:06] I don't know. I'm trusting to be myself.
[42:08] I'm trusting you're a member. But he's
[42:10] going to have a body without spot or
[42:12] wrinkle. And I believe that these
[42:14] latter-day signs and and things that's
[42:16] happening, every one of them is peeling
[42:17] together to show that Christ is ready to
[42:19] come for his bride. As God in his word
[42:22] made manifest in a man, a perfect man,
[42:25] so is God in his word coming again and
[42:27] making himself manifest in a bride.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Not we'll do like Eve did hybrid it to
[42:34] something else. But the unadulterated
[42:36] word of God will be born into that
[42:37] church and she'll stand like Jesus
[42:39] Christ did with his spirit anointing in
[42:41] his word. Amen. I believe it's the
[42:43] announcing now. It's the announcement
[42:46] now. Amen. So now, brother Ben, oh when
[42:49] I see this, it just thrills my heart.
[42:51] Now I understand spoken word is the
[42:53] original seed. What all he's trying to
[42:55] tell us. And now pick up your pen and
[42:57] write. And then where it goes from
[42:58] there. Amen. Into into the fall. He says
[43:01] the present stage of my ministry and
[43:02] into December of 1962. Says, "Sers, is
[43:05] this the time?"
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's the time. That's what he's
[43:09] showing. This is the end of the time,
[43:11] the end of the ages. It's the
[43:12] transition. It's the dispensational
[43:14] change. Amen. That we've been waiting
[43:16] for. And here we are living in it,
[43:18] friends. And I believe we're living in
[43:20] the tail end of it.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; But this is how it was starting. This is
[43:25] how it was breaking forth. This is how
[43:27] it was ushering out that great
[43:28] transition, that great change.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And God announced it in the heavens
[43:33] above with an alignment of five stars
[43:35] and the sun and the moon and all kinds
[43:37] of news and all all kinds of uh uh uh
[43:40] things happening in the paper. But
[43:41] there's a prophet on God at the time
[43:43] that could point to that sign and say
[43:45] it's just like when Jesus Christ was
[43:47] coming to the earth. There was an
[43:48] announcement in the heavens and that
[43:50] announcement of the heavens was three
[43:51] stars that come into an alignment to
[43:53] announce the birth of Christ on the
[43:55] earth. And now he says now there's five
[43:57] planets come together. Amen. What's it
[43:59] done? He said it's the announcement. Now
[44:01] what's its announcing? The infancy of
[44:04] the bride. There's a bride coming forth
[44:06] out of the church. And what is the
[44:08] bride? It's him in bride form. It's
[44:11] Christ again on the earth in a many
[44:13] membered body. That's the announcement
[44:15] now. This is the transition. No more the
[44:18] church. Now the bride.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; So now that all this is leading up, the
[44:29] spoken word is the original seed. Now
[44:31] he's saying it's planted. It's planted.
[44:33] It's planted. Now see what comes forth.
[44:36] She's finished. It's finished. We're out
[44:38] on a limb. Where do we go from here?
[44:41] Oh, this is how he says it. I got a
[44:44] place here where I got in the spirit. I
[44:47] got the church up to show it and prove
[44:49] it in the word here exactly what's
[44:51] happened all along. And then when I did,
[44:53] I thought, Lord, I got the people
[44:55] standing here now. I'll have them
[44:57] standing there. What can I tell them? I
[44:59] can't predict the future. I can't tell
[45:01] them what to do. What will I do? I'll
[45:03] leave them standing on a limb. I raised
[45:06] up my hand. And I said, "God, I think
[45:08] I'm doing this by your will. I've never
[45:10] did this. Never did before because the
[45:12] seed hadn't been sewed yet." I said,
[45:14] 'Now, I've got I believe it's time for
[45:17] me to say it. But now, what am I going
[45:19] to say now? This is where Brother
[45:22] Benham's at. This is where he's
[45:24] wrestling. This is where he's come to
[45:25] this point that he knows he's preached
[45:27] the church ages. He knows he's in the
[45:29] Leodysian church age. He knows it's the
[45:31] end of time. He knows Christ is on the
[45:32] outside. Amen. Knocking at the door. He
[45:35] knows all of this. He knows it's at the
[45:36] end. He knows he could see the revival.
[45:39] Now he sees the revival dying down. He
[45:41] knows the seed has been sown. He knows
[45:43] now something is going to transition.
[45:45] But he says, "I can't predict the
[45:47] future."
[45:50] That's true. He's a prophet of God, but
[45:53] he as a man can't predict the future.
[45:55] That's God alone.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know the next step. And he's
[46:01] and brother Bam, you can tell by the
[46:02] things he's saying and spoken words, the
[46:04] original seed, he doesn't want to bring
[46:07] the people out on a limb and have
[46:08] nowhere to take them. He doesn't want to
[46:10] get them out and say, "It's finished.
[46:11] It's all done. The revival's dying down.
[46:13] It's all finished. It's dying. The the
[46:15] church is finished." And then now what?
[46:17] Go home and say whatever.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; So this is what he's wrestling with.
[46:21] This is what he's praying to God for.
[46:24] Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; So now,
[46:28] excuse me.
[46:30] So now he comes to the next part. He
[46:33] says, "And just as plain as you hear my
[46:36] voice, something said,"Pick up your pen.
[46:40] I'll read it to you in a minute. And
[46:42] when I got through, there it was, just
[46:44] the answer." I didn't even know what I
[46:46] was writing. Just started writing. And
[46:47] when I got through, I laid the pen down.
[46:50] I looked. I thought, "God have mercy."
[46:52] There it is right there. That's what I'm
[46:54] looking for.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; So that's the significance. This is all
[46:58] the background. We did all this
[46:59] background to bring us to the
[47:00] significance of what we've got written
[47:02] in this little booklet. Amen. So,
[47:03] Brother Benham first brings it to us and
[47:06] spoken word is the original seed. You'll
[47:07] find it right at the end. Amen. At the
[47:09] end of that six-hour sermon, but then he
[47:11] takes that and he and he edits it and he
[47:13] and he puts it in, amen, the uh church
[47:16] age book, the church age book under the
[47:18] Pergeamian church age. So, that's the
[47:19] exer excerpt we clipped out and copied
[47:21] out and put in here because it's a
[47:23] little bit easier to follow. Like I said
[47:25] before, I love the one in spoken words,
[47:27] the original seed. But as brother
[47:28] Benham's going along and reading it, you
[47:30] can tell as he's reading it, he's also
[47:32] injecting a thought like he's he he's
[47:35] saying something and explaining
[47:36] something. And it's hard when you read
[47:37] it to determine what's he reading,
[47:39] what's he explaining. So that's why I I
[47:41] I took the other clip because it's easy
[47:43] for us to distinguish. But I would
[47:45] recommend listening to both.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Listening to the one is spoken, where's
[47:48] the original seed.
[47:51] Amen. So let's open our little booklet.
[47:57] And let's turn to the first page
[48:01] out of the Pergamian church. We read
[48:02] through part of this on Wednesday. I'm
[48:05] just going to skim through it and pick
[48:06] it up where we stopped.
[48:14] One night as I was seeking the Lord, the
[48:16] Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen
[48:18] and write. As I grasped at the pen to
[48:21] write, his spirit gave me a message for
[48:23] the church. I want to bring it to you.
[48:26] It has to do with the word and the
[48:27] bride.
[48:30] Here is what I'm trying to say to you.
[48:33] The law of reproduction is that each
[48:35] species brings forth after its own kind,
[48:38] even according to Genesis 1:1. And God
[48:41] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass
[48:44] and the herb yielding seed, and the
[48:45] fruit tree yielding fruit after its
[48:47] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[48:49] earth." And it was so. Whatever life was
[48:53] in the seed came forth into the plant,
[48:56] and then into fruit. The very same law
[48:58] applies to the church today. Whatever
[49:00] seed started the church will come forth
[49:02] and be like the original seed, because
[49:04] it is the same seed. In these last days,
[49:07] the true bride church, Christ's seed,
[49:09] will come to the headstone, and she will
[49:11] be the super church, a super race as she
[49:14] nears him. They and the bride will be so
[49:17] much like him that they will even be in
[49:20] his very image. This is in order to be
[49:22] united with him. They will be one. They
[49:25] will be the very manifestation of the
[49:27] word of the living God. Now, what was
[49:30] Jesus Christ? He was the very
[49:31] manifestation of the word of the living
[49:33] God. What will his bride be in the end
[49:35] time? The very manifestation of the word
[49:37] of the living God.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh. He was the word
[49:42] made flesh. Amen. And now this bride
[49:44] must also be the word made flesh. That
[49:46] word that's predestinated for this age
[49:48] has to take on flesh in a many membered
[49:51] body. And that's what God's doing now.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Where is he doing it? In you,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; in me and his bride around the world.
[49:59] That's where he's doing it.
[50:03] So now we realize that this true bride,
[50:07] Christ's seed, the true bride is
[50:09] Christ's seed. Remember the principle
[50:11] that he's teaching us, the principle out
[50:13] of Genesis 1 is every seed brings forth
[50:16] after its own kind. So if you do not
[50:18] hybrid it, but you breed it back
[50:19] originally, it will always produce the
[50:22] same thing, the same life, the same
[50:24] characteristics, the same fruits, the
[50:26] same everything will come if you have
[50:28] the original spoken word seed. Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus Christ is that seed.
[50:34] Christ, the anointed word, is that seed.
[50:37] And so now the true bride church. So
[50:39] what's the true bride church? Christ's
[50:41] seed. What is it? She's a continuation
[50:43] of the perpetuation of that life.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; She's original.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; She's original. She's what the church
[50:50] was when it came out of out of the upper
[50:53] room on the day of Pentecost. That was
[50:54] the original virgin bride. And God
[50:57] brought a bride fresh from the hands of
[50:59] God to Christ. Amen. Before she hybrided
[51:01] herself, she was she was perfect. Amen.
[51:04] And God is bring us back to that
[51:05] original seed, the original life, the
[51:08] original word.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Which is Christ's seed. This is the only
[51:13] seed we're worried about. We're not
[51:14] worried about a Jesus Christ seed and a
[51:16] church seed. We're only worried about
[51:18] Christ seed
[51:19] &gt;&gt; and has to bring forth of its own kind.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] And they will come to the headstone. Uh
[51:28] we talked about this last time but will
[51:30] positive affirmative will come to the
[51:33] headstone. Praise be to God.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And she will be in his very image. They
[51:38] will be the very manifestation of the
[51:39] word of the living God. Denominations
[51:41] cannot produce this. Why can
[51:43] denomination not produce this wrong
[51:45] seed? They will produce their creeds and
[51:47] their dogmas mixed with the word. This
[51:49] monger lies brings forth a hybrid
[51:52] product. That's why there's no
[51:54] denominational system going to produce
[51:56] the bride of Christ. That's why he says
[51:58] it's got to change. The church has
[51:59] ceased. The church ages has ceased. God
[52:02] dealing with the two vines in the midst
[52:03] of the church has ceased. Now he's got
[52:05] to bring forth a bride out of that. Come
[52:08] out of her, my people.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Be ye separate and touch not the unclean
[52:12] thing. What is the unclean thing?
[52:14] Idolatry of mixing with man's ideas and
[52:17] hybridizing the word. Come back to the
[52:19] original word. Because there's been a
[52:20] prophet on the scene to bring us back to
[52:22] the full truth of the Bible. We don't
[52:25] have to debate or wonder what Paul meant
[52:26] when he says this or what Peter meant.
[52:28] We've had a prophet, amen, who come back
[52:30] and said, "This is exactly what Paul
[52:32] meant." And look, it's exactly the way
[52:33] it's written. It's exactly the way God
[52:35] gave it
[52:36] &gt;&gt; was the correct way.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; It didn't need scholarship.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; It needed a prophetic voice to bring
[52:43] God's true meaning of the word.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why a denomination can
[52:51] never produce Christ on earth again.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's the wrong seed. They
[53:00] will reproduce their kind
[53:03] &gt;&gt; and their kind is hybrid.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; So it'll keep reproducing hybrid.
[53:09] This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[53:12] product. Now next paragraph.
[53:15] The first son, Adam, was the spoken seed
[53:19] word of God.
[53:21] He was given a bride to reproduce
[53:23] himself. If we look here at Genesis
[53:26] 1:26, it says, "And God said, let us
[53:29] make man in our image, after our
[53:31] likeness, and let them have dominion
[53:33] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[53:34] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[53:36] and over the earth, and over every
[53:37] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[53:39] earth." So man was made in the image of
[53:42] God. He was to be a reflector of the
[53:44] life of God. And God took that man and
[53:47] put him in flesh and was going to give
[53:49] him dominion to rule over all the earth.
[53:53] He was going to be an amateur. Brother
[53:55] Beam calls it an amateur God, a little
[53:57] God, a God over the creation, a God over
[53:59] the earth, reflecting God, his father.
[54:04] And God created man in his own image. In
[54:07] the image of God created he male and
[54:09] female created he them. That's such an
[54:11] important scripture because when God
[54:14] goes to create himself and replicate
[54:16] himself and reflect himself into a life,
[54:18] he makes man, male and female.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But this is the replication of himself.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; So God wants to be expressed this way.
[54:27] Amen. And male and female. And and it
[54:31] says, "And God blessed them. And God
[54:33] said unto them, "Be fruitful, and
[54:35] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[54:38] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[54:40] fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
[54:41] the air, and over every living thing
[54:43] that moveth upon the earth."
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go back to our
[54:48] booklet.
[54:53] He was given a bride to reproduce
[54:55] himself. That is why the bride was given
[54:57] to him, to reproduce himself, to produce
[55:00] another son of God. But she fell. She
[55:03] fell by hybridization. She caused him to
[55:06] die. Remember, every seed can bring
[55:08] forth only bring forth after its kind.
[55:10] When she mingled with the wrong seed,
[55:13] she could never reproduce the perfect
[55:15] seed again.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; It was now hybridized. She was
[55:19] hybridized. She was mingled. She was
[55:21] corrupted. The the perfect womb that now
[55:23] was corrupted and could no longer bring
[55:25] forth the perfect seed again. Amen. So,
[55:28] so now uh that's why she caused Adam to
[55:30] die because Adam could not perpetuate
[55:33] himself. He could not reproduce another
[55:35] son of God because that's what he was
[55:37] supposed to do. Replicate himself
[55:39] another son of God until through Eve
[55:41] would have come the whole family.
[55:43] Brother Benham said Jeremiah would have
[55:44] come through her. Amen. Amen. Isaiah
[55:46] would have come the whole family of God
[55:48] would have been born upon the earth
[55:50] reflecting the life of God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; She supposed to What would that have
[55:54] been? What would have the whole family
[55:56] of God been upon the earth? Christ.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; The anointed word made manifest on the
[56:02] earth. Amen. Christ. Christ's seed.
[56:04] Amen. But because she corrupted herself,
[56:07] she can no longer bring forth the pure
[56:09] Christ seed.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. We're all
[56:13] together. Amen.
[56:16] He says, "Oh no, where am I at?" Yeah, I
[56:19] don't want to go ahead yet.
[56:22] Amen. So
[56:26] the original virgin
[56:29] was Eve
[56:32] &gt;&gt; before she was called Eve.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember when God formed her, he did
[56:37] not name her.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; He called her woman, which is a title,
[56:41] not a name. And but but Genesis chapter
[56:44] 5 says when the day that he created
[56:46] them, created man, he made them male and
[56:48] female, made them, and called their name
[56:50] Adam. So when he made them, their name
[56:51] was Adam. She was Adam. He was Adam
[56:54] because she was an extension of Adam.
[56:56] She came out of Adam. She was part of
[56:58] Adam. She was reunited with Adam. They
[57:00] were one in the mind of God. They were
[57:02] one because a man shall leave his father
[57:04] and mother and cleave be glued to united
[57:06] with his wife and they shall be one
[57:08] flesh. And God never gave her a name.
[57:10] Amen. She did not get a name till after
[57:13] she committed adultery and fell by
[57:15] hybridizing. Amen. By hybridizing the
[57:17] seed. And then after she was impregnated
[57:21] by the by the serpent, she was given a
[57:23] name and that name is Eve called mother
[57:25] of all living.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; But originally she was just supposed to
[57:30] be Adam.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; And she was the original virgin and her
[57:34] purpose was to reproduce a son of God,
[57:37] Adam upon the earth again. So she missed
[57:41] her purpose.
[57:42] So
[57:45] that's why Mary now becomes the virgin.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; The first woman was supposed to be the
[57:53] virgin womb that was supposed to produce
[57:55] the next son of God, the the Christ
[57:58] seed. But now Mary is going to have to
[58:02] be the replacement for Eve.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; That's why the whole Bible the Bible is
[58:07] one story, friends. Amen.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; So beautiful to have a prophet come and
[58:12] restore us to these truths is so so
[58:14] thrilling to my soul because now you see
[58:16] the thought of God laid out.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; He says to be born of the word and
[58:21] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[58:24] again. You got that? Because the natural
[58:27] birth was fouled up in the beginning.
[58:29] There's no way through the natural birth
[58:31] to bring it back again. So now the only
[58:34] way to bring it back is to be born of
[58:36] the word and spirit. Amen. Got to come
[58:38] back to the original word and the
[58:40] original life and receive it in the womb
[58:42] of the mind. Drop it into the soul.
[58:43] Amen. To quicken the seed that's there
[58:45] to life. Amen. And that brings us back
[58:47] to the original life. Now it's a
[58:49] spiritual birth now. It can't be a
[58:51] natural birth. Has to be a spiritual
[58:52] birth.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; It brings back the spoken word again
[58:56] like in John 3. See, to be born of the
[58:58] water and the spirit, what does it do?
[59:00] Then it brings you right back again to
[59:01] the place of where you should have been
[59:03] at the beginning. See, that's the reason
[59:05] Christ's death brings us right back
[59:07] again to where? Sons of God. If Eve
[59:10] would have brought forth that child, she
[59:12] would have finally done it. Did not God
[59:15] tell her, "Multiply and replenish the
[59:17] earth." Praise God.
[59:20] He goes on to say, "I believe the Bible
[59:22] is the word, the whole truth, and Jesus
[59:24] is the word made manifest. He and his
[59:26] word is one and the same." What was he?
[59:29] Now look, he was that seed. I got to
[59:32] hold something back in order to get it
[59:34] there this evening. You see, it's hard.
[59:36] He was that seed that Eve should have
[59:38] produced. Do you get it? He was the seed
[59:41] Eve produced, but she hybrid it by
[59:43] disbelieving God's word. So, how did she
[59:46] hybrid it? By not staying true to the
[59:48] word. And when she disbelieved the word,
[59:50] she hybrid the seed by mingling it with
[59:53] another seed. And can ne that now can
[59:56] never reproduce of its kind
[59:58] &gt;&gt; because it's been changed. But now we
[1:00:01] can go back by the death of Jesus
[1:00:03] Christ, by the price that's been paid
[1:00:05] that can sanctify us so that his life
[1:00:07] can now the original life can now come
[1:00:09] in and touch the original seed that's
[1:00:12] down in our soul. Amen. Brother Bam said
[1:00:14] that little thing down there that was
[1:00:16] meant to be you. Amen. You came anyways,
[1:00:18] but you came wrong.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; We come trapped in hybrid flesh with a
[1:00:22] mind alienated, darkened to the things
[1:00:24] of God. Amen. But Christ gave his life
[1:00:27] so that there would be a power through
[1:00:28] his blood of redemption and a
[1:00:30] sanctifying power that could wash us and
[1:00:32] free us from sin by his death in our
[1:00:35] place. Amen. Because he was our
[1:00:37] substitute. God took our sins and placed
[1:00:40] it upon him. And his shedding of his
[1:00:41] blood washed us so that God through his
[1:00:44] sanctifying power could come and indwell
[1:00:46] us. And when he come indwell us, he'd
[1:00:47] bring life to that seed, that
[1:00:49] predestinated gene of God, and quicken
[1:00:51] it back and bring back the original
[1:00:53] life.
[1:00:54] Amen. This is sometimes why we struggle
[1:00:56] so much. You know, Brother Bram tells
[1:00:58] the story about the white dog and the
[1:00:59] black dog. He talks about the Indian
[1:01:01] chief saying, "Since I got the Holy
[1:01:02] Ghost," Amen. There's two dogs fighting
[1:01:04] in me. He said, "Which ones wins?" Amen.
[1:01:06] He says, "The black dog or the white
[1:01:08] dog." He said, "Whichever one I feed the
[1:01:10] most." Amen. Why? Because you've been
[1:01:12] quickened back that seed that was meant
[1:01:14] to be you from the beginning. the true
[1:01:15] you, the real gene of God down on the
[1:01:18] inside has sparked to life by contact
[1:01:20] with the true word and the true life of
[1:01:22] Jesus Christ that has brought it to
[1:01:24] life. But you're still trapped in hybrid
[1:01:26] condition, hybrid mind, hybrid body.
[1:01:28] Amen. So we're constantly at war with
[1:01:30] ourselves.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it causes us so much, amen, so
[1:01:35] much confusion sometimes that we don't
[1:01:37] understand. That's why God bringing a
[1:01:39] prophet in our day brought such
[1:01:40] understanding back to the children of
[1:01:42] God so that we would have the faith to
[1:01:44] take our God-given position to believe
[1:01:46] this word and to be able to step into
[1:01:48] what a prophet has brought us in this
[1:01:50] day because it's the word to be
[1:01:52] fulfilled in this hour. But it's got to
[1:01:54] be fulfilled by faith. Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And we've got to be able to overcome the
[1:01:58] hybrid condition and understand where
[1:02:00] the hybrid condition come in and
[1:02:02] understand why if I'm born again by the
[1:02:04] spirit of God, why do I still flare up
[1:02:07] in anger? Why is it still the
[1:02:09] temptations? Why is there still wrong
[1:02:10] desires in my flesh? I'll tell you why.
[1:02:13] Because Eve mingled the seed. Amen.
[1:02:15] Because you didn't come the right way.
[1:02:17] Amen. You come trapped in this cage
[1:02:19] called hybrid flesh. But God is going to
[1:02:22] change that someday by his power. Amen.
[1:02:24] The quickening power of God will change
[1:02:26] these very atoms to bring us back to
[1:02:28] what we were originally supposed to be.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; But the first step in that change, amen,
[1:02:33] is bring back through a new birth. Why
[1:02:35] do we have to be born again? Cuz our
[1:02:37] first birth is in a fallen condition and
[1:02:39] hybrid. So we got to I mean the whole
[1:02:42] concept of new birth has everything to
[1:02:44] do with the fall in the garden of Eden
[1:02:46] and the loss of a virgin condition and
[1:02:48] bringing forth Christ.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; We must be born again.
[1:02:53] Why? To bring us back to the original
[1:02:56] life, the original seed, which is the
[1:02:59] only thing that can reproduce itself.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; It's in me.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; It's in me.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; But it's like little little pastor Lily.
[1:03:12] Brother Brandham said that life is down
[1:03:16] and the muck and the mire. Amen. And
[1:03:18] somehow a little bit of light filters
[1:03:20] through muddy water and strikes that
[1:03:22] seed and starts a process of life and it
[1:03:24] has to push its way up through the dark
[1:03:27] muck and mud and up through the dirty
[1:03:29] amen. Dirty uh uh slimy water and up to
[1:03:32] the surface and poke its head out. But
[1:03:34] when it does, it begins to bloom and
[1:03:36] give forth life of of brother said
[1:03:38] Reverend Mr. Lily. Amen. What's it
[1:03:40] doing? It's showing what life was down
[1:03:42] in the muck and in the dirt and in the
[1:03:43] dirty water. Amen. And when we give
[1:03:45] ourselves to Jesus Christ and allow his
[1:03:48] life to take over us and we subdue the
[1:03:50] outer man and die to oursel and let
[1:03:53] Christ live on the inside, he starts
[1:03:55] pushing that little lily through the
[1:03:57] muck and the mud and the mire of this
[1:03:59] flesh so that he can poke it out and
[1:04:01] start to show the life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:03] on display.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But oh, it's such a push through mud.
[1:04:07] It's such darkness. It's such
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; murky water.
[1:04:13] But he's going to have it, friends.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; He's having it. She's pushing her way
[1:04:17] through. It's coming by the power of
[1:04:19] God, by the power of his word, by the
[1:04:22] life that's been released.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] So
[1:04:30] this bride
[1:04:32] fell.
[1:04:36] But he says in Genesis 3, I will put
[1:04:40] enmity between thee and the woman,
[1:04:43] between thy seed and her seed. It shall
[1:04:46] bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
[1:04:48] his heel.
[1:04:50] This is the first prophecy of a virgin
[1:04:53] birth laying in the Bible.
[1:04:56] Amen. that that there's going to come a
[1:04:59] seed from the woman.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; We know it because a woman doesn't have
[1:05:03] a seed. The man has the seed. The
[1:05:05] woman's the field. Amen. But from the
[1:05:07] from the woman, is going to come a seed.
[1:05:09] This is a prophecy of Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] coming through a woman.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Christ should have come
[1:05:16] through that first womb,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; but it was polluted. So he lays down. He
[1:05:23] lays down when he comes and brings his
[1:05:24] judgment and brings correction, he lays
[1:05:26] down a prophecy
[1:05:28] that there going to be a seed from the
[1:05:30] woman. And we know that woman was Mary
[1:05:32] and that seed was Jesus Christ.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] Let's just keep going. Let's go back to
[1:05:40] our booklet. Uh paragraph 171-3.
[1:05:45] And I'll just stop here and explain the
[1:05:47] paragraph numbers. If you see paragraph
[1:05:48] 171-3, that means in the blue book of
[1:05:52] the uh exposition of the seven church
[1:05:54] ages in that book that's printed printed
[1:05:56] by voice of God. This is on page 171,
[1:06:00] paragraph 3. So that's what those mean.
[1:06:02] So if you want to go back and look at
[1:06:03] any church ages book, that's what that
[1:06:05] means. So 171-3 says, "The second son,
[1:06:09] Jesus, also a spoken seed word of God,
[1:06:13] was given a bride like was Adam. But
[1:06:16] before he could marry her, she also had
[1:06:18] fallen. She, like Adam's wife, was put
[1:06:20] to the test whether she would believe
[1:06:22] the word of God and live or doubt the
[1:06:24] word and die. She doubted. She left the
[1:06:26] word. She died. So we see the repeat of
[1:06:30] this now. And the spiritual woman, which
[1:06:34] was the virgin bride that was given to
[1:06:36] Christ, fresh from Pentecost, fresh from
[1:06:38] the hands of God. Amen. She was born on
[1:06:41] the day of Pentecost, filled with the
[1:06:43] spirit of God. Amen. a church, a bride
[1:06:45] that Christ could marry. But before he
[1:06:48] could marry her, before they could come,
[1:06:51] remember Paul tells the church, he says,
[1:06:53] "I I'm jealous over you with godly
[1:06:55] jealous you because I have espoused you
[1:06:57] into one even to Christ."
[1:06:59] So Paul's saying, "You're engaged. Just
[1:07:02] stay true. You're engaged, but I'm
[1:07:04] worried over you lest you be deceived
[1:07:06] the way Eve was." What's he saying?
[1:07:09] Listen, we've come back to a virgin
[1:07:11] womb. You're engaged to Christ. keep
[1:07:13] going on and keep yourself pure and walk
[1:07:15] in the word. I'm worried that you're
[1:07:17] going to be beguiled at the same way
[1:07:18] that Eve was beguiled in the beginning.
[1:07:20] And what he was worried about is exactly
[1:07:22] what happened to the first church.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; They were beguiled by what? Amen. By by
[1:07:27] Satan again coming in as ministers of
[1:07:30] light and and starting to mix the word
[1:07:32] and mix it with old Judaism, mix it with
[1:07:34] traditions, mix it with ideas, and mixed
[1:07:36] it all up until they all got mixed up
[1:07:37] and hybridized again. And so now the
[1:07:40] church came forth clean and pure. Amen.
[1:07:43] What was she? She She was the
[1:07:45] replacement for the woman that fell.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But she fell too
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; by hybridizing the word. She left the
[1:07:55] word. She died. Next paragraph. From a
[1:07:58] little group of the true seed of the
[1:07:59] word.
[1:08:01] Where does this bride come from? The
[1:08:03] word.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the spoken word is the
[1:08:07] original seed.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we got to see that whatever
[1:08:11] that life is down inside of us, that's
[1:08:13] where it came from. From the mind of
[1:08:15] God, the thoughts of God. Amen. Now
[1:08:18] spoken.
[1:08:19] Says the little group of the true seed
[1:08:22] of the word. God will present Christ
[1:08:23] with a beloved bride. She is virgin of
[1:08:26] his word. She is virgin because she
[1:08:28] knows no manmade creeds or dogmas.
[1:08:33] Why is she virgin? Because she doesn't
[1:08:35] know man-made creeds or dogmas.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't about being the
[1:08:39] nicest person on the planet. This isn't
[1:08:41] about living the the cleanest life.
[1:08:43] That's not what this is about. This is
[1:08:45] about not hybridizing the word anymore.
[1:08:47] Coming back to the truth of the word and
[1:08:49] not mixing it with anything else.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; She is virgin because she knows no
[1:08:53] man-made creeds or dogmas by and through
[1:08:55] the members of the bride will be
[1:08:57] fulfilled. all that was promised of God
[1:09:00] to be made manifest in the virgin.
[1:09:04] I I I get so excited sometimes I can't
[1:09:07] contain myself.
[1:09:10] What was God? What was the promise
[1:09:14] through the virgin? Well, to me, let's
[1:09:16] go all the way back to the first virgin,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; which we know is Eve, but she was really
[1:09:21] Adam in the beginning.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; What was the promise through the first
[1:09:24] virgin? to multiply and replenish the
[1:09:27] earth or to bring forth the God race to
[1:09:29] bring what race? What race was she to
[1:09:32] bring forth? Let's just say it this way.
[1:09:34] The way brother Be said it early on, the
[1:09:36] super race.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; The God race. God replicated in flesh as
[1:09:41] a family of God upon the earth. Sons and
[1:09:44] daughters of God upon the earth. She was
[1:09:46] supposed to bring forth, Amen. the the
[1:09:49] the the continuation of the of of
[1:09:51] Christ, the anointed word. She was
[1:09:53] supposed to bring forth that seed. She
[1:09:55] was supposed to replicate Adam, a son of
[1:09:57] God, on the earth again. That's the
[1:09:59] original virgin. That's the promise to
[1:10:01] the original virgin. But when she fell,
[1:10:03] there came another promise of another
[1:10:05] virgin. And this virgin was going to
[1:10:07] bring forth the Christ seed.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:14, "Therefore, the Lord
[1:10:12] himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a
[1:10:14] virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
[1:10:17] and shall call his name Emmanuel."
[1:10:19] Emanuel means God with us. Amen. What
[1:10:22] was this promise through this virgin?
[1:10:24] She was supposed to bring God back to
[1:10:26] the earth.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; God in the form of his son, God in
[1:10:31] flesh, God in Jesus Christ was Emanuel,
[1:10:34] God with us. Hey, listen. That's the
[1:10:37] promise for this day, friends. When that
[1:10:39] Christ can live in you and I, and he
[1:10:40] comes to take his abode, amen, upon this
[1:10:43] earth in his tabernacle, which is his
[1:10:45] many membered body. Amen. It brings
[1:10:47] Emanuel on earth again. Amen. God with
[1:10:50] us. That's he's with us on the earth.
[1:10:53] Amen. But it's God in us.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; God in us brings Emanuel back to the
[1:10:58] earth.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; That's the promise. Here's another
[1:11:03] promise. Isaiah 9:6. For unto us a child
[1:11:05] is born. Unto us a son is given, and the
[1:11:08] government shall be on his shoulder, and
[1:11:10] his name shall be called Wonderful
[1:11:12] Counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:11:13] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:11:15] This is what the virgin was supposed to
[1:11:17] bring on the earth.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; What's the virgin in the end times
[1:11:21] supposed to bring? the same thing the
[1:11:23] life of Christ.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue on.
[1:11:29] Oh,
[1:11:31] the word of promise. We're still not
[1:11:34] finished from this is review.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; The word of promise came to the Virgin
[1:11:40] Mary, but the word of promise was he
[1:11:44] himself.
[1:11:46] I'm going stop there. He himself to be
[1:11:50] made manifest. What was the word of
[1:11:52] promise? He himself to be made manifest.
[1:11:55] Listen,
[1:11:57] this is why this is so important to me.
[1:12:00] The word of promise, he himself to be
[1:12:02] made manifest.
[1:12:04] Are we supposed to receive the word of
[1:12:06] promise in this hour?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; What will it be? He himself to be made
[1:12:10] manifest. It's not receiving doctrines,
[1:12:14] friends. It's not receiving teachings.
[1:12:17] This is the unveiling of God in our day.
[1:12:20] It's Christ himself. Amen. It's he
[1:12:23] himself coming to manifest himself, but
[1:12:27] he's got to have a virgin womb to come
[1:12:30] through.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So what
[1:12:36] the word of promise came to the Virgin
[1:12:38] Mary, but the word of promise was he
[1:12:41] himself to be made manifest. God was
[1:12:45] made manifest. He himself acted at that
[1:12:48] time and fulfilled his own word of
[1:12:50] promise in the virgin.
[1:12:53] It was an angel that had brought her the
[1:12:55] message. But the angel's message was the
[1:12:58] word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at
[1:13:00] that time all that was written of him
[1:13:02] because she accepted his word to her.
[1:13:05] Oh, praise God. Why did Eve not bring
[1:13:09] forth the right seed? Because she didn't
[1:13:11] accept all that was promised to her. She
[1:13:13] didn't accept the full word. She doubted
[1:13:16] and mingled it with reasoning.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; But when Mary come along, when God came,
[1:13:22] Amen. And Mary now was the virgin womb
[1:13:24] that was going to bring forth the Christ
[1:13:25] seed into manifestation in flesh. Amen.
[1:13:28] She came and God started by bringing her
[1:13:31] an angel messenger. And the angel
[1:13:33] messenger, what he brought her was the
[1:13:35] word of God. Isaiah 9:6, he said what he
[1:13:37] brought to her was not an idea, not a
[1:13:40] concept. He brought her the word. when
[1:13:42] he brought her the word, that word was
[1:13:44] he himself coming to manifest himself.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And this this woman Mary, she she has to
[1:13:53] believe the word
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; and she has to stay true to the word.
[1:13:58] Amen. So
[1:14:01] God was made manifest. Now listen, he
[1:14:04] himself
[1:14:06] acted at that time on fulfilled his own
[1:14:08] word of promise.
[1:14:10] He himself. This isn't what Mary did.
[1:14:13] What could Mary do? Ask me what Mary
[1:14:16] could do. How How could Mary Mary could
[1:14:20] read Isaiah 7 all she wanted. She could
[1:14:22] reads Isaiah 9:6 all day long. She could
[1:14:24] say, "I have a desire to bring this word
[1:14:27] manifest on the earth." There's not a
[1:14:29] thing Mary could do to produce the word.
[1:14:31] Amen. She couldn't do it. She probably
[1:14:33] didn't even know that that prophecy was
[1:14:35] for her day. Amen. It took an angel
[1:14:37] messenger to come from the presence of
[1:14:39] God and say, "Listen, Mary, there's a
[1:14:41] time now. We're at a junction of time.
[1:14:43] There's a transition taking place. God
[1:14:45] is now going to fulfill his promised
[1:14:47] word. And guess what? He wants to use
[1:14:49] your virgin wound to do it." Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And Mary, listen, Mary asked the
[1:14:56] question, but uh how
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; how let's let's turn together to Luke.
[1:15:03] Let's look at this in Luke chapter 1.
[1:15:12] Luke chapter 1,
[1:15:16] let's look at verse
[1:15:20] uh 26. Luke 1 26.
[1:15:26] And in the sixth month, the angel
[1:15:27] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[1:15:29] Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin,
[1:15:31] espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph
[1:15:33] of the house of David. And the virgin's
[1:15:36] name was Mary. And the angel came in
[1:15:38] unto her and said, "Hail, thou art
[1:15:40] highly favored. The Lord is with thee.
[1:15:42] Blessed art thou among women." Just stop
[1:15:45] for a minute. Let's quit reading about
[1:15:48] Mary and start reading about the end
[1:15:50] time bride.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; There was an angel. Was there an angel
[1:15:55] sent in this age? Was it the seventh
[1:15:56] angel?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. Amen. A messenger from
[1:16:00] God to come and bring a message to a
[1:16:02] virgin. Yes.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] And the angel came into her and said,
[1:16:10] "Hail, thou that are hardly thou thou
[1:16:14] that are highly favored. The Lord is
[1:16:16] with thee. Blessed art thou among
[1:16:18] women." Listen, I I can just imagine
[1:16:20] that when Mary gets this message, she
[1:16:22] was she was troubled in herself, the
[1:16:25] Bible says, because she didn't
[1:16:26] understand what this angel was saying.
[1:16:28] How am I highly favored? I'm from
[1:16:30] Nazareth. Nobody knows me. So, Brother
[1:16:32] Bam says she was probably around a
[1:16:33] 16-year-old girl, betrod to an older
[1:16:35] man, ma, imagining about her marriage
[1:16:37] coming up, and all of a sudden, she
[1:16:39] meets an angel, and the angel tells her
[1:16:40] a message that's so unbelievable, amen,
[1:16:43] that that you are highly favored and the
[1:16:45] Lord is with you.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; She may not have known that, but
[1:16:49] whatever life we were living, friends,
[1:16:50] no matter where we were and what we were
[1:16:52] doing, there was an angel that came to
[1:16:53] us one day and said, "You are highly
[1:16:55] favored and the Lord is with you." And
[1:16:57] we were like, "Who? Me?
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, you." Amen. and you nobody from
[1:17:02] nowhere from the lowest and the down and
[1:17:04] out. It's you. This prophecy is about
[1:17:06] you. This end time message is about you.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] And when verse 29, when she saw him, she
[1:17:15] was troubled at his saying, and cast in
[1:17:18] her mind what manner of salutation this
[1:17:20] should be. And the angel said unto her,
[1:17:21] "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
[1:17:23] favor with God.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Favor is grace.
[1:17:29] And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:17:31] womb, and bring forth a son, and thou
[1:17:33] shalt shall call his name Jesus, and
[1:17:35] shall be great, and shall be called the
[1:17:37] son of the highest. And the Lord God
[1:17:38] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:17:40] father David, and he shall reign over
[1:17:42] the house of Jacob forever, and of his
[1:17:44] kingdom there shall be no end." Then
[1:17:47] Mary Then said Mary unto the angel, "How
[1:17:50] shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
[1:17:53] Most logical question she could have
[1:17:55] asked. Yeah.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And the angel answered and said unto
[1:18:01] her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon
[1:18:02] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[1:18:04] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[1:18:06] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[1:18:08] shall be called the son of God." Listen,
[1:18:11] quit reading about Mary and start
[1:18:13] reading about the end time bride. It's
[1:18:15] going to be the Holy Ghost. Brother Bam
[1:18:17] said through the denominational ages,
[1:18:18] this Holy Ghost has been bound by the
[1:18:20] denominational waters for nearly 2,000
[1:18:22] years. It'll be released in the evening
[1:18:24] time. By the evening time message, the
[1:18:26] Holy Ghost back in the people again.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; How's he going to produce himself? How's
[1:18:31] he going to reproduce his life? How's he
[1:18:33] going to bring forth the Christ seed? I
[1:18:35] don't understand what you're saying. I
[1:18:36] can't make it out in my mind. Forget
[1:18:38] about your mind. There's something down
[1:18:40] in your soul that can say, "Be it unto
[1:18:42] me according to your word." There's
[1:18:44] something that you're saying that
[1:18:45] resonates. Not here because I don't know
[1:18:47] how I'll do this not knowing a man. I
[1:18:49] don't know what you mean about highly
[1:18:50] favored Lord with me. I don't understand
[1:18:52] all of that. But there's something down
[1:18:54] inside that says that's nothing but the
[1:18:56] truth.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "And behold, thy cousin
[1:19:03] Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son
[1:19:06] in her old age. And this is the sixth
[1:19:07] month with her who was called barren.
[1:19:10] For with God nothing shall be
[1:19:11] impossible. And Mary said, Behold, the
[1:19:14] handmade of the Lord, be it unto me
[1:19:16] according to thy word." And the angel
[1:19:18] departed her.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, here we go again. What could
[1:19:23] Mary do to bring forth the promised son,
[1:19:26] to bring forth the promised word, to
[1:19:28] fulfill the prophecy laying in Genesis
[1:19:30] 3, uh, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 9 and 6. What
[1:19:34] power did she have? None. What ability
[1:19:36] did she have? None. What knowledge did
[1:19:38] she have? Probably almost none. Amen.
[1:19:40] God was not looking for her ability. God
[1:19:43] was looking for somebody who could
[1:19:44] receive his word in due season, in the
[1:19:47] right time. He was looking for the right
[1:19:48] vessel in the right season that could
[1:19:50] say, "Be it unto me."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:19:58] God wasn't saying, "Mary, I need you to
[1:20:01] work hard, and I need you to do this,
[1:20:03] and I
[1:20:05] he was coming and saying, it's time for
[1:20:06] the promise, and you're the chosen
[1:20:07] vessel, and God's going to bring forth
[1:20:09] the seed now. He's going to fulfill his
[1:20:11] word. He's going to bring him forth.
[1:20:13] He's going to establish him.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:19] Now she runs to visit Elizabeth. Let's
[1:20:23] keep reading. And Mary rose in those
[1:20:25] days and went into the hill country with
[1:20:27] haste into a city of Judah and entered
[1:20:29] into the house of Zacharias and saluted
[1:20:31] Elizabeth. And it came to pass that when
[1:20:34] Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary,
[1:20:36] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:20:39] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[1:20:41] Ghost. This is one of my favorite
[1:20:43] scriptures because prophet of God gives
[1:20:46] us background. He says Elizabeth had six
[1:20:48] months with child and hadn't felt the
[1:20:50] baby move yet. We know she's she's she's
[1:20:52] supernaturally received a conception in
[1:20:54] her old age from her husband from
[1:20:56] Zachariah. An angel visited him too and
[1:20:58] told him and this is going to be the
[1:20:59] forerunner to Jesus Christ. Amen. This
[1:21:01] is going to this is John the Baptist
[1:21:03] that's in her womb but hadn't moved.
[1:21:05] Hadn't had no sign of life, nothing. But
[1:21:07] when Mary comes and brings her
[1:21:09] salutation, what? And brother B said,
[1:21:10] "What was the salutation?" She told her
[1:21:12] what the angel said. And as soon as she
[1:21:14] mentioned the name Jesus, the babe leapt
[1:21:16] within her. Amen. And she was filled
[1:21:18] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. And and I
[1:21:19] began to realize when I read this, Amen.
[1:21:21] There was Mary. There was a woman who
[1:21:23] had the promised word of her day come
[1:21:25] alive inside of her. And she went with a
[1:21:28] testimony that I believe what the angel
[1:21:30] told me. And brother Benham said she
[1:21:32] didn't feel one sensation. She didn't
[1:21:33] have a feeling of any kind, a sensation
[1:21:36] of any kind to prove that that was true.
[1:21:38] Amen. All she had was a witness in her
[1:21:41] heart. She believed it to be the truth.
[1:21:43] And what the angel told her was true.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And if he said, "You're the one and
[1:21:47] now's the time." She said, "Be it unto
[1:21:49] me." She witnessed that it was the
[1:21:50] truth. But brother Bam said before she
[1:21:52] felt one thing stir in her womb, before
[1:21:54] she had any sensation at all or any
[1:21:56] evidence or proof that she had conceived
[1:21:59] this child, she went running straight to
[1:22:01] Elizabeth and told Elizabeth all that
[1:22:02] had happened because she received it
[1:22:04] based on the word
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; on the word. And the word alone, the
[1:22:09] word of a messenger, amen, told to her
[1:22:12] and she had a witness in her heart and
[1:22:13] she received it based on the word. Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Can we move forward by the word that we
[1:22:23] receive? Can we say, "Amen. I'm part of
[1:22:25] the bride of Jesus Christ." Not because
[1:22:27] I've earned it, not because I'm good,
[1:22:28] and not because I feel like it every
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:22:32] I'm so glad we had a prophet of God that
[1:22:34] God used so supernaturally that there
[1:22:36] was no question that him and God were on
[1:22:38] an intimate basis. Amen. And he told us,
[1:22:40] he goes, "I backslide every day. I make
[1:22:42] mistakes all the time.
[1:22:46] And then somebody asked him, "Brother
[1:22:48] Brandon, how do I how can you know that
[1:22:50] you're saved or something like that?" He
[1:22:51] said, "I can't even prove that I'm
[1:22:53] saved. I just believe it by faith."
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I" and and the question
[1:22:57] was, "I sometimes don't feel like I'm
[1:22:58] saved." Brother Bam said, "Sometimes I
[1:23:00] don't feel like I'm saved."
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; So, let's quit relying on feelings and
[1:23:05] get back to the truth of the word. Has
[1:23:07] the messenger said that you're this
[1:23:09] bride? As he said, it's time now for
[1:23:11] this manifestation of Christ in bride
[1:23:13] form. Is there something in you says, "I
[1:23:15] want that to be unto me according to
[1:23:17] your word." Then stick with it, friends,
[1:23:19] and don't back down the next time you
[1:23:20] have bad feelings or a bad day or things
[1:23:23] go wrong or you make a mistake or you
[1:23:25] even backslide. Stop the nonsense and
[1:23:27] come back to the word. The word is the
[1:23:29] original seed, not a feeling or a
[1:23:31] sensation. But the word has the power.
[1:23:33] The word has the life. The word is the
[1:23:35] truth.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Our feelings lie.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; The word never lies.
[1:23:42] Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Now she's got this life in her without
[1:23:46] sensation. She just starts proclaiming.
[1:23:48] And as soon as she proclaims it to
[1:23:49] Elizabeth, Elizabeth has a promised seed
[1:23:52] word inside her womb, but it hasn't
[1:23:54] sprung to life yet. But when one woman
[1:23:56] with the seed alive in her speaks her
[1:23:58] testimony to another woman with the seed
[1:24:00] laying dormant in her, all of a sudden
[1:24:02] that seed starts springing to life. What
[1:24:04] caused it to come to life? It was the
[1:24:06] present tense truth. Christ in a bride.
[1:24:09] When she began to testify of that, it
[1:24:11] brought that other seed to life.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what we're doing, friends.
[1:24:16] Testifying of the life that is in us
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 40. And entering into the
[1:24:25] house of Elizabeth, Zacharias, and
[1:24:27] saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass
[1:24:28] that when Elizabeth heard the salutation
[1:24:30] of Mary, the babe leapt in her womb, and
[1:24:33] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost. And she spake out with a loud
[1:24:36] voice and said, "Blessed art thou among
[1:24:38] women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
[1:24:40] womb. And whence is this, whence is this
[1:24:43] to me that the mother of my Lord shall
[1:24:45] come to me? For lo, as soon as the voice
[1:24:48] of thy salutation sounded in my ears,
[1:24:51] the babe leapt in my womb for joy. And
[1:24:53] blessed is she that believed." Oh, get
[1:24:56] this, friends. And blessed is she that
[1:24:58] believed. What did Mary do? She
[1:25:00] believed. What works did she do? None.
[1:25:03] She believed. All of her works and all
[1:25:05] of her testimony and everything had to
[1:25:07] do with the fact that she first
[1:25:09] believed.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed is she that believed, for
[1:25:16] there shall be a performance of those
[1:25:18] things which were told her from the
[1:25:19] Lord. Why? Because she believed. God
[1:25:23] wasn't looking for somebody who could
[1:25:24] produce the seed. He was looking for
[1:25:26] somebody that could believe the word for
[1:25:28] her day. Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; When God come to Abraham, he wasn't
[1:25:33] looking for somebody that could produce
[1:25:34] a promised son because Abraham couldn't
[1:25:36] produce a promised son. By the time God
[1:25:38] came to him, he had lived decades with
[1:25:41] his wife. She was barren and unable to
[1:25:43] produce. Amen. And he wasn't coming to
[1:25:45] Abraham says, "Now you produce this."
[1:25:47] Abraham couldn't produce this. He come
[1:25:49] down and said, "I'm going to give you a
[1:25:51] seed." And he kept he kept clarifying
[1:25:53] the prophecy as time moved down. And
[1:25:55] then as time moved down, now now Sarah
[1:25:58] couldn't produce the seed. And now
[1:26:00] Abraham could no longer produce the
[1:26:01] seed. That's right.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; He was as good as dead. The Bible says,
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; But God wasn't asking Abraham to produce
[1:26:10] anything. He was only asking Abraham to
[1:26:12] believe his word. That's all he needed
[1:26:14] was somebody who could believe it. And
[1:26:16] and in Hebrews says, he staggered not at
[1:26:18] the promise of God, but grew strong in
[1:26:20] faith. The weaker he came, the more
[1:26:22] unlikely it was and the less ability he
[1:26:24] had, the more he believed.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We live in such a
[1:26:32] scientific age, but science's not going
[1:26:34] to get us there.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Remember back in February of 1962, there
[1:26:41] had been astronomers that had predicted
[1:26:42] for thousands of years there was a
[1:26:44] destruction coming at this alignment.
[1:26:45] There was many people who believed,
[1:26:47] amen, that that this was a sign of the
[1:26:49] end time. But no, there's no scientific
[1:26:51] information to verify that.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; So quit relying on science. Amen. We've
[1:26:56] had a prophet with the word of God
[1:26:58] verified it.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] So blessed is she that believed, for
[1:27:09] there shall be a performance of those
[1:27:11] things which were told her from the
[1:27:13] Lord. Let's go back to our little
[1:27:15] booklet
[1:27:17] back at the bottom of paragraph 171-5
[1:27:22] says,
[1:27:24] "But the angel's message was the word of
[1:27:26] God." Isaiah 9:6, "He fulfilled at that
[1:27:29] time all that was written of him
[1:27:31] because," if you got a pen, circle
[1:27:34] because
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; this is an important word.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:27:41] written of him. And can you go up and
[1:27:43] underline? He fulfilled.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Who did the work? He did the work. Who
[1:27:49] had the power? He had the power. Who had
[1:27:52] the ability? He had the ability. But
[1:27:54] what did he need? He needed somebody who
[1:27:57] would believe it.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:28:01] written of him because she accepted his
[1:28:04] word to her. This is where Eve failed,
[1:28:07] friends. This is exactly where Eve
[1:28:09] failed. Eve started thinking about
[1:28:11] producing the word herself. Amen. The
[1:28:13] word was multiply and replenish the
[1:28:15] earth. Amen. The Satan came through the
[1:28:17] serpent and began to whisper to her
[1:28:19] other ideas and began to tell her and
[1:28:21] reinterpret the word and misinterpret
[1:28:23] the word to her. And she began to look
[1:28:25] at herself and ability and inability and
[1:28:28] what she could do and couldn't do. And
[1:28:29] she went through all of this and she
[1:28:32] failed to believe the word. She
[1:28:34] believed, but she misunderstood the word
[1:28:36] because she didn't stay with the
[1:28:37] original word. She took some reasoning
[1:28:39] and mixed reasoning with it and confused
[1:28:41] herself and went forward of her own
[1:28:44] effort
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and she brought death.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; If she would have stayed with the word,
[1:28:50] brother Bram said in order for the word
[1:28:53] to reproduce itself to be fulfilled, it
[1:28:55] can never bring death.
[1:28:57] So whatever he meant by multiply and
[1:28:59] replenish when it would have come there
[1:29:00] according to his will and his word, it
[1:29:02] could never bring death. There would
[1:29:03] have been no death on the earth.
[1:29:06] But when you hybrid it, it brings death.
[1:29:09] The original word can't bring death.
[1:29:12] So now
[1:29:14] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:29:16] written of him because
[1:29:19] she accepted his word to her. Listen,
[1:29:22] what do you think God's looking for in
[1:29:23] this end time? You think he's looking
[1:29:26] for a stunning group of people that are
[1:29:28] so intelligent and have such
[1:29:30] self-restraint, have such willpower that
[1:29:33] they're going to
[1:29:36] He's looking for somebody who will
[1:29:37] believe his promise.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe weak, maybe incapable of a lot of
[1:29:43] things in our lives, maybe with a lot of
[1:29:46] misunderstanding and that's not what
[1:29:48] he's looking at. He'll fulfill his own
[1:29:50] word. But he's looking for somebody to
[1:29:52] believe it. Just believe it.
[1:29:56] Amen. Let's continue on. Now, let's go
[1:29:58] to verse 46. Before we read 46, I want
[1:30:02] we're going to read Mary's response.
[1:30:05] And when you read Mary's response, I
[1:30:07] don't want you to think about Mary.
[1:30:10] I want you to think about yourself as
[1:30:13] the virgin wound that he's restored back
[1:30:15] to a virgin condition so that he can
[1:30:17] unite with you and he can reproduce
[1:30:18] himself in you. And when you hear Mary's
[1:30:22] testimony, amen, let it be more than
[1:30:24] Mary's testimony.
[1:30:26] And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the
[1:30:29] Lord." Hallelujah. Does your soul
[1:30:32] magnify God because of the great thing
[1:30:34] that he did for you that you couldn't do
[1:30:36] yourself that you had no power to do?
[1:30:38] You couldn't decide who's a prophet, not
[1:30:40] a prophet, whether you'll hear or not
[1:30:41] hear, whether you could believe or not
[1:30:43] believe. He designed all of that. Amen.
[1:30:45] And it's so easily you just seemingly
[1:30:47] just stumbled into it or stepped into it
[1:30:50] and it just happened. Mary wasn't
[1:30:51] looking for anything. Mary wasn't trying
[1:30:54] really hard. Mary was just going about
[1:30:55] her business and God found a way to get
[1:30:57] the message to her. Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And God found a way to get the message
[1:31:02] to us.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Our soul should magnify the Lord.
[1:31:06] Magnify the Lord on high because we were
[1:31:09] nobody from nowhere with no idea what to
[1:31:11] do or what time it was or what part of
[1:31:13] the word to be fulfilled. But he brought
[1:31:15] it to us through a messenger and he had
[1:31:17] placed something in us that could
[1:31:18] receive it and believe it.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "My soul doth magnify
[1:31:25] the Lord. My spirit hath rejoiced in God
[1:31:28] my Savior. For he hath regarded the
[1:31:31] lowest state of his handmaidaden. For
[1:31:33] behold, from henceforth all generations
[1:31:36] shall call me blessed. I feel like the
[1:31:38] most blessed human being on the planet.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; For he that is mighty hath done me great
[1:31:45] things, and holy is his name. And his
[1:31:48] mercy is on them that fear him from
[1:31:50] generation to generation. He has showed
[1:31:52] strength with his arm. He has scattered
[1:31:54] the proud in the imagination of their
[1:31:56] hearts. He hath put down the mighty from
[1:31:58] their seats and exalted them of low
[1:32:00] degree. He hath filled the hungry with
[1:32:02] good things, and the rich he hath sent
[1:32:04] empty away. He hath hope in his servant
[1:32:06] Israel in remembrance of his mercy as he
[1:32:08] spoke to our fathers to Abraham and to
[1:32:11] his seed forever.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say the same thing, friend?
[1:32:16] This is my testimony. Mary is crying out
[1:32:19] my heart's desire to say God, it's his
[1:32:22] strength, his might, his power, and he's
[1:32:24] keeping his promise to the seed of
[1:32:26] Abraham. Don't forget, Paul tells us
[1:32:27] that we're seed of Abraham.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Under the unconditional covenant of
[1:32:32] grace, and the seed of Abraham is
[1:32:34] Christ, and ye are Christ.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, we should read it again
[1:32:43] and again and again until we just break
[1:32:45] out in praise because our soul does
[1:32:47] magnify the Lord. He's looked on the
[1:32:49] lowest state of his handmaiden. I was
[1:32:51] nothing. Amen. I still am nothing in
[1:32:53] myself. But he has taken me and he has
[1:32:55] lifted me on high. He's brought the high
[1:32:58] high and mighty theologians,
[1:33:00] philosophers, and all the intellectuals.
[1:33:01] and he's dropped him down to nothing by
[1:33:03] taking a a a a humble man out of
[1:33:06] Kentucky with a seventh grade education,
[1:33:08] not even able to pronounce the long
[1:33:10] words in his Bible. And he has brought
[1:33:12] to nothing all the wisdom of the wise
[1:33:14] and he's exalted his word back to where
[1:33:16] it should be.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And he's taken his bride and he's lifted
[1:33:20] her on high
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; by his promised word.
[1:33:25] He showed strength with his arm. Mary's
[1:33:28] not there talking about anything she
[1:33:29] did.
[1:33:31] She's not rejoicing because I was able
[1:33:33] to this and I thought that and I did
[1:33:35] this. She didn't do a she didn't do a
[1:33:37] blessed thing except I believe
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; being into me. And even that was by the
[1:33:42] grace of God by predestination.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the word of God.
[1:33:49] Amen.
[1:33:51] Amen. We better keep moving.
[1:33:56] This is where we stopped last time. this
[1:33:59] sentence. I I think so. Let's keep
[1:34:03] going. The true bride, hallelujah,
[1:34:05] there's going to be one. Why? She's
[1:34:08] predestinated. She won't be denominated
[1:34:10] because she's predestinated. See, she
[1:34:12] don't have to worry about some
[1:34:14] denomination. She's already
[1:34:15] predestinated to take the place. Look,
[1:34:17] like Mary, I want you to get this now.
[1:34:19] And don't fail. Are you ready? Amen.
[1:34:22] When Christ comes to his bride, she will
[1:34:25] be a virgin like Mary was. For God will
[1:34:27] not bring Christ through the womb of a
[1:34:29] And neither will he bring the
[1:34:31] bride. He can't bring his word through a
[1:34:33] of his word. So what does he have
[1:34:36] to do first before listen before Christ
[1:34:40] can come to his bride? He's got to wash
[1:34:43] that bride and wash her away from all
[1:34:46] the filthiness of denominations. And how
[1:34:49] does he do it? He does it as we read in
[1:34:51] Ephesians. He does it by the washing of
[1:34:54] the water by the word. Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; So what was God doing when he was tying
[1:34:58] together the loose ends and restoring
[1:35:00] the word of God? Amen. He was washing
[1:35:02] away the filth of all hybrid religion,
[1:35:05] washing away all false understanding,
[1:35:07] washing away all Amen. the the
[1:35:09] misunderstanding of the Bible and
[1:35:11] bringing back the pure clean water that
[1:35:13] could wash a bride clean.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; And he had to bring her back to a virgin
[1:35:20] condition. How did he bring her back to
[1:35:22] an virgin condition? The original word
[1:35:25] would bring her back to the original
[1:35:26] condition.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; By the word and the spirit brings us
[1:35:30] back to the original life.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; He can't bring his word through a
[1:35:40] of his word.
[1:35:42] Them is horrible words, but that's what
[1:35:44] the Bible says. I'm saying what it says.
[1:35:47] This has got to be understood to prove
[1:35:50] true bride like Mary will have a virgin
[1:35:52] womb for the bride of the word which is
[1:35:54] Christ. When Christ the word comes to
[1:35:56] the bride, she'll be the same as he is
[1:35:59] virgin by the word. What makes her
[1:36:02] virgin? Because there's no man-made
[1:36:04] creeds or dogmas in her.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; She's come back to the original word and
[1:36:08] been washed by that word.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And spoken word again says man wasn't
[1:36:15] made to die. He was made to live by
[1:36:17] hybriding brought death there rather she
[1:36:21] hybrid now you deny the serpent seed
[1:36:23] then I'll ask you why what's these
[1:36:25] funeral services about she was hybrid
[1:36:28] every one of us are hybrid from the
[1:36:29] original that's the reason you're
[1:36:31] constantly dying but oh god there's a
[1:36:34] germ of life come from the real seed but
[1:36:36] god proved it was his seed rose them up
[1:36:38] again see that through that life that's
[1:36:41] going over the original seed like was
[1:36:43] given to Eve over his real church is
[1:36:46] bringing forth life again through the
[1:36:48] birth, through the womb of his bride.
[1:36:51] Oh, it's rich and glorious. I give it a
[1:36:54] little time to study so it'll sink in.
[1:36:56] He is that seed. He is that seed that
[1:36:59] was produced by the word of God. Be it
[1:37:01] unto me according to the word. There's
[1:37:03] the seed. See, taking the word.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; How are we receiving the seed of Christ
[1:37:09] to reproduce Christ? By taking the word.
[1:37:12] That's how we receive the seed. by
[1:37:15] receiving this message in its fullness.
[1:37:17] By receiving the restored word, by
[1:37:19] receiving the truths that have been laid
[1:37:20] out for the bride, just by taking it in,
[1:37:23] not questioning it, not reasoning, and
[1:37:25] not overthinking it. Amen. Just taking
[1:37:27] it in and saying, "Be it unto me
[1:37:28] according to that word."
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; That's receiving. That's taking the
[1:37:33] word. There's the seed.
[1:37:36] And he says,
[1:37:39] brother Bam says in Mark 6, or not,
[1:37:42] brother Bam, Jesus is going to say in
[1:37:44] Mark 6, "Is not this the carpenter son
[1:37:46] of Mary, the brother of James and Joseph
[1:37:48] and Judah and Simon? Are not his sisters
[1:37:50] here with us?" And they were offended at
[1:37:52] him. But Jesus said unto them, "A
[1:37:55] prophet is not without honor, but in his
[1:37:57] own country, and among his own ken, and
[1:37:59] in his own house. and he could there do
[1:38:02] no mighty work save that he laid his
[1:38:04] hands upon a few sick folks and healed
[1:38:06] them and he marveled because of their
[1:38:08] unbelief and he went round about the
[1:38:10] villages teaching.
[1:38:13] Why was it Jesus couldn't do
[1:38:16] why was it he could not do mighty work
[1:38:18] there?
[1:38:20] because they didn't believe.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He couldn't do Listen, the Jesus was not
[1:38:27] diminished in his power.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; One drop.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't diminished in his ability. One
[1:38:33] drop.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; He could keep his word. He could perform
[1:38:37] miracles. He could open blinded eyes. He
[1:38:39] could heal the sick. He could raise the
[1:38:42] lame. He could raise the dead.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Everything he did in any other village,
[1:38:46] he could do in their village. The only
[1:38:48] reason he could not do mighty works
[1:38:50] there is because of their unbelief.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; He would go here and not do mighty
[1:38:55] works. He would go to another village
[1:38:56] and heal all their sick.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Because they believed.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me not have unbelief that
[1:39:04] hinders the work in this end time. But
[1:39:06] just God quicken my faith.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; God just needs somebody to believe.
[1:39:14] Next, next paragraph on our booklet
[1:39:16] 172-1.
[1:39:20] The members of the virgin bride will
[1:39:23] love him and they will have his
[1:39:25] potentials for he is their head and all
[1:39:27] power belongs to him. They are subject
[1:39:30] to him as the members of our bodies are
[1:39:32] subject to our heads.
[1:39:36] His potentials.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; What are his potentials?
[1:39:41] I just want to ask you what are his
[1:39:43] potentials limited?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Unlimited potentials.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; How? Because he is their head and all
[1:39:51] power belongs to him. They are subject
[1:39:53] to him as the members of our bodies are
[1:39:56] subject to our heads.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; What moves my finger? My head.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; What lifts my leg? My head. What opens
[1:40:03] my mouth and speaks? My head. Amen.
[1:40:05] Everything in my body is directed from
[1:40:07] my head. If we are connected to the
[1:40:08] head, to the headstone, to the fullness
[1:40:10] of the word, and the word is moving down
[1:40:12] unto us, he can do anything he wants to
[1:40:14] do through us.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; We have his potentials. He says in
[1:40:19] Ephesians, "Wives, submit yourselves
[1:40:20] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord.
[1:40:22] For the husband is the head of the wife,
[1:40:24] even as Christ is the head of the
[1:40:25] church, and he is savior of the body.
[1:40:27] Therefore, as the church is subject unto
[1:40:29] Christ, so let the wives be to their own
[1:40:33] husbands in everything."
[1:40:35] What's he speaking of, brother Bam? gets
[1:40:37] Jesus or Paul, sorry, gets to the end of
[1:40:40] this statement. He says, "This is a
[1:40:41] great mystery, but I'm not talking about
[1:40:43] a man and a woman. I'm talking about
[1:40:44] Christ in his church.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to get anywhere, just
[1:40:48] submit." Amen. If you want anything to
[1:40:49] happen, just surrender. Amen. Quit
[1:40:51] trying to figure anything out and quit
[1:40:52] trying to do anything. Just surrender
[1:40:54] and let him do it. The key is surrender.
[1:40:58] The key is submission.
[1:41:01] That's where That's where Eve fell.
[1:41:03] That's where the first church fell.
[1:41:07] Eve failed to bring forth the natural
[1:41:10] seed.
[1:41:12] The the son of God replicated on the
[1:41:14] earth. But Mary, she come by faith in
[1:41:17] the word that was given to her, produced
[1:41:20] that seed. How did she do it? By faith.
[1:41:24] By surrender.
[1:41:27] Didn't think it up. Didn't conjure it
[1:41:28] up. Didn't work it up. She just
[1:41:30] surrendered.
[1:41:32] Eve didn't surrender to the word. She
[1:41:34] began to reason with the word
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and she begin to find her own way to
[1:41:39] bring forth the word.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; What did the first spiritual bride do?
[1:41:44] Did she bring forth that full spiritual
[1:41:46] seed? No. Before she could bring forth
[1:41:48] that spiritual seed, Christ. Amen.
[1:41:50] Before he could marry her, Amen. She was
[1:41:52] already found in adultery. What did she
[1:41:54] do? She tried to find her own way. She
[1:41:56] tried to reason again and figure it out.
[1:41:58] Yeah,
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; but just as there was a replacement for
[1:42:02] the natural woman and Mary, there's a
[1:42:04] replacement for the spiritual woman and
[1:42:06] the bride at the end time. And the bride
[1:42:08] at the end time is going to do what Mary
[1:42:10] did. Amen. Why? Because she's
[1:42:12] predestinated to take that spot. There's
[1:42:14] going to be a people on the earth that
[1:42:16] don't have to figure it out, don't have
[1:42:18] to be smart, don't have to be
[1:42:19] intellectual, don't need to be
[1:42:20] theologian. All they need to do is have
[1:42:22] a will inside of them to surrender to
[1:42:24] the word and say, "It's true, friends.
[1:42:26] It's true. How is it true? I can't
[1:42:28] figure it out, but it's true.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And then what caused Eve to fail?
[1:42:36] Brother Beam said she couldn't wait.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; What caused the the first church to
[1:42:45] fail? Brother Beam said the same thing.
[1:42:47] She couldn't wait.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, we've got nothing to do in this
[1:42:54] to make it happen. And the only thing we
[1:42:55] have is to surrender.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; If we start trying to conjure up a plan,
[1:43:00] a program, a way, figure something out
[1:43:02] or some super intellectual or revelation
[1:43:05] or an ability and start experimenting
[1:43:07] with things. Listen, that's the wrong
[1:43:08] way. Just rest and let the headship do
[1:43:11] it all. Let Christ the head do it
[1:43:13] through his body. Amen. And and we just
[1:43:15] need to rest and let God do it all.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; We've got to believe
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; that the full potentials are here. Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; It's all here. All we got to do is
[1:43:26] surrender. Mary brought forth Christ.
[1:43:30] She just surrendered and gave herself to
[1:43:32] it.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. This bride is going to bring forth
[1:43:35] Christ. She's bringing forth Christ. But
[1:43:37] it'll be by surrender.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; See, when Adam came to his wife, she was
[1:43:42] pregnant. She had done something. She
[1:43:45] was mixed. She was hybrid, the child,
[1:43:47] and it died. But when Joseph come to his
[1:43:49] bride, she was pregnantated. with life.
[1:43:52] Adam's wife or Adam's bride. When Adam
[1:43:54] before they came together, just like
[1:43:56] Joseph and Mary, just like Christ in the
[1:43:58] church now, don't you see it? And before
[1:44:00] they came together, Adam and Eve, she
[1:44:02] was pregnantated with the corrupt seed
[1:44:04] from the serpent. And when Adam come to
[1:44:06] his wife, he found her pregnant to
[1:44:08] death. See death. How? Spiritually and
[1:44:11] physically dead. But when Joseph the
[1:44:14] human came to his wife, glory can't
[1:44:16] hardly hold her. She was pregnantated
[1:44:18] with life. The word of God, flesh in her
[1:44:20] womb. Bring back the spoken word. Bring
[1:44:23] back the word of God, which was word
[1:44:25] here came through a human's womb. Amen.
[1:44:28] God will do it anyhow. He spoke it. And
[1:44:31] it's got to be. So that's our God. Oh,
[1:44:34] that's rich, brethren. If you can
[1:44:35] dissolve it, you can hit it. That's
[1:44:37] where he found when Adam came to his
[1:44:40] wife, she was pregnant with the wrong
[1:44:42] seed. But see, this that seed died.
[1:44:45] Joseph came to us. She was pregnantated.
[1:44:48] Now, what caused the difference? The
[1:44:50] different pregnantation because that
[1:44:51] Adam's wife doubted the word. That's
[1:44:53] right. Joseph's bride believed the word.
[1:44:56] That's the difference.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; What's the difference to us in the first
[1:44:59] church? The first church started
[1:45:01] doubting and started mixing. Amen. But
[1:45:03] this bride, I don't care if it takes
[1:45:05] another 100 years, 150 years, 200 years,
[1:45:07] she's not going to doubt the word
[1:45:09] because she's predestinated not to doubt
[1:45:11] the word. She'll hang on and just
[1:45:13] believe. Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[1:45:18] believe.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when the bride of Jesus
[1:45:26] Christ lets man-made creeds and dogmas
[1:45:28] take the place of the word of God, she
[1:45:29] is committing adultery."
[1:45:32] Didn't Jesus say, "Whosoever lookth upon
[1:45:33] a woman has committed adultery with her
[1:45:35] already in his heart. Looked upon the
[1:45:36] woman to lust after hath committed
[1:45:38] adultery with her already." Why? She let
[1:45:40] it come into his mind. That's the womb
[1:45:43] that starts the things moving. Satan,
[1:45:44] come in. We were swed with the word.
[1:45:47] Someday I'll bring that the life into
[1:45:50] the earth and replenish the earth. What
[1:45:51] Eve failed to do, Mary did. She took the
[1:45:55] word. Eve took Satan's lie. Mary took
[1:45:58] God's word.
[1:46:00] And and through Mary's seed replenished
[1:46:03] the earth again.
[1:46:06] How? Oh. Oh, we're going to get to it.
[1:46:08] Just hang on, friends. through Mary's
[1:46:11] seed replenished the earth again. But
[1:46:13] but Jesus never married. Jesus never in
[1:46:17] the natural, we're talking natural. He
[1:46:18] never married. He never had children. He
[1:46:20] never had offspring. He was cut off. Who
[1:46:22] shall declare his generation? Because he
[1:46:24] was cut off from the land of the living.
[1:46:26] Where is his offspring?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Through Mary's seed. What's
[1:46:31] that? Christ. Through Mary's seed
[1:46:34] replenish the earth again. What's this?
[1:46:36] The original promise. the original
[1:46:38] commandment that was given to Adam.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; But through Mary's seed replenish the
[1:46:43] earth again through his bride through
[1:46:45] the word and will bring up the
[1:46:47] millennium. Through that goes forth the
[1:46:49] word and the word is planted into every
[1:46:51] predestinated heart and the spirit comes
[1:46:54] down and waters it and they cannot die.
[1:46:56] I'll raise them up again at the last
[1:46:58] day. Oh brother, sister, that's real.
[1:47:01] What is it? He through Mary's seed, he's
[1:47:04] replenished the earth again. Why?
[1:47:07] because he's going to have an earth
[1:47:08] filled with sons and daughters of God.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; It's got to have some purging yet.
[1:47:13] There's got to be a rapture and a
[1:47:15] resurrection and a restoration, but it's
[1:47:17] going to be there because he's
[1:47:18] replenishing the earth now.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Through a seed,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; through Christ's seed,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; now look at this quote in in marriage
[1:47:27] and divorce. That's why he said to Adam
[1:47:30] before sex was ever introduced, multiply
[1:47:33] to replenish the earth. When he was yet
[1:47:35] in the beginning, when he was yet both
[1:47:36] male and female in himself, there shows
[1:47:39] then that the bride has got to come from
[1:47:41] the word by spiritual multiplication.
[1:47:44] Multiplication replenish the earth. How?
[1:47:47] Through Mary's seed does he replenish
[1:47:49] the earth? Because those that can
[1:47:51] believe his word in their day. He comes
[1:47:53] with the quickening power to quicken
[1:47:55] that original seed down in the soul to
[1:47:57] life. And when it's quickened to life,
[1:47:59] it's another son of God again upon the
[1:48:01] earth. And now through Mary's seed, he's
[1:48:03] replenishing the earth. And he's doing
[1:48:05] it now, friends.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; What was given at the original when the
[1:48:09] first woman failed, he brought back the
[1:48:12] natural original seed. He brought it
[1:48:14] through a womb of a woman. Amen. And now
[1:48:16] through the spiritual womb of a woman.
[1:48:18] He's bringing forth now the replenishing
[1:48:21] of the earth.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; It's in spoken word as the original
[1:48:26] seed. When brother Benham gets down to
[1:48:27] this, he gets to this part and he starts
[1:48:29] to say, he starts to tell us some
[1:48:31] examples of the Bible and he says the
[1:48:33] Ethiopian unic in the book of Acts, he
[1:48:35] had went up to Jerusalem. He went to the
[1:48:37] doctors of divinity and the PhDs and
[1:48:39] tried to get it through education and he
[1:48:41] come back reading Isaiah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And as he was reading Isaiah, God, Amen,
[1:48:47] called Philillip away from a revival in
[1:48:49] Samaria, told him to go to the
[1:48:51] wilderness. And when this chariot come
[1:48:52] by, he told him, he said, "Draw yourself
[1:48:54] up to the chariot." He ran alongside. He
[1:48:56] heard him reading out of the book of
[1:48:58] Isaiah. He says, "Do that do you
[1:49:00] understand what you read?" And he says,
[1:49:01] "How can I lest some man show me?"
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; And he stopped the chariot. Philip
[1:49:06] climbed up in. And beginning at that
[1:49:08] scripture, he preached unto them Jesus
[1:49:10] Christ.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And what did the man said? Here's water.
[1:49:14] What does hinder me to be baptized? And
[1:49:16] he baptized him. As soon as he baptized
[1:49:17] him, Philip disappeared and was gone.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Listen, why uh brother Bam starts
[1:49:23] to teach this principle of spiritual
[1:49:25] multiplication? Why is a replenishing
[1:49:27] the earth through a spiritual new birth?
[1:49:30] New birth. Birth.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Back to the original commandment,
[1:49:34] friends. This goes all the way back to
[1:49:35] the mind of God.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; This Bible isn't 66 books. This Bible
[1:49:43] isn't a collection of stories. This
[1:49:44] Bible isn't fairy tales and stories
[1:49:47] pieced together. This is one thought God
[1:49:49] had and one desire that he had and the
[1:49:51] whole story is bringing it right back in
[1:49:53] a redemption cycle back to his original
[1:49:55] plan. Multiply and replenish the earth
[1:49:58] be a god race upon this earth.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And now he's accomplishing it through
[1:50:03] spiritual multiplication.
[1:50:06] And he says,"Wh
[1:50:08] if the angel of the Lord could tell
[1:50:12] Philillip
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; to go to the wilderness and draw
[1:50:16] alongside, why couldn't the angel of the
[1:50:18] Lord just go to the Ethiopian unic?"
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because
[1:50:28] the seed has got to be transferred from
[1:50:30] one life to the other." And he said,
[1:50:32] "Where is his seed?" He said his seed is
[1:50:36] in his body.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said where is my seed?
[1:50:40] Said my seed is in my body. Brother
[1:50:42] William Brandham's children came from
[1:50:43] him. Amen. And now where is the seed of
[1:50:47] Christ? It's in his body which is the
[1:50:49] bride. Amen. And listen, brother
[1:50:51] Brandham comes to the end of his
[1:50:52] ministry and he starts laying it down
[1:50:54] and he says the truth of this is in her
[1:50:57] and her alone. This seed life is only in
[1:51:00] the bride in the end time. The
[1:51:01] denomination system has ceased. He's
[1:51:03] done working with it. Amen. He's brought
[1:51:05] his life back through the opening of the
[1:51:07] word and the seven seal and placed it
[1:51:09] back in her and it's in her alone and
[1:51:11] she alone stands with it.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Back to a virgin wound, back to
[1:51:17] reproduce Christ.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Then he goes to another story.
[1:51:21] I love it.
[1:51:24] Then he goes to Peter
[1:51:27] going to Cornelius's house.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; He said God came to him. An angel came
[1:51:32] to him in a dream and in the dream told
[1:51:35] him, "What you need to do
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; is you need to go send somebody for
[1:51:42] Simon Peter. He's in Simon the Tanner's
[1:51:45] house in a city called Jap." I mean,
[1:51:47] this is detailed information.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Give him his address and who he's
[1:51:51] staying with. And I mean, told him all
[1:51:52] this. Go in there and he'll tell you
[1:51:54] what to do.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Listen. So, he sent for Peter. Peter
[1:51:59] came. He was a bit reluctant, but God
[1:52:01] had to show him in a vision of the sheet
[1:52:03] set down. Don't don't call unclean what
[1:52:04] I've called clean. And so he went, even
[1:52:07] with reluctance, he went to Cornelius's
[1:52:09] house and began to preach the word. And
[1:52:11] as he began to preach the word, the Holy
[1:52:12] Ghost fell on them. Amen. The same as it
[1:52:14] did on the day of Pentecost. And he
[1:52:16] says, "How can we prevent them that from
[1:52:17] water?" Amen. Seeing they receive the
[1:52:19] Holy Ghost the same as we. Yeah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham takes the story and
[1:52:23] he says if the angel could tell
[1:52:25] Cornelius where to find Peter and then
[1:52:27] he why couldn't he tell him the way of
[1:52:29] salvation? Why couldn't he preach him
[1:52:31] Christ? He said because the life has got
[1:52:33] to come from the body. It comes
[1:52:36] transverse from the body of Christ.
[1:52:38] Amen. Into another predestinated seed
[1:52:41] and it brings forth another son of God
[1:52:43] through spiritual multiplication.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; This is what the seed of Mary's been
[1:52:48] doing for 2,000 years.
[1:52:51] Then he goes to another story. Then
[1:52:53] brother, he goes, "Out of the mouth of
[1:52:54] two or three witnesses, let everything
[1:52:55] be established. Let every word." Now he
[1:52:58] comes to
[1:53:00] Paul the apostle. He was solid this time
[1:53:02] persecuting the church,
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; wreaking havoc at the church. Gets
[1:53:06] letters from Damascus to go down to the
[1:53:08] church and wreak some havoc there and
[1:53:09] hail them prisoner and haul them to
[1:53:11] prison and and break up their
[1:53:12] assemblies. And on the way down, he
[1:53:15] meets a pillar of fire. He meets the
[1:53:17] pillar of fire. Not a pillar of fire,
[1:53:18] the pillar of fire. And he asked the
[1:53:20] pillar of fire, "Who are you?" Because
[1:53:22] there was a voice that spoke out of it.
[1:53:23] And he said, "I am Jesus whom you
[1:53:26] persecute."
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; So who is Paul talking to? He's talking
[1:53:30] to Jesus Christ back in pillar of fire
[1:53:33] form like he was before.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And what is Jesus tell him?
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Go into the city and wait.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; I will send somebody to you. Amen.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Then God goes to Ananas said, "Listen,
[1:53:51] Ananas, I need you to do something for
[1:53:53] me. There's this Saul. I want you to go
[1:53:55] to him. I I He He's a chosen vessel.
[1:53:58] He's predestinated. He's mine, but he's
[1:54:00] got to make contact with the living
[1:54:02] word. He's got to come in physical
[1:54:04] contact with the living word for his day
[1:54:06] because he's got to be born again."
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And Ananas protest. Lord, you you know,
[1:54:12] you know this guy. You know, I've heard
[1:54:13] a lot of things like you're giving God
[1:54:15] information, you know.
[1:54:17] You may not have heard God, but I've
[1:54:19] heard.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go thy way, Ananas, for
[1:54:24] he's a chosen vessel unto me." And
[1:54:27] Ananas goes in and lays hands on Paul.
[1:54:30] Amen. God has sent me. And God opens his
[1:54:32] eyes. He's filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:34] He's baptized in Jesus' name. Amen. Why?
[1:54:36] Why? If if if Paul is talking to Jesus
[1:54:41] Christ in the pillar of fire, he's
[1:54:43] asking him, "Who are you, Lord?" He's
[1:54:44] saying, "I am Jesus." They're having a
[1:54:46] conversation. Why wouldn't Jesus himself
[1:54:49] in pillar of fire form tell him because
[1:54:52] life has to come through his body on the
[1:54:54] earth and his body on the earth was the
[1:54:57] church? And he just proved it to Paul
[1:54:59] because Paul never touched Jesus Christ
[1:55:01] in the flesh. Never brought a
[1:55:02] persecution against him. But he was
[1:55:04] persecuting the church. And Jesus says,
[1:55:07] "Why are you persecuting me?"
[1:55:14] So when Ananas came to him,
[1:55:18] that was Christ's body
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; coming to him.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram uses these three examples to
[1:55:25] show us that since the seed of Mary has
[1:55:29] come, he's made a way to replenish the
[1:55:32] earth again with sons and daughters of
[1:55:34] God. And now he's not doing it through
[1:55:36] first birth. That's been corrupted.
[1:55:38] That's why he had to be virgin born
[1:55:41] because the first birth was corrupted.
[1:55:43] Now there has to be a spiritual birth, a
[1:55:45] new birth. And now through the new
[1:55:47] birth, he's bringing the spiritual
[1:55:48] multiplication to replenish the earth to
[1:55:51] bring sons and daughters forth upon this
[1:55:53] earth.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And the life has to go from his body to
[1:55:58] others. Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Just like Mary bringing the promised
[1:56:03] word for her day to Elizabeth and
[1:56:05] Elizabeth was a dormant part of the word
[1:56:07] in her springs to life.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing that happened to
[1:56:10] you and I friends.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody with the word alive in them
[1:56:15] come to us
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; and shared the gospel, testified of the
[1:56:18] word for our day. And when it did,
[1:56:20] something inside of us come to life and
[1:56:22] begin to leap and jump. And
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; what was it? It was that predestinated
[1:56:26] life thing there.
[1:56:28] Praise be to God. I get so excited.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, what are we going to do now? Let's
[1:56:38] just start back at the beginning and
[1:56:39] start reading again. We want You want to
[1:56:41] go back to page one? No, let's turn to
[1:56:44] page. Let's go to page three now. We
[1:56:46] haven't made it this far yet.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I thought we'd read through
[1:56:51] this in one service and enjoy it and
[1:56:52] love it, but I'm enjoying it real good.
[1:56:54] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; This is the answer to brother Brandham's
[1:56:58] question.
[1:57:00] This is what his dilemma was. I got him
[1:57:02] out on a limb. The church is finished.
[1:57:04] No more church systems. The
[1:57:06] denominations are over. God's not going
[1:57:08] to use it. What's the answer? This is
[1:57:10] the answer. Come back to the original
[1:57:13] seed, the original word, the original
[1:57:15] life.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; That's the answer.
[1:57:20] Now he goes top of page three. Notice
[1:57:23] the harmony of the father and the son.
[1:57:26] Jesus never did anything until it was
[1:57:28] first showed him by the father. John
[1:57:30] 5:19.
[1:57:32] This harmony is now to exist between the
[1:57:34] groom and his bride. He shows her his
[1:57:37] word of life. She receives it. She never
[1:57:41] doubts it.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Almost pause, please.
[1:57:51] When you say she never doubts it,
[1:57:54] that doesn't mean the devil can't put
[1:57:56] questions in your mind.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of what Hebrews says
[1:58:01] of Abraham. Hebrews speaks of Abraham
[1:58:04] and says, "He staggered not at the
[1:58:06] promise of God, but drew strong in
[1:58:07] faith."
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; But go back and read the book of
[1:58:10] Genesis.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Looked like maybe, you know, there was
[1:58:16] some misunderstanding.
[1:58:18] Not maybe necessarily doubt. He believed
[1:58:19] the word of God, but how it would come
[1:58:21] to pass and all of that. There there was
[1:58:23] a bit Hey, listen. In our lives, there
[1:58:25] can be a bit of misstep and a bit of
[1:58:26] misunderstanding. But it doesn't matter.
[1:58:28] We're not doubting the word. That seed
[1:58:30] inside of us believes every bit of that
[1:58:32] word.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; We may get confused in our minds. We may
[1:58:35] make a misstep here or there or go on a
[1:58:37] detour once in a while, but it doesn't
[1:58:39] matter. The the the real believing is
[1:58:41] that seed down on the inside.
[1:58:44] He shows her his word of life. How did
[1:58:46] he show us the word of life? through a
[1:58:48] prophetic ministry in the end time. He
[1:58:50] has showed us his word of life. He has
[1:58:52] taken the veil off the Bible. He has
[1:58:54] opened the seven seals. Amen. When the
[1:58:56] prophet got through with that, he said,
[1:58:57] "My Bible's become a new book." Why? The
[1:58:59] veil has been taken off of the book. He
[1:59:01] shows her his word of life. She receives
[1:59:04] it.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; This is so simple.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; He unveils it. She receives it.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; And she never doubts it.
[1:59:17] Therefore,
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; circle therefore.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore is joining two thoughts
[1:59:24] together. The previous thought with the
[1:59:26] next thought. So what is the previous
[1:59:28] thought? The previous thought is
[1:59:31] he shows her his word of life. He's done
[1:59:33] that through the message.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; She receives it. We've done that by
[1:59:38] faith. She never doubts it because she's
[1:59:40] predestinated to believe.
[1:59:43] Therefore,
[1:59:45] nothing can harm her, not even death.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing. Remember Jesus looked at
[1:59:51] his disciples, he said, "Nothing shall
[1:59:53] ever hurt thee."
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing by shall by any means harm thee.
[1:59:57] And they looked at his disciples. Almost
[1:59:59] every one of them died a martyr's death
[2:00:00] except John. What does he mean nothing
[2:00:02] shall harm you? Because the real you is
[2:00:04] not this here. This is going to be made
[2:00:06] over again. But now that you've come to
[2:00:08] the reality of who you are, you've been
[2:00:10] born again by the spirit of God. Amen.
[2:00:11] You've received the word for your day.
[2:00:13] There is nothing ever going to harm you
[2:00:15] again. You were born harmed. You were
[2:00:17] born in darkness. You were born Amen.
[2:00:19] You were born a a backslider, a sinner.
[2:00:21] You were born in a sin flesh body. But
[2:00:23] praise be to God, once you've come to
[2:00:25] this realization, once he's opened the
[2:00:27] word to you and you receive it and you
[2:00:29] never doubt it, nothing will ever harm
[2:00:31] you again. Not even death.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Because you can't die. Eternal life is
[2:00:37] is living inside.
[2:00:42] For if the seed be planted,
[2:00:44] the water will raise it up again. What
[2:00:47] seed? The spoken word is the original
[2:00:51] seed.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; When he comes back and plants the
[2:00:54] original Listen, when Oh,
[2:00:59] all right. Bear with me for a minute.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Follow this thought through.
[2:01:04] Brother Brandham comes and he and he and
[2:01:06] he and he ties together all the loosens
[2:01:08] from the church ages to bring back the
[2:01:09] correct teaching, the correct doctrine,
[2:01:11] the faith of the fathers.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; But after that, he comes to the opening
[2:01:16] of the seals.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; And after he comes to the opening of the
[2:01:19] seals, he comes to the seven seal
[2:01:21] mystery. And he comes and he starts
[2:01:22] preaching it. And Christ is the mystery
[2:01:24] of God revealed. And when he gets to
[2:01:25] Christ and mystery of God revealed, he
[2:01:27] says, listen, he says there's been one
[2:01:30] thing in the whole Bible, one goal that
[2:01:33] God has had through the entire Bible.
[2:01:34] And every character in the Bible's been
[2:01:36] typing it and one thing that he's been
[2:01:38] trying to achieve in the entire Bible.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; So he comes back. He comes back and he
[2:01:46] takes everything that's been taught, the
[2:01:48] church ages, the understanding, the
[2:01:50] history, who Israel is, who who the
[2:01:52] gentile bride is, who Christ, and he
[2:01:55] ties it all together. And in the opening
[2:01:56] of the seals, he takes the veil off of
[2:01:58] redemption. Then he comes to the seventh
[2:02:00] seal, and he says, "Really, there's only
[2:02:02] been one thing in God's mind he wanted
[2:02:04] to achieve."
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram's not talking about
[2:02:06] doctrines
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; because every doctrine is to point to
[2:02:10] this truth.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. everyone godhead, water, babes,
[2:02:14] name, serpent, sea, they're all to point
[2:02:15] to this truth.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And he says, and he's unfolded it in a
[2:02:20] three-fold manner.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; One to get preeminence in a man. He did
[2:02:24] that in Christ Jesus. Now, to get
[2:02:25] preeminence in the people. He's doing
[2:02:27] that now. And to restore back Eden.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; What's it all about?
[2:02:35] It's all about God's original desire.
[2:02:39] multiply and replenish and bring forth
[2:02:42] me
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; as a family on this earth. Yeah, that's
[2:02:46] right.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; And when God comes to the end of the
[2:02:50] message in the end of the messenger, he
[2:02:52] wraps it up with this thought
[2:02:56] that it's all about him wanting to
[2:03:01] manifest himself
[2:03:03] in people
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; and flesh upon the earth and to live
[2:03:07] together as a family of God upon the
[2:03:10] earth. And that's what this whole Bible
[2:03:14] is about.
[2:03:19] If the seed be planted, the water will
[2:03:22] raise it up again.
[2:03:24] Here's the secret of this. The word is
[2:03:27] in the bride as it was in Mary. The
[2:03:30] bride has the mind of Christ, for she
[2:03:32] knows what he once done with the word.
[2:03:34] She performs the command of the word in
[2:03:37] his name, for she has thus saith the
[2:03:39] Lord. When the word is quickened by the
[2:03:42] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[2:03:44] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[2:03:46] planted and watered it comes to full
[2:03:48] harvest serving its purpose. How does
[2:03:52] she get the word? How does she know what
[2:03:54] thus sayeth the Lord on the word is
[2:03:55] because of a prophetic ministry.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Because the word she knows for sure what
[2:04:00] this word means and what the
[2:04:01] interpretation of it is because it's
[2:04:03] been given to her by a son of man
[2:04:05] ministry. Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[2:04:10] the word is quickened by the spirit,
[2:04:12] comes to pass like a seed that's been
[2:04:13] planted, watered, it comes the full
[2:04:15] harvest serving its purpose. This is the
[2:04:18] time for the full display of the word.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; He says,
[2:04:25] uh, now let's go. Let's let's look at
[2:04:27] this quote here.
[2:04:29] Paragraph 244. As Adam found his wife
[2:04:31] pregnant with the seed of death, as
[2:04:33] Satan's lie, she had accepted. Joseph
[2:04:36] found his wife pregnant with the seed of
[2:04:38] God, which is the word she accepted.
[2:04:41] What are we pregnant by? This word that
[2:04:44] we've accepted, which is Christ.
[2:04:48] It's the finishing of the mystery of
[2:04:50] God. It's what God had in his mind all
[2:04:52] along. It's the one thing that he wanted
[2:04:53] to achieve. It's his great plan through
[2:04:55] it all. And she has received that seed.
[2:05:01] When you re when you really realize that
[2:05:03] God has revealed to you the truth of the
[2:05:05] thing, there's nothing in the world is
[2:05:07] going to defeat you in it. That's all.
[2:05:09] You're absolutely undefeable.
[2:05:13] Not you,
[2:05:15] but God that's in you.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Not not not Christ, not not the body,
[2:05:20] but this the word that was in him. Not
[2:05:23] Mary, but the word that was born from
[2:05:26] her.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I want to stop here for a
[2:05:28] minute and think about Mary. Mary
[2:05:30] received the word from a me messenger
[2:05:32] said, "Be it unto me according to your
[2:05:34] word." That word, that word now took its
[2:05:37] place, its resting place in her womb and
[2:05:39] began to build cell upon cell upon cell.
[2:05:41] And it was building the body, amen, that
[2:05:43] Jehovah was going to dwell in upon this
[2:05:45] earth, the son of God. And as it was
[2:05:47] building, amen, it was taking over
[2:05:50] Mary's life. And listen, this word
[2:05:52] inside of her and her being a part of
[2:05:54] that word and carrying the predestinated
[2:05:56] word, amen, and and bringing it forth.
[2:05:59] Amen. Because of that, her life was now
[2:06:01] caught up in something so much bigger
[2:06:04] than she could ever dream. She was now a
[2:06:06] central figure in the Bible. Amen. And
[2:06:08] that being part of that word and having
[2:06:10] that living word inside of her now was
[2:06:13] directing her life, was directing
[2:06:14] everything about her life. Listen, she
[2:06:16] was in Nazareth, a spouse to a man to be
[2:06:19] married, but God injected himself there.
[2:06:21] Anyways, he talked to Joseph to so
[2:06:23] Joseph wouldn't put her away. Listen,
[2:06:25] Mary didn't have any explaining to do.
[2:06:28] Mary didn't have to defend herself. Mary
[2:06:29] had already said, "Be unto me according
[2:06:31] to your word." Whatever happened now,
[2:06:33] the Christ was living in her. So, God
[2:06:35] had to make provision for her. God had
[2:06:37] to go to Joseph, not Mary.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; God had to convince Joseph, not Mary,
[2:06:42] because now she's carrying the word. and
[2:06:45] God has got to watch over her life. And
[2:06:47] now there's prophecies that must be
[2:06:49] fulfilled in her life. And one of those
[2:06:51] prophecies is that this baby has to be
[2:06:54] born in the city of David. Well, Mary
[2:06:56] may not even even understood that. Mary
[2:06:58] may have heard and been read through I
[2:07:00] mean the scriptures and it never dawned
[2:07:02] on her that that was part of the word
[2:07:04] for her day, but it didn't need to dawn
[2:07:06] on her because it never left the mind of
[2:07:08] God. And she was part of the program of
[2:07:11] God. And God was going to work his
[2:07:12] program because his life was now
[2:07:14] injected inside of her. And she didn't
[2:07:16] have to figure it out. God was going to
[2:07:18] figure it out. If God had to move the
[2:07:20] heart of kings, he had to move nations.
[2:07:22] He had to move people in a census all
[2:07:24] over the world. Hey, listen. This was a
[2:07:26] worldwide census.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; God was moving politics. God was moving
[2:07:32] armies. God was moving uh laws,
[2:07:35] senators. He was moving What was he
[2:07:37] moving it for? Because there was a
[2:07:39] prophecy. Amen. that this baby has to
[2:07:41] come from the city of David and if he's
[2:07:43] got to raise up another emperor in Rome
[2:07:45] and that emperor gets suddenly a
[2:07:47] brainstorm one day all of his advisers
[2:07:49] around him might say you're nuts this is
[2:07:51] going to be so much work why are we
[2:07:52] doing this the Senate may have broke out
[2:07:54] in fights they may have threatened his
[2:07:56] life then everybody around the world in
[2:07:58] the in the habitated world at that point
[2:08:00] now they're all disrupted and everybody
[2:08:02] has to go back to their city of origin
[2:08:03] and people are moving all over the place
[2:08:05] so much so when they got to Bethlehem
[2:08:07] the ends were full there was no place to
[2:08:09] Today, people are dispersed. Amen. The
[2:08:11] the whole world is probably grinding
[2:08:13] their teeth and seething about
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; who this emperor was.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And it all happened because she had the
[2:08:21] word inside of her. And she didn't have
[2:08:23] to figure anything out. She didn't have
[2:08:24] to lift a finger to move it. God was
[2:08:27] moving it. Friend, we don't have to
[2:08:28] understand how God's going to do what
[2:08:30] he's going to do in the end time. all
[2:08:32] the prophecies that brother Brandham
[2:08:33] laid down. It's you be sure it's going
[2:08:35] to happen if he's got to raise up kings
[2:08:37] and knock them down and move nations and
[2:08:39] start fights and change the whole
[2:08:41] structure of the world. He's going to
[2:08:43] change it to bring forth what he
[2:08:45] promised to bring forth in this age.
[2:08:48] It'll happen just as sure as you're
[2:08:50] here. It's going to happen, friends. And
[2:08:53] you don't have to figure it out. You
[2:08:55] don't have to join conspiracy theories.
[2:08:57] You don't have to probe the internet for
[2:08:59] hours and listen to people sitting in
[2:09:01] their basement telling you what the
[2:09:02] government's doing. Forget about it all
[2:09:04] and stay with this word. Read the
[2:09:06] message. Listen to the tapes. Stay in
[2:09:08] your Bible. Stay in prayer. And stop
[2:09:11] roaming around the internet trying to
[2:09:13] figure out how God's going to bring to
[2:09:14] pass what brother prophesied. Cuz every
[2:09:17] time you get it wrong, every time.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; God never asked Mary to be smart. Amen.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; He never asked Mary to figure out the
[2:09:26] conspiracy.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; You know how many conspiracies were
[2:09:31] floating around when Caesar decided to
[2:09:33] tax the whole world?
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; But we know what the conspiracy was. And
[2:09:38] for us, it's not a theory. It's the
[2:09:40] truth. God had to get that woman from
[2:09:43] Nazareth to Bethlehem.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; And he disrupted the whole world to do
[2:09:47] it.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; God's got to get you to manifest the
[2:09:51] full life of Jesus Christ. And if he's
[2:09:53] got to disrupt my life, your life, and
[2:09:55] everyone around us, he'll disrupt it all
[2:09:57] to have that manifestation.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Everything he said would happen will
[2:10:01] happen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Boycott, gold system, whatever, it's all
[2:10:06] going to happen. But I it's not up to me
[2:10:08] to figure out how. Do you think Mary was
[2:10:10] sitting there one day and somebody come
[2:10:11] and said, "Mary, I saw this scripture
[2:10:13] where we got to go to Bethl." No.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; And then what does she do? Tell Caesar
[2:10:20] to bring a worldwide taxation.
[2:10:24] How many connections do you have in
[2:10:25] government?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we're supposed to
[2:10:32] do except believe the word and surrender
[2:10:35] to the headship of Christ. Let the
[2:10:37] spirit of God run our lives and stop
[2:10:40] using all our thinking.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Just stick with the word and let the
[2:10:44] spirit of God move us. Amen.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before, we'll say
[2:10:51] it again. Joseph might have been
[2:10:53] complaining all along the way.
[2:10:57] He probably didn't understand what was
[2:10:58] happening, but here he's got a hugely
[2:11:00] pregnant wife. She's uncomfortable. They
[2:11:02] probably had already made preparations,
[2:11:04] you know, for Nazareth. And now all of a
[2:11:05] sudden, this has come up and ruined all
[2:11:07] their plans. And they got to take this
[2:11:08] cross-country trip. And they're going
[2:11:10] down, and the baby could come any
[2:11:11] minute. And Joseph is probably not
[2:11:13] saying nice things about Caesar.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; And then when they get to Bethlehem and
[2:11:21] all the doors of the ends are closed,
[2:11:23] I'm sure he had other thoughts in his
[2:11:24] mind.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; But God was orchestrating every step
[2:11:30] perfect in line with his predestinated
[2:11:32] will and plan.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; And friends, we ain't got a thing to
[2:11:36] worry about.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; All we've got to do is say, "Lord, I
[2:11:39] believe."
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. be it unto me according to your
[2:11:43] word or your will.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to erase all of my own
[2:11:47] thinking and my predetermined plans of
[2:11:49] how you're going to do it. I want it to
[2:11:50] vanish out of my mind and I just want
[2:11:52] you to have your way with me.
[2:11:56] Oh, praise God, friends.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next paragraph.
[2:12:04] Those in the bride do only his will.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] No one can make them do otherwise. They
[2:12:12] have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep
[2:12:14] still. They know that it has to be God
[2:12:17] in them doing the works, fulfilling his
[2:12:19] own word. Let's read that slowly.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:25] They know that it has to be God in them
[2:12:28] doing the works.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Do we know that?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; We should know that. We need to know
[2:12:35] that. We need to know it every minute of
[2:12:37] the day that it has to be God in us
[2:12:40] fulfilling his word, doing his works,
[2:12:43] fulfilling his own word. He did not
[2:12:46] complete all his work while in his
[2:12:47] earthly ministry. So now he works in and
[2:12:50] through the bride.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says again spoke word. Now this
[2:12:56] body is to do the same because the body
[2:12:58] is the head and body is together. That's
[2:13:00] right. Christ is the head was the word.
[2:13:02] His body has to be the same thing as his
[2:13:04] head was. That's right. A church of the
[2:13:06] word, born of the word, virgin born from
[2:13:09] the word, not denomination now. Virgin
[2:13:11] born from the word. The way the body
[2:13:13] operates is by the head. She can do
[2:13:16] nothing except what the headship of the
[2:13:18] word is already said. And if she doesn't
[2:13:21] understand what to do, she's going to
[2:13:24] keep still until she gets thus sayeth
[2:13:26] the Lord. And thus sayeth the Lord is
[2:13:28] the word that has been revealed.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:32] until she understands she's not going to
[2:13:34] press forward presuming anymore. That's
[2:13:36] what got every other bride in trouble
[2:13:38] was presuming. But this bride is not
[2:13:40] going to move forward presuming. She's
[2:13:42] just going to hold steady and let God
[2:13:43] figure it out.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; We've seen enough history down through
[2:13:46] the Bible to realize that we can't go
[2:13:49] back to human reasoning. We can't go
[2:13:50] back to figuring things out. We're going
[2:13:52] to have to hold steady with what God's
[2:13:54] given us and wait for God to open the
[2:13:56] door. Wait for God to rescue. Wait for
[2:13:58] God to bring revelation.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] So now he works his plan through his
[2:14:05] body. He's the headship come this in
[2:14:08] this age unite with the body so that he
[2:14:10] can get full control of the body so that
[2:14:12] he can finish the work that he left for
[2:14:14] this time.
[2:14:17] He says now watch remember God's law of
[2:14:19] reproduction.
[2:14:21] God's law of reproduction
[2:14:24] remember after its kind. That's right.
[2:14:26] The seed of Christ the word must come
[2:14:28] through the body. Are you getting tired?
[2:14:31] All right, just a minute now. Let's just
[2:14:32] hold quiet and pray. I want to get this
[2:14:35] in real good. I want this to grind down.
[2:14:37] The seed of Christ must mu s must come
[2:14:40] through his body. Not through a
[2:14:42] denomination, but through a bornaged
[2:14:44] seed of the word must come through. Now
[2:14:46] remember what is it? Christ's seed. How
[2:14:49] does my seed come? Through the body. How
[2:14:52] does the apple tree seed come? Through
[2:14:54] the body. Seed is through the body. And
[2:14:56] the church is the body of Christ. That's
[2:14:58] right. The Bible church the birth
[2:15:00] produces that's the new birth himself in
[2:15:04] body
[2:15:05] Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; his church is his word so that the
[2:15:13] people can see the confirmation of
[2:15:14] Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is saying
[2:15:16] yesterday today and forever
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; next paragraph
[2:15:22] she knows that what does she know that
[2:15:25] he didn't complete all his work in his
[2:15:27] earthly ministry
[2:15:29] So now he works in and through the
[2:15:30] bride. She knows that for it was not yet
[2:15:33] time for him to do certain things that
[2:15:35] he must now do.
[2:15:39] He must now do.
[2:15:44] He didn't say she must now do. I think
[2:15:48] we got the point now.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; He must now do.
[2:15:53] But he will. I like that little word
[2:15:57] now. fulfill through the bride that work
[2:16:00] which he left for this specific time.
[2:16:06] Do you believe he'll do it?
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; You think he's going to do it, you know,
[2:16:11] because you're smart, because you're
[2:16:14] strong? Because you got it all figured
[2:16:16] out? No. He's going to do it. But what
[2:16:17] does he need? He needs the same thing he
[2:16:20] did in his first earthly ministry. He
[2:16:21] needed somebody who would believe him.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; He needed the same thing he needed with
[2:16:26] Abraham. somebody that would believe his
[2:16:28] word. He needed the same thing he's
[2:16:29] always needed. Somebody on this earth
[2:16:31] who would believe him and receive the
[2:16:33] word for the hour they live in to let
[2:16:35] that word manifest through him. That's
[2:16:36] what he had in Noah. That's what he had
[2:16:37] in David and Jeremiah and Moses. He had
[2:16:40] in each one of them. He had somebody who
[2:16:42] would receive the word for their day,
[2:16:44] believe it, and let it manifest through
[2:16:46] them.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to do in this
[2:16:50] day.
[2:16:53] Brother says, 'When the Methodists
[2:16:54] failed, God raised up others. And so it
[2:16:57] was gone on through the years until this
[2:16:59] last day. There is again another people
[2:17:01] in the land who under their messenger
[2:17:03] will be the final voice
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; She is now the mouthpiece of God. God is
[2:17:11] using her to speak the word to bring
[2:17:13] spiritual multiplication upon the earth.
[2:17:16] What is it she's speaking? Not her
[2:17:17] thoughts,
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; not her mind, her his word.
[2:17:22] That's what she's speaking. And that's
[2:17:24] why he says those under their messenger
[2:17:26] because our messenger was the prophet
[2:17:28] that God sent to this day to restore the
[2:17:30] word. And through that messenger, amen,
[2:17:32] he brought back the headstone Christ,
[2:17:34] the fullness of the word with the full
[2:17:36] life and united to unite with a body.
[2:17:39] And now that headship is now the
[2:17:41] headship that's directing the body.
[2:17:43] Amen. That's why this bride must stay
[2:17:46] under the messenger. Yes,
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; we can't outprofit the prophet. We can't
[2:17:52] out know, brother Brandon. We can't do
[2:17:54] those things, friend. Because if you do,
[2:17:55] we're going to get ourselves all twisted
[2:17:57] up and mess up like every other church
[2:17:59] has messed up. But God already sent
[2:18:01] through his voice, restored his word in
[2:18:04] full measure and brought everything we
[2:18:06] need in the message. And we got to stay
[2:18:08] under that headship.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; And if we don't stay under, if we feel
[2:18:11] ourselves equal to or above and know
[2:18:13] things better than he knew or listen, we
[2:18:15] can't do that, friends. And the minute
[2:18:17] we do that, we're going down the same
[2:18:18] old path that every church age has gone
[2:18:20] down.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; We got to stay under because this we've
[2:18:24] got the word. The word was given to us
[2:18:26] through a prophetic ministry of thus
[2:18:27] sayeth the Lord on the word through a
[2:18:29] prophetic ministry and shall have thus
[2:18:31] sayeth the Lord or she'll keep still.
[2:18:32] And if we didn't see it and we don't
[2:18:34] understand it through the message, then
[2:18:36] just keep still.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; And let God bring his word to pass.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this last quote.
[2:18:46] proving his word. And Jesus said, "As it
[2:18:48] was in the days of Sodom, now watch
[2:18:51] close. In the days of Sodom, so will it
[2:18:53] be at the coming of the Son of Man, when
[2:18:55] the Son of Man is being revealed. Not no
[2:18:58] more as a church. See, not no more the
[2:19:00] bride is called." See, in that day the
[2:19:03] Son of Man will be revealed. What? To
[2:19:05] join the church to the head, unite the
[2:19:08] marriage of the bride.
[2:19:11] The bridegroom call will come right
[2:19:13] through this. When the son of man will
[2:19:15] come down and come in human flesh, what
[2:19:18] human flesh is he referring to?
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; It's referring his.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; He was a son of man, revealing the son
[2:19:25] of man, Jesus Christ.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Just like in Sodom, what happened in
[2:19:29] Sodom? God came down in human flesh,
[2:19:31] turned his back to the tent, and
[2:19:33] discerned Sarah's thoughts behind it.
[2:19:36] God did the same thing in our day.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; To join the church today, unite the
[2:19:41] marriage of the bride. The bridegroom
[2:19:42] call will come right through this. When
[2:19:44] the son of man will come down and come
[2:19:45] in human flesh to unite the two
[2:19:47] together, the church has to be the word.
[2:19:50] He is the word and the two unites
[2:19:52] together. And to do that, it'll take the
[2:19:55] manifestation of the revealing of the
[2:19:58] son of man.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; The son of man is the prophetic ministry
[2:20:01] of Jesus Christ on earth.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; And that was replicated through brother
[2:20:05] Brandham's ministry. It was Jesus Christ
[2:20:08] using that tabernacle to show us, I'm
[2:20:10] here.
[2:20:12] Amen.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, not a clergyman. Oh, don't I
[2:20:16] don't know. I do. You see what I mean?
[2:20:19] It's son of man. Jesus Christ will come
[2:20:21] down in human flesh among us and will
[2:20:24] make his word so real that it'll unite
[2:20:26] the church and him as one, the bride.
[2:20:28] And then she'll go home to the wedding
[2:20:30] supper. Amen. She's already united. See,
[2:20:33] we go to the wedding supper, not the
[2:20:35] marriage. Fill your flesh self with the
[2:20:37] flesh of mighty men cuz the marriage of
[2:20:38] the lamb has come. But the rapture is
[2:20:40] going to the wedding supper when the
[2:20:42] word here unites with the person and
[2:20:44] they two become one. And then what does
[2:20:47] it do then? It manifests the son of man
[2:20:49] again. Not the church theologians. The
[2:20:52] son of man. The word and the church
[2:20:54] becomes one. Whatever the son of man
[2:20:56] done, he was the word. The church does
[2:20:59] the same thing.
[2:21:04] This message came to make the word so
[2:21:08] real
[2:21:11] to unite the bride on earth with the
[2:21:14] heavenly bridegroom to unite the two
[2:21:15] together so that she becomes one with
[2:21:18] the word so that the word has a place to
[2:21:20] live through in her and what will do
[2:21:22] it'll reproduce his life again.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go all the way back to the first
[2:21:29] page.
[2:21:32] I want to read something in the middle
[2:21:33] of the first page, right dead center
[2:21:38] of our little booklet. In the last days,
[2:21:40] the true bride church, Christ's seed,
[2:21:43] will come to the headstone, which is
[2:21:45] him. That's the marriage. When the
[2:21:47] headstone comes to the body,
[2:21:51] and she will be the super church,
[2:21:54] a super race as she nears him.
[2:21:59] What super race? What super church?
[2:22:04] Listen, I'm going slow and I'm
[2:22:07] whispering because I could get so
[2:22:09] excited we could take off like a rocket
[2:22:11] right now.
[2:22:15] What did God want originally upon this
[2:22:17] earth? A super race.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; What was a super race? God in flesh.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; There's a super race.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:29] God brought Adam. He brought Adam's
[2:22:33] wife, told him to replenish, fill the
[2:22:36] earth with the Christ seed, but they
[2:22:38] failed. But God brought back his seed
[2:22:40] through a virgin womb of Mary. And when
[2:22:42] he come back, what was he? He was the
[2:22:44] super seed.
[2:22:46] He was the head of the super race. He
[2:22:49] was the beginning of the creation of
[2:22:51] God. What was he? He was the super seed.
[2:22:54] God in human flesh. Amen.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Remember, and through that
[2:23:03] he brought back the multiplication of
[2:23:06] replenishing the earth. In the end, when
[2:23:09] the headship, the word unites with the
[2:23:11] body, she will be a super church.
[2:23:15] Listen, what makes her a super church?
[2:23:18] We can have all kinds of ideas and
[2:23:19] there's some things a lot of things
[2:23:20] brother Ben Brandham said but what makes
[2:23:22] her a super church is because the super
[2:23:24] one is now living inside of her
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; and she has his potentials.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Meaning there's nothing that is
[2:23:34] impossible to those that believe. She's
[2:23:37] become a super church cuz the super
[2:23:39] life, the original life, the original
[2:23:41] seed, the original word, the original
[2:23:43] everything has come back into bride form
[2:23:45] now. And she's the pregnantated daughter
[2:23:47] of God. She's the pregnant wife of Jesus
[2:23:49] Christ. And now whatever God wants, he
[2:23:52] can bring through that body because he's
[2:23:54] super because the super God is now
[2:23:57] dwelling in his people.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; What makes her a super race? So what is
[2:24:01] the super race? The super race is the
[2:24:04] God race, the Christ seed. God in a many
[2:24:07] membered body.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; We think of super church and super race.
[2:24:12] we immediately go to supernatural things
[2:24:14] and supernatural signs. Listen, all of
[2:24:16] that is possible.
[2:24:19] It was showed in the in the messenger
[2:24:21] that was sent to us. Brother Baron was
[2:24:22] the first part of that harvest to come
[2:24:24] to maturity. And he showed he could
[2:24:25] create through that vessel. He could
[2:24:27] speak to storms and they would listen.
[2:24:29] He could create squirrels where there
[2:24:31] was no squirrels. He had control over
[2:24:33] nature. He could create. He could speak
[2:24:35] to tumors. God could use him to do all
[2:24:37] to bring back life to open blinded eyes
[2:24:40] to do everything. What was it? He was
[2:24:41] showing that we're coming to the super
[2:24:43] race. It's all there. She has his
[2:24:45] potentials.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; But what makes this a super race is with
[2:24:51] all the potentials and all the life and
[2:24:53] the super life inside of her, she has
[2:24:56] thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's under the control of the
[2:25:02] headship. And whatever the headship
[2:25:03] wants to do as he moves down into the
[2:25:05] body, he can do it all. And there's a
[2:25:08] people on this earth that can believe it
[2:25:09] all. Amen. When he was here the first
[2:25:11] time, Amen. Peter walked on water.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus walked on water, broke loaves and
[2:25:18] fish, healed the dead, opened blinded
[2:25:20] eyes. It happened again in our day,
[2:25:22] friends. And God is there's nothing
[2:25:23] that's limiting now. Nothing is limiting
[2:25:26] this bride. She's a super church, a
[2:25:28] super race because the super life of
[2:25:29] Jesus Christ is now living in her. She's
[2:25:32] been married to the super one. And now
[2:25:34] through a super life in her, she's the
[2:25:35] super church. She's coming back to the
[2:25:37] super race through spiritual
[2:25:38] multiplication. And she can do the super
[2:25:41] works.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; But she's not going to do them herself.
[2:25:45] She's going to do them because he's
[2:25:46] doing it in her. Cuz he will fulfill the
[2:25:48] portion he left for this day. It'll be
[2:25:51] him and her. But it takes her
[2:25:53] surrendering to him. And it takes
[2:25:54] somebody that'll say, "I believe it."
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; What's the good of having superpower and
[2:26:00] super church and a super race if the
[2:26:01] people it's in don't believe it's
[2:26:02] possible? We got to believe it's
[2:26:04] possible, friend. that there's nothing
[2:26:05] that'll hinder God. There's no
[2:26:07] limitations to the power and life of God
[2:26:09] that has been released to the bride in
[2:26:10] this age.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; And when God needs to, he'll do it. When
[2:26:14] he wants to, he'll do it. He just needs
[2:26:15] somebody who will believe him.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God never did super duper
[2:26:21] things cuz he felt like it.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; When he did the super duper things, it
[2:26:25] was because his headship told him to.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; And under the direction of the headship,
[2:26:30] he believed it.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; And it happened.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't fret, friends. There's no
[2:26:39] more fretting.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; My soul does magnify the Lord.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; For he's looked on the lowest state of
[2:26:45] his handmaiden. He has brought down
[2:26:47] those who are high, but he's lifted us
[2:26:49] up, friends, and my soul does magnify
[2:26:52] the Lord.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of times we don't feel
[2:26:55] like a super church,
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; but we don't care about feelings
[2:26:59] anymore. Amen. Amen.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; We don't feel like a super race. Listen,
[2:27:04] the super race is not what goes on
[2:27:06] between our ears and not what we do with
[2:27:08] the work of our hands. The super race is
[2:27:10] the life of God quickening the seed
[2:27:12] inside of us. Christ bringing life to
[2:27:15] the sons of daughters of God.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; That's the super race. And one day it's
[2:27:20] going to manifest itself in full when
[2:27:22] that life is on this earth again with
[2:27:25] Christ when he sets up his millennial
[2:27:28] kingdom. Listen, these bodies are going
[2:27:30] to change.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to go back from hybrid to
[2:27:34] original. Inside, we've come to
[2:27:36] original. Outside, we're coming back to
[2:27:39] original. Friends,
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; let's all stand.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; To fulfill what? God's original desire.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; All of this is about his original
[2:27:50] desire. It was interrupted. But the book
[2:27:53] of redemption is about bringing back his
[2:27:55] original desire.
[2:27:58] musicians, if you could come and brother
[2:27:59] Blake, if you could come. Let's just bow
[2:28:02] our heads together.
[2:28:04] Dear heavenly father, we thank you,
[2:28:06] Lord.
[2:28:08] God, the things that we talk about, the
[2:28:10] things that you've shared with us
[2:28:11] through your prophet, they're so real to
[2:28:14] us, Lord. They resonate inside. But God,
[2:28:17] and in our human thinking, they seem so
[2:28:20] impossible.
[2:28:22] God, what you have done, like you did in
[2:28:24] Mary, like you did in Elizabeth, like
[2:28:26] you've done in David, like you did in
[2:28:28] Moses, like you've done through all of
[2:28:29] your children down through time, through
[2:28:32] fishermen and tax collectors. God,
[2:28:34] you've been able to take vessels and
[2:28:36] fill them with your power and use them
[2:28:38] for your glory.
[2:28:40] And God, we believe what your prophet
[2:28:42] has taught in this end time. Lord,
[2:28:44] you're coming back to unite with your
[2:28:46] bride and you're going to manifest
[2:28:49] yourself as a many membered body in
[2:28:51] bride form. But God, we know that it has
[2:28:55] to be you fulfilling your word. We know
[2:28:58] that it has to be you doing the work
[2:29:00] that you left for this specific time and
[2:29:01] you'll do it in and through the bride.
[2:29:03] Lord, it's not us. It's not our works.
[2:29:05] It's not our ability. We have none,
[2:29:07] Lord. But it's your mind, your word,
[2:29:09] your strength, your power, your spirit.
[2:29:12] And God, we just surrender to it. You
[2:29:15] who could take Mary and you could
[2:29:17] fulfill your promise through her. Lord,
[2:29:20] you can take us and you can fulfill your
[2:29:22] promise through us. God, I pray that you
[2:29:24] would give us greater faith, Lord, than
[2:29:26] we've ever had before. Take the eyes and
[2:29:29] wash our eyes clean. May we perceive all
[2:29:31] that you're doing in this hour. And God,
[2:29:34] may we realize what super thing you're
[2:29:36] doing in this hour with a superpower
[2:29:39] that's released by a super word that's
[2:29:42] brought back the original seed life.
[2:29:45] Lord, we're so thankful.
[2:29:48] God, we want to surrender to you in
[2:29:50] greater ways, Lord. God, help us to
[2:29:54] relax and allow you to take control.
[2:29:57] Help us to surrender our thinking and
[2:29:59] our own ambitions and our own goals and
[2:30:01] lay them all down at your feet. Lord,
[2:30:04] there's nothing in this hour that can
[2:30:06] compare to this truth.
[2:30:08] Lord, for this is the transition that
[2:30:11] you brought the prophet to. That the
[2:30:13] church systems are dead, but now you're
[2:30:14] calling forth a bride. Lord, the first
[2:30:17] virgin failed, so you brought another.
[2:30:21] Lord, the first church failed, so now
[2:30:22] you're bringing back another. and we
[2:30:24] believe by your grace that we're part of
[2:30:26] that. Lord, now we're just saying, Lord,
[2:30:30] have your way in me. I surrender to you.
[2:30:34] Give us the faith to believe that all
[2:30:36] things are possible. May we realize
[2:30:38] there's no hindrances, Lord, to this
[2:30:40] word. There's no obstacles that you
[2:30:42] won't overcome. There's nothing that can
[2:30:44] defeat your purpose. And if your purpose
[2:30:46] in us, then there's nothing that can
[2:30:47] defeat us because it's your purpose in
[2:30:49] us. There's nothing that will stop this
[2:30:52] prophecy from coming forth. There's
[2:30:54] nothing to stop you from fulfilling your
[2:30:55] word. You've already set it in motion.
[2:30:58] And may we believe in the impossible.
[2:31:00] May we believe in all things. May we
[2:31:03] keep moving forward with joy, Lord, and
[2:31:05] rest in our hearts and an excitement
[2:31:07] about what you're doing because
[2:31:09] everything is possible because the
[2:31:12] headship is here working in the body.
[2:31:14] May we be your hands and your mouth and
[2:31:16] your eyes and your feet. Whatever part
[2:31:18] you want us to be, may we play it, Lord.
[2:31:20] May we surrender to you and may your
[2:31:22] headship, your word, the the truth that
[2:31:24] you've restored to us, may it guide our
[2:31:26] every step and our every motion.
[2:31:28] And Lord, teach us when we're unsure to
[2:31:31] be still.
[2:31:33] Teach us, Lord, not to feel the pressure
[2:31:35] of figuring out or moving forward, but
[2:31:38] help us to be able to rest under your
[2:31:40] headship and trust you as our husband.
[2:31:43] That you will reveal when the time is
[2:31:45] right. You will show when we need to see
[2:31:47] and you will move in us when it's time
[2:31:49] to move. While we love you, we ask your
[2:31:52] blessing upon us, Lord. I bless your
[2:31:55] blessing upon all your people. And may

[2:35:43] of my home. Outwardly
[2:35:48] and outwardly I have nothing,
[2:35:52] not much to behold.
[2:35:56] Hardly the place for his word to unfold.
[2:36:04] But if I just steal this vessel,
[2:36:08] let him have his way
[2:36:11] from glory unto glory.
[2:36:15] Change me day by day.
