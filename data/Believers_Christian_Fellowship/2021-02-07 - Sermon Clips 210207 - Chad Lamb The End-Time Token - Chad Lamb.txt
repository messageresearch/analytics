TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's not about getting every conduct right amen it's an attitude it's an approach amen it's an understanding of what's been given us in this day that word is christ amen how can i want christ to dwell in me when i will not even surrender to christ the message of the hour that was preached through a prophet when he says women don't cut your hair and i cut my hair and don't wear makeup i wear makeup amen those things seem like simple things but they're huge in the eyes of god because it shows where your heart is amen because when you start to ask well what does it matter and why and how long is long and all these questions all you're doing is saying i want you but i want you as long as i can have some of me that's the real problem the real problem with the question is how long is long amen is not the question how long is long and because the holy ghost will reveal to you how long is long the real question is is how much of myself can i bring into this relationship so we think like these seem like trivial issues why is it trivial when brother branham preaches all through 63 64-65 because he's showing you want christ but you want christ according the way cain wanted christ according to his own will amen but you don't come to this word trying to hold on to your own idea amen your own desires and your own will but you come to this word not legalistically like if i don't cut my hair and don't wear makeup he'll give me the holy ghost that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a full surrender to the full word of god an absolute acknowledgement of who is here who is present amen it's not a message of brother branham this is jesus christ amen and if it's just brother brethren's message it's subject to my opinions and my alterings and my [Music] see the whole problem with with dress and attitude and conduct and dirty jokes and and watching worldly movies and all that stuff listen friends it has nothing to do with that it's not like if i can cut out all the worldly movies and wear my hair right and dress right i'm going to get the holy ghost that's not it but it displays your attitude towards jesus christ i hope that strikes home because we've made it too much about the hair and about the makeup and about the movies and about that it's not about that it's about your heart and no condition to receive him until you hate it all amen until you're willing to give it all up amen i hate amen i hate any desire that i have that's contrary to the word i hate it amen i want it going i want it washed out of me because all i want this word is so beautiful it's so magnificent this message is so perfect that's the only thing that i want and i want everything else to go away [Music] you may not yet have the strength or the capacity to make it go away but there sure ought to be a desire not not ought to be there must be a desire in you amen for all of it to be gone and just that word to live in me that's coming with the right approach that's the right attitude amen that's the right desire and when you come to god that way all you have to do is ask for your father for the holy spirit he'll give it to you
