[5:01] [Music]
[5:08] desire
[5:11] [Music]
[5:18] amen god bless you all i enjoyed
[5:22] singing without a mask on i just wanted
[5:25] to take
[5:26] the opportunity to do that since you all
[5:28] can't
[5:29] so i really happy to be here and he may
[5:31] be seated for just a second
[5:33] just talk to you for a second here and
[5:36] um had a really nice time up at the
[5:39] ministers meeting
[5:40] over the weekend and uh just wanted to
[5:42] express my
[5:44] my thankfulness to brother dan who would
[5:46] arrange it and the brothers that came
[5:47] and attended it was
[5:48] it was really good so you'll have to nod
[5:51] for me because everybody behind that
[5:52] just kind of throwing me for a loop
[5:54] i guess the good thing is i can't see
[5:56] you frown if i say something wrong
[5:58] um but yeah so it just had a really nice
[6:01] time and i really appreciated the
[6:02] brothers that came it was just such a
[6:04] nice atmosphere
[6:05] of the brothers that came and it was a
[6:07] really a great opportunity i
[6:09] i thought to just be able to get
[6:10] together and just talk about the things
[6:12] of god
[6:13] and it was quite an interesting
[6:15] situation with brother chad being
[6:16] asked to speak no doubt and i can see
[6:19] the hand of god in it for
[6:21] as well you know but you know like he
[6:23] said he would have been quite burdened
[6:24] and nervous coming but
[6:25] now i'm bearing the burden of my brother
[6:27] but that's scriptural we're supposed to
[6:29] bear one another's burdens and i want to
[6:30] be found faithful to bear the burden of
[6:32] my brother and
[6:34] so here we are today i'm bearing the
[6:37] burden
[6:38] but i just was up praying and you all
[6:41] know me enough by now i have nothing to
[6:43] put on for anybody
[6:44] so i just tell you how i come to these
[6:47] things
[6:48] i don't like to preach like i really
[6:51] don't like to stand here it's a scary
[6:53] thing always scares me always bothers me
[6:55] i literally was up till past midnight
[6:57] last night couldn't sleep all night up
[6:59] at three praying this morning
[7:01] not because there isn't a lot of word
[7:03] like we have a lot of word
[7:05] and anybody with an education could take
[7:06] some scriptures and take some quotes and
[7:08] put it together and put together a
[7:09] pretty great
[7:10] subject matter that we all would would
[7:12] love right but it's that burden you have
[7:14] to catch the mind of god
[7:16] and the spirit of god and just say what
[7:17] he wants you to say and then to say no
[7:19] more
[7:20] and that's i'm learning that i think we
[7:22] all have to learn that by obedience to
[7:23] just say what he said and then be quiet
[7:26] when he doesn't want you to say anything
[7:27] more so i was up praying you know and
[7:30] seeking the lord and
[7:31] i'm like well you know i'm kind of i go
[7:33] by inspiration a lot of times and i wait
[7:36] and i wait and i wait
[7:38] and nothing's coming to me like i'm like
[7:40] lord this is torture
[7:42] this is absolutely tor it's midnight and
[7:44] i'm like i have no idea what i'm
[7:45] ministering on
[7:46] no idea i know some people think wow
[7:48] you're crazy you're talking crazy
[7:50] certainly you have something like no i
[7:52] have nothing i have no thoughts you have
[7:54] thoughts but you don't know what is his
[7:55] his will in the whole thing right
[7:57] and then i got to looking at my subject
[7:58] matter and i told brother chad i said
[8:00] maybe it's because the subject matter
[8:01] i'm going into
[8:02] i'm waiting for god to move upon me i'm
[8:04] waiting for something i'm waiting for a
[8:06] mighty rushing wind i'm waiting for a
[8:08] fire i'm waiting for a thunder to say
[8:10] this is my will walk you in it go tell
[8:12] them this you know
[8:13] and it's not happening that way it's
[8:16] just real calm
[8:17] you know i just had a little thought and
[8:19] that little thought i just said well
[8:21] i'll just bring that and if that's the
[8:23] still small voice speaking then that's
[8:25] just what i want to say
[8:26] is just what he wants us to say because
[8:28] we don't want to be found doing anything
[8:29] other than what his will
[8:30] is and his will is his word as well as
[8:33] his word so
[8:34] i trust that this little thought for you
[8:36] will be okay
[8:37] you all love me right okay so you have
[8:40] no choice then
[8:41] no matter what and how bad i i blow it
[8:44] you're going to love me either way and
[8:45] you're going to put your arm around me
[8:46] and say i love you
[8:47] and that's what we do as christians
[8:49] right look beyond
[8:51] the faults and mistakes of a man and his
[8:52] insecurities and his
[8:54] failures and say i love that that that
[8:57] little attribute of god that manifests
[8:59] in you
[9:00] so why don't you stand
[9:04] and if you will turn in your bibles to
[9:05] first corinthians
[9:07] chapters 2.
[9:17] so having been one with a mask in church
[9:19] i do know that you yawn a lot for lack
[9:22] of oxygen i am sympathetic to that
[9:25] and i can't see it so it's okay but if
[9:27] you pitch
[9:28] over i will call you out
[9:32] it's just the reality of it i know i sit
[9:33] back and i'm like i'm glad brother chad
[9:35] can't see how many times i'm yawning
[9:36] right now
[9:37] it's not because i'm i'm just lack of
[9:39] oxygen you're about to pass out
[9:41] sometimes you feel
[9:42] so don't pass out stay awake stay alert
[9:45] okay
[9:45] and i can't hear you so you'll have to
[9:48] say amen a little louder
[9:50] right say if you agree with it take a
[9:52] hold of it right
[9:53] we don't just let it pass by we say hey
[9:55] that's mine i'm taking a hold of it we
[9:57] don't want to just be a hero not a doer
[9:59] of the word we want to take it make it
[10:00] ours right
[10:01] so we want to participate in these
[10:03] things
[10:04] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1
[10:07] and i brethren when i came to you came
[10:09] not with excellency of speech
[10:11] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[10:13] testimony of god
[10:15] for i determined not to know anything
[10:18] among you
[10:18] save jesus christ and him crucified and
[10:21] i was with you in weakness and in fear
[10:23] and in much trembling
[10:25] and my speech and my preaching was not
[10:27] with enticing words of man's wisdom
[10:29] but in the demonstration the spirit and
[10:31] of power that your faith should not
[10:33] stand
[10:34] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[10:36] god
[10:38] and if you also turn to first kings 19
[10:44] 9.
[10:51] first kings 19 9.
[11:03] just stay amen when you're there okay
[11:06] i can't hear you that's good and he came
[11:09] this
[11:10] unto a cave and he lodged there and
[11:11] behold the word of the lord came to him
[11:14] and he said unto him what doest thou
[11:17] hear elijah
[11:18] and he said i have been very jealous for
[11:20] the lord god of hosts
[11:22] for the children of israel have forsaken
[11:24] thy covenant
[11:25] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[11:28] prophets with the sword
[11:30] and i even i only am left and they seek
[11:33] my life
[11:34] to take it away and he said go forth and
[11:38] stand upon the mount before the lord and
[11:40] behold the lord passed by
[11:42] and a great and strong wind rent the
[11:44] mountains and break in pieces the rocks
[11:47] before the lord
[11:48] but the lord was not in the wind and
[11:50] after the wind an
[11:52] earthquake but the lord was not in the
[11:54] earthquake
[11:55] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[11:58] lord was not in the fire
[12:00] and after the fire a still small voice
[12:04] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[12:06] he wrapped his face in his mantle and he
[12:08] went out
[12:09] and stood in the entering of the cave
[12:11] and behold there came a voice unto him
[12:13] and said
[12:14] what doest thou hear elijah if you will
[12:17] just bow your heads for word of prayer
[12:20] most gracious heavenly father lord we
[12:22] just come before you lord
[12:25] lord humbly lord we come before your
[12:26] throne lord of mercy this morning and
[12:29] lord we ask lord that you would do that
[12:30] which we cannot do in another
[12:32] cell father that you would take the word
[12:34] lord and break it and give it to us
[12:36] father
[12:37] lord god we are a needy people and lord
[12:40] we're learning as we're going lord is
[12:42] lord you learned obedience to the things
[12:44] that you suffered father god so are we
[12:46] and
[12:46] i just pray lord you take the little
[12:48] burden and thought that's in my heart
[12:49] lord and that you could bring it to your
[12:51] people that it would bless them and help
[12:52] them lord
[12:53] i know my insufficiency and i know my
[12:56] dependence it's a complete dependence
[12:58] so father god i just pray lord that you
[13:00] would take this vessel
[13:01] lord shut my mouth to any of my own
[13:03] thoughts and let me just speak which you
[13:05] would once said
[13:06] and father god may you help the people
[13:08] that are before me lord your
[13:10] most precious people father lord that
[13:12] they could receive the things that you
[13:14] want to say to them
[13:15] lord that it could set them free that it
[13:17] could call them up higher
[13:19] that it would reveal to them the
[13:20] spiritual realities of their sonship
[13:22] father and lord i just pray lord that
[13:25] you would be glorified in everything
[13:26] that's said and done
[13:28] lord in our midst today we love you in
[13:30] jesus name
[13:31] amen amen you may be seated
[13:37] so a little title
[13:41] it's a strange title what here is thou
[13:44] sayest the amen to the amen what
[13:48] herestyle says the amen
[13:50] to the amen and a part of this is
[13:53] coming from a personal experience for me
[13:55] myself
[13:56] i'm i'm a man of no reputation so i
[13:59] never make
[13:59] myself as a reputation of being someone
[14:01] that gets it right all the time i don't
[14:03] i'm a far cry from somebody that gets it
[14:04] right all the time but i do see the hand
[14:06] of god and the grace of god in my life
[14:07] to correct me
[14:08] and that gives me a comfort because this
[14:10] rod and staff are a comfort to us and
[14:12] there's not one of us here that hasn't
[14:14] experienced the difficulties i think of
[14:15] this
[14:16] mask thing right and the difficulties of
[14:18] the whole cove thing and the whole thing
[14:19] that's like hey why are we becoming
[14:21] subjected to things that
[14:22] we don't need to come subjected to other
[14:24] than it's the word of god
[14:27] and when we hear those things it's
[14:28] something that i found that's a war
[14:29] inside of me constantly
[14:31] and i realized that i'm constantly
[14:33] wanting to buck
[14:35] status quo trends for my own self
[14:39] and i'm realizing that my greatest enemy
[14:41] is still me
[14:42] it's still me no matter how much i know
[14:44] and how much god has done for me if i
[14:46] won't submit myself to the littlest of
[14:48] his commands i have usurped my will over
[14:51] his
[14:52] and that's a very dangerous place for
[14:53] any of us all to be
[14:55] is to ever put our will above his will
[14:58] because the amen the bride doesn't do
[15:00] that
[15:01] and we i want to go into looking at that
[15:03] and the character and the aspects of the
[15:05] son and daughters of god and the hour in
[15:07] which we're living
[15:08] is we submit ourselves to every word of
[15:09] god as little as
[15:11] it may be and many times we'll accept
[15:14] the great big things but then we'll
[15:15] stumble at the little things
[15:17] and we wonder why what is wrong it's
[15:20] because you're not
[15:21] hearkening into his voice you're wanting
[15:23] something big you're wanting the fire
[15:25] you're wanting
[15:26] the earthquake you're wanting god to do
[15:27] something great big and he speaks to you
[15:29] as a still small voice
[15:30] of his word and that word never
[15:34] changes it's immovable and if you want
[15:37] god
[15:38] you accept his word so simple so humble
[15:42] it goes over the highest most
[15:44] intellectual minds in this word
[15:46] world if you want him take him at his
[15:49] word
[15:51] but we have this carnal nature about us
[15:54] that's constantly trying to view
[15:56] god as something great big glorious
[16:00] mighty powerful which he is but that
[16:03] great god has so veiled himself
[16:05] in the simplicity of his word that it
[16:08] constantly stumbles the carnal mind
[16:11] and what stumbles me what lord brought
[16:13] my attention to is
[16:14] you know when that came out i said
[16:16] something and i was wrong
[16:18] i told the other deacons i do not want
[16:20] to wear a mask
[16:21] i've been unveiled before my god why
[16:23] should i put a mask back on
[16:25] why i didn't want to do it but there was
[16:28] a little voice in my head
[16:30] that said but his word says
[16:33] and then i went to prayer i never said
[16:34] anything but i went to prayer and right
[16:36] there i was praying
[16:37] prayed for about an hour and i was like
[16:38] lord i don't know how to
[16:40] and and something came to me and said
[16:42] it's the humbling of the bride
[16:45] now you take that for what it is man i'm
[16:47] not going to say it was thus saith the
[16:48] lord i'm not going to say anything like
[16:50] that but for me maybe it was the
[16:52] humbling of kyle
[16:53] maybe it wasn't for everybody for the
[16:55] humbling of kyle because
[16:57] we had to observe him he was meek and
[16:59] lowly coming in on the fold of an ass
[17:02] and if you want to be like him you're
[17:03] going to walk in his footsteps
[17:05] and you're not going to take a different
[17:07] path that he took to get there
[17:09] right and when you know i go back in the
[17:12] bible and i look you know and we see
[17:14] john or revelations 5 you know and i
[17:16] preached on behold the lamb you know and
[17:17] as we look at that behold the lamb
[17:19] as i start to look at him more and more
[17:21] he hears a voice the lion of the tribe
[17:22] of judah hath prevailed
[17:24] and everyone no doubt john's looking as
[17:26] the type of the bride saying here he
[17:27] comes
[17:29] the mighty god the sword in his hand to
[17:32] correct the
[17:33] the situation and he turns and sees the
[17:35] most powerful thing that could have ever
[17:37] been expressed a bloody lamb
[17:40] that's a shocking situation how could
[17:42] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[17:44] the great and mightiest one
[17:46] amongst us in the whole universe take
[17:48] the form of a little
[17:50] humble man no beauty that we should be
[17:52] holding
[17:53] and let them rip his beard out let them
[17:56] spit him in
[17:56] spit at him in the face rip off his
[17:59] clothes and humiliate him before
[18:01] all flesh and he didn't do
[18:04] anything he said nothing
[18:08] he let them do it
[18:11] that to me is just so shocking
[18:15] and so humbling and i'm so ashamed
[18:18] of my attitude in the presence of of
[18:21] that
[18:22] you know it's something i'm realizing
[18:24] you know it's one thing to know him
[18:27] and it's another thing to know him you
[18:29] know about him
[18:30] but to know him i think is to walk in
[18:32] his footsteps
[18:34] that brings a whole new reality of
[18:36] knowing him right
[18:37] you can before two people are married
[18:38] you can tell them about marriage and all
[18:40] that goes with they say beware you know
[18:41] hey
[18:42] say whatever you want sweetie you know
[18:44] those little things right there
[18:45] right this little thing to kind of but
[18:46] once they become married
[18:48] then they have to go through those
[18:49] difficulties of working things out in
[18:51] situations and humbling themselves and
[18:53] saying they're sorry and realizing they
[18:55] were wrong right they're knowing on a
[18:56] completely different level because now
[18:58] they're experiencing those things that
[19:00] they were told
[19:00] and now they have to put them into
[19:02] action to actually see the fruit
[19:05] of what they've been told right and so
[19:07] as i i just
[19:08] sitting there you know and i knew god
[19:10] did that and i had to i had to go and i
[19:12] had to go pray about it and i
[19:13] and i just when i did and i was looking
[19:15] at the scriptures and i just come back
[19:17] and the simplicity of it is god is such
[19:19] a gentleman
[19:20] he's so gentle and he is so meek
[19:24] that he will not force his will upon you
[19:27] he's so
[19:28] gentle it's shocking remember it even
[19:31] stumbled john the baptist
[19:33] he was so gentle are you the one like
[19:36] the high places made low oh yeah they
[19:37] were
[19:38] but it wasn't in the caramel realm that
[19:39] you could see but it was spiritually
[19:41] taking place
[19:42] strongholds were breaking and
[19:46] so in in looking at that i i just i just
[19:50] came back to the realization no matter
[19:52] how much i don't want to do this
[19:55] his will must take preeminence over my
[19:57] will
[19:58] because his will is his word
[20:02] period like amen
[20:06] amen you want to know the will of god
[20:09] it's his word it will never deviate from
[20:13] that
[20:13] you will never get so high in your
[20:15] revelation that you will ever
[20:17] discount and diminish one of his least
[20:20] commands
[20:22] true revelation will put you in humble
[20:24] obedience to every word that god has
[20:26] asked you to walk in
[20:27] that's a great revelation if you can
[20:29] break for me the whole seven seals and
[20:31] you can't walk in the simplicity of
[20:32] god's word i'm wondering
[20:34] i'm wondering because we have a pattern
[20:37] of this and the scripture is very clear
[20:38] of these things that god
[20:39] never deviates from his word because he
[20:41] is the word
[20:43] period and so many times like
[20:46] you'd say i had an experience you know
[20:48] so i like back there in the back i'm
[20:49] thinking i'm like well lord
[20:50] i really don't want to preach like i
[20:52] really don't want to do this
[20:54] hey like don't you don't understand i
[20:56] don't understand how a person really
[20:57] wants to preach like i still don't
[20:58] understand that
[20:59] like i don't get it like you see men and
[21:01] they just want to get up there and talk
[21:03] and i'm like i don't want to say
[21:04] nothing like i want to go hide and i i
[21:07] still wrestle with that
[21:08] but like in and of myself i'm like but i
[21:10] know you spoke to me
[21:11] and i know i'm supposed to minister to
[21:13] your people i know you called me to
[21:14] minister to be a servant to your bride i
[21:16] know you did
[21:17] and i checked my experience in my
[21:18] revelation with your word and it matched
[21:20] the word
[21:21] because if i had a revelation of
[21:22] something that the word said no i would
[21:24] have to bow down to
[21:25] that and say your word is true and my
[21:28] revelation
[21:29] is a lie my thought my experience even
[21:32] if an angel from heaven come and tell
[21:33] you something other than what i'm
[21:35] telling you right now
[21:36] let him be accursed it does not matter
[21:39] god
[21:39] never moves from his word because he is
[21:42] the word
[21:44] and i think in humbling ourselves
[21:47] jesus learned obedience through the
[21:50] things that he suffered what
[21:51] obedience did he come to the word
[21:55] prophet of god said that church is what
[21:57] obedience did he learn
[21:59] to learn to not pursue his will but the
[22:01] will of the father
[22:03] he had a job to do he had a role to play
[22:05] just as you do and so do i
[22:07] we have a job to do we're here to be the
[22:09] word made manifest
[22:10] we're here to reflect his will which is
[22:13] his word
[22:14] completely and utterly so simple so
[22:17] humble
[22:19] that i wonder if people accept it
[22:22] like i wonder because we always want
[22:24] something great big
[22:25] something great beyond something that's
[22:27] mighty and powerful and we don't want to
[22:29] humble ourselves to the
[22:30] simplicity of him and his word
[22:34] and influence is brother branham and i
[22:36] have a lot i i was like i don't know
[22:38] what to preach i looked down i got 15
[22:39] pages i'm like what in the world is this
[22:41] like i don't understand this so
[22:45] influence brother branham says here
[22:48] always be conscious of your littleness
[22:49] not your bigness
[22:51] today we as americans we so much want to
[22:53] think of ourselves as a big somebody
[22:56] we belong to something great big or some
[22:58] big organization or something
[23:00] something big that we got oh but great
[23:02] big
[23:03] bit big is all that we ever want to see
[23:06] and that one time in the bible
[23:08] we we have seen an example of that there
[23:10] was a prophet
[23:11] went back into a cave elijah and god was
[23:14] trying to attract his attention
[23:16] to come out and there came a fire a
[23:19] smoke and a blustery winds across the
[23:22] mountains and a thunder and an
[23:23] earthquake and
[23:24] shakings and everything else the prophet
[23:27] never
[23:27] even moved god wasn't
[23:31] even in it but when he heard that still
[23:35] small voice speak he covered his face
[23:38] and he came forward when the still small
[23:41] voice of god's word speaks
[23:43] not in a racket not in some great big
[23:45] denomination or something big
[23:47] something but that still small voice of
[23:50] his word
[23:51] that's looked over and that call that
[23:55] still calls man to repentance
[23:57] god is his word
[24:01] always his word and so we see
[24:04] what attracted this for ordained
[24:06] predestinated prophet of god
[24:09] that could call fire out of the heavens
[24:13] nothing but the word nothing was an
[24:16] attraction to him
[24:18] and that's why i think we're doing this
[24:19] we're maturing in the lord
[24:21] i really do believe that i believe as he
[24:23] walked in those footsteps and learned
[24:25] obedience too much suffering
[24:27] and what do you suffer anytime you try
[24:29] to pursue your will over god's will
[24:30] you're going to pay a price
[24:32] his rod and his staff will come and
[24:33] correct and his rod and staff is a
[24:35] comfort to us
[24:36] as his children we love it we don't
[24:39] despise it
[24:41] we want it it hurts but we want it
[24:44] but he learned that obedience through
[24:47] much suffering and so is the bride
[24:49] learning to just obey his voice
[24:52] which is his word and sometimes i know
[24:54] we want to make it something big
[24:56] but my prayer is that each and every one
[24:59] of us
[24:59] because i'm included in this you go down
[25:01] in your own life today
[25:02] and you find out where's that one little
[25:05] thing he just keeps whispering to me
[25:07] and he won't let me i just i'm trying to
[25:10] cover it over with something else i'm
[25:12] trying to cover it over with
[25:13] praying or coming to church or trying to
[25:14] do things and there's that little little
[25:16] check down in the side of me
[25:18] and he keeps saying why are you
[25:19] bypassing me why are you trying to get
[25:22] to me
[25:22] because i'm right there in that little
[25:24] word that you keep bypassing
[25:25] that little humble request that i have
[25:27] for you because god is in that word
[25:30] you know enoch was a perfect reflection
[25:32] of that word he became the living
[25:34] word to his hour because he perfectly
[25:37] reflected the word that he was
[25:39] that was revealed to him in every step
[25:41] of his journey
[25:43] in every manner of his life as
[25:47] each of us would do in our own way we
[25:48] would have the simplicity of you say
[25:50] well god really doesn't care how i act
[25:51] at work
[25:52] oh yes he does you don't talk to men i
[25:55] don't care how mean they are to you
[25:57] don't talk back to them mean
[25:59] that's his word you love those that
[26:00] despitefully use you and you persecute
[26:02] and persecute you right
[26:04] that's the simplicity of his word but
[26:05] why do we want to bypass that and we say
[26:07] hey yeah but i have a revelation the
[26:08] seventh seal i know the prophet of god
[26:09] to the age and i'm his bride
[26:11] what did he want a bride for he don't
[26:14] want a bride just so you can
[26:15] he can say i have a bride he wants a
[26:17] bride to reproduce himself
[26:19] to bring the word and made flesh amongst
[26:21] us today in the hour in which we're
[26:22] living the bride has a purpose to
[26:24] reproduce christ christ is the word
[26:27] from genesis to revelations he's the
[26:30] amen
[26:31] the soviet let it be done and the bride
[26:34] says the same thing
[26:35] so be it let it be done not my will
[26:38] but thine will be done see we're still
[26:40] learning we're walking in those
[26:42] footsteps
[26:42] and i'm not i'm not pushing anybody out
[26:45] i'm not pushing anybody in that's not
[26:46] what i'm doing
[26:47] we want to find our bad spots right so i
[26:50] expose my bad spots but i don't think
[26:51] i'm the only one
[26:53] i think we're all maturing in these
[26:54] things and realizing you know what
[26:57] hey i am still my greatest enemy
[27:00] and i am hindering the move of god if i
[27:02] won't humble myself to the least of his
[27:04] desires
[27:06] that's just the truth god hiding himself
[27:10] in simplicity when elijah was back there
[27:11] in the cave and the smoke went across
[27:13] the blood the thunders the lightnings
[27:15] you see and all those kinds of
[27:16] sensations
[27:17] we've had blood on the face and hands
[27:19] and sensations and everything
[27:20] they it never even bothered that prophet
[27:23] he just laid there and he heard that
[27:25] still small voice and what
[27:26] is it the word then he covered his face
[27:29] and he walked out to see what it was
[27:31] remember friends
[27:32] don't look for something big you say god
[27:36] he speaks of great big things there'll
[27:38] come a time
[27:39] that this will be this and this will be
[27:41] that and it'll be great big things
[27:43] i hope you're catching what i'm talking
[27:45] about see great big things
[27:48] when this comes to pass it'll be great
[27:50] big like this
[27:51] but it'll be so humble that you'll miss
[27:54] the entire theme
[27:55] it'll go right on it's god hiding
[27:57] himself in simplicity
[27:59] you'll look back there and say well that
[28:01] never did that
[28:02] see it see it passed right over the top
[28:04] of you and you've never
[28:05] even seen it it was so simple you see
[28:08] god
[28:09] lived in that simplicity to manifest
[28:11] himself
[28:12] in his greatness what makes him great
[28:15] because he can simplify
[28:17] himself a great a big great man
[28:20] can't simplify himself he's got to be
[28:24] a dignitary see but he ain't big enough
[28:28] yet
[28:28] when he become when he comes big enough
[28:32] then he comes down like you you see he
[28:35] can humble himself
[28:37] wow
[28:42] i got a lot so it's okay right we're
[28:44] just gonna fly through this and we'll
[28:45] see where he wants to go with it
[28:49] he says like that it means whatever oh
[28:51] okay so here it is
[28:52] he is the god of the amen this is a
[28:55] continuation
[28:56] of um that he never changes
[28:59] what he does never changes he said it
[29:02] and he stands fast he does it
[29:04] and it's done forever none can take from
[29:07] what he says
[29:07] or add to it so let it be amen
[29:11] so let it be you aren't you glad that
[29:14] you served that kind of a god
[29:16] you can know exactly what listen this
[29:18] you can know
[29:19] exactly where you are with him
[29:23] at any time and all the time
[29:26] because he is the amen god
[29:29] and he won't change you want to check
[29:33] your experience you want to do a checkup
[29:35] just check your life with the simplicity
[29:37] of his word and you'll find where you're
[29:39] standing in his presence
[29:41] it's that simple you don't need a pastor
[29:43] you don't need a preacher you don't need
[29:44] an
[29:44] angel you don't need a mighty rushing
[29:46] wind you check your experience with his
[29:48] word
[29:49] brother branham said that and you'll
[29:51] find where you're standing in his
[29:53] presence
[29:55] so simple so simple
[29:58] now i know why i had no inspiration like
[30:00] i couldn't feel
[30:01] anything other than so simple just a
[30:04] whisper of his word
[30:06] i myself was still looking for something
[30:08] big but he gave me his word
[30:11] he whispered it to me he just whispered
[30:14] it
[30:16] i like that brother man says i like that
[30:18] it means that whatever he said
[30:20] it's final it means that whatever he
[30:23] said in the first
[30:24] age and to the second and to all the
[30:25] other age about his own church and about
[30:28] the false vine is exactly right and it
[30:31] won't change
[30:32] it means that what he started out with
[30:34] in genesis he will finish in revelations
[30:37] he has to be for he is the amen
[30:41] let it be now we can see again why the
[30:44] devil hates the book of revelations
[30:46] and genesis he hates the truth he knows
[30:48] that the truth will prevail
[30:50] he knows what his end will be and how he
[30:53] fights that but we are on the winning
[30:55] side
[30:58] i'm going to keep going because it'll
[30:59] get good a quick look at those
[31:02] scriptures which involves the lord jesus
[31:04] overcoming to bring the truth of this
[31:06] proposition
[31:07] matthew 4. he overcame the personal
[31:10] temptations of satan
[31:11] by the word personal temptations
[31:14] and by the word only in each of the
[31:17] three major trials
[31:18] that corresponded exactly to the
[31:20] temptations of the garden of eden the
[31:22] lust of the flesh
[31:23] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[31:25] life jesus overcame
[31:27] by the word and he fell to the personal
[31:30] temptation of satan by
[31:32] falling to you to failing to use the
[31:34] word
[31:35] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[31:37] word but jesus overcame
[31:39] by the word and right now let me say
[31:42] this
[31:43] the only way to be an overcomer
[31:46] is to it also is the only way that you
[31:49] can know
[31:50] that you're actually overcoming because
[31:53] the word
[31:54] can't fail see
[31:57] you want something outside of the word
[32:00] and it's proving
[32:02] ah that's what a false vine is looking
[32:04] for false vine is constantly looking for
[32:06] something out of his word for
[32:07] vindication of what he is and that he's
[32:09] in the will of god
[32:11] i can show that to you and i will here
[32:12] in a minute
[32:14] now notice how jesus overcame the world
[32:16] systems of religion when he was
[32:17] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[32:19] of his day he constantly
[32:21] applied the word he spoke only what the
[32:24] father gave him to speak
[32:26] there was not a time when the world was
[32:29] was not utterly confused by his wisdom
[32:32] for his wisdom
[32:33] was of god but in his own personal life
[32:36] when he was
[32:37] contending with himself he
[32:40] overcame by obedience to the word
[32:43] of god hebrews 5 7 who in the days of
[32:47] his flesh when he was offered up prayers
[32:49] and supplications with strong crying and
[32:50] tears unto him
[32:51] that was able to save him from death and
[32:54] was heard and that he feared
[32:56] though he were a son
[32:59] not taking away your sonship though he
[33:01] were a son
[33:02] yet learned he obedience by the things
[33:06] which he
[33:06] suffered and being made perfect he
[33:09] became the author of eternal salvation
[33:12] unto all them that obey him
[33:16] what was he obedient to the word of
[33:20] god now then there
[33:24] will not be one person who will sit
[33:27] in the throne of the lord jesus christ
[33:30] unless
[33:30] he has been living that word
[33:35] there's the qualification unless you've
[33:38] been living that word i don't care if
[33:40] you can quote it to me
[33:41] unless you've been the expression of
[33:43] that living word you will not sit on
[33:45] that throne with him
[33:46] because you will constantly be found as
[33:48] one pursuing your own will
[33:50] your own desires above the will and
[33:52] purpose of god
[33:54] very simple you will by your own default
[33:57] eliminate yourself from that position
[34:00] you will do it yourself
[34:02] you'll count yourself unworthy because
[34:04] you'll pursue your own desire
[34:06] see you see how god's just so
[34:09] so quiet he's just whispering his
[34:12] desires to you
[34:13] and then he's checking to see what
[34:14] she'll do he's not going to have a wife
[34:17] that he has to force into loving him
[34:19] it just won't do that jesus said if you
[34:22] say that you love me and you don't keep
[34:24] my commandments
[34:25] you're a liar like i don't have to say
[34:29] it he
[34:29] said it his word is his will and if you
[34:32] don't love him you don't love his word
[34:34] you'll pursue your own will
[34:36] so simple
[34:40] no person will sit a person who will sit
[34:42] upon the throne of the lord jesus christ
[34:44] unless he's been living that word
[34:45] your prayers your fastings your
[34:48] repentances
[34:49] no matter what you present to god none
[34:52] of that will gain you the privilege of
[34:54] sitting
[34:54] on that throne it will only be granted
[34:57] to a
[34:58] word right just a word bride
[35:02] see why you have to humble yourself
[35:04] become like a little child
[35:05] just real simple lord i don't know
[35:07] nothing you show me where i'm not
[35:09] obeying i'm not expressing that word
[35:11] i want to walk in it as a wife i want to
[35:14] be found as the wife that
[35:15] god would want me to be found right as a
[35:17] husband i want to be that kind of an
[35:19] expression that you were to me
[35:21] to to to really be that living word for
[35:23] you right
[35:24] that's just that desire don't be getting
[35:26] tired on me i see a couple of you
[35:28] see a couple of you you're all right
[35:31] you can take a breath believe me i it's
[35:33] okay just breathe a little bit
[35:34] see a couple i'm going like this it's
[35:36] okay
[35:38] it does mess me up but it's okay right
[35:41] just relax so i'm gonna have to get a
[35:45] little oxygen tubes you know underneath
[35:46] the seats you know and
[35:48] pump them in there bright-eyed bushy
[35:49] tail
[35:55] he says as the throne of the king is
[35:56] shared with the queen because she is
[35:58] united with him so
[35:59] only they who are of that word
[36:02] even as he is of that word will share
[36:05] that throne
[36:06] his word only are on the amen side
[36:10] see why i'm saying it's the amen to the
[36:12] amen
[36:13] we have nothing we're not saying hey but
[36:15] i know this this this this this this
[36:18] no don't care are you obedient to what
[36:21] he's asked you to do
[36:23] i really don't care about anything else
[36:25] anymore i really don't like
[36:27] i'm not looking for anything great and
[36:29] big i know it's hidden in the simplicity
[36:31] of humble moms dads kids
[36:34] older grandmas and grandpas just
[36:36] faithfully doing what he's called us to
[36:37] do in the hour in which we're living
[36:39] the word expression
[36:42] it says here that we are earth that he
[36:44] hid this treasure in earth and vessels
[36:46] that the excellency of the power of god
[36:48] that the power may be of god and not of
[36:51] us
[36:51] for we are troubled on every side we are
[36:53] distressed we're perplexed but we are
[36:55] not in despair we are persecuted but
[36:57] we're not forsaken or cast down
[36:59] and but not destroyed always bearing
[37:01] about
[37:02] in the body the dying of the lord jesus
[37:05] that the life
[37:06] also of jesus may be made manifested in
[37:08] our body
[37:10] for we which are alive always delivered
[37:12] unto death
[37:13] for jesus's sake that the life also of
[37:16] jesus
[37:17] might be made manifested in our mortal
[37:19] flesh
[37:20] we're always dying out to your will
[37:22] you're always
[37:23] dying out and you know what next week
[37:25] you'll be dying out again to something
[37:27] else and then the month after that
[37:28] you're going to find out there's
[37:29] something else i'm dying because you're
[37:31] always dying
[37:33] that's you're walking in his footsteps
[37:36] yeah there's a lot wow a lot of
[37:38] scriptures here in my mind so
[37:40] romans i will just keep flying because
[37:42] i'm not even close
[37:43] romans 8 who shall separate us from the
[37:46] love of christ shall tribulation
[37:47] distress persecutions famines
[37:49] or nakedness or peril or sword as it is
[37:52] written
[37:53] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[37:55] long
[37:56] we are counted as sheep for the
[37:58] slaughter
[38:00] every day every hour of every day
[38:03] i'm dying you want to walk in his
[38:05] footsteps remember
[38:06] it's a bloody lamb you want to take the
[38:09] book remember it's a bloody lamb takes
[38:11] the book
[38:12] only the bloody lamb takes the book to
[38:13] make it live you could quote it
[38:15] but you can't make it live you
[38:18] understand
[38:19] yeah now i'm kind of wondering and
[38:22] knowing why i
[38:23] by by inspiration i preached that behold
[38:25] the lamb i see
[38:27] i see for one for me i i i took on the
[38:30] wrong nature for a second and i tried to
[38:32] pursue my will
[38:33] and i didn't realize that's antichrist
[38:37] antichrist is anything other than his
[38:39] word that's the spirit of antichrist
[38:42] don't think it can't work on you
[38:44] anything that causes you to deviate from
[38:46] the least of his commands
[38:47] is an antichrist spirit working upon you
[38:50] remember till that devil is cast in the
[38:53] lake of fire he's doing
[38:54] everything he can to keep you from
[38:56] walking in that word
[38:58] everything he can
[39:05] okay my computer went dark it had to
[39:08] look at me
[39:11] so now here's the
[39:15] here's we're getting to the the meat of
[39:17] what i this inspiration
[39:20] lee not your own understanding now i
[39:21] think our education
[39:23] is good today if we said to our sons and
[39:26] to our
[39:26] and to the sons of god that it's all
[39:28] right to have an education there's
[39:30] nothing against that
[39:31] but when your education is contrary to
[39:33] the word of god then you lean to the
[39:35] word and you let your education go
[39:37] see because the word the education will
[39:39] stand and
[39:41] and will give you a good job and
[39:43] probably a good standing amongst very
[39:44] intellectual people
[39:46] but that's and that's all right which
[39:48] will probably be a great help to you
[39:50] help you in your financials and help you
[39:52] in your livelihood
[39:53] make living a little bit easier for you
[39:56] but
[39:56] remember one thing my son you've got to
[39:59] die no matter how much education you got
[40:03] how much culture and how much you are
[40:05] able to accumulate
[40:06] you've got to face death because it is
[40:09] written
[40:09] men must die and after this the judgment
[40:12] and god and death is so bad
[40:14] but coming to that judgment that's the
[40:16] bad part
[40:17] but now you die but after that the
[40:19] judgment
[40:20] now it's going to be required of you
[40:24] what you did with your understanding of
[40:27] god's word
[40:28] that's where the requirement comes
[40:30] because that your education is fine
[40:33] but the word of god is the life my word
[40:37] is life and and to know it
[40:40] is the life and he said to know him well
[40:43] he is the word
[40:45] so you can only know him by the word
[40:48] for he is the word that's the only way
[40:51] you'll ever
[40:52] know him is by his word
[40:55] so simple it's got to stay simple
[40:58] because only someone big can make
[40:59] themselves simple
[41:04] so brother bam says here
[41:07] this headstone was crying grace grace
[41:10] it's
[41:10] passed from death and from creed into
[41:12] the living word of a living god
[41:15] god's only provided plan for this age
[41:17] was his sons
[41:18] in the word word age will be quickened
[41:21] by the spirit
[41:22] like a spark that's lit off of something
[41:24] that's been alive
[41:25] and it's seated now in heavenly places
[41:28] already alive
[41:29] and subject to every promise in the word
[41:32] and what does that do
[41:33] you being a part of god's gene a part of
[41:36] the word
[41:36] other men a part of god's word are
[41:39] seated together and they're manifesting
[41:41] the entire body of christ
[41:43] because there's no leaven among you you
[41:46] see
[41:46] there's no leaven among you it's just
[41:49] the word
[41:49] only seated in those heavenly places
[41:53] in the door where he has put his name
[41:57] where two ways meet the cross yours and
[41:59] his yeah
[42:01] still an open door now here it is
[42:04] this is the one i wanted to get to
[42:08] resume of the ages balaam
[42:11] we learn in those uncertain terms that
[42:14] this false vine is a vine of
[42:16] satan their gathering is of him satan
[42:19] they meet in the name of the of god and
[42:22] they lie
[42:23] that they are christ's they preach
[42:26] they teach they baptize they worship
[42:29] they partake
[42:30] of various rites that are given in the
[42:32] church by christ
[42:34] yet they are not of god but since they
[42:36] say that they are
[42:37] god will hold them responsible and in
[42:39] each age he speaks to them
[42:43] they remind us exactly of balaam he had
[42:46] a prophetic office
[42:48] he knew the proper approach unto god as
[42:51] demonstrated in the sacrifices of clean
[42:53] beasts
[42:54] yet he was not a word prophet for when
[42:57] god told him
[42:58] not to go to honor balak with his
[43:01] presence
[43:02] he sought to go anyway for he was
[43:05] motivated by lust
[43:07] of gold and prestige so
[43:10] god let him go the perfect will of god
[43:13] gave way to the permissive will of god
[43:16] because
[43:17] of the heart's desire
[43:20] of balaam god actually said go ahead
[43:24] did god change his mind no sir
[43:27] god had his way regardless of what
[43:29] balaam was going
[43:30] balaam did not annul the will of god god
[43:34] had his way
[43:35] regardless it was balaam who was
[43:38] the loser for he bypassed the word
[43:42] his own human desire his heart desire
[43:45] bypassing the word
[43:46] he made himself a loser and today we
[43:49] have the very same thing women preachers
[43:52] organizations
[43:53] false doctrines and etc and people
[43:55] worshiping god
[43:56] manifesting in the spirit and going
[43:58] right on as did balaam
[44:00] claiming that god had spoken to them
[44:03] them even when the commission received
[44:05] was opposite to the revealed word
[44:08] and will not defy that
[44:11] god spoke to them or and i will not deny
[44:14] that god spoke to them
[44:16] but it was just like when he spoke to
[44:18] balaam the second time
[44:20] and he knew that balaam wanted his own
[44:23] heart's desire
[44:24] above the word and he gave it to him
[44:28] and yet all the while in the end having
[44:31] his own way
[44:33] even so today god tells folks
[44:36] just go ahead in your own hearts desires
[44:39] because they've already rejected the
[44:41] word
[44:42] but the will of god will be done
[44:44] regardless amen
[44:45] i hope you see this it will it will not
[44:48] only clear up much of what we've seen in
[44:50] the ages
[44:51] but especially in this last age with so
[44:54] much
[44:55] manifestation and external blessings
[44:58] when the whole period
[44:59] is against the word revealed will
[45:03] of god
[45:07] so you see god will let you go right on
[45:09] and he'll keep blessing you
[45:11] he'll keep blessing you those children
[45:14] of israel that came out
[45:16] he still fed him manna from heaven he
[45:18] still
[45:19] let their shoelaces not break he gave
[45:21] him water when they were thirsty he took
[45:23] care of them
[45:24] he calls it the rain to fall on the just
[45:26] in the un just right
[45:28] he pours out he does blessings for all
[45:30] but you know what it does it just
[45:31] reveals
[45:32] the one that loves him and the one that
[45:34] don't
[45:36] the one that don't it's just a revealer
[45:40] these little things all along the way
[45:42] that god keeps letting come
[45:44] our way is going to be the revealer of
[45:46] the heart's desire of
[45:47] each of us i don't think we're done
[45:50] i don't think we're close i think we are
[45:54] all having to learn obedience
[45:56] through suffering and i'm not saying it
[45:58] ain't suffering i know you're all
[45:59] suffering behind that right now
[46:01] i know you are and i know that there's
[46:04] many many things that we have to suffer
[46:06] but for his sake we'll do it
[46:10] because if god is going to do anything
[46:12] he's going to check your heart's desire
[46:14] he'll do it with everything you can
[46:16] imagine i
[46:17] this is one little thing you know that
[46:19] right there's so many things he's
[46:21] checking your heart's desire
[46:23] you think he's not mindful of you every
[46:25] day watching
[46:26] where is his heart's desire you know
[46:28] brother branham says when god chooses a
[46:30] bride he's speaking of what kind of home
[46:32] he wants
[46:33] right when he picks a woman right so do
[46:35] you think god's going to pick a bride
[46:37] that constantly just wants to do her own
[46:39] thing
[46:41] like always wants to just do her thing
[46:44] and god i want you to bless me in it and
[46:47] you know what he'll do
[46:48] he'll bless you he will bless you and
[46:51] you'll think you're fine
[46:53] and all you did was expose you don't
[46:55] have the heart and desire of god
[46:57] you did it he blessed you
[47:00] that's scary that scares me that scares
[47:03] me
[47:03] that scares me for the people it really
[47:05] does to know that the almighty god will
[47:08] still bless you
[47:09] and give you the desires of your heart
[47:11] but it won't be his desire
[47:13] and you will completely reject him along
[47:16] the path
[47:16] and you thought you were fine the people
[47:19] the world the denominational systems
[47:20] they're blessed
[47:21] they're healed they get all kinds of it
[47:22] and they think god's with them in that
[47:25] just like balaam they rejected the word
[47:27] god still blesses them
[47:29] but they rejected him the word god's
[47:32] checking to find
[47:33] his bride that wants his will and his
[47:36] will only
[47:37] which is his word nothing more than that
[47:40] so simple you see real real real simple
[47:46] hebrews 3 7 if you want to turn there
[48:01] just realized we are where that thought
[48:03] i just said was
[48:04] so hebrews 3 7 wherefore as the holy
[48:08] ghost saith today if you will hear his
[48:10] voice harden not your hearts as in the
[48:12] provocation
[48:13] of the day of temptation in the
[48:14] wilderness so this day of temptation in
[48:17] the wilderness what do you think god was
[48:18] doing in this period of time
[48:21] it was a great temptation he was
[48:22] checking their desires
[48:24] they were in a wilderness why didn't
[48:25] they just come out and go in
[48:29] he gave space to check their desires he
[48:32] had few
[48:33] very few very tiny few that actually had
[48:36] a heart's desire for the will of god to
[48:38] be fulfilled
[48:39] the rest he's still blessed
[48:42] gave him their hearts desires
[48:45] why do you think we didn't take a body
[48:47] change 50 years ago
[48:48] he's checking hart's desires
[48:52] he's learning obedience we're all
[48:54] learning obedience
[48:55] much suffering
[49:01] when your fathers tempted me and proved
[49:03] me and saw my works 40 years
[49:05] wherefore i was grieved with that
[49:06] generation i said they do
[49:08] always err in their heart and they have
[49:11] not
[49:12] for they have not known my ways so i
[49:15] swear in my wrath they shall not enter
[49:17] into my rest
[49:18] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[49:21] of you
[49:22] an evil heart of unbelief in the
[49:25] departing from the living god
[49:27] but exhort one another daily while it is
[49:30] called today
[49:31] lest any of you be hardened through the
[49:33] deceitfulness of sin
[49:35] for we are made partakers of christ if
[49:38] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[49:40] steadfast unto the
[49:41] end while it is said today if you will
[49:45] hear his voice
[49:46] harden not your hearts as in the
[49:48] provocation
[49:50] for some when they had heard did provoke
[49:53] how be it not all that came out of egypt
[49:56] by
[49:56] moses but with whom he was grieved for
[49:59] forty years
[50:00] was it not with them that had sinned
[50:03] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[50:05] to whom swear he
[50:07] that they should not enter into his rest
[50:11] but to them that believe not so we see
[50:14] that they could not enter in because of
[50:17] unbelief let us therefore fear
[50:21] lest a promise being left us of entering
[50:25] into his rest any of you should seem to
[50:28] come
[50:28] short of for unto us was the gospel
[50:32] preached
[50:32] as well as unto them but the word
[50:35] preached
[50:36] did not profit them not being mixed with
[50:40] faith in them that heard it simply they
[50:43] heard the word
[50:44] they recognized their prophet but they
[50:46] didn't humble themselves to just take
[50:48] him at his word
[50:49] and obey it along the way brother bannon
[50:52] said you can agree with the word
[50:54] you can say it's the truth but until you
[50:56] unite with it
[50:58] it doesn't do any good whatsoever
[51:02] see there's a difference between
[51:03] sympathizing there's a difference
[51:04] between flirters
[51:06] and a wife there's a big difference
[51:10] you'll find it in their heart's desire
[51:14] always hidden in simple things first
[51:17] peter 2 7.
[51:19] please turn
[51:33] first peter 2 7. unto you therefore
[51:36] which believed he is precious
[51:38] but unto them which be disobedient the
[51:41] stone which the builders disallowed the
[51:43] same as made the head of the corner
[51:45] and a stone of stumbling in a rock of
[51:47] offense even to them which stumble
[51:50] at the word being disobedient whereunto
[51:52] also
[51:53] they were appointed but ye are a chosen
[51:56] generation
[51:57] a royal priesthood and a holy nation a
[51:59] peculiar people
[52:01] that we should show forth the praises of
[52:02] him who have called you
[52:04] out of this darkness unto his marvelous
[52:07] light
[52:08] which in times past were not a people
[52:10] but are now the people of god
[52:12] which had not obtained mercy but now
[52:14] have obtained mercy
[52:16] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[52:18] strangers and pilgrims
[52:20] abstain from fleshly lusts which war
[52:23] against your soul
[52:24] we're all warring against them we all
[52:27] have these
[52:28] human desires and reasonings that we
[52:30] would like to bypass the simplicity of
[52:32] his will
[52:33] and try to pursue our own and it's
[52:37] it's just hidden in so many things
[52:40] now let's look at the amen bride
[52:44] revelations uh of jesus christ the
[52:48] church age
[52:48] now remember this christ in the true
[52:51] church is the continuation of the book
[52:52] of acts
[52:53] but the book of revelation shows that
[52:55] how the antichrist spirit
[52:57] would come into the church and defile it
[53:00] making it lukewarm
[53:01] formal and powerless it is exposing
[53:04] satan revealing his words and his
[53:06] attempted destruction of god's people
[53:08] how by discrediting god's word
[53:12] right down to the time that he is cast
[53:14] into the lake of fire
[53:15] he fights that he cannot stand it
[53:18] he knows that if the people get a true
[53:20] revelation of the true church
[53:22] and what she is and what she stands for
[53:24] and that she can do the greater works
[53:26] she will be an invincible army if they
[53:29] get a true revelation
[53:30] of the two spirits within the framework
[53:32] of the christian church
[53:34] and by god's grace our spirit discern
[53:36] and withstand
[53:37] the antichrist spirit so does the bride
[53:41] have to withstand the antichrist spirit
[53:43] so what is the antichrist spirit
[53:46] anything contrary to the word
[53:49] anything you pick anything
[53:53] so simple but anything that's an
[53:55] antichrist spirit
[53:56] and you're gonna fight it until he's
[53:58] thrown into the lake of fire
[54:01] your will over his justify it give it a
[54:04] good reasoning
[54:06] we all do it i'm guilty right i'm not
[54:08] i'm not i'm the one guilty
[54:10] i'm pointing to me right so just so you
[54:12] know i'm not picking on anybody i'm
[54:12] pointing at me
[54:13] i was the one guilty i'm the one who he
[54:16] told point blank something
[54:17] and i'm the one who justified by my own
[54:20] human reasoning something that was
[54:21] contrary to the simplicity of his word
[54:23] i didn't even realize it but i was up
[54:25] against the antichrist spirit that was
[54:26] coming after me
[54:28] i didn't even realize it until god
[54:30] brought my attention to i said oh my
[54:31] goodness and i had to repent i did
[54:33] repent
[54:33] i really was down because i realized how
[54:37] subtle the enemy was he's so subtle it
[54:40] shocked me
[54:42] like i had no idea he would use such a
[54:44] simple
[54:45] like why does that care why so
[54:48] simple but i had a word on it
[54:52] and that was god and i was going to
[54:54] bypass god and take an evil spirit
[54:56] that's how you get evil spirits you
[54:58] bypass the word
[54:59] so simple it's it's you see
[55:03] this is we have to discern these things
[55:05] we have to be able to withstand this two
[55:06] spirits that'll work within the
[55:07] framework of the christian church
[55:09] an antichrist spirit which is anything
[55:11] anti-god anti-word
[55:12] right it can sound beautiful but who's
[55:15] hidden in beauty
[55:18] and then who's hidden and no beauty that
[55:22] we should be holding
[55:23] no nothing that we're like wow that's
[55:25] great no
[55:26] that's just what he said i like it i
[55:30] don't
[55:31] you always don't have to get excited
[55:32] that makes me excited i don't know i
[55:34] just like it when god
[55:35] talks to me personally and he shows me
[55:37] something and he shows me even in my
[55:38] mistake
[55:39] how this thing is working so slyly
[55:43] so sly and then god won't come down and
[55:45] thunder out judgment because you go that
[55:47] way he doesn't
[55:49] if you're his he'll correct you he'll
[55:52] give you a spanking
[55:54] but you know what you can still bypass
[55:56] that and still go to your own will and
[55:57] you know what he'll do he'll bless you
[55:59] he'll just keep blessing you bless you
[56:00] bless your bless you he told you it
[56:02] wasn't right but
[56:04] wow
[56:08] yeah so
[56:11] she can do the greater work she's an
[56:13] invincible army if they get a true
[56:15] revelation of the two spirits within the
[56:16] framework of the christian church and by
[56:18] god's spirit discern
[56:19] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[56:21] satan will be powerless
[56:23] before her he'll be as definitely
[56:24] thwarted today as when christ withstood
[56:26] his every effort to gain power over him
[56:28] in the desert
[56:28] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[56:31] it with real true revelation in our
[56:33] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[56:34] against
[56:35] us but we will prevail against them
[56:38] satan's eden then satan got to eve to
[56:40] listen to his gospel of theology
[56:43] the gospel of knowledge in higher
[56:44] schooling and of higher ethics and of a
[56:46] better civilization and of higher
[56:48] education
[56:49] and so forth so you see what he was
[56:50] doing man he was selling it
[56:53] he was good at selling it like it
[56:56] sounded good
[56:57] it was great educated but
[57:00] god's simple humble word was still there
[57:03] never went anywhere it was just simple
[57:06] see this is what i think god's doing
[57:07] right
[57:07] we've had a lot of things in 50 years a
[57:09] lot of things that comes up comes down
[57:11] and you start to realize well i wonder
[57:12] what this is really all about
[57:14] i think god's really just checking the
[57:15] desires of people's heart if you want
[57:17] something great big he'll give it to you
[57:20] but if you want him it'll be hidden in
[57:21] the simplicity of a lamb slain from
[57:23] before the foundation of the world
[57:24] and your identity with the lamb which is
[57:27] the word
[57:29] and you'll be killed all the day long
[57:30] for walking with it
[57:35] um oh computers there we go
[57:41] see higher education and so forth then
[57:44] when he got
[57:45] to her to stop and to listen to him for
[57:48] just one minute to his reasonings
[57:50] which he had commanded us to cast down
[57:54] that's when he got her to listen now you
[57:56] looky here
[57:57] church the church is so and so it's to
[58:00] be established
[58:01] for so long we're one of the oldest
[58:03] churches here we have the mayor coming
[58:05] to our church
[58:06] i don't care what it is you see if it's
[58:08] against god's word you be against
[58:11] it that is your enemy anything that's
[58:14] against
[58:15] the word is your enemy everything
[58:18] that's for the word is your brother
[58:22] he's a part of you so you see when the
[58:26] enemy comes in like a flood i'm not
[58:27] trying to shoot at
[58:28] you i'm just trying to shoot at the
[58:30] spirit of antichrist that would be
[58:31] working to try to paralyze and make us
[58:33] formal and powerless
[58:35] so right that's what we do we identify
[58:38] something by the word you say ah that's
[58:39] not the word brother
[58:41] not sister that's not the word i know
[58:42] god's blessing you in that career that
[58:44] you're pursuing but that's not the word
[58:46] like you can pursue that career if you
[58:47] want to but it's not the word
[58:49] let the older woman instruct the younger
[58:50] woman on how to be what
[58:53] you answer it yourself keepers at home
[58:55] and how to balance a career
[58:58] not what he said that's not his word but
[59:00] you know what he'll bless you in it you
[59:01] go right ahead
[59:02] god will bless you
[59:06] but don't you want to do his will don't
[59:09] you want to be found faithful
[59:10] and say don't you want to hear those
[59:12] words well done
[59:13] good and faithful servant you didn't
[59:15] pursue your own will you pursued mine
[59:18] because thou hast walked and i known
[59:19] choosing he told brother brown
[59:22] and it was the harder way you have
[59:25] picked the precise and correct way and
[59:26] it is my way
[59:28] right but brother banham had to learn
[59:30] things you know that
[59:31] he fell lots of times he came under
[59:33] wrong influences he came on the wrong
[59:35] influences of preachers sometimes
[59:37] remember that that was his big mistake
[59:39] he came under wrong
[59:40] influences and god would correct him
[59:43] just as he'll correct his bride
[59:45] he corrects me and i believe he'll
[59:46] correct you because we just want to do
[59:48] his will
[59:49] there's nothing good great about us
[59:51] there's no big ones among us
[59:53] right if the king of kings and lord of
[59:55] lords made himself of no reputation
[59:57] what do i have i got nothing
[1:00:01] i got no reputation
[1:00:04] i think when the bride loses her
[1:00:06] reputation she'll see god manifested in
[1:00:07] ways she never thought possible
[1:00:09] she stops trying to do things in her own
[1:00:11] strengths she'll see the power of god
[1:00:13] manifest
[1:00:14] like never before so humble
[1:00:20] so brother branham tells us the story
[1:00:22] here
[1:00:24] the way of the true prophet you know a
[1:00:27] lot of times angel come
[1:00:28] angels come down boy and how the
[1:00:30] pentecostals will sure eat that up
[1:00:33] how about when saint martin was standing
[1:00:35] there and here stood a great bright
[1:00:37] being stood before him
[1:00:39] and a man was bapti and the man who
[1:00:42] baptized in jesus name who believed in
[1:00:44] the holy ghost and kept the word
[1:00:46] and the romans kicking him out and doing
[1:00:48] everything to him
[1:00:50] trying to give him their dogmas and
[1:00:52] their
[1:00:53] man-made doctrines and the man stood on
[1:00:56] the word
[1:00:57] one day in his power the devils would
[1:01:00] come up to him
[1:01:01] and try to talk to him he wouldn't even
[1:01:04] pay them any attention
[1:01:06] one day satan came like that like christ
[1:01:10] crowned golden slippers on stood there
[1:01:13] and said
[1:01:13] don't you see blazes of fire all around
[1:01:16] him said don't you recognize me martin
[1:01:18] i am your lord worship me martin looked
[1:01:22] at him and said there's something wrong
[1:01:23] here
[1:01:24] he said martin can't you recognize me
[1:01:27] said i am your lord and savior said
[1:01:30] worship me
[1:01:31] he said it three times martin looked
[1:01:33] around he seen
[1:01:35] christ will be crowned by his people at
[1:01:37] his coming
[1:01:38] he wouldn't be wearing no golden
[1:01:40] slippers he said you get away from me
[1:01:42] satan
[1:01:43] oh how the pentecostals would sure be
[1:01:45] eating that up
[1:01:47] you see how did he discern this false
[1:01:51] image that was placed
[1:01:52] before him of christ it didn't match the
[1:01:55] original word
[1:01:57] it didn't match it didn't fit it really
[1:02:00] doesn't matter how big and beautiful
[1:02:02] something is presented to you as a false
[1:02:04] christ
[1:02:05] a false word if it doesn't match the
[1:02:07] original simplicity of god's word
[1:02:09] it's wrong just wrong
[1:02:12] i know sometimes we all want something
[1:02:14] like i wouldn't mind an angel coming and
[1:02:16] telling me
[1:02:16] but that doesn't fit the pattern that
[1:02:19] just doesn't fit the pattern
[1:02:21] i'll be obedient to his word he knows
[1:02:23] his bride will hearken into his
[1:02:24] voice she won't be moved by mountains
[1:02:27] she won't be moved by earthquakes and
[1:02:28] fires and winds
[1:02:29] she'll just be moved by the still small
[1:02:31] voice speaking through his word
[1:02:32] and shall walk right on into a rapture
[1:02:35] it's so simple
[1:02:37] christ in the mystery of god revealed
[1:02:39] the pregnant person with the seed of god
[1:02:41] the word in there manifesting itself so
[1:02:45] surrendered to the will of god
[1:02:46] that the word and the word alone
[1:02:49] manifest itself in the person you see
[1:02:52] is a prisoner to an individual it's
[1:02:55] individual
[1:02:55] one person all hell is against this
[1:02:58] teaching all hell is against this truth
[1:03:01] that god would reveal himself to you as
[1:03:03] an individual
[1:03:04] so quietly simply
[1:03:08] masterpiece and when he had made his
[1:03:09] first passing masterpiece he put
[1:03:11] him behind the word when he made his
[1:03:14] second masterpiece
[1:03:15] he was the word amen he was the word
[1:03:19] not behind the word but he was
[1:03:22] he was the word god never changes in his
[1:03:25] plan
[1:03:25] that's exactly what he started off to do
[1:03:28] in his first church
[1:03:29] was with the word now god the word
[1:03:32] in the beginning he was independent from
[1:03:35] all other
[1:03:36] everything else all other people now i
[1:03:38] don't mean to say this to be different
[1:03:41] god is a segregationist you know that
[1:03:43] you talk about integration but god's a
[1:03:45] segregationist
[1:03:47] he certainly does he'll separate his own
[1:03:49] his people from the world
[1:03:51] he separated israel his nation he is
[1:03:54] trying to separate his
[1:03:56] church from the world but the work but
[1:03:58] the church
[1:03:59] wants to go on with the world
[1:04:02] but his people is still segregated
[1:04:05] segregated to him
[1:04:06] who is he the word you see god's just
[1:04:09] going to bless both sides
[1:04:11] it's not going to he's not going to just
[1:04:13] right now curse the other side that
[1:04:14] rejects his word and he's going to bless
[1:04:15] that one too
[1:04:17] but he knows there's another little
[1:04:19] people little humble people
[1:04:21] that'll be looking at their lives
[1:04:23] through the mirror
[1:04:24] into the mirror reflecting their lives
[1:04:26] in the mirror of god's word and seeing
[1:04:29] something's not right remember christ in
[1:04:31] you is the hope of glory
[1:04:32] this is the seventh seal on on display
[1:04:34] just so you know
[1:04:36] it really is it's the it's the
[1:04:38] simplicity of a life of christ
[1:04:40] manifesting in you
[1:04:42] really is where did he go where was he
[1:04:45] at
[1:04:46] where is that big fellow brother ben
[1:04:48] said
[1:04:49] manifesting expressing learning
[1:04:51] obedience too much suffering
[1:04:53] in the form of a bride
[1:04:56] identified masterpiece he's making a
[1:04:58] bride yes sir
[1:05:00] and he's hewing and chipping her down
[1:05:02] chopping off the world
[1:05:04] oh church goings and creeds and
[1:05:05] denominations and their doctrines and
[1:05:07] their dogmas
[1:05:09] all has to be cut away from the church
[1:05:12] their ideas
[1:05:13] and their indifferences and their
[1:05:14] doctrines and everything
[1:05:16] they've got to come back and let the
[1:05:18] master pick up the bow
[1:05:19] let the master pick pick you up with his
[1:05:22] hands and strike the word
[1:05:24] say jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:05:27] today and forever he'll strum your life
[1:05:31] and you'll strike your life and you know
[1:05:32] what your life's going to speak
[1:05:34] jesus christ the word is the absolute
[1:05:37] the word is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:40] forever and my
[1:05:41] life is speaking what that word says
[1:05:44] there's the masterpiece in his hands
[1:05:47] he's cutting you now
[1:05:48] he's cutting you down to where it's the
[1:05:50] word only
[1:05:52] he's cutting all the creeds and your
[1:05:53] dogmas and everything away from you
[1:05:56] and he's trying to get a bride for his
[1:05:58] son
[1:05:59] another masterpiece part of his word
[1:06:05] now the great sculptors see he's
[1:06:07] counting on you
[1:06:10] willing to stand and have yourself
[1:06:12] shaped
[1:06:13] into the likeness of his requirements
[1:06:15] that the word
[1:06:16] requires is counting on you
[1:06:19] to stand there and let him cut you in
[1:06:22] these last days i'll pour out my spirit
[1:06:24] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[1:06:25] daughters shall prophesy
[1:06:27] christ is that identified masterpiece of
[1:06:29] the word made
[1:06:30] flesh you are asked to identify yourself
[1:06:33] with him
[1:06:34] by the same word to be the masterpiece
[1:06:37] of the bride
[1:06:40] matthew 5 44.
[1:06:49] sorry i'm gonna keep laying it in
[1:06:58] now
[1:07:03] so we know we are walking in his
[1:07:06] footsteps
[1:07:07] right our lives have to walk in those
[1:07:09] footsteps
[1:07:10] into that perfection in matthew 5 44
[1:07:15] jesus says but i say unto you love your
[1:07:17] enemies
[1:07:19] bless them that curse you and do good to
[1:07:21] them that hate you
[1:07:22] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:07:25] you and persecute you
[1:07:27] but what if they really said something
[1:07:29] nasty
[1:07:30] like come i mean i they're not even
[1:07:33] bride
[1:07:36] that doesn't mean anything
[1:07:39] like i've heard that and it makes my
[1:07:42] stomach turn
[1:07:44] they're not bride they're not elect i
[1:07:45] don't care
[1:07:47] what spirit's in you this isn't the
[1:07:49] spirit of christ
[1:07:50] christ is the word and he said you have
[1:07:51] to love your enemies
[1:07:53] i listened to a brother earl martin i
[1:07:55] think it was his testimony
[1:07:57] and i think they were trying to he was a
[1:07:59] preacher he's trying to throw him out of
[1:08:00] the church
[1:08:01] there was a man in the church i'm going
[1:08:02] to get you thrown out of this church you
[1:08:03] ain't ever preaching here again
[1:08:05] and he said well he said he worked up
[1:08:06] the whole church and the whole church
[1:08:08] had a big meeting come to find out
[1:08:10] nobody wanted him out of the church just
[1:08:11] this one man
[1:08:12] and the man said if you ever get that
[1:08:14] pulpit and preach i'm going to shoot you
[1:08:17] and brother earl martin says you know
[1:08:19] what happened he left and had a heart
[1:08:21] attack
[1:08:22] and he said serves him right that's what
[1:08:25] he said serves him right
[1:08:27] brother branham got word of brother
[1:08:29] branham approached him i don't know when
[1:08:30] it was came to him said don't you ever
[1:08:32] get in the pulpit and preach again until
[1:08:33] that spirit's changed
[1:08:35] he said don't you ever get in a pulpit
[1:08:37] and preach until you can pray
[1:08:39] and love that man like your best friend
[1:08:42] that's what he said it's earl martin
[1:08:45] brother earl martin if you want to i
[1:08:46] listened to testimony a while ago
[1:08:48] yeah ain't that something so if you
[1:08:50] can't love your enemies as your friend
[1:08:53] see there's a wrong spirit living in you
[1:08:57] see very simple
[1:09:03] so where are we at matthew 5 44 yeah
[1:09:07] but i say unto you love your enemies
[1:09:09] bless them that curse you and do good to
[1:09:10] them they hate you and pray for you
[1:09:11] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:09:13] and persecute you
[1:09:14] that you may be the children of your
[1:09:16] father which is in heaven
[1:09:18] for he maketh his son listen son to rise
[1:09:21] on the evil
[1:09:22] and on the good and sendeth his reign on
[1:09:24] the just
[1:09:25] and the unjust for if we love them which
[1:09:28] love you
[1:09:29] what reward have you do not even the
[1:09:32] publicans the same
[1:09:34] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:09:37] what do ye more than others do not even
[1:09:40] the publicans sow
[1:09:42] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:09:45] which is in heaven is perfect so
[1:09:48] do we have any criticism for anybody
[1:09:51] really
[1:09:52] no you really don't you have no ability
[1:09:55] to actually condemn the other person you
[1:09:57] make you can you not have to agree with
[1:09:59] them in what they do
[1:10:00] but you're not to hate them you're not
[1:10:02] to you know just absolutely say well
[1:10:04] they're not my brother and they don't
[1:10:05] believe things the way i do
[1:10:06] i'm telling you there's something not
[1:10:07] right with that spirit because it just
[1:10:09] doesn't match the spirit of his word
[1:10:11] because you have to love those that hate
[1:10:12] you and would want to do
[1:10:14] evil to you and he said in the spirit of
[1:10:16] christ and you will will do that
[1:10:18] see it's a good checkup they're real
[1:10:21] good checkups first corinthians 3 1
[1:10:26] and i brethren could not speak unto you
[1:10:29] as unto spiritual
[1:10:30] but as unto carnal even as unto
[1:10:33] babes in christ i have fed you with milk
[1:10:37] and not with meat
[1:10:38] for hitherto ye were not able to bear it
[1:10:41] neither
[1:10:42] yet are you now able so what
[1:10:44] disqualifies them
[1:10:46] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[1:10:49] is among you
[1:10:50] envying and strife and divisions
[1:10:54] are you not yet carnal and walk as men
[1:10:58] so if there's envine and strife and
[1:11:00] division among us guess what you're not
[1:11:02] even ready
[1:11:03] for the real meat of god's word you're
[1:11:04] still yet carnal in your understanding
[1:11:07] you're still not even got the spiritual
[1:11:09] mind of christ to be able to look beyond
[1:11:11] those things and
[1:11:12] recognize your position and what you're
[1:11:14] supposed to do
[1:11:15] in those situations matthew 19
[1:11:19] 8 if you don't mind
[1:11:24] and i love this years ago when i was
[1:11:29] studying marriage and divorce i came
[1:11:31] across this and it just
[1:11:32] it just really thrilled me when i saw
[1:11:34] this
[1:11:35] matthew 19 8 he saith unto them
[1:11:39] moses because the hardness of your heart
[1:11:41] suffered you to be put to put away your
[1:11:42] wives but from the beginning
[1:11:44] it was not so and as i say unto you
[1:11:46] whosoever shall put away of his wife
[1:11:48] except for the cause of fornication and
[1:11:50] shall marry another committeth adultery
[1:11:52] and whosoever marrieth her that is put
[1:11:54] awake doth commit
[1:11:55] adultery his disciples say unto him
[1:11:58] if the case of the man be so with his
[1:12:01] wife it is not good to marry
[1:12:03] but he said unto them all men can't
[1:12:05] receive the same save them to whom it is
[1:12:07] given
[1:12:08] for there are some eunuchs which are
[1:12:10] born from their mother's womb
[1:12:12] and there are some eunuchs which are
[1:12:14] made eunuchs of men
[1:12:15] and there are some eunuchs which have
[1:12:17] made themselves eunuchs
[1:12:18] for the kingdom of god's sake he that is
[1:12:21] able to receive it
[1:12:22] let him receive it because what he was
[1:12:24] saying was a very hard thing
[1:12:26] and he knows it but he's got a bride
[1:12:29] he's got a people he's got an elect that
[1:12:32] will choose to fulfill his word and even
[1:12:34] stay single the rest of their lives
[1:12:37] because his word said so
[1:12:40] they love him more than that
[1:12:43] even to and i know that's a tough one
[1:12:45] like that's tough i i'm not in that
[1:12:47] position so i can't say i personally
[1:12:48] can feel it but having one that has a
[1:12:50] wife if i was in that situation
[1:12:52] and i find that it was not pleasing to
[1:12:54] my lord and i did that
[1:12:56] i say god bless you whoever has been
[1:12:58] able to take that stand for the sake of
[1:13:00] the word
[1:13:00] you chose him over your own desire you
[1:13:03] chose a harder way
[1:13:05] you're walking with him see he's always
[1:13:08] walking that harder way
[1:13:10] but it's always his way and i just i
[1:13:12] always love that scripture because it
[1:13:14] just shows right here
[1:13:15] with god it looks tough i'm not even
[1:13:17] denying it in the world in the natural
[1:13:19] it looks tough but with god all things
[1:13:20] are possible
[1:13:21] all things are possible and there is a
[1:13:24] group that will receive his word
[1:13:28] now is everybody comfortable
[1:13:32] now i did put this in here and i was
[1:13:33] like i don't know if i should put all
[1:13:34] this in here
[1:13:35] but i i want yeah take a deep breath
[1:13:41] okay we go for another hour here we go
[1:13:43] so
[1:13:44] i want to read this and i know you've
[1:13:46] heard it but i just
[1:13:48] i feel to read it pick up your pen and i
[1:13:50] want to take my time in it
[1:13:51] and i just want to bring out some
[1:13:52] certain aspects of it because i think it
[1:13:54] so
[1:13:55] summarizes the entire thought that i
[1:13:58] just
[1:13:58] there's there's no reason to preach on
[1:14:00] it when the spirit of the lord says pick
[1:14:01] up your pen i want to tell the church
[1:14:02] something i think we should listen
[1:14:04] right so listen to this if you don't
[1:14:07] mind and i'll pause here for
[1:14:10] in the middle of it here's what i'm
[1:14:11] trying to say to you the law of
[1:14:13] reproduction
[1:14:14] is each specie brings forth of its own
[1:14:16] kind
[1:14:17] genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth
[1:14:20] bring forth grass
[1:14:22] and the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[1:14:24] tree yielding fruit after his own kind
[1:14:27] his seed is in itself upon the earth and
[1:14:30] it is so
[1:14:31] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[1:14:34] into the plant and fence
[1:14:36] into fruit the very same law applies to
[1:14:39] the church today
[1:14:40] whatever seed started the church will
[1:14:43] come forth
[1:14:44] and be like the original seed because it
[1:14:47] is the same seed
[1:14:49] in these last days the true bride church
[1:14:51] christ's seed
[1:14:52] will come to the headstone she will be a
[1:14:55] super church
[1:14:56] a super race as she nears him they and
[1:14:58] the bride will just be so much
[1:15:00] like him that they will even be in his
[1:15:02] very image
[1:15:04] this is in order to be united with them
[1:15:06] with him
[1:15:07] they will be one they will be the very
[1:15:10] manifestation of the word
[1:15:12] of the living god denominations can't
[1:15:15] produce this
[1:15:16] wrong seed they'll produce their creeds
[1:15:19] their dogmas
[1:15:20] mixed with the word and will mongrel
[1:15:24] this mongrelizing brings forth hybrid
[1:15:27] product the first son adam was a spoken
[1:15:30] seed word of god
[1:15:32] he was given a bride to reproduce
[1:15:34] himself
[1:15:36] there's the purpose of the bride that is
[1:15:38] why the bride was given to him to
[1:15:40] reproduce himself
[1:15:42] to produce another son of god but she
[1:15:45] fell
[1:15:46] she fell by hybridization and she caused
[1:15:49] him to die
[1:15:50] the second son jesus was also a spoken
[1:15:53] or was also a spoken seed word of god
[1:15:56] was given a bride like like as was
[1:16:00] adam but before he could marry her she
[1:16:02] had fallen
[1:16:03] she like adam's wife was put to the test
[1:16:07] whether she would believe the word of
[1:16:09] god and live
[1:16:11] or doubt the word and die she doubted
[1:16:15] she left the word she died from a little
[1:16:18] group
[1:16:19] of a true seed of the word god will
[1:16:21] present christ
[1:16:22] a beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:16:26] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:16:29] no
[1:16:29] man made creeds or dogmas by
[1:16:32] and through the members of the bride
[1:16:34] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:16:36] of god to be manifested
[1:16:38] in the virgin the word of promise came
[1:16:41] to the virgin mary but the word of
[1:16:44] promise
[1:16:44] was he himself to be
[1:16:48] manifested that's the one i want to hit
[1:16:51] he himself the reality of the hour in
[1:16:54] which we're living
[1:16:56] is shocking to me and it's so humble
[1:16:59] it's so simple i mean i was listening to
[1:17:00] brother
[1:17:01] chad and brother aaron and realizing
[1:17:03] that we're living in the very hour and
[1:17:04] it's so
[1:17:05] simple we're god there's an open door
[1:17:07] and there's a voice and a prophet to the
[1:17:08] age and he's calling us to come up
[1:17:09] higher and it's a rapture age that i'm
[1:17:11] getting called up into
[1:17:12] and the molecules in my body are
[1:17:14] changing i've been called out of dead
[1:17:15] denominationalism
[1:17:16] and it's happening and it's all
[1:17:18] happening right now
[1:17:20] so simple and so humble that it shocks
[1:17:23] me
[1:17:24] and i sit there with tears in my eyes
[1:17:25] i'm like lord how in the world
[1:17:29] billions of people and you're letting me
[1:17:31] hear these secrets
[1:17:32] you're letting me see you i i i don't
[1:17:35] deserve this i don't i don't even
[1:17:37] there's nothing in me good to deserve
[1:17:39] this and i'm sitting there in just utter
[1:17:41] shock and amazement that god's allowed
[1:17:43] me to hear these
[1:17:44] things and then have a heart's desire to
[1:17:46] walk in those things
[1:17:47] even the greatest desire of all and that
[1:17:49] is to me
[1:17:50] what's god's doing at this point he's
[1:17:52] really truly just hunting out a bride
[1:17:55] that just loves him really really loves
[1:17:57] him loves his word because he wants to
[1:17:59] bring himself into view again
[1:18:01] and how will he do that when you take
[1:18:03] the word and it becomes a living word
[1:18:05] in you as a obedient wife
[1:18:08] as a correct husband as a you know
[1:18:11] whatever you're doing at work whatever
[1:18:12] it is
[1:18:13] that's the word made manifest and it's
[1:18:15] going to be so humble that most people
[1:18:17] won't even notice it
[1:18:19] so very humble you see the whole idea of
[1:18:22] going back to something that's
[1:18:23] pentecostal with we're hooping and
[1:18:24] hollering and shouting
[1:18:26] and tongues and earthquakes and fires
[1:18:27] and all these things
[1:18:29] no no it's the word in the word only
[1:18:32] it's time for the word and the word only
[1:18:35] to be manifested in the bride
[1:18:38] not that i would take away from any
[1:18:39] gifts amongst us i believe they're there
[1:18:41] but we're not looking for that as a
[1:18:43] vindication of his presence
[1:18:45] we're looking for the word made
[1:18:46] manifested as the vindication of his
[1:18:48] presence amongst his people
[1:18:53] but that word but that word
[1:18:56] of promise was he himself to be made
[1:18:59] manifested
[1:19:00] god was made manifest he himself
[1:19:03] acted at that time and fulfilled his own
[1:19:05] word of promise
[1:19:07] in the virgin it was an angel that had
[1:19:10] brought her
[1:19:11] the message but the angel's message was
[1:19:14] the word of god
[1:19:15] isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all
[1:19:19] that was written of him
[1:19:20] because she accepted his word to her
[1:19:23] the members of his virgin bride will
[1:19:25] love him
[1:19:26] they will have his potentials for he is
[1:19:29] their head and all power belongs to him
[1:19:33] they are subject to him as members of
[1:19:35] our bodies are subject to our heads
[1:19:37] now notice the harmony of the father and
[1:19:40] of the son
[1:19:41] jesus never did anything until it was
[1:19:43] first showed him of the father
[1:19:45] john 5 19 the harmony is to now exist
[1:19:49] between the groom and the bride he shows
[1:19:52] her his word of life
[1:19:54] and she receives it she never doubts it
[1:19:57] therefore
[1:19:58] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:20:03] revelation's a rapture right rapture is
[1:20:05] a revelation
[1:20:06] it's the word she won't doubt the word
[1:20:10] not one of it and death won't be able to
[1:20:13] harm her
[1:20:14] because he'll just believe the
[1:20:15] simplicity of god's word
[1:20:17] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:20:18] will raise it back up again here's the
[1:20:20] secret of this
[1:20:21] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:20:23] mary the bride has the mind of christ
[1:20:26] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:20:29] his word
[1:20:30] she performs the command of the word in
[1:20:33] his name
[1:20:34] for she has thus saith the lord then the
[1:20:37] word
[1:20:38] is quickened by the spirit and it will
[1:20:40] come to pass
[1:20:42] like a seed that is planted and watered
[1:20:44] it comes to full harvest
[1:20:46] serving its purpose those in the bride
[1:20:49] will do
[1:20:49] only his will no one will make them do
[1:20:53] otherwise they have thus saith the lord
[1:20:57] or they keep still they know
[1:21:00] that it has to be god in them doing the
[1:21:02] works
[1:21:03] and fulfilling his word he did not
[1:21:05] complete his work
[1:21:07] all his work while he was in his earthly
[1:21:09] ministry so
[1:21:10] now he works in and through the bride
[1:21:13] she knows that for it was not yet
[1:21:16] time for him to do certain things that
[1:21:19] he must now
[1:21:20] do for he will now fulfill through the
[1:21:22] bride
[1:21:23] the that work which he has left for this
[1:21:26] specific
[1:21:27] time now let us stand like joshua
[1:21:30] and caleb our promised land is coming in
[1:21:33] sight
[1:21:34] even as theirs did now joshua means
[1:21:36] jehovah's savior and he represents the
[1:21:38] end time leader
[1:21:39] that will come to the church even as
[1:21:41] paul came as
[1:21:43] as the original leader caleb represents
[1:21:46] those that stayed true with
[1:21:47] joshua remember god had started israel
[1:21:50] as a virgin with his word
[1:21:52] but they wanted something different so
[1:21:55] did the last day
[1:21:56] church notice how god did not move
[1:21:58] israel or let her go into the promised
[1:22:00] land
[1:22:01] until it was his appointed time now the
[1:22:04] people
[1:22:05] might have put pressure on joshua the
[1:22:07] leader and said
[1:22:08] the land is ours let's go up and take it
[1:22:11] joshua
[1:22:12] you're all through you've lost your
[1:22:14] commission you don't have power like you
[1:22:16] used to have
[1:22:17] used to hear from god and then know the
[1:22:19] will of god and then act
[1:22:20] quickly something is wrong with you but
[1:22:23] joshua was a god-sent prophet and he
[1:22:25] knew what the promises of god
[1:22:27] he knew the promises of god so he waited
[1:22:30] for them
[1:22:31] he waited for a clear-cut decision from
[1:22:33] god
[1:22:34] and when it came time to move god placed
[1:22:37] sorry god placed the full leadership in
[1:22:39] joshua's hands because he had stayed
[1:22:42] with the word god could trust joshua
[1:22:45] but the other ones but not the others
[1:22:48] so it will repeat in the last day the
[1:22:50] same problems
[1:22:52] and the same pressures
[1:22:57] same problems and same pressures how can
[1:23:00] i tell the two spirits apart the
[1:23:01] pergament church age
[1:23:02] just give them the word test and if they
[1:23:04] don't speak that word you know they're
[1:23:05] of the evil one
[1:23:07] as the evil one deceived the first two
[1:23:08] brides he will try to deceive the bride
[1:23:10] in this last day
[1:23:11] trying to get her to hybridize herself
[1:23:13] with creeds or just plainly turning from
[1:23:16] the word to a sign that would suit her
[1:23:18] but god never placed signs ahead of the
[1:23:20] word signs follow the word as elijah
[1:23:22] told the woman to bake a cake for him
[1:23:24] first
[1:23:24] according to the word of the lord when
[1:23:26] she did as the word
[1:23:28] said the proper sign came came to the
[1:23:31] word
[1:23:32] first and then watch for the miracle the
[1:23:35] seed word
[1:23:36] is energized by the spirit i like that
[1:23:39] do i like that if you need to see the
[1:23:41] power of god manifested in your life
[1:23:43] just do what the word says take him at
[1:23:45] his word the word comes first you need
[1:23:47] healing in your body take the word
[1:23:49] repent of everything you got to do then
[1:23:51] you can say hey devil you got no right
[1:23:52] to be standing here anymore
[1:23:54] i've done all that the word told me to
[1:23:56] do now i'm waiting for him to come and
[1:23:58] energize this word that i have taken a
[1:23:59] hold of
[1:24:00] and what's going to stop that god will
[1:24:02] confirm his word
[1:24:04] so simple you see we wait for something
[1:24:08] to move upon us just take him at his
[1:24:09] word and then watch god do the action
[1:24:11] from that point on because that's
[1:24:12] technically what you're doing
[1:24:13] you're taking a hold of god when you
[1:24:16] take the word
[1:24:17] just so simple
[1:24:21] but what has happened to the word the
[1:24:22] word has been put aside this laodicean
[1:24:24] church age
[1:24:25] and god says i'm going against you i
[1:24:27] will spew you out of my mouth this is
[1:24:29] the end
[1:24:30] for seven out of seven ages i have seen
[1:24:32] nothing but men esteeming their own
[1:24:34] words
[1:24:35] above mine so at the end of this age i
[1:24:38] will spew you out of my mouth
[1:24:40] it's all over
[1:24:45] just makes you go low
[1:24:48] real low
[1:24:52] john 12 20. please turn
[1:25:12] and there were certain greeks that came
[1:25:14] to worship him at the feast
[1:25:16] and the same came therefore to philip
[1:25:18] which was at which
[1:25:19] was of bethesda of galilee and they
[1:25:21] desired him
[1:25:22] saying sir sir we would see jesus
[1:25:26] this really spoke to me philip cometh
[1:25:28] and telleth andrew and again
[1:25:29] andrew to philip tell jesus and jesus
[1:25:32] answered
[1:25:32] them saying the hours come the son of
[1:25:35] man should be glorified
[1:25:36] okay verily verily i say unto you except
[1:25:39] a corn of wheat
[1:25:40] fall into the ground and die it abide
[1:25:42] alone
[1:25:43] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:25:45] fruit
[1:25:46] he that loveth his life shall lose it he
[1:25:49] that hateth his life
[1:25:50] in this world shall keep it until life
[1:25:53] eternal
[1:25:54] if any man serve me let him follow me
[1:25:57] and where i am there oh there shall also
[1:26:01] my servant be if any man serve me
[1:26:04] him will my father honor now is my soul
[1:26:07] troubled
[1:26:08] and what shall i say father save me from
[1:26:10] this hour
[1:26:11] for this cause came i into this hour
[1:26:14] father glorify thy name then there came
[1:26:17] a voice from heaven
[1:26:18] saying i have glorified it and i'll
[1:26:21] glorify it again
[1:26:23] that's a bride i believe that's a bride
[1:26:26] he glorified it as a corn of wheat that
[1:26:28] fell in the ground and died and hated
[1:26:29] his own life didn't
[1:26:30] get didn't get a chance to even pursue
[1:26:32] those things he had a right to
[1:26:35] and he has a bride that'll walk in those
[1:26:36] same footsteps not pushed
[1:26:39] not forced by choosing shall choose him
[1:26:43] real real quietly she'll just choose him
[1:26:47] matthew 11 says come unto unto me all
[1:26:49] thee that labor and are heavy laban
[1:26:51] laden and i will give you rest
[1:26:53] take my yoke upon you and learn of me i
[1:26:56] am meek and lowly in heart
[1:26:58] and you shall find rest for your souls
[1:27:01] my yoke is easy
[1:27:02] and my burden is light philippians 2
[1:27:05] says let nothing be done through strife
[1:27:07] and vainglory but in loneliness of mine
[1:27:10] let each esteem the other better than
[1:27:12] themselves
[1:27:14] look not every man on his own things but
[1:27:16] every man on the things of others so let
[1:27:18] this mind be in you that was in christ
[1:27:20] jesus
[1:27:20] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:27:22] not robbery to be equal with god
[1:27:24] but made himself of no reputation
[1:27:28] and took upon himself the form of a
[1:27:29] servant and was made
[1:27:31] in the likeness of men
[1:27:34] he just became a servant to the word
[1:27:38] just do the will of god just the word
[1:27:40] and nothing more
[1:27:42] musicians if you'll come
[1:27:46] you'll be able to breathe

[1:31:28] even our greatest enemy wouldn't be able
[1:31:31] to say
[1:31:31] that man says and does evil things to me

[1:32:29] bless those that that don't have a
[1:32:31] heart's desire for you lord that's
[1:32:33] that's scary lord and um

[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:33] found in his likeness
[1:33:37] to hear him say well done
[1:33:40] someday
[1:33:45] i just want to please
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:34:03] in his presence
[1:34:06] found in his likeness
[1:34:09] to hear him say well done
[1:34:13] someday one more time
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:30] please
[1:34:40] [Music]
[1:34:44] is
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:55] amen anything that will root out the
[1:34:57] antichrist spirit in my life is a good
[1:35:00] message
[1:35:02] you know moses
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] he had a revelation of who he was
[1:35:10] he had a revelation of his proper birth
[1:35:12] given to him by his mother it was handed
[1:35:14] down and
[1:35:15] he knew what he was called to in life he
[1:35:17] was to deliver the children of israel
[1:35:21] but his initial ever effort in
[1:35:23] deliverance
[1:35:24] failed he killed an egyptian
[1:35:28] ran into the wilderness was rejected by
[1:35:31] his brothers
[1:35:32] because moses initial effort to bring
[1:35:35] forth the word of god in his life
[1:35:37] was completely according to his own
[1:35:39] desire and his own thoughts
[1:35:42] and he failed and god let him fail and
[1:35:45] he runs through the wilderness and in
[1:35:46] the wilderness
[1:35:47] through trials and through tribulations
[1:35:49] and through separations
[1:35:51] amen living with a hot tempered wife
[1:35:53] which is exactly what moses need
[1:35:55] begin to chip away at moses's self-will
[1:35:59] and resolve and he beat all of moses out
[1:36:02] of moses and he got all of the egyptian
[1:36:04] training out of him
[1:36:05] until finally moses couldn't do nothing
[1:36:08] right
[1:36:09] couldn't speak right couldn't deliver
[1:36:12] anybody
[1:36:13] couldn't do anything to help them down
[1:36:15] there in israel he
[1:36:16] he got to the place where he was
[1:36:17] convinced he wasn't the deliverer he
[1:36:20] couldn't do anything to help those
[1:36:21] people
[1:36:23] and that's where god wanted him because
[1:36:26] god wanted
[1:36:27] god it never changed moses purpose never
[1:36:30] changed his calling an election
[1:36:32] never changed his sonship it was still
[1:36:34] moses but moses had to get to the place
[1:36:36] where moses would have no confidence in
[1:36:38] moses so when god would tell him to do
[1:36:40] something it wouldn't get twisted it
[1:36:41] wouldn't get tainted
[1:36:42] and then if he said call for flies he
[1:36:44] called for flies
[1:36:46] he says go unto pharaoh and cast down
[1:36:49] your rod and go and cast it around
[1:36:50] nothing
[1:36:51] extra nothing less just exactly what he
[1:36:53] was told
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:56] i wonder what it's going to take to get
[1:36:59] us
[1:36:59] in the same place he's given us his word
[1:37:02] he's called us he's told us who we are
[1:37:03] and what our purpose is what we're
[1:37:05] supposed to do in this life
[1:37:06] amen none of that's going to change but
[1:37:08] i wonder if he doesn't let us make
[1:37:10] make these mistakes and fail so that we
[1:37:13] we quit
[1:37:13] having confidence in us that we stop
[1:37:16] trusting our reasoning stop trusting our
[1:37:19] ideas our intelligence
[1:37:20] and stop trusting our even our years of
[1:37:22] experience until we get to the place and
[1:37:24] said lord without your word i'm not
[1:37:26] going to move because i don't know what
[1:37:27] to do
[1:37:28] i'll mess it up i'll make another
[1:37:30] mistake i'll fail you again
[1:37:32] god just show me out of your word and if
[1:37:34] i can see your word and take your word
[1:37:36] on it i'll do it
[1:37:39] and that way god can do whatever
[1:37:41] whatsoever god wants to do
[1:37:44] he's going to have a bride and i believe
[1:37:45] that he wants to do a work through his
[1:37:47] bride
[1:37:48] i believe that and it may be
[1:37:52] more powerful than we could imagine it
[1:37:53] may be simpler than what we think i
[1:37:54] don't know
[1:37:55] but but he's got to get that bride to
[1:37:58] where she
[1:37:58] gladly submits to the simplest of the
[1:38:01] simple commandments
[1:38:02] before we ever call for her to call for
[1:38:04] flies
[1:38:06] why would why would he put that kind of
[1:38:08] power and authority
[1:38:09] into a bride who will not obey the
[1:38:12] simplest and littlest of things
[1:38:17] seems like lately god is drilling down
[1:38:19] into our lives and dealing with
[1:38:20] the nitty-gritty and the tiny and and
[1:38:23] dealing with these things
[1:38:25] but but don't resent that
[1:38:29] just say god deal with all of me deal
[1:38:32] with all of me lord everything just deal
[1:38:34] with it lord
[1:38:35] because we have no idea what's coming
[1:38:37] next
[1:38:38] and whatever is coming next god needs to
[1:38:41] root some things out of our life to
[1:38:42] self-will
[1:38:43] and self-desire and own understanding
[1:38:46] and own intelligence we've got to die
[1:38:48] out more to those things for whatever
[1:38:49] coming next friends
[1:38:51] god doesn't waste the preaching of the
[1:38:53] word he doesn't waste the anointing
[1:38:55] that's going forth it's all for a
[1:38:56] purpose
[1:38:58] what he's looking for is humble
[1:39:00] submission
[1:39:02] simplicity and he can do a lot with that
[1:39:05] i wrote down a phrase that i wanted to
[1:39:07] capture and not forget while kai was
[1:39:09] preaching he said this
[1:39:11] god can be expressed in the simplicity
[1:39:15] of his smallest commandment
[1:39:18] i want to express god i want to bring
[1:39:20] forth christ in this day
[1:39:22] christ can be expressed in the
[1:39:23] simplicity of his
[1:39:25] smallest commandment what is that
[1:39:28] manifesting the word do it in the little
[1:39:31] things we're doing the big things we do
[1:39:33] in all things and that's bringing forth
[1:39:35] christ
[1:39:36] the manifest word in this age
[1:39:40] the amen is so be it
[1:39:44] if god says it he's the amen
[1:39:48] if he's the amen what will his wife be
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:52] amen and if he said it in his word
[1:39:55] and he stamped it with an amen then i
[1:39:57] want to have the heart inside of me to
[1:39:59] stamp it back with an amen
[1:40:02] god said this is it i want to say this
[1:40:05] is it god help us
[1:40:09] i think all we can say after this is god
[1:40:12] help us
[1:40:13] without your spirit there's no way
[1:40:16] without election it's impossible
[1:40:18] without your choosing it's impossible
[1:40:20] you've chose before the foundation of
[1:40:22] the world or there's not a human being
[1:40:23] that could come to this level
[1:40:25] that god's calling for but because he
[1:40:28] chose
[1:40:29] now he'll send his spirit the matching
[1:40:31] piece of that chosen part
[1:40:33] amen so that he can bring to life what's
[1:40:35] laying there
[1:40:36] amen so he can accomplish his purpose on
[1:40:39] this earth
[1:40:41] say god help us help us to yield to that
[1:40:45] spirit
[1:40:46] help to help us to catch revelation upon
[1:40:49] revelation that will quicken your word
[1:40:51] so that we can have amen so that we have
[1:40:53] a desire for your word so that we can
[1:40:55] just walk
[1:40:55] in that word god help us
[1:40:59] humble us lord let us walk in simplicity
[1:41:03] an order you know what
[1:41:08] i'll say this last thing you know what i
[1:41:11] believe personally
[1:41:12] the greatest most dynamic if we can
[1:41:15] think of the most
[1:41:16] dynamic most powerful demonstration to
[1:41:19] the world
[1:41:20] of jesus christ in flesh if you can
[1:41:22] think of
[1:41:24] raising a dead person or whatever
[1:41:27] it will only be the simplicity of
[1:41:29] somebody obeying him
[1:41:32] the same simplicity that obeyed him and
[1:41:35] not speaking evil of a neighbor
[1:41:37] is the same simplicity that'll bring
[1:41:39] forth the greatest manifestation you can
[1:41:41] think of
[1:41:41] it's the same thing it's obedience to
[1:41:44] his word
[1:41:45] and following his leadership if we can
[1:41:47] do it in all the little things
[1:41:49] then we can do it in the big things too
[1:41:51] and if he can trust us with his
[1:41:52] re with his word he can trust us to keep
[1:41:55] it all and to subject ourselves to it
[1:41:57] he can trust us with everything
[1:42:01] so praise god that's what i want search
[1:42:04] me o god
[1:42:05] search me out uncover those things in me
[1:42:09] that where
[1:42:09] willfulness is laying uncovered lord i

[1:42:24] becoming so serious
[1:42:28] and so subtle it has me on pins and
[1:42:30] needles

[1:42:36] every moment of every day and it's got
[1:42:39] me on pins and needles
[1:42:41] because i realize there's no capability
[1:42:43] in me
[1:42:45] all capability is him
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:48] now i gotta be careful that i take
[1:42:51] enough time to listen to his voice
[1:42:53] but i read his word that i yield myself
[1:42:56] to it
[1:42:57] are all wind up off of his program
[1:43:01] he loves me he'll chase me and get me
[1:43:03] back but i
