[0:27] sealed in the book when the book was

[1:14] back to the same Revelation that you are
[1:17] part of God you were with him before the
[1:19] foundation of the world you were in his
[1:21] mind that mystery that he had in the
[1:22] back part of his mind included you as an

[2:21] god who's beyond my understanding I want
[2:23] a God that I can't boil down and put in
[2:25] my bottle and control in any way I want
[2:28] a God that's bigger than anything I've
[2:30] ever comprehended far beyond my
[2:32] understanding I want a God that wants to
[2:34] be searched and found and wants to
[2:35] unveil himself to his children I want a
[2:38] god who's new every day I want a god
[2:40] who's constantly revealing himself to me
[2:42] I want him deep I want him wide I want
[2:44] him shallow I want him on the surface I
[2:46] want him in the depths I want him in the
[2:48] cracks I want him in the crevices I want
[2:50] him in plain sight I want him
