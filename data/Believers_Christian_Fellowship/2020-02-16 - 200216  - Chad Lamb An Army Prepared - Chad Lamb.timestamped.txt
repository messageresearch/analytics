[14:03] so if you could do that i'd really
[14:05] appreciate it amen so let's
[14:07] read second timothy chapter 2
[14:10] verse 3.
[14:14] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[14:16] soldier of jesus christ
[14:18] no man that warth entangled himself with
[14:20] the affairs of this life
[14:22] that he may please him who hath chosen
[14:24] him
[14:25] to be a soldier amen are you soldiers
[14:30] we haven't been called to a picnic we've
[14:31] been called to a battle
[14:33] amen this battle started long ago in
[14:35] heaven and it's the same war it's the
[14:37] same battles continuing here today
[14:39] and we've been called soldiers in this
[14:41] battle but he says that no man
[14:46] no man that worth entangleth himself
[14:48] with the affairs of this life
[14:50] that he may please him who had chosen
[14:52] him to be a soldier
[14:54] the apostle paul was just drawing a
[14:55] parallel between the natural and
[14:57] bringing it over
[14:58] to the spiritual so that we would
[14:59] understand how we should walk
[15:02] and i'd like to take for a subject this
[15:03] morning as the lord wills
[15:05] an army prepared an army prepared let's
[15:08] bow our heads
[15:10] their heavenly father we thank you lord
[15:12] jesus for this day
[15:14] for this opportunity to be gathered here
[15:16] lord god what a privilege it is for us
[15:18] to stand before you
[15:20] god is a privilege to gather together
[15:22] and worship your name
[15:24] to sing your praises to hear lord the
[15:27] gifts in operation
[15:28] bringing glory to your name god as we
[15:31] turn to the preaching of the word now we
[15:33] just want to say we're looking to you
[15:34] lord
[15:35] not to any flesh being lord that's just
[15:38] a vessel that you've chosen to use in
[15:39] this hour
[15:40] but we're looking to you to come lord by
[15:43] the power of your spirit
[15:44] minister through lips of clay and bring
[15:47] us your word what you have for us in
[15:48] this hour
[15:49] what you're trying to accomplish through
[15:51] us at this moment in time
[15:52] we open ourselves to you lord and pray
[15:54] that you would speak directly to our
[15:55] hearts
[15:56] as we give you preeminence in jesus
[15:59] christ's name we pray
[16:00] amen you can all take your seats don't
[16:03] say i appreciated the specials very much
[16:06] i appreciate what god is doing
[16:09] god is speaking through his bride not
[16:12] just one voice
[16:13] and not just one gift but god is using
[16:17] all of his bride because we know this
[16:19] isn't a one-man ministry this
[16:21] isn't just uh for a selected group of
[16:24] people but
[16:25] god is wants to do his work through his
[16:27] many membered bride
[16:29] and it'll be every joint supplying every
[16:32] member participating everybody being led
[16:35] of the spirit
[16:36] and contributing as every joint
[16:38] supplieth
[16:40] so we're not looking anymore to sit back
[16:42] comfortably and relax as a few people
[16:44] play the game and we cheer them from the
[16:46] sidelines
[16:46] those days are over and it's not as
[16:49] though
[16:50] you know we're we're watching the battle
[16:52] take place in another foreign field and
[16:54] we're rooting our soldiers on
[16:55] that's not how it is anymore now the
[16:58] battles come to us
[16:59] and we're participants we're the
[17:01] soldiers we're the front line
[17:03] we're not rooting for the front line we
[17:04] are the front line
[17:06] and so our whole attitude is shifting
[17:09] god is changing
[17:10] our the way we see things the way we
[17:12] feel about things he's changing our
[17:13] understanding
[17:14] he's he's tuning us in more acutely than
[17:17] we've ever been tuned in before
[17:19] to what is actually happening in the
[17:21] spirit world
[17:22] amen it's not that we didn't know these
[17:24] things it's not that we didn't believe
[17:26] them it's not that
[17:26] we didn't have a desire for them but god
[17:29] is making us
[17:30] more aware and more aware of what's
[17:32] going on all the time
[17:34] where we are and who we are and what our
[17:36] position is and what we're supposed to
[17:38] be doing
[17:39] and that's the thing that matters
[17:40] because god's going to have it
[17:42] his bride on on display and it's going
[17:44] to be the full
[17:46] power through the full bride so nobody
[17:49] gets to be left out
[17:51] so praise god you can't be left out
[17:54] if you're part of this bride you can't
[17:56] be left out but you have a position and
[17:58] you have a part
[17:59] and there's a purpose for you in this
[18:01] body of jesus christ
[18:03] but that's exciting to say that i can't
[18:05] be left out that's one
[18:06] that's one side one side of it is saying
[18:09] praise the lord i can't be left out
[18:10] praise the lord i'm part of it but on
[18:12] the other side comes a tremendous
[18:14] responsibility of taking your place
[18:19] so it's great to say i'm part of it
[18:21] praise god i'm part of this army
[18:23] but when you realize i'm part of this
[18:25] army means that i'm responsible to do
[18:28] my part in the army i there comes with
[18:31] that
[18:32] this is the way it always is in the
[18:33] kingdom of god too much is given much is
[18:35] required
[18:36] there's always this relationship with
[18:38] the lord where there's mutual dependency
[18:40] on one another
[18:42] amen in the body and there's always this
[18:44] great power and authority
[18:46] but it comes with great responsibility
[18:48] and humility
[18:50] god keeps it so balanced that that as he
[18:53] as he as he lifts the power and as he
[18:55] lifts the demonstrations or the gifts in
[18:57] the spirit
[18:58] he also lifts the responsibility amen
[19:01] and the utter dependence on him
[19:04] so that nothing gets out of whack
[19:05] nothing gets out of place
[19:08] and for that we thank him so you can
[19:10] rejoice and say i'm part of this army i
[19:12] can't be left out
[19:13] i can't be left behind nobody can take
[19:15] my place there's a place just for me
[19:17] that's on one side the most glorious
[19:19] thing that has ever happened to you and
[19:21] on the other side
[19:22] it's the most fearful thing that has
[19:24] ever happened to you
[19:26] at the same exact time because it
[19:29] because i have a place that nobody else
[19:31] can take that place i have a position
[19:33] that nobody can take my position
[19:35] there's a work for me to do that nobody
[19:37] else can take it means that god is going
[19:39] to chastise me
[19:40] and rebuke me and come after me until i
[19:43] fulfill that purpose
[19:46] so it's glorious but it's also fearful
[19:49] because it's going to happen friends and
[19:51] god's going to bring the chastisement
[19:53] that's needed he's going to work the
[19:54] circumstances out in our life
[19:56] that's required to keep us in that
[19:58] position because he's not going to pick
[20:00] somebody else to do the job
[20:01] he chose you from before the foundation
[20:03] of the world and he knew what age you
[20:05] would come forth he knew what bed and
[20:06] ground you would come forth in and he
[20:08] knew what purpose he purposed in his
[20:10] heart
[20:10] when he did it and nothing's going to
[20:13] afford that purpose he did it according
[20:15] to his own will
[20:16] and it's going to happen
[20:19] that's fearful
[20:22] i say it's glorious but it's fearful
[20:25] amen because if we're not doing that
[20:27] then you rest assured the the tender
[20:29] hand of jehovah is going to move along
[20:31] and bring the circumstances about to put
[20:34] us in that position
[20:36] [Music]
[20:37] we can't play with the things of god
[20:41] we can't just rejoice in the blessings
[20:44] and the benefits if we're not also
[20:46] willing to take the correction
[20:48] and the placing and the responsibility
[20:52] they come together we want to shout and
[20:55] dance and rejoice at who we are
[20:57] but who we are brings about a
[20:59] responsibility
[21:01] that we can't shirt that responsibility
[21:04] so the two go hand in hand we've got to
[21:07] be very careful
[21:09] now that we understand fully what's
[21:11] going on
[21:15] let's look back at first timothy chapter
[21:17] 6
[21:22] and verse 11.
[21:31] first timothy 6 and 11 but thou o man of
[21:33] god flee these things and follow after
[21:36] righteousness
[21:37] godliness faith love patience meekness
[21:42] fight the good fight of faith he's
[21:45] telling timothy to fight the good fight
[21:46] of faith
[21:48] to actually fight don't sit on the
[21:51] sidelines
[21:53] don't watch somebody else do it but
[21:56] fight the good fight of faith
[22:00] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[22:01] on eternal life warren two thou art also
[22:04] called
[22:04] and has professed a good profession
[22:06] before many witnesses
[22:08] so the apostle paul was constantly using
[22:10] this language
[22:11] of warfare this language of fighting
[22:14] this language of soldiers and war and
[22:16] armies if you look through the old
[22:18] testament and you look at the nation of
[22:20] israel
[22:21] and then god called them to be an army
[22:24] he called them to fight he called them
[22:26] to war amen and
[22:27] that's just a natural type of a
[22:29] spiritual bride
[22:31] and and we can see our what we're
[22:33] supposed to be doing and what our
[22:35] position is
[22:36] by looking at what god did through
[22:37] israel
[22:39] i want to read out of the church age
[22:41] book from the revelation of jesus christ
[22:43] it says now remember this christ in the
[22:45] true church is a continuation of the
[22:47] book of acts
[22:48] but the book of revelation shows how
[22:50] that the antichrist spirit would come
[22:52] into the church and defile it
[22:53] making it lukewarm formal powerless it
[22:56] exposes satan revealing his works
[22:59] attempted destruction of god's people
[23:01] and the discrediting of god's word
[23:03] we said this before but if you want to
[23:05] know what the works of the devil is
[23:07] the prophet of god just told us it
[23:09] exposes his
[23:10] it reveals his works the attempted
[23:13] destruction of god's people
[23:14] and the discrediting of god's word
[23:18] right down to the time he is cast into
[23:20] the lake of fire
[23:21] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[23:23] knows that if the people get the true
[23:25] revelation of the true church
[23:26] and what she is and what she stands for
[23:29] and that she can do the greater works
[23:31] she will be an invincible army if they
[23:34] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[23:36] within the framework of the christian
[23:38] church
[23:38] and by god's spirit discern and
[23:40] withstand the antichrist spirit
[23:42] satan will be powerless before her he
[23:45] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[23:47] when christ withstood his every effort
[23:49] to gain power over him in the desert
[23:51] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[23:54] it
[23:54] with true revelation in our lives the
[23:56] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[23:59] but we will prevail over them
[24:02] prophet is going right back to
[24:04] terminology invincible army prevailing
[24:06] over the gates of the enemy
[24:08] it's all spiritual warfare
[24:11] and god wants to have victory in this
[24:13] hour
[24:15] now we haven't come to the hour where he
[24:17] wants to be defeated and we've not come
[24:18] to the hour when he wants a perpetual
[24:20] battle
[24:22] we're coming to the time where we're
[24:23] coming to the final battle
[24:25] we're coming to a time where we're
[24:26] coming to the final the final
[24:29] a showdown the final battle the final
[24:31] face-off
[24:32] amen that's going to absolutely reverse
[24:34] everything that was started
[24:35] in the garden of eden amen and further
[24:37] back what was started
[24:39] in heaven when war broke out there
[24:40] through rebellion it is
[24:42] all being reconciled restored and it's
[24:44] going to happen through these final
[24:46] moments in time
[24:48] and you're the army he picked to fight
[24:50] the battle
[24:52] i mean it's not we're not here to just
[24:54] perpetuate the battle
[24:55] we're here to finish it
[24:58] what what what kind of dedication will
[25:01] that require
[25:03] what kind of sincerity will that require
[25:05] what kind of prayer life will that
[25:07] require
[25:08] what is the requirement this day for
[25:10] that
[25:11] measure of manifestation
[25:14] these things don't come trivial they
[25:16] don't come easy
[25:17] amen they don't come without sacrifice
[25:21] but we're called to it it's for us to do
[25:25] this is the hour for us
[25:28] so with much is given much is required
[25:32] let's go to second corinthians
[25:42] second corinthians chapter 10
[25:50] verse 3
[25:53] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[25:55] not war after the flesh
[25:57] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[25:59] carnal
[26:00] but mighty through god to the pulling
[26:02] down of strongholds
[26:04] not anything natural
[26:08] they're not carnal carnal means natural
[26:11] not anything natural
[26:12] but they're mighty through god to the
[26:14] pulling down of strongholds
[26:17] casting down imaginations in every
[26:20] high thing that exalted itself against
[26:22] the knowledge of god
[26:24] and bringeth into captivity every
[26:25] thought to the obedience of christ
[26:28] so when he talks about this warfare amen
[26:31] it's not
[26:31] carnal but it's strong through god to
[26:33] the pulling down of strongholds
[26:35] then he begins to describe this
[26:37] description in verse 5 is interesting
[26:40] casting down imaginations where do they
[26:42] take place in your mind
[26:45] and every high thing that exalted itself
[26:46] against the knowledge of god where's
[26:48] that
[26:49] knowledge of god and bringing into
[26:50] captivity every thought
[26:52] thought to the obedience of christ he's
[26:55] talking about where the greatest battle
[26:56] was fought is fought in the mind
[26:59] and the victory comes through the
[27:00] weapons of our warfare which are not
[27:02] carnal but they are spiritual
[27:04] and god wants us to fight this battle
[27:06] amen and the battle is not being fought
[27:08] over here and over there and over there
[27:10] the battle's being fought right here
[27:13] and he's going to have the final victory
[27:15] in a group of people that will not be
[27:16] overcome by satan's deception in his
[27:18] lives
[27:19] but his work will be completely revealed
[27:22] before them
[27:22] he will be laid bare and he will not be
[27:25] able to gain the victory over them
[27:27] because of the level of revelation that
[27:29] they've come to
[27:30] and the obedience they have and the
[27:32] subjection they have to the word
[27:34] of god will eliminate is a power of
[27:36] deception
[27:38] that's why the word has come so plain in
[27:40] this day and that's why the word that
[27:42] was given to us and delivered through a
[27:43] prophet
[27:44] is still being unfolded to us is coming
[27:46] more clear and more
[27:48] clear all the time because it's the
[27:49] revelation
[27:51] amen that gives us the weapons to fight
[27:53] the enemy
[27:54] because he comes through deception and
[27:56] god defeats him through revelation
[28:01] so we live in the hour of the greatest
[28:02] revelation
[28:04] because upon earth is the greatest
[28:06] deception
[28:08] but there's a people who've been
[28:09] equipped to overcome the deception
[28:12] amen but the equipment that we have is
[28:14] not
[28:15] carnal so it is not reasoning it is not
[28:18] the thoughts of
[28:19] man it is not the education of man amen
[28:22] but what god has given us
[28:23] is a revelation on his word amen if we
[28:26] want a revelation on the word
[28:28] we are going to have to be in the word
[28:33] it's been given to us in this hour the
[28:35] word has been given to us in this hour
[28:38] but it can't it can't be something that
[28:41] is just part of our lives amen
[28:45] a piece of our life i should say it that
[28:47] way
[28:48] that's not the hour we're called to
[28:50] friends this word that's been given to
[28:52] us
[28:53] isn't a portion of our life our
[28:56] our church family and going to church
[28:59] and and all of that two times a week
[29:01] traditionally that's always a part of
[29:03] everybody's life you know
[29:04] i'm part of this church and i attend
[29:06] that church and
[29:08] and you know we we we believe in god and
[29:11] and we have a portion of our life is
[29:13] given over to the things of god
[29:15] that's not the hour that we live in but
[29:17] we live into the hour where our whole
[29:20] life is given to this word it is our
[29:22] whole
[29:23] life we meditate on it we think about it
[29:26] we contemplate in it we
[29:28] feed on it around the clock amen if
[29:30] we're not playing a tape or listen to a
[29:32] book we're meditating on the words that
[29:34] we've heard
[29:36] we're talking about it with one another
[29:38] why because we've come to the
[29:40] greatest hour of victory but it's going
[29:42] to be by revelation
[29:44] on this word we've got to it's got to be
[29:47] more than part of our life amen it has
[29:50] to be our life
[29:54] and you can see in satan's eden how
[29:56] critical this is
[29:59] because there's distractions
[30:02] everywhere for
[30:05] all of us
[30:09] it used to be that preachers would harp
[30:11] on the teenagers
[30:13] in entertainment worldly things friends
[30:16] is closer than that
[30:18] it's for all of us satan's eden is there
[30:22] i mean we're immersed in it we're
[30:24] walking around
[30:25] in it we're bombarded by it
[30:31] it's going to take the word
[30:35] a full surrender and a full giving of
[30:38] ourselves
[30:39] to the word that includes
[30:43] that includes reading the message
[30:45] reading the bible
[30:46] listening to prophet coming to church
[30:49] having fellowship
[30:50] praying all of that's included
[30:53] but it's going to have to be our whole
[30:55] life not just part of our life
[30:58] it is you can't stop you know you have
[31:01] to work the scripture says that a man
[31:03] not work let him not eat
[31:04] they're still working that's still part
[31:06] of what god's called us to do
[31:08] we're not going to start a monastery and
[31:10] become monks
[31:11] that's not what god's called us to in
[31:13] this hour he's called us to be
[31:14] there in satan's eating as lights
[31:18] as those little lights the prophet saw i
[31:19] saw one just flicker here and one just
[31:21] flickered there
[31:22] and that was you and i friends
[31:25] and we're supposed to be there amen but
[31:28] but not
[31:28] consumed by those things we can become
[31:31] consumed by our job
[31:34] but we're not called to be consumed by
[31:35] our job we're there
[31:38] for his purpose
[31:41] we have to know god placed me there he
[31:43] gave me that job he put me there to
[31:44] fulfill his purpose
[31:47] and when he wants to change that he'll
[31:49] change that
[31:50] i'll go somewhere else and fulfill
[31:51] another purpose but i'm not
[31:53] here to outperform everybody else to
[31:55] crime the corporate ladder to spend all
[31:57] of my time immersed in this thing amen
[31:59] so i can have super success in what i'm
[32:01] doing here
[32:03] you're there to fulfill his purpose go
[32:05] and fulfill his purpose if he wants you
[32:07] to have success you'll have success
[32:11] but it's it's not where our heart should
[32:13] be
[32:15] our heart should not be in being the the
[32:18] most successful here our heart should
[32:20] not be
[32:20] in accomplishing the most here our heart
[32:23] should be
[32:24] and accomplishing the most right here
[32:25] [Music]
[32:27] what does he want from me spiritually if
[32:29] i never get a promotion
[32:31] i don't care as long as i'm promoted in
[32:33] the kingdom of god
[32:34] that's my only desire
[32:39] we're coming
[32:42] we're transitioning i don't know how
[32:45] else to say it
[32:47] and i can't qualify that i can't i can't
[32:50] give you
[32:50] facts and figures and i i can't show you
[32:53] statistics
[32:54] but i know in my spirit i know in my
[32:56] heart the way god's leading me
[32:58] this is another translation trans
[33:00] transition for the bride
[33:02] something is transitioning now god is
[33:04] wanting to lift us higher and we've been
[33:06] through so many of these times we'll
[33:08] lift this up
[33:08] amen and we always feel like this is the
[33:10] last one
[33:14] times where god works spiritually among
[33:15] us and he lifts us up in revelation and
[33:18] he lifts us up in a walk
[33:19] amen but then you'll find that god gives
[33:21] us time to absorb on that new level
[33:25] and every time he does you think this is
[33:26] the last one this is it this is the push
[33:29] to the finish line
[33:31] and the truth is it is but may not be
[33:34] according to our understanding
[33:36] but i sense in my spirit this is another
[33:39] transition
[33:41] this is another lifting up time
[33:44] and i want to be sensitive to that i
[33:46] want to pay attention to what god's
[33:48] telling us
[33:49] let's go to ephesians chapter 6
[33:54] ephesians 6 and verse 10.
[34:06] ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren
[34:10] be strong in the lord in the power of
[34:12] his might
[34:13] put on the whole armor of god that you
[34:15] may be able to stand against the wiles
[34:16] of the devil
[34:18] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[34:19] blood but against principalities
[34:21] against powers against the rulers of the
[34:24] darkness of this world
[34:25] against spiritual wickedness in high
[34:27] places
[34:28] therefore take unto you the whole armor
[34:30] of god that you may be able to withstand
[34:32] in the evil day and having done all to
[34:34] stand
[34:35] stand therefore having your loins gird
[34:37] about with truth
[34:38] and having on the breastplate of
[34:40] righteousness and your feet shod with
[34:42] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[34:44] and above all take the shield of faith
[34:46] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[34:47] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[34:50] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[34:52] sword of the spirit
[34:54] which is the word of god praying always
[34:57] with all prayer and supplication in the
[34:59] spirit
[34:59] and watching there unto with all
[35:01] perseverance and supplication
[35:03] for all saints praise god
[35:07] what's the apostle paul telling us same
[35:09] thing he's telling you everywhere else
[35:10] you're in a war it's not
[35:14] one that your eyeballs can detect
[35:17] but this is a spiritual war and he's
[35:20] given you weapons and he's given you
[35:22] armament
[35:23] and none of it's carnal not one
[35:26] speck of its carnal it's all spiritual
[35:30] it's spiritual armament it's a spiritual
[35:32] weapon for a spiritual war
[35:35] and god is bringing us to a spiritual
[35:37] showdown
[35:39] we see manifestations of the spirit
[35:40] world all around us we'll see more
[35:42] manifestations all around
[35:44] us because that's the hour we're coming
[35:45] to but the manifestations isn't what we
[35:47] should be chasing it's the spiritual
[35:49] warfare
[35:50] the unseen brother bam said in putting
[35:53] on the hormone of god
[35:55] you know i believe it was lincoln that
[35:57] said one time in the time of peace
[35:58] prepare for war or it might not have
[36:01] been but it sounded like seems to me
[36:03] rather
[36:04] it was he made the statement the time of
[36:06] peace prepare for war
[36:07] and that would be a good thing for us to
[36:09] think about in time
[36:10] while everything is running smooth you
[36:12] better get ready for satan isn't going
[36:14] to let it run smooth very long
[36:19] the problem with us is when the
[36:21] pressure's off the dedication drops
[36:25] i can say us because i know what it's
[36:28] like i'm part of
[36:29] us when the when the pressure's on
[36:33] oh we live the most consecrated life i
[36:35] mean there's been times under pressure i
[36:37] have prayed all night
[36:39] it wasn't hard to stay awake and it
[36:40] wasn't hard to find something to pray
[36:42] about
[36:44] all right the pressure's on when it's
[36:46] intense amen dedication
[36:48] amen sincerity and consecration is no
[36:52] problem
[36:52] when the pressure comes on and you need
[36:54] god it's not hard to kick stuff out of
[36:56] your house
[37:00] when you find out that you get a
[37:01] diagnosis from the doctor amen and you
[37:04] know that there's going to be
[37:05] a real battle lays ahead of you it's not
[37:07] hard to go clean house
[37:12] but we get relaxed in a time of peace
[37:16] and that's when israel always got in
[37:19] trouble
[37:21] always they got in trouble when the
[37:24] pressure was off
[37:27] and i say god don't let us follow that
[37:29] path those things were done in the old
[37:31] testament for our examples
[37:33] so that we won't go that way amen if
[37:36] right now things are good amen and the
[37:38] economy is good and my job is good and
[37:40] my family is good
[37:41] and the church is good and everything's
[37:43] good that's the time to practice for war
[37:46] that's the time to drill that's the time
[37:48] to prepare amen when in the peace time
[37:50] is the time
[37:51] not to stop the drills not to stop
[37:55] amen when the sergeant would come along
[37:57] and say unpack that amen un
[37:59] unpack that parachute now pack it again
[38:02] packing it packing again you packed it
[38:06] that didn't look right unpack it pack it
[38:08] again
[38:09] why because right now you're not under
[38:12] pressure but you got to learn
[38:13] amen how to pack that thing and pack it
[38:16] right until it becomes second nature
[38:18] because in the heat of the battle when
[38:19] things are coming fast and you don't
[38:21] have time to think about it and you
[38:23] don't have time to make decisions
[38:24] and you ain't got time to go get prayed
[38:26] up and spend a week fasting and getting
[38:28] consecrated again
[38:29] you got to be ready when it happens it
[38:31] happens fast
[38:33] there's times in our life that disaster
[38:35] strikes us and it takes our breath the
[38:37] way it comes so fast
[38:38] [Applause]
[38:40] that's not the time amen to go get
[38:42] prayed up and start repenting of things
[38:44] and cleaning things down
[38:45] now's the time now is the time to be
[38:48] prepared
[38:49] because we know what the prophet told us
[38:51] we know what the end time is like
[38:52] we know we're in satan and we know
[38:54] beyond a shadow of doubt
[38:55] things are not going to stay the way
[38:57] they are now
[38:59] i don't know when i don't know when
[39:01] things will begin to tighten up
[39:03] i don't know when what the prophet told
[39:04] us is going to change but i guarantee
[39:06] one thing
[39:07] it's not going to stay the way it is now
[39:11] it may be months it may be years it may
[39:13] be decades
[39:15] so don't get me wrong i'm not saying
[39:17] something's happening tomorrow
[39:19] i'm just saying it's going to happen
[39:23] we should take advantage of every
[39:24] opportunity we got amen well we got
[39:26] bibles and we've all got church and we
[39:28] got fellowships and we got the message
[39:30] we should never take it for granted but
[39:32] we should be feeding on it constantly
[39:34] around the clock
[39:35] desperate as though tomorrow we're
[39:37] getting shipped off overseas to battle
[39:41] you never know when it's happening you
[39:43] never know when it's coming to your
[39:45] house
[39:45] you never know when it's coming to your
[39:46] life
[39:51] amen the laodicean condition is still
[39:54] all around us
[39:56] and it's still easy to slip into that
[39:58] condition
[40:02] praise be to god
[40:05] you know last sunday i came and i
[40:07] preached the message
[40:09] the way he told me to preach it
[40:12] and it wasn't a message i wanted to
[40:14] preach
[40:16] but god downloaded that message to me
[40:18] saturday morning in prayer
[40:21] and i had other funner things that i
[40:24] wanted to preach on things that i like
[40:29] i'd like to talk about feast of trumpets
[40:32] jubilee
[40:33] those are fun i like to dig down to the
[40:36] nitty-gritty
[40:37] and look at one word to me that's fun
[40:42] the half of you it's not but to some of
[40:43] you you like it
[40:46] so i had in my mind what i had other
[40:50] things that i've been dwelling on and
[40:51] meditating on other things directions
[40:53] i'd like to go in
[40:54] when i went to prayer god all of a
[40:56] sudden took over
[40:59] started downloading downloading
[41:02] downloading and i got up and
[41:05] you know we always want god to speak who
[41:07] wants god to speak
[41:09] so many times i pray if god would just
[41:11] tell me
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:14] and i'm on my knees and he just tells me
[41:17] exactly i'm not there's sometimes i'm
[41:19] laboring all
[41:20] weekend to try to find out what god
[41:22] wants to pray on sunday and i'll spend
[41:24] all day
[41:24] saturday and sometimes i've been in
[41:26] tears saturday night at nine o'clock
[41:28] weeping before the lord saying god i
[41:29] have nothing to feed your children i've
[41:31] got no inspiration for any would you
[41:33] please give me something
[41:36] and you're so desperate god give me
[41:37] something and then when god gives you an
[41:39] inspiration you're so excited you're
[41:40] like a little kid
[41:41] you know you can't wait to run it out
[41:44] but
[41:44] saturday i got up and the first thing i
[41:47] said was not oh thank you jesus you gave
[41:49] me something
[41:50] i said god i don't want to preach that
[41:55] because i know i know what it's like
[41:59] i know what kind of tension it puts
[42:01] people under
[42:03] i know what kind of questions will be
[42:05] asked i know what kind of pressure comes
[42:08] with that
[42:08] i know i'm not ignorant i know ahead of
[42:11] time
[42:13] i knew exactly some of the questions
[42:15] that would be asked
[42:18] and what i wanted to do was come along
[42:20] and say hey don't worry
[42:21] it's not as bad as you think
[42:23] everything's going to be all right but
[42:24] god wouldn't let me do that
[42:25] i told it the way he told me to tell it
[42:29] now i'm not saying every word i said is
[42:30] what god told me to say i didn't say
[42:32] that
[42:32] some of that was just by inspiration
[42:34] some of that was just brother chad
[42:35] according to the way god works with me
[42:38] but many of those things we hit i i
[42:40] preached if i didn't preach every word i
[42:42] preached it with the spirit
[42:44] and with the intent he told me to preach
[42:46] it
[42:47] so i came and i preached what he told me
[42:49] to preach
[42:52] and and that's what we want but
[42:55] sometimes what we want
[42:58] hurts worse than we expected it to hurt
[43:03] sometimes what we want requires more
[43:05] than we thought we would have to give
[43:08] do we understand that we want god to
[43:11] speak
[43:12] and when he does we start you know last
[43:15] week
[43:15] brother chad was right on but this week
[43:17] i just don't know
[43:19] [Music]
[43:20] we've got to be really careful
[43:23] really careful that we don't start to
[43:27] inject reasoning we've got to be super
[43:30] careful
[43:33] now last week
[43:37] i can tell you this now but i couldn't
[43:40] tell you then
[43:43] last week is not about the necklace
[43:47] it's not about the necklace it's really
[43:51] some of those things really aren't a big
[43:52] deal to me
[43:54] god forgive me if i'm wrong it's not
[43:56] about the necklace
[43:59] it's about preeminence
[44:02] it's about preeminence in his bride
[44:06] it wasn't about the garment it's about
[44:09] preeminence
[44:11] i wanted to tell you these things last
[44:12] week and i couldn't and i couldn't wait
[44:14] to come wednesday
[44:15] and tell you those things because i
[44:16] wanted to take the pressure off because
[44:18] i knew there was pressure
[44:19] and i wanted to relieve the pressure and
[44:21] guess what happened wednesday night
[44:24] we got a snowstorm and the timing on the
[44:28] forecast was the worst timing
[44:30] and the heaviest snowfall was the worst
[44:32] time it could fall
[44:33] and i waited as late into the day as i
[44:35] could
[44:36] to cancel service but i finally got to
[44:38] the point where i had to cancel it
[44:40] and then no snow there was no snowflakes
[44:44] and i said oh god help me i canceled my
[44:47] worst fear was a cancer service it won't
[44:48] snow one flag
[44:51] so i can't tell you how happy i was when
[44:53] it started dumping snow
[44:56] i was never so happy to see three inches
[44:58] of snow fall in my life
[45:01] but i realized something wednesday god
[45:03] didn't want me to take the pressure off
[45:05] yet because these things are good for us
[45:08] friends
[45:10] we've got to get to the place where
[45:11] we're going to be really honest with
[45:13] ourselves
[45:14] and ask hard questions and not go to
[45:17] some man to tell us this or that or this
[45:18] or that
[45:19] but ask god god this is what was said
[45:21] what what do you want me to do right now
[45:24] we've got to get to desperation we got
[45:26] to get to the lord we got to
[45:28] we you know what i'm not going to spell
[45:30] it out i have no desire to be a garment
[45:32] police i don't care
[45:34] i honestly i those things that you know
[45:37] if something's
[45:38] obviously wrong and causing a problem
[45:39] that's one thing but but
[45:41] don't ask me a bunch of questions
[45:42] because i'm going to do what brother
[45:44] branham did
[45:44] i'm going to go around the cowshed as
[45:46] many times as i can to not answer your
[45:47] question
[45:49] because if you look at asking questions
[45:51] is it all right to wear deodorant can a
[45:52] woman shave her legs
[45:54] can i dye hair can i be a hairdresser
[45:56] blah blah blah all these other things
[45:58] it's amazing how often he doesn't answer
[46:00] the question
[46:02] if you go i've read those questions and
[46:04] i've gone through and read i'm waiting
[46:05] for the answer waiting for the answer
[46:07] waiting for the answer and you get to
[46:08] then he goes to the next question like
[46:09] how can you go to the next question
[46:11] you didn't answer the question
[46:14] because brother branham didn't want to
[46:16] be your holy ghost
[46:17] [Applause]
[46:18] and he didn't want to take god's place
[46:22] and so i'm not here to answer all your
[46:24] questions
[46:25] i told you what he told me to tell you
[46:27] and i did it the way he told me to say
[46:28] it
[46:30] but don't ask me a bunch of questions
[46:31] from here on out because i'm going to do
[46:32] the best i can not to answer your
[46:34] questions
[46:36] unless there's something specific and i
[46:38] feel the lord to answer it
[46:39] i'm going to try to not get in between
[46:42] you and your husband
[46:45] that's never my intention that's never
[46:47] my goal and i'm too tired for that
[46:50] i don't need to answer all the questions
[46:52] and i don't need to call me you to call
[46:54] me every time you're getting ready to go
[46:55] somewhere
[46:58] or you're in the middle of kohl's and i
[46:59] don't know let's call brother chad
[47:01] please don't don't send me pictures is
[47:03] this okay
[47:05] i won't answer because i'm not
[47:09] that's not what god called me i i as a
[47:11] shepherd
[47:12] got a message from god and i delivered
[47:14] it
[47:16] and it put people under tension it put
[47:18] people under pressure
[47:20] and that's exactly what he wanted and he
[47:23] wanted it not to be lifted wednesday he
[47:25] wanted to go for a week because that pot
[47:26] had to cook just a little bit longer
[47:28] so that we can ask ourselves honest
[47:30] questions hard questions
[47:32] and be real we got to get
[47:35] real amen we can't keep going and we
[47:38] can't keep
[47:40] walking the way we've walked in the past
[47:42] assuming that it's okay to walk that way
[47:44] today
[47:47] please don't if if i had just
[47:52] don't look to yesterday
[47:56] and expect that that's okay for today
[48:01] now yesterday may have been okay
[48:04] and it might be okay for today i'm not
[48:06] saying yesterday was wrong
[48:09] but we've got to get to a place where
[48:11] god can lead his children
[48:13] by his desire by his purpose his way
[48:17] and that we can grow to what he wants
[48:19] amen we can be a perfect display
[48:21] of what he wants what i know for sure is
[48:24] god wants a clean
[48:25] holy bride he wants her sanctified
[48:30] separated from the world clean and holy
[48:34] that i know for sure and god
[48:38] wants us to not just accept what has
[48:41] always been
[48:43] he's trying to break us from that
[48:44] friends i don't know how many times he's
[48:46] led me to preach that but he's trying to
[48:49] break
[48:49] that what was is okay for now it may not
[48:53] be
[48:55] man as we grow up and mature your own
[48:57] children things that was fine
[48:59] one day is not fine the next day
[49:03] so we have to be able to grow up in
[49:05] christ and we have to take the
[49:07] leadership of the holy ghost
[49:08] individually in our lives and we have to
[49:11] be able to follow the spirit of god
[49:15] and we have to be honest with ourselves
[49:18] because so many times we're not really
[49:19] honest with ourselves and we don't
[49:21] really pray in an honest way
[49:24] sometimes we'll pray and we pray about
[49:27] something
[49:29] because we ought to pray about it
[49:32] but we've already determined in our mind
[49:34] what we want the answer to be
[49:39] man that sounds familiar doesn't it
[49:42] we've already gotten our mind what we
[49:44] would like the answer to be
[49:46] but we pray about it because we're
[49:47] supposed to pray about it
[49:49] and then we go do what we already wanted
[49:51] to do anyways and we said we prayed
[49:52] about it
[49:56] that's happened to me the reason i can
[50:00] share that so accurately is not because
[50:01] i'm in your brain right now i'm in mine
[50:08] you see we've got to be honest
[50:12] there's still too much self in our midst
[50:17] there's too much selfish desires there's
[50:19] too much
[50:20] wants there's too much pride there's too
[50:22] many ideas
[50:24] our own ideas
[50:28] it's god wants it gone
[50:32] and he's gonna take it by degrees one
[50:34] experience after another he's gonna wash
[50:36] it out and wash it out and wash it out
[50:38] because he wants total absolute
[50:42] control and we got to die
[50:46] and then die again and then die some
[50:48] more
[50:50] praise be to god god wants control
[50:55] he is absolutely
[50:58] guiding us to where he wants us to be
[51:03] but we've got to be tuned in to what
[51:05] he's doing
[51:07] it's too easy to get offended at what we
[51:09] hear preached
[51:12] instead of be honest with what we heard
[51:14] preach
[51:17] instead of honestly looking at ourselves
[51:20] sometimes the knee-jerk reaction is an
[51:22] offense and put up a wall
[51:23] and and sometimes i wonder why are we so
[51:26] offended and why are we so defensive
[51:28] if you know you're right and you know
[51:29] everything's okay
[51:31] where is the defense and where is the
[51:33] anger coming from
[51:35] because if you know for sure you're fine
[51:37] let the man talk
[51:41] i mean if you're absolutely confident
[51:43] that what you're doing is the will of
[51:44] god
[51:44] and you've got no conviction in your
[51:47] heart that it's wrong
[51:48] and no problem then it's okay just let
[51:51] the man talk
[51:52] and and just just be attentive and be
[51:54] kind
[51:55] and say god i hey if i'm wrong correct
[51:58] me but i still feel like this is what
[51:59] you want me to do lord
[52:01] that's okay that's how we want everybody
[52:03] to walk
[52:05] but when that resentment flares up and
[52:08] that anger comes up and we build a stone
[52:10] wall
[52:11] and sometimes i wonder are we really
[52:13] confident that what we're doing is right
[52:15] are we angry because the man mentioned
[52:17] it
[52:20] are we upset because he said it
[52:23] sometimes i think that's the case i wish
[52:25] you just wouldn't harp on that
[52:27] why why do you wish you wouldn't harp on
[52:31] that
[52:31] it's because it's a vice or a stronghold
[52:34] for some of us
[52:35] and and we're having a hard time giving
[52:37] it up
[52:38] and we would rather not hear it again
[52:40] than have to face it again
[52:43] some of these things we just got to
[52:44] strips ourselves down and face it and
[52:46] say god
[52:46] you've got to tell me the truth you've
[52:48] got to tell me what do you want from me
[52:50] right now
[52:54] praise be to god god's going to have a
[52:57] mighty army
[52:58] she's going to be invincible and what's
[53:01] he doing right now
[53:02] he's preparing her drilling her
[53:07] amen you go to boot camp and i've never
[53:10] been and i have no desire to go
[53:13] i heard about what went on there and i
[53:15] said that's not the path god has for me
[53:20] but they scream at you and get you to
[53:23] conform
[53:25] and all sudden it's make your bed it's
[53:28] not good enough tear it apart
[53:29] make it again polish the boots that's
[53:32] not going to posture again
[53:33] tear down that rifle blah blah blah blah
[53:35] blah blah blah blah blah
[53:36] and you can be i mean they they
[53:39] terrorize
[53:40] these men with all of this silly stuff
[53:43] march you're out of step march again
[53:44] mark
[53:45] we're going to go 10 miles now kill you
[53:46] get it right
[53:49] it's never about the straightness of the
[53:52] sheets
[53:54] do you understand the straightness of
[53:56] the sheets don't matter
[53:59] it's a disciplined army that matters
[54:02] it's being able to take commandment
[54:04] it's being able to follow orders because
[54:06] this guy
[54:07] who can't make his bed when he's told to
[54:09] make his bed
[54:10] is going to have a missile launcher
[54:14] and the capacity to kill dozens of
[54:17] people
[54:18] every time he pulls the trigger and if
[54:20] he can't follow
[54:21] these orders we're not giving him the
[54:23] missile
[54:25] if he doesn't go if he doesn't if he
[54:27] doesn't get it all right
[54:29] he doesn't get to fly the plane
[54:32] you don't want the bad recruit the one
[54:34] who never listened the one who never got
[54:36] it right
[54:36] and the one who was always daydreaming
[54:38] when they were giving out orders
[54:39] he's not the one in nuclear command that
[54:41] gets to flip the switch and push the
[54:43] button to launch the bomb
[54:45] because he might have been daydreaming
[54:47] when you gave the orders
[54:52] this bride has within her
[54:56] more power than we could ever imagine
[55:00] [Music]
[55:02] it's not a light thing this is a heavy
[55:05] thing
[55:07] and it's going to get heavier
[55:13] elisha had the power to call she bears
[55:20] and because of his office and because of
[55:22] the power of god gave him an authority
[55:24] he called the she-bears and they come
[55:25] and they killed 40 children 42
[55:28] whatever it was and brother bennett said
[55:30] that wasn't the spirit of christ
[55:32] that was the spirit of elisha
[55:38] see god is given power but he wants it
[55:41] under control
[55:44] it's not about the sheets it's not about
[55:46] the boots
[55:48] it's not about the necklace are you
[55:51] understanding
[55:53] it's about preeminence now i'm not
[55:56] saying that what i said was wrong what i
[55:58] said was spot on right i'm not taking
[56:02] back anything i said it was the truth
[56:04] and it's what god told me to say
[56:07] all the other little questions you've
[56:09] got to ask the lord
[56:11] there's plenty of room there if you just
[56:14] ask the lord
[56:16] but what i'm saying and i'm not saying
[56:18] god doesn't care about what we wear he
[56:19] cares
[56:20] he wants a clean looking bride he cares
[56:23] about how we dress
[56:24] he cares about what we put her on he
[56:26] cares about adornment he cares about our
[56:28] hair he cares about our speech he cares
[56:30] about all of it
[56:31] so i'm not saying he doesn't care but
[56:33] i'm telling you the big deal isn't the
[56:35] necklace
[56:37] the big deal is preeminence
[56:40] can we obey
[56:43] the voice of the lord can we walk the
[56:46] way he wants us to walk
[56:48] can we be real can we be honest with
[56:51] ourselves
[56:52] and can we be honest before god and can
[56:55] we let god
[56:56] break us down and
[56:59] pull out of our hands something we
[57:01] wanted to hold on to
[57:04] are we willing to let him break it down
[57:07] and take away something that we we still
[57:11] wanted to hold
[57:15] he's going to have an army the most
[57:18] powerful army that has ever marched this
[57:20] earth
[57:21] she's here she's being prepared
[57:26] fighting a lot of battles this is a
[57:28] still a preparation
[57:30] phase everything we've been fighting is
[57:32] preparation
[57:35] all the trials and tribulation that god
[57:36] has allowed to come our way
[57:38] is still preparation because there's a
[57:41] great showdown coming
[57:43] there's a great final battle coming when
[57:46] two opposing forces are going to face
[57:48] off
[57:49] and god is going to have complete
[57:52] victory but he's going to do it through
[57:55] you and i
[57:56] as surrendered vessels
[58:02] are we able to obey are we able to ask
[58:05] the hard questions
[58:08] are we able to listen
[58:13] and then go home and say god you've got
[58:15] to tell me what you want
[58:18] help me to die lord show me exactly what
[58:20] you want
[58:22] you know what we don't want we don't
[58:24] want overreaction we don't want our
[58:26] reaction just to the desires of a human
[58:30] being to a man
[58:32] but god has chosen man to preach the
[58:35] gospel
[58:37] and we want to hear from god and go home
[58:39] and talk to god
[58:41] and say god break me down show me your
[58:44] word
[58:45] show me the truth and we got to let
[58:48] reasoning
[58:48] go out of our minds
[58:52] you have to understand the ministry
[58:55] gifts
[58:57] the gift is not the man
[59:02] we can understand this the gift is not
[59:04] the man
[59:06] the the fifo ministry is the ministry of
[59:09] jesus christ
[59:12] we understand that it's the ministry of
[59:15] christ
[59:17] in a man and the man can make mistakes
[59:23] it's not the man it's the ministry of
[59:26] christ
[59:26] in the man and god so
[59:30] molds the two together that he's going
[59:33] to use
[59:33] that gift with that man's temperament
[59:38] and personality because that's the way
[59:41] he wants to do it
[59:45] praise god it gets closer than we ever
[59:48] thought
[59:49] it gets to the point this gets really
[59:51] really real
[59:53] because we see the man we see the
[59:55] temperament
[59:56] but the gift inside is not the man
[1:00:00] the gift inside is the ministry of jesus
[1:00:03] christ
[1:00:06] it's one of the methods he's chose to
[1:00:07] speak to us in this day
[1:00:10] we've got to be careful that we're
[1:00:11] listening and we don't just
[1:00:13] take parts and leave parts and take
[1:00:15] parts and leave parts
[1:00:16] and if there's parts that we're sure are
[1:00:18] wrong that's fine if there's something
[1:00:20] can be said wrong that's
[1:00:21] possible it's possible every service for
[1:00:23] something to be said wrong
[1:00:26] see how see how close this is that's
[1:00:29] why we've got to be led by the spirit of
[1:00:32] god
[1:00:33] we have to have our own relationship
[1:00:34] with god we have to know
[1:00:36] that's of the lord because i have a
[1:00:37] witness in my heart and you have to say
[1:00:39] ouch that hurts but that's god
[1:00:44] or you have that little warning buzz
[1:00:45] that goes off and say that wasn't the
[1:00:47] message
[1:00:49] it got to have those things it's got to
[1:00:52] be
[1:00:53] individual we've got to know where we
[1:00:55] stand we've got to know what's god
[1:00:57] amen we've got to go know how god talks
[1:00:59] and we got to listen that way but
[1:01:00] understanding the flesh is flesh
[1:01:03] susceptible amen it's susceptible to all
[1:01:05] kinds of failure
[1:01:06] but the gift is jesus christ
[1:01:10] coming through a vessel
[1:01:13] so many times during the preaching
[1:01:17] that you see a minister pull out a gun
[1:01:21] i love this analogy you see him pull out
[1:01:24] a gun
[1:01:26] and he points it right at you i'm going
[1:01:29] to point down the middle because i don't
[1:01:30] want to point out
[1:01:33] take note i'm not pointing at brian
[1:01:39] and you see it line up to you
[1:01:42] and you see him squint his eyes and you
[1:01:45] see him pull the trigger and you hear
[1:01:46] the bang
[1:01:47] you say i can't believe that man just
[1:01:49] shot me
[1:01:51] you don't realize he's shooting the
[1:01:52] devil off your left shoulder
[1:01:55] it has nothing to do with you
[1:02:00] it's nothing under the anointing amen
[1:02:03] don't even see you it's not about people
[1:02:05] it's spirits
[1:02:07] a true gift under a true anointing is
[1:02:10] chasing down spirits
[1:02:11] and sometimes it comes so close to home
[1:02:14] that you say
[1:02:15] somebody told him i've been ratted on
[1:02:17] he's coming after me
[1:02:18] and he shouldn't use the pulpit that way
[1:02:24] but a true anointing and a true gift it
[1:02:26] has nothing to do with you as a person
[1:02:29] amen it's that spirit that's trying to
[1:02:30] influence you it's that wrong idea
[1:02:32] that's hanging over you
[1:02:34] amen and he's coming right after but
[1:02:35] it's so precisely accurate
[1:02:38] amen and it's it's it's discernment in
[1:02:40] the pulpit
[1:02:42] how many of you in the last couple years
[1:02:43] have experienced discernment in the
[1:02:45] pulpit
[1:02:46] to where you had to go ask somebody did
[1:02:47] you tell him what i said
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:51] that's the ministry of jesus christ that
[1:02:54] man can't do that
[1:02:56] but so many times when he steps on our
[1:02:58] toes or he talks about the thing we
[1:03:00] don't want him to talk about or we feel
[1:03:01] like it's too harsh
[1:03:02] or it looks like he's shooting my friend
[1:03:04] over there on the other side of the
[1:03:05] church
[1:03:07] then all of a sudden we flare up
[1:03:09] resistance comes amen and resentment
[1:03:14] comes
[1:03:16] now that doesn't mean everything that's
[1:03:18] ever happened in the pulpits correct
[1:03:21] doesn't mean things shouldn't be correct
[1:03:22] it can't be wrong please don't go one
[1:03:24] side or the other with me stay with me
[1:03:26] in the middle of this
[1:03:29] but sometimes the resentment comes
[1:03:30] because we don't understand what was
[1:03:31] just happening
[1:03:33] i sit at a vantage point that most of
[1:03:35] you don't get to sit at and and
[1:03:37] everybody not everybody but a lot of
[1:03:39] people have spiritual experiences they
[1:03:40] come and share with me
[1:03:41] and i get to talk to the ministers and i
[1:03:43] know sometimes the story here
[1:03:45] and i hear what's being said here and i
[1:03:48] know
[1:03:49] that man has no clue what's happening
[1:03:54] but it's a hard sell to convince you he
[1:03:56] doesn't know
[1:04:01] and we should expect more of that
[1:04:05] not less if the word's picking up if the
[1:04:08] ministry is picking up if revelation is
[1:04:10] picking up
[1:04:11] we should get more of that not
[1:04:14] less of that
[1:04:17] brother said the days of ananias and
[1:04:19] sapphira will come back i'm telling you
[1:04:21] they're here
[1:04:23] they are already here the ministry of
[1:04:25] the word is
[1:04:26] already calling things out already
[1:04:28] nailing it to the wall
[1:04:30] and people are getting offended
[1:04:34] because they think that man heard about
[1:04:36] me and is coming after me
[1:04:38] now that's happened in the past and that
[1:04:40] can happen in the future
[1:04:42] but i'm just saying be careful be really
[1:04:46] really careful
[1:04:49] because you may be fighting god
[1:04:52] and you may be resisting god
[1:04:56] god is trying to get his army
[1:04:59] ready he's trying to shave the world off
[1:05:02] of us
[1:05:03] he's trying to break us of our vices
[1:05:06] break us
[1:05:06] of of of of our habits break us of wrong
[1:05:10] ideas
[1:05:10] break us of tradition break us of
[1:05:13] complexes he's trying to break it all
[1:05:17] and sometimes it shapes pretty close
[1:05:20] but that's how accurate the word of god
[1:05:23] is it's a discerner
[1:05:25] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:05:29] if we can't see that in the pulpit then
[1:05:31] i want another word
[1:05:34] because that's what the word's supposed
[1:05:36] to do
[1:05:37] and i'm telling you it's doing it your
[1:05:39] conversation
[1:05:41] what you talked about your question it's
[1:05:43] being answered here
[1:05:45] the things you talked about are being
[1:05:47] discussed here amen the problems that
[1:05:49] you've had they're coming out here
[1:05:52] is that true
[1:05:56] i've had people explain stuff to me that
[1:05:58] happened during the service
[1:05:59] and i've blushed
[1:06:03] they said this happened and this
[1:06:05] happened this person said this and you
[1:06:07] got in the pulpit and you said that and
[1:06:08] i
[1:06:08] blushed because i never would have said
[1:06:12] it had i known
[1:06:14] never in a million years would i have
[1:06:16] said that if i had actually known that
[1:06:18] was the case
[1:06:21] because i don't like that and i don't
[1:06:24] want to do that
[1:06:27] but i'll tell you something else that
[1:06:28] can happen that we got to be careful of
[1:06:34] when god is bringing us his word
[1:06:37] it's coming under the anointing and
[1:06:39] inspiration
[1:06:42] this is where god's checked me recently
[1:06:45] really corrected me hard
[1:06:49] i'll say things and other ministers will
[1:06:51] say things in a way i would never say it
[1:06:53] if i was sitting down talking to one
[1:06:55] person
[1:06:56] say it straight say it flat say it harsh
[1:06:58] even
[1:07:00] but then somebody will come to me
[1:07:02] afterwards or
[1:07:03] days later or monthly brother chad you
[1:07:05] said this and that and it
[1:07:07] and what do you really mean that oh no
[1:07:09] no it's okay
[1:07:10] and i start to soften things
[1:07:14] because that's my human nature that i
[1:07:17] don't want anybody to suffer
[1:07:18] and i don't want it to be too hard and
[1:07:20] i'll start to soften things
[1:07:22] and god has given a judgment and god has
[1:07:25] given a rebuke
[1:07:26] and i'm over here taking it away because
[1:07:29] that's my human nature
[1:07:32] and i say god forgive me god forgive me
[1:07:36] i don't ever want to do that again i
[1:07:39] want what god says to stand
[1:07:41] and i've got to have more confidence in
[1:07:43] what he's speaking through the gift than
[1:07:44] i've had in the past
[1:07:45] because hey it's tough for me because
[1:07:47] i'm the man
[1:07:48] and i know my faults and i know my
[1:07:50] failures and i know how many times i say
[1:07:52] something wrong
[1:07:53] and i know how many times i changed my
[1:07:54] mind on an issue
[1:07:57] they understand that's me brother chad
[1:08:02] but i also know that the gift works
[1:08:04] perfect
[1:08:06] and that's not me that's not brother
[1:08:09] chad and sometimes
[1:08:10] i have a hard time
[1:08:13] i have a hard time just letting it stand
[1:08:16] the way it was said
[1:08:19] my human nature if you come and ask me
[1:08:21] i'll start to soften everything
[1:08:24] say it's okay it's okay don't get upset
[1:08:28] i've got to be careful and if i got to
[1:08:31] be careful we all got to be careful
[1:08:37] god is good friends
[1:08:40] you know we had a special that was sung
[1:08:43] two two sundays back and it was
[1:08:46] beautiful
[1:08:47] and i enjoyed the special and i enjoyed
[1:08:49] the people are saying it
[1:08:50] and i enjoyed the way it was saying it
[1:08:52] was beautifully done it was done holy
[1:08:54] and it was done reverent
[1:08:56] but later we found out that it came from
[1:08:59] the contemporary christian music world
[1:09:02] and then my heart was smote
[1:09:05] you know because god told us not to go
[1:09:07] there
[1:09:09] and so i had an opportunity to talk to
[1:09:11] the individuals that were involved and
[1:09:12] we're all of the same understanding we
[1:09:13] all realize
[1:09:15] that that shouldn't have been done and
[1:09:17] then we won't do it in the future god
[1:09:19] hasn't changed his
[1:09:20] mind what he told us in august of 2017
[1:09:24] when we did the music thing he means it
[1:09:26] that was not me that come from the lord
[1:09:29] and i have to stay true to what he did
[1:09:32] there
[1:09:33] and so we can't go back and pull from
[1:09:35] that contemporary stuff
[1:09:37] god doesn't want us to do it it's not
[1:09:39] for us other people may be able to but
[1:09:41] god's already spoken to us it's not for
[1:09:42] us
[1:09:45] but you know when you look at the tree
[1:09:47] of knowledge of good and evil
[1:09:50] and this is how god spoke to me on this
[1:09:52] issue
[1:09:54] god said it's good and
[1:09:57] evil and if god says it's good
[1:10:02] then it's actually good it's not kind of
[1:10:04] good or partially good
[1:10:06] if it's good if god said it's good it's
[1:10:08] good
[1:10:09] and if god said it's evil it's evil
[1:10:13] and so you can go to some of these
[1:10:15] things and you can find good
[1:10:19] and where did eve get deceived when when
[1:10:22] serpents spoke to her
[1:10:23] god had already spoke to adam adam had
[1:10:25] already spoke to eve
[1:10:26] not to eat not to partake of that tree
[1:10:30] but when the server began to question
[1:10:31] her she began to look at the tree with
[1:10:34] reasoning
[1:10:36] and it was pleasant to the eyes good for
[1:10:39] food
[1:10:40] and desirable to make one wise
[1:10:44] she couldn't find anything wrong with
[1:10:47] the tree
[1:10:50] the things she couldn't find anything
[1:10:53] wrong with the tree
[1:10:55] but god had already said don't partake
[1:10:58] of it
[1:11:00] and with reasoning she began to look
[1:11:03] we can pull a song out of that industry
[1:11:05] and we can look at it
[1:11:07] and it doesn't have a wrong beat it's
[1:11:08] not centrally done and
[1:11:11] it can look good but god said it's a
[1:11:15] mixed tree
[1:11:18] it's good and evil one bite may be good
[1:11:22] the next bite may be evil
[1:11:24] it could bring wrong spirits could bring
[1:11:27] wrong understanding so for us
[1:11:31] god said leave the tree alone
[1:11:35] and we have to trust what he told us
[1:11:38] and not use reasoning to try to reason
[1:11:42] it out
[1:11:42] just take what he said and if we just
[1:11:45] take what he says and trust him
[1:11:47] god will fulfill his promise god will
[1:11:49] keep us god will lead us
[1:11:50] god will bless us but we don't
[1:11:53] we don't need and this is everything
[1:11:55] brother branham told us
[1:11:57] everything he told us things to stay
[1:11:59] away from things to not partake in
[1:12:01] things like this and that brother venom
[1:12:03] said you shouldn't have a tv in your
[1:12:04] house
[1:12:04] he said if you had one he said if i had
[1:12:06] one i blow it out with a shotgun you
[1:12:07] better too
[1:12:11] we can look at that with reasoning and
[1:12:12] say well i don't have cable i only have
[1:12:14] these channels and
[1:12:15] don't inject any reasoning just listen
[1:12:19] there comes the time of god speaking to
[1:12:21] us and we want to go through and start
[1:12:22] the list of reasoning reasoning
[1:12:24] reasoning reasoning
[1:12:25] reasoning has caused the initial fall
[1:12:27] and reasoning will cause every fall
[1:12:30] we don't want to reason with god we want
[1:12:32] to be led by the spirit of god
[1:12:36] amen everything the prophet said
[1:12:38] everything the word of god says
[1:12:40] everything that comes off the tree of
[1:12:42] knowledge of good and evil you can find
[1:12:44] good in it and be deceived by the good
[1:12:46] amen but there's evil on that tree too
[1:12:48] and it's a mixture and god doesn't want
[1:12:50] us going to the mixture
[1:12:52] to pull he's got a fountain of living
[1:12:54] water he's the tree of life
[1:12:55] there's no evil there's no death there's
[1:12:57] nothing mixed in with that tree
[1:13:00] and he wanted them to partake of the
[1:13:01] tree of life not the tree of good and
[1:13:04] evil
[1:13:04] and he wants the same thing for us he
[1:13:06] wants us to stay true to his word
[1:13:08] and he wants us to stray true to what
[1:13:10] he's told us
[1:13:13] and that's a hard thing for me to say
[1:13:15] because i was the one who said it
[1:13:18] my initial reaction to everything is
[1:13:20] yeah it's probably okay
[1:13:22] anybody who knows me knows that's my
[1:13:23] initial reaction it's not a big deal
[1:13:25] it's probably okay
[1:13:28] but then god comes along and says no it
[1:13:30] is a big deal
[1:13:32] and we have to be obedient to him
[1:13:36] i'll tell you i've had the last week has
[1:13:39] been a
[1:13:40] supernatural week for me there's been so
[1:13:43] many supernatural things happen
[1:13:46] but it's just shocking but what i'm
[1:13:48] realizing is this intensity is picking
[1:13:50] up
[1:13:53] and god has come along and corrected me
[1:13:55] and corrected other things twice this
[1:13:57] week
[1:13:58] and when he corrected it he corrected it
[1:14:00] perfect out of his word
[1:14:02] and when he brought the correction it
[1:14:04] was raw and it was true
[1:14:06] and nobody was hiding
[1:14:10] and i'm in prayer and all of a sudden it
[1:14:12] just drops like a lightning
[1:14:14] bolt and it's perfect all of a sudden it
[1:14:16] puts me under tension
[1:14:19] because i realize he's not letting us
[1:14:22] play on the playground
[1:14:23] anymore we're not allowed to be little
[1:14:27] kids
[1:14:28] anymore god is requiring
[1:14:32] that we act like full-grown mature
[1:14:35] members of his bride the days of being
[1:14:37] little kids and skipping around
[1:14:39] those days are over god is going to
[1:14:43] speak to us
[1:14:43] he's going to give us his word and he's
[1:14:46] going to expect
[1:14:47] us to keep it the days of being patted
[1:14:50] along and turning a blind eye or
[1:14:52] are reminding us 10 or 12 times those
[1:14:55] days are over friends i'm telling you
[1:14:57] right now those days are over
[1:14:59] god is expecting us to catch what's
[1:15:02] going on
[1:15:03] and he's expecting us to act like mature
[1:15:05] believers
[1:15:07] the intensity is increasing i've had a
[1:15:10] few experiences this week that has got
[1:15:11] me under so much
[1:15:13] tension so much tension
[1:15:16] god has come and spoke in a supernatural
[1:15:18] way to me three times in the last week
[1:15:20] since last saturday three times
[1:15:24] and each time it breaks me to nothing
[1:15:27] because i realize i have no idea what
[1:15:30] i'm doing
[1:15:31] and i'm gonna mess this whole thing up
[1:15:35] i'm just a person i'm just a human being
[1:15:38] i'm just a man and i make mistakes every
[1:15:41] single day
[1:15:42] and god comes down in such a
[1:15:44] supernatural way and he speaks something
[1:15:46] so exactly spot
[1:15:47] on that all of a sudden i begin to
[1:15:50] tremble because
[1:15:51] all i can do as a man is mess it up all
[1:15:54] i can do is ruin it
[1:15:55] and he's expecting amen he's expecting
[1:16:00] obedience and he's expecting
[1:16:03] a mature response and it's taking my
[1:16:06] breath away
[1:16:09] things are changing friends we're not
[1:16:11] little kids anymore
[1:16:13] it's not coming for a baby bride
[1:16:18] it's going to be all members here and
[1:16:20] everybody mature
[1:16:23] we're coming to a mature face
[1:16:28] let's go to hebrews chapter 12.
[1:16:44] hebrews 12 and 1.
[1:16:48] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:16:50] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:16:52] let us lay aside every weight in the sin
[1:16:54] which does so easily beset us
[1:16:56] and let us run with patience the race
[1:16:58] that is set before us
[1:17:00] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:17:02] finisher of our faith
[1:17:04] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:17:05] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:17:08] and has set down at the right hand of
[1:17:09] the throne of god
[1:17:11] for consider him that endured such
[1:17:13] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:17:16] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[1:17:17] mind we have not resisted under blood
[1:17:20] striving against sin
[1:17:21] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:17:23] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:17:25] my son
[1:17:25] despise not thou the chastening of the
[1:17:27] lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:17:29] him
[1:17:30] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:17:32] and scourgeth every son
[1:17:33] whom he receiveth if ye endure
[1:17:36] chastening god dealeth with you as with
[1:17:38] the sons
[1:17:39] for what son is he whom the father
[1:17:41] chasteneth not
[1:17:43] but if you be without chastisement we're
[1:17:44] of all our partakers
[1:17:46] then are you bastards and not sons
[1:17:49] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:17:50] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:17:52] them reverence
[1:17:53] shall we not much rather be in
[1:17:54] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:17:56] and live
[1:17:57] for they verily for a few days chasing
[1:17:59] us after their own pleasure
[1:18:01] but he for our prophet that we might be
[1:18:03] partakers of his holiness
[1:18:05] now no chastening for the presence
[1:18:07] seemeth to be joyous
[1:18:08] but grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:18:10] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[1:18:12] righteousness unto them
[1:18:14] which are exercised thereby wherefore
[1:18:17] lift up the hands which hang
[1:18:18] down in the feeble knees and make
[1:18:21] straight paths for your feet lest that
[1:18:22] which is lame be turned out of the way
[1:18:24] but let it rather be healed follow peace
[1:18:27] with all men
[1:18:28] and holiness without which no man shall
[1:18:30] see the lord
[1:18:31] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:18:33] the grace of god lest any root of
[1:18:35] bitterness springing up trouble you
[1:18:37] and thereby many be defiled lest there
[1:18:40] be any fornicator or profane
[1:18:42] person as esau who for one morsel meet
[1:18:45] sold his birthright
[1:18:48] let's look at that scripture lest there
[1:18:50] be any fornicator profane
[1:18:52] person as esau he's talking about
[1:18:54] spiritually
[1:18:56] not profane or fornicator naturally
[1:18:58] spiritually
[1:18:59] who is esau for one morsel of me
[1:19:02] because esau valued his natural life
[1:19:05] more than his spiritual heritage
[1:19:09] he said what is the what does the
[1:19:11] inheritance mean to me what does the
[1:19:12] birthright mean to me if i'm dead
[1:19:16] brother it means everything
[1:19:19] that's your position your position is
[1:19:22] more important than your life
[1:19:24] your position is more important than
[1:19:25] your job your position in christ your
[1:19:27] birthright
[1:19:28] is more important than your family it's
[1:19:31] more important than your spouse
[1:19:35] esau wanted to save his life so he was
[1:19:37] willing to give up his birthright
[1:19:39] that made him profane and a fornicator
[1:19:42] we've got to be willing to give up
[1:19:44] everything natural to keep our birth
[1:19:46] right
[1:19:49] for you know how that afterward when he
[1:19:51] would have inherited the blessing he was
[1:19:52] rejected
[1:19:53] for he found no place of repentance
[1:19:55] though he sought it carefully
[1:19:56] with tears god intends for
[1:20:00] us to be children and he corrects
[1:20:04] us and he guides us because he knows
[1:20:06] what's coming next
[1:20:09] so many times you know we as an assembly
[1:20:13] have gone through so many things that
[1:20:15] god has just raked
[1:20:16] raked out of us he come and raked
[1:20:20] music out of us he come and talked about
[1:20:22] our marital relationships
[1:20:24] he come now and starts talking about the
[1:20:26] clothes and the dress and dormant
[1:20:28] and it's almost like you can't even get
[1:20:30] your footing before the next wave comes
[1:20:32] does anybody feel that way i hope i'm
[1:20:34] not the only one
[1:20:37] but but when things begin to change
[1:20:41] they're going to change so fast it'll
[1:20:42] take your breath away
[1:20:45] and everything god is doing is because
[1:20:47] he knows what comes
[1:20:48] next he wants us prepared
[1:20:52] and he's shaving the world away he's
[1:20:54] shaving wrong influences away
[1:20:56] he's shaving wrong spirits away he's
[1:20:59] getting
[1:21:00] his army prepared he's drilling us
[1:21:03] he's you make the bed again it's not
[1:21:06] right
[1:21:06] make it again what does it matter make
[1:21:09] it again
[1:21:11] there's a scuff on your boots polish
[1:21:12] them again what's he doing
[1:21:14] this isn't punishment friends this is
[1:21:15] preparation
[1:21:17] this isn't hard this is wonderful this
[1:21:19] is this is showing us where we're going
[1:21:23] if we look at where he's brought us from
[1:21:25] in the last few years it's showing us
[1:21:27] where we're going
[1:21:28] we're going to spiritual heights that
[1:21:29] we've never experienced before
[1:21:31] we're going into spiritual realms with
[1:21:33] manifestations of power
[1:21:34] that we've never seen before
[1:21:37] but he's not going he's not going
[1:21:41] to move us any higher spiritual power
[1:21:44] until he has control over us
[1:21:51] he said watchmen what of the night 1960
[1:21:54] in the old days when they made gold the
[1:21:56] beater beat the gold and beat the dross
[1:21:58] out
[1:21:58] until he seen his own reflection then he
[1:22:00] knowed all the dross was out of the gold
[1:22:02] sometimes you say i preached too hard
[1:22:04] i've tear down people
[1:22:06] a man told me not long ago said you're
[1:22:08] going to ruin your ministry by rebuking
[1:22:10] things the way you do i said let
[1:22:11] somebody else do that i said who's doing
[1:22:14] it
[1:22:14] that's right who's going to do it i said
[1:22:17] it might hurt them a little bit now
[1:22:18] but they'll thank me when the time comes
[1:22:22] how can a man who preaches under the
[1:22:23] inspiration say anything but what the
[1:22:25] holy spirit says to him
[1:22:28] message presuming 1962 them
[1:22:31] uncircumcised egyptians they thought
[1:22:33] we'll just pass right through the sea
[1:22:34] like they did
[1:22:35] and they lost their lives aiken thought
[1:22:38] this little wedge it won't make any
[1:22:39] difference
[1:22:40] the rest of the ladies are cutting their
[1:22:41] hair i'll do the same thing it won't
[1:22:43] make any difference
[1:22:44] but what did it do it never brought
[1:22:47] pleasure to his family
[1:22:48] it brought death to every one of them
[1:22:51] and when we compromise on any
[1:22:52] commandment of god to please the people
[1:22:54] we kill the thing right there one little
[1:22:58] wedge
[1:22:59] one babylonian garment stop the marching
[1:23:01] army brother one thing that we permit
[1:23:03] the church to do that's wrong
[1:23:05] one thing that we don't call out against
[1:23:07] and make the people straighten it up
[1:23:09] it'll stop the march of the church
[1:23:12] they presume you're going on we may be
[1:23:15] in name we may be in numbers
[1:23:16] that ain't what counts that isn't what
[1:23:18] counts it's
[1:23:20] god with us god in us god moving through
[1:23:22] us
[1:23:23] through us his word alive in us
[1:23:26] that's what we want want to make sure
[1:23:29] we're not just going on without him
[1:23:31] but he make sure you know it because
[1:23:32] he'll come in and he'll strip
[1:23:34] something away amen and i don't think
[1:23:36] that any sheep has ever
[1:23:38] enjoyed the process of being sheared i
[1:23:41] watched it in new zealand it looked
[1:23:42] rough
[1:23:43] the sheep was upset about it
[1:23:48] manhandled moved around stripped
[1:23:51] sheared
[1:23:54] but you know what the little sheep felt
[1:23:57] good afterwards
[1:23:59] it was free all that
[1:24:02] was hanging on all that was catching
[1:24:04] sticks and twigs and
[1:24:06] all that extra weight it was free
[1:24:11] sometimes we'll come to a service and
[1:24:13] god will come right down our row
[1:24:15] right to our seat and just start
[1:24:17] unraveling things
[1:24:19] and we make a repentance and start to
[1:24:21] just give it to god and make it right
[1:24:22] and guess what you walk out weepy
[1:24:26] you walk out broken-hearted
[1:24:29] but you feel clean there's some freedom
[1:24:33] that comes
[1:24:33] and god is trying to free us from the
[1:24:35] things of the world he
[1:24:37] doesn't want the influences of the world
[1:24:39] influencing us
[1:24:43] you know one of the one of the main
[1:24:46] things that
[1:24:46] that the one of the main things god
[1:24:48] impressed on my heart and i wanted to
[1:24:49] get across
[1:24:50] last time is so many times things that
[1:24:52] moved to church
[1:24:53] are worldly influences that have come
[1:24:55] into the church and got
[1:24:56] passed amongst us we've got to be super
[1:25:00] vigilant
[1:25:01] friends we've got to keep the world out
[1:25:05] just because it comes from you see
[1:25:07] somebody
[1:25:08] clean and godly doing that doesn't mean
[1:25:10] it's okay to do
[1:25:12] we can't always get our cues for right
[1:25:15] and wrong from the person sitting next
[1:25:16] to us
[1:25:18] we've got to be led by the spirit of god
[1:25:20] we have to
[1:25:21] know and i would say as we move forward
[1:25:23] from the things we talked about that
[1:25:24] sunday as you move forward personally
[1:25:26] make sure you move forward in faith
[1:25:29] knowing that whatever you do is exactly
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:32] don't guess don't assume don't reason
[1:25:36] i'm warning you don't guess don't assume
[1:25:40] and don't reason but if you move forward
[1:25:43] move forward by faith
[1:25:44] knowing that god has spoken to me that
[1:25:46] i'm right i
[1:25:47] know that this is okay just know it
[1:25:51] friends
[1:25:51] just be certain just be absolutely
[1:25:53] certain for too long we've presumed
[1:25:57] too long we've presumed things are okay
[1:25:59] too long we assumed it was okay
[1:26:01] too many times we reasoned and justified
[1:26:04] things in our mind
[1:26:06] because they're doing it or that church
[1:26:08] does it or this brother sister does it
[1:26:09] or that family allows it
[1:26:12] we got to stop doing that we got to come
[1:26:15] back
[1:26:16] to god having preeminence in us
[1:26:20] and it doesn't matter if you're the only
[1:26:22] one who feels like you can't do that
[1:26:24] if god told you not to do it don't you
[1:26:27] do it
[1:26:30] you may look around and everybody else
[1:26:32] can do that but if god told you not to
[1:26:34] do it then you better not do it
[1:26:37] and it doesn't even matter if it's right
[1:26:40] or
[1:26:40] wrong scripturally if he told you not to
[1:26:43] do it you
[1:26:44] better not do it
[1:26:49] amen paul said all things are lawful but
[1:26:51] all things do not edify
[1:26:54] there are some things and there's
[1:26:56] seasons there's times there's influence
[1:26:58] there's reasons sometimes you'll never
[1:27:00] know the reason
[1:27:01] but if god tells you not to do something
[1:27:03] then you better not
[1:27:04] do it don't reason it away because
[1:27:07] somebody showed you a quote
[1:27:09] or somebody else did it or everybody
[1:27:11] else is doing it if god told you not to
[1:27:13] do it
[1:27:14] don't do it god has got to have this
[1:27:17] army trained
[1:27:18] there may come a time you don't have
[1:27:20] anybody else around you to lean on and
[1:27:22] look to for guidance but some things are
[1:27:24] going to happen decisions are going to
[1:27:25] have to be made and it's going to come
[1:27:27] so fast you have to know how to hear
[1:27:29] from god
[1:27:29] and you have to know what is god and
[1:27:30] what isn't god
[1:27:32] that's what he's preparing us for now so
[1:27:35] when he says get out of the house
[1:27:36] you get out of the house
[1:27:40] we told brother branham keep walking he
[1:27:41] kept walking
[1:27:44] his reasoning was saying but i'll miss
[1:27:46] my plane but god said walk
[1:27:51] god wants his bride like that
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:54] that will obey him regard it goes
[1:27:56] against thinking it goes against reason
[1:27:58] it goes against
[1:27:59] everything else i understood but he's
[1:28:01] the one who's leading me and i'm going
[1:28:03] to do it because he said do it
[1:28:05] if he says walk i'm going to walk if he
[1:28:07] said don't go into that building
[1:28:09] don't go into that building if he says
[1:28:10] don't get in that car
[1:28:12] don't get in that car
[1:28:16] we've got to get to obedience we got to
[1:28:18] get to the leadership of the holy ghost
[1:28:20] it's got to be preeminence
[1:28:28] praise god i've watched for years and
[1:28:31] been caught up in myself
[1:28:33] in things that come from the world and
[1:28:35] sweep through a body of believers
[1:28:38] brother branham said you watch somebody
[1:28:39] wear a hat
[1:28:41] especially if it's the pastor's wife and
[1:28:44] everybody else got to get that hat
[1:28:46] somebody said something like that i'm
[1:28:48] not recording it right
[1:28:51] why he says it's matching time he said i
[1:28:54] want my experience to match god's word
[1:28:57] we don't want to be influenced on those
[1:28:58] things
[1:29:00] so many things fashion trends come
[1:29:02] through
[1:29:04] and you see it and it's all sudden just
[1:29:06] like
[1:29:07] we're childish we're childish
[1:29:11] because that's not the way a mature
[1:29:13] believer should be
[1:29:16] we've had things sweep through a fashion
[1:29:18] thing or a fad
[1:29:20] and it's like why does every fat or fads
[1:29:23] in the world
[1:29:24] have any effect on us here there should
[1:29:26] be a separation where
[1:29:28] it doesn't matter what the world's doing
[1:29:30] i want to do what he told me to do
[1:29:31] and i'm not copying the fat in the world
[1:29:34] and i'm not bringing and spreading it
[1:29:35] through the church
[1:29:37] i mean we've all seen the vitamins come
[1:29:39] through
[1:29:42] and everybody was going to be cured of
[1:29:44] everything with these vitamins
[1:29:45] and better yet you're going to be rich
[1:29:47] because you're going to sell them too
[1:29:51] that was immaturity remember juice
[1:29:55] there was a special juice that could
[1:29:58] cure cancer
[1:30:00] we can all laugh because almost every
[1:30:01] one of us drunk something
[1:30:07] cookware and crystalware and
[1:30:10] bags
[1:30:15] and we start using our influence to
[1:30:18] influence people and what we want them
[1:30:20] to be influenced by and not
[1:30:21] influence them in the word we're using
[1:30:25] our
[1:30:25] influence to sell a product to our
[1:30:27] brother and sister
[1:30:29] when we should be gathering to provoke
[1:30:32] one another into love and good works
[1:30:34] see those were childish days but those
[1:30:37] days have got to stop
[1:30:39] we're too easily influenced one person
[1:30:42] doesn't next person does it next
[1:30:44] and not everything's evil not
[1:30:46] everything's bad but it's like why
[1:30:49] why do we all have to copy each other
[1:30:53] why do we all now why is it i'm feeling
[1:30:56] left out if i'm not taking those pills
[1:31:00] those vitamins why is it i feel like the
[1:31:02] odd one if i'm not
[1:31:04] drinking the juice
[1:31:07] see what i'm saying we've all got cotton
[1:31:09] isn't there nobody exempt
[1:31:12] i got the stuff in my house
[1:31:16] right that's not what god wants
[1:31:20] he wants preeminence he wants us to
[1:31:22] follow him
[1:31:23] and him only and follow the word and if
[1:31:25] we influence one another let's provoke
[1:31:27] one another into love and good works
[1:31:30] let's talk about the word let's promote
[1:31:31] the word not a product
[1:31:34] let's promote the word let's get
[1:31:36] together encourage one another
[1:31:39] man i would love testimonies to sweep as
[1:31:41] fast as some fads
[1:31:44] i would love spiritual experiences to
[1:31:46] sweep through the assembly as fast as
[1:31:48] some of these fads have
[1:31:50] but that was in maturity friends god's
[1:31:51] calling us above those things
[1:31:53] we don't want to copy each other we
[1:31:55] don't have to influence each other
[1:31:57] we just need to stay true to what god we
[1:31:59] shouldn't feel the social pressure to go
[1:32:01] along with something
[1:32:03] we shouldn't feel social pressure to all
[1:32:06] we're all doing the same thing
[1:32:08] but it's not the word and it come from
[1:32:10] the world and
[1:32:12] nobody's doing those things now they
[1:32:15] didn't change our lives
[1:32:16] they didn't last they didn't build us up
[1:32:18] spiritually
[1:32:22] we didn't grow spiritually
[1:32:25] all of these things he's those were fine
[1:32:28] then
[1:32:29] but he's calling for something else now
[1:32:32] if we're going to lend our influence to
[1:32:34] one another let's influence one another
[1:32:37] in the things of the word
[1:32:39] and the things of god if we're going to
[1:32:41] promote something that's promote the
[1:32:42] word
[1:32:44] let's build each other up in the word
[1:32:45] let's not let a trend come through or
[1:32:48] or whatever trend it is let the world
[1:32:50] trend
[1:32:51] let's not trend they can trend in
[1:32:54] fashion they can trend in products they
[1:32:56] can trend in
[1:32:57] apps but let's not trend
[1:33:00] let's not follow the pied piper let's
[1:33:03] not do like everybody else does
[1:33:05] let's not be like everybody else is but
[1:33:08] let's stay true to what god what does
[1:33:10] god want me to do
[1:33:11] what does he want me to spend my money
[1:33:13] on what does he want me to spend my time
[1:33:14] on
[1:33:15] god is looking for preeminence
[1:33:18] he's growing us up and he wants us to be
[1:33:21] grown-ups
[1:33:24] we got to be careful that we got to be
[1:33:27] just we got to be vigilant in whatever
[1:33:29] we do god wants us to do
[1:33:32] you know i know saying these things are
[1:33:34] hard things to say i'm guilty
[1:33:36] of it we're all guilty of it
[1:33:39] but but what does god want what is he
[1:33:42] looking for
[1:33:43] what kind of maturity does he want
[1:33:46] what kind of influence should we have on
[1:33:49] one another
[1:33:51] say god grow me up mature me in your way
[1:33:56] i want to be more than what i was in the
[1:33:59] past
[1:34:00] i want to be a mature believer
[1:34:06] wisdom versus faith brother ben said and
[1:34:09] i used to box
[1:34:11] and there was a fellow named here in the
[1:34:12] city the poor fellow drinks very bad now
[1:34:15] one of his boys is one of the police
[1:34:16] force smith george smith
[1:34:18] they call him six second smith he went
[1:34:21] to training
[1:34:22] training me for boxing for before the
[1:34:24] golden glove started
[1:34:26] we was out here at the government and
[1:34:28] that why he was the roughest person i
[1:34:30] ever seen
[1:34:31] he just hit me and i just go winding
[1:34:33] through the air and i come back
[1:34:35] i said you don't have to be so rough
[1:34:36] about it see
[1:34:38] i said you knocked the breath out of me
[1:34:40] he said i tell you billy said
[1:34:42] no matter how well trained you are and
[1:34:44] how much athletic experience you have
[1:34:46] and how strong you are for your size or
[1:34:48] anything like that said
[1:34:49] a lick stops the blood when it hits that
[1:34:52] and he said you might hate me now but
[1:34:54] when you get there in the ring yourself
[1:34:56] said you're gonna appreciate it said
[1:34:58] your body builds up that to come back
[1:35:00] quick
[1:35:00] and if you get hit and just fall over
[1:35:02] and you lay there and take a count but
[1:35:04] if your body is built
[1:35:05] and can stand the licks and then when
[1:35:07] you hit hit it
[1:35:08] hard lick hard lick hits you said then
[1:35:11] when you come
[1:35:12] back quick said back to your feet again
[1:35:14] get knocked out of the ring
[1:35:16] jump back in he had just got through
[1:35:19] knocking me plumb out of the ring he
[1:35:20] said
[1:35:20] you have to just do that see and he
[1:35:23] liked to kill me
[1:35:24] he was about 30 40 pounds heavier than i
[1:35:26] was and he could he was a fighter and i
[1:35:28] was just a student
[1:35:29] so he was almost killing me he said but
[1:35:31] you'll appreciate that when you get in
[1:35:33] the ring
[1:35:34] i found out that was the truth then i've
[1:35:36] heard these sergeants in the army train
[1:35:38] them boys
[1:35:39] rugged they'd hate them sergeants but
[1:35:41] when it come to combat they'd love him
[1:35:43] because of rugged training
[1:35:46] they'd hate him but then they loved him
[1:35:50] that's the way i try to train christians
[1:35:52] don't bob off your hair don't wear
[1:35:54] makeup don't do this
[1:35:55] get it rugged you'll appreciate me when
[1:35:57] i come to the end of the road
[1:35:59] training see getting that training right
[1:36:01] but let's keep right with the word it
[1:36:03] might be rugged
[1:36:04] cut denominational differences to pieces
[1:36:06] but you'll appreciate it when you come
[1:36:08] down to the end of the road
[1:36:09] you stood by the book it
[1:36:12] may seem rough but we'll appreciate it
[1:36:16] it may strip us down it may lay us
[1:36:20] bare it may expose us but we'll
[1:36:22] appreciate it when we can hear from god
[1:36:25] and when everybody goes one way but god
[1:36:27] leads me somewhere else and i realize
[1:36:29] this was the path of safety i'll
[1:36:30] appreciate it then
[1:36:32] when everybody's got one idea but
[1:36:33] there's a warning in my heart going off
[1:36:35] and i don't ignore it this time
[1:36:37] because of what everybody else is doing
[1:36:38] but i listen to the warning in my heart
[1:36:41] and it leads me down the right path i'll
[1:36:43] be thankful then
[1:36:45] when god can strip me of a group thing
[1:36:47] and get me to the individual leadership
[1:36:49] that he wants to have
[1:36:50] amen if it takes taking a little hide
[1:36:53] off amen it's going to be a good thing
[1:36:55] friends
[1:36:56] this individual walk with christ is
[1:36:58] going to be the only thing that's going
[1:37:00] to make it to the end
[1:37:02] amen we may not have the
[1:37:06] privileges we have now we might find
[1:37:09] ourselves separated
[1:37:10] or isolated we're going to need to learn
[1:37:14] how to hear from god
[1:37:18] we're going to have to know what he
[1:37:19] wants us to do
[1:37:26] psalms 144 1 says a psalm of david
[1:37:30] blessed be the lord my strength which
[1:37:32] teacheth my hands to war
[1:37:35] and my fingers to fight
[1:37:38] god is teaching us how to fight
[1:37:41] how to fight the influence of the world
[1:37:44] how to fight
[1:37:44] wrong spirits how to expose traps
[1:37:49] that are right among us god's teaching
[1:37:53] us friends
[1:37:54] everything i'm talking about everything
[1:37:56] that i'm explaining to you
[1:37:58] god is teaching us something there's
[1:38:00] deep spiritual principles here
[1:38:04] and i know it's the truth
[1:38:07] it may hurt today it may have hurt
[1:38:09] sunday
[1:38:10] but these things are going to matter a
[1:38:12] great deal sometime in the future
[1:38:18] let's turn to exodus 13.
[1:38:36] exodus 13 and 17.
[1:38:50] and it came to pass when pharaoh had led
[1:38:52] the people let the people go
[1:38:54] that god led them not through the way
[1:38:57] to the land of the philistines although
[1:38:59] that was near for god said lest
[1:39:01] perventor the people repent when they
[1:39:03] see war
[1:39:04] and they return to egypt but god led the
[1:39:07] people about through the way of the
[1:39:08] wilderness of the red sea
[1:39:10] and the children of israel went up
[1:39:11] harnessed out of the land of egypt
[1:39:14] god was bringing a bunch of slaves
[1:39:19] out of egypt
[1:39:22] and god had to train them to be an army
[1:39:28] god knew that when they crossed over the
[1:39:31] promised land
[1:39:32] into the promised land they were going
[1:39:33] to have to fight for every footstep and
[1:39:35] they have to fight for every inch of the
[1:39:37] way
[1:39:38] so god in his good training as a good
[1:39:40] trainer
[1:39:41] he didn't lead them the short path
[1:39:43] straight up through the land of
[1:39:44] philistines right up through the gaza
[1:39:46] strip
[1:39:46] and right in to palestine but he took a
[1:39:49] detour and took them around
[1:39:51] because he had some things he had to
[1:39:53] teach them first
[1:39:56] they had to learn to be dependent on him
[1:39:58] they had to learn to walk by faith
[1:40:00] they had to learn to obey his word
[1:40:04] there were some things they had to learn
[1:40:06] and what was he doing he was building an
[1:40:08] army
[1:40:08] he had him in boot camp
[1:40:12] first thing he did is is they come out
[1:40:14] rejoicing and
[1:40:15] they come out they've got gold and
[1:40:17] silver and they've got all these things
[1:40:19] that they spoiled out of the egyptians
[1:40:21] and they come out rejoicing amen playing
[1:40:23] the tambourines and dancing
[1:40:25] and happy they were free now
[1:40:29] but god didn't lead him straight to a
[1:40:31] land and but he knew there was fighting
[1:40:33] there
[1:40:34] so he took his time to train them and he
[1:40:37] took him down by the red sea
[1:40:39] and he got him stuck in a trap where
[1:40:42] there was
[1:40:43] zero possibility for them to get out
[1:40:45] pharaoh's army is coming down
[1:40:47] cliff walls on one side c on the other
[1:40:49] the only way of escape was now chariots
[1:40:51] bearing down on them
[1:40:52] because god had a way through the sea
[1:40:55] that they couldn't see
[1:40:57] and god is trying to train them not to
[1:41:00] use their natural eyesight
[1:41:02] not to use reasoning not to depend on
[1:41:05] their ability
[1:41:06] but to have confidence in him and he
[1:41:09] told that prophet what to say
[1:41:11] and they opened the red sea and they
[1:41:12] went across on dry ground and he closed
[1:41:15] it over and destroyed the enemy
[1:41:17] god wanted them to learn how to be an
[1:41:20] invincible army
[1:41:21] and the first lesson he learned is
[1:41:23] there's always a way
[1:41:26] and it's not according to your reasoning
[1:41:28] it's not according to your eyesight
[1:41:30] it's not according to your history your
[1:41:32] past your training
[1:41:34] he's got he's trying to strip them of
[1:41:36] all of that because he's building a new
[1:41:38] army
[1:41:38] he's building a new invincible army
[1:41:40] that's going to learn to
[1:41:41] follow after that prophet no matter
[1:41:44] where it leads you
[1:41:45] follow that pillar of fire if it leads
[1:41:47] you to a dead end
[1:41:48] then he's got a way through the dead end
[1:41:51] if it leads you to the red sea
[1:41:53] he's got a path through the sea amen but
[1:41:56] he's got to tease him follow the pillar
[1:41:57] of fire
[1:41:58] stay with the word and don't use any of
[1:42:01] your human faculties
[1:42:04] because none of your human understanding
[1:42:07] none of your training
[1:42:08] none of your past your eyesight will
[1:42:11] never
[1:42:11] give you the ability to see what god's
[1:42:13] getting ready to do
[1:42:16] they crossed the red sea they rejoiced
[1:42:20] and they
[1:42:20] danced as god a mighty deliverer but did
[1:42:23] they learn the lesson
[1:42:29] a few days later
[1:42:32] they come to bitter water
[1:42:37] he leads them to water and they begin to
[1:42:40] murmur and complain to moses there's
[1:42:42] bitter water
[1:42:43] we're all gonna die he just led you
[1:42:46] through the red sea and now you think
[1:42:48] you're gonna die
[1:42:52] oh can you see god training in your life
[1:42:55] do you see how he's been training his
[1:42:57] bride
[1:43:00] god turns the bitter water sweet and
[1:43:02] they drink
[1:43:03] they rejoice again then they run out of
[1:43:06] vittles
[1:43:07] they begin to murmur and complain and
[1:43:09] always when they murmur and complain
[1:43:11] they're always wanting to go back to
[1:43:13] carnal things
[1:43:15] back to carnality back to egypt
[1:43:19] egypt's the world he's leading them to
[1:43:21] the promised land
[1:43:25] every time we run into an obstacle the
[1:43:28] first thing we want to do is go
[1:43:29] back to the worldly ways i got to get a
[1:43:31] credit card i need a loan
[1:43:33] i got to work more hours
[1:43:39] every obstacle we face oh we got to get
[1:43:41] to the hospital
[1:43:43] i'm not against hospitals i'm not
[1:43:45] against working extra hours please don't
[1:43:48] praise god you know me better than that
[1:43:52] but god wants to show us that there's a
[1:43:55] way where there seems no way
[1:43:58] he wants to show us he's the one that
[1:44:00] can turn bitter water sweet
[1:44:02] and he's got bread that you don't know
[1:44:04] of
[1:44:06] he's got a source you never learned
[1:44:08] about in your books
[1:44:11] he's got a bakery they didn't tell you
[1:44:12] about in egypt
[1:44:16] see what god's doing through the exodus
[1:44:18] journey
[1:44:20] he's trying to build an army and he gets
[1:44:22] that army trained and he fights battles
[1:44:24] for them and
[1:44:25] and they they they fight and they win
[1:44:28] and
[1:44:28] all of these things
[1:44:31] but when they come to kadesh barnea
[1:44:35] they couldn't stop their carnal ways
[1:44:40] and all they could see was walled cities
[1:44:44] giants impenetrable fortresses
[1:44:48] and people that they couldn't defeat and
[1:44:51] they had forgot about the red sea
[1:44:54] and the bitter waters of maura and the
[1:44:57] manna from heaven
[1:44:58] and the quail
[1:45:02] what happens to us nothing different
[1:45:06] god's trying to show us he's trying to
[1:45:09] show us
[1:45:09] another way he's trying to show us his
[1:45:13] provision
[1:45:14] his way he's trying to teach us how to
[1:45:17] take the word
[1:45:18] and fight how to take the sword of the
[1:45:21] word
[1:45:22] how to put the armament on the helmet of
[1:45:24] salvation
[1:45:25] amen now no longer no doubt can enter in
[1:45:28] because i know i'm saved he told me i'm
[1:45:30] saved
[1:45:30] i'm saved by faith in the word i've got
[1:45:32] the helmet of salvation
[1:45:33] now doubts can't enter in what's he
[1:45:36] teaching
[1:45:37] spiritual warfare
[1:45:41] the breastplate of righteousness i can't
[1:45:42] be hurt because i have his righteousness
[1:45:46] the shield of faith amen was given me by
[1:45:48] grace will quench all the fiery darts
[1:45:50] and then feet shod with the preparation
[1:45:52] of the gospel amen with a sword in my
[1:45:54] hand
[1:45:55] which is the sword of the spirit which
[1:45:56] is the word of god
[1:45:58] he's trying to get us to rely on the
[1:46:00] armament trying to get us to fight the
[1:46:02] way he fights
[1:46:04] trying to get us to fight like the
[1:46:05] invincible army
[1:46:07] but we've got to leave the things of
[1:46:08] egypt behind we're not going to do it
[1:46:10] like the world does it we're not going
[1:46:12] to overcome the way the world overcomes
[1:46:14] amen he's trying we're not going to
[1:46:16] fight like egypt fights
[1:46:18] we're going to fight the way god wants
[1:46:20] us to fight
[1:46:22] we know that army amen they rejected at
[1:46:25] katy's barnea
[1:46:26] and god wiped them off
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:30] and through a wilderness journey he
[1:46:32] began to train up a new crop
[1:46:35] and this new crop learned all the
[1:46:36] lessons
[1:46:39] water from a rock man is still falling
[1:46:43] those who oppose the word of god who
[1:46:45] swallowed up
[1:46:48] they're still learning all of these
[1:46:50] things but when you get this
[1:46:52] army now to the promised land it's not
[1:46:56] like that first army
[1:46:57] it's different now because they weren't
[1:46:59] raised up in egypt
[1:47:02] they were raised up in the training camp
[1:47:05] and now when they come when joshua says
[1:47:09] when joshua says prepare vittles for
[1:47:12] three days we're going over they prepare
[1:47:13] when joshua says don't cross till you
[1:47:15] see the art cross land drive
[1:47:17] they do it when he gets on the other
[1:47:19] side and he says circumcise all of you
[1:47:21] they don't question him they just do it
[1:47:23] and joshua's the type of the holy ghost
[1:47:28] different kind of army begins fighting
[1:47:32] amen
[1:47:33] when you go to jericho you're not gonna
[1:47:35] fight like other armies fight
[1:47:37] you're gonna walk around in a circle on
[1:47:39] seventh day seventh time
[1:47:41] and you're gonna shout see god was
[1:47:43] trying to train them in another way
[1:47:46] and we know that army failed
[1:47:50] they eventually went into failure army
[1:47:53] after army after army
[1:47:55] start good finish do god's work
[1:47:58] and then relax raise up another king
[1:48:02] raise up another army amen defeat the
[1:48:04] enemy amen do through the judges do it
[1:48:06] through the kings
[1:48:08] on and on and on but there's coming a
[1:48:12] final army
[1:48:14] there's coming a final battle there's
[1:48:16] coming a final victory
[1:48:18] amen and you and i are being trained
[1:48:20] right now to fight that battle
[1:48:22] this is an army in preparation
[1:48:25] and when he says when he says cook this
[1:48:27] out of your house and kick that out of
[1:48:29] your house
[1:48:29] amen it's an army in preparation when he
[1:48:32] says don't watch the world
[1:48:34] don't love the world or the things of
[1:48:35] the world don't let the worldly
[1:48:36] influences into the church
[1:48:38] don't pass it from one to the other he's
[1:48:40] trying to prepare us for what's coming
[1:48:42] next
[1:48:44] this isn't about being picky friends
[1:48:45] this isn't about amen just somebody's
[1:48:48] idea
[1:48:48] i'm telling you this is god's
[1:48:50] preparation for us for what comes next
[1:48:56] when god got a hold of gideon he was
[1:48:58] going to teach gideon to fight a
[1:49:00] different way
[1:49:02] gideon gathered what anybody would do in
[1:49:04] the reasonable mind
[1:49:06] god comes and tells you you're going to
[1:49:07] be the deliverer you're going to be
[1:49:08] mighty you're going to have a
[1:49:09] deliverance
[1:49:10] he does what anybody else does he
[1:49:11] gathers as many troops as he can gather
[1:49:15] and god says that's too many
[1:49:21] what they had was already
[1:49:25] way a minority to the army that was
[1:49:27] coming against them
[1:49:29] they were already going to have to kill
[1:49:31] five to one ten to one to win the battle
[1:49:35] but god doesn't want us to use reasoning
[1:49:41] so many times we start to wonder about
[1:49:43] things is this permissible or is that
[1:49:44] permissible when we start
[1:49:45] reasoning we start looking around well
[1:49:49] they do it and
[1:49:50] they do it he's trying to break us of
[1:49:52] that friends
[1:49:54] why don't we go to a prayer closet
[1:49:57] why don't we spend some time with the
[1:49:58] lord and say lord show me in your word
[1:50:00] what do you want from me right now
[1:50:03] what's your idea for me right now
[1:50:06] he's trying to teach us a different way
[1:50:08] friends
[1:50:11] gideon send them away
[1:50:15] he lost a big chunk of his army still
[1:50:18] too many
[1:50:20] take him down here and the ones that lap
[1:50:23] water like a dog
[1:50:28] those are the ones that i'm going to
[1:50:29] deliver with
[1:50:32] gideon had never seen that done before
[1:50:34] he had never read that in the bible
[1:50:41] but he heard the voice of god and he
[1:50:44] knew it was gone
[1:50:46] and when god said do it he did it
[1:50:52] got the ones that lap sent everybody
[1:50:53] else away he's left with
[1:50:56] 300 men
[1:51:00] was he crazy no
[1:51:03] he was the most perfectly sane one among
[1:51:06] them
[1:51:07] because he was being directed by the
[1:51:09] spirit of god
[1:51:11] and with those 300 in a very in a very
[1:51:14] unconventional way
[1:51:17] he delivered israel confounded the enemy
[1:51:20] and scattered them we don't have to do
[1:51:24] things the way we've always done them
[1:51:27] we don't have to rely on our reasoning
[1:51:29] and our understanding
[1:51:31] god's trying to get us to go another way
[1:51:35] the question is do we have enough
[1:51:36] courage
[1:51:38] and enough security in christ to go that
[1:51:40] way
[1:51:42] it takes a lot of security it takes a
[1:51:46] you have to know that you're a child of
[1:51:48] god
[1:51:49] and you have to know that you can hear
[1:51:51] from god
[1:51:53] it requires a lot to walk that way
[1:51:58] it's not an easy way because you can't
[1:52:00] use carnal
[1:52:01] resources
[1:52:05] let's go to john chapter 8.
[1:52:19] john chapter 8 verse 28
[1:52:29] then said jesus unto them when you have
[1:52:31] lifted up the son of man then shall you
[1:52:33] know that i am he
[1:52:34] that i do nothing of myself but as my
[1:52:36] father hath taught me i speak these
[1:52:38] things
[1:52:39] and he that sent me is with me the
[1:52:41] father has not left me alone for i do
[1:52:43] always those things that please him
[1:52:46] so jesus did nothing of himself
[1:52:51] he was able to get rid of self
[1:52:55] and only did what that he was taught
[1:52:58] by the father and only those things that
[1:53:02] please him he tells us that he was
[1:53:04] showed of the father
[1:53:06] what to do in the pergamian church age
[1:53:10] from the church age book
[1:53:12] in the section and pick up your pen and
[1:53:13] write it says notice the harmony of the
[1:53:15] father and the son
[1:53:17] jesus never did anything until it was
[1:53:18] first showed him by the father
[1:53:20] john 5 19. this harmony is now to exist
[1:53:23] between the groom and his bride
[1:53:25] he shows her his word of life she
[1:53:26] receives it she never doubts it
[1:53:28] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:53:30] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:53:32] water will raise it up again
[1:53:34] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:53:36] in the bride as it was in mary
[1:53:38] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:53:40] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:53:42] she performs the command of the word in
[1:53:44] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[1:53:47] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:53:48] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:53:50] planted and watered it comes to full
[1:53:52] harvest
[1:53:53] serving its purpose those in the bride
[1:53:55] do only his will
[1:53:57] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:54:00] no one not their family members not
[1:54:03] their friends
[1:54:05] this is the army he's looking for
[1:54:08] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:54:10] have thus saith the lord or they keep
[1:54:11] still
[1:54:12] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:54:14] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:54:16] he did not complete all his work while
[1:54:18] in his earthly ministry
[1:54:20] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:54:23] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:54:25] for him to do certain things that he
[1:54:26] must now do
[1:54:27] but he would now fulfill through the
[1:54:29] bride that work which he left
[1:54:31] for this specific time
[1:54:35] whose works is it the bride's nope it's
[1:54:37] his
[1:54:38] it's his work that he didn't finish that
[1:54:40] he's gonna finish now
[1:54:42] and they know they can't do it how many
[1:54:44] of you can raise your hand say i can't
[1:54:46] do it
[1:54:47] beyond a shot of a doubt i know that i
[1:54:49] cannot do it i have no ability i have no
[1:54:51] wisdom i
[1:54:52] can not do what he's calling for us to
[1:54:55] do in this hour
[1:54:56] and that's the first lesson he wants you
[1:54:58] to learn because he doesn't want you to
[1:55:00] do it
[1:55:01] all he wants you to do is surrender to
[1:55:02] what he wants to do
[1:55:04] he's looking for a vessel he's not
[1:55:05] looking for your brain
[1:55:08] he's not looking for your might he's not
[1:55:09] looking for your ability he is simply
[1:55:11] looking for your surrendered vessel
[1:55:13] that he can have absolute total control
[1:55:16] over
[1:55:16] and when he gets absolute total control
[1:55:19] he will display himself
[1:55:20] through that vessel but we first got to
[1:55:24] get to the place where i don't know
[1:55:25] anything
[1:55:26] i don't know what to do i don't know how
[1:55:28] to do it and i'm completely incapable of
[1:55:30] doing anything
[1:55:35] he says in christ is the mystery of god
[1:55:37] revealed
[1:55:39] where once partly moses had him partly
[1:55:42] david had him
[1:55:43] oh my but here he is manifest in the
[1:55:45] fullness deity himself standing on earth
[1:55:47] god in his fullness to die for the sins
[1:55:49] of the people that he might bring to his
[1:55:51] church a sanctified life
[1:55:53] then he might have the preeminence in
[1:55:56] fullness
[1:55:57] in his church to manifest every promise
[1:55:59] in these last days that he promised for
[1:56:01] the last day
[1:56:03] what he's looking for he's he gave his
[1:56:05] life to bring a sanctification to the
[1:56:07] church
[1:56:07] by the blood of jesus christ so that he
[1:56:09] could live in the church so that he
[1:56:10] could do the work
[1:56:12] but he's not wanting to share the throne
[1:56:14] with you
[1:56:17] he wants self-will to leave the throne
[1:56:20] and he wants to take it
[1:56:25] i've said this statement many times i'm
[1:56:27] going to say it again
[1:56:29] the question what's wrong with it is the
[1:56:32] wrong
[1:56:33] question
[1:56:36] we should be asking what does he want me
[1:56:39] to do
[1:56:40] now because if we ask the question
[1:56:43] what's wrong with it
[1:56:44] we're wanting somebody to show us
[1:56:46] whether it's right or wrong so we can
[1:56:47] make our own decision whether we want to
[1:56:49] do it or not
[1:56:51] instead of asking him what he wants us
[1:56:54] to do
[1:56:55] now we need to be careful
[1:57:00] one thing i've realized in the things
[1:57:02] that have happened to me in the last
[1:57:03] week
[1:57:05] is the difference between right and
[1:57:07] wrong is a hare's breath
[1:57:11] it's not as far as way as what you think
[1:57:13] friends
[1:57:14] it's a hair's breath between right and
[1:57:17] wrong
[1:57:18] and it's going to take a greater
[1:57:20] sensitivity to the spirit than what we
[1:57:22] have now
[1:57:23] but that's what he's trying to do
[1:57:27] we don't have to be afraid he's doing it
[1:57:29] we just got to surrender to what he's
[1:57:31] doing
[1:57:32] he's building it he can't do it without
[1:57:34] you
[1:57:36] god put himself in partnership with man
[1:57:38] if you're the elect seed of god
[1:57:40] predestined to be in this final
[1:57:41] hour he can't do it without you that's
[1:57:44] wonderful
[1:57:45] he can't do without you that's hard
[1:57:49] because if he can't do without you that
[1:57:51] means you're never going to miss out on
[1:57:53] it it's going to happen
[1:57:54] he can't do without you means he's going
[1:57:55] to strip all of you out of you so he
[1:57:57] does it
[1:57:59] and here you are grateful on one hand
[1:58:02] that i'm his and that he's never going
[1:58:03] to leave me behind
[1:58:04] and suffering on the other hand because
[1:58:06] he's raking it down
[1:58:08] and raking it down and raking it down to
[1:58:10] where it's just
[1:58:11] him with his preeminence only
[1:58:15] and we're standing here on one service
[1:58:19] i want to run the aisles the next
[1:58:20] service i want to crawl under my seat
[1:58:24] well that service is god that one's not
[1:58:28] come on praise god
[1:58:32] this is for all of us he wants a greater
[1:58:34] preeminence than he's ever had
[1:58:36] and it's going to take less of self than
[1:58:38] we've ever been able to manifest
[1:58:40] but praise god he knows how to get it
[1:58:44] and i'm thankful for that let's go to
[1:58:47] luke chapter 2.
[1:59:02] luke chapter 2 and verse 48
[1:59:13] and when they saw him they were amazed
[1:59:15] and his mother said unto him son
[1:59:17] why hast thou thus dealt with us behold
[1:59:19] thy father and i have sought thee
[1:59:20] sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[1:59:22] it that you sought me
[1:59:24] wist ye not that i must be about my
[1:59:26] father's business
[1:59:27] and they understood not the saying which
[1:59:29] he spake unto them and he went down with
[1:59:31] them
[1:59:31] and came to nazareth and was subject
[1:59:34] unto them but his mother kept all these
[1:59:36] sayings in her heart
[1:59:37] and jesus increased in wisdom and
[1:59:39] stature and in favor with god and man
[1:59:42] oh i love this verse more and more all
[1:59:44] the time
[1:59:46] because when we look at jesus's life
[1:59:49] when it came time for jesus to be born
[1:59:51] upon the earth
[1:59:52] there was mighty manifestations of the
[1:59:54] spirit that was taking place
[1:59:55] there was angel visitations to zacharias
[1:59:58] an angel visitation to mary
[2:00:00] amen there was a prophecy given through
[2:00:02] anna there was a prophecy given to
[2:00:04] simeon
[2:00:05] there was all of these supernatural
[2:00:07] things happening then she carried the
[2:00:09] child and delivered the child
[2:00:10] and then supernaturally the whole world
[2:00:12] was moved to a taxation
[2:00:13] to get jesus in the right spot at the
[2:00:15] right time amen
[2:00:17] and then there was an angel choir and a
[2:00:19] message given to shepherds and then the
[2:00:20] shepherds were running through the
[2:00:21] village telling what was told
[2:00:23] creating a stir then shortly after that
[2:00:25] there was there was a
[2:00:26] magi a wise man that visited jerusalem
[2:00:29] and spread the news to jerusalem
[2:00:30] and there was joseph with dreams and
[2:00:32] there was mary with visitations
[2:00:36] all of this was happening right as jesus
[2:00:38] come on the scene in your bible
[2:00:41] and then after that everything goes
[2:00:43] quiet
[2:00:46] and this scripture is the only glimpse
[2:00:47] of what we got in the in between time
[2:00:50] from when he was just a small child to
[2:00:53] when he was 30 years old
[2:00:56] and it shows us that he was about his
[2:00:58] father's business
[2:01:00] but he was in training
[2:01:04] he was in training scripture says
[2:01:08] verse 51 and he went down with them and
[2:01:10] came to nazareth and was subject
[2:01:12] unto them that was part of his training
[2:01:15] that was where god placed them and he
[2:01:18] stayed there
[2:01:19] but his mother kept these things in her
[2:01:21] heart and jesus
[2:01:23] increased
[2:01:27] in wisdom and stature and in favor
[2:01:31] with god and man he was in training
[2:01:35] if i just put it through that way he was
[2:01:38] in training
[2:01:40] all of the supernatural when he come
[2:01:41] onto the earth and shortly after
[2:01:44] and then all these years of growing up
[2:01:46] and maturing
[2:01:47] and growing in stature and wisdom
[2:01:51] until finally at 30 years old he burst
[2:01:54] on the scene with a short ministry
[2:01:56] that rocked the world that shook
[2:02:00] the religious system that shook the
[2:02:01] political system in that area
[2:02:05] but in between he was growing increasing
[2:02:11] when this bride came on the scene there
[2:02:13] was a prophet
[2:02:15] there was supernatural 1962 end time
[2:02:18] sign c
[2:02:19] brother benham said there's been five
[2:02:20] planets aligned what is it
[2:02:22] it's he said there's three plan there
[2:02:24] was three stars that day to announce
[2:02:26] this birth when he came the first time
[2:02:27] now there's five planets what's it doing
[2:02:29] announcing a newborn baby bride
[2:02:32] is coming on the earth there was a
[2:02:34] messenger to announce that there was all
[2:02:36] kinds of supernatural that was happening
[2:02:41] the world was catching all kinds of
[2:02:43] signs and all kinds of wonders and
[2:02:45] all kinds of things then it goes quiet
[2:02:50] for 50 some years it goes quiet
[2:02:53] it's not that nothing's happening he's
[2:02:55] growing in the word he knows the word
[2:02:57] he's disputing with him in the temple
[2:03:01] he's increasing he's growing amen and i
[2:03:03] believe there was things happening
[2:03:04] around him is my personal this is
[2:03:06] brother chad
[2:03:07] because when he comes to the wedding in
[2:03:09] cana amen mary knows he can turn the
[2:03:11] water to wine
[2:03:12] how did mary know that she had lived
[2:03:14] with him all of those years
[2:03:15] i believe there was things that happened
[2:03:17] around jesus but it wasn't a public
[2:03:19] ministry
[2:03:21] there was things that was happening but
[2:03:23] all of a sudden when it was time
[2:03:24] it was like flipping a switch and when
[2:03:26] the switch flipped it went
[2:03:28] from private to public and now everybody
[2:03:30] was seeing it
[2:03:34] my question to you is could that repeat
[2:03:36] in the bride
[2:03:39] could that same thing repeat in the
[2:03:41] bride
[2:03:42] and if it does where are we he's
[2:03:45] preparing us
[2:03:47] he's been preparing us but we should be
[2:03:49] learning more and maturity and more
[2:03:50] maturity and mormon he should be getting
[2:03:52] more preeminence and more preeminence
[2:03:54] and more preeminence till he's getting a
[2:03:56] bride that will just speak
[2:03:58] by his commandment and just move by his
[2:04:00] leadership
[2:04:06] brother ma'am says
[2:04:10] in the message in absolute 63
[2:04:14] now you see we are not
[2:04:17] a divided people we've got to be in
[2:04:21] unity
[2:04:22] because each one of us holds a part of
[2:04:24] god
[2:04:25] do you believe that that's a big
[2:04:28] statement
[2:04:30] i mean bigger than i think we could
[2:04:31] realize
[2:04:34] and we must come together and then the
[2:04:37] pillar of fire is manifest in the
[2:04:38] wholeness and the fullness of it
[2:04:40] when his church sets together in
[2:04:42] heavenly places
[2:04:43] then the fullness of the power of god is
[2:04:45] in his church
[2:04:46] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[2:04:49] and spiritual offices
[2:04:51] coming together brings the pillar of
[2:04:53] fire back again
[2:04:56] hallelujah that wasn't a one-man
[2:04:58] ministry
[2:05:00] that's not just a group of a few really
[2:05:02] gifted people that's not what he's
[2:05:03] talking about he's talking about
[2:05:05] bringing the pillar of fire back again
[2:05:07] when each one of us is holding a part of
[2:05:10] god
[2:05:10] each one of us it doesn't matter if
[2:05:12] you're a child or a teenager
[2:05:14] it doesn't matter your age or station or
[2:05:16] status if you are a part of god
[2:05:18] you were always a part of god and you're
[2:05:20] holding within you now
[2:05:21] a part of god and none of it is inferior
[2:05:25] to the next and none of one not one's
[2:05:27] more necessary than the other
[2:05:29] every one of them is critical to where
[2:05:31] we're at
[2:05:33] he said each one of us holding spiritual
[2:05:36] gifts
[2:05:36] and spiritual offices coming together
[2:05:39] brings that pillar of fire
[2:05:40] back again you can't leave you out of it
[2:05:44] i can't leave you out of it you can't
[2:05:46] leave me out of it but we all have to
[2:05:48] surrender
[2:05:50] to it brother bram says i'm just going
[2:05:54] to read a few quotes to you
[2:05:56] i'm just going to go through a list of
[2:05:57] them so don't get bored
[2:06:00] don't fall asleep i'm going to read a
[2:06:03] list of quotes to you
[2:06:05] laodicean church age out of the church
[2:06:07] age book
[2:06:09] remember we have shown clearly all
[2:06:10] through the ages that even as adam and
[2:06:12] eve fell
[2:06:12] because they left the word so the
[2:06:14] ephesian age fell by
[2:06:16] turning slightly from the word until
[2:06:18] with every age continuing to turn away
[2:06:20] we have a final repudiation of the word
[2:06:23] by the world church systems
[2:06:25] this laodicean age ends in a blackout of
[2:06:27] the word
[2:06:28] thereby causing a departure of the lord
[2:06:30] from the midst
[2:06:31] he stands outside calling to his own who
[2:06:34] follow him
[2:06:35] by obedience to the word after a short
[2:06:38] and powerful demonstration of the spirit
[2:06:41] this little hunted and persecuted group
[2:06:43] will go to be with jesus
[2:06:49] after a short and powerful demonstration
[2:06:52] of the spirit
[2:06:54] this little hunted
[2:06:58] and persecuted group will go to be with
[2:07:00] jesus
[2:07:04] further in the same later scene church
[2:07:06] age the wheat and the tares which from
[2:07:08] the first age until now have grown side
[2:07:10] by side are harvested what not not what
[2:07:12] nice set out to accomplish has finally
[2:07:14] come to pass
[2:07:15] with all the might of organization the
[2:07:17] false church turns from any vestige of
[2:07:19] truth
[2:07:20] and with political might reinforces
[2:07:22] herself with state backing
[2:07:25] hear what brother branham's saying
[2:07:27] reinforces herself with state backing
[2:07:30] and sets out to eradicate forever the
[2:07:32] true believer
[2:07:34] but just when she is about to accomplish
[2:07:36] her cowardly plot
[2:07:37] the wheat is gathered into the garner
[2:07:42] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:07:44] identified
[2:07:45] oh the devil is howling about this the
[2:07:48] manifested truth of the promise of the
[2:07:50] word and her alone
[2:07:52] they don't have the answer when jesus
[2:07:53] come why didn't those pharisees see
[2:07:56] he said this pharisee he said if i cast
[2:07:58] out devils by the finger of god who do
[2:07:59] you cast him out by
[2:08:00] see he stood alone and his church stands
[2:08:04] alone
[2:08:04] she is not hooked with nothing but he
[2:08:06] was identified by god
[2:08:08] being the body that god dwelled in and
[2:08:10] the church is identified by his body
[2:08:12] doing the same thing
[2:08:13] she is his body the manifested truth of
[2:08:16] his promised word for the last day
[2:08:18] and she and she alone stands by it
[2:08:22] that's why the devil is howling these
[2:08:23] great organizations to set up something
[2:08:26] to close her up
[2:08:28] you guess that these great organizations
[2:08:31] set up something to close her up they'll
[2:08:33] never do it
[2:08:34] she'll be taken up not closed up she is
[2:08:37] now risen and by the power of the
[2:08:39] vindicated word promised to her
[2:08:43] spoken word is the original seed i
[2:08:46] believe someday the real bride of christ
[2:08:47] will be forced to stop preaching the
[2:08:49] word of god
[2:08:50] the bible prophesies of it in revelation
[2:08:52] 13 6 if you want to put it down
[2:08:54] denominations will force it to stop or
[2:08:57] take its mark
[2:08:58] then when the lamb will take his bride
[2:09:00] and judge the for this
[2:09:02] pergamian church age on the church book
[2:09:04] he says the same thing only it's in the
[2:09:05] church age book
[2:09:06] i believe according to revelation 13 16
[2:09:08] that the bride will have to stop
[2:09:10] preaching for the beast
[2:09:11] is demanding the mark in the hand or
[2:09:13] forehead if permission to preach be
[2:09:15] granted
[2:09:16] denominations will take the mark or be
[2:09:18] forced to quit preaching
[2:09:19] then the lamb will come for his bride
[2:09:21] and judge the great harlot
[2:09:23] 1963 look away to jesus so now i'm going
[2:09:26] to say something to you now that i
[2:09:28] haven't said all along
[2:09:29] and that is the thing that we have
[2:09:31] looked forward to so for so long
[2:09:33] for at least many years four or five
[2:09:34] years or maybe longer the third pool has
[2:09:37] now been vindicated
[2:09:38] and i'm sure you all know what it is now
[2:09:41] remember there'll never
[2:09:42] be an impersonation of that because it
[2:09:44] can't be see it cannot be
[2:09:46] now it's in existence and i'm warned of
[2:09:48] this that soon right at this time now
[2:09:50] it's just happened so it could be
[2:09:52] identified its presence among you see
[2:09:55] but it will not be used in a great way
[2:09:57] until this council begins to tighten up
[2:10:00] and when it does when that does the
[2:10:02] pentecostals and so forth can almost
[2:10:04] impersonate anything can be done but
[2:10:06] when that time comes then the squeeze
[2:10:08] comes down
[2:10:09] then you'll see what you've seen
[2:10:10] temporarily be manifest in the fullness
[2:10:13] of its power
[2:10:17] christ is the mystery guard revealed but
[2:10:19] their folly will be made manifest
[2:10:21] he's talking about janus and jamborees
[2:10:23] their fallacy
[2:10:24] their folly will be made manifest when
[2:10:26] jesus takes his bride and sets her up
[2:10:28] here and says this is her
[2:10:30] and the way he goes with her that's
[2:10:32] right and their folly will be made known
[2:10:36] christ is the mystery god revealed now
[2:10:38] you can see now the end time message why
[2:10:40] it's rejected
[2:10:40] can you now no denomination but
[2:10:43] revelation of his mystery see no
[2:10:44] denomination
[2:10:45] the revelation god is not known by the
[2:10:47] nomination he's known by revelation
[2:10:50] look god in his body christ and christ
[2:10:53] in his body the bride
[2:10:56] christ in his body
[2:10:59] who's his body the bride
[2:11:03] and as god took from the body of adam
[2:11:05] the woman and she fell then god is took
[2:11:07] from the body of christ his flesh his
[2:11:09] body
[2:11:09] which is his word and is bringing a
[2:11:11] bride out that won't fall by the
[2:11:13] nomination or creed no serve
[2:11:15] but she is coming back with pure
[2:11:17] unadulterated word of god
[2:11:19] being manifested i hope every man that
[2:11:22] hears this tape and every woman will
[2:11:23] understand that see
[2:11:25] she is the second eve but she is not
[2:11:27] breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[2:11:29] purity and holiness to her husband
[2:11:31] she shall stay with this word regardless
[2:11:33] of what anybody says
[2:11:35] you can have all the ecumenical moves
[2:11:37] you want to and all the affiliations
[2:11:39] and they're going to bring a persecution
[2:11:41] on pretty soon and shut up all the
[2:11:43] churches
[2:11:44] you see that brother ben is preaching in
[2:11:46] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:11:48] this is not an obscure message from what
[2:11:50] this is christ crisis the mystery of god
[2:11:51] revealed the church age book
[2:11:53] looking away to jesus 1963 spoken word
[2:11:57] is the original seed
[2:11:59] they're going to bring a persecution on
[2:12:01] pretty soon and shut up all the churches
[2:12:03] you see that
[2:12:03] and church is like this who is not the
[2:12:05] nomination they'll use them for a
[2:12:06] storehouse anything
[2:12:08] and if any man goes out and offers
[2:12:10] prayer for anybody else that don't
[2:12:11] belong to the ecumenical movement
[2:12:13] will be shot on the spot
[2:12:17] now we can cut that out of the message
[2:12:18] you want and throw it away or we can
[2:12:20] read it as part of christ as the mystery
[2:12:22] of god reveal
[2:12:24] it's already the lutheran minister
[2:12:26] minister the head of it said so
[2:12:28] and it's right here you can read it
[2:12:29] right in your magazine i'd like to have
[2:12:31] that magazine
[2:12:33] right don't make any difference what
[2:12:35] they say that church will stand
[2:12:37] true to this light she's already proved
[2:12:39] it back yonder and shall do it again in
[2:12:41] the face of everything
[2:12:43] it's the word of god and the the all
[2:12:46] ecumenical movements and everything else
[2:12:48] will be gone
[2:12:48] she's going to be there without spot or
[2:12:50] wrinkle that's right
[2:12:52] she'll stand there but the memo said
[2:12:54] they already proved it back then
[2:12:56] they already they already took amen they
[2:12:58] already took peter
[2:13:00] and john and they threw they they threw
[2:13:01] them in prison and threatened them amen
[2:13:03] and the angel lord come and told them
[2:13:06] what to do
[2:13:08] and they did it they threw some of them
[2:13:10] in prison and the angel opened the doors
[2:13:12] and let him out of prison and said go
[2:13:13] back and preach back in the temple the
[2:13:15] same temple you were preaching in when
[2:13:17] they arrested you
[2:13:18] now go back and preach in the same
[2:13:20] temple and they went to get them out for
[2:13:22] questioning and they said they're not
[2:13:23] there then somebody else runs in and
[2:13:25] says hey those people you arrested
[2:13:26] they're down there preaching in the
[2:13:28] temple
[2:13:30] look at the control that god wanted to
[2:13:32] have over his bride
[2:13:34] not when these doors open you run as
[2:13:35] fast as you can and go find a safe place
[2:13:37] to hide
[2:13:38] they were under such control that the
[2:13:40] very place they were arrested and their
[2:13:42] lives were threatened amen when the
[2:13:44] doors opened he said go back to the same
[2:13:46] place then go through the same kind of
[2:13:48] punishment
[2:13:48] and the same kind of persecution and
[2:13:50] they went right back to the same spot
[2:13:56] peter and john stood before him in the
[2:13:57] council amen and they said
[2:13:59] we we they threatened them amen and they
[2:14:01] tried to scare them
[2:14:02] and they said don't preach in that name
[2:14:04] anymore
[2:14:06] and peter just said peter didn't say yes
[2:14:08] sir i'll be a good boy if you just let
[2:14:09] me go
[2:14:12] didn't say i want to go see my wife
[2:14:16] you realize that's a bible story but
[2:14:19] sometimes we don't get the gravity of
[2:14:20] the bible story leaving it as a bible
[2:14:22] story
[2:14:23] peter had a wife
[2:14:26] his wife was crying he was in prison
[2:14:31] we've got to realize i don't know if
[2:14:32] peter had children or not
[2:14:35] but we know he had a wife he's in prison
[2:14:38] his wife is crying amen now he's offered
[2:14:42] a chance to get out
[2:14:44] they're just going to threaten him and
[2:14:45] tell him not to do it again
[2:14:47] and if he'll just be a good boy amen and
[2:14:49] he'll just go along with what they're
[2:14:50] saying
[2:14:51] he can get out what man could face that
[2:14:54] kind of temptation
[2:14:58] and his answer was you tell me is it
[2:15:01] better to obey man or better obey god
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:06] you see there was a certain kind of
[2:15:07] control
[2:15:09] there was a certain kind of preeminence
[2:15:11] and they fell from that but
[2:15:12] that's the same thing he's bringing us
[2:15:14] back to
[2:15:15] that kind of preeminence that kind of
[2:15:17] control when he
[2:15:19] says you go there and they're going to
[2:15:20] throw rocks at you you go there and let
[2:15:22] them throw rocks at you
[2:15:24] [Applause]
[2:15:30] that's his army
[2:15:33] he's the chief captain he knows
[2:15:37] what's right he knows what's best amen
[2:15:40] and they were so willing to follow
[2:15:42] exactly what he said
[2:15:47] the apostle paul
[2:15:51] he was told that he would stand before
[2:15:52] caesar
[2:15:56] all along the way he's told
[2:15:59] you know we prophesied here when you go
[2:16:02] you'll be bound in jerusalem agabus
[2:16:03] comes down and
[2:16:04] ties his his own hands and his girdle
[2:16:07] and tells him the man who owns his
[2:16:09] girdle the same shall be done to him
[2:16:11] and they try to convince him not to go
[2:16:15] and he says why do you break my heart
[2:16:17] with your weeping
[2:16:20] it wasn't like it was easy friends it
[2:16:22] wasn't like there was no emotion
[2:16:24] involved
[2:16:25] it wasn't as though going to prison was
[2:16:27] a nice experience for peter and a nice
[2:16:29] experience for paul and silas
[2:16:31] it wasn't as though when they sang songs
[2:16:33] they were doing so
[2:16:34] in the most joyous time of their life
[2:16:36] they had been beaten
[2:16:37] they were hurting they were in pain but
[2:16:40] they lifted up their voice because they
[2:16:42] were under god's control
[2:16:43] they knew who they were they knew who
[2:16:45] was in charge amen and they knew
[2:16:47] they were right in the line of duty and
[2:16:48] instead of feeling sorry for themselves
[2:16:50] they were going to worship
[2:16:51] god almighty
[2:16:54] [Applause]
[2:16:58] paul says why does that make me weep
[2:17:02] i'm ready not to just be bound but give
[2:17:04] my life
[2:17:06] you know what he did he went straight to
[2:17:08] jerusalem
[2:17:11] you see we are always trying to bypass
[2:17:13] trouble
[2:17:15] we're human beings we're prone to
[2:17:17] failure we're to have weaknesses
[2:17:19] we have loved ones we love one another
[2:17:22] we love our wives we love our children
[2:17:24] but so did paul and and paul didn't have
[2:17:27] a wife of gentlemen paul
[2:17:29] loved the people that were around him he
[2:17:30] loved the people in the church peter had
[2:17:32] a family
[2:17:33] i don't know about the rest of the
[2:17:34] disciples but they were all willing to
[2:17:36] give up
[2:17:37] everything to follow the commandment of
[2:17:38] the lord
[2:17:41] their love for him and their obedience
[2:17:43] for him superseded the relationship with
[2:17:45] the wife
[2:17:46] superseded their love for the brethren
[2:17:50] that's what he wants friends i'm so
[2:17:53] sure of it i'm so confident i know
[2:17:56] that's exactly what he's trying to get
[2:17:58] out of us
[2:17:58] i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[2:18:00] is what he wants from our lives
[2:18:03] and you think the preaching's intense
[2:18:05] now it's going to get
[2:18:06] more and more pointed and more direct
[2:18:09] until self is gone
[2:18:10] and he's got preeminence because that's
[2:18:13] what the prophet said he was going to
[2:18:15] have that's the second fold purpose of
[2:18:17] the threefold purpose
[2:18:18] is preeminence and if he's got to shave
[2:18:20] us down and
[2:18:21] shave us down and shave us down he will
[2:18:23] shave us down
[2:18:24] till there's nothing of self left but he
[2:18:27] has the preeminence
[2:18:31] until he says go back to that same place
[2:18:34] where they forbid you to go
[2:18:36] and if they say brother branham said
[2:18:39] christ the mystery of god
[2:18:40] if you offer a prayer they'll shoot they
[2:18:42] can shoot you on the spot
[2:18:43] and if god says go off for prayer you go
[2:18:46] off for prayer
[2:18:46] and if there's a gunman standing there
[2:18:48] with a gun you offer prayer
[2:18:54] these aren't fairy tales this is what
[2:18:56] the prophet has said
[2:18:59] this is what was in the book of acts and
[2:19:01] if they if they
[2:19:02] put forth another branch they'll write
[2:19:04] another
[2:19:07] amen i don't know what things will look
[2:19:10] like i don't know what's happening all i
[2:19:12] know is what prophet said
[2:19:14] i don't know exactly what it would look
[2:19:15] like i don't know what the time frame
[2:19:16] would be like
[2:19:17] i don't know i don't know anything
[2:19:20] except what he said
[2:19:23] and i know for for that
[2:19:27] to manifest in me he's going to have to
[2:19:29] have greater preeminence
[2:19:32] i know for that to manifest in me and
[2:19:34] for me to go through that time
[2:19:36] i'm going to have to die some more
[2:19:37] there's going to have to be less chad
[2:19:39] lam and more of him
[2:19:41] because i'm still afraid and i still
[2:19:44] have human affection that
[2:19:45] takes precedence over things there's
[2:19:47] still some things in me that have to be
[2:19:49] shaved down
[2:19:51] i know i need some more shaving to come
[2:19:53] to this
[2:20:01] message absolute 1963. now you see we
[2:20:04] are not a divided people
[2:20:07] we've got to be in unity i read this
[2:20:09] before i start all that i'm reading it
[2:20:10] again
[2:20:11] because each one of us is holding a part
[2:20:13] of god
[2:20:16] and we must come together and the pillar
[2:20:18] of fire is manifested in the wholeness
[2:20:20] and the fullness of it
[2:20:22] when his church sits together in
[2:20:23] heavenly places then the fullness of the
[2:20:25] power of god is in his church
[2:20:27] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[2:20:30] and spiritual offices coming together
[2:20:33] brings that pillar of fire
[2:20:35] back again
[2:20:38] i'll tell you in the last couple of
[2:20:41] weeks
[2:20:43] like i said i sit at a vantage point
[2:20:45] that is unique
[2:20:47] because when somebody has a spiritual
[2:20:48] experience oftentimes they'll give me a
[2:20:50] call
[2:20:52] and i get to hear and it's been that way
[2:20:55] you know since i became a pastor
[2:20:58] but things are changing friends
[2:21:02] there's people in this assembly having
[2:21:03] spiritual experiences
[2:21:05] across the board and they're picking up
[2:21:06] in intensity
[2:21:08] dreams are increasing and if you're a
[2:21:11] dreamer you can probably say dreams are
[2:21:12] increasing
[2:21:14] tongues are increasing people's prayer
[2:21:16] time is increasing
[2:21:18] things are changing amongst our brothers
[2:21:20] and sisters and i'm sitting in a point
[2:21:21] that i get to hear it
[2:21:23] supernaturally we had a brother led by a
[2:21:26] dream to go and fulfill that dream and
[2:21:28] it happened exactly like it was told
[2:21:32] things are happening friends things are
[2:21:34] happening all around us
[2:21:37] let's dial into it brother benham said
[2:21:40] there's a great symphony going on
[2:21:43] and he said you've got to get in the
[2:21:44] spirit of the symphony
[2:21:46] to catch the changing of the beat he
[2:21:49] said it's beating right along but you've
[2:21:50] got to be looking at the sheet music he
[2:21:52] called it the word
[2:21:54] the composers wrote it you've got to get
[2:21:56] in the spirit of the composer the
[2:21:57] conductor is leading which is the holy
[2:21:59] ghost is leading us along
[2:22:00] you've got to get into the spirit of it
[2:22:02] you're going to miss the transitions
[2:22:04] you've got to get into the song you've
[2:22:06] got to get into what god is doing we've
[2:22:07] got to give ourselves over to what god
[2:22:09] is doing
[2:22:10] so we don't miss the transition that you
[2:22:12] you see it the bits building the beats
[2:22:14] changing
[2:22:15] it's getting ready to shift into
[2:22:16] something else amen and if you're
[2:22:18] reading the music and following the
[2:22:19] conductor
[2:22:20] you can sense it's coming i don't know
[2:22:23] about you but i
[2:22:24] know it i know it in my spirit like i've
[2:22:26] never known anything else
[2:22:27] things are building it's getting ready
[2:22:29] to transition again
[2:22:31] and god is bringing spiritual gifts out
[2:22:33] of the body
[2:22:34] like i've never seen before in this
[2:22:36] concentration in this fast
[2:22:38] and spiritual experiences that are
[2:22:39] happening that fast
[2:22:42] get in the rhythm friends get in the
[2:22:45] rhythm
[2:22:46] don't get offended by the preaching
[2:22:48] don't get your toes stepped on and draw
[2:22:50] back
[2:22:50] get in the rhythm of what's being said
[2:22:53] get into the harmony with the word get
[2:22:56] in the rhythm with the way the spirit of
[2:22:57] god is moving
[2:22:58] get in and catch the transition
[2:23:04] brother bannon said in 1961 they ever
[2:23:08] present water from the rock
[2:23:11] and the little power that will raise us
[2:23:13] up is right in us now
[2:23:16] we are now in heavenly places we are now
[2:23:19] in the power of the resurrection
[2:23:22] you believe that
[2:23:25] it's already laying there
[2:23:28] your body change is already laying in
[2:23:30] your
[2:23:33] if there wasn't a law to that sons and
[2:23:36] daughters of god would create them a
[2:23:38] world out there and go
[2:23:39] live a private life on it
[2:23:43] i'm not making this up send the message
[2:23:48] you have the power in you to do it if
[2:23:51] you've got a shadow of the power of god
[2:23:53] on you you got
[2:23:54] power to do it god is omnipotent see
[2:23:56] what i mean
[2:23:57] the power that's in you will make you
[2:24:00] would
[2:24:00] speak a world into existence and go live
[2:24:02] on it hallelujah
[2:24:04] there you are that's what power is in
[2:24:07] the church
[2:24:08] now now i'm waiting for great power to
[2:24:12] come
[2:24:13] you've got power now
[2:24:16] it's in you now that's what the power is
[2:24:20] in the church now
[2:24:21] but it's controlled by a law and that
[2:24:24] law is not keeping a bunch of
[2:24:26] commandments it's a law
[2:24:27] of faith jesus said all things are
[2:24:30] possible to them
[2:24:31] that believe and if you can believe it
[2:24:34] whatsoever god will lead your soul to
[2:24:36] believe
[2:24:36] that is yours
[2:24:39] every place the souls of your foot can
[2:24:41] set upon by by faith god gives it to you
[2:24:44] amen it's yours
[2:24:45] you possess it if you can find the key
[2:24:47] to this law of faith that opens it to
[2:24:50] you
[2:24:52] you see what i mean the power is
[2:24:54] controlled by if you are a son of god
[2:24:56] you are a daughter of god
[2:24:58] that never leaves you it's with you all
[2:25:00] the time but your faith gets away from
[2:25:02] it but it's still there
[2:25:05] all that power is there the power of the
[2:25:07] resurrection is there the power of the
[2:25:09] body
[2:25:10] change is there the power to speak
[2:25:12] another world into existence and go live
[2:25:14] on it is already inside of you
[2:25:16] if you've got a shadow of the power of
[2:25:18] god if you've got an expressed attribute
[2:25:20] if you've got a peace of god inside of
[2:25:22] you
[2:25:22] that power is there
[2:25:26] but it's controlled by a law it will
[2:25:28] only operate
[2:25:30] what you believe that's why when you
[2:25:33] believe for healing you get healed
[2:25:35] when you believe for your deliverance
[2:25:36] you get delivered why the power is
[2:25:37] already there
[2:25:42] what's god trying to do strip away
[2:25:45] carnality
[2:25:47] he's trying to get all of egypt out of
[2:25:49] his friends
[2:25:51] all denominational ideas our carnal
[2:25:54] approaches
[2:25:56] all worldliness all influence of the
[2:25:58] entertainments of the world and fans of
[2:26:00] the world and
[2:26:01] he's trying to get all that away from us
[2:26:04] because everything's already in us and
[2:26:06] the word's already been given to us
[2:26:08] but what he wants to do is he that
[2:26:11] that army when you go into the army and
[2:26:14] you go into boot camp
[2:26:17] they've got to get you from a
[2:26:20] from a 18 year old civilian
[2:26:24] into a soldier that they can let you
[2:26:26] drive a 20 million dollar tank
[2:26:30] with the power to destroy villages
[2:26:38] power without character is satanic
[2:26:43] god wants that power under complete
[2:26:46] control
[2:26:50] i'll say it this way the bride of jesus
[2:26:53] christ is
[2:26:54] so powerful that when it begins to
[2:26:58] manifest it's going to be
[2:27:00] shocking
[2:27:05] and i say that by revelation when it
[2:27:08] begins to manifest it's going to be
[2:27:10] shocking how much power
[2:27:13] is in the words of this little humble
[2:27:17] nobody bride
[2:27:22] but that kind of power has to be under
[2:27:25] absolute control
[2:27:30] jesus christ said all power in heaven
[2:27:33] and earth is given unto me
[2:27:38] why was that possible because he only
[2:27:41] did that
[2:27:42] what the father showed him he only did
[2:27:45] what the father taught him
[2:27:46] and he only did that which pleased the
[2:27:48] father and he said all power in heaven
[2:27:51] and earth is given to me
[2:27:54] this power will get you through the red
[2:27:57] sea
[2:28:00] this power will create squirrels
[2:28:03] where there is no squirrels this power
[2:28:06] can produce enough
[2:28:07] bread and fishes to feed 5 000 men
[2:28:10] besides women and children
[2:28:14] this power is enough to pluck you from
[2:28:16] one location
[2:28:18] without you walking or flying and have
[2:28:21] you show up in another location hundreds
[2:28:23] of miles away
[2:28:25] this power is enough to get you to walk
[2:28:27] on top of the water
[2:28:30] this power is enough to direct you to a
[2:28:33] coin in a fish's mouth if you need to
[2:28:35] pay taxes
[2:28:38] you understand friends there's nothing
[2:28:40] for the bride to be worried about
[2:28:44] this is the same power that told joseph
[2:28:46] it's not safe here take the child to
[2:28:48] egypt
[2:28:49] and it's the same power to tell him it's
[2:28:51] safe now go back
[2:28:55] it's not what we work up to it's what we
[2:28:57] surrender to
[2:28:59] it's what we give ourselves over to he
[2:29:01] wants preeminence he doesn't want our
[2:29:03] mind clouded with things that aren't the
[2:29:04] world
[2:29:05] not the word he doesn't want us all
[2:29:08] twisted inside by the world
[2:29:09] he wants us free to hear his voice to
[2:29:11] follow his leading he wants us
[2:29:13] consecrated and separated from the
[2:29:15] things of the world
[2:29:16] he wants a bride separated he wants a
[2:29:19] bride that stands alone upon the word he
[2:29:21] wants a bride that's
[2:29:22] completely given over to him
[2:29:25] and that's what he's doing now and
[2:29:27] that's what he's going to keep doing
[2:29:29] and he's going to bring us to that place
[2:29:32] where what you've seen
[2:29:33] temporarily will be manifest in the
[2:29:36] fullness of its power
[2:29:40] we all want to see those days
[2:29:44] every one of us but to get to that place
[2:29:50] you gotta learn to do some push-ups
[2:29:53] tuck your sheets in straight polish your
[2:29:56] boots
[2:29:57] eat chow in 30 seconds peel potatoes
[2:30:02] whatever else we all want to get to that
[2:30:05] place
[2:30:06] but to get to that place he's got to
[2:30:08] train us to that place
[2:30:11] we've got to learn to trust him for our
[2:30:12] manner we've got to learn to trust him
[2:30:14] for our water
[2:30:16] we've got to learn to trust him in times
[2:30:17] of illness we got to learn to trust him
[2:30:19] in times of
[2:30:20] financial calamity
[2:30:24] god is building us to that position
[2:30:26] right now
[2:30:28] but we've got to be aware of what's
[2:30:31] quit fussing quit resisting
[2:30:35] quit pushing against god
[2:30:38] said god if that's what you want from me
[2:30:40] i'm here
[2:30:43] if you want to strip me of every
[2:30:45] pleasure of the world strip me
[2:30:47] my pleasures are coming in the future
[2:30:51] my joy is coming ahead but i tell you
[2:30:54] once you make that surrender you'll find
[2:30:55] your every joy is in him
[2:30:59] non things of the world not in earthly
[2:31:01] pleasures but the real joy
[2:31:03] you find in quiet times with him when
[2:31:05] you speak to him and he speaks back to
[2:31:07] you
[2:31:08] that's the real joy
[2:31:12] i tell you we had a family devotion
[2:31:14] monday night
[2:31:16] and i had preached sunday what the lord
[2:31:18] told me to preach
[2:31:21] and i woke up monday in tears because i
[2:31:25] i don't like doing that it's such a
[2:31:28] strain
[2:31:29] i woke up depressed and i woke up in
[2:31:32] tears
[2:31:34] and under such agony of spirit
[2:31:38] don't forget to say things like
[2:31:42] that you pay a price
[2:31:45] spirits don't like it when they're
[2:31:48] exposed
[2:31:49] by the message i expose spirits and i go
[2:31:51] in the hotel and fight them all night
[2:31:52] now
[2:31:54] i woke up monday morning under such an
[2:31:56] oppression
[2:31:57] i was in tears got up went to prayer
[2:32:02] through my day it's a tough day
[2:32:05] but i knew i did what he wanted me to do
[2:32:08] i had no regrets for that
[2:32:12] we come to our we had we had a good day
[2:32:15] god blessed us and
[2:32:16] some encouraging things happened along
[2:32:17] the way and a few of you sent
[2:32:18] encouraging texts and
[2:32:20] encouraging messages and it meant the
[2:32:21] world to me you have no idea
[2:32:24] but we went to our family devotions
[2:32:28] and for family devotions i was teaching
[2:32:30] my children about azusa street the
[2:32:31] reality of azusa street
[2:32:34] and the reality of azusa street was that
[2:32:37] it was so
[2:32:38] humble so quiet
[2:32:41] but so powerful
[2:32:44] and we started talking about that and i
[2:32:46] said god wanted that level of
[2:32:48] manifestation and power under control
[2:32:51] to come into the message to go into the
[2:32:53] wheat
[2:32:55] but it failed but what god wants is all
[2:32:57] of that
[2:32:58] plus the opening of the word to be the
[2:33:01] full expression of the word in this day
[2:33:04] so i just talked to my kids and we
[2:33:07] haven't
[2:33:07] normally have a devotion and normally at
[2:33:09] the end of devotion i pray
[2:33:12] and usually it's god thank you for our
[2:33:13] day thank you for this and that if we
[2:33:15] had any prayer requests we pray over
[2:33:17] them
[2:33:17] pray for our next day it's usually just
[2:33:19] a few minutes and everybody
[2:33:21] goes to bed it's not it's not any big
[2:33:23] deal
[2:33:25] but this monday when i began to pray the
[2:33:28] presence of god come down so strong
[2:33:32] i began to weep like a baby
[2:33:35] and weep and weep and weep god
[2:33:38] pressed me down under the spirit and
[2:33:40] pressed my head down between my knees
[2:33:42] till my face was almost to the floor
[2:33:44] sitting in my chair and i began to just
[2:33:46] pour out my heart and i begin to weep
[2:33:48] before god
[2:33:49] and i begin to repent for everything
[2:33:51] we've ever done in our house
[2:33:53] i begin to repeat for saying things that
[2:33:55] aren't nice to each other repent for
[2:33:56] saying things that were cruel saying
[2:33:58] things that are unfeeling i already
[2:33:59] begin to repent for being foolish i'm
[2:34:01] getting into repent i began to clean out
[2:34:04] and wept and wept and i was an absolute
[2:34:07] mess
[2:34:08] nose was running tears were drowning
[2:34:10] this has never happened in our family
[2:34:12] devotion ever before
[2:34:14] and then the spirit would lift up a
[2:34:15] little bit and then come right back down
[2:34:16] and push me literally push my face
[2:34:19] between my knees
[2:34:23] and i began to pray and i don't even
[2:34:25] know what all i said i was just praying
[2:34:27] my whole heart
[2:34:29] knowing that this is the hour and this
[2:34:30] is what i pray god this is the hour
[2:34:32] this is the moment this is when you want
[2:34:34] full expression and these are the bodies
[2:34:36] you wanted in
[2:34:38] that revelation friends wasn't lifting
[2:34:40] me up that revelation was breaking me
[2:34:43] down
[2:34:44] and putting my face in the ground
[2:34:48] because it's going to be done in utter
[2:34:50] humility
[2:34:51] if god is going to show himself powerful
[2:34:53] if what you've seen temporarily be
[2:34:54] manifest in the fullness of his power
[2:34:56] it'll be done through utter humility and
[2:34:58] simplicity
[2:35:00] so no man will get any glory
[2:35:04] we prayed like that for some time i
[2:35:06] don't know how long it went
[2:35:08] and the spirit lifted and i was a wreck
[2:35:11] my kids had never seen me this way this
[2:35:13] has never happened in our family
[2:35:14] devotion before
[2:35:16] and i knew one thing god was pleased
[2:35:19] with what i did on sunday i knew that i
[2:35:22] was obedient
[2:35:24] i was obedient to him i looked at my
[2:35:27] kids and i said
[2:35:31] i just looked at them tears all over my
[2:35:33] face i'm using a kleenex to clean myself
[2:35:35] up i won't do any more describing than
[2:35:37] that
[2:35:39] but i looked at him and i said the only
[2:35:40] thing i could say
[2:35:42] was things are not always going to be
[2:35:44] like they are now
[2:35:47] i looked at my children and i know what
[2:35:49] that means
[2:35:51] and i said things are not going to
[2:35:53] remain the way they are now
[2:35:55] but things are going to change
[2:35:58] and i said it's going to require a
[2:36:00] greater consecration from us
[2:36:02] than ever we've given
[2:36:06] and at the end of that experience that's
[2:36:07] all i could say things are not going to
[2:36:09] stay the same
[2:36:11] things are going to change and it's
[2:36:13] going to require a greater consecration
[2:36:16] we've played in the playground too long
[2:36:20] we've skipped along and we skipped along
[2:36:22] too long friends
[2:36:25] we've been too whimsical we've been too
[2:36:28] absent-minded but not anymore
[2:36:33] things are changing
[2:36:36] i don't even know what that means i'm
[2:36:37] not going to give you a time frame i
[2:36:38] have no idea
[2:36:39] we could be here another 100 years i'm
[2:36:41] not trying to put anything like that i'm
[2:36:42] not trying to scare you
[2:36:44] i'm just telling you what god's saying
[2:36:46] i'm telling you what's happening
[2:36:48] things are transitioning and they're not
[2:36:51] always going to stay the way they are
[2:36:52] now
[2:36:54] we're not always going to be able to be
[2:36:57] so flippant and so free
[2:36:59] it's not going to stay that way we're
[2:37:01] not always going to be able
[2:37:03] to to have such freedom and such
[2:37:07] frivolity we're not always going to be
[2:37:09] able to have that it's not going to stay
[2:37:11] the same as it is now
[2:37:12] it's going to change but it's going to
[2:37:15] require
[2:37:16] the greatest consecration that we've
[2:37:18] ever given
[2:37:20] and i for one want god i just want i
[2:37:23] want that consecration in my life i want
[2:37:26] to yield to him
[2:37:27] i want to be washed out i want to be a
[2:37:30] vessel he can use
[2:37:31] i want to be a part of what he's doing
[2:37:33] on one hand it's exciting
[2:37:35] on the other hand it's terrifying
[2:37:39] it's exciting to be a part of it it's
[2:37:41] terrifying to know what kind of life you
[2:37:43] have to live to manifest that
[2:37:44] and what it's going to take to get there
[2:37:46] is going to be an utter
[2:37:48] stripping down where the goldsmith beats
[2:37:51] and beats
[2:37:51] and beats and beats until all the dross
[2:37:54] is out and he can see his reflection
[2:37:58] i know things have to change in me i
[2:38:00] know i have to step
[2:38:01] up i know i have to go to higher places
[2:38:04] i know it
[2:38:06] but i know it's for me to do and i know
[2:38:09] he's calling us to it friends
[2:38:12] things aren't going to stay the way they
[2:38:13] are now
[2:38:16] the praise of god nothing's going to
[2:38:18] happen without you and i
[2:38:21] he's not going to leave us behind he's
[2:38:22] not going to leave us out
[2:38:25] but he's going to bring us in he's going
[2:38:27] to use us
[2:38:31] i've had on my heart for a long time
[2:38:36] i've been in a season of prayer god has
[2:38:39] got me
[2:38:40] in a season of prayer that's all i can
[2:38:41] say where i'm praying now more than i
[2:38:44] ever have
[2:38:45] and it's by his leadership because i've
[2:38:47] never been good at praying
[2:38:49] i don't know it sounds bad i don't mean
[2:38:52] it to be bad but i've never been one to
[2:38:54] pray for hour after hour
[2:38:56] or pray an hour every day i've never
[2:38:58] been that way but now
[2:39:00] it's easy for me to pray an hour god has
[2:39:03] just
[2:39:03] changed something inside of me and i
[2:39:05] know that we need to be more prayerful
[2:39:08] and i know some experiences that i've
[2:39:10] had in this last week happened during
[2:39:12] prayer and they were supernatural
[2:39:15] and so i've decided to open the
[2:39:16] sanctuary on fridays from one to five
[2:39:19] from 1 pm to 5 p.m the sanctuary will be
[2:39:22] open and a lot of fridays i come in here
[2:39:24] and pray anyways
[2:39:25] and it'll be open for anybody who has a
[2:39:27] desire if god's moving on your heart
[2:39:30] come and pray from one to five you can
[2:39:32] come anytime in that time
[2:39:34] and you can leave any time we're not
[2:39:35] gonna you don't have to stay here the
[2:39:36] whole time
[2:39:37] but if you feel a pool to come come and
[2:39:39] pray
[2:39:40] and pray at the altar you can pray at a
[2:39:42] seat you can pray anywhere you want
[2:39:44] but let's come and pray if god's moving
[2:39:46] you to pray
[2:39:47] so friday from 1 to 5 and saturday from
[2:39:50] 5 p.m to 10 p.m
[2:39:52] it's the same thing it's an open house
[2:39:54] come when you want go when you're done
[2:39:56] there's no obligation we're not going to
[2:39:58] be talking to one another we're not
[2:39:59] going to be having a service
[2:40:00] all we're going to do is pray and there
[2:40:02] may be one person there maybe 10 people
[2:40:04] i don't know
[2:40:06] but if god's moving on your heart i
[2:40:08] think this is a time to be more
[2:40:10] sensitive
[2:40:11] to be more prayerful than we've ever
[2:40:14] been before
[2:40:16] another thing i'd like to mention is i
[2:40:19] would like
[2:40:21] i'd like to see us in here quietly
[2:40:25] praying before the first song
[2:40:28] i like as a body of believers for us to
[2:40:30] all get tuned in to what's going to
[2:40:32] happen
[2:40:33] every service not walk in last minute
[2:40:37] what i'd like to see is i'd like to see
[2:40:40] service start
[2:40:41] 30 minutes before the first song
[2:40:44] meaning we just come and part of our
[2:40:46] service
[2:40:47] is consecration in prayer and
[2:40:50] preparation to hear from god
[2:40:53] preparation to worship i'll just say
[2:40:56] like this
[2:40:56] can you imagine if all of us
[2:40:59] spent 30 minutes in earnest heartfelt
[2:41:03] consecrated prayer what do you think the
[2:41:06] first song would be like
[2:41:11] you could just imagine it would be easy
[2:41:15] it would just take off
[2:41:18] but i think we need more not less
[2:41:23] now i understand you have children got
[2:41:25] babies not everybody can do that and
[2:41:26] it's not for everybody to do i'll just
[2:41:28] put it that way
[2:41:29] if you don't have a burden then it's not
[2:41:31] for you to do
[2:41:33] but if i say it and something in you
[2:41:35] says yes
[2:41:36] then it's for you it's not an obligation
[2:41:41] it's not nobody's going to force
[2:41:43] anything it's not that you have to
[2:41:46] but it's something stirring inside of me
[2:41:48] that i believe this is what we need
[2:41:50] more of if we could come together
[2:41:54] and pray come together and spend that
[2:41:57] 30 minutes of quiet prayer reaching out
[2:42:00] to god praying at the altar
[2:42:01] praying at our seats meditating on the
[2:42:04] lord preparing our hearts
[2:42:06] for the worship service and preparing
[2:42:07] our hearts for the word
[2:42:09] i got a feeling the dynamics are going
[2:42:12] to change
[2:42:13] and we're going to be more tuned in and
[2:42:16] more sensitive to what's happening
[2:42:18] so i'm just saying that i'm just
[2:42:19] throwing that out there for everybody
[2:42:21] no force no obligation and if you don't
[2:42:24] feel anything your heart towards it then
[2:42:25] don't come in
[2:42:27] it's only if you feel there's something
[2:42:30] right about that
[2:42:31] and something that i want to participate
[2:42:33] in
[2:42:35] i tell you things are going to change
[2:42:40] don't know when this may be a
[2:42:42] preparation that takes 10 years to
[2:42:44] unfold
[2:42:45] but whatever god's calling for now is
[2:42:47] what i want to be a part of
[2:42:49] it's something stirring and i want to be
[2:42:52] stirred
[2:42:54] something's moving and i want to be
[2:42:55] moved i want to be in the symphony
[2:42:58] i want to be in the rhythm i want to be
[2:43:01] wherever he's working
[2:43:03] is where i want to be this is what god's
[2:43:06] laid on my heart
[2:43:07] and this is the opportunities that we
[2:43:09] have for whosoever will
[2:43:11] and who has a desire
[2:43:14] i've asked sister naomi to come and sing
[2:43:16] a song sister naomi if you would come
[2:43:19] sing the song she sang last sunday the
[2:43:21] musicians can come to who
[2:43:23] will close out as soon as they're done
[2:43:25] musicians can come and brother jim you
[2:43:27] can make your way up
[2:43:28] you guys would but when sister naomi
[2:43:32] when i heard this song
[2:43:34] it hit my heart exactly
[2:43:37] what she's saying is exactly what god's
[2:43:40] been dealing with me in my heart
[2:43:43] and this song is very prophetic
[2:43:46] i can just say it that way this song is
[2:43:49] very prophetic
[2:43:50] and god is using different voices and
[2:43:53] different gifts
[2:43:55] to tell us the same thing and i don't
[2:43:58] want to blow by it but i want to pay
[2:44:00] attention
[2:44:01] to what he's telling us through all the
[2:44:03] different gifts
[2:44:05] because it matters so we ask her to sing
[2:44:07] this
[2:44:08] i think we asked him to put the words on
[2:44:09] there so we could see the words
[2:44:11] but this song remember is coming from my
[2:44:14] heart
[2:44:14] this song is prophetic amen
[2:44:18] god bless you
[2:44:32] too long have we been still
[2:44:36] [Music]
[2:44:38] feasting not acting
[2:44:43] hearing the warnings seeing the
[2:44:47] changes yet never possessing
[2:44:51] our land this
[2:44:54] man must change us to save us
[2:45:06] the showdown is near the storm
[2:45:13] and is can you hear the sound
[2:45:17] the music has changed the light is
[2:45:21] moving
[2:45:22] awaken and see the outline
[2:45:27] can we not pray for one hour
[2:45:32] to become desperate and more
[2:45:36] sincere the hour
[2:45:43] [Music]
[2:45:51] yet restless in our spirit
[2:45:56] [Music]
[2:45:59] from the beast of the field never
[2:46:02] looking
[2:46:03] up toward the sky
[2:46:07] spread forth your wings from
[2:46:16] [Music]
[2:46:23] is coming awaken and listen
[2:46:27] can you hear the sound the music has
[2:46:36] changed
[2:46:39] [Music]

[2:46:48] sincere the hour is
[2:46:51] late and now is the time
[2:46:54] to fly
[2:46:57] [Music]
[2:47:08] [Music]
[2:47:14] the life inside beckoning you too
[2:47:21] [Music]
[2:47:31] the music has changed the light is
[2:47:35] moving awaken and see
[2:47:39] the outside night can we not
[2:47:42] pray for one hour
[2:47:46] to become desperate and more
[2:47:49] sincere the hour is late
[2:47:53] and now is the time to fly
[2:48:01] the hour is late and now is the time
[2:48:08] [Music]
[2:48:14] to
[2:48:16] [Music]
[2:48:21] does the spirit inside you identify that
[2:48:23] that's the truth
[2:48:28] things aren't going to stay the way they
[2:48:29] are now
[2:48:31] neither should they things should start
[2:48:34] changing
[2:48:36] i want to give myself completely to it
[2:48:39] i want to surrender everything
[2:48:44] don't even know what to do next all i
[2:48:46] know to do is just lay down my life
[2:48:49] you can't push anything we can't push
[2:48:51] ourselves to anything we can't pull
