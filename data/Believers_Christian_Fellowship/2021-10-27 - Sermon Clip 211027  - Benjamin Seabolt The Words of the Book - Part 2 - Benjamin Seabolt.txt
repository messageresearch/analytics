TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so just relax be comfortable in what god has called you to do be comfortable in what god has given you naturally brother branham says most of the time people who have gifts don't even know they have the gift but it's p it's easy for other people to recognize it it's because they just see it and it's well that person just does that naturally but it's a gift they're not necessarily trying because it's god anointing that gift they don't have to try i would be worried about something you have to try to do for god if you're trying to do it i would be worried i would be i would be concerned because if there's not an anointing that just makes it work something's out of place something's not right the holy spirit flows brother and says the holy spirit is timid the holy spirit is not going to come down and just shove something in the holy spirit is going to flow it's going to work it's going to fit it's going to be natural even if somebody else is attacking that and trying to make it deviate or trying to take your place or trying to take away from your purpose god will deal with that if it's god's gift he's given it for a purpose he's not just going to throw it out there for randomly if he's given a gift it's for a purpose he's going to make sure that it finds its place you don't have to do that
