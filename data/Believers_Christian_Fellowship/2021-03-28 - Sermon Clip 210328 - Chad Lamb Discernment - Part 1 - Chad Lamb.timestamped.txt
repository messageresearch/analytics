[0:00] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[0:02] down for it is written
[0:04] he shall give his angels charged
[0:05] concerning thee
[0:08] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[0:10] up lest at any time thou shall dash thy
[0:12] foot against the stone
[0:14] oh i'm telling you friends that's a hard
[0:17] one that
[0:17] that is real bait right there amen
[0:20] taking the
[0:21] the very scriptures and jesus christ is
[0:23] the very manifestation of the word and
[0:25] the devil's using the very scriptures
[0:26] and what's he trying to do first he's
[0:28] doubting his identity
[0:30] and trying to lure jesus into having
[0:34] needing to prove his identity that's the
[0:36] same thing he did with eve back there
[0:38] and it says amen
[0:39] if you if god doesn't know that if you
[0:41] take this fruit then you'll be as gods
[0:43] and she was already as a god
[0:45] and jesus was already son of god but but
[0:48] the devil is putting a doubt he's saying
[0:50] if thou be the son of god amen and i
[0:53] wonder
[0:54] you have to ask yourself this question
[0:56] he said if thou be son of god cast
[0:58] myself down for the scripture says this
[0:59] it will be the fulfillment of the
[1:00] scripture
[1:01] i ask you if jesus would have thrown
[1:03] himself down and the angels would have
[1:04] caught him before he hit
[1:06] would the devil have turned into a
[1:07] believer and stopped asking questions
[1:10] would that have been his last question
[1:12] would that have been the evidence to
[1:13] prove that the devil needed to say yep
[1:15] you are the son of god
[1:18] if we would have done that then the next
[1:20] one would be another question well the
[1:22] other scripture says
[1:23] and another scripture says and another
[1:25] scripture said i tell you friends don't
[1:27] go
[1:27] down this road amen trying to prove your
[1:30] identity
[1:30] your identity comes through a new birth
[1:33] through a personal experience of you and
[1:35] jesus christ
[1:35] individuals together and you know that
[1:38] he come and he got you amen he called
[1:40] you well
[1:40] he brought you to himself and united
[1:42] himself with you that's your
[1:44] identification and nothing else
[1:49] amen that life then produces evidence of
[1:51] the life
[1:52] then there's workings that come out of
[1:54] that life amen but you cannot go
[1:56] amen to the workings amen to prove to
[1:59] yourself that you're son of god
[2:00] you've got to go back to the experience
[2:02] of meeting jesus christ
[2:04] personally yourself
