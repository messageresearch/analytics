amen and uh it's nice that brother Simon's jodan could go before and prepare the way we were around back he says that's how you do it here you send your kids first I said yeah if they make it then you can come out if it so praise God we certainly enjoyed their family we've got to spend some time together with he and his wife Maryam and their children we really enjoyed it amen I enjoyed brother Simon's friendship we've become friends over the last couple of weeks and it's precious the Lord has entrusted him over the last few years with a fellowship of Believers there that he ministers to and and uh I'm just excited to hear what the Lord's laid on his heart for us amen you know brother Simon has a difficult job because there's some Swiss in his church that speak Swiss German so he's used to preaching one line in English and he repeats the next line in Swiss German he translates himself I told him that's not necessary today we'll have a hard enough time with the proper English let alone the German but amen God's just given him the gift that he needs and the ability to minister to that group at this time and I just appreciate and he told me around back he says it's easy brother it's really no problem I said yeah so says you amen that's always the way it is the one who has the gift and ability imparted by God always thinks it's easy but the rest of us Marvel at it so I just appreciate the brother I appreciate what the Lord's done in his life appreciate his testimony he and his family and the light that they shine and I'm just uh excited to welcome him to come and and we just want him to be able to relax and what helps a preacher relax is when he feels that tug on the other side when he knows that now he's not in control that the spirit of God is taking over that's what helps a minister relax and brother B said it's up to us to operate the gift and so I want to make it a comfortable place where the brother can just relax and let God flow amen then we're going to invite our brother Simon with a song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Oh Turn Your Eyes Upon Jes Jus look for in his wonderful and the things of his Earth will go strange in the L of his glory and oh one more time oh just turn your eyes of Jesus look for in his wonderful and the things of this Earth will in the light of his glor praise amen let's just pray for good Lord Jesus I love you father we come here not to hear from a man Lord but we come to hear from you Lord put me to one side come down I pray I know you're in there Lord Jesus you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me I'm asking you to speak Lord just bring the word Lord in the inspiration that it came in Lord and bless your people father Lord Jesus I wish that I could repay the kindness they've shown me but I can't do that Lord I need you to do that Lord so we sacrifice ourselves Lord and we say Lord come and talk we pray speak to us Lord as we as we sit around your feet father each and every one of us feel your presence Lord feel your presence close and show us what you want to show us father we love you Lord we bless your name help us Lord in your name we pray amen Lord's good and I just love the Lord thank you sisters and brothers always feels a bit fancy if I would say thank you musicans I'm just a I can't believe I'm actually standing here to be honest I'm actually just a farm boy I was brother Ram came from Jeffersonville well actually um Kentucky but I came from a place called scabra God and it's it's Nazareth in England it's where I was born so I'm just me simple me and I just want to calm down before we start brother Chad kind of dropped it on me I like the way out there he says oh yeah Simon says it's easy make it sound like I'm bragging I'm I'm just it's just easy and you know brother Chad said oh I said we'll go we'll go hunting I I said fine fine he said oh do you want the 22 or the or the shotgun and I said well what do you mean he said well the shotgun is easier and I just said to him I said well brother Chad I said normally I don't really have a problem hitting stuff and he said o he said and he wnk he winked at whoever it was and he said ah he said then we'll give him the uh the gun with the bent Barrel well I've got a bit of a bent Barrel this morning cuz my nerves are here and that's makes it a bit more difficult to um to hit the target but it's not me it's him and it's all as well so we're just thankful to be here and I just like to greet the little church back home as well and um it's kind of miraculous how we got here but we're here and I wasn't expecting this on the way home from the old hunt brother Chad just dropped it on me you know when it was nice and relaxed just dropped it on me and yeah that's it so here we go so if we could please um opening scripture 1 Corinthians 13 I was at brother Jeremy's where's brother Jeremy where's brother Jeremy where is he there he is I was at his place yesterday and we started talking about the word with Brother John and that yeah I was thinking stop there otherwise I'd have had nothing to preach today so 1 Corinthians 13 if we could and I think my wife's more nervous than I am and she's been telling me she woke up this morning in the middle of the night and screamed at me don't talk fast but brother Jeremy had said to me yesterday he said we've got Africans and Indians and everyone Prett he said we'll understand you so I'm just trusting on that one but the Lord is good if we all just you know my desire is to point is to point the the bride to the Lord Jesus Christ you know brother manam was given that commission hunt my bride and then he talks about those younger ones that will carry on the message so that's our commission is to point towards the Lord Jesus Christ and that's that's that's what we want to do so if we're going to read if we can 1 Corinthians 9-12 9-12 if we could verse 9-2 scripture says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know but then shall I know even as I am known let's just pray over the word Lord Jesus as we come before you please speak to us we pray help us and encourages in your name we ask father amen so you may be seated the Lord's good so sometimes the Lord speak to us in various ways in different ways and you know somebody might maybe a testimony or something somebody will say something to you and you know that the Lord's speaking to you and you know maybe maybe the person that says it doesn't even know what they're saying but you know you know cuz you've heard it and you know that that came from the Lord amen and and it wasn't your brother or your sister it was the Lord so now this week I can't remember when it was I was um speaking to Brother John and you know we were just talking about how the word opens up and how we're just seeing in this day we're just seeing so much more seeing so much clearly and he said you know it's like the bar of Revelation is being lifted and then he said he just sort of stopped and he looked at and he said it's the raising of the veil and I knew that wasn't brother John I knew that was the Lord and so that's what we'd like to speak today the title we would call it the raising of the veil and you know when he said that a picture s of kind of opened up to me and it's not lifting of the veil it's not the taking off of the veil it's the raising of the veil and the Lord is and we're thinking of like this this marriage Veil this wedding veil and you know the veil is being slow like lift raised it's being raised and this message message the message of the hour is actually it's preparing the bride for the to to bring her to the wedding it's bringing her to a wedding it's calling her and so this wedding veil as it rises higher and higher it's going to it comes to the point where suddenly now we can see past the veil and we'll see face to face now I've never walked down the aisle with a wedding veil on I know when I got married I was silly and I think even brother Mike's got a picture of me somewhere with me wearing the wedding veil which is a spiritual type but I've never walked down the aisle with a wedding veil on but we'd like to look at that quickly as a as a nice little type I'm sure the sisters here obviously they know how it is and I can only imagine that as you're walking down the aisle it's kind of blurry because the old veils swinging left and right and it's kind of made of lace usually I think yeah you know but as you starting out at the at the end of the door you starting out and as a young Christian you're run your walk and you're looking down the the aisle of life you know and you're looking to your future husband when you become a Christian you become a Christian because you're following the Lord Jesus Christ that's the one that you're walking towards and you know in your heart even though when you come through those doors or you come through the spiritual example in your life as a young Christian you come through the doors and everything's kind of blurry is that is that right s am I talking nonsense here yeah fine so you come through the and you kind of you see a couple of guys at the front there where's Abby and this is prep talk so you kind of see as you walk through it's like kind of like is that Jack or is that Josh or whoever it is you just see two men standing there I'm just making this a story but you but in your heart you know that your future husband he's there so you know even though it's kind of blurry you're still walking towards him you know he's that you know it's him that's there amen and that's how it is for us as Christian you know you know you maybe can't see clearly with your eyes because you're still veiled but as you get closer you start to see which one it is you know I mean I didn't come out of a trinitarian church but maybe for the trinitarians as they're walking closer to the L it's like whoa whoa who there's not three there just the one you know but as you get closer you start to see more clearly and you're seeing the bridegroom am and then when the veil is finally lifted then you see face to face and then it as the scripture says you will know even as you are known okay so then when you're face to face you actually now you can see who you are amen you can see that you are actually a bride you can see and you see yourself now as he sees you now this is beautiful because when you're at the end there when you're at the start of the doors opened up and you kind of go through you couldn't see him clearly but he could always see you clearly it's beautiful you see see he always sees you now notice because he's not veiled he doesn't have a veil over so when when you jack You Know Jack he's not going to have this Veil over his face he's going to be he sees absolutely clearly he sees who you are and the Lord he sees us how we are it's it's the Naturals typing clearly you see the Lord Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega and so he sees you from the Omega you know I say this quite often but he do he doesn't see he's the Alpha and the Omega he's actually looking at you from the end am you know he sees you clearly because he chose you amen so when you come through the door you might just see this guy but he knows who you are cuz he's the one who chose you he's the one that called you to the wedding you know and he chose us from before the foundation of the world so before you even went through that door he saw you he knew you he's seeing and not only seeing you coming down the aisle but he's seeing you like there there in the New Jerusalem he sees you there so now as we coming down to the end of time we're coming down this aisle of life you could say and it's it's we get to the point in dis compensational time I think that's the right word I'm not so clever but we're coming to the end where it's time to kind of raise the veil you don't lift the veil back there you lift it at the front and and the time that we're living in is the time when we are starting to see him face to face and it's the time when we're starting to see ourselves who we are and we're starting to see him through see ourselves through his eyes you know it's it's it's who we are and what it means to be who you are and this is what we're trying to kind of you know it's beautiful like the word of God's like a diamond and and there's so many facets you can turn each and every way and you see something maybe a little bit different to help you and it's not a new diamond but you're helping to show and to see what the actual diamonds all about so as we think about title it's the raising of the veil I just love the word you know something just jumps out at you it just it just excites you so when I read this scripture yesterday I'd like to read verse 12 again verse 12 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known and you know I thought a glass it says here so see through a glass Darkly and here we know that in the scripture a glass the word glass means a mirror okay so this this this word and and the the Greek word would be o o optron and it means clearly a mirror it doesn't mean anything else it means a mirror so we're kind of we're looking into this mirror but I don't know about you but when I look into the mirror well for starters it's scary but if if I look into a mirror you know I I I don't look at I either look at the mirror or I look into the mirror okay but you know brother random says that the mirrors the word amen okay but here it says that we're not looking at the mirror or into the mirror it says we're looking through the mirror amen it says through and I checked it with the um it mean that's what it means it means through when you look at it and in the Luther Bible as well um it's it's through so we're actually looking through this mirror so the mirror of the word is the only mirror that we can actually look through okay to see ourselves we're not looking into the word yeah we're looking through the word to see who we are you know and when we see who we are through the word then we see ourselves as he sees us CU if I look in the mirror then I just see failure then I see Nazareth I see scabra but when I look through his word it shows me another birthplace it shows me another origin and it's not the gamy little Seaside town of scabra yes amen you know like brother R talks about the little boy who he he you know he he climbs the steps and looks in the mirror and uh I'll just read that I'll just read this is the only this is a quote out of uh things that are to be and brother talks about many times but we'll take it from here brother says Christians I may never see you see you again see it's been years since I've been here may never see you again line up with God's word look in the mirror he says like a little boy one time had been out in the country never seen a mirror he come to his Auntie's house he started walking up the steps he seen a mirror he seen a little boy in the mirror he kept walking up looking and he would he would wave the little boy would wave and he kept looking he'd never seen himself in a mirror so when he got close enough he turned around he said why mama that's me so brother brother Franco if you could uh turn on the uh I'm used to pen and paper I don't even do I don't I struggle to I struggle to drive my phone so I'm going to have a go with this one at home I've got a whiteboard the Lord's good so so so so we see like this this little boy the boy he he's climbing these steps do we get it on yep yep where's the that's it there sorry I'm not very good I'm not very good at drawing a there we go don't laugh at me okay he's climbing up these steps but we notice now thinking of what we said about the bride and the bridegroom before you know the one who's now watching this but tells this story about this boy the boy's kind of walking up the steps I could oh where do I start oh I can he got a DOT I made awesome so this little boy he's uh oh he's walking up the steps it's easier on the way board anyway so he's walking step now now now the point is is is that for the one who's watching this boy now so let's just say this some let's just say it's you you're watching this little boy and he's kind of climbing up these stairs now the little boy he starts weaving he's pulling his ear or whatever how brother J it and then suddenly he gets his Revelation that's him but listen the one who's been watching okay always knew that the boy and the reflection were one the one that's watching always knows that the little boy and the reflection are one and the same you know so so you know the Lord is looking at us from the Omega and because he the Alpha and the Omega he always knew that you and the reflection of the word is one of the same because the bride is reflecting the Lord Jesus Christ you see this is a mirror we look through the mirror of the word but what the Lord sees reflecting back is his bride and it's awesome so so so so the Lord Jesus he sees that you and the mirror are one and the same now but for the little boy it took time for the Revelation to kind of sink in and for him to get it right to realize who he was and you know I wonder if there was maybe seven steps you know what I mean I wonder if there was maybe seven steps and you know I wonder if I wonder if where is this thing there I wonder you know if the mirror on the wall wasn't kind of shaped like that are you reading me I wonder if that's what the mirror was shaped like amen you know because the bride's come up these seven steps she's come up these seven Church ages and at the top now she's found a mirror so now she's got the I sister Marin will be laughing at me right now because I am not good so she's supposed to be a bride the bride's looking into this mirror okay she's looking kind of I don't know if that's how you do it but anyway she's she's looking into this mirror she's climbed these seven Church agents is but now she comes if you notice and I can't point it out to you but if you if you notice the top step is kind of a like a longer step top you know and this is now we've come to the top because the scripture says that we go out to meet him so so there's this climbing up the seven Church ages and then we kind of walk forward let's just turn to Matthew 25 Matthew 25 6-10 Matthew 25 6-10 just read that quickly so Matthew 2561 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to me this is this guys this is personal it doesn't say all right all you guys just go out to meet him he says go ye out to meet him so actually the letter is written to everybody but it's for the bride to actually read herself in here so go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise givers of your oil for have gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while they went to by the bridegroom came and they that were already went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut so we've had this message go out I don't know about you but you know this the message that we've heard the message of the hour has been a lamp tring message this message I don't know anybody else who laid it down so clearly to clean up your life like brother this this this has been a lamp trimming message and we've been told to kick out all the junk of your life kick it out you know I didn't write this down but the scripture says the scripture says you know um come out from among them be separate touch not the unclean thing and then there's a little word in there it says and and he says and I will receive you that is not just for everyone that's got there's a clause on there so he will only receive you if you kick out all the junk it says come out from among them touch not the unclean thing and I will accept you so this is this is really a message that we've had so we've come to this stop stop step and we've been walking forwards now we been walking forward since 65 since the prophet left the scene we've been walking forwards now notice we've not been walking up steps we've been walking forward okay there's not another step we're going forward you see and if you notice it's exactly like it is in the Great Pyramid Amen in the Great Pyramid you come up the the seven steps and then there's kind of a walking forward to do and so you know we know that's the second Bible and it's just so perfect before you get to the king's chamber there's that the walking forward okay so so in this time of walking forward we've been kind of seeing through the wedding veil let's be honest we've been seeing through the wedding veil you know see for start people never even knew who Blan was until until he went the scene till years afterwards and I don't know about you but I went through most of my life just going to church and you know she'll be right mate she won't be right mate you know you just cuz you were see you didn't see clearly there was still that pull inside you but you didn't see clearly you see we'd been seeing through a wedding veil there oh yes well you see have had the wedding veil since I gave the heart to the I thought he saw you from Omega I thought he called you before he called you you might not have listened but he called you so we didn't see clearly who we were so it's been unclear for us at times and you know especially for for me for me in my life you know even when the Lord called you there there's that that process you've been going through even since even in the last year two years three years there's this constant kicking out and constant looking into the through the mirror of the word and seeing well actually that's not right and kick that one out actually what is it it's it's it's because we didn't see quite clearly and you know maybe you might get some religious fell and he'll say oh well of course you don't see as clearly as me well I just say well praise the Lord because if I don't see clearly it's because of the wedding veil and if I'm wearing a wedding veil yeah it means that I'm on my way down the aisle and if I'm wearing that wedding veil it means that he's going to pull it off one day so actually we can we can take comfort we can take comfort as long as we've got that wedding veil on it's going to be pulled off so be encouraged you know we we're on our way down the aisle we're on our way and we're getting there where it's the raising of the veil you know we're living in the days of the seventh angel when the Mysteries are made known that had to come before the the the the the veil could be raised we'll just read Revelation 10:7 quickly um revelation 10:7 Revelation it's just one just the one verse so we'll just read that but in days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now the Mysteries should be finished including the mystery of who she is okay including the mystery of her position in Christ am and if we notice it's truly only the last handful of years that that we that that we've realized actually the revelation of who she is and what it means you know he broken forth and we know that brother R said these things but it it wasn't clear to us it wasn't clear to me but like the mirror on the wall that mirror has been there since' 65 the mirror okay but I was kind of still pulling my ear I don't about you I was pulling and I was waving and it took that certain amount of time for us to realize whoa actually can this be can it be you know just sometimes it's just so too much you know we've walking down the aisle and we've come right down to the front here and don't forget just break it it to you gently Jack you can't walk further than here yeah this is the furthest you can get without taking another name see what I mean you can walk as far as the altar the only way out is to go back out that way and you're carrying a new name that's where we are it's awesome and we're carrying his name his name so as we get down to the altar now we're starting to realize who we are suddenly now we can see clearly and the bride's identity is being unve failed I mean think of it 20 years ago I don't know you I we traveled a lot so we heard a lot of preaching but we would hear like oh your bride your bride your bride you know everything's fine but nobody kind of knew what it meant you know but were way up the aisle somewhere and he was just like oh well everything's fine and the the veil was kind of swinging and all we knew was your bride your bride your bride but 20 years ago it wasn't time cuz we were still up there we weren't down here and so the unveiling of the Bride it has to happen right before the Rapture it has to because don't forget the Rapture happens after the marriage takes place because the marriage supper follows the marriage we go to the marriage supper and don't forget the veil is only lifted when she's married when the vows have been given yeah then the veil is lifted bride and the bride room it's a union of the two and you know they make their vows they have to vow to one another and a public ceremony takes place it's public it's not done in secret was brother R was was this St in secret no no this the bride the Lord Jesus veiled in flesh revealed in flesh once again here is it in secret amen I think brother you know said something about you know people driving past the um the road and seeing the church and do you kind of hide the sign at the front no it's not done in secret so there's a public ceremony taking place but now the beautiful thing is that in order now for the wedding to take place both parties have to be present both have to be present the bride that's here the bride has to be present am otherwise there's no winning but so does the bridegroom so you wonder why the Lord appears after 20 2,000 years how can it be because the wedding's taking place and both have to be there both parties have got to be there yes sir and so during these vows he Reveals His secrets to his bride and he through the word he's restoring her back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers we aren't talking about jumping and showing we're talking about the true Pentecost he's he's pointing her back to the original and you know he's telling her all his Secrets yeah and he reveals to her the promises the vows the promises that he's made he's reminding her of the vows that he made and then she accepts his word and the marriage takes place you know we're going to the marriage supper now we're witnessing this unveiling of the Bride in our day we're witnessing this we're seeing it we're seeing I don't know about you but I've spent three weeks here and I've seen the Lord Jesus Christ in flesh again I've seen it you know this veil of is being raised we're seeing who we are you know people might say oh yeah well I know who I am you know but do we know what we understand do we understand what it means do we understand what it means to actually be the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so now maybe if we can just turn the diamond a little bit and look at Who We Are are look at who we are what it means and so I'd like to I'd like to share something if we could turn to Genesis 17 Genesis 17 and I just pray that the Lord gives us Grace to see something a little bit to see from a different angle you know if we can just find Grace in The Lord's sight that he would personally to one of us to each one of us that's our prayer every one of us just to raise that Veil a little bit higher you see we're going to read about Abraham and we see that Abraham was a man of faith and he was a father of Nations he was all these things but maybe we can see something in here how Abraham and Sarah their relationship is is perfect type of Christ and the bride so we're going to read uh 17 1-8 and when Abram was 9 years 19 years old and N the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me be thou perfect I will make my Covenant between thee me and thee and I will multiply thee exceedingly Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant which is with thee and thou shalt be a father unto many nations of many nations neither shall my thy name anymore be called Abraham but thy name Shall be Called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make the exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in the generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God Amen so at this point in scriptures Abraham at the point that we' started at reading we started reading in chapter 17 and a happens 99 years old so the promise has long been given to Abraham okay he and he all this time he's been walking by faith but now something changes in Abraham's life and you know he started out when he started out in his life he was called Abram but now in order to fulfill this promise okay the Lord gives him Grace which would be verse five gives him Grace and he changes his name from Abraham Abram to Abraham amen so he's been walking by faith but he's been seeing through this veil of a 99 year old person can you imagine how much Faith you had to have the old veils swinging maybe Abraham that would be his gray hair getting in the wind and he can't see and you know it's like the bride walking towards her future husband you know he was walking but in his heart he knew he knew that the Lord was going to fulfill his promise he was just walking by faith towards something although it wasn't clear you know he Abraham had AB at this point Abraham had zero idea of how the Lord was going to fulfill his promise no idea but he knew that inside him something had to change something had to change and you know the the bride is exactly the same thing she's got no idea exactly how she's going to be raptured I've got no idea she's got no idea how it's going to how the body change is going to happen she's got no idea you know she just knows that to be there where he is something's going to change something has to change because in this body I'm looking through I'm not 199 but I feel it I'm not looking through a veil of a 99 year old person but if you imagine we're looking through this body as a veil and we're just thinking it ain't happening in this body it ain't happening you know what I mean something's got to change this Immortal this Mortal has to put on the immortality something's got to happen and so notice as soon as this promise now is given to Abraham it's actually in Genesis 12 okay Genesis 12 the promise is given to Abraham we were in 17 we'll turn to we'll turn to 12 in a minute in fact you can start turning to 12 the Lord once the promise was given in chapter 12 the Lord could never take that promise away am no matter what happened it could not change the Lord if he says something he's got to do it so This Promise had to be fulfilled let's read the promise we'll read Genesis 12 1:3 Genesis 12 1:3 now the Lord said unto Abram he's remember he still Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make Thy Thy Name Great Thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed that's beautiful now notice in verse one notice in verse one there had to be a change take place Abraham had to leave everything that he ever knew okay in order to walk with the Lord right and for the bride we're the same we have to leave everything that we ever knew we have to we have to leave father and mother we've got to leave absolutely everything and we have to to be one with Christ to to to unite with Christ we have to leave everything behind you know and Abraham was led to that land that was prepared for him and for us to go to that land that's prepared for us we've got to give everything up we have to give it up so now if we hold our hand just hold your hand in there and turn to Matthew 19 please Matthew 19 cuz we're going to flick back here in a minute Matthew 19 and we're going to read verse 4- 6 Matthew 19:4 4- 6 and it's the Lord Jesus Christ speaking here and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he this is very important now we have to we have to really remember this one have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so the Lord is pointing here now that a a change has to happen there's got to be a change happening you know for the in order for the two to become one you've got to leave father and mother you've got to talking a natural type of spirit you've got to leave everything in order to be United with Christ there's got to be a leaving of the old doesn't matter what the old may be you've got to leave it doesn't matter what you so in order to step into that new now notice once the two were joined they were one now one you can't separate okay and don't come with clever scientific what about the molecules and stuff we're talking about the Lord here you can't separate to keep it simple two shall become one end the story okay so now if we go back to Genesis 12 then remembering what we just read there then we see here in verse one that the Lord shows Abraham that A change is needed he says get out of your old life amen you know get out of get out of get out of where you've come from Leave it all behind and and I will lead you into this new land now remember that we want the Lord to raise the veil a little bit for us this morning yes sir we want the Lord to raise the veil of our understanding to see clearly now we notice that when the Lord Speaks now to Abraham and gives This Promise he only speaks to Abraham okay he does not speak to Sarah he speaks to Abraham right but all the time the Lord is only speaking to Abraham but we notice in verse 5 he says get thee out of the land he says you go but in verse five when it's time for him to leave we can read verse five the first part of verse 5 and Abraham took Sarah's wife so when it comes time for him to leave interestingly he leaves this place called Haron and he he take he takes Sarah with uh obviously it's his wife but this word haran actually means parched it means dry it means drought it means a parched land and so when you know we talk about leaving our stiff and starchy ideas you've got to leave the old dead stuff behind if it's dried out it's kind of dead you know whether it's a I don't know anything even a pizza even a pizza when it's dried up it's pretty dead but you know what I mean like natural things if if it's dried up it's dead so you got to leave the dead stuff behind and come into the new land you know brother brother Bam um in the original um spoken words The Original Seed he he speaks about coming out from Methodist Baptist Pentecostal he says they're all dried up there's no water there there's no life that's right you know and in order for us to to step up these steps and to go into this new land of Revelation Where the River of Life is Flowing we've got to leave the old dead stuff behind so now when Abraham leaves Haron which is the old we just looked at that he takes sah his wife now we've just read how the Lord Jesus reminded us that be even before Abraham in the beginning the two were made one okay so he he reminds us that from Matthew 19 they were no longer Twain but they were one okay they were one flesh so now all the time that these promises had been given to Abraham Sarah was automatically included in the promise sir you know the promise was given to AB Abraham but she was automatically pulled in because the two are one you know if we're spiritual we can't see where we're going because we the bride of Christ we've been given a promise we've been given promises nothing can change or take away the promise let's just turn to Romans 19 Romans 9 sorry Romans 9 let's just turn to Romans 9 Romans chapter 9 if we read 21- 24 please 21 to 4 half not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another un to dishonor what if God willing to show his wroth and to make the power his power known endureth with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make the the known the ve The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he ha a for prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles so now notice here the bride it says in verse 23 the bride has been a for prepared unto Glory that's right so the bride has been predestinated and the word predestinate isn't really rocket science that destination is preset it's predestinated so the bride been predestinated unto the glory Glory that the Lord has already prepared for us the glory is already prepared so now just flick over to Romans 8 over the page Romans 8:14 to18 Romans 8:14 to 18 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are are the children of God and if the children then HS HS of God and Joint HS with Christ you know what joint Heir is that's right I yeah I have actually when my Granda passed away we got a little bit of something that was a joint air that means it's you and somebody else and if there's two of you you get the same you know it join HS join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glor glorified together together that's right Verse 18 for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us that's just like that's just phenomenal so it says he the glory that shall be revealed in us now it's totally amazing and there's three points that I want to quickly make known or just to note there's three little things in this one little verse that we want in this one sentence that we want to just pause on look first thing is the glory that shall okay we're going to split it up it says the glory that shall shall is kind of 100% we can't change it shall is like you know that's it it's setting Stone it's Concrete in that's it shall okay the glory that shall no room for change okay second point is be revealed okay okay so the glory is being revealed it's being unveiled and the third point is in US in US so there is a glory that has to 100% he can't change there is a glory that has to be revealed in the bride of Christ you know let's just pop a scripture in here just to raise the veil a little bit let's turn to 1 Corinthians 11 1 1 Corinthians 11 1 Corinthians 11:7 and 8 I love this one 1 Corinthians 7 and 8 says for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image remember in the beginning the Lord made image in man in his own image okay for for a man ought not to cover his head for as much as he's the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man you know the woman is the glory of the man think about this the woman is the glory of the man you know I um I ministered to place once and uh it was it was beautiful it was beautiful and um I preached on um uh that's right the the the the harvest is the uh the Harvest is the glory of the wheat or something I think it was long Minds The yeah the Harvest is the glory of the of the grain or the corn whatever the point is is that when a seed abideth alone it's just a seed and brother John if he plants out his his oat seeds it's just a handful it's like yeah big deal but that handful the True Glory of that handful of grain is the Harvest see see the True Glory of the Lord's seed being cast out on the earth is the Harvest that's right it's beautiful so so then then the woman we've just ready the woman's the glory of the man so we've just got just think about these few things here now we've got we've got the woman's the glory of the man then we've got the no longer Twain but the one amen and then we've got the glory that shall be revealed in us that's right and then we've got the glory that's a for prepared that's right and if you kind join them all up then it's woohoo look holding these thoughts in our hand let's turn to Ephesians 1 we all know this scripture Ephesians 1 3 and 4 Ephesians 1 3 and 4 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings blessed remember blessed is past tense Ed at the end means past tense has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that's uh the Lord's showing us here that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world so now immediately when I was a kid and I heard before the F it was like cuz your mind just goes you know I mean and I can't I can't I've got to be honest with you I can't imagine that long ago you know I can imagine like yesterday maybe the day before but you know before the foundation of the world this is the Lord's showing us here look before anything ever started I saw you coming down the aisle before this all started before even the first Star Wars before the first Angel was created before he was even God and the first he saw you coming down the aisle if he didn't he ain't the Alpha and the Omega and he's seen from the Omega he seeing you and he's he's showing his our position right he's showing the position of the Bride and her position has been given before the foundation of the world because before the foundation of the world he said two shall be become one that's right and if two is one then your position in Christ Jesus before the foundation before anything listen this whole thing all this it's about you sir creation oh it's beautiful and the leades falling oh it's just it's about you it's about you it's to speak to you for you look everything was given before the foundation of the world and you know we know that the two are no longer two but one so the Lord's pointing us back to where the starting point of our promise when it was given we could read there in verse chapter 12 of Genesis when the Lord first gave the promise to Abraham but the Lord's pointing us back a bit further than that he's pointing us back to before the foundation when we were chosen in him to be joint Earth to become one with him that the two shall no longer be two but going to be one amen it's where our position in Christ started now notice we were not chosen by him we were chosen in him I hate to break this to you Simon but you can't choose how many fingers you've got you know what I mean I can't I can't choose I'd love to have like seven might make me more spiritual but you know I haven't I've got five I had no choice CU guess what when I was in the womb when I was in what I at was five we can't change that see see this this promise we couldn't change he's pointing us back to this immovable promise that we had no control over and this is the whole point this this raising of the veil in showing us who we are and where we are you know we talking about we're talking brother Jeremy last night about this the life lived there's got to be the Christian Life lived it's got to be some folks seem to think it's kind of like a thing in the past oh yeah she'll be right Carry On It Won't Be Right you see but if you've got that life in you if his life is in you then you're automatically going to live that life because it's not your life it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me that's right see what I mean the Lord's good okay let's go a little bit further now now Abraham's bride and I love this and I hope you catch it straight away Abraham's bride was chosen by God to be to to manifest to further manifest Abraham okay Abraham's bride was chosen CH to further manifest Abraham that's right so further manifestation of Abraham it included to be father grandfather but also included the grand grand grand grand grandfather it was the king it was the Nations gener generations of the S of the sea everything was in there just go back to Genesis 17 Genesis 17 sorry that we're flipping around I'm not I'm not sorry I enjoy flipping around the scriptures Genesis 17 we're going to read 6 and 7 again let just read that this is the uh when when when he comes back to to promise to Abraham so he says and I what did I say 6 to 7 and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between thee me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and thy seed forever notice I've just seen that now actually but at the beginning here here in Abraham 12 um up here the the Covenant was given you see in in Abraham 12 but now he says I'm going to establish my Covenant okay let's leave that one right so so look we see that all these further manifestations we've just read here okay they are they are in they're a part of Abraham's promise I don't want you to I don't want you to miss this now but all these things that are listed here they had one channel that they could come through Abraham's bride that's right yes everything that Abraham was and ever would be had to come through that channel which was Abraham's bride she was the chosen vessel that's right right The Chosen vessel to fulfill the further manifestation of Abraham I love that sir so now Abraham's bride is chosen okay now Abraham was given a promise and the promise couldn't be changed it could no in no wise ever be changed Sarah an only only Sarah was the chosen vessel no no one else no one else just read um 15 and 16 from Genesis 17 15- 16 just over the page and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of the people shall be of her amen the Lord's good yes sir so getting lost here so now even Abraham's bride because she's Abraham's bride even when she slipped and fell that would be in the next couple of verses even when she lied in God's face think of anybody else this is for the young guys now how do we do this brother Chad mate anybody else would be it's true move back to the more spiritual side just think about it Sarah lies in God's face anybody else would be no second chance but because the two shall be one right because she was in him at the point of the promise being given the Lord couldn't touch Sarah without hurting Abraham amen you see when Adam saw Eve okay and we were talking about this with brother Chad last week and see we say Eve but brother Chad was right when when when Adam saw Eve she wasn't called Eve you called their name Adam but when Adam saw her I'll read it actually Genesis 2 we've got a little bit of time I hope Genesis 2:21 to 24 Genesis 2 21- 24 it's it's it's very nice Genesis 221 to 24 and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now listen it's beautiful because you know when the Lord Jesus Christ was smitten on Calvary the bride came out we'll read that later on that's stunning that's just stunning see the Lord sets out these types that just keep following through and what is it pointing us back to who we are verse 23 and Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so now when Adam sees Eve his wife his woman when he saw her he says now now this one this is the one this this one is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh it's this one and you know there was plenty of animals around there was loads of them but he didn't say oh it's that one over there he said it's this one he says this is the one right you know and this it was bone of his bone flesh he knew that that came from him and you know for Abraham it was the same Abraham it was the same if the Lord had touched Sarah smitten Sarah a part of Abraham would have died that's right you see and then the promise couldn't be fulfilled because the promise the channel for that promise was Sarah so you couldn't touch Abraham because now Abraham knew and the Lord knew that this that she was bone of Abraham's bone flesh of his flesh that's right I'd like to read this beautiful quote um it's Abraham's Covenant confirmed and you know as as we read this you see you see how the the brother Ram is is is is showing this perfect type of Abraham and Sarah and Christ and the bride he's he's showing it now and I've done it in in orange and yellow and orange so that you can see it and when it's in Orange when it's in yellow he's talking about Abraham and Sarah and when he's in Orange he's talking about the Bri and the bride and then Abraham and Sarah and Christ and the bride he's flipping between the two because he so perfect brother says it's Abraham's Covenant confirmed it's 190 says when Sarah doubted God God would have got rid of her but he couldn't do it why she's a part of Abraham and now he flips on to Christ and the bride that's the reason when we do wrong God would slay us I would never come here to preach uh preacher Revival no other preacher could you'd never have a Revival you'd be cut off forever but he can't do it he cuts his own son if off if he does see be for the wife is a part of the husband they are no longer Twain but they're one and now he flips back to Abraham and Sarah so he couldn't have hurt Sarah without hurting Abraham so he had to take Sarah in then back to the bride that's the way God would does to us our sins he depart he he depart from us a long ago but we're in Christ amen see so he forgives us our sins Sarah all her mistakes see this constant just this flipping between because it's this perfect type the Lord can't Smite his bride without smiting himself when Adam saw Eve he saw himself and he said this is the one this one this is bone of my bone this is Flesh of My Flesh this is the one you know and when he said that it also then automatically he was laying the precedent I think that's the word for things to come and it included Abraham he was pointing to Abraham and Sarah he's pointing to Christ and the bride when he says this is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh that's right now notice when Eve fell okay when Eve fell she was still a part of Adam mhm she was still in fact when she fell she was still Adam so when she fell she was still a part of Adam and when he saw her in that Fallen State okay he had to walk out with her it's the perfect type of Christ in the bride because when Christ was on the cross he saw us all and he saw us in our fallen State and he went out and paid that ultimate price it cost Adam his life so now we'll just read we'll read from rising of the sun just read where Brother Talks in Rising of the sun this is beautiful absolutely says but God foresaw the bride in the groom Hallelujah see to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing did you know what you were doing when you were sinning no you didn't did you no you didn't no no see Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife see and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship it's phenomenal and so now remember that Eve was the further she was the channel through which the further manifestation of Adam was going to come there was no she was that chosen vessel she was the chosen vessel and so the further manifestation of of Abraham had to come through his bride which would be Sarah and so you know how is the Lord Jesus going to further manifest himself H see when how's he going to further reveal himself that's right it's going to be through his bride that's right and you know when you start to you go from being a young Christian maybe 20 I was raised in a Christian and oh yeah yeah yeah oh I'm bride yeah sweet yeah I'm sweet it's like no you don't know who you are see the closer sorry sorry guys the closer you get to it it's like this is it it's a bit like me preaching this morning it's like you know I'm scared of heights I'd love to go one of those like flying fox things and I saw it there in the thing and I thought oh man I'd love to go but I know when I get to the top I look down it's like that's how it was this morning she like brother CH oh you would you I oh yep that's fine Lord if that's what you've got and then you get here it's just oh the Lord's good but you see when you get here that's it this is it now this is it now there's a time when it gets serious there's a time when that's it now and we when we get to that point as the bride when we realize what it means suddenly it's like you know what if I'm going to carry his name if I'm going to be his bride if I'm going to be joint hirs with him if I him if the two are no longer one if if they're two if they're one then I better start acting like that you know then when when he places his word seed in us and and and and what what the bride's carrying then is actually a reproduction of the father and if we've got the father's seed in us then who we better be careful how we carry that let's just read spoken word is the Original Seed lord is good I just said to brother well down in Jeffersonville the uh a brother showed us around the church this is a six-hour sermon this one and the brother was saying you know brother Bron splits it into two halves and um it's phenomenal he he said I said we we'll break up we'll have lunch you get all have your lunch and come back and when brother Ram came back apparently the people were still sat in the same chair they'd never even moved that all that time unbelievable see the Lord is good and uh we don't mind sitting and listening to the word the word is good it's it's him it's him in us there just that we want more of him more of him so let's just read here he says he is the seed word in his body and he in US becomes the seed word in us what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he was poured into the church that's the power Just how about all the God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church May that is a high calling yes that is that's like now when you read that that's when you're standing at the front and and it's okay yeah this is it now this is it now this is this is like serious I'm walking out of here with a different name and if I walk out of here differently I can't be the same girl like I used to be I can't act the same anymore cuz now I'm married I've got to be it's a different calling and we walk out a different person and so when we read this all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he pouring into the church that's the power that is power right now watch remember God's law of reproduction now listen reproduction this word reproduction speaks of further manifestation further manifestation okay speaks of furtherment so remember God's law of reproduction now remember after its kind is that right the seed of Christ the word must come through his body whoa whoa whoa he said not the body of his bride he just said his body that's right which is his bride that's right his body it's got to come through his body oh are you getting tired all right just a minute now just hold quiet and pray I want you to get this real good he's wanting us to get this good amen I want you to get this real good I want this to grind down the seed of Christ must m u s t he spells it out must come through his body and he must have shouted his cuz it's Capital both not through a denomination but through a born again seed of the word it must come through now remember what is it Christ's seed how does how does my seed come through the body how does the apple tree seed come through the body the seed is through the body and church the church listen the church is the body of Christ is that right the Bible Church not just any church he he says the bible church pardon me see God's law of reproduction the seed has to come through his own body he can't come through another one Abraham's seed had to say this is it this one this is my body this is bone of my bone this is it's this one my my seed my furtherment has to come through this one Abraham said this is bone my bone my fesh this is Sarah this is the one this is and the Lord Jesus is saying this is the one this is my body my bone my bone flesh My Flesh that's right Jonathan's giggling at me this is my body the Lord's good it's funny when there's somebody else there and some might say something funny it's all good but the Lord is good you see the Lord's chosen us to carry his seed the furtherment so now the seed coming through the body it's talking of a further manifestation or a furtherment of okay so I've got three kids guess what they came through me they came through my body yeah which would be my wife and I can see all these beautiful families here and guess what brother Jonathan Samuel he's a furtherment of brother Jonathan and there's those like brother Chad's got grandchildren now where's little Henry is it back somewhere little Henry is he he's part of the furtherment of brother Chad see brother Chad brother Blake little Henry see what I mean it's this furtherment and as time would go on it would get bigger and bigger so this seed that the's talking about here is this further manifestation now notice if you plant a corn seed you're not only just going to you're not going to get a potato you're going to get a corn but you know brother um John I'm talking about brother John a lot because we've been staying with him but brother John took me out to go and see his cornfield and he planted this purple maze in like six rows on the outside it's some organic stuff that he wants to keep right so he said I said well why did you put it on that side he said oh cuz the wind comes that way so the wind's blowing across the field from that side it's all just a yellow Maze and there's six rows or 12 whatever it is on the right hand side the wind blows across if the wind of denomination and junk manmade blows across the church you're going to end up with mixed up stuff am well this wind blew across and even to the furthest point of the field isn't that right with John there's corn that's got little bits of purple on because of this cross pollination is that right this cross pollination just from the wind blowing the the seed of the purple one all the way across it's really cool but if you plant a purple seed you're actually going to get a purple seed as long as you Shield it from anything else it's going to give this purple seed so ju so just like Abraham now Abraham his further manifestation was Abraham it was all it was a part of Abraham and it came through his bride who was a part of him it was his body it had to come through his body and brother Ram shows us how that the church is the chosen vessel okay for this seed word to become manifested want to read another quote here is from um the same spoken word as Original Seed this is I love this because it's a um uh I've already read it I think that's right I'll read it again this is the same quote again he says now remember what is it Christ's seed how does my seed come through through the body how does apple tree seed come through through the body seed of the body and the church is the body of Christ is that right the Bible Church that's when he says that the Bible Church so all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into his body see he says here at the the topic says all all that was in Christ pour it into the church and now down the B he's showing us again we know this already but he's just reiterating the fact that the church is his body so he pours it into his body which is he's pouring in this seed which is the further manifestation the furtherment of himself and the body is you it's you listen the veil is being raised and you know you start to realize the gravity of the situation you start to realize the gravity of what it means you're going to leave in a different name you're going to leave with a different life you know you you've been chosen she's the bride is the chosen one to carry the further manifestation of himself you you've been chosen to manifest his life to carry his life the Lord's chosen his bride to show all his attributes ah yes that was brother Ram's life life that's nice what about you you know you it seems like some folks that want to pin everything on on on brother bam or on the pastor and that what about you you see it's nice that the pastor goes in in the Rapture what about you what about you you know listen I am just one of you brother Chad's one of you we're part of this body brother Chad's been preaching about the body you can't live without the rest of the body and if one of you is missing on the other side the body isn't complete that's right cuz if I chop off a tiny fingernail that my body's not complete you know I've got a few hairs missing you know but my body isn't complete now it was at some point but if you if you start pulling stuff off your off your body your body is not complete and so we are so important we're all this body and he has poured himself into his body and from the life of brother Bram and for the life of the pastor and for the life of the Evangelist down to the life of you it's all got to be showing same attributes the same manifestation the same characteristics it's got to the Lord's chosen the bride to show the world himself you know if you want to know what the Lord Jesus looks like in 2023 you got to look look look look around you look around you the Lord's calling his bride to he's calling to come and show off his glory remember the scripture read the woman is the glory of the man the woman's the glory of the man and the Lord the King of Kings he's revealing himself through his bride he he he wants to live through the bride he wants to he he he will he will because don't forget the scripture read shall the glory which shall be revealed in us he's wanting to walk in his bride the bride's a chosen vessel for him to further manifest himself as we come to a close could the musicians come please you know I'd like to read from spoken word of the Original Seed again and uh this is beautiful is pick up your pen and write you know the Lord tells brother just pick up your pen and just write and I bet his hand was hurting afterwards cuz it's beautiful he says uh I I just want you to WR real close to this here's where the spirit said pick up your pen I have to leave it I have I have to leave some of it go but I've got uh to bring some of it to you all right now here is what I'm going to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind that's Genesis 1 one these last days the true church Bride Comes To The Headstone it will be a super Church super race as they near the great headstone they will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image now image doesn't mean you know like this image image is his image who he is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be listen this is awesome they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God tell me you don't walk out of here different that's right tell me how can you hear that and not walk out of here different how can you hear that and not say Lord you know when the old speed limit said 55 and I and I always say well you know like I used to when I was young I'd say well it's more guidelines it's not guidelines that's what it says so you know well you know you know I mean that music I I do like to tap my foot and there's a quote where brother M talks about tapping his foot and well I like to tap my foot and I like to tap other things as well whoa whoa whoa when you go out of here you should be thinking Lord what's pleasing to you because you know Sister Abby and and brother Jack it's beautiful stunning and but when she goes out she's going to have uh and brother Brian I can see you smiling when brother Brian walked out of here I'm going to pick on you now brother Brian walked out of here you know his wife I don't remember name I don't know your name sister but she had suddenly this desire to please brother Brian suddenly this desire suddenly you walk out and it's not just like oh yeah we're mates we're best friends Suddenly It's like oh that's my head Suddenly It's like well how can I please how can I and see and you'll notice talks he says he says if you want to know how the church is look at the sisters why because it's the perfect type the woman is the glory of the man the woman shows what's inside the man if you want to see where a brother is where a certain brother is look at his wife that's true it's true okay so the bride will be so much like him they will be in his very image they will be one we've read all the scriptures they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God mate oh sorry I was told not to say mate the Lord's good you know so you know when we think about seeing our position in him it truly takes on a new level takes on a new level let's just read here uh it's it's it's pick up your pen it's the same it says then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas the Word of Promise in himself remember remember this listen The Word of Promise in himself do you remember we read um Ephesians 1 that we were chosen in him from before the our promise was given that Word of Promise was given before the foundation of the world Amen and here he's talking the Lord's telling him he say the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that's been written of him whoa he's talking about your life here he's talking about your life that you are going to fulfill all that's written of him read it as he did when he came from the Virgin womb type of the spirit womb now so will the Virgin now accepting his word be it unto me as thou are said though it was said by an Angel and while it was yet written word Isaiah 9 they will love him and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of Christ was his goes back down down one paragraph he says here is the secret the word is in the bride listen listen the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord listen uh J I've got to pick on you sorry bro but you know um Riley is is Riley Sanders okay so when comes in then she's going to have is it no so is that right I'm terrible with this she comes in listen she takes his name listen carefully when she goes out from that point she does everything in his name am that's right every action that she ever does is now done in his name that's right you see and if we're the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ then Absol without even thinking about it every every single thing we do is in his name am to carry on reading here it says they will only do his will I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord he's talking about you and this is even pick up your pen so we we this is this is the Lord is just telling you how he sees you talk about seeing through the word talk about the veil swinging but now you get there the veil lifts and you can see who you are he says no no one comp them different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not yet time so we can see that the bride has been chosen to fulfill the rest of what hasn't been done it's the further furtherment it's this further manifestation it's amazing the bride will have thus sayith the Lord or shall keep still it's him manifesting himself in you you know we're at the we're at the point when when this Veil is being raised you know we're not seeing blurry anymore the bride has been chosen to further manifest it can't see any more black and white further manifest the Lord Jesus you know she's the The Chosen vessel and the Lord's saying this one not another one it's this one this is the one this is bone my bone this is the one when when when when when when I was put to sleep and she came out of my side just like Adam this is the one this is the one the two are one chosen to the point where she will have thus sayith the Lord that means that when she speaks it's him speaking through cuz the only way that you can have thus sayith the Lord is if it's him speaking [Music] amen he's in her living out through her she's the chosen vessel just like Sarah when we saw the Abraham and Sarah you know and if we stumble a mistake like Sarah there's forgiveness there's forgiveness because when he sees you he sees himself he sees himself because Adam said this is my bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh it pointed to the Lord and his bride one last quote actually I'm just going to squeeze this one in it's from the rising of the Sun and this is beautiful because I love that with Adam when Adam was uh you you know put to sleep and the bride was taken from his from his side says here but remember he went there to Calvary he went there with you in him see God had never SE I love this God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one the same the same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride that is phenomenal so even when we fall stumble and fall he can't Smite the bride he can correct the bride he can chastise the bride am but he can't Smite the bride you know she's a part of him and if we can just see how many precious prom that we're a part of they're all pertain to us everything ey has not seen Ear Has Not Heard what's in store for us and you know it hasn't even entered into the heart of man what's prepared for us and sometimes I've said before in the past you know I think you know like there's some islands these these these crazy islands that people build you know if you get like some gazillionaire and you buy an island all to yourself and you build like this this stupidly stupid stuff it's just like but even though all that's there and like paradise just like par it's like but that's nothing you know even with all men's trying he cannot even enter into his heart what the Lord's got for us it can't even imagine what he's got in store for us you know and we can't imagine the glory that shall be revealed in you and it has to because it shall be revealed that means listen what's behind this piece of paper okay what's behind here you don't know dear I'm going to reveal it to you and now it's revealed see it's revealed you see but it was always there the P it was always there so to reveal something means that it's actually there and you're tearing off the cover of it so the glory that shall be revealed in you it's already there and he's gently tearing it away and he's raising up his bride of the last day and you will walk in his footsteps you will walk you will live that life you will be that testimony it's what you're called to do and he said You shall live that life the glory that is in you you might feel junky you might just say oh I've got no job and I've just this whoa whoa whoa you're shining that light wherever you are I'm just a stinky sheep farmer that's it yeah and I drive trucks we've got a building building business that's it that's it hey who am I the Lord's choosen listen he never came with show amen he never came with a show so for you guys you don't got to be showing brother cig there you know cutting the hair he did my hair brother thank you you know and he's there he's living that life he's living brother Jeremy and brother Jack and these others they're living the life and brother John wherever he goes people see is different what are you doing you Shin you're living that life it doesn't mean you got to start wearing robes or some stupid man-made idea no you just lived the life he's revealing himself he's pulling back the old Simon and he's revealing him that's what he does you know as brother Chad comes forward please you know we've read how we've been chosen in him since before the foundation of the world how that the glory the glory that has already been prepared it's a for prepared and we've seen how brother Ram brings out how the we were in the Lord Jesus on the cross and in Revelations 3:21 the Lord says that to the him that overcometh of latest here I will grant to sit with me in my Throne he doesn't say yeah yeah on my Throne he says in my Throne you can't get any more closer than being inside see what I mean see see we in his throne so how I don't know when I don't know he knows but all I know is that as we're getting closer it's getting clearer it's getting clearer we're beginning to see we're beginning to see ourselves through his word we're beginning to see ourselves as he sees us as he always saw us we're beginning to know even as we are known known of him amen he's raising the veil can we just pray together the Lord's good let's stand as we pray Lord Jesus we love you Lord and oh when we just see these scriptures and we we realize how humble how humbling it is Lord because you chose fishermen you chose this one that one Lord Jesus we're nothing Lord in this world we are nothing Lord Jesus but we just want to live for you and Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord you've chosen us to a glory it's not a glitzy Glory it's not a glory of the world it's a glory of you lord it's your manifestation I pray that if there's any here that that have their heart touched that they want to rededicate themselves to you Lord you know my story I rededicated myself Lord because I knew I wasn't quite right and I wanted to walk out of the building different I wanted to I realized I came to the position where I realized lord I can't go on anymore and so if there's any here Lord I pray Lord that you'll touch the heart and they'll rededicate themselves to you that they'll come before you and say Lord I want to leave this building carrying a new name I want to leave this building walking a different life maybe there's maybe May I'm sure that most all in here love you truly and and and they're your bride and but maybe some have just got that blurriness May maybe it's that Veil swinging Lord may they come Lord and ask you to raise the veil show them Lord because when we see who we are where we are Lord automatically when that life's in us we will walk right but we lord we've all been there we've all walked with that Veil swinging Lord and until we see clearly who we are we just love you Lord that's what we're asking we're asking you to raise the veil and I thank you Lord for those words just jumping out of me and touching my heart raising the veil as you just lifting the veil and wow we can suddenly see we're just so thankful Lord be with us dwell with us Lord this is our last service Lord with our Believers here Lord and we just say Lord as we go father just bless them Lord my brothers and sisters I'm so thankful they are family they're more than Brothers of their family Lord I pray that you bless them bless brother CH and the ministry in this place bless my brothers and sisters help us Lord as we are walking towards you Lord as we're seeing clearly we love you Lord Jesus we ask a blessing in your name father love you Lord Jesus amen amen God bless you brothers and sisters the Lord is good I love you all and uh I'm just so thankful that the Lord opened the way for us to come and yeah just family that's it it's awesome God bless you brother CH God bless you brother oh Who I Am Lord yes who I well I can see Lord who I am a part of my savior I'm a part of his word for it's re it's predestination oh it's predes all who I well Who I Am Lord yes who I am yes I can see now yes who I am a part of my savior a part of his it's a reation oh it's predestination of who I am oh praise God are you encouraged by the word amen do you feel like God lifted the veil a little more for you this morning he certainly did for me amen praise God amen that did me a world of good amen you see why we had to have a messenger in the end time why because we were seeing through a glass Darkly this this mirror of God's word that we were supposed to look through to see something it was dark it was obscure it was cloudy it was through through man's ideas being sprinkled in through thousands of years it had gotten obscure and it was hard to really see you could make out something brother B said they had enough light to see how to move forward but that was about it it was a gloomy day not day or night amen it was it was murky the glass was dark but oh God sent a perfect word at the end time Amen to clear away the obscurity to move away the darkness so you could clearly see through the word and what were you supposed to see when you saw through the word we thought when I see through this word I'll see Jesus Christ and that's exactly what we saw but we see him in female form now the manifestation of Christ in the end time when you look through this word is to see him in [Music] her she's reflecting him now to the earth I say oh thank God you know it it had to come by the message there was no way there could be another reformer there could be it had to be a prophet that that can take us back to the original intent of God's word so that we could see and that's why these things have to be preached that's why we so bad need what we heard this morning because until it's preached it's still obscure in our hearts I mean we know the message is pure but we still need to see it like we should brother benam was preaching he says I know you're not getting it like you should he goes I'm not getting it like I should I'm not seeing it like I should hey the word's been given it's perfect amen but I'm still not seeing it like I should I want to see it all the way in the fullness of his glory in the Perfection because when I see it perfect I will see me perfect and whatever I see is how I will act and how I will behave that's what brother Simon was teaching us at the end once the realization comes of this truth it changes us it literally changes us it's not a you should try harder not to be like this and you should try harder to be like that hey we've went through generations of that and that has utterly failed but what we need is to look into the mirror correctly and see who we really are and when we see who we really are the action will follow the Revelation and it's no longer I'm trying not to do this and trying to do this it's just starting to come automatically and as the word lifts us higher and higher and higher amen that life starts to manifest more and more and more so glad he's still lifting the Veil so that we can see clearly if it wasn't for re re revelated preaching we would be stuck we would be stuck in trying we would be stuck in cycles that we've been in in the past we'd be stuck somewhere along the way but how does God keep us from getting stuck he keeps lifting the veil he keeps revealing the word is it the same thing we've been preaching yes it's the same but different is it the same tapes yes same tapes but different the same books we read same books same Bible yes but different why he's lifting the veil off of it amen so that we can see right I'm so thankful I'm so thankful this morning he's still lifting the veil I thankful he's given us eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that he's given us this day but Simon was saying she'll have thus sayith the Lord or she'll keep still I've heard so many interpretations that will happen I don't know exactly what all going to happen as time continues on but I know one thing when it comes to the scriptures we've received the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication we have thus sayith the Lord on the scriptures yeah and to me we can keep moving forward with this word and if it's not in the word I don't need to make up a new Creed or a new doctrine I'll just leave it alone cuz I already have thus sayeth the Lord and God can always give more through the gifts but this we know for sure we have thus sayeth the Lord on the scriptures without that I don't know some say it could be this way that may be that may be right but I don't know what I know is this is thus sayith the Lord and without that I'll keep still amen God is good to us let's just bow our heads together thank God lord Jesus we thank you God God we know without you we can do nothing Lord God we even the preaching of the word would be impossible without your anointing and your inspiration and your spirit so we thank you but Lord also to receive the word would be impossible Lord if you didn't put something in us to receive with and if you didn't open our ears and open our understanding and oh God you've been so faithful this morning Lord to speak to us your word but also to open our hearts to receive it Lord we're so thankful God I pray that everything that was preached would come to a manifestation in my my life Lord me personally I want to take it personally that the higher calling would come to a higher life because I see it in the word Lord I see what you're trying to tell me Lord I I I I it's becoming more real day by day it's becoming clearer service by Service uh message tape by tape Lord I just pray God that you would continue to rub the eyes saav in my eyes that I might see what I'm supposed to see God I pray that as I yield my vessel to you that you'll take me Lord Lord and use me for your purpose in this hour God may you have preeminence for that's what you desire in this part of your great plan is to have preeminence in the people and you're getting it right now have it in me oh God we pray that you bless brother Simon Sister Miriam and their children Lord as they travel back Lord willing on Wednesday I pray that they would go back with a good report may they be refreshed in their bodies refreshed in their Spirit may they go back to their post a duty Lord to labor Lord amongst the bride there may you use them for your glory and prosper them in their way God we thank you for sending them our way for we've been benefactors Lord of their visit Lord I pray Lord that you would bless us as we go from here may we go differently Lord may we turn around and walk back those doors with a different realization with a higher understanding with a higher calling we ask that you would bring it to life inside of us in Jesus Christ's name we pray we thank you God Amen men as we dismissed I also just want to give a special thank you to the small family to Brother John and sister Jill for opening their home and hosting the abotts for 3 weeks God bless you for that it was really special amen God's been certainly good to us let's just sing this song as we're dismissed oh Who I Am Lord yes who I am for I can see now oh who I am a part of my saor a part of his word it's reel oh it's predestination of who I am well who I [Applause] am who I am I can see now I a part of my savior a part of his word it's a reel it's [Music] predestin can we sing on the road to I'd like to sing this song on the road to Emmas I think it's amazing on the road to emus there's a question in this verse how could he desire to have fellowship with me I love how brother John wrote the the other additional part cuz it it's no longer a question in this day like through the denominational ages there's such a question how could he desire to fellowship with me how could God want me and still that's our Earthly perspective that's the human natural perspective but oh we've been taken on Engles Wings a little higher to see into the back part of God's mind and see this this whole Revelation unfold and now it says in the last part now I know that he desires I know I know because I know I was always part of him I was chose in him before the foundation of the world this mystery of why he chose me it's all erased because I look at my conduct I'm not worthy I look at my Heritage there's no good Heritage I look at why how could he choose me it's such a mystery amen but now the Revelation is taking us all the way back before the foundation the world and now I know that he desires I know why he chose me I was part of him always part of him and always destined to come to this place wasn't my Merit Merit wasn't my Heritage it wasn't my Good Conduct it was all because I was with him originally now he's placed me here to fulfill this end time part of the Revelation and now I want to surrender everything I have to surrender to that amen let's sing this song together oh on the road to May three men walk that day as they reach their destination the to B the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread pouring wine I finally I realized the Simplicity of this now I know that he Desir to have fellow with me he revealed
