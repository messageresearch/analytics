service take one more service for us that wasn't originally the plan I wanted to be a a good brother and a good friend and share brother Daniel with another assembly in the area and as I called around because it's Thanksgiving weekend or Thanksgiving week Services were canceled other arrangements were made pastors were on vacation it didn't work so I decided to be nice and give our brother a break I was going to take the service I was going to let him rest but then after he preached Saturday night I thought I cannot let that brother sit in the congregation so I didn't say anything to him until just yesterday and I asked and he graciously accepted and was willing to come and I just I just so appreciated the way God has used him the word that the Lord has brought through that vessel has really blessed me and I just am thankful that he was willing to take another service and I know it'll be a blessing to you so we're looking forward to that you know he'll be staying over ministering

privilege to be with you again it's as much as a surprise to me as it is for you but I just knew about it a bit earlier than you that's all God bless you thank you brother thank you sisters God bless you amen just want to um greet you all in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ and it's been a real joy and privilege to be able to give something back to a church that's given out so much and uh we we certainly appreciate you all and love you all dearly we um we know that at one at some point we will not have to travel like we do but we'll be able to spend time together where time is not we're not limited by time but in the meantime we appreciate the time that we've had with you and truly all of us are just have just been so blessed to be here and be a part of you all for this short time and uh the fellowship and the love and it's just been super special for for all of us and and none of us are leaving here the way that we came we're all leaving very encouraged and inspired and we thank God for that I mean so we thank you for what you've done to our lives in the short time that we've been here and we just want to encourage you to keep pressing the battle keep encouraging one another through through songs truly a blessing brother and sister it's fabulous and we we thank the Lord for the gifts that he places within his body and may you continue just to encourage one another and and be encouraged by one another and truly appreciate brother Chad and his love and generosity to us we um you know we it's so much so that we feel a little bit awkward in in the amount of things that he's laid on us you know but uh nevertheless we'll take it so thank you all amen amen Let's uh turn in our Bibles and light to the the book of Jude I'd like to read from from three places and I just like to spend a little bit of time here tonight on speaking about the the token life the token life I I haven't um ministered this thought anywhere before so just the Lord just started dealing with uh me with it today and I just want to allow the Lord to have Liberty and may He bring to you tonight what you have need of and uh the the wonderful thing about the Lord is that we may not all have the same need but he has the unique ability that he can meet more than one need at once I struggle to meet my wife and my daughter's need at the same time but God can meet a hundred people's needs in one time and then that's that's the God we serve so we uh we are thankful that we are not real you're not relying on me I hope you're thankful for that because I'd have to deal with you one at a time and perhaps I'd be able to meet some people's needs and not others but the Lord in which we believe is present here tonight he is able to meet each and every need amen every need that's here tonight he's able to meet it tonight so we want to thank him for this opportunity that he has given us to understand that we are in his presence amen and I don't know your need but he knows your need I don't even need to know your need he knows your need all I've got to do is surrender to the one that knows your need and then he can meet your need so I I trust that I would find Grace in God's sight tonight just to once again allow him to minister through this vessel of clay and uh meet each and every need I just want to read a portion of Jude um chapter 1 verse 14 just a part of that verse there it says and Enoch also the seventh from Adam that's all we're going to read from that we just want to take the the point here the scripture is telling us that Enoch was the seventh from Adam if we can go to the Book of Genesis Genesis chapter 5. told by the Franco last service you know once a man um gets his microphone in place without needing help it's time to go home well tonight he didn't even check so I think it's time to go home Genesis chapter 5 verse 21 and Enoch lived 60 and five years and we got begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begapped Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him if we can go to the book of Hebrew Hebrews as well Hebrews chapter 11. verses 5 and 6. you understand that this is the by faith chapter Hebrews 11. verse 5. by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his testimony for sorry before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen our heavenly father we bow our hearts before you this evening Lord God we we understand Lord Jesus that you know our our desires you know our needs Lord God we pray Heavenly Father by your grace that you would just meet each and every need in this building tonight may we leave this place Lord not the same as what we came in but may we leaving courage Lord may we leave strengthened through the ministry of your word we pray in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen you may take your seats tonight so I don't want to spend too much time looking at this thought here in the book of Jude but just to get a bit of context a bit of depth to what we are speaking on tonight we understand that Enoch was the seventh from Adam and we understand that out of the seventh Church age by the voice of the seventh angel that there was a bride that was going to be that was going to come forth as a result of that seventh Angel's message we understand that Enoch is is our type and Enoch was translated and to put that into our terms today Enoch was raptured so we understand that Enoch had a rapturing faith so Enoch being our type we understand that we feel within ourselves that the the body changes is almost upon us we we understand that the the Rapture is a process but we un but just to allow me to say it this way we understand that the Rapture is is just around the corner the conclusion of it all is just around the corner we understand that in order for us to be raptured we must have what Enoch had and that is a rapturing faith amen and we understand that that rapturing Faith was going to come from the word of God in which we have received it cannot come from anywhere else our faith is in God's word amen so we we understand our type we understand what we have need of we understand that in any time there that there will be a people who will not see death but there will be a people who will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and we will receive our body change um as a result of our faith in which God is giving to us we see here What God Says um about Enoch he's the scripture here gives a testimony of Enoch and Enoch's testimony was as simple as that Enoch walked with God amen so it's it's a very simple testimony that God has recorded within his word that simply Enoch walked with God until he walked home he he walked home you know so we understand that this is also um what our testimony is going to be but it amazes me at the simplicity of Enoch's testimony the in in Hebrews chapter 11. it it doesn't say um by faith Enoch was translated that he should see that he should not see death but and was not found because God had translated him for or because he built the pyramids you know the Simplicity of Enoch's testimony is something that we can all relate to because if it had a sin if God had said because Enoch built the pyramids Enoch was translated Well we'd all be building our own pyramid yes so God God gave Enoch such a simple testimony and yet Enoch did Mighty things I mean he was the one who built the pyramids and yet God doesn't actually record that what God recorded was that that Enoch walked with God and was not so he walked by faith so this Enoch's walk really pleased God all right and it wasn't that it got uh Enoch pleased God because he built the pyramids but Enoch pleased God because Enoch walked with God all right Enoch walked with the Supernatural and I'm going to use that word a little bit tonight the supernatural because I believe it's important because the token life is a supernatural life so Enoch walked with God and God was the supernatural element in Enoch's life all right so Enoch walked with the supernatural we understand that Enoch did not always walk with God that the scripture says that that Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah all right so there was a period of time that Enoch did not walk with God but when he did walk with God it pleased God to walk with Enoch amen it pleased God to walk with Enoch it says that Enoch walked with God but you you've got to understand that if I walk with my wife my wife is also walking with me so we can flip this over and say that it pleased Enoch to walk with God but it pleased God to walk with Enoch amen and I believe at this time that through a relationship that God has formed with you as his elected lady that it pleases him to walk with you amen it pleases him to walk he takes he takes pride in Walking With You amen and I find great comfort in him walking with me it pleases me to be able to walk with him so there was a portion of Enoch's life where he did not walk with God and Enoch was our type so we understand that there is a portion of our life in which we did not walk with God but at an appointed time God desires to walk with you we understand we've been looking at Abraham or Abram as it were in the beginning it God desired to walk with Abram amen and God desires to walk with each one of us and God desired to walk with Enoch and I think you might say Enoch a little bit different to that but that's how we say it but God's desire was to walk with Enoch God's desire is to walk with you his end time bride and through that relationship we are simply going to walk from here amen it's not something that God desires to do and then he leaves us and say well good luck to you I hope to see you after the body change you know he's here with us how can we walk with God and God not be here because this is our type a man Enoch is our type how could Enoch walk with God if God wasn't with him God was with him therefore Enoch could walk with God amen and this this end time bride you as that end time bride as an individual the reason that you can walk with him is because he is here amen because he is here we can walk with him I believe that where God placed the focus in Enoch's testimony is the place that he wants us to focus today the focus is that Enoch walked with God this is the focal point of the testimony Enoch walked with God and was not all right so the focal point was not the pyramid or the things that God had done through Enoch but it was the walk that Enoch had with God that God focuses in on in his life of all the things that God could have focused in on God focused in on Enoch's walk with him it pleased God that Enoch walked with him amen I believe that's where God wants us to focus on tonight or in our lives is the focal point is the fact that God is walking with us amen the token life is with us we are walking with that Supernatural element of God amen if we understand who we're walking with then we have nothing to fear you think about this in a father-son relationship you know when your children are are little you know the son holds the father's hand and he ain't afraid of anything because he he has that childlike faith and he has confidence in who he is walking with it doesn't matter where where they walk it doesn't matter what things surround them when they're walking there's complete faith that child has complete faith in his father's ability to lead him through whatever he is being led through that son relies upon the strength of his father to get him or carry him through he relies upon the vision of his father because the son may not know where he's going but really he doesn't need to know where he's going because he's not walking alone there's someone greater than him there amen and to a son that is the supernatural the dad will fix it Dad can do it as long as I'm with Dad I have no fear I I don't need to worry about anything I'm relying on his vision to get me through I'm relying on his strength to get me through I'm I'm resting in his ability to get me through I think this is a wonderful thing because we know portions of uh we we know portions of our walk but there's parts of our walk we don't know but we don't need to worry about the parts that we don't know if we know who we're walking with amen because God is not a hiling when Trouble Comes he doesn't run when Trouble Comes I run and his hand gets stretched he says now stay here stay with me it's okay and he reminds me of who I'm with and so God is not a hiring God is not someone who leaves us when trouble strikes but God is someone who protects us he guides us he brings his vision to pass for us as we walk with him so this is what I believe God is wanting us to see in the testimony of Enoch there is no doubt that the pyramid was was a great thing to this day they don't fully understand how these pyramids were built so we can understand that there was a there was a supernatural element to what Enoch did all right and that Supernatural element to this day is still not understood by mankind and there's that Supernatural element is the same yesterday today and forever that Supernatural element is here still tonight and we may not realize it but people are not gonna understand the supernatural element that is here today as much as they did not understand the supernatural element in that pyramid amen they're not they're not going to understand it we'll get to that a little bit a little bit later on because what I want to where we are going with this tonight is what does it mean to apply the token that's where we're going with this Okay so we want to put the focus where God puts the focus God put the focus in Enoch's testimony on the walk not was not what was produced but on the walk all right because it because the wolf who was walking with Enoch the walk that your walk is the most important part of your life your walk with the Lord is the most important part of your life all right what is produced as a result of that walk is another thing altogether but the important thing is the walk your walk with him all right now I believe that Enoch knew who was walking with him I believe Enoch knew this he he knew who was walking with him he knew the supernatural one was with him what would it be like if Enoch's testimony read like this and Enoch built the Great Pyramid but knew not God was with him that would be a sad testimony right because again even on the negative the focal point is the walk you know if and Enoch built the Great Pyramid but knew not that God was with him that's a sad testimony all right because you've missed Enoch missed the focal point and the focal point was not the pyramid all right it's like a church the focal point is not the church all right the focal point is not your home the focal point you can you can live under a a piece of iron and it not matter if your focal point is in the correct thing and that is I walk with God but I live under a sheet of iron it makes that difference to me what I live under as long as I'm walking with God amen so the we we we thank God that Enoch's testimony is not like that because Enoch is our type amen so it means that the bride's focal point is on the walk this is where our focal point is going to be and I believe if you would uh if you were to ask Enoch when you when we get to that place where we can talk with Enoch you say Enoch how did you get here well he's going to say I walked with God he's not going to say I built a pyramid he's going to say I walked with God all right and I believe that this bride is going to have the same testimony that what Enoch did and she's not going to say well I did this and I did that and I did this and I did that she's just going to say I walked with God and the only reason that I could walk with God is because God decided to walk with me amen we love God because he first loved us we walk with God because he first walked with me amen so the only reason that I can do what I'm doing Walking with God is because he chose to walk with me all right man can tend to put the focus on what is produced but God puts the focus on who produced it there's there's no point in experiencing the supernatural if we don't see the supernatural one who produced the supernatural I meant the whole purpose of the Supernatural is that you might understand and that the supernatural one is here amen and he is the supernatural one is here you're looking at natural I'm looking at natural but I believe by faith that the supernatural one is here tonight amen the supernatural one is the token life the life of the token is a supernatural life okay the supernatural life the prophet of God says in the token he says Israel's Lamb slain was the requirement of Jehovah to escape death there must be a substitute death and Jehovah required the slain lamb and the blood was a token that the requirement had been made now the blood was a sign that something had died and the blood itself was the token it was saying that this house has met the requirement requirements of Jehovah's word and therefore it is protected by this token that our Fair has been paid what a beautiful type here Christ is to this what a type of our token today so we understand that the prophet he was speaking about Israel that when they were in Egypt Egypt and it was a time when the death angel was passing through the land but God gave them a token which was the blood of a natural lamb that was applied to the doorpost and lintel okay it was applied to the doorpost and lentil and once it was applied there was a life that could be lived after the application of the token that could not be lived before the application of the token all right so there was a time when Enoch walked without God but then there become a time when Enoch walked with God there was a life that was Enoch was able to live without with God that he could not live when he was not walking with God there was a life that was able to be lived in Israel in those humble homes in when Israel was stuck in Egypt that was able to be lived as a result of the application of the token that God had given them God had given them the token but the token had to be applied once the token had been applied they could live a life now that they couldn't live before because before they lived in fear but the death the the the token bought or eradicated fear once the token was applied fear was gone I meant so Israel needed a token it was God's requirement and God meets his own requirements amen we understand that this is not something that Israel could produce for themselves it had to be something that God revealed it had to be something that God provided it had to be a token that he provided for them and revealed it through that Prophet Moses amen so once the token was revealed then the token had to be applied and then there was a life that could be lived as a result of the token being applied that could not be lived without the token because Israel if the token wasn't applied Israel was going to come under the same curse that Egypt was the only protection was the application of the revealed token oh it's beautiful the only the only protection they had was the application of the revealed token to their home amen the father had to apply the token to the doorpost in Lino it could not be applied to wherever he thought it would look good or wherever he thought it would work it had to be applied to the right place amen so we we we thank God that he has given us a token [Music] the token has a supernatural element meaning that while the death angel had access to every house where that token was not applied the death angel could not gain access to the home that the token was applied amen so that token had a it looked natural but it had a supernatural element the Scarlet thread looked natural but there was a supernatural element to the token amen The Profit goes on here now we have a token in this day we've been given a token which is the any type of that token of that natural token with being given the supernatural Supreme token amen the supernatural Supreme token all that all that that foreshadowed has been given to this generation has been has been given the token now we have the Holy Ghost is our token and it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus just a human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in flesh amen so we see here that there was a supernatural element to Jesus amen his life was the was the token amen there's a supernatural element just like it looked natural but it was more than natural it was Supernatural all right the Scarlet thread that was revealed to a Rahab it looked natural but there was a supernatural element all right Jesus looked like any other man he looked like you he looked like human as he looked like Peter if Peter stubbed his toe and and Peter's toe bled well if Jesus stopped his toe Jesus told bled if Peter got weary Jesus got weary Peter got headaches Jesus got headaches all right so there was a there was a it looked natural but it wasn't and that Supernatural element to him is still not understood today but it is understood by some amen but it's not understood by others all right so let me finish this quotation but it was God himself manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are Sons and Daughters of God that is the token it's our identification the Passover it's our identification that we have believed God and God has accepted so we see here that the Holy Ghost is our token it's the supernatural Supreme token which is the life of God in The Believer all right the token allows us to live a supernatural life and the more we surrender the more the supernatural can flow from us the more I Surrender the more of the supernatural that Supernatural life can express himself because as we saw over the last Services God can only express himself to the level that you surrender amen so you surrender yourself to the level that you surrender yourself to the supernatural one is the level that the supernatural one can express himself through him we do not need to fear the death angel is moving in the land but we do not need to fear because there is a supernatural element to you as an individual the supernatural element to you is not because you attend Living Word Fellowship in Australia but the supernatural element to you is because you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life who has sealed you until the day of your Redemption amen he is the supernatural element in your life every demon I was going to say in hell but brother Les was saying that the on the weekend that the the um there's no demons in Hell anymore they're all on Earth every demon from hell is against you amen but you do not need to fear you do not need to know the name of every demon because that's not my focus my focus is on who are you walking with who is walking with me amen under that token I do not need to worry about my children all right when when the fathers in the of of Israel when they were in Egypt when they applied that token they did not need to worry about their children the children were as secure as they were right because that the the the the the the token that was applied was applied to the house it was applied to their children also okay so they didn't need to worry about their children because the token in my in my life is applied to their life and we understand there's a time in in adolescence when children take responsibility for their own lives and they need the revelation of the token themselves and apply it to their own lives but as I'm talking about young young children I don't need to worry about you don't need to worry about your children if you have young children if the token is applied to your life then you don't need to worry about the demons around that want possession of your children because the token has been applied to your life amen the the father brother Brown dramatizes this you know in in when the token was applied in Egypt to the to Israel homes you know the sun would walk up to the father and say Daddy are you sure and and brother Brown said he'd pull his glasses down and put him on the end of his nose and and and dropped the newspaper down and said son I am certainly sure you have nothing to fear the token has been applied amen so there's a supernatural element that that is involved in family life there's a supernatural element that was involved in that father's life and there was a supernatural element that was involved in his in his wife's life and there was a supernatural element that was also involved in his children's life amen so what the token was was a security it was it was it was perfect love it was something that cast out fear I don't need to fear anymore why because perfect love the Holy Ghost it's it's here it's been applied to my life I don't need to worry I don't need to fear greater is the token than he that is in the world amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater is the token that that is that has sealed you until the day of your Redemption than he that is in the world amen so we we thank God for the token the token must be applied if the token is not applied then it's of no benefit the token must be applied the Lord said to Israel he said when I see the blood the token I will pass over you amen so the token had to be applied and the prophet of God picks this up in the token he says the blood was a token or an identification identifying this people has been redeemed now we'll notice they had they they were redeemed before there was anything had happened by faith they applied the blood see before it actually happened the blood was applied by faith believing that it was going to happen see before the wrath of God passed through the land the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the Roth had for the Roth had done fallen so the prophet's making a point here that the blood has to be applied before the wrath of God falls on the Earth amen if the token is not applied before that then it has no effect on your life amen when he come when he becomes both judge jury and attorney he pleaded our case we found guilty by his own law and he come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary he took his sin he took it upon himself and died and paid the price and shed his blood and give back his own token his own life why we are perfectly the case is dismissed there is no more sin to the believer oh God have mercy if the people can't see that that there is no more case he has he that heareth my words and believeth on me that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment that has passed from Death unto life there is the case case dismissed no more case to it amen then safety safely safely with the token applied When Death begins to Smite against the door out there it has no control see yes the token is applied only the token is recognized see he did that so that the token could come the token was God's life amen so we we know we notice here the prophet is is explaining to us that the effects that the token has in our life and we notice here that through this token through that sacrifice God has freed us from our past he has set us free from our first birth I meant we're no longer under bondage or under condemnation or under guilt that came through our first birth he said he took our place there is no case he said case dismissed amen so now before case dismissed you could live a certain life but you are living a life as as a guilty one but when he says case dismissed now you God has given you the ability to live a life that you once could not live amen but through that sacrifice he he says case dismissed not guilty he became me so that I might become him by faith amen so now there's a life that can be lived that I couldn't live before as a result of what God has done for my life in my life sending me back his own life upon me amen the application it must be applied the token must be applied unless the token is applied then it's not going to produce anything it's powerful all the elements are in it the supernatural element is in it but it must be applied amen because without it being applied the supernatural element of the token cannot come forth without the supernatural element in my life without the token in my life I die the same same curse that every other father dies I die the same curse that every other husband dies right because the token is the only difference right the token is the only difference the only difference between Israel and Egypt was that there was a token that was applied amen and the only difference between the the elect and the non-elect is the fact that there's a token that has been applied she has applied the token to her life amen and that brings our freedom it costs out fear because I don't need to worry because I know who I'm walking with I I don't need to know the curses of the world I don't need to know the that there's there's more sickness in the world it seems than there ever has been in in history but I don't need to know about it I don't need to worry about it because I know who I'm walking with we could say this the life that I now live like Paul said he said the life that I now live meaning that once upon a time I didn't live this life but the life that I now live I live by the faith of the token amen I live by the faith of the supernatural amen which is God's own life it's the life of God living through me it's not my own life but it's his life in me it is God living in you through you it's magnificent amen we looked at this over the over the weekend God manifesting himself God in you greater is he that is in you amen then he that is in the world the token the token life is greater than any anything else it's greater than any sickness it's greater than any disease it's greater than anything else it's it's the greater it's the greater it's it's God in you it's the token life living itself in you as husband wife mother father daughter son etc etc amen Rahab had a token Israel had a token Tamer had a token but they had to apply that token the token they were given had to be applied and this end time bride has been given a token amen but if you want to know how how great this token is apply it because when you apply the token you will see the supernatural element of the token in your life it must be applied the token must be applied it's not we can Rejoice because we have a token but it must be applied just to Rejoice because we have a token is not enough the Reason God gave you the token is to apply it to your own life and meant to apply it to the doorpost a little of your own life amen again the prophet of God says here sorry to skip through this he says I don't care you might have cast out Devils you might have healed the Sick by a prayer of faith you might have done all these things but if the token is not there you're under the wrath of God so where's the focus the focus is where is the token amen the focus is where is the token the focus is not on on the the healings and wonders even though that's a part of our life but that's not the focal point the focal point is where is the token it's the same in Enoch's life the folk the focus was not the pyramid the focus was where was the token where it was God I mean God was with Enoch Enoch was with God they were walking together amen so so the we need to have put focus on the things that God puts focus on President Branham explains this whenever the scripture says verily verily he says God is trying to get your attention pay attention because there's a God wants you to listen God wants you to see God wants you to understand what he understands and he wants us to put Focus where he is focused if the token is not there you're under the wrath of God so the only thing that stops us from the wrath of God is the token is the application of the token you might be a believer you might stand in the pulpit and preach the gospel many will come to me in that day saying Lord Lord have not I prophesied in your name preached in your name have not I cast out devils in your name that's both Methodist Baptists and Pentecostal and message it is just because you affiliate with something doesn't mean you have the token the token is a revelation because there's too many people affiliated with the message that don't have the token but God desires to give you the token all right otherwise we have this group mentality otherwise we're we're Stronger by numbers but when you get alone in your at home when you're left alone you fall into error because you you only time you're strong is when you're with people there's something wrong we should be as strong as when we're with people as what we are when we're alone why because our strength is not our self our strength is the token amen the token is our protection amen Jesus said depart from me you that work iniquity I never even knew you but when I see the token I will pass over you it's God's requirement for the hour the evening time message is to apply the token amen the evening time message is to apply him who has been revealed because how can you apply something that's not revealed how could Israel apply the total without the token being revealed Rahab said give me a true token in other words I don't want your opinion on the matter I I want God to use you to reveal the token to me a true token not a token a true token give me a true token amen and that's our desire for our lives Lord give me a true token amen because Ray had uh sorry Ahab Rahab knew that without the token she would die the same curse she knew it amen and they are she knew that her only protection was through the revealed token and then in the evening time she applies the token and the at the applied token can you picture this in your mind that rahab's house was the only one that stood it was the only one I mean that's a that's a miracle it's it's absolutely It's Supernatural right so there was a supernatural element to that token but but if Rahab didn't apply the token her house would have looked like the rest so it had to be applied and once it was applied people looked at rahab's house and thought how come that didn't fall when everything else fell how come that didn't fall all right and you'll notice here I've got down the bottom there Matthew 7. that's the parable of the two houses one was built upon the the sand and one was built upon a rock the the definition of the or the understanding of this Parable is as Jesus says that it is that one heard the word and did it that was the house that was built upon sand so and didn't the one that didn't do it was built upon the sand the one that did it was built upon a rock all right so we have heard the word right we have heard the word Rahab heard the word apply the token apply it let the token fall from this window apply it we have heard the word amen but if we don't apply the word then our houses were full I went to church I mean I went to BCF well that don't mean anything that doesn't mean anything to God he's not he's not looking for your where you where you congregated he's looking for the token amen and it doesn't matter if you attend Living Word Fellowship in Australia it makes no difference what church you attend what makes the difference is whether the token is applied or not amen and the application of the token brings a supernatural element to your home amen and that Supernatural element cannot be explained otherwise it's not Supernatural you explain to me how rahab's house was the only one that stood you explained to me how Israel who applied the token their homes were the only one who was safe from the death angel you you you explain that to me how how is that how how how is that possible there's a supernatural element to it that cannot be explained which means when the token is applied to our home there's a supernatural element to our home and that Supernatural element is not something I can't explain it to my neighbor I can't even explain it to you you have to get the revelation of the supernatural there was a supernatural element to Enoch's life and there is a supernatural element to this bride's life amen there absolutely is the token is the life of God in you expressing himself through you it's not you it's not me it's him and I apply the token to my office when I apply the token to my office there's a supernatural element that now dwells in that office how do we apply it by simple faith simple faith not some educated Faith or some high and mighty Faith just simple faith all right just just simply taking God at his word and applying the token applying what is the token it's the life of God to that office when I apply the token to my office as husband there's a supernatural element now that is expressed from that office when I have when I apply the token to the office of Father there's a supernatural element now to that office the life that I now live I live by the faith of the token Once Upon a Time as a husband I didn't have it once upon a time as a father I didn't have it but God has now made it possible for me to live to to to to live a life now that I once couldn't live through the token because the token has been applied to me I don't need to worry about meeting the standard or meeting the challenges of that I'm going to face as a husband because it's no longer me meeting the challenges amen it's him because I'm walking with him Enoch walked with God and was not this bride walks with God and she will not she will she will be translated that she they won't find you the life the life I now live the life that God has made possible I live by the faith of the token it's the token himself expressing himself through me because I applied the token the token must be applied the what does it mean to apply the token today it means to apply the revelation of the token to your life Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in you the hope of glory when you apply that to your token to your life when you apply the token to your life then the things that weren't possible are now possible foreign the father could say to the son son the token has been applied you do not need to worry the token has been applied all right when I see the blood when I see the token I will pass over you the token is not your life it's his life when when I see my life applied to your home to your this is his home right when I see my life applied to your home then you have nothing to fear then the death angel cannot touch you the demons cannot touch you when I see the life of the blood in your life applied to your life amen so the token today is the life of God but it must be applied it must be applied in mum's life it must be applied in the father's life it must be applied in the daughter's life if she's reached that time where the time of accountability it must be applied in a son's life it must be applied to their life so what this means is that the life of God must be expressed through you and when God sees his own life he'll pass over you my my I do not need to fear if I do not need to fear as a pastor whether I will meet the challenges that I'm going to face as a pastor because the revelation of the token casts out fear perfect love casts out for you I do I do not need to worry why because the token has been applied I have applied the token to that office I have come to the Revelation where it's not me it's him amen mothers do not need to fear they do not need to worry about their children it's a you know we live in a wretched world uh confused evil world but God has given you something God has given you mothers something that is greater than all the evil of this world and what he has given you is his own life he's given you a token he's given you a token that token is applied when that token is applied you don't need to worry whether you will meet the challenges that come to mothers in this hour because mothers in this hour you know a mother's love is is an incredible love but they're they're challenged in this hour because of their love for their children they're challenged by the evil that that your children might face in the shopping center your children might face at school or in the Park or wherever it might be the the fear can creep in but you don't need to fear when the token is applied you don't need to fear now I'm not saying that we stick our hand in the lion's cage and then wonder why he bit it bit us that's not what I'm saying we protect our children the best that we can protect our children but we don't need to fear okay never before have we faced such an evil time as this time never before have our children had the availability to evil like this day but I'm here to declare to you that the focus is not on what we're facing the devil wants your attention don't give it to him all right God wants your attention give it to him because the focus is not what we overcome but how we overcome all right and how we overcome is walking by faith with him that's how we're going to overcome that's where we need to focus we need to take our Focus off the the evil of the world and turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus amen look unto him the life of the token that is in you Enoch walked with God and was not this bride is Walking with God and soon she will not be found what's the focus who she's walking with what does God recognize only the token his life applied to your home this end time bride is more than natural because there is a supernatural element to her life through the token God's Bride is a supernatural bride yes she is this bride is Supernatural meaning that the supernatural will be expressed from her a husband with the token is more than a husband as Jesus was a man but he was more than a man amen you with the token are more than a man your sisters your mothers with the token are more than a mother this is why you can't evaluate yourself off a worldly mother right because you're not worldly there's more to you than the natural there's more to you than meets the eye you you have a supernatural element our our children who have the token are more than children they are Supernatural children your pasta with the token is more than a pasta he's a supernatural pasta because there's a supernatural token that is living itself through that man amen so we thank God that we can have a confidence that we need in order to be able to walk with him without fear we can walk with God totally 100 without fear because we have a revelation of who we're walking with amen amen he meets the challenges of the hour he is the supernatural but she is him this bride is Supernatural in our minds we think of the supernatural in in connection with healings and miracles etc etc and that's that that's right we understand that but we also understand that it's more than that because as we saw in that quotation you can preach the gospel you know you can heal by through the prayer of faith etc etc but unless the token is applied to your life then you're going to come under the wrath of God all right so it's it's more than signs and wonders it's a it's a na it's a life that is lived on such a natural level that it goes unnoticed it's it's the life of God in dad living such an ordinary looking life through an ordinary looking man but there's a supernatural element to that office amen this is how God wants us to see ourselves God wants us to see ourselves as Supernatural by his token being in US it means that we are not subject to the curse that the world is under pornography is a curse but when you can see your yourself as a husband or a father or mother or wife as having that Supernatural element then you don't need to fall or your children don't need to fall to that same curse because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if we start to think on a natural level that well I guess our children just have to experience these things that's wrong thinking all right because what you've done is excluded the supernatural yeah but when there's a supernatural element in your life and that Supernatural element is your children's protection then they don't have to experience those things amen they don't have to it's it's we shouldn't fall to that type of thinking we've got to see ourselves as God sees us and that is that we're not alone we're not just natural fathers we're not just natural mothers we're Supernatural [Music] we're Supernatural you can as a Brothers encouraged his wife to sing that special you can encourage your wife to say honey you ask us there's a supernatural element to you that is more than than just you're more than a wife you're a supernatural wife through the revelation of that token and she can do the same to him when he has his down time and he doesn't feel that he can get through she can speak those words of life to him and say honey there's more to you than you just being a husband there's more to you than just being a father you are a supernatural husband you are a supernatural father because the token is with you the token is in you amen we need to exhort one another according to the word we need to exhort one another according to the revelation of the word for our day there's no point exhorting at each other as it was in Moses or as it was at Noah's day no or as Luther or as well Wesley no we we have a word that God has given us today and that's how he wants us to exhort one another is through the revelation of that word and there's more to you than the natural there's more to you than the natural sometimes husbands and and wives are afraid to have children because of the condition of the world or because of the way that they see themselves sometimes they don't want to have children because they they deem themselves as a as a failure that you know I don't want to have children because I don't want to fail I just know I'd be a bad mother or I just know I'd be a bad father that's wrong thinking God wants you to come up higher than that God wants you to understand that once there's a token is applied you are just not any ordinary mother it doesn't matter how how what type of past you had it doesn't matter what type of child that you were when you were when you were a child there's a supernatural element to you that God wants you to understand through the token that none of that stuff matters anymore case closed amen case closed it's done it's finished amen the prophet of God says in the invisible Union he says Church you who I'm speaking to tonight Across the Nation if you've separated yourself from the nomination and all the filth and things of the world and all those things that keeps you in man-made Creeds and orders and things like that you separate yourself look up get ready the fire is going to fall one of these days God is going to to let him come and a sight to behold would you be ready when he comes would you be ready to go up with him when he comes the secret Rapture of the supernatural bride she'll be made from Mortal to immortality be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep amen so there's a supernatural bride this is what this is what God is calling you he's calling you a supernatural bride so so why what does God want from us he wants us to see ourselves the way that he sees us amen say if he sees me as a supernatural bride that is how this bride will see herself that there is a supernatural element to this bride amen I'm so happy tonight that there is that Supernatural element amen I want to look at this story here in in Luke Chapter 5 and just show you on how how extreme the difference is from when you do things in your own effort without the token and when you do things with the token all right I'll read from verse 1 and I may not be able to pronounce all these names but if I skip a word you'll know why it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were going out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he has left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your net for a draft so we understand here by this story here that the token Jesus Christ is he was the token so the token was coming into contact with people with fishermen who had fished all night these fishermen were not recreational fishermen these fishermen were professional fishermen all right they understood the moon cycle they understood the tides they understood the the winds they understood the currents of the water they understood the bottom of the the structure that was underneath the water they understood all those things but they had toiled all night in verse 5 it says in Simon answered and sound to him Master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing so we see here that Simon had done things to the best of his ability professional fishermen keep Diaries they understand um they can go back in their diary and say okay on this moon cycle and this tide we caught this this many fish all right so so it Simon had come to an end all Simon's knowledge bought nothing It produced nothing and this is where we come as parents this is where we come as father husband and wife where we we do what we can do to the best of our knowledge but there comes a time when it produces nothing it just it just nothing comes from it husband and wife a husband and wife but the token isn't a part of their life and what all it does is is create turmoil nothing Becomes of it okay mother and father they have children but the token isn't a part of their life they're not able to produce anything 's becoming of it nothing's becoming of what they have you know they've gone by the mum said do this Dad said do this your auntie said do this grandma said to this Grandfather said do that you know that they're going off what their parents did you know and they're trying up trying to apply that to their life today but we understand that the standard of evil is rising the level of evil is rising in each generation many many times in one generation so we can't apply what what Mama did or what Daddy did in this age and expect it to work right God has got to lift that standard up but without the token for your day without the the Holy Ghost for your time for your day then you're gonna always run short all right so so Simon says this he says we've we've toil all night we've struggled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net all right so we understand now that now Simon was not doing something according to his education he was not doing something according to his knowledge but now there was a token involved he was doing the same thing he was going through the same process but now the token was being applied to what he was doing all right so now he wasn't doing it in his own strength he said at Thy word I will let down the net so now he was doing it in the strength of the token the same thing the same thing I was a husband and I didn't have the token but then I became a husband with the token and now I could love my wife through the token all right and when they had done this they they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their net break and they beckoned unto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink so now the success Pete Simon couldn't say I've been successful Simon couldn't say praise God on the husband that I need to be Simon couldn't say praise God I'm the father I need to be I I did it I did because it wasn't him it was the token that caused Simon to have a blessing to be what he was ordained to be Beyond his imagination beyond what he thought possible to a point where it was such a blessing that the blessing overflowed to others he had to call for help all right the blessing was so great that Simon couldn't contain it himself he had to that blessing went to others you know when when your life when when the token is expressing himself from your life you're not just a blessing to yourself but you're a blessing to others it overflows and you get a family where that token is applied and people become blessed because of the application of the token to that family's life other families become blessed it's it's it's just this is why you want to associate your children with Godly families because you want to be a blessing to one another amen I say Lord Lord help us the prophet of God says he says it was Peter when he was fished all night he was sitting on the bank that morning when Jesus borrowed his boat and he thrust out a little from the bank and was preaching to the people and then he said to Simon launch out into the deep and let down for the draft let down well Simon said I'm a fisherman I know the moon and the signs are right I know the fish when the fish is running I was born on this Lake here I've fished all night and haven't took even Amino I haven't taken a thing said there is no fish in there but at Thy word there you are I'll lay down the net and then so Peter was um drawing Confidence from his natural but now the supernatural was being introduced into a natural position that Peter was taking as a fisherman trying to earn a living for his children to supply for his children so the Supernatural is not refined to miracles of a husband who who has a job but the Supernatural is a part of his life do you understand that that Supernatural element flows into your natural life now you're no longer just a carpenter right because the token is a part of your life now you're you're a supernatural Carpenter you might be a housewife but you're more than a housewife I because there's a supernatural element God God walked with Enoch day and night God was with Enoch when Enoch built the pyramids all right so when you go to work you don't leave God at home and when your husband goes to work he doesn't take the token with him and leave you without it right the token is with him when he goes to work and the token is with you wives when you're at home amen I must you're a supernatural wife a wife with the token is a supernatural wife a builder a mechanic an engineer what whatever it is you're more than an engineer because God wants to be God is interested in your everyday life so what you need to do is apply the token to your life not just an office but to your life and when the token is applied to your life everything you do everything you do the token as an influencer amen this is why there's a part of you in your in your work that people don't understand there's a supernatural element to your work that people don't understand how come everyone else is going broke but you're successful well I went to college and I did this and I did that and I've got a great knowledge of that no it has nothing to do with you you've got to apply the token to your business and when you apply the token to your business now that becomes a supernatural element to that business and now you know Doom and Gloom might come to others but you're not going to come under that same curse why because there's a supernatural element that is connected to that business is the word works do the same thing through the token you'll have a different result amen be it be a be a business owner without the token you are subject to the conditions that the world is if the economy goes down you go down if it goes up you go up if it goes down you go down but what you'll find that is when the token is applied to that business you are no longer governed by what the world does because there's a token there's a supernatural element that is applied amen we can't figure these things out we can't we can't we we know how or why it's doing what it's doing but we can't figure it out all right and God is past figuring out you've got to believe it see God is known not by knowledge not by education he's known by faith and Faith only at Thy word I know there is no fish there but Thy word if you if you said let down there is fish there your faith will put it there that's all I'll let down the net amen so your faith when the Lord come to Simon Simon applied the token he applied the wood amen and in applying the word your faith in that word will put the fish there amen so so God wants to bless you but the way that he wants to bless you is by your faith in the word some people work themselves to death most people who work themselves to death haven't applied the token because when you apply the token it's your faith in that token that produces the results the application of the token is what produces results at Thy word the prophet of God says look Peter said Lord we've sinned all night and taken nothing but nevertheless at Thy word I'll let down the net there it is if God said so faith will put some fish there if there isn't any there that's right at Thy word Lord aren't we're going to let down the net that's right I wished I could stay on that a little while but I can't so it's your faith in the application of that token how is the token applied by simple faith when you apply that token to your officers it may seem like nothing is there it may look like nothing is there it you may seem like that you have nothing more to offer as a father or as a husband but when you apply the token by faith your face will put what is necessary there you may think well I don't have the strength I don't have what I don't have the strength to go on if you apply the token your faith in that token will produce strength you may come to a junction where well I don't know what to do I I'm just lost I don't know what to do in this particular situation as a husband let's say I don't know what to do as a father I don't know what to do so what am I going to do I'm gonna apply the token to that office and I'm gonna say Lord there's more than me here I may not know what to do but you know what to do so I'm going to apply the Life of Christ the life the token to that office and you watch things happen you your children may be in a place where you don't know what to do with them but if you apply the token to that office it's like God stepping into that office where all things are possible nothing is impossible for him and he simply does what you can't do it's a token life is the token must be applied it must be applied in every office that we hold and through the application of the token things happen things that you didn't think would happen happen Peter was expecting the same results he was expecting Lord we've see it all night we've dropped this Net 10 times we've dropped this net we're tired that I mean we've washed the Nets we've we're done for the day there's no fish here Lord I know what I'm doing but at Thy word Lord I'll apply the word to this oh I'll do what you want me to do I'll do what you're telling me to do he was expecting the same results but lo and behold he got different results because sometimes we don't even know what result we need we don't even know what the answer should be so how how can we expect an answer when we don't know what the answer is we don't have a clue we don't know Lord I don't know what to do many times as a pastor you come to that place where he said Lord I don't know what to do I don't know what the answer is amen but we apply the token and the answer comes God brings this solution amen apply applying the token applying the token people that they'll they'll cut there is a time and now is whether that Supernatural element like in rahab's house it doesn't mean that that's at the end time houses have fallen to the curse of this world already look down your street and tell me how many are still standing I don't mean in a physical way I mean in a spiritual way they've Fallen to the spirits of this world but for some reason on your street there's this one particular house that hasn't fallen why is that it's because there's a supernatural element to that house the supernatural element is in this house and it's not in that house but it's God's grace that the Supernatural is a part of your home [Music] amen fathers husbands have fallen but there's a supernatural husband on Earth that hasn't fallen why because of the supernatural element in his life this this world is influencing try is influencing its own and causing its own to fall fathers husbands have fallen from their position wives mothers have fallen from their position but for some reason this is a little bitty sham guy that refuses to fall for some reason there's this there's this Mary there's this Rebecca that refuses to fall it's faithful wife who keeps that position under her under the headship under the leadership of her husband why because there's a token life is a token life that is expressing himself through her through him there's a there's a there's parents on Earth who do not fear the demonology of this world because she understands he understands the protection of the token so she's not falling to fear but she's rising in love perfect love is causing her to stand strong perfect love is causing him to stand strong as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen why because there's a supernatural element to God's Masterpiece family amen there's a supernatural element to God's Masterpiece family so what does it mean as I close to apply the token because the token had to be applied otherwise the token hadn't had the power of the token wasn't released so what does it mean in our age to apply the token to our lives it means to apply the life of the token to the to your life and allow it to express itself through the offices that you hold by faith I apply this life his life to the office that he has given me by faith you can apply the life his very life that token life to your life and allow him to express himself through you as an individual that token life allows you or gives you a confidence as a husband as a father as a mother as what as a builder as a plumber whatever whatever office whatever occupation that you have God wants to be expressed through that office you think that's that's pretty that's pretty significant when we think about that that I'm a builder by trade but God God wants to be expressed as that Builder that doesn't mean that I've you know I I don't need scaffold anymore because there's a supernatural element not a hover off the ground and that's not what I mean but I'm in my in my conduct and Order in my my relationship to the clients you know that God wants to be expressed through that office that's that's humbling to think the King of Kings the Lord of lords the Supreme judge desires to be expressed through me as a builder through you as a housewife that that's that's God's desire amen and that's Supernatural that's Supernatural where Enoch walked with God and was not this bride is Walking with God and she will be not she she'll what at some point she'll just leave this place why because the the focus is on the walk the focus is on who we are walking with that token the token life in you expressing himself in you I don't know how many hundreds of times I've said that over the last services but you know for for me as a minister God opens the doors like God opens the door to a room and that's where he wants me to dwell and he won't allow me out of that room no matter how many times I have to repeat anything until I see what he wants me to see so I'm not responsible for what I'm telling you he's responsible for for you might say well you're just repeating what you said well maybe you need to listen [Laughter] amen there's no point I was reluctant to say this but there's no point having a Ministry of healing if your family life is a mess because the token hasn't been applied because the token life will produce but if the token life is not there no matter what signs and wonders you do no matter how many times you preach a week it makes no difference that's absolutely no difference the priority is that the token must be applied to your life and you can't say the token is applied to your life because signs follow you that's not what the prophet said the the science will follow you but that's not the focus the focus is where if the where is the token is the token applied to your life that's why me as a as a minister of this precious gospel the most important thing for me is not to minister it's not it's second the most important thing for me is that the token is a part is the preeminent part of my life and has been applied to every office of my life because my my my my children are a reflection of if my token has been applied if the token has been applied to my life or not you can bring this well praise God I'm not a minister well you you can have six million bucks in the bank and that's not success because you're six million dollars won't help your children get salvation all right so the the importance is the importance is is not our our work life the importance is the office that God has given me as husband and as father those are the two most important officers that God has given me if the token is not flowing through those offices something is wrong something is wrong all right and it's we can uh you apply this to the the sisters as well and I know there's no sisters here that do this but if you're more interested in shopping than applying the token to your children then there's something wrong right because our focal point is who we are walking with our focal point is is the token applied because as long as we're walking with God and he is walking with us there should be a token life expressed amen and what what Christ was to the age you are to your family no one took priority over him he didn't allow his priorities to become greater or unorganized his priority was his bride his priority was his wife that was his priority was the Redemption of his wife though he was tempted to become organized and get his priorities mixed up he stayed in order now I'm not that perfect sometimes I get my priority priorities mixed up all right but when I do I say Lord I'm sorry because the moment that I do it's no longer him expressing himself the moment I get my priorities mixed up now it's me and if you're sensitive enough your your life will testify of that all right your wife will begin to act different your children will begin to act different because you're out of order as a as the husband of the home you're out of order the the focus is is on you as the husband of the home to be in order to have your priorities right to allow that token life to express himself through you and things will happen that you did not expect blessings will come that you did not expect blessings will come to the to the extent that you did not expect amen the token life applying the token is applying the Life of Christ to your office applying the Life of Christ to your office and with every office that you apply that token life that office will be successful because it's not you anymore when I'm unsuccessful in my office's husband it's because it's me God is never unsuccessful well Lord you didn't you didn't achieve that you can't say that God will achieve everything that he sets out to achieve all right so if he will be what he's ordained to be but anytime that I'm not successful is because I've stepped out of order and say Lord help me help me to stay in my position under your word under your leadership you are the preeminent one you are my headship you are my leadership you are my God you are everything Lord help me to keep my position as a husband under your word amen amen praise God I hope that helps you tonight amen just wanted to be a blessing to you and I trust the Lord has blessed you tonight let's ask the brother Chad and the musicians to to come amen why don't we offer a word of prayer as they come tonight let's turn to our feet amen our precious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we want to thank you for the token that you have given us Lord we want to praise you Lord for that token Lord Jesus in this short time lord these few words Heavenly Father we 've given us given us a great Insight Lord to what it means to apply this token because the strength of that token is released upon the application of it in Heavenly Father Lord God we we apply this token to every office that we hold no matter who we are no matter what we are Lord God we we apply this token and we understand that through that application Lord there comes a supernatural power oh Lord God we we thank you for your love to us we thank you for your grace to us we thank you Lord for this understanding that you have given to us lord of the magnificence of this token life that Lord God it is no longer I trying to be a husband but Lord God it is you in me being a husband being a father being a builder being a carpenter a plumber a bit whatever office we hold whatever occupation we hold the housewife Lord God help us Lord Jesus to totally remove ourselves from this picture that Lord God people might not see me might not see you but Lord God they would only see you or Heavenly Father we commit these things into your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen the Lord bless you thank you brother Chad the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love foreign [Music] [Music] the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no oh foreign [Music] oh aren't you thankful for the token that is not our own strength anymore amen because we've tried to be dads and how many times have we wound up like Peter with nothing we've tried to do we've tried to be whatever God wants us to be whatever he's called us to be in whatever position we've given our best effort and at times come up with nothing I'm so glad there's a supernatural element that's available and it's not just dependent on me and my ability and my effort and all of that but God will come down and Empower me to be by his strength what he's called me to be so encouraged by that that's what we need amen that's the missing piece that separates us from everybody else is his life living his life through our life I was thinking when he talked about Enoch Walking with God it's amazing but it's absolutely impossible for Enoch to walk with God unless God presented himself to Enoch I mean where would he not find him amen where would he not go and grab a hold of him and hold his oh he no man can find God God has to come to man and in this generation God has presented himself to us so that we can walk with him is not a mystery we're not in job's day where he says where is he the work if I could walk knock on his door and ask him questions he has presented himself to us so that we can walk with him what a privileged people we are so thankful for that and something I was thinking there well brother Daniel was preaching there at the end a father can sacrifice and give of himself for his children because God can sacrifice for his children a mother can lay down her life and sacrifice her time her energy her sleep everything for her children because God can sacrifice for his children and if God lives in that father that father can give himself for that family and if God lives in that mother that mother can surrender her own life for the life of her children without that it's not possible but the one who makes it possible is the one who's promised to live inside of us amen sometimes we struggle to sacrifice to surrender to give up but it's no sacrifice for God he surrendered he gave up he gave of himself and if we could just receive his life we could surrender we can give up we can give of our sins all the potentials are there amen I'm encouraged I'm encouraged not my strengths but by thy Spirit oh God man we love you it's been a good time I've had a good time this last week amen I've learned a lot I've grown I feel like I've grown a lot I've been challenged I've been encouraged and I just thank God for using our brother amen how many of you remember to pray for him this weekend and this week because they go back home and for the whole family we love you all you're in our prayers you mean the world to us amen and we thank God for this time I mean it's been a wonderful time amen amen let's just thank God together for what he's given us Lord Jesus go without you what are we who are we what can we do but God when you called for a generation to give the greatest expression in a many member body you provided everything that was necessary to be that great expression God you unlocked yourself when you took the seals off of the book lord when you brought broke the nominational chains of misunderstanding and wrong interpretation and wrong thinking when you broke us out of ignorance and foolishness you gave us the potential God all we have to do is receive what you've done in this day to believe it to receive it to allow it to take over our lives this word that you've opened in this day is yourself Lord if we can just surrender to that and let your life flow through us then Lord we can be the fathers and mothers that you intended for us to be we can be the brothers and sisters we can be the workers we can be the teenagers we can be whatever it is you've called us to be we can be that Lord because you have Unchained and Unbound Yourself by every denominational change and brought yourself Lord into full manifestation God help us to walk with you [Music] Lord help us to forget everything else and walk with you Lord God make that the greatest desire of our hearts is to walk with you God whatever it is we have to do and whatever it is we've thought and the past was important May Lord we have the courage and the ability by your grace to make walking with you the greatest privilege of Our Lives God in this generation Lord God we you came to a prophet on a Mountaintop in Colorado and you said why don't you walk with me and that Prophet lord said that would be my greatest desire oh God lord if that's what you wanted to do with that Prophet Lord that's what you want to do with us Lord You're inviting us to walk with you and God I want to say that would be my greatest pleasure on Earth is to walk with you God we thank you for presenting yourself to us in this generation and God made Lord you just take us by the hand and may we keep our hand in yours may you lead us along the way and may you do the impossible Lord you do it through us as we surrender to you and give you first place but I pray Lord that you would just pour a blessing out upon our brother Daniel Lord for he's poured out of himself Lord as you led him to in these last four services but God I pray you would pour back into him and may he go home strengthened and encouraged and refreshed and may he be able to pour out to his congregation again Lord with an abundance that you've poured into him bless his wife and his children and the family and those that have come with him I pray he took him safe journey home Lord they've been special to us and good to us and we have been blessed by them and I pray you'd bless them in return and God I pray I know the desire of my brother's heart is not to go home saying Lord those were good meetings but to know that they brought a change in somebody's life and I pray God that you would reward your servant for his faithfulness by that that this word will take an effect and find a place in the hearts of men and women and produce life that this word that was preached would become manifested life in your children and you can start with me in my life Lord I want the words that were preached and the things that I heard to be alive in me Lord and on display in this flesh and I surrender to what you have told me Lord in these Services may it live Lord in me and in all your children Lord as we cry out to you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all you can be dismissed have a wonderful Thanksgiving may God bless you abundantly amen Lord prepare me to be a saint Jewish holy tried in truth I'll be leaving [Music] for you oh Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary oh [Music] tried and true and with Thanksgiving I'll be early [Applause] [Music] for him and all his way oh [Music] all his ways oh we had heard the message they a place of perfect rest [Music] serving so sorry little bride wreath for all his ways [Music] oh we have heard the message alone and all his way for there is a place [Music] [Applause] [Music] my breath for all these ways [Music] yeah it's all his way oh we never heard the message alone and all his way foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
