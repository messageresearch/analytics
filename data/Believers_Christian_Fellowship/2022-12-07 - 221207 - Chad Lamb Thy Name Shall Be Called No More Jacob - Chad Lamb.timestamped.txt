[12:14] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[12:17] amen
[12:18] amen while we're standing let's take our
[12:21] Bibles please and turn to Genesis
[12:22] chapter 32.
[12:25] we'll begin reading there I'm going to
[12:27] continue with the same portion of
[12:30] scripture in Genesis 32 talking about
[12:32] Jacob but I want to go into the next
[12:35] part
[12:37] Genesis chapter 32
[12:41] and we'll begin reading in
[12:45] uh verse 9 what does Sarita passage of
[12:48] scripture there verse 9.
[12:51] and Jacob said o God of My Father
[12:53] Abraham and God of my father Isaac the
[12:56] Lord which said unto me return unto thy
[12:58] country to thy Kindred and I will deal
[13:00] well with thee I'm not worthy of the
[13:03] least of all the mercies and of the
[13:04] truth which thou has showed unto thy
[13:06] servant for with my staff I passed over
[13:09] this Jordan now I am become two bands
[13:12] deliver me I pray thee from the hand of
[13:15] my brother from the hand of Esau for I
[13:17] fear Him lest he will come and smite me
[13:20] and the mother with children let's go
[13:23] over to verse 24 now
[13:26] verse 24 and Jacob was left alone and
[13:29] there Wrestled a man with him until the
[13:32] break of day
[13:33] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[13:35] against him he touched the hollow the
[13:37] hollow of his thigh and the hollow of
[13:39] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[13:41] wrestled with him and he said let me go
[13:43] for the day breakth and he said I will
[13:46] not let thee go except thou bless me and
[13:48] he said unto him what is thy name and he
[13:51] said Jacob and he said thy name shall be
[13:53] called No More Jacob but Israel for as a
[13:57] prince hast thou power with God and with
[13:59] men and has prevailed and Jacob asked
[14:03] him and said tell me I pray thee thy
[14:05] name and he said wherefore is it that
[14:07] thou Dost asked after my name and he
[14:09] blessed him there and Jacob called the
[14:12] name of the place pineal for I have seen
[14:14] God face to face and my life is
[14:17] preserved and as he passed over penuel
[14:19] the sun rose upon him and he halted upon
[14:23] his thigh man God bless you as you take
[14:25] your seats
[14:26] may the Lord bless us this evening as we
[14:29] look into this subject
[14:31] I want to I want to look into this
[14:34] phrase
[14:36] in verse 27 I believe it is
[14:40] yeah in verse 27 he said unto him what
[14:43] is thy name and he said Jacob
[14:47] and he said thy name shall be called No
[14:50] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[14:53] has thou power with God and with men and
[14:55] has prevailed it's amazing that the
[14:58] struggle is all about a name
[15:02] when you really get down to the heart of
[15:04] the struggle amen you have to say that
[15:07] that this Angel presented himself to
[15:10] Jacob Jacob didn't find the man to
[15:13] wrestle with the man presented himself
[15:15] to Jacob and there we know that it was
[15:17] it was God in a form it was a
[15:19] manifestation of God because he says he
[15:22] names the place pineal for I have seen
[15:24] God face to face and my life is
[15:27] preserved and so brother Adam tells us
[15:29] he wrestled with God it was God in a
[15:31] theophany God and a a form of a man that
[15:35] began an angel began to wrestle with him
[15:38] and and the the angel could not Prevail
[15:41] over Jacob and this is amazing because
[15:44] you think God in a form he was wrestling
[15:46] with God God could not Prevail and it
[15:49] wasn't that God didn't have enough power
[15:51] or enough strength or could not equip
[15:53] this angel with enough power to Prevail
[15:55] that he could not Prevail over Jacob
[15:57] because there was a promise that had to
[15:59] come forth in Jacob's life he could not
[16:01] Prevail over Virginia Jacob because
[16:03] Jacob needed to win this battle Jacob
[16:06] needed to be changed
[16:08] amen
[16:10] so I want to jump over to another
[16:12] scripture and look at Hosea together if
[16:14] you look at Hosea with me
[16:18] Hosea chapter 12.
[16:21] and Hosea is going to reference the same
[16:24] thing here
[16:29] Hosea
[16:31] chapter 12.
[16:33] and we're going to look at verse
[16:36] 3.
[16:40] I'm sorry yeah Hosea chapter 12. and
[16:44] verse 3.
[16:47] it says in Isaiah 12 and 3 he took his
[16:49] brother by the heel in the womb and by
[16:51] his strength he had power with God
[16:54] yea he had power over the angel and
[16:57] prevailed
[16:58] he wept and made supplication into him
[17:00] he found him at Bethel and there he
[17:02] spake with us so I want you to see it
[17:05] says in verse 3 that by his strength he
[17:07] had power with God yea he had power over
[17:11] the angel and prevailed amen Hosea is is
[17:15] saying that Jacob had power with God and
[17:19] he had power over the angel and he
[17:21] prevailed I think this is a fascinating
[17:23] portion of scripture amen who can get
[17:25] into a wrestling match with God in the
[17:27] form of an Angel and when amen only the
[17:30] one that's predestinated to win
[17:33] that's the only one that can win the
[17:35] only one that has an order in his life
[17:37] to win the one that God in in this
[17:40] instance God did not want to Prevail
[17:42] over Jacob God wanted Jacob to Prevail
[17:45] God wanted Jacob to persevere God wanted
[17:47] Jacob to hold on God wanted Jacob to go
[17:50] all the way amen and he went all the way
[17:52] until he got a name change amen and a
[17:55] walk change and everything changed
[17:58] I believe that was the goal of God
[18:00] so now when this Angel comes you realize
[18:04] that that God decided to meet Jacob here
[18:08] Jacob didn't find a place where God was
[18:11] he didn't come and knock on his door
[18:13] that he was alone and God came to Jacob
[18:16] and when God came to Jacob then there
[18:19] was a struggle that ensued amen and and
[18:22] on God's perspective from the Angel's
[18:24] perspective it had everything to do with
[18:28] changing Jacob
[18:31] and and
[18:33] he wrestled and he says let me go and he
[18:35] says I will not let you go and and he
[18:38] touched the the hollow of his thigh and
[18:40] it shrank and and he we know he changed
[18:43] his walk amen and he weakened him in the
[18:45] flesh and and then he says what is your
[18:48] name
[18:49] and he said Jacob
[18:51] he says listen it's not that God didn't
[18:54] know his name
[18:56] this is the central part of the story is
[18:59] the name and that's what I want to get
[19:01] into so if we're a title tonight I've
[19:03] taken thy name shall be called No More
[19:05] Jacob
[19:06] thy name shall be called No More Jacob
[19:08] to this point he was supplanter he was
[19:10] deceiver he was working by his plan by
[19:13] his strengths by by his abilities
[19:16] everything that he was gaining or trying
[19:18] to gain or accomplishing was on his own
[19:20] but here he was going to come face to
[19:22] face with God he was going to come in
[19:24] contact with something brother bam said
[19:26] something real that he could get a hold
[19:28] of and when he did this Angel asked him
[19:31] what is your name or other words he says
[19:34] what is your identification who are you
[19:37] who are you it's like when God come
[19:40] walking in the in the cool of the
[19:42] evening into the Garden of Eden after
[19:44] the fall of Man he cries Adam Adam Where
[19:46] Art Thou it's not that God doesn't know
[19:49] where Adam is but God needs Adam to know
[19:51] where Adam is amen and and so Adam then
[19:54] begins to tell him well I I heard thy
[19:57] voice walking in the in the garden and I
[19:59] hid myself for I was naked he had to
[20:01] declare what condition he was in he had
[20:04] to declare where he was with God and now
[20:07] the angel asked Jacob who are you
[20:10] and he says I'm sir planter I'm deceiver
[20:12] I'm Jacob and he's going with his carnal
[20:15] identification with the carnal
[20:17] identification he's had all of his life
[20:18] that's all he knows about himself that's
[20:21] all he knows is who he is so he gives
[20:24] the best answer he can but the angel
[20:26] said thou shall no more be called Jacob
[20:31] thy name shall be called No More Jacob
[20:34] but Israel
[20:37] let's read that I'm going to go back to
[20:39] Genesis and I want to stay there for a
[20:41] minute
[20:42] Genesis 32
[20:47] this has become so significant to me
[20:51] as I look into this
[20:53] verse 27 chapter 32 verse 27 he said
[20:57] unto him what is thy name he said Jacob
[20:59] and he said thy name shall be called No
[21:02] More Jacob
[21:04] listen this isn't a suggestion
[21:07] he wasn't saying what do you think about
[21:08] a new name what do you think if I if I
[21:10] called you Israel would you be okay with
[21:12] that the angel is making a declaration
[21:14] I've met you you've reached out and got
[21:17] a hold of me and now I'm going to bless
[21:19] you he asked him he says well he says I
[21:22] will not let you go unless you bless me
[21:24] so what is the blessing the blessing is
[21:27] what's your identification say Jacob no
[21:31] more are you going to be called by Jacob
[21:32] but you're going to be called by Israel
[21:34] what is he giving him he's giving him
[21:36] the blessing
[21:38] but it comes in a unique way he's saying
[21:40] bless me and it's not like when when
[21:43] Israel when when Isaac gave him the
[21:45] blessing he gave him the blessing of the
[21:47] fat of the land and the corn and all his
[21:49] Brethren Shall Serve him he gave him a
[21:51] blessing of material things but now in
[21:54] the presence of the Angel he asks for a
[21:56] blessing and here's how the angel gives
[21:58] a blessing what are you called who are
[22:00] you what's your identity and he said my
[22:03] identity all I've ever known is Jacob he
[22:05] says you shall no more be called Jacob
[22:08] but Israel
[22:12] but Israel for as a prince has thou
[22:15] power with God and with men and Hast
[22:19] prevailed overcome you have overcome
[22:24] oh my goodness that is so amazing to me
[22:31] ah brother Franco if you could pull up
[22:33] the white board I want to write a few
[22:35] things down but I want to read something
[22:37] here brother REM said out of the breach
[22:38] he said like Jacob being supplanter and
[22:41] when he got in contact with the angel he
[22:43] held on and the angel tried to pull away
[22:45] he said I'm just not going to let you go
[22:47] he held on until he got what he wanted
[22:50] for and his name was changed from Sir
[22:52] planter which means deceiver to what to
[22:55] a prince with God Israel he prevailed
[22:59] brother remember says in Victory Day
[23:01] what what the church needs to do is to
[23:03] do like Jacob pray till you get a v-day
[23:05] and right Jacob had a wrestling party he
[23:08] wrestled all night long with the Lord
[23:10] but he said I'm just not going to let
[23:12] you go until I get this Victory and then
[23:15] about daylight one morning he had a
[23:17] v-day he didn't walk the same anymore
[23:21] his victory his Blessing was uh to be
[23:25] humbled In the Flesh or to be weakened
[23:28] in the flesh but to be given a new
[23:29] identification
[23:31] what a blessing what kind of blessing do
[23:34] we want amen what kind of blessing are
[23:35] we looking for when we say God would you
[23:37] bless me is it with Supernatural powers
[23:40] and with all kinds of gifts and with
[23:42] great ministry and a great name amen
[23:44] maybe the blessing we need is to
[23:46] recognize how weak we really are to be
[23:48] weakened in the flesh but to get a new
[23:50] identity
[23:51] amen
[23:53] so I want to I want to write down some
[23:56] of these definitions of the word Israel
[23:59] because it's it's a very interesting
[24:02] a word
[24:09] Israel
[24:10] now
[24:12] in the Strong's Concordance
[24:15] it says
[24:24] God prevails
[24:26] that's the definition they give God
[24:28] prevails
[24:29] in the Scofield bible which is the one
[24:31] brother Branham read it says
[24:35] Prince
[24:38] with God
[24:40] all right so Strong's Concordance uh
[24:45] which is the concordance that's part of
[24:47] the table the old table says God
[24:50] prevails in Schofield Bible it says
[24:52] Prince with God but then when you look
[24:55] at it I went on and I started looking at
[24:57] a lot of different sources for the
[24:59] definition as mean the meaning of this
[25:00] word it's actually quite a complex word
[25:02] it's not a simple word it's actually a
[25:05] combination of three words and it's and
[25:08] it's it was described as a sentence and
[25:10] a word and and the other if you look at
[25:13] other uh concordances and other uh
[25:16] translations it's it is translated
[25:23] let me see here
[25:26] wrestles
[25:29] with God
[25:32] or
[25:37] struggles
[25:39] with God
[25:42] here when it's used this way
[25:45] the center part of this word right here
[25:49] is is is
[25:52] a word that can be a noun
[25:55] or a verb
[25:59] as it's a noun it means Prince or ruler
[26:02] right so as a noun it's Prince or ruler
[26:05] but as a verb it means to fight to
[26:07] wrestle to struggle to contend
[26:10] all right same word and so it it all of
[26:14] these translations are correct so I'm
[26:16] not saying one's right and one's wrong
[26:18] I'm saying the usage of the word if you
[26:20] understand the word it's a very complex
[26:22] word and when we start with with the
[26:25] first part of Israel which this is an
[26:27] English translation this isn't Hebrew
[26:28] but this first part is basically he
[26:33] so he is a prince and L the last part is
[26:37] short for Elohim or God so he is a
[26:41] prince with God or he wrestles and
[26:43] struggles fight with or contends with
[26:45] God and most of the concordances and
[26:48] most of the translations uses it as a
[26:50] verb amen and that and that's a um uh
[26:53] that's that's how it's translated even
[26:55] by the Jews it's it's a verb wrestles
[26:58] with struggles contends because that's
[27:00] what a prince or a leader or a king does
[27:02] Amen they fight for the people they they
[27:05] wrestle they fight and they contend
[27:07] so I want to I want to look at all of
[27:09] these and I don't want to Discount any
[27:10] of them they're all good they're all
[27:12] true they're all accurate and I want to
[27:14] talk about how they all are accurate
[27:17] so if you look at the first one in the
[27:19] Strong's Concordance when it says God
[27:21] prevails amen do you really think that
[27:25] God wanted to beat Jacob in a wrestling
[27:27] match
[27:29] you think that's God's Great goal in
[27:31] life if I could just go down and wrestle
[27:33] I bet I could pin him to the Ground God
[27:35] wasn't wrestling Jacob to win amen he
[27:39] wasn't wrestling Jacob to show that he
[27:41] had more power obviously God when he
[27:43] comes in a form of an Angel has more
[27:45] power than than a human being with with
[27:49] muscles and and send you and tendons and
[27:51] all of those things that's not what this
[27:53] is all about this is all about there's a
[27:56] seed inside of Jacob there's something
[27:58] locked within Jacob there's a potential
[28:01] laying there that's in that was in God's
[28:03] mind before the foundation of the world
[28:05] and God has to get that potential out
[28:08] amen and he's got to meet Jacob in a
[28:11] time of desperation because Jacob has
[28:13] been going along living his life
[28:15] accomplishing his things getting the
[28:18] blessing and getting the birthright
[28:19] going and struggling with Laban Amen to
[28:22] overcome and Laban gets the best of him
[28:24] and the wife and and then he gets the
[28:27] best of him with the cattle and then he
[28:28] changes this way it's a it's a battle
[28:30] back and forth in the flesh trying to
[28:33] gain and trying to do all that he's
[28:35] doing but there's something else laying
[28:37] in Jacob God knows he's not a supplanter
[28:40] amen he's my seed amen
[28:43] so God in a time of desperation when
[28:46] when Jacob is desperate when Jacob is
[28:49] weak and Jacob is all alone and he's
[28:51] come to the end of his ability amen God
[28:54] steps on the scene and presents himself
[28:56] to Jacob and begins and Jacob gets a
[28:59] hold of him because now Jacob's in
[29:00] desperation and there's something in
[29:02] Jacob that knows there's something in
[29:04] this man that can bless me
[29:07] why why else would he hold on until he
[29:11] says I will not let you go unless you
[29:13] bless me that means Jacob knew that this
[29:16] Angel this man could bless him amen how
[29:19] did he know I don't know how he knew but
[29:21] he knew and it must have been the
[29:23] knowledge that was locked in the seat on
[29:25] the inside of him that he knew that if I
[29:27] ever going to be blessed if I'm ever
[29:29] going to get out of this this vessel
[29:31] right here is the one that's going to
[29:33] help me
[29:34] and he got a hold of it and he said I
[29:37] will not let you go except you bless me
[29:39] amen and now there's a struggle amen
[29:42] there's a fight Amen in in the end God
[29:46] Amen touches amen Jacob and weakens
[29:49] Jacob to where he changes Jacob's walk
[29:52] and changes Jacob's life from then on
[29:55] Jacob is never the same
[29:58] and then he gives him a new
[30:00] identification
[30:01] you shall no longer be called Jacob
[30:04] but Israel
[30:09] it looked like Jacob won that battle
[30:14] but who really won
[30:17] God won
[30:19] God prevailed God had the victory God
[30:23] Amen God wanted to be apprehended amen
[30:27] God wanted to be gotten a hold of God
[30:30] wanted to be stopped in his tracks God
[30:32] wanted to be cried out to he wanted
[30:35] somebody that would hold on to him and
[30:37] not let go until they got the blessing
[30:40] amen and God gave him the blessing amen
[30:43] of a name change
[30:45] amen so the first uh the first
[30:48] definition is absolutely accurate God
[30:50] prevails
[30:52] it looked like Jacob prevailed but God
[30:54] prevailed amen there's so many things in
[30:56] the in the scriptures that we could go
[30:58] to and we're going to go to it here in
[31:00] just a minute but it's absolutely the
[31:02] truth amen it it wasn't the feeble
[31:04] little human being of Jacob that was
[31:06] defeating God it was God defeating Jacob
[31:09] amen it was God having the victory over
[31:12] the Flesh of Jacob so that what Jacob
[31:14] really was which was God down on the
[31:17] inside could come out and display the
[31:20] characteristics that were trapped inside
[31:21] which were what an attribute of God
[31:25] so who won God won
[31:28] I ask you has God ever lost
[31:32] Amen in the Garden of Eden amen God knew
[31:36] that they would fall right and so he
[31:38] made a way in which they could fall and
[31:40] left him on free moral agency to
[31:42] facilitate the fall but never making
[31:45] them fall and never was at his perfect
[31:47] will that they would fall but knowing
[31:49] they would fall because he had a plan of
[31:51] redemption in which he would show his
[31:53] attributes and this was the only way he
[31:55] could show his attributes so when the
[31:57] fall came it looked like God lost but
[32:00] did God lose no God won
[32:04] because it all worked according to his
[32:06] plan
[32:07] so God doesn't lose
[32:10] now this word Prince with God I mean
[32:13] it's an interesting word Prince it it
[32:17] means ruler it means a like a governor
[32:20] or a ruler a prince or a princess a
[32:23] somebody who's in charge amen and he
[32:26] calls him Israel let's look back here at
[32:29] verse 28 he said thy name shall be
[32:31] called No More Jacob but Israel for as a
[32:34] prince has thou power with God and with
[32:36] men and has prevailed this word power
[32:40] here in verse 28 thou Prince hast thou
[32:43] power with God that power is the same
[32:47] word amen that's translated wrestle
[32:49] struggle strength it's a verb it's used
[32:52] here as a verb and it's translated other
[32:54] places as to contend to contend with to
[32:58] wrestle to struggle to fight
[33:01] all right
[33:03] and so what is he saying
[33:06] because as a prince thou has power with
[33:08] God as a prince thou wrestles and
[33:12] struggles and contends with God
[33:17] really strange
[33:20] really really strange because initially
[33:22] we would say that's bad
[33:26] you're struggling and contending with
[33:28] God that's bad and I'll say no that's
[33:32] good
[33:34] that is good amen and I I hope that that
[33:38] God will help me and give me the ability
[33:40] to share what's on my heart so that by
[33:42] the end of this we'll realize that to
[33:44] fight with to struggle with to contend
[33:46] with to wrestle with God Is Not a Bad
[33:48] Thing it's a good thing
[33:51] amen
[33:52] oh I don't forgive you for being quiet
[33:55] just wait and see amen just sit still
[33:57] and see hey man how this goes brother
[34:00] Benham said in the message seed is not
[34:01] air with the shuck he says politics
[34:04] voting and voting out saying this that
[34:06] or the other and the Holy Spirit has no
[34:08] more right-of-way in the church than
[34:09] nothing no more power no more prayer
[34:12] meetings no more agonizing with God to
[34:15] fulfill his word
[34:18] no more believing that the word is still
[34:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[34:22] brother Bam's talking about the modern
[34:23] condition of the church that has cooled
[34:25] off and got lazy and he says there's no
[34:28] more agonizing with God to fulfill his
[34:30] word brother Bannon was but saying that
[34:33] that agonizing with God was a good thing
[34:36] what is that that's agonizing deploring
[34:39] God Amen uh pouring out your
[34:42] supplication to him amen contending with
[34:44] him and wrestling with God for God to
[34:47] keep his word and the church had got
[34:49] lazy and they got lots of days ago and
[34:51] everything would be fine and amen but no
[34:54] more were they agonizing with God to
[34:56] keep his word amen but the church the
[34:58] first church that believed that word
[35:00] amen they would pound on God's door and
[35:02] pound on God's door amen knowing that
[35:04] this word is true and God will keep his
[35:07] word and they would agonize with God
[35:09] what were they doing struggling with God
[35:12] foreign
[35:13] amen
[35:15] amen
[35:17] and I say God liked it
[35:20] because brother branham's condemning the
[35:22] loss of that
[35:24] he's saying it's got cold and formal and
[35:27] they've and the church has lost that
[35:30] Israel is a unique people
[35:33] Jacob was changed his name was changed
[35:35] to Israel and then that became the name
[35:37] of the chosen people of God the whole
[35:40] family then we're called Israel the
[35:41] nation of Israel Israelites amen and and
[35:44] here you have in this title this thing
[35:47] that has to do with ruling and
[35:49] contending and struggling amen with God
[35:51] and and there are special people to God
[35:54] they're those that are are ruling amen
[35:57] you would say with God or in conjunction
[36:00] with God they have power with God they
[36:03] can Prevail it's it's this is an
[36:06] interesting name in this way because
[36:08] this is not the kind of relationship
[36:11] where we think about God and his people
[36:13] and that kind of relationship God is
[36:16] here the people are here God says the
[36:19] people do there's no question
[36:21] is that right there's no question
[36:24] there's no dialogue there's no
[36:26] discussion God says it we do it God says
[36:30] it we do it but you'll find as God's
[36:33] dealing with his people it's not that
[36:35] kind of relationship
[36:37] that God is calling out a people and
[36:40] this is the kind of people that will
[36:42] talk back to God and say God I mean he
[36:46] called out Abraham and when he called
[36:48] out Abraham Abraham would would enter
[36:50] into a relationship with God God wasn't
[36:53] wanting to be the distant deity that
[36:55] gave out decrees and the people like ten
[36:58] soldiers obeyed he wanted a relationship
[37:00] with a people that would discover him
[37:03] that would learn about him that would
[37:04] hold on to him that would turn him that
[37:07] would call him on the scene
[37:09] he wanted a different kind of people a
[37:12] different kind of relationship and he
[37:14] shows it in the name Israel this is what
[37:16] he's looking for he calls Abraham and he
[37:19] tells Abraham hey I've heard the cry
[37:21] against Sodom and I'm going down to
[37:22] investigate I'm going to destroy Sodom
[37:24] and then and God is walking down uh the
[37:27] road not the road but wherever they're
[37:29] walking they're walking and the planes
[37:31] of memory amen going over to the
[37:33] precipice of the hill to look down maybe
[37:35] upon amen the valley where Sodom is and
[37:38] he says can I keep anything from Israel
[37:41] or from Abraham
[37:45] why because he was the friend of God
[37:48] the Bible said he was a friend of God
[37:50] and God wasn't he wasn't interested in
[37:53] the distant deity he wasn't interested
[37:56] in the decreeing God and the obeying
[37:58] people he wants obey obedience but what
[38:01] he really wants is a people who will
[38:02] know him people who will discover him
[38:05] people who will cry out to him he wanted
[38:07] a relationship with the people
[38:10] he wanted them to be his people and he
[38:12] wanted to be their God
[38:15] and then Abraham then would say uh
[38:20] what if there's 50 righteous people
[38:24] who's he talking to he's talking to God
[38:27] who created the heavens and the Earth
[38:28] God who's perfect in everything he says
[38:31] God who's perfect in all of his ways and
[38:33] now he begins to say
[38:34] um would you destroy that far be it from
[38:37] the god of righteousness to do a thing
[38:40] like that
[38:45] it takes most of our ideology about God
[38:48] and we have a nuclear meltdown when we
[38:50] look at this conversation because with
[38:53] our idea and Concepts about God and
[38:56] people it's like we're ants and and he's
[38:58] this Mighty Giant and he just crushes us
[39:01] at will and that's not what God wants
[39:05] that's not his imagery that's not his
[39:08] desire remember Abraham didn't come to
[39:10] God God came to Abraham because God
[39:12] wanted Abraham
[39:14] and he wanted Abraham to separate
[39:16] himself from everything so that God and
[39:18] Abraham could be friends
[39:22] amen
[39:24] and a friend Jesus even tells his
[39:26] disciples I'll no longer call you
[39:28] servants amen but friends for the
[39:31] servant doesn't know what his master
[39:32] doing amen but the friend knoweth amen
[39:35] now Jesus is telling them I do I'm not
[39:38] looking for servants I'm looking for
[39:40] friends
[39:44] oh there's a lot in this name Israel
[39:48] amen your servant can't say much to you
[39:53] but your friend can ask you a lot of
[39:55] questions
[39:57] amen
[39:58] and now Abraham says now why what if
[40:02] there's 45 and what if there's 40 and
[40:04] and what if there's 30 and and what's he
[40:07] doing he is contending with God
[40:10] he is interceding for some God has
[40:12] already said I've heard the Cry The Cry
[40:14] is great I'm going down I'm going to
[40:16] destroy it God's already spoke you think
[40:18] God spoke that's it I buttoned my lip I
[40:20] don't say anything more that's not the
[40:22] way it works in the Bible
[40:26] he says
[40:28] God of all Heaven and Earth wouldn't do
[40:31] a thing like that he says all spirit for
[40:33] 40. would you spare it for 30 would you
[40:36] spare it for 25 would you spare it for
[40:38] this and that and he gets down here
[40:41] and and Abraham says let me see if I can
[40:44] find it yeah Abraham says behold now I
[40:47] have taken upon me to speak unto the
[40:49] Lord
[40:50] per Adventure there shall be 20 found
[40:52] there and he said I will not destroy it
[40:54] for 26. he said oh let not the Lord be
[40:57] angry and I will speak yet but this once
[40:59] per Adventure 10 shall be found there
[41:01] and he said I will not destroy it for
[41:03] Ten's sake
[41:04] and the Lord went his way as soon as he
[41:06] had left communion with Abraham and
[41:08] Abraham returned to his place
[41:11] God was in
[41:18] he was in
[41:20] entering session
[41:22] he was in Abraham was contending for a
[41:26] lot
[41:27] and he was asking God what about this
[41:30] and what about that and what about this
[41:32] he wasn't just saying oh well whatever
[41:35] will be will be no he's getting a hold
[41:38] of God and he's saying he's in a special
[41:40] relationship with God where he can say
[41:42] God why would you do this if there's 50
[41:45] that wouldn't be right to do that would
[41:46] it that doesn't seem according to your
[41:48] nature that doesn't seem according to
[41:50] your word why would you do that amen and
[41:53] God says well I'll spare it for 50 and
[41:55] then he keeps going all the way down
[41:57] until God leaves off talking to Abraham
[41:59] and walks away because he can't go any
[42:01] lower
[42:04] amen God I would I this is Brother Chad
[42:09] I could be wrong but it looks to me like
[42:11] God wants a people that will contend
[42:14] with him
[42:15] that God wanted a people and he gave the
[42:18] name to Jacob when Jacob wrestled with
[42:21] God he says and and Jacob wanted a
[42:23] blessing this is your blessing amen
[42:26] watch your name you're not a supplanter
[42:28] you're not a deceiver amen you you're a
[42:31] wrestler with God you're a prince with
[42:33] God you've got power with God and with
[42:36] man that power with God means you're a
[42:39] wrestler a fighter a struggler a
[42:41] contender with God
[42:43] you're in a special relationship you're
[42:45] one of the few that can talk to God and
[42:48] implore God
[42:50] amen and that was Israel those were his
[42:53] people and that was the relation that's
[42:55] the name that he gave to Jacob that
[42:57] changed Jacob's identification and Jacob
[43:00] began to realize amen that now I'm not
[43:04] just oh my goodness I'm not just a
[43:07] nobody I'm not just a roused about I'm
[43:09] not just a deceiver grabbing things
[43:11] through deception but there's something
[43:13] more to me than what I ever thought and
[43:16] this Angel when he blessed me he blessed
[43:17] me with an identification that gave me
[43:20] power with God
[43:25] oh my goodness
[43:28] it is wonderful
[43:31] Jesus tells us the parable of the unjust
[43:33] judge
[43:34] and in Luke chapter 18 he begins to tell
[43:37] his disciples in verse 1 and he spake a
[43:40] parable unto them to this end that men
[43:42] ought always to pray and not to faint
[43:43] saying there was in a city a judge which
[43:46] feared not God neither regarded man and
[43:49] there was a widow in that City and she
[43:51] came unto him saying avenge me in my
[43:53] adversary and he would not for a while
[43:55] but afterward he said within himself
[43:57] though I fear not God nor regard man yet
[44:00] because this Widow troubles me I will
[44:03] avenge her lest by her continual coming
[44:05] she weary me listen listen this is Jesus
[44:09] giving this story
[44:12] and he's teaching the disciples a lesson
[44:15] something he wants them to learn
[44:22] and the Lord said hear what the unjust
[44:24] judge saith and shall not God avenge his
[44:27] own elect which cried day and night unto
[44:29] him though he bear along with them I
[44:32] tell you that he will avenge them
[44:33] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[44:35] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[44:37] Earth
[44:37] he's talking to the disciples and and to
[44:41] me if it was me I wouldn't have used
[44:43] that example
[44:45] I wouldn't have used an example where
[44:47] you constantly knock on the door where
[44:50] you're constantly ask and and you
[44:52] constantly are bothering the judge until
[44:55] the judge finally grows weary of your
[44:57] constant bothering and he gives you what
[44:59] you're wanting I if it was me writing
[45:02] the Bible I would have never wrote that
[45:03] story that way because in my religious
[45:06] Notions and my religious upbringing I
[45:08] would have said don't bother God just
[45:10] say God if it's your will I have this
[45:13] I'll have it if not I'm not and leave it
[45:15] alone and don't ever say anything else
[45:17] about it
[45:18] because I had the Ant and the giant
[45:21] concept of me and God growing up all of
[45:23] my life now God was here and I was down
[45:25] here but that's not what God wants God
[45:27] was constantly lifting his people up and
[45:30] bringing them into dialogue with himself
[45:34] praise be to God
[45:37] brother bear said in the message be not
[45:39] afraid of his eye says that's right
[45:41] friend you know prayer changes the mind
[45:43] of God
[45:45] this is so
[45:46] interesting
[45:48] because he's going to say the exact
[45:50] opposite here in a few minutes
[45:55] that's right friends you know prayer
[45:57] changes the mind of God God sent a
[45:59] prophet up to a man one day and said he
[46:00] said set your house in order you're
[46:02] going to die he turned his face to the
[46:05] wall and prayed earnestly and said Lord
[46:06] I beseech you to consider me I've walked
[46:09] before you with a perfect heart I need
[46:11] 15 years
[46:12] and look like God would have spoke right
[46:14] back to the king he was the biggest man
[46:16] in the country but he speaks to his
[46:18] prophet he told Isaiah go back and tell
[46:21] him I heard and I'm going to spare his
[46:23] life
[46:25] I I believe it was King Hezekiah amen
[46:28] Isaiah come and gave him the word of the
[46:30] Lord
[46:31] the word of the Lord says this he turned
[46:33] his face to the wall and began to
[46:35] contend with God
[46:37] he began to ask for more time and begin
[46:39] to tell God why he needed more time amen
[46:42] and God stopped Isaiah and brother
[46:44] Branham dramatizes it you know Isaiah he
[46:46] goes up and delivers the word and all
[46:48] the the heads of state heard it and he's
[46:51] walking across the courtyard and God
[46:52] says go back and he's like go back I
[46:55] just they all heard me tell him
[46:58] go back go back and tell him that I
[47:01] heard him and I'll extend his life
[47:08] then brother Branham comes
[47:10] and the message does God ever change his
[47:13] mind about his word he said God don't
[47:14] change his mind
[47:16] he stays right with his word
[47:20] prayer changes the mind of God but God's
[47:23] mind never changes
[47:27] that's a good one
[47:29] I'm not gonna write nothing down
[47:31] I don't even know what to write down
[47:35] prayer changes the mind of God but God's
[47:37] mind doesn't change
[47:43] this is so wonderful
[47:45] it's so mind-boggling on a human
[47:48] perspective on a carnal understanding of
[47:51] making one plus one always equal two but
[47:54] when you go a little higher into the
[47:55] Realms of God Amen it starts to paint a
[47:58] picture that's absolutely wonderful
[48:01] he says and the message does God change
[48:04] his mind he says you know we can change
[48:06] our mind because we learn a little
[48:08] different we know we are wrong but I
[48:11] don't believe that God can change his
[48:12] mind
[48:13] because if he does then he certainly
[48:15] could not be infinite
[48:17] and he could make a better decision if
[48:19] he would change it the faith that I have
[48:21] in him that he doesn't change his mind
[48:23] because it if God ever makes a decision
[48:26] he has to stay with that decision
[48:30] is that right
[48:32] now when brother Brandon preaches this
[48:33] in these several messages he says this
[48:35] in 1965 he's preaching about Balaam
[48:38] coming back to God after getting God's
[48:40] perfect answer the first time and God
[48:42] comes back and Balaam comes back to God
[48:44] and then God gives him his permissive
[48:46] will not his perfect will he gave him
[48:48] the perfect will the first time and he
[48:50] goes out in the permissive will amen and
[48:52] that's what brother branham's talking
[48:53] about here when God gives his word he
[48:55] doesn't change his mind
[48:58] but before when God is when brother Ben
[49:00] I'm speaking in several other places
[49:02] he's telling us that Prayer Changes
[49:04] Things prayer changes circumstances
[49:06] prayer changes the mind of God and he
[49:08] said God wants you to cry out for what
[49:11] you want
[49:12] he said that's how a baby gets What It
[49:14] Wants just cried he said you cry and he
[49:17] says the Bible says seek and you shall
[49:19] find knock on the door will be open not
[49:21] seek once knock once but keep seeking
[49:23] keep knocking until the doors open keep
[49:25] crying till when brother Ben he says
[49:27] until you get what you desire
[49:31] so on one hand he's saying contend with
[49:34] God and and change God's mind on the
[49:37] other hand he's saying God never changes
[49:39] his mind
[49:42] I love the Bible
[49:46] let's go to Exodus 32.
[49:52] Exodus 32.
[49:55] and verse 9.
[50:03] Exodus 32 and 9.
[50:06] and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen
[50:09] this people and behold it is a
[50:10] stiff-neck people let now therefore now
[50:13] therefore let me alone that my wrath May
[50:16] Wax Hot against them and that I may
[50:18] consume them and I will make of thee a
[50:20] great nation
[50:23] so God says leave me alone and let me
[50:25] get angry and let me wipe them out and
[50:27] start over with you
[50:30] great that's the word of the Lord
[50:33] verse 11 and Moses besought the Lord his
[50:36] God and said Lord why the thy wrath Wax
[50:38] Hot against thy people which which thou
[50:41] has brought forth out of the land of
[50:43] Egypt with great power and with a mighty
[50:45] hand wherefore should the Egyptians
[50:47] speak and say for Mischief did he bring
[50:50] them out to slay them in the mountain
[50:52] and to consume them from the face of the
[50:54] Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath and
[50:56] repent of this evil against thy people
[51:00] what is Moses doing he's struggling with
[51:03] the Lord he is wrestling with God he's
[51:06] contending with almighty God
[51:10] he said remember listen to them remember
[51:12] Abraham this is how God should speak to
[51:14] his children not his children speak to
[51:16] him
[51:18] remember Isaac and
[51:20] Abraham Isaac and Israel thy servants to
[51:23] whom thou swearest by thine own self and
[51:25] says unto them I will multiply your seed
[51:27] as the stars of heaven and all this land
[51:30] that I have spoken of will I give unto
[51:32] your seed and they shall inherit it
[51:34] forever and the Lord repented of the
[51:37] evil which he thought to do unto his
[51:39] people
[51:42] prayer changes the mind of God God's
[51:45] mind never changes
[51:49] which is it I say it's both
[51:52] because the ultimate plan of God God
[51:55] wasn't going to wipe out those people
[51:57] and start over with Moses amen God
[51:59] here's what brother Branham said and the
[52:02] message Look Away to Jesus from 1963. he
[52:04] said there was another one that puzzled
[52:06] me that was when Moses could tell God a
[52:08] better way than God know how to do
[52:10] anything then Moses said the people will
[52:13] say your God was able to bring you out
[52:15] but not able to keep you and Moses threw
[52:17] himself in the breach then later I found
[52:19] out that that was Christ and Moses
[52:22] standing for the people
[52:25] it wasn't Moses amen it was another part
[52:28] of God in Moses God was contending with
[52:32] God and that's what was happening when
[52:35] Jacob wrestled with the Lord amen it was
[52:37] a part of God wrestling with the part of
[52:40] God God was trying to break through the
[52:42] shell of humanity and bring out the
[52:45] virtue to bring out the life that was
[52:47] trapped inside
[52:49] and now in Moses Moses is playing
[52:52] Another Part amen God's not changing his
[52:55] mind I mean what God is doing is God is
[52:58] laying out his drama God is needing an
[53:01] intercessor God needs somebody Amen to
[53:04] contend with him so that he can manifest
[53:06] himself
[53:08] that's why God Amen from the best I can
[53:12] see in the scripture God did not want
[53:14] this relationship of the the the the the
[53:17] distant deity that's so far away we can
[53:20] never contact him or talk to him we just
[53:22] make sacrifices and hope he's nice to us
[53:26] that's what the pagans had amen but
[53:28] that's not what God wanted amen it
[53:30] wasn't this ah you know I'm God and you
[53:34] you just appease me appease me appease
[53:36] me no he wanted this friendship he
[53:38] wanted this relationship he wanted a
[53:40] people to say God why are you doing this
[53:43] your word says this why don't you why
[53:45] don't you honor your word and stick with
[53:47] what you said the first time
[53:50] hahaha
[53:52] amen why because what's he Desiring to
[53:55] do he's Desiring to manifest himself
[53:57] he's Desiring to manifest what's inside
[54:00] of him amen and he needs a people amen
[54:03] that can stand Toe to Toe with him and
[54:05] say God but your word says I don't
[54:08] understand the situation in my life
[54:10] because your word says that by your
[54:12] stripes I'm already healed and your
[54:14] Prophet came and demonstrated it over
[54:16] and over again why Lord do I have to
[54:19] stay in this condition when your word
[54:21] says you know what God wants God wants
[54:24] somebody that'll act like Israel
[54:26] [Music]
[54:28] God wants a people amen that will that
[54:31] will that will contend with him that
[54:33] will agonize with God to keep his word
[54:37] why so that he can display himself
[54:40] so that he can manifest his word amen
[54:43] somebody has to act the other part amen
[54:47] he's acting one part somebody's got the
[54:49] act the other part so that he can
[54:51] display himself
[54:53] so on one level it looks like God
[54:56] changes his mind
[54:58] and let's just say and the carnal
[55:01] understanding of man
[55:03] God changes his mind
[55:06] and the higher understanding of God he's
[55:09] never changed his mind
[55:11] he's fixed his plan he knows the end
[55:13] from the beginning everything's ticking
[55:15] right on time nothing's out of cater all
[55:18] these things have to be this way amen
[55:20] but from man's perspective it looks like
[55:23] God can change his mind
[55:27] but what God wants to do is display
[55:29] himself
[55:31] when he comes in as a judge he needs
[55:34] somebody to be an intercessor
[55:37] amen
[55:39] praise God
[55:41] I'm going to look at this in another
[55:43] story let's turn to first Samuel
[55:45] chapter 25.
[55:49] I tell you friends this little study on
[55:51] the name Israel has just been so
[55:53] enlightening to me
[55:55] it Has Lifted Me into a new place
[55:58] whatever your identity has been in this
[56:01] earth it's wrong
[56:03] when you come forth from Human parents
[56:05] and you were born in an Earthly natural
[56:08] way and you were given a name and and
[56:10] you know brother Branham said in the
[56:12] last message you preached he said it was
[56:13] a great day when I realized I wasn't the
[56:15] son of Charles and Ella Branham
[56:18] he realized he was something other than
[56:21] that that's how this flesh came into
[56:22] existence but down inside he said there
[56:25] was another William Branham amen there
[56:27] was something there was a real me there
[56:29] was a genuineness to who God intended me
[56:32] to be amen and it was locked into this
[56:34] vessel because God wanted to use this
[56:36] vessel to display himself amen but we
[56:39] had to come to a realization I'm not I'm
[56:42] not what my birth certificate says I am
[56:46] I am something else amen there is
[56:49] another certificate called a marriage
[56:51] certificate and it was sealed in heaven
[56:52] before the foundation of the world and
[56:54] it holds my true identity
[56:57] and that true identity means that there
[57:00] was a part of me that has always been
[57:02] with God Amen that was with God before
[57:04] the foundation of the world that God
[57:06] wanted to be expressed in this vessel of
[57:08] clay for this day so that he can express
[57:11] himself amen and what he needs he needs
[57:14] a vessel amen not not somebody who's
[57:17] going to stay bashful and somebody who's
[57:19] going to stay apathetic and somebody
[57:21] who's going to stay lethargic but he
[57:22] needs somebody who's going to actively
[57:24] produce his word by saying God your word
[57:27] says God your word says God your word
[57:29] says
[57:30] then I believe it and I believe you're
[57:32] not a man that you should lie but you're
[57:34] God and there is no lying in you and if
[57:36] you bore stripes on your back for my
[57:38] healing then it's my healing
[57:41] it's already paid for amen God needs
[57:44] somebody that'll get a hold of him when
[57:46] he comes by
[57:49] so that why so that he can display
[57:51] himself
[57:53] we
[57:54] we so much in religious worlds I don't
[57:57] when I say me I don't mean just are we I
[57:59] don't mean just us sitting here but in
[58:01] the religious worlds of Christianity we
[58:03] get we get such poor ideas
[58:08] and and we just think God's going to do
[58:11] everything
[58:13] and the reality is if anything's going
[58:15] to be done it's going to be God that
[58:17] does it
[58:18] but is it going to be amen God there or
[58:22] God here which God's going to do it
[58:24] that's the question
[58:26] amen which God which part of God which
[58:29] attribute which expression we could say
[58:31] which part of God's going to do it amen
[58:34] maybe the part that's in here is the one
[58:36] that needs to get an action amen maybe
[58:38] amen maybe there needs to be a calling
[58:40] Jesus on the scene amen because G a part
[58:44] of Jesus the part of the life of Jesus
[58:46] is dwelling in here amen
[58:49] oh praise God
[58:51] let's look at first first Samuel 25.
[58:56] verse 2.
[58:59] and there was a man in Mayon whose
[59:03] possessions were in Carmel and the man
[59:04] was very great and he had three thousand
[59:06] sheep and a thousand goats and he was
[59:09] shearing his sheep and caramel now the
[59:11] name of the man was nabel and the name
[59:13] of his wife Abigail and she was a woman
[59:15] of good understanding
[59:17] and of a beautiful countenance but the
[59:19] man was the man
[59:21] was churlish and evil in his doings and
[59:24] he was the of the House of Caleb
[59:27] so this is the story of Naval and
[59:29] Abigail and David but it's just so
[59:31] beautiful I want to look at this
[59:32] together let's go down to verse 21.
[59:35] now David had said surely in vain hath I
[59:38] kept all this fellow
[59:40] hath in the wilderness so that nothing
[59:42] was missing of all the pertaineth unto
[59:44] him and he had to requited me evil for
[59:47] good David sent down some young men to
[59:49] tell him hey we've been protecting you
[59:51] now we need some food would you share
[59:53] some of your Bounty with us because
[59:54] we've been keeping you from Raiders
[59:56] you've been prospering under our care
[59:57] and nabel said no I have nothing to do
[59:59] with David called him a rebellious
[1:00:01] servant and sent him back so David goes
[1:00:04] down he straps on his sword to go down
[1:00:05] and kill nabel and that's where we are
[1:00:08] in the story in verse 22 so and more
[1:00:10] also do God unto the enemies of David if
[1:00:13] I leave of all that pertain to him by
[1:00:15] the Morning Light any that pisseth
[1:00:17] against the wall and when Abigail saw
[1:00:19] David she hastened and lighted off the
[1:00:22] ass and fell before David on her face
[1:00:24] and bowed herself to the ground amen
[1:00:27] when when the young when the when the
[1:00:29] young men left and nabel sent them away
[1:00:30] there was a servant that went to Abigail
[1:00:32] and told her what did what nabel had
[1:00:34] done to David and she quickly gathered
[1:00:38] up all that she could grab a hold of and
[1:00:40] then laid in them Onassis and began to
[1:00:42] take him out to meet David and listen to
[1:00:44] the dialogue this is what I want us to
[1:00:46] catch is the conversation she has with
[1:00:48] David
[1:00:50] verse 24 and fell at his feet and said
[1:00:53] upon me my Lord upon me let this
[1:00:55] iniquity be and let thy handmaid I pray
[1:00:58] thee speak in thine audience and hear
[1:01:00] the words of thine handmaid
[1:01:02] let not my Lord I pray thee regardless
[1:01:04] man of Belial even nabel for as his name
[1:01:07] is so his nabel so he so as he enabled
[1:01:11] is his name and Folly is with him Nable
[1:01:14] means a fool
[1:01:16] here's a man with a name
[1:01:19] and he's playing the role of his name
[1:01:24] Jacob was playing the role of his name
[1:01:26] that's why he needed a new name
[1:01:29] nabels playing the role of his name he's
[1:01:31] a fool
[1:01:33] and says so as he enabled as his name
[1:01:35] and Folly is with him but I thine
[1:01:37] handmaid Saul not the young men of my
[1:01:39] Lord whom thou did send now therefore my
[1:01:42] Lord as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul
[1:01:44] liveth seeing the Lord hath withholden
[1:01:47] thee from coming to shed blood and from
[1:01:49] avenging thyself with thine own hand now
[1:01:52] let thine enemies and then they seek
[1:01:55] evil to my Lord be as Nable
[1:01:57] and now this blessing which thine
[1:01:59] handmade hath brought unto my Lord let
[1:02:01] it even be given unto the young men that
[1:02:03] follow my Lord I pray thee forgive the
[1:02:06] trespass of thine handmaid for the Lord
[1:02:08] will certainly make my Lord a sure house
[1:02:10] because my Lord fighteth the battles of
[1:02:13] the Lord and evil hath not been found in
[1:02:15] thee all thy days
[1:02:17] yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to
[1:02:19] seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord
[1:02:22] shall be bound in the bundle of life
[1:02:23] with the Lord thy God and the soul of
[1:02:26] thine enemies them shall he sling out as
[1:02:29] out of the middle of a sling and it came
[1:02:31] to pass when the Lord when the Lord
[1:02:33] shall have done to my Lord according to
[1:02:36] all the good that he hath spoken
[1:02:38] concerning thee and shall have appointed
[1:02:40] thee ruler over Israel that this shall
[1:02:43] be no grief unto thee nor offense of
[1:02:45] heart unto my Lord either that thou has
[1:02:47] shed blood causeless or that my Lord
[1:02:50] hath Avenged himself but when the Lord
[1:02:52] shall have dealt well with my Lord then
[1:02:54] remember thine handmaid
[1:02:56] uh what's Abigail saying surely the
[1:02:59] prophecy of Samuel is going to come to
[1:03:01] pass in your life
[1:03:03] surely and when it does don't think back
[1:03:07] to this don't go down and shed blood
[1:03:09] ceaseless don't let this be a reproach
[1:03:12] against your name because at this point
[1:03:14] David had never killed Israelites he had
[1:03:17] only killed the enemy
[1:03:20] this would be the first time that he
[1:03:22] would kill of his own people amen and
[1:03:24] now Abigail's standing in the Gap not to
[1:03:27] protect nabel she's standing in the Gap
[1:03:29] to protect David
[1:03:31] to protect his kingdom to protect his
[1:03:33] name to protect his reputation
[1:03:36] and now listen
[1:03:39] he says
[1:03:41] verse 32 and David said to Abigail
[1:03:44] blessed be the Lord God of Israel which
[1:03:46] sent thee this day to meet me
[1:03:51] and blessed be thy advice
[1:03:55] listen
[1:03:56] this is the money next in line to be
[1:03:58] king he's a mighty warrior and a mighty
[1:04:00] ruler and here this woman the wife of
[1:04:03] his enemy amen Abel uh who just rejected
[1:04:06] him she's imploring him don't stay in
[1:04:09] your reputation don't let this be a mark
[1:04:11] in your path you're going to come you're
[1:04:14] going to be uh your life is bound with
[1:04:17] the Lord you're going to come to your
[1:04:18] position don't do this
[1:04:21] and he says blessed be your advice
[1:04:25] Blessed Be Thy advice and blessed be
[1:04:27] thou which has kept me this day from
[1:04:29] coming to shed blood and from avenging
[1:04:31] myself with mine own hand
[1:04:33] for in very deed as the Lord of God of
[1:04:35] Israel liveth which hath kept me back
[1:04:37] from hurting thee except thou had hasted
[1:04:40] and come to meet me surely there had not
[1:04:43] been left enabled by the Morning Light
[1:04:45] any that pisseth against the wall
[1:04:47] so David received of her hand that which
[1:04:49] she had brought him and said unto her go
[1:04:52] up in peace to thine house see I have
[1:04:55] hearkened to thy voice and have accepted
[1:04:58] thy person
[1:05:00] the reason I wanted to go through this
[1:05:02] is because here's a humble little woman
[1:05:05] but she is wise in understanding
[1:05:08] here she is she's trapped in a bad
[1:05:11] situation she's married to a fool and he
[1:05:13] rejects David and but she knows David's
[1:05:16] coming into his kingdom and she goes and
[1:05:18] stands into the Gap and she tells David
[1:05:20] she starts instructing David she reminds
[1:05:23] him of the prophecy over his life she
[1:05:25] reminds him of what he's coming to and
[1:05:27] she tells him don't do this thing that
[1:05:29] will Mar that when you get to that day
[1:05:31] amen she what's she doing she's talking
[1:05:34] like Moses spoke to God
[1:05:39] and we know what happened she goes back
[1:05:41] into the neighborhood what she did and
[1:05:42] nabel dies his heart turns to Stone he
[1:05:44] dies and what does David do David said
[1:05:47] That's my kind of woman
[1:05:51] listen what did David want David wasn't
[1:05:55] looking for the yes sir yes sir yes sir
[1:05:58] wife that's not what David wanted David
[1:06:00] wanted this wife who would talk back to
[1:06:02] him who would contend with him that
[1:06:04] would tell him you know you've got
[1:06:06] better things in your life you're coming
[1:06:08] to a better position don't do this and
[1:06:10] David found her irresistible
[1:06:15] David is a type of Christ amen what is
[1:06:18] Christ one and a bride amen he's not
[1:06:21] want the one who believes that she's all
[1:06:23] the way down here he's all the way up
[1:06:25] here I can't even look his way he he
[1:06:27] he's wanting he's wanting a relationship
[1:06:30] that's much more significant than that
[1:06:34] he's looking for something that's why he
[1:06:35] tells his disciples I'm not going to
[1:06:37] call you service I'm going to call you
[1:06:39] friends he's looking for something
[1:06:40] that's much different than the old
[1:06:42] religious mentality of God so far away
[1:06:45] and me so far down here God Amen by
[1:06:48] Christ Has Lifted us up here so that we
[1:06:51] can talk to him so that we can contend
[1:06:53] with him so that we can remind him of
[1:06:55] his promise that we can remind him of
[1:06:57] what he said
[1:07:00] oh praise God when when when Moses
[1:07:05] starts telling God
[1:07:07] don't you know what the Egyptians will
[1:07:09] say about you
[1:07:12] listen like God didn't know and like God
[1:07:16] cared you know
[1:07:18] what the Egyptians say about him
[1:07:21] but it was the fact that Moses was
[1:07:24] contending with him
[1:07:26] and imploring him and what was Moses
[1:07:28] doing he was drawing Mercy out of God
[1:07:32] and what was Abigail doing to David she
[1:07:36] was drawing Mercy out of David so that
[1:07:38] more of David's attributes could be on
[1:07:40] display and Moses was drawing something
[1:07:42] out of God so more of God could be on
[1:07:45] display
[1:07:48] praise God
[1:07:51] we have to realize we're
[1:07:53] we're more than what we think we are
[1:07:58] and God wants more than what old
[1:08:01] religious Notions
[1:08:03] thought
[1:08:07] maybe God wants you to say God I don't
[1:08:11] understand what your Prophet meant by
[1:08:13] this would you please tell me
[1:08:16] not just if he wants me to know he'll
[1:08:18] tell me
[1:08:19] maybe it's laying there in an obscure
[1:08:21] way and all of a sudden it becomes the
[1:08:24] thing that you're desperate to know
[1:08:26] if you ever come across that something
[1:08:27] in the scripture something in the
[1:08:29] message and all of a sudden this is
[1:08:30] something I just want to know there's
[1:08:32] something in me burning to know this
[1:08:34] amen maybe that's God working on the
[1:08:37] other end amen and he's wanting to give
[1:08:39] you a revelation but you've got to draw
[1:08:41] the Revelation out of God and say God
[1:08:43] please I'm your bride would you reveal
[1:08:46] this word to me amen would you show me
[1:08:48] what this means
[1:08:50] praise be to God
[1:08:53] you know
[1:08:55] there's a there's a story in second
[1:08:57] Samuel 12 where David and Bathsheba they
[1:09:01] have this adulterous relationship and
[1:09:03] there's a child born and the child turns
[1:09:06] sick
[1:09:08] and when the child is sick David is
[1:09:11] fasting
[1:09:12] and laying on his face on the ground and
[1:09:16] fasting so that his servants are afraid
[1:09:18] to approach to him
[1:09:20] and I want to I want to pick this up and
[1:09:22] just read a portion
[1:09:25] verse 16 David therefore besought God
[1:09:27] for the child and David fasted in
[1:09:29] winning and lay all night upon the Earth
[1:09:31] and the odors of his house arose and
[1:09:33] went to him to raise him up from the
[1:09:34] Earth but he would not neither did he
[1:09:36] eat bread with them
[1:09:37] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:09:39] that the child died
[1:09:42] seven days
[1:09:44] he laid on his face and wouldn't eat
[1:09:47] and wept and cried out to God
[1:09:50] seven days
[1:09:52] but I want you to look at this
[1:09:55] came to pass on the seventh day that the
[1:09:57] child died
[1:09:59] and the Servants of David feared to tell
[1:10:01] him that the child was dead for they
[1:10:03] said behold while the child was yet
[1:10:05] alive we spake unto him and he would not
[1:10:08] hearken into our voice how will he then
[1:10:10] Vex himself if we tell him that the
[1:10:12] child is dead but when David saw that
[1:10:14] his servants whispered David perceived
[1:10:16] that the child was dead therefore David
[1:10:18] said unto his servants is the child dead
[1:10:20] and they said he is dead then David
[1:10:23] arose from the earth and washed and
[1:10:25] anointed himself and changed his apparel
[1:10:27] and came into the house of the Lord and
[1:10:29] worshiped then he came to his own house
[1:10:31] and when he required they set bread
[1:10:34] before him and he did eat now this is so
[1:10:37] strange
[1:10:38] because when the child is sick David's
[1:10:41] fasting and weeping before the Lord and
[1:10:44] interceding and laying on his face on
[1:10:46] the earth for seven days as soon as the
[1:10:48] child's dead now he's not weeping and
[1:10:50] fasting and crying now he gets up washed
[1:10:53] himself anoints himself change his
[1:10:54] apparel and sits down to dinner to eat
[1:10:58] and his servants are confused
[1:11:01] and it says verse 21 then said his
[1:11:04] servants unto him
[1:11:05] what thing is this that thou's done thou
[1:11:08] didst and weep for the child and while
[1:11:10] it was alive but when the child was dead
[1:11:12] doubt is rise and eat bread
[1:11:14] and he said well the child was yet alive
[1:11:16] I fasted and wept for I said who can
[1:11:19] tell whether God will be gracious to me
[1:11:21] and the child may live
[1:11:24] what was David doing for seven days he
[1:11:27] was contending with God
[1:11:30] is that right
[1:11:31] he said Who would know if God would be
[1:11:33] gracious to me
[1:11:35] basically if God would answer my prayer
[1:11:38] God would be gracious to me and the
[1:11:40] child may live but now he is dead
[1:11:42] wherefore should I fast can I bring him
[1:11:45] back again I shall go to him but he
[1:11:47] shall not return to me
[1:11:50] David
[1:11:51] was contending with God
[1:11:54] and you know what in all of us
[1:11:56] contending he was contending with God I
[1:11:59] I'll put it this way this is just my
[1:12:01] understanding in the scriptures
[1:12:03] David would have never fasted late on
[1:12:06] the earth for seven days if he didn't
[1:12:09] believe there was a potential for him to
[1:12:11] implore God and for God to change his
[1:12:13] mind
[1:12:15] he laid there for seven days not for a
[1:12:17] show
[1:12:18] he laid there because he didn't know
[1:12:20] maybe God will be gracious with me and
[1:12:22] he had a relationship with God where
[1:12:24] David had spoke to God before amen when
[1:12:27] there was a plague going on over Israel
[1:12:29] amen he was interceding for the people
[1:12:30] and he said Lord let not them suffer for
[1:12:33] my sins
[1:12:34] when he numbered the people he implore
[1:12:36] God and the angel of the Lord stopped
[1:12:38] over Jerusalem and stopped with the
[1:12:39] sword drawn and David made sacrifice
[1:12:41] there and interceded amen David had he
[1:12:45] had contended with God before amen and
[1:12:47] now he's contending with the God again
[1:12:49] it doesn't mean that the will of God
[1:12:51] will not be finished amen the will of
[1:12:53] God will be performed but he knew when
[1:12:55] the child died that that was the period
[1:12:58] that was it that was the will of God and
[1:13:00] he got up and his contending was over
[1:13:01] his his fasting was over his weeping was
[1:13:05] over because God had given his final
[1:13:06] answer
[1:13:07] but until then he believed he could
[1:13:11] change the circumstances
[1:13:13] what a relationship he was in With God
[1:13:16] is what I would say
[1:13:19] I wonder if so many times we just leave
[1:13:21] things alone and we don't pray we don't
[1:13:23] earnestly pray because we don't know
[1:13:26] that he'll hear us or that we could
[1:13:28] change his mind
[1:13:32] I wonder if we don't see ourselves
[1:13:34] correctly
[1:13:36] maybe we view what God wants the wrong
[1:13:40] way
[1:13:41] maybe we're not understanding maybe we
[1:13:44] need to go back and read the Bible
[1:13:47] and find out how God interacted with his
[1:13:50] children and now his children interacted
[1:13:52] with him
[1:13:53] and maybe we'll learn something about
[1:13:56] what God is looking for
[1:13:58] God is looking for somebody to draw
[1:14:00] attributes out of him
[1:14:02] the Apostle Paul was trying a man to
[1:14:05] draw attributes of healing for his body
[1:14:08] and he said three times he sought the
[1:14:10] Lord why was why would he Pray Again
[1:14:14] I mean if you prayed once and nothing
[1:14:16] happened why would he Pray Again
[1:14:17] obviously he believed that he could
[1:14:20] change things
[1:14:21] that God would hear him but after the
[1:14:23] third time he sought the Lord the Lord
[1:14:25] told him I'm not going to heal you
[1:14:28] because this is for your good and then
[1:14:30] he says well praise God anyhow amen I'll
[1:14:33] now glory in my infirmities
[1:14:35] but what was it Paul amen was not just
[1:14:38] taking things the way they were he knew
[1:14:41] that there was a potential for healing
[1:14:43] he knew healing was part of the word and
[1:14:45] he was contending with God until God
[1:14:47] told him I'm not going to do it when he
[1:14:49] said I'm not going to do it he said
[1:14:50] praise God anyhow amen all glory in my
[1:14:53] infirmities
[1:14:54] and David was contending with God while
[1:14:57] there was yet a chance for the child to
[1:14:59] live but when God put the period at the
[1:15:02] end of the sentence he got up and he
[1:15:04] says why should I fast he I he cannot
[1:15:07] come to me but I will go to him David
[1:15:10] had tremendous faith in who he was
[1:15:15] praise God
[1:15:18] I wonder
[1:15:20] if God
[1:15:23] wants us to have
[1:15:25] an identity change
[1:15:28] and not keep seeing ourselves the way
[1:15:31] we've always seen ourselves in the past
[1:15:34] but if we could see ourselves the way he
[1:15:36] sees us
[1:15:41] you know
[1:15:44] when it came to
[1:15:46] job
[1:15:49] was contending with God
[1:15:52] job was saying I wish I knew where his
[1:15:55] house was I would knock on his door and
[1:15:57] I would go up and ask him some questions
[1:16:01] foreign
[1:16:02] is that what job was saying
[1:16:04] I want to know why I'm going through
[1:16:07] this I know that I've kept the word I
[1:16:09] know that I've offered the sacrifice I
[1:16:11] know that I'm righteous amen I don't
[1:16:13] know why God is doing this I look to the
[1:16:15] right he's not there to the left I can't
[1:16:17] perceive him I don't know what's
[1:16:18] happening in my life oh if I could just
[1:16:20] find his house if I could go to where he
[1:16:22] lives if I could knock on his door if we
[1:16:24] can have a conversation then I would
[1:16:26] know amen what did job want job wanted
[1:16:29] to contend with God and find out the
[1:16:31] answer
[1:16:34] amen and God came to job amen job got
[1:16:37] his answer amen and job found out God is
[1:16:40] everything I'm nothing
[1:16:42] but praise God look at job and job
[1:16:45] listen job is going through all of this
[1:16:48] if I can knock on his door if I could
[1:16:50] find out and I don't know why this is
[1:16:52] happening this is not right because I've
[1:16:54] offered the sacrifice this shouldn't be
[1:16:56] I shouldn't be getting punished and all
[1:16:58] of these things going back and forth and
[1:17:00] you would think God would be disgusted
[1:17:01] with job and just walk away but that's
[1:17:04] not the relationship he's in with job
[1:17:06] what's God going to do he's going to
[1:17:08] come down and answer job's question
[1:17:10] job didn't know where to find God he
[1:17:13] didn't know where the door was to knock
[1:17:15] on he didn't know how to get his answers
[1:17:16] but God came to job because God wanted
[1:17:20] to talk to job
[1:17:23] he oh my goodness
[1:17:26] God came to Abraham Abraham didn't come
[1:17:29] to God Amen even when he come to the
[1:17:31] plains of memory and told him about
[1:17:32] Sodom that wasn't something that Abraham
[1:17:34] discerned Abraham knew or Abraham asked
[1:17:37] for it was something that God came to
[1:17:38] him and God told him and when God told
[1:17:41] him amen maybe God was waiting for him
[1:17:43] to intercede
[1:17:45] amen it wasn't it wasn't that Moses
[1:17:48] found God in Mount Horeb it was that God
[1:17:51] found Moses
[1:17:54] it wasn't that Jacob found God God found
[1:17:56] Jacob amen it wasn't that you ever found
[1:17:59] God you never found God you never came
[1:18:01] to God God found you amen he drew you
[1:18:04] unless the father draws you you can't
[1:18:06] come
[1:18:07] amen and what do we see about all of his
[1:18:09] relationships David never found God and
[1:18:12] anoint himself the king God sent Samuel
[1:18:15] to David to anoint him to be king why
[1:18:17] because God wanted David in this
[1:18:19] relationship he wanted Abraham in this
[1:18:21] relationship he wanted a relationship
[1:18:23] with job he wanted a relationship with
[1:18:25] Noah he wanted a relationship with Moses
[1:18:28] he wanted a relationship with Israel he
[1:18:30] wants a relationship with you
[1:18:33] that's why he came to you you didn't
[1:18:35] come to him
[1:18:38] listen we we we act so much and uh I
[1:18:42] wish so bad that I could race all my
[1:18:44] religious training from the back and all
[1:18:46] my wrong understanding and get rid of it
[1:18:48] and understand Bible Way the Bible Way
[1:18:51] amen that God drew me I didn't come to
[1:18:54] him if he drew me he wants me
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] we act so much like amen we're lucky to
[1:19:02] hear the message
[1:19:04] and from the human perspective we should
[1:19:06] never lose that gratitude I'm so
[1:19:09] grateful I feel like the luckiest human
[1:19:10] being but from God's perspective it
[1:19:13] wasn't luck we didn't stumble upon it we
[1:19:15] didn't search it out and find it it
[1:19:17] wasn't us finding him it was God finding
[1:19:20] us
[1:19:21] and God drawing him to ourselves not so
[1:19:24] we could act like we can't talk to God
[1:19:26] and we can't ask for anything and we're
[1:19:28] nobodies that's not he called you like
[1:19:30] he called Abraham like he called Jacob
[1:19:33] he called you the same way
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:37] and he doesn't want you to act like a
[1:19:39] servant he didn't call you to be a
[1:19:41] servant he doesn't want you to act like
[1:19:43] a peon he didn't call you to be a peon
[1:19:45] he called you into a relationship unlike
[1:19:48] has been available to the New Testament
[1:19:51] Church for 2 000 years
[1:19:55] he called us for something different he
[1:19:58] called us to this message to this open
[1:20:00] book under this ministry for what reason
[1:20:02] he wants us in a different kind of
[1:20:05] relationship than the one who's afraid
[1:20:07] to ask for something than the one who
[1:20:08] feels like he can't approach God for the
[1:20:10] one who feels like it'd be wrong to ask
[1:20:12] God why
[1:20:14] listen it's not God wrong to ask God why
[1:20:17] you know brother Branham got in trouble
[1:20:19] because brother Branham said you owe me
[1:20:20] an explanation that was wrong but it
[1:20:23] wasn't wrong to say God I don't
[1:20:24] understand would you please help me
[1:20:29] when you start making demands God's not
[1:20:31] going to reach your demands
[1:20:34] but you can contend with God
[1:20:37] you can struggle with God God why I
[1:20:40] don't understand why
[1:20:41] like I I'm fine with whatever you want
[1:20:44] in my life I'll accept whatever you want
[1:20:46] amen but I don't understand why would
[1:20:48] you please show me why
[1:20:51] praise be to God
[1:20:54] we don't know
[1:20:56] we we don't always act like
[1:20:59] we understand the kind of relationship
[1:21:01] he's called us into
[1:21:07] and this I just want to go just a little
[1:21:09] bit further
[1:21:11] I don't want to cut this off for another
[1:21:12] day I want to finish just 15 more
[1:21:14] minutes maybe
[1:21:16] and the message God gifts always find
[1:21:18] their place he said if there isn't
[1:21:20] something in the name
[1:21:21] then why as long as Jacob was called
[1:21:23] Jacob which means to plan for deceiver
[1:21:25] that's what he was
[1:21:27] but when he wrestled with the Lord all
[1:21:29] night and the Lord changed his name
[1:21:31] when he was about 60 years old he
[1:21:34] changed his name from Jacob to Israel
[1:21:35] Prince before God and that's what he was
[1:21:39] why was Abraham had to be called Abram
[1:21:42] had to be called Abraham before the baby
[1:21:44] could be born why was Sarai called Sarah
[1:21:46] before the baby would be born why was
[1:21:48] Paul why was Saul his name was Saul but
[1:21:52] when he met Jesus he changed it from
[1:21:53] Saul to Paul when Simon was changed from
[1:21:56] Simon to Peter which means little Stone
[1:21:58] and all their names were changed it's
[1:22:00] because what you are called is something
[1:22:02] about it when you speak something it
[1:22:05] identifies itself
[1:22:08] this is why the angel said to Jacob what
[1:22:10] is your name
[1:22:12] who are you who Do You Think You Are
[1:22:15] [Laughter]
[1:22:18] who do you think you are that's why
[1:22:20] Brother Bear would start blasting
[1:22:21] Blasphemous names and saying I'm
[1:22:24] Methodist and I'm about this is what
[1:22:25] he's trying to break apart amen he's
[1:22:28] trying to break apart this whole thing
[1:22:29] and saying I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm
[1:22:32] Presbyterian I'm a brand of might I'm a
[1:22:36] message believer he's trying to break
[1:22:38] all of that apart till you know who you
[1:22:40] really are
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:43] praise God
[1:22:45] so when you speak something and
[1:22:47] identifies itself let's go back to
[1:22:50] Genesis 33. and back to the life
[1:22:55] here of Jacob
[1:22:58] Genesis 33
[1:23:07] Genesis 33 verse 18.
[1:23:13] and Jacob came to Salem
[1:23:15] a city of secum which is in the land of
[1:23:18] Canaan when he came from patanaram and
[1:23:21] pitched his tent before the city and he
[1:23:23] bought a parcel of field where he had
[1:23:25] spread his tent at the hand of the
[1:23:27] children of hamar seacom's Father for a
[1:23:30] hundred pieces of silver
[1:23:32] and he erected there an altar and called
[1:23:34] it
[1:23:35] elohe Israel
[1:23:38] El elohe Israel
[1:23:41] which means this is what this means
[1:23:44] the Mighty God of Israel
[1:23:48] immediately he begins to worship by his
[1:23:52] new identity
[1:23:54] he begins in worship to take the name
[1:23:57] that God gave him amen he begins to
[1:23:59] identify with what the angel said he was
[1:24:02] and he begins to recognize before when
[1:24:05] he was afraid of Esau he said God of My
[1:24:08] Father Abraham and God of my father
[1:24:10] Isaac I'm not worthy of the least of thy
[1:24:12] mercies amen please defend me from my
[1:24:14] brother for I'm afraid of Esau that'll
[1:24:17] kill me and now after he meets the angel
[1:24:19] the angel says you shall not any longer
[1:24:22] be called Jacob but Israel amen and he
[1:24:25] walks away from there a changed person
[1:24:28] and with a different identity and the
[1:24:30] next time we see him worship he builds
[1:24:32] an altar and when he builds an altar
[1:24:34] he's worshiping the Mighty God of Israel
[1:24:37] not the god of Abraham or the god of
[1:24:39] Isaac he's worshiping his God of his new
[1:24:42] identity and he's called him the Mighty
[1:24:45] God of Israel
[1:24:48] he's my God not when I was Jacob but who
[1:24:52] I really am he's the Mighty God of
[1:24:55] Israel
[1:24:58] what a way to worship friends
[1:25:01] he was worshiping with his true identity
[1:25:06] and the message once more brother bear
[1:25:07] says a name you say a name means nothing
[1:25:11] then when then why did God change
[1:25:13] Abram's name to Abraham and why did he
[1:25:16] change Saul's name to Paul and Simon
[1:25:17] name to Peter why did he change his own
[1:25:19] name
[1:25:21] why did he change Jacob to Israel not
[1:25:23] until he wrestled with the Lord not
[1:25:24] until he overcome and when Jesus over
[1:25:27] and when Jesus overcome death Hell In
[1:25:29] The Grave the Bible said he had a new
[1:25:31] name and when Jacob overcome
[1:25:33] and if the church can overcome
[1:25:36] she will stop saying I'm Methodist
[1:25:39] Baptist Presbyterian
[1:25:41] when she can overcome her Creeds in the
[1:25:44] world that she's then the world that
[1:25:46] she's drawed her in there she'll come
[1:25:48] back to the Bride of Jesus Christ misses
[1:25:51] Jesus Christ
[1:25:53] that's what what's that that's a
[1:25:54] different name it's not the name of a
[1:25:56] church it's not the name of a
[1:25:58] denomination it's not a name of a group
[1:26:00] belief amen it's a name of individuals
[1:26:03] that have United with Christ and if
[1:26:05] they'll ever quit calling ourselves this
[1:26:07] and calling ourselves that we'll come
[1:26:09] back to our true identity
[1:26:13] in Acts chapter 15 I'm going to read the
[1:26:16] scripture Acts chapter 15.
[1:26:26] that's chapter 15 and verse 14.
[1:26:33] so Simmons have declared how God at the
[1:26:35] first did visit the Gentiles to take out
[1:26:38] of them a people for his name what is he
[1:26:41] going to the Gentiles for to take out of
[1:26:42] people for his name
[1:26:45] and to this agree the words of the
[1:26:46] Prophet as it is written
[1:26:49] after this will I return and will build
[1:26:52] again the Tabernacle of David which has
[1:26:53] fallen down and I will build again the
[1:26:55] ruins thereof and will set it up that
[1:26:57] the residue of the men might seek after
[1:26:59] the Lord and all the Gentiles are upon
[1:27:01] whom my name is called saith the Lord
[1:27:04] who doth all these things
[1:27:07] God is now turning to the Gentiles and
[1:27:11] he's looking for a people that are
[1:27:13] called by his name
[1:27:15] not their denominational names not their
[1:27:18] concept names not their Church name not
[1:27:21] their group name but that are called by
[1:27:22] his name
[1:27:25] and the first seal we know this so well
[1:27:27] but I I just want to rehearse it right
[1:27:29] here he says now watch he said it would
[1:27:31] be known
[1:27:32] in the last day
[1:27:34] but it comes forth in a church symbol
[1:27:36] he's talking about the breaking of the
[1:27:38] seals back in Revelation chapter 6 to
[1:27:40] the church it was a church symbol it was
[1:27:43] broke out so the church could see that
[1:27:44] under the seal was a white horse that
[1:27:46] was just a symbol form that wasn't the
[1:27:48] full Revelation or the interpretation it
[1:27:51] was symbol for him and he sang to the
[1:27:53] church it was a it comes forth in a
[1:27:55] symbol of a church that they know there
[1:27:57] is a seal but just what it is yet they
[1:27:59] don't know because it's a white horse
[1:28:01] rider
[1:28:02] and then only is to be revealed at the
[1:28:04] last day when this actual seal is broken
[1:28:07] broken to who not to Christ but to the
[1:28:10] church notice now oh my that just makes
[1:28:13] me tremble I hope that the church truly
[1:28:15] understands it see what I mean you
[1:28:17] people I'm going to call you bride that
[1:28:21] you'll understand it
[1:28:22] why because in the Sixth Seal it was
[1:28:26] broke to a in a church form in a church
[1:28:29] symbol but now you're not going to be
[1:28:32] identified as the church anymore through
[1:28:34] the denominations but this is a
[1:28:36] different time you're coming out of the
[1:28:38] church ages into the bride age to an
[1:28:41] identification of a different
[1:28:42] relationship you are now going to move
[1:28:45] into the bright age
[1:28:49] and he says hey he wants the people to
[1:28:52] understand that it it wasn't broke amen
[1:28:55] it was just a symbol form to a church so
[1:28:57] if it's still in symbol form you're in
[1:28:59] church amen you're in church ages you're
[1:29:02] in church systems you're in church
[1:29:03] thinking amen but when the seal is
[1:29:05] actually broke when in the end time to
[1:29:08] who to the true church and he says now I
[1:29:11] I'm going to call you bride so that
[1:29:13] you'll understand who's it broke to it's
[1:29:16] broke to the bride
[1:29:18] so when the symbol of White Horse and
[1:29:21] when the sealed is broke under the
[1:29:22] opening of the seals it's broke to who
[1:29:24] not to Christ not to the church ages
[1:29:27] it's not broke to the Methodist and the
[1:29:29] Presbyterian and the Baptist and the
[1:29:31] Pentecostal it is broke to the bride so
[1:29:34] at the breaking of the seals there Comes
[1:29:36] A change in name because there Comes A
[1:29:38] change in dispensation there Comes A
[1:29:40] change in identity and now we have to
[1:29:43] worship with our new name
[1:29:45] not the old name with the old leaven of
[1:29:48] the church ages but under the new name
[1:29:50] under the new identification I'm not
[1:29:52] going to call you church I'm going to
[1:29:54] call you Pride
[1:29:57] now you're not Methodist now you're not
[1:29:59] Baptist now you are Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:06] brother Branham says in the Smyrna
[1:30:07] Church age when he's preaching it back
[1:30:09] in 1960 he says now a church now the
[1:30:12] church name is associated with the
[1:30:14] nature of its character
[1:30:16] oh I want you to catch this
[1:30:19] the church name is associated with the
[1:30:21] nature of its character
[1:30:22] he's referring to church ages
[1:30:26] did you notice the Smyrna meaning bitter
[1:30:29] and you notice each one of the church
[1:30:31] now it's the church name has something
[1:30:33] to do with the character of the church
[1:30:35] I would say something here but I better
[1:30:36] not because you'd get me wrong
[1:30:39] your name does too
[1:30:41] you might not know it but it does oh yes
[1:30:43] you say no it's numerology no it's not
[1:30:46] when Jacob was born they called him
[1:30:47] Jacob which was supplanter but when he
[1:30:49] wrestled with the angel God changed his
[1:30:51] name to Israel a prince is that right
[1:30:53] Saul was Saul of Tarsus a mean fellow
[1:30:56] but when he came to Jesus he was called
[1:30:58] Paul Simon's name was Simon but when he
[1:31:00] came to Jesus he was Peter a little
[1:31:02] Stone your name so say it's what you are
[1:31:05] it has an oppression upon your character
[1:31:10] hey that's so long
[1:31:13] please please
[1:31:15] don't ever refer yourself to yourself as
[1:31:18] a BCF in
[1:31:21] please that's going the wrong direction
[1:31:25] don't refer to yourself in any group
[1:31:28] terminology
[1:31:30] but the one that the prophet gave is the
[1:31:34] one that the Lord has given it's the
[1:31:36] designation for the season your title is
[1:31:39] bride your name is Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:31:42] and if you'll begin worshiping in that
[1:31:45] name and worship the Mighty God of Mrs
[1:31:48] Jesus Christ you're going to be
[1:31:49] worshiping under a new identification
[1:31:51] and it will actually change your
[1:31:54] characteristics
[1:31:56] he says no I want to read that lesson
[1:31:58] your name Associates what you are it has
[1:32:01] an oppression upon your character if
[1:32:03] you're just looking at the group name or
[1:32:05] the group Walker or we all believe the
[1:32:07] message that's a title that can mean
[1:32:09] something to so many different people
[1:32:11] amen but what we need is to go past that
[1:32:14] and go a little further and my name is
[1:32:16] not message believer my title is not
[1:32:19] message believer I believe the message
[1:32:20] with all of my heart amen but my title
[1:32:23] is bride and my name is Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:32:29] and in this carnal world you can call me
[1:32:32] Chad
[1:32:34] but I Know Who I Am by the grace of God
[1:32:36] because the seals was broke to the bride
[1:32:42] it has an impression upon your character
[1:32:44] it did upon Jacob
[1:32:46] it changes character and then he had the
[1:32:48] audacity to worship under his new name
[1:32:51] and he had the audacity to claim rights
[1:32:55] to a personal God that was his mighty
[1:32:58] God the Mighty God of Israel
[1:33:01] my God my mighty God the Mighty God of
[1:33:05] my new name the Mighty God of my new
[1:33:07] identity the Mighty God he he's not just
[1:33:10] my father's God he's my God
[1:33:13] and he can't just be the church is God
[1:33:16] he can't just be the prophets God he
[1:33:19] can't just be your parents God he's got
[1:33:21] to be your God he's got to be a personal
[1:33:23] God and he can't be the god of the Bride
[1:33:26] that's true he's the god of the Bride
[1:33:27] he's the god of the whole world he's the
[1:33:29] god over everything amen that's all true
[1:33:31] but you need him to be your God and you
[1:33:34] need to know your bride
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:37] it will change
[1:33:40] it will have an impression upon your
[1:33:42] character
[1:33:43] now anybody can say anything
[1:33:46] I'm Brian I'm Brian I'm Brian I'm Brian
[1:33:48] my name is Mrs Jesus Christ that doesn't
[1:33:50] change anything but when it comes from a
[1:33:52] revelation of the heart when you know
[1:33:54] you've wrestled it out with the Lord and
[1:33:56] he has given you an identity chain and
[1:33:59] now you're willing to say what he said
[1:34:01] to you what he revealed to you that I am
[1:34:04] part of his bride I'm a member of his
[1:34:06] bride I'm part of his body I've taken
[1:34:08] his name his name is my name I'm under
[1:34:12] his name
[1:34:14] it'll change our worship it'll change
[1:34:16] our characteristics it'll change our
[1:34:18] actions it'll change the way we think
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:24] brother Branham said in the Legacy in
[1:34:26] church age out of the church age book he
[1:34:27] says the name laodicea which means
[1:34:30] people's rights
[1:34:33] listen remember what he said about
[1:34:34] Smyrna he said a church name
[1:34:37] has to do with its characteristics
[1:34:39] I want to go back and read that one more
[1:34:41] time
[1:34:43] when he was in when he's preaching the
[1:34:46] Smyrna Church age
[1:34:49] he said the church name is associated
[1:34:51] with the nature of its character
[1:34:55] so now he says the name laodicea which
[1:34:57] means people's rights
[1:34:59] brother Branham also said it meant
[1:35:01] lukewarm
[1:35:02] and it also meant rich and increased
[1:35:04] because those are all the
[1:35:05] characteristics that are associated with
[1:35:07] the name laodicea rich and increased
[1:35:09] with Goods that have needed nothing amen
[1:35:12] lukewarm
[1:35:14] those are all characteristics associated
[1:35:16] with laodicea and the definition of the
[1:35:18] of the Greek word laodicea is people's
[1:35:20] rights
[1:35:22] the name literacy which means people's
[1:35:24] rights was very common and was given to
[1:35:26] several cities in honor of Royal ladies
[1:35:28] so named
[1:35:29] so it's a woman's name it's a Church's
[1:35:31] name
[1:35:32] and that Church's name laodicea has
[1:35:36] something to do with its characteristics
[1:35:38] and leaves an impression
[1:35:41] that is why we cannot be laodicean
[1:35:44] believers
[1:35:45] we cannot take that name
[1:35:47] we cannot come under that dispensation
[1:35:50] and under that name because that name
[1:35:52] brings characteristics to our life
[1:35:55] and the characteristics that that brings
[1:35:58] is it brings a state of thinking you're
[1:36:00] fine when you're not
[1:36:03] and it brings a state of thinking you
[1:36:05] have rights and you've achieved
[1:36:06] something and things belong to you when
[1:36:08] they don't
[1:36:10] and it'll bring you into a lukewarm
[1:36:12] condition where you think everything's
[1:36:14] fine I'm blessed I have no need
[1:36:16] everything's fine with me and you don't
[1:36:18] it brings a blindness where you do not
[1:36:21] realize your poor blind miserable
[1:36:23] wretched naked and I'm and you don't
[1:36:26] have anything going for you but you
[1:36:27] think everything's fine that's what
[1:36:30] laodicea that's the characteristics of
[1:36:32] laodicea that's why we cannot be
[1:36:34] laodicean believers
[1:36:38] we've got to move out of laodicea into
[1:36:40] the bride age and be part of the Bride
[1:36:42] we cannot stay in a laodicean condition
[1:36:45] under a laodicean title
[1:36:48] because it has an influence on our
[1:36:51] character
[1:36:53] brother man said in God's provide a
[1:36:55] place of worship he says now we've
[1:36:57] already resurrected the Dynamics and the
[1:36:58] mechanics is going to work quickening us
[1:37:00] and we're quickened up into the presence
[1:37:02] of God where his spirit is and now we
[1:37:05] are seated together in Heavenly places
[1:37:06] in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus sitting
[1:37:09] there that great seat that's already
[1:37:11] fired up been raised from the dead were
[1:37:14] part of it if you're part of the Bride
[1:37:16] you are because the brightest part of
[1:37:18] the groom you know so we find out that
[1:37:21] it's the same thing and she'll do just
[1:37:23] exactly what's predicted for her to do
[1:37:25] in this day she won't be a laodicea
[1:37:29] not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be
[1:37:32] on fire for God she'll be moving on in
[1:37:35] the spirit of God why because she
[1:37:36] doesn't think she's already arrived
[1:37:38] she's recognizing I'm pressing on I'm
[1:37:40] becoming all that he wants me to be as
[1:37:42] his bride
[1:37:45] brother Brown says in the message Feast
[1:37:46] of trumpets he said now if I come with
[1:37:48] the message of Pentecost I would be in
[1:37:50] the laodicean church age and it would it
[1:37:53] wouldn't be right
[1:37:55] that's what he said if I came with the
[1:37:57] pen the message of Pentecost so he can't
[1:37:59] come with the message of Pentecost he
[1:38:01] has to come with the bride's message
[1:38:05] if I come with the message of Pentecost
[1:38:06] I would be in the laodicean church age
[1:38:08] and it wouldn't be right that would be
[1:38:11] wrong so to be in the laodicean church
[1:38:13] age would be wrong to bring the message
[1:38:15] to Pentecost would be wrong
[1:38:17] what would be right is to say come out
[1:38:20] from among her my people be separate
[1:38:22] don't be identified there be identified
[1:38:26] here in the bride age be identified in
[1:38:29] the body of Christ come to Union with
[1:38:31] the word and take a new name you
[1:38:34] yourself personally become Mrs Jesus
[1:38:36] Christ
[1:38:37] don't let it be a blanket title that
[1:38:39] covers everybody no let it be your title
[1:38:45] brother remember said in God's chosen
[1:38:46] place of worship so there's many fine
[1:38:49] women in the building tonight find loyal
[1:38:50] women but there's one Mrs William
[1:38:52] Branham she's the one goes home with me
[1:38:54] she's the one that's my wife
[1:38:57] there's fine people in the world fine
[1:38:59] churches but there's one Mrs Jesus
[1:39:01] Christ
[1:39:02] and that's who he's coming for that's
[1:39:04] where his name Lays
[1:39:07] where's his name is in his bride
[1:39:11] what's his name upon upon his bride
[1:39:15] she's not taken her own identity she's
[1:39:17] not taken another name other
[1:39:19] characteristics now listen you say well
[1:39:22] we don't take names we don't call
[1:39:23] ourselves this we don't call ourselves
[1:39:24] that I I don't just mean what you call
[1:39:27] yourself this is how you perceive
[1:39:30] yourself
[1:39:32] because if you perceive yourself in your
[1:39:34] old nature the perception has to change
[1:39:37] to your new name
[1:39:41] there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's
[1:39:43] who he's coming forth that's where his
[1:39:45] name lays there is where his worship is
[1:39:48] in her and her alone
[1:39:53] when when when Jacob now Israel Builds
[1:39:56] an altar amen he is Israel he is the
[1:40:00] prince with God he is the one who
[1:40:02] struggles with and overcomes he's the
[1:40:05] one who can get a hold of God and hang
[1:40:07] on till he gets what he needs he's in a
[1:40:10] special identity a special class of
[1:40:12] person and he builds an altar and he
[1:40:14] calls it the Mighty God of Israel my God
[1:40:17] I'm worshiping my God personal God not a
[1:40:21] group God I'm worshiping the Mighty God
[1:40:23] of Israel right here
[1:40:26] and the question is what God do we
[1:40:29] worship amen I mean God is God God's a a
[1:40:33] generic term amen it means god and
[1:40:35] Elohim and all these other terms we can
[1:40:38] worship that with a mentality amen that
[1:40:41] we're worshiping a a general God out
[1:40:44] there amen but Israel after he wrestled
[1:40:47] with the the Lord he was worshiping a
[1:40:50] personal God the Mighty God that was his
[1:40:53] God
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] Jesus after he resurrects he tells the
[1:40:58] disciple he tells uh Mary Magdalene he
[1:41:01] says go tell my disciples that I go to
[1:41:03] my father and to their father
[1:41:06] he's trying to get them to catch
[1:41:08] something on a personal level and he
[1:41:10] says I'm going to my God and to your God
[1:41:15] Hey listen don't let him be amen just
[1:41:19] the bride the the god of the Bride or
[1:41:21] the bridegroom of the Bride let him be
[1:41:23] your bridegroom amen your personal
[1:41:26] bridegroom the one that you have
[1:41:28] personally come into a union with that
[1:41:30] you can contend with him that you can
[1:41:32] ask him that you can talk to him the way
[1:41:34] Abigail talked to David and stole
[1:41:37] David's heart
[1:41:39] what did David want oh he wanted Abigail
[1:41:43] what did Abigail have she had something
[1:41:45] that the other girls didn't have she was
[1:41:48] able to talk to him on a completely
[1:41:49] different level
[1:41:52] God has never been able to have this
[1:41:55] kind of conversation in the church ages
[1:41:59] amen the seals weren't open his mystery
[1:42:02] wasn't laid bare he hadn't unveiled
[1:42:03] himself amen he had people with partial
[1:42:06] understanding amen praying out was a
[1:42:08] partial understanding partial
[1:42:09] understanding partial understanding but
[1:42:12] now he's got a people that he has
[1:42:13] unveiled himself to so that they can say
[1:42:15] oh God didn't your Prophet say doesn't
[1:42:19] your words say didn't you show us your
[1:42:21] characteristics God I know your plan
[1:42:23] Lord keep your plan in my life
[1:42:27] he wants a woman that can talk to him
[1:42:30] contend with him
[1:42:32] on a totally different level
[1:42:36] that's
[1:42:38] drawing the characteristics out of God
[1:42:42] oh friends
[1:42:43] we've got to climb higher
[1:42:46] we gotta shed all this wrong thinking we
[1:42:49] got to stop thinking like we've been
[1:42:51] thinking and start thinking like the
[1:42:53] word tells us the thing we've got to
[1:42:55] think on Bible terms we've got to think
[1:42:57] on what the prophet brought us and stop
[1:42:59] this carnal I'm no good and I'm I listen
[1:43:03] that's as true as true can being will
[1:43:04] always be true your fleshes go good you
[1:43:08] know what was it Paul said I know that
[1:43:09] it's in me that is in my flesh there is
[1:43:11] no good thing so let's just get that out
[1:43:13] of the way amen how many people here in
[1:43:15] your flesh has no good thing no
[1:43:17] qualities no abilities nothing that
[1:43:19] makes you an inexpenser all right then
[1:43:21] lay that to the side and let's quit
[1:43:22] talking about the kernel and start
[1:43:24] talking about the real reality of your
[1:43:27] life the reality of your life is there's
[1:43:29] nobody else on earth like you
[1:43:31] there's not another one there's a
[1:43:33] specific attribute that God had attached
[1:43:35] to you a thought a manifestation he
[1:43:38] wanted in your life and it cannot be
[1:43:40] copied it cannot be mimicked it cannot
[1:43:42] be imitated it's you there's nobody else
[1:43:45] but you the bridegroom's coming for you
[1:43:47] and nobody else bite you
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:51] worship the bridegroom of you
[1:43:58] this is not group thinking this is not
[1:44:00] denominational thinking he has ripped
[1:44:03] open a whole new level friends
[1:44:05] a whole new relationship a whole new uh
[1:44:09] ability a whole new uh a potential
[1:44:12] and he wants a woman that'll run to him
[1:44:15] and say oh God don't let my co-workers
[1:44:18] see the sickness going in my life I've
[1:44:20] told him your word is true I told him
[1:44:22] that by your stripe is healed don't let
[1:44:24] them mock you don't let them disbelieve
[1:44:26] your word heal me so that they'll know
[1:44:28] that you're the great God that I said
[1:44:29] you are
[1:44:33] he needs a woman to talk to him
[1:44:37] with revelation
[1:44:39] and understanding Abigail was a woman of
[1:44:42] understanding
[1:44:46] praise God
[1:44:51] is called us
[1:44:53] to an identity change
[1:44:56] this message did not tell us to stay low
[1:45:00] to see him
[1:45:02] stay in a little sin condition
[1:45:05] stay under a Pentecostal message
[1:45:07] it called us into a bright age
[1:45:11] into a new name and a new identity
[1:45:15] and now whatever's on your driver's
[1:45:17] license is inconsequential
[1:45:21] whatever you used to think about
[1:45:22] yourself it doesn't matter
[1:45:25] once Jacob come in contact with a living
[1:45:27] God
[1:45:28] what he was before didn't matter anymore
[1:45:31] what he was afraid of before didn't
[1:45:33] matter anymore what others thought of
[1:45:35] him didn't matter anymore he knew who he
[1:45:37] was and he knew who was God was
[1:45:40] and now if we could come the same way
[1:45:42] and to listen this is the Living God
[1:45:45] this is the reality that we can get a
[1:45:48] hold of amen and grab a hold of it and
[1:45:50] say God I'm not going to let you go
[1:45:52] until you give me an identity change
[1:45:55] till you bless me and change my name I
[1:45:58] don't want to go on in the same carnal
[1:46:00] thinking with the same carnal desires
[1:46:02] and the same natural this and that I got
[1:46:05] to have a change in my life will you
[1:46:07] bless me by giving me a change in
[1:46:10] identification
[1:46:12] I can stand over you and say your bride
[1:46:14] I can say you're Mrs Jesus Christ but if
[1:46:17] your mind doesn't change your heart
[1:46:19] doesn't grab it it doesn't mean a thing
[1:46:21] you can say yay man that's nothing but
[1:46:23] the truth because you're thinking in
[1:46:24] general terms amen but the angel came to
[1:46:27] Jacob when he was alone
[1:46:30] and gave him his personal identification
[1:46:33] so that it could not be shared with
[1:46:35] anybody else there was nobody there to
[1:46:37] share it with
[1:46:41] and we've got to come in contact when
[1:46:43] God passes you away how's he passing
[1:46:45] your way he's passing your way tonight
[1:46:47] friends
[1:46:48] just open your eyes and see that this is
[1:46:51] the living breathing Jesus Christ he's
[1:46:53] being manifest in his word he is the
[1:46:55] word he's the word that's been unveiled
[1:46:57] in this day and he's passing by get a
[1:46:59] hold of him and ask him to change your
[1:47:01] name
[1:47:04] not just in your mouth but in your heart
[1:47:07] change who you are
[1:47:10] oh this is not a game this is not a
[1:47:13] church this is not a social gathering
[1:47:15] this is the reality this is the reality
[1:47:17] of eternities this has been in the back
[1:47:19] part of God's mind for thousands and
[1:47:22] thousands of years before there was time
[1:47:24] this was God's plan and he wants you to
[1:47:27] enter that relationship
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:30] praise be to God I say it's time we
[1:47:34] contend with the Lord and say God I've
[1:47:36] got to have a chain I can't have these
[1:47:38] desires ruling over me another day I
[1:47:40] can't have this lust I can't have this
[1:47:42] grief I can't have any of this God
[1:47:44] you've got to give me a change in my
[1:47:45] identification so that I can take the
[1:47:48] name that changes and influences my
[1:47:50] characteristics
[1:47:52] I've got to know that I'm Mrs Jesus
[1:47:55] Christ that I'm part of that bride that
[1:47:58] I am included and that you're my
[1:48:00] bridegroom
[1:48:03] and that when brother Venom says I no
[1:48:05] longer call you church because I ah I'm
[1:48:08] going to call you bride so you
[1:48:09] understand there's something in you to
[1:48:11] say he's talking to me
[1:48:14] he's talking to me
[1:48:16] you know what if you believe he's
[1:48:17] talking to you too I'm happy for that
[1:48:19] but I believe one thing for sure he's
[1:48:21] talking to me
[1:48:24] can we receive him that way
[1:48:26] can we receive him as talking to me
[1:48:28] listen there's several people in the
[1:48:31] building tonight and everybody's heard
[1:48:33] what I've said amen but I'm asking you
[1:48:35] the question who was he talking to
[1:48:40] was he talking to you
[1:48:43] personally
[1:48:44] was he calling your name personally was
[1:48:48] he drawing you out of a carnal condition
[1:48:51] into a reality of who you really are
[1:48:54] because who you really are is not the
[1:48:56] man you see in the mirror the woman you
[1:48:58] see in the mirror who you really are is
[1:49:00] who you see in the mirror of God's word
[1:49:02] when the veil's been taken away and the
[1:49:05] obscurity has been polished away and now
[1:49:07] you can know even as you're known you
[1:49:09] can see because that which is perfect
[1:49:10] has come because what we do have by
[1:49:12] God's grace is the perfect
[1:49:14] interpretation of the word my Divine
[1:49:16] Vindication so that we're not looking
[1:49:18] into a glass Darkly but we're looking
[1:49:19] into a clear glass and what we see is
[1:49:22] face looking back to face what he is I
[1:49:25] am
[1:49:25] [Applause]
[1:49:26] that's what he's called me to be
[1:49:29] that's what this message came to give us
[1:49:32] an identification to look in the mirror
[1:49:35] not a natural mirror this mirror and
[1:49:37] find out who we are
[1:49:40] I am not Jacob
[1:49:43] I'm Israel
[1:49:46] I I'm not just worshiping
[1:49:50] the god of William Branham
[1:49:53] although it's the same God
[1:49:55] but it's gone deeper inside of me
[1:49:58] and now I'm worshiping The God Who is
[1:50:02] called Chad Lamb who's called me out of
[1:50:05] carnal and called me into himself that's
[1:50:07] the god that I'm worshiping
[1:50:11] is that the god you're worshiping
[1:50:13] are you worshiping your God
[1:50:16] are you worshiping your bridegroom
[1:50:20] that's the one that's the one that'll
[1:50:23] change everything
[1:50:25] let's all stand
[1:50:27] musicians if you could come
[1:50:30] let's just bow our heads
[1:50:32] pray Lord Jesus
[1:50:35] God I have delivered my soul lord
[1:50:38] and I pray that these words would find
[1:50:41] their place Lord
[1:50:43] God that it wouldn't be just a sermon
[1:50:45] preached in a two-hour spin in a church
[1:50:49] service Lord but God made the words that
[1:50:51] you've placed on my heart that you
[1:50:53] brought out under the anointing of your
[1:50:54] spirit may they find their home Lord in
[1:50:57] the hearts and The Souls of your
[1:50:59] children to bring a true identification
[1:51:02] God break the carnal break the old break
[1:51:05] all those things away break out of the
[1:51:08] flesh Lord and bring the reality to
[1:51:09] people's lives
[1:51:11] God help us Lord to not live an old
[1:51:14] identification but help us to keep Lord
[1:51:18] as you keep wooing us and you keep
[1:51:19] telling us who we are and you keep
[1:51:21] Whispering Your Love secrets in our ear
[1:51:23] and you keep calling a sweetheart you
[1:51:25] keep calling us bride you keep calling
[1:51:28] us by your name may we keep acting like
[1:51:30] it Lord and responding to what you're
[1:51:32] calling to the names you're calling Lord
[1:51:34] may we respond to it may our character
[1:51:36] be influenced by what you're calling us
[1:51:39] and may we act like your bride and walk
[1:51:41] like your bride and talk like your bride
[1:51:45] God may we take your name may your name
[1:51:47] be upon us Lord
[1:51:50] so that it's not us the people see but
[1:51:53] it's you
[1:51:54] your name
[1:51:56] lays in your bride
[1:51:59] because she's living out your life
[1:52:02] God make it personal I pray make it a
[1:52:05] living reality first by the foolishness
[1:52:08] of preaching you've chose to save Souls
[1:52:10] we believe it Lord we've done it at your
[1:52:12] bidding and we believe that it'll have
[1:52:14] an effect
[1:52:16] Lord I pray you break Satan's
[1:52:18] strongholds of the Mind
[1:52:21] carnality and past life
[1:52:24] I pray to break those holes off of your
[1:52:26] children
[1:52:27] May the life that's in the seed be
[1:52:29] quickened by the spirit of God May that
[1:52:32] word take root and may it bring a new
[1:52:34] life Lord
[1:52:36] the one that you've ordained to be
[1:52:37] manifest in this day
[1:52:40] may it bring forth in Israel a contender
[1:52:43] with God a prince with God a wrestler
[1:52:45] with God somebody that will enter into a
[1:52:47] relationship Lord that will that will
[1:52:49] talk to you that will plead with you
[1:52:51] that will agonize with you to keep your
[1:52:54] word
[1:52:55] God help us to be that kind of Bride
[1:52:59] we love you God we ask you blessings
[1:53:01] over us help us Lord as we walk out of
[1:53:04] these doors May these things not fade
[1:53:05] out of our lives but Lord take us into a
[1:53:08] higher plane into a higher walk into a
[1:53:10] greater manifestation
