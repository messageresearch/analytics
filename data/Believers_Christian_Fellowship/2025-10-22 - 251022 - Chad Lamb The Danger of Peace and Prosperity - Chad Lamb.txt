As I climb this gospel ladder, always heeding every sign. And I know my Savior's with me and he's teaching me to climb. Every day that I am climbing, there's a battle for me. Every step on this ladder is another victory. They're holding up this ladder that I'm climbing on. I'm climbing up this ladder and I'm going home this ladder. Oh, what joy there will be.

Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father, because once again, Lord, you've gathered us together, given us the privilege of meeting like this, Lord, to worship you. And God, we've come to the time in the service, Lord, where we look into your word for instruction, for guidance, for life. God, we pray, God, that you would just open to us the word and open our understanding to understand the word. May you give us the eyes sav that we might see the hour in which we live. And God, give us a heart to perceive all that you're trying to say to us. And may this word be a lamp into our feet and a light into our path. May it guide us, Lord, in this journey that we're on. And God, I pray you would take the preeminent place among us as you come. May you sit at the head of the table. May you take the bread and break the bread. May you feed it to us now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. While you're standing, maybe we could take our Bibles to the book of First Corinthians. While you're turning there, I just wanted to let you know and remind you that um Brother Jordan and Sister Rebecca Simons and their baby that had passed away, they're going to have a memorial service tomorrow at their church uh um there in Saskatchewan. So, remember them in prayer, please. There's information on the bulletin boards if you'd like to know when and where you can log on to see that. They'll be streaming that. So, just remember to keep the family in prayer. I'm sure tomorrow will be a very tough day for them. Amen. Also, we've got some visitors here from Phoenix again. The Laos have their family again. So, God bless you. It's good to see you. They are no strangers to us. They've been here a few times, but it's good to have you always. So, God bless you all very much. And the Arts have a family member with them. They got a stepson, Karine. God bless you. It's good to have you guys. I have you here with them as well. So, God bless you. Amen. While we're standing, let's look at 1 Corinthians chapter 10. 1 Corinthians chapter 10. And we're going to read one verse here and then we'll have our seats. 1 Corinthians 10 and 12. Wherefore let him that thinkketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. &gt;&gt; And God bless you as you have your seats. What an interesting scripture to start off with. Amen. And and just wait till you see my title. It gets even better. Amen. So if we want to bring up the PowerPoint there, we'll we'll take a look at the title. the danger of peace and prosperity. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll talk about this for a little bit. So, we just read, "Wherefore, let him that thinkketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." So, it's kind of dangerous to think that you're standing. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a dangerous position to be in to think that everything's okay. That's the danger of peace and prosperity. It's a very dangerous place to be. So, I'd like to talk about that just for a little while and take it as a warning from the scriptures. If you could turn with me to Deuteronomy. I want to catch another scripture here. Deuteronomy uh chapter 6. And keep your Bibles handy. We're going to read quite a few uh scripture passages this evening. Deuteronomy chapter 6 and we're going to start at verse 10. Deuteronomy 6 and 10. And it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not, and houses full of all good things which thou filest not, and wells digged, which thou dst not digest not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantest not. Then when thou shalt have eaten and be full, then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. He promised to bring them into the land. He promised to give them the inheritance of the land. He promised to give them the cities that they didn't build. He promised to let them eat the crops that they didn't plant. He promised to give all this to them. But he gave them a warning with it. Beware when you eat till you're full and you're satisfied and you're in houses you didn't build full of good things that you didn't provide for. When you get all of there and you're full and you're satisfied, beware. &gt;&gt; Lest you forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the place that's always been dangerous. And we realize that the children of Israel did exactly that. They got full. They got satisfied. They came into the promise of God and the blessings of God. And he promised to keep them in safety and drive out their enemies and be a shield of protection to them. And he did it. He promised to provide for them the the fruit of the land. He promised, Amen, that that all of their all of their uh uh youth shall lamb and all the she goats shall kid. And they promised that nothing shall cast forth its young and everything shall prosper. And it did. &gt;&gt; But under the prosperity, they forgot God and turned to idol worship to serve other gods. Amen. because it was so good that they forgot God. &gt;&gt; And that's the danger we live in. And we know we live in the Leodysian church age, which which is pleasure seeking, which tries to provide everything. And we live as human beings. Listen, we we we live most of our lives trying to make sure we're safe and secure and prosperous and everything's good. &gt;&gt; But God is so good at turning our basket upside down and shaking it out every once in a while because he knows what's best. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows what we need and he knows the danger of some of those things. Amen. The early church, Amen. They prospered under persecution. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But when things were good and they began to settle down and then under Constantine and the Roman Empire when they got some security and they got some protection and they got some land and they got some buildings and they got some wealth and they got some acceptance and popularity, they forgot God. This is the pattern for humanity and it's something we must be wary of. Amen. When we look here at 2 Samuel 11, we're looking at the story of David, the life of David said, "And it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel and they destroyed the children of Aman and besieged Rabbi. But David terried still at Jerusalem. And it came to pass in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house. From the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. And we know this is David's temptation with Basheba and his fall. But what was the precursor to that is that David got secure in his kingdom and he got secure in his house and he sent forth others to go fight battles and in his safety and security and prosperity he fell. He was better running from cave to cave, being chased by Saul, than he was in the security of his own house. &gt;&gt; He was safer being persecuted, being rejected, fearing for his life. Amen. He was better off then than he was when he got in the prosperity and security of his own house. &gt;&gt; Amen. The way we look at things sometime is the opposite. The way God looks at them. And what we call sa what we call dangerous is safe. And what we call safe sometimes is dangerous. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love preaching things like this because it's absolutely contrary to humanistic ideas. It's it's opposite of what we like to think. It is opposite of our culture. Amen. But I thank God that God doesn't care about our culture. He cares about us. &gt;&gt; And he gave us his word to protect us and keep us safe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David says this about Solomon in 1 Chronicles. He said, "David said to Solomon, "My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God. But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou has shed blood abundantly, and has made great wars. Thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou has shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about, for his name shall be Solomon, which means peace, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days." That sounds wonderful. Does that sound wonderful to you? It was wonderful, but it was the downfall of Solomon &gt;&gt; is what destroyed his life. The fact that he had peace and quietness all the days of his life. So when you read that and that promise is over your life, you think, "Oh, praise God. I'm not going to have any enemies and I'm going to have peace and quiet and all of Israel and everything's going to be fine." Amen. And God brought this word to pass. But for Solomon, Amen, it was his downfall. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn together to First Kings and look at First Kings chapter 10. First Kings 10:14. First Kings 10:14. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 63 score and six talons of gold. I thought that was an interesting number. 666 talons of gold. And that is a a huge amount of money. So a talent is about 75 lbs. 666 talents. 666* 75 pound. Do you know how much gold is worth an ounce? It's over $2,000 somewhere. probably think around $2,200 an ounce. There's 16 ounces in a pound. This is 75 pounds times 666. I'm not that good at math. But that's a lot of money. Every year I think I could handle that budget. I think I think you could too. Amen. Beside that, he had he had of the merchant men and the traffic of the spice merchants and of the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country. And King Solomon made 200 targets of beaten gold. 600 shekels of gold went to one target. And he made 300 shields of beaten gold. Uh three pound of gold went into one shield. And the king put them in the house of the force of Lebanon. Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory overlaid it with the best gold. And the throne had six steps. On the top of the throne was round was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat. And two lions stood beside the stay. And 12 lions stood there on one on the one side and the other upon the six steps. There was not there was not the like made in any kingdom. And all King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold. And all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver. It was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. For the king had at sea a navy of Tarsus with a navy of Hyram. Once in three years came the navy of Tarsus, bringing gold and silver and ivory and apes and peacocks. So, King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. And all the earth sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armor and spices and horses and and mules and a rate year by year. And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had a thousand and 400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at Jerusalem. And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones. And cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance. And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn for the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a a horse for 150. And so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria did they bring them out by their means. So Solomon had, it's easy to say, everything. He was greater than all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. He wasn't just rich. He was the wisest of all. He was the top of the world. He was on top of the world. No one was higher than Solomon on the earth in wisdom and his kingdom in grandeur and in riches. Nobody could beat him out. But let's look at chapter 11 verse one. But King Solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, emmonites, Zedonians, and Hittites of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, "You shall not go in them, neither shall they come in unto you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods." Solomon clave unto these in love. And he had 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concubines. and his wives turned away his heart. For it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father. So in all that all the wealth and all the wisdom and all the might that he had being on top of the world and the greatest man in the world at that time he was still lost his way &gt;&gt; and his heart was turned and he didn't follow after the Lord perfectly as did his father and it was his wives that turned him and he had 700 wives and 300 concubines and he disobeyed the word of the Lord and took wives out of all the nations that he wasn't supposed to take. And I looked at this and I thought for being on top of the world and all the wisdom that you can have and all the riches you can have, he would have been better off being a poor man that could only afford to take care of one wife. &gt;&gt; Solomon would have been far better off without the riches. And he would have been far better off without the wisdom because the wisdom couldn't protect him from failing. &gt;&gt; Amen. It' have been better if he was barely scraping by and he didn't have enough income to support a second wife. he would have been much better off. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take heed to that young men who want to climb the ladder and be successful. You may not want to be successful. You may want to just say, "God, give me whatever you give me, and that's sufficient for me." &gt;&gt; Give me what I can handle, not what I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look, let's turn together to Ecclesiastes. This is the book that that Solomon wrote. And we want to look at a couple excerpts from Ecclesiastes of things that he himself wrote. Chapter 1. Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 12. He says, "And the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven. This sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. I've seen all the works that are done under the sun. And behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. I commune with my own heart, saying, "Lo, I am come to the great estate, and I've gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem. Yay, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceive that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief. And he that increases knowledge increases increases sorrow. &gt;&gt; After all that he learned, he knew more than anybody else. And here's his conclusion. It's all vexation. It's all vanity and vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief. And he that increases knowledge increases sorrow. When he got to the end of it, he found it didn't satisfy. It wasn't what he thought it was going to be. Turn with me to uh Ecclesiastes 2 verse one. Next verse. And I said in my heart, go to now. I will prove thee with mirth. Therefore enjoy pleasure. And behold, this also is vanity. I said, of laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what do what doeth it? I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine. Yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom, and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. And I made me great works. I built in me houses. I planted me vineyards. I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit. And I made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees. I got me servants and maidens, and I had servants born in my house. Also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me. I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of the kings and of the provinces. I got me men's singers and women's singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts. So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them. I withheld not my heart from any joy. For my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my portion of all my labor. Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on all the labor that I had labored to do, and behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit. And there was no profit under the sun. This man tried it all. Anything that his heart desired, he didn't withhold from his heart. Anything his eyes wanted, he gave he gave for himself. He had the means to do it. He had the power to do it. He had he had all power. He had all wisdom, all knowledge. He had uh he had everything. He had money, women, power, prestige, fame, honor. He had everything he wanted and he took everything he desired. And at the end of it, it's all vanity and vexation of spirits. He said there's nothing under the sun. Why? Because he had went to the pinnacle, the highest you can go on earth. And he had tried everything you can try and he enjoyed everything you can enjoy. Amen. But the key phrase to all of Ecclesiastes is under the sun. On the earth, he went as high as he could under the sun. He had all he could on the earth. But he found no satisfaction and pleasure because our satisfaction and pleasure is found beyond this natural world. It's found in the heavenly realms. And he said, "Under the heaven, all is vexation and vanity. Absolutely all we can enjoy and all the pleasures of the world and all that we can esteem to is nothing. What I want is beyond the heavens. Amen. Beyond this earth. &gt;&gt; And he had it all. But his heart was not perfect. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to another scripture in Ezekiel. It's amazing how you start reading this and you start thinking, maybe I don't want to be prosperous. &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't want to run the business. Maybe I don't want to be present. Maybe I I don't want maybe not. It starts to change the way we think about things. Ezekiel 28:11, this is going to be a prophecy concerning Lucifer. Now listen closely. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus sayeth the Lord God, thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. Thou has been in Eden, the garden of God, every precious stone was thy covering, the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the barrel, the onyx, the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of thy tabets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. So he tells him, thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. This is what Lucifer is, full of wisdom. Solomon was also full of wisdom. He was perfect in beauty and he had every ornament and every precious stone and everything to to decorate and honor him. Verse 14. Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth. He had the highest position you can have in heaven outside of God. &gt;&gt; Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth, and I have set thee so. Thoust upon the holy mountain of God. Thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise, they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou has sinned. Therefore, I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God. I will destroy thee, oh covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty. Thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. I will cast thee to the ground. I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee. &gt;&gt; I just say it this way. Lucifer was too perfect. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was too wise and too perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what corrupted him. &gt;&gt; He corrupted. He was corrupted by his beauty and by his brightness. &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't want to be the best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, there's such a there there's such a pressure upon everybody in Leodysia and all humanity to be the best, to be great. There's a pressure upon every young woman to be the most beautiful. Amen. But maybe you don't want to be the most beautiful. Maybe that's a curse. &gt;&gt; There's pressure on men to be the most successful, be the most handsome, the most daring. Maybe you don't want to be the most handsome. Maybe that's a curse. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "A beautiful woman, that can be a curse to her." &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe to be super bright and super intelligent, maybe that's a curse to you. Amen. Maybe to be super successful can be a curse to you if God's not there to put it in check. Maybe all of our striving, if we're striving for vain glory, if we're striving for fa for self, if we're striving for selfishness and pride, and we're trying to gain more. Amen. Those very things that we're striving to achieve can be the very downfall and destruction of us. We're chasing after money, prosperity, fame. We're chasing after success because it's good to be successful and feels good to be successful. I would rather be an utter failure in this world and succeed in the heavenly realm. Amen. Than succeed here and my heart be turned from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people have chased a career and gave up on things of God and begin to compromise because they're chasing after money, chasing after popularity, chasing after whatever they're chasing after. &gt;&gt; I say, God, help me to chase after what matters most. Help me to chase after you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Me says this about Lucifer. He said, "You notice Lucifer is exactly doing the same thing today that he did at the beginning. Lucifer at the beginning wanted to build himself a kingdom which was greater and more beautiful than Michael's kingdom, Christ." He that was his ambition to achieve something like that. So if he thought he could build a greater, more beautiful kingdom than Michael's, than Christ, then the question is, what did Michael's kingdom look like? He thought he could top it. He said, Lucifer at the beginning, his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had. Is that right? By seemingly a more cultured, more beautiful, more splendor than the kingdom of Christ. This is amazing to me because Lucifer was sure that he could have more splendor. He could have more culture. He could do better job than what Christ could do than the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of Michael. So that means what kind of kingdom did Michael or Christ have? Amen. Well, I think if we look at how Christ came, we can start to see what kind of kingdom he had because he he came lowly. He came to a poor family. He was born in poverty. Amen. He didn't choose the rich. He didn't choose the palace. But he was born in a stable and laid in a manger and wrapped in a and a yolk of a cloth off a yolk of oxen and is swaddled in that and laid. He came in the lowest form that he could come in. He come in absolute humility. Though he was king of all the earth, he came in the lowest form he could come. And then the body he chose cuz remember the genetics weren't chose by any earthly parents. He chose God chose his own genetics. Amen. He wrote it in for the stature. And he said there was no former beauty that we should desire him. He didn't come handsome. He didn't come broad shouldered. He didn't come with a fair complexion. He didn't come beautiful. &gt;&gt; He came lowly and meek riding on an ass. That's how he came into Jerusalem as king. &gt;&gt; So what kind of kingdom did he have in heaven? I'd say he had a humble kingdom. One, he didn't go to the top of what he could possibly do. He moved himself down lower. Amen. God never operated at the highest level. God has always condescended him down in humility. &gt;&gt; But Lucifer can't do that. Amen. He's got to go as high as he possibly can and try to exceed. And he thought he could because obviously Christ wasn't going to his max. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We understand. &gt;&gt; Look at what else Solomon wrote in Proverbs. Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. &gt;&gt; Feed me with food convenient for me, lest I be full and deny thee and say, "Who is the Lord?" Or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of my God in vain. &gt;&gt; What was the wisdom that Solomon came to? Don't make me rich or poor. &gt;&gt; Just put me in the middle. &gt;&gt; Let me be average. [Applause] Let me be average because if I'm if I'm full, I may forget the Lord and say, "Who is the Lord?" Because I'm satisfied. Amen. That's what happened to the rich young ruler who came to Jesus. Amen. And he turned his back on Jesus cuz he couldn't give up his riches for eternal life. But later we find him with his barns full with the plentiful harvest. And he said, "So, take thy ease. Eat and drink and be merry for you've got everything that you want." And Jesus said, "Thou fool, thou dost not know that tonight thy soul is required of thee." He had everything he wanted on earth, but but that was under the sun. &gt;&gt; But he had nothing because he found himself in hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "God, what's wrong with average?" &gt;&gt; What's wrong with slightly below average? &gt;&gt; How did Jesus look? Did he look above average, below average? Like like the median of all humanity? I say he was average. What was the prophet of our age like? I'd say he was average. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we're going to find that's a safer place to be. Solomon was wise. He had experienced it. Brother Beam says, "But when you become a real Christian, every moment you're wondering, am I pleasing my Lord? if I could hear from him. It puts you on tension, puts you on guard. That's what makes you what you are. So after all, tension is a blessing. It's just the way you're looking at it. It's just the way you're looking at it. If you just took the other side, no matter how thin you slice anything, you still got two sides to it. You see? So you want to see both sides. So tension. I think, "Oh my, what's this tension? If I could have been born without this tension." Well, if I wouldn't have had this tension, I wouldn't have been what I am. I wouldn't have been a Christian. Perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ. It's been a blessing thing to me. &gt;&gt; Here, the prophet is dealing with a nervousness that he's had all of his life. A nervous tension. It's caused him to have to leave the field. It's caused him to have a sour stomach for years on end. It's caused him all kinds of heartache and grief and getting depressed and all of these things that he's had to deal with. So he starts dealing with this tension and he's coming into another bout of it here in 19 end of 1963 and he starts to think about the tension and he starts to take what is ne what we would call negative hurtful harmful to him and he says it's a blessing to me. &gt;&gt; It's the thing that drove me to Christ because it's not good to have everything good. &gt;&gt; It's not good to have everything perfect. It's not good for everything to be right. It's not good for us to have everything we want at our beck and call and at our fingertips. That's not good for us. What's good for us is to have a dependency on almighty God and not have a dependency on oursel and not be self-sufficient and self-dependent, but to have something in our life that keeps us connected to God and dependent upon God. &gt;&gt; So God in his great mercy allowed this condition in the prophet. He could have removed it. And brother Benham prayed many times for it to be removed. And God eventually promised he'd remove it. When did he remove it? He removed it a month before he died. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the tension served a purpose in his life. And that purpose was met. And when he was done with the prophet and done with his work on earth, he said, "Okay, you're healed now. Now let's go home." &gt;&gt; That tension, that nervousness, that that suffer. And listen, did he really suffer with it? He suffered immeasurably, friends. Probably more than we could ever realize that he suffered with this issue. And it was a medical condition. It was a nervous condition. It was a mental condition all rolled into one. &gt;&gt; And nobody wants to suffer like that. &gt;&gt; But he said it was a blessing thing to me. &gt;&gt; Then he starts talking about all Christians. All Christians who want to serve the Lord. He said they come under tension. He said, "People sell Christianity like it's just an easy thing and you come to God and there's no more worries." He said, "That's when worries begin because now you want to please the Lord." &gt;&gt; And you get under tension wanting to please the Lord, wanting to know his will and you think, "If I so want to know the will of God, he'll just tell me." &gt;&gt; And you seek God and you seek God and he doesn't tell you. &gt;&gt; How's everybody ever been to a place where you've got to make a decision and you want God to tell you what to do and he won't tell you nothing? And you think God in a fraction of a moment you could answer this question. Why won't you tell me what I'm supposed to do? Hey, listen. Because if he told you what to do every time you come to a decision, you would never agonize in prayer. You would never labor in prayer. He would just tell you what to do and you'd walk on. You wouldn't have faith. You wouldn't be dependent. You wouldn't be on your knees. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I promise you, you pray better when you're in trouble than when everything's going fine. &gt;&gt; I promise you that. Amen. That's the way it is for me. I have My prayer life is so good when I'm in the midst of a tragedy. &gt;&gt; That's when it's the best. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, &gt;&gt; I'm not proud of that. &gt;&gt; But that's human nature. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of it. I'm ashamed that that the best times of prayer, the times that I spend more time in prayer and I'm more earnest in prayer and more sincere in prayer is in times of trouble. I'm ashamed of that. But that's the truth. And I realize God brought times of trouble to keep me close to him because I have a tendency like a sheep when everything's fine to wander away. &gt;&gt; But the grace of God will allow a wolf to come along every once in a while. So I run right back to the shepherd and stay close to him. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Brother Beam says, "I was just talking to a young minister and his wife in this room just a few moments ago, and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world. The rest of of human beings on earth." I said, "Remember, Satan's got a punch coming at you. Don't care who you are. He's got a right for that one punch. Which had you rather it be that punch? Be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous? He's got somewhere he can punch you. He's got a right to that open place. Now, that's the spot you've got to keep covered all the time. &gt;&gt; I love this quote because it gives us such insight. That means we all have at least one area of weakness in us. &gt;&gt; And that one area of weakness is the area that Satan is always going to come and he's always going to access us. He's always going to get to us in that area. Amen. And brother M said, "That's the area we got to keep covered all the time." And you think, "God, why don't you just take that away from me?" &gt;&gt; But what would you be if he took it away? &gt;&gt; If you didn't need him &gt;&gt; all the time for this area of weakness, what would happen to us as human beings and fallen flesh in a fallen condition? Listen, God in his great mercy has left weaknesses inside of us. He's left issues with us to deal with. He loves things that we have need because that's one of the best things that can ever happen to us is that we have whatever you label it. Brother Benham says he Satan's got a punch coming at you. Which one would you rather it be? &gt;&gt; I'm not picking. &gt;&gt; Like give me a list of would you rather be arthritic? Would you rather be blind? Would you rather be in a wheelchair? Would you rather have nervous t? Listen, I'm not picking. I'm like David. When David was given a choice of which way he was going to be punished, he said, "I'll fall in the hands of God, not the hands of man." And I said, "God, whatever you know what's best, I can't pick anything off that list cuz I want none of them. &gt;&gt; I don't want any of them." But you get it without asking. &gt;&gt; Because God loves us. &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 12, this is the Apostle Paul. He says, "Un lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me." Oh, friends, what a what a quote. What a scripture, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, and reproaches, and necessities, and persecutions, and distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. &gt;&gt; Lest I should be exalted above measure. &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Lucifer. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he exalted himself because of his brightness, because of his beauty. And Paul, because God was going to pour out the full revelation of Jesus Christ to him. Amen. Unless he should get exalted above measure, there was given to him a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest I should be exalted above measure. Amen. &gt;&gt; It looks to me like God knew Paul's weakness because when he was Saul, he sought popularity and fame amongst the religious leaders and he sought a position and acceptance from them. And so God in his goodness when he was going to pour upon him in the desert of Arabia, pour out the revelation of himself. Amen. With that great revelation and that position as the apostle of the age, amen, was going to come an affliction in the flesh. And the affliction in the flesh was a guard rail for the Apostle Paul &gt;&gt; to keep him from going off the cliff. &gt;&gt; And he asked God three times to remove it. But God refused to remove it. Do &gt;&gt; you understand that Paul's coming to God? Because obviously whatever this is is not pleasant and he doesn't like it and he doesn't want it. That's why he comes three times to the Lord. And in three times he asks God to take this away and in the third time God says my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness. God's strength is not made perfect in your strength. God's strength is made perfect in your weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul realized then that God had done this for my protection. God had done this for his glory. God has allowed this. And so then he begins to glory in his infirmities. He begins to rejoice and take pleasure in all of these things. For when he is weak, then is he strong. So God knew Paul needed this to keep Paul from going off the rails. &gt;&gt; He needed a guard rail. And the question I want to ask you is, do we need a guardrail? &gt;&gt; And what is the guardrail God put in our life? And what is our attitude towards our guard rail? It's something to think about. Friends, some of us, we have things in our life. It could be a health issue. It could be an affliction. It could be a family situation. It could be we're dealing with we're we're dealing with singleness. We're dealing with we're dealing with pain or affliction. We're dealing with uh poverty. We're dealing with whatever we're dealing with. Amen. But it God may have put that thing there as a guard rail. &gt;&gt; I was talking to a brother one time and he was talking about a brother who wanted to preach the gospel, but the brother wasn't qualified to preach the gospel. He didn't meet the scriptural qualifications and he didn't meet what the prophet had told us for this age. So, he wasn't qualified to be a minister, but yet he had a gift that operated in his life and he could break the word. And so, he thought that he he thought God was calling him to preach and he thought he would be a good preacher, but he didn't meet the scriptural qualifications. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the brother told me, and it was amazing when he said it. He said he didn't realize that God put that as a guardrail for him. He didn't use the word guardrail, but I'm using it to keep him from destroying himself and destroying other people's lives because he's got a gift. He's got an ability. He's able to do it. But if he was called to do it, he would meet the qualifications. God would have watched over him and watched over his wife and protected him so that he could marry a virgin so that he would meet the qualifications for a minister. &gt;&gt; And so he saw the guard rail as a limitation &gt;&gt; instead of safety. Right. &gt;&gt; Paul saw the guard rail, not as limitation. He saw it as safety. Brother Brandham saw the guard rail. He didn't see it now as limitation. He saw it as safety that God was doing something for him because it's this tension that drove me to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes whatever we got limited in our life or whatever affliction we have or whatever it is, it may be the guard rail, amen, to keep us, amen, from going over the rails. Amen. Sometimes whatever our limitation is, we suffer with it so much in our minds, not realizing God is perfect in every way and he does everything good. And some people struggle because now they're trapped in singleness because of a qualification in their life. Amen. But listen, if if God wanted you to be married, you'd be married. Singleness is a guardrail to protect you from going off the end. You don't know what you would do if you were married. &gt;&gt; You may not serve God anymore. You don't know what you would do if you had a strong body. You may not serve God anymore. &gt;&gt; You don't know what you would do if this barrier was removed. If God allows it to stay, say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm still believing." If it's healing, believe for healing, but thank God. Amen. For everything he's done to drive you to him. &gt;&gt; Everything he's done to keep you within the boundaries that he wants you and to keep you dependent on him, looking to him, serving him with all of your heart. Yes, &gt;&gt; we think everything would be better if everything was better. &gt;&gt; But sometimes if everything gets better then spiritually it gets worse. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the worst thing that can happen to a man is he has a successful business. &gt;&gt; Sometime the worst thing that can happen to the girl is that she gets the guy she's been after. Sometimes it's the worst thing that ever happened to her. She got the guy she was after. the one who was most popular, the one everybody wanted, and she got him and now she lives with it for 40, 50 years. Sometimes the no is the best thing that's ever happened to us. And when it doesn't work out, we're heartbroken. We're distraught. Absolutely, of course. But there's a danger in peace and prosperity. Amen. Look at this scripture. For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. And the base things of the world, and the things which are despised, hath God chosen, yay, and things which are not, to bring to not things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence. &gt;&gt; God's not using strength. God's using weakness. God's not using mighty things. He's using weak things. &gt;&gt; So if you're a weak thing, praise God. &gt;&gt; He can use you. Amen. Amen. I want to uh take a look at this this quote. There's a couple in the message. Desperations I want to read. It's a desperation. When the wife was about to die with cancer, he knowed that God could heal her. And if God could heal the wife, God can heal the boy. And it throws it into a state of desperation. and see you must come. And when you're desperate, then God is going to listen to you. But if you're just slothful, you don't care whether he does or not. Well, then that's different. You say you do, but it takes desperation to do it. &gt;&gt; Brother's got several quotes along this line on desperation. And he says, he says, "When you're desperate, then God is going to listen to you." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; Okay. Do you realize you can't fake desperation? &gt;&gt; If you're desperate, God's going to hear you. How are you going to fake desperation? &gt;&gt; Amen. You may you may stand up in a crowd and let your voice quiver when you're praying. But but God knows your heart whether you're desperate or not. And what creates desperation? It's the situations we find ourselves in that create desperation. It's a great need for God. It's when only God will work. It's when nothing else will work but God. And I got to have God now. And I got to have his word manifest in my life. And it takes desperation. And how do we get to desperation and peace and prosperity? &gt;&gt; No. There's many things that happen to our life. Amen. Because it brings us into states of desperation. Uh I want to read this quote from taking sides with Jesus. He said, "Just imagine what if God would place on you that you know the heart of the people that he was talking to. Think about that, brethren. Maybe I know you have burdens, but you don't understand. And besides that, here you got the responsibility here. You say, "Well, that ought to be easy for you, brother Benham. Anything to do, God just tell you?" No, he doesn't. I sweat it out just like you do and a whole lot harder. I have to sweat much harder than you do. You think with a prophetic gift, God would just told him what to do. But God didn't just tell him what to do. He made him sweat it out and labor and be desperate in prayer for direction from God. And why with a prophetic gift, why wouldn't God just tell him? Because God can't just tell him because then everything becomes too easy. &gt;&gt; But he himself has to labor. He himself has to have faith. He himself has to depend on God. &gt;&gt; He said in the message, the everpresent water from the rock. I have things now that I have to solve out myself and decisions I have to make. And this is such a vital one till I cannot exactly make it until I'm sure that it's him speaking to me. and he won't give me a vision. He just let me alone. So, I'm just sitting like as an orphan like this morning and I don't know which way to turn. You say, "Why would God do that?" Because it was necessary. Because it was the best thing for the prophet to have to sweat it out and not get an easy answer and to be desperate and have to wait on the Lord. &gt;&gt; God told him, "Well, if I push you in a pipe and pull you out the other side every time, doing everything for you, making decisions, where's your reward? Where did you exercise your faith? Where did you overcome? &gt;&gt; But yet, there had to be an overcoming. There had to be a faith that was expressed. So God didn't just put him in a tube every time and pull him out the other side. And he doesn't for us either. He lets us labor and he lets us pray and he lets us strive and he lets us sweat it out. &gt;&gt; And how many like sweating it out? &gt;&gt; It's horrible. How many likes being stuck and knowing you got to make a decision, not knowing what the will of God is, and praying desperately for God to show you because all you want to do is his will, but yet he doesn't tell you anything. Those are horrible times, friends, but it's the best thing that could ever happen to us to drive us to his feet &gt;&gt; and to keep us there. And desperations again, he says, "We know it's true that God will meet a desperate soul." Now we all know that but it's usually takes something to drive us into that to that despair to the desperation. It takes something to do it. We find out in James 5:15 that the Bible said that the effectual fervent that's desperation effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. He goes on to say and there may be men and women sitting here tonight that's death lays right before you. And the only way that you'll ever be able to achieve the thing that you're wanting is to desperately come. I must have it tonight. I I I get it now or I'm finished. Tomorrow's too late. I must have it now. When you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token. Don't say, "Well, now I'll go up and try. Lord, I'm a little tired." Oh, mercy, stay in your seat. Don't even make an attempt. If you come say, "I'll pass through the prayer line, put the oil on my head. I'll see if it does me any good." Might as well set where you're at &gt;&gt; until you get to that place. Until the whole church gets to a place that is between death and life, you've got to have it now or perish. Then God will move on the scene. It takes desperation to bring God on the scene. Jacob cried like never before. Desperately he called until he got a hold of God. And when he did, he wrestled not for 15 minutes. He wrestled to keep him in his soul all night long. And still he knew he didn't have the blessing. And he was able to hold on until the blessing come. He wrestled desperately until the blessing come. It takes desperation to bring God on the scene. So, how are you going to be desperate? &gt;&gt; We're going to have to recognize our need. &gt;&gt; We're going to have to recognize how much we need him. We're going to have to come in contact with our weakness and our desperate need for him. Amen. And that's what brings him on the scene. How is that going to happen when everything's fine &gt;&gt; and I'm strong and I'm beautiful and I'm wise and I've got all the answers and I've got all of life figured out. Amen. It's not going to happen then. It's going to happen when I don't have it figured out. When I don't know what the answer is. When I come up against a crisis and I don't know how to get out of it and I need God and I need him now. That's desperation. &gt;&gt; Those times that we think are the worst times in our life, we look back now and they're the best times of our life. There are the times God drew us near to himself. God proved his word in our life. God showed himself mighty on our behalf. But it took getting into a condition to bring that about. It wasn't when everything was easy and when life was happy and when there was no problem. It was that problem that drove us into the situation. It's like the troubles were like cattle gates. Amen. Narrowing down and pushing us right to the feet of God and say, "God, I need you. I need you now. And I need your word like I've never needed before." And when we got to that condition, God comes on the scene and those things that we hated becomes the testimony we tell everybody when we get together and have fellowship. &gt;&gt; It was from the worst to the best. So it's better sometimes for us when it's rough, when it's hard, when it's not perfect, when we're in weakness. We want to be on the top all the time, but it didn't work for Lucifer and it didn't work for Solomon. God didn't allow Paul to go there or brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And I don't think God's going to let his bride go there. He's going to take her to the top, absolutely, but he's going to keep her dependent on him and he's going to do what we need. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. At the end of it all, I'm so thankful he doesn't give me everything I want. &gt;&gt; But he gives me exactly what I need. &gt;&gt; And I believe he does all things well. &gt;&gt; If he's put a barrier in my life, then thank God. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; If there's a guardrail that keeps me from going somewhere I want or something I want to do and God says, "No, it's not according to the word." And the word is becomes the barrier, I say, "Thank God. There's some reason you're protecting me from something. &gt;&gt; Not limiting me. Not not being a bad dad and not giving me. Listen, God's promised to give good things to those who ask. &gt;&gt; He's promised to be a loving father. And he said if if earthly men will give good gifts, how much more will God give the Holy Ghost to them that act? He gives good gifts. &gt;&gt; But he gives the right gift at the right time for the right reason. in spiritual amnesia. He says, like Buddy Robinson has said one time in a cornfield, he said, 'Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, when you come back, you'll find a pile of bones laying right here. He was dead earnest, and you're not going to get anything from God till you get desperate about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen, I I have never experienced desperation when everything's going perfect. &gt;&gt; I just want to reiterate that. when everything was perfect and and everything was bright, shiny and everything was great and and everything was wonderful in my life. I don't remember ever experiencing desperation, but I do remember experiencing desperation in my life and I remember God coming on the scene for me. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for those times. &gt;&gt; So, I'm rooting for slightly below average. I'm not talking spiritually is my connection with God, but on this earth, God, don't let me stray away. Don't let me take any path that takes me from you. Don't let me, Lord, Amen, move into something or do something or accept something that will draw me away. This is a a quote I know and I I heard Blake quote this when he was reading the prayer request. I was just smiling in the back because it's the one I wanted to read tonight. said, 'Wh does God let troubles come? God harnesses trouble, puts bits in its mouth, and makes it obey him. And those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; How many have prayed for a closer walk with God? &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. How does he do it? Through troubles. &gt;&gt; He harnesses trouble. bits in its mouth, makes it obey him. And those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; There had been no rainbow until the flood came. But after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little ark pitching up and down in the water, it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for the first time. The covenant of hope, the covenant of promise. After he'd went through the tribulation, then he saw the promise. That's the way you see the promise. after you've gone through the tribulation. I've liked that poem or psalm. Must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease? While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas, we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations. That's better than comfort and peace. Our comforts is just beyond the river. Everything Solomon could achieve in all of his wisdom and all of his money and all of his might, it under the sun, it was vanity and vexation of soul. So let's stop worrying about under the sun and let's look at what's beyond the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's live for that. Amen. I want to look at uh I want to look at this uh Ecclesiastes 7. If you could turn there with me back to Ecclesiastes, back to the book that Solomon wrote, Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse do. In Ecclesiastes 7:2, it says, "It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting. For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than laughter. For by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better." The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. This is another one of those bits of wisdom that are a little opposite than what we think. Amen. It's better to be in the house of mourning than to be in the house of feasting. But we all want to go to the house of feasting. And nobody wants to go to the house of mourning. But it's in the house of mourning where sorrow, this is what he says, sorrow is better than laughter. For by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better. God is working on our heart and perfecting us through all the things that we struggle with and all the trials that come our way and all are the hardships. And we ask ourselves all the time, why is there always trouble? Why is it always one thing after another? It seems like we get out of one thing and we step right into another one. And I don't know that I don't think I'm the only one like that, but I think maybe some of you are in the same situation. It's like we come right out of one trial and it's like we're going right into another one. And it used to be I used to think I got a reprieve, but it seems like they're stacked one on top the other anymore. &gt;&gt; But thank God for that, friends. I thank God because God's not going to let me. Listen, if Paul had an abundance of revelation, what has God dished out to his bride in this end time? He has opened himself and unveiled himself and revealed to us who we are. He's gave us a security, amen, in his word that's beyond anything any other generation had. We know who we are. We know who we came from. We know where we're going. Amen. And unless we could get exalted above measure, God has allowed thorns and pricks and things, amen, to be guard rails in our life to keep us from getting exalted because everything would be so perfect &gt;&gt; if God would just give us, Amen, that perfect faith that we could speak everything in existence and we could speak traffic lights to go green and speak the traffic out of the way and the money in the bank. But God's not going to do that because we're still in a sticky cocoa nature. Amen. and we would get exalted above measure. But God's going to pour out an abundance of revelation. But with it, he's going to give something to keep us needing him, desperate for him in desperation, crying out to him so that we don't go the way of Solomon. &gt;&gt; Cuz everything was too good for Solomon. And I'm not going to I don't think God's going to let us go that way. &gt;&gt; God wouldn't let his prophet of the first age, he wouldn't let his prophet in the end time. Why would he let you and I go that way? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have we somehow come to a characteristics that are far better than Paul? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, if Paul was like me, he wouldn't need that. You understand what kind of pride that is to think that we've somehow we've got to a level where we don't need that anymore? &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God for the guard rails. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the times in my life where I'll kneel down and say, "God, I don't have the answers and I don't know where to go, but I know you have the answers. &gt;&gt; And I know you are the answer, and I'm trusting in you, and I can't go anywhere else but here. This is the only place that I can find my answer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful. Remember the story brother Benham told of the shepherd with his little sheep and he took that sheep and he broke its leg. And somebody asked him, "Why did you break that sheep leg? Are you mad at it?" And he said, "No, but this sheep had a problem wandering off, and I'm afraid it's going to get caught by the wolves and destroyed. So, I broke its leg so that I could show it a little special love and a little special care and take care of it and mend it and heal it so it'll learn to stay close to me." Oh, friends, maybe you've got something like a broken leg. Or maybe it's a broken spirit. Maybe it's your nerves on edge. Maybe it's some affliction in your life. Maybe some need that's constantly there. But oh, thank God. If it causes me to stay close to him and get a little extra love from him and never wander away from the shepherd, then it's the best thing that could have ever happened to me. &gt;&gt; It's not horrible. It's wonderful. Amen. It's not that I like it. Amen. But I like him and I like staying close to him. And what is the alternative? &gt;&gt; See, this is the question we never ask. We always ask, why is this happening to me? Has anybody ever asked that question? Why is this happening to me? Well, are you exclusive somehow? Bad things shouldn't happen to you. Are you saying it should have happened to somebody else in the church, not you? Why is this happening to me? And the question should we ask, why is God allowed this? What good is he going to do in this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or why do I find myself in this position? And we have to come to the realization that God is perfect &gt;&gt; and he's never made a mistake yet. &gt;&gt; And if God allowed so many times we look back over our life and say, "Why God didn't you stop me from making that decision?" Because now I'm bound by that. I'm stuck because of what I decided. You know, God has interrupted people's decision before. God has changed circumstances. God has changed history &gt;&gt; to bring about his word. And if God allowed it and you're in this condition now because of a decision that was made years ago, you say, "Why God did you allow it?" Listen, where would we be without it? Is a better question. &gt;&gt; That's what we don't know. We have no idea. So, we just assume it's bad and it's negative and it's all bad and it's all negative and it may be the very guard rail God put in our life to keep us from going over the edge of the cliff &gt;&gt; and destroying our life. Maybe if we got the guy or got the girl or got the job or got the whatever promotion, maybe we would have destroyed ourselves. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's the grace of God that we didn't get the things we were after. &gt;&gt; Maybe the position we're in is the very best place we could ever be. &gt;&gt; I remember brother Abraham Myra told me a story one time. He said there was a man in his village and the man was lame and he had been afflicted all of his life and he sat with his legs crossed and his feet turned up facing his face and he couldn't walk. And he said the man came to the church and he wanted prayer and he was coming to church and he prayed for him and God straightened his legs so that he could walk, he could ride a bicycle, he could move around. Amen. And then he come to the church for a while and then after a few years he faded away from the church and brother Abraham said he became the worst womanizer in the whole village. Now he's stuck in fornication and adultery and everybody's and everybody's mad at brother Abraham for praying for him because he becomes such a vile person. It would have been better for him to stay a and come to the church and raise his hands and praise God crippled so he wouldn't become a womanizer. &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't need what we think we need. &gt;&gt; Maybe God has given us exactly what we need &gt;&gt; for our protection. I think we have to as children of God change the way we think about our life and change the way we think about our circumstances and change the way we think about God. &gt;&gt; Because God's not making a mistake. &gt;&gt; He never has. If you look at the Leodysian church age out of the church age book or out of the revelation chapter 3, he says,"I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would thou cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing." This is a church that thought it was fine. Had everything it needed. It had money, had prestige. It was increased rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing. And God says, "And knowest thou not thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." &gt;&gt; This is what happened when it came to peace and prosperity. This church had got where it was respected. This church had got where everything had ease. It had riches, had lands, had property, had everything it needed. And the church now, the woman of the church is saying, "I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing." That was the worst condition that church could be in. &gt;&gt; Be so much better to say, "God, I need you. I don't have anything figured out. I don't have any way to make it happen. I don't know how to do what I need to do next. God, I'm completely dependent on you." That would have been a much better condition to be in. &gt;&gt; But naturally they were rich and increased with goods and had needed nothing. But spiritually they were wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. I would rather naturally have nothing to spiritually be clothed &gt;&gt; and have eyesight and have riches of God. &gt;&gt; Not under the earth but over the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. In the thotiron church age, he said each age had its pressures. &gt;&gt; For example, a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches, soft living and nervous tension in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in. So every age had its challenges. It had its pressures. So what are the challenges of the last age? riches and soft living. &gt;&gt; That's not good for us. &gt;&gt; It's not good for us. Say, God, help us. I'm going look at this quote here. Many times we are led to that spot. Why is it if I go to church and I live before God with all my heart, I try to be just, honest person, and all that Christianity requires. Why is it that these things happen? But you know, many times they are blessings in disguisement. Many times we can't understand them. If you'll just let them alone, God will work it out just right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; This is a familiar scripture. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Question is, is that statement true? &gt;&gt; Is it completely true? &gt;&gt; Is it always true? &gt;&gt; So when it says all things, &gt;&gt; what does that mean? &gt;&gt; All you guys always pass the test with flying colors. Does that even mean the bad things? &gt;&gt; Are bad things included in all things? &gt;&gt; All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. Do you believe you're part of the called? &gt;&gt; That means all things work together for good. You said, "But my unsaved loved one," that unsaved loved one is keeping you in desperation. &gt;&gt; It's keeping you close to God. God is keeping you on your knees and you're interceding on behalf of them. You don't know what God's accomplishing by that. But we know all things work together. But you don't know my affliction, but you don't know the strain and distress. You don't know uh what's going on in my body. Listen, I don't know. Amen. I don't know what you're going through. You don't know all that I'm going through. But one thing I know is all things work together for good. And God does everything well. He does it perfect. And everything I need, he's given to me. And I'm thankful for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to turn in our Bibles and I want read this last scripture. Let's turn to First Thessalonians together and we'll read this as we close here. 1 Thessalonians 5 and 18. 1 Thessalonians 5:18. In everything give thanks &gt;&gt; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Okay. What is everything? &gt;&gt; Is it everything? &gt;&gt; Is that kind of like the all in Romans 8? &gt;&gt; Everything and all. So what am I supposed to give thanks for? In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. What has happened to you that hasn't crossed God's desk? &gt;&gt; That's right. What has come into your life that that God wasn't aware of? What's happened to you that took God by surprise? &gt;&gt; What was it that was outside of his power or outside of his knowledge? What couldn't he have prevented? Listen, he looks at Peter one day and said, "Peter, Satan has desired to sift thee like wheat." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I've told you this before, but to me it's easy. I said, "Well, you told him no, right? If I was Peter, that would have been like, yeah, okay, you told him he couldn't." But Jesus never said he couldn't. And he said, "Peter has asked, he's desired to sift you like wheat. But I have prayed for you that your faith fail not." Apparently, Peter needed to be sifted cuz if Peter didn't need to be sifted, he wouldn't be sifted. So, the sifting was good for Peter. &gt;&gt; And Peter failed God in the sifting. And he denied the Lord three times. But God already knew he would do it and prophesied to him that he would. If God had fornowledge of his fall, why didn't God stop his fall? Because apparently that would do something to Peter that would further the kingdom's work. &gt;&gt; God would use that failure in Peter because now Peter come back humble and repentant. And Peter was full of pride, self assured. Amen. He was so confident in himself. And he was lifted up in pride and God would let him be sifted as wheat and fall flat on his face. And he didn't say, "I pray that you wouldn't be sifted. I pray that your faith would fail, not through your sifting." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is it that you're going through that you say, God? I mean, we go to God. God, do you know what's happening to me? What a foolish thing to say. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Or, God, don't you see me? &gt;&gt; Another foolish thing to say. But it's exactly how we feel. We feel abandoned. We feel left alone. We feel like surely God would not permit this to happen to me. And the reality is the prophet of God told us there's nothing that happens in the life of a believer that doesn't first cross God's desk. &gt;&gt; He couldn't touch Jonah. Amen. Without God's permission. He can't touch you without God's permission. He couldn't sift Peter without asking. &gt;&gt; And God a for Job. For God for Job. Amen. He put limitations on what the devil could do. You can do this, but you can't do that. And then later he would ask again, but you've got a hedge. He said, "But you can do this, but you can't do that." Amen. God knew exactly what was happening to Job. Job was confused. He had no understanding. He didn't know why. But God knew why because God was trying to answer his question and he was trying to accomplish his purpose. &gt;&gt; And that became a tremendous thing in Job's life and a tremendous thing for us. And it was a tremendous thing for Peter. &gt;&gt; And I look back over all my strains and stresses and troubles and cries to the Lord. And there's times that I literally prayed all night long because I had no answer and I was in the midst of a horrible trial and I didn't know what to do and I prayed all night long. Listen, I never prayed all night long in my prosperity. &gt;&gt; I never got so close to God, so dependent on God, I never clutched his ankles and wrapped my arms around him and said, "I won't let you go." like I did when I got that desperate. &gt;&gt; And I look back on that time in my life and God answered my prayer and he brought me through and he did a work in my life and I'm thankful for that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. &gt;&gt; God is good and he does good and he does what's right. And even the thing that doesn't feel good is good. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham's nervous tension didn't feel good. His sour stomach didn't feel good. is getting the blues didn't feel good, &gt;&gt; but it was important. &gt;&gt; Paul's thorn in the flesh didn't feel good. Whatever we go through certainly doesn't feel good, and we don't call it good, but it works together for good. &gt;&gt; And if it works together for good, then in everything we can give thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord. You know what I need and you know what's best." That doesn't mean we still don't believe for deliverance. We believe for deliverance. We believe for healing. We believe for miracles. We believe for God to perform his word. But in the process, if God allowed it to come, then something good's going to come from it. And I'm excited to see what God will do &gt;&gt; through it all. Amen. All things work together for the good. And in everything give thanks &gt;&gt; for this is the will of God concerning thee. I got a feeling if we could just change our attitude towards trials, it would change so much in our life. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Musicians, if you'd please come. Brother Blake, if you'd please come. We need troubles. &gt;&gt; We need them. We need trials. We need them. Our faith has to be tested. Our faith has to overcome. We have to be proved. All of those things have to happen. We need them. But if I could thank God for everything in my life and changed my attitude, I've told you this before, but in me, this is just me personal. Chad, the greatest torment of every trial in my life is the mental battle that I go through trying to fight the trial and wondering why and what I did wrong and where's God in this and what and really the greatest most horrible time is the battle that rages in my mind every time I hit a trial. But when I just can click over and say, "Praise be to God, he'll see me through and all of this work together for good." Amen. It's amazing how different a trial can be when our mindset towards the trial changes. &gt;&gt; And when we say, "So be it." That's what happened to Paul. Paul didn't want the thorn in his flesh. God, take this away. God, take this away. God, take this away. But when God told him that there was a purpose in in his life, his mindset towards it changed. And when his mindset towards it changed, everything changed. &gt;&gt; And he began to glory in his affirmities. I say, "God, let my mind be changed." Now, in a trial, if I could just say, "God, thank you for the opportunity to get closer to you right now." Just something simple like that. Thank you, God, that you've drawn me closer in prayer through this trial. Thank you, God, that I'm going to see your delivering hand. I'm going to see you perform your word. Thank you, God, for this opportunity. Thank you for what you're doing in my life. And thank you for what this is going to accomplish. And I think if we can mean it from the bottom of our hearts and let our mindset change towards our trial, I think we'll find out that trials change. They change. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it goes from being the worst thing that ever happened to you to a necessary part of the Christian journey, then it changes everything in our lives. It isn't where are you God? What's happening? Where am I? Do you know who I am? Am I even a child of God? put all of that to rest because that that's all despair, but put it all away and say, "God, whatever you're accomplishing in me, accomplish it, Lord. I yield myself to you &gt;&gt; and it changes everything." Amen. Let's just bow our heads together and pray. Dear heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, that you've given us such wisdom in this generation, in this time that we're on the earth. You sent a prophetic voice to show us in the scriptures that you are perfect in every way. We can look back through the Bible and we can take every character and we can go through their life and the trials and the tribulations and we can see that they were all perfect. They were all necessary and they all produced something good. And God, if that's true for them, it can be true for us. And Lord, I thank you, God, that you are so good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you won't let us fall away. You won't let us, Lord, just move away with pride and arrogancy and prosperity. But God, that you're constantly bringing us back closer to you. And God, I thank you for it, Lord. I pray you bless us as a people as we move forward, God. May we have the right mindset towards everything we face in life. May we think the way you've taught us to think. May we see with prophetic vision. May we see with eagle vision being lifted higher than the trial and being able to put it in perspective of your word. May we be able to walk forward with confidence that in everything all things are working together for good. And God, I want to say thank you. I thank you, God, for loving me. &gt;&gt; I thank you, God, for correcting me. I thank you for chasing me. I thank you for putting guard rails up in my life. I thank you for stopping me in my tracks and drawing me back to yourself in desperate prayer. I thank you for not letting my prosperity take me away and my peace to take me away, but you're constantly bringing me back to yourself. And I want to say thank you, Lord. You are so good and you do all things well. And I also want to say, Lord, that I trust you. I trust your judgment. I trust your hand. I trust your guidance. And Lord, I trust you with my life. For you know what's best. For Lord, it's not in strength and wisdom, but it's in weakness. It's in need. In my weakness, your strength is made perfect. In my need, your might, Lord, comes on the scene. And you show yourself mighty on my behalf. And God, I pray that you would continue to keep us close. Help us, Lord, not to stray like Solomon strayed and so many others. But help us to stay close to you and be thankful that you're a loving father. And you won't let us stray away. You won't let us go too far. You won't let us get uh lifted up in pride or caught up in our own success, but you'll constantly keep bringing us back to the reality of our need for you. for that is the most loving thing you can do for us is to keep us in that atmosphere. We love you God. We surrender our lives to you. Give us the eyes that we might see so that we Lord that we don't get distracted by the world or the things of the world. We don't get discouraged by the things that are happening. But may we may be encouraged that your eye is upon us and you're constantly guiding us and you're always doing what's best for us. We love you. We ask your blessings over all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. Blake, thank you Jesus for the things that you have brought me through. Though I can't repay with all my heart, I'd like to say that I thank you. Thank you, Jesus, for the things that you have brought me through. No, I can't repay with all my heart. I'd like to say, [Music] thank you and thank you Jesus [Music] for the grace that you have given us. We can never be with our life to say [Music] thank you. Through it all, through it all, [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus. [Music] I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I learn to depend on his word. I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials came to only make me strong. [Music] Through it all, [Music] through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. [Music] I learn to trust in God through it all. Through it all, I learn to live on his word. So I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleyies. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he can solve it. I never know what faith in God can do. Through it all, through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. [Music] I learn to trust in God through it all. through it all. Learn to get on his food. I thank God. So I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleys and I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he could solve it. Never know what faith in God can do. Through it all, through it all, through it all. I learn to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Through it all. Through it all. [Music] God is is good.
