TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i mean jesus could look with compassion on the crowd that was rejecting him hating him wagging their head at him because he understood what they went through and when we can get this kind of healing till we can look at the perpetrators of our hurt the ones who wounded us the most and say father i forgive them completely and i feel sorry for them they if they weren't hurt they wouldn't have hurt me this way if they hadn't been misled if they hadn't been deceived if they hadn't been abused if they hadn't been neglected they would have never done this to me and when you get down to that where brother brown says i got to go i can't go feeling the ricky regettas i got to go feeling the children of god that are caught in bondage and i can't go the rest of my life feeling like everybody's antichrist and everybody i can't live the rest of my life with everybody who disagrees with me doctrinally believing that they're antichrists and they're rickies and rickettis you've got to believe that they're children of god but they're in their own bondage man they're children of god with their own blindness they're children of god and have a feeling for the people again even the people have hurt you amen that is the power of christ that's the power of the spirit of god working in our life and purging out all that the devil has tried to sow in and it'll come when the stream of the word keeps flowing in your heart and pumping out all the impurities i'll tell you you don't have to live locked up shut down hurt stuck in the past dragging around an old ball and chain from childhood you don't have to live that way christ came to heal the broken heart and to set at liberty those that are bruised i say thank god it's not time to keep something stuffed this is time to bring it out and say god i need help with this this is time to let the revelation of the word amen expose say nothing happened in the life of a believer unless it first crossed god's desk and if god signed off on it i needed it for something and i'm thankful that it happened in my life let that revelation start to bring the healing process because that's nothing but the truth if you are a predestinated elect seed of god god knew what you would go through and god allowed it because it serves his purpose somehow and it's for your good right and when you can catch that revelation and say god i am thankful that you allowed this to happen for the lesson i'll learn and the help that i can be to somebody else now god i believe it i accept it now all my thinking is wrong i reject it but i need some help with the leftover residual pain would you come now and heal my wounded heart if you stay in the washing of the water of the word word by word scripture by scripture sermon by sermon he'll take all the impurities out until you're completely free free to trust free to love free to engage free to embrace free to not just receive but free to give that's how god wants us to live
