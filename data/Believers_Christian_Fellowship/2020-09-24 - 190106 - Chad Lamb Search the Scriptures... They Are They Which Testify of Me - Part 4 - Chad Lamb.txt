[Music] if you know to see you through the darkest night you can walk [Music] to keep you [Music] take time to pray every day and when you're heading who show you the way if you know the lord you need nobody [Music] if [Music] to see you through [Music] who can walk alone to keep you on the road marked right take time to pray every day the way if you know the lord you need to see take time to pray every day you hear the way you need nobody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] all things [Music] praise the lord amen it's good to be here today good to see you all we've had a little bit of a break without having service on wednesday so i'm eager to be together again amen let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to the gospel of john john chapter 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me we've heard this scripture before so now we're on part 4 on this the lord just opened up some more and i can't get away from it so we're just going to stay with it amen and not try to get away from it let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day and for all that you're doing for us lord as your children how you keep revealing yourself to us and opening your word and letting us see you more and more and god you're showing us ourselves in the mirror of your word well we just pray now that the reflection that you get back out of our lives will be a true one lord that you would mold the character lord that you for ordained to be there that you had molded in us lord that you let that life lord and the seed have preeminence over everything else we commit ourselves to you and ask that you would speak through these human lips today and have preeminence in this place anoint us to hear to receive to perceive all that you have for us today in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated man i just wanted to thank sister debbie for that special that was very nice i enjoyed that very much very encouraging praise the lord i was looking here at part four just because the the more i meditate on this the more it just becomes real amen the more you just get sucked into it and god keeps opening more and more and more so we're going to stay here and we've been talking about this for a little bit of time now search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me and we know that that's words that jesus is speaking and he's speaking to religious people he's speaking to people who knew the old testament had read it and had studied it amen and they were basing their eternal destination on the things that they were reading so they had absolute confidence in this word this is what jesus is pointing out search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life so the thing that you're willing amen to base your eternal destination on the thing that you hold in tremendous value amen that you would cherish that you're willing to fight for and that you're willing to to make sacrifices for he said the very thing that makes you think you have eternal life is the very thing that testifies of me and now they were rejecting him amen they were rejecting him and claiming a belief in the scriptures but he's pointing out you can't do that because the scriptures are the ones testifying of me you can't have it where you reject me and you take the scriptures because he is the scriptures made alive he's the manifestation of the scriptures so to reject him is to reject the scriptures by which you think you have eternal life [Applause] and so jesus is really i mean he's really turning the picture back on them and then they're they're rejecting him and they're they're claiming uh they're they're claiming uh um a birthright they're claiming an inheritance they're claiming a religious pedigree amen and jesus is saying everything that you everything that you're basing everything you're rejecting me on is the very thing that testifies of who i am now we've come to the place where the bride now can look through the scriptures and she sees christ all the way through amen but we know now that that by the by the opening of the seals the seventh seal in particular shows that that christ is both male and female that there's a male expression of christ in a female expression of christ and this is the masterpiece family when brother branham is preaching the masterpiece he's not preaching a singular masterpiece if you go back and listen to masterpiece or read it brother branham is talking about a masterpiece family that's why in the garden amen that's why back in the beginning when man was there alone he was looking for him to help me and there was no suitable help me amen because to help me was within him so god took the help meat out of him put in another body and joined the two together amen and then what was not good became very good we got that brother branham said that's the crowning act of creation him and that's the that's the moment that's when he looked at everything and everything was very good so we find out that that that's the mystery man that's the mystery of adam there was a greater mystery to the man than when he was made flesh and began to walk around amen to the creation that was a mystery revealed because he before was hovering over working like the holy spirit the invisible the spirit man who was who had dominion who had rulership as a god over the earth he was ruling in spirit form and the animals and all of creation they couldn't see they could maybe feel his presence maybe see him orchestrating things he brother man said he was like the holy spirit so there was a mystery to creation of who this god was that's having dominion over the earth amen but then god would reveal the mystery by taking the man and forming him into flesh making him in the same fashion as the rest of the creation on earth and now that was a mystery revealed and there was a revelation of the mystery of this man who was running everything amen but then as the man began to walk around amen they began to rejoice because now the lion wouldn't just feel his presence but the lion could actually brush up against him amen and rub against another being like him that he could touch amen but there was another mystery a deep mystery yet and there was another mystery of adam and that was the mystery of the woman that was inside of him and then god's appointed time there would come a time that another great mystery which was wrapped up in this mystery amen would be revealed and now the animals wouldn't see just one form of adam they would see two forms of the same atom they would see male and female and god called their name adam there was only one and that one was adam and adam was male and female and that was a greater mystery amen so when jesus christ was here the word made flesh amen when he was when he was walking the earth amen it was a mystery a great mystery revealed amen the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now he could be handled amen now he could be seen they could hear an audible vocal cords coming out amen of this great creation it was a mystery but yet there was a great mystery laying inside of that man because the word was made flash and the brightest part of the word and she was there in that creation when the word was made flesh she was right there with jesus christ walking this earth amen you've already walked by the sea of galilee amen you've already calmed the storm you have already faced the dissenters and the pharisees and you've already done it all amen all you're doing is repeating what's already be done because you did it when you were with him there in that creation you walked on the water you spoke to the storm you spoke to the fig tree amen do you believe that [Applause] amen so now why is it so difficult to think that it can happen again it's already happened amen when we were there there was a great mystery laying there and that mystery that was that in that body of flesh was the ingredients for the bride and at calvary he would separate out the ingredients amen and he would go to start forming the bride amen and he's been forming her through seven church ages and now he gets he gets that he gets reformed and now he speaks life into her and now she's here expressing the very life of jesus christ hallelujah a great mystery that's why that's why brother branham said when you go to say i and my father are one and these other things the shock begins to pull away amen why it's just a realization of the reality of who i am amen when i say who i am i'm not talking about the man in the mirror i realize that this flesh has come through corruption amen that's why there's been a price of redemption paid and that price of redemption would redeem me back then put me back in my ought to have been conditioned amen where this flesh will actually change into a glorified body it's already redeemed it's already working in my body amen the the redemption amen the resurrection the transformation is already taking place because where this body amen used to be addicted to cigarettes this body used to be addicted to all kinds of hideous things amen there's another life inside that has grabbed this body and making the body subject to the life that's on the inside showing that there's a transforming power that's already at work praise be to god and so now it's a reality of what's taking place will allow her to say my father and i are one why jesus could say my father and i are one amen he says before abraham i was and they took up stones to stone him they didn't want to hear that that's impossible amen how could you say such a thing like that because it's true that's how he can say it it's true he doesn't have to explain it he doesn't have to make anybody understand it he doesn't have to qualify his statement it's just the truth before abraham was i am they took up stones to stone him amen he didn't say put down your stone i'll explain it to you i'll draw you a diagram amen if you'll just give me a couple of hours i'll break it down so that you can easily understand it he wasn't here to make unbelievers easily understand the word he was here calling for the genuine believers and he didn't have to qualify his statements he didn't have to explain what he was going to say all he had to do was speak the truth [Applause] and the seed will come to the seed amen the word to the word as long as it's truth amen they'll come together and when you when you go to say brother ben says when you go to say i and my father are one in these other things there's a lot of other things then the shock begins to pull away hallelujah just to believe the message makes you crazy in the eyes of a carnal world say i don't have to go into judgment i've passed from condemnation from judgment when did you pass i was already judged in him on calvary i can't be judged again that's a that's an insane statement to somebody with a carnal mind but yet it's the truth they say i was in the thoughts of god an attribute of god there amen before the foundation of the world waiting for my time to be expressed here on this earth amen that's the truth but it doesn't sound logical it doesn't sound reasonable amen because it defies human logic and human reasoning it's another kind of logic it's another kind of reasoning so so jesus says search the scriptures and now the bride can say search the scriptures search the scriptures they are they that testify of who i am i can point to numerous scriptures that shows the day i'm living in and what's happening right now that there are there is a female expression that there's a bride and there's been a mystery of the bride all the way through the scriptures search the scriptures they are they that testify of us brother branham said in adoption he said what happened i ask you now i'm a typologist and any man that knows the bible is a typologist this is good friends he said i'm a typologist now the very thing that he'll get criticized for and you and i will get criticized for brother brandon makes a statement and any man that knows the bible is a typologist now if you go to seminary they don't want to teach typology because i mean it's it's too uh it's too subject to opinion it's too random and then you could you can mess it up they want to teach terms like exegesis and and and what other hard words uh hermenetics or whatever i don't even know what they mean i'm just saying things that i've heard you go to bible class and they they they say you've got to study the scripture verse by verse by verse you can't take anything out of context you can't just grab one portion of a verse or one verse and pull out of context and and my argument to that is jesus never taught by exegesis jesus never taught verse by verse he would pull a little piece out of something david said here a little piece out of most a little piece out of there and he would bring him together and say it's right here so you go to a seminary and teach somebody how to preach contrary to the way jesus preached contrary to the way the apostle paul preached hallelujah i mean just ideas of man amen and some of those things unfortunately weave their way into the message amen and we want to start taking seminary ideas and and way the word has been broke down and the way the things have been defined through seven church ages and i say forget it amen let the message teach us how to handle the word let the prophet teach us how to handle the word let's look at how jesus handled it how did paul handle it how did peter handle it how did how did john handle it hallelujah he said i'm a typologist and any man that knows the bible is a typologist further he says in abraham and a seed after him from 1961 whether i can satisfy you with it or not i do not know but to me it certainly satisfies me in being not efficient in education therefore i approach the scriptures from the standpoint of a type and more like a typologist to type what has been that will be because we know that the scripture each have compound meaning that like in matthew 3 it said out of egypt i've called my son now if you'll run that reference back you'll find out that it meant jacob his son and also jesus his son so in typing we see where the old testament types the new and all these different shadows and types like the moon and the sun and type of christ in the church and as the sun goes down the moon gives light and the absence of the sun just like as the s-o-n left the earth to go into glory to the father then the moon the church gives the light how the moon gets its light is reflecting the sunlight to the earth for a lesser light and all these things it may seem more like a baby form for great theologians but i don't believe i'm talking to many of those and if i am then you excuse me my illiterate way of trying to present it but i would ask you that you search it thoroughly before you rudely disagree with it brother bam showing he's just pulling out types and and this types this and this type stat and this type staff and he begins to explain the revelation of the hour by showing the types the way it's come down through history and i want to take a look we can turn to john chapter 6 together i want to look at this as a as i just lay down a foundation here on on this kind of teaching i'm going to look at jesus and we want to look at the apostle paul and see how they handle the word in john chapter 6 verse 32 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life into the world now they had just asked him to show a sign he had just fed multitudes he had crossed the leg they come to him and they said will you show us a sign and they said moses gave us bread in the wilderness and so now they're pointing back amen to a literal thing that happened when there was literal bread that would fall like dew upon the ground and they would go out in the morning in the exodus journey and they would gather what they needed for that day and they would actually physically eat of that bread amen and now jesus is going to take that he's going to take that bread falling from heaven that heavenly manna and manna means what is it literal translation is what is it i mean they come out in the morning and they looked at it and they said what is it amen that's the same thing they did to jesus christ when he was the bread of god that came down from heaven he come on earth and all the religious leaders looked at him and said what is it where did you get your authority how do you say these things where was your schooling amen what is it we don't it don't make any sense that's what the manna is like when it comes down from heaven the people are like what is this i don't get it that was the message it come down amen the living bread of life from heaven and everybody's like what is this i mean i don't get it it doesn't make sense it's heavenly manna so here they're they're starting to talk about a literal event that took place in the bible and now jesus is going to take that story and he's going to bring it up a notch into a spiritual level amen and if you have amen if you would have today jesus doing the same thing if we could just transport ourselves back to that day and we could be standing there and all the religious leaders of that day had been through training the the priesthood the levites have been through training amen and they knew the word they knew it exactly they knew it word by word they had it memorized because the word was very valuable to them but all they had was the word amen they were missing the life but they had the word they had the hard fast word and they could not flex on that whatsoever so they didn't understand what that word was actually representing all they knew was literal bread that felt like dew in the morning literally go out and eat it and that's all the farther that example could go it couldn't go anywhere else it couldn't be taught any other way except god's provision in the wilderness and a heavenly bread you physically ate it sustained us in a journey it was a miracle and that's it period done we can't do anything else with that and here comes jesus and he's going to take the same thing if you could just put yourself in the same spot jesus starts to do things with the word that they're not allowed to do he starts taking that and saying that was only a type that wasn't the real bread from heaven but the real bread from heaven is he that's come down from heaven and all of a sudden they're like how can you say that by what authority to you say what school have you been to amen nobody can do that with the scriptures jesus can [Applause] hallelujah man and that's why brother brennan can be a typologist say any man that knows the bible is a typologist because that's what jesus was jesus was a typologist [Applause] verily verily i say unto you moses gave you that not the bread from heaven but my father give you through the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread it's amazing that god will do something to lay a shadow down so the bread falling from heaven the exodus journey all it was was laying a shadow down it even wasn't it wasn't even the thing that god had in his mind he wanted to accomplish it was laying a shadow down to point to the thing he had in his mind he wanted to accomplish if we could just understand this in the bible that god is working his great love story brother ben said the bible is a love story it's not individual verses in individual chapters and individual books no sir it's one book one story one great love story one big love letter that's meant to be read between the lines [Applause] amen so now he comes down and and now we realize that what was happening with moses and and the fire on mount sinai and the mountain shaking and the man of falling and red sea parting and you just go down through the bible and all these things that wasn't even the thing that god had in his mind to do it was just laying a shadow to the thing that he had in his mind that he wanted to do so that when he came and did it he could point back to the shadow and see this is that and this is that we're living in the day when everything he wanted to do is coming to fruition amen all the shadows are coming to today every shadow every type everything that's laid down in the bible is coming to life today amen and we can look back and say that's this that's this that's this that's this because that wasn't even what he wanted to do this is what he's always wanted to do and he had to lay a shadow so that when we get here we have some authority to preach by [Applause] so the prophet of god could pick it up amen and he began to explain by what by the shadow explaining the reality oh praise be to god we can't be children anymore amen tossed about using our carnal mind we've got to come to the real revelation of the word let it be revealed to us amen so jesus is here telling them trying to tell them the reality of what they've always believed they always believed they were in an exodus and god brought them out and moses fed them bread and they always believed that but jesus is trying to tell him why they've always believed that and they didn't want to believe what god was doing today they only wanted to believe what he had done it's easy to believe what he has done the hard part is to believe what he's doing today right this moment i'm not even talking 50 years ago i'm talking right this moment if you want to talk where the challenge is the challenge is to find out and believe and accept what he's doing at this moment in time there's a whole slew of people that can accept what god did 50 some years ago but you have to accept what god is doing today and so all those were shadows all of those foreshadowed what was happening and now jesus comes and he begins to tell them amen that wasn't the real bread amen but my father gave the real bread and the bread is he that come down from heaven and now they're so carnally stuck in a carnal mind i say god fix this carnal mind of mine because my biggest problem is this old carnal mind this old carnal nature that wants to see amen that always thinks one and one plus one equals two amen that's just earthly things that's just natural things amen but with god one plus one can equal whoever knows what number stop thinking with an education stop thinking with a carnal mind we've got to stop thinking with natural things we will never understand the bible with a carnal mind and an intellectual understanding neither will we understand the message he's telling them amen about the real bread he that come down from heaven and they said oh give us this bread and they're still looking for something that they can put in their mouth into and swallow and digest and they're missing the entire thing because he's speaking spiritual and they're looking natural we're in the same day friends because when it came time to move from the jews to the gentiles the transition was from natural to spiritual brother man said everything that happened naturally to the jews happened spiritually to the bride these are spiritual happenings these are spiritual things this is a spiritual bread this is spiritual water amen this is spiritual everything is spiritual [Applause] sometimes we still want to say oh where's the bread at hold your hand out i'll take some bread it doesn't come like that it's not the kind of eating you do with your teeth it's not the kind of drinking that you do from a jug or a glass it's not that kind of food and drink so when they said they to the lord evermore give us this bread in verse 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst oh praise god let's read that again 35 jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i said unto you that you also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out so he gives him the secret ingredient you can't see it unless the father calls you i mean i'm telling you plainly but you can't see it and i am that bread and if you eated this bread you'll neither hunger any more neither shall you thirst so now it's just like when he's talking to the samaritan woman by the by the well amen in samaria he comes to her and he asks her to give a drink and she says you know i'm a samaritan you're a jew he said if you knew who you were talking to you would ask me of drinking i would give you drink of living waters that you never thirst no more neither come here to draw and she says sir give me of those no first she says but the well is deep and you have nothing to draw with so the waters i give are waters of everlasting life she says sir give me this water he's not talking about the water in the well he's not talking about the h2o liquid he is he is preaching typology amen because brother jesus sits here and tells him if you come to me you'll never hunger nor thirst no more amen but it doesn't make any sense because the disciples come to him amen after after pentecost amen when he breaks himself up on the feast of pentecost and he comes into them and shows it as licks of fire amen and now they have god living inside they're eating and they're drinking but yet in their natural body they become hungry again and have to eat food and in their natural body they have to become thirsty again and they have to drink amen because he's not talking about natural when he says you'll neither hunger no more or thirst it had nothing to do with their flesh body it had nothing to do with natural anything he's speaking purely spiritual and all their hearing is natural jesus was a typologist this woman thought she wanted some natural water that would never make her come to the well again for natural water that sounded pretty good i mean back then it wasn't like going over to the tap and you're flipping it open it comes down this woman had to haul water every day back and forth to the well who knows how long of a walk it was if it was cold if it was hot if it was raining you still go haul water so now she's heard about water that you'll never thirst and either come here to draw and she says i'll take it give it to me he says go get your husband go get your husband what's he gonna do he's going to give her the water go get your husband i don't have a husband he said what you said is true because you've had five and the one you're living with is not yours she says sir i perceive you're a prophet what's he doing he's giving her the water not natural water or spiritual order sir i perceive you're a prophet she said give me the water he says go get your husband. so the first thing he's going to do is give the sign of the messiah through a prophet discerning her situation and she says i perceive you're a prophet and then her next question our fathers say in this mountain we should worship but you say in jerusalem is the place of worship see jesus realized she was thirsty she didn't even realize how thirsty she was she was coming to get natural water and she didn't know that she was going to get the living water that day that she would never thirst again see jesus is a typologist he says where's worship and he says we know what you worship you don't know where you worship but i tell you the time has come and is now when they that worship him shall worship in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him you know what she says next i know that when messiah comes that woman was desperately thirsty she was thirsty all along because when she meets a prophet looking for natural water where's your husband tells her her condition she says you're a prophet when she says you're a prophet she says where are we supposed to worship god she is thirsty she is hungry she wants to know god she wants to worship god she wants to be right with god she's hungry and she's thirsty not for what she can get out of the well and not what she can bake with cornmeal she's thirsty and hungry for something else her spirit the life inside of her is hungering and thirsting for something else and here he is the manna amen the fountain of living water he's standing there right with her and he's going to give her this drink he's going to give her this meat she said when messiah comes he'll do these things he said i am he i speak it to thee what did she get a personal revelation of jesus christ what did brother branham said the new birth was a personal revelation of jesus christ that woman just got the new birth she just got the personal revelation of jesus christ she just found the well she found the manna amen she sits there the disciples come that time they're wondering about why she's there she sits there and then she drops her pot and she runs into the city because now she's got water and she's got food amen and she's willing she says come and see a man that's told me everything i've ever done it's not just the messiah you see jesus was not talking about water and meat but he was talking about water and meat you just have to have eyes to see and ears to hear only those who the father draws can see only who the father brings can understand everybody else looks at it and it's crazy it doesn't make sense it doesn't always add up amen i see this and this and this and the message but i see this and this and i can't get them to correlate because it's not for the unbelievers amen it's only for the bride the message is for the bride it's not to be intellectually understood it's not to be pieced together it's not to be categorized it's not to be diagrammed it's not to be explained it's to be received and believed doesn't have to be explained there's some unexplainable parts to the message praise god i believe anyways the hard parts i believe the unexplainable parts i believe which part do you believe i don't know i just believe what about this statement this statement i believe them which one both of them [Applause] how do they fit brother ted i don't know how they fit but they're true don't have to explain it just believe it we come back to john chapter six let's skip down to verse 48. jesus says i am that bread of life your fathers that eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die he says i am the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world amen that's when the dialogue just goes even more nutty i mean it goes from odd to totally insane because he says i'm the bread and then they said well let me have that bread he says no i'm the bread and he says now the bread that i give for the world is my flesh that i shall give for the for the world so i shall live forever more in the bread that i will give as my flesh which i will give for the life of the world then he goes in to eat my flesh and drink my blood and now they go right back right back right back to literal eating and literal drinking he just tried to break him from that amen and say no i'm the bread of life that came down amen and then he says now the bread that i'm going to give is my flesh which is the word made flesh it's the word made flesh what is the bread the living word is there bread available today absolutely there's living word available today there's still bread to be feasting on if you're hungry spiritually there's a meat here that you can eat and it is the living word that has come down from god out of heaven it is the flesh amen it is the body it is the word of jesus christ on display it's the word of god on display hallelujah amen now they're still literally looking to eat something and to drink something and when he says my flesh and my blood the only thing they can get in their brains is actually cutting the man up into little pieces and eating his flesh and chewing on it and blood squirting out the corner of their mouth cannibalism is the only thing they can see vampirism drinking blood is the only thing they can see amen because they don't have eyes to see and they don't have ears to see and that's why he said it that way good thing he looked at peter and said you're going to go too everybody's like this is hard i can't deal with this will you go too peter said where will you where will we go peter could even be thinking i don't want to eat his flesh brother man said they didn't understand what he was saying peter himself can be struggling within himself thinking i don't really want to drink human blood i i don't understand what he's saying and he's struggling within himself and he turns and said well you guys go also and he says where will i go thou alone have the words of eternal life i don't know what you're talking about i'm not necessarily liking what i'm hearing but i know you alone have the words of eternal life and this message is christ amen it is the living bread of life that's come down out of heaven amen and it's the truth hallelujah and it is the rising of the sun 1965 brother brennan said blessed art thou see son of jonas bless flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys whatever you bind on earth i'll bind it in heaven what you loose on earth that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh so what did what did uh peter catch from god it was the divine revelation of the word made flesh you can say he caught that jesus christ was the son of god but what he really caught was the divine revelation of the word made flesh because this is what brother ben says next that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh and that day by the sun the groom it's fleshed today by the bride so what is the revelation that we need from the father today we need to know where amen where the divine word is being made flesh hallelujah and that's where the rub comes that's where the problem comes because it's fine to say he was right there walking on earth amen peter got it amen what peter got was the divine revelation of the word made flesh and only the father could give that to him amen and when he got that he was given the keys amen he was recognized as guarding the right revelation remember we need the same thing today not the divine revelation of the word that was made flesh but the divine revelation of the word made flesh today and if it was flesh in that day by the groom then it's fleshed today by the bride and it is going to take a divine revelation from the father to recognize that amen because what are you looking at when you look at the bride what are you looking around and see you're seeing people with problems amen you're seeing faults amen you're seeing different things you're like how can that be amen it's not me amen it's not this amen don't look around and get too tied up with what you see on the outside amen what is the life that's coming through amen what is the life that's taking over what's happening in the lives of the people as they change from glory unto glory unto glory what is it the divine revelation of the words being made flesh again in my flesh in your flesh hallelujah brother said the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word that's a monumental task to do all by yourself that's why you don't do it by yourself it's not a life that we live with the life he lives through us it's a yielding it's not a working it's not a laboring it's not a running it's a resting it's something that he must do himself that's why the second photo of his threefold plan that's tied to the seventh seal amen that's been in the back part of god's mind all of this time his whole plan his whole desire was a three-fold purpose so his whole desire wasn't an exodus out of egypt his whole plan amen his whole plan wasn't isaiah the prophet his whole plan amen was not deliverance from jezebel through elijah that wasn't his whole plan his whole plan wasn't elisha with a double portion they were shadowing pointing to what his plan was they were laying down a shadow laying down a type so we can see the plan all the way through but there's only been one plan there's only been one goal there's only been one thought in god's mind and everything has been working and pointing towards this one thought they get preeminence under man he did that in christ jesus they get preeminence in the people he's doing that now in the bride to restore them back to an eden-like condition that's the whole plan of the bible that's the whole theme of the scriptures and we're standing here in the second fold of a threefold plan about ready to step into the third fold of this threefold plan amen and everything that's been in the bible everything that's been written and everything that's happened is trying to show us where we are today hallelujah they're not flannel graph bible stories i like flannel graphs so i'm not knocking flannel graph they're not bible stories they're not things that happened to people a long time ago they're things that are happening to us today and it was late there was a shadow so we could see it today but only if you have eyes to see and ears to hear let's turn back to john chapter 3. john chapter 3 verse 12. if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you heavenly things and no man hath ascended to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life so what was god's great goal in the wilderness was it to lift up the brazen serpent no it was to lift up christ to take away the sins of the world so what did he do in the exodus journey when the people were being bitten by fiery serpents what was the problem in the beginning amen eve was bitten by a fiery serpent there was a poison life hybrid life injected into the into the life of god's children and there was a hybridization taking place so there was a there was a biting of the serpent amen the the deception of his mouth laid a poison trap and now they were dying by this poison of these fiery serpents but if they would look amen to the serpent wrapped around the pole if they would look to that amen they would look and they would live amen so what was the point of coming to this place in the exodus journey what was the point of the murmuring of the people what was the point of the fiery serpent the whole point was so that when christ was lifted up he could point back and say see like he did there that's what's got to happen again it wasn't for them amen it was for those that would see christ lifted up that they could live amen from the effect of the poison from the serpents hallelujah now we just took a big word like exegesis and just crumpled it up and threw it in the waste past and i don't even really know what it means for sure i might be using it wrong but i don't think you care and i certainly don't care as long as we use the scriptures right that's what matters so jesus now takes a physical thing that happened and said that's only a type you think that was important but the son of man must be lifted up and whoever looks on him will live let's go to hebrews chapter 12. i just really wanted to slow down we've been talking about this for some time but i want to slow down and actually look at this so that we're all equipped immensely we all know where we stand in the scriptures hebrews chapter 12 we're going to look at the writings of the apostle paul as he's preaching here to the hebrews now the hebrews knew the scriptures right these were the jews they knew the scriptures they knew the old testament and here here comes the apostle paul in chapter 12 we'll begin at verse 18 for you are not coming to the mount that might be touched it burn with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest and unto the sound of the trumpet and the voice of words which voice that they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they should not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight moses said i exceedingly fear and quake so now he's going back into the old testament and he's pointing to a time when they were all gathered around mount sinai and there was instructions given to moses and a fire that fell and an earthquake that come and nothing was supposed to come up to the mountain he's pointing back to there and he's going to use it as a type and he comes here verse 22 he says but you you're not come to that mountain but ye are come unto mount zion visible or invisible invisible spiritual he pointed that everything was natural a mountain buried around the mountain thrust through with the dark earthquake fire voice natural natural natural natural and he's turning on them and say you haven't come to one thing natural but what you've come to is all spiritual you're coming to mount zion unto the city of the living god now he's not saying you're coming to it you have come to it you're not at the mountain you're at mount zion where is it paul i think i missed it where is it i don't see it i can't touch it he says you've not come to the mountain that can be touched this mountain can't be touched with these hands but yet you've already come to it you've come to mount zion to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than able amen see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth what's he saying now refuse not him that speaketh i don't hear him speaking he's pointing back and say they refused him that spoke before on earth amen what was it it was a voice a thundering loud trumpeting voice and they all heard it but now he's saying don't refuse him that's speaking now i don't hear thunder i don't hear a trumpet i don't hear a loud voice no he was speaking through paul he was speaking through john he was speaking through james he was speaking through timothy but he was speaking right then right there and you can't refuse him that speaketh now because his voice is in the bride see that you refuse not him that speaketh speaketh speaketh present tense speaking not had spoke will speak him that speaketh this is all spiritual friends the the gentiles come to everything spiritually that's why the gentiles have a greater faith amen because when he comes to the when he comes to the the soldier the soldier comes to him and says i've got one of my servants is sick and and and jesus comes or he sits fetches somebody to go get jesus jesus says i'll come he says no don't even come just speak the word because he didn't need jesus to come physically lay hands on him brother said that was a jewish tradition here's a gentile and jesus says i've not seen faith like this no not in all of israel because you won't find that faith in israel until we get to the 144 000 this is the kind of faith the gentiles have that they don't have to see to believe amen praise god that's the gentile faith see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven he's talking about christ who is currently speaking not from earth but he's speaking from heaven and how is he speaking through little human beings standing on the earth and when they preach the gospel he's speaking from heaven and when god spoke before on the mountain it trumpeted a blast so fearful that the mountain quake and and moses said i quaked and feared exceedingly it was a voice that actually moved the mountain it was a voice that they all could hear it was a voice that they all ran away from there was no mistaking they could heard it amen and he calls that speaking from earth a lower level of revelation but this speaking that doesn't shake a rock that you cannot feel that you cannot hear this speaking is speaking from heaven and this speaking from heaven is going to shake everything and you'll never see a rock move or a piece of dust fall off it's all spiritual that's being shaken he says for if they escaped who not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth today not earth only but also heaven hallelujah that's going on right now but you can't see the chair shake and you can't see any insulation fall from the roof but but the speaking from heaven is shaking all things you can't see it with these eyes you can't feel it with these hands you can't perceive it with a carnal mind this is for the elect only and that's not anything that's mean that's the nicest thing that we can say because if he didn't save son all would be lost the only hope that the foolish virgin have the only hope amen that those who are kind to the bride the only hope they have is that god would choose some so that he could redeem so that he could save so that he doesn't annihilate the earth it's the nicest thing we could ever say is this is only for the elect amen because it's for the elect that redemption came it's for the elect that the earth was redeemed it's for the elect amen that will be a new heavens and a new earth for those that are granted entrance at the white throne judgment to come into if he didn't save some if he didn't choose some none would be safe all would be lost praise god hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 still laying a foundation a deep foundation might be a big building we've got to dig deep to lay the foundation hebrews 10 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very things not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and too perfect so he's saying the law has a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things so the whole law and all the sacrifices and all the feasts amen they were only showing an image of what was to come so did god want a levitical priesthood did he want an aaronic priesthood amen did he want animal sacrifices did he want a tabernacle did he want a temple amen did no he didn't want all of that what he wanted was his threefold purpose what he wanted was preeminence and a man preeminence and restoration back to the even condition and everything is pointing to that everything is pointing every sacrifice is pointing to christ all the feast is pointing to the plan of redemption amen what's he doing he is shadowing foreshadowing what's in his heart to do now you can see why the pharisees and the sadducees and the herodians and the scribes they totally missed it when jesus came because everything in the old testament was laying as a shadow pointing to his coming amen pointing to the time that when he would be here fulfilling the purpose that all those shadows pointed down and when he come they rejected him and wanted to hold the shadow he said i believe this but i don't believe you you can't have it that way you can't say i believe this but i don't believe you he is that that is pointing to him he's the greater revelation of the thing you're digging your nails into and holding on to the he's the greater revelation of that amen you can't hold this and refuse this the same thing's true true with the bright coming of christ amen the new testament is pointing out christ and the bride christ and his bride amen i'm speaking about a husband and wife but really this is a great mystery i'm talking to you christ in the church and then it's laid down and you say i want to hold on to paul amen that thing that you've got your nails dug into is trying to show us a bride coming of christ [Applause] say i refuse that i refuse what that prophet taught i refuse what those people are preaching about amen that's what paul is trying to tell us amen that's what john is trying to show us and then the thing you're holding on to the thing that you think you have eternal life with is the thing that is talking about this happening today this divine revelation of the word made flesh today is the very thing you're basing your eternal salvation on and rejecting the very happening that's referred to in the book that you love so much because we're looking for natural things to happen a natural mountain and a natural voice a naturalness and it's all spiritual amen when the son of man came brother says the son of man well we know the son of man is jesus christ the one that walked and dressed and ate and all that but when the son of man came it came in the ministry of william branham and you couldn't see that body that walked on the sea of galilee but you could see the sign of the messiah you could see the sign of the myth you could see it if you have eyes to see but it's the son of man but not the same way they saw the son of man last time they saw him is that fair the son of man came but he didn't come the same way the first time he came in a body a singular body of flesh was raised up was baptized went into the ministry but when the son of man come this time amen the son of man the person of the holy ghost himself came he came to work through a ministry of a prophet and you couldn't see him in the same form he was in the first time when he said the son of man must be lifted up do you understand that types shadows pointing to something else let's go to galatians chapter 4. sticking with paul here galatians chapter 4 verse 22. for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bond made the other by a free woman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman but was by promise he's talking about hagar and he's talking about sarah the story that we know so well all the jews knew this story amen it was well known but it comes to the next verse he says which things are an allegory you know the whole deal with abraham being called out amen if abraham was really living this word amen he was really called away and separated from his father's house separated into a strange land separated from law amen then he had this issue and then he had a promise of a son but his wife couldn't bring forth and then she came up with the idea of hagar he accepted her idea went into hagar had ishmael amen now ishmael is not the one now it's got to come through sarah now she meets elohim on the plains amen and elohim begins to tell him about the destruction of sodom reveals the the the mystery in the heart of sarah amen all of these things are taking place amen and this isn't even the thing god wants to do this isn't even thing what's he doing he's laying down an allegory because when he comes to do it he wants to point back and say see now this is what i really have been wanting to do it wasn't that it was real for abraham it wasn't that he was really walking he was really walking and he was really living in it it was a reality amen but that reality was just a shadow just a type just an allegory so that the apostle paul would get back up here and he would say now these things are just an allegory it's not really about hagar it's not really about sarah it's not really about abraham listen to what he says i'll be in verse 23 again but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants they're not even two births they're not even two babies they're two covenants how can paul do this to the scriptures because he has the mind of christ he's saying it's not what you think it is it's not about the babies it's not about abraham it's not sarah it's not hagar these are two covenants these are two covenants the one from mount sinai which gendereth the bondage which is agar for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answers to jerusalem which now is is in bondage with her children but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all what what's paul what's paul even saying haggar is really two covenants haggar is really talking about amen uh sinai and sinai is pointing to jerusalem jerusalem is the old jewish religion we've been brought out of jerusalem into the new and living way into the way of grace amen and now the one is pointing to jerusalem natural the other one is pointing to jerusalem which is the mother of us all he's not talking natural he's speaking spiritual and he's taking cold hard facts that happen in the old testament and he's showing that's only a shadow that's only a time that's only that was only there so that i can come today and point to it and tell you the truth behind it praise god brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he vindicated himself in daniel and in moses and in jeremiah what were they the prophets which the word came to see them great men see you've heard the story told of dreaming joseph you've seen in daniel and the lion's den and all these other ones you know them that that what they what were they prophets see but the the main one god was just temporarily typing in them he typed himself in adam knowing what was right but walked out to redeem his wife because she was wrong christ didn't have to be sin but he walked out and took sin to redeem his lost child see he typed he he typed himself so all of these men all these prophets all these patriarchs is just christ typing himself praise god sometimes sometimes we've got bible study down to where we know who birth to and what their name was and where you find them in the bible and what chapter joseph comes in and everything that happened to him and we can get in chronological order and have no idea what the story's about not a clue what it's actually about because it's not about amen it's not about joseph being sold into slavery it's about jesus christ being sold for 30 pieces of silver amen it's not about him going into prison it's about jesus going into this prison house on the cross it's not about his ascension to the right hand of pharaoh it's about christ's ascension to the right hand of god amen it's not about joseph it's about christ [Applause] and if we get stuck in joseph and we get stuck in abraham we're stuck in sarah and all we're looking at is ink blotches on paper and discerning it with an intellect we have no idea what the bible's really about but it's a love story that's showing us the threefold purpose of god we've come to the end time amen where these things are revealed where we can look back with eyes our eyes of understanding being open and we know it's nothing to do with joseph it's everything to do with christ nothing to do with moses everything to do with christ not about being bitten by an earthly snake amen and looking to an earthly image of brass and being healed it's about christ being lifted up amen to free us from the death sting that had come in the garden of eden amen it's not about what we think it's about it's about what we know by revelation it's about and the whole bible is about what we're living out today he goes on to say in christ the mystery of god revealed i've just pulled quotes from different spots they're not in order all these things typed him just in time but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do some now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it expressing himself in moses and david and joseph and elijah and on down through we we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show it express jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never give his secret in full waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it he told the whole thing if he told the whole thing because the bible is written in mysteries jesus thanked the father for it see that it was wrote in mysteries hallelujah even today when the mystery's been revealed it's still a mystery unless you have eyes to see and used to hear another quote out of christ is the mystery he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible what's he talking about the seventh seal the coming of the lord he has showed it he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible did the prophet say every type not just a few every type that's why when the seals opened it opened the entire bible this is why brother branham could say after the seals are open he says my bible has become a new book now listen listen friends this is a prophet of god with prophetic insight into the word who had received interpretations of scriptures by the word of god verbally to him telling him what these scriptures mean before the seals opened before the seals of god would say this is the interpretation of that scripture he'd have him the wind flipped to a certain page and ask a question and god would interpret it god told him before the seals opened jesus of the old testament jehovah's the old testament is jesus of the new. all of these things amen brother branham i was given an interpretation divinely by god on the scriptures he had a prophetic eye so that when we look at the scriptures he would see it through a prophetic eye amen when he's preaching in 53 my bible is becoming a new book when he's preaching in 55 my bible bible's becoming preaching in 60 all of these times amen it's making the bible live but the prophet of god after all of that the gift of the prophecy preaching the word for so many years he can come to the opening of the seals and something in the opening of the seals change to where he says my bible has become a new book praise god he must have seen something in those seals since it must have struck him a particular way amen because he preached serpent seed godhead water baptism all those things he preached before the seals but something happened at the seals where he says my bible became a new book and he says when when the seals were taken off the bible it opened up the entire bible if it opened up the entire bible it's not just the parts he talked about but if it opened the entire bible it opened the entire bible and brother branham points he starts showing us that that title deed in the right hand of him that sits on the throne sealed with seven seals he tells us what that is he says that's the title deed of redemption that's the marriage certificate that's the bible that's that's the abstract title that's all of these he gives it all these names for that and he calls it the bible and he calls it whatever but then we see in revelations 10 that the seals are tore off and now that's an open book amen and the mighty angel comes down and he has it in his hand amen and john who's a type of the bride is told go to the angel with the open book and take it out of his hands and eat it up so now where is the open book the open bible amen the marriage certificate the title deed of redemption the abs where is it now it's in the bride it's in those who have eaten the book it's in her and she's told to prophesy again amen and she's not told to go outside of brother bennett's ministry she's not told to rise higher than brother branham that's not what she's told but she's told to take what he said and say it again amen we have no authority without a prophet we don't even understand the scriptures unless the prophet broke it down it's not it's not leaving the prophet it's taking what the prophet said what he showed us amen and he says i'm just hitting the high spots just enough so that you'll know it he said you search these things out that's why the bride is not afraid of the bible i said that before but she's not afraid she's not afraid of the book of exodus she's not afraid of the book ecclesiastes she's not afraid of proverbs she's not afraid of psalms she's not afraid of the song of solomon she's not afraid of revelation she's not afraid of galatians she's not afraid of leviticus there's no part in the bible that she stays away from and she's afraid of amen she's eaten the book amen the revelation with the threefold plan and this whole bible is sharing the same revelation one revelation one goal that he had in his mind from before the foundation of the world and everything in the bible's been typing every character has been bringing it forth hallelujah he showed it or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ hmm the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible now can you see why brother bannon's bible became a new book now it's not old and new testament don't talk to me about old new testament it's one book with one purpose don't talk to me about to the jews and to the gentiles no no no not after the seals don't talk to me that way don't talk to me about that was for the book of hebrews was just for hebrew believers for messianic jews don't talk to me about the old testament or the levitical law was just don't you dare talk to me that way because this is my love letter amen this is my book amen that talks about the one purpose god had in his mind before the foundation of the world and when i read it i'm not looking for laws that apply amen there i'm looking for the revelation of the mystery to identify me in the day that i'm living in that's why brother branham's bible became a new book i believe you read this again the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is all the acts of the believers there was some horrible acts of the believers but they're all working in this plan somewhere all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now this is my favorite part of the whole quote and now can you say now now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it so what are you waiting for a great revelation to come it's already come where is it how about digging in those tapes in those books and finding out because the revelations already come and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning that's the only way you're going to see it is with god's help with god's help you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it what do you think christ is the mystery of god revealed is all about it's all about the seventh seal it's all about the great mystery the one purpose that god had in his mind and he typed it in moses and he typed it in david he typed it in joseph he typed it he typed it typed it typed it typed it what's he doing he's showing one purpose one goal one plan that he's had all along that's the only way to read the bible with that one purpose in mind he goes on to say what's his purpose now express himself as a son see and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily i've got colossians laying right laying here right before me see that all through the scripture that's what god's purpose was what was that the fullness of the godhead bodily they're all through the scripture that's what god's purpose was then through this life of his son his cross the blood it says here of his cross that he might reconcile to himself a body a bride which is eve second eve and god give it in a type like he did moses and all of them the same thing he did in adam and eve giving a type that they were christ and the bride he is the second adam the church is the second eve hallelujah and adam was given a bride for what purpose for adam to reproduce himself on earth again and christ is given a bride for what purpose for him to reproduce himself on earth again i wrote this down if you've got a pen and paper and taken notes you might just want to drop these couple things down this is just something that meant something to me man it might not mean anything to you but it meant something to me brother branham says in the quote at a feast of the trumpets from 1964 he says now how will the messiah the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know amen now lock that down because that's a reality you can't just take what the preacher says on sunday and on wednesday that is not enough you could be totally deceived by that and not know it how will the people that believe him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is that's a key statement unless you're constantly in the word to know what he is the why daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now how he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen so who are you married to jesus christ but sometimes when we say jesus christ there's an image that flashes in our head of a man and that is jesus christ that's the body that he lived in that's a reality but brother branham's wanting us to catch another picture a deeper revelation of a greater truth amen back to the words of the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word so who's your husband jesus christ who's jesus christ the revealed word you're marrying the revealed word you're in an invisible union with the revealed word amen the union today is between you in the revealed word that's why you can want jesus the man from galilee all you want amen but if you refuse him the revealed word you can't marry him unless you transport back two thousand years and bow at his feet and claiming as your savior you can't do that you've got to accept him in whatever form he's in today and today our husband our mate is the revealed word but brother branham tells us that the bride is the predestinated word is that true how many believe you're the predestinated word for the sound so the revealed word comes together with the predestinated word word comes to word life comes to life seed comes to seed so the revealed word comes to the predestinated word to what to bring a conception and what will they produce the manifested word so the revealed word comes to the predestinated word and only to the predestinated word and that's the bride the revealed word comes the predestinated word to bring forth the manifested word you can't the egg won't hatch unless it's been with the mail it can be right hand the right hand the hen is right the hint is correct she's producing eggs all the time there's no life inside of him unless she's been with the male but when she comes together with the male then that little egg will hatch and what will you get you'll get something else that looks like its father and this bride can be the predestinated word the predestinated word the predestinated word but until she's been with the male the revealed word there's never going to be a manifested word but when the when when when the predestinated word meets her husband the revealed word her mate and the revealed word and the predestinated word come together then you're going to have a manifestation of that union then you're going to have the manifestation manifestation of the word for this hour praise be to god let's turn to matthew chapter one i just want to end with a thought as we wind down i say words like that to encourage your heart to wake you up straighten up get the bible get excited because he said wind down wrap up that gives me another 15 20 minutes god bless you we started off talking about this i don't know a week or two ago in revelation uh sorry matthew chapter one in matthew chapter one the beginning of the new testament the beginning of the new testament starts off with the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham we know that that includes two covenants the davidic covenant and the abrahamic covenant so it says abraham begot isaac isaiah begot jacob jacob begot judas and his brethren and judas begot pharas and zara of tamar so we're looking at this right at the opening of the new testament now the old testament closes out with behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to the fathers so it ends the last two verses in the old testament ends with a prophecy predicting elijah coming to the bride the end time prophet so the end of the old testament has an end time prophet has god and has the bride behold i send you elijah the prophet and then the new testament opens up and it opens up with the generation of jesus christ and when you look at the generation of jesus christ it's going like every generation does male to male father to son father to son until it hits four women in this genealogy and these four women are tamar first so in verse three judas begot pharas and zero of tamar and pharaohs begot ezram and ezra and begot abraham and aram begot aminadab and amin ada begot niacin and nayasan begot solomon and solomon got boaz of rahab number two where he have the harlot and boazby got obed of ruth ruth to moabitus and obama begot jesse and jesse begot david the king and david that came begot solomon of her that had been wife of uriah bathsheba number four and solomon begot rehoboam and rehoboam began ebia and abia begat esa and it goes all the way through all the way down to verse 17 going through the genealogies so we find that the new testament opens up with a mystery and there's a mystery in laid right from the beginning in the generations of jesus christ and that mystery is a mystery of four women one two three four tamar rahab ruth and bathsheba now i just want to leave a thought with you i won't have time to get into everything that i wanted to lay down but i just want to i want to show that these women didn't always have a good reputation they didn't always come through a clean life there was some things with all four of them that was a it was a bit of a mystery a bit of a hard pill to swallow we know the life of tamar tamar married judah's oldest son er amen and judas was wicked and god despised him and god killed him so then she was given to the second son i think onan was his name and ona was to raise up seed for for his brother but he didn't want to do that so he refused to give her seed and then she was sent back to her father's house and judah said when my third son is older amen i'll give him to you you to him the wife to raise up seed for the dead amen but then when he was older she saw that he was she was not given to him when he was grown and she heard that judah had come down amen to come down to near her town and she went up there and played the part of a harlot when she played the part of a harlot judah come into her and she conceived and she bear twins what's the story telling us there's only one purpose there's only one thought of god there's there's only one thing god's trying to accomplish in all of this i don't want to dwell on that i want to get to that later but but then you come to rehab rahab is a harlot rahab is knowing all kinds of different men amen and no no no number of how many men that she had known and and she she comes to a place where she desires the god that she's hearing about she she tells the two spies that come in i have heard of what your god did everybody here trembles in fears we know what he's done amen and she's given a true token amen so each one of these women are representing redemption in one way or another she's given a true token and we realize that that we find out later in the bible that she marries solomon after she saved and the destruction of jericho she marries solomon and after she marries solomon and then she produces boaz boaz didn't have any problem taking ruth he was the product of solomon and rahab the harlot that didn't bother him a bit he saw in her righteousness and then you come to ruth and ruth is a moabitess and we have a man leaving the land with his wife and his two sons and the two sons marry women when they're in moab and they come back and the one refuses orpha refuses and and ruth comes along and we find out ruth is working and all the things that transpire but ruth amen has a righteous desire amen to give herself amen so that there can be redemption claims for naomi and so boaz takes her she has a child amen we know that child is obed and obedient begets jesse and jessica gets david and then david at a time when kings go to war and david sends off his army sends all his troops stay home amen and he gets tempted by bathsheba and he calls for and they have an adulterous relationship she becomes pregnant he has uriah these are not clean stories these are not pleasant stories these are not the things that make the children's books these aren't the things you teach to your toddlers in detail but what's happening these this is the generation of jesus christ these women are predestinated ordained women to be in this line amen you believe that god orchestrates everything everything's ordained nothing's out of killer these were predestinated vessels to be placed in the position they were in but i looked at this and as i was reading through this something struck me tamar has a husband er god kills him no children no conception onan refuses next one refuses she doesn't have conception until she goes back to the original seed given she has to go through four stages of redemption justification sanctification baptism holy ghost to get to the baptism to the holy ghost himself she goes through the three stages of growth stalk tassel shuck to get back to the seat again she goes through lion ox man and eagle to come to the four stage what's the fourth stage back to the seed the original seed giver himself which is judah she married the firstborn the promise of the firstborn should have come through her womb the birthright should have come through a room the genealogy of jesus christ should have come through a room but he was wicked god killed him own and refused god killed him the second one was refused her so the only way that she could stay in her predestinated position was to go back to the original giver of seed himself do you see your story and then at the appointed time in the appointed place while she's playing the part of a harlot she's playing the part of a harlot and deceiving her father-in-law into giving her seed that's when god brings forth his appointed purpose that was in his mind all along how can this be right it's god look at rahab rahab is a harlot a harlot who's been with how many men no children no conception how can there be no conception because that's a predestinated wound that's a predestinated room reserved to bring forth the firstborn birthright in the line of the genealogy of christ it's almost as if when she comes to union with solomon now because the birthright's coming through solomon now as she comes into union with solomon it's almost as if god doesn't care about her past life it's almost as if god doesn't care how many men she slept with how many false doctrines she believes how many denominational churches she'd been in how many wrong ideas she's had and she's all of a sudden she's come to the time where now she's joined with the one and the right line and the genealogy of jesus christ was solomon in the birthright she's been pre-destinated for that position why was it she had a hungering in her heart when she heard about the red sea opening when she heard about the destruction of beijan and all her heart stirred within her everybody else trembled but she was getting excited what was it she's moving into her predestinated position amen when the two spies come when the witnesses come to her and begin to tell her the message she receives it amen she hides them and sends them out another way and she's given a true token for her and whoever will believe her and come under that token but there's no conception until the predestinated time and the predestinated place think about ruth ruth the moabitess she was married into the right line she was married into judah but they were outside the promised land they were outside the homeland and she's the predestinated vessel she's married to a man amen in judah but god takes the life of that man and her and naomi come back amen and she cannot conceive although it's her purpose it's her position amen she is the predestinated womb to bring forth the giant the furtherance of the genealogy of christ but until she gets to the right place and she gets in the right line which is boaz nothing's going to happen no conception you look at bathsheba bathsheba was married to uriah married living as married people no conception what's happening she has a predestinated position there is a predestinated womb right there to bring forth christ to bring forth solomon amen and all that happens amen i mean david does wicked david does wrong amen and he has he takes her to himself before the appointed time he has uriah killed and when ryan is dead he takes her and he marries her and then the first child that came through that relationship god took it died but he went into her again and he conceived and she brought forth what at the appointed time in the appointed place with a predestinated wound in an unlikely position and an unlikely person brings forth what brings forth solomon a type of jesus christ and you look at this and you begin to realize there's a chance for me i've believed wrong things i've been in wrong places i've been in denominations i've believed wrong things i've even been in this message and believed the wrong things i believe the wrong i believe the untrue amen i've been in the wrong spot in the wrong place in the wrong time but there's a predestinated womb in my soul and there's a place for this seed to come forth into life amen and it doesn't matter how many twists and how many turn and how many things go awry he's showing right here at the very beginning of the new testament that it doesn't matter the past life it doesn't matter which way you've come but there's only one thing that matters and that's the predestinated plan of god and when that right womb that predestinated vessel comes in contact with the right lineage then there's a conception where there was no conception before no babies to rahab no matter how many men she sleeps with no babies to ruth no matter how long she was married to her husband no baby's the bathsheba no matter how long she was married to uriah no baby for tamar why is the predestinated plan of god brother brahm says in the invisible union of the bride of christ you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god not because you've never made a mistake not because you have because you're a predestinated womb every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect how could bathsheba bring forth solomon amen because she was predestinated to bring forth solomon there's nothing going to stop god's predestinated plan bathsheba sin david's sin nobody else's sin is going to stop the predestinated plan again of god neither is your mistakes or your sins or your affairs going to stop the predestinated plan of god further in the invisible union says you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place don't god even know god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was you're just as predestinated as jesus christ both have come from the bosom of the father both have come from the mind of god both have been placed in your position in your time for a certain manifestation to portray this one goal that he had in his mind and nothing is going to stop that one goal that's why you come into the new testament you start reading right here these four women amen they bring you through the church ages through the first four seals because the first four seals are the church ages bringing you through the lion anointing the ox anointing the man anointing then to the eagle anointing and four is the number of deliverance amen so bring you right here and show you the church ages right here in the first six verses seven verses of the new testament so that we can see ourselves laying right here brother ben said and christ is the mystery of god revealed you can't commit adultery me too brother i can't commit adultery you're already pregnant glory he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no world can get in oh oh how we'd like to stay on this for about an hour i'm sure you understand not one of these women amen there's no record in the bible one of these women after they had come into their predestinated plan and they had received the right seed from the right lens from the right sword to bring forth christ they never went back to their old lifestyles again never harlotry never adultery never the old lifestyle never running back to moab never going back to uriah the hittite but staying right where they were because they can no longer commit adultery they've already conceived amen they've already been brought into their predestinated plan praise god amen it says oh that seed has come to life no world can get in oh how we'd like to stay on this for about an hour i'm sure you understand christ and his alone already finished the seed was there the seed was all ready when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us into eternal life that seed that was laying down in you that came to life when the word came to the word amen and sprung to life it was put there before the foundation of the world it wasn't there it didn't come in when you come to the altar amen it was there it was the thing driving you to the altar hallelujah it was the thing that god was pulling on i mean he wasn't pulling on your emotions he was pulling in that seed that's on the inside pulling himself back to himself again but before the foundation of the world has predestinated us into eternal life and as soon as the life forgiving flow that seed laying there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it like but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seed was drove out see like that amen amen how can he say you're the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ when we know our past when we know what we've believed and how we've acted and how we've made mockery of the things of god and how we knew better and did wrong anyways and how we had premeditated sin in our life and all of these other things how we know that but now he says you're the sinless spotless amen and we believed false doctrine and we believed trinitarian and we had taken trinitarian baptisms and we had done all of these other things how can we be the sinless spotless bride of jesus christ i'll tell you how none of those seeds took hold [Applause] trinitarian didn't take hold amen and then false doctrine didn't take hold wrong ideas it never took hold the only thing that could took a hold is something that's the same species amen only the same species no hybridization can bring forth life and if that life and the inside of your soul is hybrid you can come to life through hybrid seed but if it's not hybrid seed if it come from the original source if it come from god and it's laying in the soul when that original seed hits it again it doesn't matter how many seeds have been trying to flush over and how many seeds have been trying to impregnate there could be no impregnation until the original seed comes in and the original seed is the same species and you can't reproduce hybridization it's got to be the same species [Applause] cat seed can never impregnate a dog [Applause] cow seed can never impregnate a deer it's got to be the same seed no matter what we've been through no matter where we've been there's a predestinated wound there there's a predestinated seed laying there and no matter what was trying to flush through what was trying to bring forth life nothing happened nothing happened nothing happened nothing happened amen married to this and married to that and living in adultery living a heartless life nothing was taking place nothing was taking place but then you come in contact with the original seed giver again you've come back amen to the holy ghost himself and then when he comes in all of a sudden it's the original seed striking the original seed and the two come together and there's conception and now christ is coming forth that's why these women there's no record of any babies they have she cries out for her father and her mother and her family but not for her children tamar no record of children ruth no record of children but bathsheba no record of children because it was the wrong source that's why the wrong source oh it tried to find its way in come into the womb of your mind and tried to pollute your mind with all kinds of ideas but there was another womb of that soul and then there laid the original seed and nothing could take hold to that original word come back and the original word on the original seed brought it to life then quickly all other seeds were flushed out the wound was sealed and now you cannot commit adultery why by the revelation of the word we know the truth we know now none of these women go backwards they stay in the generation of jesus christ brother says in the spoken word is the original seed and when this bride comes she'll be the same product that he is virgin you mean living the way i lived he's not talking natural he's talking spiritual did christ belong to a denomination to jehovah neither does his bride she is part of him she needs no dogma she won't have any shall be absolutely virgin how by the word amen she'll punctuate every word of god say with amen amen oh be it unto me according to thy word amen oh my there you are punctuate god's word have a virgin womb what will she come out of a virgin womb the word she'll have a virgin womb how will she have a virgin womb because she'll be birthed out of a virgin womb which is the word what were you birthed by trinitarian baptism no that didn't birth you were you birthed amen under sectarianism were you birthed under the baptist were you birth no the only way you can have a virgin womb is to be birthed by the word and if you're birthed by the word then you're birthed with the virgin womb and now you receive the word and the word comes forth from a virgin womb not physical spiritual having a virgin womb what will she come out of a virgin womb the word what did jesus come out of a virgin womb see and when adam come to his wife she was pregnant she had done something she was mixed she was hybrid the child and it died but when joseph come to his bride she was pregnanted but with life adam's wife or adam's bride before they came together just like joseph and mary just like christ in the church now don't you see it and before they came together adam and eve she was pregnanted with corrupt seed from the serpent and when adam came to his wife he found her impregnated to death see death how spiritually and physically dead but when joseph the human came to his wife glory can't hardly hold her she was pregnanted with life the word of god flesh in her womb bring back that spoken word bring back that word of god which was word there came through a human's womb amen god will do it anyhow he's spoken and it's got to be so amen there's a predestinated womb and in that womb is a predestinated seed and only in god's appointed time in god's appointed place when you meet the male your mate the revealed word that's your predestinated position that's what you had the part you had to play in the mind of god before the foundation of the world was to bring forth christ in this generation and the only way you could do it is to come into this life and wait and wait and wait for your mate the revealed word and when that comes in the revealed word to the predestinated word now you have manifested word manifested where in the flesh of the bride aren't you happy that you're a typologist aren't you happy you can read the first six verse seven six verses in the new testament and see yourself right there i've been wrong i've done wrong i've traveled wrong rows but it wasn't any of that that mattered anymore what changed every one of these women what changed their future we know their past what changed their future when they came into a correct union with the correct seed giver everything in their life changed and now according to the new testament nothing in the old the old matters anymore it doesn't matter anymore now what matters is at the right time they came into the right union with the right seed giver and they brought forth the right seed and that changes the narration of the bible i'm thankful i'm a typologist and i can see myself in the word how many saw yourself today let's all stand musicians if you could come so much more but we'll get into that wednesday just be praying i'd like to look at the life of each one of these four women in these first six verses because i think we can see the story of redemption in each one of them god bless you
