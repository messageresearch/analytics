[5:24] oh lord praise
[5:29] you
[5:32] praise the lord man if you could turn in
[5:34] your bibles to revelation chapter 21 i'd
[5:38] like to read
[5:39] the first 11 verses of revelations 21.
[5:42] we're grateful that we could be here
[5:44] we're just coming in
[5:46] just barely made it to service and we
[5:49] took the last couple weeks off just
[5:52] trying to enjoy
[5:53] a little bit of a vacation because we
[5:56] have followed the leading of the lord to
[5:58] start a church from scratch
[5:59] in phoenix arizona and we leave here we
[6:02] might just drive
[6:04] straight through and get in tonight and
[6:05] tomorrow morning we start packing boxes
[6:08] and lord willing labor day weekend will
[6:10] be holding our first service
[6:12] at uh arizona believer's church in
[6:14] phoenix arizona
[6:15] and so we covet your prayers and brother
[6:18] paula fontaine told me it was a really
[6:20] uh
[6:21] or maybe it was uh actually his brother
[6:23] brandon senecola said it really was a
[6:25] cheap trick to try to
[6:26] go to the pastor's retreat whenever they
[6:28] have them just start your own church
[6:30] but uh that's not the reason but we are
[6:33] uh
[6:34] we're believer following the leading of
[6:36] the lord we've seen the hand of god in
[6:37] doing it and i mention it to you just
[6:39] ask for your prayers
[6:40] because you as an assembly have been
[6:42] very supportive of my wife and i have
[6:44] been very encouraging and
[6:45] uh we consider many of you just just as
[6:48] a church we just consider to be family
[6:50] and so you know that there is a body
[6:52] that is working
[6:54] to bring to pass every promise of god to
[6:57] be made manifest in the bride
[6:59] in phoenix arizona we we're just we're
[7:01] looking for that last soul
[7:03] uh and we believe that in this this end
[7:06] time evangelism is the shaping of the
[7:08] stone
[7:09] so we're not expecting it to be a
[7:11] harvest like the world would look for
[7:14] but i believe it's going to be a hundred
[7:15] fold it's gonna be a hundred percent
[7:18] it's gonna bring forth whatever god has
[7:19] ordained for it to bring forth
[7:21] and so we covet your prayers in
[7:23] following the leadership of the lord and
[7:24] doing that
[7:25] revelation chapter 21 also i want
[7:28] brother danny ratliff asked us
[7:30] uh wanted to send greetings to you
[7:31] brother chad and also to the church here
[7:34] at pastors bible tabernacle in ann arbor
[7:36] area he wanted to send
[7:37] his greetings to you revelations chapter
[7:39] 21 verses 1 to 11
[7:42] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[7:44] for the first heaven and the first earth
[7:46] were passed away
[7:47] and there was no more seed and
[7:50] there's in the past in a way it's
[7:55] there's a lot of rich meaning that's
[7:56] being implied there because we know that
[7:58] the heavens and the earth are an
[7:59] original spoken word attribute of god
[8:02] therefore it has an eternal quality but
[8:04] yet there's a transformation that takes
[8:06] place
[8:07] and i john saw the holy city new
[8:11] jerusalem
[8:12] coming down from god out of heaven
[8:15] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[8:16] husband
[8:17] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[8:19] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[8:21] with men
[8:22] and he will dwell with them and they
[8:24] shall be his people and god himself
[8:26] shall be with them and be their god
[8:28] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[8:30] their eyes and there shall be no more
[8:32] death neither sorrow nor crying
[8:34] neither shall be any more pain for the
[8:37] former things are passed away
[8:39] and he that sat upon the throne said
[8:41] behold i make all things
[8:42] new and he said unto me write for these
[8:45] words are true
[8:46] and faithful and he said unto me it is
[8:49] done
[8:49] i am alpha and omega the beginning
[8:53] and the end so there's a beginning and
[8:56] an end i will give
[8:57] unto him that is a thirst of the
[8:58] fountain of water of life freely
[9:00] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[9:02] things and i will be his god and he
[9:04] shall be my son
[9:05] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[9:07] abominable and murderers and
[9:08] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[9:10] and all liars shall have their part in
[9:11] the lake which burneth with fire and
[9:13] brimstone
[9:14] which is the second death and there came
[9:16] unto me one of the seven angels which
[9:18] had the seven vials full of the seven
[9:20] last plagues and talked with me saying
[9:21] come hither
[9:22] i show thee the bride the lamb's wife
[9:26] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[9:28] a great and high mountain
[9:30] and showed me that great city the holy
[9:32] jerusalem
[9:33] descending out of heaven from god having
[9:35] the glory of god
[9:37] and her light was likened to stone most
[9:39] precious
[9:40] even like a jasper stone clear as
[9:42] crystal
[9:43] if we could bow our heads in a word of
[9:45] prayer our heavenly father
[9:47] lord it's just so thrilling to read the
[9:49] bible and to see jesus christ in every
[9:52] verse and to
[9:53] know that it was your very breath that
[9:55] wrote these words
[9:56] it's been your very presence that's
[9:57] washed out over it preserved it that we
[9:59] could even
[10:00] open a book lord and read it and believe
[10:02] and have confidence that
[10:04] despite the translations and despite the
[10:06] different turns and paths that even this
[10:09] uh these writers and these translators
[10:11] took we believe that you have
[10:12] been able to hide yourself within these
[10:15] words
[10:16] lord we're thankful for a prophet to
[10:17] come and to restore us back to the bible
[10:19] to believe the bible to take you at your
[10:21] word
[10:22] and to anchor ourselves in the scripture
[10:24] so fathers we have read this and it's
[10:26] from your mind and from your heart we
[10:28] pray that you'd bless it may be made
[10:30] alive to us by revelation today
[10:32] and bless your people for their
[10:33] faithfulness for their attentiveness for
[10:35] their
[10:35] anticipation for the word and even their
[10:37] ability to pull upon the gift
[10:39] and lord may we have just an endurance
[10:41] today and a ready mind to receive from
[10:43] you
[10:44] we ask this in the name of the lord
[10:45] jesus christ amen
[10:47] you can be seated
[10:54] i'm very grateful for the opportunity to
[10:56] minister today
[10:58] and i have struck my heart that this is
[11:01] my last service
[11:03] um in this time in my uh time of my
[11:06] ministry if
[11:07] someone call it evangelism or traveling
[11:09] and ministering and being sent out to
[11:11] minister
[11:12] and i felt the lord deal with my heart
[11:15] and i give this as a warning i just want
[11:17] to summarize 20 something years of
[11:19] ministry today
[11:22] but i there's things that have been in
[11:23] my heart that god just struck
[11:25] struck me with and impacted me with to
[11:27] kind of just if i could just deliver my
[11:29] burden
[11:29] as an evangelist i know i have a little
[11:32] bit of a different gift than maybe the
[11:33] traditional evangelist
[11:35] and the dynamic gifts that we see in the
[11:37] body of christ today
[11:39] but i feel something in my heart just
[11:40] express what has been the thrust of my
[11:43] god dealing with my heart in a
[11:45] particular way and god deals with
[11:46] different people in many different ways
[11:48] but if it's in the word we believe it
[11:50] and we accept it and as i was pondering
[11:52] that this week and just realizing this
[11:54] would be my last opportunity
[11:56] to minister out from my home church
[11:59] which is right now a
[12:00] hickory bible tabernacle with brother
[12:01] berry i
[12:03] realized that the first time i ever
[12:05] preached meetings and i was invited to
[12:07] preach more than just a sunday service
[12:09] it was right here in lima ohio so i'm
[12:11] very grateful
[12:12] to have that opportunity to come back
[12:15] and to minister
[12:16] and just complete this stage of my life
[12:19] and my ministry
[12:20] before we transition into the next step
[12:22] of starting a church
[12:24] and the my title today is the becoming
[12:28] god the becoming god and i'm drawing a
[12:31] lot from christ as the mystery god
[12:33] revealed and christ revealed in his own
[12:35] word
[12:36] and so if you're just looking for a
[12:37] pointer or just a little
[12:39] signal for something to listen to or to
[12:41] read uh those two sermons are always
[12:43] very good just to pour into
[12:45] and study and i believe christ is the
[12:47] mystery of god revealed it means a lot
[12:49] to us
[12:49] as the bride because uh when brother
[12:52] brown be
[12:53] is preaching that sermon we see that
[12:54] whatever silence was still on that
[12:56] seventh seal when brother branham
[12:58] preached it earlier that year
[13:00] it had begun to lift and had moved into
[13:02] that cycle where now
[13:04] this seventh seal is being made known
[13:06] very plainly to
[13:08] his elect and not everyone can see it
[13:10] but the elect
[13:11] sees it and so in revelations chapter 21
[13:14] again our title is the becoming god
[13:16] in revelations chapter 21 and i want to
[13:20] i thought in my heart that uh i want to
[13:22] take you guys at your word
[13:24] every time i preach you always tell me
[13:26] and i say always
[13:27] the people who tell me it's a lot of
[13:29] people tell me you stopped too soon you
[13:30] could have gone longer but the chad's
[13:32] told me
[13:32] preach as long as you want three hours
[13:34] is no problem so i thought finally
[13:36] since this is my last chance as an
[13:37] evangelist i want to do it
[13:39] and i mentioned that to my wife and she
[13:41] said oh no you can't do that brother
[13:43] chad said
[13:44] you can't do that it's too long people
[13:46] wearing masks they can't breathe
[13:48] and everything so i don't really know
[13:49] what to do except just obey the lord at
[13:51] this point
[13:53] but revelations chapter 21 expresses a
[13:56] symbolic picture
[13:57] we know there's particular aspects that
[13:59] may be literal but yet we know that it
[14:01] expresses a symbolic picture
[14:03] and this image that we read in
[14:04] revelations chapter 21 holds the mystery
[14:07] of the bride of christ
[14:08] and it's very remarkable um it's where
[14:11] it's placed in
[14:12] scripture here at the very end and
[14:14] revelation is a book
[14:16] of symbols and the symbol is a lot like
[14:18] a sign
[14:19] when i refer to a sign maybe even a
[14:20] traffic sign or a traffic light or a
[14:22] billboard or something a symbol
[14:24] is like a sign in that it points beyond
[14:26] itself to something else
[14:29] so if you see a symbol if revelation is
[14:31] a book of symbols
[14:32] we don't look to the symbol but we
[14:34] realize the symbol is pointing beyond
[14:36] itself
[14:37] to something else just like a sign is
[14:40] indicating something so it's pointing to
[14:42] something beyond itself
[14:44] just like a stop sign when you see a
[14:45] stop sign it points to the law
[14:47] a law that requires cars to stop in an
[14:50] orderly fashion
[14:52] at different intervals so that traffic
[14:54] uh can be safe or you could cross an
[14:56] intersection
[14:57] so the sign itself is pointing to a law
[14:59] the sign itself is pointing
[15:01] to an order it's pointing to an interval
[15:03] of cars stopping and starting again
[15:06] and it's important to understand that
[15:09] concept to assemble but also to a sign
[15:12] when god gives a sign so that a sign of
[15:15] something is not pointing to itself but
[15:17] rather it points beyond itself to
[15:19] something else
[15:20] so when we saw the sign of the son of
[15:22] man or you saw the sign of discernment
[15:25] it's not pointing to itself but it's big
[15:27] you got it it goes beyond itself it's
[15:30] pointing to something else
[15:31] so the sign of the son of man could be
[15:33] given uh for a number of years but what
[15:36] it's pointing to is something beyond
[15:38] itself
[15:38] and that's when the son of man himself
[15:40] comes and makes himself manifest
[15:43] in revelations chapter 21 verse 2 he's
[15:46] john writing and expressing in himself
[15:49] what he saw
[15:50] and he says and i john saw the holy
[15:54] city new jerusalem and i believe brother
[15:56] lonnie jenkins
[15:58] said it many many years ago and it
[16:00] really stuck out to me
[16:01] that the bride sees what john sees
[16:05] she hears what john hears once you've
[16:07] come up into revelations chapter 5 we
[16:09] see and hear
[16:09] what john sees and hears it says i john
[16:12] saw the holy city
[16:14] new jerusalem coming down from god so
[16:17] it's something that's
[16:17] ushering forth from god out of heaven
[16:21] so it's not just coming out of heaven
[16:23] it's coming down
[16:24] from god out of heaven and as he's
[16:26] beholding
[16:27] the city and he sees this come down out
[16:30] of god out of heaven
[16:31] john is struck to say as a bride adorned
[16:34] for her husband
[16:36] so what the inspiration that john
[16:38] receives when he sees a city
[16:40] is this is like a wife this is a bride
[16:42] prepared and dressed
[16:43] for her husband and as this inspiration
[16:46] strikes him and he describes the city
[16:48] and this or he just
[16:50] describes the city in this manner as a
[16:52] bride adorned for her husband
[16:53] verse 3 says and i heard a great voice
[16:55] out of head saying behold
[16:57] the tabernacle of god is with men and he
[17:00] will dwell with them and they shall be
[17:01] his people and god himself shall be with
[17:03] them
[17:04] and be their god and there's an aspect
[17:07] to this
[17:07] declaration and this unction which is
[17:09] descriptive of the gentile bride
[17:12] because in hosea chapter 2 verse 23 he
[17:14] says i will sow her
[17:16] unto me in the earth so god is going to
[17:19] sow
[17:20] as a seed a woman i'm going to sow her
[17:23] in the earth her seed is already in the
[17:25] earth she's laying there
[17:26] in the earth and says for me for my
[17:28] purpose for what i desire
[17:29] i will sow her unto me in the earth and
[17:32] this is an important principle i
[17:33] hope that you can grab a hold of and
[17:35] catch and maintain through the remainder
[17:37] of the service
[17:38] god is saying i will sow a woman i will
[17:41] sow her for me for my benefit for my
[17:43] purpose
[17:44] she will be sown into the earth and he
[17:46] says and i will have mercy upon her
[17:48] that had not obtained mercy and i will
[17:50] say to them which were not my people
[17:53] because this is the perception of the
[17:55] jews this is the perception of israel
[17:56] that if you are not
[17:57] from the father father abraham then
[17:59] you're a heathen you're a reprobate
[18:01] you're a gentile you're outside the
[18:02] promises god does not have mercy upon
[18:04] you he has judgment
[18:06] you are not his people we are the people
[18:08] of abraham
[18:09] isaac and jacob and we are the people of
[18:11] the god of abraham the god of
[18:13] isaac and the god of jacob and they had
[18:15] that type of relationship
[18:17] and anyone outside of that natural
[18:18] lineages would not were not the people
[18:20] of god
[18:21] but yet god is declaring that you will
[18:24] be my people those who were seemingly
[18:26] weren't
[18:26] you will by be my people thou art my
[18:29] people and they shall say
[18:31] thou art my god so he will say to you
[18:33] you
[18:34] are my people even though you were not
[18:36] seen as my people perceived as my people
[18:38] could have never been imagined to be my
[18:40] people
[18:40] i will say you have been my people all
[18:42] along and then there's this
[18:44] unction in this response back thou art
[18:46] my god
[18:47] so as he says that the tabernacle of god
[18:49] will be with men and god shall be with
[18:51] them and they shall be their god
[18:53] there is a reflection of the gentile
[18:55] bride which is sown into the earth
[18:57] for the per for god's purpose for him
[18:59] himself
[19:00] now this is john's reaction and the
[19:03] voice that speaks from heaven
[19:04] when he sees the holy city the new
[19:07] jerusalem
[19:08] coming out from god he says this is like
[19:11] a bride adorned for her husband
[19:13] then in verse 9 the angel this
[19:16] vile angel speaks and says come hither i
[19:19] will show thee
[19:20] the bride the lamb's wife so there's
[19:23] union that's taking place it's
[19:24] this is a wife not a girlfriend not
[19:26] someone a spouse he says i'm going to
[19:28] show you the bride the lamb's wife
[19:30] so when john sees the city he's struck
[19:32] with the inspiration this is a bride
[19:34] prepared for her husband
[19:36] now he's actually going to be shown a
[19:37] bride he's going to be shown a wife
[19:39] he says and he carried me away in the
[19:40] spirit to a great and high mountain
[19:43] so this is a great and high mountain
[19:45] when you think of a high mountain
[19:47] i think of brother branham saying that
[19:48] there's these three these three
[19:50] showdowns
[19:50] there was a mount carmel showdown a
[19:52] mount transfiguration slowdown
[19:54] and then a mount zion showdown and in
[19:56] each showdown it happened at the top
[19:58] mount carmel was at the top mount
[20:00] transfiguration was at the top
[20:01] and so now mount zion's climax and her
[20:04] showdown takes place
[20:05] at the top paul brought the church to
[20:07] mount zion at its base and at the very
[20:09] beginning of it
[20:10] but now in this hour when brother
[20:12] branham comes preaching the same gospel
[20:14] paul preached
[20:15] it's not a foundation message it's a
[20:16] capstone message at the very top
[20:19] so he's carried to a great and high
[20:21] mountain at the very top the very
[20:22] pinnacle
[20:23] it says and he showed me that great city
[20:26] the holy jerusalem
[20:27] descending out of heaven from god now
[20:30] john is going to be shown a wife and he
[20:33] sees the city
[20:34] when he saw the city he thought of a
[20:35] wife so now these themes are being
[20:37] married together
[20:39] to where this holy city the new
[20:40] jerusalem is in fact
[20:42] the lamb's wife it is the bride of
[20:45] christ or the
[20:46] god's bride because he describes the
[20:48] great city the holy jerusalem which
[20:50] he's not been there's not been a trick
[20:51] played on him i'm going to show you the
[20:52] lamb's wife
[20:53] and he sees a city but it's a symbol
[20:57] we know there'll be a city but it's also
[20:59] a symbol here it's representative of
[21:00] something
[21:01] he says descending out of heaven from
[21:02] god having the glory of god
[21:06] and what does paul teach us that the
[21:07] woman is the glory of the man first
[21:10] corinthians 11
[21:10] 7 the woman is the glory of the man
[21:14] so when the city descends it's the
[21:16] lamb's wife and she comes forth
[21:18] and she has the glory of god because she
[21:21] is the wife of god
[21:23] therefore the woman is the glory of the
[21:25] man and we can say that if
[21:27] the man is the glory of god the son of
[21:29] man is the glory of god and the bride is
[21:31] the glory of the son of man
[21:33] we see these themes repeating themselves
[21:35] in the message so she has the glory of
[21:37] god says and her light was like unto a
[21:39] stone most precious
[21:40] even like a jasper stone clearest
[21:42] crystal and that's representative of her
[21:45] having the mind of christ
[21:46] and having a clear understanding which
[21:48] is the evidence of the holy ghost
[21:50] she has this purity of thought purity of
[21:52] mind she has the mind of christ she has
[21:55] the glory of god and her light her
[21:56] understanding her revelation
[21:58] is pure and crystal clear
[22:02] and so these symbols of revelation is
[22:04] speaking of
[22:05] which speak of the new jerusalem the
[22:07] holy city are pointing to the bride
[22:09] and the bride is revealing the mystery
[22:11] of christ
[22:13] brother branham teaches this in choosing
[22:15] of a bride he says now we
[22:16] here see plainly the spiritual plan
[22:19] of god's planning for his future home
[22:22] with
[22:23] his future bride it comes into view now
[22:26] so it's god's plan
[22:27] for his future home and his future bride
[22:30] so it's god's bride it's his future home
[22:33] with his future bride
[22:34] he's saying we see plainly the spiritual
[22:36] plan it's coming into view
[22:38] and he says if a man marries a sex queen
[22:40] you see what he's looking for for the
[22:42] future
[22:44] so in this we see god's planning for his
[22:47] future home
[22:48] with this future bride and brother brad
[22:50] i'm saying if you see a man that marries
[22:52] a woman who's of a particular
[22:54] disposition or particular character he's
[22:56] saying you see
[22:57] what he's looking for for the future
[23:00] so a man at the moment that he chooses a
[23:03] wife
[23:03] even if it hasn't been expressed or it's
[23:06] unknown
[23:07] the man's hidden character is revealed
[23:09] in his wife
[23:10] something having not yet been manifested
[23:12] something not yet seen
[23:14] when a man chooses a woman you don't
[23:16] have to know his future
[23:18] you can just look at his wife and see
[23:20] what he's planning
[23:22] regardless of how he's lived and what
[23:23] he's done the woman that a man chooses
[23:25] speaks of what he's looking for in the
[23:27] future
[23:28] so the wife holds the mystery of a man's
[23:30] future home
[23:32] and therefore the bride herself holds
[23:34] the mystery
[23:35] of the future home and that is why the
[23:37] bride the lamb's wife
[23:39] is the first manifestation of the holy
[23:41] city the new jerusalem
[23:44] the future home of a man is first seen
[23:46] in the woman that he chooses to marry
[23:48] so it hides but then it also manifests
[23:50] and reveals the future
[23:52] he says again in choosing of ride it
[23:54] reflects
[23:55] when a man chooses a woman he says it
[23:57] shows what he has in his mind
[23:59] of what his future home is going to be i
[24:02] just think about
[24:02] as a mess a student of the message how
[24:04] these things connect together
[24:06] he says it shows what he has in his mind
[24:07] of what his future home is going to be
[24:09] he says again it reflects what's in the
[24:11] man a man that takes a woman like that
[24:13] shows just what he's thinking of the
[24:16] future
[24:17] again he says that reflects his own
[24:18] godly character
[24:20] and reflects what's in his mind and
[24:22] what's going to be
[24:23] in the future isn't this beautiful so
[24:26] he's preaching
[24:26] choosing of a bride and he's using not
[24:29] the natural process
[24:30] to understand god's process choosing
[24:33] is the receiving choosing is a naming
[24:36] and even as it
[24:37] when god told samuel i'm going to i'm
[24:39] going to have a new king he says i want
[24:40] you to go to jesse's house
[24:42] and the one who my name is going to be
[24:44] the one that's going to be the king
[24:46] and so the naming is a choosing the
[24:48] naming isn't identifying it's a name
[24:51] being called
[24:51] brother is preaching the choosing of a
[24:54] bride why because the bridegroom was
[24:56] receiving a bride unto himself
[24:58] he was naming her he was choosing her
[25:01] and he's using this natural process of
[25:03] how a natural man
[25:04] would choose a woman and he's saying you
[25:06] may know nothing about the man how he
[25:08] likes his home to be kept where he wants
[25:09] to live and what he wants to do
[25:11] but as soon as he chooses a woman look
[25:13] at the woman because she reveals
[25:15] what the man's thinking she reveals
[25:17] what's in his heart
[25:18] she reveals what his future home is
[25:21] going to be
[25:22] so it reveals a man's character and it
[25:24] reveals the man's future
[25:26] it reveals things that are presently
[25:27] true about the man but it also reveals
[25:29] what the man is meditating and planning
[25:31] in his heart
[25:32] that's what the woman reflects in the
[25:34] natural and brother
[25:35] adam is saying this is so with god as he
[25:38] chooses a bride he is identifying and
[25:41] naming
[25:41] the holy city the habitation of god the
[25:44] new jerusalem
[25:45] and as she is made up and comes to be in
[25:48] flesh like you are today
[25:50] you are the habitation of god you are
[25:52] the tabernacle of god
[25:54] you are the very dwelling place of the
[25:56] almighty you are the ones who are the
[25:58] very ministry of the son of man
[26:00] you are the new jerusalem
[26:04] and it comes it comes into being now
[26:07] because
[26:08] you being chosen and being married to
[26:10] christ the union takes place here
[26:13] taking place now and i love it to know
[26:16] that all of us individually have that
[26:19] revelation
[26:20] that i don't have to stand here and and
[26:22] convince you by reading
[26:24] quotes that the union is now but i can
[26:26] preach what brother branham said
[26:28] say it the way he said it knowing that
[26:30] to those to whom he's ordained to marry
[26:33] those to whom
[26:33] he's ordained himself to unite with you
[26:36] will have a revelation of this
[26:38] union individually and that is what we
[26:41] desire as ministers is that you come
[26:43] into union
[26:43] and understand in revelation of this
[26:46] because it's the key for us to go home
[26:49] and so the principle that i want to
[26:51] establish as we go forward
[26:53] is a wife is the manifestation of the
[26:55] hidden thoughts of a man
[26:57] a wife is a is a manifestation of what's
[27:00] in a man's
[27:00] mind it's a reflection of his heart a
[27:03] bride
[27:04] reflects what's in the heart of a man
[27:05] reflects what he's thinking
[27:08] now that with that is a building block
[27:10] in the foundation what we see in
[27:12] revelations chapter 21
[27:14] is a completion of seeds that were sown
[27:17] in the book of genesis
[27:18] we know that genesis is the seed chapter
[27:20] brother brandon refers to it as
[27:22] and the picture in revelations chapter
[27:24] 21 is something that unfolds
[27:26] or develops over time and through a
[27:28] process and what
[27:30] john is seeing is he's seeing a finished
[27:32] product symbolically
[27:34] we can read it we said oh it's all
[27:35] finished it's in its splendor the bible
[27:37] is quickly
[27:38] going to be wrapped up in chapter 22 and
[27:40] this great scene is going to be
[27:41] described there's a great
[27:43] uh a call that goes out the spirit and
[27:45] the bride say come
[27:46] why because you've got to come into
[27:48] fellowship with this christ you've got
[27:49] to
[27:50] come in through and walk through these
[27:51] scriptures to come to the
[27:53] finality and the conclusion of this
[27:54] bible and so john is seeing a finished
[27:57] product
[27:58] but i want to just lay a few principles
[28:00] very quickly about how that
[28:01] what we see in revelation is actually
[28:03] the product of seeds that were sown in
[28:05] genesis
[28:07] and and there's ways that we can type it
[28:09] and we can begin to show the parallels
[28:11] between the
[28:11] book of genesis and the book of
[28:12] revelation but i want to be very
[28:14] specific and focused
[28:16] uh this morning with you
[28:19] and in a message brother branham who do
[28:22] you say this is
[28:23] he's speaking about the foolish virgin
[28:25] and and the woman eve
[28:27] he says notice the woman here represents
[28:29] the future denominational church called
[28:31] bride
[28:32] it all come up in genesis it's a seed
[28:34] you start in genesis you'll get your
[28:36] picture straight
[28:37] so it's remarkable he's identifying the
[28:39] fullest virgin and he's liking it to
[28:41] what eve reflected and manifested and
[28:43] said we see the seeds of it in genesis
[28:46] he says in another place babylon first
[28:48] appeared first in genesis
[28:50] he says it appears over here in the
[28:51] bible again about the middle of the old
[28:53] testament
[28:54] and then comes all over into revelation
[28:57] for the last days
[28:58] babylon so he says it appears in the
[29:00] beginning it comes back in the middle
[29:02] and it comes back at the end so it's
[29:04] sown it manifested in genesis
[29:06] and then you see it again in the in
[29:08] revelation
[29:09] but not only does the foolish virgin
[29:11] appear in genesis or babylon appear in
[29:13] genesis but the bride does
[29:16] now she may not be as clearly
[29:17] identifiable and evident
[29:19] as babylon or or the foolish virgin and
[29:22] those that would play that role
[29:24] but the bride is also hidden and sown in
[29:26] the book of genesis
[29:28] bill abraham says in genesis was the
[29:30] seed chapter where all seeds were sown
[29:32] everything you find in the world come
[29:34] out of genesis everything began back
[29:36] there in the beginning
[29:37] he says now we do have things today that
[29:39] are hybrid and perverted but
[29:40] we can go back to genesis to see where
[29:42] it was changed
[29:44] and then he uses again the example of
[29:46] babylon found in genesis and also found
[29:48] in revelation he says but you've got to
[29:49] go back
[29:51] to the beginning to start everything and
[29:54] this is a statement
[29:55] that's very uh profound to me it just
[29:57] strikes me says
[29:58] now if the faith that was once delivered
[30:01] to the saints
[30:02] we got to go plumb back to the beginning
[30:05] to get it to find out what we're going
[30:07] to talk about
[30:09] many when they think about the faith
[30:11] once delivered to the saints
[30:12] they go back to the first church and we
[30:15] can say the day of pentecost
[30:16] and listen the day of pentecost first
[30:18] church those are not terms of derision
[30:20] those are not derogatory terms those are
[30:22] not criticisms
[30:23] uh those those those things are to be
[30:25] revered and to help precious to our
[30:27] hearts
[30:28] and not use those words uh to kind of
[30:30] profane what has been
[30:32] listen if they weren't who they were you
[30:33] can't be who you were are
[30:36] there's no way in the world you can't
[30:37] profane pentecostaleodycia
[30:40] you'll profane the very thing you're
[30:41] standing upon not the
[30:43] nonsense it became after a number of
[30:45] years but the real genuine
[30:47] holy ghost that was poured out the
[30:48] messenger being the holy ghost itself
[30:50] the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:52] and those things being poured out in
[30:53] laodicea we're standing upon the
[30:55] shoulders
[30:56] of our pentecostal brethren who received
[30:58] the restoration of the gifts who
[30:59] received the baptismal goals and we're
[31:01] partakers of the same and so that when
[31:05] brother we think about the
[31:06] apostolic faith or the faith of our
[31:08] fathers the faith once delivered to the
[31:10] saints
[31:10] we don't just go back to the first
[31:12] church but we go all the way back to
[31:14] genesis
[31:16] he says you've got to go back to the
[31:17] beginning to find out what we're talking
[31:18] about it's the only way that you can
[31:20] fully make sense of what god's doing
[31:22] on the day of pentecost so genesis holds
[31:25] patterns for us it holds types and
[31:27] it foreshadows it forecasts and
[31:29] foreshadows things that are to take
[31:30] place
[31:31] and it's the very foundation and holds
[31:33] the seeds of what god is doing in
[31:35] creation
[31:37] in christ as the mystery of god revealed
[31:39] brother branham says
[31:40] just this statement he says the
[31:42] threefold purpose of god
[31:44] manifested in adam and eve
[31:47] and that to me is a very weighty
[31:48] statement the threefold purpose of god
[31:50] manifested in adam and eve there's other
[31:53] aspects that are manifested in the old
[31:54] testament you can see glimpses and
[31:56] different shadows and types
[31:57] to the different characters in the old
[31:58] testament and brother brahm talks about
[32:00] how moses and david and joseph
[32:02] um foreshadowed and typed the coming of
[32:05] a perfect bridegroom
[32:07] and so what you see in the old testament
[32:08] is just forecasting foreshadowing
[32:10] different glimpses different expressions
[32:13] and you can see and
[32:14] type what christ was going to be but
[32:16] then when the bridegroom comes and
[32:17] manifest himself
[32:18] then everything that was passed that
[32:20] pointed to him just stands out and is
[32:22] highlighted
[32:22] because they were all foreshadowing the
[32:24] coming of a perfect bridegroom
[32:27] he says this about adam and eve
[32:29] themselves the threefold purpose of god
[32:31] was
[32:31] manifested in adam and the woman he says
[32:34] god
[32:34] making himself known so god's purpose
[32:38] was hidden as a menace
[32:39] a mystery in the manifestation of adam
[32:42] and the woman
[32:43] there's the man and the woman standing
[32:45] there in the beginning in genesis
[32:46] chapter two
[32:47] and god is hiding something about
[32:49] himself and his plan
[32:50] in this image of adam and the woman
[32:53] billy branham and power of
[32:54] transformation says there was
[32:56] adam and eve walking in the garden of
[32:57] eden every seed bringing forth it never
[33:00] could do nothing else
[33:02] it never could do nothing else because
[33:03] god said let it be that way
[33:06] it had to be that way now as brother
[33:08] brahms describing this he has
[33:10] prophetic vision to see what was taking
[33:12] place then
[33:13] and he says adam and the woman he's
[33:15] given us maybe a glimpse into the
[33:17] silence between genesis 2 and genesis 3.
[33:19] because once we see this beautiful
[33:21] picture the man and the woman in the
[33:22] garden of eden the very next chapter
[33:24] is the serpent uh tempting the woman to
[33:27] fall
[33:28] and we don't see the time that they had
[33:31] spent together in the presence of god
[33:33] coming into the garden
[33:34] at which his presence was declared by a
[33:36] voice and so god's presence is declared
[33:39] by which the voice of god came walking
[33:41] in the garden so
[33:42] we can't just picture maybe a man with
[33:44] flesh and some nikes on coming for a
[33:46] morning jog with
[33:47] with adam but rather the voice of god
[33:49] declared the presence of god
[33:50] and adam knew god by his voice and it
[33:53] wonderful i repeats again in the last
[33:55] days that we know his presence
[33:56] by his voice and so as
[33:59] as it's brother rams see in this image
[34:02] he sees the man and the woman
[34:04] under a command the seed of god being
[34:06] sown
[34:07] god's saying be fruitful multiply
[34:09] replenish the earth
[34:10] each seed bringing forth of his kind he
[34:12] says oh my isn't this beautiful he's
[34:13] describing he sees it and he says oh
[34:15] how i'd like to stop here just a minute
[34:17] to say
[34:18] there is where we are facing yet the
[34:21] completion of that word
[34:24] so if you want to understand where the
[34:26] bride is today
[34:27] she is facing and she has passed with
[34:30] and she has been given a sacred charge
[34:32] to complete that word because that word
[34:36] was never finished by adam and the woman
[34:38] that word was never completed so brother
[34:40] adam's coming as a prophet in the end
[34:42] and say
[34:43] the potential of that the promise of
[34:44] that everything that they stood for and
[34:47] represented the bride now
[34:49] in the end will fulfill all that was
[34:51] promised to be made manifest in the
[34:52] virgin
[34:54] here we stand facing the fulfillment and
[34:56] the completion
[34:57] of the original not just restored back
[34:59] to the original but we are the
[35:00] completion
[35:02] and the climax and the finishing of the
[35:04] original
[35:06] you could give me maybe just a tiny bit
[35:08] more on the monitors up here
[35:09] this is what happens when you don't
[35:10] preach for a couple weeks you lose your
[35:12] voice
[35:14] now he says that god said
[35:18] as he describes it we're facing the
[35:19] completion of that word he says god said
[35:21] let it be he says and that's why it was
[35:23] the way that it was
[35:25] and let it be is drawing from even from
[35:27] genesis chapter 1 verse 11
[35:29] where it says in each seed bringing
[35:31] forth of its kind whose seed was in
[35:32] itself
[35:33] so each kind or each specie had a seed
[35:36] within itself
[35:37] and it brought forth itself by the seed
[35:40] that was in it
[35:41] so it was a duplicate here i am i i'm a
[35:45] wheat plant i have my seed in myself to
[35:47] bring forth a mirror image of me
[35:49] and that's how it would replicate and
[35:51] brother branham actually it was god who
[35:53] said
[35:54] the law of reproduction i believe he
[35:55] said pick up your pen and write this
[35:57] is god's law of reproduction so god
[35:59] himself says you want to know how i
[36:01] reproduce
[36:01] this is god's law of reproduction and so
[36:04] god
[36:05] establishes his principle of
[36:06] reproduction by seed
[36:09] and he's revealing something about
[36:11] himself
[36:13] he's revealing something about his
[36:14] purpose he's revealing something about
[36:16] even his desire
[36:17] it's god's law of reproduction to
[36:19] reproduce as a verb means to produce
[36:21] again a reproduction as a noun is an act
[36:24] an adjective noun
[36:25] is an act of forming again it's a
[36:28] generation
[36:29] and so if you have one with the seed in
[36:31] itself to reproduce
[36:32] is to brief is to bring out another one
[36:37] and so it's expressing something about
[36:39] god when he says this is my law of
[36:40] reproduction
[36:41] let each seed whose cities in itself
[36:43] produce a duplicate of the original
[36:46] by dna by design it and listen in god's
[36:48] original
[36:49] it would have been exactly the same
[36:52] if you did a dna test well this is grain
[36:54] of wheat number one
[36:55] and you did another dna test you say
[36:57] well this is grain of wheat number one
[36:59] which is which
[37:03] and so genesis chapter one i told you i
[37:06] was gonna
[37:07] cover i'm stressed
[37:10] it was at the end in case we don't get
[37:12] all the way to revelation but we'll
[37:13] start with genesis 1 and we'll see if we
[37:14] can get to at least habakkuk
[37:18] but genesis chapter 1 is the beginning
[37:20] of god becoming
[37:23] it isn't the finished picture but it's
[37:24] foreshadowing
[37:27] and as you ponder it god is wanting to
[37:30] tell the story of himself
[37:32] and help you to understand why you're
[37:34] even here
[37:36] and this is a god that is invisible
[37:38] without beginning or end
[37:40] and so you have to find a starting point
[37:44] to tell your story
[37:45] and god starts within the beginning
[37:48] and genesis even the this word that's
[37:50] used as latin it comes from the latin
[37:52] generation or nativity
[37:54] in the greek it means origin or creation
[37:56] or generation
[37:57] it comes from the word to be born and so
[38:01] in the very
[38:02] very book genesis it speaks of a
[38:03] generation of nativity
[38:05] something to be born it's related to the
[38:07] word genos which is
[38:08] race or birth or to beget with its root
[38:10] from gene
[38:11] which is your origin the source or seed
[38:13] or dna
[38:15] so genesis is the dna it's the seed
[38:18] we can go back to that and with the
[38:20] right kind of understanding the right
[38:22] kind of interpretation of the word which
[38:23] only god can give
[38:25] you can begin to see your fabric who you
[38:26] are your identity
[38:28] in genesis in genesis chapter 1
[38:32] verse 1 in the beginning god created
[38:35] the heaven and the earth in the
[38:38] beginning
[38:38] god he was before the beginning he did
[38:41] not have his
[38:42] beginning in the beginning but even
[38:43] before the beginning there was just god
[38:45] with nothing else that says and he
[38:46] created
[38:47] the heaven and the earth beginning it
[38:49] means the first the best the chief
[38:51] or the choice part in the very beginning
[38:54] this is when the time
[38:55] this is when a time when something
[38:57] begins the beginning of the time when
[38:58] something happens
[38:59] the act of starting something and it
[39:02] says the
[39:03] introduction is in the beginning god
[39:05] it's elohim
[39:06] it comes from a conjunction a combining
[39:09] of l which means strong one and allah
[39:10] which means
[39:11] bound by an oath so here's el allah
[39:14] the strong one bound by a promise bound
[39:17] by a covenant
[39:18] bound by an oath bound by a promise that
[39:20] he has made
[39:22] bound by a desire he's bound by the
[39:24] strong desire
[39:25] l allah it's elohim
[39:30] you know god was before the beginning
[39:33] and he's described as elohim one who
[39:36] exists by himself
[39:38] bibraham often repeats that phrase one
[39:40] who exists by himself
[39:42] then as he has begin to create and the
[39:44] bible says in genesis chapter 2 verse 4
[39:47] as he is created he says these are the
[39:49] generations of the heavens and of the
[39:51] earth
[39:52] when they were created in the day that
[39:54] the lord god
[39:55] made the earth and the heavens now
[39:58] before there was anything
[39:59] visible and there was just god elohim
[40:02] the strong one bound by an oath that he
[40:06] is referred to
[40:06] as god but now that there's things that
[40:09] have come to be
[40:10] he's called lord god and lord is jehovah
[40:14] elohim lord god jehovah elohim
[40:17] and jehovah it means the self-existence
[40:19] one but it comes from the word adonai
[40:22] coming from the hebrew hawa adonai
[40:25] adonahi
[40:26] coming from hawai and means to become
[40:29] he said well brother aaron man we've we
[40:31] haven't even gone back to school yet
[40:32] well
[40:34] class is in this is important to
[40:36] understand this a name
[40:38] means something a name reflects a man's
[40:40] character
[40:41] there's something to a name we realize
[40:43] that and so as he gives himself this
[40:46] designation from god to lord god
[40:48] his elohim now married with jehovah
[40:51] jehovah elohim
[40:52] jehovah coming from the root havah which
[40:54] means to become
[40:55] or to exist or become known hava means
[40:59] continually becoming
[41:00] so it's something that's becoming it's
[41:02] something that is existing
[41:03] so god has continually becoming god is
[41:06] unveiling himself he's the god who
[41:08] becomes
[41:09] he was elohim god but now he's jehovah
[41:11] god
[41:13] why because now there's something
[41:15] expressed
[41:16] and it's the invisible god who's now
[41:18] becoming so the becoming god
[41:21] is always unfolding he's the invisible
[41:24] one who reveals himself
[41:25] as he becomes when he was just
[41:29] god with no with no expression then he
[41:31] could not be made known
[41:33] so then god as he begins to create and
[41:36] creates a
[41:36] heavens and he creates an earth and he
[41:38] begins to lay these things out
[41:40] he is now becoming
[41:44] it's the becoming god and brother banham
[41:47] teaches this he says we know that the
[41:49] world is a creation
[41:50] and before there can be a creation there
[41:52] has to be a creator of that creation
[41:54] and this is the principle i want you to
[41:55] catch and this creator
[41:57] expresses himself in the creation
[42:01] it says god creating the creation is
[42:03] expressing himself
[42:04] back in the creation so god is
[42:07] expressing himself in the creation the
[42:09] creator
[42:10] expresses himself by the thing which he
[42:13] creates
[42:13] so if we can go back to genesis 1 and
[42:15] see god's original creation before satan
[42:18] stepped in and changed it
[42:20] we can see god reflecting himself
[42:24] god creating is expressing himself back
[42:27] in creation
[42:28] he says even if we didn't have a bible
[42:30] we would still know that
[42:33] so the bible just sets it in order why
[42:36] because romans 1 20 says the invisible
[42:38] things of him from the creation of the
[42:39] world
[42:40] are clearly seen being understood by the
[42:42] things that are made
[42:43] even as eternal power in godhead romans
[42:46] 1 20
[42:46] stands for this principle that the
[42:48] invisible things of god
[42:50] are from the creation the world are
[42:51] clearly seen being understood by the
[42:53] things that are made
[42:56] so if god is invisible he cannot be seen
[42:58] there is still an expression of him
[43:00] in creation so in the beginning
[43:03] god created the heaven and the earth
[43:05] then john picks it up and he looks at
[43:07] seemingly the same beginning
[43:09] in john 1 1 he says in the beginning was
[43:11] the word and the word was with god
[43:13] and the word was god now
[43:16] whereas genesis says in the beginning
[43:18] god created the heaven and the earth
[43:21] john 1 1 takes us perhaps just a skosh
[43:25] back a little bit we say quantum leap
[43:27] sometimes to think of a very
[43:28] uh large leap but it's just an
[43:31] infinitesimal leap it's very small
[43:33] almost indistinguishable so if we could
[43:34] just take a quantum leap back
[43:36] just a small step back john is looking
[43:38] at from this perspective
[43:40] in the beginning was the word and the
[43:42] word was with god and the word was god
[43:44] and we know all things were made by him
[43:47] so when god created the heavens and the
[43:48] earth in the beginning the word created
[43:51] in the beginning was god the word and so
[43:54] we go back to this point to realize
[43:56] the very first thing that had to
[43:58] transpire is that the invisible god had
[44:01] to form himself into a visible
[44:03] expression
[44:04] called the word he was before the
[44:06] beginning the word
[44:08] before there was ever anything else he
[44:09] was the word but the very first form he
[44:12] takes
[44:12] in a in a condescension is the word
[44:15] logos
[44:17] and this is a very difficult concept to
[44:19] get our heads around
[44:20] that before there was anything there was
[44:22] just god
[44:24] the invisible god there was nothing else
[44:27] and when you think about someone being
[44:29] alone you think about that person
[44:31] uh being expressed within some sort of
[44:33] space
[44:35] and you think of someone oh they're all
[44:36] alone at home and so you think of a
[44:38] person at home alone and you think of
[44:39] dimensions and space and
[44:41] three-dimensional uh four
[44:43] four dimensions of walls and height and
[44:45] depth and you'd see all these things
[44:46] because this is
[44:47] this is how someone exists they exist
[44:49] within space
[44:50] and time but god did not exist within
[44:52] space and time
[44:54] he was just god
[44:57] light time space matter did all these
[44:59] different dimensions didn't even exist
[45:01] yet
[45:01] it was just god himself he was the
[45:03] dimension he was the existence he was
[45:05] the only thing there was
[45:07] and he's invisible
[45:10] and so god could have created something
[45:13] and then there
[45:13] just would have been that with no
[45:15] relation
[45:16] so god in order to bri to express
[45:18] himself and to give order
[45:20] he first forms himself and brother brahm
[45:24] says then when he come out
[45:26] there was nothing he says in there he'd
[45:28] come to the logos
[45:30] there's nothing the invisible had
[45:31] nothing but then there's something
[45:33] and this establishes god's pattern of
[45:35] unfolding
[45:36] he unfolds from the invisible to the
[45:38] visible
[45:40] and and i wanted perhaps to preach this
[45:43] this thought this is what i personally
[45:44] wanted to preach this morning i wasn't
[45:46] given that option to do so would have
[45:48] been disobedient
[45:49] but i wanted to preach on how the
[45:51] unfolding of the invisible how that god
[45:53] is invisible
[45:54] and then he forms himself into a visible
[45:56] form and then he establishes the pattern
[45:58] from then on that god
[46:00] always moves from the invisible to the
[46:02] visible
[46:03] and once he had brought man to creation
[46:05] and on earth in a visible form
[46:07] and he had worked from invisible
[46:09] spiritual to in the flesh and that's
[46:11] god's pattern
[46:12] then he got it perfectly in order
[46:14] visibly expressed
[46:15] harmony of the invisible supernatural
[46:18] with the physical invisible harmony
[46:20] between the heavens and the earth
[46:21] everything's perfect operating in
[46:23] harmony when satan comes and interrupts
[46:25] that harmony
[46:26] god now has to work from the physical to
[46:28] the invisible
[46:30] and that's why with israel everything
[46:32] was natural they were given a natural
[46:33] land they were given a natural
[46:34] circumcision they had natural sacrifices
[46:37] and then when their messiah came he was
[46:39] a physical natural messiah
[46:41] but once the messiah came he revives the
[46:43] invisible original
[46:44] from genesis 1 28 from genesis 3 15
[46:47] and now god can work invisibly on the
[46:49] heart of a man
[46:50] and bring them a new birth and become a
[46:52] new creation without anything happening
[46:54] visibly to someone's eyes
[46:55] there stands a new creature in christ
[46:57] jesus and now he works from the
[46:59] invisible
[47:00] and he's been working as in the church
[47:02] to bring her to a place
[47:03] where even the bride of jesus christ
[47:05] receives an invisible union
[47:07] and receives a supernatural spiritual
[47:10] messiah
[47:11] before we physically meet him in the air
[47:13] and come back in the next coming
[47:15] upon a physical earth for a physical
[47:16] millennium with a physical messiah
[47:20] i got to preach it it only took me two
[47:22] minutes
[47:24] but that's god's pattern so he says
[47:28] and remember the creator expresses
[47:30] himself in the creation
[47:32] there's nothing but god there's nothing
[47:35] visible tangible see
[47:36] you could see but he says then there
[47:38] comes from
[47:39] that the logos it was the logos that
[47:41] went out of god he says
[47:43] there he was plain out there in space
[47:44] just like a child before the door
[47:47] like a son playing before the father
[47:49] like a son
[47:50] playing before the father we can't try
[47:52] to take our understanding of father and
[47:54] son
[47:55] and and that paradigm of an individual
[47:57] entity and another individual entity
[47:59] that have different personalities
[48:01] different desires different objectives
[48:02] different goals
[48:03] and impose that upon god now becoming
[48:06] the logos
[48:07] and then seeing two different
[48:08] personalities or even use the phrase
[48:10] which is catholic
[48:11] uh eternal sonship
[48:14] but it's the invisible god now fully
[48:16] expressed
[48:17] in the logos he says it's like a son
[48:20] playing before the father why
[48:22] he came out from the invisible like a
[48:24] child he's saying
[48:25] he says i can see him draw the whole
[48:28] picture in his mind
[48:30] of the kingdom and what it might be
[48:35] as soon as the logos comes forth he's
[48:38] drawing the whole picture in his mind
[48:40] of the kingdom and what it might be in
[48:43] question and answers in august of 1964
[48:46] he says the logos which is actually the
[48:49] attribute of the fullness of god
[48:51] so the logos is an attribute of the
[48:53] fullness of god
[48:55] when god become into a form to where it
[48:57] could be seen
[48:59] it was the anointing of the great spirit
[49:01] that went forth it's condescending
[49:03] coming down so the logos is god coming
[49:06] down into a visible form
[49:08] and it's that visible form that creates
[49:10] the heavenlies
[49:11] and the supernatural order of angels and
[49:13] worship and all the hierarchy of heaven
[49:15] but he's now in a form that angels can
[49:17] see
[49:18] and can appear before him and there's
[49:19] some sort of relation and connectivity
[49:21] to it
[49:22] but yet it's not that form that he wants
[49:23] to relate to man in
[49:27] and so he's saying that this he's when
[49:30] god become into a form where it can be
[49:31] seen it's condescending coming down
[49:34] and christ identified the same in all
[49:35] generations as he spoken it was the word
[49:37] and the word is made manifest
[49:38] and as the word is made manifest it's
[49:40] god becoming material
[49:42] so this is odd all of god becoming
[49:44] material becoming tangible
[49:46] he says in identification 64. god came
[49:49] down the character of god was in christ
[49:51] he was the reflection he was god made
[49:53] visible god
[49:54] made visible so you can see how his
[49:56] conditioning down
[49:57] now he achieves it in the flesh of
[49:59] christ it says in the beginning was god
[50:01] he wasn't even god before then god is an
[50:03] object of worship the only thing he was
[50:05] was the eternal
[50:06] and in him was attributes and those
[50:08] attributes were thoughts and those
[50:09] thoughts were expressed to words
[50:10] and a word was made manifest so you have
[50:13] god who's invisible forms himself into a
[50:15] logos that becomes the word because it's
[50:17] the invisible mind
[50:19] person entity god be informed in the
[50:21] logos so once it's expressed it becomes
[50:23] word
[50:25] says it's all god becoming tangible
[50:30] what we see in the old testament what we
[50:32] see in the even in jesus christ what we
[50:34] see
[50:34] is god wanting to become tangible he
[50:36] says it's all god becoming tangible
[50:38] and you are a part of god
[50:42] and jesus come to redeem those that were
[50:44] put on the lamb's book of life before
[50:45] the foundation of the world
[50:46] it was god's thoughts and that's what he
[50:48] came to redeem
[50:51] god's thoughts brother said are not like
[50:52] your our thoughts
[50:54] his thoughts are real and they are
[50:56] eternal
[50:57] so this gives an eternal quality to the
[51:00] elect to where you have
[51:01] i know it's difficult to try to
[51:03] understand i know you can't fully wrap
[51:04] your mind around it
[51:05] and yet it doesn't it's not in the same
[51:07] vein of pre-existence of souls and the
[51:10] same vein of eternal sonship
[51:11] but you being in god in the beginning
[51:14] have an eternal quality
[51:16] his thoughts are real and they are
[51:17] eternal and you are forever
[51:19] linked link to those original thoughts
[51:26] he said those are the ones that come to
[51:27] redeem as soon as it strikes to them
[51:29] they see it because the life is in there
[51:31] but if life isn't there then what can
[51:32] they do see they don't see it they'll
[51:34] never see it and the whole thing
[51:36] jesus says at that day
[51:39] at that day you'll know that i am in the
[51:41] father
[51:42] and the father and me and i in you
[51:45] and you and me now there's a riddle for
[51:47] you
[51:49] i am in the father and the father in me
[51:53] and then i in you and you and me
[51:56] you can't unpack that you can't unwind
[52:00] that
[52:01] turn that around every single different
[52:02] way you can and try the it find the end
[52:04] from the beginning
[52:05] who's in who who's which i am in the
[52:07] father and the father is in me i and you
[52:09] and you and me
[52:10] that's not a russian doll you can just
[52:12] unpack and say well here you this
[52:13] just just you just line it up this way
[52:16] no this one goes in that one and the one
[52:17] that you just put in that one's got to
[52:18] go inside that one
[52:20] and then you got to take the one in that
[52:21] one and put it in this one and then this
[52:22] one put inside that one
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:25] hallelujah that's who you are
[52:28] [Music]
[52:30] at that day you're going to know i and
[52:32] you and you and me i am in the father
[52:33] the father me i you and you me the whole
[52:35] thing is god
[52:36] becoming material not just in christ
[52:39] christ and the father the father in
[52:40] christ but now i
[52:41] and you and you and me it's god becoming
[52:45] material like a husband and wife
[52:47] becoming one
[52:48] god and his church becoming one
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] the becoming god unfolding and
[52:55] manifesting
[52:57] listen to the scripture that he quotes
[52:58] at that day you shall know that i am in
[53:00] the father the father and me i and you
[53:01] and you and me
[53:02] the whole thing is god becoming material
[53:04] like god and his bride
[53:06] john 14 19 to 20 yet a little while in
[53:09] the world seeth me no more
[53:11] but ye see me because i live
[53:14] you shall live also now the prophet
[53:17] catches
[53:18] an inspiration and a prophecy in this
[53:20] and it is the rising of the sun in
[53:22] paragraph 97
[53:23] he quotes this because i live ye live
[53:25] also but he doesn't say speaking to his
[53:27] disciples he says speaking to his wife
[53:31] here he is speaking to his disciples
[53:32] they can receive a truth of it
[53:34] compound meaning compound truth they
[53:36] receive a truth of it but now there's
[53:37] yet a prophetic utterance that comes
[53:39] forth from the bridegroom itself because
[53:41] i live ye live also
[53:42] he says because i live ye shall live
[53:44] also what is he doing he's prophesying
[53:47] of the wife when brother branham quotes
[53:48] it because i live ye
[53:50] live also why we've not it's not shall
[53:52] but you do
[53:55] it's not shall but you do live speaking
[53:57] to his wife
[53:59] what was it he's speaking now because i
[54:01] live you will live
[54:03] and now because i am living because i'm
[54:05] alive you are alive
[54:07] also because i live you live also he
[54:09] says what a resurrection that that was
[54:11] what a resurrection this is to be
[54:13] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[54:15] in christ jesus
[54:16] by god's quickening power that's what
[54:19] snatched you from death to life that's
[54:21] what lets you see his coming
[54:23] quickening power did this
[54:26] who's he speaking to his wife
[54:29] so brother bam takes john 14 19 because
[54:31] i live ye shall live also
[54:33] because i live my bride lives also
[54:36] speaking to his wife
[54:39] brings us to hosea chapter two i will no
[54:41] longer call you
[54:42] a bahali which is a an oh to balaam
[54:45] and babylonian deities but i will call
[54:47] you ishi which is to be married
[54:48] and i'll take away the names of balaam
[54:51] out of your mouth and they will be reno
[54:52] remember no more in your name i'm going
[54:54] to give you your new name i'm going to
[54:56] give you
[54:56] a new identity i'm going to kill your
[54:58] old husband he's dead he's been divorced
[55:00] i'm going to put that old woman away and
[55:02] in that day
[55:04] i'll be married to my wife and she'll be
[55:06] called is she she shall be called mary
[55:08] i'm speaking to my wife
[55:10] [Music]
[55:13] i ran into a very uh a very
[55:16] discouraging situation one time when i
[55:18] was in central america ministering
[55:21] and i was sitting down with a very
[55:23] wonderful evangelist who travels
[55:24] constantly all over the uh this one
[55:26] country uh
[55:28] dozens of churches a year very very
[55:30] faithful and they have regular ministers
[55:31] meetings
[55:32] uh every every month they've been doing
[55:34] this for decades
[55:36] and um i said and i asked d what what
[55:39] kind of things do you guys
[55:40] kind of go back and forth on is there
[55:42] ever any real good discussion maybe
[55:44] disagreements or arguments he says oh no
[55:45] we never
[55:46] we never have any arguments or
[55:47] disagreements and i was like
[55:51] okay i mean for my closest minister
[55:54] friends that i
[55:55] feel like i see just eye to eye on on
[55:57] things we still have things that we look
[55:59] at a little bit differently and so
[56:00] there's a back and forth even sometimes
[56:02] it might appears if there's an argument
[56:03] consider this consider that turning
[56:04] things over and talking this guy said no
[56:06] never never an argument i thought are
[56:08] you guys really even having meetings
[56:11] and he said you know one time we did
[56:12] have a disagreement he said a minister
[56:14] was teaching
[56:16] that in this remember that he speaks
[56:17] spanish he's speaking to me in english
[56:19] he says
[56:19] a minister one time was teaching that
[56:21] the bride is actually married to christ
[56:23] now and it's his wife
[56:25] instead of just a bride and i and i said
[56:27] wait a minute there was a disagreement
[56:29] over there
[56:30] i said also somebody doesn't believe
[56:31] their wife goes no this brother was
[56:33] saying that we're married that we are
[56:34] his wife not his bride
[56:35] and i said so help me out understand
[56:39] what is the bride translated to in the
[56:41] message by your translators
[56:43] he said bride in our spanish translation
[56:46] is novia which is girlfriend
[56:50] and not esposa which is wife and so you
[56:53] have
[56:53] almost a whole language that has not
[56:56] caught the revelation that we're not
[56:58] merely a girlfriend or a fiancee or
[57:01] engaged to christ
[57:02] but the union has come and we're not
[57:05] just a bride
[57:06] in waiting but it's her day of union
[57:09] and she's now wife
[57:18] so he says because i live ye shall live
[57:20] also
[57:21] continue in verse 20 john 14 20 at that
[57:24] day ye shall know
[57:26] when you become wife at that day ye
[57:29] shall know that i am in my father
[57:30] in ye and me and i in you he's speaking
[57:33] prophecy now
[57:35] now there's it doesn't mean to say that
[57:36] there wasn't some understanding and some
[57:39] light that was shed
[57:40] upon these verses and some reality that
[57:42] existed within the believer's heart
[57:44] or even some truth that was so but he's
[57:46] saying at that day ye shall
[57:48] know now if we want to at least
[57:50] establish that it has always been
[57:52] i in you ye and me and i and the father
[57:55] has always been that way
[57:57] i am in the father i you and me and i in
[57:59] you
[58:00] even though it's always been that way
[58:01] he's saying now it's going to come a
[58:02] time
[58:03] where we know this is the reality we
[58:05] understand the implications of it we
[58:07] understand the consequence of it we
[58:09] understand the purpose of it
[58:10] and we fulfilled the promise and the
[58:13] potential of john 14
[58:14] 20. so i i i'm not trying to express
[58:18] this to establish oh they didn't have it
[58:20] it wasn't so
[58:20] but we must understand that brother adam
[58:23] took john 14 20
[58:24] and he cemented it as prophecy for this
[58:27] hour that the full reality and
[58:29] comprehension of it
[58:30] does not take place until you came to be
[58:33] until you came to understand
[58:34] until you came into this union
[58:39] he says in christ is a mystery god
[58:40] revealed god making himself known
[58:43] we're not supposed to make converts to
[58:45] christianity by a government
[58:47] but by revelation christ in you as god
[58:50] was in christ
[58:51] and god was in christ christ in you
[58:55] when what god did in christ christ does
[58:57] in you what signs god did in christ
[58:59] christ doesn't you oh isn't that
[59:01] beautiful oh my i like that
[59:03] jesus said at that day that's
[59:07] this day at that day when this
[59:10] revelation
[59:11] is made known you will know that i am in
[59:15] the father and the father and me i and
[59:16] you and you and me when the revelation
[59:19] is made manifest at that day ye shall
[59:21] know that i and the father are one i am
[59:23] in the father and the fathers and me
[59:25] then the revelation comes forth then
[59:28] it's i in you
[59:29] and you and me there you are the
[59:32] threefold manifestation
[59:36] the threefold manifestation
[59:39] at that day when the revelation is made
[59:41] known at that day when the revelation is
[59:43] made manifest
[59:44] when the revelation comes forth then
[59:46] it's i on you and you and me
[59:48] there you are the threefold
[59:49] manifestation what for to bring it back
[59:51] we've got to be so brother bam takes
[59:54] john 14
[59:55] 20 and he establishes how this
[59:58] is god becoming tangible is now at that
[1:00:01] day it's i in you
[1:00:02] in you and me that brings us to
[1:00:04] revelations 3 20. behold i stand at the
[1:00:06] door knock
[1:00:07] if any man will open i will come into
[1:00:09] him and he to me
[1:00:10] and i will sup with him and he with me
[1:00:18] oh my i feel good i haven't even
[1:00:19] preached an hour yet i feel like we're
[1:00:21] just this is just going great
[1:00:26] you know don't be discouraged about
[1:00:27] wearing a mask it's just god and morphe
[1:00:29] right i mean
[1:00:32] always changing our mask
[1:00:36] genesis chapter 2 verse 8
[1:00:39] and i can tell you're smiling even
[1:00:40] though you have mask on
[1:00:44] it's really awkward traveling with a
[1:00:46] mask you sit next to a little kid
[1:00:49] and you want to smile out and make them
[1:00:51] laugh but you just come across looking
[1:00:52] really creepy what you try to do with
[1:00:53] your eyes
[1:00:55] to get a little kid to laugh with the
[1:00:57] mask on
[1:00:59] genesis chapter 2 verse 8 i feel like
[1:01:02] maybe i've laid my foundation
[1:01:04] and now i want to go back to see the
[1:01:06] creator express himself in the creation
[1:01:10] this becoming god god becoming material
[1:01:12] it's all god becoming tangible
[1:01:14] the whole thing is god becoming material
[1:01:16] like a husband and wife at that day you
[1:01:18] shall know i and you and you and me
[1:01:20] and then i am in the father at that day
[1:01:22] speaking to his wife
[1:01:23] god making himself known when the
[1:01:24] revelation is alone the revelation is
[1:01:26] made manifest
[1:01:28] so i want to look for a moment at the
[1:01:29] word that we're completing the threefold
[1:01:31] purpose of god made manifest in adam and
[1:01:33] the woman
[1:01:34] the completion of that word of every
[1:01:36] seed bringing forth of its kind
[1:01:38] to see what god was planning for in his
[1:01:40] future what he's looking for in his
[1:01:42] future
[1:01:44] as the creator expresses himself back in
[1:01:46] creation
[1:01:47] in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 i see this
[1:01:51] as being kind of the climax of the
[1:01:52] physical creation as far as the earth
[1:01:55] it says in genesis chapter 2 verse 8 and
[1:01:56] the lord god planted a garden
[1:01:59] eastward in eden god now
[1:02:02] plants a garden eastward and the word
[1:02:05] eastward
[1:02:06] means in the beginning in eden
[1:02:09] although it would have a geographical
[1:02:12] context directional context
[1:02:13] and we would relate eastward but it also
[1:02:15] holds this meaning that when god
[1:02:17] created was bringing forth eden at the
[1:02:20] very beginning he
[1:02:21] planted a garden eastward in eden and
[1:02:23] brother bannon goes to great lengths in
[1:02:25] different places to establish that you
[1:02:27] have eden then you have the garden in
[1:02:28] eden
[1:02:29] and he says that adam and the woman were
[1:02:31] thrust out of the garden but yet in the
[1:02:34] fall
[1:02:34] they lived in eden they just didn't have
[1:02:36] access to the garden of eden
[1:02:38] so it represented something very special
[1:02:40] to god as a matter of fact the world
[1:02:42] that god loved was the garden in eden
[1:02:45] the world that god loved was the
[1:02:46] original eden condition everything in
[1:02:48] perfection everything operating in
[1:02:49] perfect harmony
[1:02:50] otherwise we'd have a real big conflict
[1:02:52] when he says love not the world or the
[1:02:54] things of the world
[1:02:54] because if you do the love of god is not
[1:02:56] in you yet the bible says for god so
[1:02:58] loved the world he gave his only
[1:03:00] begotten son
[1:03:01] you have to understand the world that
[1:03:02] god loved and the world that he gave his
[1:03:04] son to redeem
[1:03:06] was this original order in this original
[1:03:08] world
[1:03:09] not the perversion and the cosmos that
[1:03:11] comes after it not even the wheat plant
[1:03:13] and everything that unfolds after it
[1:03:14] god's original love and aspiration was
[1:03:17] enveloped in and made manifest in this
[1:03:20] garden
[1:03:20] that he planted in the beginning in eden
[1:03:28] that's the treasure hit in the field
[1:03:30] which you are
[1:03:32] you're that pearl of great price none of
[1:03:34] us found christ and
[1:03:35] hit him in the earth and went and sold
[1:03:37] everything and come back and dug him up
[1:03:39] and bought the field but he did for what
[1:03:42] the treasure in the field
[1:03:44] you're the treasure in the field so he
[1:03:46] atoned for the sins of the whole world
[1:03:48] he atoned for everything
[1:03:49] past present and future but what did he
[1:03:51] do it for for the elect seed that was in
[1:03:53] it
[1:03:54] that's the parable to understand the
[1:03:55] parable of that great treasure and that
[1:03:57] great pearl
[1:03:58] so the lord god planted a garden
[1:04:00] eastward in the beginning in eden and
[1:04:02] then notice this great description here
[1:04:04] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:04:06] formed
[1:04:08] god is expressing himself in creation
[1:04:11] he's actually hiding a mystery in the
[1:04:13] earth
[1:04:14] and what he's creating and brother
[1:04:16] branham says this and satan's eden
[1:04:18] having faith in all his word his seeds
[1:04:20] he brought an eden of holiness love and
[1:04:22] eternal life
[1:04:26] that's what god's eden produced holiness
[1:04:28] and it brought an eden of holiness of
[1:04:30] love
[1:04:31] understanding perfection and eternal
[1:04:33] life
[1:04:34] that's what god let me just stop and say
[1:04:37] this
[1:04:37] there's many different ways he describes
[1:04:39] it perfect understand the love of god
[1:04:40] perfect love all around no death
[1:04:42] he describes it a lot of different
[1:04:44] layers of how perfect this eden was
[1:04:46] he said that's what god is planting his
[1:04:48] word his seed
[1:04:50] that is what his church will be at the
[1:04:52] end
[1:04:53] it'll be the same thing
[1:04:56] brother branham is specifically
[1:04:58] connecting the bride in the end time
[1:05:01] to what the eden was in the beginning
[1:05:05] what the garden of eden was in the
[1:05:07] beginning the bride
[1:05:08] is at the end he's connecting the bride
[1:05:10] now to a garden of eden condition
[1:05:13] he said that's what christ is the
[1:05:14] mystery god revealed us for to bring her
[1:05:16] back to the position
[1:05:17] with her husband again to bring her back
[1:05:19] to the original condition he says
[1:05:21] in the garden of eden so it's not just a
[1:05:23] location i've
[1:05:24] got to go find the river euphrates i got
[1:05:25] to go find that fertile ground there
[1:05:27] somewhere
[1:05:27] in the middle east no don't think of a
[1:05:29] geographical location
[1:05:32] don't get hung up on that just yet just
[1:05:35] walk in the footsteps
[1:05:36] of the righteous just walk in the path
[1:05:37] as the light goes forward you'll end up
[1:05:39] there if there's a geographical location
[1:05:41] but right now this is a spiritual
[1:05:43] position and the garden of eden was a
[1:05:45] spiritual condition a supernatural
[1:05:46] relationship
[1:05:47] a harmony between the physical and the
[1:05:49] supernatural everything operating
[1:05:51] perfect harmony and it was a condition
[1:05:53] and the revealed word brother branham is
[1:05:54] preaching and especially what he's
[1:05:56] teaching a crisis of mystery
[1:05:57] is to bring us who are in these
[1:05:59] pesthouses
[1:06:00] back to the original condition of
[1:06:03] spiritual harmony and union
[1:06:04] with the supernatural
[1:06:08] and actually have what is the fullness
[1:06:10] of redemption
[1:06:12] and have a fullness of a relationship
[1:06:13] with christ even before this body is
[1:06:16] redeemed
[1:06:20] that's what the church will be at the
[1:06:22] end it'll be the same thing so the
[1:06:23] prophet has connected these things
[1:06:24] perfectly together
[1:06:26] now now that we're in the afternoon i'm
[1:06:29] going to start skipping a little bit
[1:06:32] but brother brahman satan's eating goes
[1:06:33] on to talk about a beautiful spot laying
[1:06:35] east of eden called the garden of eden
[1:06:38] he said god made the world's
[1:06:40] headquarters in the garden
[1:06:42] it says god out old maid finally arrived
[1:06:44] with its headquarters in a beautiful
[1:06:45] spot
[1:06:46] laying east in eden he says it was a
[1:06:48] perfect it was perfect peace perfect
[1:06:50] harmony everybody
[1:06:51] everything in perfection and he says
[1:06:53] this he says
[1:06:54] that's what god did he put his son and
[1:06:57] his wife
[1:06:58] over all of it he put them in full
[1:07:01] control
[1:07:02] they could speak to the winds and it
[1:07:04] would cease to blow they
[1:07:06] would speak to the tree and it'd move
[1:07:07] from here to there who would
[1:07:10] they would it was just perfect he placed
[1:07:13] his beloved children his son and his
[1:07:15] daughter
[1:07:16] a husband and wife to control it
[1:07:19] and what the bride is at the end will be
[1:07:22] the same thing
[1:07:24] connecting them together so what was in
[1:07:26] the garden of eden is foreshadowing
[1:07:28] the bride of christ and christ and even
[1:07:31] the perfect eden that will be in
[1:07:33] eternity
[1:07:35] but this garden the lord god planted a
[1:07:37] garden eastward in eden
[1:07:39] this garden that god plants represents
[1:07:41] the bride
[1:07:42] because a garden in scripture is
[1:07:44] figurative of a spouse
[1:07:46] in saul in the song of solomon chapter 4
[1:07:48] verse 12 a garden enclosed is my sister
[1:07:51] my spouse a spring shut up a fountain
[1:07:54] sealed
[1:07:55] a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse
[1:07:58] isn't this beautiful my sister my spouse
[1:08:01] it's the same
[1:08:02] dna it's the re it's to be brought out
[1:08:04] of the man
[1:08:05] it's described in a way that we see the
[1:08:07] original the man and the woman
[1:08:08] the woman brought out of the man she is
[1:08:10] the bone of his bone
[1:08:11] flesh of his flesh she is now a mirror
[1:08:14] image of him and now the scripture
[1:08:16] speaking
[1:08:17] even in this very spiritual supernatural
[1:08:19] way the garden enclosed is my sister
[1:08:22] my spouse verse 15 a fountain of gardens
[1:08:25] a well of living waters a stream from
[1:08:26] lebanon
[1:08:27] so awake on north wind and come thou
[1:08:29] south blow
[1:08:30] upon my garden that the spices there it
[1:08:33] may flow out
[1:08:34] notice how the bridegroom is now
[1:08:36] speaking to his bride
[1:08:38] speaking to the one he loves you are
[1:08:40] like a garden
[1:08:41] my spouse all wins blow and let the
[1:08:43] spices be fragrant let them blow
[1:08:45] and now notice what the bride speaks
[1:08:47] back let
[1:08:48] my beloved come into his garden and eat
[1:08:51] his pleasant fruits
[1:08:54] the bride is like a garden a woman a
[1:08:56] spouse is likened into a garden
[1:08:58] and here the bridegroom describes her as
[1:09:00] a garden but then she cries out
[1:09:02] all come into the garden and eat it by
[1:09:04] present
[1:09:05] pleasant fruits and then chapter five
[1:09:07] begins with this i am
[1:09:08] come into my garden my sister my spouse
[1:09:12] song of solomon painting a beautiful
[1:09:14] picture of here's a beautiful garden
[1:09:16] and a and the husbandman coming into the
[1:09:19] garden which is figurative of a wife and
[1:09:20] a spouse
[1:09:21] and brother and the bible speaks the
[1:09:23] beginning the lord god
[1:09:24] planted a garden in the beginning of
[1:09:26] eden this
[1:09:27] garden of eden represents the bride of
[1:09:29] jesus christ in the last days
[1:09:32] represents her position and her
[1:09:33] condition in the last days and she says
[1:09:35] oh let
[1:09:36] my beloved come into his garden he says
[1:09:39] i am come
[1:09:40] into my spouse i am come down into her
[1:09:45] in genesis 2 15 it says the lord god
[1:09:47] took the man
[1:09:48] and put him into the garden of eden to
[1:09:51] dress it
[1:09:52] and to keep it notice the very image of
[1:09:55] how the man is placed into the garden
[1:09:57] the guard being figurative of a wife
[1:09:59] he places the man into the garden and
[1:10:01] what does he do to the garden he dresses
[1:10:03] it
[1:10:03] and keeps it this is the very image that
[1:10:06] paul draws upon in ephesians chapter
[1:10:08] 5 verses 25 to 33 32 where he speaks
[1:10:11] about the mystery of christ and the
[1:10:13] oneness with his bride he's somehow a
[1:10:15] man loves his wife
[1:10:16] and washes her and keeps her and
[1:10:17] cherishes her wife he's a husband
[1:10:19] i the lord do water it i will keep it
[1:10:21] night and day she is a vineyard this is
[1:10:24] the very thing that now adam is doing in
[1:10:26] the garden
[1:10:27] it's representative of a husband
[1:10:30] i will dress it in the word i will keep
[1:10:32] it night and day
[1:10:36] the lord took the man whom he had formed
[1:10:39] and put him in the garden of eden to
[1:10:40] dress it and to keep it
[1:10:42] birdman says what the garden was then
[1:10:44] the church is the same thing in the end
[1:10:45] it'll be the same thing
[1:10:47] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:10:49] formed and there he put
[1:10:51] the man and put him in the garden of
[1:10:52] eden and brother branham and christ
[1:10:54] revealed in his own word says now
[1:10:56] there's nothing else left for it to come
[1:10:58] but him himself to step into that
[1:11:01] because that's the last thing there is
[1:11:02] the next is the intelligence
[1:11:05] what is it the very thing that we see in
[1:11:06] genesis chapter two the very thing we
[1:11:09] see we in song of solomon is a very
[1:11:11] thing that happens in the
[1:11:12] hour we're living in now he himself has
[1:11:14] stepped into that
[1:11:15] he says it's god himself it's becoming
[1:11:18] to a place
[1:11:19] and he's governed the body all the way
[1:11:22] through
[1:11:23] then the complete body of christ is
[1:11:26] revealed
[1:11:26] in the form of a bride that was taken
[1:11:29] out of his side
[1:11:30] like adams was at the beginning he
[1:11:32] brings it right
[1:11:33] back to the beginning it says how the
[1:11:34] woman was brought out of his side
[1:11:36] it comes back to the same picture in the
[1:11:38] end that the bride comes forth in this
[1:11:40] radiant glory
[1:11:41] what is it who is it it's god himself
[1:11:44] becoming
[1:11:45] to that place just as in the beginning
[1:11:49] he took this beautiful garden
[1:11:50] and he took the man that he had formed
[1:11:52] which was in the image of god
[1:11:54] and there he placed the man it's exactly
[1:11:57] what god had in his mind
[1:11:59] that one day i'll have a garden which is
[1:12:01] my bride
[1:12:02] in satan's eden and i will step down
[1:12:05] into his eden like he did in the mine
[1:12:08] and i will step into her and i will give
[1:12:11] her a sacred charge
[1:12:12] for redemption because i'll let the
[1:12:16] serpent use the woman for the fall
[1:12:18] i will save the woman for the end for
[1:12:21] redemption and she
[1:12:22] and she alone will be given a sacred
[1:12:25] charge for the fullness of redemption
[1:12:27] where is that redemption today it is in
[1:12:29] the bride of jesus christ
[1:12:31] why because christ is in here
[1:12:39] my i know these things have been
[1:12:41] preached before and i think i've
[1:12:42] preached it here before too because
[1:12:44] i think i've i've preached here enough
[1:12:46] to where i just said you know what i'm
[1:12:47] probably preaching something but i just
[1:12:48] got to do it
[1:12:50] just do it but listen to the i see how
[1:12:53] beautiful it is god takes six thousand
[1:12:55] years and creates this perfect eden
[1:12:58] and the perfection of eden he places
[1:13:01] as long as the woman was in the man she
[1:13:03] couldn't be tempted
[1:13:06] and so in that in that one there's
[1:13:08] perfect immunity
[1:13:10] not no temptation at all but now that he
[1:13:13] takes the woman out now brother branham
[1:13:15] says
[1:13:16] she wasn't another creation because if
[1:13:17] it had been another creation would have
[1:13:18] been greater
[1:13:20] so she comes as a byproduct and he uses
[1:13:22] that word in a sense that might seem to
[1:13:24] be a little bit of a derogatory but he's
[1:13:26] wanting us to understand
[1:13:27] that it's not another creation it's a
[1:13:29] byproduct of the man
[1:13:30] and it made her vulnerable and god
[1:13:33] placed her on that basis
[1:13:35] one minister told me that a woman is a
[1:13:37] byproduct and so she buys products
[1:13:42] and so he takes the woman out of the man
[1:13:45] and now the woman
[1:13:46] being out from the man he placed her
[1:13:48] brother and says on the basis that she
[1:13:50] could fall
[1:13:51] but then he says he places you on the
[1:13:53] basis that you cannot fall
[1:13:56] and that's god even the redeeming the
[1:13:58] woman in the end
[1:14:00] because he put her on that basis of free
[1:14:01] more agency to allow her to be tempted
[1:14:03] and what happens is satan
[1:14:05] a spiritual being inhabits the flesh of
[1:14:08] a human-like serpent a beast
[1:14:11] and inhabits possessing his flesh he
[1:14:14] causes him to preach
[1:14:16] a sermon that traps into the mind of a
[1:14:18] woman then drops down into her heart
[1:14:20] and by that under by that quickening it
[1:14:23] actually brought forth death
[1:14:25] and death said immediately when she
[1:14:27] received that thought into her mind
[1:14:28] and then she begins to act upon that
[1:14:31] that instinct and act upon that death
[1:14:32] and she sold it into her race
[1:14:35] she sows it into humankind and it causes
[1:14:37] the whole thing to fall
[1:14:40] and then when when the judgment is going
[1:14:42] forth and he begins to speak judgment
[1:14:43] upon
[1:14:44] different he curses the servant he
[1:14:45] curses curse the man he curses the woman
[1:14:47] he curses the serpent and then the earth
[1:14:49] what did the earth do
[1:14:51] he curses the earth along with it and
[1:14:54] then
[1:14:55] it's from that very earth that abel
[1:14:57] wants the cain wants to bring for
[1:14:58] sacrifice
[1:15:00] but yet god is expressing things and all
[1:15:02] these different things are taking place
[1:15:03] and he curses the serpent
[1:15:04] and he says i'm gonna there's gonna be a
[1:15:06] seed of the woman that's gonna crush
[1:15:07] your head
[1:15:09] so what's satan looking for the first
[1:15:10] son
[1:15:12] because it says he he and what is the
[1:15:13] first thing he do he murders that seed
[1:15:16] so he's always been looking for the seed
[1:15:17] after that but this is what happens
[1:15:20] after six thousand years
[1:15:21] death lies and perversion enters in
[1:15:23] god's perfect eden
[1:15:25] so then god lets six thousand years come
[1:15:28] and allows satan to build his eden
[1:15:32] his eden of quote unquote perfection his
[1:15:34] eden
[1:15:35] of unrighteousness he gets it where he
[1:15:37] wants it and now when satan finally has
[1:15:39] his eden
[1:15:40] god himself comes down inhabits the
[1:15:43] flesh of a redeemed son of god
[1:15:45] who preaches a sermon and a woman hears
[1:15:48] it and once that's quickened to her
[1:15:49] heart
[1:15:50] it actually is going to bring to pass
[1:15:52] the final climax
[1:15:53] wherein we defeat death and we avenge
[1:15:56] the blood of abel
[1:15:58] that's why creation is grown in
[1:16:00] hallelujah
[1:16:01] to be delivered into the glorious
[1:16:03] liberty of the sons of god
[1:16:05] while they weren't meant to be ruled by
[1:16:06] the nonsense that's out there now
[1:16:08] and they were cursed in the beginning
[1:16:10] having done nothing but yet it logs to
[1:16:12] see you
[1:16:13] come to your position in christ it longs
[1:16:15] to see
[1:16:16] the manifestation of the sons of god and
[1:16:18] to be delivered
[1:16:19] into the glorious liberty of manifested
[1:16:22] sons and daughters of god
[1:16:25] god waited two thousand six thousand
[1:16:27] years to do to satan exactly what he did
[1:16:29] in his eden
[1:16:35] it's becoming to a place there's nothing
[1:16:38] left except for him to step into it
[1:16:41] i will sow her unto me in the earth
[1:16:45] god planted a bride at the beginning
[1:16:48] before satan ever got to the woman he
[1:16:51] had already sowed you into the earth
[1:16:54] and it sealed up the womb of the earth
[1:16:56] as it was
[1:16:57] and the earth was pregnant with the
[1:16:59] bride and
[1:17:00] nothing could destroy it nothing could
[1:17:03] harm that
[1:17:04] until the last seed comes to expression
[1:17:09] before satan could ever even get to you
[1:17:11] he'd already sown you brother branham
[1:17:16] says in the beginning of the creation
[1:17:17] he says in a notice not it not august of
[1:17:20] 65
[1:17:21] in the beginning of the creation of god
[1:17:23] when he began to create and bring you
[1:17:24] into existence
[1:17:26] you started back there's a seed and
[1:17:28] worked down to where you are now
[1:17:30] in the beginning when god created he
[1:17:32] began to bring you
[1:17:33] into existence you started back there's
[1:17:36] a seed and worked down to where you are
[1:17:37] now
[1:17:37] and then you were all in christ and in
[1:17:39] christ he died to redeem all of you
[1:17:41] and you are a part of this word
[1:17:45] god is expressing himself the creator is
[1:17:47] expressing himself in the creation
[1:17:52] and we see it expressed now i don't know
[1:17:55] if that's a sign but the clock fell down
[1:17:56] up here okay
[1:17:59] it's like it's 51-21 what is that
[1:18:04] 12 15. now just to take a step further
[1:18:08] after he says there he placed the man
[1:18:09] that he had formed
[1:18:11] now you have a man in the garden but
[1:18:13] look at the expression
[1:18:15] though it expresses some type and shadow
[1:18:17] though it expresses the bride of christ
[1:18:19] and christ in the midst of her now
[1:18:20] there's still that's something not
[1:18:21] that's not quite right
[1:18:23] and the lord god said after he'd been
[1:18:25] good good good creates man it's very
[1:18:27] good but now the first time this word is
[1:18:28] ever uttered in this sense
[1:18:30] and the lord god said it is not good but
[1:18:33] what was not good is it was not good
[1:18:34] that man should be alone
[1:18:36] i will make him a help meet for him
[1:18:40] god's expression is not complete man was
[1:18:43] in the very image of god but the image
[1:18:44] held a mystery
[1:18:46] just like god did in the beginning and
[1:18:48] so the bible says he took a rib which
[1:18:50] the lord god had made
[1:18:51] taken from the man he takes that rib and
[1:18:53] made he a woman
[1:18:55] so now when the woman is made he says
[1:18:56] and brought her unto the man
[1:19:00] and brother madam says that's what the
[1:19:02] church is doing today
[1:19:04] for jesus is the word and he is the
[1:19:05] bridegroom and the brightest part of the
[1:19:07] groom
[1:19:08] therefore the word that's to be
[1:19:09] fulfilled in this day is part of the
[1:19:11] same word that was fulfilled in his day
[1:19:13] and it's the same word same experience
[1:19:15] same life this isn't siege
[1:19:17] it's not here with the shock for when
[1:19:18] god separated adam he was both male and
[1:19:21] female and then genesis 2 and on he
[1:19:23] created a man out of the dust of the
[1:19:24] earth
[1:19:25] man was created in god's image god is a
[1:19:27] spirit so he's a spirit man
[1:19:28] then when he become flesh animal flesh
[1:19:30] on the earth he is showing
[1:19:32] portraying here the bride
[1:19:38] therefore part of his spirit part of his
[1:19:40] body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:19:41] word of his word
[1:19:42] life of his life and that's the way the
[1:19:44] bride is to christ
[1:19:47] so when he says when the woman came out
[1:19:48] of the man what was god portrayed
[1:19:51] he was once again portraying the bride
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:19:55] god is showing us something that we can
[1:19:57] sow identify ourselves
[1:19:59] with the original so identify ourselves
[1:20:01] with scripture
[1:20:02] that we can't read it without thinking
[1:20:04] that's me
[1:20:06] this is something he wanted me to see me
[1:20:08] to know me to draw from
[1:20:11] he is showing portraying here the bride
[1:20:15] and what is happening in this very
[1:20:17] dynamic as brother madam preaches these
[1:20:19] great mysteries after the seals are open
[1:20:21] we have a prophet bringing her the bride
[1:20:24] to the man just as it says in genesis 22
[1:20:29] and he made a woman and brought her unto
[1:20:31] the man
[1:20:32] this is the ministry of elijah the
[1:20:34] minister of elijah is to take the woman
[1:20:36] and bring her face to face with god
[1:20:39] brother branham said in voice of the
[1:20:40] sign he says notice john immediately
[1:20:42] he's saying hey one day the lambs come
[1:20:44] in one day's land so the next day he
[1:20:46] says behold the lamb and i said what
[1:20:47] changed
[1:20:49] the attraction was now the prophet the
[1:20:51] prophet's prophecy
[1:20:53] and he says and john immediately said he
[1:20:55] must increase i must decrease
[1:20:57] he presented the church to christ
[1:21:01] and we're told in the last days that
[1:21:03] we'll repeat
[1:21:04] again and it has repeated
[1:21:08] again brother branham introduced the
[1:21:10] woman to the man
[1:21:12] he has introduced this as this woman
[1:21:15] that was a spouse
[1:21:16] he has introduced the bride to her mate
[1:21:19] the revealed word
[1:21:20] that's why he appeared the way he did in
[1:21:22] this hour is that you would know your
[1:21:24] mate the revealed word
[1:21:25] the introduction has been made the
[1:21:27] friend of the bridegroom rejoices
[1:21:31] the prophet's joy is complete because he
[1:21:34] has made the introduction
[1:21:36] brother branham is not rolling over in
[1:21:37] his grave brother branham is not
[1:21:39] restless to come back
[1:21:40] brother branham rejoices because he
[1:21:42] hears the voice of the bride
[1:21:44] with her bridegroom his ministry is
[1:21:46] fully authenticated
[1:21:47] his ministry is fully vindicated his
[1:21:50] ministry has been thoroughly confirmed
[1:21:52] he has done what he was commissioned to
[1:21:54] do he has introduced
[1:21:56] the bride to jesus christ
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:02] he's presented us to christ and christ
[1:22:06] will take us the rest of the way
[1:22:08] isn't that what he did in the first
[1:22:09] church
[1:22:12] he took them john handed them off the
[1:22:13] very same disciples peter and different
[1:22:15] ones were disciples of john
[1:22:17] i said i'll take him from here and
[1:22:20] that's what vindicated john's ministry
[1:22:22] and he took them to the climax of their
[1:22:24] day which is the new birth in an upper
[1:22:26] room
[1:22:27] and christ is here taking us to the
[1:22:29] climax in our day which is a new body
[1:22:31] and a meeting in the air brother branham
[1:22:34] said in earnestly continuing for the
[1:22:36] faith the first one to end now this is
[1:22:38] you've got to follow the layers here
[1:22:40] he presented the church to christ
[1:22:42] program says the first one to introduce
[1:22:44] the faith for the christian church
[1:22:46] was none other than jesus himself he was
[1:22:50] the introduction of the faith
[1:22:51] that was to be handed to the christian
[1:22:53] church
[1:22:54] now we've got to think with
[1:22:55] understanding think spiritually about
[1:22:57] the faith of our pentecostal fathers
[1:23:00] think spiritually about the faith those
[1:23:02] members had that when they were gathered
[1:23:03] into the upper room
[1:23:05] this wasn't hearsay this wasn't just
[1:23:08] what mama said
[1:23:09] but their messiah had appeared to them
[1:23:12] and continually appeared to them
[1:23:13] and was with them and walking amongst
[1:23:15] them and manifest himself
[1:23:16] until they were at the place for the
[1:23:18] climax when the promise would
[1:23:20] come and brother ram says it's christ
[1:23:22] they introduced the faith
[1:23:23] to the pentecostal fathers and so how is
[1:23:25] it today that we're going to be restored
[1:23:27] back to the faith
[1:23:28] of the original pentecostal fathers
[1:23:30] unless it's christ himself
[1:23:32] who introduces that faith back to us
[1:23:36] he is the dynamics
[1:23:40] and the dynamics are up to him
[1:23:47] it's he himself fulfilling the promise
[1:23:49] for today
[1:23:51] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:23:54] finisher
[1:23:54] of our faith i am the alpha and the
[1:23:57] omega
[1:23:58] and brother brown says we come to the
[1:23:59] church's dispensations end time
[1:24:02] that's what i read tomorrow tonight it
[1:24:04] shall be light in the evening time
[1:24:05] we've had plenty of dismal time but
[1:24:07] there shall come light
[1:24:09] the same eson the same sun that came and
[1:24:12] changed the dispensation then
[1:24:14] comes again
[1:24:19] and so when the woman was brought into
[1:24:20] the man
[1:24:23] adam is just he's met with this
[1:24:25] inspiration genesis 22
[1:24:26] chapter 2 verses 23 and 25.
[1:24:30] this is now bone of my bones flesh of my
[1:24:32] flesh
[1:24:33] she shall be called woman because she's
[1:24:36] taken out of the man
[1:24:38] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:24:39] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:24:41] wife
[1:24:41] and they shall be one flesh and they
[1:24:43] were both naked the man
[1:24:45] and his wife and were not ashamed
[1:24:48] what is he portraying he's portraying
[1:24:50] here the bride
[1:24:52] brother abraham says it is the rise of
[1:24:53] the sun he being the groom the bride has
[1:24:55] to come forth
[1:24:56] because it's part of him and it can only
[1:24:58] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[1:25:00] of all the revelations any others have
[1:25:02] spoke of the bride it can only manifest
[1:25:04] it does something different from the
[1:25:05] groom it isn't the bride because
[1:25:07] she is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:25:10] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:25:13] she is him
[1:25:19] this is what adam speaks prophetically
[1:25:23] brother branham when he describes when
[1:25:25] the woman was brought to the man
[1:25:26] and i wish i would have taken the
[1:25:28] statement with me to the pulpit but he
[1:25:30] said the very first time the man
[1:25:32] ever looked at that woman he said it
[1:25:34] struck him
[1:25:36] and he said and that still reverberates
[1:25:38] within mankind today
[1:25:42] the affinity the connection the draw the
[1:25:44] attraction of a man to a woman
[1:25:45] even in her falling condition it began
[1:25:47] the very first time
[1:25:49] adam ever saw the woman it put such a
[1:25:51] charge
[1:25:52] such a striking atom that it shook into
[1:25:54] its very dna into his very core
[1:25:56] and no matter how much it's been mingled
[1:25:58] and mongrelized and hybrid through
[1:26:00] thousands of years
[1:26:01] it still resonates and vibrates within a
[1:26:03] man today
[1:26:04] that image of a woman why because it was
[1:26:06] something that was
[1:26:07] fully from the man it was everything
[1:26:10] that had been with him
[1:26:11] everything he fellowshipped around
[1:26:13] everything he thought about
[1:26:14] what he longed for and didn't know he
[1:26:16] had
[1:26:19] put such a strike in him why because she
[1:26:23] is him
[1:26:25] and he told him he had given a
[1:26:27] commandment now
[1:26:30] it's 12 23 so i'm very conscious of the
[1:26:35] time
[1:26:38] the
[1:26:42] when god says let us make man in our
[1:26:43] image
[1:26:45] he first formed some spiritual being and
[1:26:48] he gives them a command be fruitful
[1:26:50] multiply replenish the earth
[1:26:51] subdue it have dominion over it control
[1:26:53] it it's very very broad
[1:26:55] powers and controls very broad job
[1:26:57] description
[1:26:58] then he forms them in flesh and he puts
[1:27:00] the spirit man in the flesh
[1:27:02] and then when god says it's not good
[1:27:04] that man should be alone i will make a
[1:27:06] help meet
[1:27:06] for him he immediately begins to
[1:27:09] describe how that adam was working in
[1:27:11] the garden
[1:27:12] and he says he went to all the animals
[1:27:14] the animals came to him and he named all
[1:27:15] the animals what they were
[1:27:17] so when he says i'll make a help me form
[1:27:20] one to aid him in his cause
[1:27:21] one that's complementary to him for his
[1:27:23] commission and his purpose
[1:27:24] it actually means a second self
[1:27:28] it means another self as if in a mirror
[1:27:30] so it's not the same it's equal but
[1:27:32] opposite
[1:27:33] she was co-equal with him they could
[1:27:35] speak they could control
[1:27:36] she was complementary to his purpose and
[1:27:38] suited to help him finish his job
[1:27:40] and they had to be fruitful multiply and
[1:27:42] replenish which means
[1:27:43] fill it up to completion it didn't mean
[1:27:45] have babies till there's no more room it
[1:27:47] was just there was a set thing
[1:27:49] in god's mind to set order away seeds
[1:27:51] that needed to be expressed and come
[1:27:52] forth that's why brother branham says
[1:27:55] seemingly hypothetically she would
[1:27:56] eventually brought forth christ
[1:27:58] why because he had a full replenish of
[1:28:01] filling up that's when there's enough
[1:28:02] that's when my thoughts have been
[1:28:04] expressed
[1:28:05] but then as so adam though is still
[1:28:07] doing a work
[1:28:08] without the expression of the woman he's
[1:28:10] naming the beast of the field he's
[1:28:12] naming all the fouls there he's given
[1:28:13] them all names
[1:28:14] but as he's naming them all he sees the
[1:28:16] reflection in them
[1:28:17] of something that's not yet manifest yet
[1:28:20] for himself he found no
[1:28:21] mate yet for himself he found no one to
[1:28:23] help him though he's naming male female
[1:28:24] male female male female
[1:28:26] but then god inserts that into the time
[1:28:28] when he describes
[1:28:30] the woman coming forth because he wanted
[1:28:32] to realize the woman is for a purpose
[1:28:35] he want to understand it was to aid adam
[1:28:36] in fulfilling his commission and his
[1:28:38] charge
[1:28:38] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[1:28:41] earth so adam
[1:28:42] could do a lot by himself but there was
[1:28:44] one thing he couldn't do without the
[1:28:45] woman and that was multiplier
[1:28:52] and so this is part of god's original
[1:28:53] purpose not just a man
[1:28:55] not just a woman but a man and a woman
[1:28:59] and a reproduction of the man
[1:29:03] he he utters forth in prophecy
[1:29:07] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:29:09] and his mother
[1:29:10] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[1:29:12] shall be one flesh
[1:29:15] this is part of the original word what
[1:29:16] does it signify a word that signifies
[1:29:18] that there's to be
[1:29:19] more to this masterpiece therefore shall
[1:29:21] a man
[1:29:22] leave his father he's speaking it
[1:29:24] prophetically this is the word that was
[1:29:26] never finished by adam
[1:29:27] and the woman this is what you're facing
[1:29:30] today
[1:29:31] that's why brother brown begins to talk
[1:29:32] about the bride being pregnated
[1:29:35] and bringing the full word into
[1:29:36] manifestation because he says the first
[1:29:39] son adam was the spoken seed word of god
[1:29:41] he was given a bride to reproduce
[1:29:43] himself
[1:29:44] that is why the bride was given to him
[1:29:46] to reproduce himself
[1:29:47] to produce another son of god
[1:29:51] that's what the woman is for the woman
[1:29:53] is to reproduce
[1:29:54] the son of god that is what the bride
[1:29:57] was given to adam he was given
[1:29:58] he had a work to do but he could not
[1:30:00] finish the work he was given without the
[1:30:02] woman
[1:30:03] so genesis 1 28 required a wife
[1:30:07] and in this we see god the creator
[1:30:10] expressing himself in the creation
[1:30:11] but it says when god made this man there
[1:30:13] was something about him yet that didn't
[1:30:15] look just right
[1:30:16] because he had been by himself and
[1:30:18] that's how god had been by himself
[1:30:21] he was eternal and now man in the image
[1:30:23] of god also existed on earth by himself
[1:30:25] so he struck a blow over on the left
[1:30:27] side and from there he took a piece off
[1:30:29] of it
[1:30:29] and made a help meet a wife then he
[1:30:31] wasn't by himself
[1:30:32] he had somebody with him that's his
[1:30:35] great
[1:30:36] work this is god expressing himself in
[1:30:40] creation
[1:30:40] listen god when he did this to adam was
[1:30:42] showing that i will from myself
[1:30:45] bring forth a woman
[1:30:48] i'm portraying it in the beginning
[1:30:51] because he saw adam oh he's something
[1:30:53] like me
[1:30:54] i see myself so i will bring out of adam
[1:30:56] that hidden part
[1:30:57] because i have a woman hidden in me
[1:31:01] god is expressing himself in creation
[1:31:03] what god wanted to become
[1:31:05] is expressed in the beginning what god
[1:31:09] wanted to become
[1:31:10] he expresses in the beginning brother
[1:31:12] brown said the very creator that created
[1:31:14] the earth for a purpose
[1:31:16] satan defiled it what did satan defile
[1:31:21] he didn't defile the earth the very
[1:31:25] creator that created the earth for a
[1:31:27] purpose
[1:31:28] satan defiled the purpose
[1:31:32] he says in the church age but the heart
[1:31:34] purpose the eternal purpose of god was
[1:31:35] to take a bride
[1:31:37] of his own choosing and that purpose was
[1:31:40] in himself
[1:31:41] and being eternal was decreed before the
[1:31:43] foundation of the world
[1:31:46] so god's heart purpose and his eternal
[1:31:48] purpose
[1:31:49] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[1:31:52] heart purpose
[1:31:53] the thing that was central to god the
[1:31:56] thing that made him who he was
[1:31:57] when somebody has a heart purpose his
[1:31:59] eternal purpose is to have a bride of
[1:32:01] his choosing
[1:32:02] this wasn't god wanting to play doll
[1:32:06] this wasn't god trying to play house but
[1:32:08] the world is not god's sandbox
[1:32:11] we're not his beach party where he's
[1:32:12] just building something and see what
[1:32:13] happens
[1:32:14] oh look at the waves did this oh look
[1:32:16] what happened and god is just playing
[1:32:17] games
[1:32:18] with a bunch of human beings no god had
[1:32:20] a passion
[1:32:21] god had a desire god had a purpose his
[1:32:24] heart purpose the very thing that was
[1:32:25] central
[1:32:26] to god the very thing that identified
[1:32:27] his passion the very thing that
[1:32:29] identified his exercise
[1:32:30] existence his eternal purpose was to
[1:32:32] have a bride
[1:32:33] of his own choosing and it was that
[1:32:36] burning passion
[1:32:37] that climaxed into a place where he
[1:32:38] finally said i must
[1:32:40] have a bride and it was that part
[1:32:42] purpose that thrust god
[1:32:44] into a visible expression called the
[1:32:46] logos and then the full manifestation of
[1:32:48] all his attributes
[1:32:49] are the heart purpose of that logos so
[1:32:51] that every act
[1:32:52] every movement every word everything
[1:32:55] he's doing
[1:32:56] must meet that goal and that end
[1:33:01] the heart purpose of god was have a
[1:33:02] bride of his own choosing he wrote it
[1:33:04] this way it was god's purpose
[1:33:06] to bring forth a people like unto
[1:33:09] himself
[1:33:10] that would be a word bride
[1:33:14] wow that's what he wanted
[1:33:17] he wanted a word bride it was god's
[1:33:19] purpose to bring forth the people like
[1:33:21] himself that would be a word bride
[1:33:23] and for god to have what he wanted or to
[1:33:26] fulfill his purpose he had to become
[1:33:29] he couldn't just merely have he couldn't
[1:33:32] just create
[1:33:34] and have what he wanted he had to become
[1:33:37] to get what he wanted
[1:33:40] is that brother lonnie would say god
[1:33:41] didn't just want to have a family wanted
[1:33:43] to become
[1:33:43] a family
[1:33:47] it was god's purpose to bring forth the
[1:33:48] people like unto himself
[1:33:51] so christ is a mystery god revealed he
[1:33:53] says but he what he wanted to do he
[1:33:54] loved fatherhood
[1:33:55] for he was a father and the only way he
[1:33:58] could express it was to become
[1:34:00] a son of man so he wanted to be a father
[1:34:05] and the only way he could be a father
[1:34:07] was to become a son
[1:34:09] and he wanted a wife right
[1:34:12] he wanted to be a husband that's what he
[1:34:15] wanted and the only way that he could be
[1:34:17] a husband
[1:34:17] was to become a wife this is god
[1:34:21] becoming it's the only way that he
[1:34:23] he he can be known he can be felt he has
[1:34:25] to become
[1:34:26] it's not somebody we just talk about
[1:34:27] it's just not someone we worship
[1:34:29] it's somebody who's becoming you
[1:34:33] the word has been made flesh now flesh
[1:34:36] is being made word
[1:34:37] to complete god's perfect picture
[1:34:40] oh what a love story the only way he
[1:34:42] could express is to become a son of man
[1:34:44] that's why jesus kept saying son of man
[1:34:46] they didn't know what he was talking
[1:34:47] about but now you get it
[1:34:49] he wanted to express himself that was
[1:34:52] his one of his great threefold purposes
[1:34:54] was to express
[1:34:54] himself identify himself with human
[1:34:57] beings to reveal christ
[1:34:59] secondly to have preeminence in his body
[1:35:01] of believers
[1:35:02] that his bride that they might he might
[1:35:04] live in
[1:35:05] people listen the second purpose really
[1:35:08] isn't unlike the first
[1:35:10] god being expressed in one
[1:35:14] the firstborn the bridegroom jesus
[1:35:17] christ
[1:35:18] now the same god having preeminence in
[1:35:20] the individual members
[1:35:21] of the body of christ to bring forth a
[1:35:24] body a bride
[1:35:25] to which the bridegroom is the head of
[1:35:32] now this is the thought i've been
[1:35:33] building to
[1:35:35] try just to give context to these
[1:35:37] several things i want to read and try to
[1:35:38] get through very quickly
[1:35:40] to close and it is the rise of the sun
[1:35:43] and i know you've been thinking about
[1:35:44] this statement over and over again some
[1:35:45] of you
[1:35:46] but notice what leads to this statement
[1:35:48] who is the son of man
[1:35:50] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:35:51] word was with god and the word was god
[1:35:53] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:35:55] among us
[1:35:56] and if all the teaching that we have and
[1:35:58] confirmation of the word of god
[1:35:59] by by the word of god
[1:36:02] by signs by wonders we see today in
[1:36:04] quotes luke 17 30
[1:36:06] he refers to malachi chapter four he
[1:36:08] said that word again is waived
[1:36:10] over the people that the dead traditions
[1:36:12] of man is dead
[1:36:13] the son of god is alive again with the
[1:36:15] baptismal holy spirit right among us and
[1:36:17] giving us life
[1:36:18] as christ was the first one to raise
[1:36:20] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:36:21] although typed in many places he was the
[1:36:24] first fruits of those that slept
[1:36:25] so it's christ the bridegroom in the
[1:36:28] bride
[1:36:29] coming of christ now however you want to
[1:36:32] diagram this however you want to put the
[1:36:33] comma and if you were to do a sentence
[1:36:35] diagram
[1:36:36] it's all going to end up in the same
[1:36:37] place in the bride
[1:36:39] coming of christ
[1:36:42] a coming of christ in the bride or the
[1:36:45] bride
[1:36:45] coming of christ however you want to
[1:36:48] look at it the truth remains the same
[1:36:50] coming out of the church there'll have
[1:36:51] to be a sheep waved again in the last
[1:36:53] days
[1:36:54] so he refers to this concept and i don't
[1:36:56] believe that brethren is just tripping
[1:36:57] over his words and accidentally saying
[1:36:59] something
[1:37:00] in the bride coming of christ in the
[1:37:02] bride the coming of christ into her
[1:37:04] he's to return back again it is people
[1:37:07] in human beings you are
[1:37:10] the expression of his coming today
[1:37:13] embrace it
[1:37:14] don't let the critics chase you away
[1:37:16] from it that's our secret
[1:37:19] that's why there's power that's why
[1:37:21] there's manifestations of healing
[1:37:23] that's why we can stand above the
[1:37:24] nonsense that's why we can walk into a
[1:37:26] new body
[1:37:27] because we've received the promised word
[1:37:29] for this day
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:33] in the bride coming of christ and then
[1:37:35] he revisits it in paragraph 29 242
[1:37:38] remember he went there with you in him
[1:37:42] talking about on the cross god never
[1:37:43] separated the bride from the groom
[1:37:46] yet so when god looked down upon the
[1:37:48] body of christ
[1:37:49] he saw both male and female it was all
[1:37:51] redeemed in that one body
[1:37:53] they are one same same word same word
[1:37:57] spoke of the groom
[1:37:58] speaks of the bride don't you dare try
[1:38:00] to separate the bride from christ
[1:38:02] you cannot make them two separate things
[1:38:05] they have got to be viewed the same word
[1:38:06] that speaks of the groom
[1:38:08] it speaks of the bride he says those
[1:38:10] same words spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:38:12] the bride
[1:38:12] well how can the bride come and fail to
[1:38:14] manifest everything was promised of him
[1:38:17] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:38:20] the bride
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] how could he how could he come and not
[1:38:27] be the bride this is the part that was
[1:38:31] missing
[1:38:31] we see christ the word god fully
[1:38:34] manifested
[1:38:35] in one man but there had to be the full
[1:38:39] expression
[1:38:39] of the word and the woman
[1:38:43] and we are now the climax of that body
[1:38:46] that's been building from the moment the
[1:38:48] holy ghost fell
[1:38:49] on the day of pentecost god began to
[1:38:52] make up his body
[1:38:53] and you're the capstone to that body
[1:38:57] you're married to that first outpouring
[1:39:00] that point is part of you every age is
[1:39:02] the age of the holy ghost to the true
[1:39:04] believer
[1:39:05] we cannot separate ourselves from it but
[1:39:07] we must recognize the word today
[1:39:10] that's being fulfilled
[1:39:14] and the groom come and he wouldn't be
[1:39:15] the bride
[1:39:18] god of this evil age he says the word
[1:39:20] bride heading up in the person
[1:39:22] of the word of god made manifest in this
[1:39:25] evil age
[1:39:27] the word bride is the heading up
[1:39:30] of the person of the word heading up in
[1:39:33] the person
[1:39:34] of the word of god all right
[1:39:38] it's so wonderful christ revealed in his
[1:39:41] own word
[1:39:41] now in this last days he has promised to
[1:39:45] manifest himself in the fullness again
[1:39:48] of his flesh in spirit
[1:39:52] for as it was in the days of sodom so
[1:39:54] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:39:55] man
[1:39:56] now look at the sodom how it's set in
[1:39:58] what taken place and jesus christ
[1:40:01] being manifested in bodily form of his
[1:40:04] church
[1:40:05] today it's the becoming god
[1:40:15] he said god was in the beginning he kept
[1:40:16] coming down
[1:40:18] through the prophets and on down until
[1:40:20] god himself became human like us
[1:40:22] plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a
[1:40:24] baby born in the manger hated rejected
[1:40:25] despised and a bad name
[1:40:26] and everything he was then he started
[1:40:29] rising
[1:40:30] and from the feet he began to build the
[1:40:31] church the bride
[1:40:33] coming back and now coming into the
[1:40:36] headstone
[1:40:38] where it all joins together and makes
[1:40:39] that one great
[1:40:41] transfigured body of jesus christ
[1:40:45] can you see now why he says and christ
[1:40:47] is a mystery god revealed she has now
[1:40:48] risen by the power the vindicated word
[1:40:52] promised to her
[1:40:54] not just risen from the dark ages
[1:40:57] but from the beginning from his bosom
[1:41:01] from his heart from the very thoughts to
[1:41:03] flesh
[1:41:04] she's now risen she now stands on her
[1:41:07] feet
[1:41:09] and i'm going to read through this very
[1:41:10] quickly now christ is a mystery god
[1:41:11] revealed i'm going to hit him real fast
[1:41:13] now god's great secret he had before the
[1:41:16] world begin back in the back part of
[1:41:19] god's mind
[1:41:20] there was something that he was trying
[1:41:22] and go is going to achieve
[1:41:24] and he had a motive in doing it in order
[1:41:26] to let himself be expressed
[1:41:28] so this is something in the back part of
[1:41:30] god's mind something that he's going to
[1:41:32] achieve
[1:41:33] he says in the countdown he says and
[1:41:35] he's able to achieve to himself
[1:41:37] a bride he is going to in the last days
[1:41:40] be able to get a bride that with the
[1:41:41] ministry that so exactly
[1:41:43] like a man and his wife becomes one and
[1:41:45] when jehovah gets his people like him
[1:41:47] then he lives in his people they are one
[1:41:50] it fulfills the scripture he quotes john
[1:41:52] 14 12 luke 17 30.
[1:41:54] it's actually fulfilling hosea 2 23. it
[1:41:56] fulfills revelations 21.
[1:42:01] he's able to achieve himself a bride
[1:42:03] back in the back part of god's mind
[1:42:05] there was something he's trying
[1:42:06] and going to achieve what does he say
[1:42:09] there's going to come a super
[1:42:10] royal seat of abraham there's to be a
[1:42:12] spiritual bride raise up
[1:42:14] she's to come on the scenes in the last
[1:42:16] days and talking about the sheep being
[1:42:18] waved from all the prophets there came
[1:42:20] the son of god
[1:42:21] so after all the prophets and the jewish
[1:42:22] old church ages
[1:42:24] there came christ the lord the sheep
[1:42:26] waving
[1:42:27] but he says there's been many churches
[1:42:28] churches brides brides churches brides
[1:42:30] brides
[1:42:31] but there's got to come one hallelujah
[1:42:33] there has to come a real bride
[1:42:35] there must come one that's got the
[1:42:37] mechanics but the dynamics also makes
[1:42:39] that church live
[1:42:40] and move in the power of his
[1:42:42] resurrection what there had to be
[1:42:44] another one waved
[1:42:45] how is he waved in the flesh of his
[1:42:47] bride again
[1:42:50] there has to come a real bride why
[1:42:52] because there was something in the back
[1:42:53] part of god's mind
[1:42:54] something that he was trying to achieve
[1:42:56] he says he's achieved himself a bride
[1:42:58] paragraph 203 of christ's mystery and
[1:43:00] those things typed him just in tight but
[1:43:02] yet the mystery was hid
[1:43:04] so even though things typed him there
[1:43:06] was a mystery hid them men didn't know
[1:43:08] what they were doing they only knew what
[1:43:09] they were led by the spirit to do
[1:43:11] now holding it back in the last days for
[1:43:14] the great revelation
[1:43:15] but expressing himself in moses david
[1:43:17] joseph elijah on down through
[1:43:19] didn't he say the church ages manifested
[1:43:22] reflected and foreshadowed the coming of
[1:43:23] a perfect bride
[1:43:25] just as the old testament reflected the
[1:43:26] coming of a perfect bridegroom he says
[1:43:28] yes
[1:43:28] we could take each one of those prophets
[1:43:30] and bring their lives out and show
[1:43:31] it expressed jesus christ perfectly yet
[1:43:34] never given a secret in full
[1:43:36] waiting for it to be make known in the
[1:43:39] last days as he promised
[1:43:40] waiting for it to be fully comprehensive
[1:43:42] before he could express it
[1:43:44] if he told the whole thing but what's
[1:43:47] the only part that's missing
[1:43:48] the bride that was in him in his first
[1:43:51] expression
[1:43:52] he'll have it have to manifest himself
[1:43:54] in christ so god
[1:43:56] in the first purpose of the threefold
[1:43:57] purpose fully manifest himself in christ
[1:44:00] and we can say that's very good but then
[1:44:02] god would say it's not good
[1:44:04] because they're still yet a wife in him
[1:44:07] because there's a wife in me and in
[1:44:10] order for me
[1:44:11] to be a husband which christ is i must
[1:44:14] also become the wife in order to have
[1:44:17] what i always wanted in my heart it's
[1:44:20] the becoming god
[1:44:24] he says it was never given out in full
[1:44:27] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[1:44:29] before he could express it so he says
[1:44:32] it's all
[1:44:33] the last days when this great mystery
[1:44:36] that god had in his heart
[1:44:37] is being revealed what's the mystery he
[1:44:39] had in his heart
[1:44:40] to have a bride of his own choosing to
[1:44:42] have a woman like unto himself
[1:44:44] now that is asking a lot
[1:44:48] i want a woman who is just like me is
[1:44:51] what god said
[1:44:53] and there's only one person who could do
[1:44:54] that god himself
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:58] continue christ's mystery now when
[1:45:00] christ in the church is just be
[1:45:01] christ in the church is just being made
[1:45:03] known wait huh what
[1:45:06] it's just now being made known something
[1:45:08] different than what it was
[1:45:10] before he was he was in it he was there
[1:45:12] but now this prophecy
[1:45:14] this scripture this day this fulfillment
[1:45:16] is just being made known
[1:45:17] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[1:45:20] to take eve back to the right position
[1:45:22] again with her husband
[1:45:22] and god is the husband of the church and
[1:45:24] the church is his bride
[1:45:26] i'm just sharing these so you can hear
[1:45:28] christ is the mystery god in that
[1:45:29] context of what i've
[1:45:30] of this hour and a half i've been
[1:45:31] preaching already he says
[1:45:34] christ life in you makes him the center
[1:45:36] of the revelation
[1:45:38] christ and the bible makes the bible the
[1:45:39] complete revelation of christ
[1:45:41] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:45:44] revelation of the whole thing
[1:45:46] see what god is trying to do
[1:45:49] you cannot elevate christ at the expense
[1:45:51] of his bride
[1:45:52] to do so means you're not lifting up
[1:45:54] christ
[1:45:55] if you lift up christ at the expense of
[1:45:57] his body what christ are you lifting up
[1:46:00] it must be another gospel it has to be
[1:46:03] another jesus
[1:46:04] because you cannot lift up christ
[1:46:06] without drawing the bride
[1:46:08] unto him if i be lifted
[1:46:12] up my wife will be drawn unto me because
[1:46:15] she is me
[1:46:16] she's my bone she's my life she's my
[1:46:18] flesh she's my power
[1:46:24] and he comes to the very end paragraph 4
[1:46:28] 57
[1:46:29] elohim god manifest in flesh
[1:46:33] jesus showing that he himself god and
[1:46:35] him
[1:46:37] will be manifested in his bride in the
[1:46:38] last days what was the sign what was the
[1:46:41] symbol
[1:46:42] what was that meeting with abraham
[1:46:45] he stepped down into earth angels what
[1:46:49] was he doing he's never done this before
[1:46:50] like this
[1:46:51] he's created a body here he is elohim
[1:46:54] is walking with angels they've made
[1:46:56] bodies too and he's coming up to abraham
[1:46:58] he says i want to show you something i'm
[1:47:00] going to send two messengers down into
[1:47:01] laodicea
[1:47:03] but i'm going to stay up here with
[1:47:04] abraham in the elect group
[1:47:07] i'm going to talk to abraham because one
[1:47:09] day there's going to be a branham
[1:47:11] that i'm going to use to speak to my
[1:47:12] elect and i'm going to give a sign
[1:47:14] to sarah in the tent behind me and the
[1:47:16] very first thing they ask about when
[1:47:18] they come up to abraham was
[1:47:19] where's your wife
[1:47:22] listen there was only one who had a
[1:47:25] message for her but the others were
[1:47:26] talking about her but there was only one
[1:47:28] hallelujah only one
[1:47:30] that had a message for her so the other
[1:47:32] two had to go down in laodicea
[1:47:34] but the one who had a message for her
[1:47:36] remained
[1:47:38] hallelujah and i will visit the
[1:47:40] according to the time of life
[1:47:42] and he came to her and she conceived and
[1:47:45] brought forth the sun
[1:47:46] what was he foreshadowing the bride in
[1:47:48] the last days
[1:47:49] that's pregnant with the word and brings
[1:47:52] forth
[1:47:52] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:47:54] and forever
[1:47:57] he has visited you according to the time
[1:47:59] of life
[1:48:03] elohim what was he showing that he
[1:48:06] himself god and him will be manifested
[1:48:08] in the bride in the last days
[1:48:09] oh my my just no into it just a
[1:48:12] revelation of god it's eternal
[1:48:13] it just keeps moving on and on and on
[1:48:16] like this sermon
[1:48:22] i forgot to tell you guys at the
[1:48:23] beginning i'm just fishing
[1:48:25] just fishing today and brother bear said
[1:48:28] time's not allotted to a man while he's
[1:48:30] fishing just fishing
[1:48:35] now
[1:48:39] let me just in end it with this
[1:48:42] we'll ask the musicians to come
[1:48:46] i want to i want to make this personal
[1:48:47] to you
[1:48:54] you are now made in things that ought to
[1:48:57] be
[1:48:58] december 5th 1965
[1:49:02] you are now made you're set in this
[1:49:05] church because your duty
[1:49:07] is to express god to this nation
[1:49:10] and this people and this neighborhood
[1:49:12] where you associate wherever you are god
[1:49:14] knew that you would be here
[1:49:15] because you have to be one of his genes
[1:49:17] or his attributes you had to be
[1:49:20] now if we are those attributes of god we
[1:49:22] cannot live by creeds
[1:49:24] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:49:27] must live by the word because the bride
[1:49:28] is part of the bridegroom
[1:49:30] like any wife is part of her husband
[1:49:32] therefore we must
[1:49:34] be that word bride
[1:49:37] and he says and what is that word bride
[1:49:41] i'm glad he asked the questions who is
[1:49:43] this melchizedek
[1:49:45] why because he had the answer
[1:49:48] and what was that word bride what is
[1:49:50] that word brian the manifestation of
[1:49:52] this hour
[1:49:53] the bride not a creed or denomination
[1:49:56] but a living oracle of god
[1:49:57] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:50:00] the world the attributes of god
[1:50:01] in the formation of the bride that's to
[1:50:04] be expressed
[1:50:05] in this hour that we're now living
[1:50:10] you are the message of the hour the
[1:50:12] reflection of it
[1:50:14] he says one place you are jesus the
[1:50:17] reflection that's come up to this
[1:50:20] the missing part the hidden revelation
[1:50:23] the missing generation
[1:50:24] you count the generations in the book of
[1:50:26] matthew and it says there's forty
[1:50:28] so forty uh two generations there's one
[1:50:30] missing
[1:50:31] you are the missing generation you are
[1:50:34] the generation of his coming
[1:50:38] you're the other part that was hidden in
[1:50:39] him though
[1:50:41] shown in type and reflected in type and
[1:50:43] though uh
[1:50:44] unfolding in different ways to the
[1:50:46] church ages it now comes to this
[1:50:48] the full word is to be born into
[1:50:50] manifestation again
[1:50:55] brother abraham says the identified
[1:50:56] masterpiece of god he is making a bride
[1:50:58] yes sir he's you and the chips now
[1:51:01] chopping off the world
[1:51:03] and you got to make this personal it's
[1:51:06] making a bride
[1:51:07] chopping off the world oh church joining
[1:51:09] creed's denominations dogmas all has to
[1:51:11] be put away from the church
[1:51:12] their formal ideas their indifference
[1:51:14] their doctrines their things
[1:51:16] come back and let the master pick up the
[1:51:19] ball
[1:51:21] some of you church has a bad taste in
[1:51:22] your mouth all because of these creeds
[1:51:25] church joining dogmas
[1:51:26] formal ideas and different doctrines and
[1:51:28] things come back
[1:51:31] come back let the master pick up the bow
[1:51:34] that would be my invitation to anyone
[1:51:36] searching god come back
[1:51:38] anybody who's been hurt by this message
[1:51:40] you know we've been hurt
[1:51:42] by this message and the paradox is the
[1:51:44] same thing that hurts
[1:51:46] is the same thing that's going to heal
[1:51:50] i i just feel compelled to share this
[1:51:54] the word hurts and it heals
[1:51:58] and this message can be preached in a
[1:51:59] way that's very cutting
[1:52:01] it can itself intend to hurt
[1:52:04] a and to bring a conviction and bring a
[1:52:06] sense of guilt
[1:52:08] but then it can be used to cause the
[1:52:09] wrong kind of hurt to bring a sense of
[1:52:12] shame and to abuse us and it causes
[1:52:13] scars and complex
[1:52:15] and the very people wielding the quote
[1:52:17] unquote message of the hour
[1:52:18] can drive us away but you're going to
[1:52:21] have to come back to the message for
[1:52:22] your healing
[1:52:25] the very thing that caused your greatest
[1:52:26] pain is the only thing that's probably
[1:52:28] going to cause that's going to be able
[1:52:29] to bring the greatest healing
[1:52:31] bring it to your right mind bring a
[1:52:32] sense of balance and relief you're never
[1:52:34] going to find it fighting against the
[1:52:35] thing that hurts you you're going to
[1:52:36] have to come to the very thing that he's
[1:52:38] ordained for you
[1:52:40] and brother bam tells a story about a
[1:52:41] couple who had a child dying
[1:52:43] and because of the death of that child
[1:52:45] the house became so contentious
[1:52:46] that they agreed to have a divorce and
[1:52:48] they separated and they divorced and
[1:52:50] they had their lawyers and the lawyer
[1:52:51] told them look you're gonna have to
[1:52:52] divide up your possessions
[1:52:53] and they went to that house and brother
[1:52:55] bamboo dramatized it i'll just embellish
[1:52:56] it a little bit
[1:52:57] how they're in there saying well i want
[1:52:58] the picture no i want this picture i
[1:53:00] want the bed i want in the fighting
[1:53:01] going over everything
[1:53:02] contentious fighting back and forth they
[1:53:04] finally make it to the attic and they
[1:53:06] start going through little things they
[1:53:07] finally pull out a shoe
[1:53:09] of a baby who died that represented the
[1:53:12] very thing that ripped them apart
[1:53:15] that child the death of that child what
[1:53:17] broke their marriage
[1:53:19] but it was the very thing that brought
[1:53:21] them back
[1:53:23] it was in that face in it confronting it
[1:53:25] finding the beauty of it the joy of it
[1:53:27] the very thing that it was
[1:53:28] and coming back to the original that's
[1:53:30] what brought the healing again
[1:53:32] and listen i know it can very be very
[1:53:34] hard there's things that trigger us
[1:53:35] there's things that are toxic
[1:53:36] there's things that we just repulse us
[1:53:39] and it gets us all anxious in our
[1:53:40] stomach and nerves
[1:53:41] but come to the master let them pick up
[1:53:45] the bow
[1:53:46] i can say is my own testimony and i
[1:53:48] apologize for injecting myself
[1:53:50] but i know the master is here and you've
[1:53:53] been abused
[1:53:54] you've been violated and the violin does
[1:53:56] not seem to give a great sound
[1:53:58] but oh let the master let the master
[1:54:01] pick up the bow
[1:54:05] come back let the master pick you up in
[1:54:08] his hands and strike the word
[1:54:10] and say jesus christ is the same
[1:54:12] yesterday today and forever
[1:54:14] amen lord if you could just bow your
[1:54:16] heads i want this to be an
[1:54:18] unction to somebody oh i think of the
[1:54:21] young people
[1:54:22] who've endured so much in this world so
[1:54:25] much
[1:54:26] by our own failings as parents so much
[1:54:28] about our ins and outs and the
[1:54:29] differences and the things that have
[1:54:30] transpired and the hurts from within and
[1:54:32] everywhere else
[1:54:33] oh there's a master there's a master
[1:54:39] he says say amen lord make me
[1:54:43] mold me make me lord what i should be
[1:54:47] then there'll be a different thing
[1:54:50] if i be lifted up from the earth i'll
[1:54:52] draw all men unto me
[1:54:54] he's cutting you out now cutting you
[1:54:57] down to his word
[1:54:58] only cutting all the creeds and dogmas
[1:55:01] and everything away from you
[1:55:03] trying to get back to a bride for the
[1:55:06] son
[1:55:07] another pastor piece part of the word
[1:55:11] let me say this to the young couples
[1:55:13] young families young
[1:55:15] brothers and sisters even in the youth
[1:55:16] group
[1:55:18] this is why things have been hard but
[1:55:21] man says in christmas why do you hunger
[1:55:23] why do you thirst it's god trying to get
[1:55:25] this great revelation to you
[1:55:27] you won't satisfy it in church joining
[1:55:28] you're not going to satisfy it in youth
[1:55:30] camps and youth means
[1:55:31] it's not going to be satisfied in a
[1:55:32] harmony among individuals it can only be
[1:55:35] satisfied in christ
[1:55:39] jesus couldn't take the place you
[1:55:42] remember when they read the day in the
[1:55:44] book
[1:55:44] he just read part of the prophecy and
[1:55:46] left the rest for this day
[1:55:48] the last day were supposed to take
[1:55:51] that part isn't that powerful jesus
[1:55:54] couldn't take this part you've got to
[1:55:55] take it
[1:55:56] so you see he has to cut he wants to cut
[1:55:59] the church
[1:56:00] out just like he did the sun out like he
[1:56:02] he did the bride and the groom to to be
[1:56:04] his bride you must be part of him
[1:56:06] no part of the creed no part of the
[1:56:08] church not part of the denomination but
[1:56:09] part of him
[1:56:10] hewed out of any kind of form won't work
[1:56:14] you've got to be hewed from the word the
[1:56:16] world cut off of you
[1:56:17] just leave the word only live in you the
[1:56:20] great sculptor is counting on you
[1:56:21] willing to stand and have you shaped
[1:56:23] yourself shaped in the likeness of his
[1:56:25] requirement that his word requires

[1:57:29] that body
[1:57:30] and the word of god in you and

[1:57:37] what you are what kind of experience you
[1:57:39] have

[1:57:42] day because
[1:57:43] god in the last days has taken a bride
[1:57:45] for his son jesus christ
[1:57:47] he says let us bow our heads if there's
[1:57:50] anyone would want to give their heart to
[1:57:51] christ today
[1:57:53] there's still water to baptize lost
[1:57:55] souls there's still a genuine experience

[1:58:10] is the new birth
[1:58:11] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:58:13] personally to you

[2:05:42] the dreams
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:06:00] is
[2:06:04] and they're beautiful however he
[2:06:05] revealed his hidden plan in this last
[2:06:07] days
[2:06:09] and that day he's come and revealed what
[2:06:11] was in his heart
[2:06:13] what he was thinking and what he's
[2:06:15] thinking
[2:06:16] is manifested in the wife what's in a
[2:06:19] man's heart
[2:06:20] is manifesting a wife what a man has
[2:06:22] planning what he's thinking
[2:06:24] what really what he is has made manifest
[2:06:26] in the wife that's why brother branham
[2:06:28] could preach christ is the mystery god
[2:06:29] revealed
[2:06:30] because the bride is the mystery of
[2:06:32] christ finished
[2:06:34] that's why you see in revelations 10 7
[2:06:36] the mystery of god
[2:06:38] should be finished because once he
[2:06:40] achieves a bride to himself
[2:06:42] the mystery he held in his heart from
[2:06:44] the beginning is finished and the rest
[2:06:46] is just housekeeping
[2:06:47] the rest is just him getting everything
[2:06:49] got to get the you have that honeymoon
[2:06:50] and then get the world ready for the
[2:06:51] eternal eden
[2:06:53] from that moment that he's achieved
[2:06:54] himself to a bride taking him to himself
[2:06:56] the rest is the
[2:06:57] unfolding to bring us back to that
[2:06:59] eternal expression where there is no end

[2:13:00] oh
[2:13:07] the whole bible was written for this day
[2:13:10] the account in genesis genesis 2 genesis
[2:13:14] 3
[2:13:14] it's written for our day
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:18] aren't you glad to be alive this day
[2:13:21] it's amazing how through the foolishness
[2:13:24] of preaching a preacher can preach words
[2:13:26] but
[2:13:27] what strikes us is more than the word
[2:13:29] something down inside
[2:13:31] amen and it triggers an emotion but it
[2:13:32] wasn't something just
[2:13:34] just on an emotional level it was
[2:13:35] something that goes all the way to the
[2:13:37] core of our being
[2:13:38] and what he was speaking was my identity
[2:13:42] he's preaching who i am amen not who i
[2:13:45] am on a birth record not who i am and
[2:13:48] and the elements of the earth that you
[2:13:49] see but who i
[2:13:50] am from the mind of god who i've always
[2:13:53] been intended to be
[2:13:56] i'm so thankful for that
[2:14:00] what was preached today is beyond us
[2:14:05] talking humanly speaking it's beyond us
[2:14:08] to be christ to be the expression of god
[2:14:13] as a wife it's beyond us
[2:14:17] and i just want to say i'm so thankful
[2:14:19] it's beyond us
[2:14:20] because all we could do is mess it up
[2:14:22] like it's been messed up before
[2:14:24] it's beyond us so he secured it in his
[2:14:27] mind before the foundation of the world
[2:14:29] it is what is happening nothing can
[2:14:31] defile it nothing can stop it friends
[2:14:34] all he's asking for us to do is yield to
[2:14:36] it he's got it all figured out
[2:14:38] he's got it already worked and he's got
[2:14:40] the power to perform it all
[2:14:42] all he's looking is for somebody to say
[2:14:44] back to him be it unto me
[2:14:46] according to thy word
[2:14:50] before we dismiss i just want to share
[2:14:52] with you a testimony i
[2:14:54] asked you on wednesday to pray with us
[2:14:56] for brother
[2:14:57] jeevaratnam marlapudi the brother in
[2:14:59] india who is from india who's here last
[2:15:01] year for
[2:15:02] two weeks when i got home wednesday

[2:15:07] on an internet call and he says god
[2:15:09] bless you brother chad thank you so much
[2:15:11] for your prayers

[2:15:15] turnaround

[2:15:20] he called me wednesdays said the doctor
[2:15:22] just left and i'm getting home about 10
[2:15:24] 10 30 at night the doctors just left
[2:15:26] and the doctor is a hindu man and the
[2:15:29] doctor says
[2:15:30] the medicine did not heal your father he
[2:15:32] said your god has healed your father
[2:15:35] amen
[2:15:40] [Applause]
[2:15:43] out of the mouth of a hindu doctor he
[2:15:46] said the medicine i gave won't do that
[2:15:48] he said that's your god and i just say
[2:15:51] praise god
[2:15:52] brother marlon booty's doing better his
[2:15:53] wife's doing better his
[2:15:55] eldest son and elle's daughter's still
[2:15:57] fighting symptoms so remember to pray
[2:15:58] for them but the god who did it for one
[2:16:00] will do it for another
[2:16:02] and thank you for being faithful in your
[2:16:04] prayers and thankful to our brother and
[2:16:06] i just so appreciate i so appreciate god
[2:16:10] so appreciate that he had a plan and he
[2:16:13] wasn't dependent on me
[2:16:15] he made a plan secure before the
[2:16:16] foundation of the world all he did was
[2:16:18] reveal it to me
[2:16:19] and when he revealed it to me he
[2:16:20] unlocked something inside of me
[2:16:23] that was locked down there under the
[2:16:25] dirt and under
[2:16:26] the hybridization and under all of the
[2:16:28] messed up situations we've come
[2:16:30] through in families and births and
[2:16:33] everything else there was something down
[2:16:35] there that was locked up and when god
[2:16:36] gave the revelation to this
[2:16:37] hour he unlocked something and that that
[2:16:41] he unlocked was his eternal purpose from
[2:16:43] for the foundation of the world and if
[2:16:45] we can just yield to that that's working
[2:16:47] within
[2:16:48] god is going to accomplish he will
[2:16:50] absolutely accomplish
[2:16:51] everything he purpose to accomplish he's
[2:16:54] going to do it in us
[2:16:56] it's beyond us and i'm thankful for that
[2:17:01] how many of you feel to be the most
[2:17:03] privileged you feel yourself to be the
[2:17:04] most privileged human being on the face
[2:17:06] of the earth to be here and to hear the
[2:17:08] things that we hear
[2:17:11] no other age no other generation nobody
[2:17:14] else knew they were going through the
[2:17:15] motions they were acting it out in time
[2:17:16] they had no idea
[2:17:19] but we're not just acting it out
[2:17:20] everything that's been acted out in type
[2:17:22] is coming to full manifestation in our
[2:17:24] lives
[2:17:25] this is the culmination of the
[2:17:26] scriptures this is the completion
[2:17:28] of the purpose from genesis and i'm so
[2:17:32] privileged to be here with you
[2:17:34] say i love you may god bless you may we
