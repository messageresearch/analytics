[0:00] do you remember the time brother branham
[0:02] was preaching
[0:04] and danny henry came up to him at the
[0:06] end of service and wrapped his arms
[0:07] around him and gave him
[0:08] a prophecy over him in french and it was
[0:10] translated
[0:12] in that prophecy it says because you've
[0:14] chosen the harder way
[0:17] the narrow path and you've done this of
[0:19] your
[0:20] own choosing listen god had already
[0:23] foreordained it he saw it before the
[0:25] foundation of the world
[0:26] do you think that prophet do you think
[0:28] he was going to go any other way
[0:31] god had already ordained it so god
[0:33] already saw it but god was still
[0:35] so pleased when he saw a man who could
[0:37] choose any way he want
[0:38] he would choose the harder way he would
[0:41] choose
[0:42] by his own choosing no force no coercion
[0:45] god not pushing him into it but he
[0:47] himself would say
[0:49] i'll take the narrow away i'll take the
[0:51] harder way
[0:53] it's so pleased god amen that when that
[0:56] man wrapped his arms around him
[0:58] he began to speak in perfect french and
[1:00] god had a human interpreter there and he
[1:02] had a woman who spoke prince there
[1:04] and another interpreter there amen and
[1:06] they all gave the interpretation and it
[1:08] all matched
[1:08] god was so pleased with a man amen what
[1:12] was he doing he was walking in the
[1:13] vision
[1:14] god had already ordained it he was doing
[1:16] what god told him to do
[1:17] but god wasn't going to shove him in a
[1:19] tube and pull him out the other end and
[1:20] said you chose
[1:22] no he had his own choice to make
[1:26] as a man as an individual representative
[1:29] of a human being with the seed of god on
[1:31] the inside he had
[1:33] choice and when he chose what was in
[1:35] god's mind
[1:36] god was delighted with his choice
[1:40] are we the bride of jesus christ i
[1:41] believe with all my heart i am
[1:43] as he saw me cross the finish line
[1:45] absolutely am i going to be perfected by
[1:47] the washing of the water this word
[1:49] i know it but he's still
[1:52] watching for my choice and i want to
[1:54] please him with my choice
[1:56] i want to make the joy i want to go the
[1:58] narrow way
[2:00] i want to take the harder choice i want
[2:02] to sacrifice myself i want to surrender
[2:04] all
[2:05] i want to make the choice that will
[2:06] cause him to say you've chosen
[2:09] of your own choice in the precise and
[2:11] correct way and it is
[2:12] my way oh there's nothing that would
[2:16] make me happier than to hear him say
[2:18] that about me
[2:19] you chose you chose of your own choosing
[2:21] i didn't make you
[2:22] i didn't force you but you wanted to
[2:26] i said god i know
[2:30] there's going to be a bride in this end
[2:31] time that's going to choose his way
[2:34] she won't take her away it's already
[2:37] been prophesied
[2:39] it's already been spoken it's already in
[2:41] god's mind
[2:42] it's already set and it's sealed there
[2:44] will be a bride who won't fall white if
[2:47] the way he felt she won't fall by her
[2:49] own carnal lust and her own will
[2:54] but she's gonna do so of her own
[2:55] choosing
[2:56] [Music]
[2:58] because she wants to
