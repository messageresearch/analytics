[0:00] he has been kind enough to send me a
[0:03] prophet to come in the form of a prophet
[0:06] and reveal himself to me as his son what
[0:09] he hath taught me before he is teaching
[0:12] me
[0:13] now what more could I ask for amen I
[0:17] find it
[0:19] astounding that this is a son that could
[0:22] stand there and look his father in the
[0:24] eye and say I have done all of your
[0:27] Commandments and I have not aired one
[0:29] time time and his father didn't correct
[0:31] him he didn't say well there was this
[0:33] time you did he stands there and he says
[0:35] I have done everything and I've kept all
[0:38] your
[0:41] Commandments but he still had jealousy
[0:43] laying in his
[0:45] heart he was still more concerned about
[0:48] his brother's position and his brother's
[0:50] reception than he was about his own
[0:53] position that's why I say getting all
[0:55] the teachings and all the doctrines to
[0:58] me that's not it that comes with it and
[1:01] I will never say that that's not
[1:02] important because it's extremely
[1:04] important but I believe that you can
[1:06] have such an intellectual power and an
[1:08] intellectual understanding and a
[1:11] legalistic ability to do what is right
[1:13] and what is what is uh true and I like I
[1:17] said I don't belittle any of that I
[1:19] should I say we should be more like
[1:21] that but at the end of the day the
[1:24] problem here with this son even though
[1:27] he can say I've done everything you've
[1:28] asked me to do the problem was he still
[1:31] had something laying in his
[1:33] heart he still had jealousy laying in
[1:36] his heart and the father had to come and
[1:39] deal with that he had to come and remind
[1:41] him it doesn't matter about anybody else
[1:44] what matters is you're my son and all
[1:47] that I have is thine quit worrying about
[1:50] your brother and I would just say me
[1:53] personally that I don't ever want to
[1:54] find myself in that position I don't
[1:56] want to ever find myself in the seat of
[1:58] the scornful of somebody who's went
[2:00] Wayward and somebody who's lost track
[2:03] but they would come with a repentant
[2:04] heart I I pray to God that I would never
[2:06] have that in my life that I would come
[2:09] and say well Lord I've served you for x
[2:11] amount of years and I've done this and
[2:12] I've sacrificed this and you're blessing
[2:14] that person and you know they just they
[2:16] just came back two weeks ago and look at
[2:18] all that they've
[2:21] done I want to be there putting the robe
[2:24] on him putting the ring on his finger
[2:28] helping Phil dress that cow
[2:31] I want to be cooking the meat for him I
[2:33] want to be rejoicing and I want to be
[2:35] merry regardless of how Wayward and how
[2:38] long that it's been I want to
[2:41] respond with the power of the
[2:44] Revelation that I am a son of this
[2:48] father and a wayward son has
[2:52] returned what can I do to help him what
[2:54] can I do to assist him how can I
[2:56] encourage him or
[2:58] her I want to respond
[3:01] correctly
