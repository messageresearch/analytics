========================================

when the church is rejected Christ in this day they put the light away from them and light separates Darkness from light that's why you can't stay in the system or your own system or separated from the light in any way whether in another church or in your own mind you can't stay separated from the light and expect to come to life we can only come to life amen when we stay in the presence of the sun and the sun brings the word that's in us to life and then all of a sudden when you realize what this is we become so grateful that God has rescued us out of the darkness amen because where did laodicea go it went into a total blackout amen is signified by the blackout of the moon and the eclipse the seventh picture wasn't even in the paper because it was totally black showing that the church has gone into apostasy we could never come to life there we had to come to life under the word for our day and all of a sudden all I can say is thank you God because I had no power to produce the light I had nothing in me that could make the light to shine to bring what was buried deep inside of this Earth to life amen and and who knew that laying under this part of dirt was life just like you go he types it with the creation amen back in Genesis 1 there's dirt everywhere who knows where there's germinated seed laying amen who knew who could walk and say there's a palm tree there's an oak tree this spot here who would know but God but God was going to show where the seed was and the way he would manifest the seed was to shine the light and when he shined the light it would manifest the sea so who knew that in Lima Ohio or Cincinnati Ohio or Lebanon Ohio or wherever you happen to be to be who knew that down in that patch of dirt was a seed amen who knew there was a sieging of God who could point and say that's one and that's nobody could you were just dead earth like the the beginning at the beginning of Genesis but God shined the light in this day through the message of the hour and when you came in contact with that line he showed where his seed was it was laying in that patch of dirt there and that patch of dirt there and that patch of dirt there and it wasn't because we decided to be something it wasn't because we changed our mind it was because he planted that seed in this dirt before the foundation of the world and he made the light to shine we didn't make the light to shine and that light began to pull something out of the seed it wasn't what we did it's what we surrendered ourselves to that's what the word did the word that was shining in this day and the word that was trapped in my heart the word brought the word to life the light brought life and the life brings light and we didn't do anything we were just here
