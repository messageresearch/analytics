[0:38] [Music]
[0:40] here's my
[0:46] [Music]
[0:49] is that your prayer tonight
[1:05] [Music]
[1:17] [Music]
[1:24] ah
[1:29] [Music]
[1:36] [Music]
[1:38] me oh let's sing it one more time as
[1:41] brother chad comes
[1:49] i lift
[2:00] [Music]
[2:06] is
[2:13] [Music]
[2:20] jesus
[2:25] [Music]
[2:34] god bless you all praise the lord it's
[2:37] good to be here together again
[2:39] let's take our bibles while we're
[2:40] standing and turn to genesis chapter one
[2:43] we'll get right into the word this
[2:46] evening
[2:47] and i appreciate the worship the
[2:49] atmosphere of worship
[2:51] and once again i come full to
[2:54] overflowing
[2:56] but praise be to god we're trusting in
[2:58] him to do what we can't do amen
[3:01] i was i was telling the brothers i told
[3:03] several people this you know when god
[3:06] grants revelation it's such a mysterious
[3:08] thing
[3:09] because revelation doesn't come to your
[3:11] brain it comes to your heart
[3:13] all right and then god grants us some
[3:15] understanding there's things that pieces
[3:17] start to come together but
[3:19] he revelation comes to the heart and
[3:21] then when you try to process it through
[3:23] the brain and bring it out in speech and
[3:24] put it together
[3:25] the only thing you can do is mess up
[3:27] pure revelation
[3:29] you know when you go to preach it that's
[3:31] the same way god drops something into
[3:32] your heart
[3:33] and you know it's true and you know it
[3:35] you get it you got it
[3:36] but as soon as you're trying to process
[3:38] that process that through a human brain
[3:40] and speak it through human lips all of a
[3:42] sudden it begins to fall apart
[3:44] and so when you come to preaching you
[3:46] have to just have faith that god
[3:47] said by the preaching of the word
[3:49] because it's incapable
[3:51] of portraying a perfect divine
[3:53] revelation
[3:54] it's incapable but all we can do is
[3:56] preach it according to the anointing he
[3:58] gives and
[3:58] trust the holy ghost to put it together
[4:01] in the heart on the other end
[4:03] and that's the only thing we have to go
[4:04] on is that he said do it this way
[4:07] this is the way we're going to do it and
[4:09] we have faith in him so i just
[4:10] appreciate you pulling on the gift and
[4:12] bearing with me
[4:13] amen as i tried to just share what's on
[4:15] my heart or continuing on in the
[4:17] same subject of the the gaps or whatever
[4:21] we titled it but something about gaps in
[4:22] the book of revelation
[4:24] but but praise the lord we're just going
[4:26] to continue down that vein and
[4:27] trust that god will continue to open
[4:29] more and more to us and
[4:30] and i'd like to say again i'm not going
[4:32] to say everything right because i
[4:34] i i'm treading down this path that god's
[4:37] leading down
[4:38] and i may get i may say something wrong
[4:41] i may just get some date in the wrong
[4:42] place i may say something wrong
[4:44] so don't fixate on one phrase that i say
[4:47] i think he was wrong there
[4:48] look at the picture that's being painted
[4:50] because that's the real important part
[4:51] because i'm going to mess something up
[4:53] along the way i can guarantee that
[4:55] so don't look at that one single brush
[4:57] stroke down in the corner and be like
[4:58] ah brother chad i think a little blue
[5:00] green would have been better than blue
[5:03] and you're probably right but the point
[5:06] is what's the picture that's being
[5:07] painted let's see the picture together
[5:10] amen don't lock down on one thing and
[5:12] and if there's something that's a little
[5:13] bit not right god will straighten it up
[5:15] i'm sure of it
[5:16] amen and god will use the body to do
[5:18] that too but let's look at the picture
[5:19] that's being painted
[5:20] and see what god's sharing with us in
[5:23] this hour that we
[5:24] live let's look here at revelation
[5:26] chapter 1 verse 1 again
[5:28] i want to get very familiar with this
[5:30] because if we can bring up the
[5:31] powerpoint
[5:32] we'll see we're going to show this
[5:33] picture of the bible again and in my
[5:36] bible in this bible it says the
[5:37] revelation of saint john the divine
[5:39] at wrong
[5:43] verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ
[5:46] that's what we want to understand as we
[5:48] begin to read this book of revelation
[5:50] in revelation chapter 1 verse 1 we want
[5:53] to recognize that this is the revelation
[5:55] of jesus christ
[5:56] that's why this book matters so much to
[5:59] us and that's why god was sent a prophet
[6:01] in our day to bring us through the book
[6:02] of revelation
[6:03] because this book is the revelation of
[6:06] jesus christ
[6:07] it's the capstone to the bible it's the
[6:09] headstone
[6:10] and so let's read this again the
[6:12] revelation of jesus christ which god
[6:14] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[6:16] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:18] and he sent and signified it by his
[6:20] angel
[6:21] unto his servant john do you see
[6:24] yourself in that verse
[6:26] i don't know about you but i see myself
[6:27] in that verse and when i see myself in
[6:29] that verse i see an angel and i see
[6:31] myself
[6:32] and i see the revelation and i get
[6:33] pretty excited amen
[6:35] let's just bow our heads and pray dear
[6:38] lord jesus we thank you for this day and
[6:40] this
[6:41] privilege lord to be together we ask all
[6:44] that you would take
[6:45] lord this flawed human vessel lord
[6:48] this these lips of clay lord with all
[6:51] the inabilities lord and all the
[6:53] nervousness and everything that goes
[6:54] with it i pray that you would just pick
[6:56] that up in your hand
[6:57] and use it for your glory lord i pray
[7:00] that you administer your word lord
[7:02] right into our hearts lord and let it
[7:04] grow in in our hearts and begin to bear
[7:06] fruit lord
[7:07] for that's why you sent your word to us
[7:09] to bear the fruit of your very own life
[7:11] i pray lord that you would just grant
[7:13] that you could have preeminence in this
[7:15] place that you would drive out every
[7:16] wrong idea every wrong spirit lord
[7:19] and that you would present your word to
[7:20] your bride in jesus christ's name we
[7:22] pray
[7:23] amen you can all be seated
[7:27] i'm going to hit a little bit of review
[7:30] we've been
[7:30] talking the last few services and as we
[7:32] go through there's so much information
[7:35] i don't want to get lost in the
[7:37] information so that we miss the picture
[7:39] because the picture's
[7:40] important not all the information
[7:42] although i love all the details every
[7:43] detail to me matters
[7:45] every little tiny detail i get excited
[7:47] about it matters to me
[7:49] but the more important than catching
[7:51] every detail of everything i say is
[7:52] catching the picture amen catching the
[7:54] revelation
[7:55] the vein of what god is trying to bring
[7:57] so i'm going to try my very best to do
[7:59] review
[8:00] do some review and then take another
[8:01] step and do some review and take another
[8:03] step
[8:04] and brother finger's got the whiteboard
[8:06] app hooked up here for me in case
[8:08] i get off on a tangent which i love
[8:10] getting off in a tangent
[8:12] but i don't want to i don't want to do
[8:13] anything confusing i don't want to do
[8:15] too much i just want to take bites out
[8:17] of this
[8:18] and let god reveal it to us when when
[8:21] brother banham preached the seals he
[8:23] said my bible became a new book
[8:25] and and we know that we're familiar with
[8:27] that but you have to remember
[8:28] brother brennan was a prophet all the
[8:30] way through and he was a prophet all the
[8:32] way through and god was giving
[8:34] revelation on the word
[8:35] all the way through i mean he caught
[8:37] serpent seed
[8:38] water baptism in jesus name the oneness
[8:40] of the god and all of these things he
[8:42] was preaching before the seals
[8:44] and god was given it by divine
[8:45] revelation to him and sometimes by
[8:47] vision
[8:48] he was telling him amen he would have
[8:50] three rainbows appear
[8:52] not just in vision but three literal
[8:53] rainbows appear and all going to one
[8:55] place
[8:55] when he was out hunting and then a voice
[8:57] would say amen
[8:59] the voice would say jehovah of the old
[9:01] testament is jesus of the new
[9:03] so this is divine leadership and
[9:05] interpretation of the bible
[9:07] and brother branham had it throughout
[9:08] his ministry right and he was a prophet
[9:11] all the way along
[9:11] but even after all of that he said after
[9:14] the seals my bible became a new book to
[9:16] me
[9:17] that means this is this is something
[9:19] amazing
[9:20] for a man like that who've been
[9:22] preaching all of those years
[9:23] as a prophet with divine revelation
[9:26] still when he came to the seals and saw
[9:28] the opening of the seals his bible
[9:30] became a new book
[9:31] he says when those seals come open he
[9:32] said that opened up the entire bible
[9:35] so so that means for brother bannon it
[9:37] wasn't that
[9:38] he learned new verses it wasn't that he
[9:40] got a new version of the bible
[9:42] but all of a sudden another layer was
[9:45] peeled off of the bible
[9:46] so that he could see it in another way
[9:48] or see it in a new way or
[9:50] i would should say maybe see it in a
[9:51] deeper way
[9:54] and and begin to see the bible although
[9:56] he knew this and preaches but see the
[9:58] bible for me i'll just take my
[10:00] my own personal experience to begin to
[10:01] see the bible as one story
[10:05] not as separate books and separate
[10:06] stories but to see the bible as
[10:08] one story to see the bible old testament
[10:11] new testament the whole thing
[10:12] see the bible trying to declare one
[10:15] purpose
[10:16] one goal that god had in the back part
[10:19] of his mind
[10:20] and the whole bible has been trying to
[10:21] express this one thing
[10:23] that god has wanted to express and he
[10:25] divided it into three parts
[10:28] get preeminence in a man he did that in
[10:30] christ jesus preeminence and a bride
[10:32] he's doing that now in a people he's
[10:33] doing that now amen and to return them
[10:35] back to eden
[10:36] amen now all of a sudden everything in
[10:39] the bible
[10:40] lines up with that one purpose god had
[10:43] the one goal the one thing that he
[10:45] wanted to achieve
[10:46] in all the bible amen
[10:49] so when we when we get down in uh
[10:53] details and start to say well i'm
[10:54] confused i'm i'm missing all this
[10:56] back up and say what's the whole purpose
[10:58] the old purpose
[11:00] is for god amen to get one man and his
[11:03] bride
[11:04] back together again on the earth fully
[11:06] portraying what god is
[11:09] that's the whole purpose every type
[11:11] every shadow
[11:12] every story in the bible has been trying
[11:14] to tell this story
[11:15] so that we can come to the very end
[11:17] after after
[11:18] thousands of years of of compiling the
[11:21] bible through different prophets and
[11:23] different writers
[11:24] getting it all together so that a
[11:25] prophet could come at the end time and
[11:27] point it back and say this has
[11:28] all been telling one story and that one
[11:31] story is god
[11:33] wanted to be known amen so he separated
[11:35] himself into attributes and god wanted
[11:37] to be known by his attributes and
[11:39] display himself in his attributes and
[11:40] have fellowship together
[11:42] as a family of attributes and to do it
[11:44] that way
[11:45] he first showed the perfect image of it
[11:48] in eden
[11:48] he let it fall so that he could sow his
[11:51] seed into all the earth
[11:52] and bring them right back to where they
[11:54] were and all of the seed all of these
[11:56] attributes
[11:57] would know him who he was they would
[12:00] know him because they went through the
[12:01] contrast of evil
[12:02] through the contrast of black and
[12:04] darkness so that they would now
[12:06] understand god because the angels
[12:09] worshiped god and they saw him as
[12:11] almighty god an all-powerful god and
[12:13] creator
[12:13] of heavens and earth but they didn't
[12:15] understand
[12:16] god because they never experienced good
[12:19] and evil
[12:23] so god allowed all of this so that he
[12:26] could express himself
[12:28] so that god could be expressed as a
[12:31] family
[12:32] attributes that he could fellowship
[12:33] together with his family
[12:36] and be known by those who would love him
[12:39] and worship him
[12:40] and to do it he created the image of
[12:42] male
[12:43] and female amen let it fall so that he
[12:46] could get back the perfect male which
[12:47] was jesus christ
[12:48] to redeem back all that was lost to
[12:50] bring amen the female
[12:52] which is his bride unite them back
[12:54] together and put them back in eden
[12:58] so when all the information just gets to
[13:01] be information and we lose sight of that
[13:02] we need to back up again
[13:04] and look at the picture again and then
[13:06] when you go back down to the information
[13:09] every story every detail everything that
[13:12] brother branham was preaching
[13:14] is all pointing to the same story
[13:18] so we just don't want to get lost
[13:22] in the details but we don't want to say
[13:25] the details don't matter because they
[13:26] all matter
[13:27] every jot and every tittle matters
[13:32] and what the prophet said matters
[13:35] and i'm gonna have to fix something on
[13:37] my tablet
[13:40] all right now we're back in business
[13:43] okay
[13:44] let's just keep going a little further
[13:49] he said this is the quote that i've used
[13:51] each time we'll walk in the light the
[13:53] beautiful light one step at a time lord
[13:55] coming closer to him
[13:57] yeah children of the light accept his
[13:58] word keep walking
[14:00] and watch more unfold don't leave it no
[14:02] matter what somebody else says
[14:04] to me that's the most important part of
[14:06] the phrase don't leave it no matter how
[14:08] many critics say it's not right
[14:10] how many doubts they can show you how
[14:12] many conflicts they can show in the
[14:14] message or conflicts in the life of
[14:16] brother ben
[14:17] don't leave this word don't move away
[14:20] from it
[14:21] amen because that's all distractions
[14:23] trying to get us to turn our head and
[14:24] move away
[14:25] but if we'll stick with it and keep
[14:27] moving forward with the word
[14:28] you watch it'll unfold itself
[14:32] but everybody the the attributes the
[14:35] seed of god
[14:36] must be tested to see if they have faith
[14:39] and in that test
[14:40] he'll let he'll let discrepancies come
[14:43] to the surface
[14:44] seeming discrepancies he'll let
[14:46] inconsistencies come to the service
[14:48] he'll let problems come to the service
[14:50] and wrong dates and
[14:52] and wrong whatever and he'll show you
[14:54] where or
[14:55] you know he'll allow the enemy to show
[14:57] you where brother branham
[14:58] gave a figure two or three different
[15:00] places concerning the same event or the
[15:02] same day
[15:03] like when he's baptizing and the ohio
[15:06] river
[15:06] right if you look at the quotes brother
[15:09] bram says he was baptizing in june he
[15:10] was baptizing in july
[15:12] and he was baptizing in august
[15:15] there was 500 on the bank there was a
[15:18] thousand on the bank there was 5 000
[15:19] people on the bank
[15:21] right and sometimes it was 1930 and
[15:24] sometimes it was 1933
[15:26] if you look at all the quotes right
[15:30] but one thing never changes is he was
[15:32] baptizing the 17th person
[15:34] and a pillar of fire came down
[15:37] because it wasn't important in the month
[15:40] it wasn't important exactly the day
[15:42] the important part of that story is the
[15:44] pillar of fire came down
[15:45] and said as john the baptist was sent
[15:47] before that never changed
[15:50] no matter how many times it was told no
[15:52] matter how many times he repeated the
[15:53] story those two elements
[15:55] did not change because that was the
[15:57] point of the story
[15:59] well why would god let him say it that
[16:01] way because it's perfectly
[16:03] designed to only attract and keep the
[16:06] bride
[16:07] because only the bride is supposed to
[16:09] make it all the way through to the end
[16:11] with this message
[16:12] and to do that you're gonna have to stay
[16:14] with it stick with it no matter what
[16:16] anybody else says stick with it stay
[16:19] right in that and just keep walking with
[16:22] it
[16:22] and watch it unfold and reveal itself
[16:26] just think of what would happen to us
[16:31] those who we've been here in this church
[16:33] for a long period of time
[16:35] go back six years amen when the previous
[16:38] pastor denounced the message
[16:40] where would we be if we had left then
[16:42] and what would we have missed
[16:43] seeing now
[16:48] what do you have to do no matter what
[16:50] anybody else says about it stick with it
[16:53] and keep walking in it the light of the
[16:56] hour
[16:57] and watch it unfold itself
[17:00] praise be to god review's going really
[17:02] slow
[17:04] as slide number one but it's
[17:07] so important it's so critically
[17:09] important
[17:10] amen somebody can show you
[17:12] inconsistencies i can show you
[17:13] inconsistencies
[17:14] somebody can show you questions i can
[17:16] show you a question there's things
[17:17] brother ben said
[17:18] i don't know what he means but i know he
[17:19] knows what he's talking about
[17:21] but explain it i can't explain it i'm
[17:23] not even going to try to explain it i'm
[17:25] just going to wait and keep walking in
[17:27] it and watch it unfold itself
[17:28] because it will unfold itself because
[17:31] this is the mystery
[17:32] that he's given to his bride he's
[17:33] whispering the love secrets to her
[17:35] and he wants her to know amen and so
[17:37] there's things that are going to
[17:38] continue to unfold
[17:39] we just got to stick with it and watch
[17:42] it unfold
[17:43] itself we're not going to unfold it
[17:47] we need to rest assured in the fact that
[17:49] we as human beings
[17:50] are not going to unfold this word and
[17:53] unfold this truth
[17:54] we're going to keep walking in it and
[17:55] stick with it and
[17:57] watch it unfold itself
[18:01] praise be to god that's always the
[18:04] temptation
[18:05] to try to unfold it ourselves but we
[18:08] have to wait
[18:10] handwriting on the wall he says now any
[18:13] bible reader here knows that all
[18:15] scripture has a compound meaning
[18:17] every prophecy some most of all of it
[18:20] has a duel
[18:21] a dual time or two times or more
[18:26] that it will that it'll be answered as a
[18:28] revolving history
[18:30] this is important when we're talking
[18:32] about this because as we start talking
[18:34] about
[18:35] uh going through the the uh
[18:38] the seals and the trumpets and the vials
[18:40] we know that there's a
[18:42] cycle of seals trumpets and vials
[18:44] designated
[18:45] under the end time sign which is the
[18:47] seventh seal which is the end time seal
[18:49] right and those events are going to
[18:51] unfold
[18:52] at the end time amen but these events
[18:56] the the trumpets
[18:57] seals and vials have been going on from
[18:59] the very beginning
[19:00] and brother banham shows us that trumpet
[19:02] seals and vials have been going on
[19:04] through the church ages
[19:06] he said a church-age messenger will come
[19:08] break a seal he'll sound a trumpet it'll
[19:10] declare spiritual war
[19:12] amen and they'll gather to the truth
[19:14] amen it'll start a spiritual war
[19:16] and then and then after their sea of
[19:18] that group sealed away he'll pour out a
[19:19] plague on all those who rejected it
[19:22] so you can find you can see seals
[19:25] trumpets vials
[19:26] through the whole bible amen because
[19:28] every scripture has a compound meaning
[19:31] and a compound revelation sometimes two
[19:33] times or
[19:34] more so the same scripture you could say
[19:38] well this scripture means that and and
[19:40] somebody says no
[19:41] this scripture means that and the truth
[19:43] is it's both correct
[19:46] well this was fulfilled then no no no
[19:48] this is going to be fulfilled in the
[19:50] future
[19:50] and you can say they're both correct
[19:54] and if we don't let that happen we're
[19:56] going to get ourselves tangled up in the
[19:57] weeds somewhere
[19:59] because we're going to say no it's this
[20:01] it can't be that or no it's this it
[20:03] can't be that
[20:04] when the fact is it was this and it will
[20:06] be this
[20:09] so those are important lessons to
[20:11] realize don't
[20:12] don't say well i've already figured out
[20:14] what that scripture means
[20:16] it means this and nothing else no god
[20:18] can use that prophecy
[20:20] again in a revolving history
[20:25] that's why we can see the seals
[20:28] oh praise god can we turn the white
[20:30] board on
[20:32] i just want to look at the seals all the
[20:34] way back in genesis
[20:37] and i'm just i'm just doing this as an
[20:39] example
[20:40] i mean just just take it as an example
[20:43] but you have jacob
[20:49] all right jacob is going to have a name
[20:51] change he's going to become
[20:52] israel but right now he's jacob now
[20:55] there was a prophecy given in genesis 25
[20:58] and it was given to his mother amen
[21:01] because
[21:01] she was she was in turmoil because there
[21:04] was
[21:05] great turmoil within her womb and and
[21:07] she sought the lord and the lord said
[21:08] there are two nations within thy womb
[21:11] and one shall be stronger than the other
[21:12] and the elders shall serve the younger
[21:15] now when he
[21:16] gives that prophecy the elder shall
[21:18] serve the younger
[21:20] right then and there you've got the
[21:22] picture of election
[21:23] right there that is election neither one
[21:27] being born neither having done good or
[21:29] evil but by the purpose of election
[21:32] might stand
[21:32] he has said jacob have i loved but esau
[21:34] have i hated
[21:36] and right here when she sought the lord
[21:38] he spoke right to her
[21:40] so now you see jacob is under a covenant
[21:42] of grace
[21:46] but jacob leaves the homeland he goes
[21:49] off and we're just going to we're just
[21:50] going to show this as a picture of the
[21:52] church as well
[21:54] we're going to look at 1
[21:57] two three four seals
[22:01] now don't get bogged down in red horse
[22:04] white horse and all that i'm just trying
[22:06] to show
[22:06] patterns patterns patterns patterns
[22:09] through four seals we have an entire
[22:12] bride coming out
[22:13] is that right the whole church that god
[22:16] is going to redeem the whole bride
[22:17] is coming out through four through
[22:20] through
[22:21] let's say four seals four stages of the
[22:24] wheat plant
[22:25] four stages of the bride tree right he's
[22:28] it was destroyed down and it comes back
[22:30] through four stages so through four
[22:32] seals
[22:32] is going to come forth the entire bride
[22:36] but in the old testament through jacob
[22:38] is going to come through forth the
[22:39] entire nation of israel is that right
[22:43] the whole church basically is going to
[22:45] come out of jacob
[22:47] so jacob delivers 12 sons through four
[22:50] women
[22:52] right one two three four out of the four
[22:55] comes the whole church
[22:57] out of four seals comes the whole bride
[23:00] you see the pattern
[23:02] so first is leah
[23:07] the next is
[23:11] bilhah i think
[23:14] next is zil
[23:17] pa and then rachel
[23:23] all right but why did you list them that
[23:25] way
[23:26] because that's the way they give birth
[23:30] lee is the first one to bring forth then
[23:32] bilna
[23:33] then zilpah then leo brings forth again
[23:36] the sixth son
[23:37] that she brings forth rachel's the last
[23:40] one to bring forth
[23:42] why is rachel the last one to bring
[23:43] forth because
[23:45] rachel's a type of the bride and leah is
[23:47] a tribe of the old testament church
[23:50] because he wanted brother branham said
[23:52] from the beginning
[23:54] god always wanted a gentile bride
[23:57] so he said he always wanted a gentile
[23:58] bride so now when jacob goes down
[24:01] amen what's he doing he's portraying the
[24:03] seals he's bringing the seals out
[24:05] uh what he wanted was a gentile bride
[24:08] but before he could get a gentile bride
[24:10] he went down and he asked for the
[24:11] gentile bride
[24:12] yes you can i'm calling rachel the
[24:15] gentile bride
[24:16] those day brother chad your way off
[24:17] scriptures you just listen to what i'm
[24:19] saying
[24:20] get the picture he wants
[24:24] he wants rachel because god always
[24:26] wanted a gentile bride
[24:28] he wants rachel but he has to work
[24:32] seven years for her which is one sabbath
[24:33] or one cycle of completion
[24:35] and look at that as the old testament so
[24:38] he's got to work
[24:39] and after he works seven years he's
[24:41] going to get his bride
[24:43] amen but when when he takes his bride he
[24:46] recognizes that's not the one i wanted i
[24:48] want the gentile bride
[24:49] this is leah the old testament bride she
[24:52] wasn't beautiful to him she had kind
[24:54] eyes but he wanted the beautiful
[24:56] rachel so he gets leah
[24:59] and at the same time he gets leah he
[25:01] goes back to laban and he said you did
[25:03] me a trick here
[25:04] and labor said that's the way it is
[25:05] you've got to take the older one
[25:07] first so christ had to come and he had
[25:10] to redeem
[25:12] the old church first so got a cycle of
[25:16] the old testament cycle of seven
[25:18] and he says now laban says i'll give you
[25:20] rachel if you promise to work us another
[25:22] cycle of seven
[25:24] through seven church ages to complete
[25:25] the new testament and he says deal
[25:28] so he gets rachel right then
[25:31] not after seven years right then because
[25:33] at pentecost you see the bride coming
[25:35] forth and then it goes right into
[25:36] gentiles
[25:38] and then he's got these two wives he
[25:40] redeemed the old church and now
[25:42] he's got rachel but in order to
[25:45] fully redeem rachel he's got to stay
[25:48] with laban and he's got to labor
[25:50] for another cycle of seven through the
[25:52] new testament
[25:53] through seven church ages
[25:56] then after seven church ages he can take
[25:59] what he's redeemed and go back home
[26:04] do you see the picture you know don't
[26:07] get bogged down in details look at the
[26:09] picture the picture's beautiful
[26:12] so rachel can't bring forth why can't
[26:15] she bring forth
[26:16] because because it's the story it's
[26:18] always difficult for the right woman to
[26:20] bring forth life
[26:22] always through travail leah can produce
[26:28] then then rachel she can't produce a son
[26:30] so she takes her handmaid
[26:32] and that's bilna and she gives it to her
[26:34] husband
[26:35] and and bilna produces two sons
[26:38] and then when leah recognizes she's not
[26:41] bringing four children anymore she gives
[26:43] her handmaid which is zilpah
[26:45] unto her husband and he and zilpah
[26:47] brings forth two more
[26:49] after that leah conceives again
[26:53] and has the sixth son
[26:56] unto jacob and then they're done
[27:00] they're not going to bring forth any
[27:01] more those three are going to bring
[27:02] forth any more
[27:04] but now it's time for rachel to bring
[27:06] forth so now when we move into the
[27:08] fourth wife
[27:10] or the fourth stage just this stay with
[27:13] me on the picture
[27:14] when you come to number four which is
[27:16] gonna be under the fourth seal
[27:18] under prophetic rachel brings forth
[27:23] joseph how do you spell joseph
[27:28] is that right praise god
[27:31] brings forth joseph who's joseph a
[27:33] prophet
[27:34] under the fourth seal comes a prophet
[27:37] who's a perfect type of jesus christ
[27:41] so what does rachel the bride bring
[27:43] forth amen
[27:44] at the end of this redemption cycle and
[27:46] how do you know it's the end
[27:47] because after joseph's born he goes back
[27:49] to laban and he says i've completed my
[27:51] seven years let me go back home
[27:53] when he sees now that a prophet has come
[27:55] forth from the fourth woman
[27:57] now he knows it's time to go back to the
[27:59] homeland
[28:01] because the prophet is on the scene now
[28:03] amen come out of rachel
[28:05] the bride praise god
[28:09] so now rachel is moving back into the
[28:12] land
[28:13] now joseph oh this is so
[28:17] good
[28:20] they're moving back into the land as
[28:22] they get closer to the land
[28:24] they they they they go through different
[28:27] troubles
[28:27] oh my goodness this is so good
[28:32] you come down to genesis where now
[28:34] esau's coming to get
[28:36] coming to get jacob jacob moves into
[28:38] jacob's trouble amen it puts him in
[28:40] desperation
[28:41] he crosses the the stream by himself and
[28:44] goes off by himself
[28:45] and he encounters a man and begins to
[28:47] wrestle with a man so now we see
[28:49] that he comes through his sixth seal
[28:51] experience
[28:53] right and he begins to wrestle with a
[28:55] man and this experience in the sixth
[28:57] seal is going to change his walk forever
[28:59] he's going to be touched in the hollow
[29:01] of his thigh when he wrestles with this
[29:03] with his individual because he's in a
[29:05] state of desperation
[29:07] because he's in a troublesome time
[29:09] because he knows he's done wrong
[29:10] he knows he's treated esau wrong he
[29:13] knows he's deserving of judgment
[29:14] and he's deserving of esau's judgment
[29:18] but that puts him in desperation and
[29:20] when he gets in desperation he gets in
[29:22] isolation by himself
[29:24] when he gets off by himself in
[29:25] desperation he meets one
[29:28] amen he doesn't even know who he's
[29:29] wrestling with and remember he's
[29:31] wrestling with somebody
[29:32] who's going to change his name from
[29:34] jacob to israel
[29:36] because he has a new birth
[29:40] and after that new birth and the sixth
[29:42] seal amen the next thing he says is he
[29:44] names that place pinewool
[29:46] because i have seen god face to face
[29:50] after he wrestles after his name change
[29:52] after the blessing
[29:53] amen then he recognizes that was god
[29:57] he recognizes the seventh seal
[30:08] whoop i got an eraser
[30:20] all right do you see it
[30:26] he goes through all of that where's the
[30:28] fifth seal
[30:31] remember when i drew the picture
[30:34] for the jews it started before the first
[30:37] seal
[30:40] when before he was born
[30:44] the lord told her the older shall serve
[30:47] the younger
[30:48] no matter what dirty tricks he pulled no
[30:50] matter what deceptions no matter how
[30:52] much of a science there was
[30:54] he was elected and therefore came under
[30:57] the fifth seal of grace
[30:58] his whole life he may not have realized
[31:02] it until much later he may not have come
[31:03] in contact with the realization
[31:05] but because he was elected predestinated
[31:08] seat
[31:08] he was under the fifth seal of grace the
[31:11] whole time
[31:18] after jacob goes through the seven seals
[31:22] then he goes back into the land when he
[31:25] gets
[31:26] back into the land rachel's going to
[31:28] bring forth
[31:29] the last child the last part
[31:32] of the elect the last part of all of the
[31:35] nation
[31:37] and the last one that she brings forth
[31:42] is benjamin the forty 144 thousand
[31:47] brother said the hundred forty four
[31:48] thousand is little benjamin and little
[31:50] benjamin can't be
[31:51] birthed by those two prophets outside of
[31:53] the land so they've gotta get
[31:55] back into the promised land and as
[31:57] they're moving back into the land
[31:59] is when rachel delivers 144 000
[32:02] but remember brother branham said the
[32:05] bride can't be here at the same time as
[32:07] the 144 thousand
[32:09] so there's there's a prophecy a shadow
[32:11] that's laying here that the bride has to
[32:13] go
[32:14] before the 144 thousand amen before
[32:16] those two witnesses begin ministering
[32:18] and calling out 144 000
[32:20] so rachel dies at the birth of benjamin
[32:24] when benjamin comes forth
[32:26] rachel leaves at the exact same time
[32:34] little benjamin back in the homeland
[32:38] do you see the seals you see
[32:42] it's a revolving history so when we
[32:44] start to
[32:45] start to look at these things some
[32:46] things we're going to say like brother
[32:48] bennett said
[32:48] this opened here under the persecution
[32:50] of the jews and things like that but you
[32:52] can find that same seal effective
[32:54] all over the place all the way back to
[32:56] even after the jews rejected christ
[32:58] amen and there was a persecution that
[32:59] came through titus you can see the sixth
[33:01] seal break open there
[33:02] but when we're talking about these
[33:03] things we're talking about the end time
[33:05] sequence amen that happens under the
[33:07] seventh seal which is the end of time
[33:10] seal does that make sense are we all
[33:12] together on that
[33:13] so don't don't don't say but this
[33:14] happened here and this happened here
[33:15] it's not just there yeah it's not just
[33:17] there but we're just showing it in this
[33:19] this time frame so
[33:22] another interesting thing on joseph
[33:26] when you count the birth order
[33:30] of all of jacob's children
[33:33] joseph is number 11.
[33:40] if you move further down
[33:44] in the book of genesis joseph gets
[33:46] separated from his brethren
[33:48] sent to egypt he's there they're going
[33:50] to come together and now
[33:52] it's time for joseph to reveal himself
[33:55] to his brethren
[33:57] and he can't do it to little benjamin's
[33:59] there so they work out all the details
[34:00] to get benjamin there when benjamin
[34:02] comes
[34:02] then joseph reveals himself amen and
[34:06] joseph is a perfect type of christ amen
[34:08] and so now christ is going to reveal
[34:10] himself to his brethren the jews
[34:12] when all 12 were assembled little
[34:14] benjamin's back
[34:15] present now he's going to present
[34:17] himself to his brethren
[34:19] when in revelations chapter 11
[34:22] so in birth order joseph is number
[34:25] 11. what's it foreshadowing
[34:29] revelations 11 because when brother
[34:31] brahm talks about those two witnesses he
[34:33] goes right back
[34:34] to genesis and talks about joseph
[34:36] revealing himself to his brethren when
[34:37] little benjamin shows up
[34:42] that makes benjamin 12 benjamin 12 which
[34:44] completes
[34:45] that church
[34:48] but there's other places in the
[34:51] scripture
[34:53] that counts the sons of israel the sons
[34:57] of jacob
[34:57] differently they don't count them in
[35:00] birth order
[35:01] they count them first by all the sons
[35:03] that are born through leah
[35:05] the first wife and then by the sons that
[35:07] are born through rachel the second wife
[35:10] and then counts the tons of the
[35:11] concubines
[35:13] so you can count them both ways because
[35:14] the scripture counts them both ways
[35:16] and leah had six sons before joseph come
[35:19] by so when you count just the sons of
[35:21] the wives
[35:22] joseph is also number seven completion a
[35:24] perfect type of christ
[35:26] the seventh seal revealing himself as
[35:30] the seventh trumpet
[35:31] to his brethren and that makes little
[35:34] benjamin
[35:36] number eight praise god
[35:40] i tell you i don't know about you but
[35:42] little things like that
[35:43] absolutely thrill my heart and i feel
[35:46] edified amen
[35:47] i feel edified amen and purified by a
[35:50] spirit when you can see the same
[35:51] it's the same story of redemption taking
[35:54] place here
[35:55] and here and here and here and that's
[35:58] why once you catch the pattern
[36:00] once you see the pattern amen you can
[36:03] see it everywhere you look
[36:04] and that's why for me when brother
[36:06] brennan makes a statement
[36:07] when he when when he opened the seals he
[36:09] opened up the entire bible
[36:11] he said after the seals my bible became
[36:13] a new book my experience is
[36:15] after i caught the revelation of
[36:17] redemption amen the threefold purpose
[36:19] the great mystery of the whole book
[36:21] now my bible became a new book it took
[36:24] the seals off the whole bible
[36:25] now it's not a story about jacob it's
[36:27] not a story about rachel
[36:28] it's a story about me
[36:32] i'm rachel amen why because the gentile
[36:35] bride is the one who carries christ
[36:37] amen and brings forth christ in this day
[36:39] and gives that word back to the jews
[36:44] story about me bringing forth
[36:47] they couldn't bring forth couldn't bring
[36:48] forth couldn't bring forth because she's
[36:50] pressed it predestinated not to bring
[36:52] forth
[36:53] just another church member just another
[36:55] a church a denominational member
[36:57] but she is predestinated to bring forth
[37:00] joseph
[37:01] number seven a type of jesus christ
[37:03] brother ben said a perfect type of jesus
[37:05] christ
[37:06] and he was perfection amen so she was
[37:09] predestined to bring forth amen
[37:11] that's why through the seven church ages
[37:13] you don't see
[37:14] replicated the life of christ the life
[37:16] of christ the life of christ
[37:18] until you get to the seventh and then
[37:20] rachel is going to now bring
[37:22] forth joseph that's why it's been the
[37:25] long dry spell
[37:26] that's why amen because the true bride
[37:29] amen
[37:30] church members can bring forth church
[37:32] members all day long
[37:33] but the true bride has always had
[37:35] trouble
[37:36] bringing forth there was a difficulty
[37:38] bringing forth and sarah
[37:40] difficulty bringing forth and rebecca
[37:42] difficulty bringing forth and rachel
[37:44] why because the right woman always has
[37:47] trouble bringing forth
[37:48] because she can't make anything happen
[37:50] herself
[37:51] she has to wait for the predestinated
[37:53] time to bring forth
[37:55] and that's why the true bride in every
[37:57] church amen was not bringing forth
[37:59] joseph not bringing forth joseph
[38:01] till the end of that seven year cycle
[38:04] and at the end of the seven year cycle
[38:05] she brings forth joseph and it's
[38:07] manifest
[38:08] by a prophet with the son of man
[38:09] ministry doing everything that jesus
[38:11] christ did
[38:12] yes
[38:15] see this is our whole life the whole
[38:18] bible
[38:19] is our whole life and now we find
[38:21] ourselves
[38:23] in the seals so what are the seals about
[38:26] white horse red horse black
[38:27] yes yes and no
[38:30] it's that and so much more it's that and
[38:33] everything else
[38:34] included and like i said
[38:38] like i said from the beginning brother
[38:39] ben said i've mapped this out and draw
[38:40] this out and i may not have it exactly
[38:42] right
[38:42] so forgive me if i don't have it exactly
[38:44] right but i know it's the truth
[38:46] [Music]
[38:47] amen if we can go back to the powerpoint
[38:49] please
[38:53] all right so i i'm doing a slow slow job
[38:57] of review
[38:58] scripture has a compound meaning every
[39:00] prophecy some most all of it has a dual
[39:02] time or two times or more that it'll be
[39:04] answered as a revolving history
[39:08] then out came wesley he saw that big
[39:10] organized
[39:11] organization so he sounded a trumpet so
[39:13] brother man now talking about in the
[39:14] church ages wesley is sounding a trumpet
[39:17] of sanctification more of the words see
[39:19] when he did out they moved right out
[39:21] right out of luther right in the
[39:23] methodist and when pentecost saw it they
[39:25] sounded a trumpet
[39:26] it's time for the return of the gifts
[39:27] see what did they do they sounded a
[39:29] trumpet and now they came
[39:30] so brother ma'am showing that there has
[39:32] been trumpets through the church ages
[39:34] and the trumpets and the church ages are
[39:35] doing the same thing that the trumpets
[39:37] are doing to the jews they're calling
[39:40] the people back to the word
[39:43] back to the truth amen luther brought
[39:46] him back to justification
[39:48] amen wesley brought him back to
[39:49] sanctification the pentecostals brought
[39:51] him back to the gifts of the spirit
[39:53] so the trumpets are doing the same thing
[39:55] to the church
[39:56] that they're doing to israel the jews
[40:01] brother i said on in the sixth seal
[40:03] trumpets always denotes war
[40:05] the messenger the angel come on earth
[40:07] the messenger of the hour like luther
[40:08] like any of the messengers that we've
[40:09] talked of
[40:10] what does he do he arrives in a seal
[40:12] open reveals a trumpet sounds
[40:15] war declared and away they go and then
[40:17] the messenger dies
[40:19] he seals away this group they're put in
[40:21] and a plague falls upon those who reject
[40:23] it see
[40:24] and then it goes on they organize get
[40:26] another organization so brother branham
[40:28] is showing us through the church ages
[40:29] we've had seals trumpets vials
[40:34] before the church ages we've had seals
[40:36] trumpets vials
[40:39] after the church ages we're going to see
[40:40] the completion of seals trumpets vials
[40:44] all right
[40:49] brother says now i'm continuing with
[40:52] this thought
[40:53] the eighth chapter only reveals the
[40:55] scene of the scene he's talking about
[40:56] revelation chapter eight for the seventh
[40:58] seal
[40:58] only reveals the scene of the seventh
[41:00] seal where nothing else is revealed
[41:02] now nothing is not revealed in the
[41:04] seventh seal
[41:06] nothing is not revealed
[41:09] that means something's revealed but it's
[41:12] not said
[41:14] nothing is not revealed oh that's a big
[41:17] statement friends
[41:19] that's a it may have been a slip of the
[41:21] tongue it may have been a grammatical
[41:22] error but it's still the truth
[41:26] now has nothing to do with the seventh
[41:29] chapter of revelation
[41:31] it's the revealing of the seven seals
[41:32] perfectly mute and i've only had time
[41:35] i'll try a few places to show you all
[41:36] the way back from
[41:38] genesis the seventh after the seventh
[41:40] seal is spoke of
[41:42] from the very beginning in genesis this
[41:44] these seals
[41:45] move right on up so that's what brother
[41:47] bram was telling us this seven seals all
[41:49] the way back in the beginning of genesis
[41:51] and he says right from genesis these
[41:53] seals are moving up
[41:56] i just showed you one place so
[41:59] we can see the seals everywhere the
[42:01] whole bible when he took the seals off
[42:03] he unlocked the whole bible so where do
[42:07] you see the seventh seal coming up in
[42:08] genesis
[42:11] in the beginning god
[42:15] from the in the beginning in genesis to
[42:17] the amen to end of revelations brother
[42:18] branham says is all christ
[42:20] all speaking of christ and christ is the
[42:22] mystery of god revealed the seventh seal
[42:26] so the whole bible is the seventh seal
[42:30] right the whole creation
[42:33] because all things were made by him and
[42:34] for him and without him was not anything
[42:36] that was made and by him all things
[42:37] consist
[42:40] so where does that seventh seal come up
[42:41] from genesis in the beginning god
[42:44] created heavens and earth how did he
[42:45] create heavens and earth with christ
[42:48] everything was made by him and for him
[42:51] and without him
[42:52] nothing was made that was made and by
[42:54] him
[42:55] all things that were made consistent
[42:58] praise be to god
[42:59] and from there it just keeps rolling on
[43:03] all right now we're going to look at our
[43:05] gaps again really quickly just very
[43:07] quickly just to review it
[43:09] between the seven church ages and the
[43:10] seven seals you have the breach
[43:12] which is a gap between the church ages
[43:14] and the seals
[43:16] and brother branham makes this statement
[43:18] now he says i'm just going to drop down
[43:19] to the bold part
[43:20] because i would like to strike again at
[43:22] the seven last trumpets and it all
[43:24] bridges together
[43:25] and then they're in the seven last
[43:26] plagues and it all blends right together
[43:28] as we'll see as we go along the second
[43:32] seal says you see there
[43:33] there's seven vials you know these
[43:35] sevens as we going through they all
[43:37] happen right at the same time
[43:38] following the plagues following the
[43:40] church ages just the same
[43:41] because it's all sealed up into that one
[43:43] book everything and everything happens
[43:45] just in rotation and one goes right into
[43:48] the other
[43:49] and the other into the other kind of
[43:52] like a roman
[43:53] candle going off and out from one
[43:57] goes five more bursts and out from that
[43:59] goes five more bursts and right
[44:01] one rotates right into the other right
[44:03] into the other
[44:04] right into the other
[44:07] praise god in the message thinking man's
[44:10] filter he says i'm anxiously waiting for
[44:12] the hour to where we can all congregate
[44:13] in one place and preach on those seven
[44:15] plagues
[44:16] seven vials seven trumpets and so forth
[44:18] they all happen right in a cluster
[44:20] that's the reason i'll take us about a
[44:22] week 10 days or more to get through it
[44:24] in one single meeting
[44:25] if we can my brother brother says they
[44:27] all happen right in the cluster
[44:28] just to me what i'm seeing is he's
[44:30] talking about under the seventh seal the
[44:32] end of time seal
[44:34] that wraps up everything when the roman
[44:35] candle goes off it ends time for
[44:37] denominations then it ends time for this
[44:39] then it ends time for this and it's time
[44:41] for that
[44:42] all the way into the ushering into the
[44:43] millennium
[44:45] so it all happens right in that cluster
[44:48] right in that cluster between the
[44:50] second and third woe between world war
[44:52] ii and world war
[44:53] iii
[44:57] now let's move on to the next gap in the
[44:59] seals
[45:01] we go through first five seals seal six
[45:05] seal number seven and then the gap
[45:08] between the seals
[45:10] and in the gap between the seals amen
[45:12] you start off
[45:14] and when you're at home just read back
[45:15] and forth through these because it takes
[45:17] some time
[45:18] to get acquainted with what's going on
[45:20] but they're all interlaced together
[45:22] so in between the sixth and seventh seal
[45:24] you have revelation chapter seven
[45:25] in chapter seven you have four angels
[45:28] amen that are holding back the four
[45:29] winds
[45:30] and an angel with the seal of god comes
[45:32] and says hold back the wind
[45:34] don't hurt the trees don't hurt anything
[45:37] until we finish
[45:38] sealing amen all of the servants right
[45:41] we got to seal them all on the forehead
[45:43] and so now these four angels which we
[45:45] saw four angels released out of
[45:47] euphrates in world war
[45:48] ii amen and with that came the army of
[45:51] uh uh of demons that went into the the
[45:54] armies of hitler mussolini and stalin so
[45:56] these four angels and brother bam said
[45:58] these four angels controlling the winds
[46:00] he said winds are wars and strife
[46:03] and so when we just saw in world war ii
[46:05] under the sixth seal
[46:07] the sixth trumpet sound these four uh
[46:10] angels were released the the army came
[46:13] out went into the
[46:14] armies of hitler mussolini and stalin
[46:16] amen and they brought a bitter
[46:18] persecution against the jews
[46:19] and now we find in the gap between the
[46:22] six
[46:23] and seven seal that now he says hold
[46:25] back don't harm
[46:27] wait until we're done sealing amen we
[46:29] can't bring
[46:30] more war world war three amen until
[46:33] we're done sealing the 144
[46:35] 000 who does that
[46:38] it's the ministry of two prophets
[46:42] so the the the revelation of the
[46:45] trumpets and the mystery of two prophets
[46:46] come between the six and seven seal
[46:49] see that all right
[46:54] then you have trumpets
[46:58] in between the sixth trumpet and the
[47:00] seventh trumpet
[47:01] is revelation chapter 10 and most of
[47:03] revelation chapter 11.
[47:05] you have the prophets ministry and the
[47:07] ministry of the the two prophets the two
[47:09] witnesses in revelation chapter 11.
[47:11] and in between the prophets ministry and
[47:14] in the ministry of the two prophets the
[47:15] two witnesses and
[47:16] that go to moses and elijah that go to
[47:18] the jews what do you have in between
[47:20] those two mysteries
[47:22] you have the ministry of of the seventh
[47:25] angel
[47:26] you have the ministry of the two
[47:28] witnesses but right in between there
[47:31] you have a little bride who's going to
[47:33] take the book and eat the book and
[47:34] prophesy again
[47:36] so you have the ministry of the bride in
[47:39] between the ministry
[47:40] of the the seventh angel and the
[47:42] ministry of the two witnesses
[47:45] where in the gap between the sixth and
[47:48] seventh trumpet
[47:50] praise be to god i love this
[47:56] feast the trumpets the gathering of
[47:59] israel is the trumpets the trumpets is
[48:01] to gather israel
[48:02] this is why brother ben was told you're
[48:04] not to preach it you've already preached
[48:05] it supernaturally under the sixth seal
[48:07] because this takes place under the sixth
[48:09] seal
[48:10] and you already talked about it but the
[48:12] revelation of what all those trumpets
[48:13] are
[48:14] that'll be taken care of by two
[48:15] witnesses
[48:17] and brother there's the seventh trumpet
[48:19] to the jews is what the sixth seal was
[48:21] to the gentiles
[48:22] and the sixth seal was christ who came
[48:24] to reveal
[48:25] the seals so the the seventh trumpet is
[48:28] the
[48:28] brings them to the feast of atonement
[48:30] which is christ there's their slain lamb
[48:34] all right brother brown goes down the
[48:37] gathering of israel to the trumpets the
[48:38] trumpeses to gather israel
[48:40] now he goes to the first trumpet in
[48:42] revelation chapter 8
[48:44] and he says the very first trumpet sound
[48:46] blood fire hail everything scattered the
[48:48] ground
[48:48] what was he doing bringing israel out of
[48:50] spiritual egypt see back into the
[48:52] homeland
[48:53] see he's showing the same thing that
[48:55] happened in egypt when moses showed up
[48:57] in egypt
[48:57] moses showed up and broke open the sixth
[49:00] seal
[49:00] in egypt brought plagues down
[49:04] and broke open the sixth seal in egypt
[49:07] and out of that
[49:08] what was he doing he was calling them to
[49:10] the homeland
[49:12] so it's the same thing that's taking
[49:14] place again
[49:16] the feast of trumpets again he says it's
[49:18] been the time of the pentecostal feast
[49:20] that's the church ages
[49:21] the jews is laid silent they rejected it
[49:24] now they've got to be called back to the
[49:25] atonement
[49:26] we know who the atonement was they
[49:28] didn't and the trumpet sound and after
[49:30] the pentecostal jubilee calls the jews
[49:32] together
[49:32] can't you see how that trumpet of
[49:34] persecution under hitler and then
[49:36] blasted
[49:37] and the jews was forced to come together
[49:39] to fulfill the scriptures
[49:41] that's why brother brahm says the
[49:42] holocaust was the tender
[49:44] hand of jehovah
[49:47] because those two witnesses can't show
[49:50] up and
[49:50] and 144 000 cannot be called outside of
[49:54] the promised land
[49:55] they've got to come back to the promised
[49:56] land so god will construct
[49:58] events around the whole planet to bring
[50:00] them back home
[50:03] why because jacob couldn't be satisfied
[50:06] in laban's house
[50:07] because jacob was very prosperous in
[50:09] laban's house and the jews had been very
[50:13] prosperous in all the world that they
[50:14] had went
[50:15] and they were prospering amen and
[50:17] brother brenham said they were
[50:19] they were shysters i mean i don't mean
[50:21] anything as to jews but brother brahm
[50:22] said
[50:23] he's always had his hand on money amen
[50:25] and he'll cheat you in anything to get
[50:27] that money
[50:27] and you see it right there in jacob
[50:29] jacob was there throwing the poplar
[50:31] sticks in the water to scare the cattle
[50:32] to have speckled calves and
[50:34] i don't know how all that works but it
[50:36] worked
[50:37] either way it worked and he and he had a
[50:40] deal all work for the speckled cattle
[50:42] you can have the rest
[50:43] and he's laboring and through trickery
[50:45] and then he's get his
[50:46] his flock is growing and growing and
[50:48] growing because the jews were
[50:50] accumulating all the paper money of the
[50:52] world
[50:56] seals explain everything
[50:59] and all of a sudden laban's son start
[51:02] getting really
[51:03] irritated at the prosperity of jacob
[51:07] and the rest of europe gets really
[51:08] irritated at the prosperity of the jews
[51:11] and start blaming them for every bit of
[51:14] trouble that's taking place
[51:15] and all of a sudden anti-semitism is on
[51:17] the rise and they're getting blamed
[51:19] because of their prosperity
[51:23] and it starts a persecution amen that's
[51:26] going to
[51:26] boil over amen after those demons are
[51:28] released out of the
[51:30] uh those demons are released into the
[51:31] armies
[51:33] and it's going to bring a bitter
[51:34] persecution that's going to drive them
[51:37] back to the homeland
[51:39] where did you see that pattern before
[51:41] all the way back in genesis with jacob
[51:46] see now we're continuing on with what
[51:48] we've been saying now let me say this
[51:50] right here the very trumpet that blowed
[51:52] every trumpet that blowed blowed under
[51:54] the sixth seal we'll get to it in a few
[51:56] minutes
[51:56] where we caught the seal there all the
[51:58] trumpets sounded under the sixth seal
[52:01] and every trumpet sounded under the
[52:03] sixth seal under the persecution of the
[52:06] jews
[52:06] notice revelation now uh eighth
[52:09] beginning with the seventh verse
[52:10] all was the calling out of israel
[52:12] natural in egypt
[52:13] announced the calling out of israel in
[52:15] the spiritual sense
[52:17] it he was making them ready to come to
[52:19] the feast of atonement
[52:21] so under that sixth seal which blows at
[52:24] the same opens at the same time
[52:27] the sixth trumpet he's calling them back
[52:30] to the promised land here he says
[52:32] at the sixth seal when when it opened
[52:36] the persecution struck the jews in the
[52:38] literal standpoint
[52:39] and here comes the persecution to the
[52:41] church in the ecclesiastical standpoint
[52:43] because the bride is already called he
[52:46] said that in 1964
[52:48] what are they called by they're called
[52:50] by an eliezer ministry they're called by
[52:52] a midnight hour call they're called by
[52:54] the same
[52:55] i mean the the elijah ministry
[52:58] the bride is already is the bride is
[53:00] already called the sabbaths are over
[53:02] ready for the jews to be called where to
[53:04] the feast of atonement
[53:06] so when when the sixth seal when it
[53:08] opened the persecution struck the jews
[53:11] now brother branham is talking in the
[53:13] under the seventh seal
[53:14] under the end time seal under the end
[53:16] time sequence
[53:18] now the feast of trump as he says luke
[53:20] 17 30 the revealing of the son of man
[53:23] malachi 4 amen turning the hearts back
[53:25] to the pentecostal fathers hebrews 4 12
[53:28] amen all these scriptures as promised
[53:30] this is to be between the 6 and 7 seal
[53:33] and the 6th and 7th trumpet so we can
[53:35] see these ministries take place
[53:37] in the gap feast of trump is the sixth
[53:40] trumpet and the sixth seal
[53:42] sound at the same time when did the
[53:45] sixth trumpet sound
[53:46] when all those two hundred thousand
[53:47] thousand demons come out and went into
[53:49] those armies
[53:52] and between the sixth trumpet and the
[53:54] seventh trumpet
[53:55] there is a prophet to appear before the
[53:56] gentiles revelation 10.
[53:59] to call the people back to the original
[54:00] pentecostal doctrine
[54:02] and the two witnesses of revelation 11
[54:04] appear to the jews
[54:05] to send them to jesus while the church
[54:07] is being taken up
[54:08] why because rachel has to get off the
[54:10] scene the same time the 144 000 are
[54:13] coming
[54:13] the same time benjamin's coming forth
[54:15] rachel's leaving
[54:19] i love the bible
[54:23] now in the vials you have seven vials
[54:26] but in between the vials
[54:28] you have a gap and in that gap
[54:32] you have three unclean spirits like
[54:33] frogs come out of the mouth of three
[54:35] different individuals the brotherhood
[54:36] said that trinity doctrine been laying
[54:38] there all the time
[54:39] but when did it come out to reveal
[54:40] itself when when does it manifest when
[54:42] was it revealed
[54:43] it was revealed under that prophet's
[54:45] ministry showing that that prophet's
[54:47] ministry is in the gap
[54:48] in the sixth and seventh vial praise god
[54:52] then you have uh then he says
[54:55] i uh behold i cometh as a thief
[54:59] that's in the gap and then you have them
[55:02] gathering those spirits gathering them
[55:03] to the battle of armageddon
[55:04] all takes place in the gap there's a lot
[55:08] happening
[55:08] in these gaps but one
[55:12] revolves into another and revolves into
[55:14] another
[55:15] like a roman candle going on
[55:19] brother remember says i was coming back
[55:21] rather here to try to have about a
[55:22] 10-day meeting to speak on the subject
[55:24] of the last
[55:25] seven last vials for in between those
[55:27] vials is the trumpets
[55:29] now brother bram says now the trumpets
[55:31] are in between the vials
[55:33] amen and that's the ministry of the two
[55:35] witnesses are going to be
[55:36] giving the revelation of the trumpets in
[55:38] that time frame
[55:44] now we're looking at the gap now i'm not
[55:46] doing all this in chronological order
[55:47] i'm just trying to explain something
[55:49] here
[55:49] the gap between the six and seven seal
[55:52] the gap between the sixth and seventh
[55:53] trumpet and the gap between the vials
[55:55] in the seals the seals introduce christ
[55:59] to the gentiles
[56:00] seventh seal the seventh trumpet
[56:02] introduces christ to the jews
[56:05] and the seventh vial the viles prepares
[56:08] the earth for christ's millennium
[56:10] so you see everything's being taken care
[56:12] of in this end time sequence
[56:14] the gentiles the jews and the purging of
[56:18] the earth
[56:21] you have a prophet's ministry and the
[56:23] ministry of two witnesses that go
[56:25] through the gap
[56:27] under the seals you have a prophet's
[56:29] ministry you get the complete revelation
[56:31] of christ
[56:32] and the rapture starts with a shout
[56:36] under the trumpets you have the ministry
[56:38] of the two prophets 144 000 are called
[56:41] and they recognize christ the true
[56:43] atonement
[56:45] and in the vials between the vials you
[56:46] have three unclean spirits come out
[56:48] he comes as the thief in the night the
[56:50] rapture
[56:52] and they gather to the battle of
[56:53] armageddon we see all that
[56:56] now i want to go back to this i did a
[56:59] little drawing but brother franco has a
[57:02] slide for me if we look at the seals one
[57:05] two three four
[57:06] five six seven seals
[57:09] we talked last time about not not
[57:12] forcing ourselves to take them in
[57:14] chronological order
[57:16] remember that and when we free ourselves
[57:19] from taking a chronological order now
[57:22] all of a sudden
[57:22] everything begins to fit what the
[57:25] prophet of god was telling us
[57:27] you have through the church ages you
[57:28] have four
[57:30] anointings that come out from the
[57:32] antichrist spirit to bring destruction
[57:34] but you've got four anointings amen that
[57:36] come from the spirit of christ to combat
[57:38] those anointings
[57:39] all the way through the church ages i
[57:42] say all the way through the church ages
[57:43] and beyond
[57:44] because we know that eagle anointing
[57:46] jumps over in the tribulation period on
[57:48] those two
[57:48] witnesses so you've got that
[57:52] but the fifth seal souls on the altar
[57:55] as far as chronology it spans the church
[57:58] ages
[58:00] right because brother bram says those
[58:01] souls under the altar he goes those that
[58:04] stayed
[58:04] true to the word though they were
[58:06] blinded so that he could turn
[58:08] to the gentiles so they can call out a
[58:10] gentile bride
[58:11] because he blinded them he did not hold
[58:13] them accountable for what he blinded
[58:15] them to
[58:16] he only held them accountable for what
[58:18] they could see
[58:20] and what they could see was the law of
[58:22] moses so it wasn't that
[58:24] i'd like to say it this way so we can
[58:26] understand it wasn't that
[58:28] grace says you can do anything that you
[58:31] want and everything's going to be fine
[58:32] no grace says i'll cover for the part i
[58:35] won't let you see
[58:37] as long as you accept the word that i
[58:39] have opened to you
[58:40] they could not have rejected the law of
[58:42] moses they could not have rejected the
[58:44] prophets they could not have rejected
[58:45] those things
[58:46] because that was given to them and
[58:48] opened to them and once it was given to
[58:50] them to reject that was to reject life
[58:53] but they accepted the part that was
[58:55] opened but they could not see what he
[58:57] blinded them to and because he blinded
[59:00] him to that
[59:01] he did not hold them accountable for not
[59:03] seeing it and so
[59:04] now grace takes effect because they're
[59:07] in the last book of life
[59:08] and they're given white robes
[59:12] and that takes place he said from the
[59:14] time of christ
[59:16] on so the reason i say this
[59:21] for a very specific reason if i say
[59:23] brother branham comes between the gap
[59:25] and the sixth and seventh trumpet and
[59:26] the sixth and seventh file
[59:28] when we start thinking chronology you
[59:30] says well then that means
[59:32] all six trumpets are gone and he comes
[59:34] after six trumpets are done he comes
[59:35] after six vials are done
[59:37] i never said that i said what brother
[59:40] branham said
[59:40] these things take place between the six
[59:42] and seven five and the sixth and seventh
[59:44] trumpet and the sixth and seventh seal
[59:48] but who said that just because the sixth
[59:51] trumpet
[59:52] opens and in fact who said that that
[59:54] means that you already had a completion
[59:56] of the first five trumpets
[59:58] nobody said that brother bram didn't say
[1:00:00] that i didn't say that
[1:00:01] [Music]
[1:00:02] did anybody say that the first five
[1:00:04] vials were already poured out an effect
[1:00:06] on the earth i never said that i didn't
[1:00:07] see brother graham say that
[1:00:10] but he did say the sixth trumpet sounded
[1:00:14] it opened and those demons came out and
[1:00:16] those four angels were released he did
[1:00:17] say that
[1:00:20] he did point to the the the sixth vial
[1:00:22] when euphrates dried up and he started
[1:00:24] showing that there was a pagan system
[1:00:26] acting christian
[1:00:27] couldn't cross over but now they can
[1:00:30] cross over to the other side
[1:00:31] crossing euphrates so now you can see
[1:00:35] all this takes place between the sixth
[1:00:36] and seventh
[1:00:37] but if we break the idea of chronology
[1:00:40] you can have the sixth trumpet
[1:00:41] spanning all these other trumpets can
[1:00:43] happen in between because you do that
[1:00:45] with the fifth seal
[1:00:46] and if it works with the fifth seal why
[1:00:48] would it work with the sixth trumpet and
[1:00:50] why wouldn't it work with the sixth file
[1:00:54] i'm not saying that i know what they are
[1:00:56] i don't know what they are but i'm just
[1:00:57] saying
[1:00:58] what you see true in the scriptures is
[1:01:00] true
[1:01:02] and if that seal can can come into
[1:01:04] effect
[1:01:05] for the souls on the altar before the
[1:01:07] first church age
[1:01:08] all the way through amen then why can't
[1:01:11] the sixth trumpet already be open
[1:01:13] even if the other five hadn't blown yet
[1:01:17] it can just let it be true
[1:01:20] because brother branham said the six the
[1:01:23] six trumpets open
[1:01:24] he said it so let it be true
[1:01:27] but don't make that equal all five or
[1:01:30] finished don't do that
[1:01:33] does that make sense the same thing with
[1:01:36] the sixth file when he points to the
[1:01:38] ecumenical movement
[1:01:39] amen in the paganism from the kings of
[1:01:41] the east the syrian babylonian religion
[1:01:43] moving over into christianity amen when
[1:01:46] he make when he makes that correlation
[1:01:48] that's fine that's true i believe that
[1:01:51] with all my heart
[1:01:52] and between that time amen and the
[1:01:53] seventh vial amen
[1:01:55] there's a gap and in that gap there's a
[1:01:57] ministry
[1:01:59] that reveals to us the three unclean
[1:02:01] spirits the rapture sets in
[1:02:04] and then there's a gathering to the
[1:02:05] battle of armageddon that's all true
[1:02:08] but that doesn't mean the first five
[1:02:10] vials have already poured out and taken
[1:02:12] effect upon the earth
[1:02:14] they have in the church ages
[1:02:17] there's a revolving history
[1:02:20] could it have happened in the church
[1:02:21] ages and could it happen again during
[1:02:24] the tribulation period
[1:02:26] yeah i don't know i'm not saying
[1:02:29] i'm not drawing the conclusion but were
[1:02:31] there viles poured out in the church
[1:02:32] ages
[1:02:33] yes will there be plagues that fall in
[1:02:36] the three and a half year tribulation
[1:02:38] yes who's going to bring those plagues
[1:02:41] those two witnesses brother branham says
[1:02:44] so let's not draw conclusions
[1:02:48] that that brother branham didn't draw
[1:02:51] let's just let what he says be true this
[1:02:54] came between the sixth and seventh
[1:02:55] trumpet the sixth trumpet and the sixth
[1:02:57] seal open at the same time that's true
[1:03:00] that doesn't mean there can't be another
[1:03:02] sequence that doesn't mean there won't
[1:03:04] be another revolving history and there
[1:03:06] hasn't been before
[1:03:07] this is what he says is true
[1:03:10] even the sixth seal he says the sixth
[1:03:12] seal and the sixth trumpet open at the
[1:03:14] same time
[1:03:14] and he ties it to the persecution to the
[1:03:17] jews that's been recently he says
[1:03:19] and then talking about coming to world
[1:03:21] war ii and that happened
[1:03:22] between the third and fourth church age
[1:03:24] or be the third and fourth seal
[1:03:28] right and then the coming of the lord
[1:03:31] i mean the seventh seal is from genesis
[1:03:34] to revelation and
[1:03:35] the everything so
[1:03:39] let's not get dogmatic and let's not
[1:03:42] get natural in our thinking let's let's
[1:03:45] let what brother bram said be
[1:03:46] absolutely true and not make it fit our
[1:03:49] own picture
[1:03:50] but say god give me the right picture of
[1:03:53] what he's saying
[1:03:55] let me just say what he said and believe
[1:03:56] what he said to be true
[1:03:58] and then you have to show us the rest of
[1:04:00] it
[1:04:02] now there's a reason i said this oh my
[1:04:05] goodness
[1:04:06] this is where i'm going to get in
[1:04:07] trouble and i love you guys
[1:04:10] and you love me but i just want to share
[1:04:12] something that i saw
[1:04:14] and i don't want to draw a conclusion i
[1:04:15] don't want to say this is that but i
[1:04:17] just want to show something out of the
[1:04:18] scriptures
[1:04:19] so let's look to revelation chapter 8.
[1:04:28] revelation chapter 8
[1:04:32] the trumpets begin in revelation chapter
[1:04:34] 8
[1:04:35] verse 7 with the first trumpet but i
[1:04:38] want to go to verse 10 and look at the
[1:04:39] third trumpet
[1:04:43] and the third angel sounded and there
[1:04:45] fell a great star from heaven burning as
[1:04:47] it were a lamp and it fell upon the
[1:04:48] third part of the rivers
[1:04:50] and upon the fountains of waters and the
[1:04:53] name of the star is called wormwood
[1:04:55] and the third part of the waters became
[1:04:57] wormwood and men and many men died of
[1:04:59] the waters because they were made
[1:05:01] bitter all right
[1:05:04] that's this scripture right here and and
[1:05:07] this word
[1:05:08] wormwood is very very interesting under
[1:05:10] the third trumpet
[1:05:11] now i i want to make a disclaimer here
[1:05:14] i'm just sharing with you something that
[1:05:16] i see and i have no authority to say
[1:05:18] this is that i just want to share
[1:05:20] something
[1:05:20] because i want you to see something so
[1:05:23] just
[1:05:23] let me be your brother i'm not i'm not a
[1:05:26] prophet i'm not taking the authority of
[1:05:28] a prophet but i just see something
[1:05:31] when you look at an event in history
[1:05:34] from 1986
[1:05:36] there was an event called the nuclear
[1:05:37] meltdown in chernobyl
[1:05:39] we remember that i was a young boy but
[1:05:41] there was a nuclear meltdown in
[1:05:42] chernobyl
[1:05:44] and the word chernobyl is a ukrainian
[1:05:47] word
[1:05:48] and it used some places in rural russia
[1:05:52] for a weed called wormwood so this is
[1:05:55] out this is taken out of an article
[1:05:57] from july 26 1986 from the new york
[1:05:59] times and there's a little clip out of
[1:06:01] that article it says
[1:06:02] a prominent russian writer showed from a
[1:06:04] ukrainian dictionary
[1:06:05] the word for wormwood a bitter wild herb
[1:06:07] uses a tonic in rural russia
[1:06:09] chernobyl so chernobyl in many places
[1:06:12] means
[1:06:13] wormwood that's interesting
[1:06:18] but it's just that just interesting
[1:06:20] chernobyl means wormwood
[1:06:24] this is a monument that was set down in
[1:06:27] 2011
[1:06:28] across the parking lot from a museum in
[1:06:31] the center of chernobyl
[1:06:33] does anybody recognize what that is it's
[1:06:36] a trumpeting angel
[1:06:37] the monument is called the monument of
[1:06:40] the third angel
[1:06:43] on purpose i mean they tied it right to
[1:06:44] revelation it's not that
[1:06:46] it's not some mysterious thing they they
[1:06:48] started talking
[1:06:49] when chernobyl had a nuclear meltdown it
[1:06:52] contaminated the waters it contaminated
[1:06:54] the rain
[1:06:54] there was contamination that spread
[1:06:56] through dust throughout
[1:06:58] eastern europe as far away as into
[1:07:01] russia
[1:07:01] and then to sweden and finland and all
[1:07:03] of that and it and it
[1:07:04] got in the rain and got in the waters
[1:07:06] all kinds of nuclear fallout
[1:07:08] nuclear mess that took place it was a
[1:07:10] big big deal in that part of the world
[1:07:13] but in 2011 on the 25th anniversary of
[1:07:16] chernobyl
[1:07:17] amen they set a monument in the middle
[1:07:18] chernobyl and that monument they sit
[1:07:21] there
[1:07:21] they title the monument of the third
[1:07:23] angel and it's a trumpeting angel
[1:07:25] that also is interesting if you look in
[1:07:28] the background you see that building
[1:07:30] across the parking lot there
[1:07:32] or the driveway or whatever that is that
[1:07:34] building is called the star wormwood
[1:07:36] museum
[1:07:39] the star wormwood museum you can go on
[1:07:42] google maps and type it in and it'll
[1:07:44] take you right to the spot to the center
[1:07:45] of chernobyl
[1:07:46] in the northern part of ukraine
[1:07:49] that's interesting that's super
[1:07:52] interesting
[1:07:55] now that's all can be anecdotal
[1:07:58] that's all interesting and i looked at
[1:08:01] this i had somebody tell me about this
[1:08:02] and i looked at i thought well that's
[1:08:04] interesting
[1:08:04] and i just sat on it because i mean what
[1:08:06] do you do with that i don't know it's
[1:08:07] interesting
[1:08:09] but the chernobyl means wormwood
[1:08:12] there's a nuclear meltdown it's a major
[1:08:15] catastrophe
[1:08:16] all sudden they have a museum called
[1:08:18] star wormwood
[1:08:19] they have a monument called the third
[1:08:21] angel it's a trumpeting angel
[1:08:23] all right out of the book of revelation
[1:08:24] revelation chapter 8 the third trumpet
[1:08:26] the third trumpeting angel
[1:08:29] but what got interesting for what made
[1:08:31] it interesting for me
[1:08:33] is when i was looking at something i
[1:08:35] came across
[1:08:36] a few articles and here mikhail
[1:08:39] gorbachev
[1:08:40] says he states flatly that chernobyl the
[1:08:42] chernobyl explosion
[1:08:44] was perhaps the real cause of the
[1:08:46] collapse of the soviet union
[1:08:49] this is what becomes a big deal
[1:08:53] because remember the trumpets
[1:08:56] are to gather israel to the homeland
[1:08:59] that's the purpose of the trumpets
[1:09:02] and and mikhail gorbachev said that the
[1:09:05] explosion chernobyl
[1:09:06] was perhaps the real cause of the
[1:09:09] collapse
[1:09:10] of the soviet union he says in another
[1:09:13] article
[1:09:14] i'm reading out of the world nuclear
[1:09:15] association
[1:09:17] it says former president gorbachev said
[1:09:19] that the chernobyl accident was more
[1:09:21] was a more important factor in the fall
[1:09:23] of the soviet union
[1:09:25] than perestrokia his program of liberal
[1:09:28] reform
[1:09:30] and the the economist published an
[1:09:32] article in april 26 2016 the 30th
[1:09:35] anniversary
[1:09:36] it says a nuclear disaster that brought
[1:09:38] down an empire
[1:09:39] chernobyl led to thousands of deaths
[1:09:41] including that of the soviet union
[1:09:44] all sudden that gets interesting then it
[1:09:46] gets interesting for a very specific
[1:09:48] reason
[1:09:49] i've got an article here i printed from
[1:09:51] june 12 2019
[1:09:53] from the canadian jewish news it's
[1:09:56] titled the connection between chernobyl
[1:09:59] and modern jewish history
[1:10:02] chernobyl was a really active site for
[1:10:05] judaism there was a
[1:10:06] there was a big community of hasidic
[1:10:08] jews back before
[1:10:10] world war one and actually the last
[1:10:13] rabbi in chernobyl was arrested by
[1:10:16] stalin in 1933
[1:10:18] and in prison and later he was killed in
[1:10:20] 1942
[1:10:22] but when the nazis nazis and the german
[1:10:25] nazis when they came into ukraine
[1:10:27] they came into chernobyl and within a
[1:10:29] year's time
[1:10:30] they killed every jew that was in
[1:10:32] chernobyl
[1:10:34] so that's got a real jaded history there
[1:10:36] with the jews
[1:10:38] but but that's not really what i want to
[1:10:40] get to that's just a point of interest
[1:10:43] but it says i'm going to read right out
[1:10:45] of this article
[1:10:47] it says today the explosion of the
[1:10:49] nuclear plant in chernobyl is ground
[1:10:51] zero for the history of ukraine
[1:10:53] it is arguably the major transitional
[1:10:55] point leading to the collapse of the
[1:10:57] soviet union
[1:10:58] and consequent transformation of the
[1:11:00] world map
[1:11:03] eyewitness report rumors that the
[1:11:05] plant's explosion had been the divine
[1:11:07] punishment
[1:11:08] for ukraine and belarus for what had
[1:11:10] transpired there during the holocaust
[1:11:12] that was just some people who survived
[1:11:13] that that was what they said
[1:11:15] but when you get down here this article
[1:11:18] started to catch my attention it said
[1:11:22] tens of thousands of jews made the
[1:11:25] decision to
[1:11:26] leave the collapsing soviet union in the
[1:11:28] late 1980s
[1:11:29] primarily because of the disaster they
[1:11:32] paved the way for what became a mass
[1:11:34] exodus
[1:11:35] leading to a million and a half
[1:11:36] russian-speaking jews leaving to the
[1:11:38] living today around the globe when the
[1:11:41] ussr was standing and it was strong
[1:11:44] it it had there was there was more than
[1:11:46] a million
[1:11:47] russian-speaking jews trapped behind the
[1:11:50] lines of ussr
[1:11:52] and they could not get back to the
[1:11:53] homeland through the 1960s 70s
[1:11:56] and 80s but but as ussr
[1:12:00] as the ussr was growing in strength it
[1:12:02] was trying amen to exploit science it
[1:12:04] was trying to grow
[1:12:05] and become a world empire it was it was
[1:12:07] a global empire
[1:12:08] but they started having financial
[1:12:10] problems they started struggling
[1:12:11] amen and the collapse at chernobyl was
[1:12:14] huge and devastating to the ussr
[1:12:17] the soviet union it would trigger a
[1:12:19] series of events
[1:12:20] that started collapsing the soviet union
[1:12:22] and within six years
[1:12:23] they had totally dissolved the ussr and
[1:12:26] in that time this is 1986
[1:12:28] by 1989 amen they had opened up the
[1:12:31] berlin wall and allowed
[1:12:32] freedom between the eastern and western
[1:12:34] berlin freedom of travel by 1991
[1:12:36] november the berlin wall had come down
[1:12:38] and by december of 1991 the ussr had
[1:12:41] completely come down
[1:12:43] and when it completely fell amen all of
[1:12:46] a sudden
[1:12:47] the jews that had been trapped behind
[1:12:49] those lines could now
[1:12:51] go back home amen many of them for the
[1:12:53] first time
[1:12:54] and there began to be mass exoduses
[1:12:57] but they didn't all go quickly some of
[1:13:00] them still stayed behind
[1:13:02] and when they stayed behind all of a
[1:13:04] sudden little wars broke out
[1:13:06] remember chechnya remember bosnia
[1:13:09] herzegovina
[1:13:10] remember uh yugoslavia
[1:13:14] all of this region became destabilized
[1:13:16] and all these little wars broke out and
[1:13:18] the jews kept running away from wars
[1:13:20] because trumpets are wars too
[1:13:23] and started running back to the homeland
[1:13:25] and after the ussr dissolved in 1991
[1:13:28] the years 1992 to 1995
[1:13:31] saw the greatest years of travel of
[1:13:34] aaliyah
[1:13:34] returning to the homeland of
[1:13:36] russian-speaking jews
[1:13:38] in fact it was so big it became a
[1:13:40] problem
[1:13:41] in israel and i found a i found a
[1:13:44] peer-reviewed paper written by i believe
[1:13:46] it was a phd grad
[1:13:48] said that there's so many
[1:13:50] russian-speaking jews now coming into
[1:13:52] israel
[1:13:52] it's changing the political structure
[1:13:54] and it's changing the culture of israel
[1:13:57] and between 1989 i believe it is 1989
[1:14:01] and 2006
[1:14:02] almost a million russian-speaking jews
[1:14:05] go back into israel
[1:14:07] israel's a tiny country that's a million
[1:14:11] jews
[1:14:11] why because because there has to be
[1:14:14] under the trumpets
[1:14:15] an in-gathering of the jews back to the
[1:14:18] promised land
[1:14:18] amen as long as ussr was a world empire
[1:14:21] they couldn't get
[1:14:23] back they wouldn't permit a million of
[1:14:25] them to leave so
[1:14:28] i'm not drawing the conclusion i'm not
[1:14:30] saying this is that i'm just telling you
[1:14:31] what's in history what history says and
[1:14:34] chernobyl means wormwood
[1:14:36] and somebody thought enough of it to put
[1:14:37] a monument of a trumpeting angel right
[1:14:39] in the middle of town
[1:14:41] right across from a museum called star
[1:14:43] wormwood museum
[1:14:45] and brother branham said god makes them
[1:14:47] testify of the truth
[1:14:48] that's why on every ambulance there's a
[1:14:50] pole with a serpent wrapped around it
[1:14:52] amen to point back
[1:14:53] to divine healing
[1:14:57] so the reason i the reason i say that's
[1:15:00] interesting
[1:15:02] i may be wrong but it's interesting
[1:15:05] how many agree that's very very
[1:15:08] interesting
[1:15:09] if brother branham was here i'd be like
[1:15:10] brother man was that it
[1:15:12] was that it but you can see
[1:15:15] you we didn't make up the name of we
[1:15:17] didn't make up the name
[1:15:18] of the city we didn't put the angel
[1:15:20] statute trumpeting angel
[1:15:23] statue there we didn't put the museum
[1:15:25] there
[1:15:26] we didn't make the nuclear reactor fall
[1:15:27] out and we didn't make that cause the
[1:15:29] crumble of the ussr
[1:15:31] and we didn't make that cause almost a
[1:15:33] million jews
[1:15:34] go back to the homeland but it's what
[1:15:37] brother ben explained to us
[1:15:39] what the trumpets were for and the
[1:15:42] reason i show that
[1:15:43] is because if that's if that has
[1:15:44] something to do with it even if that's
[1:15:46] not
[1:15:46] all of it even if that has something to
[1:15:48] do with that that's under the third
[1:15:49] trumpet and brother branham said
[1:15:51] the sixth trumpet opened amen in world
[1:15:54] war ii
[1:15:55] right before world war ii the sixth
[1:15:56] trumpet opened but here you have this
[1:15:58] event
[1:15:59] taking place in 1986.
[1:16:02] so we've got to get out of our mind the
[1:16:04] idea of everything happens in
[1:16:06] chronological order
[1:16:08] god can do what he wants when he wants
[1:16:11] the way he wants to bring his children
[1:16:13] back home amen in whatever
[1:16:15] sequence needs to happen he knows the
[1:16:17] sequence
[1:16:18] he knows what each number means and he
[1:16:21] knows when it's going to take place
[1:16:23] all we have to do is say what brother
[1:16:25] brenham said is the truth
[1:16:27] that that sixth trumpet and sixth seal
[1:16:29] open at the same time
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] does it mean more than that probably are
[1:16:33] there other applications yes
[1:16:35] but what he said was the truth right yes
[1:16:40] even mikhail gorbachev says that that
[1:16:43] chernobyl explosion
[1:16:44] was the likely reason it started the
[1:16:47] events
[1:16:48] that would collapse the ussr so that god
[1:16:52] so that the israelites the jews could go
[1:16:54] back to the homeland
[1:16:56] so that they could get back in time for
[1:16:58] the prophecy to be fulfilled of
[1:17:00] revelations 11
[1:17:01] and call out the 144 000
[1:17:05] now that's interesting but the real
[1:17:07] reason i went through that
[1:17:09] is for this
[1:17:13] that happened in my lifetime
[1:17:16] i saw it as a news article
[1:17:19] i saw him take sledgehammers when i was
[1:17:21] a boy and bash
[1:17:23] the berlin wall did you see that
[1:17:26] i heard about the collapse of ussr and i
[1:17:29] heard
[1:17:30] it was a good thing and the americans
[1:17:31] were happy
[1:17:34] i saw it as news i didn't realize it was
[1:17:38] god's plan
[1:17:41] i saw it as an event on the world stage
[1:17:45] i saw it as something that made the
[1:17:46] headlines made the papers i saw it as
[1:17:48] something that would be written in
[1:17:50] history books in the future
[1:17:51] i i saw it as history being taking place
[1:17:54] in my lifetime
[1:17:55] amen but i didn't realize that it was
[1:17:57] potentially prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:18:00] it was god
[1:18:00] gathering in regathering israel to the
[1:18:03] homeland so that he can so that he can
[1:18:05] blow the seventh trumpet
[1:18:09] what does that mean for you and i
[1:18:12] this is the important part because the
[1:18:15] entrepreneurs
[1:18:16] gather them back to the homeland back
[1:18:20] what's our homeland the word the open
[1:18:23] word
[1:18:25] and god will use events in our lives
[1:18:29] and to us they're just part of our
[1:18:31] history they're just an event that took
[1:18:33] place
[1:18:34] the plant shut down i lost my job i was
[1:18:36] in a car accident i had a family member
[1:18:38] die
[1:18:41] what what what if god are using events
[1:18:44] like that
[1:18:45] to drive us back to the homeland to
[1:18:47] bring us to the word
[1:18:48] amen to get us in a place where we come
[1:18:51] back to the word
[1:18:52] amen because what happens for the church
[1:18:54] what happens for israel
[1:18:55] also happens to you and i god also uses
[1:18:59] events amen he uses
[1:19:01] things that would become part of our
[1:19:03] story a catastrophe that happened around
[1:19:06] us
[1:19:06] things that that were odd things that
[1:19:08] that would make news
[1:19:09] and he uses them to bring i mean he uses
[1:19:12] them to bring
[1:19:13] israel back home but can he use those
[1:19:15] things to bring us to the word amen
[1:19:17] to drive us back to the homeland of his
[1:19:20] word
[1:19:20] to call us to the word brother abraham
[1:19:24] said
[1:19:24] in the church ages he said a seal would
[1:19:27] break a trumpet would sound
[1:19:29] and that trumpet was to gather the
[1:19:31] people to the word
[1:19:33] amen but that trumpet would cause a
[1:19:34] spiritual war
[1:19:37] and you say oh how horrible why would a
[1:19:40] trumpet cause a war
[1:19:42] why would we want a war i mean we just
[1:19:44] want the things of god to be sweet and
[1:19:45] peaceful
[1:19:46] no god used the war to force people to
[1:19:48] make a decision
[1:19:50] there's no more sitting on the fence
[1:19:51] there's no more waiting to see what will
[1:19:53] happen
[1:19:53] but god will bring a spiritual war
[1:19:56] to force the issue so that you couldn't
[1:20:00] stay in the catholic church and accept
[1:20:01] justification by faith
[1:20:03] it would start a war so that you had to
[1:20:05] make a choice and you had to move from
[1:20:07] one place to the other
[1:20:08] then you had to take a position on the
[1:20:10] issue
[1:20:13] he'll do the same thing to you and i
[1:20:15] he'll bring a war
[1:20:16] all around us amen trouble troublesome
[1:20:19] times troublesome things happening
[1:20:21] to get us off the fence and get us into
[1:20:23] motion
[1:20:24] to move to pick a side to move and take
[1:20:26] the word and get with the word
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:30] and it looks like just a news event that
[1:20:32] was just that something happened and now
[1:20:34] there's no more ussr
[1:20:36] why is there no more ussr because
[1:20:38] brother branham 7 never said
[1:20:39] he never had his whole church stand up
[1:20:41] and say watch ussr
[1:20:43] watch ussr but he said stand up and now
[1:20:46] repeat after me
[1:20:47] watch russia watch russia watch the king
[1:20:50] of the north amen so that means when you
[1:20:52] come down to the very end of time
[1:20:54] there can't be a ussr there's got to be
[1:20:56] russia
[1:20:59] so god will blow up a reactor
[1:21:02] [Applause]
[1:21:03] why because the prophet said watch
[1:21:06] russia watch the king of the north
[1:21:07] and he's got to get his children he's
[1:21:09] got to get the jews back home so that
[1:21:11] they can receive those two prophets
[1:21:14] and we thought that was news that wasn't
[1:21:16] news that was prophecy being fulfilled
[1:21:18] that was god
[1:21:19] moving his people
[1:21:22] in the church we see the war amen
[1:21:24] between luther
[1:21:25] i mean the catholics and the lutherans
[1:21:27] between those who are saved by
[1:21:29] justification and those want to be saved
[1:21:30] by work
[1:21:31] war breaks out why because he's got to
[1:21:33] drive them to the word amen the elect
[1:21:35] have to get
[1:21:36] back home to the word why does he let
[1:21:40] trouble strike us
[1:21:42] because he's trying to move us back to
[1:21:44] the word
[1:21:45] why did laban's sons get so disgusted
[1:21:48] with jacob
[1:21:48] because jacob had to get back to the
[1:21:50] homeland because it was now time
[1:21:52] joseph was on the scene but we had to
[1:21:53] get we got to get back so
[1:21:55] so benjamin could come on the scene and
[1:21:58] so he would allow
[1:21:59] strife
[1:22:03] between laban's sons and jacob
[1:22:06] to make jacob uncomfortable so that
[1:22:09] jacob would want to go back home
[1:22:12] because jacob had to go back home to
[1:22:14] fulfill the word
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:18] we've got to get all the way in
[1:22:21] possession of this land
[1:22:24] all of the word we have to be in
[1:22:26] possession
[1:22:28] and god is orchestrating news events all
[1:22:32] over the planet
[1:22:34] and now we watch the news and this war
[1:22:37] and
[1:22:38] this economic collapse and this
[1:22:41] catastrophe and this
[1:22:43] when i look at what happened at
[1:22:45] chernobyl now i wonder
[1:22:47] what's going on what's going on
[1:22:51] a worldwide pandemic a financial
[1:22:54] disaster looming
[1:22:55] a china and the south china sea i wonder
[1:22:58] what's happening
[1:22:59] i wonder what's going on i don't know i
[1:23:02] can't say
[1:23:03] i'm not a prophet i can't draw the
[1:23:05] conclusion but i know this
[1:23:07] that whatever is happening is happening
[1:23:09] according to god's program
[1:23:10] and god's moving his program forward and
[1:23:13] it may be a news article
[1:23:14] it may be a blip on your phone it may be
[1:23:17] a flashing latest news but that latest
[1:23:19] news may be the very thing that's
[1:23:21] jumping right out of the page of our
[1:23:22] bible
[1:23:24] and we're going to miss it just as easy
[1:23:25] we've missed the ones before
[1:23:27] and they've missed them all down through
[1:23:28] time we can miss them but we need to be
[1:23:30] tuned in
[1:23:31] not to try to interpret but be tuned
[1:23:32] into the fact that god is accomplishing
[1:23:35] his purpose on the earth and he's moving
[1:23:37] nations and he's moving peoples and he's
[1:23:39] moving armies to accomplish his purpose
[1:23:41] and what is his purpose his purpose is
[1:23:43] get the bride together for a rapture and
[1:23:45] get the jews together to receive
[1:23:47] the messiah so everything that's
[1:23:50] happening
[1:23:51] i can assure you is happening in line
[1:23:53] with that objective
[1:23:54] because he had one purpose one goal one
[1:23:56] thought that he wanted to achieve in the
[1:23:58] entire bible
[1:23:59] and that purpose and that thought is
[1:24:01] being achieved on this earth now
[1:24:03] and has everything to do with you and i
[1:24:06] it has everything to do with those 144
[1:24:09] 000 jews it's got everything to do with
[1:24:10] them
[1:24:11] and now it's not just news it's my life
[1:24:14] and it's affecting my life
[1:24:15] and instead of making me weary and
[1:24:17] instead of making me nervous
[1:24:18] amen i wanted to drive me to my homeland
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:23] amen the economy falls apart drive me to
[1:24:26] my homeland
[1:24:27] amen my work falls apart drive me to my
[1:24:29] homeland the nation crumbles around me
[1:24:31] drive me to my homeland let every
[1:24:33] trumpet sound
[1:24:34] drive me to my homeland to where our
[1:24:37] focus becomes the word
[1:24:38] and the word only that every solution to
[1:24:41] every problem is the word
[1:24:43] not a stimulus check and not a credit
[1:24:45] card and not a new job but my solution
[1:24:47] is the word
[1:24:48] because that was the point it wasn't to
[1:24:50] rebuild another reactor
[1:24:52] amen and it wasn't to put together the
[1:24:54] ussr again
[1:24:55] but the point was to bring forth the
[1:24:57] word
[1:25:00] praise be to god i don't know about you
[1:25:05] but something about that thrills my
[1:25:07] heart
[1:25:09] i don't know what else is there i don't
[1:25:12] know what else happened
[1:25:13] i don't know what the other trumpets are
[1:25:14] i don't even know if this is for sure
[1:25:16] the fulfillment of that trumpet
[1:25:17] all i can tell you is what i see and
[1:25:20] what i see is pretty amazing
[1:25:22] if that's only a part of it it's amazing
[1:25:26] it's amazing that god can do that
[1:25:29] something right out of his word he can
[1:25:31] do that to bring his children home
[1:25:33] and if he can do that
[1:25:36] listen just listen to me for a minute
[1:25:41] if he can collapse the ussr
[1:25:46] to get the jews to go back home
[1:25:51] what can he do to get us in position
[1:25:56] i mean now we're standing here
[1:26:00] in 2020 saying yeah the ussr collapse
[1:26:02] collapsed the ussr
[1:26:04] like it's no big deal but if you were
[1:26:07] alive in the early 80s
[1:26:11] if you lived in belarus or ukraine or
[1:26:13] you lived in poland
[1:26:15] it was a big deal there's no collapsing
[1:26:19] the usr
[1:26:20] ussr there's no stopping the empire
[1:26:24] but god could bring it down and he could
[1:26:27] orchestrate events that would take place
[1:26:29] you know in chernobyl in that reactor
[1:26:32] oh my goodness
[1:26:36] there was four reactors there was plans
[1:26:37] to build more
[1:26:39] guess which reactor blew up
[1:26:44] what seal are we under
[1:26:49] guess which reactor blew up number four
[1:26:53] well that's interesting too
[1:26:58] they were trying to do a safety test to
[1:27:01] prevent an explosion
[1:27:06] they knew that they had a risky
[1:27:08] situation if they lost power
[1:27:09] and they had to go to backup generators
[1:27:11] it was a few seconds with no power and
[1:27:12] they were trying to work their way
[1:27:13] through that to figure out how to keep
[1:27:14] the reactor alive
[1:27:15] so they knew they had a safety issue so
[1:27:17] they were running a safety test
[1:27:19] to prevent this nuclear meltdown
[1:27:22] and during the safety test to prevent a
[1:27:24] nuclear meltdown
[1:27:25] they had a nuclear meltdown trying to
[1:27:28] prevent a nuclear meltdown
[1:27:30] you look at the irony of god they're
[1:27:32] trying to prevent a nuclear meltdown
[1:27:34] and god allows that to be the sequence
[1:27:36] of events that would allow a nuclear
[1:27:38] meltdown because god needed a nuclear
[1:27:41] meltdown
[1:27:43] so even if you try to safeguard yourself
[1:27:45] against
[1:27:46] god working you into your position there
[1:27:48] is nothing you can do to safeguard
[1:27:50] yourself
[1:27:51] when god wants to accomplish something
[1:27:52] in our lives amen there's
[1:27:54] no safety net no hedge fund no
[1:27:56] investment
[1:27:57] is ever going to save us because if god
[1:27:59] wants it to collapse
[1:28:00] it will collapse not so that we can be
[1:28:03] punished so that he can get us back in
[1:28:05] our land
[1:28:05] back to the word if there's something
[1:28:07] keeping us back the boundary of the ussr
[1:28:10] the iron the iron curtain was keeping
[1:28:13] the jews from the homeland
[1:28:14] so god would collapse a nuclear reactor
[1:28:17] during a safety test to prevent a
[1:28:19] collapse of a nuclear reactor
[1:28:22] do you see how beautiful god is you see
[1:28:24] how perfect he is he can do whatever he
[1:28:27] wants and man can't stop him
[1:28:28] and you can't stop him and neither do we
[1:28:30] want to stop him i want to say god
[1:28:32] give me in my land god take away every
[1:28:35] barrier
[1:28:35] god take away every iron curtain that is
[1:28:38] keeping me from fully possessing my land
[1:28:40] break down the iron curtains in my mind
[1:28:42] amen so i quit looking at it through
[1:28:44] denominational eyes so i quit looking at
[1:28:46] it through intellect but by revelation
[1:28:49] rip that iron curtain open and let me
[1:28:51] see it the way your prophet saw it
[1:28:53] let me see it the way you showed it to
[1:28:54] him
[1:28:56] he said i may not be able to explain it
[1:28:58] in a way to make sense to you but i know
[1:29:00] exactly what i'm talking about
[1:29:02] and i say god give me that same
[1:29:05] vision that same revelation you gave him
[1:29:07] so that i'll know what he's talking
[1:29:08] about
[1:29:11] rip the iron curtain away from my mind
[1:29:13] lord
[1:29:14] set me free from human intellect set me
[1:29:17] free from denominational teaching on the
[1:29:19] bible
[1:29:20] set me free from my own conclusions that
[1:29:22] i've drawn and break the iron curtain
[1:29:24] away from me
[1:29:25] and if you gotta melt down this reactor
[1:29:27] in my heart melt it down
[1:29:28] and let me go free
[1:29:32] what has held us back denominational
[1:29:35] thinking has been the thing that has
[1:29:36] held us back the most
[1:29:39] but the ego wants to fly
[1:29:42] i want to fly i don't want to misplace
[1:29:45] the word
[1:29:46] i don't want to misinterpret the word
[1:29:48] but i want to believe exactly what
[1:29:49] brother benham said
[1:29:51] and i don't want to keep skimming over
[1:29:53] what he said and say well i don't
[1:29:54] understand that and just keep looking
[1:29:55] elsewhere for good quotes
[1:30:00] i want god to show it to me i wanted
[1:30:03] full possession of my land if brother
[1:30:06] bennett preached speech to trump's and
[1:30:07] feast the trumpets is for me
[1:30:10] if he preached future home future homes
[1:30:12] for me whatever he preached if he
[1:30:13] preached crisis and mr god revealed
[1:30:15] christ as the mystery god reveals for me
[1:30:17] if he came and opened the book of
[1:30:19] revelation the book of revelation is for
[1:30:21] me
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:25] and i don't want the old iron curtain in
[1:30:27] my mind to keep me back from my land
[1:30:30] well this happens over here and this
[1:30:31] happens over the tribulation period and
[1:30:33] this happens here
[1:30:35] just let brother branham say what he
[1:30:37] said and let it be true
[1:30:39] and say god how is it that the trumpets
[1:30:41] are in between
[1:30:42] the six and seventh file
[1:30:46] how is it show me how the sixth seal and
[1:30:48] the sixth trumpet opened at the same
[1:30:50] time
[1:30:51] instead of explaining it away why don't
[1:30:53] you just show it to me lord
[1:30:55] show it to me take the old
[1:30:57] denominational nuclear power reactor
[1:31:01] and melt it down blow it up
[1:31:05] burn it down the old
[1:31:08] i pigeonholed this scripture here and i
[1:31:11] pigeonholed this scripture here
[1:31:12] and i pigeonholed this scripture here
[1:31:14] what is that denominational thinking
[1:31:21] lord melt that thing down
[1:31:25] help me to quit trying to save my old
[1:31:29] understanding
[1:31:31] through a safety test
[1:31:36] just let me read the message with
[1:31:37] revelation
[1:31:39] just give me eyes to see in a heart to
[1:31:41] perceive lord
[1:31:42] let me walk in the light as you're in
[1:31:44] the light and lord as you reveal more
[1:31:46] let me walk in that and let me stick
[1:31:48] with it and let me stay with it and keep
[1:31:50] walking in it and
[1:31:51] let me see your word unfold itself
[1:31:56] if the prophet preached it it's for us
[1:31:59] it may not be for me today but it's for
[1:32:00] me
[1:32:02] it might be for me next week but i'm
[1:32:03] going to stick with it till next week
[1:32:04] comes
[1:32:06] because it's for me and i want to stay
[1:32:08] with it until he opens the word
[1:32:10] i want god to break
[1:32:14] the iron curtain from me
[1:32:17] and let me go free and if it involves
[1:32:21] a meltdown then let it melt down
[1:32:27] if it involves the collapse of the
[1:32:29] nation let the nation collapse
[1:32:33] but keep me in your land keep me in your
[1:32:36] word
[1:32:37] man let's all stand i hope you
[1:32:41] understand my heart
[1:32:43] what i'm trying to say and please don't
[1:32:46] make me say something i didn't mean to
[1:32:48] say
[1:32:51] see how perfect the word of god is
[1:32:58] all history is revolving around this
[1:33:01] word
[1:33:05] the babylonian kingdom moving into the
[1:33:07] kingdom of the medes of the persians
[1:33:08] moving in the kingdom of greece
[1:33:10] moving into rome where do you find that
[1:33:13] here rome splitting into an eastern and
[1:33:16] western kingdom
[1:33:18] why did they split well because in the
[1:33:20] byzantine empire and there was a
[1:33:23] that's not why they split they split
[1:33:25] because daniel saw it split
[1:33:30] you see we read our history books and
[1:33:32] this is the reason
[1:33:33] the ussr came down this is the reason
[1:33:36] the roman empire split in the eastern
[1:33:37] western this is the reason
[1:33:39] that's not the reason that's not the
[1:33:42] reason those are just the events god
[1:33:43] used the reason was daniel saw it that
[1:33:45] way
[1:33:46] and that's the way it had to be what's
[1:33:49] the reason the reason is it's already
[1:33:51] written here
[1:33:51] and before it was written here it was in
[1:33:53] god's mind it was a finished work from
[1:33:54] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:56] that's why the usr collapsed that's why
[1:33:59] amen there was a holocaust
[1:34:00] that's why 200 000 000 demons came out
[1:34:03] into the armies of hitler muslin stalin
[1:34:05] that's why there was a world war ii
[1:34:07] that's why europe was
[1:34:08] almost completely taken over by hitler's
[1:34:10] army
[1:34:12] why because hitler was such a good
[1:34:14] strategist
[1:34:15] no because it was in the word
[1:34:19] it was already in the scriptures and and
[1:34:22] when those
[1:34:22] demons came out they went into those
[1:34:24] armies what were they trying to do
[1:34:25] what was hitler trying to do hitler was
[1:34:29] trying to bring the third right
[1:34:31] what was the third right the third
[1:34:33] empire what third empire
[1:34:35] what was the first empire the roman
[1:34:37] empire what was the second empire the
[1:34:38] holy roman empire and he was trying to
[1:34:40] bring the third
[1:34:42] empire he
[1:34:45] i mean he declared it openly it wasn't
[1:34:47] hiding what
[1:34:48] made him want to do that amen there was
[1:34:50] demon powers anointing him
[1:34:52] because it was written in the word
[1:34:56] and he's trying to bring back the roman
[1:34:58] empire and brother brenham said those
[1:35:00] old roman spirits look how they
[1:35:01] persecuted the jews and you say that
[1:35:03] wasn't rome
[1:35:03] that was germany and that was italy and
[1:35:05] that was russia no he says no it's the
[1:35:08] same
[1:35:08] spirit look they did the same thing and
[1:35:11] even testified of it being the same
[1:35:13] spirit
[1:35:13] because he wanted to bring in the third
[1:35:15] right the third empire
[1:35:17] amen
[1:35:20] why did he do that why why was hitler so
[1:35:23] demon possessed
[1:35:24] why did he have such a hatred for the
[1:35:25] jews why did he have
[1:35:27] i mean why did they have such
[1:35:29] technological advances to conquer the
[1:35:31] world
[1:35:31] to rid it of all jews why why why why
[1:35:34] because
[1:35:35] he was falling right in line under the
[1:35:37] seals
[1:35:38] he was catching the same inspiration he
[1:35:40] became a preview
[1:35:42] of the beast when the when the
[1:35:43] antichrist would fully incarnate the
[1:35:45] pope
[1:35:46] and what was he he's in the same vein in
[1:35:49] the same
[1:35:49] sequence of events in the same revolving
[1:35:52] history of prophecy
[1:35:53] amen only not in full measure yet he
[1:35:55] wasn't the full incarnation because no
[1:35:57] we know that'll be in the pope brother
[1:35:58] venom said so but he was foreshadowing
[1:36:01] what would come
[1:36:02] why because the prophecy is already in
[1:36:05] the book
[1:36:06] and it's unfolding in a revolving
[1:36:07] history
[1:36:09] why did rome hate the jews same reason
[1:36:12] praise god friends everything in our
[1:36:15] history
[1:36:16] revolves around this book right here
[1:36:20] and what was it all doing all of history
[1:36:23] the wars and
[1:36:24] this and that what was it doing it was
[1:36:27] moving god's program
[1:36:28] forward and what's it doing today
[1:36:32] moving god's program forward
[1:36:35] and guess what i'm part of his program
[1:36:39] everything around me is trying to what
[1:36:41] move me
[1:36:42] which is part of his program forward not
[1:36:45] shut me down
[1:36:47] not hurt me not destroy me not depress
[1:36:50] me
[1:36:50] but everything around me is trying to
[1:36:52] move his program forward
[1:36:54] and i say god let me move forward
[1:36:58] let's bow our heads and pray dear
[1:37:00] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[1:37:02] this word
[1:37:05] god i pray that you would just lord fix
[1:37:07] all the broken pieces lord
[1:37:09] as it comes out i pray that you'd piece
[1:37:12] it together the way you want it lord
[1:37:14] i pray that you'd bless your people to
[1:37:16] receive your word
[1:37:18] that we can walk lord in line with your
[1:37:20] word and obedience to your word
[1:37:22] watching it unfold itself lord we thank
[1:37:26] you for the revelation of the word lord
[1:37:28] and
[1:37:28] how it lifts us higher lord and how we
[1:37:30] can see like we've never seen before
[1:37:33] and we're praying god that you would
[1:37:34] just let us see the way you reveal it to
[1:37:36] your prophet lord
[1:37:38] that we can see what he was seeing lord
[1:37:40] that we can see this book unveiled the
[1:37:42] way he saw it unveiled
[1:37:44] show us every mystery show us every type
[1:37:47] lord show us our place
[1:37:50] and show us what you're doing in our
[1:37:52] lives right now lord
[1:37:53] so that we can get with the program show
[1:37:56] us how you're moving us forward how
[1:37:58] you're trying to line us to the word
[1:38:00] bring us into the land show us lord
[1:38:03] let every circumstance lord move your
[1:38:05] kingdom forward
[1:38:07] help us to stop fighting lord or
[1:38:09] complaining
[1:38:10] but help us to get with the program and
[1:38:13] move forward with your program
[1:38:15] god you're for us you're never against
[1:38:18] us
[1:38:19] all these things have to be this way
[1:38:21] because you're using the trumpets to
[1:38:23] draw us into the land
[1:38:25] you're using even strife to get us to
[1:38:27] make a decision
[1:38:30] everything is good lord and everything's
[1:38:32] for your program
[1:38:34] bless your people lord god drive
[1:38:37] revelation into our hearts
[1:38:39] let this not be about information or
[1:38:41] news articles or
[1:38:43] even events in history but lord let it
[1:38:46] be about
[1:38:47] you your word the unfolding of your
[1:38:50] mystery lord

[1:38:53] secrets to her lord
