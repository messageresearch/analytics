am i on yeah i turned myself back off but i was on god bless you it's good to be here with you this morning say god bless you for coming out amen we missed the service on wednesday so there's an anticipation to be together again and i have to say god bless you while we're standing if we could turn to second timothy chapter two we'll read a few verses from second timothy chapter two i just want to welcome all the visitors i know there was a banquet in town last night or in the area and brought something in god bless you it's good for you to be here with us i welcome you and i also know brother nathaniel and sister charity science are here god bless you it's good to have you guys back with us and say welcome to all the visitors i also wanted to remind you i think there's a notice on the bulletin board and on the announcements but we're gonna have a question and answer session again on march 12th for all the adults so make sure if you got a question please turn them in in advance and i try to answer them i try to answer them in the order they come in as best as i can keep track of the order they come in so you can email them or you can put them at the welcome desk handwrite them and put them there so if you could do that i'd really appreciate it amen so let's read second timothy chapter 2 verse 3. thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warth entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier amen are you soldiers we haven't been called to a picnic we've been called to a battle amen this battle started long ago in heaven and it's the same war it's the same battles continuing here today and we've been called soldiers in this battle but he says that no man no man that worth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier the apostle paul was just drawing a parallel between the natural and bringing it over to the spiritual so that we would understand how we should walk and i'd like to take for a subject this morning as the lord wills an army prepared an army prepared let's bow our heads their heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day for this opportunity to be gathered here lord god what a privilege it is for us to stand before you god is a privilege to gather together and worship your name to sing your praises to hear lord the gifts in operation bringing glory to your name god as we turn to the preaching of the word now we just want to say we're looking to you lord not to any flesh being lord that's just a vessel that you've chosen to use in this hour but we're looking to you to come lord by the power of your spirit minister through lips of clay and bring us your word what you have for us in this hour what you're trying to accomplish through us at this moment in time we open ourselves to you lord and pray that you would speak directly to our hearts as we give you preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all take your seats don't say i appreciated the specials very much i appreciate what god is doing god is speaking through his bride not just one voice and not just one gift but god is using all of his bride because we know this isn't a one-man ministry this isn't just uh for a selected group of people but god is wants to do his work through his many membered bride and it'll be every joint supplying every member participating everybody being led of the spirit and contributing as every joint supplieth so we're not looking anymore to sit back comfortably and relax as a few people play the game and we cheer them from the sidelines those days are over and it's not as though you know we're we're watching the battle take place in another foreign field and we're rooting our soldiers on that's not how it is anymore now the battles come to us and we're participants we're the soldiers we're the front line we're not rooting for the front line we are the front line and so our whole attitude is shifting god is changing our the way we see things the way we feel about things he's changing our understanding he's he's tuning us in more acutely than we've ever been tuned in before to what is actually happening in the spirit world amen it's not that we didn't know these things it's not that we didn't believe them it's not that we didn't have a desire for them but god is making us more aware and more aware of what's going on all the time where we are and who we are and what our position is and what we're supposed to be doing and that's the thing that matters because god's going to have it his bride on on display and it's going to be the full power through the full bride so nobody gets to be left out so praise god you can't be left out if you're part of this bride you can't be left out but you have a position and you have a part and there's a purpose for you in this body of jesus christ but that's exciting to say that i can't be left out that's one that's one side one side of it is saying praise the lord i can't be left out praise the lord i'm part of it but on the other side comes a tremendous responsibility of taking your place so it's great to say i'm part of it praise god i'm part of this army but when you realize i'm part of this army means that i'm responsible to do my part in the army i there comes with that this is the way it always is in the kingdom of god too much is given much is required there's always this relationship with the lord where there's mutual dependency on one another amen in the body and there's always this great power and authority but it comes with great responsibility and humility god keeps it so balanced that that as he as he as he lifts the power and as he lifts the demonstrations or the gifts in the spirit he also lifts the responsibility amen and the utter dependence on him so that nothing gets out of whack nothing gets out of place and for that we thank him so you can rejoice and say i'm part of this army i can't be left out i can't be left behind nobody can take my place there's a place just for me that's on one side the most glorious thing that has ever happened to you and on the other side it's the most fearful thing that has ever happened to you at the same exact time because it because i have a place that nobody else can take that place i have a position that nobody can take my position there's a work for me to do that nobody else can take it means that god is going to chastise me and rebuke me and come after me until i fulfill that purpose so it's glorious but it's also fearful because it's going to happen friends and god's going to bring the chastisement that's needed he's going to work the circumstances out in our life that's required to keep us in that position because he's not going to pick somebody else to do the job he chose you from before the foundation of the world and he knew what age you would come forth he knew what bed and ground you would come forth in and he knew what purpose he purposed in his heart when he did it and nothing's going to afford that purpose he did it according to his own will and it's going to happen that's fearful i say it's glorious but it's fearful amen because if we're not doing that then you rest assured the the tender hand of jehovah is going to move along and bring the circumstances about to put us in that position [Music] we can't play with the things of god we can't just rejoice in the blessings and the benefits if we're not also willing to take the correction and the placing and the responsibility they come together we want to shout and dance and rejoice at who we are but who we are brings about a responsibility that we can't shirt that responsibility so the two go hand in hand we've got to be very careful now that we understand fully what's going on let's look back at first timothy chapter 6 and verse 11. first timothy 6 and 11 but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith he's telling timothy to fight the good fight of faith to actually fight don't sit on the sidelines don't watch somebody else do it but fight the good fight of faith fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life warren two thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses so the apostle paul was constantly using this language of warfare this language of fighting this language of soldiers and war and armies if you look through the old testament and you look at the nation of israel and then god called them to be an army he called them to fight he called them to war amen and that's just a natural type of a spiritual bride and and we can see our what we're supposed to be doing and what our position is by looking at what god did through israel i want to read out of the church age book from the revelation of jesus christ it says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word we said this before but if you want to know what the works of the devil is the prophet of god just told us it exposes his it reveals his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them prophet is going right back to terminology invincible army prevailing over the gates of the enemy it's all spiritual warfare and god wants to have victory in this hour now we haven't come to the hour where he wants to be defeated and we've not come to the hour when he wants a perpetual battle we're coming to the time where we're coming to the final battle we're coming to a time where we're coming to the final the final a showdown the final battle the final face-off amen that's going to absolutely reverse everything that was started in the garden of eden amen and further back what was started in heaven when war broke out there through rebellion it is all being reconciled restored and it's going to happen through these final moments in time and you're the army he picked to fight the battle i mean it's not we're not here to just perpetuate the battle we're here to finish it what what what kind of dedication will that require what kind of sincerity will that require what kind of prayer life will that require what is the requirement this day for that measure of manifestation these things don't come trivial they don't come easy amen they don't come without sacrifice but we're called to it it's for us to do this is the hour for us so with much is given much is required let's go to second corinthians second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds not anything natural they're not carnal carnal means natural not anything natural but they're mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ so when he talks about this warfare amen it's not carnal but it's strong through god to the pulling down of strongholds then he begins to describe this description in verse 5 is interesting casting down imaginations where do they take place in your mind and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god where's that knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought thought to the obedience of christ he's talking about where the greatest battle was fought is fought in the mind and the victory comes through the weapons of our warfare which are not carnal but they are spiritual and god wants us to fight this battle amen and the battle is not being fought over here and over there and over there the battle's being fought right here and he's going to have the final victory in a group of people that will not be overcome by satan's deception in his lives but his work will be completely revealed before them he will be laid bare and he will not be able to gain the victory over them because of the level of revelation that they've come to and the obedience they have and the subjection they have to the word of god will eliminate is a power of deception that's why the word has come so plain in this day and that's why the word that was given to us and delivered through a prophet is still being unfolded to us is coming more clear and more clear all the time because it's the revelation amen that gives us the weapons to fight the enemy because he comes through deception and god defeats him through revelation so we live in the hour of the greatest revelation because upon earth is the greatest deception but there's a people who've been equipped to overcome the deception amen but the equipment that we have is not carnal so it is not reasoning it is not the thoughts of man it is not the education of man amen but what god has given us is a revelation on his word amen if we want a revelation on the word we are going to have to be in the word it's been given to us in this hour the word has been given to us in this hour but it can't it can't be something that is just part of our lives amen a piece of our life i should say it that way that's not the hour we're called to friends this word that's been given to us isn't a portion of our life our our church family and going to church and and all of that two times a week traditionally that's always a part of everybody's life you know i'm part of this church and i attend that church and and you know we we we believe in god and and we have a portion of our life is given over to the things of god that's not the hour that we live in but we live into the hour where our whole life is given to this word it is our whole life we meditate on it we think about it we contemplate in it we feed on it around the clock amen if we're not playing a tape or listen to a book we're meditating on the words that we've heard we're talking about it with one another why because we've come to the greatest hour of victory but it's going to be by revelation on this word we've got to it's got to be more than part of our life amen it has to be our life and you can see in satan's eden how critical this is because there's distractions everywhere for all of us it used to be that preachers would harp on the teenagers in entertainment worldly things friends is closer than that it's for all of us satan's eden is there i mean we're immersed in it we're walking around in it we're bombarded by it it's going to take the word a full surrender and a full giving of ourselves to the word that includes that includes reading the message reading the bible listening to prophet coming to church having fellowship praying all of that's included but it's going to have to be our whole life not just part of our life it is you can't stop you know you have to work the scripture says that a man not work let him not eat they're still working that's still part of what god's called us to do we're not going to start a monastery and become monks that's not what god's called us to in this hour he's called us to be there in satan's eating as lights as those little lights the prophet saw i saw one just flicker here and one just flickered there and that was you and i friends and we're supposed to be there amen but but not consumed by those things we can become consumed by our job but we're not called to be consumed by our job we're there for his purpose we have to know god placed me there he gave me that job he put me there to fulfill his purpose and when he wants to change that he'll change that i'll go somewhere else and fulfill another purpose but i'm not here to outperform everybody else to crime the corporate ladder to spend all of my time immersed in this thing amen so i can have super success in what i'm doing here you're there to fulfill his purpose go and fulfill his purpose if he wants you to have success you'll have success but it's it's not where our heart should be our heart should not be in being the the most successful here our heart should not be in accomplishing the most here our heart should be and accomplishing the most right here [Music] what does he want from me spiritually if i never get a promotion i don't care as long as i'm promoted in the kingdom of god that's my only desire we're coming we're transitioning i don't know how else to say it and i can't qualify that i can't i can't give you facts and figures and i i can't show you statistics but i know in my spirit i know in my heart the way god's leading me this is another translation trans transition for the bride something is transitioning now god is wanting to lift us higher and we've been through so many of these times we'll lift this up amen and we always feel like this is the last one times where god works spiritually among us and he lifts us up in revelation and he lifts us up in a walk amen but then you'll find that god gives us time to absorb on that new level and every time he does you think this is the last one this is it this is the push to the finish line and the truth is it is but may not be according to our understanding but i sense in my spirit this is another transition this is another lifting up time and i want to be sensitive to that i want to pay attention to what god's telling us let's go to ephesians chapter 6 ephesians 6 and verse 10. ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places therefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints praise god what's the apostle paul telling us same thing he's telling you everywhere else you're in a war it's not one that your eyeballs can detect but this is a spiritual war and he's given you weapons and he's given you armament and none of it's carnal not one speck of its carnal it's all spiritual it's spiritual armament it's a spiritual weapon for a spiritual war and god is bringing us to a spiritual showdown we see manifestations of the spirit world all around us we'll see more manifestations all around us because that's the hour we're coming to but the manifestations isn't what we should be chasing it's the spiritual warfare the unseen brother bam said in putting on the hormone of god you know i believe it was lincoln that said one time in the time of peace prepare for war or it might not have been but it sounded like seems to me rather it was he made the statement the time of peace prepare for war and that would be a good thing for us to think about in time while everything is running smooth you better get ready for satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long the problem with us is when the pressure's off the dedication drops i can say us because i know what it's like i'm part of us when the when the pressure's on oh we live the most consecrated life i mean there's been times under pressure i have prayed all night it wasn't hard to stay awake and it wasn't hard to find something to pray about all right the pressure's on when it's intense amen dedication amen sincerity and consecration is no problem when the pressure comes on and you need god it's not hard to kick stuff out of your house when you find out that you get a diagnosis from the doctor amen and you know that there's going to be a real battle lays ahead of you it's not hard to go clean house but we get relaxed in a time of peace and that's when israel always got in trouble always they got in trouble when the pressure was off and i say god don't let us follow that path those things were done in the old testament for our examples so that we won't go that way amen if right now things are good amen and the economy is good and my job is good and my family is good and the church is good and everything's good that's the time to practice for war that's the time to drill that's the time to prepare amen when in the peace time is the time not to stop the drills not to stop amen when the sergeant would come along and say unpack that amen un unpack that parachute now pack it again packing it packing again you packed it that didn't look right unpack it pack it again why because right now you're not under pressure but you got to learn amen how to pack that thing and pack it right until it becomes second nature because in the heat of the battle when things are coming fast and you don't have time to think about it and you don't have time to make decisions and you ain't got time to go get prayed up and spend a week fasting and getting consecrated again you got to be ready when it happens it happens fast there's times in our life that disaster strikes us and it takes our breath the way it comes so fast [Applause] that's not the time amen to go get prayed up and start repenting of things and cleaning things down now's the time now is the time to be prepared because we know what the prophet told us we know what the end time is like we know we're in satan and we know beyond a shadow of doubt things are not going to stay the way they are now i don't know when i don't know when things will begin to tighten up i don't know when what the prophet told us is going to change but i guarantee one thing it's not going to stay the way it is now it may be months it may be years it may be decades so don't get me wrong i'm not saying something's happening tomorrow i'm just saying it's going to happen we should take advantage of every opportunity we got amen well we got bibles and we've all got church and we got fellowships and we got the message we should never take it for granted but we should be feeding on it constantly around the clock desperate as though tomorrow we're getting shipped off overseas to battle you never know when it's happening you never know when it's coming to your house you never know when it's coming to your life amen the laodicean condition is still all around us and it's still easy to slip into that condition praise be to god you know last sunday i came and i preached the message the way he told me to preach it and it wasn't a message i wanted to preach but god downloaded that message to me saturday morning in prayer and i had other funner things that i wanted to preach on things that i like i'd like to talk about feast of trumpets jubilee those are fun i like to dig down to the nitty-gritty and look at one word to me that's fun the half of you it's not but to some of you you like it so i had in my mind what i had other things that i've been dwelling on and meditating on other things directions i'd like to go in when i went to prayer god all of a sudden took over started downloading downloading downloading and i got up and you know we always want god to speak who wants god to speak so many times i pray if god would just tell me [Applause] and i'm on my knees and he just tells me exactly i'm not there's sometimes i'm laboring all weekend to try to find out what god wants to pray on sunday and i'll spend all day saturday and sometimes i've been in tears saturday night at nine o'clock weeping before the lord saying god i have nothing to feed your children i've got no inspiration for any would you please give me something and you're so desperate god give me something and then when god gives you an inspiration you're so excited you're like a little kid you know you can't wait to run it out but saturday i got up and the first thing i said was not oh thank you jesus you gave me something i said god i don't want to preach that because i know i know what it's like i know what kind of tension it puts people under i know what kind of questions will be asked i know what kind of pressure comes with that i know i'm not ignorant i know ahead of time i knew exactly some of the questions that would be asked and what i wanted to do was come along and say hey don't worry it's not as bad as you think everything's going to be all right but god wouldn't let me do that i told it the way he told me to tell it now i'm not saying every word i said is what god told me to say i didn't say that some of that was just by inspiration some of that was just brother chad according to the way god works with me but many of those things we hit i i preached if i didn't preach every word i preached it with the spirit and with the intent he told me to preach it so i came and i preached what he told me to preach and and that's what we want but sometimes what we want hurts worse than we expected it to hurt sometimes what we want requires more than we thought we would have to give do we understand that we want god to speak and when he does we start you know last week brother chad was right on but this week i just don't know [Music] we've got to be really careful really careful that we don't start to inject reasoning we've got to be super careful now last week i can tell you this now but i couldn't tell you then last week is not about the necklace it's not about the necklace it's really some of those things really aren't a big deal to me god forgive me if i'm wrong it's not about the necklace it's about preeminence it's about preeminence in his bride it wasn't about the garment it's about preeminence i wanted to tell you these things last week and i couldn't and i couldn't wait to come wednesday and tell you those things because i wanted to take the pressure off because i knew there was pressure and i wanted to relieve the pressure and guess what happened wednesday night we got a snowstorm and the timing on the forecast was the worst timing and the heaviest snowfall was the worst time it could fall and i waited as late into the day as i could to cancel service but i finally got to the point where i had to cancel it and then no snow there was no snowflakes and i said oh god help me i canceled my worst fear was a cancer service it won't snow one flag so i can't tell you how happy i was when it started dumping snow i was never so happy to see three inches of snow fall in my life but i realized something wednesday god didn't want me to take the pressure off yet because these things are good for us friends we've got to get to the place where we're going to be really honest with ourselves and ask hard questions and not go to some man to tell us this or that or this or that but ask god god this is what was said what what do you want me to do right now we've got to get to desperation we got to get to the lord we got to we you know what i'm not going to spell it out i have no desire to be a garment police i don't care i honestly i those things that you know if something's obviously wrong and causing a problem that's one thing but but don't ask me a bunch of questions because i'm going to do what brother branham did i'm going to go around the cowshed as many times as i can to not answer your question because if you look at asking questions is it all right to wear deodorant can a woman shave her legs can i dye hair can i be a hairdresser blah blah blah all these other things it's amazing how often he doesn't answer the question if you go i've read those questions and i've gone through and read i'm waiting for the answer waiting for the answer waiting for the answer and you get to then he goes to the next question like how can you go to the next question you didn't answer the question because brother branham didn't want to be your holy ghost [Applause] and he didn't want to take god's place and so i'm not here to answer all your questions i told you what he told me to tell you and i did it the way he told me to say it but don't ask me a bunch of questions from here on out because i'm going to do the best i can not to answer your questions unless there's something specific and i feel the lord to answer it i'm going to try to not get in between you and your husband that's never my intention that's never my goal and i'm too tired for that i don't need to answer all the questions and i don't need to call me you to call me every time you're getting ready to go somewhere or you're in the middle of kohl's and i don't know let's call brother chad please don't don't send me pictures is this okay i won't answer because i'm not that's not what god called me i i as a shepherd got a message from god and i delivered it and it put people under tension it put people under pressure and that's exactly what he wanted and he wanted it not to be lifted wednesday he wanted to go for a week because that pot had to cook just a little bit longer so that we can ask ourselves honest questions hard questions and be real we got to get real amen we can't keep going and we can't keep walking the way we've walked in the past assuming that it's okay to walk that way today please don't if if i had just don't look to yesterday and expect that that's okay for today now yesterday may have been okay and it might be okay for today i'm not saying yesterday was wrong but we've got to get to a place where god can lead his children by his desire by his purpose his way and that we can grow to what he wants amen we can be a perfect display of what he wants what i know for sure is god wants a clean holy bride he wants her sanctified separated from the world clean and holy that i know for sure and god wants us to not just accept what has always been he's trying to break us from that friends i don't know how many times he's led me to preach that but he's trying to break that what was is okay for now it may not be man as we grow up and mature your own children things that was fine one day is not fine the next day so we have to be able to grow up in christ and we have to take the leadership of the holy ghost individually in our lives and we have to be able to follow the spirit of god and we have to be honest with ourselves because so many times we're not really honest with ourselves and we don't really pray in an honest way sometimes we'll pray and we pray about something because we ought to pray about it but we've already determined in our mind what we want the answer to be man that sounds familiar doesn't it we've already gotten our mind what we would like the answer to be but we pray about it because we're supposed to pray about it and then we go do what we already wanted to do anyways and we said we prayed about it that's happened to me the reason i can share that so accurately is not because i'm in your brain right now i'm in mine you see we've got to be honest there's still too much self in our midst there's too much selfish desires there's too much wants there's too much pride there's too many ideas our own ideas it's god wants it gone and he's gonna take it by degrees one experience after another he's gonna wash it out and wash it out and wash it out because he wants total absolute control and we got to die and then die again and then die some more praise be to god god wants control he is absolutely guiding us to where he wants us to be but we've got to be tuned in to what he's doing it's too easy to get offended at what we hear preached instead of be honest with what we heard preach instead of honestly looking at ourselves sometimes the knee-jerk reaction is an offense and put up a wall and and sometimes i wonder why are we so offended and why are we so defensive if you know you're right and you know everything's okay where is the defense and where is the anger coming from because if you know for sure you're fine let the man talk i mean if you're absolutely confident that what you're doing is the will of god and you've got no conviction in your heart that it's wrong and no problem then it's okay just let the man talk and and just just be attentive and be kind and say god i hey if i'm wrong correct me but i still feel like this is what you want me to do lord that's okay that's how we want everybody to walk but when that resentment flares up and that anger comes up and we build a stone wall and sometimes i wonder are we really confident that what we're doing is right are we angry because the man mentioned it are we upset because he said it sometimes i think that's the case i wish you just wouldn't harp on that why why do you wish you wouldn't harp on that it's because it's a vice or a stronghold for some of us and and we're having a hard time giving it up and we would rather not hear it again than have to face it again some of these things we just got to strips ourselves down and face it and say god you've got to tell me the truth you've got to tell me what do you want from me right now praise be to god god's going to have a mighty army she's going to be invincible and what's he doing right now he's preparing her drilling her amen you go to boot camp and i've never been and i have no desire to go i heard about what went on there and i said that's not the path god has for me but they scream at you and get you to conform and all sudden it's make your bed it's not good enough tear it apart make it again polish the boots that's not going to posture again tear down that rifle blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and you can be i mean they they terrorize these men with all of this silly stuff march you're out of step march again mark we're going to go 10 miles now kill you get it right it's never about the straightness of the sheets do you understand the straightness of the sheets don't matter it's a disciplined army that matters it's being able to take commandment it's being able to follow orders because this guy who can't make his bed when he's told to make his bed is going to have a missile launcher and the capacity to kill dozens of people every time he pulls the trigger and if he can't follow these orders we're not giving him the missile if he doesn't go if he doesn't if he doesn't get it all right he doesn't get to fly the plane you don't want the bad recruit the one who never listened the one who never got it right and the one who was always daydreaming when they were giving out orders he's not the one in nuclear command that gets to flip the switch and push the button to launch the bomb because he might have been daydreaming when you gave the orders this bride has within her more power than we could ever imagine [Music] it's not a light thing this is a heavy thing and it's going to get heavier elisha had the power to call she bears and because of his office and because of the power of god gave him an authority he called the she-bears and they come and they killed 40 children 42 whatever it was and brother bennett said that wasn't the spirit of christ that was the spirit of elisha see god is given power but he wants it under control it's not about the sheets it's not about the boots it's not about the necklace are you understanding it's about preeminence now i'm not saying that what i said was wrong what i said was spot on right i'm not taking back anything i said it was the truth and it's what god told me to say all the other little questions you've got to ask the lord there's plenty of room there if you just ask the lord but what i'm saying and i'm not saying god doesn't care about what we wear he cares he wants a clean looking bride he cares about how we dress he cares about what we put her on he cares about adornment he cares about our hair he cares about our speech he cares about all of it so i'm not saying he doesn't care but i'm telling you the big deal isn't the necklace the big deal is preeminence can we obey the voice of the lord can we walk the way he wants us to walk can we be real can we be honest with ourselves and can we be honest before god and can we let god break us down and pull out of our hands something we wanted to hold on to are we willing to let him break it down and take away something that we we still wanted to hold he's going to have an army the most powerful army that has ever marched this earth she's here she's being prepared fighting a lot of battles this is a still a preparation phase everything we've been fighting is preparation all the trials and tribulation that god has allowed to come our way is still preparation because there's a great showdown coming there's a great final battle coming when two opposing forces are going to face off and god is going to have complete victory but he's going to do it through you and i as surrendered vessels are we able to obey are we able to ask the hard questions are we able to listen and then go home and say god you've got to tell me what you want help me to die lord show me exactly what you want you know what we don't want we don't want overreaction we don't want our reaction just to the desires of a human being to a man but god has chosen man to preach the gospel and we want to hear from god and go home and talk to god and say god break me down show me your word show me the truth and we got to let reasoning go out of our minds you have to understand the ministry gifts the gift is not the man we can understand this the gift is not the man the the fifo ministry is the ministry of jesus christ we understand that it's the ministry of christ in a man and the man can make mistakes it's not the man it's the ministry of christ in the man and god so molds the two together that he's going to use that gift with that man's temperament and personality because that's the way he wants to do it praise god it gets closer than we ever thought it gets to the point this gets really really real because we see the man we see the temperament but the gift inside is not the man the gift inside is the ministry of jesus christ it's one of the methods he's chose to speak to us in this day we've got to be careful that we're listening and we don't just take parts and leave parts and take parts and leave parts and if there's parts that we're sure are wrong that's fine if there's something can be said wrong that's possible it's possible every service for something to be said wrong see how see how close this is that's why we've got to be led by the spirit of god we have to have our own relationship with god we have to know that's of the lord because i have a witness in my heart and you have to say ouch that hurts but that's god or you have that little warning buzz that goes off and say that wasn't the message it got to have those things it's got to be individual we've got to know where we stand we've got to know what's god amen we've got to go know how god talks and we got to listen that way but understanding the flesh is flesh susceptible amen it's susceptible to all kinds of failure but the gift is jesus christ coming through a vessel so many times during the preaching that you see a minister pull out a gun i love this analogy you see him pull out a gun and he points it right at you i'm going to point down the middle because i don't want to point out take note i'm not pointing at brian and you see it line up to you and you see him squint his eyes and you see him pull the trigger and you hear the bang you say i can't believe that man just shot me you don't realize he's shooting the devil off your left shoulder it has nothing to do with you it's nothing under the anointing amen don't even see you it's not about people it's spirits a true gift under a true anointing is chasing down spirits and sometimes it comes so close to home that you say somebody told him i've been ratted on he's coming after me and he shouldn't use the pulpit that way but a true anointing and a true gift it has nothing to do with you as a person amen it's that spirit that's trying to influence you it's that wrong idea that's hanging over you amen and he's coming right after but it's so precisely accurate amen and it's it's it's discernment in the pulpit how many of you in the last couple years have experienced discernment in the pulpit to where you had to go ask somebody did you tell him what i said [Applause] that's the ministry of jesus christ that man can't do that but so many times when he steps on our toes or he talks about the thing we don't want him to talk about or we feel like it's too harsh or it looks like he's shooting my friend over there on the other side of the church then all of a sudden we flare up resistance comes amen and resentment comes now that doesn't mean everything that's ever happened in the pulpits correct doesn't mean things shouldn't be correct it can't be wrong please don't go one side or the other with me stay with me in the middle of this but sometimes the resentment comes because we don't understand what was just happening i sit at a vantage point that most of you don't get to sit at and and everybody not everybody but a lot of people have spiritual experiences they come and share with me and i get to talk to the ministers and i know sometimes the story here and i hear what's being said here and i know that man has no clue what's happening but it's a hard sell to convince you he doesn't know and we should expect more of that not less if the word's picking up if the ministry is picking up if revelation is picking up we should get more of that not less of that brother said the days of ananias and sapphira will come back i'm telling you they're here they are already here the ministry of the word is already calling things out already nailing it to the wall and people are getting offended because they think that man heard about me and is coming after me now that's happened in the past and that can happen in the future but i'm just saying be careful be really really careful because you may be fighting god and you may be resisting god god is trying to get his army ready he's trying to shave the world off of us he's trying to break us of our vices break us of of of of our habits break us of wrong ideas break us of tradition break us of complexes he's trying to break it all and sometimes it shapes pretty close but that's how accurate the word of god is it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart if we can't see that in the pulpit then i want another word because that's what the word's supposed to do and i'm telling you it's doing it your conversation what you talked about your question it's being answered here the things you talked about are being discussed here amen the problems that you've had they're coming out here is that true i've had people explain stuff to me that happened during the service and i've blushed they said this happened and this happened this person said this and you got in the pulpit and you said that and i blushed because i never would have said it had i known never in a million years would i have said that if i had actually known that was the case because i don't like that and i don't want to do that but i'll tell you something else that can happen that we got to be careful of when god is bringing us his word it's coming under the anointing and inspiration this is where god's checked me recently really corrected me hard i'll say things and other ministers will say things in a way i would never say it if i was sitting down talking to one person say it straight say it flat say it harsh even but then somebody will come to me afterwards or days later or monthly brother chad you said this and that and it and what do you really mean that oh no no it's okay and i start to soften things because that's my human nature that i don't want anybody to suffer and i don't want it to be too hard and i'll start to soften things and god has given a judgment and god has given a rebuke and i'm over here taking it away because that's my human nature and i say god forgive me god forgive me i don't ever want to do that again i want what god says to stand and i've got to have more confidence in what he's speaking through the gift than i've had in the past because hey it's tough for me because i'm the man and i know my faults and i know my failures and i know how many times i say something wrong and i know how many times i changed my mind on an issue they understand that's me brother chad but i also know that the gift works perfect and that's not me that's not brother chad and sometimes i have a hard time i have a hard time just letting it stand the way it was said my human nature if you come and ask me i'll start to soften everything say it's okay it's okay don't get upset i've got to be careful and if i got to be careful we all got to be careful god is good friends you know we had a special that was sung two two sundays back and it was beautiful and i enjoyed the special and i enjoyed the people are saying it and i enjoyed the way it was saying it was beautifully done it was done holy and it was done reverent but later we found out that it came from the contemporary christian music world and then my heart was smote you know because god told us not to go there and so i had an opportunity to talk to the individuals that were involved and we're all of the same understanding we all realize that that shouldn't have been done and then we won't do it in the future god hasn't changed his mind what he told us in august of 2017 when we did the music thing he means it that was not me that come from the lord and i have to stay true to what he did there and so we can't go back and pull from that contemporary stuff god doesn't want us to do it it's not for us other people may be able to but god's already spoken to us it's not for us but you know when you look at the tree of knowledge of good and evil and this is how god spoke to me on this issue god said it's good and evil and if god says it's good then it's actually good it's not kind of good or partially good if it's good if god said it's good it's good and if god said it's evil it's evil and so you can go to some of these things and you can find good and where did eve get deceived when when serpents spoke to her god had already spoke to adam adam had already spoke to eve not to eat not to partake of that tree but when the server began to question her she began to look at the tree with reasoning and it was pleasant to the eyes good for food and desirable to make one wise she couldn't find anything wrong with the tree the things she couldn't find anything wrong with the tree but god had already said don't partake of it and with reasoning she began to look we can pull a song out of that industry and we can look at it and it doesn't have a wrong beat it's not centrally done and it can look good but god said it's a mixed tree it's good and evil one bite may be good the next bite may be evil it could bring wrong spirits could bring wrong understanding so for us god said leave the tree alone and we have to trust what he told us and not use reasoning to try to reason it out just take what he said and if we just take what he says and trust him god will fulfill his promise god will keep us god will lead us god will bless us but we don't we don't need and this is everything brother branham told us everything he told us things to stay away from things to not partake in things like this and that brother venom said you shouldn't have a tv in your house he said if you had one he said if i had one i blow it out with a shotgun you better too we can look at that with reasoning and say well i don't have cable i only have these channels and don't inject any reasoning just listen there comes the time of god speaking to us and we want to go through and start the list of reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning reasoning has caused the initial fall and reasoning will cause every fall we don't want to reason with god we want to be led by the spirit of god amen everything the prophet said everything the word of god says everything that comes off the tree of knowledge of good and evil you can find good in it and be deceived by the good amen but there's evil on that tree too and it's a mixture and god doesn't want us going to the mixture to pull he's got a fountain of living water he's the tree of life there's no evil there's no death there's nothing mixed in with that tree and he wanted them to partake of the tree of life not the tree of good and evil and he wants the same thing for us he wants us to stay true to his word and he wants us to stray true to what he's told us and that's a hard thing for me to say because i was the one who said it my initial reaction to everything is yeah it's probably okay anybody who knows me knows that's my initial reaction it's not a big deal it's probably okay but then god comes along and says no it is a big deal and we have to be obedient to him i'll tell you i've had the last week has been a supernatural week for me there's been so many supernatural things happen but it's just shocking but what i'm realizing is this intensity is picking up and god has come along and corrected me and corrected other things twice this week and when he corrected it he corrected it perfect out of his word and when he brought the correction it was raw and it was true and nobody was hiding and i'm in prayer and all of a sudden it just drops like a lightning bolt and it's perfect all of a sudden it puts me under tension because i realize he's not letting us play on the playground anymore we're not allowed to be little kids anymore god is requiring that we act like full-grown mature members of his bride the days of being little kids and skipping around those days are over god is going to speak to us he's going to give us his word and he's going to expect us to keep it the days of being patted along and turning a blind eye or are reminding us 10 or 12 times those days are over friends i'm telling you right now those days are over god is expecting us to catch what's going on and he's expecting us to act like mature believers the intensity is increasing i've had a few experiences this week that has got me under so much tension so much tension god has come and spoke in a supernatural way to me three times in the last week since last saturday three times and each time it breaks me to nothing because i realize i have no idea what i'm doing and i'm gonna mess this whole thing up i'm just a person i'm just a human being i'm just a man and i make mistakes every single day and god comes down in such a supernatural way and he speaks something so exactly spot on that all of a sudden i begin to tremble because all i can do as a man is mess it up all i can do is ruin it and he's expecting amen he's expecting obedience and he's expecting a mature response and it's taking my breath away things are changing friends we're not little kids anymore it's not coming for a baby bride it's going to be all members here and everybody mature we're coming to a mature face let's go to hebrews chapter 12. hebrews 12 and 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your mind we have not resisted under blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with the sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement we're of all our partakers then are you bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the presence seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby wherefore lift up the hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel meet sold his birthright let's look at that scripture lest there be any fornicator profane person as esau he's talking about spiritually not profane or fornicator naturally spiritually who is esau for one morsel of me because esau valued his natural life more than his spiritual heritage he said what is the what does the inheritance mean to me what does the birthright mean to me if i'm dead brother it means everything that's your position your position is more important than your life your position is more important than your job your position in christ your birthright is more important than your family it's more important than your spouse esau wanted to save his life so he was willing to give up his birthright that made him profane and a fornicator we've got to be willing to give up everything natural to keep our birth right for you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears god intends for us to be children and he corrects us and he guides us because he knows what's coming next so many times you know we as an assembly have gone through so many things that god has just raked raked out of us he come and raked music out of us he come and talked about our marital relationships he come now and starts talking about the clothes and the dress and dormant and it's almost like you can't even get your footing before the next wave comes does anybody feel that way i hope i'm not the only one but but when things begin to change they're going to change so fast it'll take your breath away and everything god is doing is because he knows what comes next he wants us prepared and he's shaving the world away he's shaving wrong influences away he's shaving wrong spirits away he's getting his army prepared he's drilling us he's you make the bed again it's not right make it again what does it matter make it again there's a scuff on your boots polish them again what's he doing this isn't punishment friends this is preparation this isn't hard this is wonderful this is this is showing us where we're going if we look at where he's brought us from in the last few years it's showing us where we're going we're going to spiritual heights that we've never experienced before we're going into spiritual realms with manifestations of power that we've never seen before but he's not going he's not going to move us any higher spiritual power until he has control over us he said watchmen what of the night 1960 in the old days when they made gold the beater beat the gold and beat the dross out until he seen his own reflection then he knowed all the dross was out of the gold sometimes you say i preached too hard i've tear down people a man told me not long ago said you're going to ruin your ministry by rebuking things the way you do i said let somebody else do that i said who's doing it that's right who's going to do it i said it might hurt them a little bit now but they'll thank me when the time comes how can a man who preaches under the inspiration say anything but what the holy spirit says to him message presuming 1962 them uncircumcised egyptians they thought we'll just pass right through the sea like they did and they lost their lives aiken thought this little wedge it won't make any difference the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair i'll do the same thing it won't make any difference but what did it do it never brought pleasure to his family it brought death to every one of them and when we compromise on any commandment of god to please the people we kill the thing right there one little wedge one babylonian garment stop the marching army brother one thing that we permit the church to do that's wrong one thing that we don't call out against and make the people straighten it up it'll stop the march of the church they presume you're going on we may be in name we may be in numbers that ain't what counts that isn't what counts it's god with us god in us god moving through us through us his word alive in us that's what we want want to make sure we're not just going on without him but he make sure you know it because he'll come in and he'll strip something away amen and i don't think that any sheep has ever enjoyed the process of being sheared i watched it in new zealand it looked rough the sheep was upset about it manhandled moved around stripped sheared but you know what the little sheep felt good afterwards it was free all that was hanging on all that was catching sticks and twigs and all that extra weight it was free sometimes we'll come to a service and god will come right down our row right to our seat and just start unraveling things and we make a repentance and start to just give it to god and make it right and guess what you walk out weepy you walk out broken-hearted but you feel clean there's some freedom that comes and god is trying to free us from the things of the world he doesn't want the influences of the world influencing us you know one of the one of the main things that that the one of the main things god impressed on my heart and i wanted to get across last time is so many times things that moved to church are worldly influences that have come into the church and got passed amongst us we've got to be super vigilant friends we've got to keep the world out just because it comes from you see somebody clean and godly doing that doesn't mean it's okay to do we can't always get our cues for right and wrong from the person sitting next to us we've got to be led by the spirit of god we have to know and i would say as we move forward from the things we talked about that sunday as you move forward personally make sure you move forward in faith knowing that whatever you do is exactly right don't guess don't assume don't reason i'm warning you don't guess don't assume and don't reason but if you move forward move forward by faith knowing that god has spoken to me that i'm right i know that this is okay just know it friends just be certain just be absolutely certain for too long we've presumed too long we've presumed things are okay too long we assumed it was okay too many times we reasoned and justified things in our mind because they're doing it or that church does it or this brother sister does it or that family allows it we got to stop doing that we got to come back to god having preeminence in us and it doesn't matter if you're the only one who feels like you can't do that if god told you not to do it don't you do it you may look around and everybody else can do that but if god told you not to do it then you better not do it and it doesn't even matter if it's right or wrong scripturally if he told you not to do it you better not do it amen paul said all things are lawful but all things do not edify there are some things and there's seasons there's times there's influence there's reasons sometimes you'll never know the reason but if god tells you not to do something then you better not do it don't reason it away because somebody showed you a quote or somebody else did it or everybody else is doing it if god told you not to do it don't do it god has got to have this army trained there may come a time you don't have anybody else around you to lean on and look to for guidance but some things are going to happen decisions are going to have to be made and it's going to come so fast you have to know how to hear from god and you have to know what is god and what isn't god that's what he's preparing us for now so when he says get out of the house you get out of the house we told brother branham keep walking he kept walking his reasoning was saying but i'll miss my plane but god said walk god wants his bride like that [Music] that will obey him regard it goes against thinking it goes against reason it goes against everything else i understood but he's the one who's leading me and i'm going to do it because he said do it if he says walk i'm going to walk if he said don't go into that building don't go into that building if he says don't get in that car don't get in that car we've got to get to obedience we got to get to the leadership of the holy ghost it's got to be preeminence praise god i've watched for years and been caught up in myself in things that come from the world and sweep through a body of believers brother branham said you watch somebody wear a hat especially if it's the pastor's wife and everybody else got to get that hat somebody said something like that i'm not recording it right why he says it's matching time he said i want my experience to match god's word we don't want to be influenced on those things so many things fashion trends come through and you see it and it's all sudden just like we're childish we're childish because that's not the way a mature believer should be we've had things sweep through a fashion thing or a fad and it's like why does every fat or fads in the world have any effect on us here there should be a separation where it doesn't matter what the world's doing i want to do what he told me to do and i'm not copying the fat in the world and i'm not bringing and spreading it through the church i mean we've all seen the vitamins come through and everybody was going to be cured of everything with these vitamins and better yet you're going to be rich because you're going to sell them too that was immaturity remember juice there was a special juice that could cure cancer we can all laugh because almost every one of us drunk something cookware and crystalware and bags and we start using our influence to influence people and what we want them to be influenced by and not influence them in the word we're using our influence to sell a product to our brother and sister when we should be gathering to provoke one another into love and good works see those were childish days but those days have got to stop we're too easily influenced one person doesn't next person does it next and not everything's evil not everything's bad but it's like why why do we all have to copy each other why do we all now why is it i'm feeling left out if i'm not taking those pills those vitamins why is it i feel like the odd one if i'm not drinking the juice see what i'm saying we've all got cotton isn't there nobody exempt i got the stuff in my house right that's not what god wants he wants preeminence he wants us to follow him and him only and follow the word and if we influence one another let's provoke one another into love and good works let's talk about the word let's promote the word not a product let's promote the word let's get together encourage one another man i would love testimonies to sweep as fast as some fads i would love spiritual experiences to sweep through the assembly as fast as some of these fads have but that was in maturity friends god's calling us above those things we don't want to copy each other we don't have to influence each other we just need to stay true to what god we shouldn't feel the social pressure to go along with something we shouldn't feel social pressure to all we're all doing the same thing but it's not the word and it come from the world and nobody's doing those things now they didn't change our lives they didn't last they didn't build us up spiritually we didn't grow spiritually all of these things he's those were fine then but he's calling for something else now if we're going to lend our influence to one another let's influence one another in the things of the word and the things of god if we're going to promote something that's promote the word let's build each other up in the word let's not let a trend come through or or whatever trend it is let the world trend let's not trend they can trend in fashion they can trend in products they can trend in apps but let's not trend let's not follow the pied piper let's not do like everybody else does let's not be like everybody else is but let's stay true to what god what does god want me to do what does he want me to spend my money on what does he want me to spend my time on god is looking for preeminence he's growing us up and he wants us to be grown-ups we got to be careful that we got to be just we got to be vigilant in whatever we do god wants us to do you know i know saying these things are hard things to say i'm guilty of it we're all guilty of it but but what does god want what is he looking for what kind of maturity does he want what kind of influence should we have on one another say god grow me up mature me in your way i want to be more than what i was in the past i want to be a mature believer wisdom versus faith brother ben said and i used to box and there was a fellow named here in the city the poor fellow drinks very bad now one of his boys is one of the police force smith george smith they call him six second smith he went to training training me for boxing for before the golden glove started we was out here at the government and that why he was the roughest person i ever seen he just hit me and i just go winding through the air and i come back i said you don't have to be so rough about it see i said you knocked the breath out of me he said i tell you billy said no matter how well trained you are and how much athletic experience you have and how strong you are for your size or anything like that said a lick stops the blood when it hits that and he said you might hate me now but when you get there in the ring yourself said you're gonna appreciate it said your body builds up that to come back quick and if you get hit and just fall over and you lay there and take a count but if your body is built and can stand the licks and then when you hit hit it hard lick hard lick hits you said then when you come back quick said back to your feet again get knocked out of the ring jump back in he had just got through knocking me plumb out of the ring he said you have to just do that see and he liked to kill me he was about 30 40 pounds heavier than i was and he could he was a fighter and i was just a student so he was almost killing me he said but you'll appreciate that when you get in the ring i found out that was the truth then i've heard these sergeants in the army train them boys rugged they'd hate them sergeants but when it come to combat they'd love him because of rugged training they'd hate him but then they loved him that's the way i try to train christians don't bob off your hair don't wear makeup don't do this get it rugged you'll appreciate me when i come to the end of the road training see getting that training right but let's keep right with the word it might be rugged cut denominational differences to pieces but you'll appreciate it when you come down to the end of the road you stood by the book it may seem rough but we'll appreciate it it may strip us down it may lay us bare it may expose us but we'll appreciate it when we can hear from god and when everybody goes one way but god leads me somewhere else and i realize this was the path of safety i'll appreciate it then when everybody's got one idea but there's a warning in my heart going off and i don't ignore it this time because of what everybody else is doing but i listen to the warning in my heart and it leads me down the right path i'll be thankful then when god can strip me of a group thing and get me to the individual leadership that he wants to have amen if it takes taking a little hide off amen it's going to be a good thing friends this individual walk with christ is going to be the only thing that's going to make it to the end amen we may not have the privileges we have now we might find ourselves separated or isolated we're going to need to learn how to hear from god we're going to have to know what he wants us to do psalms 144 1 says a psalm of david blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight god is teaching us how to fight how to fight the influence of the world how to fight wrong spirits how to expose traps that are right among us god's teaching us friends everything i'm talking about everything that i'm explaining to you god is teaching us something there's deep spiritual principles here and i know it's the truth it may hurt today it may have hurt sunday but these things are going to matter a great deal sometime in the future let's turn to exodus 13. exodus 13 and 17. and it came to pass when pharaoh had led the people let the people go that god led them not through the way to the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest perventor the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt god was bringing a bunch of slaves out of egypt and god had to train them to be an army god knew that when they crossed over the promised land into the promised land they were going to have to fight for every footstep and they have to fight for every inch of the way so god in his good training as a good trainer he didn't lead them the short path straight up through the land of philistines right up through the gaza strip and right in to palestine but he took a detour and took them around because he had some things he had to teach them first they had to learn to be dependent on him they had to learn to walk by faith they had to learn to obey his word there were some things they had to learn and what was he doing he was building an army he had him in boot camp first thing he did is is they come out rejoicing and they come out they've got gold and silver and they've got all these things that they spoiled out of the egyptians and they come out rejoicing amen playing the tambourines and dancing and happy they were free now but god didn't lead him straight to a land and but he knew there was fighting there so he took his time to train them and he took him down by the red sea and he got him stuck in a trap where there was zero possibility for them to get out pharaoh's army is coming down cliff walls on one side c on the other the only way of escape was now chariots bearing down on them because god had a way through the sea that they couldn't see and god is trying to train them not to use their natural eyesight not to use reasoning not to depend on their ability but to have confidence in him and he told that prophet what to say and they opened the red sea and they went across on dry ground and he closed it over and destroyed the enemy god wanted them to learn how to be an invincible army and the first lesson he learned is there's always a way and it's not according to your reasoning it's not according to your eyesight it's not according to your history your past your training he's got he's trying to strip them of all of that because he's building a new army he's building a new invincible army that's going to learn to follow after that prophet no matter where it leads you follow that pillar of fire if it leads you to a dead end then he's got a way through the dead end if it leads you to the red sea he's got a path through the sea amen but he's got to tease him follow the pillar of fire stay with the word and don't use any of your human faculties because none of your human understanding none of your training none of your past your eyesight will never give you the ability to see what god's getting ready to do they crossed the red sea they rejoiced and they danced as god a mighty deliverer but did they learn the lesson a few days later they come to bitter water he leads them to water and they begin to murmur and complain to moses there's bitter water we're all gonna die he just led you through the red sea and now you think you're gonna die oh can you see god training in your life do you see how he's been training his bride god turns the bitter water sweet and they drink they rejoice again then they run out of vittles they begin to murmur and complain and always when they murmur and complain they're always wanting to go back to carnal things back to carnality back to egypt egypt's the world he's leading them to the promised land every time we run into an obstacle the first thing we want to do is go back to the worldly ways i got to get a credit card i need a loan i got to work more hours every obstacle we face oh we got to get to the hospital i'm not against hospitals i'm not against working extra hours please don't praise god you know me better than that but god wants to show us that there's a way where there seems no way he wants to show us he's the one that can turn bitter water sweet and he's got bread that you don't know of he's got a source you never learned about in your books he's got a bakery they didn't tell you about in egypt see what god's doing through the exodus journey he's trying to build an army and he gets that army trained and he fights battles for them and and they they they fight and they win and all of these things but when they come to kadesh barnea they couldn't stop their carnal ways and all they could see was walled cities giants impenetrable fortresses and people that they couldn't defeat and they had forgot about the red sea and the bitter waters of maura and the manna from heaven and the quail what happens to us nothing different god's trying to show us he's trying to show us another way he's trying to show us his provision his way he's trying to teach us how to take the word and fight how to take the sword of the word how to put the armament on the helmet of salvation amen now no longer no doubt can enter in because i know i'm saved he told me i'm saved i'm saved by faith in the word i've got the helmet of salvation now doubts can't enter in what's he teaching spiritual warfare the breastplate of righteousness i can't be hurt because i have his righteousness the shield of faith amen was given me by grace will quench all the fiery darts and then feet shod with the preparation of the gospel amen with a sword in my hand which is the sword of the spirit which is the word of god he's trying to get us to rely on the armament trying to get us to fight the way he fights trying to get us to fight like the invincible army but we've got to leave the things of egypt behind we're not going to do it like the world does it we're not going to overcome the way the world overcomes amen he's trying we're not going to fight like egypt fights we're going to fight the way god wants us to fight we know that army amen they rejected at katy's barnea and god wiped them off [Music] and through a wilderness journey he began to train up a new crop and this new crop learned all the lessons water from a rock man is still falling those who oppose the word of god who swallowed up they're still learning all of these things but when you get this army now to the promised land it's not like that first army it's different now because they weren't raised up in egypt they were raised up in the training camp and now when they come when joshua says when joshua says prepare vittles for three days we're going over they prepare when joshua says don't cross till you see the art cross land drive they do it when he gets on the other side and he says circumcise all of you they don't question him they just do it and joshua's the type of the holy ghost different kind of army begins fighting amen when you go to jericho you're not gonna fight like other armies fight you're gonna walk around in a circle on seventh day seventh time and you're gonna shout see god was trying to train them in another way and we know that army failed they eventually went into failure army after army after army start good finish do god's work and then relax raise up another king raise up another army amen defeat the enemy amen do through the judges do it through the kings on and on and on but there's coming a final army there's coming a final battle there's coming a final victory amen and you and i are being trained right now to fight that battle this is an army in preparation and when he says when he says cook this out of your house and kick that out of your house amen it's an army in preparation when he says don't watch the world don't love the world or the things of the world don't let the worldly influences into the church don't pass it from one to the other he's trying to prepare us for what's coming next this isn't about being picky friends this isn't about amen just somebody's idea i'm telling you this is god's preparation for us for what comes next when god got a hold of gideon he was going to teach gideon to fight a different way gideon gathered what anybody would do in the reasonable mind god comes and tells you you're going to be the deliverer you're going to be mighty you're going to have a deliverance he does what anybody else does he gathers as many troops as he can gather and god says that's too many what they had was already way a minority to the army that was coming against them they were already going to have to kill five to one ten to one to win the battle but god doesn't want us to use reasoning so many times we start to wonder about things is this permissible or is that permissible when we start reasoning we start looking around well they do it and they do it he's trying to break us of that friends why don't we go to a prayer closet why don't we spend some time with the lord and say lord show me in your word what do you want from me right now what's your idea for me right now he's trying to teach us a different way friends gideon send them away he lost a big chunk of his army still too many take him down here and the ones that lap water like a dog those are the ones that i'm going to deliver with gideon had never seen that done before he had never read that in the bible but he heard the voice of god and he knew it was gone and when god said do it he did it got the ones that lap sent everybody else away he's left with 300 men was he crazy no he was the most perfectly sane one among them because he was being directed by the spirit of god and with those 300 in a very in a very unconventional way he delivered israel confounded the enemy and scattered them we don't have to do things the way we've always done them we don't have to rely on our reasoning and our understanding god's trying to get us to go another way the question is do we have enough courage and enough security in christ to go that way it takes a lot of security it takes a you have to know that you're a child of god and you have to know that you can hear from god it requires a lot to walk that way it's not an easy way because you can't use carnal resources let's go to john chapter 8. john chapter 8 verse 28 then said jesus unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father has not left me alone for i do always those things that please him so jesus did nothing of himself he was able to get rid of self and only did what that he was taught by the father and only those things that please him he tells us that he was showed of the father what to do in the pergamian church age from the church age book in the section and pick up your pen and write it says notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19. this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise no one not their family members not their friends this is the army he's looking for no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he would now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time whose works is it the bride's nope it's his it's his work that he didn't finish that he's gonna finish now and they know they can't do it how many of you can raise your hand say i can't do it beyond a shot of a doubt i know that i cannot do it i have no ability i have no wisdom i can not do what he's calling for us to do in this hour and that's the first lesson he wants you to learn because he doesn't want you to do it all he wants you to do is surrender to what he wants to do he's looking for a vessel he's not looking for your brain he's not looking for your might he's not looking for your ability he is simply looking for your surrendered vessel that he can have absolute total control over and when he gets absolute total control he will display himself through that vessel but we first got to get to the place where i don't know anything i don't know what to do i don't know how to do it and i'm completely incapable of doing anything he says in christ is the mystery of god revealed where once partly moses had him partly david had him oh my but here he is manifest in the fullness deity himself standing on earth god in his fullness to die for the sins of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life then he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last day what he's looking for he's he gave his life to bring a sanctification to the church by the blood of jesus christ so that he could live in the church so that he could do the work but he's not wanting to share the throne with you he wants self-will to leave the throne and he wants to take it i've said this statement many times i'm going to say it again the question what's wrong with it is the wrong question we should be asking what does he want me to do now because if we ask the question what's wrong with it we're wanting somebody to show us whether it's right or wrong so we can make our own decision whether we want to do it or not instead of asking him what he wants us to do now we need to be careful one thing i've realized in the things that have happened to me in the last week is the difference between right and wrong is a hare's breath it's not as far as way as what you think friends it's a hair's breath between right and wrong and it's going to take a greater sensitivity to the spirit than what we have now but that's what he's trying to do we don't have to be afraid he's doing it we just got to surrender to what he's doing he's building it he can't do it without you god put himself in partnership with man if you're the elect seed of god predestined to be in this final hour he can't do it without you that's wonderful he can't do without you that's hard because if he can't do without you that means you're never going to miss out on it it's going to happen he can't do without you means he's going to strip all of you out of you so he does it and here you are grateful on one hand that i'm his and that he's never going to leave me behind and suffering on the other hand because he's raking it down and raking it down and raking it down to where it's just him with his preeminence only and we're standing here on one service i want to run the aisles the next service i want to crawl under my seat well that service is god that one's not come on praise god this is for all of us he wants a greater preeminence than he's ever had and it's going to take less of self than we've ever been able to manifest but praise god he knows how to get it and i'm thankful for that let's go to luke chapter 2. luke chapter 2 and verse 48 and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wist ye not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man oh i love this verse more and more all the time because when we look at jesus's life when it came time for jesus to be born upon the earth there was mighty manifestations of the spirit that was taking place there was angel visitations to zacharias an angel visitation to mary amen there was a prophecy given through anna there was a prophecy given to simeon there was all of these supernatural things happening then she carried the child and delivered the child and then supernaturally the whole world was moved to a taxation to get jesus in the right spot at the right time amen and then there was an angel choir and a message given to shepherds and then the shepherds were running through the village telling what was told creating a stir then shortly after that there was there was a magi a wise man that visited jerusalem and spread the news to jerusalem and there was joseph with dreams and there was mary with visitations all of this was happening right as jesus come on the scene in your bible and then after that everything goes quiet and this scripture is the only glimpse of what we got in the in between time from when he was just a small child to when he was 30 years old and it shows us that he was about his father's business but he was in training he was in training scripture says verse 51 and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them that was part of his training that was where god placed them and he stayed there but his mother kept these things in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man he was in training if i just put it through that way he was in training all of the supernatural when he come onto the earth and shortly after and then all these years of growing up and maturing and growing in stature and wisdom until finally at 30 years old he burst on the scene with a short ministry that rocked the world that shook the religious system that shook the political system in that area but in between he was growing increasing when this bride came on the scene there was a prophet there was supernatural 1962 end time sign c brother benham said there's been five planets aligned what is it it's he said there's three plan there was three stars that day to announce this birth when he came the first time now there's five planets what's it doing announcing a newborn baby bride is coming on the earth there was a messenger to announce that there was all kinds of supernatural that was happening the world was catching all kinds of signs and all kinds of wonders and all kinds of things then it goes quiet for 50 some years it goes quiet it's not that nothing's happening he's growing in the word he knows the word he's disputing with him in the temple he's increasing he's growing amen and i believe there was things happening around him is my personal this is brother chad because when he comes to the wedding in cana amen mary knows he can turn the water to wine how did mary know that she had lived with him all of those years i believe there was things that happened around jesus but it wasn't a public ministry there was things that was happening but all of a sudden when it was time it was like flipping a switch and when the switch flipped it went from private to public and now everybody was seeing it my question to you is could that repeat in the bride could that same thing repeat in the bride and if it does where are we he's preparing us he's been preparing us but we should be learning more and maturity and more maturity and mormon he should be getting more preeminence and more preeminence and more preeminence till he's getting a bride that will just speak by his commandment and just move by his leadership brother ma'am says in the message in absolute 63 now you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us holds a part of god do you believe that that's a big statement i mean bigger than i think we could realize and we must come together and then the pillar of fire is manifest in the wholeness and the fullness of it when his church sets together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings the pillar of fire back again hallelujah that wasn't a one-man ministry that's not just a group of a few really gifted people that's not what he's talking about he's talking about bringing the pillar of fire back again when each one of us is holding a part of god each one of us it doesn't matter if you're a child or a teenager it doesn't matter your age or station or status if you are a part of god you were always a part of god and you're holding within you now a part of god and none of it is inferior to the next and none of one not one's more necessary than the other every one of them is critical to where we're at he said each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again you can't leave you out of it i can't leave you out of it you can't leave me out of it but we all have to surrender to it brother bram says i'm just going to read a few quotes to you i'm just going to go through a list of them so don't get bored don't fall asleep i'm going to read a list of quotes to you laodicean church age out of the church age book remember we have shown clearly all through the ages that even as adam and eve fell because they left the word so the ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the world church systems this laodicean age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus further in the same later scene church age the wheat and the tares which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested what not not what nice set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of organization the false church turns from any vestige of truth and with political might reinforces herself with state backing hear what brother branham's saying reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered into the garner christ is the mystery of god revealed identified oh the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word and her alone they don't have the answer when jesus come why didn't those pharisees see he said this pharisee he said if i cast out devils by the finger of god who do you cast him out by see he stood alone and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelled in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up you guess that these great organizations set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the vindicated word promised to her spoken word is the original seed i believe someday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies of it in revelation 13 6 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this pergamian church age on the church book he says the same thing only it's in the church age book i believe according to revelation 13 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot 1963 look away to jesus so now i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is the thing that we have looked forward to so for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has now been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is now remember there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be see it cannot be now it's in existence and i'm warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could be identified its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes then the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifest in the fullness of its power christ is the mystery guard revealed but their folly will be made manifest he's talking about janus and jamborees their fallacy their folly will be made manifest when jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and says this is her and the way he goes with her that's right and their folly will be made known christ is the mystery god revealed now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected can you now no denomination but revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation god is not known by the nomination he's known by revelation look god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride christ in his body who's his body the bride and as god took from the body of adam the woman and she fell then god is took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by the nomination or creed no serve but she is coming back with pure unadulterated word of god being manifested i hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that see she is the second eve but she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she shall stay with this word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical moves you want to and all the affiliations and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that brother ben is preaching in christ is the mystery of god revealed this is not an obscure message from what this is christ crisis the mystery of god revealed the church age book looking away to jesus 1963 spoken word is the original seed they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and church is like this who is not the nomination they'll use them for a storehouse anything and if any man goes out and offers prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the ecumenical movement will be shot on the spot now we can cut that out of the message you want and throw it away or we can read it as part of christ as the mystery of god reveal it's already the lutheran minister minister the head of it said so and it's right here you can read it right in your magazine i'd like to have that magazine right don't make any difference what they say that church will stand true to this light she's already proved it back yonder and shall do it again in the face of everything it's the word of god and the the all ecumenical movements and everything else will be gone she's going to be there without spot or wrinkle that's right she'll stand there but the memo said they already proved it back then they already they already took amen they already took peter and john and they threw they they threw them in prison and threatened them amen and the angel lord come and told them what to do and they did it they threw some of them in prison and the angel opened the doors and let him out of prison and said go back and preach back in the temple the same temple you were preaching in when they arrested you now go back and preach in the same temple and they went to get them out for questioning and they said they're not there then somebody else runs in and says hey those people you arrested they're down there preaching in the temple look at the control that god wanted to have over his bride not when these doors open you run as fast as you can and go find a safe place to hide they were under such control that the very place they were arrested and their lives were threatened amen when the doors opened he said go back to the same place then go through the same kind of punishment and the same kind of persecution and they went right back to the same spot peter and john stood before him in the council amen and they said we we they threatened them amen and they tried to scare them and they said don't preach in that name anymore and peter just said peter didn't say yes sir i'll be a good boy if you just let me go didn't say i want to go see my wife you realize that's a bible story but sometimes we don't get the gravity of the bible story leaving it as a bible story peter had a wife his wife was crying he was in prison we've got to realize i don't know if peter had children or not but we know he had a wife he's in prison his wife is crying amen now he's offered a chance to get out they're just going to threaten him and tell him not to do it again and if he'll just be a good boy amen and he'll just go along with what they're saying he can get out what man could face that kind of temptation and his answer was you tell me is it better to obey man or better obey god [Music] you see there was a certain kind of control there was a certain kind of preeminence and they fell from that but that's the same thing he's bringing us back to that kind of preeminence that kind of control when he says you go there and they're going to throw rocks at you you go there and let them throw rocks at you [Applause] that's his army he's the chief captain he knows what's right he knows what's best amen and they were so willing to follow exactly what he said the apostle paul he was told that he would stand before caesar all along the way he's told you know we prophesied here when you go you'll be bound in jerusalem agabus comes down and ties his his own hands and his girdle and tells him the man who owns his girdle the same shall be done to him and they try to convince him not to go and he says why do you break my heart with your weeping it wasn't like it was easy friends it wasn't like there was no emotion involved it wasn't as though going to prison was a nice experience for peter and a nice experience for paul and silas it wasn't as though when they sang songs they were doing so in the most joyous time of their life they had been beaten they were hurting they were in pain but they lifted up their voice because they were under god's control they knew who they were they knew who was in charge amen and they knew they were right in the line of duty and instead of feeling sorry for themselves they were going to worship god almighty [Applause] paul says why does that make me weep i'm ready not to just be bound but give my life you know what he did he went straight to jerusalem you see we are always trying to bypass trouble we're human beings we're prone to failure we're to have weaknesses we have loved ones we love one another we love our wives we love our children but so did paul and and paul didn't have a wife of gentlemen paul loved the people that were around him he loved the people in the church peter had a family i don't know about the rest of the disciples but they were all willing to give up everything to follow the commandment of the lord their love for him and their obedience for him superseded the relationship with the wife superseded their love for the brethren that's what he wants friends i'm so sure of it i'm so confident i know that's exactly what he's trying to get out of us i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that is what he wants from our lives and you think the preaching's intense now it's going to get more and more pointed and more direct until self is gone and he's got preeminence because that's what the prophet said he was going to have that's the second fold purpose of the threefold purpose is preeminence and if he's got to shave us down and shave us down and shave us down he will shave us down till there's nothing of self left but he has the preeminence until he says go back to that same place where they forbid you to go and if they say brother branham said christ the mystery of god if you offer a prayer they'll shoot they can shoot you on the spot and if god says go off for prayer you go off for prayer and if there's a gunman standing there with a gun you offer prayer these aren't fairy tales this is what the prophet has said this is what was in the book of acts and if they if they put forth another branch they'll write another amen i don't know what things will look like i don't know what's happening all i know is what prophet said i don't know exactly what it would look like i don't know what the time frame would be like i don't know i don't know anything except what he said and i know for for that to manifest in me he's going to have to have greater preeminence i know for that to manifest in me and for me to go through that time i'm going to have to die some more there's going to have to be less chad lam and more of him because i'm still afraid and i still have human affection that takes precedence over things there's still some things in me that have to be shaved down i know i need some more shaving to come to this message absolute 1963. now you see we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity i read this before i start all that i'm reading it again because each one of us is holding a part of god and we must come together and the pillar of fire is manifested in the wholeness and the fullness of it when his church sits together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again i'll tell you in the last couple of weeks like i said i sit at a vantage point that is unique because when somebody has a spiritual experience oftentimes they'll give me a call and i get to hear and it's been that way you know since i became a pastor but things are changing friends there's people in this assembly having spiritual experiences across the board and they're picking up in intensity dreams are increasing and if you're a dreamer you can probably say dreams are increasing tongues are increasing people's prayer time is increasing things are changing amongst our brothers and sisters and i'm sitting in a point that i get to hear it supernaturally we had a brother led by a dream to go and fulfill that dream and it happened exactly like it was told things are happening friends things are happening all around us let's dial into it brother benham said there's a great symphony going on and he said you've got to get in the spirit of the symphony to catch the changing of the beat he said it's beating right along but you've got to be looking at the sheet music he called it the word the composers wrote it you've got to get in the spirit of the composer the conductor is leading which is the holy ghost is leading us along you've got to get into the spirit of it you're going to miss the transitions you've got to get into the song you've got to get into what god is doing we've got to give ourselves over to what god is doing so we don't miss the transition that you you see it the bits building the beats changing it's getting ready to shift into something else amen and if you're reading the music and following the conductor you can sense it's coming i don't know about you but i know it i know it in my spirit like i've never known anything else things are building it's getting ready to transition again and god is bringing spiritual gifts out of the body like i've never seen before in this concentration in this fast and spiritual experiences that are happening that fast get in the rhythm friends get in the rhythm don't get offended by the preaching don't get your toes stepped on and draw back get in the rhythm of what's being said get into the harmony with the word get in the rhythm with the way the spirit of god is moving get in and catch the transition brother bannon said in 1961 they ever present water from the rock and the little power that will raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the resurrection you believe that it's already laying there your body change is already laying in your if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it i'm not making this up send the message you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god on you you got power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you will make you would speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now now i'm waiting for great power to come you've got power now it's in you now that's what the power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatsoever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place the souls of your foot can set upon by by faith god gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what i mean the power is controlled by if you are a son of god you are a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there all that power is there the power of the resurrection is there the power of the body change is there the power to speak another world into existence and go live on it is already inside of you if you've got a shadow of the power of god if you've got an expressed attribute if you've got a peace of god inside of you that power is there but it's controlled by a law it will only operate what you believe that's why when you believe for healing you get healed when you believe for your deliverance you get delivered why the power is already there what's god trying to do strip away carnality he's trying to get all of egypt out of his friends all denominational ideas our carnal approaches all worldliness all influence of the entertainments of the world and fans of the world and he's trying to get all that away from us because everything's already in us and the word's already been given to us but what he wants to do is he that that army when you go into the army and you go into boot camp they've got to get you from a from a 18 year old civilian into a soldier that they can let you drive a 20 million dollar tank with the power to destroy villages power without character is satanic god wants that power under complete control i'll say it this way the bride of jesus christ is so powerful that when it begins to manifest it's going to be shocking and i say that by revelation when it begins to manifest it's going to be shocking how much power is in the words of this little humble nobody bride but that kind of power has to be under absolute control jesus christ said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me why was that possible because he only did that what the father showed him he only did what the father taught him and he only did that which pleased the father and he said all power in heaven and earth is given to me this power will get you through the red sea this power will create squirrels where there is no squirrels this power can produce enough bread and fishes to feed 5 000 men besides women and children this power is enough to pluck you from one location without you walking or flying and have you show up in another location hundreds of miles away this power is enough to get you to walk on top of the water this power is enough to direct you to a coin in a fish's mouth if you need to pay taxes you understand friends there's nothing for the bride to be worried about this is the same power that told joseph it's not safe here take the child to egypt and it's the same power to tell him it's safe now go back it's not what we work up to it's what we surrender to it's what we give ourselves over to he wants preeminence he doesn't want our mind clouded with things that aren't the world not the word he doesn't want us all twisted inside by the world he wants us free to hear his voice to follow his leading he wants us consecrated and separated from the things of the world he wants a bride separated he wants a bride that stands alone upon the word he wants a bride that's completely given over to him and that's what he's doing now and that's what he's going to keep doing and he's going to bring us to that place where what you've seen temporarily will be manifest in the fullness of its power we all want to see those days every one of us but to get to that place you gotta learn to do some push-ups tuck your sheets in straight polish your boots eat chow in 30 seconds peel potatoes whatever else we all want to get to that place but to get to that place he's got to train us to that place we've got to learn to trust him for our manner we've got to learn to trust him for our water we've got to learn to trust him in times of illness we got to learn to trust him in times of financial calamity god is building us to that position right now but we've got to be aware of what's quit fussing quit resisting quit pushing against god said god if that's what you want from me i'm here if you want to strip me of every pleasure of the world strip me my pleasures are coming in the future my joy is coming ahead but i tell you once you make that surrender you'll find your every joy is in him non things of the world not in earthly pleasures but the real joy you find in quiet times with him when you speak to him and he speaks back to you that's the real joy i tell you we had a family devotion monday night and i had preached sunday what the lord told me to preach and i woke up monday in tears because i i don't like doing that it's such a strain i woke up depressed and i woke up in tears and under such agony of spirit don't forget to say things like that you pay a price spirits don't like it when they're exposed by the message i expose spirits and i go in the hotel and fight them all night now i woke up monday morning under such an oppression i was in tears got up went to prayer through my day it's a tough day but i knew i did what he wanted me to do i had no regrets for that we come to our we had we had a good day god blessed us and some encouraging things happened along the way and a few of you sent encouraging texts and encouraging messages and it meant the world to me you have no idea but we went to our family devotions and for family devotions i was teaching my children about azusa street the reality of azusa street and the reality of azusa street was that it was so humble so quiet but so powerful and we started talking about that and i said god wanted that level of manifestation and power under control to come into the message to go into the wheat but it failed but what god wants is all of that plus the opening of the word to be the full expression of the word in this day so i just talked to my kids and we haven't normally have a devotion and normally at the end of devotion i pray and usually it's god thank you for our day thank you for this and that if we had any prayer requests we pray over them pray for our next day it's usually just a few minutes and everybody goes to bed it's not it's not any big deal but this monday when i began to pray the presence of god come down so strong i began to weep like a baby and weep and weep and weep god pressed me down under the spirit and pressed my head down between my knees till my face was almost to the floor sitting in my chair and i began to just pour out my heart and i begin to weep before god and i begin to repent for everything we've ever done in our house i begin to repeat for saying things that aren't nice to each other repent for saying things that were cruel saying things that are unfeeling i already begin to repent for being foolish i'm getting into repent i began to clean out and wept and wept and i was an absolute mess nose was running tears were drowning this has never happened in our family devotion ever before and then the spirit would lift up a little bit and then come right back down and push me literally push my face between my knees and i began to pray and i don't even know what all i said i was just praying my whole heart knowing that this is the hour and this is what i pray god this is the hour this is the moment this is when you want full expression and these are the bodies you wanted in that revelation friends wasn't lifting me up that revelation was breaking me down and putting my face in the ground because it's going to be done in utter humility if god is going to show himself powerful if what you've seen temporarily be manifest in the fullness of his power it'll be done through utter humility and simplicity so no man will get any glory we prayed like that for some time i don't know how long it went and the spirit lifted and i was a wreck my kids had never seen me this way this has never happened in our family devotion before and i knew one thing god was pleased with what i did on sunday i knew that i was obedient i was obedient to him i looked at my kids and i said i just looked at them tears all over my face i'm using a kleenex to clean myself up i won't do any more describing than that but i looked at him and i said the only thing i could say was things are not always going to be like they are now i looked at my children and i know what that means and i said things are not going to remain the way they are now but things are going to change and i said it's going to require a greater consecration from us than ever we've given and at the end of that experience that's all i could say things are not going to stay the same things are going to change and it's going to require a greater consecration we've played in the playground too long we've skipped along and we skipped along too long friends we've been too whimsical we've been too absent-minded but not anymore things are changing i don't even know what that means i'm not going to give you a time frame i have no idea we could be here another 100 years i'm not trying to put anything like that i'm not trying to scare you i'm just telling you what god's saying i'm telling you what's happening things are transitioning and they're not always going to stay the way they are now we're not always going to be able to be so flippant and so free it's not going to stay that way we're not always going to be able to to have such freedom and such frivolity we're not always going to be able to have that it's not going to stay the same as it is now it's going to change but it's going to require the greatest consecration that we've ever given and i for one want god i just want i want that consecration in my life i want to yield to him i want to be washed out i want to be a vessel he can use i want to be a part of what he's doing on one hand it's exciting on the other hand it's terrifying it's exciting to be a part of it it's terrifying to know what kind of life you have to live to manifest that and what it's going to take to get there is going to be an utter stripping down where the goldsmith beats and beats and beats and beats until all the dross is out and he can see his reflection i know things have to change in me i know i have to step up i know i have to go to higher places i know it but i know it's for me to do and i know he's calling us to it friends things aren't going to stay the way they are now the praise of god nothing's going to happen without you and i he's not going to leave us behind he's not going to leave us out but he's going to bring us in he's going to use us i've had on my heart for a long time i've been in a season of prayer god has got me in a season of prayer that's all i can say where i'm praying now more than i ever have and it's by his leadership because i've never been good at praying i don't know it sounds bad i don't mean it to be bad but i've never been one to pray for hour after hour or pray an hour every day i've never been that way but now it's easy for me to pray an hour god has just changed something inside of me and i know that we need to be more prayerful and i know some experiences that i've had in this last week happened during prayer and they were supernatural and so i've decided to open the sanctuary on fridays from one to five from 1 pm to 5 p.m the sanctuary will be open and a lot of fridays i come in here and pray anyways and it'll be open for anybody who has a desire if god's moving on your heart come and pray from one to five you can come anytime in that time and you can leave any time we're not gonna you don't have to stay here the whole time but if you feel a pool to come come and pray and pray at the altar you can pray at a seat you can pray anywhere you want but let's come and pray if god's moving you to pray so friday from 1 to 5 and saturday from 5 p.m to 10 p.m it's the same thing it's an open house come when you want go when you're done there's no obligation we're not going to be talking to one another we're not going to be having a service all we're going to do is pray and there may be one person there maybe 10 people i don't know but if god's moving on your heart i think this is a time to be more sensitive to be more prayerful than we've ever been before another thing i'd like to mention is i would like i'd like to see us in here quietly praying before the first song i like as a body of believers for us to all get tuned in to what's going to happen every service not walk in last minute what i'd like to see is i'd like to see service start 30 minutes before the first song meaning we just come and part of our service is consecration in prayer and preparation to hear from god preparation to worship i'll just say like this can you imagine if all of us spent 30 minutes in earnest heartfelt consecrated prayer what do you think the first song would be like you could just imagine it would be easy it would just take off but i think we need more not less now i understand you have children got babies not everybody can do that and it's not for everybody to do i'll just put it that way if you don't have a burden then it's not for you to do but if i say it and something in you says yes then it's for you it's not an obligation it's not nobody's going to force anything it's not that you have to but it's something stirring inside of me that i believe this is what we need more of if we could come together and pray come together and spend that 30 minutes of quiet prayer reaching out to god praying at the altar praying at our seats meditating on the lord preparing our hearts for the worship service and preparing our hearts for the word i got a feeling the dynamics are going to change and we're going to be more tuned in and more sensitive to what's happening so i'm just saying that i'm just throwing that out there for everybody no force no obligation and if you don't feel anything your heart towards it then don't come in it's only if you feel there's something right about that and something that i want to participate in i tell you things are going to change don't know when this may be a preparation that takes 10 years to unfold but whatever god's calling for now is what i want to be a part of it's something stirring and i want to be stirred something's moving and i want to be moved i want to be in the symphony i want to be in the rhythm i want to be wherever he's working is where i want to be this is what god's laid on my heart and this is the opportunities that we have for whosoever will and who has a desire i've asked sister naomi to come and sing a song sister naomi if you would come sing the song she sang last sunday the musicians can come to who will close out as soon as they're done musicians can come and brother jim you can make your way up you guys would but when sister naomi when i heard this song it hit my heart exactly what she's saying is exactly what god's been dealing with me in my heart and this song is very prophetic i can just say it that way this song is very prophetic and god is using different voices and different gifts to tell us the same thing and i don't want to blow by it but i want to pay attention to what he's telling us through all the different gifts because it matters so we ask her to sing this i think we asked him to put the words on there so we could see the words but this song remember is coming from my heart this song is prophetic amen god bless you too long have we been still [Music] feasting not acting hearing the warnings seeing the changes yet never possessing our land this man must change us to save us the showdown is near the storm and is can you hear the sound the music has changed the light is moving awaken and

neither should they things should start changing i want to give myself completely to it i want to surrender everything don't even know what to do next all i know to do is just lay down my life you can't push anything we can't push ourselves to anything we can't pull anything down we can't make anything happen but all we can do is just surrender to say god i believe that's true a teenage girl called an inspiration is the exact same thing god speaking to my heart can we hear him can you get the message do we know what he's telling us do we know what this means let's lay our lives down afresh let's sing the song i surrender all sing this song if you'd like to pray you're welcome to pray let's just surrender everything to him this is the hour for full surrender sing the song together

control that's what all of this is about [Music] he's wanting to know will you give yourself all to me and the bride is saying i gladly give myself to you i want to give myself i want to give more sometimes i don't know how to give more but i want to give more is that the spirit you're in now you want to just give more just empty out right now just pour it out he'll take it he'll fix whatever's broken if you say god there's something plugging up my channel i want to connect to you i want to give you all but i feel a wall say god tear the wall down now i want to come to you if you leap with
