eating you know i had a good meal yesterday but i'm hungry again amen and so god really was good to us yesterday and really fed us on the manna from heaven but you know i'm just a little bit greedy spiritually i'd like a little more manna from heaven amen today and i don't think our father minds us wanting more amen i think he likes it you know he'll give us a good meal it's like mama when she cooks a good meal everybody says thank you mama that was a good meal but she doesn't mind when you come back for more the next meal amen praise the lord are you ready for the word hey amen i'm always ready for the word amen i come from the word i'm part of the word i love to feed on the word amen my husband is the word amen amen the bridegroom is the revealed word of the hour what else can we say but we love the word amen and we know like brother mark is saying the word is a person it's not letters in a book it's a person amen the letters in a book are to represent the person to give us an idea of the person to bring us into a meeting with the living word amen the person of the word and so we want to just worship him as we receive him this morning amen we appreciate brother stephen shimbo coming brother stephen and i are new friends amen brother marcus and i are old friends brother stephen and i are new friends brother steve and i just got acquainted over the last two or three years and we met face to face for the first time this summer and so we really enjoyed him enjoyed his ministry enjoyed the fellowship we're really thankful that he could come and be part of this service with us so we have you know old and new but we have friends amen and we thank god for friends because our fellowship is around the revealed word of the hour our friendship is based on our love of christ and so whether it's new or whether it's old the friendship started in the mind of god so it's an eternal friendship amen it's a brotherhood so we appreciate that i also just wanted to make mention that brother marcus last night was telling us he fears nothing he fears no demons he fears no devil he only fears the dentist so i say brother marcus you better run and hide because brother shimbo's a dentist amen [Applause] he's a dentist by occupation so brother now the dentist is preaching to you you better be very afraid this morning my brother god has a sense of humor brother and now you're on the front row so if he takes out his drill you're in trouble brother amen oh we love god amen we love his word we love the fellowship around the word amen we just like to invite brother shimbo and we want him to take his liberty take his time we have no strict agenda amen brother shimbo's as a gift as a teacher and god really is anointed in that way and we want to take time i told brother frank around back i said i made a joke i said don't ever ask a teacher to share everything with you because you'll be here for a week amen to say you know just give us a portion so we're guilty of the same thing ourselves so we know how it is but praise god we're glad to have our brother glad to have the fellowship glad that you're here and let's just you know turn our hearts and our attention towards the lord and receive his word if we could invite him with only believe we could just sing only believe and one brother shambo [Music] [Music] all things are possible foreign lord i

lord jesus christ and this is not a new church for me this is home amen your church plays in my house almost every day i usually don't have time to watch it but my wife watches back and forth back and forth and before you know it she looked at me like this is scary i say why is it scary he said you keep preaching the same thing you ain't brought the child amen and i'm like we we have not even talked for a while she said but how come everything he's saying this is exactly what you're saying over there amen so brother child has been a true true brother to me a very good friend and i wonder a lot i say how come i've been in this country for a long time and never knew you and one of my uh our deacon home usually say he said god hit you both and when he came down and we had a wonderful fellowship together i told sister angie i said sister angie we need to go ahead probably and have a dna test you might be seated a little bit i say we need to go have a dna test because something is wrong everything i'm saying is right there amen oh my just to corner the serpent seed we know brother branham spoke about the serpent seed and there was an event that happened in our time to confirm or vindicate the serpent seed you know what happened right there is a woman that got pregnant and she had two children one was an african-american and another one was a caucasian that was to vindicate the serpent seed teaching but if you go in the book of revelation chapter five when the seal when the lamb came and pick up the book and broke the seal the bible say out of every kindred tongue and language that's a different breed right there a man out of every country god have his children just like brother marcus explained yesterday that when god came throughout the ages he began to kind of propose his children left and right so i was born back home in africa he was born here but we have the same father amen not to vindicate the serpent seed but to vindicate our origin that we all come from god and we're going back again to god amen blessed be the name of the lord so we really really enjoy the fellowship here thank brother chad from the bottom from of my heart god richly bless you and sister angie and the church we really really really really enjoy the fellowship god richly bless you amen so i'm gonna take my liberty i'm a home usually the way i preach at home i take them to a trip so some of you has been in the airplane already amen so we're going to get into a trip so the the reason why i usually take the analogy of an airplane it means we're going to leave the earth we're going to forget about our bills forget about our home forget about our laundries and everything so let's go a little bit and soar in the heavenly places amen and i can tell you straight ahead who's the captain of this trip it is not me it's the captain of our salvation so his name is the lord jesus christ amen amen and the first officer is brother chadland i am the second officer in other words a relief pilot so that when the first officer is sitting enjoying so we're there right beside the great captain just to work together so if you have any problem we got flight attendant the deacon back there they should be able to help you up and then so keep your seat belt buckling pretty good and we will be leaving the airport sooner amen so welcome on board on llama bcf airport the captain jesus christ is on board and sooner we're going to leave the airport amen you know when you come into this kind of meeting convention you wonder what to preach and i asked brother chad i just want to make sure you stay within the theme that the local pastor wants you to to be in and i asked him i said brother child what is the theme of the meeting and he told me he said our theme has always been the turtle so when you say the third pull to me you just put a fish and put him in the water and then he says the third po it's the opening of the word so you're gonna hear me traveling different avenues so just know i'm in the third pool amen ready for the word blessed be the name of the lord we'll be all right just keep your seat belt and we're gonna go up amen let's go to exodus chapter 25 i was studying a lot of stuff that i thought i'm going to be preaching here but this one keep coming back up again over and over amen it's a new subject that i thought i'm going to preach the church later on by the holy spirit quicken it recently so i tried to use a different avenue and it's like an explosion it kept coming up coming up coming up i told brother robert i say i don't know what to do it's like when the smoke are in a sanctuary the minister can minister no more everywhere you see it's just smoke i'm still looking at the same subject over and over amen so i felt like this is what the lord wants me to speak so you relax and everything will be all right amen i know brother chad pretty good now recently we ministered a little bit uh we were talking a little bit and i took the lever and i moved it to two because we were talking about the zodiac so we went in the constellation and he took the lever and he moved it to five do you know what he means so i'd say okay he's pretty good with five i took the lever and i moved it to seven and he took it all the way to nine i say okay that's pretty nice i'll pull it to 12 and here he goes to 50 and i say that's it that's good enough so that's a man that i can talk to him plainly in a message because this message is so sacred and it's so deep and i don't even think we're gonna leave this world finishing what is in this message what is sealed down to the bible is completely beyond human imagination amen you can spend an hour talk about the word over and over and over because it's so rich amen exodus chapter 25 verse 1. if you're there you can say amen okay that's pretty good and the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the children of israel that they bring me an offering of any of every man that give it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering you might be seated and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine lining and goat hair everything here is a problem and rem skin dyed red and badger skin and shadow mood oil for the light spices for anointing all and for sweet answers onyx stone and stone to be set in the effort and in the breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them so god wanted to dwell in the midst of his children amen verse 9 how do you make this sanctuary according to all that i show you so moses had a vision after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instrument thereof even so shall you make it so moses saw something in heaven moses saw a temple in heaven moses saw a tabernacle in heaven and god after giving him the movie when he finished god say everything that you saw there i want you to get down here and make sure you reproduce everything on the earth anybody clear so far keep your seat belt we're going to leave soon amen let's go to chapter 26 now job first to verse 40. i got a tendency home to turn around and look at the glad and i forgot that it's right here verse 40 of exodus 25 and look that you make them after their pattern which will show you in the mount everybody clear let's go to chapter 26 verse 30 now if you dare you can hire a man verse 30 and you shall hear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was showed you in the mouth god insisted that moses make sure what you duplicate here on earth is exactly matching heaven so if you've never been in heaven you need to contact moses and when you get in contact with moses moses can show you the pattern of things that are in heaven even though you are not in heaven yet but you can have a test of heaven through the ministry of moses amen let's go to acts chapter 7 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord acts chapter 7 verse 44 if you're there you can say amen few people i'm home verse 44 our father had a tabernacle of weakness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking to moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen repeat it again stay with the pattern make sure everything that you do is exactly what was demonstrated to you in heaven amen let's go to revelation chapter 15 then we will pray hallelujah so right here you can understand that there is a tabernacle earthly speaking and there is a tabernacle in heaven so as we move along we will be flipping our camera up and down up and down up and down amen revelation chapter 15 verse 1 and i saw another son in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seventh last plague for in them is fill up the wrath of god and i saw as he wear a sea of glass mingled with fire why and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god and they sing the song of moses there is three kind of category in the book of revelation in revelation 5 there is a category that are singing in revelation 15 there is 14 there is another category that are singing the 144 thousand fifteen there is a third category that are singing amen and the song the song of moses why moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb why do you mix moses with the lamb saying great and marvelous are your works lord god almighty just and true are your ways you king of saints who shall not fear you o lord and glorify your name for you only are holy for all nations shall come and worship before you for your judgment are made manifest and after that i look and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in so there was another temple in heaven amen the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened anybody clear so far so there is two tabernacles here one in heaven one on the earth god told moses take what you saw there duplicate it put it here on earth why let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us lord i have done what any man that you give an ability to do can do it's just to open the word of the scripture father we can read it but when it comes to interpret and unfold your word it's only a working of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you be the one speaking this morning and blessing your children be the alpha and the omega of this service father we seal the devil completely out and we commit all unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen blessed be the name of the lord we had a wonderful service last night and i found out that brother marcus speak french so the next time he'll be around we'll sit down and talk in french more amen what are you preaching this morning my subject this morning is the mystery of the sea of glass this sea of gas is also called in the scripture delivered pastor told me the third pull so let's relax and keep your back of seat as we're taking off amen why are you preaching about are you tattling this sermon a mystery why mysteries hallelujah brother branham says this that the bible is written in mysteries amen jesus thanked the father for it see that he was wrote in mysteries and in a stature of the perfect man brother branham say but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by revelation of god the whole word is wrote in mysteries and only the knowledge of god can reveal it and when you get and say punctuate every word of god with an amen then add that to your faith so the whole scripture right here the whole bible was written in mysteries anybody clear so far brother branham continued he said but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear not the teaching of a man not the teaching of a bishop not the teaching of a scholar but the teaching of the holy spirit because man of old spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost amen brother branham said how do we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know amen brother branham continues he say gods wrote it in riddles and parables so that he could hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it to babes such as would learn so god had to do it this way to hide that from the serpentine because not everybody can be saved even though christ died for everyone but not everybody will be saved amen when boaz was doing the work of redemption he was redeeming naomi but in his backpack man he knew that he was after roof even though it looks like he was redeeming naomi but in his back part man he was actually aiming to a bride and that bride was roof everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham continued he said jesus thank the father for doing it doing what hiding selling the word amen is that right because you don't know it's like reading a newspaper it is a spiritual revelation and it's revealed to them who are interested in learning it everybody cares so far now we found out here that brother branham said god hide it from the wise and the prudent and he liked to do that let's continue again in the revelation series brother branham say so you watch as these things unfold themselves he run right back around and open up the book so now this actually gives the picture of the entire bible and the seal that is got the bible heed from the eyes of the wise and the protest brother branham just said that god hide it from the wise and the prudent now brother branham give us more information he said the way god hides it he hides it by sealing it so the seal actually hides the mysteries of god hallelujah he said he's there and the seals that he's got the bible hid from the eyes of the wise and the prudent god by the holy spirit is opening them up like this and revealing them right around through the bible glory to god so now we understand that the full bible is written in mysteries god did it purposely and how did he hide it he hide it through the seals so in other words to understand the bible clearly their seals got to be broken hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother branham said the lamb was breaking this hills and god still was not going to reveal it you say brother stephen people has been preaching this bible for all along so you telling me they didn't have revelation because the holy spirit worked with paul he worked with luther he worked with columba he worked with many preachers throughout the ages so if you say the bible was sealed so nobody understood anything that's not what we're saying brother branham saying the lamb was breaking the seals and god still was not going to reveal it he was left for the last days now we had samples and we have probated and done very good sometime not all the time only sometime so did god use the other people throughout the ages yes sir but they did not have the perfect interpretation of the scripture until the seals are broken here so far brother branham said they've done very good sometime but we know it's moving right on but now in the last days we can look back and see where it has been and that is supposed to be done that at the end of the church ages just before the rapture he continues again he say we have prohibited through the years and according to the scripture there was no way to understand it until this day because it has been hidden we have seen the symbols what he was symbolized by it could not be correctly revealed until the last day was luther inspired by god yes sir was westlake inspired by god yes sir did the pentecostal have the revelation yes sir but still the book was still still it required a prophetic ministry in order to unfold what was written in the scripture everybody cares so far brother branham said could not be correctly revealed until the last day now then we must be there at the end time everybody cares so far why did branham continue he said now remember no man in heaven no man in the earth pope bishop cardinal state presbyter and whoever he is can break them seal and reveal the book but the lamb not even brother branham brother branham have to wait for the lamb to open the scripture and we have probe and presume and stumbled and wandered and that is the reason we are in such a confusion because things were let loose until the end time but random says first corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away so are these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongue and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication [Applause] because paul said i preach important iranians preaching part columba preached important martin preaching part luther preaching part but at the end time the light of the sun shall be like the light of the moon but the light of the moon shall be like a light of seven days he takes the day of power he takes the day of arenas he takes the day of columba it takes the day of luther it takes the day of wesley and he bring it all together into a constellation [Applause] no one the brother branham said when he entered the constellation all the six centuries were familiar because they were already being used throughout the ages he can recognize that but there was one that was peculiar that was the seventh year amen blessed be the name of the lord he said then that which is part is done away when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things amen the mystery was in the seventh hill now we understand it when these seventh seal was open that opened up the entire bible the seventh year he was sealed with seven mysteries and in them seven still had the entire mystery of it the bible is written in mysteries those mysteries were sealed under the seventh seal and only the breaking of the sevens here can unfold all those mystery clearly in our generation [Applause] hallelujah the seventh seal of the hidden mysteries of the entire bible will be open and fulfill revelation 10 that in the seventh angel's message this thing should come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled before our eyes this day is this scripture fulfilled so we understand now that the bible was written a mystery and those mysteries were broken up were unfolded so if they are folded is that for our intellectual knowledge brother branham said as daniel heard the seven thunder and forbidden and john heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of these seals to be opened the mystery of god will be finished in other words god will be known to his church not in three persons but as one person the mystery of god will be revealed and when that was completely revealed then the seventh mystery will be opened to the church because in there the church will be living under an inspiration of the holy spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive among us living among us and we are then worshipping the living christ that is among us so the sales open christ i'm there the mighty god before us blessed be the name of the lord amen so if the seal hide the book somebody must break that seal and we know it's only the lamb but the lamb is up there and someone must be here that can match that office everybody because if we don't have the opening of the seals there is no way we can make it to the rapture anybody here there was two banquets in esther everybody in the first banquet hammond was happy haman was enjoying the wine as much as the king was enjoying the wine a heaven was sitting without any fear and matter of fact when he left he was so happy until he bragged about three things he brag about the glory of his riches the lust of the eyes he brag about the multitude of his children and we know we receive children by flesh the last of the flesh and he brag about the promotion that the king put unto him the pride of life amen but in between esther chapter 5 and esther chapter 7 where we have the second banquet we see esther chapter 6 there and six is the number of a man and in esther chapter 6 something happened the king stayed in the palace and somebody took the king's chariot the king horses the king rob the king crown and put it on mordechai and have to walk mordecai all around throughout the city so if you've never seen the king before you just watch mordecai mordecai unfold the hidden king to you until if your vision is not too clear you might mistake mordechai for the king because he was wearing the king's robe he was having the king's crown he was riding on the king's ward he was a son of man revealing this son of man that was sitting in the palace so he takes the revelation of the son of man to bring you into the second banquet and in the evening time then the second banquet open up that's when airmen become powerless hallelujah so to break the silence of a king you need an office who's going to break that a pastor a teacher an evangelist an apostle brother the bible say in amos chapter 3 verse 7 surely the lord god do sometime okay somebody's not sleeping but here the lord god do nothing except but he reveal his secret unto his servant the prophet so the one who can break the silence of god is only a prophetic office [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and the word comes only to the prophet the word prophet means a revealer of the divine written word the same as he does a foreteller see or a seer and the seer how the one you know is telling forth he's divinely vindicated by foreseeing it comes to pass in other words when a prophet speak and that happened you need to listen to him how many time he did he spoke and it happened what further evidence do you want amen brother branham said the holy ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of christ he just spoke he said the prophet does it now he say the holy ghost does it is he contradicting himself the holy ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of christ there is no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated how godly or anything there is no man can do it the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of christ and has been in all ages remember all ages you need a prophet anointed by the holy ghost that's why you have something like this a vindicated prophet with the pillar of fire a son of man revealing the son of man amen so we can say that we're not feeding in the word of man but we are feeding upon the unfailing body word of the son of man brother branham said it was the end time period that the seventh thunder of jesus christ came forth revelation 10 3 4 and cried with a loud voice and when as it was when the line wrote and when he cried seven standards ordered their voices i'm gonna go to the red what was in those standards no one knows but we need to know who can break the silence of god only a prophet and he will take a prophet to get the revelation because god has no other way he can do nothing of bringing out his scriptural revelation except by a prophet the word always come by a prophet and always will and we thank god for a prophet in this end time that can break the seals for us amen the very day when this message not when he started on but when he begin to declare his message the first pool we know it's healing the second pool is prophesying by the third pool the opening of the word the mysteries revealed so when i say the mystery of the sea of glass i am not preaching a new mystery i'm only preaching reveal the mystery ever here so no more there is no higher order to reveal the word than the prophet but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seal to reveal the hidden truth that has been sealed in the world amen blessed be the name of the lord the bible said my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge the first eve fell because the seal was the book was sealed the second he fell because the book was here but this eve will never fail again because we're not looking into a close book but we're looking into an open book hallelujah because that has rejected knowledge i will also reject you that there shall be no priest to me remember you reject knowledge you can be a priest seeing that i have forgetted the law of that god i will also forget that children in daniel chapter 12 the bible say he said go that way daniel for the word i close up and seal until the end time the end time of the end at the time of the end many shall be purified purify by what the mysteries of god when they are truly unfolded to you you cannot live an unclean life because mysteries has been blamed in this message to be responsible for people and clean living someone who truly receives a knowledge a correct knowledge a perfect interpretation by the scripture by the holy ghost of the mystery can no more be the same person hallelujah many shall be purified and made white and even try the judgment amen but the wicked will do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the why shall understand hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so we understand now that the scripture is blocked hidden by the mysteries and only the prophet can unfold the mysteries so what is a mystery verb he said the mystery and mystery is scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed we understand that by a prophet now but which is a supernatural element still remain despite the revelation because if the devil takes the book of the seal and read it he's going to understand the seal he will understand it but he didn't really get the revelation amen anybody that went to school can pick up a spoken word book and read it and fill the intellectual knowledge but that is not the revelation because a mystery even though it's open there is still a supernatural element that locks the mystery despite the revelation that's why john was told by the angel after revelation 10 7 go yourself to the angel and god take the book don't go and beg the angel because that book doesn't belong to the angel when it was sealed it belongs to god but when it's revealed it doesn't belong to god anymore it belongs to me and it belongs to my family so when you see me and god don't give god the book you need to bring it to me it doesn't belong to god anymore john never went there and said please can i get the book he said can i have the book there and just say he doesn't understand you yet they told you go take the book they didn't say go back the angel you must have a contact with the angel and the book and when he get there he said give me the book then just say you don't understand in heaven you didn't have any right to touch the book we are no longer in heaven this is the earth you come and take it yourself exercise your god-given right go and grab the book it belongs to you and don't even keep it swallowed so god will never receive it back anymore [Applause] in adam the book was in his hand god could take the book back but today the book is not in a hand the book is imagined and it's god want to take the book god is obligated to take me too because me and the book we are one blessed be the name of the lord we already left the airport so keep your seat belt the airplane is still this way hallelujah brother branham say may i just pass this to you when the supernatural comes in that is the mind of christ so you need a contact with the angel if not you will never understand this message you can understand that humanistically speaking and you can get in trouble with it brother branham says this he says now when god is silent we had better be silent but when he had spoken we had better speak to god spoke i'm not going to keep my mouth quiet anybody here when israel was given the commission to go around jericho for six days nobody was supposed to speak because the power of the spoken word was closed everybody must be quiet they didn't want anybody to say we look like stupid here just going around this way god help block that up can you imagine look they're making fun of us they say we hold you really with a long skirt and look at the way we're going quiet until the seventh day and in the seventh day you go around the city seventh time then nobody was supposed to remain silent anymore you must open up your mouth and speak loud so the enemy can hear you and the speech brought the wall of jericho down hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord but when we have spoke better he has spoken we have better speak to and say what he has already said that's what confession me he taught us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the holy spirit what we will have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was a me sad teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit was not inside you will not hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard that every moment of the day you need a supernatural element to unfold it even though it's unfolded there is a supernatural key despite the revelation that was the son of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word receive it and live by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as corner man so if you see somebody struggling in a message probably they have not heard it yet they heard but they have not heard it let them hear who have their ear hear what the spirit said not this one it's a different earring everybody here those who did not have the spirit heard it only as conor man put a wrong interpretation on it and went in sin so if somebody got a mystery and singing clearly it's a wrong interpretation the inside teacher is not there they have not contacted the supernatural element yet that is connected to the mystery everybody cares so far blessed be the name of the lord so what is going on with this mystery of the sea of glass what's going on what is the sea of glass this liver what's going on with it amen god we just spoke that he hide himself in mysteries these mysteries that god had himself have many forms god hide himself in images everybody these images are called symbols god hide himself in words or in history yes here when you read the bible you're going to read about the story of abraham it is not truly a story you can read about joseph it is not really a story because you will see when joseph was picked by his brother and they took his coat off they put him into a pit and they took the court and sent it back to his father that is not a story god was speaking something behind the story because he was portraying somebody who when he comes he will be taken by his brother and his spirit will be taken off and sent back to the father god had his mysteries in numbers or he hides it in measurement everybody clear god had his mysteries in punctuation when jesus went to the temple he took the book of isaiah he never wrote the entire he never read the entire verse he read it until the middle where there was a camera and stopped reading that karma means a change of dispensation [Applause] it is not a common camera it is a scriptural camera [Applause] [Music] hallelujah god hide his mysteries in genealogy so when you're reading the bible you see an image there is something there abraham walking there is something there enoch work with god what kind of work was that why was he walking with god and god took him do you think he was just walking like this god hide his mysteries in form in symbols in word in stories in punctuation in numbers number one number two number three all these friends have a language hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so when god hides his stories in the uh his mysteries into this kind of formula we are dealing tonight uh this morning with the the bro the lever or the sea of glass let's see exactly what is going on with this sea glass when god hides his mysteries not only are the mysteries hidden but there is something that is called the theme of the mysteries just relax the airplane is still like this sooner i'm going to be like this and i'll tell you to take the seat belt off anybody clear so far how about here so far because god told moses he said go and reproduce everything that you saw in heaven reproduce everything on this earth so when moses came moses began to work on the tabernacle and when we finish we see this blessed be the name of the lord when we look we say moses good morning good morning how are you doing i'm doing fine how did you sleep i slept well so you told us you spoke to god and you had a movie of heaven yes how was the tabernacle in heaven moses said this is it oh yeah there is a brazen altar there is a lever we can see the showbread we can see the table of the showbread we see the arc of the covenant what is going on what does it mean to us what is the meaning behind all of this the first chord the second chord all of this what is going on brother branham says this he say he is the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and you don't see christ in every verse of it let me repeat it again if you don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again so when i read abraham it's crashed [Applause] when i'm reading jacob each quest when i read six measures of barley each quest when i read delight on each christ if everything in the scripture is christ why was not christ represented in one image why did christ want to express himself as an ark why did christ wanted to express himself as a level why did christ want to express himself as the table of the show bread why he was not only the table of the showbread that could be easy but he has to be the table of the showbread he has to be the veil he has to be the lever he has to be the brazen author he has to be the mercy seat he has to be the carryman he has to be abraham he has to be joseph he have to be jacob he have to be ezekiel why why not one thing so when you read joseph you read christ when you read abraham you read christ when you read jeremiah you read christ he was cry that's why brother branham said jeremiah was crossed joseph was crossed abraham was crushed moses was crushed but when jesus christ came everything that was in those prophets were gathered together into one person because he was the fullness of the godhead badly they had the spirit in person [Music] but branham continued he said if you can see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you have missed something the bible is crust he is the word he said he is the principal team of the bible he was in the prophet he was in the psalms he was in the history of the bible so when you're reading number you are reading christ when you're reading a story in the bible you're reading christ when you're reading a psalm you read in christ but work on the christ hallelujah because the christ is moses is different than the christ in noah yet it's the same quest it is a different manifestation or expression of christ so when you are in the time of noah and if you want to preach christ you better preach it like noah [Applause] any sermon different than noah will kill the people you preach christ according to the revelation of his mystery you're preaching crust crust as a lever means something crust as the show bread means something crust has the ark means something crossed as the tabernacle means something it's a different manifestation yet the same spirit manifesting itself in different ways expressing different attributes of this ending hallelujah he was in a prophet he was in a psalm he was in the history of the bible the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of song it's a book of love and there you find christ how can you handle this how can you handle something like this you can preach this for 30 years amen he said he was wasn't a prophet he was in a psalm he was in the history and he also in the bible is the thing that is to come he was before and until after what does he make him then the same yesterday today and forever [Music] blessed be the name of the lord brother branham continued he said he is the thing he was the prophet he was in them he was the psalm he was in the history he is the thing to come the same yesterday today and forever then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of her thinking of her singing of her work he should be the principal theme of her life if he is the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in our hearts then he should be the principal thing of everything that we do all things should be crushed that's why i told the folks back home and say i'm gonna preach this message until you smell like the message until you speak like the message until you think like the message until you talk like the message until you walk like the message and still you brief like the message until you jump like the message until you become the messenger the living epistle of god made manifest [Applause] living book walking in two feet amen brother branham said all the plan of redemption all the names all the symbols all the worship of the tabernacle all the wood my god all everything in the tabernacle everything spoke off class your answer is easy what does the lever speak of we can close the book and go home but work on the crust why is the show bread different than the liver anybody care but brandon said go god was back there in those hebrew prophets and so forth speaking and speaking to tom to the to that time of perfection that when jesus will come to perfect the believer jump down he said now all these feasts all the feasts the holidays all the tabernacles all the wood everything in the tabernacle everything tap crust all the offering my god all the laws everything was in top of christ so when you read your bible from now on it's a different story he said how the hazard the cedar wood and all mixing together how the wood in the tabernacle how the brazen altar deliver the showbread everything pointed to christ and he and in him we are complete in jesus christ we're going to get there now you can unbuckle all the furniture in the building top crust such as the level where the sacrifice was washed the brazen altar where he was slain and burned and the brass even in the altar speaks of judgment so there is a code there you need to be decoded to decode it you need a prophet anybody clear so far so now everything in this tabernacle speaks of christ but we're not talking about the brazen altar crust we're not talking about the the golden altar crust we're not talking about the ark of the covenant car crust but we are talking about the lever crust what is the crust behind the level what is the theme of christ behind the level what is the voice behind the lever what is the message behind the lever because the lever is talking when you see it it's telling you something it's not just a piece of furniture it has a message of god because it's reflecting crust the ark is talking it is not just a piece of art it is reflecting crust the show bread is talking it is not just bread it is talking of christ what is christ talking in the show brain what is he talking in a level what is he talking in a veil what is he talking on the second veil blessed be the name of the lord so we're dealing with delivery but uh the bible says this in exodus chapter 30. the bible said that shall also make a level of brass why breath why not gold why not silver because god told israel pick up the gold pick up the silver pick up the grass why was this specifically brass he said make a lever of brass and his foot also of brass to wash without so brother stephen you're telling me that the lever here of brass was just to wash wash what a beast take a bath wash our clothes wash our cars what are we washing what is the message behind this he said and that shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar and that shall put water there in so it's not just a little pool but that pool must be of brass and you don't put juice there you don't put gasoline there you have to put water it's specific what do you do with water wash wash whoo verse 19 for aaron and his son shall wash their hands and their feet their own so now we understand clearly that it's a pool of water it's made out of brass for the high priest and his children to wash watch what wash their feet and wash their hand what does it mean verse 20 when they go in the tabernacle of the congregation they shall wash with water that they die not so if you don't wash with this water and you try to enter the presence of god god kills you even though you are a priest even though by birth you are born a priest you are qualified to work for god you are qualified to approach god but before you approach god you must wash yourself through this water if you don't wash you don't enter the presence god kill you what kind of water is this what kind of water is this one that if i don't wash with it god kills me but i thought moses i saw you going to the river and picking up water there so the water in the river is not different than the water in this pool so why if i go wash there i cannot enter the presence of god you are telling me even though i took a bath in a river when i'm coming i must wash here first before entering god once the water reached that pool that water changes it is no more ordinary water it becomes a divine water [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord when they come near to the altar to minister to burn offering mad by fire unto the lord so they shall wash their hand and their feet that they die not and it shall be a statue forever to them even to him and to his seed throughout their generation no changes praise god we understand now a little bit about this level the bible continues in exodus 40. the bible say verse 6 and that shall set the altar of the burn offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tenth of the congregation i want you to listen here clearly he said and that shall set the lever between the tenth of the congregation and the altar so to make this a little bit clear let's go back to our pen here we have the tabernacle here the tabernacle is there we have the tabernacle here it's divided in three parts clear right here this is the sanctuary which they call the holy place here is the holiest so what happened god said put the bras an altar they put the bras and altar but it seems like when moses said put the bras an altar moses is saying put it at the door of the sanctuary in other words here that's what you would think but when you read the bible says take the level and put it between the altar and the tabernacle in other words in between the brazen altar here and the door of the tabernacle here there was the lever was here so the piece of furniture that was close to the door of the sanctuary is the level so the last piece you're going to meet before you enter into the sanctuary you must meet first 11. blessed be the name of the lord we go back there the bible say set the altar of the burnt offering before the door you see now of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation it looks like it's the altar who is at the door but it's not verse seven and that shall set the level between the tenth of the congregation and the altar and shall put water there in we consistent now it's water verse 30 and he set the level between the tenth of the congregation and the altar and put water there to wash with her and moses and aaron and his son wash their hand and their feet they're it when they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near onto the altar god is telling moses this when it's time to go to church i want all the priests and the high priest before they enter the church they must stop at the level and they must wash their hand and wash their feet then they enter the church if they enter in the church without washing their hand and the feet i will kill them why not taking a bath why only this hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's get into the myth now in hebrew chapter eight verse two the bible say a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle we are flipping to heaven now so we saw what moses did on the earth we're now going back to heaven which the lord peace and not a man so in heaven there is a tabernacle which god pitched himself on the earth there is a reflection of the tabernacle in heaven that moses pitched so on the earth here we found out that there is a pool called the level if there is a pull of the level in the earth there must be a pool in heaven because the earth only reflected heaven so let's go back in heaven see if there is a pool there hallelujah hebrew chapter 8 verse 5 who served unto the example on shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonish of god when he was about to make the tabernacle foresee he said say he that that shall make all things according to the pattern show to thee in the mouth brother branham interpret this he said the sea of glass in heaven this ain't very much symbols here but i want to erase this for a minute now we want to study here just a little bit the sea of glass is symbolized in the old temple for moses was commanded of god to build the temple on earth like he saw in he saw it in the heaven but i'm here is telling us that what moses called the level here on earth in heaven it was called the sea of glass where is that sea of glass the bible says this and i'm going to get to brother branham face brother branham say sea of glass he was like an anti-crystal now the sea of glass is symbolized tapped by the brass sea now it's clear this is the glassy in heaven moses saw it as the glassy and made what was called the brass sea or the level he just reproduced that so from today heaven sea of glass earth level so when we move our camera you know where we go hey back here now let's look at this sea of glass in heaven revelation chapter 4 verse 1 after this i look and behold the door was open in heaven brother branham referred here to the rapture because john was taken up and the first voice which i heard was as he were a trumpet talking to me which said come up even but i'm saying it's a top of the rapture church being raptured and i will surely which must he be hereafter verse five and out of the throne proceeded lightning and thundering before i move forward let me clarify here in this sanctuary here this holy place in this holy place here we have the candlestick right there everybody clear and we found out that the level is right here the candlestick is here when you go back all the way to the holy of holiest there we have the ark hey back here and on top of the ark we have the mercy seat between the caribbean which was the throne of god so we have a throne here back here and in the next room we have the candlestick ever clear and in the next room at the door you have the level so we have throne candlestick and level ever here let me go back now to revelation in revelation chapter 4 verse 5 and out of the throne remember now proceed lightning and thundering and voices this is a throne of judgment and there was seven lamps of fire burning before the throne everybody cares so far remember trump candlestick then level on the earth when we flip our camera up into heaven the first thing we found is a throne and before the throne is followed by the candlestick and well let's see after the candlestick what follows he said there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirit of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto water so now in heaven each throne candlestick or lampstand then the sea of glass on the earth it is the throne in the holy of holies then the candlestick in the holy place then in the other chord it is the level throne candlestick level throne can the stick level why that order are we okay hope i didn't lose a wing on someone ever here brother brother say let me draw a little picture a little bit here now saying here was the ark of the old testament all right the next thing that was called the holy of holies and the next place here was the altar which was the holy place everybody clear now now you understand the coat of brother brother follow the order you have the holy earth you have the throne and then you have the candlestick then you have the level and right before here was the zebras it's called in other words it was a place where the sacrifice was washed where did you get that brother brother the bible says when you get there you only wash your hand and your feet now brother branham say not only were the priests washing their hand and their feet but the sacrifice also was washed there may lord help us if we can get to solomon because solomon split this and you're going to see the number anybody clear brother branham said it was a place where the sacrifice was washed here before it was received at the altar at the brass altar or the brazen altar where the sacrifice was burned so when you bring your sacrifice the priest will be standing there they take your offering wash it first then take it to the altar and kill it so that water was a preparation to the killing blessed be the name of the lord paragraph 157 brother branham say in this sea of glass was before the throne that's heaven and before the holy place that's earth makes sense now just now remember the seven golden candlestick sat here like this and come in the level now that is the one reflect the light from the holy place out of here did you get it in heaven we have a throne then the candlestick damn the sea of glass on the earth we have the throne of god and then we have the candlestick then the level and brother branham said the candlestick have lights and those lights were lightened by the pillar of fire and the way they liked them when it leaked the first candlestick they take light they take fire from the first candlestick go to the second and they take the second to the third the third to the fourth the fourth to the fifth the fifth to the sixth the sixth to the seven in other words all those fires were one fire divided in seven and when you put the fire together you have the image of trust that's why the constellation came and brother branham called that the circle of fire he was the seventh spirit of god that walked through the seven church edges but the point here brother branham is saying is the light of those candles was shining through the sea anybody here so when we take water from the river we put it in the pool that water was changing by the reflection of the light [Applause] everybody here so when you get in that water and you look what you see reflecting there you are seeing the light from the candlestick and the light from the candlestick are only a reflection of the light from the throne so the throne reflects in the candlestick and the candlestick reflect in the sea of glass and when the worshiper comes he must be washed with that water where the star are reflecting no other water can put you in the presence of god but the water where your star is reflecting you say you're watching the river did you have a star there that's the star of the zodiac we want the reflection from the tabernacle you need to wash with the water appropriate for the start of your day where your star is washed is reflecting through the water that is the water that you need to be washed before you enter into the presence of god any other word that will kill you [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord did i lose anyone flight attendant they're all good prayer said be the name of the lord so let's blow up this sea of glass which is called the level what is this level let's make it easy brother branham say how do we come remind me on time brother child i'm already lost here he said how do we come we got to come this gentle church to this world which word come out sea of glass so the sea of gas is water what kind of world what kind of word is it he said we must come to this world the sea of glass water water of the world is that right recognize the word the word the way it's written then the sacrifice is received and filled with the holy gospel from the inside shining through the light of that edge here it comes out of the holy place into here out of the star into here so god reflecting the star and the star received the revelation of that day and he reflects that revelation in the sea of glass and the sea of glass once he reflects the star it becomes the water of life and then when you wash in the water god receive you and fill you with your spirit and you are candidate to enter the role of holism the mystery of the sea of glass blessed be the name of the lord now we understand that the sea of glass the priests come and they wash their extremities their hand and their feet and what brandon added to us that would they bring also the sacrifice and the wash so there is two things washing the priest hand fit before they enter into church and also washing the sacrifice very easy is there anymore brother child exodus chapter 40. the bible says [Music] and shall anoint the level so the level itself had to be anointed it was not just any kind of level not any kind of word because we know it's crust it is the word but it must be the anointed word [Applause] everybody here the anointed word where the star of your edge is reflecting and that star is only reflecting christ because at the absence of this tongue that's when the star is working hallelujah anoint the lever and his foot there is a foundation one foot not two and sanctify it in other words consecrated and that shall bring aaron everybody follow me and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation what was at the door of the tabernacle the level the sea of glass bring arrow bring his son there what's wrong moses have they done something wrong no relax i'm gonna do something bring aaron and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and do what and wash them with water i thought brother stephen you say they only wash the hand and the feet i touch you only say that they watch the sacrifice now they watch the priest themselves what is going on what is going on this sea of glass this level when they put water there they fast down you hear me god said bring aaron the high priest and bring the son of aaron or the children of the high priest not just the high priest but the high priest must have children [Applause] are you ready bring the high priest and the family of the high priest and wash them out with this water one time they're gonna take a bath in the water only one time once they take the bath for the remaining of their journey on this earth all they do is wash their feet and wash their hand [Applause] hallelujah he said you shall bring aaron and his son unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and wash them with water what happened after that and that shall put upon her on the water is somebody sleeping put up on air on water the holy garment so when aaron was coming as an election of god picked from him from among his brother as he's approaching god he has a garment from his family did you hear me he have clothes from his home but when he get to the sea of glass when he get to the level he have to remove everything that he brought from home moses was standing there with a trash can [Applause] you coming from your family come but when you get here all the clothing that mama and daddy gather to you i must strip you off completely and i will take those garments and put it in the trash and wash you with the lava then get new garments no more your family commented by the priests government and put it on you [Applause] my mama had a temper [Music] my mama divorced three times my father had a blood pressure all my family died with cancer bring those garments here i have a specific word bring those garment here when you get here all the cancer all the lineage all the genetic threats of your family i'm gonna go back to hell you're gonna get a new garment that's gonna wash you and change your dna and you will be no longer the child of ella branham [Applause] bring them in aaron strip him i'm from the tribe of liver fine stripping [Music] no no no i need this belt mama gave it to me give it to me give it to me no no it's a present they give me as my daddy say that this is a souvenir give it to me moses church what else does he have just like in the airport take your shoes off get those socks out no no no it's too cold in ohio bring me this hoe chest can make sure he's completely stripped i don't want nothing of his humanity anymore i don't want nothing of his natural birth nothing from his family i want him completely dead separated from his family examine him anything any pacemaker the surgeon put take that off bring him in wash him when they finish washing from today on this is your identification when they ask you who are you which family are you you say i'm the high priest [Applause] you don't say any more i may leave at there which family are you in i'm the son of the high priest i thought you were liver i'm a son of the high priest you don't see my you don't see my jacket [Applause] new family watch them put their clothes on what else do you want to go home okay because you heard them amen let's go verse 13 that shall put upon aaron the holy government the high priest and anoint him and sanctify him consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the water in the priest's office in other words before aaron can exercise his elected predestinated position ministry he must first be washed in the lava and not only wash strip completely wash put a new garment and do what verse 13 and that shall put upon aaron the holy government and do water and anoint him so when you put a new garment there is an anointing that is coming with that new government [Music] maybe when aaron was coming he was tired and moses strip him and put him there and wash him and wash him and wash him he took a a towel finish a toro car wash when he finished he step him there bless him everything is good put a new garment bring the anointing on he brought the anointing on and pour on him as soon as the poor maybe aaron was like because david said it's like the anointing of aaron that jump into the all the way there maybe something get into error aaron begin to move a little bit like this moses said that's fun give him some time next one in line next morning ever clear so before the high priest exercised his ministry he must be washed in the liver dress at the level and anointed at the level then he's ready for ministry amen verse 14 and that shall bring his son and clothe them with coat so not only is the high priest washed dressed anointed but the family of the high priest all of them must go through the same order the same process and the same anointing verse 15 and that shall anoint them as that deed anoint their father same anointing not a different anointing only the level is different aaron is the high priest you are the children of the high priest but the anointing is the same everybody and anointed them as they did anoint their father that the minister unto me in the priest's office who's anointing aaron moses who was moses a prophet a vindicated prophet must anoint the first high priest that have to be introduced in the tabernacle of earth there is two tabernacles there is a tabernacle in heaven and there is a tabernacle on the earth the tabernacle on the earth require a high priest and to introduce the high priest you hear me to introduce the high priest there must be a vindicated prophet standing there to wash the high priest and wash him and rob him and anoint him then introduce the first high priest of the levitical priesthood was anointed washed and then dressed by a vindicated prophet and started the levitical principle verse 15 for the anointing this anointing shall surely be an everlasting water so you telling me the levitical priesthood did not cease the levitical priesthood stop yes at the cross but the anointing god said it's everlasting that's why you need a prophet amen and for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generation that's why brother branham explained those words forever it's for a time period because we know the levitical priesthood was only a reflection of something that happened in heaven [Applause] amen that was not the true tabernacle that was a copy the true tabernacle was in heaven but they placed an anointing and the one who was introduced as the first high priest was introduced by a prophet a prophet by the name of moses who was moses you're clear buckle up i'm searching a gps and sooner i'm going to head to the airport everybody number chapter 26 verse 58 these are the family of delivered the family of the libyanite remember the genealogy hold the message the family of the hebron the family of the malad the family of the mushad the family of the kuratite all of these are families of liver evol and koa begot ammon we clear that we tried to see moses to introduce the levitical priesthood the first high priest of the first tabernacle must be introduced by a vindicated prophet with a message that prophets must be in the wilderness come out of a wilderness with a vindicated message and that prophet was given the privilege to wash the high priest that had to start the levitical priesthood we okay koha begat emerald verse 59 and the name of imran wife was yokebed we understand who is this now sister you can be this bad the daughter of liver so right here we understand that the mother of moses was delivered am i reading a different bible i don't want you to say brother stephen say the bible says brother branham said i'm putting everything on the screen so right here the father of moses was a liver the mother of moses was also a liver because young bed the daughter of liver whom her mother bear to liver in egypt and she bear unto amram aaron and moses and miriam their sister in other words amram marry his auntie exodus chapter six and emerald took him jochebed his father's what is that clear now his father's sister's wife and she bare him aaron and who moses so this prophet that must anoint the first high priest and wash the high priest and dress the high priest that prophet must be must have a father levitt to introduce a high priest hallelujah we're still looking at moses in first chronicle chapter 2 23 the bible says the sons of emran aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy thing he and his son forever but we know there was a stop to that to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to bless his name forever now concerning moses the man of god his son were named after the tribe of water so moses himself was a liver he was a liver vindicated prophet his mother liver his father liver pure liver that's the man that washed the first high priest dressed the first high priest and introduced the first high priest in psalm 99 verse 6 the bible says moses and aaron among his worker so moses was not only a leaver not only a prophet but moses was also a priest so the first man that introduced the first high priest was a vindicated prophet was in the wilderness father liver mother liver himself a liver a priest he said moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name yet samuel exercised the priest office anybody clear where are you going brother stephen what is the caliber of moses in number 12 verse 6 8 and he said hear now my word if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all my house with him will i speak mouth to mouth so moses was not just an ordinary prophet he was a higher caliber prophet so to introduce the levitical priesthood the levitical priesthood he require a high priest but the high priest must be introduced by a high caliber prophet his father must be a liver his mother must be a liver he himself must be a liver and he also must be a priest to get the privilege to watch the levitical first high priest amen with him will i speak month to month even apparently and not in dark speeches in other words plain and the similarities of the lord shall he behold he can see god wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant moses deuteronomy 20 18 18 i will raise them a prophet from among their brethren like unto who even christ have to come at the caliber of moses deuteronomy 34 10 and there arose not a prophet says in all israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face a vindicated high category prophet moses father liverpool mother liverpool he himself delivered and a priest himself was granted the privilege to introduce the first high priest of the levitical priesthood and he had the privilege to take the high priest and wash him and dress him and anoint him and introduce him to the service that's the tabernacle on the earth everybody let's flip ourselves to heaven you ready isaiah 6 1 in the year that king uzziah died this is isaiah going to the temple i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne in heaven high and lift up and his train filled the temple the temple in heaven above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with twenty he covered his face and with twenty he covered his feet and with twin he did fly verse five then i say wow is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for man eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coat in his hand which he had taken from the tongue from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched their lips then iniquity is taken away and that sin purge when you enter in the tabernacle on the earth number one you must be washed one time number two once you are washed one time every time you go to church or to the tabernacle you must stop at the door and wash your feet and wash your hand in other words the priesthood delivered of the old testament were preparing the worshiper to enter into the presence of god and moses was given a commission not only to reproduce the furniture of the tabernacle in heaven but he must also reproduce the priesthood that was in heaven those priests were also in heaven because when isaiah entered heaven he found himself unclean so a priest in heaven must move quickly and take the cause and purify him quickly before he accessed god so what was what the levat were doing in heaven that's what the seraphim were they are what the levite were doing on the earth that's what the seraphim were doing in heaven blessed be the name of the lord brother branham says this isaiah was a prophet so he goes down to the temple and he saw a real example god because what was on the earth was a reflection not the heavenly seraphim as they flew through the temple now a seraphim is a mighty word it is not an angel but what it is it is a sacrifice burner who was burning the sacrifice on earth the priest in heaven the seraphim so the priests of heaven are the seraphim so moses not only did he reflect the furniture he also reflect the priesthood in heaven so if there is a priesthood in heaven there must be also a high priest in heaven are we coming okay yeah the airplane is doing this amen blessed be the name of the lord but it's a sacrifice burner he has something to do with the atonement because he offered the sacrifice to make a way for the repented who sinner to the throne of water just like the priests on the earth prepare you to enter to the presence of god in heaven there must be a priest to prepare you to enter in the tabernacle not preached by men but the lord himself pitched amen what a position higher than angel greater than an angel for the edges stand back but the seraphim goes forward with the offering right in the presence of god a burner they offer the prayer that has been made the burner of the sacrifice so there is a reflection of a priesthood over there now the seraphim is the burner of the sacrifice which is one of the highest order of angel they are next to the caribbean those are in the throne there he was angels and then seraphim and then caribou the seraphim is actually the burner of the sacrifice making the way for the sinners approach a real high order of holiness in the temple of who god that's why when when isaiah entered there he found himself he said wow unto me i'm a man of a clean lip because he's in heaven a seraphim flew quickly and say this is the seed of abraham he can get killed quickly bring the stuff sanctify him when he sanctify him he stand in the presence of god god say who do i send he's saying now i'm ready because he was sanctified by a seraphim when you sanctify on the earth name you ready for the ministry hallelujah in the message influence brother branham say seraphim it means burner the word seraphim means which is next to the altar actually the seraphim is the one who received the sacrifice you see that and cleans the worshiper they leave out of heaven and then present him to god the seraphim does this seraphim was angelic beings in a high order and they are the very next one to god right at the altar they receive the sacrifice it shows the justice of god that sin cannot come in his presence unless it has been atoned for amen blessed be the name of the lord the vision of the temple he saw god upon his throne lift up and not the heavenly seraphim which means burner a special designated person in heaven influence the seraphim there are not angels they are supposed to be the sacrifice burner to plead the way for the guilty and they were sacrificed burner in other words the seraphim were the leaver of the heaven now we got two priesthood two temple the temple on the earth temple in heaven priesthood on the earth pursued on heaven now we got a high priest on the earth introduced by a mighty prophet father mother never he himself a priest let's see now do we have a high priest in heaven if we do have him who must introduce him now let's change the dispensation from the levitical to the correct high priest because that was a shadow zechariah and he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord hey and satan standing at his right hand to resist him and joshua was clothed with filthy garment on the earth he was a high priest when he entered in the true tabernacle everything is filthy remember on the earth when you come you come with filthy government moses destroy it put it in a trash they got to give you a new one in heaven the same thing must happen amen joshua was club with filthy government stood before the angel verse 4 and he answered and speak unto those that stood before him they were a priesthood in heaven saying take away the filthy garment from him so what moses was doing here was only a reflection over there and unto him unto him he said behold i have caused that iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with a change of garment so when you're coming from your family on the earth they gotta strip you off take it off give you new garment it was only a reflection of what was happening in heaven when you enter into heaven you see another priesthood when they see you filthy government they gotta wash you up take everything away and bring you a new clothe because you got to enter the presence of god if not you're going to be killed but clear so far we're connecting the dot so heading straight to the airport amen amen and then verse 5 and i said let them the priesthood set a fair mitchell because he was a high priest upon his head and they the priesthood in heaven set a fair meeting upon his head matter upon his head and clothed him with garment and the angel of the lord stood by him and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua now the word commanded unto joshua saying that save the lord of hosts if that will work in my ways he's talking to a levitical high priest if you walk in my way and if that keep my charge then that shall also judge my house and shall also keep my cord and i will give the places to walk among these that stand by the priest of heaven okay the levitical of heaven here now oh joshua the high priest that and that fellow that sit before thee for their men wonder that for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch he have just cleaned the high priest on earth he finished with him but he looked at joshua he said joshua even though you're there even though you're a high priest i'm going to tell you a secret i'm going to send somebody who's called the branch he will be coming who is the branch if the prophetical priesthood was forever why do we need again another priesthood hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord hebrew 10 for the lord having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing just a shadow can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make they come there on to perfection so even though everything moses did was a reflection a replica of heaven yet perfection could never be achieved by the levitical pursuit we need something better something higher something that not only is going to clean the worship naturally but it's going to claim him also spiritually because joshua naturally was clean but when he entered in the presence of god they found him with filthy government isaiah was a good prophet when he entered in the tabernacle of god they found him he was a man with unclean lips so what was going there was not enough you need somebody that when when you enter heaven god cannot find even a spot god will check you up turn you up turn you down you say which speeches are you coming in everybody that gets here found fault but which which which caliber are you in you need somebody that can pass your god you need a priesthood that when it washes you god himself cannot find a spot or a wicklow you can give god all eternity you say father keep searching on eternity if you're gonna find one thing and god searching all eternity and he comes back to you he said i found no fault in you that's the priest we need [Applause] you want me stop here you heard them deacon blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hebrews 7 verse 19 the bible say for the lord made water nothing perfect as much as we appreciate the law he made nothing perfect but the bringing it off a water the law was only telling you the real deal is coming [Music] i cannot let you comfortless like this let me give you a substitute to kind of calm your nerves down but hold on there is coming an appointed time where the real deal is coming and when that deal comes it will never be changing [Applause] hallelujah but bringing in a better hope by day which we draw night to water because unto the law yet the people could not access god you heard it yesterday they have to put like a band on a high priest to keep listening for him all the time and if he's dead oh my god get the next one and the next one is trembling already because the first one is already dead did i do something my wife forgive me for talking to you buddy yesterday i'm gonna go to inside make sure did you forgive me the woman said yes yes did you really forgive me you know i'm getting there true repentance my children did i do something wrong did i yell at you i'm sorry for spanking you i'm going into the holy of holies i want to make sure everything is clean are you there and then when he enter everybody must listen everybody is on the hard blood pressure is over there some are in icu we wait is the high priest down is the high priest i committed adultery over there i'm waiting for the high priest hey harry hurry too much we need a high priest that enter not every year just once and then i can sleep in peace and then my righteousness is laying on him hallelujah then you can sleep in peace and you can go your way and if you ask me i say look at him oh my god is the time okay oh my god amen now in hebrews 7 the bible says this and verily they that are the son of liver who received the office of the priesthood has a commandment to take death of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loans of abraham and he whose descent is not counted from them received path of abraham and bless him that has the promise so one day abraham went to fight when he was coming up he saw somebody coming up to meet him abraham when he looked at him he said ah this is a strange man i know who you are wait a minute uh check my bank account i have been working for the whole year i have not paid my tax quickly quickly who told abraham he need to pay his tax who taught abraham who taught abraham abraham went and took everything and said here this is my thought he took the attack so the attack was not really to the levitical priesthood the thought was supposed to go in another pressure but because he's not there he said who is delivered on earth is there a liver there in lama ohio do we have a liver since i'm not there you as my representative because i am the chief shepherd you are the shepherd you as my representative i don't do i don't have anything to do with it you take the money so when they give you they actually doing that to me normally we should all go to heaven and go and knock and say i come this is my paycheck and go back there he said no no no i don't want you here bothering me with time i'll put somebody there when you work you're working more overtime make sure you bring everything and give to the man called chad lamb over there when you give it to him me in heaven i will check you that he gave it to me bless him so if you have not been paying your time make sure you clear that up ever clear he didn't tell me to preach on them everybody clear so far and without your contradiction verse seven the less that's why to relax you so you can soak more the less is blessed of the baby and here men that died received death but he that receiveth them of whom it is witness that he leaves and as amazon say liver also who received path paid us in who how did liverpool in abraham why was he only recognized to liver because the priest would have to come there anybody here for he was yet in the launch of abraham when melchizedek meet him so we found a man here come and kiss and he's dealing with darling and we know taving we give it to church why did abraham give tithing to this man call melchizedek amen the problem is that a vertical priesthood cannot bring nothing to perfection and god gave joshua the high priest a promise he said i am going to send the branch the branch will come and we found a man here come and kiss that with our father with our mother without beginning of death without ending of life how can you kill somebody like that how can you kill him if you notice when abraham gave him tithe he there he never ate he was the one that gave abraham something to eat not him he ate in genesis 18 when he he he wore the body of him that's when he ate pork chop he was not a vegetarian sorry you can continue on your salad everybody so far anybody cares so far so we needed a new pursue the levitical priesthood is already done away it's not working the worshiper come and worship god they leave but he's still struggling with the same desire he said god i don't know i don't know should i shoot myself for what i say i'm not going to do this again and i keep doing this again i keep doing this again are you doing this again i finished all my limbs over there i have 30. i already finished 20 because i've seen 20 times we need something better we need something better but that which came to abraham is a tea orphan it is working but he cannot eat if you take a knife you poke him nothing if you say melchizedek i am hurt he doesn't understand you can touch him like this melchizedek you won't say you can punch him you won't say ouch can you say mercedes i had a headache a headache how does he work you say no no my nerve i can't sleep melchizedek is looking because he never sleeps no slumber he's looking at you you have insomnia you can sleep okay what is going on you see the the i went and the doctor say this melchizedek is still looking say yeah i understand i feel sorry for you but i can't really feel what you're saying can you please explain me more you say melchizedek when he hurt you know when i do this i can't really feel it like he said they said what is this so we needed something that when i tell him he hurt he knows when i tell him it's headache he understand headache when i pinch him he's gonna say ouch the same way i say ouch if i fall he falls because my kisser they can appear and disappear but me i cannot disappear if i go right there i'm gonna hit the wall i need somebody who can hit the world like me but that person must be god brother branham said god could not suffer in the spirit he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the temptation of the power of death that he might take it upon himself to stand in the presence of the great spirit jehovah the spirit not the man the spirit to make intercession to this life and jesus took that in order to make intercession for us for he knows how he feels when you get sick he knows how you feel when you are tempted he knows how you feel we needed a better sacrifice a better priesthood oh my god god coming down to become man to die god could not die as a spirit he could not die he is eternal and he could not die but god could make himself in such a way that he could feel pain that he could feel and suffer god could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he become man he could suffer he could feel the pain the temptation that man went through like adam and eve in the garden of eden and everyone sees so there is why do we want god to feel pain why should the high priest feel pain why take your bible to hebrew probably i'm gonna cut up here then we'll pick up on sunday let's go to hebrew hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord let's go to hebrew chapter 5. then i'm going to stop somewhere here then we'll pick it up hebrew chapter 5. that's why i call it part one if you dare you can say amen hebrew chapter five if everybody is there you can say amen verse one for every high priest taken from man is ordained for who for man in things pertain to god that he may offer both gift and sacrifice for sin who can have compassion on the ignorant the requirement of a high priest he must understand the ignorant brother marcus whence everybody say pastor put him in the hand of the devil he must be there to film that person and say maybe he didn't mean that because the law was quickly take the stone and let's go when they came to the true high priest they brought a woman they said there is no argument we have her tape we recorded her she committed adultery we have the dna all we want is apply moses jesus said no problem be very easy do you have a pen sat down on the pill they said did you hear us we want to hear from you you say any of you who have not seen be the first one you who are perfect okay you who are perfect you didn't cheat your wife you didn't steal you didn't do all of this you are perfect take one thing because the rich young ruler thought he was perfect only christ could reveal his weakness he had a problem with giving money to the poor amen he said you who are perfect take the first son cuts to this woman and jesus continued and then this one remember i cheated this one remember i just got into a fight yesterday this one remember and when jesus finished say woman empty the whole church empty so now i'm dealing with a prostitute in the church say go that's the priest we need he can understand the ignorance [Music] hallelujah verse two who can have compassion on their ignorant and on them that are out of the way so when you come to the high priest the high priest when you bring him a sinner there is something built in the high priest that he understands that sinner in a different way are you looking at is that drunk or over there he cast me the last time i stopped at the gas station to get the guys that's you when you bring him to the high priest the hype we say praise be the name of the lord we got a soul for christ bring him in bring him in quickly to the oil oh bring him in to the door of the tabernacle i got a lover here bring him in you say not this one he cheated me yesterday he cast me like whisper bringing me come in with him just the way no no no he need to repent to me for the high priest leave him alone just the way he is bring him i have a trash can here when he come i know how to strip him and i know how to watch him and i know how to introduce him a high priest that can understand that hallelujah he said who can understand them that are out of the way for that he himself also is what compass with infirmities he suffer himself he understands that even though i'm going into the holy of holies yet i am not really qualified i'm only entering there by grace so he can understand the other one so if god stay make he's a deck he still don't understand so they gotta take god and make god in a way that god can feel pain to the point that god can be looking at the tree that he created to find if he can have food instead of him speaking and having a a good hamburger he need to go also like me and look at the tree he have to suffer hunger then he's going to be a better high priest verse three and by reason harry of hereof he should as for the people so also for himself to offer for the sin and no man take this honor to himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so also christ's glorify not himself brother robert to be made a high priest but he does say to him you are my son today i have begotten you as he said also in another place you are a priest forever after the order of who now we got to order we got the levitical order now we got melchizedek order the problem with melchizedek it's a heavenly order he cannot feel pain so we gotta take that order and immorph that order enemorphin bring him down condescend that order until that order can become flesh are you there that's where keonosis and morphe have to enter in place to take the eternal god the eternal man the eternal one that feel all time space and eternity god have to humble himself have to be leader himself have to take on him not the form of an angel by the form of a man as a form of the son the children of abraham so he can suffer like me [Music] hallelujah let's go to hebrew 2. and i'm going to stop amen hebrew two if you dare you can say amen hebrew two verse nine but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the water he was the creator of the angel because the spirit cannot feel pain now he has to be made lower than the angel but to make himself lower than the angel he must go through chemosis any morphe in my faith means he's changing one form to another in means that god is moving from one form into another form so if he was here invisible invisible in a morphe he becomes visible about here so immorphy is just saying changing a form changing of form ever here but a morphe was not sufficient because god was a spirit and nobody can see god ever if god flips and you see him what are you gonna how are you gonna see him are you seeing the reflection of god or are you seeing god himself anybody care so to make sure whoever because the bible said the only begotten of god in other words god was the eternal spirit then god birthed himself bless god are you there because god as the eternal spirit was locked but thank god in the bosom of the father in the bosom of god there was an attribute called the logos are you there and the logos meant the fullness of god so when god took the logos out of him and pulled the logos out the logos look back a god and say do you know what my meaning is god said yes he said me i'm all god so because i'm out i must suck you god into me did you hear me when we say poor brother when i'm explaining that it is not like you take water from a butter and you pour that in the glass that's not the god but here you take the bottle itself and the water and the top and the level you take everything and you put it in the glass ever clear so when the logos was coming out of god as a baby the lord god took god and sucked him into himself everybody here that process is called kenosis kinases is what made the pillar of fire god keynosis means what you start with is exactly what you end up with if you start with god you're gonna end up with god so he not only more faith he also kind of sees [Applause] everybody here so when he kind of says he become the pillar of fire still mystical we see a fire walking talking to moses talking to moses moses say i'm sorry can i say something he said talk say i'm tired every day i'm hearing you can i see you yes how can we be friend and never even see your face all i see is the light moving you say moses step there on the cleft of the rock moses stepped and suddenly he show him what he said oh he looks like me it's like a man it's like a man [Applause] when he want to approach he said no no no no no moses don't approach take your feet take your shoes stay back stand back stand back would you say still have a problem we still have a problem but how are we going to take this being and put it in human flesh amen let me head to the airport how can you handle this brother amen verse 9 and we see jesus who was made a little lower than angel for to suffer of the death because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god logos and that word was god and that word was made fresh because hebrew 10 7 say sacrifice an offering you don't want but you made me a body now they draw the eternal dwelling spirit can condescend down and dwell into a man so when you shake jesus hand you shaking the hand of god when you're talking to jesus you're talking to god if you push jesus you're pushing god [Applause] god now can be hurt god now can suffer god now can have headache god now can have pain now we got a good high priest now you can understand me so when i'm talking we have on the same language have you seen two sister talking about pregnancy the men are sitting there back because he doesn't understand the sister is saying he hurt and then i could not sleep i'm going this the man out there they can explain you all you want you would never understand until you're a woman you heard it amen amen clone him with glory and him by grace by the grace of god should taste death for every man for he becomes him for whom all things and by whom all things in bringing many son to glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through water suffering for both he does sanctify and they who are sanctified are all water [Music] anybody here for which cause he is not ashamed to call them water so we are brother to the high priest [Applause] we are now the brother of the high priest [Applause] oh my god [Music] how can you handle this i told you 3 verse 12 saying i will declare your name to my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing prayers to you and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the water the children which who so these high priests also have children [Applause] the first high priests have children the second high priest also have children if he didn't have beginning of days no ending of self-time what do you think about his children do you think about his children what do you think about his children don't you look at your natural breath look at your second breath it tells you where you come from we came out of god we are going back to god we have no beginning of day no ending of life that's why the bible say esther has no mother no father [Applause] not only my kids say that look in your bible they will see a woman they say she didn't have a father or a mother a specie of melchizedek i don't have a beginning of day my brother i don't have the ending of life i'm only in a journey sooner i'm gonna go back again where i came from i came from god i am going back from god blessed be the name of the we are not creature of time we are creatures of eternity quit looking yourself down [Music] but the child they will hit the airport let me stop here continue to ponder and then we're going to pick it up on sunday god we shall bless you let's stay [Applause] let the musician come if i keep moving i can't lay into this plane that's a hard plane to land hallelujah church it is time to know who we are [Applause] for years the bride is living under their privilege our bride is living under the privilege okay we know that when are we going to live at our prison the sooner the day is approaching the more he's become becoming more like him [Applause] i am not going to heaven lamping i am going to heaven shouting amen i'm going to go to heaven the day i'm going to heaven hell is rejoicing they say who thank you jesus he's out because we suffer so much all the time the word the word the word the word now let him go so we can enjoy the tribulation period let him go yes i must make them suffer because my family is not a laboratory test for the devil to bring children in my family under sickness under infirmity bringing sickness all the time every summer i must further feel sick no i am not the laboratory i'm a creature of eternity when i'm approaching the devil must know who i am [Applause] hallelujah because he's king of kings we are running and rolling with him let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning lord thanking you for everything you have been doing for us father when we enter into these realms father it's endless we don't even

theophany that we bypass lord father may you help us lord may we appreciate you more and more in our life because of this great sacrifice that you have done lord father so that today when we speak we

father may be a suffering in the body lord something that lingers that they get lord father got used to it thinking lord father that it's normal lord we are here this morning to tell them that it's

lord every category of devils was represented there even coffeed was there before even he appeared in 2019 oh lord whoever is suffering let lord father that virtue be drawn out of you this morning
