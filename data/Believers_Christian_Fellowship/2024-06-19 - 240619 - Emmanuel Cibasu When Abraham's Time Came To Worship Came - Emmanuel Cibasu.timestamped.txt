[16:51] to live
[16:54] in knowing the abundance of your

[18:27] in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray
[18:30] amen God bless you all you may be
[18:34] seated now I have the daunting task of
[18:39] uh running
[18:42] the God bless
[18:44] you beloved brothers and sisters thank
[18:48] you um the first portion was is going to
[18:52] be the report mission report that uh
[18:57] after we went there um just a couple of
[18:59] weeks ago came from uh Congo DR Congo
[19:03] which is in Africa so actually the trip
[19:07] was meant
[19:09] to uh not only for the preaching of the
[19:13] word but also to helping brothers and
[19:18] sisters that are needy so we know that
[19:20] in the Book of James it says if you only
[19:23] profess that you have faith and your
[19:26] brother is in need you will not sent him
[19:29] back home and said I will be praying for
[19:31] you whatever you have you will give him
[19:34] and that's Faith so faith has actions
[19:37] amen yeah faith is not empty empty faith
[19:42] that time was in uh the church church
[19:45] ages this time the bride sees another
[19:49] member of the Bride in
[19:52] need we have nothing we we can hold on
[19:55] to ourselves so that's why we're going
[19:58] to be uh sharing here but before I go
[20:01] sometimes it's easy to forget I know
[20:03] that I forgot the last time I was here
[20:06] giving uh a mission uh report about uh
[20:11] me me and Brother Andy uh
[20:14] Randy Randy SAS going to the Congo I
[20:18] forgot to mention that brother Nathaniel
[20:20] sas's son who is the pastor in the
[20:23] church there they did um support that
[20:27] mission with all the the fair even the
[20:31] internal Fair within the Congo providing
[20:34] even where to stay in the food so
[20:37] brother Nathaniel has and the church
[20:40] provided us uh to us and we want to be
[20:42] very grateful to for that also in the
[20:45] other missions um charitable missions I
[20:49] have a two families at uh the true world
[20:53] that are very faithful since we shifted
[20:57] from uh
[20:59] Haiti and the Dominican Republic going
[21:01] to the Congo for a mission and charity
[21:04] uh those families have been very
[21:07] faithful every year supporting us with
[21:10] whatever need they have whatever means
[21:12] they have so we can fulfill some needs
[21:15] so we're going to be studying this this
[21:17] is a journey I think I left
[21:19] here uh May
[21:22] 31st and then uh headed uh to Belgium
[21:27] first
[21:29] uh you will see so it's
[21:32] uh that's how my journey
[21:35] started uh from the
[21:38] US then uh to uh Brussels Belgium and
[21:43] then from there we have a few more hours
[21:46] to uh fly down to kinasa which is the
[21:50] capital city uh on the northwest side no
[21:55] Southwest side of uh of the Congo where
[21:58] we started our uh Journey there so we
[22:01] went not only we did
[22:04] um uh preach but also we were mindful of
[22:09] the needy not only among Brothers and
[22:11] Sisters of the same Faith but also we
[22:14] have some other places we go like at the
[22:17] nursing homes where people elderly that
[22:20] are very sick some will hear the word of
[22:23] God for the very last time and we it's
[22:27] just that God if
[22:29] someone could hear your word wherever
[22:30] they might be just send us so he leads
[22:33] us the way he wants to lead us so and
[22:35] also visiting some orphanages there are
[22:37] so many stories that standing here we
[22:40] will not even uh uh get a start on that
[22:45] so we land I left here on
[22:47] U Thursday Thursday U noon and landed
[22:52] there on Friday night it takes over 27
[22:57] Plus hours of flying so that's uh in the
[23:02] Congo I don't know which okay so I see
[23:05] so the Congo is uh it's it might be the
[23:08] second or first largest country in
[23:11] Africa so it has
[23:14] over5
[23:16] million and um um it has the these are
[23:21] the old provinces they used to have
[23:22] eight provinces now it has probably 26
[23:25] they have kind of divided the them up
[23:29] so that's at the airport so I am well
[23:32] guarded there so nobody can touch me I
[23:36] have uh a brother of mine who works for
[23:39] the government he's in the security and
[23:42] knowing that sometimes for American when
[23:44] they come over so just to avoid some
[23:47] people bothering them maybe on the roads
[23:50] or to check who they are might harm you
[23:53] so he managed to send me uh two Jeeps
[23:57] with those uh those army army guys so I
[24:01] was well guarded
[24:04] there God God knows how to provide his
[24:07] help said hey you know what you're going
[24:09] to serve me there I'm going to take care
[24:11] of you I'm going to I'm going to provide
[24:13] for you and then the next one will be I
[24:17] know you remember this this is the
[24:19] church that you contributed to put the
[24:24] roof on top and not only that so to
[24:27] provide even for the rest rooms they
[24:28] didn't have restrooms so they got some
[24:32] restrooms so this is how the church
[24:34] looked
[24:35] like so that's where uh we we started
[24:38] our uh service on Sunday Sunday morning
[24:42] with uh Pastor
[24:44] Matthew is there so this is uh just
[24:49] inside this is the the pastor so you
[24:52] will see that the the pictures are kind
[24:54] of
[24:55] more lighter so
[24:58] I don't know how they do it but uh so
[25:01] that's uh me um Pastor Matthew and uh
[25:05] his wife in the in the church himself
[25:08] his wife in the congregation are sending
[25:12] their greetings to you all and also
[25:16] sending their gratefulness for all that
[25:19] you have done for them now they have a a
[25:22] church a building they are no longer
[25:25] running away when it's raining or when
[25:27] it's a Dusty or windy so they can have
[25:31] services and the people even staying
[25:33] there sleeping in the church sometimes
[25:36] just as they feel led to pray
[25:38] overnight they're very very grateful so
[25:41] all of them and that's the the inside of
[25:45] uh uh the the congregation the the
[25:47] church building so it's uh got new
[25:51] chairs
[25:53] new uh I don't know what else they have
[25:56] there am I forget but um it it did help
[26:00] them a lot so they are they're feeling
[26:03] uh your love and they know that there's
[26:05] a uh a portion of the Bride somewhere
[26:09] that is uh well caring for
[26:12] them yeah so that's uh me there and uh
[26:16] the translated that's on Sunday morning
[26:19] as we're speaking
[26:21] there and that's uh the
[26:26] audience also we have a
[26:28] um just taking little pictures there to
[26:31] show how uh the building looks inside
[26:34] and the new chairs and the new sitting
[26:36] places so they're very grateful and we
[26:39] had a wonderful time there in the Lord
[26:42] that's still in the church and so this
[26:46] one this is a that's a
[26:49] widow um she I think before I got there
[26:54] brother Matthew has uh texted me that
[26:58] that we have a widow um a sister Widow
[27:01] in the church but she would love to come
[27:02] to the service and she was in the
[27:05] hospital in those hospitals because
[27:07] they're so poor sometimes if you don't
[27:09] have money they will not let you get out
[27:11] of the hospital they will hold your
[27:13] Ransom there for a couple of days until
[27:16] someone comes and redeems you so we were
[27:19] able to provide the Redemption price so
[27:23] she was able to get out of the hospital
[27:26] and then there are a couple of sisters
[27:27] here and brothers that I'm very grateful
[27:30] that are supporting the the the charity
[27:33] a couple of sisters here gave something
[27:35] I said okay she's going to be enjoying
[27:38] that we got some materials to make her
[27:42] the outfit she's she's having there
[27:44] those are new so I know uh sisters that
[27:48] did that uh God bless you so she's there
[27:53] she was very happy to be able to not
[27:55] only get out of the hospital to be able
[27:57] to come to the service and to find that
[27:59] we had a a little package for for
[28:03] her this is after the
[28:06] service that's a group of Believers that
[28:09] uh decided to be baptized that day so we
[28:12] have I think we have two brothers there
[28:14] were three brothers one was not there
[28:16] maybe stepped away three brothers and
[28:19] those uh Five Sisters they uh were
[28:24] baptized uh that after service they were
[28:27] uh moved by the the the preaching of the
[28:30] word and these are some of the ministers
[28:32] that came around they have a um I think
[28:36] small congregations in the area and they
[28:39] came in they uh with their um um the
[28:43] Believers some of the Believers in their
[28:45] congregation so most of them they go to
[28:48] places that I would not be able to get
[28:50] there so places that a car cannot go
[28:53] there even a motorcycle they have to
[28:54] walk sometime take a little little boat
[28:57] on a on on a body of water to cross and
[29:01] go preach very poor and remote area and
[29:04] the those are the brothers are doing the
[29:06] job they're willing to do that and with
[29:09] our little Charity we're supporting them
[29:11] every month with just something that
[29:13] they would not lack any transportation
[29:16] or if they have any need to go minister
[29:19] to those remote areas and it's not very
[29:22] expensive but we we we're glad to do
[29:25] that because this gospel that's the only
[29:28] message living message I has to go
[29:31] through the land
[29:33] amen and then that was on Sunday and on
[29:36] Monday so the we had no service Monday I
[29:40] had to do the charity work so I went to
[29:42] a place got the needs of some uh
[29:45] Believers in the area couple of churches
[29:48] and we did provide some rice some uh uh
[29:52] flowers semolina flowers maze uh beans
[29:57] and uh powder milk those kind of things
[30:00] and some even needed seeds to just go do
[30:04] uh their farming to go to their field so
[30:09] I'm there uh as we were Distributing
[30:11] that after purchasing stacking them
[30:14] someplace and then we we start working
[30:17] there I have a little video because we
[30:21] had just hundreds and hundreds of uh
[30:23] images pictures didn't want to take a
[30:26] long time but this is uh this would be
[30:29] for the same Monday in the afternoon if
[30:34] I can
[30:35] remember
[30:37] to yeah the same day so as we went
[30:42] to I think nursing
[30:45] home and uh and a couple orphanages we
[30:50] visited so I we we had to drive almost
[30:53] sixth time with that uh that jeep there
[30:55] or seven time just to be able to pick up
[30:58] go deliver pick up go deliver because we
[31:00] didn't have any big
[31:02] one that's a cath Catholic
[31:06] n at a Catholic uh place they are taking
[31:10] care of the the elderly they are very
[31:13] sick some down here so they're very
[31:16] critical condition
[31:19] so we get a chance to go visit them then
[31:24] after they eat we get into one room
[31:26] where we can share May maybe 30 minutes
[31:29] of the word of God in in the Catholic
[31:31] place and that's Catholic none there
[31:35] she is giving a
[31:37] testimony that the are people that come
[31:40] and visit us here but when you come it's
[31:43] different you have a different Spirit
[31:45] what kind of Faith do you have so we
[31:48] talked and so she's uh she asked for me
[31:52] to bring her a tablet I said if I bring
[31:54] you a tablet of what I believe would you
[31:56] be able to receive he said bring it to
[31:58] I'll be able to keep it to take it so
[32:00] next time I will be taking a tablet a
[32:03] message to give to
[32:04] her
[32:11] yeah that's uh I think this is before we
[32:15] had u a devotion with them so I did have
[32:18] a devotion I was at the kitchen just
[32:20] trying to do to help
[32:23] them uh she's uh she's very very
[32:27] grateful that every time I come there
[32:28] that please uh come and visit us okay
[32:32] and then
[32:34] on on Tuesday on Tuesday I had to go to
[32:38] brother Matthew's place there was a
[32:39] little place we had to speak so we got
[32:42] to his church first the church uh you
[32:44] supported here and then got some
[32:47] ministers and then we did visit the
[32:50] sister the Widow sister she got some
[32:53] more materials for uh her uh dresses she
[32:57] was a very grateful that she was
[32:58] standing cuz she hasn't been feeling
[33:01] good she wasn't feeling good 3 weeks
[33:03] prior to that so she was just having a
[33:06] jubilee there knowing that I was there
[33:08] we did provide for food Provisions so
[33:12] she was very grateful and uh all of them
[33:14] they sending just their greetings to
[33:17] whoever is sending us
[33:19] there and then uh that's the place we
[33:22] did speak on
[33:24] Tuesday it's a building so
[33:29] inside there but people are receiving
[33:32] the word they don't have any building
[33:33] they can just get whatever they have but
[33:36] they desire they long to hear the word
[33:37] of God and when you bring the fresh word
[33:40] they're just receiving it yes with uh
[33:43] with whole heart yeah so they didn't
[33:45] invite the people to come and that's the
[33:48] inside uh before I uh I I I went to the
[33:51] the
[33:53] pulpit that's the same place that was on
[33:57] Tuesday and on Wednesday we had to visit
[34:01] a couple of orphanages too so that's the
[34:05] place there's a a none again Catholic
[34:08] people so seems like where the Catholics
[34:10] are we trying to slip in
[34:14] yeah to slip in and the reason I'm going
[34:18] mostly to the Catholic people
[34:21] they they this they are a bit sincere
[34:25] when when you you you coming there you
[34:28] providing the means they with all they
[34:31] know of the Catholic they're still able
[34:33] to keep what you give them some other
[34:35] places you you're not sure what they're
[34:37] going to be doing with what you give so
[34:39] with them I have confidence that
[34:41] whatever you give is going to go to the
[34:43] orphans orphans or going to the Elder Le
[34:46] or sick so they're I'm I'm I'm confident
[34:49] so knowing that they will do what
[34:51] you you ask them to do or whatever the
[34:54] need is usually it's before I go there
[34:57] they can send me through WhatsApp a list
[34:59] of items or anything they have need of I
[35:02] said hey we have people that are sick uh
[35:05] and we cannot afford the hospitalization
[35:07] would you be able to help we have need
[35:09] of this and that and then with that in
[35:11] mind before I go I know what to provide
[35:14] for them and then we organize it
[35:15] whatever we find on the spot there so
[35:19] was there having so this the one sitting
[35:21] down I know knew her 5 years ago she was
[35:24] probably 14 now she's no maybe 13 she's
[35:30] 18 and then she's helping with our other
[35:33] orphans as well she's an
[35:35] orphan who is there going to school but
[35:38] she's willing to stay in the orphanage
[35:40] to take care of other orphans as she
[35:43] remember how she she used to be so
[35:46] talking to my friends the uh the nons
[35:49] there so mostly sharing the word so
[35:53] usually they have a habit when the kids
[35:55] are together before they eat the they
[35:58] pray they're Catholic prayer but when I
[36:00] come there always ask me to pray and I
[36:04] pray the way we do pray and they see the
[36:06] difference and said what is the
[36:08] difference between our God and your
[36:11] God now it's a long the answer would be
[36:15] probably I don't know how to to start
[36:18] but somewhere the message gets across
[36:21] and they are they just want to learn
[36:23] more they don't want to be it in open
[36:25] for now but as I go there I just tell
[36:28] them about the message that uh God has
[36:31] sent us a prophet with the the
[36:33] Revelation that's taking the bride back
[36:36] uh to her
[36:38] groom okay that's still at the same
[36:41] place uh that was in kesta and
[36:45] on Wednesday Thursday I did uh fly out
[36:50] to the east side of GMA so where GMA is
[36:55] North outside of the
[36:58] north of north of it is Ronda another
[37:00] small country and south of it is
[37:04] um no North is uh Uganda you have Uganda
[37:10] North you have a Ronda and then you have
[37:12] a Burundi there are three countries that
[37:15] are there so uh where brother Abraham is
[37:18] northeast of the Congo
[37:20] there and so this is I didn't plan to go
[37:24] and stay in this hotel it's festar Hotel
[37:29] there's a friend of mine a family friend
[37:32] who learned that every time I go to the
[37:35] cono he heard that I usually go there he
[37:37] said what is he coming what is he doing
[37:40] he when he comes from the USA here so
[37:42] some friends said he he comes either to
[37:47] preach the word or to go help the needy
[37:50] so he was moved he said okay since he's
[37:53] doing that I'm going to be surprising
[37:55] him I want to put him in the best Hotel
[37:58] wherever he's going to be going to to
[38:00] the east so he texted me and I said he
[38:04] said hey where you when are you headed
[38:06] to the east I said I'm going to the east
[38:08] this uh this this morning otherwise
[38:11] afternoon and then he said okay I I'll
[38:14] text you back in a couple of minutes so
[38:16] in a few minutes maybe 10 or 15 minutes
[38:19] he texted me he said he has uh one of
[38:22] his he's overseeing the entire country
[38:24] probably under Secretary of State and or
[38:28] something like that no secretary in of
[38:31] mining so he got
[38:34] the the head of mining in the entire uh
[38:38] province of uh of north of gomma to come
[38:42] and pick me up at the airport and take
[38:45] me to this hotel without without any
[38:49] dispute so brothers were coming to pick
[38:52] me up uh there was a pastoring brother
[38:54] in the GMA so they came also but but the
[38:57] guy wanted me just to be picked up by
[38:59] his so we're following um uh going our
[39:05] the car we had two cars headed back to
[39:08] the to the hotel room so that's where I
[39:10] stayed there so it's a nice place uh to
[39:13] rest I didn't so as brother Shad you
[39:16] said that uh this is the cheapest hotel
[39:18] I ever stayed in brother 0
[39:22] paid was
[39:24] $225 per night
[39:27] and uh
[39:28] wellfed anything so that's from my uh my
[39:33] uh my the window from my room there so
[39:37] looking at the at the at the the the
[39:41] it's um it's a lake the lake that's
[39:44] separating the three
[39:45] countries uh that was on Friday night uh
[39:49] this I got it on probably Friday
[39:51] Saturday morning and then Sunday we had
[39:54] to speak uh in GMA with G Tabernacle so
[39:59] we had a a translator
[40:02] there and then on
[40:06] um Monday Monday we drove from the the
[40:12] place uh the church was 15 or 20 minutes
[40:15] from the
[40:16] hotel we drove probably about an hour to
[40:20] go far into the mountains
[40:23] so I don't know how to explain it big
[40:27] companies uh tech companies like uh
[40:30] Samsung apples those big uh
[40:33] manufacturing companies when they uh are
[40:38] acquiring whatever products they need to
[40:41] make their devices maybe Cobalt
[40:45] maybe lithium I don't know those are
[40:48] minerals so they are dealing with some
[40:51] companies within Africa within Europe
[40:54] instead of them going on the open market
[40:57] maybe the company um markets for the the
[41:00] government to purchase the minerals they
[41:02] don't do that what they do they
[41:05] are um I think they are giving money to
[41:11] militia from neighboring countries
[41:14] people that probably never went to
[41:15] school and they are going to
[41:18] terrorize people that are living in the
[41:21] East uh of GMA mostly poor people
[41:25] farmers in their uh KCK them out of
[41:27] their places because they want to get
[41:29] that by uh by force with guns drugs so
[41:35] in the Congo you have in the Eastern
[41:37] side of the GMA where we went there was
[41:39] about 1.5 million uh people that were
[41:43] displaced from their homes and among
[41:46] those we have hundreds of Believers
[41:49] message Believers so we went to visit
[41:52] those uh hundreds of message Believers
[41:54] in the camps so you will see that's the
[41:57] the place they
[41:58] are staying away from their homes
[42:01] they've been there probably more than uh
[42:03] 16 months and they don't know how long
[42:05] they were going to be there because the
[42:07] government is very slow to fight back
[42:10] those militias as they are spread out so
[42:13] this is a little video of um the place
[42:16] we
[42:17] went how poor they are and we have
[42:21] brothers and sisters that live in those
[42:24] conditions there
[42:29] this was the smallest site probably
[42:31] about 4 400,000 in the area but there
[42:35] was a bigger one which has probably
[42:36] 8,000 800,000 so I'm standing there with
[42:40] a yellow t-shirt Lu see kids are
[42:45] there and uh so to see how poor it is
[42:50] this is one of the churches message
[42:52] churches that brothers and sisters are
[42:56] attending those in the camps displaced
[42:59] from their homes from their livelihoods
[43:03] so they are there CH I think Tuesday
[43:06] Thursday Saturday and Sunday to have
[43:09] services in those places there the
[43:12] picture makes it look better look nicer
[43:16] outside and so we're able to go inside
[43:19] the
[43:20] church so those are that's not a tin
[43:22] roof it's they just put some little
[43:25] tents cloth anything if it's raining so
[43:29] that's the inside the sort the church
[43:31] there so we're able to meet the pastor
[43:35] the the deacons and uh some standing
[43:38] there with the pastor on my U on my left
[43:42] there and one of the deacons talking
[43:45] they don't even have sufficient benches
[43:48] for people to sit in so where we
[43:50] standing there it's in the TR trenches
[43:53] when it's raining so they made a way so
[43:56] maybe on Sunday morning it's raining
[43:58] they have to sit to one side so the
[44:00] water could uh could make its way there
[44:02] through the middle so we did uh with uh
[44:06] the love offering you gave to the first
[44:08] church here that we built we still had
[44:11] some remaining funds that we're going to
[44:13] be helping them to get the roof in the
[44:16] meantime to get the the seting benches
[44:19] and whatever is remaining we're going to
[44:21] see what we're going to do cuz they're
[44:22] not going to be there for a long time we
[44:24] don't know how many months but at least
[44:26] so they can have a place where they're
[44:29] not getting uh wet when it's raining or
[44:32] when it's anything so so that's the
[44:35] place we we visited so very very
[44:38] heartbreaking when you go to those
[44:40] places so I have U the pastor two
[44:44] pastors there and uh two
[44:47] deacons yeah very very very nice people
[44:54] and very respectful of the message and
[44:56] the love of the message with all their
[44:58] hearts and when we visit them like this
[45:00] they're asking how did you even know
[45:02] that we're here said God has children
[45:05] that uh know he knows how to make his
[45:10] way to find you yeah and then we came
[45:13] back on uh so this is can remember this
[45:18] day I might have skipped the day so
[45:20] arrived on Friday preached on uh no on
[45:25] on Thursday preached on Friday Saturday
[45:28] Went to went to the place and this is on
[45:30] Sunday yeah this is Sunday same
[45:34] place and then with our translator there
[45:38] uh that's uh the the church place it's
[45:42] still has a have needs but at least they
[45:45] are able to have a roof over the top of
[45:47] them and have seting places which is
[45:51] good so that's uh thank you during the
[45:55] service so we had a wonderful time with
[45:59] uh the open
[46:01] book yeah and then this is after the
[46:05] service so the sisters on one side
[46:07] getting
[46:08] out and this is uh Brothers uh getting
[46:12] out twoo and some sisters also after the
[46:15] service there because when I go to the
[46:19] Congo um should see me sometimes I go
[46:21] with seven suitcases sometimes eight so
[46:25] it depends how many I I would have maybe
[46:27] cloth clothing maybe um wheelchairs
[46:31] folded wheelchairs to help those that
[46:34] are in need so anything we we take there
[46:37] but and then after the service just for
[46:40] uh some of our brothers and sisters here
[46:43] that uh are probably sending their
[46:45] clothing I said okay let me get some
[46:48] couple of pictures just to show that
[46:50] they arrived so after the service we we
[46:54] regrouped some of the sisters on one
[46:56] area or some brothers and that's uh when
[47:00] we're uh handing out some uh some the
[47:02] clothing for those that are needy they
[47:04] don't have uh maybe mostly our widows
[47:08] don't have a a working husband so
[47:11] they're by their own as we give them if
[47:14] some money there we provide them for the
[47:16] provisions as well just to be able to
[47:19] share share something so charitable work
[47:23] so and they're very grateful for that so
[47:28] excuse me if you see me holding up a a
[47:30] dress or a skirt it's just to make sure
[47:32] hey it arrived but so this this these
[47:36] are just the samples of uh some
[47:40] places I know
[47:45] um that's a
[47:47] seabold little little cloth there so
[47:50] they arrived
[47:52] brother okay so some places
[47:58] yeah that's a brother just just had a
[48:00] baby and did have means to get the
[48:02] clothing but you know what some sisters
[48:06] here Who provided for the clothing yeah
[48:08] for the baby so these are some of them
[48:10] uh a few of them on that Sunday but the
[48:13] remaining we sent to some other churches
[48:15] according to the needs so they would get
[48:18] and uh we would check with the deacons
[48:20] or um the pastors of those places
[48:23] whatever need they have the L we have we
[48:27] just share it cuz we might leave it
[48:31] anytime anytime any minute who who knows
[48:34] or tomorrow we'll be here so all right
[48:37] so that's what we do and then the
[48:39] following day I did go visit um another
[48:43] an orphan orphanage again in the East
[48:46] it's uh just heartbreaking little
[48:48] stories there that we would not even
[48:50] have time to share here a lot of uh
[48:54] heartbreaking moments so kids would
[48:57] just come there would visit them and
[49:00] just after we play we eat and then just
[49:04] sharing word to them that uh they will
[49:08] know that God still cares for them yeah
[49:12] so they're sitting there this place I
[49:14] think they have 40 there's another place
[49:16] they had probably 72 I don't have the
[49:19] pictures here but I did visit at least a
[49:21] couple of orphanages there and
[49:24] uh so and visit that t some pictures and
[49:28] went on one of the
[49:29] orphanages um and the place they were
[49:33] sleeping so I it doesn't even look like
[49:36] a little bedroom there the beds the
[49:38] sleeping on the so we decided I'm
[49:41] already we are with a little funds from
[49:44] the charity we're providing some
[49:46] beddings and some mattresses so and then
[49:48] we're going to be um painting the place
[49:50] and just making a place little livable
[49:53] for
[49:54] them and then that was I think on either
[49:59] Sunday evening or Monday evening and
[50:01] then we went
[50:04] the the displaced of War those brothers
[50:07] and sisters who could not give them
[50:09] provisions on the site because it would
[50:12] create a stamped situation cuz people
[50:15] that are hungry there that don't have
[50:17] any means that will be rushing probably
[50:19] to ask for you to give them also and if
[50:23] there come probably 177,000 at once
[50:27] we cannot could not afford for 177,000
[50:29] we had probably means uh provision for
[50:32] almost 300 so what we did the brother
[50:35] the Pastor said please let us uh he will
[50:38] tell his
[50:40] congregation 300 plus people to walk
[50:43] maybe one mile away of the big Camp to
[50:48] meet somewhere and there you don't even
[50:50] give them Provisions because once they
[50:52] realize that they're bringing provision
[50:54] from somewhere people will be rushing
[50:56] there it's just incidents so he advised
[50:59] me to give them U just money in the
[51:02] envelopes that they would be go back to
[51:04] the camps sneaking in the camps and
[51:07] whenever they have a need they can go
[51:08] purchase on their own so that's what we
[51:11] did uh the following this place so we're
[51:14] handing out it's something to the
[51:18] families according to the needs some
[51:20] they were sick some they had issues we
[51:23] had listed them worked with the the
[51:27] the the pastor and the the deacons and
[51:30] and other members of the church just to
[51:32] accommodate for those that were very
[51:33] needy to give more so this is what we've
[51:37] been doing there it was a daunting task
[51:39] so we have to hand out almost 317 or
[51:42] something like that I can't remember the
[51:43] number yeah but uh those are beloved
[51:47] brothers and sisters they're keeping up
[51:50] the light of the message even in the
[51:53] worst of the
[51:54] situation yeah
[51:59] some other plac I were just looking at
[52:00] them just weeping but God knows he said
[52:04] he put them there for a reason he put us
[52:07] here for a reason so it's not something
[52:09] that is outside of his boundaries he
[52:12] knows exactly what he's doing and his
[52:14] doings are perfect but we just uh
[52:19] sharing with them there so got some
[52:22] sisters waiting mostly most of them were
[52:25] widows their hus husbands were killed
[52:27] maybe in wars and then they they would
[52:30] come up and we would uh would share
[52:32] something and we did speak also after
[52:35] that just little exaltation to each and
[52:38] for the families and they were they were
[52:40] were all
[52:42] blessed I'm standing with a a sister
[52:45] there I think she was in the hospital so
[52:49] went to went to redeem her also she
[52:53] cannot see and she cannot hear but we
[52:56] wanted to her to be there as we were
[52:59] speaking to her I said just come and sit
[53:00] on my side on my side so she was there
[53:03] there was a sister who was caring for
[53:05] her so it seems like she lost her
[53:07] hearing with when they were move they
[53:09] were moved out their their homes and uh
[53:12] she had some infection and she couldn't
[53:14] hear and she cannot see
[53:17] either so we have a few of those that
[53:20] remaining after that they had showing up
[53:22] their envelopes with uh some love
[53:25] offerings
[53:26] can
[53:27] go um probably
[53:31] just provide for themselves maybe for
[53:34] couple weeks maybe for a month of
[53:42] Provisions
[53:44] then then I flew back to kesta and then
[53:48] U uh rested for one day and Thursday
[53:52] flew back to to the us so we decided we
[53:55] had to I just want to show that we had
[53:58] two churches that for which we're
[54:01] providing for their needs this is the
[54:03] one so we are in the process for
[54:06] providing for this one little roof we
[54:08] can provide and whatever we could uh
[54:11] there and I will be keeping you up to
[54:13] date since it's a temporary we don't
[54:16] want to do something very big so um if
[54:19] they might go home we don't know how
[54:20] many how many months they're going to be
[54:22] there and then there's another little
[54:24] church in the kinas it's a open they
[54:26] just built a wall I don't know why they
[54:28] start with walls and they have uh uh
[54:31] pews and they even missing some we went
[54:34] there and most people were just standing
[54:35] up listening to the
[54:37] service so we have those two churches
[54:40] that we are going to be uh I'm just
[54:42] working with them to see uh what we can
[54:45] do with a little Charity with the
[54:47] remaining of the funds just to help them
[54:51] God bless you thanks for your your
[54:53] giving thanks for your prayers your love
[54:57] and support so those places we just feel
[55:00] led to go cuz there might be someone
[55:03] that never heard this message the the
[55:05] thing is in the Congo which is different
[55:08] from here you can go to a place you
[55:10] start sharing the gospel you can call
[55:12] somebody off the road do you have time
[55:15] to listen to me they can give you at
[55:17] least maybe three 3 minutes of their
[55:18] time they're not rushing like in here
[55:21] and you can even share and somebody
[55:22] would be thinking you know what I want
[55:24] to take your cont
[55:27] where where are you what is it about you
[55:29] can give him a reference go there's a
[55:31] church in the area go meet that that
[55:34] brother that Pastor and then so there is
[55:38] still an open field for uh
[55:43] evangelizing that's uh that's the the
[55:45] benefit the good side there they are
[55:47] humble people and uh we we are so
[55:51] fortunate that you are behind it and
[55:54] supporting with uh your prayers and your
[55:57] love and uh God bless you God bless you

[56:12] uh okay I got both of them thank
[56:17] you all right let's go we going to be
[56:20] taking a little thought here it's uh
[56:23] it's in a bit what I had Pro prepared
[56:27] seems like the Lord didn't allow me to
[56:29] to bring it but this morning he was I
[56:32] was just reading the Bible he just led
[56:33] me to some scriptures and I just want to
[56:37] us together looking into that as a as a
[56:40] little B Bible study here I know the
[56:42] Lord will use our pastor to shove it in
[56:47] I know yeah where I'm going to be
[56:49] limited God knows how to feed us and
[56:51] he's been doing it he's so faithful and
[56:54] he has he has an instrument here that uh
[56:58] whatever need I have he feeds me he
[57:01] provides for me and I know he does for
[57:03] you too I can say like David my heart is
[57:08] fixed our hearts are fixed here the word
[57:12] that he's providing for us
[57:15] here every time he meets our needs and
[57:19] he does more more than we can even
[57:21] anticipate yeah God bless you let's read
[57:24] it's going to be in the
[57:26] uh Genesis uh
[57:29] 22 Genesis chapter
[57:32] 22 we're going to be starting at verse
[57:35] one let me check the
[57:38] time I'm mindful of the time so 30
[57:42] minutes or even less we should would be
[57:46] fine and it it
[57:50] goes and it came to pass after these
[57:54] things
[57:56] now these things are many things that
[57:59] happened prior to this moment here those
[58:03] things are when God spoke to
[58:06] Abraham when God showed him Visions when
[58:10] God came and visited
[58:12] Sarah when Abraham uh when he had a
[58:15] covenant with Abram just many things but
[58:19] then he
[58:20] goes and it came to pass after these
[58:23] things that God did tempt Abraham
[58:26] and said unto him Abraham and he said
[58:29] behold Here I Am the prophet of God said
[58:32] God doesn't does not tempt he tested
[58:36] Abraham and he said take now thy son thy
[58:40] own thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[58:45] and get thee into the land of
[58:48] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[58:52] offering upon one of the mountains which
[58:55] I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up
[58:59] early in the morning and saddled saddled
[59:03] his ass and took two of his young men
[59:06] with him and and Isaac his son and clave
[59:10] the wood for the burnt offering and Rose
[59:12] up and went unto the place of which God
[59:16] has told him then on the third day
[59:20] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[59:23] place a far off and Abraham said unto
[59:27] his young man abide ye here with the ass
[59:31] and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[59:35] worship and come again to you let's have
[59:39] a word of prayer again precious Lord we
[59:43] just transitioning now from the report
[59:45] and father coming to the most crucial
[59:49] time lord of the day to know Lord read
[59:54] your word and hear from you would you
[59:56] come and in interpret your word father
[59:59] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may
[1:00:02] be seated I take a little thought
[1:00:06] here it's
[1:00:08] uh when Abraham's time to worship
[1:00:15] came it's
[1:00:17] uh I know
[1:00:19] that God changed AB Abram's
[1:00:23] name I know he when he was 75 years
[1:00:26] years old God met him God gave him a
[1:00:29] promise and then God worked with him
[1:00:32] through the the length of the the last
[1:00:35] the 25 of his life from the 75 when he
[1:00:37] was 100 experiences upon
[1:00:41] experiences in Genesis 17 that's when
[1:00:45] God renews his Covenant with Abraham by
[1:00:49] changing his
[1:00:53] name from Abram to
[1:00:57] Abraham and the prophet of God said this
[1:01:00] in uh in the message Abraham's
[1:01:02] Covenant confirmed preached in uh 1961
[1:01:07] February 1061 he said and now we find
[1:01:11] out last night that it was
[1:01:14] Abram until God blessed him and made a
[1:01:19] covenant with him and then he changed
[1:01:23] his name from Abram to
[1:01:27] Abraham and ham was part of God's
[1:01:33] name did you notice that did it ever
[1:01:37] soak down in that's the prophet of God
[1:01:40] asking this now I'm saying what has to
[1:01:43] soak down in now about the name change
[1:01:47] he said
[1:01:50] Abram
[1:01:53] Elohim see he put part of God's name
[1:01:58] because God is a father of all and he
[1:02:02] made his name being
[1:02:06] Elohim God put part of his name with
[1:02:12] Abram see and made him a partner with
[1:02:17] him amen so that name God by renewing
[1:02:21] his Covenant with Abra
[1:02:24] Abram by changing his name from Abraham
[1:02:28] a from Abram to
[1:02:31] Abraham God did not openly tell
[1:02:35] Abraham what was
[1:02:37] happening Abram himself his name being
[1:02:41] changed to Abraham was to find out what
[1:02:44] was the meaning of that name of
[1:02:48] Abraham meaning God by giving him that
[1:02:51] name changing his name he was putting
[1:02:55] Abram into partnership with him
[1:03:00] amen gave him a blank check the prophet
[1:03:04] of God said he gave Abram a blank
[1:03:09] check now Abraham had to learn how to
[1:03:12] fill it
[1:03:15] out in the Abram's Covenant now preached
[1:03:20] in in MA in in March of
[1:03:23] 61 the prophet of God said that when he
[1:03:26] gave Abraham part of his
[1:03:31] name listen to that
[1:03:36] positionally he put his name on the
[1:03:42] check the same as he
[1:03:47] was so
[1:03:49] positionally God put Abra Abram's name
[1:03:53] on the check
[1:03:55] the same as God
[1:04:01] was Abraham had I'm let's go time is
[1:04:05] flying by let's go Abram had to find out
[1:04:08] later on that he
[1:04:11] was the body that Elohim lived
[1:04:16] in but he has to find it
[1:04:20] out he is Elohim that's the prophet of
[1:04:25] God saying
[1:04:28] Abram he said Abraham Elohim now he's
[1:04:33] saying he is Elohim Abram Abraham see
[1:04:39] gave him part of his own
[1:04:42] name a great Revelation there and you
[1:04:47] realize I could run that farther than
[1:04:50] that but the
[1:04:53] church now his taking Abraham coming
[1:04:57] bringing that to the church yes sir
[1:05:00] don't leave it up there 600 or 4,000 or
[1:05:03] 5,000 years ago with Abram now it's the
[1:05:06] church he says but the church when it
[1:05:09] ought to be taking strong
[1:05:13] meat is still drinking milk Abraham was
[1:05:18] doing the very same thing the name had
[1:05:21] been given changed Jehovah has given him
[1:05:25] his name nature he has brought Abram
[1:05:28] into partnership with
[1:05:31] him but Abraham was still drinking
[1:05:36] milk right so he gave his own name
[1:05:44] Abram and then when he did that the next
[1:05:47] thing he did after he gave him that name
[1:05:50] place that on his name then what did he
[1:05:54] do he he gave him a
[1:05:57] sign that he was
[1:06:00] ready to absolutely destroy all sin that
[1:06:05] was around
[1:06:07] him listen to the daunting task that
[1:06:10] Abraham
[1:06:11] had to be fully positioned in this
[1:06:16] partnership with God Abram had to grow
[1:06:20] from milk to
[1:06:23] meat and go Abram had to to do
[1:06:26] that and then he was ready God was made
[1:06:32] him ready to
[1:06:34] destroy all sin that was around him God
[1:06:40] was not going to destroy sin around
[1:06:42] Abram Abraham himself had the potential
[1:06:47] because his name was on the blank
[1:06:51] check Elohim Abraham
[1:06:55] Abraham Elohim so Abraham was to
[1:07:01] destroy all sin because he was the
[1:07:04] father of Faith amen faith has one
[1:07:08] motive faith in our lives has been given
[1:07:12] to us to destroy all sin amen all
[1:07:17] unbelief Amen in our in
[1:07:22] ourselves and position
[1:07:26] he put his body in
[1:07:28] condition to receive the promised son
[1:07:32] that he had waited on exactly what he's
[1:07:36] done to the church
[1:07:39] prise
[1:07:41] praise what God gave to
[1:07:44] Abraham to Abram by changing his name to
[1:07:50] Abraham he has done it with you and I
[1:07:53] amen yes sir we do not realize what the
[1:07:56] name bride
[1:07:59] means
[1:08:01] praise the bride the name bride means we
[1:08:05] are in partnership with
[1:08:08] God and he has given you and
[1:08:12] me that ability that I don't know how to
[1:08:16] call it the the power to destroy all
[1:08:20] sins that are surrounding
[1:08:22] us you will find out that after his name
[1:08:25] was changed in Genesis
[1:08:28] 17 in Genesis
[1:08:31] 18 we see the two god with two angels
[1:08:35] visiting
[1:08:36] Abraham after he has already changed his
[1:08:41] name and when he
[1:08:43] came to
[1:08:46] Abraham his wife his bride
[1:08:50] doubted and even denied her thoughts
[1:08:53] when uh God said that that she's behind
[1:08:57] me so the bride was the feminine form of
[1:09:06] Abraham though the masculine form of
[1:09:09] Abraham was higher in faith the feminine
[1:09:14] was still L lagging
[1:09:17] behind drinking
[1:09:20] milk in Genesis 19 I'm just going fast
[1:09:24] skipping some of lines
[1:09:27] here two angels visited lot in Genesis
[1:09:31] 19 to
[1:09:32] Sodom and God spared the life of lot by
[1:09:37] remembering
[1:09:39] Abraham the Bible said he did it in
[1:09:42] remembrance of Abraham that's how he
[1:09:44] saved the lot so meaning that I'm in
[1:09:48] partnership with him I cannot touch lot
[1:09:53] God even respected that Covenant amen
[1:09:56] because it meant so much to him in
[1:09:59] Genesis
[1:10:00] 19 so little Abraham realized that one
[1:10:05] of that one was one of the
[1:10:08] attributes of his new
[1:10:10] name to intercede for others so he was
[1:10:14] one of the attributes so that name was
[1:10:17] so big great that Abraham day by day had
[1:10:22] to he had to ponder
[1:10:25] what is entitled in this
[1:10:28] name within that name the intercession
[1:10:31] was in that name within that
[1:10:34] name Faith was there the the power to
[1:10:37] destroy all sin was there in that
[1:10:40] name even Genesis
[1:10:44] 20 we see that
[1:10:46] Abraham having his name changed still
[1:10:51] had not fully realized the content of it
[1:10:55] that's right all the all the all the
[1:10:58] value of it the worth of it and he he
[1:11:01] went lying to the king ABC that's right
[1:11:05] still with the name
[1:11:06] Abraham in partnership with God he was
[1:11:09] still growing that's right drinking
[1:11:16] milk but as we we move on God wanted
[1:11:22] Abraham to realize
[1:11:26] what was entitled in that name as we see
[1:11:30] that in Genesis 22 when we come to
[1:11:32] Genesis
[1:11:33] 22 if we flip back Genesis
[1:11:38] 21 TW uh um 21 verse 33 one of the those
[1:11:44] things it says and Abraham planted a
[1:11:48] Grove in bers Bersa and called there on
[1:11:52] the name of the Lord the Everlasting God
[1:11:55] and Abraham surgeon in the Philistines
[1:11:58] land many days although he had the name
[1:12:04] but he had not the full understanding of
[1:12:07] what that name means he even in 33: 33
[1:12:12] he even called the name there when he he
[1:12:16] he had a covenant with the King aimc he
[1:12:19] was still dwelling in the Philistines
[1:12:22] land instead of being in his own land
[1:12:26] God had to teach him God had to let him
[1:12:31] grow to be able to come to understand
[1:12:35] that he had in
[1:12:38] himself the power to destroy all sin
[1:12:42] that was surrounding
[1:12:46] himself probably will may make it more
[1:12:51] clear Genesis
[1:12:53] 22 that's where
[1:12:57] God knew
[1:12:59] that God knew already that this is the
[1:13:03] time that Abraham is going to be selling
[1:13:05] himself completely out he's going to be
[1:13:09] understand the full extense of his name
[1:13:11] and then he's testing
[1:13:13] him and the testing came the testing was
[1:13:17] to offer him
[1:13:21] life Abraham's life didn't even mean too
[1:13:23] much but the life of Isaac it was the
[1:13:28] very Offspring The Very continuity of
[1:13:32] Abraham he was more valuable than Abram
[1:13:35] himself right now God is saying give me
[1:13:38] the very best that you got right offer
[1:13:41] it to
[1:13:42] me and as Abraham is going
[1:13:46] now 3 days journey I like how the
[1:13:48] prophet of God said that any man can
[1:13:51] walk between 15 20 or 25 miles per day
[1:13:54] he said that Abraham went for 3 Days
[1:13:57] walking to go to the mountain that uh
[1:14:00] where God showed him in a vision he said
[1:14:03] after he arrived there almost 75 miles
[1:14:06] he had walked God is showing him the
[1:14:08] mountain far off the prophet of God said
[1:14:10] maybe another 50 m off so he was over
[1:14:14] 100 miles off the
[1:14:16] civilization and during the three
[1:14:20] days something was happening in
[1:14:24] Abraham during the 3 days there was
[1:14:27] surely a confession in Abraham right
[1:14:29] that God I have not lived up to this
[1:14:32] name but now I have to completely sell
[1:14:35] out he sold completely out and he was
[1:14:39] willing willing to offer the very
[1:14:44] Offspring The Very life the very promise
[1:14:47] God said give me the only son you
[1:14:51] love he specified that the only son that
[1:14:54] you love which was
[1:14:58] Isaac and as Abraham is as um Genesis
[1:15:03] 225 is is going and Abraham said unto
[1:15:05] his young man abide ye here with the the
[1:15:09] ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:15:14] worship and come again to
[1:15:18] you all these years that God dealt with
[1:15:22] Abraham Abraham had might have had many
[1:15:26] experiences many
[1:15:29] shouting many
[1:15:31] singing but he never
[1:15:34] worshiped because worship required more
[1:15:38] than only
[1:15:40] singing required more than only shouting
[1:15:44] worship is always proceeded by offering
[1:15:50] the very
[1:15:53] best because
[1:15:55] we will find out that
[1:15:57] worship connects us back to our
[1:16:04] origin worship connects us back to our
[1:16:10] origin the prophet of God says we can
[1:16:14] even read it in the in um Genesis
[1:16:17] 4 about Cain and Abel the prophet of God
[1:16:21] is speaking about Cain and Abel he said
[1:16:23] they've been living for how many years a
[1:16:26] long
[1:16:27] time one was a tailer of the ground one
[1:16:30] was a
[1:16:31] shepherd and in the process of time they
[1:16:35] realized that they were
[1:16:39] dying now they wanted to find
[1:16:44] life they know that the east side was
[1:16:47] blocked by the
[1:16:49] cherubs they wanted to find
[1:16:52] life and then they decided to stop all
[1:16:55] that they were
[1:16:57] doing the tailor stopped the shepherd
[1:17:00] stopped now what should we do we need to
[1:17:03] find our origin we need to find life
[1:17:07] back because we're dying we're growing
[1:17:12] old can we connect back to the source of
[1:17:16] life and the prophet of God says this in
[1:17:19] the Victory
[1:17:21] Day preaching 1963
[1:17:25] he said seeing that the two boys are
[1:17:28] trying to find favor with
[1:17:31] God to come back they wanted to come
[1:17:36] back to life they knew that they has
[1:17:39] stepped away death was setting
[1:17:42] in what was the how could we come back
[1:17:46] to life they wanted to come back they
[1:17:50] want to find the source they want to
[1:17:52] connect back to the source of life and
[1:17:55] the prophet says because they know that
[1:17:58] they were just fresh from The Garden of
[1:18:00] Life and they had they had fell on the
[1:18:03] other side by the transgression of their
[1:18:06] parents had made them subject to
[1:18:10] death just like we all stand this
[1:18:13] morning subjects to death and they
[1:18:17] wanted to know how to get
[1:18:20] back into that place where they could
[1:18:23] find life
[1:18:27] again that's the very first motive for
[1:18:33] the first two beings two sons on Earth
[1:18:36] Cain and Abel to find a way to worship
[1:18:40] when they went to Worship in reality
[1:18:44] they wanted to connect back to life they
[1:18:47] wanted to go back to find life again the
[1:18:53] prophet of God says this in the in in
[1:18:55] the glorified Jesus in 1955 he said now
[1:18:59] Cain I don't believe that Cain willfully
[1:19:02] walked out there and got the fruits of
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:09] fields works of of his hands and brought
[1:19:12] it over because he just absolutely
[1:19:15] wanted to do it to do it to be a smart
[1:19:19] alec Prophet didn't think he did that he
[1:19:23] said I believe Cain
[1:19:25] came with a full
[1:19:27] heart thinking he was doing
[1:19:31] right why was he trying to find favor
[1:19:35] with
[1:19:37] God
[1:19:38] worship is finding favor with
[1:19:43] God connecting back to your
[1:19:46] origin they wanted to connect back to
[1:19:49] life because death was setting in what
[1:19:52] was the way for us to connected back to
[1:19:55] God then let's worship let's find out
[1:20:01] God he was trying to find life again
[1:20:06] Cain he was trying to get back to the
[1:20:09] Garden of Eden again where the Cherub
[1:20:12] cherubims
[1:20:14] was I imagine they went to the east side
[1:20:18] where the cheram was guarding the Tree
[1:20:20] of Life they were trying to get back
[1:20:25] back the prophet of God is
[1:20:27] insisting they were trying to get back
[1:20:31] that's when you find the worship worship
[1:20:34] is when you are reconnecting back to
[1:20:37] your
[1:20:39] origin they were trying to get back and
[1:20:43] a man with the destination of his soul
[1:20:46] hanging in the
[1:20:47] balance he ain't going up there to play
[1:20:51] church that's right he's going up there
[1:20:54] to
[1:20:57] worship and with all his heart Cain said
[1:21:00] I believe there is a God and I'm coming
[1:21:03] to find favor with him the whole motive
[1:21:07] of Cain coming to worship both Abel and
[1:21:11] K coming to worship was to find life
[1:21:15] again was to connect back to where they
[1:21:19] were been run from
[1:21:24] and so he goes the prophet of God shows
[1:21:27] us the steps in in a worship Cain is
[1:21:31] going to be applying exactly the process
[1:21:35] in every worship that are required in
[1:21:37] every worship but he's doing it with
[1:21:40] without the Revelation from God he got
[1:21:43] all the mechanics correctly and listen
[1:21:45] to the
[1:21:46] mechanic the prophet of God
[1:21:49] says so he goes and gets the fruits of
[1:21:52] the field
[1:21:55] worship always requires an offering you
[1:21:59] cannot worship without
[1:22:02] offering that's the reason the prophet
[1:22:04] of God said worship uh giving is a
[1:22:08] central part of our
[1:22:12] worship he said so he goes and gets the
[1:22:15] fruits of the fields that he had raised
[1:22:18] and brought them up and laid them
[1:22:22] down that was his offering he was
[1:22:25] bringing perhaps uh put big CA lies and
[1:22:29] beautiful flowers around and stepped
[1:22:31] back oh we could have something to say
[1:22:34] here of that nature like that but he
[1:22:37] stepped back knelt down and raised raise
[1:22:40] up his
[1:22:42] hands Cain is after bringing his
[1:22:45] offering he's going to be confessing he
[1:22:48] knew the
[1:22:50] process in to come to a complete worship
[1:22:54] that after I bring my offering I have to
[1:22:58] confess Cain confessed his
[1:23:03] wrong but he did it without the
[1:23:08] Revelation with the knowledge he
[1:23:11] had he was following the mechanical
[1:23:16] steps that were required in
[1:23:19] worship he confessed his wrong first he
[1:23:22] brought his offering the fruits
[1:23:25] then he confessed his
[1:23:27] wrong and worshiped
[1:23:30] Jehovah he knew that I have to do these
[1:23:33] two things first before I can worship to
[1:23:36] complete my worship I have to bring an
[1:23:39] offering I have to confess can did
[1:23:43] those when sometimes us messy Believers
[1:23:47] we have hard time to
[1:23:49] confess how about even bringing an
[1:23:51] offering
[1:23:56] even being regular in
[1:23:58] tithing but Cain knew better and did
[1:24:04] it but Jehovah shook his head and said
[1:24:09] no because he did it his own way the
[1:24:12] mechanic was
[1:24:14] perfect but he did it his own
[1:24:17] way Abel did the very same thing but he
[1:24:21] had the Revelation he brought what was
[1:24:23] required
[1:24:29] and the prophet of God said
[1:24:32] that Cain in the same message Cain
[1:24:35] offered a beautiful sacrifice of flowers
[1:24:38] and fruits of the field or whatever it
[1:24:40] was he put on the was he put on the
[1:24:42] altar but Able by spiritual
[1:24:48] Revelation revealed to him that he was
[1:24:51] not the fruit he had to bring something
[1:24:53] to an offering and God knew that he has
[1:24:56] to bring something to complete his
[1:24:58] worship he gave him the Revelation to
[1:25:02] pick up the right
[1:25:06] offering it was the
[1:25:10] blood that caused the death so he
[1:25:13] offered back blood and of an innocent
[1:25:18] substitute and God God accepted it we're
[1:25:22] looking at uh time is a looking at The
[1:25:26] Prodigal Son can just take take one
[1:25:30] example in Luke 15 we can read it
[1:25:33] together if you want or I can read it
[1:25:35] Luke
[1:25:38] 15 verse
[1:25:45] 11 now we know that the prodigal son had
[1:25:48] stepped
[1:25:49] away had cut his way off from the father
[1:25:56] now as he came to
[1:25:58] himself he also wanted to connect back
[1:26:02] to his
[1:26:04] father he knew that the way to connect
[1:26:07] back to my father is to worship I have
[1:26:10] to find My Worship my way back is a
[1:26:14] worship so Luke 15:11 said and he said a
[1:26:18] certain man had two sons and the younger
[1:26:21] of them said to his father father give
[1:26:23] me the portion of goods that uh fth to
[1:26:26] me and he divided unto them his living
[1:26:30] and not many days after the younger son
[1:26:32] gathered all together and took his young
[1:26:34] journey into a far country and there
[1:26:37] wasted his substance with a righteous
[1:26:41] living and when he had spent all there
[1:26:44] arose a mighty famine in that land and
[1:26:47] he began to be in want and he went and
[1:26:50] joined himself to a citizen of that
[1:26:52] country and he sent him into his fields
[1:26:55] to feed
[1:26:57] sowing we can go back to 17 step down to
[1:27:01] 17 and when he came to
[1:27:04] himself this is when the Revelation is
[1:27:09] coming back to him because he was living
[1:27:12] in the dark world as we
[1:27:15] did there's only one thing that can
[1:27:17] bring life and light into our life
[1:27:20] that's the message the revelation of the
[1:27:22] hour he got the revelation of his hour
[1:27:25] and he came back to himself he said how
[1:27:29] many hired Servants of my father have
[1:27:32] bread enough to spare and I perish in
[1:27:35] hunger he was questioning after the
[1:27:38] Revelation struck him he came to himself
[1:27:41] now he's thinking the right
[1:27:45] thoughts there's only the revelation of
[1:27:47] your hour that can give you the right
[1:27:51] thoughts outside of the revelation you
[1:27:54] will not even know will never even come
[1:27:56] to
[1:28:00] yourself so he came to himself you will
[1:28:03] see him he's going to be processing
[1:28:07] using the same mechanism the same
[1:28:09] mechanics that was in
[1:28:11] Genesis he has he knew that for me to
[1:28:15] connect back to my
[1:28:18] father this is a worship I need to bring
[1:28:22] something I need to
[1:28:24] confess then I will find my worship then
[1:28:28] I will connect back to my
[1:28:31] father 17 says
[1:28:34] 18 he's prep preparing his offering
[1:28:38] now I I will arise and
[1:28:43] go to my
[1:28:46] father who is the offering here
[1:28:51] himself he didn't want to take anything
[1:28:55] he knew that this this
[1:28:57] worship this connection does not need
[1:29:00] any material
[1:29:02] thing it needs an offering a special
[1:29:06] offering amen because this offering is
[1:29:09] going to complete my worship I've been
[1:29:12] out cut off from Life cut off from my
[1:29:15] connection cut off from my source
[1:29:17] there's only one thing that I can bring
[1:29:21] into worship that will connect me back
[1:29:23] to the source
[1:29:26] I will arise and go I myself am that
[1:29:32] offering walking on two
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:36] feet to my father I'm not bringing flow
[1:29:41] fruits I'm not bringing flowers I am the
[1:29:44] very offering that's needed to complete
[1:29:48] this
[1:29:49] connection I'm the only offering that
[1:29:51] needs to reconnect back to go into
[1:29:54] worship and will say unto him father he
[1:30:00] doing can did it
[1:30:02] too I have sinned against heaven and
[1:30:06] before thee he's
[1:30:09] confessing
[1:30:11] right 19 and am no more
[1:30:16] worthy when he understood that he is no
[1:30:21] longer in the picture prise God he has
[1:30:23] no worth himself father what you say
[1:30:27] that's who I am whatever your word says
[1:30:30] that's what I will do Abraham had to
[1:30:33] learn that he did not know until Genesis
[1:30:37] 22 when he knew that God in this Abram
[1:30:41] name it's you doing I have no nothing to
[1:30:45] to hinder or to do whatever you say
[1:30:47] that's what I will do am remember that
[1:30:50] in Genesis 21 he was Grievous after
[1:30:54] Isaac was born and then Ishmael mocking
[1:30:58] Sarah Sarah said cast out the Bond woman
[1:31:01] and the the the son and his and her son
[1:31:05] Abram was Grievous it bothered him a
[1:31:08] lot although in partnership with God
[1:31:12] still some little thing was around him
[1:31:17] some doubt some
[1:31:19] resistance was still around Abraham but
[1:31:22] in Genesis 22 he had nothing holding him
[1:31:26] Genesis 22 he knew
[1:31:29] that this name it's not me in action
[1:31:33] it's God himself living his word in this
[1:31:37] body whatever he says that's what I
[1:31:41] do and then the The Prodigal Son came at
[1:31:45] the place that he knew that he was no
[1:31:49] longer to be in the picture
[1:31:54] true a true
[1:31:55] worship you and I are no longer in the
[1:32:00] picture it's the word of the father
[1:32:04] living out his own life in our
[1:32:09] being Genesis 22 it was Abraham
[1:32:13] completely not worthy that God your will
[1:32:18] is my
[1:32:20] will the prodigal son said and I'm no
[1:32:24] more worthy to be called the son make me
[1:32:27] as one of thy hired
[1:32:30] servant so that's where he found a true
[1:32:35] worship because he connected back to the
[1:32:37] father and what did the father do the
[1:32:41] father adopted
[1:32:42] him sir he adopted him that's
[1:32:47] rightall we could go
[1:32:50] into and the prophet of God says that
[1:32:53] even when the Magi the wise men when
[1:32:56] they went to they followed the
[1:32:59] star to see the young child
[1:33:02] born they went to worship him but before
[1:33:06] they could worship Him the Bible said
[1:33:08] that they came to worship and then they
[1:33:11] opened up the treasures amen a worship a
[1:33:15] true worship requires an offering a
[1:33:20] confession then you can find the
[1:33:22] connection back to the
[1:33:25] origin so to to complete our worship
[1:33:29] unto him we must be completely sold
[1:33:35] out to give him the best there is and I
[1:33:39] don't know any better than yourself and
[1:33:43] myself let us stand kids go to school
[1:33:51] tomorrow let me read this as we're
[1:33:53] standing up
[1:33:55] in the message behold the greater than
[1:33:57] Solomon is here preached
[1:34:01] 1962 the prophet of God says you all
[1:34:04] know the form of a pagan
[1:34:07] worship this is about worship now the
[1:34:10] prophet of God is going to be telling us
[1:34:12] how Pagan worship is being done and how
[1:34:17] God's worship is being
[1:34:19] proceeded he said so now a Pagan
[1:34:24] worship way they do they bring the idol
[1:34:28] and set it
[1:34:30] up and then they get a
[1:34:33] priest and they bless the
[1:34:36] candle and they put this candle before
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:41] idol his musicians might be coming and
[1:34:44] they bring him something to eat he's
[1:34:48] telling us how the the the Pagan are
[1:34:50] doing they bring an idol and set it up
[1:34:54] might be a statue and then they get a
[1:34:57] priest and they bless the candle they
[1:35:00] put this candle before the idol and they
[1:35:03] bring him something to eat there's Al
[1:35:06] always an offering there for a worship
[1:35:09] they bring him something to eat and eat
[1:35:13] communion with him and then they
[1:35:15] prostrate themselves before that Idol
[1:35:19] and just give in their mind in such a
[1:35:22] way till they believe believe that they
[1:35:25] can hear that Idol speak back to them
[1:35:28] they believe they're
[1:35:31] presuming that that they can hear the
[1:35:33] idol speak to them now that's Pagan idol
[1:35:39] worship now that's contrary to god let's
[1:35:44] listen to our
[1:35:45] worship Sons and Daughters of God's
[1:35:49] worship see God is not an
[1:35:52] idol God is a spirit and we prostrate
[1:35:57] ourselves before that and the spirit
[1:36:01] doesn't come into some Idol as so as
[1:36:05] some so-called Christians would have us
[1:36:07] to believe but the spirit comes into
[1:36:12] you and you are God's house living amen
[1:36:19] amen when the prodal son went back the
[1:36:23] very life the very will of the father
[1:36:26] was living in him
[1:36:29] amen he was the house of his own father
[1:36:34] his body the body of a prodigal son
[1:36:37] became the very House of the will of his
[1:36:41] father that's when he found the true
[1:36:43] worship
[1:36:45] amen so the prophet of God said and you
[1:36:47] are God's house
[1:36:49] living walking around manifesting the
[1:36:54] Living God for God dwells not in temples
[1:36:58] made with hands but a body has thou
[1:37:01] prepared me you are God's
[1:37:06] letter when you find your Worship in God
[1:37:11] you become his letter amen amen a
[1:37:16] written
[1:37:17] epistle God is in you manifesting
[1:37:22] himself through
[1:37:24] if you could prostrate yourself before
[1:37:26] God and say God I am a sinner God come
[1:37:30] into me and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:37:33] in and then you are a living
[1:37:37] Idol of God living representative of God
[1:37:41] walking around with God speaking through
[1:37:44] your
[1:37:45] lips to others the woman of the world
[1:37:49] had the same thing when Jesus met her
[1:37:52] the only thing
[1:37:54] after telling her that you have five
[1:37:57] husband the sixth one is not
[1:37:59] yours she said you are you are um a
[1:38:04] prophet but her question was she wanted
[1:38:08] to connect back to deity she had a a
[1:38:12] question on
[1:38:14] worship that's the reason Jesus came and
[1:38:16] asked her give me water yes Jesus wanted
[1:38:19] fresh water amen fresh water not
[1:38:22] denomination GED the very life the very
[1:38:26] body that he can express his world
[1:38:29] through amen and she gave that water at
[1:38:31] the end as the prophet of God said David
[1:38:34] wanted fresh water amen that was Christ
[1:38:38] Christ wants fresh water from you
[1:38:42] tonight find your Worship in him tonight
[1:38:46] and we can only do it by bringing him an
[1:38:50] offering what offering are you bringing

[1:44:55] than
[1:44:56] myself to surrender everything all my
[1:45:00] ideas like Abraham he finally got to the
[1:45:02] place where he wasn't protecting himself
[1:45:04] he wasn't trying to have any other way
[1:45:05] what God Said is the way it was going to
[1:45:07] be he offered everything the best of
[1:45:09] everything I just want to offer myself
[1:45:12] that way and I want to come back with an
[1:45:14] offering and I want to come back with
[1:45:16] humility I want to come back with a
[1:45:18] confession Lord I'm nothing I've never
[1:45:21] made it right I've never done anything
[1:45:22] right but I want to give myself to you
[1:45:24] so that you can come in and do right
[1:45:27] through
[1:45:28] me man what an opportunity we have in
[1:45:30] this day to connect back to our father
[1:45:35] oh God the whole purpose of worship oh
[1:45:39] it was simple it was short but it was
[1:45:41] deep and profound has so much meaning
[1:45:44] for me it's my desires is what God's
[1:45:47] offered us in the message this is what
[1:45:49] the message is doing it's reconnecting
[1:45:51] us back through true worship
[1:45:53] back to life again it's exactly what's
[1:45:56] available today friends so thankful for
[1:45:59] that I thank God for his word and may we
[1:46:02] each be encouraged to continue to just
[1:46:06] Worship in spirit and in truth and I'm
[1:46:10] so thankful for what God's done through
[1:46:12] our brother Emanuel I remember a couple
[1:46:15] years ago when he had this desire just
[1:46:17] to do something that he had as a boy
[1:46:19] just to do something to help and I've
[1:46:21] watched we've all watched his God
[1:46:23] directed it from one step to the next to
[1:46:25] the next and how mightily God's using
[1:46:27] our brother by doing what just simply
[1:46:29] going the way he feels LED and let God
[1:46:31] figure it all out amen it's been
[1:46:33] wonderful to watch and I appreciate you
[1:46:35] brother Emanuel God bless you very much
[1:46:38] and I'm also thankful that he got put up
[1:46:40] in the five-star
[1:46:43] hotel amen because when brother Emanuel
[1:46:46] told me that he was he was a little bit
[1:46:48] bashful about it he said I I never spend
[1:46:50] money on that kind of Hotel I would have
[1:46:51] bought a cheaper one and use the funds
[1:46:53] for something else and but you know I
[1:46:56] know the brother left here with a cough
[1:46:59] he left here coughing with a bit of a
[1:47:01] cold and and and he was struggling and
[1:47:03] preaching and with the dust and the
[1:47:05] atmosphere and and you know what God
[1:47:07] knew his servant needed he needed to
[1:47:09] sleep well and have a good shower and
[1:47:10] clean sheets and something to eat
[1:47:12] because he wasn't there for himself he
[1:47:14] was there for God's people serving God's
[1:47:16] purpose so I believe God provided him a
[1:47:18] good hotel and the truth is it was the
[1:47:21] cheapest place he ever stayed in his
[1:47:24] life but I'm thankful that God provided
[1:47:26] it for our brother amen amen I believe
[1:47:29] it was fitting I thank God Amen may God
[1:47:34] just continue to use us as he used our
[1:47:36] brother may he use me may I have the
[1:47:39] sensitivity just to go the way he leads
[1:47:41] me and just trust him and just step out
[1:47:43] by faith man it's been a good lesson for
[1:47:46] us all amen let's just bow our heads and
[1:47:48] thank God for this
[1:47:50] service Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[1:47:52] the service today thank you for the word
[1:47:55] that you've shared with us God you've
[1:47:58] connected us back to yourself by giving
[1:48:00] us a
[1:48:01] revelation that brings us into true
[1:48:03] worship a worship that can be accepted
[1:48:05] by you we're not here Lord to bring you
[1:48:08] Lord Creeds or dogmas or
[1:48:11] ideas but God you've called us bride so
[1:48:14] that we could have faith to take you at
[1:48:17] your word and to give ourselves to you
[1:48:20] as a
[1:48:21] sacrifice to give up Lord every ambition
[1:48:25] and

[1:48:43] couldn't do anything right we were just
[1:48:46] as miserable as the prodical son going
[1:48:48] his own way he had lost
[1:48:50] everything by following his own lust and
[1:48:53] his own passions and his own thoughts
[1:48:54] and his own schemes he had lost it all
[1:48:58] and we as a human beings have done the
[1:49:00] same
[1:49:01] thing but God you have brought us to
[1:49:03] ourselves through this message and
[1:49:05] Awakening and recognition that we have a

[1:49:49] decisions that he has to make and all
[1:49:51] the the the things that you've put in

[1:49:56] in doing it all Lord God that he would
[1:49:58] just be directed by your spirit and he
[1:50:00] would go as he felt led and that you
[1:50:02] would direct him and provide for him and
