[10:00] amen God bless you all this evening amen
[10:03] I'm going to have you take your seats
[10:04] for just a moment and thank you
[10:06] musicians for now amen um as many of you
[10:11] know at the passing of our brother Steve
[10:13] Hollinger that the family has decided to
[10:16] not have a a memorial service or a
[10:18] funeral uh they're going to have a
[10:20] gathering as a family over Thanksgiving
[10:23] but uh I called sister Marsha and I
[10:25] asked if it'd be all right if we just
[10:26] took a few minutes as an assembly and
[10:28] just thank God for the life and the
[10:30] service of our brother for this assembly
[10:33] here so I'd like to start by reading a
[10:35] message from the family it says from the
[10:37] Hollinger Family thank you to everyone
[10:39] for their love and support during the
[10:41] illness and passing of Brother Steve we
[10:44] have been so blessed by all of you there
[10:46] will not be a public viewing or funeral
[10:48] but if anyone has something that they'd
[10:50] like to say or a special memory of
[10:52] Brother Steve we'd love it if you'd
[10:54] write it down and we'll be collecting
[10:55] them for sister Marsha you can either
[10:58] send them by email or snail mail
[11:00] addresses to send them to will be on the
[11:02] bulletin board it's also perfectly fine
[11:05] to give them directly to Sister Marsha
[11:06] or the bogs at church again you've all
[11:09] been such a blessing to us and we're so
[11:11] grateful God bless you
[11:15] amen I thought it would be very
[11:18] appropriate since brother Steve sent
[11:20] spent so many years serving this local
[11:23] church that we would just take a few
[11:25] minutes to reflect on what all he did
[11:27] for us so it's not forgotten uh brother
[11:31] Franco has prepared a slideshow and he's
[11:33] going to he's going to play that and
[11:35] it's uh several pictures of brother
[11:37] Steve and his service to the local body
[11:40] here and it'll just be rotating through
[11:42] as we uh as we have this little service
[11:46] I'm going to read out of 1 Timothy
[11:48] chapter 4 I'm sorry second Timothy
[11:50] chapter 4 you can turn there with me if
[11:52] you like SE 2 Timothy chapter 4 I'm
[11:56] going to read a portion of
[11:57] scripture from
[11:59] from uh verse
[12:03] 6 2 Timothy 4:6 reads for I am now ready
[12:07] to be offered in the time of my
[12:09] departure is at hand I have fought a
[12:11] good fight I have finished my course I
[12:14] have kept the faith henceforth there is
[12:17] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[12:19] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[12:21] give me at that day and not to me only
[12:24] but un all them also that love his
[12:27] appearing I believe our brother finished
[12:30] his course I believe he kept the faith
[12:33] anden Psalms 116:15 also says precious
[12:36] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[12:40] his Saints amen I think it it's been a
[12:43] privilege for me to work with Brother
[12:45] Steve and to to U Been a beneficiary of
[12:50] his years of service here and uh I just
[12:54] went through a little bit of history and
[12:55] as I was looking and I might have a
[12:57] little bit of this uh wrong as far as
[12:59] dates go but just bear with me but
[13:02] brother brother Steve first came to BCF
[13:06] right at the beginning of BCF they were
[13:08] he and sister Marsha were here from the
[13:10] very beginning as the church was being
[13:12] formed right around 1989 1990 is when
[13:15] that was taking place and they were they
[13:18] were here from the very beginning and
[13:21] then somewhere around uh the mid 90s we
[13:24] know in
[13:25] 1995 he became the first camp director
[13:28] for the family camp and he was
[13:30] instrumental in getting that off the
[13:31] ground most of you know but some of you
[13:33] may not some of you are young and don't
[13:35] remember those days you were growing up
[13:37] here but you were Toddlers and infants
[13:39] and all those things and some of you are
[13:41] new to the assembly and don't realize
[13:43] that that we would have probably never
[13:45] had a camp get off the ground and grow
[13:47] to the magnitude it did it without
[13:48] brother Steve he was so well suited to
[13:52] organize he was so well suited to lead
[13:54] those kind of things and he was gifted
[13:56] by God and we know that the Ford motor
[13:58] company got the benefit of those gifts
[14:00] for a long time but that's not why God
[14:02] gave him those gifts it was for us amen
[14:05] we needed his leadership and his ability
[14:07] to coordinate those things somewhere
[14:09] around that same time in the mid uh uh
[14:12] 1990s he became a trustee here for the
[14:15] church and uh he served Faithfully in
[14:17] that role for a long time he just
[14:19] resigned that position just a few years
[14:21] ago uh he retired from Ford in 2001 and
[14:26] after retiring he became a Treasurer and
[14:29] begin began to work uh here at the
[14:32] church he also not just became a
[14:34] Treasurer he also became the office
[14:36] manager here at church he coordinated so
[14:39] many things he oversaw so much the
[14:42] office is not as busy it used to be back
[14:44] in the day when Steve took over but the
[14:46] office used to be a hub of activity back
[14:49] then brother Lonnie was still in his
[14:50] ministry and he was traveling all over
[14:52] the world he was connecting the churches
[14:55] all over the place we were still
[14:56] duplicating VHS tapes Cass set tapes
[14:59] moving into CDs and DVDs and the
[15:02] distribution of those was going out all
[15:04] over the place and so there was activity
[15:07] all the time people coming people going
[15:09] distribution stuff being ordered and and
[15:12] he had a way of keeping track of all of
[15:14] it and organizing it all and making sure
[15:16] everything worked out and he did
[15:18] absolute fantastic
[15:20] job in
[15:23] 2014 I became Pastor uh here and I did
[15:28] just I just want to say I never ever
[15:31] could have done it without brother Steve
[15:34] I moved into a position that I knew
[15:36] nothing about I inherited something that
[15:38] was already in motion and already moving
[15:41] and brother Steve knew every moving
[15:43] piece and how it worked he knew what had
[15:45] been done and why it had been done he
[15:47] knew why the decisions were made he had
[15:49] records for
[15:50] everything brother Steve knew every
[15:53] penny I mean every penny where it went
[15:58] he he could remember numbers like I have
[16:01] never seen in my life he would remember
[16:04] the number on the balance sheet from
[16:05] week to week things that nobody else
[16:08] even wanted to know he would remember
[16:09] and not forget and so when I came on
[16:13] board he helped me get acclimated and
[16:16] adapted so fast and he gave me the
[16:18] background to everything how we were and
[16:20] the positions we were in and and why the
[16:23] decisions were made and why things were
[16:25] the way they were and really helped me
[16:27] immeasurably I know God had him there
[16:29] just to help us in that time of
[16:31] transition and you know St brother Steve
[16:34] told me one time uh as he was just we
[16:38] were just talking in the office and
[16:39] sharing he told me he said that his name
[16:43] something about his name meant
[16:45] faithful and that was always his desire
[16:48] to be faithful he told me that Judas
[16:51] failed as a Treasurer and his goal in
[16:54] life was to prove that you could be
[16:56] faithful as a Treasurer something thing
[16:58] about Judas failing Jesus always
[17:00] bothered him and he didn't like the bad
[17:03] reputation a Treasurer had and he was
[17:05] out to prove that you could be a Godly
[17:07] righteous Treasurer and he was he proved
[17:10] that you could be a Treasurer over the
[17:12] work of God and do it right amen so I
[17:16] always I always marveled at what was so
[17:18] important to him and if I could sum up
[17:21] brother Steve and just a couple words
[17:23] one would be faithful brother Steve was
[17:26] faithful am faithful to his d duties
[17:29] faithful to whatever was his
[17:30] responsibility he saw it through to the
[17:33] end always he dotted every eye he
[17:36] crossed every te he balanced every
[17:39] balance sheet if there was times that
[17:42] the balance sheet would be off and he
[17:44] would come to my office in frustration
[17:46] he said I can't I can't get the balance
[17:48] sheet balanced I'm reconciling the
[17:50] checkbook and the accounts I said how
[17:52] far are you off he said 13
[17:55] cents I'm like just round up or just
[17:57] round
[17:59] yeah and he would go back over the bank
[18:01] wck and he would go back over it and he
[18:03] would work at it for hours until it
[18:05] balanced to the penny he would find
[18:08] where it was off he would find where the
[18:10] mistake was the clerical error the math
[18:12] error whatever it was he would find it
[18:14] and to me it was a no big deal 13 cents
[18:17] we can live without it you know but for
[18:19] him it mattered it mattered and God had
[18:21] wired him that way for that purpose
[18:24] because that's exactly what we needed
[18:26] amen and so he was faith
[18:28] and another word I'd like to use to
[18:30] describe brother Steve is he was
[18:32] loyal brother Steve was absolutely loyal
[18:37] loyal to our Lord first first and
[18:39] foremost he was loyal to his Lord Jesus
[18:41] Christ he was loyal to this assembly he
[18:45] was loyal he was loyal to me as a pastor
[18:48] you know brother Steve was almost twice
[18:52] my age years of experience he had and
[18:56] and he had wisdom and he had seen a lot
[18:58] but yet he was loyal and he would he
[19:01] would he was serving and he was so
[19:04] respectful amen I I I always felt like
[19:07] he is my Elder he knew everything but he
[19:09] would always ask and he would always be
[19:11] respectful he was loyal he was loyal to
[19:14] the position and faithful to the place
[19:16] that God put him and he blessed me
[19:18] immeasurable we got to be quite close as
[19:21] we work together and I have tremendous
[19:24] respect for brother Steven the way he
[19:26] fulfilled his office and I say God was
[19:29] good to us to send brother Steve to us
[19:32] for all those years he served his
[19:34] treasurer for right about 20
[19:37] years uh he served as uh a trustee for
[19:41] more than that he served for a long time
[19:44] as the camp director and we are where we
[19:47] are today by the grace of God and God
[19:50] using Brother Steve as a tool in his
[19:52] hand and we can all thank god brother
[19:54] Steve came to me at one point with a
[19:56] plan to pay the church off early and it
[19:59] was a good plan and and so we we
[20:01] implemented his plan and and we got the
[20:03] church paid off early am mean this
[20:06] church we sit absolute debt free and
[20:09] part of it's because of brother Steve's
[20:11] faithfulness and his
[20:13] diligence brother Steve was 83 years old
[20:16] when he passed away and and there was a
[20:20] scripture we would quot quote from time
[20:21] to time it came up several times in our
[20:24] dialogue together that we are three
[20:26] score years and 10 we've been promised
[20:29] 70 years but brother Steve would correct
[20:31] whoever said that he would make a
[20:33] correction and and here's the scripture
[20:36] that he would he would quote out of
[20:37] Psalms 9010 said the days of our years
[20:40] are three score years and 10 and if by
[20:43] reason of strength they'd be four score
[20:45] years and would always quote that by
[20:47] reason of strength they'd be four score
[20:49] years and so our brother made it Beyond
[20:51] 4 score years and I'm so thankful
[20:54] because that scripture was important to
[20:55] him and he would use it to correct us
[20:57] all the the time and God gave him the
[20:59] strength to make it Beyond 80 years
[21:03] amen but the rest of that scripture goes
[21:07] if by reason of strength and be by be
[21:09] four score Years yet is their strength
[21:12] the yet is their strength labor and
[21:14] sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly
[21:18] away so even if by strength we make it
[21:20] to 80 years our life is still labor and
[21:23] sorrow and it soon be cut off and we fly
[21:26] away and that that's what's happened to
[21:28] our brother he was
[21:31] freed he rendered a faithful service to
[21:35] Christ he served the body of Christ
[21:37] faithfully and loyally and when his work
[21:40] was done the Lord allowed him to depart
[21:42] and go to his reward and we're thankful
[21:45] for that brother Steve was so faithful
[21:49] he was faithful to the Lord faithful to
[21:51] the church faithful to his family he was
[21:53] also faithful to the Ford Motor
[21:56] Company I remember when when I bought a
[21:58] new car I bought a Toyota I was almost
[22:00] ashamed to tell him I was scared of what
[22:03] he would say cuz I didn't buy a Ford and
[22:06] when he knew I was looking for a vehicle
[22:07] he told me of all the good features and
[22:10] accolades and all the good things about
[22:13] Ford and and so when I bought a Toyota
[22:16] he never said
[22:18] anything but I just prayed it would go
[22:22] okay but even as brother Steve we
[22:25] noticed as he got to the end of service
[22:29] we noticed he started to become
[22:31] forgetful he was struggling to remember
[22:32] his short-term memory was failing him
[22:35] and he noticed it as well and he would
[22:37] be more diligent to write things down he
[22:39] would ask us to write things down
[22:41] instead of just telling him what we
[22:43] needed to do in the office we would
[22:44] write it down for him so we knew that
[22:46] the years of service were coming to an
[22:49] end but he wanted to serve as long as he
[22:52] possibly could but when he contracted Co
[22:55] it seemed to uh just accelerate the
[22:58] memory loss and he never really bounced
[23:00] back from that his memory began to
[23:03] deteriorate and his short-term memory
[23:05] loss got worse and worse and until in
[23:07] the end as sister Maria said brother
[23:10] Steve just wasn't brother Steve anymore
[23:13] and it was a great release for him to go
[23:15] home brother Steve wanted to be faithful
[23:17] he wanted to be diligent he wanted to
[23:18] serve he wanted to work he wanted to
[23:20] make sure everything was okay and even
[23:23] in the last part of his life as his
[23:25] memory was deteriorating and his
[23:26] strength was failing and when he would
[23:28] be confused and lost and disoriented and
[23:31] not actually know exactly where he was
[23:33] was what going on the biggest trouble
[23:35] sister Martian's family had with him was
[23:37] to keep him from going to work every day
[23:39] he would get out of his seat determined
[23:41] he had to go work on a project he had to
[23:43] balance the books he had to make sure
[23:45] things were were done right and even
[23:48] they they shared with me when he was in
[23:49] hospice care and he was in such poor
[23:52] health and weakness that he had
[23:54] documents he needed to turn in he had
[23:57] reports that he needed to get done you
[23:59] can just see how that faithfulness was a
[24:01] part of his life all the way through and
[24:03] God used that all the way through he
[24:06] wanted to make sure that he did a good
[24:07] job and the job was done right and the
[24:10] job was done all the way to the end I
[24:13] say thank God you know as our brother
[24:16] became weak and he was no longer able to
[24:19] serve I thank God that he's home because
[24:22] brother Steve is not the kind that can
[24:24] retire and not work on a project and not
[24:27] take care of something and not make sure
[24:30] things are done right and so I thank God
[24:32] that God used him all the way up until
[24:34] just the last little portion of his life
[24:37] and there at the end Lord took him home
[24:39] because he couldn't handle not being
[24:41] productive and so now I just I thank God
[24:44] if God needs a bookkeeper in heaven I
[24:46] don't know that he does but if he does
[24:47] he's got a good one amen so I just thank
[24:51] God for our brother's life I thank God
[24:54] for what he's meant to us and I just
[24:57] don't want want the service and the
[24:58] years of service to ever be forgotten by
[25:01] us it it was an important part of our
[25:04] history here at the church and I'd like
[25:06] to read this quote out of things that
[25:07] are to
[25:09] be brother B says now this old world
[25:12] must fall and it come through
[25:14] disobedience in the
[25:16] beginning he says but the one he is now
[25:19] preparing for you cannot fall because
[25:21] he's making it so I've gone what if we
[25:24] just had to stay in this kind of body
[25:26] aren't you glad there's such a thing as
[25:28] death now isn't that strange but now I
[25:30] say for instance a few years ago I was a
[25:32] little boy and now I'm a middle-aged man
[25:35] I got a friend sitting right there Mr
[25:37] Dow and he's 93 years old a few days ago
[25:40] look at him now 40 or 45 more years what
[25:43] would be what would that would be me now
[25:46] put another 40 years on him where would
[25:48] you go I'm glad that there's something
[25:51] to get us out of this pest house there's
[25:54] an open door and it's called death Jesus
[25:57] stand stands in that door amen he'll
[25:59] guide me over the river he'll take me
[26:01] through that door there's a great door
[26:03] standing Yonder called death and every
[26:05] time your heart beats you're one beat
[26:07] closer to it and someday I must come to
[26:10] that door you must come there but when I
[26:12] come there I don't want to be a coward I
[26:15] don't want to scream and back off I want
[26:17] to come to that door wrap myself in the
[26:19] Robes of his righteousness not mine his
[26:22] and by this I know that I know him in
[26:24] the power of his resurrection that when
[26:26] he calls I'll come come out from among
[26:28] the dead to be with him out of this pest
[26:31] house wherever this body might fall and
[26:33] whatever it might wherever it might land
[26:36] whatever it is I'll come out someday
[26:39] because he promised it to me and we
[26:42] believe it yes sir he's making one that
[26:45] cannot
[26:48] fall amen I'd like to conclude by
[26:51] saying our brother
[26:54] sleepeth because Saints don't die
[26:58] Saints go to sleep he's in that place in
[27:01] the sixth Dimension that brother
[27:03] brandham explained to us and I'm so
[27:05] thankful that in our day that God sent a
[27:07] prophet beyond the curtain of time and
[27:09] let him come back to tell us so that we
[27:11] have such Joy at the passing of God's
[27:13] children knowing that they're in that
[27:15] place that words can't describe that
[27:17] there's no language there's no words in
[27:19] the human language that can describe it
[27:21] it's beyond Sublime there's nothing
[27:23] there but perfect love and an atmosphere
[27:26] that we've all longed to be in and I'm
[27:28] so glad he's there but I'm also so glad
[27:31] that's not the end of the story because
[27:34] at some point the entire plan of God of
[27:38] redemption is going to come to its
[27:41] finality and we're going to come forth
[27:44] and we're going to have a change in the
[27:46] body but before that there's going to be
[27:49] a resurrection of the sleeping Saints
[27:51] and we will have an opportunity for a
[27:53] period of time to see those that have
[27:55] gone on before so that we can begin to
[27:57] connect so we won't be looking for each
[27:58] other when we go beyond and I'm so
[28:00] thankful but there's a there's a
[28:02] something coming soon amen something
[28:05] coming next where we will be United
[28:07] again and I thank God that we will
[28:10] remain in Fellowship continuing in
[28:11] Fellowship our fellowship is only
[28:14] paused it's not
[28:16] finished but one day God will hit the
[28:18] pause button again and all those Saints
[28:20] will come out of the ground and we which
[28:23] are alive and remain shall join them
[28:26] amen with a change of the body and meet
[28:29] him in the air we're to comfort one
[28:32] another with these words I'm comforted
[28:36] amen I thank God musicians if you'll
[28:39] come let's all Stand Together I'd like
[28:41] to sing a song
[28:44] together I'd like to sing this song what
[28:46] a day that'll be when my Jesus I shall
[28:50] see you know there's a Time coming when
[28:53] we'll be back upon this Earth together
[28:58] with our Lord to Fellowship to enjoy
[29:01] that fellowship and you know in the
[29:04] Millennium it may not be that God needs
[29:08] a Treasurer a bookkeeper an organizer a
[29:11] planner in the sixth Dimension but when
[29:14] we come back in the Millennium God says
[29:16] we've got work to do we'll have
[29:18] jobs and brother Venom also said that uh
[29:22] he says death does not change you it
[29:24] just changes your Dwelling Place
[29:25] whatever you are you'll be there
[29:28] amen so I believe God still has work for
[29:31] our brother to do in the
[29:32] Millennium amen and and we'll we'll I
[29:35] believe be enjoying his faithfulness and
[29:38] his loyalty and his ability to do what
[29:40] God's called him to do again at some
[29:43] point amen let's just sing this song
[29:46] together while we're
[29:48] standing well there is
[29:51] comeing a
[29:53] day when no
[29:56] heart shall

[36:16] we would continue on Lord I pray you'd
[36:18] help us to be as faithful as our brother
[36:20] was as loyal to you and to your word as
[36:23] he was and may his life be an
[36:25] inspiration that propels us forward Lord
[36:29] God now as we take this time this
[36:31] evening a few minutes to look into your
[36:33] word I pray God that you would anoint
[36:34] the preaching of your word that you
[36:36] would anoint this vessel to bring your

[37:04] Ephesians chapter
[37:11] 1 amen there's a thought that I'd like
[37:14] to share with you there's a uh something
[37:16] that I wrote down on a scrap of paper
[37:19] about two weeks ago I believe it was I
[37:22] was just sitting and I was studying and
[37:24] study and all of a sudden another
[37:25] thought came and I took out a piece
[37:26] paper and I wrote it down quickly and I
[37:28] didn't know when it would come forth but
[37:30] it just seemed fitting to me I was
[37:32] impressed upon me to bring it today and
[37:34] it and it works out well because I know
[37:36] we don't have a lot of time I don't
[37:37] intend to take a lot of time it's a
[37:39] simple thought it's a subject we've
[37:41] preached on from every angle again and
[37:43] again and we will preach on it again and
[37:45] again and again but there was a thought
[37:47] a way that I'd like to express it and I
[37:49] hope that it's helpful to us as we move
[37:51] forward but let's look here at Ephesians
[37:54] chap 1 verse 3
[37:59] blessed be the God and father of our
[38:01] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[38:04] all spiritual blessings and Heavenly
[38:06] places in Christ according as he hath
[38:08] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[38:11] of the world that we should be holy and
[38:13] Without Blame before him in love having
[38:16] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[38:18] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[38:20] according to the good pleasure of his
[38:22] will to the praise of his glory of his
[38:25] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[38:29] in the Beloved amen God bless you as you
[38:32] take your
[38:33] seats amen before I go into keep your uh
[38:36] scripture open there we're going to look
[38:37] at this for a minute brother Franco I'm
[38:39] going to go to the Whiteboard too if you
[38:41] can pull that up I'm going to use that
[38:43] here in just a moment I I just want to
[38:45] wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving so I
[38:47] don't forget to say that amen I hope you
[38:49] have a wonderful time with your families
[38:51] enjoy some time off and some rest amen I
[38:54] I want to appreciate also uh brother
[38:56] brother Ben and sister Amanda for
[38:57] opening their home for those who want to
[38:59] join in them for the Thanksgiving dinner
[39:01] tomorrow may God bless them there amen
[39:03] and and we have a lot to be thankful for
[39:05] and I I love Thanksgiving I wish we
[39:07] could do it like once a month you know
[39:09] it's my it is my favorite holiday of all
[39:11] the holidays Thanksgiving is my favorite
[39:14] I love the time the quiet still time as
[39:16] a family amen and I appreciate brother
[39:20] Ben he's going to take the service for
[39:21] us on Sunday I asked him if he'd take
[39:23] that for me amen I've got myself just a
[39:25] little bit pour down and I wanted a few
[39:27] days off and I want to go down and see
[39:29] my mom and so he's going to take the
[39:30] Sunday service which affords me some
[39:32] time to do that so I really appreciate
[39:34] that and I ask you'd be praying for the
[39:36] Sunday service also I want to let you
[39:39] know I've got a trip coming up and I
[39:40] keep forgetting to tell you uh here in
[39:42] just just under two weeks I'm going to
[39:45] be going to India I'll be going on
[39:47] December 4th through the 16th brother
[39:48] Ron Garvin and I will be traveling
[39:50] together and we're going for brother
[39:52] Roshan msi's dedication services for his
[39:55] church so they they finally got the
[39:57] church done I don't even think it's 100%
[39:59] done but I think it's pretty close so
[40:01] we're going to go for the dedication
[40:03] Services there then we've got some
[40:05] ministers meetings in a couple different
[40:06] places in the country and then I'm going
[40:08] to be traveling over to brother jarat
[40:11] marapi I don't know if you remember jar
[40:12] rotam marapi he's a brother who's been
[40:15] here before I love saying his name I had
[40:17] to practice for like three days to get
[40:18] it right so I say it as often as I can
[40:21] because it's so much fun J rotten and
[40:23] Marlo booty but anyways he's been asking
[40:25] me to come for some time because he was
[40:27] very very sick with Co he and his wife
[40:29] and the Lord raised him up and then his
[40:31] wife had cancer and the Lord raised her
[40:34] up yeah and this all happened within the
[40:36] last I think year and a half to two
[40:37] years and he's been asking me to come
[40:39] for a period of time because he wants to
[40:41] hold Thanksgiving services for the
[40:42] healing of his wife and for their uh
[40:45] healing and uh and so uh it works out
[40:49] that I can just extend my trip a little
[40:51] bit and do that when I go to brother
[40:53] rashan so we'll be taking part in that
[40:55] so I really really appreciate you
[40:57] praying for us it's uh a lot of travel
[41:02] so just pray for us that God will give
[41:04] us strength and help us along the way
[41:07] amen when I look at this scripture here
[41:10] in Ephesians chapter 1 I just want to
[41:12] highlight a few
[41:13] things that verse four that he hath
[41:17] chosen us it's so important that we
[41:20] never forget he hath chosen
[41:23] us it's such a consolation when that
[41:26] becomes a reality and a revelation to us
[41:28] that he has chosen
[41:30] us amen and when did he chose us where
[41:34] did he choose us he chose us in Christ
[41:36] and when did he choose us in Christ
[41:38] before the foundation of the world Amen
[41:41] why did he choose us in Christ before
[41:43] the foundation of the world that we
[41:45] should be holy and Without Blame before
[41:48] him in
[41:49] love this is before we've done right or
[41:53] wrong this is before we've had a chance
[41:55] to behave ourselves on the earth in a
[41:57] certain way and God chose us in him
[42:01] before the foundation of the world that
[42:04] we should be holy and Without Blame
[42:06] before him in love amen so God already
[42:09] had a Plan of Redemption amen so that he
[42:12] could choose us in Christ before the
[42:14] foundational world that we would be holy
[42:16] and Without Blame before him in love it
[42:20] wasn't that we were going to be holy and
[42:21] Without Blame because of our conduct he
[42:24] knew that the fall would happen happened
[42:26] and he knew the kind of condition we
[42:28] become and he foresaw the fall and he
[42:30] knew the corruption that would set in
[42:32] our bodies and the corruption that would
[42:33] set in in the world and knowing that he
[42:36] had to have a plan that's why he chose
[42:38] us in Christ amen because Christ would
[42:40] be the propitiation Christ would be the
[42:42] lamb that takes away the sins of the
[42:43] world his blood would be the atonement
[42:45] and the covering for our sins so he
[42:47] already chose us in him before the
[42:48] foundation of the world because so that
[42:50] we could be holy and Without Blame
[42:52] before him in love amen having
[42:56] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[42:58] children oh I love this because when
[43:01] brother brandham teaches adoption
[43:03] brother brandham teaches adoption as not
[43:05] birth but he teaches adoption as placing
[43:08] at maturity amen so we would be born
[43:10] again by the spirit of God but we would
[43:12] grow up into him in all things and we
[43:14] would be placed through
[43:16] through a ceremony of adoption through
[43:19] the process of adoption we would be
[43:21] placed as mature Sons and Daughters into
[43:23] a position in his body to serve his
[43:25] purpose amen so think about it friends
[43:28] we can say oh he chose me but I don't
[43:30] know where I'm at and and I I'm never
[43:32] going to make it I keep failing but he
[43:34] chose you he predestinated us unto the
[43:37] adoption of children he already
[43:39] predestinated you to make it to
[43:42] maturity amen amen he predestinated you
[43:46] to be part of the adopted children not
[43:49] just birth but
[43:51] adopted you're going to make
[43:53] it you are going to make it you're going
[43:56] to grow into the stature of a perfect
[43:58] man you're going to grow into the
[43:59] measure of Christ you're going to mature
[44:02] you're going to bump your nose you're
[44:03] going to stub your toe you're going to
[44:05] embarrass
[44:06] yourself but you're going to make it to
[44:09] adoption it's going to happen amen and
[44:12] bumping your nose and stubbing your toe
[44:14] and all of those things are part of
[44:16] growing up process part of shaming
[44:18] yourself part of making mistakes part of
[44:20] becoming embarrassed part of having to
[44:22] make it right amen all of that is the
[44:25] process that works together to bring us
[44:27] into adoption because it's a it's a
[44:29] maturing so that we can move into this
[44:31] positional placing but we've been
[44:34] predestinated unto the adoption of
[44:37] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[44:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[44:43] will it's not even because we want it
[44:47] that's right it's because he wants
[44:52] it to the praise of the glory of his
[44:55] grace Grace this is one of my favorite
[44:57] parts to the praise of the glory of his
[45:00] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[45:04] in the Beloved amen he has made us
[45:09] accepted in the Beloved I'm accepted in
[45:12] the Beloved why because he made me so by
[45:17] his predestinated plan I'm going to uh
[45:20] write something down on the Whiteboard
[45:21] here this is what this is what I grabbed
[45:23] a paper and wrote down it just came to
[45:26] my mind like a Flash and I've learned to
[45:28] yield to those things and and I wrote
[45:31] down this
[45:44] question has anybody ever asked
[45:46] themselves a
[45:48] question anybody ever had this thought
[45:50] have you ever heard anybody ask
[45:52] themselves this question there's another
[45:54] question that's very similar simar to
[46:00] this why did
[46:03] God use
[46:05] me or how can God use me or why would
[46:08] God use me it's all a similar question
[46:12] so why did God choose me and how can God
[46:16] use me or why would God use me and and
[46:20] you understand when people ask this
[46:21] question there's many reasons why they
[46:23] ask this question and we know that we
[46:25] are not wired the same we're not all the
[46:27] same type of Personality we're not all
[46:28] the same person we don't all have the
[46:30] same complexes we don't have the same
[46:32] backgrounds some people have a bold
[46:34] faith and they have uh the ability just
[46:36] to take God his word and move forward
[46:37] and they don't question those things
[46:39] they just believe and they move forward
[46:40] but there's many many people who has
[46:42] suffered things through their life and
[46:44] they have certain temperaments and
[46:45] certain personalities where they they
[46:47] have low self-esteem they've maybe been
[46:50] neglected maybe they were belittled or
[46:52] put down or condemned all of their life
[46:54] if you have somebody who has a parent
[46:56] that never affirmed you and constantly
[46:58] put you down and ridiculed you and
[46:59] criticized you you have a really
[47:01] difficult time seeing any value in
[47:03] yourself and it's just something that
[47:05] some of us have to bear with and have to
[47:07] overcome and so there's so many
[47:09] different personality types and some
[47:10] people struggle with a question like
[47:12] this other people may not struggle if
[47:14] you never struggle with this praise God
[47:16] Amen but some people have so when as
[47:19] soon as I wrote down this question I
[47:21] wrote down another
[47:23] question uh and this is is the this is
[47:26] the one that really blessed
[47:43] me and this is the one that solves the
[47:47] problem because if you ask me the
[47:50] question why would God choose me I say
[47:52] if you answer my question I'll answer
[47:54] your question am isn't that what Jesus
[47:57] did yeah so if you come and ask me the
[48:01] question why would God choose me I'll
[48:03] ask you I'm just giving you fair warning
[48:05] from now on I'll say answer this first
[48:07] then I'll answer your question why
[48:09] wouldn't God choose
[48:12] me try to think of a reason why God
[48:15] wouldn't choose you well I've made so
[48:18] many mistakes show me somebody in the
[48:21] Bible who didn't make mistakes that God
[48:24] chose well I've lived in immorality
[48:26] before do you remember the woman at the
[48:29] well I I I I did this and I did that
[48:33] show me an example amen where God Amen
[48:36] wouldn't choose somebody because of
[48:38] their past mistakes because of living in
[48:40] ignorance because of believing false
[48:42] Doctrine show me anywhere in the Bible
[48:44] that that made somebody ineligible to be
[48:47] used by
[48:49] God so if you can answer the second
[48:51] question then I'll answer your first
[48:53] question because why wouldn't God tell
[48:56] me something God Amen would would not
[48:59] would not be able to overcome by his
[49:01] blood tell me something he would not be
[49:03] able to offset by his own will and the
[49:05] provision that he made turn with me to
[49:08] Deuteronomy 7 I just want to look at
[49:10] this for just a few minutes and these
[49:12] are like I said things we know things
[49:14] we've talked about but I just want to go
[49:16] through
[49:18] them together Deuteronomy chapter
[49:24] 7
[49:26] verse
[49:29] 6 Deuteronomy
[49:32] 7:6 he says for thou art a holy people
[49:35] unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God
[49:38] ha chosen thee to be a special people
[49:40] unto himself above all the people that
[49:42] are upon the face of the Earth the Lord
[49:45] did not set his love upon you nor choose
[49:48] you because you were more number than
[49:50] any people for he for ye were the fewest
[49:54] of all people but because because the
[49:55] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[49:58] the oath which he has sworn unto your
[50:00] fathers hath the Lord brought you out
[50:02] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[50:04] of the house of bond men from the hand
[50:06] of pharaoh king of
[50:08] Egypt now know therefore that the Lord
[50:11] thy God he is God the faithful God which
[50:13] keepeth Covenant in Mercy with them that
[50:15] love him and keep his Commandments to a
[50:17] thousand
[50:19] Generations God did not set his love
[50:21] upon the nation of Israel because they
[50:24] were the most but you were the they he
[50:25] says you were the least you were the
[50:27] fewest you weren't the greatest he
[50:29] basically he's telling them you had
[50:31] nothing to attract God when it comes to
[50:35] the physical you didn't have a nation
[50:37] you didn't have great people you didn't
[50:39] have great resources you didn't have
[50:41] anything when God came to set his love
[50:43] upon them and rescue them out of bondage
[50:45] they had nothing amen you realize they
[50:48] were slaves they didn't have property
[50:49] they didn't have wealth they didn't have
[50:51] anything amen they didn't have a system
[50:53] of government they didn't have a form of
[50:55] anything they had nothing nothing that
[50:58] would attract God's attention to them
[51:00] the only thing they had is they were
[51:02] already recipients of his love amen he
[51:04] set his love upon them because of his
[51:06] own choosing because of his own will
[51:08] amen it wasn't because they were the
[51:10] most it wasn't because they were
[51:11] greatest he chose them because he loved
[51:14] them
[51:17] period what made him love them that's
[51:20] the mystery of God's love it's by
[51:23] predestination amen amen am so he he
[51:26] says I loved you I set my love upon you
[51:29] not for these other reasons but because
[51:31] I loved you and because I was going to
[51:33] keep my
[51:34] word let's go to Jeremiah now together
[51:38] Jeremiah chapter
[51:53] 1 Jeremiah chapter chap
[51:58] 1 verse
[52:02] 4 then the word of the Lord came unto me
[52:05] saying before I formed thee in the belly
[52:07] I knew thee and before thou camest forth
[52:10] out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[52:13] ordained thee a prophet unto the
[52:16] Nations Jeremiah didn't have to do
[52:19] anything become anything learn anything
[52:23] promise anything he didn't have any
[52:25] Hoops to jump through he had no
[52:27] accomplishments to make to earn any
[52:29] position or work or anything that he
[52:31] could do for the Lord
[52:33] before God says before I formed thee in
[52:36] the belly I knew
[52:38] thee amen he knew him he had knowledge
[52:41] of him before amen conception came
[52:44] before he was being knit together in his
[52:47] mother's womb God already knew Jeremiah
[52:50] and already ordained him to serve his
[52:52] purpose and already ordained him to be a
[52:54] prophet unto the the Nations what did
[52:56] Jeremiah have to do Jeremiah didn't have
[52:58] to do anything Jeremiah didn't form
[53:00] himself didn't knit himself together
[53:02] didn't bring himself he didn't give
[53:04] himself the Breath of Life didn't make
[53:05] himself a prophet all Jeremiah
[53:08] did actually Jeremiah did
[53:12] nothing this is what God did said I
[53:16] sanctify thee that means I set thee
[53:17] apart for myself I Sanctified thee amen
[53:21] and I ordained thee to be a prophet unto
[53:23] the Nations amen what there was nothing
[53:27] that Jeremiah could do to earn this
[53:29] position and there was nothing Jeremiah
[53:31] could do to lose this
[53:34] position amen let's go to John
[53:47] 18 John chapter
[53:51] 18 I'm sorry John chapter 15 not 18 John
[53:54] chapter chap
[53:57] 15 verse
[53:59] 16 John 15-16 he says ye have not chosen
[54:04] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[54:08] you that you should go and bring forth
[54:09] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[54:12] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[54:14] father in my name he may give it you
[54:17] what a consolation he's speaking to the
[54:18] disciples here he's saying you haven't
[54:20] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[54:25] ordained you that you should go forth
[54:27] and bring forth fruit God already
[54:30] ordained them to be fruitful in the
[54:33] ministry it wasn't that they were going
[54:35] to become really good
[54:37] ministers and they would become skilled
[54:40] over time and they would learn how to
[54:41] handle the word and you understand
[54:44] that's the foolish Mind of a man would
[54:46] think that somehow that these disciples
[54:49] just they finally got some education and
[54:51] they finally did a little bit better and
[54:53] they learned how to preach and Peter got
[54:54] to be kind of a good preacher and and
[54:56] then he had a fruitful Ministry after
[54:58] years of experience my goodness that's
[55:01] the foolish thinking of a human being
[55:03] amen but God says you haven't chosen me
[55:05] I chose you and I ordained you that you
[55:07] should go forth and bear fruit amen that
[55:09] you're going to be fruitful and the
[55:11] ministry that I give you is going to
[55:12] bear fruit because I ordained it not
[55:14] because you got so good at it and you
[55:17] amen that's the some of the that's some
[55:19] of the trouble we get into as we mature
[55:21] in Christ and we grow we begin to think
[55:23] that somehow along the way we acquired
[55:26] skills and we got better and the truth
[55:27] is God is training us we're not we're
[55:29] not ignorant to the fact that that God
[55:31] teaches us things along the way but
[55:33] we're not coming to that by our devices
[55:35] or by our efforts or by our study it's
[55:37] because he ordained it so he ordained us
[55:41] to grow in Ministry he ordained us to
[55:43] grow in understanding he ordained Us in
[55:45] whatever position he's placed Us in he's
[55:47] ordained us to become fruitful so he
[55:49] will see to it that we become fruitful
[55:51] and we will learn the things we learn we
[55:53] will go through the things we need to go
[55:55] through and he will reveal to us the
[55:56] things he needs to reveal to us so that
[55:58] we will bring forth
[56:00] fruit because he already ordained
[56:04] it
[56:07] amen
[56:09] sometimes we get stuck with an Earthly
[56:13] perspective the question why would God
[56:16] choose me it's a very Earthly
[56:19] perspective
[56:21] question why would God choose me and and
[56:24] when somebody asks that they're always
[56:26] referring to their littleness their
[56:28] inability their inadequacy their
[56:30] failures their their their whatever
[56:33] they're always referring to those things
[56:34] and those are all Earthly things they
[56:37] have nothing to do with the Eternal they
[56:38] have nothing to do with the Heavenly and
[56:40] you know it's actually uh the Earthly
[56:44] perspective is not bad in itself because
[56:46] there's some humility that comes with
[56:49] that we should always be in touch
[56:51] brother B said we should always be in
[56:52] touch with our
[56:53] littleness
[56:56] right we should always realize that
[56:58] without God I'm nothing that there
[57:00] really is nothing in me amen I'm talking
[57:03] the flesh side now there's really
[57:05] nothing in my Earthly existence that
[57:07] would make God want to choose me when
[57:10] God came to me amen there was nothing
[57:12] that I had on a natural sense that was
[57:16] attracting God's
[57:17] attention it wasn't like he needed some
[57:20] ability that I had or some skill that he
[57:23] was lacking in his body and he was out
[57:25] searching for somebody who met this
[57:27] criteria oh and I finally found one who
[57:30] had this certain thing that I need my
[57:32] goodness everything that I had that he
[57:34] would use he planted there by
[57:35] predestination anyways he looked after
[57:38] my grandfather and grandmother and
[57:40] brought these two together to get the
[57:41] bell with a certain mix to have a
[57:43] certain T so anything that he was going
[57:45] to use he placed there amen so there was
[57:47] nothing that I had to attract his
[57:49] attention there's only one thing that I
[57:51] had that's a seed of eternal life and I
[57:54] wasn't respons responsible for putting
[57:55] it there he placed it in my soul before
[57:57] the foundation of the
[58:00] world so there there's a there's an
[58:03] that's an Earthly perspective and that's
[58:05] not all bad it's I don't think we are
[58:07] ever in error at being amazed and
[58:10] blessed by the fact that God would
[58:12] choose us when we have no
[58:14] worthiness there's something healthy in
[58:17] that but when it becomes when it when it
[58:19] moves Beyond just a healthy recognition
[58:22] of the grace of God in our lives and it
[58:24] becomes a uming block where we feel like
[58:26] we cannot do something for the kingdom
[58:28] of God we cannot be used amen then all
[58:30] of a sudden that Earthly perspective
[58:32] that that should keep us humble and help
[58:34] us to reverence God and be thankful now
[58:36] it becomes a negative and it becomes a
[58:39] barrier to us actually serving the
[58:41] purpose God put us here for and that's
[58:44] what we have to break Beyond amen we
[58:46] have to have amen we have to understand
[58:48] our littleness but we also must
[58:50] understand our predestination and God
[58:52] choosing us and that God has a plan for
[58:54] for our lives and he can do Supernatural
[58:57] he can do beyond anything we ever
[58:59] thought if we'll just let him do
[59:01] it there has to be a faith that takes
[59:04] hold that overrides the Flesh and
[59:06] recognizes the
[59:10] supernatural amen I think it's amazing
[59:13] that in Matthew 16 when when God asks
[59:15] who do men say that I am and Peter gives
[59:17] the answer and he says you know Thou Art
[59:19] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[59:21] he says flesh and blood is not revealed
[59:23] this to you but my father which art in
[59:25] heaven and then he goes on to tell Peter
[59:27] he he says it this way he says Thou Art
[59:29] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[59:31] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[59:33] Prevail against it and I will give unto
[59:35] thee the keys of the king kingdom of
[59:38] heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on
[59:41] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[59:42] whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth
[59:44] shall be loosed in heaven amen and you
[59:47] ask yourself who's he talking to he's
[59:50] talking to a
[59:52] fisherman right yeah he's talking to not
[59:56] the Upper Crust of society he's talking
[59:58] to a common working man amen and and in
[1:00:01] Acts 4 brother bam goes to this all the
[1:00:03] time he refers to this in Acts 4 amen
[1:00:06] when Peter and John amen they went to
[1:00:08] the temple through the gate called
[1:00:10] beautiful and the lame man was there and
[1:00:12] they they extended unto him grace and
[1:00:14] mercy by the grace of God and he was
[1:00:15] healed went running and leaping and
[1:00:17] jumping into the temple and it created a
[1:00:19] stir and they arrested them and they
[1:00:21] questioned them and they brought them
[1:00:22] before the Sanhedrin and now Peter and
[1:00:25] John listen Peter and John were
[1:00:28] fishermen yes who were hiding from the
[1:00:32] Jews just a short time before but now
[1:00:34] under the power of the Holy Ghost they
[1:00:36] became Witnesses and Spilled Out onto
[1:00:38] the street now they're going to the
[1:00:39] temple to worship now a notable Miracle
[1:00:41] is done now they're hauled before the
[1:00:43] Sanhedrin and if we if we don't think of
[1:00:46] Peter as the great Apostle and John as
[1:00:49] the great Apostle of love but we
[1:00:51] recognize them as common men amen who
[1:00:53] are now standing standing here before
[1:00:55] the
[1:00:56] Sanhedrin it's super intimidating it's
[1:00:59] like somebody plucking you up right now
[1:01:01] today and setting you in the halls of
[1:01:04] Congress to answer before the joint
[1:01:06] house of
[1:01:08] Congress and you'd be like um um um um
[1:01:14] um but they had this to
[1:01:17] say when they saw the boldness of Peter
[1:01:19] and John and perceived that they were
[1:01:22] unlearned and ignorant men
[1:01:25] unlearned means illiterate no education
[1:01:29] in ignorant is an interesting word it
[1:01:32] means rude or base or or the opposite of
[1:01:35] of of anything that was in the Sanhedrin
[1:01:37] they were the exact
[1:01:40] opposite educated and Noble and worthy
[1:01:43] they were they were rude and base and
[1:01:46] uneducated there was a stark contrast
[1:01:48] going on here and they knew that they
[1:01:50] were unlearned and ignorant men they
[1:01:53] marveled and they took took knowledge of
[1:01:54] them that they had been with
[1:01:57] Jesus amen why they took knowledge they
[1:02:00] had been with Jesus why they marveled
[1:02:01] because this is extraordinary these men
[1:02:04] shouldn't talk like this these men
[1:02:06] shouldn't have this boldness they
[1:02:07] shouldn't have this ability they
[1:02:08] shouldn't be able to answer us back amen
[1:02:11] where did it come from it came from the
[1:02:12] predestinated plan of God because he
[1:02:14] ordained them to bring forth fruit it
[1:02:17] wasn't skill it wasn't eloquence it was
[1:02:19] the power of God in their
[1:02:21] lives and if Peter continued amen
[1:02:25] continued with the idea I'm just an
[1:02:27] ignorant fisherman I can't do anything
[1:02:29] I'm just an ignorant fisherman God can't
[1:02:32] use me I'm a nobody in this life I'm an
[1:02:34] ignorant fisherman how can I preach the
[1:02:37] gospel amen you see that that that
[1:02:39] mentality is got to be broken by the
[1:02:41] revelation of the hour amen he needs to
[1:02:44] stay humble all the time he needs to be
[1:02:46] dependent on God all the time he needs
[1:02:48] to be thankful for the grace of God all
[1:02:50] the time but at some point he's got to
[1:02:52] get up and say I can't help it this is
[1:02:55] what God's called me to do and if he's
[1:02:56] called me to do he's got to empower me
[1:02:58] to do it until it's not me doing it it's
[1:03:00] him doing it through
[1:03:05] me and that takes
[1:03:10] faith if you turn with me back to
[1:03:15] judges I want to look in the Book of
[1:03:20] Judges chapter
[1:03:23] 6
[1:03:26] in verse
[1:03:34] 11 judges chap 6: 11 is a story of
[1:03:38] Gideon and there came an angel of the
[1:03:41] Lord and sat under an oak which was an
[1:03:44] ofra that pertaineth to joash the
[1:03:48] eite and his son Gideon threshing Wheat
[1:03:51] by the wine press to hide it from the
[1:03:53] midianites and and the angel of the Lord
[1:03:54] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[1:03:56] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[1:03:59] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[1:04:01] Lord if the Lord be with us why then is
[1:04:03] all this befallen us and where be all
[1:04:05] his miracles which our fathers told us
[1:04:07] of saying did not the Lord bring us up
[1:04:09] from Egypt but now the Lord hath
[1:04:11] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[1:04:13] hands of the midianites and the Lord
[1:04:15] looked upon him and said go in this thy
[1:04:17] might and thou shalt save Israel from
[1:04:19] the hand of the midianites have not I
[1:04:21] sent thee and he said unto them oh my
[1:04:25] Lord wherewith shall I save Israel
[1:04:28] behold my family is poor in Manasseh and
[1:04:31] I am the least in my father's house and
[1:04:35] the Lord said unto him surely I will be
[1:04:37] with thee and thou shalt Smite the
[1:04:40] midianites as one
[1:04:44] man you know Gideon the angel of the
[1:04:47] Lord I love this calls him a mighty man
[1:04:49] of Valor before Gideon realized he was a
[1:04:52] mighty man of Valor when the angel spoke
[1:04:55] to him the angel spoke his position by
[1:04:59] predestination but he wasn't speaking
[1:05:01] his position in that day because this
[1:05:03] Mighty Man of Valor was threshing Wheat
[1:05:05] by The Wine Press hiding it from the
[1:05:07] midianites so they wouldn't come and
[1:05:08] take it away he wasn't Brave he wasn't
[1:05:10] bold he wasn't a warrior he he was
[1:05:12] hiding threshing out a little bit of
[1:05:14] wheat so he could have a little bit of
[1:05:16] food so the midianites couldn't take it
[1:05:17] away but the angel come and dressed him
[1:05:20] from a Heavenly perspective amen but
[1:05:22] Gideon answered back from an Earthly
[1:05:26] perspective thou Mighty Man of Valor and
[1:05:29] he says uh uh he says the Lord be with
[1:05:32] you he says if the Lord be with us where
[1:05:34] are all his miracles and why has the
[1:05:36] Lord forsaken us and what's going on I
[1:05:38] mean he's in a bad spot nothing's
[1:05:41] working out right they're in trouble
[1:05:43] amen they're under the judgments of God
[1:05:45] and now he he he's not automatically
[1:05:48] believing
[1:05:50] it his condition is such he's saying
[1:05:53] what do you mean the Lord Lord be with
[1:05:54] if the Lord be with us where are all his
[1:05:56] miracles why why has all this befallen
[1:05:58] us and he says you know go in thy might
[1:06:01] and save Israel from the hand of the
[1:06:02] midianites and he says wait a minute
[1:06:04] wait wait a minute how shall I save
[1:06:08] Israel I'm of a poor family in Manasseh
[1:06:11] and I'm the least in my father's house
[1:06:14] now this is the way he sees himself but
[1:06:16] what he needs to get is he needs to get
[1:06:18] a little bit of that heavenly vision and
[1:06:19] go back to what the angel said and the
[1:06:21] angel said behold thou mighty man of
[1:06:24] Valor that's the predestinated word of
[1:06:28] God over his
[1:06:31] life that's why we've had an angel in
[1:06:34] this day say thou art the Spotless
[1:06:36] sinless spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ oh my goodness I don't think we
[1:06:43] should ever lose our littleness I don't
[1:06:45] think we should ever forget that we're
[1:06:47] just flesh I don't think we should ever
[1:06:49] forget that without God we're nothing
[1:06:51] but I also don't think we should ever
[1:06:53] forget what the angel said God's
[1:06:55] perspective and God's Vision amen what
[1:06:57] God has made clean how can we call
[1:06:59] unclean what God has equipped how can we
[1:07:01] say is unequipped what God has empowered
[1:07:04] can we say has no
[1:07:06] power our life is a
[1:07:09] paradox
[1:07:12] amen when God was going to
[1:07:17] call uh the Apostle Paul he was Saul at
[1:07:20] this time Saul was wrapped up in his own
[1:07:23] ER arance and his own pride and his own
[1:07:26] understanding and ability and education
[1:07:27] and all the things that Earth could
[1:07:29] offer and he thought he had a position
[1:07:31] and he thought he was smart and he
[1:07:33] thought he was skilled thought he was
[1:07:34] well trained and he thought he was well
[1:07:37] equipped he had it all going for him but
[1:07:39] he had an encounter with a living
[1:07:41] breathing Jesus Christ the pillar of
[1:07:43] fire and in that encounter he realized
[1:07:45] he didn't have anything he didn't know
[1:07:47] anything he had no strength had no power
[1:07:49] had nothing he was brought down to the
[1:07:51] dust and
[1:07:52] humbled but but God didn't humble him to
[1:07:55] keep him there amen God humbled him so
[1:07:58] that he would realize he's nothing he
[1:08:00] would count everything as D but God told
[1:08:03] uh uh God told uh the prophet he says
[1:08:06] he's a chosen
[1:08:08] vessel unto
[1:08:11] me God brought him down so God could
[1:08:14] bring him
[1:08:15] up
[1:08:17] amen sometimes we have to come and we
[1:08:19] have to face our sin we have to face
[1:08:21] what we really are sometimes amen we
[1:08:23] have to face face our failures face the
[1:08:26] the hidden sin in our life face the how
[1:08:29] wretched and how miserable and how wrong
[1:08:30] we've been but not so that we can stay
[1:08:34] there so that we can repent so that we
[1:08:36] can acknowledge that we're nothing
[1:08:37] without him so that he can pick us up
[1:08:39] and put us in his ordained position for
[1:08:41] us we cannot always wallow in past
[1:08:45] sins we can't always be inhibited
[1:08:48] because we failed in the past we did
[1:08:49] fail in the past we all failed in the
[1:08:51] past we had to fail in the past to to
[1:08:53] know what we are in the flesh it's
[1:08:55] important for us to know and to remember
[1:08:57] what we are on our
[1:09:00] own but we can't stay there at some
[1:09:03] point we have to recognize that he chose
[1:09:06] me I didn't choose him he ordained me I
[1:09:08] didn't ordain me he's empowered me I
[1:09:11] didn't Empower me and he's got something
[1:09:12] for me to do and if he's called me to do
[1:09:14] it I can do
[1:09:19] it this is what the Apostle Paul says in
[1:09:21] 1 Corinthians 15 and this is the
[1:09:24] attitude that I want to take from it in
[1:09:28] 1 Corinthians 15:9 he says for I am
[1:09:31] least of the
[1:09:32] Apostles that I am not meat that means
[1:09:35] worthy to be called an apostle because I
[1:09:38] persecuted the Church of
[1:09:40] God but by the grace of God I am what I
[1:09:45] am oh if you want to take away anything
[1:09:48] from tonight I hope that you can take
[1:09:50] this away you can say I'm not worthy to
[1:09:52] be bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:54] I'm not worthy to be the elect seed of
[1:09:56] God I'm not worthy to be the sinless
[1:09:58] Spotless virtuous bride I'm not worthy
[1:10:00] of that position I'm not worthy of that
[1:10:02] title amen there's nothing in me that
[1:10:04] makes me worthy I'm not worthy I'm not
[1:10:08] I'm not worthy to see the back part of
[1:10:10] God's mind unveiled I'm not worthy to
[1:10:12] have the revelation of the Mysteries I'm
[1:10:15] not worthy of any of that because I was
[1:10:17] wrong and I did wrong and I thought
[1:10:19] wrong and I acted wrong and I did it on
[1:10:22] purpose I'm not worthy for any of that I
[1:10:25] sinned willfully and I sinned by
[1:10:27] premeditation and I I did everything
[1:10:29] that you could possibly do wrong I'm not
[1:10:31] worthy for this position but I'll tell
[1:10:33] you one thing by the grace of God I am
[1:10:35] what I am and I can't change what I
[1:10:40] am amen that's what gave Paul the power
[1:10:43] to do signs and wonders and move in the
[1:10:45] ministry and stand in the face of all
[1:10:47] kinds of opposition not because he was
[1:10:49] constantly remembering his littleness
[1:10:51] but because he was remembering the
[1:10:52] position God put him in his
[1:10:54] predestinated position the way God
[1:10:57] called him and what God thought of him
[1:10:58] and what he was doing by the power of
[1:11:02] God some point we have to we have to
[1:11:06] move beyond the barrier of our own
[1:11:10] thinking
[1:11:12] yes and move into God's
[1:11:18] thinking Jesus
[1:11:20] said with me all things
[1:11:24] are
[1:11:27] possible I am the vine you are the
[1:11:30] branches without me you can do
[1:11:34] nothing but with
[1:11:36] him all things are possible
[1:11:41] friends you can preach you can teach you
[1:11:44] can testify you can lay hands on the
[1:11:46] sick you can every gift is available in
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:51] body you can have service you can can
[1:11:53] you can you can do anything God leads
[1:11:56] you to do as he empowers you to do it
[1:11:58] because he's ordained for you to do
[1:12:00] something for the kingdom of God to be a
[1:12:04] witness to to serve in your position to
[1:12:06] serve in your place wherever you're at
[1:12:08] God's called you to it and he already
[1:12:11] foresaw you doing
[1:12:13] it we don't have to live in doubt we can
[1:12:16] live in
[1:12:18] faith we know the the famous story of
[1:12:23] Esau and Jacob when we go to this all
[1:12:25] the time when we talk about this subject
[1:12:27] but I I I want to spend a minute here in
[1:12:30] Romans chapter 9 if we could turn to
[1:12:31] Romans chapter 9
[1:12:35] together I think it's fitting that we
[1:12:37] look at this
[1:12:39] again Romans chapter
[1:12:41] 9 verse
[1:12:44] 7 said neither because they are the Seed
[1:12:47] of Abraham are they all children but in
[1:12:48] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[1:12:51] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:12:53] the these are not the children of God
[1:12:55] but the children of Promise are counted
[1:12:57] for seed for the seed for This Is The
[1:12:59] Word of Promise at that this time will I
[1:13:01] come and Sarah shall have a son and not
[1:13:03] only this but when Rebecca also had
[1:13:06] conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:13:08] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:13:10] born neither having done any good or
[1:13:13] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:13:14] to election might stand not of works but
[1:13:17] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[1:13:20] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[1:13:23] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[1:13:26] have I
[1:13:28] hated
[1:13:30] what could Jacob
[1:13:33] do to earn God's love he already had it
[1:13:39] before before he was
[1:13:42] born before he could do good or evil he
[1:13:45] said Jacob have I loved and Esau have I
[1:13:49] hated brother BM tells us and I think
[1:13:52] it's very very
[1:13:54] interesting he says Esau was twice the
[1:13:57] guy that Jacob
[1:14:00] was I love I'm so glad God sent a
[1:14:03] prophet Esau was twice the guy that
[1:14:05] Jacob was when it came to being a man
[1:14:08] taking care of his old blind Daddy and
[1:14:10] everything else and Jacob was a little
[1:14:11] Shyer hung around his mother's apron
[1:14:13] little old boy but God said I love
[1:14:16] Jacob and refuse Esau before either boy
[1:14:19] was born Romans 8 says so that's exactly
[1:14:21] right God knows what's in a man he goes
[1:14:24] on to say in the SMY and church age he
[1:14:27] out of the church age book he says
[1:14:28] before I close this subject I know
[1:14:30] there's a question in your mind you want
[1:14:32] to know if I believe in the doctrine of
[1:14:33] pre-existence I don't believe in the
[1:14:35] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of
[1:14:36] souls any more than I believe in
[1:14:38] reincarnation or the transmigration of
[1:14:40] souls be careful here see this it's not
[1:14:43] the person that comes predestinated
[1:14:45] eternally from God it is the word or
[1:14:48] seed now we're getting to the heart of
[1:14:51] the matter amen God is Not so much
[1:14:53] looking at your flesh he knew what flesh
[1:14:55] you would fall in he knew what color
[1:14:56] eyes you would have he knew what color
[1:14:58] hair but that wasn't it he wasn't
[1:15:23] this that he's looking
[1:15:26] after that's why you can be the sinless
[1:15:29] Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:31] because the seed in the soul never
[1:15:33] sinned in the first place the real you
[1:15:36] that was intended to be you from the
[1:15:37] beginning before it fell into uh into
[1:15:39] corruption before it had to come through
[1:15:41] a tabernacle that was born in corruption
[1:15:43] before all of that you should have come
[1:15:45] the right way in a tabernacle of Flesh
[1:15:47] that had no corruption and then you
[1:15:49] would have never sinned you would have
[1:15:50] never had a problem you would have never
[1:15:52] failed
[1:15:54] yes so what is God
[1:16:16] predestinacion have I loved but Esau
[1:16:19] have I hated and neither was born and
[1:16:22] neither had done good or evil see it was
[1:16:24] the thought and then that thought became
[1:16:27] expressed and God bought back Jacob
[1:16:30] because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone
[1:16:33] had the seed that's why he had respect
[1:16:35] to the birthright and Covenant of God if
[1:16:37] you are true seed you will hear the that
[1:16:41] word the spirit will baptize you into
[1:16:43] the body of Christ filling you and
[1:16:45] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:16:47] word for your day and age see how clear
[1:16:50] the true evidence becomes when the word
[1:16:52] is revealed to you what's he saying why
[1:16:56] was it Jacob wanted the birthright
[1:16:59] because he had a seat of God on the
[1:17:00] inside it wasn't because Jacob you know
[1:17:03] calculated and figured out and did a
[1:17:05] Bible study and no there was something
[1:17:08] else driving him he had to have the
[1:17:10] birthright and even though he got it
[1:17:11] through deception and through means I
[1:17:14] mean sometimes you think how in the
[1:17:15] world can God even honor he was lying to
[1:17:19] his father he was coming in deception to
[1:17:21] get the birthright I he got the
[1:17:24] birthright by not even being very
[1:17:26] generous with his
[1:17:28] brother his brother was starving to the
[1:17:31] point of famishing to the point of
[1:17:33] fainting and dying and he was so hungry
[1:17:35] he said would you give me something to
[1:17:37] eat you think a real Christian a real
[1:17:39] seed of God would just give his brother
[1:17:41] I mean a bowl of lentils how much did
[1:17:43] that cost him yeah but he sees the
[1:17:47] opportunity and said I've got to get the
[1:17:49] birth right because the birth right was
[1:17:50] the lineage of Christ the birth right
[1:17:52] was the promise the birthright was was
[1:17:54] the effect of the word in that day amen
[1:17:57] and he was looking at more than just the
[1:17:59] birthright something in him was driving
[1:18:01] him he had to have it amen just like
[1:18:03] there's something in us that's driving
[1:18:05] us to this word this word is everything
[1:18:07] it's beyond my comprehension beyond my
[1:18:09] understanding not because of study but
[1:18:11] something in me is driving me to
[1:18:14] Christ and you think how can God bless
[1:18:17] Jacob and when he did something like
[1:18:19] that and then when he went to get the
[1:18:20] blessing which he was for ordained to
[1:18:25] receive he does so by lying to his
[1:18:33] father I mean if Jacob was in our church
[1:18:36] I he would probably be under church
[1:18:43] discipline
[1:18:45] right I mean he certainly probably
[1:18:47] wouldn't be your friend after you've
[1:18:50] seen what he
[1:18:51] did to his brother and to his father yes
[1:18:55] and if a man can treat his own family
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:59] way and we know Jacob had to have a
[1:19:02] conversion he had to meet the angel he
[1:19:03] had to be changed is what we we
[1:19:05] understand all of that but the prophet
[1:19:07] of God takes us a little deeper and says
[1:19:09] there was something driving him from the
[1:19:12] inside it was the seat of God it wasn't
[1:19:15] because he was the better man it wasn't
[1:19:17] because he was the nicer it wasn't
[1:19:18] because he was the sweetest it was he
[1:19:20] had all of this in his background he had
[1:19:22] all of this in his past amen and there
[1:19:24] would be an encounter with an angel that
[1:19:26] would change him and he would walk
[1:19:27] differently from then on and all of us
[1:19:29] with all of our past and all of our
[1:19:31] wrongs and all of our conniving we had
[1:19:33] to come and meet the angel of the Lord
[1:19:35] ourselves we had to come in contact with
[1:19:37] Christ himself and had to change our
[1:19:39] walk from that day on and from then that
[1:19:41] day on you don't see him acting that way
[1:19:43] anymore but it didn't change the fact
[1:19:45] that from the very beginning he was
[1:19:46] chosen of God and loved by
[1:19:49] God and Esau was hated Jacob was loved
[1:19:53] Esau was hated and neither one had done
[1:19:55] a good or bad deed oh we got to get
[1:19:58] beyond the human thinking and say God
[1:20:00] I'm so glad that you chose me because I
[1:20:02] had no chance no opportunity no
[1:20:07] way but if you've chose me and you've
[1:20:10] called
[1:20:11] me then I'll do what you called me to do
[1:20:15] I'll be a witness even though I don't
[1:20:16] think I'm a good one I'll testify even
[1:20:19] though I don't think I know how I'll
[1:20:21] Shine the Light even though I think I've
[1:20:23] been too polluted and doo dirty and doo
[1:20:25] corrupted in the past I'll still do it
[1:20:27] yes why because you called me to do it
[1:20:35] yes in John
[1:20:38] 4:4 the Bible says and he must needs go
[1:20:42] through
[1:20:43] Samaria we know this so
[1:20:46] well why did he need to go through
[1:20:49] Samaria what what was drawing him to
[1:20:52] Samaria
[1:20:53] area they had some nice people down
[1:20:55] there that were friendly and sweet and
[1:20:57] were living a good Christian Life
[1:20:59] waiting for the Messiah to
[1:21:01] come no there was a harlot down there a
[1:21:03] prostitute that had lived an unclean
[1:21:06] life she had had five husbands before
[1:21:10] and the one man she was living with now
[1:21:12] was not her own husband it was somebody
[1:21:15] else's but regardless of her
[1:21:20] immorality he had needs to go buy Samar
[1:21:26] listen you were in Samaria I was in
[1:21:30] Samaria and it may not have been
[1:21:32] immorality as far as fornication and
[1:21:35] adultery but we were steeped in
[1:21:38] something we had something and he had
[1:21:42] need go by Samaria not for a nice person
[1:21:46] not for a sweet face not for an
[1:21:49] upstanding citizen he had need to go by
[1:21:52] and and find a predestinated
[1:21:57] seed brother B said and they identified
[1:22:00] Christ of all ages he said now in the
[1:22:03] E bad women and good women can't
[1:22:06] associate together it's different here
[1:22:08] but they can't there she is marked she's
[1:22:10] marked that's all if she ever has the
[1:22:12] wrong husband she ain't no more
[1:22:14] associated with it's all messed together
[1:22:16] here now we find out but there it wasn't
[1:22:19] so she couldn't come with the virgins of
[1:22:21] the morning she had to come about noon
[1:22:23] to get her water so she started to let
[1:22:26] down the water pot but there was a
[1:22:27] predestinated seed in that little woman
[1:22:30] she let down that water pot and she
[1:22:32] heard a man say give me a drink bring me
[1:22:35] a
[1:22:36] drink he knew just when to get to the
[1:22:39] well not when all the clean living
[1:22:42] virgins who have kept them themselves
[1:22:43] not when they showed
[1:22:46] up you know what he wasn't just seeking
[1:22:48] out
[1:22:49] prostitutes it wasn't like he said I
[1:22:52] need to find me a pro no he was seeking
[1:22:54] the predestinated seed regardless of the
[1:22:57] condition if it was a tax collector who
[1:22:59] was corrupt and stealing amen if it was
[1:23:02] a prostitute if it was a religious
[1:23:04] zealot if it was a fisherman if it was
[1:23:06] somebody who had lived good if it was
[1:23:08] somebody who lived bad it didn't matter
[1:23:10] the background it didn't matter the past
[1:23:12] it didn't matter the present condition
[1:23:14] he wasn't seeking them out for any of
[1:23:16] those reasons he was seeking them out
[1:23:18] because there was a seed on the inside
[1:23:20] that had to come to life in that day
[1:23:22] because he had ordained for that seed to
[1:23:24] bear
[1:23:26] fruit and he didn't come to you for any
[1:23:29] other reason he never came your way and
[1:23:31] revealed himself to you for any reason
[1:23:33] but the fact that you were a
[1:23:34] predestinated seed and he didn't call
[1:23:36] you forth just so you could say I was a
[1:23:38] predestinated seed but he has ordained
[1:23:41] you unto good works
[1:23:44] Amen to serve
[1:23:47] him not to feel like you're no good and
[1:23:50] unworthy and can never do something
[1:23:53] that's the
[1:23:54] truth but let's get a Heavenly P
[1:23:57] perspective and hear what the angel
[1:24:00] said we are here yeah we realize what we
[1:24:04] are without Christ absolutely that's
[1:24:07] healthy but we also must realize what we
[1:24:09] are in Christ that's healthy
[1:24:15] too we're weak outside of Christ we're
[1:24:19] Invincible in
[1:24:21] Christ we're helpless outside of Christ
[1:24:24] but we're here to help the world inside
[1:24:26] of Christ we have no answers outside of
[1:24:29] Christ we have all the answers inside of
[1:24:31] Christ Our Life is a paradox it just
[1:24:34] depends on which perspective we choose
[1:24:35] to look from and whether we're going to
[1:24:37] Live From the Inside Man or the outside
[1:24:39] man and it's time to move beyond the
[1:24:41] outside man and Live From the Inside Man
[1:24:44] understanding that the outside man is
[1:24:46] nothing but by the grace of God I am
[1:24:50] what I
[1:24:51] am
[1:24:54] praise
[1:24:57] God uh there was an
[1:24:59] interview that brother Brenham did he
[1:25:02] did lots of private interviews but to
[1:25:03] the best of my understanding there's
[1:25:05] only ever one that's been
[1:25:07] recorded and I may be wrong on that but
[1:25:09] I don't I don't know that I am at least
[1:25:12] in the table I only see one and and and
[1:25:15] of all the hundreds and maybe thousands
[1:25:19] of interviews private interviews brother
[1:25:20] brandham did I think it's amazing God
[1:25:22] only allowed one to come through to
[1:25:24] us and I think for our sakes here today
[1:25:28] this must have been the most important
[1:25:30] one not that others weren't important
[1:25:32] and that God didn't answer important
[1:25:34] questions in them and he didn't help
[1:25:35] people but there must be a reason why
[1:25:38] God allowed this private interview to
[1:25:40] slip through it must be something we
[1:25:42] need today and you know it as the
[1:25:44] private interview with sister Bruce
[1:25:47] sister Georgia Bruce and I'm not going
[1:25:48] to read all of it I'm just going to read
[1:25:50] a few excerts out of it amen because it
[1:25:52] help helped me so much and sister Bruce
[1:25:54] is so much like most of us she's so in
[1:25:57] tune with her failure she's so in tune
[1:26:00] with her mistakes and she comes and
[1:26:02] she's sick and she's in need of healing
[1:26:04] but that's not her main concern she
[1:26:06] comes because she needs to be prayed
[1:26:08] for but she says brother brandom most of
[1:26:12] all I want the experience that I've been
[1:26:14] sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will
[1:26:17] reveal it to your
[1:26:19] heart she wants to know that she's right
[1:26:22] with God and that she's she's she goes I
[1:26:26] want the experience that I've been
[1:26:27] sealed in the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost and she wants God to reveal it to
[1:26:31] brother Brandon she wants to know she's
[1:26:35] in this private interview CU she's sick
[1:26:36] she has a heart condition she's going to
[1:26:38] die if God doesn't heal her and this is
[1:26:40] one of her main questions and brother B
[1:26:43] says I believe with all my heart that
[1:26:45] you are a real born-again believer
[1:26:46] sister
[1:26:48] Bruce I love
[1:26:50] that he just just immediately Comforts
[1:26:54] her and then he goes to explain why
[1:26:57] she's
[1:26:59] wavering he doesn't dechristianize her
[1:27:01] he doesn't tell her she's of little
[1:27:03] faith he
[1:27:04] doesn't he starts to explain to her that
[1:27:07] she'll understand why she she's having
[1:27:12] problems says he he first he says I
[1:27:14] believe with all my heart that you are a
[1:27:16] real born- again believer sister Bruce
[1:27:19] how could that Spirit just
[1:27:21] leave then here's the explanation when
[1:27:24] you get sick you get weary and you're a
[1:27:27] nervous type
[1:27:29] person and sister Bruce says yes I'm so
[1:27:33] thankful brother brandom can deal with
[1:27:35] people where they're
[1:27:36] at and not requiring everybody's the
[1:27:39] same
[1:27:41] way some people struggle with the
[1:27:43] question of unworthiness and God can
[1:27:45] never use some of us don't that some of
[1:27:47] us worry and get nervous some of us
[1:27:49] don't but here's a sister who when she
[1:27:51] gets gets sick she gets weary she gets
[1:27:54] nervous and she says yes and you get
[1:27:58] things on your mind see little bitty
[1:28:00] things and it just keeps building up
[1:28:03] both ways he's talking about in the
[1:28:05] positive and the negative you'll get
[1:28:06] somebody on your heart you want to pray
[1:28:08] for them get up and pray for it you
[1:28:10] can't rest till you get that person
[1:28:11] prayed for that's you then take on the
[1:28:14] other side Satan Maybe Might present
[1:28:16] something to you and and out this way
[1:28:20] and then you're a nature and God works
[1:28:22] and Satan works and then Satan tries to
[1:28:25] make you believe that you are not see
[1:28:28] you keep building this and maybe this
[1:28:31] and this and what brother R is saying is
[1:28:33] because you're a nervous type person God
[1:28:36] uses that but the Satan tries to take
[1:28:37] advantage of that too and you get
[1:28:39] something on your mind and you can't get
[1:28:41] it off your heart and if God puts on
[1:28:43] your heart somebody to pray for you just
[1:28:44] can't rest till you get up and pray for
[1:28:46] that person but then the devil puts into
[1:28:49] your heart that maybe you're not maybe
[1:28:52] you're not born again maybe you're not
[1:28:53] right with God and then he and this is
[1:28:56] what he says
[1:28:59] then then he tries to make you believe
[1:29:01] that you're not you keep building this
[1:29:03] and maybe this and this she keeps
[1:29:05] thinking and adding reasons why maybe
[1:29:08] she's not has anybody ever done that
[1:29:14] before he said see don't look at
[1:29:17] yourself sister
[1:29:18] Bruce you're looking at the wrong
[1:29:21] picture
[1:29:23] you're looking at the
[1:29:25] corruptible you're looking at what was
[1:29:27] swn in corruption you're looking at the
[1:29:30] Hybrid you're looking at the result of
[1:29:33] the
[1:29:34] Fall you're looking at the one we
[1:29:36] struggle with you're looking at your
[1:29:37] worst
[1:29:38] enemy don't look at yourself look at
[1:29:42] Christ and what he purchased for
[1:29:48] you so brother B begins to talk about
[1:29:51] praying he's trying trying to build her
[1:29:52] faith and he goes in a little bit sort
[1:29:54] to explain to her how he's not worthy to
[1:29:57] pray for her but but but God has made
[1:30:00] him worthy he said me being a sinner I'm
[1:30:02] not worthy he says but the blood of
[1:30:05] Christ and under the blood of Christ I'm
[1:30:06] not a sinner
[1:30:09] anymore so he's talking about praying
[1:30:11] for he says he says now but I come to
[1:30:14] represent him I'm not him but I come to
[1:30:16] represent him but remember me being a
[1:30:18] sinner and before God I'm not a sinner
[1:30:21] neither are you we got a blood sacrifice
[1:30:23] laying there God don't even see us he
[1:30:25] hears our voice but he sees the blood of
[1:30:27] Christ that's it see he sees the blood
[1:30:29] of his own son it's our voice Christ's
[1:30:32] blood then it's Christ that's talking
[1:30:34] through us to God so therefore we're not
[1:30:37] Sinners no more we are
[1:30:40] Christian and he says again I believe
[1:30:42] you to be a genuine Christian
[1:30:46] woman and listen how strong this battle
[1:30:49] is after he says that she says I make so
[1:30:52] many mistakes and I fail so many times
[1:30:57] you see the war that's raging in her
[1:31:00] mind and this is what he says that's why
[1:31:04] Christ had to die so that you with your
[1:31:07] mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you see
[1:31:10] he took your mistakes your desire in
[1:31:12] your heart is to serve him and she says
[1:31:15] yes said all right that's what he died
[1:31:18] for so you could serve him your mist
[1:31:21] Stakes are not looked not lotted to you
[1:31:24] he's your propitiation he's your sin
[1:31:26] offering your sins are not known you're
[1:31:29] not a sinner before God Christ took your
[1:31:31] sins became you because your desire is
[1:31:34] to serve
[1:31:37] him why did Christ die so that I could
[1:31:40] serve him with all my mistakes with all
[1:31:44] my fails with all my weaknesses he died
[1:31:46] to cover all of that so that I could
[1:31:48] serve
[1:31:49] him and then this this is what sister
[1:31:52] Bruce says
[1:31:54] next but I've never had an experience
[1:31:57] that I've been filled with the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost that I could put my foot on it's
[1:32:01] not that she didn't have an experience
[1:32:03] it doesn't that she wasn't filled with
[1:32:04] the Holy Ghost is that she had nothing
[1:32:06] that she could put her foot on she
[1:32:07] didn't have anything tangible that she
[1:32:09] could go back and put her foot
[1:32:11] on he said all right notice this
[1:32:13] ordinarily a human being is born in sin
[1:32:15] shaped in iniquity come through the
[1:32:17] world speaking lies that's the nature of
[1:32:19] a human being Sister Bruce says yes he
[1:32:22] said that was your nature it changed
[1:32:25] once but what changed it she says
[1:32:30] Christ he said there you are sister
[1:32:33] that's
[1:32:35] it that's the answer what's the answer
[1:32:38] that's the answer you come into this
[1:32:41] world one way but something happened to
[1:32:43] every one of us who've been born again
[1:32:45] by the spirit of God something changed
[1:32:47] that that nature that was rebellious our
[1:32:49] heart wanted to go our own way something
[1:32:51] changed us what changed us it was Christ
[1:32:54] he goes there you
[1:32:56] are she was tangled up in her mind she
[1:32:59] was struggling not because she hadn't
[1:33:01] lived a Christian Life brother Brenham
[1:33:03] tells her he says as far as I know
[1:33:05] there's nothing in your life and it's if
[1:33:07] it is God's hid it from me but I as your
[1:33:09] Shepherd have watched your life sister
[1:33:11] and you're a genuine true Christian she
[1:33:14] had been living for years as a Christian
[1:33:16] but she has this weakness in her flesh
[1:33:18] that when she gets sick when she gets
[1:33:19] weary she gets nervous and the devil
[1:33:21] starts putting thoughts in her mind and
[1:33:23] she starts adding this to this to this
[1:33:25] and she just starts to believe that
[1:33:27] maybe she's not it but brother bram's
[1:33:29] here confirming you're a genuine
[1:33:30] Christian I believe you to be born of
[1:33:32] the spirit and she's still debating with
[1:33:34] the
[1:33:36] prophet amen you would think that you
[1:33:38] would go sit in a private interview with
[1:33:39] brother Brandon and you say I just don't
[1:33:41] have I I don't know I want to experience
[1:33:43] I've been filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:33:44] says I believe you to be a genuine
[1:33:46] Christian sister Bruce I believe you to
[1:33:47] be really a born- again Christian you be
[1:33:49] like amen and walk away no she's going
[1:33:51] but and again he says but look it's your
[1:33:54] desires your desires is right and Christ
[1:33:56] died for but but this and this but but I
[1:34:00] make so many mistakes that's why Christ
[1:34:02] died but I don't have any definite
[1:34:03] experience I put my foot on but listen
[1:34:05] you've changed Heaven you yes who Chang
[1:34:07] you Christ what is it that's it just
[1:34:11] move on Amen just trust God just serve
[1:34:14] God and believe what God has done for
[1:34:17] us amen the devil tries to keep us on
[1:34:22] first
[1:34:24] base all the time stuck on first base I
[1:34:28] don't know this and I don't know that
[1:34:30] listen if there's not been a change in
[1:34:32] your life if you've never encountered
[1:34:33] God you seek God until something
[1:34:35] dramatic Something Something Real has
[1:34:37] happened in your life do you know
[1:34:39] something changed in you something broke
[1:34:41] away something old and something new has
[1:34:43] come to life and you just keep serving
[1:34:45] God from that day on but don't go back
[1:34:48] and readdress it and readdress it and
[1:34:50] readdress it and re dressing amen you're
[1:34:52] going to be stuck what God wants us to
[1:34:54] do is go on into adoption amen move from
[1:34:57] there all the way up into maturity to
[1:34:59] take a position to serve God to be his
[1:35:01] witness on this
[1:35:04] Earth we've got to have an experience
[1:35:06] but the experience is a changed life yes
[1:35:09] that's right we've got to move from
[1:35:11] there there's work for us to do there's
[1:35:14] things for us to accomplish there's
[1:35:15] works that he wants to do in our Liv
[1:35:17] we're ordained to do something for the
[1:35:19] kingdom of God and we've got to have
[1:35:21] faith that if God ordained me to do it I
[1:35:23] can do
[1:35:25] it not me but Christ that dwelleth in me
[1:35:29] I want to read one more scripture and
[1:35:31] then we'll we'll stop for tonight 1
[1:35:33] Corinthians let's turn to First
[1:35:38] Corinthians chapter
[1:35:49] 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 vers
[1:35:57] 26 in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 26
[1:36:00] it says for you see your calling
[1:36:03] Brethren how that not many wise men
[1:36:05] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[1:36:08] noble are called but God ha chosen the
[1:36:11] foolish things of the world to confound
[1:36:13] the wise and God chosen the weak things
[1:36:15] of the world to confound the things
[1:36:17] which are Mighty and the base things of
[1:36:20] the world and the things which are
[1:36:21] despised have God chosen yay in the
[1:36:23] things which are not to bring to not
[1:36:25] things that are that no flesh should
[1:36:28] glory in his presence but of him are you
[1:36:32] in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto
[1:36:34] us wisdom and righteousness and
[1:36:37] sanctification and Redemption that
[1:36:39] according as it is written he that
[1:36:41] glorieth let him glory in the
[1:36:44] Lord amen let's all
[1:36:47] stand if we Glory let's glory in the
[1:36:50] Lord
[1:36:51] because it's not what I've done but it's
[1:36:54] what he's ordained and it's not what I'm
[1:36:56] doing but what Christ is doing in me he
[1:37:00] hasn't chose many mighty many powerful
[1:37:04] many great think about the prophet he
[1:37:07] chose in the end
[1:37:09] time he chose a man with a seventh grade
[1:37:13] education whose daddy was a bootlegger
[1:37:16] whose parents were
[1:37:17] Sinners is that what he chose yes he
[1:37:20] chose was uneducated unrefined
[1:37:23] unsophisticated and when God called him
[1:37:25] into the ministry amen he was a lineman
[1:37:28] for the power company and he worked as a
[1:37:30] game
[1:37:31] warden when he chose the man to have the
[1:37:34] Keys of the Kingdom he was a
[1:37:36] fisherman when he chose a temp maker a
[1:37:39] fisherman a tax
[1:37:42] collector my goodness why couldn't he
[1:37:45] use you and me why wouldn't he use you
[1:37:48] and I if it's always been the hard
[1:37:51] Harlot and the poorest in manasse and
[1:37:53] the least in the family if it was the
[1:37:55] youngest Shepherd boy it was it was the
[1:37:58] little comely shepher boy what makes us
[1:38:00] think that he can't use us amen what
[1:38:02] gets us what makes us think that we're
[1:38:04] so low down or we're so backward or
[1:38:06] we're so defeated or we're so weak my
[1:38:08] goodness he takes the weak things to
[1:38:10] confound the strong he takes the things
[1:38:12] that are based to confound the things
[1:38:14] that are Mighty if we think we're
[1:38:16] nothing then I'm eligible to be used by
[1:38:18] God to confound the world
[1:38:22] amen amen when God called me to preach I
[1:38:25] was an air compressor
[1:38:28] mechanic most people don't even know
[1:38:30] what an air compressor mechanic is
[1:38:31] there's so few in the world but I come
[1:38:33] home from work every day from Grease
[1:38:35] from from my head to my toe I took
[1:38:37] toolbox in and I fix stuff every day
[1:38:40] amen I I got through high school because
[1:38:43] I went to vocational school I was so
[1:38:44] bored with school I went to vocational
[1:38:46] school for electronics to get through
[1:38:48] school I'm a second semester College
[1:38:50] Drop drop
[1:38:53] out they say you have any college
[1:38:55] education I say yes I made it through
[1:38:56] the first
[1:38:57] semester I have a little college
[1:39:00] education but God it's it's none of that
[1:39:03] is what he's looking
[1:39:05] for he's just looking for a willing
[1:39:07] vessel that he can take and despite all
[1:39:11] the past tragedy and all the failures
[1:39:14] and all the weakness that he can take
[1:39:16] that and do things that will confound
[1:39:18] everybody around us amen amen
[1:39:21] nobody could preach like brother
[1:39:23] brandham that's right has seventh grade
[1:39:26] education if God can do that for that
[1:39:28] man what can he do for you and
[1:39:30] I if God could take that man around and
[1:39:33] around the world with healing campaigns
[1:39:35] if he could preach the thousands out of
[1:39:37] time if he could have half a million
[1:39:38] people in a meeting if he could have
[1:39:40] 30,000 conversions in one setting and he
[1:39:43] coming out of Kentucky he was despised
[1:39:45] and rejected with no formal education
[1:39:47] and no support why can't God use me to
[1:39:50] witness to my neighbor why can't God
[1:39:51] shine his light through me where I work
[1:39:53] why can't God use me to bless my
[1:39:55] brothers and sisters why can't I serve
[1:39:57] some place in the body what's different
[1:40:00] there's no difference we have to get
[1:40:01] past our own thinking and allow God to
[1:40:04] be God and allow God to have a purpose
[1:40:05] in our life because I tell you if you're
[1:40:08] a c Gene of God I'll tell you this
[1:40:10] before he formed you in the belly of
[1:40:12] your mother he knew you and he ordained
[1:40:14] you to be something in this world to be
[1:40:17] his witness to be his bride I say God
[1:40:21] God help me get past my own limited
[1:40:24] vision and let me see the way you
[1:40:27] see I want to be like
[1:40:30] Gideon though I'm least and though I'm
[1:40:33] the less you can do something through me
[1:40:36] that I can never do myself say God help
[1:40:39] us man let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:40:42] together dear heavenly father we thank
[1:40:45] you Lord Jesus for this day you've given
[1:40:47] us God we thank you for the reflection
[1:40:50] and the memory of what you did through
[1:40:52] our brother
[1:40:53] Steve God we're all
[1:40:55] benefactors of a brother that you
[1:40:57] ordained to serve
[1:40:59] you but God he wasn't the only one that
[1:41:03] was ordained to serve the body ordained
[1:41:06] to do a work that you've called us to in
[1:41:07] this age but God you've ordained each
[1:41:10] one of us to
[1:41:11] something to be a witness to be a light
[1:41:14] to serve a
[1:41:15] purpose and the devil would love Lord to
[1:41:19] trip us up and cause us to make mistakes
[1:41:22] and feel ourselves incapable and unable
[1:41:26] and
[1:41:28] unworthy but God you answered the
[1:41:30] worthiness question when you hung on
[1:41:32] Calvary we're not worthy by our Merit
[1:41:36] but by your
[1:41:37] choosing and those who you chose you
[1:41:39] shed Your Precious Blood to cleanse to
[1:41:43] clean to free from the bondage of sin
[1:41:47] youve set us free Lord free to serve
[1:41:51] free to work free to move forward in
[1:41:54] this great
[1:41:56] gospel God I pray those that struggle
[1:41:59] with these questions those that struggle
[1:42:01] to
[1:42:02] believe that they are precious in your
[1:42:04] sight that they are accepted in the
[1:42:06] Beloved that they have a purpose in this
[1:42:08] life and that that you've given them
[1:42:10] something to do I pray that you would
[1:42:12] break through that now Lord just break
[1:42:15] that yoke break through that barrier
[1:42:17] Lord so that we can come to see
[1:42:20] ourselves the the way you see us that we
[1:42:22] can move forward by your grace Lord not
[1:42:26] because we're
[1:42:27] worthy as the Apostle Paul would say
[1:42:30] Lord not I'm not worthy to be an
[1:42:34] apostle by the grace of God I am what I
[1:42:37] am God I pray that you go to each heart
[1:42:39] right now and you would awaken the
[1:42:42] reality of your call in our

[1:42:47] your bride I'm not worthy to shine your
[1:42:48] light I'm not worthy to carry your truth
