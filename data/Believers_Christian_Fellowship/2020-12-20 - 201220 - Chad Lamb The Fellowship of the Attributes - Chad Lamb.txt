[Music] and say that we love low and help us [Music] we want to see [Music] oh [Music] thou art good i am why [Music] praise the lord man let's all take our bibles where we're standing let's look to first john pleasure to be with you we appreciate the atmosphere and appreciate each one being here as we just look into the word i i'd like to take for a title today the fellowship of the attributes the fellowship of the attributes and i'd like to jump back to where we were last sunday and kind of do a little bit of review and maybe move a little bit forward but i want to really capture this thought and i don't want to go too fast and breeze too fast through it so if you allow me just a little bit of time to readdress that first john chapter 1 verse 5. this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not to truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin let's ask the lord's blessing over the reading of the word lord jesus we thank you that we can once again be here lord that we can gather in this fashion lord with our brothers and sisters and all we've sung lord we've sung praises and worship to you and you told us that you abide in the praises of your people lord we believe that you're here because your word says wherever two or three are gathered in your name you'll be in their midst and i pray now you would find welcome here lord that we receive you lord in the way that you come that you would find a welcome in us lord that we would listen to your word and hear it lord that you would feed us by your own hand that we might grow stronger in this day and age that we live open our eyes lord that we might see and give us a heart to perceive and receive all of your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated i would like to keep looking at the scripture for just a minute and i want to look at verse six if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light this is a super important scripture that we catch and understand this as we walk in the light as he is in the light so that's present tense current light amen and that light is the revealed word for our day for the day and age that we live in that is light amen the revealed word for our day is light so we must walk in the light as he is in the light amen so let's read that again but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another so we realize without this revealed word amen walking in the light of the revealed word we do not even have fellowship with each other there's not even there's not even a basis for fellowship outside this revealed word you know because sometimes a lot of things gets called fellowship that's not fellowship and and there are things that are not wrong i mean there's a lot of things that we do when we get together and visit with one another and catch up that's not fellowship but it's also not bad you know it's not wicked to find out how works going for a brother and how the family is doing and things like that we should know about each other and love each other that's part of the family of god but when we really get down to fellowship fellowship is not just dinner fellowship is is not just volleyball it's not getting together for games or for recreation fellowship is walking in the light as he is and the light will give us fellowship with one another because we are children of the light and the children of the light can only fellowship in the light of the age that they live in so let's read this again but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin so the cleansing the cleansing of the blood is in the washing of the water by the word amen brother brahm ties those things together it's by the washing of the water by the word because we're sanctified by the spirit which is the life that was in that blood amen and if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from all sin so it's imperative that the that the children of god walk in the light of god that's why it's so important to preach the revelation the hour and preached the prophet's message amen there's no way there's no way to reconcile anybody back to god without this word amen it's an impossibility you can get somebody's heart turned towards a historical jesus and i know i don't say that derogatory i don't mean that bad in any way so just hang with me you can get their heart turned to the story of what god's done and how god has always worked and brought us through and how god has paid the price of redemption but the way to get them reconciled back to god is to bring him to the word for their day because that's who he is he is the word he is the revealed word so we have we have to preach the gospel the good news what is the good news the message of the hour it is the good news so i want to look at this word fellowship just for a minute we have fellowship one with another and this fellowship in the greek it's interpreted many different ways fellowship communion communication and as they give definitions at the bottom say fellowship association a community a communion a joint pers uh participation the share which one has in anything participation so if we have fellowship with one another it's something that we're joining in and we have a part in and a participation in and so this walking in the light as he isn't a lie will give us fellowship with one another because we become part of we have a share in we begin to participate in the same thing that's what fellowship is friends it's participating in this same thing together let's turn over to first corinthians chapter 1. first corinthians chapter 1 and verse 9. god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord so you're not called to the fellowship of a church you're not called to the fellowship but you're called to the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord you're called to that joint participation you have a share in that you're part of that community amen the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord so i want to i want to read this is a little bit of review here but i want to read from satan's eden it says now that's the way god was in the beginning every son of god and every daughter of god was in god at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there he knowed it and he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you and love you and shake your hands this is an amazing statement god had a plan and god had a desire and part of that desire amen in his thoughts we'd be we were sons and daughters of god we were attributes of him in his thinking before the foundation of the world but he wanted a further manifestation amen for another level of fellowship together amen so god in his thinking we know his thoughts or his attributes and his attributes god wanted fellowship with the attributes in the message spiritual amnesia he says now to be a true christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was i'm identified with him i'm identified with him notice he is in me and i in him notice then every christian that's a real genuine christian was with him when the morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the mortal in the immortal realms with god 10 million years before the world was ever formed i was back there with him if i got eternal life i was there with him i was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy question is were you there amen if you were there you had fellowship with god before they meant and god's great desire was fellowship to be a family to have fellowship with his attributes and he had fellowship with the attributes in his thinking and he wanted another expression and more fellowship in the other expression so this is really important this is why god is doing what he's doing friends it's when when we have by the message of the hour the ability to go back amen that's why i enjoyed brother tell us the song it was very timely amen we go back further back amen go back before the story started on earth and back before the fall in the garden of eden back before the war in heaven to go back and realize that god had a desire and that desire god had was to have fellowship with his attributes amen and so he was going to he was going to divide himself up now now these are just human terms because god divide himself up makes him no less god amen it's not like he portions a piece off here and now there's only 60 percent of god 30 over there god's not changing amen how he does it i don't quite understand but god is is his attributes a portion of himself he's going to have come out in a manifestation to unite back with himself because that's what he wants so your existing started not when your mom and dad got married amen not when your birth certificate announced your arrival amen but your existence started back there when you had fellowship before with god now remember the basis of fellowship amen with one another is walking in the light as he is in the light amen god is so good now we were there now if you can say from the bottom of your heart i was there like i don't understand it amen i don't comprehend it i don't remember it amen but there's some witness in my heart that says that's the truth amen i believe what the prophet's saying amen i see that that is true amen then what on earth do you have to worry about friends what problem will take you what thing is there that's too big that's not going to be handled what's not already been addressed in the mind of god you were there before amen your destination is secure your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and it was sealed and that seal wasn't removed to the end time and the only time that the seal was removed was not to put your name in jeopardy but to give you a revelation of who you really are so you were secure from before the foundation of the world and your security didn't change at the opening of the seals the opening of the seals was to show you how secure you've always been so now why do we cower so much when the devil begins to fume and when the devil begins to threaten and begins to stomp and scare us with symptoms and scare us with circumstances amen why is it we cower so badly i mean we've got to stop acting like i mean so i'm acting like we just existed here on this earth and we only have capacity as human beings we've got to realize where we came from where we're going and who's in charge and control these circumstances are nothing outside the mind of god these things these afflictions these symptoms amen they're not beyond god's knowledge and god had a plan before the foundation of the world and it wasn't for me to be a loser it was for him to overcome through me because he's got a goal in mind and he had a goal in mind from before the foundation amen when i was a thought in his mind he showed us the goal and we rejoiced and sang and shouted and clapped our hands amen that's why brother ben tells that story we told last sunday about about the old preacher event in mishawaka said you don't have room for me to preach he says you call this this is a quote that brother quotes this preacher this old preacher 90 some years old he says you say i got this new religion he said it's the oldest religion there is this singing shouting clapping dancing religion started all the way back in the mind of god when the sons of god shouted for joy hey amen that enthusiasm you have now it's not new friends this revelation that's coming forth that's stirring your heart and making you a thrilled and shouting amen and clapping your hands amen it's not new it's old actually it's not even old it's eternal it didn't have a time it began it didn't have a start amen it was always there and when god was was fellowshipping with his attributes in his mind now i know that sounds funny but we're going to read some quotes so you can understand what i'm saying amen when god was fellowshipping with the attributes in his mind you were one of those attributes and it's not so much the material out of the earth that you're made of now that'll be redeemed that'll be the vessel that this attribute lives in but it's the attribute the seed the german god the gene of god the portion of the word the part of the life i mean brother man there's so many terms for that don't get caught up in terms what it is is a part of god a part of that life a part of that word a part of that thought and that was you amen and that's the genuine you that's the real you that was to be you and what brings such confusion is hybridization in the fall because now what was to be you this was supposed to be the whole regulating force of you of your triune being you were supposed to be you were supposed to have a soul with this germ of life in it amen you were supposed to have a theophany body or a theophany spirit that was perfect and a body that was not fallen so everything was in harmony amen but because of the fall of man amen now your outer man is in disharmony with your inner man and that's what creates so much confusion because it all depends on what you identify with i mean if you identify with the outer man then you're no good and you're not worthy and you're not capable and how could he choose me and oh mia me a worthlessness and me a worthless dad i don't see how god could choose me well he didn't wake up in the morning and say um him her him her i don't know some days yes some days no but that's exactly how we act and when we ask questions like that how could he choose me i mean there's nothing wrong with that realization that the outer man is worthless amen cannot attain to god cannot get it right and there's a there's a hopelessness and a despair when looking at the outer man and there's nothing wrong with that because it brings the right kind of humility but if we stay there we never realized that it wasn't based off conduct merit performance outerman anything it was based off his forward knowledge because he knew what ground what dirt his his seed was going to land in and that was what was predestinated that germ of life was what was predestinated and so that's the part that he sees is perfect that's the part that he's redeeming back but god in his mind wanted us in a triune being because god is manifest in a triune being and he wants his attributes manifest in a triune being and he wants fellowship and triune beings why brother chad i don't know but that's what he does that's what he wants that's the way he wants it and so that was foiled that plan was foiled it was it went into corruption in the garden but god is bringing it back because that was his purpose from the beginning so so many times we hear we we defy our own faith by the words that come out of our mouth we identify with the fallen creature and we don't identify with the seed gene of god amen and like i said before there's nothing wrong with the right understanding that i in my flesh and in my mind am incapable that should always be a part of our understanding if not we'll get lifted up in pride we'll have too much self-confidence and we will get flattened so there's a good healthy dose of of of an inability in the outer man and it's healthy to understand that me as a person me as a human being me as this creature the outer man realm i'm i'm just toast i'm finished that's why you can say god without you i can do nothing i can never get it right i will never get it right i've never been able to get it right amen but i'm so glad that before the foundation you saw that it would become right and you made every you made every everything that needed to be fixed you fixed and everything that needed to be set you set and everything that need to be tuned you tuned so that we could get there because you knew i couldn't do it that's why he came to abraham with an unconditional covenant because no conditional covenant with human beings was going to work so he come with an unconditional covenant because it was the only way that god can guarantee the promise to the seed was to make it unconditional not you if you do i will but i have already done it let's go on here serpent seed and from 1958 he says dear god the great and mighty god who formed all things by the power of spirit and has brought jesus christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back into his marvelous fellowship that we have again with god we had a marvelous fellowship and he wants to reconcile us back to fellowship that we have again with god as we are taught in the blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when god in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through jesus he had we had fellowship with him as attributes in his thinking before the foundation of the world and the only way to have fellowship restored is to come to the light to the present day light and the present day light will restore us to fellowship that we had with him amen and we live listen we live in such a special time i know we talk about 2020 and the world falling apart in chaos but this as far as the gospel is concerned is the most special time that we've ever had on the face of the earth who else besides us knew what was going on in the mind of god before the foundation of the world who else had such a security amen who else had such an understanding of what went wrong in the garden what went wrong in heaven what he's doing to restore it all and how secure the whole thing is at the opening of the seals nobody no other generation has had what we have so the world's falling apart let it fall apart amen there's something better that's been opened to me amen i'm not putting stock in this world anymore because i realize that i've got a greater inheritance amen that everything that i'm walking on will belong to me as a joint heir one day and i don't want it this way anyhow buy a piece of land i wanted this and i want to go i i don't want any of this the way it is it's rotten it's karate man it's it's degrading itself day by day amen but everything that was made by god amen is going to be renovated by the by fire amen and i will become a possessor of this earth a joint heir of the whole thing so if it all goes away amen of tomorrow amen the laws change and we lose privileges and they take things away so what this isn't the one that i'm hoping for anymore amen the opening of the seals the opening of the word has brought such a revelation amen that the devil should be losing his ability to trouble us you know we we like i said before we say things we ought not to say and we identify with the wrong realm and it's habit because we've done it all of our existence on earth all of our lives in this flesh we've identified with this outer man but but the prophet of god says such marvelous things to us and in fact when he said i quoted before but he said you've never really seen me oh praise god amen amen i can say the same thing you've never really seen me you've only seen the vessel the tent the tabernacle that i've got a temporary dwelling in so if it goes it goes let it go but i don't want it anymore defy the revelation of the word by identifying with the outer realm and saying things that i shouldn't say but i with all my heart want to say what the word says and what this revelation of the hour the way it describes me is the way i want to be described in the way i want to believe i want to identify with what the messenger has taught i don't want to identify what what the devil is trying to to condemn with me with or trying to uh point out in flaws and in failures you know because i realize i never did it in the first place but the prophet said he may have a rap sheet a mile long but the prophet of god said you never did it in the first place he said he said you come into this world married to that of no fault of your own you were trapped into it i say thank you lord thank you lord that i can throw all of that away and say i never did in the first place because in the first place i was in the mind of god in the first place i was one of those attributes shouting and dancing and rejoicing at the plan of god in the first place the first thought he had the first desire was not this form and i'm going back to the first place i will go back to that first place to that original condition in the mind of god what he wanted what he thought will become materialized and i am going to move to that place what's going to move there whatever this life is inside of me that he's designated to be me is going to move there you can call it whatever you want to call it brother calls it lots of things i don't always know what to call it but at the part of god that he that he designated to be me my portion now i want to read a quote out of the smyrnan church age i'm trying to hold back and go slow so that we can just really understand what the prophet's saying and not just understand what he's saying but the implication it should have in our lives that's the thing that i get so troubled with with myself is it takes absolutely nothing nothing to get me so bothered and so troubled and so despondent and discouraged and depressed and and wondering what's wrong and why everything's falling apart and i and i'm like what is wrong with me amen we've had a message like no other time on the face either to give us a true identity what am i worried about nothing is wrong everything is fine and i want to stay with that revelation and the implication of that revelation so that i quit getting tossed about tossed to and fro with every wind of trouble and every wind of discouragement and every every difficulty amen i want to stay with the word so that i can keep marching forward and that he can overcome through me because i'm not i'm not i'm not circumventing my own success by all the words that i say and all the things that i allow the the stay in my mind i want to just believe what he's taught us in this day and what the scriptures say about us in the spartan church age out of the church age book he says now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9. this is one of the most amazing to me it's one of the most amazing scriptures that he purposed this in himself that means he didn't ask your opinion he didn't check with you first he didn't wait to see how you would do he already purposed in himself that this is what he's going to do he chose us in him before the foundation of the world according to his own will he purposed it within himself he has already determined it and he is not going to change his mind and it doesn't matter how many times my mind changes doesn't matter how confused i get or how many times this belief passes through my mind his purpose his plan his will is not changing oh praise god and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was take a bride of his own choosing oh the heart purpose of god the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing now we all say amen that's the truth but i want to ask you are you a bride of his own choosing you as an individual has he chose you has he given you the revelation of his choosing do you know that your name was on that book before the foundation of the world that you're part of that bride that he chose amen that's the revelation we need to overcome in this hour not just say yeah the bride was chosen yeah there was names on the book but say my name was on that book before the foundation world i was in his mind he chose me according to his own purpose and he's not going to lose me he's not going to leave me behind he's not going to throw me away but he's going to fulfill his purpose and i just want to believe it his heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at the time only potentially god and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts i want you to catch this she was existing in his thoughts amen this isn't he's going to go on to say this i'll just read more because i'm going to mess it up she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal if you can see this you will see many things say lord let me see this let me see this so that i can see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his abilities so therefore he he as god must be omniscient if he is an omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometimes he will be but that is not scripture he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of god now i'm not even going to try to explain how that works because i i only have a human brain and understand as a man but god's is not his thinking is not like our thinking his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts is what he says so his thoughts are not like a man so we cannot even we cannot even relate to this in our human existence but god it says she the bride she was existing in his thoughts listen friends she was there in existence real eternal not a fleeting thought that you you know i have thoughts all the time and five minutes later i'm like what was that i was just thinking about it i can't remember i should have wrote it down i've lost that thought amen that's not how god's thoughts are but god's thoughts are a part of himself you understand god's thoughts are a part of his being amen it's not like us we can have a thought and a thought passes through our mind that didn't come from us that happens all the time but god's not like that god's thoughts are a part of himself and when he had these thoughts these eternal thoughts of his bride amen this was his eternal purpose to have a bride of his own choosing and these thoughts existed in his mind before time so you can say if i am one of those thoughts i existed and before the foundation of the world because they are real they are eternal they're not fleeting they're not an imagination they they are they are real they are eternal they are existing now we're just going to have to accept that because i don't think any of us can understand it or explain it and if you can explain it come see me later because i don't have a clue how to explain that but something in me says amen it's the only way it's the only way that this can work because men will fail every time it's the only way friends in the message possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial he says and remember if you never was in god's thoughts you'll never be with god how many knows that he was a redeemer well then anything redeemed has to come back to where it fell from so if he come to redeem us how could he was one time didn't was one time didn't have to be redeemed one time you didn't have to be redeemed but now you have to be redeemed that means you were in a position or a place that didn't need redemption at one point but now you need redemption so god and redemption is going to bring you back to that place where you don't need redemption praise god at one time didn't have to be redeemed and we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies it shows that the real christian is an attribute of god's thinking before there was a world or a star or air or anything else it's eternal and he come to redeem us back it's god's thoughts spoken to a word made manifest and brought back to his thought that's redemption brought back to his thought what he was thinking of what he desired in 1965 and the message leaned not to thine own understanding he said so you see if you were in the foreknowledge of god then you are becoming a part of god in the only way you can be a son of god or a daughter of god you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete without you i want you to understand this i want to understand i should say i want to understand this better because god isn't complete without you because whatever that thought was that was existing that was real that was eternal that thought has moved down into me so listen this this is showing us how real those thoughts are it was a thought but that thought that portion of god that attribute of god that gene of god that germ of god that thought that word whatever that thought was predestinated to be in me and that part is in me and it is the true me and now without that part god is incomplete so how real is that thought it's pretty real so now without that portion that's that that is in your soul without that portion god is incomplete so is in god i just want to ask you is god in jeopardy of remaining incomplete is there a chance that at the end of the story god will have miscalculated and a few pieces get lost somewhere and he has to continue on incomplete you see i say that in jest but but we act as though we talk as though we conduct ourselves as though that at some point i could just be cast away i may not even be one of them i don't even know i just failed and i'm not it no more if you were ever it you're always amen if you were ever if you were ever redeemed if you were ever redeemable you're always redeemable you're always redeemed in the mind of god you cannot be lost you cannot be separated because you're a part of god and god is incomplete without you so we got to quit acting like i'm in one day out the next in one day out the next if you were ever in you're always in sometimes what we got to do is just tell the devil to shut up we don't have to identify with every thought that comes in our mind the only thought that we identify is the one that matches the word brother branham said he said the non-elect don't even want this position don't even ask for it don't even they're not troubled about it all the time they're not turning turmoil about am i pleasing god am i one of the like in my bride the non-elect aren't even asking those questions they're just going on going to the denominators of church assuming everything's fine and happy that way so just tell the devil to shut up if god's given you a revelation of who you are hold on to that revelation if the revelation you got matches the word hold on to it amen we have had we have had something no other age has ever had let's not take it lightly let's take the full implication of what's been said and the full value of what's been delivered to us we shouldn't be acting like they acted in luther's day we shouldn't be we shouldn't be speaking things that they spoke in wesley's day we shouldn't be talking like they talked in the pentecostal day amen we should be speaking like they speak in the bride aj man because there's been an eagle anointing this fly higher than all the denominations and showed us the whole plan of god from before the foundation of the world to the new heavens and new earth and he's also revealed to us our place in that by the end of by individually jesus christ revealing himself to you as an individual placing you in that plan don't ever let the devil's lies pull you out if you're ever there you're always there so god let's read this again and lean out their understanding you're a daughter of god son of god daughter of god you had to be part of god and god isn't complete without you has to be that's right because there is one only one source of eternal life and that is god and him alone has eternal life now you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him that what that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it that's all have you felt a little tug towards god has the message of the hour pulled at your heart then you should be able to raise your hand and shout and rejoice and say praise god amen i feel like shouting because there's something in there that god can tug on because there's souls out there there's nothing to tug on there's nothing that the message can tug on there's nothing to get a hold of nothing to pull on amen but if there's something that's pulling us it won't let us go and won't turn us loose no matter how much we fail no matter how much we backslide or doubt remember something's there that keeps tugging we should raise our hands and thank god because that something there was not something we put there it doesn't come from our minds amen it came from the mind of god and it was implanted there by predestination and it's to guarantee that he's going to make sure that grace comes to his seed amen don't discount those things don't throw them away amen we have those i mean god deals with us so powerfully god deals with us so personally amen and the devil will come in and trouble our mind and we're willing to throw this thing away for some thought in our mind but what the prophet told us the way he explained it and the realization we have in ourselves and the experience we have with god that matches that message that matches that word and the devil will come in and tell you that you were wrong the other day when you said that and and you actually lied about that and you should have never spoke this one you didn't have said that you should have never looked at that amen you might not even be one of them show me that in the word you say devil you're right i shouldn't have done that i should have done that and i shouldn't have done that that that that and that but god put something in me to believe and i didn't put it there and i can't take it out i believe something deep deeper than my mind deeper than the confusion that comes to mind deeper than the questions there's something deeper that believes that's that seed gene of god that's what has to be quickened that part that he's tugging at is the part that he's making alive brother says satan's in and so god knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we so we would be we would be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became jesus christ the son of god himself the fullness of the manifestation of god therefore that was god's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship so one of god's purposes was to display his attributes in fellowship god wants to fellowship with his attributes he wants to display his attributes in fellowship when i was in my father i knew nothing about it but when i became his son and was born of him i was an attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of god upon the earth and that was god's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what god wanted at the beginning what did god want god wanted amen he wanted us to come into flesh he wanted us to be a family on the earth to have fellowship with one another why because when i have fellowship with you if you have that seed gene of god on you it's been quick in the life when i have fellowship with you i'm having fellowship with god i understand god wanted his attributes he wanted to manifest his attributes in fellowship that's why we can only have fellowship one another if we walk in the light as he is in the light amen because if we get outside of that word amen we're outside of the fellowship but we have to be in the word as he is in the word the message for our day brings us to a place of fellowship the attributes of god are fellowshipping how are they fellowshipping they're fellowshipping by the revelation of the word so that when i fellowship with you amen you you realize now when i begin to fellowship with you i'm fellowshipping with my bridegroom because it's christ in you the hope of glory you understand when i when we have fellowship together in the light of this age amen it is christ coming together because we are the body of christ amen united together in fellowship under the banner of the word amen and when this body unites it is christ and every member is christ so when i have fellowship with you i'm having fellowship with christ when you're having fellowship with me you're having fellowship with christ and you may see oh this is what this is where we have to go beyond human thinking because you'll see me and you'll see my little mannerisms that i picked up from dad and you'll see my little sense of humor i got from mom and you'll see even some ways that that it's a little bit irritating we'll be honest i wish i liked brother chad but i just wish he wasn't so every once in a while it just gets on my nerves i use me because if i use somebody else i'd be in big trouble but you can use your imagination but you see what i'm saying we see the flesh part that come through hybridization that come from a mom and dad we can see you you can see there's a little bit of irritability there's some irresponsibility here there's a flightiness in here there's a dogmatism there and we see those things amen but you got to realize that package is packaged because of the fall but there's another life inside that wants to bloom out in that package and take control and we've got to move beyond all the little things of the flesh we've got to go deeper and say that's my brother if that was on my brother then we were in god in the beginning and when god's thoughts were material and real him and i were shouting together she and i were shouting when we saw the plan of redemption when we had a conference with god in the mind of god as attributes of god we were shouting together amen we come from the same place we're part of the same material we are part of the same thing the same substance and if god allowed this hybridization to bring this one down and this one's a little more dogmatic and this one is is a little short with the fuse and this one's a little flighty then god wants to use it for a purpose there's something he wants to display he wants to display it here and here and here amen and he's still going to have his way through everything because it's the attributes of god coming up through and so we have god what does god want god wants a family of god on earth fellowshipping with one another and that fellowship is based on walking in the light as he is in the light brings us into this fellowship together and now we realize that you are part of me and i'm part of you that's why jesus could say in that day you'll know that i am you you and me i am the father of the father and me well listen if you can take yourself and put yourself let's just say i'm going to put myself in that equation i in you you and me i and the father father and me brother i said making them all one well if brother bran and brian can put himself in the same place then where's he and where am i and who's he and who am i now if i'm looking at the outer man i'm looking at two different people but if i'm going to the root amen if i'm tracing the root of this organism all the way back i'm looking at one life amen one eternal life from one eternal source with one plan of god amen we are part of the same thing which will be the family of god manifest in different manifestations upon this earth and perfection and then that thing about me that used to irritate you will not irritate you in the new heavens and new earth because god will finally have polished it clear out of me so you better start loving me now that's why fellowship is so critical friends because when we reject fellowship and run off by ourselves we are actually rejecting the body of christ and when we want to say you know this this and that that just forget all of the little nuances and all of the little attitudes and all the little forget all of that and go deeper this is my brother this is my sister at some point none of these things will matter anyways at some point our little different ideas and our little differences they will not matter at some point but that is my brother that is my sister i will embrace them as part of christ and when we dismiss fellowship you know sometimes you listen the reality is we can get our feelings hurt it can i'd rather say will have and will and will again. i mean this is a this is a human life in a fallen outer man you can get your feelings here things can go different to your liking you can have people step on you not even be intentionally maybe or maybe it was intentionally it doesn't matter whatever happens but the devil is trying to pull us away from fellowship and get us over in isolation all by ourselves and then then we begin begin to believe all kinds of lies that way we begin to believe lies like like they're all wrong i'm the only one who knows and they don't see it but god has got a body on this earth and these attributes should be connected in fellowship because it's part of the same body we need one another we need to hold on to one another embrace one another because it's not just you the outer exterior flesh but there's something in you that i love there's something in you that i love with without emotion it brings emotion but there's something that's agape love there's something that's high there's something in you i love because whatever it is that's in you i loved when we were together existing as real in the thoughts of god you and i were standing next to each other and we loved each other there [Music] and that's why we have the ability to love each other here amen because we can go deeper than the skin deeper than the mind deeper than all those things and i can see there's a life in there amen it's the same life that i have it comes from the same source we have the same father we're part of the same family we're both walking in the light as he is in the light amen that puts us in fellowship together as the attributes of god fellowshipping on the earth listen that's what his purpose was from the beginning why can't we start fellowshipping on the earth now attributes of god in fellowship walking in the light as he is in life embracing one another amen as as both being part of the same thing praise god in the message sirs we would see jesus from 64. he says now if you were in his thinking at the beginning if you've got eternal life there is only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and it has no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of god's thinking before there was anything but him you understand that brother branham said at this stage he wasn't even god yet because god is an object of worship i mean he was the same person he was the same substance but he didn't have the title before there was angels to worship and before he had the title of god you were there so tell me what can take you away from your position what demon you were before demons you were before lucifer you understand there's no force that can remove you from the love of christ from the love of god that's in christ jesus there's no force there's no demon power there's no foreseen or unseen that can separate you away amen because you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that is secure his love was set his love was secure that is the expression of his grace so don't say something different than that can anything separate us from the love of god well the next time you mess up and condemnation comes you did this and you did that and you did that we start to believe that our conduct has separated us from the love of god you understand we begin to believe in our minds that because of this action in this action in this section i have separated myself from the love of god the love of god was set before the foundation of the world before you did right or wrong he said east so have i love or jacob have i loved and esau have i hated before either was born before either had a chance to do good or evil so don't don't change the word of god amen by your own wrong thinking amen your actions aren't separating from you the love of god the love of god is fixed amen your actions are putting you outside of blessings they're causing you to remove yourself from the word and remove yourself from the source of blessings but it's not changing the love of god or your position in god so what do you do brother chad repent repent say god that was wrong i'm sorry i shouldn't have done that but don't lose your sonship over it don't throw away all the promises in the bible don't lose your security that was revealed in the seals amen don't re don't lose the rejoicing the shouting the clapping the singing when you see the plan of salvation don't lose that fellowship you had with god from before the foundation of the world don't lose that joy that thrilled your heart at the opening of the seals what thrilled you at the opening of the seals what was it that was so exciting was it that you now knew what a white horse was i now know what i want whoa i'm a new man what changed you is you realize that this revelation coming to you was calling your name that you believed it and he was saying you're part of this you're the name that was there all of these things i'm showing you what i've done how i've redeemed my whole plan because now i've come to the end of that plan and i'm showing you what the plan was so that i can open the book and show you your name is on this book that's what thrilled our hearts at the opening of the seals don't let anything change how can you change that you can't change what's in that book so just stick with the word just believe what he said say what the tapes say say it i mean if they hook you to a lie detector and the lie detector goes off red red red red red he's lying i'd say it anyways i believe that word before i believe my own thoughts and my own flesh body and my own ability to perspirate and get nervous when i begin to say things the word is still true regardless of my reaction regardless of my thoughts regardless of my mind the word is true always true always will be true i want to say what the tapes say i want to say what the scriptures say and not say what i'm feeling right now because if you wait 15 minutes your feelings will change amen but this word will never change god's feeling for you won't change his love for you won't change your position in him won't change but your feelings will change your thoughts will change your understanding will change so stick with the word praise god we're still reading in sirs we would see jesus from 1964. i said this is review there's a lot of review but this is so important friends this is a revelation this is something we've heard and heard and heard but the implication has got to change our lives the implication has got to be manifest in the way we speak and the way we act and the way we view things around us this this is statements with implications the implications have to become tangible it's got to it's got to stop being conceptual it's going to stop being an idea that's exciting it's going to stop being something brother branham said that i can say amen to or the preacher gets everybody riled up by saying these things it's got to move from conceptual a thrilling concept it's got to be tangible in our lives where i say that's me that's the truth that's the reality and everything else is a lie so we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it and we'll repeat it till something inside clicks and say that's not a neat idea that's who i am it's not a neat concept it's not something i say amen to it's exciting it is something that's real inside of me praise god he says your form your shape and what you're in now is just a negative when you come up to round 20 22 years old you were a negative and death develops now listen i don't want to contradict brother branham but i started losing my hair when i was 19. 22 is not a good number for me but the point is what you were at your best in perfection it's just a negative and death develops the picture to the positive that when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting this life was just a negative reflecting that one and the negative was made off the positive in god's mind and it's come down here in the negative form and it's going through the dark room process right now amen and after it passes through the darkroom process amen it'll be formed into the positive image of the positive thought and i will go to my theophany he said now this just to display now it shows what's being done like god becoming god when he created angels he becomes son when he created christ jesus he becomes savior when jesus died he becomes healer when he is wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed see all these things are attributes of god just so that in the end the bible said jesus said you will know that i am in the father the father and me i and you and you and me it's god becoming tangible next time you hug your brother oh it may be in a negative form it may have not come to the positive form yet it may have not gone through the process to go back amen to the positive form but in its negative form it's god becoming tangible that's why we have to be so careful what we say about a brother and sister so very careful we have to be careful how we treat one another how we speak about one another and when we embrace one another we have to realize this is part of god becoming tangible it's god becoming tangible your own wife you and your husband is just a shadow and negative of god and his wife the church see it's just god's attribute being displayed in shadows and types like the old testament was to the new then in the end it all winds up god tangible god in christ tangible made flesh god dwelt among us and in that great millennium to come god in the form of christ sits upon the throne of david and the church's bride husband and wife together all tangible now let's turn i want to read a scripture here out ephesians chapter 3 together and this ephesians chapter 3 is a unique scripture and i've read it many many times and pondered over and looked at it but now just by the grace of god i just see it differently ephesians 3 and 8. unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ so there's a fellowship or there's a joint participation there there is a a shared part in this fellowship this fellowship of the mystery or of the secret that was in god from the beginning so you have a part of that fellowship so make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church to manifold wisdom of god now i i struggled with this verse verse 10 because of the way it's worded it's very complicated but but by the grace of god i see the understanding of it now to the intent that now unto the prince of eyes and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord and what what this verse is actually saying if we if we go back and we look at in the literal greek you begin to understand first i want to interpret a word for you verse 9 is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world that world means ages and be from the beginning of the ages have been hidden god who created all things by christ jesus to the intent that now unto principalities this word principalities means beginnings or origins or or the first or that which was in the beginning and powers means jurisdiction or rulership in heaven so to the originals to the beginning the first those with jurisdiction in heaven might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god that means maybe known by the church the literal word means through the church that now what god is doing through the church is revealing the manifold wisdom of god to principalities and powers in heavens this was a secret even in heaven brother branham said he said the angels didn't even know this i mean they didn't know what the seventh seal was it was a total secret but now is being revealed through or by the church the manifold wisdom of god and who is catching this manifold wisdom principalities and powers in heavens what's happening on earth amen is is reflecting in heaven what's happening on earth is part of a redemption cycle amen that's reconciling earth and heaven so it's not it's not that the church is catching the manifold wisdom but through the church is the manifold wisdom being expressed to principalities and powers in heavens because they couldn't imagine him doing it this way they couldn't imagine him being so humble amen they couldn't imagine him doing his way to manifest his wisdom this great secret that god kept in himself and we know that that revelation was jesus christ and we know that he come down as a baby in a manger and they were awed by that and he was beaten and he was slain amen but the most amazing part was that he would take from himself and form a bride and then he would allow that bride to go through the church ages and at the end he would come down himself into that bride form amen so that he could unite the two back together amen this is the manifold wisdom of god that's being revealed through the church [Applause] and heaven didn't even know it and now it's being manifest by the church the manifold wisdom of god how god will come in humility how god will come down amen through his attributes because he'll never lose himself he can send it in weakness he can send in humility he can send it in a broken condition he can send it in such a way that nobody will believe that this is god this is an attribute of god and this is god bringing about a reconciliation he can do it that way because god knows what he is and he knows where his seed in germa is and that will never be lost because it's a part of god and god can sow it into absolute weakness in an absolute weakness he can overcome and reconcile all things into jesus christ so now what are we doing manifesting the manifold wisdom of god in what form in bride form god had a secret he had a secret he showed it from the beginning in the garden of eden but that plan that secret amen he's been unfolding now for thousands of years but he's revealed that secret to you and i he says in the smyrnan church age now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus what all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifesting flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed just like he became seed and son we became spoken word seed and son but i want you to understand spoken word though now manifest in the flesh are the those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are sons of god even as we are so called amen i want to i want to read another quote then i want to go to revelation 10. now compare god's eden to satan's now after 6 000 years of perverting of the true interpretation of god's promised word to the age let's compare it now and see where we get like he did to the church in christ's time in jesus trying to keep back god's loyal sons from knowing the truth that's that that's god's god put his sons here his attributes to fellowship with him by hearing the word catch that i want to fellowship with god how do you fellowship with god you fellowship with him by hearing his word amen that's why the message in this day has restored our fellowship back to god because god has revealed his plan of redemption god has revealed at the opening of the seals his whole plan amen and by hearing the word it restores us back to fellowship with god what's he restoring us back to the same kind of fellowship we had in his mind when the sons of god shouted for joy now let's go to revelations chapter 10. revelation chapter 10 and verse 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so in this day of the voice of the seventh angel we shall begin to sound the mystery of god the mystery of god there's a great mystery of god and we have fellowship in this mystery this is where we fellowship is in this mystery in this secret that's what brings us together that's what unites the attributes and fellowship sharing a common purpose and a common participation is in this mystery that is where our fellowship is and he says in this mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets this term as he declared to his servants to prophets his servants the prophets had wrote the entire bible who wrote the bible the prophets so they wrote the entire bible that's why when brother branham comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed he is preaching revelations 10 7 he is preaching the seventh seal but he says and he's preaching revelation 10 7 the mystery of god christ is the mystery of god revealed so this is the revealing of the mystery of god and it's going to show christ and he says christ and he said in order to do this i'm going to take from my context the entire bible what's he doing he's preaching revelations 10 7. that statement is coming right out of revelation 10 7 he has to preach the mystery of god out of the whole bible because god has declared it to the prophets so that mystery is laying in this bible and that mystery is revealed in christ amen and don't forget that you're in christ that mystery is not just the male part but it's the male and female part because within adam was the woman amen and part of the beginning the mystery in the beginning the foreshadow when he told the end from the beginning he had male and female in his son adam and in adam was the part that was going to come out to manifest woman and they were going to be united as one flesh and he was declaring the end from the beginning what is this the mystery of god god becoming tangible wanting to fellowship as a family upon the earth what is that that's the seventh seal that's the mystery of god that's revelation 10 7 and in order to preach it he's got to take the whole bible because he had declared the mystery to all the prophets he declared the mystery to all the prophets but all the prophets didn't know what the mystery was it was laying in mystery form in the bible so a prophet could come at the end time and he could say there it is in adam and eve there it is in ruth and boaz there it is amen in rahab there it is in tamar amen there it is in mary do you see it do you see it do you see it what is it it's the mystery of god amen he come forth as his son the last adam restored the fallen sun redeemed back all that adam had lost but within him was a woman just like in the first time and he had to take that woman out she had to come into manifestation and he had to be united back to her again what's he doing he's reconciling back in the plan of redemption and this is the great mystery of god why because it was in this thought from before the foundation of the world and you're part of that thought and you're part of this plan you made a mistake yesterday so did i and the day before and the day before and the day before but how am i going to change this how am i going to stop this force from moving in my life how will i will stop the unstoppable god from working his purpose and his plan and his own will in my life i just have to repent and yield to him and say god i want to give you more than i gave you the day before and tomorrow i want to give you more yet lord i don't want this hybrid flesh to rule me i don't want wrong thoughts i don't want to be swayed by the enemy but what i want to do is lay my life down i want you to have preeminence because i love your plan i love to be for the foundation the world i loved it in the opening of the seals and i still love it today it's my identification it's who i am it's why i'm here and i love it just as much as i did when i shouted in your mind before the foundation of the world go on anything i do amen contrary to that i hate and i lay it down and say god forgive me but i'm not giving up what he's given me i can't give up what he's given me it was his eternal purpose [Music] brother says i'm going to finish with this i don't want to go any further we'll pick it up some other time i want to finish with this and the feast of trump is he says go into the prophet's chamber and watch them seven steps where where did the guard meet the challenge to bring the comer into the presence of the king at the top of the steps so at the top of the seventh step on the seventh step there's going to be somebody who's going to bring the comer into the presence of the king who's that it's the forerunner ministry it's eliezer it's the one introducing to isaac uh he says here now come up the seventh step when you come up to the seventh step there's a seventh church aged messenger and now that will bring you into the presence of the king how will he bring you into the presence of the king the king is the word the king is the eternal word with the eternal purpose amen and he brings you into the presence of the king by bringing you into the revealed word and then you meet your bridegroom your husband your mate jesus christ the word at the top of the steps was in the seventh step there shows that we've got to come again with the same spirit that was on john he introduced the messiah he was greater than all the prophets he introduced it and we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the messiah what's introducing the messiah bringing the person coming to the seventh step into the presence of the king next paragraph and how will the messiah how will the people that believe him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shall know their god now now now he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word how are you going to have fellowship with god by hearing his word how are you going to be united into the fellowship you had before the foundation of the world by the revealing of the word will bring you in contact with your bridegroom with your may with your husband the revealed word it'll bring you into the presence of the king it'll not unite you back to who you really are and bring us back to the basis of fellowship we had there and that should bring us to fellowship with one another see we can try to manufacture fellowship we need to have a fellowship meeting and we had more we need more fellowship in the church and and so we need more fellowship in the church so we're going to have a volleyball contest that's not fellowship that's friendship that's fine there's not i'm not against friendship but let's not call it fellowship that's not fellowship fellowship is walking in the light as he is in the light brings us back into that unity with our bright our our bridegroom our mate the revealed word and that's what brings us together in fellowship friends the friendship is part of it the the knowing one another caring for one another amen that's all part of it amen but the real fellowship between the attributes of god is fellowship on the revealed word fellowship with god is hearing his word fellowship with christ is coming to christ your mate the revealed word fellowship with one another is when we meet each other there i hope you understand that if we got the only way to have fellowship is to walk in the light as he is in the light you can't manufacture it you can't make it happen it happens amen if you unite with christ and i unite with christ guess what we're going to have fellowship you go up through that seventh step and you get ushered in amen by by by eliezer into the presence of the king guess what that's where i'm at hey brother you're here amen we're sitting here united with the king we're sitting here talking to the king together that's the basis for our fellowship friends that's the basis for fellowship in our homes that's basis for fellowship in our marriages that's the basis for fellowship in our church is to get united in christ amen to be part of the fellowship of this great mystery that unites us together with an eternal bond the things that are only temporal the things that are only earthly they'll fall away but these bonds that are eternal that go back to the mind of god they'll stay you have a marriage that has that kind of fellowship where both the husband and the wife are linked to christ have been ushered through the seventh step into the chamber of the king i'm telling you they'll weather every storm friends they will weather every storm it doesn't mean that on the friendship side and then the outside man it doesn't mean there won't be turmoil or conflict or difficulty or or he said she said your mom your mom i mean [Music] sorry but that's the reality but if the fellowship is only based on those things that fellowship will go up and down and up and down and up and down but if you take two people who've made it into the inner chamber amen they may still have family pressures and outside pressures and financial pressures and disagreements and that's all fine but they will weather every storm because they have true fellowship you take a church and the people in the church that are in harmony with the word amen they've all entered into the inner chamber amen you're going to have fellowship you don't have to manufacture it it will be there you do the same thing in your home with your children amen you can't manufacture it you love them you take care of them but if they start to enter into the place you're you're going to have fellowship for the rest of your lives this is the basis for fellowship going in to the inner chamber together finding ourselves as joint participants and the same thing in the same mystery participating in the community of the same thing we each have our own part but we have our part of the same thing i'm going to finish reading this quote to feast the trumpets so the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in luther wesley and in pentecost and them scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in this age that is coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two or one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two or one and he is the word not the denominational the word we are to be children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the bible said so so if you walk in the lightest he is in the light your fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse you from all sins but the word made flesh is the light of the age what is the word made flesh can you raise your hand are you the light of the age are you the word made flesh are you that thought that he had before the foundation of the world of a bride in this end time is that you is that attribute inside of you that portion of him that he portioned to be here in this day to be that part of the word made manifest in a bride in jesus christ in the formation of the bride can you say i'm part of that that is the that is the light of the age that is the word made manifest that is the light of the age amen and if you walk in the light as he is in the light you have fellowship with one another i tell you friends i'm happy with this fellowship that we have i don't want to manufactured i don't want to put on i don't want to make believe but i want the real fellowship that goes all the way down to the core so that when i irritate you so bad and you irritate me we'll just flip it now we're not going anywhere because we're in the same inner chamber we're part of the same program we're in the same fellowship of the mystery we were in his mind we were the one in his mind that when he laid out the plan he said this group over here i'm holding you now i'm just dramatizing okay i'm holding you back for the last here's my plan for you he showed him the plan you'll be this and you'll be that and i want you to go down and i want you to go at the very end and i want you to have a unique manifestation and guess what friends you were there and i was there that puts us in a bond of fellowship that can't be broken when we disagree we agreed there if we disagree today on what color to paint a wall it won't change the agreement we had there it won't change the agreement that we have in our hearts amen that this is christ and we love him and he's our mate he's your mate and he's my mate that makes you and i connected he's my husband and he's your husband that makes you and i connected he's my lover and your lover he's my king and your king amen i meet him in the inner chamber you meet him in the inner chamber that makes you and i won amen makes him the whole thing praise god this is finish this is finishing up in god's power to transform many times man said well now man wrote this bible no the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it's the word of god and it never can fail jesus said heavens and earth will fail pass away but my word shall never fail and it cannot fail in being god because it's part of him and then you being you being a son or daughter you are part of it and that makes you a part of him so that's why we come together that's why we come to fellowship together around the word of god why do we fellowship you're part of him i'm part of him this is him this is the basis of our fellowship we fellowship with god by hearing his word we fellowship with one another by uniting with that word you're the word i'm the word he's the word he's the word you're the word i'm the word i and you you and me i in him he and me father me i am the father i and you you're making them all one where do you find yourself in that equation wherever you find yourself is where i find myself and that puts me and you together as one that's why i love you that's why you love me not because we always are in perfect agreement on every decision not because we don't have flesh and we don't have characteristics but we love one another because we are united together in an inseparable bond that we can't get away from each other and i like it that way god is good let's all stand musicians if you come i'm just going to stop i just feel to stop right there i don't want to get in anything else i'd like to stop with us loving each other inseparable and united together and loving one another through a bond that cannot be broken that's why john would say by all this but jesus would say well this they will know you're my disciples we have loved one for another and john said my little children love each other with a fervent love i don't think he's telling you to manufacture anything i think it's an outcrop of realizing who we are i think it comes why is it when you meet a new believer and you sit down and you start to talk to them all of a sudden it doesn't take you very long and you it feels like they're family it feels like i have always known this person all of my life where did i meet him how do i know him how do i know her she's i know i know her she would've never met we never met were you over here no i wasn't there i was at did you go to that camp no i wasn't there how do we know each other because we were there you're in the mind of god we're linked with the word we come from the same family inside we're the same thing that's what unites us together friends if they if the government breaks this house breaks this building closes the doors whatever happens it cannot break that fellowship amen if we get scattered if the door is closed or whatever happens it doesn't matter he cannot break that fellowship and i'll tell you the name on the outside of the church can't break that fellowship either it doesn't matter which one you drive to on a sunday morning this fellowship is bigger than a church building this fellowship is bigger than a location this fellowship goes all the way back to the mind of god and we'll go all the way to new heavens and new earth and we'll be dwelling together in the new jerusalem amen it doesn't matter which building you walk into to worship god on sunday amen if you were there i was there if you'll be there i'll be there you and i love one another i say praise god lord i say give me more of that more of that don't let me get hung up by where somebody drive to church or or some little disagreement on the way to do this or do that amen let me go deeper than that and say were you in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and that brother says yes i said let me hug you brother amen praise be to god friends that's the basis for fellowship amen well praise god let's just stop let's sing brother been saying i'll stop preaching as you start saying we'll walk in the light it's such a beautiful comes where the dew drops all around us [Music] it's such a beautiful [Music] oh the light of the world amen i thought i stopped reaching you started singing but i got a little something more to say so many times what breaks our fellowship and causes us to mistrust another brother or sister is really our own insecurity let me just give you an example [Music] somebody disagrees with you on a doctrine in the message and they have a a different understanding not not perverting the word but just a different understanding of what brother benham said if we're not secure in who we are we need them to be wrong and in order for ourselves to be right [Music] and that attitude breaks fellowship because face it friends we're all growing in the knowledge of jesus christ we're all seeing the message more clearly than we saw it a year before there are things that god is continually opening to us and we're getting clearer understanding not changing the whole message but clearer understanding of what the prophet said but so many times we're willing to break fellowship and and break harmony with other believers and other churches because well they believe this and they believe that but you know what i don't care [Music] because what i believe is based off revelation well god has revealed to me if we are secure in who we are there's nothing to fight about you don't we don't need for somebody else to be wrong even in the church sometimes in our own church we'll have two ideas on how to manage something how to accomplish a task amen and all of a sudden we have to make one wrong for us to be right and then what's worse is with something totally natural that doesn't mean anything amen we'll have to spiritualize it [Music] trust me friends trust me what to spiritualize it to find some spiritual reason for why mine's right and yours is wrong and you know because the devil has this many letters in lucifer's name and i it all comes off in security insecurity where when you're really secure in your position with christ and then you're really secure in your calling and your election even if somebody disagrees with you say okay okay i think we should do that way okay and then they're going to look at you like you're not going to argue no i'm not going to argue if that's the way you want to do it do it i i personally feel this way but that's okay when this message well you know brother bram said this and it means this you've got to see it that way and you say okay that's fine god bless you brother i love you you're not going to fight with me why would i fight with you i just see it differently but but see if you know that you were there in that conference if you know you were there if you know god is not complete without you then even if i got it wrong today he has to show it to me right if it's imperative that i get the right understanding of this and i've got it wrong today he'll make it right but so many times we fight because we feel like i've got to have it right in order to be right i don't have to have it right to be right i was made right before the foundation of the world i will come out right in the end even if my understanding is off god will tweak my understanding i don't have to fight for anything i don't care sharing with you what i believe and hearing you share what you believe amen but the minute you try to force me into your mode or i force you into mind i mean you're going to break fellowship over what [Music] god's in control my question to you is were you in the mind of god before the foundations in the world did you sing and shout with the sons of god then you're my brother then you're my sister we're going to wind up in the same spot he said brother chad how can you say that what if they're wrong well if they're wrong that has nothing there's no bearing on me making it there and even me telling them even me believing or somebody says yeah i was there brother i'm a child of god even me agreeing with them has no bearing on where i'm going even if they're wrong even if they're lying i'll just take them at their own testimony at their own confession you're a son of god praise god i love you brother well what if they're not what if they're not i mean who cares i'm still going to be in the city singing and shouting and dancing when the king of kings sets upon the throne of david it has no bearing on my outcome it has no makes no difference on my origin my origin secured my outcome what am i worried about what anybody else thinks or believes please i mean i hope you understand what i'm saying i don't mean to be frivolous with that but so many times we break fellowship over our own insecurity instead of just saying god is my god he is my father my position is secure if i need to know something he'll reveal it to me if what you're saying is true god will confirm it to me i don't have to fight to make you wrong you don't have to make me wrong let's just love each other let's just do what john says this is love each other with a fervent love and let god sort it all out let's stay in the word together there's so many things that we know are true that stay in them most of the things we fuss about are things that we'll never know anyways a piece of this and a piece of that let's just say let god reveal it if he wants us to know it it'll get clearer it'll get clear and clear and clear but let's just love each other let's stay with the word hey brother are you in the inner chamber hey sister have you gone beyond the veil well praise god we're together [Music] we love each other oh i pray that god will give us a security a real security in the soul that takes away all indifference and all just a real security and a real joy my name was on that lamb's book of life and before the foundation of the world how can i get upset how can i doubt [Music] let that revelation bring joy let that revelation bring comfort let that revelation bring true security let's keep marching forward happy happy and free and joyous and loving each other and having fellowship in the word and staying united to christ and loving one another amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you lord i thank you god for the revelation of who i am i thank you lord that you brought a prophet in our day and you ministered through that prophet it was you lord there's a son of man revealing the son of man and you came so that you could give us a true identification of who we actually are and god we receive it by faith you've revealed it to us as individuals and we believe it lord let that be the greatest truth that guides our lives lord let that be the thing that transcends everything else lord this that let that trump every other thought and every other circumstance lord and let us have true fellowship through fellowship in our marriages and in our families on our homes lord and in the church and in the bride let us have fellowship lord as we unite with you let us keep lifting you up lord and running to that word and embracing that word and uniting with it and loving you lord may it transcend into a fellowship with one another how we love your father and how we thank you god for your goodness to us how much we love one another with the true love lord and how thankful we are for that i thank you from my brothers and my sisters who are here lord and the love that we have for each other well we realize it's supernatural god may we never put it in jeopardy by our own insecurity but may we be secure in you lord grow us into that image you had of us before the foundation of the world and make us what you want us to be let this revelation bring consequences let it bring changes in our thinking and in our speech may it bring a new reality to us lord and may it be the reality that we walk in we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you saints i love y'all [Music] [Music] jesus and mercy in his name oh jesus [Music] oh [Music]
