quinlan back god bless you all whoever else has been gone brother man you know god bless you brother craig god bless you amen it's good to have everybody home again praise the lord let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you for this day and for your blessings lord upon us notice we look into your word we just pray that you would just anoint us lord to receive your word god that you would just speak through these lips of clay lord your eternal word that you would bring it to us lord fresh lord right from your thoughts lord off the pages lord of the message in the bible and bring it alive to us lord and let it be lord fresh manna lord we just ask that you would speak to us and help us lord to climb a little higher and get nearer to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen well we're yet standing let's turn to the book of revelation and read together i want to remind everybody we're having a send-off for brother david cornmeiser and god bless you if he was here he's there he is amen so we're going to have some refreshments and cake over in the fellowship hall afterwards we invite you all to come over there it's been wonderful to have our brother we've appreciated him and he's going to be leaving us so it's sad but we want to give him a proper send-off amen is that luke and ariel hatfield god bless you it's good to have you back amen praise the lord i like saying that luke and ariel hatfield amen praise the lord let's read this revelation chapter 5. start at verse 5 and we'll let you have your seats and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of the odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song sayeth thou art worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth god bless you as you're seated praise the lord if we can bring up the powerpoint we're going to continue on in the fourth seal and i want to talk about kings and priests amen so we see here at the opening of the seals when they begin to worship and pour out the vials of the prayers of the saints amen they begin to acknowledge that this is redemption amen and when they acknowledge that this is redemption then then they acknowledge also that we have been made kings and priests because that's what we're redeemed back to friends we're redeemed back to a position amen that that we fell from and we're redeemed back to that place of kings and priests unto our god hallelujah see redemption is tied to reconciliation because when you pay the price of redemption to buy back you buy back and reconcile back to its former place where it had fallen from and if we have been redeemed and made kings and priests and that was our original intended purpose amen but something happened something fell i'm gonna i'm gonna divert for a little bit and come back to kings and priests so don't don't get lost praise the lord we do a little bit of overlap these things build as we go but we know that he said when this the mystery was in the seven seals when the seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and then these seven seals held the entire mystery of that we keep going over this every time because we don't ever want to lose this this sealed up the entire book of redemption and all the mysteries that are in the bible are wound up in these seven seals amen in the fourth seal this is when brother ben was just opening his comments and he said i'm so glad we finally got to this one and i'm so thankful that being the last of those four horse riders which i think is one of the main messages to the church at this time and i want to break that down the reason this is one of the main messages to the church at this time is because redemption for the gentiles and the gentile church dispensation wraps up in the fourth seal it finishes in the fourth seal and under the fourth seal the church is raptured amen and when the church goes up in the physical rapture of the church satan is cast out and he physically incarnates the pope becoming the beast under the fourth seal and so that's the wrap up amen of the church ages that's the finishing of of the redemption of the gentiles it all finishes under the fourth seal and and we know the four seals also tied to prophetic ministry because it's it's the the it's the eagle anointing that comes down and the eagle is the prophets amen and so we see brother branham's ministry coming on the scene amen and and the lap over period between the third seal and the fourth seal because brother branham taught us it's like climbing a ladder like going up steps you don't just hop from one to the other just like the church ages there's a transition as you move from one to the other then you transition from one to the other and he explains it to us as going up steps or climbing a ladder so we see in brother branham's day he was making that transition and the transition will go all the way to the rapture in the fully incarnate devil but there's some things that are happening in our time and that's why this is one of the main messages to the church at this time so much happens under the fourth seal friends under the fourth seal we we see the finishing of redemption to the gentiles we see malachi 4 come on the scene we see the opening of the seven seals because it all takes place under this eagle anointing amen we see the church incarnate the church itself incarnate by the antichrist spirit by the devil himself amen bringing them to a system bringing them to the image of the beast amen and then we see god himself incarnate in his church the bride and those two facing off and in battle amen and then the bride overcoming going in the rapture then the devil coming down and incarnating the head of this system which is the pope amen and then going into the tribulation period so there's a lot that happens and we're right here we're right here friends this is what's happening to us it's exciting so we see we've come to the pale horse which is spiritual death it's also physical death but we want to focus on the spiritual side the incarnate devil and to combat that is the eagle we know the eagle is god himself and it's prophets and the children of god now the fourth seal you understand the fourth seal when it transitions into the tribulation period that's when the devil is fully incarnate and one man and the bride is gone unleashing full tribulation upon the earth but that doesn't mean the eagle anointing has left because we see when the bride goes two eagles rise up amen in revelations 11 to the 144 000 and the eagle anointing continues on and the fourth seal and goes all the way to the end of the tribulation period so the fourth seal and the sixth seal very much run on parallel tracks we'll see this as we go further we'll see that they're running together the fourth seal and the sixth seal hallelujah so we see these two great forces standing off as we come through as we've come through the church ages we see the tactics of the enemy and we see what god's going to do to overcome the tactics each time and how god has and and what has worked will always work once god set a pattern he doesn't change his pattern the pattern stays true and then the fourth seal brother baby says oh my and notice yet he gave her space to repent and he's speaking of the catholic church now he gave her space to repent but she did she didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it her rejection away makes her rejection makes a perfect way for satan to come into her and be incarnate incarnate himself right in her because she rejected the word and he's speaking of the catholic church or the mother and that's exactly the same thing that the protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the vindicated truth of the word of god and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he will make an image into the beast when they consolidate together right yonder now and go on and do just exactly what he said so brother brahms showing us a principle where where this this uh this devil this antichrist spirit goes into the church amen making up a perfect scenario for him to be incarnate and they come into the catholic church giving space to repent and they don't and then we see the same thing happen to the protestants and when it happens to the protestants now now the protestants when he comes in and incarnates himself he works them around to make an image unto the beast hallelujah so if he's there if he's injected himself into the false vine making an image into the beast amen we know that the devil is only imitating what god does that's all he ever does he's an imitator and he cannot create he only perverts he only watch what god's doing and tries to imitate what god's doing he he can't do anything else he has no new thoughts amen he just watches god and he wants to be like god so he tries to emulate what god is doing and he does it in deception so now we see that he injects himself to build this great image unto the beast amen and when they when they build this image into the beast now it sets up a throne amen so there could be a head of this image of the beast which is a system a consolidation of churches and when they build this system now the devil himself can come down amen incarnate one person so it's got to be the devil incarnated into the church to bring the place amen for the incarnation of one one person and now we find that the church is doing the same thing she's been incarnated with the very life of jesus christ amen bringing about amen a throne for one man to sit on in the millennial reign and that's jesus christ hallelujah so they run parallel tracks amen so the devil is only imitating what god is doing so if he's getting if he's getting into the church to build an image of the beast an image of the beast which is the incarnate devil then in the true church god has injected himself in incarnation in the true church to build the church into the image of jesus christ [Music] same thing amen on both sides so now they're working together by the incarnate devil when he's full-blown antichrist with with no holds left in the false system he's building an image to the beast and over here in god's kingdom through god injecting himself into church they're building an image not to the beast but to jesus christ and it's christ in the formation of the bride christ in bride form amen in the image of jesus christ the bride then the image of the bridegroom hallelujah that's where we are the devil's only copying what god has already had in his mind to do what god has already declared he will do the devil is only copying it so whatever you see him doing you know assuredly he got that pattern from somewhere hallelujah and the third seal brother ben says the first three stages of them that went into the dark age song the first three church ages went into the dark age then the third three stages come the church out from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost incarnate god made manifest among us here he comes in as the antichrist is the false prophet then the beast in the dark ages and the church comes out of the dark age justification sanctification baptism of holy ghost incarnate word the way now hallelujah i like that incarnate word we we know we know that the devil is injecting himself into the false vine how by perverted word how did he eject himself into creation at the beginning he injected himself by perverted seed and the seed is the word and so he's injecting himself by perverting the seed and he's still perverting the seed bringing hybridization to the false vine but the way god is injecting himself into his bride is with pure seed and with pure seed where the word has returned amen to the church and that pure seed is coming to the virgin now he's incarnate by injecting pure word back into the virgin bride that's the incarnation of god hallelujah so we see the in the fourth seal he says notice the antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color horse and before we get in this i don't want to go that far yet i want to i'm trying to hold myself back franco knows i was in a mess today i had to cut half of my notes clear out and save it for sunday so lord was we were in a mess friends so keep pulling i want to back up and i want to read something i don't want to skip over this but in john 14 verse 18 brother or jesus says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you now realize that that whenever jesus is doing something and talking to his disciples he's setting forth a pattern because everything in the scripture sets forth a pattern and the pattern will not be broken and so now jesus is is there he's with the disciples but he's going to die he's going to leave them but he's laying down a pattern that says the world won't see me anymore but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you and so we know that there's a fulfillment of this when we come to the day of pentecost because on the day of pentecost we know that he incarnates himself back into the church again and now they realize that that he is in the father the fathers in him he's in them they're all one amen by injection of the holy ghost into the church so they have a realization of that but remember the word is eternal the word doesn't have an expiration date it's eternal and god set a pattern there and when the church would fall from the pure word amen and now fall away god is still going to keep this word there's going to come a time that in the churches the world does not see him they don't see him in the churches they see hybridization and compromise and they see portions of the word but they don't see him but there's going to come a time amen when we shall see him how many scene is appearing hallelujah we shall see him and at that day you shall know that i am in the father and he and me and i and you brother braham said in uniting time and sign we see the nations uniting we see the world uniting we see the churches uniting we see the bride uniting uniting with the word the word is god and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for a wedding and they become one the word becomes you you become the word jesus said at that day all the father is i am and all i am you are and all you are i am and that day you'll know that i am in the father the father in me i and you and you and me now brother branham is referring right back to that scripture he gave the disciples before he died amen and now brother branham brings that right out and he says you'll know and what's he talking about he's talking about when the bride unites with the word uniting time and signs when the virgin bride receives the seed word of god and the two unite together for the wedding become one amen that's what he's referring to then he goes right to this scripture in that day you'll know that i'm in the father the father and me i and you and you and me at that day what day this day [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we find out the great hidden mysteries of god being revealed so you read that in the scripture and god had laid down a pattern right there in the scripture and he's not going to change the pattern because that happened that had a fulfillment in pentecost but when they fell away from the word now there had to come a future uniting signs and times when the bride would unite the virgin bride would unite with the word and in that uniting time then you would know that i am in the father the father in me i and you and you and me what day this day hallelujah in the third seal the prophet of god said god promised the spiritual eve as same as he did the natural eve that again the word would be restored to her amen in the last days he would restore to the church he would restore the church to the original word again this is what they fell from the word this is what he felt from the word and there was a promise that he would send the seed of the woman and that seed of the woman is jesus christ the word so he promised all the way back in the garden of eden when the woman fell he promised that the word would come back in full manifestation and brother bam said what would he send the word for for redemption when the full word came it was time to redeem back fallen eve because the full word was present but when the full word came amen now that spiritual eve the hebrew church they held onto substitutes instead of moving to the full word they didn't want to unite amen with the word amen so so they rejected the word when he came so he he moved over amen away from the jews and to the gentiles and on the day of pentecost amend the word united with the bride hallelujah but just like eve did in the garden of eden amen she fell from that word and the ephesus began to compromise under the white horse rider and seducing spirits began to take her away from the original word and when that happened that prophecy that was laying all the way back in the garden of eden god has to keep that word because the word has to come for redemption and if there's ever falling away there has to be a redemption and the only way to bring redemption because we fell from the word the only way to bring redemption is to bring back the word and then unite to the full word brings us back to full redemption see once the pattern is set the pattern never changes god is so good to us prophet says in the feast of trumpets and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything now he's comparing the seventh trumpet to the jews which are the two witnesses that'll bring them under the feast of trumpets the feast of trumpets is the sixth feast in the jewish feast and the feast of trumpets are to bring them blow the trumpets bring them in for an assembly to bring them to the feast of atonement that their sins are covered right and so these two these two prophets in revelations 11 are the seventh trumpet their message is the seventh trumpet and the seventh trumpet is bringing them back to atonement where they recognize that they have crucified the lord of glory and they separate into their homes and they mourn as one that's lost his only son and so so they're bringing them back but brother bennam's is is paralleling that with the seventh seal the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal and world traditions to the genuine atonement the word i thought i thought the atonement was the blood absolutely the shedding of human blood was the price that had to be paid because there was a problem with the blood but remember it was the word made flesh that was pierced and bled so it was the bleeding of the word when the word was made flesh that purchased redemption so redemption was in the full word so now under the seventh seal the seventh church age messenger just like the two prophets will do to the 144 thousand bring them to true atonement amen now the seventh angel angel messenger under the seventh seal is bringing the church the gentiles true the true to the true atonement which is the word because when the word is restored back to the woman the seed of the woman is brought back and when it's brought back it's brought back for one purpose and one purpose only and that's redemption you cannot find redemption in this age when the word's restored you cannot find redemption any other place if you're part of the gentiles any other place outside of the seventh seal message from a seventh church age messenger to bring the word back in its fullness which is the true atonement else will bring redemption because she has to unite with the word god is super good so in the fourth seal we touched on this sunday but in the fourth seal he said now they were gods and men if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son and a part of your father what's he saying he's saying those prophets were the gods and and he's going to begin to speak about the this in just a minute but he says if you're born in your family then then you're of your family name you're a son and part of your father so if if your father amen is a caucasian-american then you're a caucasian-american if your father is a black african you're a black african you're part of your father but if your father is god and you're born of your father then that makes you god amen it makes you an offspring of god we've said this before if a cat has an offspring it's a cat if a dog has an offspring it's a dog but if god has an offspring it's a god in that day you'll know that i am in the father the father of me i and you and you and me why because he's dwelling he's come back to miss ayats come back to fully redeem sons and daughters of god coming back to their position and when she knows what she is and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army hallelujah i like it and then we're in the four seal and then when sin came in we found out the man crossed the chasm he was separated from god and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon its original perverter that was satan then it got back to satan he waits his time of eternal annihilation now that shows what we believe we believe that he will absolutely be done completely away and annihilated so how is he going to be done away with and annihilated he just told us that when a believer a child of god comes to redemption and passes through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ it breaks the sin off of him and sends it back to the original perverter which is satan and then with that on his record that on his shoulders he awaits his time of annihilation so it is you amen it is you making your choice in this life to choose the word amen and we know you can never make that choice unless you were predestinated but yet god did say brother brahm did say that you had to come to this life to be tested to be tried to make your choice and when you come and make your choice and accept the true atonement the word that's always been the atonement in every age has always been the word for that age when you accept the true atonement the word then the sin that you've carried through life the sin you were born with the sin that was accumulated in your life it's broke off of you and sent back to the perverter which is satan and now he waits his time of annihilation you don't have to wait any time annihilation you don't have to wait for any kind of judgment amen you've passed from death unto life amen there's nothing for you to be judged for you're as righteous as god is righteous because you're in jesus christ so now he why do you think he fights this revelation so much why do you think he tries to make it so hard for you to believe that you're one of them because when you accept it when you can identify with it when you can identify with your sacrifice and lay your hands on it and it and notice that it's dead and carried your sins far away he's the one held completely responsible for all of your life and he waits his time of annihilation and you wonder why you have mental battles that's the exact reason you have mental battles he doesn't want this to be awakened in you he doesn't want you to come to this revelation he wants you to always feel guilty but i have nothing to feel guilty for there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus there's no reason for you to feel guilty if you've come to full repentance amen and you've if you've if you've made yourself a sacrifice and you've laid it all out and you've come to full repentance and you identified with the true word for your day the true atonement then you've you've passed through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ then god himself cannot even remember your sins anymore amen what in the world are you bringing them up again for don't remind god of what he has forgotten about you cannot stand judgment for it amen it's already been judged for it's already been removed from you and now lucifer satan himself will stand the judgment for that thing don't take it back leave it hallelujah when it got back to satan he waits his time of annihilation i believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink into a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into chemical and sends it plumb back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does when that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of god now because of sin we were put across the chasm separated from god but when you come through the bleach of the blood of jesus christ it puts you back across the chasm and now you're standing on god's side hey i like to be on that side see now when you cross the chasm again as son of god see and then he becomes why even he's the creative power of god is in him now catch this when brother branham said that you've you've moved from across the chasm as a redeemed son of god because only the redeemable can move across this chasm friends so that which was lost that's now found comes back and is on the side of god he says now the creative power of god is in him do you believe that we're going to have to listen the creative power of god is in him and at least whenever god commands it to be done it'll be done remember somebody asked brother branham a question and we want to keep this straight they asked brother branham a question about the spoken word he said now that you've manifested the spoken word and i'm just paraphrasing but i can show you where it is if you really need to know he says now that you manifest a spoken word you could be speak some to somebody and they could be put in perfect condition ready for the rapture so they're saying now that you can manifest the spoken word speak squirrels and says and speak to a storm speak to hattie wright's boys now that you can do that now you've got that power manifest you could speak to somebody and put them in a perfect condition ready for the rapture how do you think brother brown is going to answer that one you know the first word he says yes yes that's true he said but listen friends and i'm just paraphrasing you have to watch he said those things were done by permission he told me to do them amen you have to realize if you say unto this mountain be plucked up and cast the sea and doubt not in your heart see it takes perfect faith to perform this in perfect faith when god speaks to you and says say what you want i got a feeling that'll produce perfect faith not you're just presuming or trying something or throwing some darts to see if they'll stick that's not perfect faith we're not playing around with this but the creative power of god is in you if you've crossed the chasm the creative power of god is in you and whenever god calls for it you can speak and it'll create but these things are done by permission now remember this is this is unique this kind of permission that was given to the prophet because when he was given permission to speak he wasn't told what to say god now this is really important because when a prophet when a normally when a prophet would be given a prophecy he is told exactly what to say and he repeats verbatim what was just told to him that's how a prophet operates when god speaks lip to ear to the prophet and the prophet prophesies but this manifestation of the third pool was totally different than that it was not prophecy friends it was a son of god come back into position now you have permission from god to speak and he says whatever you say that's how it will be you got that that means that this prophet this this son of god that was redeemed had come to such a place and he had such character and he'd been so tested that god could perfectly trust that he will say what god would say that's why adam was given permission to name the animals because adam was just like his father and when adam was there god was not worried about what adam would say god was given power over the creation he could move this tree from here to there he could rearrange the garden but god wasn't upset because adam was so much like god he knew that adam would do what he would do [Applause] she has the mind of christ that's what these messages are giving us that's what the revelation is giving us it's giving us the very mind of god what was in the back part of god's mind for generations and generations has now been brought out by a prophet amen and now we're taking the mind of god in and we're building character through trials and tribulations and testings and successes and failures what's he doing he's building that christ-like character back into the bride so that when he needs to he can say you say and it'll be exactly what you say but god will not will not move down that road unless there's christ-like character in full maturity in the bride of jesus christ amen you wouldn't give your toddler a pistol why would god give the power of the spoken word to an immature bride amen amen he says creative power of god is in him and at least whenever god can command it to be done it'll be done and when moses under the blood of bulls and when he met that light that pillar of fire in the burning bush and he stood down there on a commission god had given him and he was a prophet and when the word of the lord came to him he spoke and even things created by the word and now if it'll do that under that the blood of bulls and what about the blood of jesus not covered but remitted altogether meaning you have no sin you stand in the presence of god as a redeemed son now the church is far beyond its standard of living when i read that i say oh god i want to get back to my standard of living i want to come back to my rightful position what redemption has purchased for me let me come back to faith in the word of god amen we've fallen from faith friends we've fallen because of laodicea we've fallen because of church tradition and we've come to a place where we've accepted things as not in the word and we question things that are clearly written in the word but god is bringing a people back to perfect faith in a perfect word amen back to that place where we just take it as he said it and believe it he says again in the fourth seal that's what the blood of jesus christ does to the true child of god when he confesses that sin and stands there justified mercy goodness even it's so great till god said i can't even remember it anymore and he's absolutely my son verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain he connects these two he says when he's come to the blood god says i can't even remember it no more and he's perfectly my son verily i say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and doubt not in your heart but believe in what you said it shall come to pass you can have that what you have said you are a redeemed son amen i know that's true brother branham put that one to the test and he knows it's true he's not guessing he's not doubting he knows that one's true the fourth seal prophet says now notice the antichrist was on a pale horse mixed color a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up it's political it's national powers it's religious powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed pale horse he's got all kinds of powers but when jesus comes it's on it's on a one solid colored horse the word now now don't don't project this way down the road friends or you're going to miss something glorious here he's going to come riding on a white horse in revelations 19 but first before he comes physically he comes spiritually amen and he says what's this he said a horse is a power what's the power that he comes riding on the word has the word come has the lord come what did he come on he came riding on the power of the word i'll give you a little secret we're not there yet in the fourth seal but i'll give you a little secret he comes writing to the church in this day on the power of the word but that's not how he leaves in the rapture brother branham said he rides his church right into glory what's the power the power that brings him is the word what's the power that takes him the word made manifest in the bride and he rides that power right on into glory in the rapture that makes you the white horse friends that makes you the manifested word that makes christ riding that power on this earth the manifested word and bride form and he rides it right into glory [Music] that's a direct quote brother craig hallelujah oh brothers sisters we got to know who we are we've got to know what we are amen you're not going to get your identification at walmart and your job is not going to tell you who you are but when you look in the mirror of the word it's reflecting back you're a son of god you're a son of god redemption is here come to a fully redeemed son and daughter of god hallelujah it's all kinds of powers mixed he comes on a white horse the word amen this one mixes its colors of red white black three colors in one represented in one and three powers represented in one a white horse a black horse red horse three crowns in one sure i seen the crown myself he's talking about the triple crown of the pope stood all that close and looked at it wouldn't let me get to it on the count of the glass so there was a big lock on it sitting in a case triple crown so i know it's the truth so there he was triple crown vicar of heaven purgatory earth three powers united together see all mixed up in color pale death spoke it in the whole thing political religious demon powers mixed together so when he comes on this this pale horse it's the religious power the political power and the demon power mixed together now remember what we said in the beginning the devil is only an impersonator the devil is copying what god is doing in a perverted way he doesn't have his own method he doesn't have his own way he is copying and so we find all these three come into one and to death brother branham said in the fourth seal i'm in paragraph 166 he says just exactly like the church grows his church went from antichrist to false prophet and the great age to come the beast that is to rise up so the church comes the same way through justification sanctification the baptism of holy ghost is christ being in the people just exactly so we know that these three powers coming together is is the the antichrist spirit the devil putting himself into the church which will build a world council the churches build an image to the beast and when that rises up and creates a head a throne then he'll fully incarnate that position so we know those three powers blended together it is bringing that to pass but but brother brahma tells us that that's the same way god has done through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost is christ being in the people and he's got the type of it rather just exactly so he's just typing what god's doing so how is god have three powers mixed together we know justification sanctification baptism holy ghost but the devil is using political power and force religious power and force amen in demon power and force and uniting them together right religious political demonic he's only copying god because god has made us kings and priests a king is political a priest is religious and the holy ghost is spiritual so while on one side you have a combination of the physic you have a combination of political religious and demon power on the other side you have the combination of forces of political kings religious priests and full of the holy ghost spiritual combined together to combat that antichrist system that's why you've been called kings and priests and filled with the holy ghost is because he's only copying what god is already doing and god is uniting his political force of the son of david with his religious force with the priest of the high after the order of the high priest of melchizedek united together with this spiritual power of the holy ghost making you redeem sons and daughters of god on this earth friends you're a force to be reckoned with all of heaven is backing you up political spiritual and and political religious and spiritual all combined together in this bride in the last days the devil isn't going to get anything over on you he doesn't have any tricks that god doesn't have a countermeasure to remember when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard when it when he brought a white horse god brought a lion amen when he brought a red horse god brought an ox when he brought a black horse god brought a man when he brought the pearl horse god brought the eagle which is god himself and now god has taken his kings and his priests and he has come himself upon the earth i get excited when i see stuff like this so christ injects himself into the people revelations 1 verse 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you in peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth so he is the master or leader of all the kings of the earth now remember we read over here in revelations 5 when they sang a new song and says that for that was slain and has redeemed us to god by the blood out of every kindred tongue and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth amen and here is going to be the prince of the kings of the earth or the king of kings what are you going to be when you come back in the millennial reign a king and he's going to be the king over the kings unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen that word hath is past tense he hath made us by what by the washing of our sins by his own blood he has already made us kings and priests and when that full atonement comes back in pure form the word returns the full atonement amen the true atonement and fullness he brings us back into the condition that the blood brought us to in the first place which is kings and priests i'll tell you what when a beggar walks into a store he walks with his head hung down dirty maybe just enough money to buy a loaf of bread or whatever but when a king walks into a store he walks a lot differently amen when a criminal walks into a courtroom he walks a certain way but when a righteous man walks into a courtroom when the judge comes into the courtroom he walks a lot differently we shouldn't be walking through this life like a poor man we shouldn't be walking through this life like a criminal we shouldn't be walking through this life with guilt and condemnation he by his blood hath made us kings and priests and we will reign on this earth amen and we know in the millennial reign we'll have a physical reign on this earth but brother branham tells us we're to be raiding now this was god's purpose all along back in exodus when they come out and they come to mount sinai moses goes up and he talks with god this is before the law was given friends this is before they accept the law so then moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel you have seen what i did unto the egyptian and how i bore you on eagle's wings what were the eagles wings the prophetic ministry through moses he brought him out of egypt and bore them on eagle's wings amen he said i bore you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself remember when god sets a pattern he never changes it we were stuck in egypt amen spiritual egypt amen in slavery and in bondage but he carried us out on eagle's wings because this is the eagle age this is the prophet age and he brought us out and he brought us unto himself this is speaking of the fourth seal now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel god's original intent was not to set a priesthood over the people his original intent was to make the people a priesthood that they would be priest unto the whole world amen that's god's original intent and god once he sets an intent he never changes it that's always been his original intent to have a people amen that he can bring out on eagle's wings and bring to himself deliver them out of bondage but deliver them out of slavery bring them unto himself and have a peculiar treasure amen a kingdom of priests a holy nation that's why peter picks this up in first peter 2 9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people because that was his original intention for deliverance that was his original intentions for eagle's wings that was original intention to bring him to himself to make them a peculiar treasure a chosen people a holy nation a kingdom of priests god hasn't changed his mind friends he's just waiting for a people to get in that condition revelation 19 he says he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords if he's the king of kings who are the kings he king singular is king of kings plural he lord singular is lord of lords plural who are the kings and who are the lords [Applause] amen we see this in revelations 19 when he's returning on a white horse and the armies of heaven follow after him amen and he has a name written king of kings where are the kings they're following after him and they're coming down to set up the kingdom of david upon the earth and he's going to sit a son of david upon the throne and we are going to rule and reign with him for a thousand years do you think there you're gonna walk around like ah just barely making it i can't hardly survive and we're just making ends me my goodness friends you're a king amen you're a lord upon the earth you're gonna act like it but it's time to act like it now not there now amen remember death doesn't change you it only changes your dwelling place amen redemption has brought us back by the washing of the water of the word full atonement is to bring us back as redeemed sons and daughters of god back to kings and priests upon the earth all kingdoms have failed all priesthood have failed every religion on the earth has failed every kingdom under the sun has failed they are everyone under the power of satan what this world needs is kings and priests in the church age book the revelation of jesus christ brother branham reads this scripture revelations 1 6 and he hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he he hath made us you didn't make yourself a king you didn't make yours there's no arrogance here there's no pride there's nothing puffed up you had nothing to do with that you were appointed you were ordained before the foundation of the world to stand on earth as a king and a priest amen you oh my goodness it's not your doing it's his doing and if you don't come to this position you're not honoring his will you're not honoring his word you're not honoring his desire when you stay in a broken down state and you stay in a pitiful state and unable to overcome you have missed the whole purpose of god and you are defying the very word and will of god because his word his will the restoration of the word to bring a fresh washing to the church to bring them back to their position as kings and priests [Applause] and when we let the world beat us down and let the world ridicule us and let the world name us and identify us we have missed the ordained purpose of god we've got to say what the word says and we got to say it until we believe it [Applause] i'm not a poor pitiful person barely making him you may be looking at my my fleshly condition amen but i don't care about my fleshly condition i have already amen moved into a spiritual condition by the new birth and i've been restored back across the chasm and i still stand with god as a fully redeemed son of god and i am on this earth as a representation of heaven an ambassador from heaven he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne so here brother branham is breaking it down we will sit as kings in the millennium but brother branham is not limited to it sometime over there he's saying right now we are spiritual kings and we better be acting like it friends amen we are king spiritual kings oh we are going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom that means you are reigning with christ today over a spiritual kingdom not a natural kingdom a spiritual kingdom so the question is in the spirit realm not the natural but the spirit realm who's in charge when the enemy comes in and brings sickness to your home in the spirit realm a demon power trying to afflict you who's in authority who's been made a spiritual king now who can take dominion over that now when an evil spirit starts to torment your mind amen that's the spirit realm not the natural realm the spirit realm when an evil spirit begins to torment your mind and trouble you amen that's a spiritual problem but we know that there's a king over the spiritual world and that king is the king of kings and that lord is the lord of lords and when we come to a spiritual kingdom then we have spiritual authority we need to exercise it with faith that doesn't mean you won't get sick that doesn't mean you won't stay sick god has things for you to overcome god has things to prove you to test you so you can make your choice he has things that he will put you through so that he can heap condemnation on the devil he will allow things in your life to condemn the devil amen but that doesn't mean we ever back down on the word amen god is sovereign he can do with this flesh what he wants but i will keep exercising my rights as a redeemed son of god i will keep saying what the word says because i have spiritual dominion adam had physical dominion as a as a he wasn't a redeemed son of god he was a full son of god and as a full son of god he had physical redemption he had physical dominion he was told to have dominion over the earth but as a fully redeemed son of god we've been given dominion also in the spirit world hallelujah continue on same quote and he quote he reads romans 5 17 for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more than which they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ so when are you going to reign in death after death no you're to reign in life are you alive are you in life then you're supposed to reign [Applause] why by the gift of righteousness you shall reign in life by one jesus christ remember you are as righteous as god is righteous because you have the you've been made the very righteousness of god and if you are the righteousness of god then there's no reason you can't have what you asked for colossians 1 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom brother branham and jack's reign the kingdom of his dear son right now we reign with christ having dominion now you want to know what you have dominion over dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil that's your dominion that's your reign he's king of kings and he's lord of lords and what's your lordship over what's your kingdom over it's over sin you don't have to sin you don't have to be subject to sin you don't have to give in to sin you've been given dominion as a redeemed son of god over sin you don't have to let that temptation take you you have a right to curse that thing and throw it right back on the devil where it came from you do you are the sin is subject to you you are not subject to sin you have been given dominion over sin start exercising dominion by your verbal decree by taking the word and placing it on your lips and taking dominion over that sin you have dominion over sin over the world this world doesn't have to tantalize you it doesn't have to discourage you it doesn't have to trick you and trap you and deceive you and it doesn't the glare the glow and the glitter doesn't have to pull you off you have dominion over the world over the flesh your flesh does not have to dominate you amen the scripture says possess that we we ought to know how to possess our vessels you are to possess your vessel your vessel is not to possess you this tabernacle that you see is possessed it's possessed by a redeemed son of god and that redeemed son of god has been given dominion over this flesh and i will exercise my dominion and i will not let this flesh condemn me black dog moves we've got a choker chain on him we'll just pull him right back amen you have dominion over sin the world the flesh and this is my favorite the devil the devil does not have dominion over you you as a redeemed son of god with a spiritual kingdom have dominion over the devil he must must must obey you [Applause] think about this when brother branham came they came to the prayer line amen he knew his position he knew his calling he knew the scriptures and when he was standing in line with the word and he had somebody believing in front of him he would say i adjure you in the name of jesus christ leave this person he didn't ask him pretty please he didn't say if you feel like it because he knew he was operating in a realm of dominion if you resist the devil he will flee hey that's the word he has no options resist him by the word we're having dominion over sin in the world and the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself whoa let's understand what we're reading i'll back up right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure that's the secret to this dominion it's the incarnation by the holy ghost of jesus christ in you both doing but doing the will and the dew of his good pleasure it's not you it's him yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus continuing on the same passage and made us priest yes priests unto him offering spiritual praise of sanctified lips friends you know there's nobody else on earth that can praise him he won't receive praise from unsanctified lips how are you going to be sanctified without the blood how are you going to have the blood without the word you are the only ones that can praise him and so you are a priesthood amen and you're offering spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives is a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning you're the only interceder that this world has the people you work with your family members there's no other place for intercession friends only through the priesthood after the order of melchizedek that's the only place that they'll find intercession to melchizedek is through the priesthood after the order of melchizedek we've been made kings and priests interceding and petitioning priests and kings unto our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us that's my favorite line in this whole quote no wonder when you see your position and what right you have in dominion you begin why would the world have any attraction to us anymore why would it have any pull on us anymore this is who we are no wonder the world does not appeal to us we are a peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father you're ordained to be kings and priests you have dominion amen dominion over sin dominion over the world dominion over the flesh and dominion over the devil right now you're gonna have to say it until you believe it you're gonna have to act on it till everything in your heart believes it take the word act on it believe it take your place and don't give any more ground to the devil brother branham tells a story and working on the holy spirit he says maybe you he's talking about this slave the slave trader goes to a plantation he sees a slave that's unlike all the other slaves he's a standout he's perfect in every way and he's starting to question the slave owner he says maybe you feed him better than you do the rest of them said no they all eat out of there in the galley together he said i don't feed him any different he's no boss he's just simply a slave so what makes him act different than the rest of them he said i didn't know that for a while but said you know one day i found out that his father is a king of the tribe and yet though he's an alien and away from home he keeps the morale of the rest of them up for he knows that he's a king's son i thought oh god though we be alienated here in a dark world amongst unbelief and skeptics and infidels and scoffers and laughters brother stick out your chest we're sons and daughters of the king let's act like men and women of the kingdom of god though we're an alien let's act like sons and daughters of god here you have a slave amen they never had to beat him into subjection they never had to encourage him in any way because he knew that he was the son of a king and no matter where he was on this earth and no matter how anybody treated him he was going to act like a king's son who in the world can move you away from that revelation it doesn't matter if your best friend treats you horrible it doesn't matter if somebody in the church treats you terrible what will cause you to stop acting like a son or daughter of god when you catch a revelation of who you are and where you're from it doesn't matter if they beat him with whips if they stole him from his homeland drove him far away subjected him to labor he still conducted himself like a king's son what is the devil going to do to you to stop you from acting like a king's son is he going to beat you and put you in subjection amen cause financial trouble cause family trouble cause sickness will you ever stop acting like a king's son no we've been given dominion we we're different than this slave this slave came came to a foreign land knowing he was a king son we came to a foreign land and we had no idea so we walked around beat down and beat up and discouraged and stepped on and falling in sin and no way to overcome and couldn't couldn't defeat the devil no matter how hard we try who remembers that condition no matter how hard you try you couldn't stop the addictions i mean you you couldn't stop the bad habits you couldn't stop the language you couldn't stop all these things no matter how hard you tried because you were in bondage but you had no idea who you were but then the eagle flew over and screamed and you realize whatever that is is what i am amen and you took to the skies and now the condition that you're in doesn't matter anymore because something on the inside's been awakened that you know that i'm a son i'm a daughter of the king of kings and though far from home i will conduct myself as a child of the king jesus was tempted by the devil took him into a wilderness place and tempted him and said took him up to a high high mountain he said showed him all the kingdoms of the world said if you'll bow down and worship me i'll give all this to you brother baby said he knew it was going to be his anyways see though he was far from home and though he was subjected into a condition you know jesus subjected himself to his earthly parents at the age of 12 he submitted himself unto them and went along with them letting them call the shots letting them make the rules he was subjected to this world amen he was subjected to the governments amen when they had to pay taxes he paid taxes but because he got dominion he knew where to get the money he lived in this world he was subject to this world but he still had dominion as the son of god he never lost his identification as a son of god no matter what they put him through no matter what they subjected him to he never lost his identification and satan trying to tempt him and he said i'll give you all of these and jesus knew it was going to be his anyways with no strings attached whatever the devil's tempting you with this whole world is going to be yours with no strings attached listen young people you have ambition you have desires want a home want a car want all this don't let the devil distract you by all those things because you're a joint heir with jesus christ you know what joint air means whatever he inherits you inherits you're joined to him in whatever he inherits you inherit and he's going to inherit the whole world that's your inheritance don't forget who you are one time jesus just knowing his identification he stands before an earthly governor named pilate not even caesar here you have the creator of the heavens and earth and a body he the king of kings the lord of lords the almighty god is standing here in an earthly form and a little puny governor is telling him don't you know i have power don't you know i have power to take your life don't you know i have power to give you life and jesus looked at him and he says you have no power other than what's been given you from above you see he was far from home when he was in this condition but he never forgot who he was don't let any government frighten you don't let anybody frighten you nothing can happen to you unless it's given unless authorities given from my father in heaven amen you have to know who you are stand your ground and never lose your position there's no magistrate there's no king there's no president there's no government that can do a thing to you unless it's permitted from above because i'm here as a representation as a king from a spiritual kingdom and unless that spiritual kingdom says so you can't do anything remember we were at the missionary conference just a couple months ago but ron and i were there and brother craig was there and there was a brother from ireland he's a missionary from ireland and he was there talking about he got arrested he was overseas somewhere in a communist nation i believe it was and he got arrested and they told him that they're going to throw him in prison and they told him that they're going to do all this stuff to him and you know what he said to them he said he told him he said i'm in the lion's mouth my head is in the lion's mouth and he told him he said if you can close your mouth close it he got off scot-free he knew his position there was no kingdom there was no authority on this earth going to do anything to him he was there doing the king's business he was there seeking the lost children he was there by a commission to go as a missionary and he knew hey if you have the ability to close your mouth close it because it's the will of god but if it's not the will of god you'll never clamp down on me you'll never cast me out you'll never hurt me if god wills it i want it but if god hasn't willed it you'll never get away with it friends we've got to know our position we've got to know who we are don't let every trial that comes knock you off of your position well maybe i'm not a child of god god brings those your way for you to have dominion over he gives those so he can prove to satan that you're not like the first steve you're a different kind of woman how are you going to prove it you have to be tested by the word and god will bring sickness and financial distress and hardship and church problems and all kinds of problems what's he doing he's trying to prove to satan that you're not like eve [Music] that trial just like for job that trial that came to job was to prove job to satan don't let it be anything else in your life don't let the devil whisper in your ear well maybe you're not a child of god maybe you don't have his favor amen job had his favor don't you let anything change your mind if you've been born again and you've encountered god and you know you're a child of god redeemed by the true atonement then you stand your ground and don't let anything move you from your position i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i will not change my confession because of circumstances i will not change my moral character i will not change my conduct i will not change my speech just because of the situation what i said in the good day i'll say it in the bad day when i say on the mountaintop i'll say it in the valley because i am a redeemed son of god given dominion over this earth we gotta act like it let's start acting like it god bless you let's stand hallelujah musicians if you can come on up brother

faith with the faith of our brother you know what his physical body is in a weakened condition but he knows that there's kings and priests on this earth and he's reaching out to kings and priests that

speak through these lips i give it to you now and i give myself completely to you and i ask that you would use me for your glory almighty god help me never to move back from this revelation but help
