========================================

he's he's saying David is is looking back to where he he's remembering his life and he says I remember when I sang his Praises in my childhood days when I heard in my sheep oh God take me back to that place take me back to my first love take me back and give me back my shepherd staff give me back my herd of sheep let me alone back there to worship you don't read ahead he says I want to go back he's hurt he's broken the the the the responsibility of carrying the promise is so great upon him the reproach is so great he'd rather go back right to his days of plowing the fields he'd rather go back to just the staff and the sheep and and and so what's compelling him to return is fear what's compelling him to return is unbelief what compelling him to return is discouragement in his life the word never said go back to being a shepherd of sheep word said you're the anointed king but David saying I don't see any manifestations of that promise in my life right now I do not see that I do not understand how you can do that so God take me back sometimes the fear of the unknown in front of us pushes us to go back to what's familiar but God says Don't Look Back it is vile in his sight to look back it is the mouth of the false prophet is the mouth of the Dragon in other words it's Antichrist to look back says Don't Look Back take the rear ofie mirr off cuz if you look back you're looking to the Antichrist and you'll crash Amen in your life and your Doctrine in your church don't look back but David in his discouragement says can't I just go back but let's not forget he's carrying the promise so now the very thing that becomes that has become his burden is the very thing that's going to resurrect him from the pit it's the very thing that's going to lift him from his discouragement that's sometimes we think that but we're in the heat of the battle something has got to be done we were boys once we're grownup men now the fight is on on I remember when the saos boiled up on the floor and the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't get around the place nowhere here for people but it's not that way today he says the battle is on it's not William brandham the little boy preacher anymore you got to produce something David you have to produce something it's not good enough that you were a shepherd and that you did it really good and you SL slayed the bear and you slayed the L that's good but that's not enough you need to produce something in your life there's got to be something different this time the time is on the battle is on the heat is on the time to be delivered the people Everyone is found written in the book now the time has come David is in his discouragement is trying to go back but something Rises up within David the very thing he's carrying that's causing discouragement Rises up within him and he says but you see he probably knew the story of Job And he says but I know my redeemer liveth but I know that one day I shall see God in this flesh though it be destroyed one day you will see God not when you die not when you Rapture but right now you have a promise of the word given to you calling you up saying you can do it you can do it cuz you're carrying the promise
