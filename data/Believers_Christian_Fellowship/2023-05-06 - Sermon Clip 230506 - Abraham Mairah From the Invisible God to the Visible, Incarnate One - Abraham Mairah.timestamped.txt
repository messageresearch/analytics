[0:00] then he comes down and in the message
[0:02] conference with God he says what are we
[0:05] his mouthpiece
[0:09] we submit ourselves to him and our
[0:11] worlds are not our words
[0:14] take no thought what you shall say cause
[0:16] it's not you that speaks it's the father
[0:18] that dwells in you amen he speaks
[0:25] so that same father
[0:29] that the disciples say show us your
[0:32] father
[0:33] now the prophet is telling us that that
[0:36] father now dwells in you
[0:40] you don't have to say oh show me the
[0:42] father father show me show me
[0:46] show you what
[0:50] do you want him to show you
[0:55] glory be to God
[0:59] God is purpose we find it here in
[1:02] sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose
[1:04] that God himself might dwell in his
[1:06] church and continue his plan through the
[1:09] church continue his plans
[1:12] through the church that is the purpose
[1:15] that God was in Christ continuing his
[1:18] plan through Christ out of Christ into
[1:21] the church continuing his work through
[1:23] the church so he came out of Christ eh
[1:31] since the prophet is speaking not him
[1:34] let me repeat that that God was in
[1:37] Christ containing his plans through
[1:39] Christ out of Christ into the church
[1:42] amen
[1:43] amen
[1:45] because Christ is the one now in the
[1:48] church they anointed the word
[1:50] so that office Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:54] of Nazareth
[1:56] empty praise God praise God
[2:01] amen oh where is he he's in a church
[2:05] he's in you
[2:08] amen and you are looking for him at an
[2:11] empty office
[2:14] dispensational change
[2:18] you believed in the Christ believe also
[2:21] in this world
[2:24] this is the final stage this is where he
[2:28] is he's here
[2:30] not here here
[2:34] so when the devil troubles it doesn't
[2:36] trouble your mind troubles your heart
[2:38] when he is no longer there he's not yet
[2:40] there you will get troubled then you are
[2:43] looking there you are looking for a
[2:44] solution from a wrong Source right
