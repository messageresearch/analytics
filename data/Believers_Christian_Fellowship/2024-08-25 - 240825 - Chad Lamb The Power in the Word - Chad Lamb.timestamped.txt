[14:49] again and so we're always glad to have
[14:51] her and any other visitors that are here
[14:53] you're very welcome may God bless you
[14:56] and while we're standing together we
[14:58] have our Bibles let's turn to Luke
[15:00] chapter
[15:01] 8 and we're going to take a look at the
[15:03] word here and trust the Lord to minister
[15:07] his word unto us amen Luke chapter
[15:11] 8 we're going to be begin reading at
[15:14] verse four we're going to read a very
[15:16] familiar portion of
[15:18] scripture and then draw from there Luke
[15:22] 8 verse
[15:25] 4 and when much people were gathered
[15:28] together and were come to him out of
[15:30] every city he spake by a parable a swer
[15:33] went out to sew his seed and as he sowed
[15:35] some fell by the wayside and it was
[15:37] trotten down and the fowls of the air
[15:39] devoured it and some fell upon a rock
[15:42] and as soon as it was sprung up it
[15:44] withered away because it lacked moisture
[15:47] and some fell among thorns and the
[15:49] Thorns sprang up with it and choked it
[15:51] and other fell on good ground and sprang
[15:54] up and bear fruit a h hundredfold and
[15:57] when he had said these things cried he
[15:59] that hath ears to hear Let Him hear and
[16:03] God bless you as you have your
[16:07] seats uh for a title this morning I just
[16:10] like to take the title the power in the
[16:12] word the power in the word and uh I've
[16:17] I've been meditating on this for quite a
[16:19] while it's one of those things that we
[16:20] always think about the word of God we're
[16:22] always meditating on and it's always uh
[16:25] striking Us in different ways and and uh
[16:28] it's something for me that's come up in
[16:30] conversation several times over the last
[16:32] month or maybe more when talking to
[16:34] people and and it's begin to I I begin
[16:36] to share some things from my own heart
[16:38] with others that I I thought were very
[16:40] beneficial to me and I just wanted to
[16:42] share that with you again today uh some
[16:45] things that I've just been seeing about
[16:47] the power that is in the word and uh we
[16:51] see here in this Parable Jesus is
[16:53] starting to explain to them about a
[16:55] sewer that goes forth to sew seed and
[16:57] and the seed ends up falling in
[16:59] different PL places and uh uh in the
[17:02] place that it falls it has a different
[17:04] effect but if some fell on good ground
[17:07] and sprang up and bear fruit H
[17:10] hundredfold and verse 9 it says and his
[17:13] disciples asked him saying what might
[17:14] this Parable be and he said unto you it
[17:18] is given to know the mysteries of the
[17:19] kingdom of God but to others in Parables
[17:22] that seeing they may not see and hearing
[17:24] they may not understand now the parable
[17:26] is this the seed is the word of God
[17:29] on those by the wayside are they that
[17:33] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[17:35] away the word out of their hearts lest
[17:37] they should believe and be saved they on
[17:40] the Rock are they which when they hear
[17:42] receive the word with joy and these have
[17:44] no root which for a while believe and in
[17:47] time of Temptation fall
[17:49] away and that which fell among Thorns
[17:51] are they which when they have heard go
[17:54] forth and are choked with cares and
[17:56] riches and pleasures of this life and
[17:58] bring bring no fruit to Perfection but
[18:01] that on the good ground are they which
[18:02] in the honest and good heart having
[18:04] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[18:07] fruit with patience so I would like to
[18:10] just look at the verse 15 and the the
[18:12] seed that fell in good
[18:14] ground when we look at the The Parables
[18:17] of God uh that Jesus Christ gave and
[18:19] there's so many different examples and
[18:21] analogies and Parables that God used to
[18:23] try to convey his message to try to
[18:26] convey a a truth to a people that are
[18:29] Limited in a human perspective he starts
[18:31] using all kinds of different analogies
[18:33] and here it's a seed s he's got a bag of
[18:36] seed and he's throwing the seed and when
[18:38] the seed falls into good ground the seed
[18:40] reproduces the life that's in the
[18:42] seed and so the the the the parable is
[18:48] he says the seed is the word of God and
[18:50] so but there's another Parable where
[18:53] where Jesus begins to explain that there
[18:55] was a man who sowed good seed in his
[18:57] field and
[18:59] and when he rested at night an enemy
[19:02] came in and and swed corrupt seed sowed
[19:04] weeds into the field and when they
[19:06] sprang up they begin to realize that
[19:08] there was a a mixed a mixed seed in here
[19:11] and the and the servants wanted to go to
[19:13] the lord of the field and ask him should
[19:15] we pluck them up he said no leave them
[19:16] till the Harvest time and we'll bind the
[19:18] tears together for burning and gather
[19:20] the wheed into the Garner and Jesus
[19:23] begins to explain now he begins to
[19:25] explain the seed are the sons of God are
[19:28] the children of God the the children of
[19:30] the son of man and so now we find that
[19:34] sometimes the seed are
[19:37] people and in this Parable the seed is
[19:40] the
[19:41] word but really when we realize what the
[19:44] message has taught us there's not much
[19:46] difference because the seed that's in US
[19:47] is also the word because it's part of
[19:50] God because the word amen the word was
[19:53] with God and the Word was God and so it
[19:57] it it's just too different ways of
[19:59] looking at the same thing to bring an
[20:01] analogy or an example or a way of
[20:03] teaching something for people to
[20:05] comprehend so we we we may be looking at
[20:08] both sides of this equation as the seed
[20:11] being that portion of the word that's
[20:13] you that's in your soul and the seed
[20:15] also being the portion of God that's in
[20:18] the word that's being preached or
[20:19] proclaimed or written in the word but
[20:21] it's the same thing it's different parts
[20:23] of the same person which is
[20:26] God Amen
[20:28] so God is is the culmination of his
[20:31] thoughts God is his thoughts amen but
[20:34] when God would begin to express himself
[20:36] he would Express himself as word that's
[20:38] the projection of thought amen when it
[20:40] begins to be be proclaimed that's word
[20:43] and then the word would go into a a
[20:45] process where by which would come into
[20:48] manifestation and as it come into
[20:49] manifestation it's the manifested word
[20:52] but through it all it's the original
[20:54] thought of God coming down and becoming
[20:56] more tangible to you and I upon this
[20:59] Earth so when he looks at this seed the
[21:02] seed is the word but in the other
[21:06] Parable we didn't take time to read it
[21:07] because we know it so well the other
[21:09] Parable the the the ground then is the
[21:15] world and the seed some were the
[21:18] children of the enemy and some are the
[21:19] children of
[21:21] God in this Parable the seed is the word
[21:24] of God and the good ground are the
[21:26] children of God where the seed Falls
[21:28] Falls the right place for it to fall so
[21:30] that it can reproduce itself 100 fold
[21:33] sir amen so I would say it this way and
[21:37] hopefully you can just hang with me we
[21:39] all know the message well enough we can
[21:40] stick together sometimes you're the dirt
[21:43] and sometimes you're the
[21:47] seed amen so just get comfortable
[21:50] sometimes being the dirt and sometimes
[21:51] being the seed it'll be okay then as we
[21:55] move forward let's back up to Genesis
[21:57] chap 1
[22:01] now and now with those things laid out
[22:03] we're going to just continue with our
[22:05] thought because the uh the things that I
[22:07] want to say we need to have this
[22:13] understanding uh the one thing that
[22:15] happens to us when we run analogies is
[22:18] sometimes we get confused when we run
[22:20] analogies or we use uh examples or
[22:22] Parables to explain the truth and and
[22:24] there's two things that happen one is we
[22:28] limit to truth to only that analogy so
[22:30] now we can only see ourselves as dirt we
[22:32] can never see ourselves as a seed you
[22:34] understand what I'm saying we can get so
[22:36] hone down says no that's not what the
[22:37] Bible said the Bible said the seed is
[22:39] the word of God and I'm the dirt amen
[22:41] but but another time amen the the
[22:44] analogy said that the dirt is the world
[22:45] and you're the
[22:46] seed so the problem with you these
[22:49] analogies and Parables is if we hone in
[22:51] on it so tight we'll refuse to receive
[22:53] any other truth that uses another type
[22:56] or Shadow the other thing is we run that
[22:59] analogy so far it no longer becomes
[23:03] true we start to add all kinds of stuff
[23:05] to it and we start talking about mineral
[23:07] content of dirt and all kinds of stuff
[23:09] we add to it and Clay mix and that
[23:12] wasn't even the purpose anyways we just
[23:13] grab an analogy we run our own intellect
[23:15] to it and run it so far that thing's not
[23:17] even true
[23:19] anymore so we just got to take it for
[23:22] what it is a way for God to explain to
[23:24] us a truth and grab these truth and let
[23:26] the truth combine themselves out of
[23:28] different analogies and different
[23:29] there's times that that brother Brenham
[23:31] himself will use Noah and the Ark to
[23:34] explain the 144,000 that are carried
[23:36] through the tribulation period there's
[23:38] other times that he uses it to talk
[23:39] about the elect the redeemed bride amen
[23:42] that are carried above in the wedding
[23:44] supper right he using the same
[23:47] scriptures if we get too tight on one
[23:49] we'll refuse the other but they're both
[23:51] true
[23:53] amen and so in in Genesis
[23:56] 1:9 he says and God said let the waters
[23:59] under the heaven be gathered together
[24:00] into one place and let the dry land
[24:02] appear and it was so and God called the
[24:05] dry land Earth and the Gathering
[24:07] Together the waters called he the Seas
[24:09] and God saw that it was good and God
[24:11] said let the Earth bring forth grass the
[24:14] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[24:16] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[24:18] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[24:21] so and the Earth brought forth grass and
[24:23] Herb yielding seed after his kind and
[24:26] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[24:29] in itself after his kind and God saw
[24:32] that it was good and the evening and the
[24:34] morning were the third day now brother
[24:36] bam goes to this scripture when he
[24:38] preaches there's two messages I'm going
[24:39] to quote from quite a bit today and I
[24:41] may not always reference them but you
[24:42] can you can rest assure it's probably
[24:44] from one of these two and they're both
[24:46] in 1965 one is the power of
[24:49] transformation and the other one is
[24:52] God's power to
[24:53] transform he preached them I think just
[24:55] a uh a little over a month apart
[24:59] uh and they basically handling the same
[25:01] subject and he starts off by going all
[25:03] the way back to Genesis and showing that
[25:06] there was seeds that was laying there
[25:07] and we know in the fourth seal he tells
[25:09] us those seeds were from some previous
[25:11] civilization or something they were a
[25:13] creation of God they were a spoken word
[25:16] creation of God because brother Brenham
[25:18] says he created those seeds by his
[25:20] spoken word that's how everything was
[25:22] made by by God's word so the seeds were
[25:25] laying there they were laying there by
[25:27] by uh a at a but something that happened
[25:30] at a previous time to Genesis
[25:35] 13 okay so in Genesis 1:1 we find that
[25:39] God created uh the heavens and the Earth
[25:42] period and the wor was without form and
[25:44] void and darkness was upon the face of
[25:45] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[25:47] upon the face of the waters so we find
[25:49] out that in Genesis 1:1 speaks that God
[25:52] created the heavens and the Earth
[25:53] brother said period then there's a big
[25:55] gap and we don't know what the Gap is
[25:57] amen but some something happened upon
[25:59] the Earth and now and where where God is
[26:02] going to pick up the story for you and I
[26:04] the story of redemption for you and I in
[26:06] Genesis 1:2 he begins to show us that
[26:09] the the Earth is in in a form of
[26:11] judgment and it's void and darkness and
[26:13] shapeless and there's nothing there but
[26:15] uh but but he begins to reveal amen
[26:18] through the Book of Genesis that brother
[26:19] B picks up that that it was void on the
[26:22] surface it was all darkness and nothing
[26:24] there but down under their Waters there
[26:26] was seeds from another civil ization or
[26:29] something so he begins and then this
[26:32] says that the spirit of God moved upon
[26:34] the waters and then and then God began
[26:37] to speak and as God began to speak the
[26:40] order of his speech begins to move
[26:42] things into place it begins to move the
[26:44] heavenly bodies and part the waters and
[26:47] allow light to strike the Earth and and
[26:49] it begins to arrange this creation or
[26:53] I'd say mold it remold it into a way
[26:56] amen and and then he calls for the the
[26:58] seed to bring forth upon the Earth but
[27:00] the seed is to bring forth after its
[27:02] kind which means that that that seed
[27:05] that was already there can that come up
[27:08] and be something different than the seed
[27:10] that was than the life that was already
[27:11] in it it was already a certain life
[27:14] there but he was calling for it to come
[27:17] and he was calling for the the the the
[27:19] herb yielding seeds uh after its kind
[27:23] and the tree after its kind and the
[27:24] fruit bearing after its kind because it
[27:27] all had to come forth after its
[27:29] kind
[27:31] amen so in the message power of
[27:34] transformation he says now 6,000 years
[27:36] God taken to make this and we see in
[27:39] Genesis 1 yet now we see God had an
[27:43] objective that he wanted to bring to
[27:44] pass and so many people in teaching on
[27:47] Genesis back here in the first chapter
[27:49] in the second chapter third chapter
[27:50] especially it looks like that God
[27:52] repeats himself or he said he went ahead
[27:54] and said all these things that he did uh
[27:57] let there be light and let there be this
[28:00] and let there come forth and there
[28:01] wasn't even one thing yet wasn't nothing
[28:04] there wasn't light the old world was
[28:06] still floating out there and that
[28:07] Darkness covered over with water but see
[28:10] he had spoken his word and then that's
[28:12] when he was speaking so he says that's
[28:15] when he was speaking when was he
[28:16] speaking he was speaking when there was
[28:18] nothing nothing tangible nothing visible
[28:20] nothing happening nothing moving but he
[28:23] spoke his word and when he spoke his
[28:25] word the word went forth and began to
[28:28] put things in motion and began to move
[28:31] and brother bam said he said let there
[28:32] be L he said it might have been 700
[28:34] years later and he uses other numbers in
[28:36] other places but it could have been many
[28:39] many years a long period of time before
[28:41] the sun actually started to shine upon
[28:43] the earth when we first read it we think
[28:45] he said let the let the sun shine let
[28:48] there be light and immediately bam that
[28:50] that that sunlight was hitting the Earth
[28:52] but he says no amen it started a
[28:54] sequence of events amen where things
[28:56] begin to match the word that God had
[28:58] spoken to bring to pass what he spoke
[29:01] but it could have been hundreds and
[29:02] hundreds of years before it
[29:06] happened and and if we just think like
[29:10] we we all we're all in the same category
[29:12] we're all human beings and being human
[29:14] beings is a
[29:18] travesty because because of of sin and
[29:21] perversion and hybridization and all the
[29:24] other things that that has happened to
[29:26] us and that man has done and we' done to
[29:28] ourselves amen we've got this narrow
[29:30] such this narrow view that we we can
[29:33] only see things in this this tiny a
[29:36] frail
[29:39] perspective and because of that when
[29:41] things happen like this let's just take
[29:42] for instance this this this Revelation
[29:45] that we have that God said let there be
[29:47] light amen so let there be light and now
[29:50] all of a sudden uh uh if you were a
[29:52] human being on the earth at that time he
[29:53] said let there be light and then nothing
[29:57] happens let there be light and you wait
[30:00] a day a week a year two years nothing
[30:04] happens in our narrow Vision with our
[30:07] humanistic perspective we begin to say
[30:09] oh I guess it didn't
[30:12] work this is what brother br's trying to
[30:14] show us when when he says by his stripes
[30:17] you're already healed that's a finished
[30:19] work but he never promised how long it
[30:21] would take for the healing to come he
[30:23] said just believe it until amen because
[30:25] God's not limited by time and he never
[30:28] gave a promise of time he never told you
[30:30] was instantly but yet he said it amen
[30:32] and if the faith in your heart can reach
[30:34] up and grab it and say it's finished
[30:36] it's finished amen for you but it still
[30:39] might be Darkness for 700 more years
[30:42] upon the Earth but that doesn't change
[30:44] anything because the word was
[30:47] spoken and so that's our that's the
[30:50] human side that we all have to fight
[30:52] against so hard because when it doesn't
[30:54] happen after a year and it doesn't
[30:55] happen after two years and it doesn't
[30:57] happen after 10 years amen we begin to
[30:59] say well maybe I misheard maybe I
[31:01] misunderstood maybe there was something
[31:03] wrong and and and we go through all of
[31:05] this mind battles as a human being amen
[31:08] but then 700 years later when we've just
[31:11] kind of given up on everything and and
[31:13] we didn't realize what was happening and
[31:16] we got discouraged and desponded and
[31:17] started walking in darkness and lost
[31:19] hope and then all of a sudden something
[31:21] changes and light begins to hit the
[31:23] earth and goes ping all of a sudden we
[31:25] say what just happened where did that
[31:27] come from that was a miracle I never saw
[31:30] that coming am God must have just done
[31:35] something and the reality is God didn't
[31:37] just do something he did it 700 years
[31:39] later the effect of it is coming later
[31:42] but when it happens is not when God
[31:44] starts to do something that's the
[31:46] culmination of what he already started
[31:48] by speaking the
[31:50] word right see these are so important
[31:53] for us to become the the the word of God
[31:56] was sent to us in this generation for a
[31:57] reason and it was to make us mature
[31:59] Believers so that we didn't step stop
[32:02] stop falling in this narrow Vision
[32:04] category where we keep getting
[32:06] despondent and discouraged and and upset
[32:08] and and and we we look at things
[32:10] temporal and we look at things in the
[32:12] immediate and we begin to lose heart and
[32:14] lose faith in what God is doing but he
[32:16] begins to tell us these things for a
[32:18] reason so that we can understand how God
[32:20] works in our lives and if we have any
[32:22] length of time on us we can begin to
[32:24] look back and say that's exactly how God
[32:26] works in our lives that's exact ly what
[32:28] happens a word is spoken something
[32:30] happens he triggers a response in my
[32:32] heart and I think that my trial is going
[32:35] to be over when I wake up in the morning
[32:37] and I wake up just as much In the Heat
[32:39] of the battle as I was the day before
[32:41] and I think what happened to me that I
[32:42] miss something what's wrong I must have
[32:44] been mistaken there was no mistake that
[32:47] was absolutely the word of God in your
[32:49] life and you received it by faith now
[32:51] you just need to hold still and let that
[32:53] word take in effect because that word is
[32:56] what will bring the results
[32:58] amen not 5 years later when all of a
[33:01] sudden the circumstances change and and
[33:03] and all a sudden you're like wow what
[33:05] just happened to me God just decided to
[33:07] move God moved in my life and I didn't
[33:10] even
[33:13] pray don't you forget the agonizing
[33:15] prayer from 10 years
[33:20] ago don't you remember taking him at his
[33:22] word 10 15 20 that's what's happening
[33:26] today yeah amen
[33:31] amen see being Limited in in in Earthly
[33:34] Vision being stuck in a carnal mind
[33:37] being Limited in a in 80 to 90 years of
[33:40] time upon this Earth is a travesty to
[33:44] us because it's contrary to the way God
[33:47] works so we must we must spiritually
[33:51] lift
[33:53] higher so when he was speaking this
[33:56] there was nothing there was darkness no
[33:58] no no threat of evidence that there was
[34:00] going to be anything changed but he
[34:02] spoke
[34:06] it and and brother M goes on to say now
[34:09] we notice here in Genesis 1 and he
[34:11] formed man in his own image and his own
[34:12] likeness and the image of God made he he
[34:15] made him male and female he was making
[34:17] man he just spoke the word then we find
[34:19] out after his many days had had passed
[34:22] maybe hundreds and hundreds of years
[34:24] there was still no man to till the soil
[34:25] nobody to till the soil so then God
[34:28] formed a Man Out of the Dust of the
[34:29] earth see he had spoke the word and then
[34:32] the word had to take place now when he
[34:35] said let there be light maybe there
[34:37] might have been hundreds of years maybe
[34:39] 800 years before there was ever was a
[34:42] light but it came to pass because God
[34:44] said so and God is going to have a
[34:47] church I don't care how many Dark Ages
[34:50] we go through and whatever more he is
[34:53] going to have a church without spot or
[34:56] wrinkle that's right whether we are part
[34:58] of it or not because he has already said
[35:00] it was going to happen it's going to be
[35:03] there am praise God all right now in
[35:08] God's power to transform he says I think
[35:10] this morning in Genesis 1 the world was
[35:12] without form and it was void and
[35:14] darkness was upon the Earth nothing but
[35:16] a complete chaos and when this world was
[35:18] in that condition the spirit of God
[35:21] moved upon the face of the water and the
[35:23] entire picture was changed from a total
[35:26] chaos to a Garden of
[35:29] Eden that is transforming power of God
[35:32] that can take something that nothing and
[35:34] make something wonderful out of it God's
[35:37] transforming
[35:38] power so I want to keep this I I want to
[35:42] paint a perspective I want to paint a
[35:44] picture and I I want to try to keep
[35:45] these things in a in a balance in our
[35:47] mind he said when spirit of God moved
[35:50] upon the face of the water the entire
[35:52] picture was changed from Total Chaos to
[35:55] a Garden of Eden
[35:58] and you ask yourself what brought about
[36:00] the change what changed
[36:02] everything and he said he says here the
[36:05] spirit of God moved and it changed
[36:07] everything but this is in God's power to
[36:10] transform but in in uh the whatever the
[36:13] other message was power of
[36:15] transformation brother Benham said it
[36:17] was the effect of a spoken
[36:19] word so it was the effect of a spoken
[36:22] word or was it the effect of the Holy
[36:25] Ghost or are these things working in
[36:28] conjunction with one another as two
[36:30] entities of the same thing because the
[36:33] spirit of God begin to brood and then be
[36:35] God began to
[36:36] say Amen so it was the spoken word of
[36:39] God and the Holy Ghost was there to see
[36:41] that it came to pass because he's the
[36:44] life brother Ben said he's the lifegiver
[36:45] to the word and so it it if I could say
[36:49] it this way and and just just bear with
[36:51] me because every time I make a statement
[36:53] you can always listen especially if
[36:55] you're well versed in your season you
[36:56] can always say but there's another point
[36:58] I know there's another point but I'm
[37:00] making a
[37:01] point there's always another Point amen
[37:04] but but I'm making a point and the point
[37:06] that I'm making is that of course it was
[37:09] the brooding of the Holy Ghost but the
[37:11] Holy Ghost wasn't doing nothing until
[37:13] God said and when God said now the Holy
[37:15] Ghost was making what was said come to
[37:17] pass am so we we can say it it's going
[37:21] to be the work of the Holy Ghost that
[37:22] changes my
[37:24] life but it's going to be the spoken
[37:27] word that changes your life because it's
[37:29] the power of the Holy Ghost that makes
[37:30] the word come to
[37:33] pass
[37:35] amen so it's not as though we're going
[37:38] to get there without the spoken
[37:40] word that's my point amen if so God
[37:44] could have just sent the Holy Ghost to
[37:46] brood over the Earth and bring
[37:49] everything to pass but that's not the
[37:52] that's not the pattern he showed he sent
[37:54] the Holy Ghost to brood and then he said
[37:56] let there be let there be let there be
[37:59] and it all moved in accordance to his
[38:02] word and the spirit worked in
[38:03] conjunction with the word and brought
[38:05] the word to pass upon the
[38:07] Earth
[38:10] amen so let's keep moving and again in
[38:14] God's power of transformation said
[38:15] therefore he created by his word he sent
[38:19] his word so all the seeds that he had
[38:22] placed upon the Earth he formed those
[38:24] seeds by his own word for there was
[38:26] nothing else to make the seed out of he
[38:28] had placed them and they were beneath
[38:30] the water he just said let there be this
[38:33] and let there be that so here he says it
[38:35] was his spoken word that created the
[38:38] seed so what was laying under the water
[38:41] God's spoken word
[38:43] amen yeah but there was a life in those
[38:46] seeds so what was bringing the
[38:49] conditions to change to bring the life
[38:50] out of the seeds also the spoken word of
[38:53] God so where was the spoken word of God
[38:56] it was the word that created those seeds
[38:57] that were laying under the darkness but
[38:59] it was also the spoken word of God that
[39:01] was moving all the circumstances Amen to
[39:03] bring life out of the seed that was
[39:06] there so that it could come into
[39:07] manifestation it was both the spoken
[39:09] word of
[39:11] God
[39:13] Amen and so now although the
[39:18] although in creation although the word
[39:21] the spoken word of God Amen that had
[39:23] created a seed was already laying there
[39:26] on the in the Earth under the Judgment
[39:29] uh uh condition of the Earth the
[39:31] darkness even though it was there amen
[39:34] it was going to take a spoken word amen
[39:38] to bring the life out of that seed and
[39:40] that spoken word was going to have to
[39:42] rearrange the conditions and bring the
[39:44] conditions about that was conducive to
[39:46] life that was in this seed amen and it
[39:48] was going to take the spoken word to
[39:51] bring to manifestation the spoken word
[39:54] that was in the seed and these two
[39:55] things had to come together to bring the
[39:58] life of the seed into manifestation and
[40:00] the reality of that is that's exactly
[40:03] where where you and I are we come into
[40:05] this world shrouded in darkness
[40:07] according to the New Testament amen our
[40:09] minds darkened to the things of God Amen
[40:11] we come into this world covered over in
[40:13] darkness because of our sinful birth
[40:15] amen and we we are shrouded in darkness
[40:18] we're in a state of judgment amen but
[40:20] down on the inside there's seed laying
[40:23] there from some other civilization or
[40:25] something and it's laying there and you
[40:27] say well the seed's already there the
[40:29] seed will come to life the seed will
[40:31] this the seed will that the seed yes it
[40:33] will but it's going to take the same
[40:35] thing it took in Genesis it's going to
[40:37] take the spoken word of God to move the
[40:39] conditions in place Amen to call forth
[40:42] the life of that seed to come
[40:44] [Music]
[40:46] for and so in God's Great
[40:50] economy he knew where those seeds would
[40:52] land but he knew how to bring the life
[40:54] forth from the sea amen so in doing that
[40:58] he was going to use the spoken word and
[41:01] God in the beginning himself was
[41:03] speaking let there be let there be let
[41:06] there be let there be but then in God's
[41:09] economy he moved into man when man come
[41:11] on the earth and he began to speak
[41:13] through His prophets he began to speak
[41:14] through Adam Adam begin to say let it be
[41:17] that when a man leaves his father and
[41:19] mother of Cleveland to his wife that was
[41:20] the word of God Amen then he moved
[41:24] through prophets and he and he moved
[41:26] through the prophets in the old
[41:27] Testament he moved through Abraham he
[41:28] moved through David he moved through all
[41:30] these prophets amen but now God's
[41:32] economy is such that his word has to be
[41:36] preached under the preaching of the word
[41:39] and I want to talk for a little bit
[41:41] about how important it is to have the
[41:44] preaching of the
[41:47] Gospel let's turn together to 1
[41:49] Corinthians 1
[42:08] 1 Corinthians chapter
[42:16] 1 and then let's begin 1 Corinthians 1
[42:19] begin with verse
[42:23] 17 for Christ sent me not to baptize but
[42:26] to preach the go gospel not with wisdom
[42:28] of words lest the Cross of Christ should
[42:30] be made of none effect for the preaching
[42:33] of the Cross is to them that perish
[42:35] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[42:38] it is the power of God for it is written
[42:41] I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
[42:43] and I will bring to nothing the
[42:44] understanding of The Prudent where is
[42:46] the wise where is the Scribe where is
[42:48] the disputer of this world hath not God
[42:50] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[42:52] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[42:54] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[42:56] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[42:59] save them that
[43:01] believe so God was going to use the
[43:03] foolishness of preaching to save them
[43:06] that
[43:07] believe now when when we look at this
[43:10] word
[43:11] save sometimes we have an understanding
[43:14] of of words but that understanding is
[43:16] maybe a traditional understanding and uh
[43:20] uh we had a minister here not long ago
[43:22] I'm not really recollecting exactly who
[43:24] it was but started to talk to us about
[43:26] this word SA
[43:27] and in the Greek it's the word Soo this
[43:30] word Soo is is what was translated saved
[43:32] here by the foolishness of preaching to
[43:34] save them that believe and the
[43:36] definition of this is to save to keep
[43:39] save and sound to rescue from danger or
[43:43] destruction it also means uh
[43:47] healing or to make whole it means uh uh
[43:52] to save a suffering one for example one
[43:56] suffering from disease to make well heal
[43:58] restore to health to preserve one who is
[44:01] in danger of Destruction to save or to
[44:04] rescue so this word save he used the
[44:06] foolishness of preaching to save them
[44:09] that believe when we if we look at that
[44:11] word with a traditional I would say a
[44:13] traditional Christian denominational
[44:15] understanding then we know it takes the
[44:17] foolishness of preaching to save the
[44:19] siners so that they can recognize their
[44:21] a sinner and hear the gospel and and
[44:22] they recognize it and be saved amen and
[44:25] if we look at it with that just narrow
[44:28] definition then we say the foolishness
[44:30] of a preaching has accomplished its goal
[44:32] when the person is eternally
[44:36] secure but that's not exact that's not
[44:39] the full extent of what save
[44:42] means it also means to restore to health
[44:45] or to make
[44:48] whole and it takes the foolishness of
[44:51] preaching for us to recognize the gospel
[44:52] and recognize Christ died for us and
[44:54] give our life to him but it takes the
[44:56] foolishness of preaching to heal us from
[44:58] this life to heal us from false
[45:00] understand to heal us from all the
[45:02] things that we've suffered one to make
[45:04] us whole are to bring us back into
[45:06] complete health or
[45:09] adoption to bring us into our ought to
[45:11] be condition and so it's used in the
[45:14] Bible save 94 times make whole nine
[45:17] times heal three times be whole twice so
[45:21] it's more than just this recognition I'm
[45:23] a sinner I need to be saved if that's
[45:25] all it was then you only need to hear
[45:27] one message give your heart to the Lord
[45:28] and the foolishness of preaching was
[45:30] finished for you but I'm I'm here to say
[45:32] we need the foolishness of preaching
[45:34] every day of Our Lives we need it
[45:36] consistently and constantly because we
[45:38] come to this world sick we come to this
[45:40] world Darkness amen we've got this Human
[45:42] Condition amen it's going to take the
[45:43] foolishness of preaching to make us
[45:45] whole to heal us to bring us back into a
[45:48] healthy condition as a Son of God so it
[45:51] is going to require the foolishness of
[45:55] preaching that is God's method that is
[45:59] God's way and it's amazing that when we
[46:01] come through uh uh uh all the apostles
[46:05] understood
[46:07] this all the all the church leaders down
[46:11] through the history of the church they
[46:12] understood this and brother Brenham
[46:15] himself understood this because this is
[46:18] what he said this see what he taught us
[46:20] to do that actually we need the inspired
[46:25] preaching of the word
[46:28] we still needed every much as as we
[46:30] needed it and in the Apostle Paul's day
[46:32] we needed every much today because it's
[46:34] that inspired preaching of the word when
[46:36] God takes the foolishness of preaching
[46:38] why is it foolishness of preaching amen
[46:41] because God just takes a man who's like
[46:43] any other man who's a a frail Fallen
[46:47] human being who's loaded with all kinds
[46:50] of mistakes and inadequacies and he
[46:51] doesn't even pull the best he usually
[46:54] picks the uneducated or the
[46:55] inexperienced or whatever and he takes
[46:58] them and he and he he has a gift planted
[47:00] in them but he fills them with the
[47:02] spirit he anoints them with the
[47:03] inspiration and they come up and they
[47:05] speak words amen and brother B said the
[47:07] hardest thing God's ever had to do is
[47:09] get one man to believe in another man
[47:11] because why because we know what man
[47:14] is and I'll tell you another thing about
[47:16] the foolishness of preaching the
[47:17] foolishness of preaching is such a way
[47:20] that you can sit in your seat and you
[47:22] can see the foibles of that man and
[47:24] sometimes you can see his complexes and
[47:26] you can actually while you're under the
[47:28] preaching of the word you can make a
[47:30] comment and you can disagree with the
[47:31] comment but it doesn't change the fact
[47:33] that the preaching of the word is going
[47:35] to save
[47:38] us telling you it's
[47:42] weird it's
[47:46] weird we make we we can go two extremes
[47:50] under the fitions of preaching be wrong
[47:52] we can go to the side that all of them
[47:55] are frailed all of them are human all of
[47:57] them mess up the word they all make
[48:00] mistakes and I'm not going to have
[48:01] anything to do with them because I don't
[48:02] want anything tainted in my
[48:04] life or we can go to the other side
[48:06] everything that comes out of his mouth
[48:08] when he's behind the pull pit is thus
[48:09] sayeth the Lord he's under an
[48:11] inspiration there's no more man there
[48:13] that's just
[48:16] God if we go to either one of these
[48:18] extremes we're going to find ourselves
[48:20] derailed am the truth is always in the
[48:24] middle I mean sometimes The Man Behind
[48:27] the pull pit he tries to tell a joke and
[48:29] it
[48:30] flops don't pin that on
[48:34] God that may not have been the
[48:36] inspiration of the Holy Spirit tries to
[48:39] tell a funny story and nobody gets
[48:42] it that's the foolishness of
[48:45] preaching it it's
[48:49] dangerous it's
[48:51] risky it's prone to mistakes
[48:57] that's just the
[48:59] truth but it's God's
[49:01] way and if we avoid it if we disrespect
[49:05] it right if we over inflate
[49:08] it we're going to be in error we have to
[49:11] take it the way God sent it amen amen
[49:15] can you imagine being in the first the
[49:17] first church and you and you hear that
[49:20] the Apostle Paul and uh Barnabas they
[49:23] got so upset with each other they got in
[49:25] a fight and they won't even work
[49:26] together
[49:28] anymore can you imagine being
[49:30] disappointed and can you imagine the
[49:32] division that says well I I know
[49:34] Barnabas Barnabas is a good man that
[49:35] can't be barnabas' fault and and your
[49:38] brother's like wait a minute no I know
[49:40] the Apostle Paul and listen I've been
[49:42] with Barnabas and Barnabas can get testy
[49:44] sometimes and every once in a while he
[49:45] makes snarky
[49:49] comments yes sir you have two champions
[49:51] in the early church and man it was
[49:53] Barnabas who introduced Paul to the
[49:55] church it wasn't Paul first it was
[49:57] Barnabas first and then Paul was called
[49:58] to be a light unto the Gentiles to Bear
[50:00] the word and now they have a contention
[50:02] so sharp they won't work together they
[50:04] separate no work together can you
[50:05] imagine the next time you go to hear one
[50:07] of them preach you think who was right
[50:09] and who was wrong and what all the
[50:11] rumors that I'm hearing and blah blah
[50:12] blah but it didn't change the fact that
[50:14] this is God's appointed
[50:17] way amen that's why it it absolutely
[50:21] takes God on both ends it takes God all
[50:24] the way around because it's fraught with
[50:26] with Frailty it's prone to mistake it is
[50:30] weak I mean it's weak weak all the way
[50:32] around it's weak amen but it is God's
[50:35] provided way and if we come God's
[50:37] provided way and ask God to meet us his
[50:40] provided way I believe God is obligated
[50:42] to his word and that he's going to
[50:44] choose the foolishness of preaching to
[50:46] save those that
[50:48] believe so we need the
[50:51] inspired live preaching of the word
[50:54] through men that God has called to pre
[50:56] preach the
[50:57] gospel that doesn't make him superheroes
[51:00] and that doesn't make him right in
[51:01] everything they do that just makes them
[51:03] a vessel that God's chose to use to
[51:05] fulfill his
[51:07] word amen it also doesn't make him the
[51:10] Public
[51:12] Enemy it just makes him a vessel that
[51:15] God's
[51:17] chose to fulfill his
[51:20] word
[51:23] amen Jesus told his disciples
[51:27] in Mark 16 go you into all the world and
[51:29] preach the
[51:31] gospel this is the Great Commission go
[51:34] to preach the gospel to Every Creature
[51:36] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[51:37] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[51:40] be damned and these signs shall follow
[51:42] them that believe in my name shall they
[51:44] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[51:45] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[51:47] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[51:49] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[51:51] on the sick and they shall recover when
[51:54] he sent this when he sent these uh these
[51:56] men now when you look at the lives of
[51:58] these men you want to talk about
[52:00] weakness and fraught with problems and
[52:02] the ability to make
[52:04] mistakes but Jesus sent them these
[52:06] disciples and said preach the gospel to
[52:08] Every Creature those that believe are
[52:10] baptized and believe shall be saved and
[52:12] those that don't believe shall be damned
[52:14] then he says these Shin shall follow
[52:15] them that believe all of a sudden what
[52:18] he's what he's telling us is you go and
[52:21] preach the gospel those that believe
[52:23] will be saved and those that believe
[52:26] shall have the life of the word manifest
[52:29] inside of them it's not just words but
[52:31] there's a life that'll be conveyed to
[52:33] those who believe amen they will have
[52:36] this life that's in Christ that life
[52:38] will be in them because it's doing more
[52:40] than speaking words but it's bringing
[52:42] forth a life because there's a power in
[52:45] the preaching of the word and the
[52:46] preaching of the word the power of the
[52:48] preaching of the word is that there's a
[52:49] spirit that comes with it there's a life
[52:51] that's attached to it and those that
[52:54] believe he says will have the life
[52:57] following them when you preach the
[53:00] gospel so it's a I can say it this way
[53:04] it's a conveyance or a transfer of a
[53:07] life amen it's not just an intellectual
[53:12] speech it's not a
[53:15] speech it's not a debate amen it is not
[53:19] man just talking talking points but
[53:22] according to the Great Commission amen
[53:25] if there's a preaching of gospel those
[53:27] that believe shall have the life of the
[53:29] Gospel following the gospel showing
[53:31] you're conveying more than bullet points
[53:34] you're conveying a life amen
[53:41] right let's go to acts 16 together
[54:05] acts 16 and
[54:10] n and before I read this don't read that
[54:13] look
[54:15] up shouldn't even told you where to go I
[54:19] let out all my
[54:20] secrets I was just thinking it just
[54:22] struck me just when I went to look down
[54:24] I didn't pull up the quote so I don't
[54:25] have it exactly right
[54:27] but do you remember when brother
[54:30] bham uh began to talk about what how he
[54:34] views the uh the civil rights movement
[54:37] in his day and what Martin Luther King
[54:40] was doing and the Rebellion that was
[54:41] coming because of it and he thought he
[54:43] was going to lead a million of his
[54:45] people to death remember that brother B
[54:49] says those things and and he comes back
[54:55] like a week later and I I if I could
[54:57] pull the quotes I would tell you exactly
[54:58] but he comes back a week later and that
[55:01] next week he says now I said that about
[55:04] uh Martin Luther King and those poor
[55:05] people he says now that was just my
[55:08] opinion and here's what he said he says
[55:11] you need to know when it's my opinion
[55:14] and when it's the word
[55:18] right and I found out why he did that
[55:20] later I was talking to a brother who
[55:22] grew up in the Tabernacle and that that
[55:24] brother was telling me he said it was
[55:26] his mom that that caused brother benam
[55:28] to come back and say that because his
[55:30] mother met brother benam in a grocery
[55:32] store that week and she looked at
[55:34] brother BR said brother brm isn't that
[55:36] awful that a million of those poor black
[55:38] people are going to
[55:41] die and that struck brother Brenham she
[55:44] was convinced that a million poor black
[55:47] people were going to die because of what
[55:50] the prophet said and then he comes back
[55:52] and he says now that was just my
[55:54] opinion right
[55:56] now this is this is Brother Chad I'm
[55:59] going to give you brother Chad so you
[56:00] don't have to believe it but I think his
[56:04] opinion was still right
[56:06] spiritually his conclusion that
[56:08] conclusion was just something he was
[56:10] just making a statement he's going to
[56:11] lead him to death because I think what
[56:12] we're seeing today and what we've seen
[56:14] through the ambushes and the police and
[56:15] the fighting and the right I think
[56:17] that's a result of that and brother B
[56:18] was picking up on him spiritually
[56:20] because he's a prophet but he wasn't
[56:22] making a prediction he wasn't
[56:23] prophesying he wasn't thus sayith the
[56:25] Lord he wasn't in the office of a
[56:27] prophet saying a million people are
[56:29] going to lose their lives that's not
[56:31] what he was saying he was a man who was
[56:33] picking up something and that man was
[56:35] drawing a conclusion but he didn't want
[56:37] you to take it as of the Lord even
[56:40] though I believe it had all the makings
[56:43] of a prophet who understand God in
[56:46] behind it if I can make that if that
[56:48] makes any sense to you at all so I could
[56:50] look at it and say he was right but he
[56:52] wasn't predicting or prophesying cuz no
[56:55] million people have gotten shot or lost
[56:58] their lives
[57:00] right and so people want to take
[57:02] statement like that and they go all
[57:03] kinds of places with it and they want to
[57:04] be extreme or they want to be whatever I
[57:06] I I believe he was honing in on
[57:08] something because the gift that was in
[57:09] his life and he was spot on to the
[57:11] spirit behind it but he wanted to come
[57:14] back himself and let the people know
[57:16] listen sometimes it's me and sometimes
[57:18] it's God you have to discern you have to
[57:20] know and when he said that all of a
[57:22] sudden I'm just sitting there thinking
[57:24] how in the world am I going to know when
[57:27] it's him and when it's
[57:32] God I mean all of a sudden I'm like
[57:35] that's not fair brother Brandon you
[57:37] can't say a thing like that that's not
[57:40] fair because what am I going to do I'm
[57:42] going to just take my opinion I disagree
[57:45] with that he's wrong he might be spoton
[57:47] right and it may not be his opinion it
[57:49] may be
[57:50] scripture and I don't say that to
[57:52] confuse you I hope it's not confusion
[57:54] because I don't have an answer I don't
[57:55] know how to easily do that all I know to
[57:58] do is keep coming back and say God you
[58:00] have to leave me this is your way I
[58:02] can't always sort it out I don't
[58:05] understand I don't know why that was
[58:06] said that way I don't know why that
[58:08] Minister said or that preacher said it
[58:09] in my heart I don't agree with him but
[58:11] hey this is your way you just get me
[58:13] through all the muddy stuff and get me
[58:15] around the opinion just give me your
[58:17] word and let your word take effect in my
[58:21] life brother B even says in a quote and
[58:24] I didn't pull the quote and I'm sorry
[58:25] but I I I just just just you can go find
[58:29] it if if if you don't believe me come
[58:30] and ask me later I'll find it for you
[58:33] but brother B make a statement to the
[58:34] effect that even if the preacher is
[58:36] misbelieving part of the word the word
[58:38] that he preaches will still have an
[58:40] effect because it's the word of God and
[58:43] if he says something that's true and you
[58:45] receive it as true it'll still work in
[58:47] your life even if that Pro brother is
[58:49] completely wrong in his Doctrine and has
[58:51] all kinds of wrong ideas and even is
[58:53] saying wrong things if he says the truth
[58:54] and you receive it of the truth the
[58:56] power of that word will still be true in
[58:58] your
[58:58] life that's
[59:02] rightow we too often say it's all in or
[59:04] all
[59:05] out but that's just we're human beings
[59:08] and that's just the way it is I think
[59:10] sometimes with us we get
[59:11] uncomfortable in this area of it could
[59:14] be wrong or maybe that's his opinion
[59:16] maybe that's spot on the word and I
[59:17] don't have intellect enough to say it
[59:19] there's no disclaimers before the
[59:21] message I'd have no idea and we're not
[59:23] comfortable with that amen we get
[59:25] uncomfortable because we like everything
[59:26] in a nice tidy category we like to have
[59:28] a label on it we like a binder with a
[59:30] sticker on the outside and know how to
[59:32] categorize it but the foolishness of
[59:35] preaching is what he chose to save them
[59:36] that
[59:37] believe so I don't know that it's ever
[59:39] going to be clean and tidy and perfect
[59:41] with with no no chance for error I don't
[59:43] think it's ever going to come that way
[59:45] because God's looking for one thing he's
[59:47] looking for Faith he's looking for those
[59:48] that can believe the word and respond to
[59:50] the word of God so when brother B said
[59:53] you have to know when it's this and you
[59:54] have to know when it's that I still do
[59:56] this day cannot tell you that I know
[59:57] when it's this and when it's that one
[59:59] thing I know is God used that man to
[1:00:01] preach the Gospel of Truth to me as a
[1:00:03] prophet I believe what he taught to be
[1:00:05] true what's this and what's that I don't
[1:00:07] know but the the truth that was preached
[1:00:09] has changed my
[1:00:11] life yeah and I'm not going to get in
[1:00:15] debates I just believe him
[1:00:18] amen and so
[1:00:22] now in Acts 169
[1:00:29] he
[1:00:33] says and the vision appeared to Paul in
[1:00:35] the night there stood a man in Macedonia
[1:00:38] and prayed him saying come over into
[1:00:40] Macedonia and help
[1:00:42] us this is where he was trying to preach
[1:00:44] in Asia but the spirit kept forbidding
[1:00:47] him everywhere he would go but in the
[1:00:49] night the vision came and a man from
[1:00:51] Macedonia said come over and help us and
[1:00:54] after he had seen the vision immediately
[1:00:55] he endeavored to go into Macedonia
[1:00:58] assuredly Gathering that the Lord had
[1:01:00] called us for to preach the gospel unto
[1:01:03] them so the man says here's the man in a
[1:01:07] vision says come to Macedonia and help
[1:01:10] us means they need help what was the
[1:01:13] answer to his
[1:01:15] question it was a man coming to preach
[1:01:17] the gospel yeah what was the help he
[1:01:20] needed he needed Paul to come preach the
[1:01:23] gospel because the help he needed was
[1:01:25] preach preaching he needed somebody to
[1:01:28] come and proclaim the good news for his
[1:01:30] day that's what that man needed and Paul
[1:01:33] was the vessel God was going to choose
[1:01:35] to do it but that man in the vision say
[1:01:37] come and help us he didn't say Amen
[1:01:39] would you send us your your best book
[1:01:41] would you send us amen uh uh some
[1:01:43] someplace that we can go to school no
[1:01:45] the solution that he needed was a man
[1:01:47] who had the gospel to come and preach
[1:01:49] the
[1:01:51] gospel let's go to Acts chapter 20 now
[1:01:56] I like this scripture you'll see why
[1:01:58] here in a
[1:01:59] minute Acts 20 and
[1:02:03] 7 and upon the first day acts
[1:02:07] 20:7 and upon the first day of the week
[1:02:10] when the disciples came together to
[1:02:11] break bread Paul preached unto them
[1:02:13] ready to depart on the tomorrow and
[1:02:15] continued his speech until midnight and
[1:02:17] there were many lights in the upper
[1:02:18] chamber where they were gathered
[1:02:20] together and there sat in a window a
[1:02:22] certain young man named udcus being
[1:02:24] fallen into deep sleep and as Paul was
[1:02:27] long preaching he sunk down with sleep
[1:02:29] and fell down from the third Loft and
[1:02:31] was taken up dead so we know that that
[1:02:34] Paul then goes and lays his body upon
[1:02:35] him he comes back to life the reason I
[1:02:37] said this uh I I did not use this
[1:02:40] scripture to justify long
[1:02:42] preaching so
[1:02:44] relax I did not do
[1:02:47] that but Paul was getting ready to part
[1:02:50] from them and he was going to be
[1:02:52] gone maybe some length of time maybe
[1:02:55] never come back
[1:02:56] and the very best thing Paul could do
[1:02:59] for them as parting was to preach and
[1:03:02] keep preaching with all the time he had
[1:03:05] because the preaching of the Gospel was
[1:03:07] what was going to keep
[1:03:09] them amen so this isn't a justification
[1:03:13] to preach all night till everybody falls
[1:03:16] asleep it's Paul's attitude towards
[1:03:18] preaching amen Paul told the one group
[1:03:21] he says I hope to come to you and add to
[1:03:23] the part that's lacking in your faith
[1:03:25] well was he going to add to the part
[1:03:26] that was Laing Faith he was going to
[1:03:27] come preach to them the gospel the
[1:03:30] revelation of Jesus Christ Paul put
[1:03:33] value in the preaching of the Gospel the
[1:03:35] man from Macedonia the help they needed
[1:03:37] was the preaching of the Gospel the best
[1:03:38] thing he could do for these disciples
[1:03:40] that he was going to part with was to
[1:03:41] preach to them all the time he had until
[1:03:44] the morning and leave because the
[1:03:46] preaching is what they
[1:03:54] needed he am men let's go to Romans
[1:03:57] chapter
[1:04:07] 1 Romans chap
[1:04:14] 1:14 Romans 1:14 Paul says I am a deor
[1:04:17] both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians
[1:04:19] both to the wise and to the unwise so as
[1:04:22] much as it in me is I am ready to preach
[1:04:25] the gospel to to you that are at Rome
[1:04:26] also for I'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:04:28] of Christ for it is the power of God un
[1:04:31] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:04:33] the Jew first and also to the Greek for
[1:04:37] therein is the righteousness of God
[1:04:39] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[1:04:41] written the just shall live by faith so
[1:04:45] this preaching of the Gospel is the
[1:04:47] power of God unto salvation and Paul was
[1:04:50] ready to come and preach to them the
[1:04:51] gospel because he knew the power that
[1:04:54] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:04:58] conveyed amen let's go now to Romans
[1:05:01] chapter
[1:05:14] 10 Romans chapter
[1:05:17] 10 verse
[1:05:20] 13 says for whosoever shall call upon
[1:05:23] the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:05:26] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:05:28] they have not believed how shall they
[1:05:30] believe in him of whom they have not
[1:05:31] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:05:34] preacher and how shall they preach
[1:05:36] except they be sent as it is written how
[1:05:38] beautiful are the feet of them that
[1:05:40] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[1:05:41] Glad Tidings of good things this is such
[1:05:45] a a simple pattern but how are they
[1:05:47] going to call on the name of the Lord if
[1:05:49] they don't believe how are they going to
[1:05:51] believe if they haven't heard how are
[1:05:52] they going to hear if they Don't Preach
[1:05:54] everything in the scriptures is telling
[1:05:55] telling us that God is going to use the
[1:05:57] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:05:58] that
[1:05:59] believe and that's still true
[1:06:01] today amen when Paul when the Apostle
[1:06:06] Paul was going around and preaching amen
[1:06:10] Paul was not uh Paul was not building a
[1:06:14] denomination Paul was not making a
[1:06:17] movement he wasn't becoming the head of
[1:06:18] the movement what Paul was doing was
[1:06:20] imparting
[1:06:22] life what Paul was doing was bringing
[1:06:25] the word that would actually change a
[1:06:27] life amen and he was bringing the the
[1:06:29] word that would change people's lives
[1:06:31] and bring them into the image of Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ because there was a power in the
[1:06:36] preaching of the word and the power of
[1:06:38] the preaching of the word was a change
[1:06:40] in a person's life when they receive the
[1:06:43] word and so Paul also was bringing a
[1:06:47] dispensational change and in that
[1:06:49] dispensational change God Called Paul to
[1:06:51] be a light unto the Gentiles so Paul now
[1:06:54] was bearing the light of the age and God
[1:06:56] used him and sent him out also with
[1:06:58] faithful ministers with him Amen to go
[1:07:01] and bring this light to the Gentiles
[1:07:03] amen because they weren't going to get
[1:07:05] it listen they weren't going to get it
[1:07:07] by osmosis they weren't going to get it
[1:07:09] just because they had a seed on the
[1:07:11] inside of them wasn't going to
[1:07:13] spontaneously erupt one day and all of a
[1:07:15] sudden they had the Revelation but God
[1:07:17] had a method and it was the same method
[1:07:19] that he had back in the Book of Genesis
[1:07:21] there were Gentiles out there with seeds
[1:07:23] laid inside of them and God had the same
[1:07:26] method he had for the recreation of the
[1:07:27] world is the same method he had to reach
[1:07:29] those seeds in the
[1:07:31] Gentiles and what he would do is send
[1:07:34] man send a men send men who would come
[1:07:37] and proclaim the word over that darkness
[1:07:40] and void of their humanity and part the
[1:07:42] waters and let the light shine and the
[1:07:44] seed that was already in would spring to
[1:07:46] life and this gospel would have a power
[1:07:48] of a changed
[1:07:50] life but God was going to use man to go
[1:07:53] and deliver his word and be his spoken
[1:07:55] and his partner upon the
[1:07:57] Earth to do what he did in the beginning
[1:08:00] they were going to continue to
[1:08:03] do and so it takes the preaching of the
[1:08:09] word it takes the preaching of the word
[1:08:12] in season to bring about the conditions
[1:08:15] that are right for that that seed to
[1:08:18] Spring forth to life and the season has
[1:08:21] to remain right for the seed to grow
[1:08:25] into full
[1:08:27] maturity to manifest what it
[1:08:31] is brother B
[1:08:35] said you see you say now you say well if
[1:08:38] he knows it then why are you preaching
[1:08:40] brother B said he knows everybody's ever
[1:08:41] going to be saved he knew before the
[1:08:44] foundation of the world he knows he said
[1:08:46] he talks about he knows every Gat and
[1:08:48] how much Tallow it will generate in its
[1:08:50] lifetime then the question is then then
[1:08:53] then why are you preaching brother bam
[1:08:56] he said that's part of God's program
[1:08:58] preaching is his
[1:09:00] program so we can't change
[1:09:02] it let's go to Second
[1:09:05] Peter together
[1:09:29] second Peter 2
[1:09:32] and5 in 2 Peter 2:5 he says and he
[1:09:36] spared not the old world but saved Noah
[1:09:38] the eighth person a preacher of
[1:09:41] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[1:09:43] the world of the
[1:09:45] ungodly God has always had a preacher
[1:09:47] and now Noah was a preacher of
[1:09:50] righteousness and what was Noah's
[1:09:53] message I don't mean to be overly
[1:09:55] simplistic but Noah his message was the
[1:09:57] Earth is going to be destroyed and God's
[1:09:59] provided a way
[1:10:00] out that was the heart of his message
[1:10:03] the Earth is going to be destroyed and
[1:10:05] he could have preached it many different
[1:10:06] ways and used many types and many
[1:10:08] different titles to a sermon but I'm
[1:10:10] sure the sermon always had the same
[1:10:12] elements in it God is going to destroy
[1:10:14] the Earth and there's a way of
[1:10:16] Escape amen but you see that Noah's
[1:10:21] preaching wasn't just intellectualism
[1:10:24] and it wasn't just
[1:10:25] debate neither was it sophisticated
[1:10:29] speech but Noah's preaching was a
[1:10:31] reality and it had a life yeah and what
[1:10:35] was the life of Noah's preaching the
[1:10:37] life of Noah's preaching was
[1:10:38] demonstrated by Noah's life Noah
[1:10:40] actually had to believe what he preached
[1:10:43] and what he preached was manifesting
[1:10:45] every day as he was working on this
[1:10:48] Ark and and that's the way it has to be
[1:10:51] with the preaching of the Gospel amen
[1:10:53] the one who's preaching the gospel amen
[1:10:55] should be the one who's affected most by
[1:10:57] the
[1:10:59] gospel what would it be like for Noah to
[1:11:01] come to the pull pit and Noah start
[1:11:03] preaching there's a there's there's
[1:11:05] destruction coming on the earth it's
[1:11:07] imminent the hand of God he's an angry
[1:11:09] is a wrathful vengeful God he's going to
[1:11:12] destroy it but and in order to be saved
[1:11:14] you have to build an ark but no himself
[1:11:16] is never building an ark he has no sense
[1:11:18] of urgency he has no desire he has no
[1:11:21] discipline he he's he's not doing
[1:11:23] anything about it listen I would I would
[1:11:26] uh I would go to say that his gospel is
[1:11:28] not working in his own life but Noah was
[1:11:31] preaching out of conviction Noah was
[1:11:33] preaching from convin he was convinced
[1:11:35] amen he was convinced and he was
[1:11:37] concerned and he was doing something
[1:11:39] about it amen and every day and his life
[1:11:42] the gospel that he preached was manifest
[1:11:44] in his own life and that's the way it
[1:11:45] has to be for everybody who carries this
[1:11:47] word this gospel should change our lives
[1:11:50] first and we should be preaching out of
[1:11:51] a conviction amen that it's true not an
[1:11:56] intellectual debate not a not a nice
[1:11:58] philosophical discussion not a better
[1:12:01] way to live but this has to be a life
[1:12:03] that has come to me and A Life That's
[1:12:05] flowing through me and a life that has
[1:12:06] changed my life amen have I come to
[1:12:08] Perfection yet absolutely not are there
[1:12:10] things I want changed absolutely but I'm
[1:12:12] so convinced that this gospel that I
[1:12:14] preach has the power of transformation
[1:12:17] embedded in it because it has
[1:12:18] transformed my life from what I was to
[1:12:20] what I am now that all I want to do is
[1:12:22] for you to get the same life that
[1:12:24] changed me I want to come to you and I
[1:12:26] know nothing else to do but take the
[1:12:28] same word that changed my life and
[1:12:29] preach it with all of my heart to change
[1:12:31] your
[1:12:32] life that's what Noah was doing he was a
[1:12:35] preacher of righteousness he wasn't out
[1:12:37] there just condemning the masses he was
[1:12:39] telling them you're wrong but there's a
[1:12:41] way of Escape there's life amen There's
[1:12:43] an opportunity for
[1:12:48] life and he was working on the
[1:12:52] boat he was preparing a way he was
[1:12:55] calling them to
[1:12:57] something he believed what he
[1:12:59] preached and it was evident that he
[1:13:02] believed what he
[1:13:03] preached listen
[1:13:05] Noah wasn't
[1:13:08] preaching a previous
[1:13:13] message he wasn't preaching a future
[1:13:17] messag Noah was preaching what was
[1:13:19] pertinent to the
[1:13:21] day a way of escape a way of life a
[1:13:25] chance at life for his
[1:13:27] day he wasn't getting up talking about
[1:13:31] you know remember back the story of the
[1:13:33] Garden of Eden and this if he talked
[1:13:35] anything about the Garden of Eden it was
[1:13:37] to bring it to his day to give him a
[1:13:38] sense of urgency and a need to get on
[1:13:40] this boat yeah amen cuz his whole gospel
[1:13:44] amen was salvation for his
[1:13:49] day but you know when the Apostle Paul
[1:13:52] come along the Apostle Paul wasn't
[1:13:54] preaching about building a
[1:13:57] boat but he had just as much urgency
[1:14:00] just as much fire just as much life cuz
[1:14:02] he had come in contact something changed
[1:14:04] his life and he was working every day
[1:14:07] amen just like Noah was it was his life
[1:14:09] his life's work his life's passion every
[1:14:11] day and Paul the Apostle was preaching
[1:14:13] what he had received he was living
[1:14:16] before them in the demonstration and
[1:14:18] power of the Gospel that there was a
[1:14:20] life
[1:14:22] changed but he wasn't preaching
[1:14:25] buil a boat he was preaching the way of
[1:14:28] Escape for his
[1:14:30] day see God has always had a preacher
[1:14:33] and he's always needed a preacher
[1:14:35] because God put himself in partnership
[1:14:36] with man and that preacher has always
[1:14:39] been somebody who was convinced and
[1:14:43] concerned convinced because the gospel
[1:14:46] changed their lives concerned that it
[1:14:49] would change other people's
[1:14:51] lives God uses a man
[1:14:57] let's go together to 1 Corinthians
[1:15:00] chapter
[1:15:15] 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[1:15:21] 1 says and I Brethren when I came to you
[1:15:24] came not with Excellency of speech or of
[1:15:26] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:15:28] of God for I determine not to know
[1:15:30] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:15:32] him crucified and I was with you in
[1:15:35] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:15:38] trembling my speech and my preaching was
[1:15:40] not with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:15:42] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:15:45] of power that your faith should not
[1:15:47] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:15:50] power of God how be it we speak wisdom
[1:15:55] among them that are perfect yet not the
[1:15:57] wisdom of this world nor the princes of
[1:15:59] this world that come to not but we speak
[1:16:01] the wisdom of God and a mystery even the
[1:16:04] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:16:07] the world into our Glory which none of
[1:16:09] the princes of this world knew for had
[1:16:10] they known it they would not have
[1:16:12] crucified the Lord Of Glory so Paul did
[1:16:15] not come to preach to them enticing
[1:16:18] words of man's Wisdom but he came to
[1:16:21] preach to them in the spirit and the
[1:16:23] demonstration of the power of the spirit
[1:16:25] and brother Brandon picks this up in
[1:16:26] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:16:28] and he makes this statement when
[1:16:29] referring to the
[1:16:31] scripture so there you see there's the
[1:16:33] gospel go you in all the world and
[1:16:35] preach the gospel didn't say go teach he
[1:16:37] said go preach in other words
[1:16:38] demonstrate the power and these signs
[1:16:40] shall follow them just teaching doesn't
[1:16:42] do it it takes the actual Spirit itself
[1:16:44] demonstrating these signs to listen to
[1:16:47] this that your faith should not stand in
[1:16:49] the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:16:52] God you see to change the man so brother
[1:16:56] almost he he he he starts to talk about
[1:16:59] this demonstration of the power and we
[1:17:01] know the demonstration of the power is
[1:17:02] the same powers in Jesus Christ doing
[1:17:04] the same works that Jesus did it can
[1:17:05] heal the sick it can do all manner of
[1:17:07] Miracles and all kinds of things but
[1:17:09] what he's what he's honing down on is
[1:17:12] see it's got a power in it to change the
[1:17:17] man
[1:17:19] amen he's got the power to actually
[1:17:22] bring a change it changed Paul and now
[1:17:25] when he preaches it it changed the
[1:17:28] macedonians it changes the Romans it
[1:17:30] changes the Corinthians and it turns
[1:17:33] them into the replication of what he
[1:17:39] preached amen so that the same life was
[1:17:42] in Paul moves into them who
[1:17:47] believe amen so there's a demonstration
[1:17:51] of the power you Noah had a
[1:17:53] demonstration of the power
[1:17:55] the demonstration of the power in Noah's
[1:17:58] life amen the power of the Gospel that
[1:17:59] Noah received that demonstration was it
[1:18:02] changed him from a farmer to a boat
[1:18:05] builder and he gave all of his life to
[1:18:08] building this
[1:18:09] boat it changed him completely to the
[1:18:13] message he received became the life that
[1:18:16] he
[1:18:17] lived the message he preached was the
[1:18:20] life that he lived so Moses had received
[1:18:24] the word of God amen God's word comes to
[1:18:27] accomplish certain things and when the
[1:18:29] word of the Lord came to Noah it
[1:18:31] accomplished something in Noah it
[1:18:33] changed him from a farmer it changed him
[1:18:35] from an ordinary man going about his
[1:18:37] farming business doing whatever it
[1:18:39] changed him into a preacher of
[1:18:41] righteousness it changed him into a
[1:18:42] Herald of Truth it changed him from a
[1:18:44] farmer to a boat builder because this is
[1:18:46] the season to build a
[1:18:49] boat and the power of change was in the
[1:18:52] word that he received yeah and guess
[1:18:55] what his sons became boat Builders guess
[1:18:57] what everybody who come to his church
[1:18:59] was a boat builder don't think that Noah
[1:19:01] built this all by himself amen have you
[1:19:03] ever seen the scale of the project and
[1:19:05] the timeline he had he didn't work on
[1:19:07] this by himself everybody who came to
[1:19:09] know his church was interested in
[1:19:11] building a
[1:19:13] boat we know that they would finally
[1:19:15] disbelieve and All Fall Away except for
[1:19:17] his family but but that's beside the
[1:19:19] point the the message that he was
[1:19:21] preaching was transforming them into the
[1:19:24] word that was was preached and then they
[1:19:25] all were out what were they doing they
[1:19:28] were all out cutting trees Trucking them
[1:19:30] in shaping them down pitching them
[1:19:33] nailing them fabricating Fasteners and
[1:19:35] and doing iron work and Brass work there
[1:19:37] was a whole bunch of things that were
[1:19:39] happening but everything that was
[1:19:40] happening was a manifestation of what
[1:19:43] was
[1:19:45] preached and wherever Paul went amen as
[1:19:48] the first church age messenger preaching
[1:19:50] the message of Christ amen the message
[1:19:52] of redemption Amen to the G genes now
[1:19:55] everywhere he went those churches
[1:19:57] started reflecting the word that was
[1:19:59] preached amen because it was coming with
[1:20:01] the demonstration and power the power to
[1:20:03] change them into the very image of
[1:20:07] Christ
[1:20:09] Amen brother M goes on just a little bit
[1:20:12] further a couple uh paragraphs further
[1:20:14] in Christ is the mystery said and Paul
[1:20:16] this great intellectual man never tried
[1:20:18] to expresses great theological terms
[1:20:20] upon the people he humbly accepted the
[1:20:22] word of the Lord and he lived the word
[1:20:24] so that it expressed through him he
[1:20:27] lived so Godly until they seen Jesus
[1:20:30] Christ in him so much till they wanted
[1:20:32] his handkerchief to take it and lay it
[1:20:34] upon the sick there is the Life of
[1:20:36] Christ amen Paul didn't preach he he
[1:20:42] didn't I just say it this way he didn't
[1:20:44] just teach now when brother R says this
[1:20:46] he says teach and preach and preach is
[1:20:48] the demonstration of the Gospel brother
[1:20:49] B is not saying that you shouldn't have
[1:20:51] a teacher a teacher is part of the
[1:20:53] five-fold ministry supposed to teach
[1:20:55] brother B himself said he taught yeah
[1:20:58] that's not what he's saying he's he's
[1:21:00] contradicting a denominational idea that
[1:21:02] all you have to do is show up with a
[1:21:04] program and instruction sheets and
[1:21:06] workbooks and teach people what the
[1:21:08] gospel is and they'll become Christians
[1:21:10] right that's the whole notion that he's
[1:21:12] fighting against that why because you're
[1:21:15] just bringing something that a man had
[1:21:17] formed and something from a previous day
[1:21:19] and you collected a bunch of writings
[1:21:20] and a bunch of ideas and something that
[1:21:22] worked in another day and you come along
[1:21:24] and you say in this year Noah built an
[1:21:26] AR and in this year they had the exod in
[1:21:28] this year this happened and you put it
[1:21:30] together in a teaching format like like
[1:21:33] the denominations replicate over and
[1:21:34] over and over again and you structure it
[1:21:36] and you set it up and we teach you how
[1:21:38] to be a Christian you can't teach
[1:21:39] somebody how to be a Christian you
[1:21:41] preach the word and the word comes and
[1:21:43] finds that seed and the word strips away
[1:21:45] everything around them and brings a
[1:21:47] light to the seed and brings life out of
[1:21:49] that
[1:21:53] seed but Paul didn't just come with a
[1:21:57] collection uh uh of documents he didn't
[1:22:00] come with textbooks he didn't come with
[1:22:02] a form formulated out of the Jew Roman
[1:22:05] or the the the church in Jerusalem to
[1:22:07] come and say now let's establish a
[1:22:09] church here and let's establish a church
[1:22:11] here and we'll establish a church here
[1:22:12] and we'll teach you all the doctrine of
[1:22:14] the church and we'll teach you how to
[1:22:16] take up your offering and we'll teach
[1:22:17] you
[1:22:19] right no he came and demonstrated there
[1:22:22] was a life in what he preached there was
[1:22:24] a life in him there was a life to back
[1:22:26] it up and when they brought the sick the
[1:22:27] life that he was preaching would raise
[1:22:29] the sick raise the dead it would move
[1:22:31] all kinds of obstacles out of the way it
[1:22:33] wasn't just teaching a set of a set of
[1:22:36] things to learn amen he was preaching
[1:22:38] the gospel and in preaching the gospel
[1:22:40] he would sit down and teach sometimes
[1:22:42] but it wasn't that kind of teaching it
[1:22:44] was the preaching of the Gospel amen and
[1:22:47] the power and
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:50] demonstration he said in in Romans 12
[1:22:54] let's go to Romans chap
[1:22:56] 12 and when when I want to I I just want
[1:23:00] to refer back to this quote I just read
[1:23:02] he said what was said at the end was he
[1:23:05] humbly accepted the word of the Lord and
[1:23:07] he lived the word so that it expressed
[1:23:08] through him he lived so Godly until they
[1:23:11] seen Jesus Christ in him so much till
[1:23:14] they wanted his handkerchief to take it
[1:23:16] and lay it upon the sick there is the
[1:23:18] Life of
[1:23:20] Christ listen the there was such a
[1:23:23] demonstration in the of the Apostle Paul
[1:23:26] that they it wasn't Paul who said if you
[1:23:29] take a handkerchief from me you'll be
[1:23:32] healed it was the people recognized
[1:23:34] there was a life in that man and they
[1:23:36] wanted handkerchiefs and aprons and
[1:23:39] pieces of garment why because they saw a
[1:23:42] living representation of the Gospel it
[1:23:44] was alive it was powerful and it was
[1:23:47] working amen
[1:23:51] amen Romans 12 verse
[1:23:55] one says I beseech you therefore
[1:23:58] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:23:59] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:24:01] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:24:04] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:24:07] to this world but be you transformed by
[1:24:09] the renewing of your mind that you may
[1:24:11] prove that is what is that good and
[1:24:13] acceptable and perfect will of God so he
[1:24:17] makes this statement that Paul's saying
[1:24:20] don't be conformed to the world but be
[1:24:23] transformed by the renew of your
[1:24:25] mind so our minds need to be renewed and
[1:24:28] that's part of what the preaching of the
[1:24:29] Gospel is doing it's washing Us in the
[1:24:31] washing of the water of the word and
[1:24:33] it's washing away those wrong things
[1:24:35] that are in our mind so that our mind
[1:24:37] can be renewed that means to be
[1:24:40] renovated that what's the preaching of
[1:24:42] the Gospel going to do it's going to
[1:24:44] tear down your thinking to the
[1:24:46] studs and rip out everything that got
[1:24:49] bit and placed in there wrong everything
[1:24:51] from the previous understanding it's
[1:24:53] going to rip it down to the Foundation
[1:24:55] amen it's going to do a complete
[1:24:56] renovation of your thinking amen and
[1:24:58] that's not going to happen the first
[1:25:00] sermon you hear but it's going to happen
[1:25:01] sermon after sermon after sermon because
[1:25:04] it's renewing you're being transformed
[1:25:06] by the renewing of your
[1:25:09] mind in the power of transformation he
[1:25:12] goes on to say that's what we all want
[1:25:14] to do is be not conformed to this world
[1:25:17] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:25:19] our mind to do the perfect and
[1:25:20] acceptable will of God now that we have
[1:25:23] been saved as we are and that we have
[1:25:25] been filled with the Holy Ghost as we
[1:25:26] have now we want the mind that was in
[1:25:29] Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:25:31] transformed from the Natural Things of
[1:25:33] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:25:35] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:25:38] spirit by his
[1:25:40] word so what is all this preaching doing
[1:25:43] it's transforming us it's changing the
[1:25:45] way we think it's changing the way we
[1:25:47] respond it's the renewing of our
[1:25:51] mind how this is what he says
[1:25:55] he says we want the mind that was in
[1:25:58] Christ to be in us that we might be
[1:26:02] transformed from the Natural Things of
[1:26:03] life and be brought into the perfect
[1:26:06] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:26:08] spirit by his word that's what God's
[1:26:11] doing to us he's changing us Ephesians
[1:26:15] chapter 4
[1:26:33] Ephesians
[1:26:34] 4:17 says this I say therefore and
[1:26:38] testify in the Lord that you henceforth
[1:26:39] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:26:41] vanity of their mind this is why we have
[1:26:43] to have the transformation of our
[1:26:46] mind we have to be transformed by the
[1:26:48] renewing of her mind having the
[1:26:51] understanding darkened being alienated
[1:26:52] from the life of God through the
[1:26:53] ignorance that is is in them because of
[1:26:55] the blindness of their heart what is it
[1:26:58] they're in the condition the Earth was
[1:26:59] in in Genesis
[1:27:02] 1:2 Darkness alienated
[1:27:05] blindness but the preaching of the
[1:27:07] Gospel will be the renewing of their
[1:27:09] mind it'll change their mind and
[1:27:11] atmosphere and allow the seed to Spring
[1:27:13] forth and
[1:27:17] grow brother B says again in power of
[1:27:22] transformation he says and all this
[1:27:24] great thing that he knowed would come to
[1:27:26] pass he spoke it he could take his he he
[1:27:29] could take a rest everything under
[1:27:32] control his seed was his word and his
[1:27:34] word is a seed Jesus said it was and
[1:27:36] everything would be all right because he
[1:27:38] said for it to bring forth of its kind
[1:27:40] transforming only its kind see his word
[1:27:43] had to be of its kind if he said a palm
[1:27:45] tree it didn't mean a palm and an oak
[1:27:47] mixed together he meant a palm tree here
[1:27:49] and an oak tree here everything
[1:27:51] positionally in its place
[1:27:54] he when God would speak his word he
[1:27:56] knows that that word would go and
[1:27:58] accomplish what he sent it to do and
[1:28:00] then he could take his rest because
[1:28:02] everything was going to bring forth
[1:28:03] after its own
[1:28:05] kind in Isaiah 5511 he says so shall my
[1:28:08] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:28:11] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:28:14] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:28:16] it shall prosper in the thing wherein I
[1:28:18] sent
[1:28:19] it that you know what that means to me
[1:28:23] that means this m message that God sent
[1:28:24] in this day will accomplish exactly what
[1:28:27] God sent it to
[1:28:28] do what God has spoken through the mouth
[1:28:31] of a prophet will absolutely come to
[1:28:33] pass that he will have a bride without
[1:28:35] spot or wrinkle she's going to come into
[1:28:37] a marriage Union with Jesus Christ she
[1:28:39] is going to become the very reflected
[1:28:41] image of Jesus Christ in a many membered
[1:28:43] body and she is going to have a change
[1:28:45] in her atoms and she is going to get a
[1:28:47] glorified body and she's going to leave
[1:28:48] this earth under that condition and I
[1:28:50] believe it with all of my heart why
[1:28:52] because he spoke it and he's got
[1:28:54] confidence in the word that he spoke and
[1:28:56] it will not return into him void but it
[1:28:58] will accomplish what he said when it was
[1:29:00] time for it to come into manifestation
[1:29:01] he sent a prophet along in our day so
[1:29:04] that that Prophet could preach the
[1:29:05] gospel so that we could be saved who
[1:29:07] believe saved how made whole restored
[1:29:10] healed brought back to full
[1:29:15] health and it doesn't matter if it was
[1:29:17] preached 60 years ago it doesn't matter
[1:29:18] if it becomes 80 years ago it doesn't
[1:29:20] matter if it becomes a 100 years ago
[1:29:22] that it was preached it was preached
[1:29:24] amen it's being proclaimed it's taking
[1:29:26] effect it will not return into him void
[1:29:29] but it will accomplish what he said it
[1:29:31] will
[1:29:32] accomplish that's why our confidence is
[1:29:35] what God's
[1:29:36] done not what we're
[1:29:39] doing what God's
[1:29:41] done this is something that I have to
[1:29:44] constantly remind myself because you
[1:29:46] know we as human beings we get
[1:29:48] passionate about things and I'm I'm
[1:29:51] truly passionate about this message but
[1:29:53] my personal passion in the message can
[1:29:55] move me amen Beyond uh certain barriers
[1:29:59] into trying to press and trying to push
[1:30:01] or trying to conjure something up or
[1:30:03] make something happen or push something
[1:30:05] before it's time or persuade or push
[1:30:07] people into a certain
[1:30:10] Conformity amen am and and and that's
[1:30:14] one of the errors that we can make as
[1:30:16] people it's one of the errors we can
[1:30:17] make make as ministers as that we're
[1:30:19] trying Amen to use our passion amen and
[1:30:22] our Force to produce something in the
[1:30:25] kingdom of God but God has his own
[1:30:27] method for producing something he sent
[1:30:29] his word amen that's his method and if
[1:30:31] I've Got Confidence in the word he sent
[1:30:33] that word's not going to return into him
[1:30:34] void he doesn't need me to apply extra
[1:30:37] pressure all I need to do is preach the
[1:30:39] word and let the word take effect cu the
[1:30:41] word will take effect
[1:30:43] amen amen and and I don't say that to
[1:30:47] condemn any preaching style because we
[1:30:48] absolutely understand God calls
[1:30:50] different men for different things and
[1:30:51] every once in a while we need somebody
[1:30:53] amen who has the ability to call call us
[1:30:56] on the carpet and call us to question
[1:30:58] amen but that's not what I'm saying what
[1:30:59] I'm saying is I don't need to do
[1:31:02] something to make the word take effect
[1:31:04] in your life all that I've got to do is
[1:31:06] proclaim the truth that he's proclaimed
[1:31:07] to me and if it's the true word of God
[1:31:09] it'll have the life of the word inside
[1:31:11] of it and it'll bring life out of you if
[1:31:13] you've got a seed of God I don't need to
[1:31:16] use my personality I don't need to use a
[1:31:19] church discipline I don't need to use
[1:31:21] peer pressure we don't need to use guilt
[1:31:23] trips we don't need to use anything to
[1:31:25] get the word to produce all we need to
[1:31:27] do is preach the word keep it as true as
[1:31:30] we know how to keep it keep ourselves
[1:31:32] out of the way as much as we know how to
[1:31:34] keep ourselves out of the way and if we
[1:31:35] can do that that word's going to produce
[1:31:38] the results and it doesn't matter if you
[1:31:39] say it in a whisper you say it at the
[1:31:41] top of your voice it's not the
[1:31:43] inflection of your voice or the volume
[1:31:45] that you say it with it's not how
[1:31:46] dynamic or how boring it's the power of
[1:31:49] the spoken word it's the foolishness of
[1:31:51] preaching it's God's Method All you got
[1:31:54] to do is have confidence in God's method
[1:31:56] and let the word do the
[1:31:58] work oh I'm more convinced than ever and
[1:32:01] I Don't Preach that to you I preach that
[1:32:03] to me because sometimes I feel
[1:32:04] constrained I see things that aren't
[1:32:06] lined up and I got we got to fix this we
[1:32:08] got to fix that and I stay awake at
[1:32:10] night sometimes wondering what should we
[1:32:12] do about this situation or that
[1:32:13] situation and I've come to terms with
[1:32:15] myself that there's nothing that I have
[1:32:18] the power to do it's the power is in the
[1:32:20] word am
[1:32:24] we got to preach the
[1:32:29] word preach the word in
[1:32:33] season preach the gospel for
[1:32:36] today and produce the life for
[1:32:40] today when God was going to bring his
[1:32:42] children out of the Dark
[1:32:44] Ages he just didn't expect them to come
[1:32:47] out of the Dark Ages yeah right he sent
[1:32:50] a man who caught the revelation of God
[1:32:52] for his generation and he preached the
[1:32:55] word then other men got inspired by what
[1:32:58] Luther preached and they took that same
[1:33:00] gospel he preached and they began to
[1:33:02] propagate it all over the world and that
[1:33:04] Revelation that was given to that
[1:33:06] messeng that he began to preach and the
[1:33:08] other men began to preach changed the
[1:33:10] face of the world yes am it changed the
[1:33:14] hold of Catholicism it changed the grip
[1:33:17] it had on Europe it changed Nations it
[1:33:19] changed boundaries it changed policy it
[1:33:22] changed kingdoms it changed the entire
[1:33:25] world what changed the world the
[1:33:26] preaching of the Gospel when he caught
[1:33:28] the Revelation from the word that the
[1:33:30] just are shaved by faith not of Works
[1:33:32] lest any man should boast as soon as he
[1:33:34] caught that Revelation and began to
[1:33:36] propagate that Revelation there was a
[1:33:37] life in it because it was the word for
[1:33:39] the season and there were seeds that
[1:33:41] were laying there predestinated to get a
[1:33:43] hold of that word amen and when that
[1:33:45] word came to that seed that was
[1:33:47] predestinated for Luther's generation
[1:33:49] the two came together and sprang to life
[1:33:51] and it changed the whole world Amen yeah
[1:33:55] do we think the power of this message is
[1:33:56] one IOD to different than the power that
[1:33:58] was in that
[1:34:00] Revelation when Luther come on the scene
[1:34:02] when it was time for God to grow his
[1:34:04] bride now she understood what he had
[1:34:06] done for her under justification now was
[1:34:08] time for her to get cleaned up and
[1:34:10] prepared amen for a union with Christ
[1:34:12] and he was going to bring her to
[1:34:13] sanctification he didn't just rely on
[1:34:15] the people to figure it out on their own
[1:34:18] although it was in the Bible they were
[1:34:19] blind to it although it was scripture
[1:34:22] they couldn't see it amen but God would
[1:34:24] raise up a John Wesley and he would
[1:34:26] anoint him to catch the vision of God
[1:34:29] for the day and he would preach the
[1:34:30] gospel and under the preaching of the
[1:34:32] Gospel it would Inspire other men to
[1:34:34] preach the gospel and what did it do in
[1:34:36] his day it changed the whole world Amen
[1:34:40] changed religious systems changed
[1:34:41] structures changed
[1:34:45] everything caused Wars caused travel
[1:34:49] caused all kinds of stuff
[1:34:54] this
[1:34:55] message is the word of
[1:34:58] God and it has to be preached and preach
[1:35:01] doesn't mean standing in a pull pit and
[1:35:05] sweating preach means to
[1:35:08] Proclaim this message has to be
[1:35:11] proclaimed has to be declared has to be
[1:35:14] lived has to be spoken has to be shared
[1:35:18] amen and it has the power to change the
[1:35:21] whole world Amen
[1:35:24] this message has the power to change the
[1:35:26] face of the
[1:35:28] world I V to say this message is
[1:35:31] changing the
[1:35:33] world changing economies changing
[1:35:36] politics changing weather patterns amen
[1:35:41] what's doing it this
[1:35:43] gospel it's changing the whole
[1:35:46] environment everything is changing to
[1:35:49] match the word in its season
[1:35:55] again in the power of transformation he
[1:35:57] says when God has spoken he know his
[1:36:00] word was sealed in it it could it would
[1:36:02] bring forth of its kind now it was
[1:36:04] commanded to bring forth only of its
[1:36:06] kind and it will always do that if a man
[1:36:08] don't tamper with
[1:36:10] it we know in Genesis it was tampered
[1:36:13] with it was tampered with it brought
[1:36:16] death is that
[1:36:18] right but even though it was tampered
[1:36:20] with and brought death that tampering
[1:36:22] and that death is only temporal because
[1:36:24] the word is eternal you can't tamper
[1:36:26] with it
[1:36:28] forever and just because you tampered
[1:36:30] with it or changed or modified it or
[1:36:32] whatever you did Amen to change it and
[1:36:35] it brought death doesn't change the
[1:36:37] truth behind the word that word will
[1:36:39] still live on
[1:36:42] Amen the word of God what God brought
[1:36:46] through his Apostles it was tampered
[1:36:49] with it was
[1:36:51] modified it was harnessed by men for
[1:36:54] different purposes but it never changed
[1:36:56] the truth that was laying there you
[1:36:58] can't change the truth that was laying
[1:36:59] there that's God's
[1:37:01] word so they tampered with it and they
[1:37:03] brought death and they brought cycles of
[1:37:05] death through denominationalism but in
[1:37:07] the end time amen when God was going to
[1:37:09] come on the scene amen what he did was
[1:37:11] he just took the tampering away and
[1:37:14] brought back the restoration to the true
[1:37:15] word because that word has life in it
[1:37:18] amen just like when it was buried under
[1:37:20] the waters of the Earth in Genesis 1:2
[1:37:23] it still had life inside of it all he
[1:37:25] had to do was move the tampering away
[1:37:27] from it and the life would spring forth
[1:37:29] and the same thing with the word of God
[1:37:30] it's got the life brother Brenham said
[1:37:32] it's got the life to reproduce itself is
[1:37:35] in the seed
[1:37:39] amen
[1:37:42] amen praise
[1:37:45] God again in power of
[1:37:49] transformation he says now he had all
[1:37:52] this in mind and he said let there be
[1:37:54] now that's Genesis 1 let there be this
[1:37:56] let there be that he was sowing seed Let
[1:38:00] Let It Be Here let it be here let it be
[1:38:02] here and he knew it was going to be that
[1:38:04] way because it cannot change now that
[1:38:07] gives us Faith then in what we what he
[1:38:09] said here it's going to be so let's let
[1:38:12] that seed fall into our hearts that we
[1:38:16] might be the bedding grounds of that see
[1:38:18] into our
[1:38:19] hearts remember in one analogy you're
[1:38:24] the seed that's from a previous
[1:38:25] civilization that's laying underneath
[1:38:27] this judgment of this body that you're
[1:38:28] born into and it's the spoken word of
[1:38:31] God that begins to move the darkness and
[1:38:34] the Mist off of your life so that the
[1:38:36] light of the word can strike it and
[1:38:37] bring it to life that's that's one
[1:38:39] analogy but now we're coming to the
[1:38:41] other one now you're the good ground
[1:38:45] amen what what facilitates good ground
[1:38:49] what makes it good ground what made it
[1:38:51] good ground is it didn't have rocks in
[1:38:53] it yeah it didn't have Thorn covering it
[1:38:55] wasn't a sidewalk and I would venture to
[1:38:58] say it was tilled
[1:39:00] ground that means this is ground that
[1:39:03] somebody predetermined that seed would
[1:39:05] fall in yeah ground that was I would say
[1:39:08] this predestinated ground predetermined
[1:39:10] ground for the seed to fall and that's
[1:39:13] the elect of God God has predestinated
[1:39:16] good ground in every age where his seed
[1:39:18] for every age is going to fall God did
[1:39:20] not leave it up to chance he wasn't
[1:39:22] hoping that maybe some seed would fall
[1:39:24] in a good patch of open dirt he made
[1:39:26] sure before the foundation of the world
[1:39:28] that there was going to be good ground
[1:39:30] in every age for his seed to fall and by
[1:39:34] predestination he has made if we're
[1:39:35] Believers and children of his he has
[1:39:37] made us by predestination good ground
[1:39:40] amen and what does the good ground need
[1:39:42] the only thing the good ground needs Hey
[1:39:44] listen the ground never prepared
[1:39:47] itself tell me in a patch of ground that
[1:39:49] this designated I'm going to be your
[1:39:52] Field of Corn no somebody else made that
[1:39:54] choice somebody else removed the rock
[1:39:56] somebody else pulled off the obstacle
[1:39:57] somebody else tilled it somebody else
[1:39:59] fertilized it amen I never determined
[1:40:02] that I was going to be good ground but
[1:40:03] God before the foundation of the world
[1:40:05] said that I was going to be good
[1:40:09] ground that was his choosing not mine
[1:40:12] now what do I need I need that good seed
[1:40:14] of the word for my day I need it to fall
[1:40:17] in this good ground so that it can bring
[1:40:19] forth the life of Jesus
[1:40:21] Christ I need the word
[1:40:24] amen he says so let's let the seed fall
[1:40:27] into our hearts what seed is he talking
[1:40:30] about the seed that is sword went forth
[1:40:31] to swow the word of God that we might be
[1:40:34] the bedding grounds of that se into our
[1:40:36] hearts and let us act out this place
[1:40:38] that he has placed Us in in the last
[1:40:40] days see let the seed fall in our hearts
[1:40:43] Lord let the word fall in my heart let
[1:40:45] there not be any unbelief like Abraham
[1:40:48] when he was an old man looked like
[1:40:50] impossible how are they going to do that
[1:40:52] how is he going to be this way he never
[1:40:55] considered that he just received the
[1:40:57] word of God and went on believing it and
[1:40:59] God brought it to
[1:41:03] pass now God had said all these things
[1:41:05] so he knew it would be and it did he
[1:41:08] brought forth of its
[1:41:12] kind
[1:41:14] Abraham was good
[1:41:17] ground you believe
[1:41:19] that he was good ground and when the
[1:41:23] seed fell in the good ground that he was
[1:41:25] going to be a father of Nations that he
[1:41:26] was going to bring forth the
[1:41:28] son listen he could not produce that
[1:41:33] himself all he could do was let the seed
[1:41:36] fall into his heart and brother B said
[1:41:39] keep believing
[1:41:41] it because the life to produce itself to
[1:41:44] transform itself is already in the
[1:41:49] seed Abraham couldn't make it happen
[1:41:53] when he tried he
[1:41:54] failed he couldn't force it he couldn't
[1:41:57] do anything the only thing he could do
[1:42:00] was receive it into the ground that he
[1:42:02] had into his heart and believe it and
[1:42:05] let it do what it was predestinated to
[1:42:08] do it wasn't Abraham that brought forth
[1:42:11] a child it was the promised word of God
[1:42:14] that brought forth a child so that it
[1:42:17] wasn't his efforts it wasn't his
[1:42:18] intellect it wasn't his abilities it
[1:42:20] wasn't him it was God who formed his own
[1:42:23] word it was the promised word that
[1:42:26] produced the son not Abraham who
[1:42:28] produced the
[1:42:29] son and neither it is it going to be you
[1:42:31] and I who produced the life of Jesus
[1:42:34] Christ as a member of the Bride it's
[1:42:36] going all we can do is be the good
[1:42:38] ground that he predestinated and receive
[1:42:40] that prophecy receive that word of the
[1:42:42] Lord into our heart and just believe it
[1:42:44] and hold fast to it and let it do what
[1:42:47] it was already designed to do it'll
[1:42:49] bring forth its own life it'll bring
[1:42:51] forth and manifest its own manifestation
[1:42:54] amen why because God promised it he's
[1:42:56] going to have a bride without spot or
[1:42:58] wrinkle it means he's going to have a
[1:43:00] bride without spot a
[1:43:03] wrinkle now let's just look at Abraham
[1:43:05] for a minute if if God tells Abraham
[1:43:08] Abraham out of your loins is going to
[1:43:10] come a son he's going to come from you
[1:43:11] you're going to have a child you're
[1:43:12] going to be a father of
[1:43:16] Nations if that word preached becomes
[1:43:20] the measuring line that Abraham has to
[1:43:23] measured to in order to become right in
[1:43:25] the eyes of
[1:43:26] God Abraham's got a
[1:43:30] problem because
[1:43:32] Abraham has an infertile
[1:43:37] wife he can't produce
[1:43:41] it if God if the word of the Lord that
[1:43:43] came to Abraham became the
[1:43:47] measurement then Abraham has to reach
[1:43:50] the measurement in order to be right in
[1:43:52] the eyes of God
[1:43:55] then Abraham is defeated before he ever
[1:43:57] started Abraham's finished cuz he can't
[1:44:01] produce a
[1:44:03] son they come up with plans and he
[1:44:05] produces a son and that fails
[1:44:10] and I'd like to paint another
[1:44:14] picture the word of the Lord was not the
[1:44:17] measuring line by which Abraham had to
[1:44:19] achieve in order to be part of God
[1:44:24] the prophecy was God declaring to
[1:44:27] Abraham what I'm going to do with
[1:44:33] you it wasn't what I need you to do for
[1:44:37] me it's what I'm going to do for
[1:44:41] you
[1:44:43] amen you know what this message
[1:44:46] is this message is a vision of what a
[1:44:48] Perfect Bride
[1:44:50] is a bride with the gifts of the Spirit
[1:44:54] a bride with the full truth of the word
[1:44:55] a bride who's humble and submissive and
[1:44:58] perfect in every way a bride adorned in
[1:45:00] the wedding garment a bride who in every
[1:45:03] way is a reflection of her bridegroom on
[1:45:05] Earth do you know what that prophecy is
[1:45:07] not it is not a measuring line for you
[1:45:10] to measure up
[1:45:12] toise God it is not God saying this is
[1:45:16] my bride I will have a bride in this day
[1:45:19] this is the standard for the bride now
[1:45:21] let's see if you can make it yeah and if
[1:45:23] you make it you'll be my
[1:45:26] bride that's just as foolish of Abraham
[1:45:28] trying to be a father of
[1:45:30] Nations but you know what the prophecy
[1:45:32] is in our day you know what the message
[1:45:34] is God's saying this is what I'm going
[1:45:36] to do with you amen this is where I'm
[1:45:39] taking you this is the direction you're
[1:45:40] going in this is where this is all going
[1:45:42] to end it's all going to end and I'm
[1:45:44] going to have a bride I will present
[1:45:46] myself a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:45:49] or blemish or any such thing never
[1:45:51] required you to do it all all you got to
[1:45:53] do is let it fall into good ground and
[1:45:55] just keep believing it and keep walking
[1:45:57] and you just keep saying it's nothing
[1:45:59] but the truth you don't have to make it
[1:46:01] come to pass you don't have to twist
[1:46:03] yourself in knots to make it come to
[1:46:04] pass you just keep believing it because
[1:46:06] the power is in the prophecy to bring
[1:46:09] itself to
[1:46:11] pass we need to let that word of the
[1:46:13] Prophet fall into to good ground and
[1:46:16] just keep believing and and be willing
[1:46:18] to wait if God said let there be light
[1:46:20] 800 years was light it didn't matter if
[1:46:22] there was going to be light and if God
[1:46:24] said he's going to have a bride without
[1:46:26] spot a wrinkle and he sent a message to
[1:46:27] produce it I don't care if it's 50 years
[1:46:30] of my life I don't care if I live to be
[1:46:31] 120 years old and I'm sitting at 119 and
[1:46:34] I thought Oh I thought it would happen a
[1:46:36] long time ago I don't want it to change
[1:46:38] anything in my heart that God at 119
[1:46:41] years old can change me into that
[1:46:44] image because he said so cuz it's his
[1:46:47] word because when it came time for it to
[1:46:49] come into manifestation he had to bring
[1:46:52] somebody on the seat that could preach
[1:46:53] it and when it was preached it put
[1:46:55] things into motion amen that over
[1:46:57] decades has been transpiring to bring us
[1:47:00] more and more into that
[1:47:02] image it's not our efforts it's not that
[1:47:04] we're better people it's not that we're
[1:47:06] doing a better job or we have a better
[1:47:08] understanding of the message it's the
[1:47:10] prophecy bringing itself to life in you
[1:47:12] and
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:16] I see the reason we we the reason we get
[1:47:20] desponded or discouraged or pulled back
[1:47:23] or overly
[1:47:25] aggressive is when we think the message
[1:47:28] says this is what a bride is now we all
[1:47:32] got it we got come on guys let's get
[1:47:35] there and then all of a sudden the
[1:47:37] pastors got to make it happen the
[1:47:39] Evangelist has to make it happen the
[1:47:40] preachers got to work and the dads and
[1:47:42] the moms got to make their kids and we
[1:47:44] all got to push each other and we don't
[1:47:45] let anybody get away with anything and
[1:47:47] we why cuz we got to get
[1:47:50] here and every time we get One Step Up
[1:47:53] On The Run on the ladder that way guess
[1:47:55] what happens we fall back
[1:47:58] down until we become despondent and
[1:48:01] discouraged and feel like it's never
[1:48:02] going to happen things in my life are
[1:48:03] never going to change I'm always going
[1:48:05] to struggle with this I'm always going
[1:48:06] to struggle with
[1:48:11] that let's change our vision of what God
[1:48:13] gave us am
[1:48:17] amen God did not give us a standard
[1:48:19] measuring line for us to climb to so
[1:48:21] that we could be bride
[1:48:23] first he said you are
[1:48:25] bride
[1:48:26] amen not hopefully someday you are by
[1:48:30] virtue of the faith that's in your heart
[1:48:32] it declares that you're bride because
[1:48:34] only the bride's going to believe this
[1:48:37] message so he settles that question
[1:48:39] first you're a child of God why what's
[1:48:42] the evidence
[1:48:43] Faith but he didn't give me a
[1:48:45] certificate in the mail I would have
[1:48:46] liked to have had one there's days I
[1:48:48] would like to have it on my refrigerator
[1:48:51] but you know what the devil would do if
[1:48:52] if I got it he would be like no no you
[1:48:54] got that wrong there's another Chad Lamb
[1:48:55] they got the addresses mixed
[1:49:01] up I would love to have that but the
[1:49:03] security is faith faith is the
[1:49:06] evidence things not see so he goes ahead
[1:49:09] and tells you your
[1:49:12] bride and then he doesn't give you a
[1:49:14] standard to measure to in order to be
[1:49:16] bride what he does is he calls you bride
[1:49:19] and then he points to a spot on the map
[1:49:22] and he says you just stay close to me
[1:49:26] this is where I'm taking
[1:49:28] you you just stick close to me I'm not
[1:49:32] asking you to go I'm not asking you to
[1:49:34] achieve I'm not asking you to find all
[1:49:37] I'm asking you to do is trust
[1:49:39] Meen this is our
[1:49:42] destination together this is where the
[1:49:44] word is taking
[1:49:48] us you see the same truth with the wrong
[1:49:51] Vision brings nothing but
[1:49:54] despair but the same truth with a
[1:49:57] different Vision brings so much joy and
[1:49:59] anticipation because now every service I
[1:50:02] step into every time I pick up my Bible
[1:50:05] every time I pray every time I listen to
[1:50:07] a message God is might be just directing
[1:50:10] me down this map the next I might be
[1:50:12] getting to the next Village and the next
[1:50:13] Village and the next Bend in the road
[1:50:15] what's he doing he's promised to take me
[1:50:17] there he's going to take me there and
[1:50:19] the preaching of the gospel and the word
[1:50:21] that he's given me is the method he's
[1:50:22] taking me there praise God we're getting
[1:50:25] there and now there's a hopeful
[1:50:27] expectation there's Faith there's joy
[1:50:30] now every service is not coming to find
[1:50:32] out how far below the mark I am but
[1:50:34] every service is an opportunity for God
[1:50:36] to Lead Me One Step Closer to the
[1:50:38] destination he's taking me
[1:50:40] to and you can walk in the church with
[1:50:43] absolutely two exactly different
[1:50:45] expectations and one will bring a joy
[1:50:47] and anticipation in your heart and the
[1:50:49] other will bring a dread an absolute
[1:50:51] dread amen and a desire to run out the
[1:50:53] back
[1:50:59] door amen yeah and if we've got the
[1:51:02] wrong Vision let's just say we have the
[1:51:03] wrong Vision we've got the vision of I'm
[1:51:06] going to come to church and find out how
[1:51:07] far away I am from The Mark
[1:51:09] again and then the pastor announces
[1:51:11] we're going to have an evangelist on
[1:51:13] Sunday how do you come into
[1:51:17] church way worse than before
[1:51:23] but with this other
[1:51:25] picture oh we're having an evangelist I
[1:51:28] know something's weighing me down on
[1:51:29] this journey and it's got to get cut off
[1:51:31] of
[1:51:33] me I know I'm a little tired I know that
[1:51:36] I'm a little author I don't know what it
[1:51:38] is but God's going to come and cut it
[1:51:39] off of me because he's promised to get
[1:51:41] me from point A to point B by his own
[1:51:43] effort by his own leading by his own
[1:51:45] work and this is one of the methods he's
[1:51:47] going to use it it's not a you got to do
[1:51:49] better it's no hey if you just drop that
[1:51:51] and let go of it it's going to be
[1:51:54] easier and the vision about what the
[1:51:56] word is doing in our lives changes the
[1:51:59] way we step into the sanctuary and the
[1:52:01] way we pray before the service and the
[1:52:03] way we listen to the
[1:52:05] word it has everything to do with the
[1:52:08] way we understand this message and what
[1:52:10] we believe this message to be yeah amen
[1:52:14] and some of that was formed in us a Long
[1:52:16] Ago by the way people presented and
[1:52:18] handled and our own temperaments and
[1:52:20] things that happen in life but I'm here
[1:52:22] to to tell you that God is Not setting a
[1:52:25] measuring standard that's impossible to
[1:52:27] achieve he didn't do it for Abraham he
[1:52:29] didn't do it for anybody else what he
[1:52:31] has done is he's told you where our
[1:52:33] destination is he's pointed to the map
[1:52:36] and said listen this is where I'm taking
[1:52:39] you and how is he going to get us there
[1:52:41] he's going to use the
[1:52:45] word oh my goodness
[1:52:54] see there just a few more things I want
[1:52:57] to share as I wind down I'm just going
[1:52:58] to skip ahead and share just a couple
[1:53:00] more
[1:53:01] things and there's a couple more quotes
[1:53:03] out of God's power to transform that I
[1:53:05] want to
[1:53:08] read he says and everything under
[1:53:11] control to bring forth of its kind now
[1:53:13] remember to bring when he put the seed
[1:53:15] in the Earth the seed can only come
[1:53:17] forth with the power of life within it
[1:53:20] to transform it from a seed to a plan or
[1:53:23] whatever it was his transforming power
[1:53:25] now God put the seed in there with
[1:53:27] potentials that would be what he said it
[1:53:29] would
[1:53:31] be that there's two ways of looking at
[1:53:35] this you're the
[1:53:36] seed and in you he already put the
[1:53:40] potentials of what you will
[1:53:42] be it's not what you paste on glue on or
[1:53:45] acquire it's what's already inside of
[1:53:47] you just coming to
[1:53:49] manifestation it's the life is already
[1:53:52] in the seed the transforming power to
[1:53:55] transform the the transforming power to
[1:53:58] transform an oak tree into that
[1:53:59] beautiful glorious Oak with all those
[1:54:01] acorns on it is already in the seed in
[1:54:04] seed
[1:54:05] form it's already there but then on the
[1:54:08] other side when God's preaching the word
[1:54:11] and that word is to produce something in
[1:54:12] our lives amen the power of
[1:54:15] transformation is in the word that's
[1:54:18] preached and when we're the good ground
[1:54:20] and let the seed fall into our hearts
[1:54:22] the power of transformation is already
[1:54:25] in the seed if that word's preached it
[1:54:28] will if it's preached cherry tree guess
[1:54:30] what's going to produce cherry tree if
[1:54:32] it's produced Palm to preach palm tree
[1:54:35] guess what's it going to produce a palm
[1:54:36] tree because when we receive the seed of
[1:54:39] God in our hearts is good ground and
[1:54:41] rest it's got life in it already and the
[1:54:44] preaching of the Gospel is taking us
[1:54:46] some place amen because the word has a
[1:54:50] life already embedded in it
[1:54:53] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:54:55] power of life within it to transform it
[1:54:58] from a seed to a plant or whatever it is
[1:55:00] his transforming power now God put the
[1:55:02] seed in there with potentials that it
[1:55:04] would be what he said it would be and as
[1:55:06] long as it stays in its right category
[1:55:08] it would be just exactly what God said
[1:55:09] it would be it had to be that way
[1:55:12] because he had made it that way and made
[1:55:13] a channel that anything that stays in
[1:55:15] his channel in his line of word will
[1:55:17] have to bring forth exactly like his
[1:55:19] word said it would do it cannot move
[1:55:21] from there there it's channeled just
[1:55:23] exactly right so with everything and
[1:55:25] Trust in his own son that it would be
[1:55:28] that way when God said it's all good so
[1:55:30] I'll just rest and each one of those
[1:55:32] seeds has power in itself to transform
[1:55:35] itself into the species that I desire it
[1:55:38] to
[1:55:40] be you know what that tells me you're
[1:55:43] not changing yourself into
[1:55:47] anything and you don't have the power to
[1:55:49] transform yourself if there's any
[1:55:51] transforming power in you it's the power
[1:55:53] that God embedded into the seed Gene
[1:55:55] when he placed it in you and now he's
[1:55:57] bringing word on top of that to produce
[1:56:00] that
[1:56:02] life that's what it must be because I've
[1:56:04] given every seed transforming power to
[1:56:06] make out of itself in its potentials now
[1:56:09] to make out of itself exactly what I
[1:56:11] want it to be God has never changed just
[1:56:13] the same today as he was then God is
[1:56:15] determined to do something he'll do it
[1:56:17] nothing is going to stop him right so
[1:56:22] when you look at when we went from the
[1:56:24] Dark Ages into Luther's day God had to
[1:56:28] bring a word and that word had to have
[1:56:30] within it transforming power because
[1:56:32] people were steeped in darkness and
[1:56:34] Catholicism amen so what God provided to
[1:56:37] them was a seed with transforming power
[1:56:40] and when that seed fell into good ground
[1:56:42] it transformed them from the Dark Ages
[1:56:44] from Catholicism and the
[1:56:47] protestantism they didn't do it
[1:56:49] themselves it was the word that was
[1:56:50] preached that did it
[1:56:52] when they moved from justification to
[1:56:55] sanctification it wasn't that they did
[1:56:57] some sort of work themselves it was the
[1:56:59] power of the word transformed the whole
[1:57:02] age
[1:57:03] amen and the same thing's happening
[1:57:06] today that's why am mean God has sent us
[1:57:08] a glorious message and this message is
[1:57:10] huge and it covers so many facets but
[1:57:13] God in his great wisdom has left a
[1:57:15] five-fold Ministry upon the Earth amen
[1:57:17] because we come to the foolishness of
[1:57:18] preaching that we might be made whole
[1:57:20] and God is Anointed by inspiration men
[1:57:23] who will pick up parts of that message
[1:57:25] because the seasons in our life are
[1:57:27] changing now it's time for this to
[1:57:29] manifest but I can't manifest It On My
[1:57:31] Own It Takes the preaching of the word
[1:57:33] to bring me from justification to
[1:57:35] sanctification sanctification to the
[1:57:37] baptism of Holy Ghost the children of
[1:57:39] God never made this transition through
[1:57:41] the church ages on their own it was
[1:57:42] always the power of the word that was
[1:57:44] preached that they responded to and
[1:57:46] reive brought itself to pass right amen
[1:57:50] and that's why we come to church
[1:57:52] Wednesday and Sunday and listen to
[1:57:54] preaching and listen to text why because
[1:57:56] we believe that God through the
[1:57:57] foolishness of preaching is making us
[1:57:59] whole he's restoring us he's healing us
[1:58:02] he's bringing us to our ought to be
[1:58:04] healthy condition as children of God and
[1:58:06] it's going to take certain Seasons
[1:58:08] certain words and certain Seasons to
[1:58:10] bring about changes that we need to make
[1:58:12] in our life because when we were amen
[1:58:14] when we were in Luther's age we were
[1:58:16] blind to sanctification and had no need
[1:58:18] no knowledge of needing to live a
[1:58:20] Sanctified life but when the season was
[1:58:22] going to change God brought up a man who
[1:58:24] preached you must live a Sanctified life
[1:58:27] right didn't get a new
[1:58:30] Bible we don't get a new message but
[1:58:33] when the seasons change God's got
[1:58:35] anointed inspired men to come and bring
[1:58:37] that message in a way now you can say
[1:58:39] that's it that's nothing but the truth
[1:58:41] receive it into good ground and let that
[1:58:44] word that's been preached bring the
[1:58:47] change how many of you have been
[1:58:50] changing amen
[1:58:53] how many of you notice preaching
[1:58:55] changes preaching in a church changes
[1:58:59] from year to year it changes you can go
[1:59:01] through a season that's super Dynamic
[1:59:03] where you can hardly stay in your seat
[1:59:05] you want to scream and shout and every
[1:59:07] son your leg shaking you want to just
[1:59:08] get up and say hallelujah there's
[1:59:10] nothing but the
[1:59:11] truth then you go into another season
[1:59:13] and all you want to do is Weep the whole
[1:59:15] time and you say wo is me God I need
[1:59:18] changes in my life one season will tell
[1:59:21] you the greatest Thing That Ever Walked
[1:59:23] you're the apple of God's eye nothing
[1:59:25] can harm you and you want to run all
[1:59:26] over the building the next season in
[1:59:28] life you think I'm nothing but a dirt
[1:59:30] ball and I'll never be any good if God
[1:59:31] doesn't save me I need his
[1:59:35] help that's the foolishness of
[1:59:38] preaching it's not man's
[1:59:40] ideas that's God using as an inspired
[1:59:43] channel that he has to bring us in
[1:59:46] seasons of our walk and seasons of our
[1:59:48] life remember Brother Kyle preached
[1:59:51] seasons of life not long
[1:59:54] ago God knows how to bring us through
[1:59:57] those transitions in our life and he's
[1:59:58] going to do it by his
[2:00:00] word he's not asking us to Buck up and
[2:00:03] get with the program and figure it
[2:00:06] out if there's a change needed he'll
[2:00:08] bring the word that brings the
[2:00:11] change if there's growth needed he'll
[2:00:13] bring the word that brings the
[2:00:16] growth and that's why we should have
[2:00:19] respect for the foolishness of preaching
[2:00:23] I don't say that cuz we don't obviously
[2:00:25] you're
[2:00:27] here but I think we should realize what
[2:00:29] a blessed benefit it
[2:00:31] is that God is going to bring word in
[2:00:36] due season for my growth yeah amen he's
[2:00:41] not no matter what what's happening he's
[2:00:44] not here to say you're not good enough
[2:00:46] meet the standard he's here to say this
[2:00:49] is where we're going now amen this is
[2:00:52] where I'm taking you now because the
[2:00:53] word will produce
[2:00:55] itself do you believe that we have to
[2:00:59] believe that amen the problem is if we
[2:01:01] don't believe that we're defeated before
[2:01:03] we start the word has to produce
[2:01:07] itself
[2:01:10] Amen brother B says again in God's power
[2:01:13] to transform he said that word has to
[2:01:15] come to pass it's God word plant it in
[2:01:18] your heart if you want to go in the
[2:01:19] Rapture if you want to be a Christian
[2:01:22] genuine placed this word as I believe it
[2:01:24] was Ezekiel God said take that scroll
[2:01:27] and eat it up that the prophet in the
[2:01:29] word would become the same and every
[2:01:31] promise in there has to manifest itself
[2:01:33] because it's God's original seed don't
[2:01:35] you let some educated Theologian out
[2:01:37] here try to pump it out of you don't you
[2:01:39] let him spray you with some carnal
[2:01:41] science and knowledge and education you
[2:01:43] believe God I love that analogy what
[2:01:46] brother bam said he says
[2:01:48] listen he says if you want to go in the
[2:01:51] rapture
[2:01:52] so if I stand to in front of a group of
[2:01:54] people I say do you want to make the
[2:01:55] Rapture I mean I don't know anybody
[2:01:57] that's going to not raise their hand we
[2:02:00] all want to go in the
[2:02:01] Rapture if you want to be Christians
[2:02:04] genuine place this word then he says
[2:02:07] then he goes back to Ezekiel he says
[2:02:09] like Ezekiel was told to eat the
[2:02:12] scroll brother baham didn't say if you
[2:02:14] want to make the Rapture make sure you
[2:02:18] stop indulging in
[2:02:20] entertainment make sure you come to
[2:02:22] church every service and pay your ties
[2:02:24] and don't let me ever see you
[2:02:28] speed you understand that's not what
[2:02:31] he's
[2:02:32] saying so if you want to make the
[2:02:34] Rapture take the word feed on the word
[2:02:38] become one with the word because the
[2:02:40] word's going in the Rapture amen the
[2:02:43] word will produce its own life the word
[2:02:45] will bring it to pass inside of you what
[2:02:47] our job is not to analyze our job is not
[2:02:50] to perfect our job is not to self self
[2:02:52] educate or self perfect our job is just
[2:02:54] to receive the word in the good ground
[2:02:56] and let the word do what it's supposed
[2:02:58] to
[2:03:01] do let's turn to John 6 I want to finish
[2:03:04] here with just this
[2:03:06] thought John chapter 6
[2:03:22] John chap 6 verse
[2:03:28] 63 says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[2:03:31] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[2:03:33] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[2:03:36] and they are
[2:03:37] life the words that I speak unto you
[2:03:40] they are spirit and they are life
[2:03:42] brother Brenham in the fourth seal said
[2:03:44] the word itself is
[2:03:47] spirit so the word itself is Spirit it's
[2:03:52] spirit in word
[2:03:54] form why because God and the word and
[2:03:57] Christ and spirit they're not separate
[2:03:59] things they're all the same thing the
[2:04:02] word itself is spirit it's spirit in
[2:04:05] word form then you see when it's
[2:04:07] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[2:04:09] of the word goes to work and
[2:04:12] acts what's happening when I receive the
[2:04:14] word genuinely receive the word in my
[2:04:16] heart when I receive the word the the
[2:04:20] word itself is Spirit or like brother B
[2:04:22] said it has the power of transformation
[2:04:24] in it there's a life in the word when
[2:04:27] it's preached living a Living Word
[2:04:30] preached has life in
[2:04:32] it it's the life that comes from the
[2:04:36] word it's the life that comes with the
[2:04:37] word it's the life that reproduces
[2:04:39] itself it's the Holy
[2:04:41] Ghost if I receive the word and the and
[2:04:45] the purity of the word have it have its
[2:04:47] preached a living word for my day
[2:04:49] there's there's life in the word word
[2:04:52] the life of God Jesus said the words I
[2:04:54] speak to you they are spirit and they
[2:04:56] are
[2:04:57] life say I need more of the spirit
[2:05:00] absolutely you need more of the spirit
[2:05:01] how am I going to get more of the spirit
[2:05:03] take in more of the word because the
[2:05:04] word has life to produce life and it's
[2:05:08] the spirit that brings the word to life
[2:05:10] the spirit is the life of the word it's
[2:05:13] the spirit of God that produces the life
[2:05:15] that's in the word just keep receiving
[2:05:17] the word just keep saying
[2:05:20] God I Believe by your predestination I'm
[2:05:23] that good ground not cuz I'm good but
[2:05:25] because you made me you made me a
[2:05:27] receptor for your
[2:05:29] word I don't believe I'm good but I
[2:05:31] believe I'm a receptor for your word
[2:05:34] amen God let that word drop in my
[2:05:38] heart and help me to trust your process
[2:05:42] to bring it to
[2:05:47] life brother B said again Christ is the
[2:05:50] mystery of God revealed he says unbelief
[2:05:52] in the word which is himself The Word of
[2:05:54] Life the word only has life any other
[2:05:57] word is hybrid no matter how much it
[2:05:59] looks like it it isn't the word the word
[2:06:02] produces its own life and Eve swapped
[2:06:05] that for personal
[2:06:07] knowledge the word will produce the life
[2:06:10] why is it when God wanted to have a
[2:06:11] bride he sent a prophet with the
[2:06:14] word because the word that was preached
[2:06:17] when it falls into good ground it'll
[2:06:18] produce that life what life the life of
[2:06:21] the
[2:06:22] Bride what are you receiving bride word
[2:06:25] If you're receiving pure bride word with
[2:06:27] the life of bride inside of it what are
[2:06:29] you going to become
[2:06:31] bride not by effort but by reception by
[2:06:35] by receiving a word with life in it amen
[2:06:39] that's why it that's why we're not
[2:06:42] preaching the word that lived in a
[2:06:43] previous day because it was the life for
[2:06:46] that day but we're preaching the word
[2:06:48] that has life in it for today to
[2:06:49] manifest the life of today amen because
[2:06:52] that word has life in it it is life it
[2:06:55] is spirit and it is life and it will
[2:06:57] reproduce its own
[2:07:00] life brother B tells us in the rising of
[2:07:03] the
[2:07:04] sun he makes this statement this is the
[2:07:06] last thing I want to say this morning it
[2:07:08] says
[2:07:10] notice he said it was the first corn of
[2:07:13] God's wheat that had been raised from
[2:07:14] the dead God's first Corner Wheat by
[2:07:16] God's quickening power God had quickened
[2:07:19] his life raised him from the dead and he
[2:07:20] was the first first fruits of those that
[2:07:22] slept the first fruit he was the sheath
[2:07:24] he's speaking of the wave sheath
[2:07:26] now that's why they had to wave that
[2:07:29] sheath for it was the first one that
[2:07:31] came to maturity and it was waved as a
[2:07:33] memorial of Thanksgiving to God
[2:07:35] believing that the rest of them would
[2:07:37] come it was a
[2:07:40] sign brother B is telling us that he
[2:07:43] goes back to the wave sheath offering
[2:07:45] which was part of the Feast of the Lord
[2:07:47] in Israel it was instituted under the
[2:07:50] law of Moses and they would take the
[2:07:52] first part of the Harvest that would
[2:07:54] come to maturity brother R said
[2:07:55] somewhere around the corner where it got
[2:07:57] more light they would pluck it and bring
[2:07:58] it to the priest and the priest would
[2:08:00] pluck it up and he would wave it and he
[2:08:02] would do it as a memorial before God in
[2:08:05] Thanksgiving that God had brought their
[2:08:07] Harvest to full
[2:08:09] maturity but here's what he says and it
[2:08:11] was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving
[2:08:13] to God believing that the rest of them
[2:08:15] would come it was a sign so when that
[2:08:19] wave sheath was waved it became sign
[2:08:22] that the God who brought this to
[2:08:24] maturity is the same God will bring the
[2:08:26] whole crop to
[2:08:29] maturity
[2:08:31] amen he goes on to say and as Christ was
[2:08:34] the first one this is a little further
[2:08:36] down in the same message as Christ was
[2:08:38] the first one to raise from all the
[2:08:40] prophets and so forth although typed in
[2:08:41] many places he was the first fruits of
[2:08:44] those that slept and the bride coming of
[2:08:46] Christ coming out of the church they'll
[2:08:48] have to be a sheath waved again in the
[2:08:50] last day
[2:08:52] he's saying when we're coming out of the
[2:08:54] church in the bride coming of Christ
[2:08:56] there's going to be another waving of
[2:08:58] this sheath what is it the first part of
[2:09:01] the field to come to harvest maturity
[2:09:03] has to be waved as a
[2:09:05] Thanksgiving waving of the sheath what
[2:09:07] was the sheath the first one that came
[2:09:09] to mature the first one that proved it
[2:09:12] was wheat that proved it was a sheath
[2:09:14] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[2:09:16] talking about it was waved over the
[2:09:17] people and the first time there will
[2:09:19] come forth for the bride age for
[2:09:21] Resurrection out of dark
[2:09:23] denominationalism will be a message that
[2:09:25] the full maturity of the word has turned
[2:09:27] back again in its full power and is
[2:09:29] being waved over the People by the same
[2:09:31] signs and wonders that he did back there
[2:09:34] because I live ye live also speaking to
[2:09:36] his wife because I live he live also
[2:09:39] what a resurrection that was and what a
[2:09:42] resurrection this is to be quickened
[2:09:45] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[2:09:47] Jesus by God's quickening
[2:09:50] power remember that day that Jesus
[2:09:52] resurrected he was the wave sheath
[2:09:53] waving over them first fruits of those
[2:09:56] that slept showing that whatever God
[2:09:58] done to bring this seed to maturity
[2:09:59] he'll bring the whole Harvest to
[2:10:00] maturity but in the end time which is
[2:10:03] our time and the coming out of the
[2:10:04] churches and the bride coming Christ
[2:10:06] which is right now amen there's going to
[2:10:08] have to be another wave a sheath waved
[2:10:10] and he said when the fullness of the
[2:10:12] word comes to maturity and when God
[2:10:14] waved that he did that by plucking up a
[2:10:16] man who the word came to maturity and
[2:10:18] and showing a Son of God on display amen
[2:10:22] you know what he did when he showed that
[2:10:24] life he showed a life of humility he
[2:10:26] showed a life of reverence he showed a
[2:10:27] life of Miracles he showed a life of
[2:10:29] signs and wonders he showed a life
[2:10:30] reverent to God he showed us his life he
[2:10:33] showed us even uh the the bad things the
[2:10:35] mistakes the repentance so we saw
[2:10:36] somebody could humble themselves under
[2:10:38] the word we saw a life
[2:10:42] friends that message didn't wave that
[2:10:45] life over us so we could say I'm never
[2:10:47] going to be like brother Brandon right
[2:10:50] right I'm never have that kind of
[2:10:52] humility I'll never see those
[2:10:53] manifestations in my life I'll never
[2:10:55] have that kind of consecration I'll
[2:10:57] never have that kind of
[2:10:59] Revelation you know brother bam said
[2:11:01] they weren't all to be Moses we're not
[2:11:02] all to be the prophet of the age we
[2:11:04] don't have to do everything brother bam
[2:11:06] did that's not the point the point is
[2:11:09] the maturity as a Son of God he came to
[2:11:12] amen when that word come to maturity God
[2:11:13] had an example on the earth and it was
[2:11:15] waved over us not for us to lose heart
[2:11:17] at how far from me to him it is I mean
[2:11:20] the Gap may be huge and and and it may
[2:11:23] be insurmountable but that's not why God
[2:11:25] did that God did that to say the same
[2:11:28] method that got this man to be a vessel
[2:11:31] that I could use is the very same method
[2:11:33] I'm going to use for the whole field
[2:11:36] yeah that was never to discourage us
[2:11:39] friends it was always to encourage us
[2:11:41] this message was never to discourage us
[2:11:43] saying I'll never measure up it was
[2:11:45] always a destination a point on the map
[2:11:47] to look to with anticipation say the
[2:11:49] chief Shepherd is here and he said said
[2:11:51] he's going to take me from here to there
[2:11:53] so I am going from here to there it
[2:11:55] doesn't matter about me he's here
[2:11:58] himself that's why Christ came in this
[2:12:00] age to make sure that we weren't going
[2:12:02] to get derailed and we weren't going to
[2:12:04] fall backwards we weren't going to miss
[2:12:05] the mark and this end time he is going
[2:12:08] to have a bride without spot or wrinkle
[2:12:11] he's going to present to himself a bride
[2:12:13] fully array in the wedding garment and
[2:12:15] he didn't leave it to ourselves that's
[2:12:17] why he's returned in the fullness of the
[2:12:19] word so that he can take us by the arm
[2:12:22] and lead us all the way to the
[2:12:25] destination it's not you do this and you
[2:12:28] do that and you you rest and follow me
[2:12:31] the word I'm taking you all the way cuz
[2:12:33] the word has life
[2:12:36] itself this message that was preached
[2:12:39] and is being preached has the power in
[2:12:41] itself to produce you as a perfect
[2:12:46] bride it's not your human efforts it's
[2:12:49] not my human efforts it's not my prowess
[2:12:52] as a preacher it's not my ability it's
[2:12:54] not persuasion neither is it
[2:12:56] confirmation or reformation and neither
[2:12:58] is it force and neither ises it you
[2:13:00] trying
[2:13:01] harder now don't get me wrong try harder
[2:13:04] you should try harder like we should do
[2:13:06] our
[2:13:08] part the a calls to be lazy Christians
[2:13:11] right but we're not going to get there
[2:13:13] on our
[2:13:15] own that Ministry that was waved over us
[2:13:18] it was none other than Jesus Christ
[2:13:20] veiled behind flesh that's
[2:13:23] right showing us that in this generation
[2:13:27] under this Revelation sons of God can
[2:13:30] come to maturity come to adoption
[2:13:33] maturity it can happen it that was never
[2:13:37] done to discourage us that was always
[2:13:40] done to encourage us and give us
[2:13:43] Faith don't let the devil use what was
[2:13:46] meant for good don't let him use it for
[2:13:48] evil don't get locked up when you say
[2:13:51] how far I am from The Mark get excited
[2:13:54] because you got a lot of ground to
[2:13:56] gain and you're going to gain the
[2:14:01] ground it's not a matter of if it's only
[2:14:04] when and when is his determination not
[2:14:08] mine I can't we're standing here with a
[2:14:12] promise just like Abraham had a promise
[2:14:16] for 25 years he couldn't do one thing to
[2:14:18] move himself closer to the promise
[2:14:22] but every time that he needed to move
[2:14:23] closer to the promise God came on the
[2:14:25] scene and spoke to him and moved him
[2:14:28] closer to the
[2:14:30] promise he didn't have to find it on his
[2:14:32] own he didn't have to figure it out on
[2:14:34] his own he didn't have to assume he
[2:14:36] didn't have to strive all he had to do
[2:14:38] was rest in the promise and respond when
[2:14:40] God
[2:14:41] came what do you think it is you and I
[2:14:43] should be doing in this promise to the
[2:14:45] sons of
[2:14:47] Abraham just say God let that word fall
[2:14:50] in me and produce its own life let the
[2:14:54] conditions of this bright light let it
[2:14:56] bring that seed life that's already
[2:14:58] embedded in me your life because you're
[2:15:00] the word and you place the word in me
[2:15:02] let that word come to manifestation in
[2:15:07] me I
[2:15:09] wonder how much of our growth we slow
[2:15:12] down because we
[2:15:16] try I wonder how many times we trip over
[2:15:20] our own feet
[2:15:22] and we derail ourselves by our own
[2:15:24] efforts when brother Brenham said the
[2:15:26] entire Christian experience is based on
[2:15:29] rest and the Holy Ghost is rest
[2:15:35] amen if I can get to the place where I
[2:15:37] believe that word with all of my heart
[2:15:39] and I know it's the truth and I receive
[2:15:41] it and I stand with it then I can rest
[2:15:45] because now it's not me it's not my
[2:15:47] obligation it's not my requirement it's
[2:15:49] God who obligated himself to bring this
[2:15:51] word to pass I can rest cuz he's a good
[2:15:54] God I can rest cuz he tells the truth I
[2:15:55] can rest cuz he's never be defeated I
[2:15:57] can rest because he'll never fail amen I
[2:16:00] can rest because he said he'll have a
[2:16:02] bride without spot or wrinkle or any
[2:16:05] blemish or any such thing I can rest now
[2:16:08] as his bride because he said he'll
[2:16:11] present to himself he never said hey
[2:16:13] bride present yourself to
[2:16:15] me that was part A Wrinkle I can rest
[2:16:19] because he said
[2:16:22] Abraham could rest because God said we
[2:16:24] can rest because God
[2:16:26] said oh friends you know what this
[2:16:29] message is the most exciting thing we've
[2:16:31] ever heard you know what this message is
[2:16:34] encouragement and enthusiasm and
[2:16:37] excitement because we know where we're
[2:16:38] going amen the Rapture is for me how are
[2:16:41] you going to get there I don't know but
[2:16:42] he can't leave me behind because the
[2:16:44] Rapture is for me the body change is for
[2:16:46] me Perfection is for me maturity is for
[2:16:49] me adoptions for me why because I
[2:16:51] believe it's for
[2:16:53] me how you going to do it I don't know
[2:16:55] how I'm going to do it but this word
[2:16:57] will produce its own life it's got life
[2:16:59] in it and I've received this word and
[2:17:03] the spirit's going to work to bring it
[2:17:05] to pass I tell you what friends I love
[2:17:08] this
[2:17:09] message so powerful it's so encouraging
[2:17:12] it's so
[2:17:13] exciting I want to get to where I I
[2:17:15] can't wait to play the next tape because
[2:17:17] the next tape is going to take me the
[2:17:19] next step on that map
[2:17:21] cuz I know what the destination is it's
[2:17:23] joint HS with Christ it's City with him
[2:17:26] and a perfect Triune being and back on
[2:17:28] this Earth and a millennium that's the
[2:17:30] destination that's where I'm going how
[2:17:32] am I getting there my husband said he'll
[2:17:33] take me
[2:17:35] there and he's here now I've got him by
[2:17:38] the arm we're moving that direction and
[2:17:40] every sermon every service every
[2:17:42] scripture every prayer has the potential
[2:17:45] to take me one step closer to there amen
[2:17:47] I'm not going the wrong way cuz he's
[2:17:49] here to make sure I don't go the wrong
[2:17:51] way if I had my foolishness step to the
[2:17:53] left I believe he's here to bring me
[2:17:55] back to the
[2:17:57] right he didn't ask me to do it myself
[2:17:59] he asked me to trust him he didn't ask
[2:18:02] me to perform he asked me to rest amen
[2:18:06] he asked me to just to surrender and
[2:18:08] rest and trust and Obey and
[2:18:12] submit he'll do the
[2:18:14] rest how's he going to do it he's going
[2:18:17] to do it all kinds of ways but one way
[2:18:19] he's going to use the preaching of the
[2:18:20] word
[2:18:21] the foolishness of preaching to save
[2:18:24] them that
[2:18:26] believe and now I can't wait to hear
[2:18:29] preaching again amen and God bless you
[2:18:33] all let's Stand Together musicians if
[2:18:35] you'll
[2:18:36] come there's so many more things that
[2:18:39] I'd like to share we may at another
[2:18:40] point so many little Sid trails and
[2:18:43] things about the word and the
[2:18:46] spirit but I tell you God is so
[2:18:49] good amen
[2:18:51] you
[2:18:52] know nobody showed
[2:18:55] up in 1700 and so and so and said you
[2:19:00] know what I think it's time for a
[2:19:02] transition in the Christian walk and we
[2:19:04] should come to the truth of
[2:19:05] justification and not works and I'm
[2:19:07] going to be one of them that's not what
[2:19:10] happened God knew it was time when God
[2:19:13] knew it was time he sent a man with a
[2:19:15] message amen and that message
[2:19:17] transformed everything to match that
[2:19:19] word because it was the
[2:19:22] season nobody rose up in John Wesley's
[2:19:25] day and said you know what I think you
[2:19:27] know what we need to live a cleaner
[2:19:29] Holier life no it was God determined it
[2:19:32] was the season for that and when it was
[2:19:34] season God sent men to preach the gospel
[2:19:37] and that word that they preach
[2:19:38] transformed the Christian
[2:19:41] world you know what neither is it you
[2:19:43] and I that decided it's time to have a
[2:19:45] bride age it's time for a bride to come
[2:19:48] into manifestation it's time for a many
[2:19:50] member bride a people of God to actually
[2:19:52] put on Christ until Christ can dwell in
[2:19:54] them and the world can see Christ you
[2:19:56] know we didn't decide that he
[2:19:58] did he decided it's time and when it was
[2:20:01] time he sent a man with a gift to preach
[2:20:03] the gospel and he sent other gifted men
[2:20:04] along with him to preach that gospel and
[2:20:06] it's the word that was preached that's
[2:20:08] producing that
[2:20:10] bride what do we need to do receive it
[2:20:13] and Trust in it yield to it surrender
[2:20:16] and rest and let God do what he promised
[2:20:18] to do he's the one who moved every
[2:20:21] circumstance to get that Ministry around
[2:20:23] the
[2:20:24] world he's the one who moved all the
[2:20:27] circumstances in your life so that you
[2:20:28] would hear
[2:20:29] it is he not able to bring the word to
[2:20:32] pass in our lives I believe he is let's
[2:20:36] just bow our heads
[2:20:38] together dear Lord Jesus we thank you
[2:20:40] for your word
[2:20:42] Lord God what can we say when we say
[2:20:44] thank you for your
[2:20:46] word what a small thing to say
[2:20:51] Lord we tell people thank you
[2:20:53] for treats and
[2:20:56] blessings God it's more than a Thank You
[2:21:00] From My Heart Lord it's more than thank
[2:21:02] you for your word I realize I'd be
[2:21:05] nothing without your word I'd be lost
[2:21:08] and in darkness I'd be shrouded in all
[2:21:10] kinds of
[2:21:11] confusion I'd be wward and I'd be
[2:21:14] heartbroken and I'd be ripped to shreds
[2:21:16] and I would have ruined my
[2:21:18] life it's not just thank you for your
[2:21:20] word but your word is more than life to
[2:21:24] me God when we can't see you bring
[2:21:27] Revelation when we're confused you bring
[2:21:30] Clarity God you're continually unveiling
[2:21:33] yourself to us to make the picture come
[2:21:35] in clearer and better
[2:21:38] focus God forgive us for our anxiousness
[2:21:43] Lord forgive us for our frail human
[2:21:47] efforts forgive me Lord for thinking
[2:21:49] that
[2:21:51] you needed me to do
[2:21:53] something forgive me for those efforts I
[2:21:55] put forth trying to manufacture or to
[2:21:59] produce I truly am sorry
[2:22:02] Lord but God I'm here to say let that
[2:22:05] seed Fall In My Heart Lord let it take
[2:22:09] root let it take
[2:22:11] over God I want that seed to so fall
[2:22:14] into this ground that you've
[2:22:16] predestinated and
[2:22:17] chosen until in a short order nobody can
[2:22:20] see the ground anymore all they see is
[2:22:21] the
[2:22:22] crop that the ground is completely
[2:22:25] enveloped by the crop and the crop grows
[2:22:29] to maturity till now nobody sees the
[2:22:32] crop but they see the
[2:22:34] fruit let that be the Story of My Life
[2:22:37] Lord you sent a s in my day and that
[2:22:41] swer threw out seed and that seed fell
[2:22:43] in my
[2:22:44] ground thank you
[2:22:46] God Lord help all of us to be your sers
[2:22:50] that made me go about proclaiming your
[2:22:52] word Lord and may that word still fall
[2:22:54] into good ground and may it produce a
[2:22:57] Bountiful Harvest hundredfold
[2:23:00] over God as that seed falls into us may
[2:23:02] it bring the seed within us to life to
[2:23:05] manifest what you've ordained for us to
[2:23:07] be from before the foundation of the
[2:23:08] world for you did not call us in
[2:23:10] Luther's age you did not call us in
[2:23:12] Wesley's age you didn't call us in the
[2:23:13] Pentecostal age but you called us in the
[2:23:15] bride age to be your bride and that's
[2:23:18] the seed that you placed within us and
[2:23:20] that's what's manifesting and meant to
[2:23:22] manifest in our lives help us God God I
[2:23:27] pray that you would give us a boldness
[2:23:28] and a confidence in your word that we
[2:23:31] can just stand fast and rest assured
[2:23:33] that you will accomplish what you sent
[2:23:35] your word to accomplish for you declared
[2:23:38] in Isaiah that it will not return unto
[2:23:40] you void but it will accomplish the
[2:23:42] purpose you sent it for God you sent
[2:23:45] this message and you gave us your word
[2:23:48] and we believe it will accomplish its
[2:23:49] purpose
