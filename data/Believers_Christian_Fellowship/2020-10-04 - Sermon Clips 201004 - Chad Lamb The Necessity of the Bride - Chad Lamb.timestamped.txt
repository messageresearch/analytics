[0:07] show in the scripture it's
[0:08] there's there's more than what we can
[0:11] think and what we can imagine
[0:12] when he says they're waiting on us oh
[0:14] heaven is waiting on us
[0:16] the reconciliation of heaven earth is
[0:18] waiting on us amen it's got to have a
[0:20] bride of his own choosing that stands on
[0:22] the word
[0:22] to prove that she won't fall fail like
[0:24] eve fell then he can take her out of the
[0:26] way
[0:27] go to 144 000. they'll take the word and
[0:29] stand on the word which will complete
[0:31] redemption for the jews from the time of
[0:32] christ on
[0:33] then he'll burn the earth over then
[0:35] we'll have a millennial reign for a
[0:36] thousand years
[0:39] see none of that happens if there's not
[0:41] a bride to express the word then after a
[0:44] thousand years there's a resurrection of
[0:46] the dead and at the resurrection of the
[0:47] dead there's a judgment set the bride's
[0:49] not going to be judged
[0:50] she's going to be the one judging the
[0:53] husband and wife will be sitting on the
[0:54] throne
[0:55] you can sit with me in my throne you
[0:58] know you're not you shall judge the
[0:59] angels this is all the scriptures
[1:02] we're standing there in judgment and
[1:03] people are coming up and there's going
[1:05] to be people
[1:06] amen who's going to receive eternal life
[1:08] having never named the name of christ
[1:10] because of the good deeds they did to
[1:11] the elect
[1:16] but do you realize their entrance into
[1:18] eternal life will never come until this
[1:20] bride expresses the word
[1:22] millennium will never come 144 000 never
[1:25] come
[1:25] everything now everything is hinged
[1:29] on you and i keeping the word
[1:33] the reconciliation of heaven of earth
[1:36] everything is wrapped up down to this
[1:38] one thing
[1:39] you and i believing this word and
[1:41] standing on the word
[1:43] this isn't our pastime this isn't
[1:45] something that we do on the side
[1:46] we're not a mechanic and we believe the
[1:48] message no everything in our lives is
[1:51] for us to believe this word and keep
[1:52] this word
[1:54] and all heaven is behind us
