[4:19] My father knows what I need.
[4:28] In everything I go through,
[4:32] he knows what's best for me.
[4:40] My father knows what I need. He's got it
[4:46] all in control.
[4:49] He's got it all in control. Oh.
[4:58] Oh, he's got it all
[5:01] in control.
[5:06] He put that reassur
[5:11] way down in my soul.

[5:23] [Music]

[6:29] [Music]
[6:32] My father knows what I need. He's got it

[6:57] Put that reassur
[7:01] way down in my soul.
[7:07] [Music]
[7:08] He's got it all
[7:11] in control. Let's just stand together
[7:14] and we'll say, "He's got my life.
[7:17] I place my life in his hand.
[7:24] Oh, I place my life in his hand.
[7:32] So every road I walk down,
[7:37] oh you'll see me through.
[7:42] [Music]
[7:44] I place my life in his hand.
[7:50] Amen.
[7:52] As brother Chad comes tonight, let's
[7:54] just sing this song. We are so blessed.
[7:56] Amen.
[7:58] We are so
[8:01] blessed
[8:03] by the gifts from your hand.
[8:08] Oh, I just can't understand
[8:13] how you loved us so much. We are so
[8:21] blessed.
[8:23] Oh, we just can't find a way
[8:28] for the words that can say.
[8:32] Thank you, Lord, for your touch. When
[8:37] we're empty,
[8:40] you fill us till we overflow.
[8:46] When we're hungry,
[8:49] you feed us
[8:52] and cause us to know
[8:58] we are so
[9:01] blessed.
[9:03] Take what we have to bring.
[9:08] Take it all, everything.
[9:12] Lord, we love you so much.
[9:17] We are so
[9:21] blessed
[9:22] by the gifts from your hands.
[9:27] I just can't understand
[9:31] why you love us so much. We are so
[9:39] blessed.
[9:41] Can't find a way
[9:45] for the words that can say
[9:49] thank you Lord for your sing verse two.
[9:55] We are so
[9:59] blessed
[10:01] by the things you have done.
[10:05] By the victories
[10:08] we won,
[10:10] you brought us through. We are so
[10:17] blessed.
[10:18] Take what we have to bring. Oh, take it
[10:24] all. Everything,
[10:27] Lord, we bring it to you.
[10:33] Amen. Let's bow our heads this evening
[10:35] together. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful,
[10:39] Lord, that we can be here tonight. For
[10:42] God, we're so privileged, Lord, that you
[10:44] have gathered us once again. May we
[10:47] always view it as a privilege, Lord, as
[10:49] an opportunity, as a blessing. May we
[10:52] come with the right attitude, Lord, for
[10:53] you told us that's the right approach
[10:55] and the right approach is how we receive
[10:58] from you, Lord. May we come excited with
[11:00] anticipation in our hearts for you to
[11:02] feed us something from your word, some
[11:05] portion that will give us sustaining
[11:06] strength, something that will build us
[11:08] up, Lord, and help us to in our journey
[11:10] of life. God, I pray you take this
[11:13] vessel of mine under your control, Lord.
[11:15] And may I just yield and you take over
[11:18] for God, I long to hear from you as
[11:20] well, Lord. And I pray you just use this
[11:22] voice and use this gift inside this
[11:24] vessel for your glory. And God, may we
[11:27] leave here having grown, having gained,
[11:29] having benefited by your word. And Lord,
[11:32] and may we go forth, Lord, as shining
[11:34] lights in this world. We love you and we
[11:36] ask your blessing upon all we say and
[11:38] do. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[11:42] Amen.
[11:43] Man, God bless you all this evening. If
[11:45] you'd like to take your Bibles and turn
[11:47] with me to Matthew uh chapter 26.
[11:52] Amen. Uh while you're turning there, I
[11:54] just want to say it's been good to have
[11:56] brother Aaron Lang here from Germany
[11:58] visiting. He's been with us for 3 weeks,
[12:00] but he goes home tomorrow. So, God bless
[12:01] you, Aaron. May the Lord give you a safe
[12:03] journey home. And please take greetings
[12:05] back to the church, to brother Andreas
[12:07] and the whole church there in Germany
[12:08] and to your family as well. Amen. the
[12:12] longer people to stay, the more attached
[12:13] we get to them, you know, and that's the
[12:15] way it goes. But, um, may the Lord bless
[12:17] him. I also wanted to let you know that
[12:20] Sunday evening at the communion service,
[12:22] the congregation confirmed Brother Aaron
[12:24] Low is our trustee. So, he's our newest
[12:26] trustee. And so, I text him that evening
[12:28] to let him know the results of the vote.
[12:30] And he he told me, he said, "Brother
[12:32] Chad, if there's anything I can do to
[12:34] help, let me know." I said, "Your first
[12:36] task is to get the foul odor out of the
[12:38] sanctuary."
[12:40] So, I figure if he can make that one
[12:42] work, he can he he's good. So, might as
[12:45] well start with the hardest one. And and
[12:48] related to that, the farmer called and
[12:50] talked to brother Dean Hatfield this
[12:52] week. I think it was Monday, and
[12:53] apologized. And so, that was nice of
[12:56] him. He didn't have to do that, but he
[12:57] apologized. He never meant for it to be
[12:59] that fresh.
[13:02] And so apparently quite a few of the
[13:05] neighbors had called and filed
[13:06] complaints and uh had grievances and
[13:09] even called I think the EPA, but but
[13:11] nobody here. We didn't complain at all.
[13:13] So I think he appreciated that. And so
[13:14] thank you guys for not complaining and
[13:17] uh so but it was nice of him. We just
[13:19] pray the Lord will bless him for being
[13:20] thoughtful and kind. Amen. He's been a
[13:22] good neighbor. Been a very good
[13:23] neighbor. Amen. So while we're standing,
[13:26] before we're seated, let's look here at
[13:28] Matthew chapter 26.
[13:36] Matthew chap 26
[13:41] and verse 39.
[13:44] Matthew 26 and39. This is Jesus in the
[13:48] garden of Gethsemane.
[13:50] It says, "And he went a little farther
[13:51] and fell on his face and prayed, saying,
[13:54] Oh my father, if it be possible to let
[13:56] this cup pass from me, nevertheless, not
[13:59] as I will, but as thou wilt." And he
[14:02] cometh unto the disciples, and findeth
[14:04] them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What
[14:06] could you not watch with me one hour?
[14:08] Watch and pray that you enter not into
[14:10] temptation, that the spirit, the spirit
[14:13] indeed is willing, but the flesh is
[14:14] weak. He went away again a second time
[14:17] and prayed, saying,"Oh my father, if
[14:20] this cup may not pass away from me,
[14:22] except I drink it, thy will be done."
[14:25] And he came, and he found them asleep
[14:27] again, for their eyes were heavy. And he
[14:30] left them, and went away again, and
[14:31] prayed the third time, saying the same
[14:33] words. Then cometh he to his disciples,
[14:36] and said unto them, "Sleep on now, and
[14:39] take your rest. Behold, the hour is at
[14:41] hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed
[14:43] into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us
[14:46] be going. Behold, he is at hand that
[14:49] doth betray me. May God bless you as you
[14:52] take your seats. May God bless us as we
[14:54] look into his word and bless the reading
[14:56] of his word.
[14:58] Amen. If we could pull up the first
[15:00] slide there, brother Franco on the
[15:02] PowerPoint. Uh I wanted to take a
[15:04] subject we must will to do his will and
[15:07] a subtitle of listening for his voice.
[15:09] And uh there was something that brother
[15:12] uh null had said uh brother null Johnson
[15:15] had said on Sunday that you have to will
[15:17] to do God's will. And and he made an
[15:19] emphasis of that and it stuck out to me
[15:21] and I wanted to look at it and I wanted
[15:23] to minister on it. And so I've pulled
[15:25] that out and I just want to talk about
[15:26] that and a couple aspects of that as we
[15:29] move on this evening because I found it
[15:31] to be really important when we see Jesus
[15:34] in Gethsemane in in Gethsemane. He's
[15:37] here wrestling uh with himself. He he's
[15:40] wrestling this out and he's asking God
[15:43] if there's any other way, if there's
[15:45] another way. Uh uh he says in verse 39,
[15:48] "Father, if it's possible, let this cup
[15:51] pass from me. Nevertheless,
[15:53] nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou
[15:55] wilt. Jesus knew what was coming to him.
[15:58] He knew the trial that laid ahead. He
[16:00] could have ran away and hid. He could
[16:03] have taken off for another territory. He
[16:06] could have gone to Galilee. He could
[16:07] have hid out. But no, he stayed put in
[16:10] Jerusalem and he went to the garden and
[16:12] he knew it was about to happen. And here
[16:14] he's wrestling it out. Amen. Because God
[16:17] God is not going to do anything contrary
[16:19] to his will. He's got to wrestle and
[16:21] submit his will to the will of the
[16:23] father. And brother Benham explains to
[16:25] this to us because, you know, as null
[16:27] was saying, Jesus was completely man
[16:31] and completely God, but there's a
[16:32] complete man's side with his own will
[16:34] and he was he was wrestling his will.
[16:37] And brother Benham said when he came to
[16:38] the great battle of Gethsemane, would he
[16:41] take the sins of the world upon his
[16:43] shoulders or would he stay with his
[16:46] disciples what he wanted to do? So now
[16:48] he's got this the decision to make and
[16:51] now he's surrendering his will to the
[16:53] will of the father and he set us a
[16:56] tremendous example that you have to will
[16:59] to do God's will. Amen.
[17:01] So it was God's will that he go to
[17:03] Calvary and he's wrestling this out
[17:06] father if there's any other way. Then he
[17:07] comes over into verse 42 and he said oh
[17:10] my father if this cup may not pass away
[17:12] from me except I drink it thy will be
[17:15] done. He had surrendered his will to the
[17:18] father's will and we must will to do his
[17:20] will.
[17:21] Amen.
[17:21] Praise God.
[17:23] So I want to look at this a little bit.
[17:25] Uh brother Bam says in the message
[17:26] leadership
[17:28] sometime in life we have to confront the
[17:30] thing just like this young man did. He's
[17:32] speaking of the rich young ruler in the
[17:34] Bible because you are a mortal being and
[17:37] you are given the opportunity of choice.
[17:40] You have a choice. God made it so you
[17:42] can choose. If he put Adam and Eve on
[17:44] free moral agency that they could choose
[17:46] and then they made the wrong choice. And
[17:48] see, he can do no more to you than he
[17:51] did to them. He's got to put you the
[17:53] same thing so you can choose or reject.
[17:57] And so as we as we move along, we're
[17:59] going to find out that God always lays
[18:02] before us a choice. And many choices in
[18:05] life, God's constantly laying choices
[18:07] out before us. and and and and and we
[18:10] can choose because God has a brother Bam
[18:12] says in choosing of a bride there's an
[18:14] unlit unwritten law of choosing that's
[18:16] before us that God gave us free moral
[18:18] agency and we can choose you all could
[18:21] choose whether you come to church
[18:22] tonight or don't come to church tonight
[18:25] that's a choice you can choose whether
[18:27] whether you know whether you're a little
[18:30] tired or you have something else going
[18:31] on or or or or whether it's worth the
[18:34] sacrifice or whether you want to be
[18:36] diligent to the word of God that says
[18:37] forsake out the gathering together or
[18:39] there's something else that came up.
[18:41] Amen. And you had a choice to make
[18:43] and you all chose to be here.
[18:46] It wasn't mandatory. It wasn't forced
[18:48] and nobody came to your house and picked
[18:49] you up and drugg you here. You made a
[18:51] choice. But but you you exercised will
[18:54] over your will to do the will of God.
[18:58] And that's why I believe God will have
[18:59] something for you because we have to
[19:01] will to do his will. So there's choices
[19:04] all over the place. But it started all
[19:06] the way in the Garden of Eden. They had
[19:08] to choose whether they would stay with
[19:10] the word or whether they would leave the
[19:11] word. And they were given the right to
[19:13] make that choice.
[19:15] In Revelation chapter 4, the message,
[19:17] Revelation chapter 4, brother says, "Now
[19:20] to this gate, there's only one one gate
[19:23] that's called self-will." And he's
[19:24] talking about the gate to your soul, the
[19:26] innermost part of you. That gate to your
[19:28] soul is self-will. You're the boss of
[19:31] what goes in there. Amen. You never
[19:34] heard Brother Bam say, you know, God's a
[19:36] gentleman. God's not forcing anything.
[19:38] God's leading. God's drawing. God's not
[19:40] forcing.
[19:43] And again, in the same message, he said,
[19:45] "How did it self-will?"
[19:48] Why will you call that self-will,
[19:50] brother Brandon? Because it puts a man
[19:52] and woman back again just like Adam and
[19:55] Eve at the Garden of Eden.
[19:58] On what? The two trees. Self-will. This
[20:00] one is death. This one is life.
[20:02] Self-will. Free moral agency. God placed
[20:05] the first man, Adam and Eve, right there
[20:07] on free moral agency. He placed you the
[20:10] same place. And the only way that you
[20:12] can get this thing fixed in here is your
[20:15] own self-will. Hallelujah. Your
[20:17] self-will. You have to will to do God's
[20:20] will. You have to get rid of your own
[20:22] will to let God's will come in. For this
[20:24] is the only channel that leads to the
[20:26] heart. Remember he said this is the
[20:28] gate, self-will. So what is the gate
[20:30] that leads to your soul that leads to
[20:32] the innermost? It's your own self-will.
[20:34] You have to will to do God's will and
[20:36] you have to get rid of your own will to
[20:38] let God's will come in because our own
[20:41] will is a barrier sometimes to God's
[20:43] will.
[20:44] Our own desire and our own wants and our
[20:46] own will is a barrier to God's will
[20:48] because God is not forcing himself upon
[20:51] us because God is a gentleman. Amen. And
[20:53] God has left free moral agency intact.
[20:55] Amen. Our will sometimes becomes a
[20:58] barrier to God's will. It'll never stop
[21:00] God's will. God's will will be done. But
[21:02] within ourselves,
[21:04] right?
[21:04] We have to open the gate of self-will
[21:06] and get rid of our will so that God's
[21:08] will come in for this is the only
[21:10] channel that leads to the heart. Oh, you
[21:13] can join church. You Baptist and
[21:14] Presbyterians and you Methodist and
[21:16] Pilgrim Holiness can come to
[21:18] sanctification. But you have to will to
[21:20] do God's will, self-will, to let the
[21:23] Holy Spirit come in here to bring forth
[21:26] these signs shall follow them that
[21:28] believe in my name. They shall cast out
[21:30] devils. They shall speak with new
[21:31] tongues. They shall lay their hands on
[21:33] the sick or take up deadly things and so
[21:35] forth. These signs shall follow them
[21:37] that has let their will become my will
[21:40] and the works that I do shall they do
[21:42] also. I hope you don't miss it. There's
[21:45] a will to do God's will. You see what I
[21:47] mean? So, you see where where brother
[21:49] null got this statement from. Amen.
[21:51] Brother Ben makes it several times here
[21:52] in this message. And and even in the
[21:55] receiving of the Holy Ghost, you've got
[21:57] to surrender your will to receive God's
[21:59] will because it's God's will for you to
[22:01] have the new birth. It's God's will for
[22:03] you to be filled with his spirit.
[22:05] But we've got to get rid of our will and
[22:07] by our own will open up and let him come
[22:10] in and have dominion and have his way
[22:12] and and let his way become king and lord
[22:15] of our life. His way to be our way.
[22:17] Amen.
[22:18] We have to want it. Amen. We have to
[22:20] desire it. Amen. If we don't want it and
[22:23] desire it, and we have something in the
[22:24] self-will that's not wanting to give
[22:26] complete control over to God and get rid
[22:28] of our own selves and let him have
[22:30] preeminence, if there's something there,
[22:32] some selfish desire, some want of self,
[22:35] it's going to be a hindrance to the new
[22:37] birth.
[22:38] It's going to hold back the baptism of
[22:40] the Holy Ghost, but it's going to have
[22:42] to take a complete selling out and
[22:43] saying, "God, I don't want any of my own
[22:45] life. I don't want any of my own ideas.
[22:47] I don't want anything of myself. I just
[22:50] want your will to be done inside of me.
[22:53] That's the that's the channel to the
[22:55] heart. That's the gate to the heart. And
[22:57] when you can open the heart that way,
[22:59] Amen. Brother Bam said God wants to fill
[23:01] you more than you want to be filled. In
[23:04] fact, brother Bam said, "If you take a I
[23:06] can't remember the dimensions because I
[23:08] didn't look it up, but a pipe so many
[23:09] inches around, you take it from here out
[23:11] into space somewhere and you fill it
[23:13] with water, the pressure at the bottom
[23:15] of that pipe is would would re uh would
[23:19] I don't know, demonstrate to you, that's
[23:21] a good word, the desire how much God
[23:24] wants to pour himself into his
[23:26] children." Amen.
[23:29] But if we still want what we want more
[23:32] than God's will, we're keeping the gate
[23:35] closed.
[23:37] So, we've got to align our will with his
[23:39] will or sub submit our will to his will.
[23:42] And we have to will to let him have his
[23:45] will
[23:46] and then we open the gate.
[23:49] And God desires to fill us. It's not
[23:52] it's not complicated. It's a matter of
[23:55] opening the gate.
[23:57] You know, the scripture says uh and we
[23:59] quote it all the time uh in Acts chapter
[24:02] 2, repent and be baptized in the name of
[24:04] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[24:06] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[24:08] of the Holy Ghost. Whenever I baptize
[24:11] somebody, I talk to them about this gift
[24:12] of the Holy Ghost. Because a gift is
[24:15] something that's given to you and it's
[24:18] it didn't come because of merit. That's
[24:20] right.
[24:22] If I I tell people when whenever I
[24:24] baptize them, I said, "Have you ever had
[24:26] a birthday?" You know, most everybody's
[24:27] had a birthday. Have you ever got a
[24:28] birthday present? Yeah. Well, somebody
[24:30] will come to your house or or or bring
[24:32] it to work or to church or or to to to
[24:35] your party. Amen. And they bring a gift
[24:37] and they put your name on it. It's got a
[24:38] pretty package and a bow on it and they
[24:40] set it on a table somewhere. Amen. And
[24:42] that gift is for you. Amen. It's given
[24:45] for you by virtue of you having a
[24:47] birthday. It's an expression of love
[24:49] from one person to another. Amen. But
[24:51] that gift won't do you any good until
[24:53] you take the gift and open the package
[24:56] and receive the gift.
[24:58] And if you if you obey God's word and
[25:01] you repent, you turn from your way and
[25:03] turn to the word of God. Amen. Turn to
[25:05] Jesus Christ and and and you repent and
[25:08] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[25:10] Jesus Christ, you shall receive the gift
[25:12] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. But God is a
[25:15] gentleman and God is not forcing his way
[25:17] in the gate. There's got to be somebody
[25:19] on the other side to receive the gift
[25:21] that he's presenting in this age.
[25:23] There got to be somebody who says, "God,
[25:25] I don't want anything else but you."
[25:27] I don't want my own way in any other
[25:29] matter. I want your way in all my
[25:31] matters.
[25:33] And that that is the path. Here's what
[25:36] brother said. That's the only channel
[25:38] that leads to the heart.
[25:40] Amen. He it says here in this message,
[25:44] he says, "Sir, in this case, the latch
[25:46] is on the inside." He's referring to
[25:48] that painting where Jesus is standing at
[25:50] the door knocking and and the critic
[25:52] begins to criticize and he says, "But
[25:53] you missed one thing." And he says,
[25:55] "There's no latch on the outside. Jesus
[25:57] can't get in." And brother Rem says,
[25:59] "Sir, in this case, the latch is on the
[26:01] inside. The one that's on the inside has
[26:04] to open. He cannot open from the
[26:07] outside. He cannot save you against your
[26:09] will. He cannot heal you against your
[26:11] will. He cannot send a revival against
[26:13] your will. You've got to be willing and
[26:16] open the door and invite him in.
[26:19] Oh, praise God. What's so exciting about
[26:21] this is this is exactly what we want.
[26:24] Amen. That's
[26:25] right. Amen.
[26:26] In Philippians 2, I want to uh look at
[26:29] this scripture for a moment. It's
[26:31] interesting to me. Philippians 2:12
[26:33] says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have
[26:36] always obeyed, not as in my presence
[26:39] only, but now much more in my absence,
[26:41] work out your own salvation with fear
[26:43] and trembling.
[26:45] For it is God which workketh in you both
[26:47] to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[26:50] This is so interesting to me. Work out
[26:53] your own salvation with fear and
[26:54] trembling. That's like something that
[26:58] you need to do.
[27:00] For it is God which workketh in you both
[27:02] the will and do of his good pleasure.
[27:04] That's something he's doing.
[27:07] Is that right? We have to work out our
[27:09] own salvation with fear and trembling.
[27:11] We've got to come to God. We've got to
[27:13] wrestle this flesh into submission.
[27:14] We've got to go through our Gethsemane.
[27:16] We got to surrender everything to him.
[27:18] We got to receive God, receive the the
[27:21] life of God. And it's God now in us
[27:23] which workketh both the will and the do
[27:25] of his good pleasure. It's the work of
[27:27] God within us. But we've got to open the
[27:30] way.
[27:30] Amen.
[27:32] In the Patmas vision, brother says,
[27:33] "Thus when they were filled with the
[27:36] Holy Ghost, they ceased from their
[27:37] worldly works, their worldly doings,
[27:40] their evil ways. The Holy Ghost took
[27:41] charge of their lives. They entered into
[27:43] rest. There is your rest. That is your
[27:47] Sabbath. It is not a day nor a year, but
[27:49] the eternity of being filled with the
[27:51] filled and blessed in the Holy Spirit.
[27:54] It's you ceasing and God doing. It is
[27:56] God in you willing and doing of his good
[27:59] pleasure. But the Bible says labor to
[28:02] enter into that rest.
[28:04] Amen. But when you enter into that rest,
[28:06] it's not you doing. It's him doing
[28:08] because you open the channel to his will
[28:10] and say, "God, I don't want my way
[28:11] anymore. If I want my way, then I've got
[28:14] to perform my way. I've got to have some
[28:15] sort of strength or ability or stamina
[28:18] to do my will. But when I surrender my
[28:20] will to his will, then he comes in and
[28:22] works his will through me. And then now
[28:24] it's his energy, his stamina, his life
[28:26] because it's his will.
[28:28] And he will he will provide everything
[28:30] that's necessary to perform his will if
[28:33] we'll just will to do his will.
[28:36] Amen. Praise God.
[28:40] In the message of prisoner, he says,
[28:42] "Now we're all born a free moral agent
[28:44] to make any decision that we wish to.
[28:48] God justly does that because he must put
[28:50] every man on the same basis or he put
[28:52] the wrong man. He put the first man on
[28:54] the wrong basis that he put on free
[28:56] moral agency. See, we're just exactly
[29:00] tonight like Adam and Eve. There's no
[29:02] difference, right or wrong sets before
[29:04] either one of us. Life and death. We can
[29:06] make our choice up to you to make it.
[29:08] See, that's the way Adam and Eve did.
[29:11] And and see, and they made the wrong
[29:13] choice. And now by that put the whole
[29:16] race of human race under death, the
[29:18] penalty of death. And then God came down
[29:20] in the form of man and took that death
[29:23] and paid the penalty of death. That his
[29:26] subjects his subjects that desired to be
[29:29] free could go free. Now if he took us
[29:32] without the same way that he did Adam
[29:34] and Eve and just pulled us through
[29:35] something, said, "I'll save you whether
[29:37] you want to whether you want saved or
[29:39] not," then he put Adam and Eve on the
[29:41] wrong basis. You see? But each one of us
[29:44] has to choose this day between death and
[29:46] life, we can do it. As I just expressed,
[29:50] if your light, if your life will prove
[29:53] exactly what side you're on, I don't
[29:56] care what side you say you're on. What
[29:59] you do every day proves what you are.
[30:02] You've heard the old saying, your life
[30:03] is so loud, I can't hear your testimony.
[30:05] See, your actions is so loud. So,
[30:08] brother B is showing us here that we're
[30:10] put on the same basis of Adam and Eve
[30:12] and they were put on free moral agency.
[30:14] Amen. That they they knew what the will
[30:16] of God was because the they knew the
[30:17] word of God and now they had to give
[30:20] their will to do the will of God. And
[30:22] when they willed something else, they
[30:24] broke the harmony. They broke the unity.
[30:28] Amen. So, so God is showing us we're on
[30:30] the same basis. And when you look at it,
[30:33] we are on the same basis. Brother Rem
[30:36] says, 'You've come to the same place
[30:37] Adam and Eve come. And we'll get to this
[30:39] quote a little bit later. He said, 'You
[30:40] can't blame them now. And now it's on
[30:42] us. Now we have the opportunity to make
[30:44] our choice.
[30:46] And in the Garden of Eden, there were
[30:47] two trees. One was life and one was
[30:51] death.
[30:52] But in us are two natures.
[30:56] We've been born again. The nature of the
[30:59] outer man and the nature of God. And we
[31:02] have a will to determine which one we're
[31:04] going to let reign, which one we're
[31:06] going to let have their way. So, we've
[31:08] come to the same place. In heaven, they
[31:10] had a choice between two covering
[31:12] cherubs,
[31:13] Lucifer and Michael, which one they
[31:15] would listen to. Even the angels made a
[31:17] choice.
[31:18] Amen.
[31:18] Amen. In the garden, they make a choice.
[31:20] And now we're making a choice. And I
[31:23] want to stay with the word.
[31:27] In Deuteronomy 30:19, it says, "I call
[31:31] heaven and earth to record this day
[31:33] against you, that I have set before you
[31:36] life and death, blessing and cursing.
[31:38] Therefore, choose life that both thou
[31:41] and thy seed may live." Here, when they
[31:43] come in the Exodus journey, they're
[31:45] going to come to the promised land. He
[31:46] says, "I've set here's my word. I've set
[31:49] before you life and death. Now you
[31:51] choose." He didn't force them to keep
[31:54] their word. And how do we know he didn't
[31:55] force them? because they kept leaving
[31:57] his word. They kept falling into chaos.
[31:59] It wasn't a forced thing. It was an
[32:01] invitation to come. Come come into the
[32:03] land and live a clean life. Come into
[32:05] the land. Live a holy life. Live a
[32:07] separated life. And I will bless you and
[32:09] you will you won't need you won't need
[32:11] walls around your cities. I will be
[32:13] everything to you if you'll just submit
[32:16] your will to my will.
[32:19] But we watched Israel fail in that again
[32:21] and again and again and again. Amen. But
[32:24] he he set before them the choice and
[32:25] they made the choice.
[32:28] And in Joshua
[32:31] 24, he says, "And if it seemed evil unto
[32:33] you to serve the Lord, choose you this
[32:35] day whom you will serve, whether the
[32:37] gods which your fathers served that were
[32:39] on the other side of the flood or the
[32:40] gods of the Amorites in whose land you
[32:42] dwell. But as for me in my house, we
[32:45] will serve the Lord." Joshua made his
[32:47] choice. Amen. Now, now uh uh uh Moses is
[32:52] gone and Joshua is now talking to the
[32:54] people and once again he brings them
[32:56] back to this choice. Hey, you know this
[32:58] message is a choice.
[33:01] Amen. Everything that the prophet taught
[33:03] us is a choice because God's never
[33:05] stripped away free moral agency. Amen.
[33:07] We can live any way you want. Amen. You
[33:09] can you can do anything you want. You
[33:11] can go out tonight and you can leave
[33:12] this sanctuary and you can drive
[33:14] anywhere you want to. You can go home
[33:16] and go to bed and get up early and go to
[33:17] work. You can drive to any place and he
[33:19] establishes them at the o open and buy
[33:22] anything. You can do whatever you want.
[33:24] God has not limited us in that way
[33:28] because God wants a people that will
[33:30] that'll that'll want his will above
[33:32] everything else. And he doesn't do it by
[33:34] force or coercion. He does it by free
[33:36] moral agency because that's what God's
[33:38] looking for. He loved us. He's looking
[33:40] for somebody to love him back.
[33:43] And that's the opportunity we have with
[33:44] every choice that we make. We have the
[33:46] opportunity to love him back. We have
[33:48] the opportunity to open the channel for
[33:50] him to come in and work his will in our
[33:52] lives.
[33:54] And I thank God for it.
[33:56] I thank God. And there's many hard
[33:58] things that we have to face in life. And
[34:00] sometimes we come to hard decisions that
[34:02] we have to face. Some things that really
[34:04] cost us or hurt us or or are or
[34:06] different times in life that we really
[34:08] make a cha the choice the choice we make
[34:11] we know has repercussions. There's many
[34:13] times in life we make a choice and when
[34:15] we first come to the message that was a
[34:17] choice and that choice had
[34:19] repercussions. It brought separation. It
[34:21] brought rejection. It brought many
[34:23] things. Amen. But we were glad to give
[34:25] our will to his will and make that
[34:27] choice to surrender everything for him.
[34:29] And it's been a blessing.
[34:32] Amen.
[34:33] And when we come to these choices now,
[34:35] what happens is the outer man starts
[34:37] fighting back.
[34:38] Yes.
[34:40] He starts fighting back. Amen. But
[34:42] there's something on the inside. There's
[34:44] something down deep. There's something
[34:46] that's not our brains. Amen. There's
[34:48] something beyond that. And it's that
[34:50] little seed of life
[34:52] down on the inside. And it's responding
[34:55] to something. And it and it and it's
[34:58] responding to the will of God. It's
[34:59] responding to the word of God. But the
[35:01] outside man goes into chaos whenever we
[35:03] come to these junctions in life. Amen.
[35:05] Jesus was a perfect born man. Amen. He
[35:08] was born without sin, without flaw.
[35:10] Virgin born. and he comes to this Y in
[35:12] the road and he's agonizing over the
[35:14] decision he's got to make because
[35:16] there's a part of him that wants to stay
[35:18] with the ones that he loves that wants
[35:19] to stay as a man and fellowship with the
[35:22] with his disciples. But there's just
[35:24] something else in him that's moving him
[35:26] to go on to give himself as a sacrifice
[35:28] to redeem lost man. And he has to
[35:32] surrender this will to this will.
[35:35] Amen. We come to places like that and it
[35:37] may not have the consequences that it
[35:39] had there in that day in Gethsemane, but
[35:41] we come to places where we've got to
[35:43] make decisions. Amen. And God sometimes
[35:45] God doesn't make it easy.
[35:49] I'd say many times he doesn't make it
[35:51] easy.
[35:52] And the war goes on inside and our mind
[35:55] starts in this. And and and whenever you
[35:58] come across something like this, if it's
[36:00] a trial or a hard decision or something
[36:02] you have to do, h a decision you have to
[36:04] make for the word that you know has got
[36:06] repercussions.
[36:08] Our mind, our human mind is always at
[36:11] all cost trying to avoid pain.
[36:15] First response, avoid pain.
[36:18] So I that's why you can't trust your
[36:21] mind and you can't trust your emotional
[36:23] realm. You can't trust the outer man
[36:25] because the first thing that outer man
[36:27] wants to do is avoid any kind of pain.
[36:30] If this is going to hurt then then the
[36:32] outer man says no all right off the top.
[36:34] No way.
[36:37] Is that right?
[36:38] That's that's why it's so hard to get
[36:41] the outer man to exercise when he needs
[36:43] to exercise to eat right when he needs
[36:45] to eat right. Amen. If it's going to
[36:47] cause any kind of discomfort or pain,
[36:50] the outer man says, "No way, Jose."
[36:54] Is that right? Do we all live in flesh
[36:56] or do we not live in flesh?
[36:59] So, so the first thing we always face is
[37:03] this avoidance.
[37:05] No, avoid anything that's painful.
[37:08] Amen. And second thing we do is our
[37:12] brains are so good at deceiving
[37:14] ourselves and we try we try to ignore
[37:19] the situation or find some excuse for
[37:22] why it's not relevant. We don't have to
[37:24] make a decision. It's amazing the the
[37:26] the games your mind will play with you.
[37:30] Even brother Brandham was dealing with
[37:32] this and standing in the gap. and
[37:34] standing in the gap, he was dealing with
[37:35] this hurtful situation where he was hurt
[37:38] by the rejection of the people and he
[37:40] was wanting to run up to northern
[37:41] British Columbia and get away from the
[37:43] pain. And he this this this mind battle
[37:46] started this this game in his mind where
[37:48] he started coming up with religious
[37:50] reasons for why he was a prophet. And
[37:52] prophets don't mingle with the people,
[37:53] but the prophets are out by themselves.
[37:55] They get a word of the Lord and they
[37:57] stomp back in. And that's just what I'll
[37:58] do. I'll go up there and help Bud
[38:00] Safway. And when God speaks to me, I'll
[38:02] march down and deliver the message and
[38:03] I'll go right back. And then, Brother
[38:05] Brandham, when God starts to expose that
[38:07] in him, he gets real for a minute and he
[38:09] says, "Now, I said that, but really I
[38:12] wanted to hunter fish for my own good.
[38:17] His his own treacherous heart
[38:21] wanted to avoid pain and knew that the
[38:24] outer man loved to hunt and fish. So the
[38:27] so the the the mind worked out a deal.
[38:33] Hey, listen. We are not If the prophet
[38:35] wasn't exempt from this, there's no way
[38:37] in the world we're exempt from this. And
[38:38] the mind's always working on a deal. Now
[38:40] listen, you know, you just you just need
[38:42] some time alone with God. Don't go back
[38:44] to fellowship. That's where all the pain
[38:46] is.
[38:49] Don't go make that decision. You know
[38:51] they'll reject you. Don't go say that to
[38:53] your co-workers. You know you're going
[38:54] to have all this. you just need to do
[38:56] this that or the other and always avoids
[38:59] pain and then starts this mental game
[39:01] and will even oh my goodness I I the the
[39:04] the devil brother Beam said the devil
[39:06] cannot read your mind but he can put
[39:08] thoughts in your mind
[39:10] and all of a sudden you get all these
[39:12] religious reasons and using religion as
[39:14] a cloak for actually what's going on in
[39:17] your treacherous heart.
[39:20] Brother Brandham was been given he was
[39:23] be given a cloak a religious cloak for
[39:25] what really he wanted to get away from
[39:28] the pain and run away from the thing
[39:29] that was hurtful and the rejection and
[39:31] he wanted to go hunting fish
[39:35] and God just come down and started
[39:37] working on him
[39:39] and he admitted it all and exposed it
[39:41] all and surrendered himself to the will
[39:43] of God and went right back with what
[39:45] God's will and God blessed him for it
[39:48] and blessed us for it.
[39:51] And so our our human side will always
[39:52] try to avoid pain and all of a sudden
[39:54] there's this avoidance of pain and then
[39:56] there's all and when we when we when we
[39:58] know we've got to face it, all of a
[39:59] sudden we start coming up with all these
[40:01] excuses either to delay it or or or some
[40:04] religious reason for doing it our own
[40:06] way. Amen. But I I want to come back to
[40:09] where Jesus was in Gethsemane. Father,
[40:12] if this is your will, if this is your
[40:13] word, then so be it unto me.
[40:16] Amen.
[40:18] I've found in myself
[40:21] that the greatest amount of suffering
[40:23] I've ever suffered in any trial has been
[40:26] the suffering in my mind trying to avoid
[40:29] the trial.
[40:34] The mental anguish and battle, wrestling
[40:36] this out, finding another way, trying
[40:39] not to. But really, when I just resolve
[40:41] myself to this is the way it is and you
[40:42] just start walking forward in it,
[40:44] embrace it as what God has for you, it's
[40:46] amazing how much easier it is to do
[40:48] anything God wills you to do when your
[40:51] will matches his will.
[40:54] And it's amazing how complicated life is
[40:56] when you get these things disjointed.
[41:00] I say, God, if this is what you want for
[41:02] me, this is what I want for me, too.
[41:05] and then allow God, amen, to work
[41:08] through the channel that's open to him.
[41:11] So, we just we just heard this past last
[41:16] quote.
[41:18] The life your life will prove exactly
[41:21] what side you're on. I don't care what
[41:23] side you say you're on. What you do
[41:24] every day proves what you are. Then we
[41:27] come to this quote in Satan's Eden. And
[41:28] he says, "Satan has succeeded in
[41:30] perverting and taking over this world
[41:32] and making it his kingdom." That man was
[41:36] put on by free moral agency to choose
[41:38] for themselves what kind of life they
[41:40] desired. And that shows what's in your
[41:43] heart.
[41:45] See, you know what? Your actions speak
[41:47] so loud it drowns your voice. Let me go
[41:49] to a man and say, I we're uh we're all
[41:52] Christians. We belong to church. And
[41:54] strip teases hanging all over his
[41:55] office. It would make no difference what
[41:58] he told me. I would know better. So
[42:00] would you. Let a woman say she's a
[42:02] Christian with short hair. You know
[42:04] better than that. See? Yes, sir. Let her
[42:06] say she's a Christian wearing paint and
[42:08] makeup and shorts and say she's a
[42:09] Christian. You know better than that.
[42:11] The word of God teaches you better than
[42:13] that. The word says she can't do it and
[42:15] be a Christian. She's she is even
[42:17] dishonorable in everything. How is God
[42:19] going to put a dishonorable thing in his
[42:21] kingdom? No sir. Not at all. No sir.
[42:24] theirelves. They show their desire.
[42:27] Amen. And and that's what Cain did. Cain
[42:31] showed his desire. Showed the desire
[42:33] that was in his heart. Because even when
[42:35] he was given an opportunity, Amen. He
[42:37] couldn't take the opportunity God gave
[42:38] him just to do as his brother did. Amen.
[42:40] It it his choice showed what was in his
[42:42] heart. His choice for sacrifice showed
[42:45] what was in his heart. Abel's choice
[42:47] showed what was in his heart.
[42:48] And what was in Abel's heart? a
[42:50] revelation from God
[42:52] and a will to obey his will. So when I
[42:56] read this quote, I read where it said
[43:00] that the life you live daily shows what
[43:02] you are and your actions prove and all
[43:05] of these things. And then I got to
[43:06] thinking, but what about my mistakes?
[43:10] Because just as soon as I start going
[43:12] down that line where brother says, your
[43:14] actions prove what you are, what you
[43:15] show, but but sometimes I have the wrong
[43:18] actions.
[43:20] Sometimes I don't always get it right. I
[43:22] I I do things that are wrong. I do
[43:24] things that I shouldn't have done. I do
[43:26] things that I'm ashamed of doing. I do
[43:28] things that aren't according to the
[43:29] word. And and I have to repent and I
[43:31] have to make it right. And so I wanted
[43:33] to address that while we're here on this
[43:35] because the life we live shows what's in
[43:37] our heart
[43:38] without a doubt.
[43:40] What we do shows what desires on the
[43:42] inside what we're living for. But
[43:44] there's but we don't live a perfect
[43:46] life. So I just want to address that for
[43:48] a minute. And oneness, brother BM says,
[43:51] we know we make mistakes, but you
[43:54] mustn't look at that. It's not your
[43:55] mistakes because you're always going to
[43:57] have them. But you see, it's following
[43:59] his rules, following what he said, do
[44:02] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[44:04] thing to do with it. A real true
[44:06] servant, if he'll stumble, he'll get up
[44:09] again. If he wobbles, God pulls him
[44:11] right back in the path as long as he's
[44:13] in the path of duty. But if he's off the
[44:16] path of duty, God's not obligated to
[44:18] him. But as long as he's in the path of
[44:21] duty, God's obligated to him, knowing
[44:23] that he's just a man or a woman.
[44:28] You can will to do the will of God. You
[44:30] can open that channel. You can have a
[44:32] desire and your life can be showing what
[44:34] your desire is. And you can still make a
[44:36] mistake off the word wrong, completely
[44:38] wrong. Amen. But God's not looking at
[44:40] that one thing. He's looking at what the
[44:42] desire is in your heart and what you're
[44:44] attempting to do.
[44:46] Brother Brandham shows us we we've got
[44:48] so many examples through the life of a
[44:50] prophet that help us in our life. Now,
[44:53] and in the message total deliverance, he
[44:55] starts telling the story of of when he
[44:57] lies to the lawyer. You remember that?
[45:00] And brother Bam lies to the lawyer. What
[45:03] kind of life was he living?
[45:06] Where was his will? I believe he had a
[45:08] will to do the will of God. I believe
[45:10] with all my heart and God was working
[45:12] through me. He was a channel that God
[45:13] could work through. But he was just a
[45:15] man. He was a human being prone to
[45:18] failures like you and I are human beings
[45:20] prone to failures. And listen, the
[45:22] mistakes that we make, the real mistakes
[45:24] that we make, it doesn't determine what
[45:26] we are. What what what happens after the
[45:29] mistake determines what we are
[45:32] in total deliverance. Brother Beam tells
[45:34] this story like this.
[45:38] Uh he said
[45:43] he said he was talking to the
[45:44] congregation about that he lied and he
[45:46] said I caused my wife to lie and I
[45:49] believe I told you about it here at the
[45:50] church. It happened about 6 weeks ago. I
[45:53] said I couldn't stand another evening.
[45:56] Uh uh oh no I'm sorry. He said first the
[46:01] phone rang. It was a private number
[46:02] phone uh phone number rang and me went
[46:04] to answer the phone. She put her hand
[46:06] over it and said, "It's them attorneys
[46:08] again." And I said, "I couldn't stand
[46:10] another evening. My head feels like it's
[46:12] going off. I'm losing my mind just
[46:15] pulling me this way and that way and
[46:16] this." I said, "I can't stand it." And I
[46:18] jumped up and I said, "Tell them I'm not
[46:20] here." And I run around behind the
[46:22] house. When I come back, meet me is very
[46:26] conscientious of those things. She met
[46:28] me at the door half crying. She said,
[46:30] "Bill, was that the right thing to do?
[46:34] You know, you know how you are. This is
[46:35] brother Ram saying, "You know how you
[46:37] are." He said, "I know how I am."
[46:40] I said, "Sure." I wasn't in here right
[46:42] then. And this is the statement that got
[46:44] me. I knew God had condemned me for it.
[46:48] He knew he was wrong. He knew he had
[46:51] done wrong. When his wife said that,
[46:52] "Hey, listen. I don't know how many
[46:54] times my wife or one of my kids or
[46:55] somebody else says just ask a question
[46:57] and I know immediately I'm dead wrong."
[47:00] But I'll say whatever, you know, comes
[47:01] to my no whatever. I got to go. Bye.
[47:05] Amen. Cuz we're human beings. Amen. And
[47:08] now, Brother Benham, he wants it to be
[47:10] okay. But already there's something down
[47:12] inside that he knows that he's wrong.
[47:14] But it's all this on the outside, all
[47:16] this in the mind and all this in the
[47:18] emotional realm that's keeping that
[47:19] little voice quiet, making do that it's
[47:21] okay.
[47:23] And I knew God had condemned me for it.
[47:26] I said, I and I said, I wasn't in here
[47:28] right then. She said, "But you wasn't
[47:30] here when he made the call." That
[47:33] afternoon, I went to pray for a sick
[47:35] baby, and before I left the house, the
[47:37] phone rang again, and little Joseph run
[47:39] over and took a hold of the phone and
[47:40] said, "Daddy, you want me to tell him
[47:42] that you're not here?"
[47:47] You see how sin corrupts? What a family
[47:50] that would finally be. What a family
[47:52] that would finally be. He says first
[47:55] John the 5th chapter 21st verse said if
[47:57] our hearts condemn us not then we have
[47:59] confidence in God but if our hearts
[48:01] condemn us how we can how can we have
[48:03] confidence in God we know as long as we
[48:05] got sin that's not confessed he'll never
[48:08] hear us that's strong but it's the
[48:11] church needs these things then I started
[48:14] to pray for this baby and I went and I
[48:16] started to lay my hands on him and the
[48:17] Lord rebuked me and said you told a lie
[48:20] and you ain't fit to pray for that baby.
[48:23] And brother tells us, he runs from
[48:25] there. He tells the man what happened
[48:27] and he runs and he apologized to the
[48:28] attorney, apologized to his wife. Amen.
[48:30] He goes out to to to try to go to the
[48:33] woods to pray to make it right with God
[48:35] and to repent. And then he makes this
[48:37] statement a little bit later. He says in
[48:39] his prayer to God, he said, "I didn't
[48:41] mean to do that. My head just felt like
[48:43] it was coming off. I was so nervous and
[48:46] I'd done it in a catch of a moment when
[48:48] Satan caught me. I said, 'If you'd
[48:51] forgive me, let me see you then, Lord.
[48:53] And God brought him the token evidence
[48:55] of his forgiveness. And the brother
[48:57] Benham was blessed. But you see what
[48:59] happened? Brother Benham said, "I was
[49:01] nervous and I done it in a catch of a
[49:04] moment when Satan caught me.
[49:06] I'm so glad he told us these things
[49:10] because I've been caught in a catch of a
[49:11] moment before. I've been caught all
[49:14] nervous and tied up in my mind and say
[49:16] something, don't even know why you said
[49:17] it or do something, don't even know why
[49:18] you do it. And you react to a situation.
[49:20] Amen. And and almost always it's this
[49:23] old outer man trying to save itself.
[49:26] Save itself from suffering. Save itself
[49:28] from whatever. Amen. It's usually this
[49:30] old outer man trying to save itself.
[49:32] Amen. And that's what brother Brandon
[49:34] was going through. Amen. But but the
[49:36] thing that got me is he knew that he was
[49:39] condemned when his wife asked him the
[49:40] question, but he tried to go on. But
[49:42] when God spoke to him and brought it to
[49:44] his face, amen, that man wasn't dodging
[49:46] it anymore. When God brought it right to
[49:48] his face, amen, he repented. Amen.
[49:51] That's a son of God. That's a man who
[49:53] will lay down his will for God's will.
[49:55] It doesn't mean you won't ever make a
[49:57] mistake and you and I won't ever get
[49:58] things wrong and we won't get caught in
[50:00] a catch of a moment and we won't have
[50:02] all the same things that other human
[50:03] beings have. But when God brings it to
[50:05] our face, there's something inside of us
[50:07] says, "God, I'm sorry.
[50:10] I'm sorry, God." And we'll we'll we will
[50:12] bring our will subject to his will.
[50:16] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. So
[50:19] thankful God has people on the earth
[50:21] today that will do that. Amen. So it's
[50:25] not just making a mistake. You remember
[50:28] uh I read here just a few weeks ago the
[50:30] interview of Sister Bruce.
[50:33] I pulled it up. Sister Bruce was
[50:35] struggling because of her mistakes. And
[50:37] she said, Sister Bruce says, "I make so
[50:40] many mistakes and I fail so many times."
[50:44] Does anybody ever felt, don't raise your
[50:45] hand, but anybody feel that way?
[50:48] Amen. And this is this is brother Bram's
[50:51] answer to her. That's why Christ had to
[50:54] die so that you with your mistakes
[50:57] wouldn't be lauded to you. See, he took
[51:00] your mistakes. Your desire in your heart
[51:02] is to serve him. And sister Bruce says,
[51:05] "Yes."
[51:07] All right. That's what he died for so
[51:09] you could serve him. See, not your
[51:11] mistakes are not looked not lauded to
[51:13] you. He's your propitiation. He's your
[51:16] sin offering. Your sins are not known.
[51:18] You're not a sinner before God. Christ
[51:21] took your sins and became you because
[51:23] your desire is to serve him.
[51:26] Is your desire to serve him?
[51:28] Is your desire to lay your will down for
[51:30] his will? Amen. You don't get it 100%. I
[51:33] don't get it 100% but nothing changes
[51:36] that desire. Sometimes I get tripped up
[51:38] in a nervous condition when I get all
[51:40] stumbled around. But that never changes
[51:42] what's in the depths of my soul. I want
[51:44] God's way to be my way every day of my
[51:46] life. I want him to have his way in me.
[51:48] I don't want to fail. I don't want to
[51:50] make mistakes. I don't want to make the
[51:52] wrong decision. I don't want to go the
[51:53] wrong way. I don't want to bring a
[51:55] reproach against his name. But I do all
[51:57] of that. Yes, sir.
[51:59] But that's the reason he died because he
[52:00] knows we're just human beings.
[52:04] So, we got to quit looking at every
[52:06] failure and start looking at what's the
[52:08] desire of our life and what are we
[52:10] living for. Amen. And say, God, if I got
[52:12] off the trail, bring me back on the
[52:14] trail. If I made a mistake, bring me
[52:16] back, God. Bring it to my face. Speak to
[52:18] my heart, Lord, that I can repent and
[52:20] lay this will down for your will.
[52:23] That's what we want, friends. It's what
[52:26] I want.
[52:28] Amen.
[52:30] I want to look at I want to look at
[52:32] another mistake that was made in the
[52:34] Bible. I want to look at David
[52:38] in Acts 13 22. Uh
[52:43] it says, "And when he had removed him,
[52:45] he raised up unto them David to be their
[52:47] king, to whom also he gave testimony. He
[52:49] said, I have found David, the son of
[52:51] Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which
[52:54] shall fulfill all my will."
[52:56] This is God's description of David.
[53:00] David is a man after my own heart, which
[53:03] shall fulfill all my will.
[53:06] But David didn't always get it right.
[53:12] But God saw him as a man after his own
[53:14] heart, which shall fulfill all my will.
[53:17] God wasn't looking at the part that that
[53:19] committed adultery. He was looking at
[53:22] something else inside.
[53:24] Amen. God was going to make an atonement
[53:26] for that. But he was looking at a son.
[53:28] Amen. He was looking at a man after his
[53:30] own heart which shall fulfill all his
[53:31] will. And God knew when he chose him
[53:33] that he would have mistakes.
[53:36] Here's one that I find interesting. In 1
[53:39] Chronicles 21, it says, "And Satan stood
[53:41] up against Israel and provoked David to
[53:43] number Israel."
[53:45] But in 2 Samuel 26 it says, "And again
[53:48] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[53:49] against Israel and he moved David
[53:52] against him to say go number Israel and
[53:54] Judah." Now it was forbidden for them to
[53:56] take a census of the soldiers. God says,
[53:58] "I'm your portion. I'm enough for you. I
[54:01] will always fight for you and give you
[54:02] enough. You're not there to go take and
[54:04] count numbers." And and even uh even
[54:08] Joab, the captain of the host, when he
[54:10] sent to do it, rebuked him and said,
[54:12] "Don't do that." But he did it anyways.
[54:14] And we know that God moved him to do it.
[54:16] How did God move him to do it? Satan
[54:18] stood up against Israel and provoked
[54:20] David. This was a temptation from the
[54:22] devil that God allowed.
[54:24] And he did so because the anger of the
[54:26] Lord was kindled against Israel. He
[54:28] wasn't mad at David. He was mad at
[54:30] Israel. But David was the king of
[54:32] Israel. So God allowed this temptation
[54:34] to come and God worked it out. And David
[54:38] fell. David did something contrary to
[54:41] the will of God. to the word of God.
[54:43] Amen. He went and numbered the people.
[54:47] And as soon as he did, as soon as Joab
[54:50] come back,
[54:52] this is amazing to me. As soon as he got
[54:56] the count of all the people, his heart
[54:58] smoteed him and he knew he'd done wrong.
[55:01] I think that's so amazing because
[55:03] there's so many times that we get in
[55:05] some sort of fog. Sometimes we don't
[55:06] even understand it. You look back and
[55:08] say, "I don't know how I thought that
[55:10] was a good idea. I don't know how I did
[55:12] that. I don't know how I made that
[55:14] decision. I don't know why I did that or
[55:16] fell that way. Looking at it now, I
[55:18] think this is ridiculous. I don't know
[55:20] how I got in that fog and I did that
[55:22] thing. But sometimes when the when
[55:24] whatever we chased after and whatever we
[55:26] did and whatever decision we made, the
[55:29] moment that the fruition of that of our
[55:31] decision comes about, our heart smites
[55:32] us and we know that we're wrong.
[55:35] And that's what happened to David in in
[55:37] 2 Samuel 24:10. And David's heart smote
[55:41] him after thee had numbered the people.
[55:43] And David said unto the Lord, I have
[55:45] sinned greatly and that I have done. And
[55:47] now I beseech thee, oh Lord, take away
[55:49] the iniquity of thy servant, for I have
[55:51] done very foolishly. For when David was
[55:54] up in the morning, the word of the Lord
[55:56] came unto the prophet Gad, David seer,
[55:58] saying, Go and say unto David, thus
[56:00] sayeth the Lord, I offer thee three
[56:02] things. Choose choose thee one of them
[56:05] that I may do it unto thee.
[56:08] David all of a sudden when the deed is
[56:11] done
[56:12] all of a sudden the realization of what
[56:14] he did comes to him
[56:16] and his heart smoteed him and he
[56:18] immediately repent. See this is a child
[56:21] of God.
[56:22] Not that you'll never go go wrong. Not
[56:24] that you'll never get under a fog of
[56:26] confusion. Not that you'll never make a
[56:27] mistake. But but when when the
[56:30] realization of what you've done comes to
[56:31] you there's something else that kicks in
[56:33] and say God I have done wrong. Please
[56:35] forgive me.
[56:37] and he still has to go. Israel has to go
[56:39] through the punishment. He gives him one
[56:40] of three choices and he just chooses to
[56:42] fall into the hands of God and nobody
[56:44] else. A plague comes out a pestilence
[56:47] begins to smite them. And when the angel
[56:49] when the when when the plaguing angel
[56:52] comes to Jerusalem, this is what it
[56:54] says. David sees this angel.
[56:57] And David spake unto the Lord when he
[56:59] saw the angel that smokeote the people
[57:00] and said, "Lo, I have sinned and I have
[57:04] done wickedly, but these sheep, what
[57:06] have they done? Let thine hand, I pray
[57:08] thee, be against me and against my
[57:10] father's house."
[57:12] When he sees this angel coming, all of a
[57:14] sudden, he says, "Oh God,
[57:18] this is my mistake, not theirs. Don't
[57:21] make them suffer." He stands in the gap.
[57:23] What to me what's beautiful about this
[57:25] is he doesn't make excuses. He doesn't
[57:28] excuse himself. He doesn't excuse his
[57:31] conduct. He doesn't pass it off on
[57:33] anybody else. And he doesn't share the
[57:34] blame with one other soul.
[57:38] Hey, listen. I don't care how many
[57:39] people went wrong whenever whatever we
[57:42] did that was wrong. Amen. It doesn't do
[57:44] any good to start mentioning all the
[57:46] names. Well, me and Billy Bob and Susie
[57:48] Q and all these other people. I mean, if
[57:50] it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have
[57:52] Amen.
[57:53] Amen. But a son of God comes back to the
[57:55] fact and says, "I was wrong. I got out
[57:58] of the will of God. It's me and it's
[58:00] only me."
[58:02] Because really, that's the only
[58:04] relationship that matters. We got to
[58:06] come back in continuity with God. And to
[58:09] come back in continuity with God, we
[58:11] have to surrender our personal will to
[58:13] his will. Not collectively, but
[58:15] individually.
[58:17] We must will to do his will. And so I
[58:20] love this story in David because David
[58:22] shows us both sides. He shows us the
[58:24] man's side and he shows us the son of
[58:26] God side. And we've lived in both sides,
[58:29] friends. But I want to come to the one
[58:32] where God can wake me up to what I'm
[58:34] doing and open my eyes and speak to my
[58:36] heart and my heart says, "Yes, Lord.
[58:40] I don't want to keep hiding."
[58:43] In the breach, he says this. Now of
[58:46] course when Adam fell to death he
[58:49] brought death upon all creation. Now he
[58:51] was given free moral agency. It was
[58:53] given to them just uh so to make a
[58:57] choice. Now Adam and Eve in the
[58:59] beginning there was a tree of right and
[59:00] wrong before them. And that same tree
[59:02] sets before each and every one of us.
[59:05] See God isn't doing for Adam or for Eve.
[59:07] You say well it's their fault. No not
[59:10] now it's your fault. You can't place it
[59:13] on Adam now. You got to place it on
[59:15] yourself because right and wrong set
[59:17] before you. We're on the same basis as
[59:19] Adam and Eve. But you see, when we are
[59:21] redeemed, we no more want our own
[59:24] choice, but we want his choice.
[59:27] That's what we want. Amen. We may not
[59:29] always get it right, but when we're
[59:30] redeemed, that's what we want. We don't
[59:32] want our choice anymore. We want his
[59:34] choice.
[59:35] But he still sets the choice before us.
[59:38] We're tested all the time.
[59:41] I want to read this together out of
[59:43] first kings.
[59:45] It's the life of Elijah. And we know it
[59:47] really well, but I want to read it
[59:49] together. And he came thither unto a
[59:52] cave and lodged there. And behold, the
[59:54] word of the Lord came to him.
[59:56] And he said unto him, "What doest thou
[59:58] hear, Elijah?" And he said, "I have been
[1:00:01] very jealous for the Lord God of host.
[1:00:03] For the children of Israel for have
[1:00:06] forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
[1:00:08] altar, slain thy prophets with the
[1:00:10] sword, and I, even I only am left, and
[1:00:13] they seek my life to take it away." And
[1:00:16] he said, "Go forth and stand upon the
[1:00:17] mount before the Lord." And he beheld,
[1:00:19] and behold, the Lord passed by, and a
[1:00:23] great strong wind the mountains, and
[1:00:26] break in pieces the rocks before the
[1:00:28] Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind.
[1:00:31] And after the wind, an earthquake, but
[1:00:33] the Lord was not in the earthquake. And
[1:00:36] after the earthquake, a fire, but the
[1:00:38] Lord was not in the fire. And after the
[1:00:41] fire, a still small voice. And it was so
[1:00:44] when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his
[1:00:46] face in his mantle, and went out and
[1:00:48] stood in the entering into the cave. And
[1:00:51] behold, there came a voice unto him, and
[1:00:53] said, "What doest thou here, Elijah?"
[1:00:57] I love this story. Brother Beam talks
[1:00:58] about it and and we've we've talked
[1:01:00] about it and we know we know it but I
[1:01:03] want to I want to look at it in relation
[1:01:05] to what we're talking about. Brother B
[1:01:08] says an influence one time the Bible we
[1:01:11] have example of that there was a prophet
[1:01:13] went back in the cave Elijah and God was
[1:01:16] trying to attract his attention to come
[1:01:18] out
[1:01:19] and there come the fire and smoke and
[1:01:23] blusterous winds across the mountains
[1:01:24] and thunder and earthquakes and shakes
[1:01:26] and everything else. The prophet never
[1:01:28] even moved. God wasn't even in it. But
[1:01:32] when that still small voice spoke, he
[1:01:34] covered his face and came forward. When
[1:01:36] the still small voice of God's word
[1:01:38] speaks, not a racket, not our big
[1:01:41] denominations, not our big something,
[1:01:43] but that still small voice of the word
[1:01:46] that's looked over. That should call a
[1:01:48] man to repentance. God in his word.
[1:01:53] Amen. It wasn't
[1:01:57] the great big thing that got Elijah's
[1:01:59] attention.
[1:02:01] It wasn't the busting apart of the rocks
[1:02:04] on the mountain. It wasn't the wind that
[1:02:06] was sharing everything, the fire and the
[1:02:08] earthquake.
[1:02:09] Brother Brenham said God wasn't in it.
[1:02:12] But it was that still small voice that
[1:02:14] got his attention. When he heard the
[1:02:16] still small voice, brother Brennham
[1:02:18] relates that to the word. when he heard
[1:02:20] the word because the word was the voice
[1:02:21] of God. He wrapped his face in a mantle
[1:02:23] in humility. And in humility, he came,
[1:02:26] amen, to face God because he was a
[1:02:28] runaway prophet, hiding from his
[1:02:30] commission because of the threats on his
[1:02:32] life and because of the rejection and
[1:02:34] because of what he faced.
[1:02:36] And God is wanting to get his attention.
[1:02:39] But brother Re said none of those things
[1:02:40] did it. God wasn't in all of that.
[1:02:44] And listen, there is so much noise in
[1:02:47] the world.
[1:02:48] This is a noisy world.
[1:02:50] And everything in this world is
[1:02:52] screaming for your attention.
[1:02:56] I mean, every media outlet, all the
[1:02:59] people, the associations and the people
[1:03:01] at work and everybody, even family
[1:03:03] members, and everybody is screaming for
[1:03:06] attention. There's so much voice, so
[1:03:08] much noise. There's very little quiet.
[1:03:11] Sometimes the the I don't know I don't
[1:03:14] know what it is but the my favorite
[1:03:16] times are when I'm by myself and it's
[1:03:18] quiet.
[1:03:19] You know some people they can't stand
[1:03:21] quiet. Whenever they're by themselves
[1:03:22] they got to turn on the radio. Got to
[1:03:24] turn on music. They got to turn on
[1:03:25] something. They can't take the quiet.
[1:03:26] Oh, but I'm getting to a place in life
[1:03:28] where I I crave the quiet and get away
[1:03:31] from all the noise because God wasn't in
[1:03:33] the noise. God wasn't in the big. God
[1:03:35] wasn't in the loud. God was in the still
[1:03:37] small voice of his word.
[1:03:40] Amen. and everything that's going to
[1:03:42] take you away from the will of God is
[1:03:44] noisy.
[1:03:46] All the things that are distracting and
[1:03:48] all the things that are contrary to the
[1:03:50] word of God, they're screaming for
[1:03:52] attention. They're demanding attention.
[1:03:54] They're vying for your time and
[1:03:55] attention. But God, Amen. God is so
[1:03:58] humble and God is not demanding your
[1:04:00] attention. He's not screaming for your
[1:04:02] attention. He's not vying for attention.
[1:04:04] He's not jockeying with any other loud
[1:04:06] voice for attention. God will just wait
[1:04:09] patiently and whisper to you quietly
[1:04:11] until you finally come to yourself in
[1:04:13] the word.
[1:04:15] God's not jumping up and down in the
[1:04:16] corner trying to get attention. God's
[1:04:18] put us on free moral agency. He's got
[1:04:20] his word, but some many times the word
[1:04:22] is the still small voice. It's
[1:04:24] everything else that's wrong in the
[1:04:26] world that's screaming all the time.
[1:04:30] And we miss it so easy.
[1:04:34] We we hear the noise and we chase after
[1:04:36] noise and everybody's got an opinion and
[1:04:39] everybody's got an idea. Amen. And and
[1:04:42] and oh my goodness, if you have anything
[1:04:45] that ever goes wrong in your life,
[1:04:47] whether it be your car needs repaired or
[1:04:49] something wrong in your body, you can
[1:04:51] watch YouTube videos night and day
[1:04:54] around the clock to figure out how to
[1:04:55] fix your car or how to fix your body and
[1:04:57] they all tell you something different.
[1:05:01] Noise, noise, noise, noise, noise. Amen.
[1:05:04] Everybody wants to be an expert.
[1:05:06] Everybody wants to give advice.
[1:05:08] Everybody wants to tell you how to do
[1:05:09] everything in life. Amen. But God is
[1:05:12] just sitting in the corner.
[1:05:13] Amen.
[1:05:15] Just not jumping, not shouting, not
[1:05:18] waving his hands, just there constantly
[1:05:22] just speaking his word.
[1:05:25] It's not the loudest thing you ever
[1:05:26] hear. It's not the most demanding thing
[1:05:28] you ever hear. It's just that still
[1:05:31] small voice, that constant calling to
[1:05:34] our souls.
[1:05:37] Everything else wants to fill our mind
[1:05:38] and our eyes and our ears, but he's
[1:05:41] speaking to our souls.
[1:05:45] Brother BM tells us in the in the story
[1:05:48] where he's in Colorado when the storm is
[1:05:50] rolling in and he says, "So then I
[1:05:54] started down, you know, the blizzard's
[1:05:55] coming. He told everybody to go. I got
[1:05:58] about halfway down there and something
[1:05:59] said to me, just as plain as you hear
[1:06:01] me, stop and go back.
[1:06:04] Well, I thought, what was I thinking
[1:06:06] about? Maybe it's just my mind and I
[1:06:08] just couldn't make another step forward.
[1:06:11] And so what Brother Bram does is he
[1:06:13] stops and eats a sandwich.
[1:06:17] Listen, the the the storm is raging. The
[1:06:21] wind is howling. Amen. It's blowing snow
[1:06:24] everywhere. And God speaks with a voice.
[1:06:27] He speaks to the prophet. And man, I
[1:06:29] don't think he was screaming at him. I
[1:06:31] don't think he was yelling at him, but
[1:06:32] he spoke to him. So much so that the
[1:06:34] brother Brandham could doubt that voice
[1:06:36] and think that was just his thinking.
[1:06:38] When brother Ram gets to the message, a
[1:06:40] guide, remember in the story, a guide,
[1:06:42] he thought he's a hunter and he gets
[1:06:43] lost and he and he's walking in the
[1:06:45] circle, the march of death, and he keeps
[1:06:47] coming back to the same deer hanging in
[1:06:49] the tree and he knows he's lost, fog
[1:06:51] setting in. and he knows he's in trouble
[1:06:53] and he starts to he starts to be ashamed
[1:06:55] of himself for his pride for being
[1:06:57] arrogant about being a hunter and now
[1:06:59] he's lost and he said something said uh
[1:07:02] uh oh man I can't remember what it said
[1:07:04] I don't have it in my notes uh I'm a
[1:07:06] very present help in the time of danger
[1:07:08] that's what it was in the time of
[1:07:09] trouble
[1:07:10] and it wasn't loud amen the the the the
[1:07:14] I'm sure his heart beating was loud the
[1:07:17] thoughts that were raging through his
[1:07:18] mind of his wife and his baby being in
[1:07:20] danger that was loud But there was
[1:07:22] something he said, "I didn't quite catch
[1:07:23] it.
[1:07:25] Didn't quite catch it." And he went on
[1:07:27] and he was talking. He was praying and
[1:07:28] it come again. My very present help in a
[1:07:31] time of trouble. And and and listen, you
[1:07:33] would think that the voice of God
[1:07:35] speaks. You would halt everything and
[1:07:37] but no, he keeps going. But God, my
[1:07:38] family, and he's he's troubled in his
[1:07:40] mind and he's all worked up and here it
[1:07:42] comes again. I'm a very present help in
[1:07:45] the time of trouble.
[1:07:48] Amen.
[1:07:50] God is not like YouTube.
[1:07:54] God is not like the voices in the world.
[1:07:56] God is not like the radio. God is not
[1:07:58] like everything else that's screaming.
[1:08:01] God is a gentleman and God is constant
[1:08:03] and God is steady and he's always there
[1:08:06] and his word is always speaking to our
[1:08:08] hearts.
[1:08:11] Brother man finally when he started
[1:08:14] paying attention to what was saying, he
[1:08:16] caught what it was. Listen, he could
[1:08:19] have caught it way back when it first
[1:08:22] was spoken, but he was so worked up and
[1:08:24] so troubled, but God just kept speaking
[1:08:27] it to him. Kept speaking it to him.
[1:08:31] I don't know. This just does something
[1:08:33] for me.
[1:08:35] It it it thrills my heart, but it also
[1:08:39] troubles me because I I I
[1:08:43] so many times miss what God's trying to
[1:08:46] tell me because God's not competing for
[1:08:49] attention.
[1:08:51] That's right.
[1:08:52] Because God is not fighting his way to
[1:08:55] the top of the list of things that I'm
[1:08:57] listening to or looking at.
[1:09:00] God's a gentleman and he's constant and
[1:09:02] he's steady and he's not lowering
[1:09:04] himself to the to the world,
[1:09:08] but he's just constantly sending out
[1:09:10] little radio signals. Beep
[1:09:13] beep
[1:09:16] beep. Everybody else is screaming and
[1:09:18] everybody else is talking, but he's so
[1:09:20] subtle. Beep. I'm here.
[1:09:24] Beep. I love you.
[1:09:28] Beep. Come unto me all who are heavy
[1:09:31] laden and I will give you rest for your
[1:09:33] souls.
[1:09:35] Amen. We have to will to do the will of
[1:09:38] God.
[1:09:39] But sometimes we've got to stop long
[1:09:42] enough to find out what he's telling us.
[1:09:46] Sometimes we think we're doing the will
[1:09:47] of God and really what we're doing is
[1:09:49] our own will.
[1:09:51] And we've taken our own will and we've
[1:09:52] attached religious principles to it and
[1:09:55] scriptures and it's still our own will.
[1:09:57] And God is over here all the time trying
[1:09:59] to tell us something.
[1:10:01] Listen, when when brother Venom was was
[1:10:03] was lying to the lawyer, he knew in his
[1:10:05] heart he he was already condemned, but
[1:10:07] he he was making some excuse and he was
[1:10:09] moving on till finally God got the
[1:10:12] message through.
[1:10:14] When he was running away, he was
[1:10:16] becoming the runaway prophet
[1:10:18] and standing in the gap. He was running
[1:10:20] from the persecution and the rejection
[1:10:23] and he was running from the hurt. He was
[1:10:25] becoming the runaway prophet. Amen. And
[1:10:27] and God was trying to get his attention.
[1:10:29] He had been giving him a dream. A dream
[1:10:30] about his brother-in-law and them being
[1:10:32] bums. And remember, God was giving them
[1:10:34] his dream. But he was still moving on
[1:10:35] with his plans.
[1:10:38] And he said he was driving down the road
[1:10:40] thinking about his plans. You know, I'm
[1:10:42] just that'll be great. That's exactly
[1:10:44] what we'll do. We'll go up there and
[1:10:45] I'll say, "Honey, we're up here. Let's
[1:10:47] stay. It's so nice." And we'll help Bud
[1:10:49] and blah blah blah. And he had taken his
[1:10:52] own will and attached a religious
[1:10:53] covering to his own will.
[1:10:57] But as he's driving, Billy falls asleep.
[1:11:02] He's driving down the road and God
[1:11:05] speaks to him and tells him, "If you go
[1:11:07] on with your plans, you'll be just like
[1:11:09] that. You'll become a bum." And you know
[1:11:11] what brother says? Billy, are you
[1:11:12] talking to me?
[1:11:16] Listen, God's not screaming.
[1:11:20] God's not yelling.
[1:11:22] God's not taking you and holding your
[1:11:24] hands down and pinning them down and
[1:11:25] saying, "Look at me in the face. I'm
[1:11:27] telling you." He's not like that.
[1:11:29] That's right.
[1:11:31] If we want to start hearing God's voice,
[1:11:33] we got to start going God's way. And we
[1:11:35] got to start making time to hear God's
[1:11:37] voice. If we have to will to do his
[1:11:39] will, we need to hear his voice to know
[1:11:41] what his will is in these situations
[1:11:43] that we're facing. Hey, listen. Life
[1:11:45] comes hard. Life comes fast. Sometimes
[1:11:48] you hardly have time to react to it. It
[1:11:50] happens so fast. And I think what we
[1:11:52] need more now than we've ever needed
[1:11:54] before is we need some quiet time. We
[1:11:57] need some time to pray. We need some
[1:11:58] time to meditate. We need some time to
[1:12:00] think about what we're doing in life.
[1:12:03] Think about the next step in life, the
[1:12:05] next stage or the troubles that have
[1:12:07] come or or where our family's at or what
[1:12:09] God's asking us to do. and just actually
[1:12:12] stop and think about it and pray and
[1:12:14] say, "God, what do you what what is this
[1:12:17] situation all about? What are you trying
[1:12:19] to show me? What do you want to do?" But
[1:12:21] usually what we do is we don't want to
[1:12:23] think about anything that's trouble. So,
[1:12:25] we do anything not to think about
[1:12:26] anything that might be trouble or
[1:12:28] require anything that would be painful
[1:12:30] or require us to make a decision. So,
[1:12:33] what we do is entertain ourselves to
[1:12:35] death
[1:12:37] and keep the voice of God at bay.
[1:12:41] I said, "God, help us to have quiet time
[1:12:45] because I have to will to do the will of
[1:12:48] God. I want to hear the will of God."
[1:12:52] Not everybody else's opinion, not what
[1:12:54] everybody thinks about a situation. And
[1:12:57] listen, not even your brothers and
[1:12:58] sisters are always going to give you the
[1:13:00] right advice
[1:13:03] because they're not God. They don't
[1:13:04] know. Amen. They may tell you the best
[1:13:06] they understand. They may tell you out
[1:13:08] of love for you. You may get 10 people
[1:13:10] to agree this is the thing you should
[1:13:12] do. Amen. But what's more important than
[1:13:15] 10 brothers or sisters in Christ telling
[1:13:17] you what you should do? The more
[1:13:18] important thing is God telling you what
[1:13:19] you should do.
[1:13:21] He may confirm what they told you to be
[1:13:23] right, but he may lead you another
[1:13:24] direction. And what's more important is
[1:13:26] to be able to hear from God.
[1:13:29] He may speak through a brother or
[1:13:30] sister. He may speak through a preacher.
[1:13:32] He may speak through the tape or through
[1:13:34] their Bible reading. He may speak to you
[1:13:36] in any of that. But we got to slow down
[1:13:38] long enough to hear the preaching, to
[1:13:40] hear the tape, to read the Bible.
[1:13:44] Amen. Brother Ben made this statement.
[1:13:47] He said, "The real eagle recognizes the
[1:13:49] call of God's word." Why? He's an eagle.
[1:13:53] An eagle to an eagle. The word before
[1:13:55] the foundation of the world to the word.
[1:13:57] The word predestinated to the word
[1:13:58] written for the hour. You realize your
[1:14:01] position. He hunts for it. We know this
[1:14:03] quote, but the reason I put it in here
[1:14:05] is because the word comes to the word.
[1:14:09] The eagle calls to the eagle. The word
[1:14:12] comes to the word. There's a magnetism
[1:14:14] that draws these two together. And what
[1:14:17] is the C gene of God on the inside of a
[1:14:19] child of God? It's the word. Amen. So,
[1:14:22] the word can hear the word. The word can
[1:14:26] recognize the word. What is God trying
[1:14:28] to speak to? He's trying to speak the
[1:14:29] word to the word.
[1:14:32] He's trying to get the word
[1:14:33] predestinated to hear the word written
[1:14:35] for the hour
[1:14:37] because when that comes together, it
[1:14:39] brings results. He's trying to get us to
[1:14:41] surrender our will to his will. Amen. So
[1:14:44] that the word that's in us can line up
[1:14:45] with the word that's coming to us and
[1:14:47] God can perform his will in our life.
[1:14:52] You already have ears to hear.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:57] You already have ears to hear. You
[1:15:00] already have eyes to see. You already
[1:15:02] have the crystal. And listen, I'm sorry.
[1:15:05] We are old people and brother Brandham
[1:15:07] was older than us. Hey, listen. For you
[1:15:08] young people, a crystal in a radio was
[1:15:12] how they dialed it in to pick up the
[1:15:14] signal from the antenna and transmit it.
[1:15:17] Now, it would be a Wi-Fi receiver. Okay?
[1:15:21] Inside of you is a Wi-Fi receiver.
[1:15:23] I'm probably using the wrong words
[1:15:25] anyways,
[1:15:27] but it's already there. Amen.
[1:15:29] And God's sending out the signal.
[1:15:31] Sending out the signal. If we could just
[1:15:34] get to where we can catch the signal,
[1:15:36] there's already something in you to
[1:15:38] catch it. And there's already a God
[1:15:40] sending it. And these two come together.
[1:15:42] And when we can take our human self and
[1:15:44] align our will with his will. Amen. Then
[1:15:47] the will of God will be done in our
[1:15:48] lives.
[1:15:50] But we've got to catch the frequency.
[1:15:52] We've got to catch the signal.
[1:15:55] Amen.
[1:15:57] And I don't know how we can keep doing
[1:15:58] it with so much noise.
[1:16:01] So many times when when God spoke to
[1:16:04] brother Brandham, so many times he would
[1:16:07] say, "Now that was just that was just a
[1:16:09] thought. I think that was just me." It
[1:16:11] was it was so subtle the way God did it.
[1:16:14] It wasn't as though brother Brandham
[1:16:15] knew exactly when God spoke that that
[1:16:17] was God. He didn't know if it was his
[1:16:19] own thought. He didn't know if it was
[1:16:20] himself. He didn't know if it was Billy
[1:16:22] Paul. He didn't know what it was. He had
[1:16:24] to wait for a minute. He had to be
[1:16:27] patient for a minute. And if he would
[1:16:29] just wait for a minute and be patient,
[1:16:30] God would speak again. And he would
[1:16:32] catch it. Amen. He would catch it more
[1:16:33] clearly, he catch what God's saying. He
[1:16:35] may not have got it just right the first
[1:16:37] time. Amen. And sometimes, I wonder if
[1:16:39] God's trying to speak to us. Amen. And
[1:16:41] and constantly trying to speak to us
[1:16:43] like he was the prophet. And and we may
[1:16:45] get confused. We may not recognize
[1:16:47] that's God. We may not recognize that
[1:16:48] what he's trying to say us to us. We
[1:16:50] haven't caught it just right. But if we
[1:16:52] could just slow down and wait for a
[1:16:54] minute,
[1:16:55] I think it's a a marvelous the the the
[1:16:58] story of the storm. Brother Brandham in
[1:16:59] Colorado.
[1:17:01] He's marching down to save himself and
[1:17:04] doing what good advice would tell you
[1:17:05] and good reasoning would tell you to do.
[1:17:07] And a voice tells him to go back where
[1:17:10] you came from.
[1:17:12] And he says, "That was just me thinking.
[1:17:14] Was that just me?" And he's questioning
[1:17:16] and and he passes it off as his thought.
[1:17:19] But he'd come to a place with the Lord.
[1:17:22] He had so many experiences.
[1:17:24] He didn't keep walking down the mountain
[1:17:26] even though this was a life-threatening
[1:17:28] situation.
[1:17:29] He didn't yet go back to where he came
[1:17:31] from, but he didn't keep walk. He sat
[1:17:33] down and took out a soggy sandwich David
[1:17:35] had made for him, David Woods, and he
[1:17:37] started sitting there eating that
[1:17:39] sandwich.
[1:17:41] And as he paused,
[1:17:44] God spoke to him again.
[1:17:47] Go back into the storm.
[1:17:52] I think maybe we just need to pause
[1:17:53] sometimes.
[1:17:55] Just pause. Don't stop for half a
[1:17:57] second, keep trucking along the way, but
[1:17:59] actually pause for a second
[1:18:01] and say, "God, are you trying to tell me
[1:18:03] something?
[1:18:04] Are you trying to speak to me?
[1:18:07] I don't want my own will. What my desire
[1:18:11] is is your will. I keep I I keep falling
[1:18:15] back into my own will and messing things
[1:18:17] up. I I admit that. I happens to me all
[1:18:19] the time.
[1:18:20] But that's not what I want. That's not
[1:18:22] my desire. My desire is for you to have
[1:18:24] your way with me.
[1:18:26] I don't want my own will. Really, when
[1:18:28] it comes down to it, I really don't want
[1:18:30] my own way. I want you to have your way.
[1:18:34] But so much noise, so much earthquake
[1:18:38] and wind and fire,
[1:18:42] but oh, he still has a still small
[1:18:44] voice.
[1:18:46] If we could stop and catch that, then we
[1:18:49] could align our will to his will and God
[1:18:51] can have his way with us,
[1:18:54] man. Let's all stand together.
[1:18:57] You ever heard how Brother Benham said
[1:18:59] and other people say
[1:19:02] sometimes God lets something happen
[1:19:05] and we find ourselves in the hospital or
[1:19:07] something flat on our back so we could
[1:19:09] look up and and God has to stop us.
[1:19:13] Listen, it wasn't the violent accident
[1:19:16] that was God speaking.
[1:19:20] It was the condition that created the
[1:19:22] pause. So while we were quiet, he could
[1:19:24] speak.
[1:19:26] Amen.
[1:19:27] It was not the It was not the accident.
[1:19:30] It was not the layoff. It was not the
[1:19:32] rejection. It was not whatever whatever
[1:19:35] it is. We find ourselves in trouble and
[1:19:37] we get to this place where God begins to
[1:19:39] talk to us. It wasn't ever the trouble
[1:19:42] that was God talking. It was whatever
[1:19:44] the trouble was that God caused us to
[1:19:46] stop long enough to hear him talking.
[1:19:53] I pray God doesn't have to put me in
[1:19:55] traction to speak to me.
[1:19:58] Amen. That's right.
[1:19:59] I pray that I don't have to go through
[1:20:03] something like that and lay flat on my
[1:20:04] back in a hospital looking up asking God
[1:20:07] questions so that he can finally slow me
[1:20:09] down enough to talk to me. But I want to
[1:20:12] carve time out of every day of my life
[1:20:14] and have my ears pricked and say, "God,
[1:20:16] what do you want to tell me?"
[1:20:19] Because that's how God speaks to us. Not
[1:20:21] in the chaos, not in the noise. I mean,
[1:20:23] we can be in chaos and noise like
[1:20:25] brother Brandon was in a storm, but it
[1:20:27] was the still small voice.
[1:20:29] Amen.
[1:20:30] Amen. It was the still small voice. And
[1:20:33] I said, God, speak to me. Speak to your
[1:20:36] servants, almighty God, and give us a
[1:20:39] heart to receive and line up to your
[1:20:42] will. Amen. Let's bow our heads and
[1:20:45] pray.
[1:20:47] Dear heavenly father, we thank you God
[1:20:50] for these constant reminders in our
[1:20:52] life. Lord, you've showed us and you've
[1:20:55] told us Lord that you've given us the
[1:20:58] option to choose. You've given us a free
[1:21:01] moral agency. You've given us the power
[1:21:03] of choice. When you put us in
[1:21:06] partnership with you, one of one thing
[1:21:08] that made us a partner was choice.
[1:21:11] And you've never inhibited that power of
[1:21:14] choice. We can choose.
[1:21:17] Oh, but God, we want to surrender our
[1:21:20] own choices and choose your choices,
[1:21:24] God. We want to choose your way and
[1:21:25] choose your word. We want to choose your
[1:21:28] will, Lord. That's our desire as your
[1:21:30] children. We're hungry for you to have
[1:21:32] your way with us.
[1:21:34] And God, we've made so many mistakes.
[1:21:36] I've made so many mistakes. And I'm
[1:21:38] sorry, Lord. I get too busy. It gets too
[1:21:42] noisy. and I just keep plowing, Lord,
[1:21:45] and I'm sorry,
[1:21:47] but I want to quiet myself and hear from
[1:21:50] you. And I pray, God, you'd keep sending
[1:21:52] your word to me, Lord. Keep speaking to
[1:21:55] me, Lord. And give me, help me to be
[1:21:57] more attentive to what you're trying to
[1:21:59] tell me, Lord. Help me to be aware,
[1:22:02] Lord, of what you're saying. Help me to
[1:22:04] slow down to hear. And then help me,
[1:22:07] Lord, to surrender to your will.
[1:22:10] God, you've given us the option to
[1:22:12] choose, but we want to take the option
[1:22:14] to choose your will. We want to choose
[1:22:17] your way. We want to choose your word.
[1:22:20] We want to choose to surrender ourselves
[1:22:22] to you that you might use us in this end
[1:22:26] time. So God, I pray you'd help us,
[1:22:28] Lord, that you would dial our dial
[1:22:32] indicator on the inside to your
[1:22:34] frequency to pick up your signal. God,
[1:22:37] may you align us, Lord, with your
[1:22:39] thinking and with your word. And may we
[1:22:41] be receptive to what you're trying to
[1:22:43] speak to us. And may your word speak to
[1:22:45] us every day, Lord, as we've seen it in
[1:22:48] our own lives so many times and in the
[1:22:50] life of your prophet. May, Lord, we have
[1:22:53] time to hear from you. And may you speak
[1:22:55] to us and may we hear when you're trying
[1:22:57] to speak to us. God, we love you and we
[1:23:00] ask for your blessing over all these
[1:23:03] things that you would keep us in the
[1:23:04] very center of your will. We love you,
[1:23:07] God, and we ask that you would help us,
[1:23:08] Lord, as we surrender ourselves aresh to
[1:23:11] you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:23:15] Amen.
[1:23:17] Amen. Brother Joe,
[1:23:18] only
[1:23:20] to be what he wants me to be
[1:23:26] every moment
[1:23:29] of every
[1:23:31] day.
[1:23:36] Yield it completely
[1:23:39] to Jesus
[1:23:42] alone.
[1:23:43] Every step of this will grow away
[1:23:52] just to be claimed in the potter's
[1:23:58] hand.
[1:24:00] Ready to do what his word commands.
[1:24:08] Only to be what he wants me to be every
[1:24:16] moment of every
[1:24:19] day.
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:24] Only
[1:24:25] to be one. He wants me to be
[1:24:31] every moment of every
[1:24:35] day.
[1:24:39] Yielded
[1:24:41] complete
[1:24:43] to Jesus
[1:24:45] alone.
[1:24:47] every step of this pilgrim
[1:24:51] way
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:55] just to be claimed in the father's
[1:25:00] hand.
[1:25:02] ready to do what his word commands.
[1:25:10] Only to be what he wants me to be every
[1:25:17] moment of every
[1:25:21] day.
[1:25:24] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:25:28] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:25:32] Oh, speak and I'll be quick to answer
[1:25:36] thee.
[1:25:39] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:25:43] Speak my Lord.
[1:25:47] Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me.
[1:25:56] Oh, hear the Lord of harvest quickly
[1:26:00] calling.
[1:26:03] Oh, who will go and work for me today?
[1:26:11] Oh, who will bring to me the lost and
[1:26:15] dying?
[1:26:18] And who will point them to that narrow
[1:26:22] way?
[1:26:24] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:26:28] Speak my Lord.
[1:26:32] Oh, speak and I'll be quick to answer
[1:26:36] thee.
[1:26:39] Speak my Lord.
[1:26:43] Speak my Lord.
[1:26:47] Speak and I will answer.
[1:26:51] Lord, send me.
[1:26:56] And when the cold of fire had touched
[1:27:00] the prophet,
[1:27:04] making him as pure as pure can be.
[1:27:10] Oh, when the voice of God said, "You go
[1:27:14] for us."
[1:27:18] Then he answered, "Here am I sending.
[1:27:24] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:28] Speak my Lord.
[1:27:32] Oh, speak and I'll be quick to answer
[1:27:36] thee.
[1:27:38] Speak my Lord.
[1:27:42] Speak my Lord.
[1:27:46] Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me.
[1:27:55] And millions now in sin and shame are
[1:27:59] dying.
[1:28:03] Listen to the sad and bitter cry.
[1:28:09] Oh, hasten brother, hasten to the
[1:28:13] rescue.
[1:28:15] will
[1:28:17] quickly answer, "Master, here am I."
[1:28:23] Oh, speak my Lord.
[1:28:26] Speak my Lord.
[1:28:31] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[1:28:37] Speak my Lord.
[1:28:41] Speak my Lord.
[1:28:45] Speak and I will answer.
[1:28:49] Lord, send me
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:57] quiet
[1:29:00] me.
[1:29:02] Let peaceful waters
[1:29:06] flow
[1:29:08] and learn
[1:29:10] to be still.
[1:29:13] my soul
[1:29:19] and let
[1:29:22] here
[1:29:26] my Jesus draw near.
[1:29:32] Oh touch me Lord
[1:29:36] why
[1:29:39] me?
[1:29:42] Oh, quiet
[1:29:46] me.
[1:29:48] Let peaceful waters
[1:29:52] flow
[1:29:54] and learn
[1:29:57] to be still.
[1:30:00] Oh my soul
[1:30:07] and let
[1:30:09] near

[1:30:16] near.
[1:30:18] Oh touch me now
[1:30:22] quiet why
[1:30:25] me.
[1:30:29] Oh quietly,

[1:30:35] let peaceful waterers flow.
[1:30:41] Oh, learn
[1:30:43] to be still.
[1:30:47] Oh my soul
[1:30:53] and let
[1:30:56] let me hear

[1:31:03] near.
[1:31:06] touch
[1:31:08] with quietly
[1:31:16] as the deep

[1:31:23] the waterers.
[1:31:25] Oh my soul

[1:31:31] thee.
[1:31:36] For you are

[1:32:37] For you're my friend,

[1:33:03] other so much more
[1:33:07] than anything.
