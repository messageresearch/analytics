[0:00] I'll go and prepare a place for you take
[0:03] you out of this pest house and deliver
[0:05] you into my father's house amen there
[0:07] you are take you out of this old Earthly
[0:09] pest house he's going to prepare a place
[0:12] a perfect place where no evil exists no
[0:15] sickness exists no old age exists no
[0:19] death exists
[0:22] paragraph 65. now this old world must
[0:24] fail but fall because it came through
[0:27] sex and it came through disobedience in
[0:29] the beginning and we was born here
[0:31] through sex through the fall and it must
[0:33] go right back the same way to the fall
[0:35] but the one he is now preparing for you
[0:39] cannot fall
[0:41] man
[0:44] so he is currently preparing something
[0:47] for us but Jesus when he was on Earth
[0:50] says that the Mansions are already there
[0:53] again hybrid brain explosion
[0:57] but there has to be a simple explanation
[1:01] because God hides himself in simplicity
[1:03] so why is it so difficult to believe
[1:06] even though it has an eternal attribute
[1:08] and is there and was there and has
[1:11] always been there and Jesus declared in
[1:13] my father's house are many mansions that
[1:15] he's still not doing something and
[1:18] working on an attribute that is attached
[1:21] to that
[1:26] there's only one thing the brother
[1:27] random says that we take from this life
[1:29] to that one
[1:33] character
[1:35] you tell me how you perfect your
[1:38] character for that Mansion over there if
[1:41] Jesus didn't go and make a way to send
[1:43] you a prophet back to tell you the truth
[1:44] and establish your character and form it
[1:47] into the image that would fit that body
[1:48] it was over there
[1:51] I got way ahead of myself there but I
[1:52] just couldn't help myself
[1:57] we have an eternal attribute attached to
[2:00] us we have a mansion and a body I don't
[2:04] know what to call it Saints if you call
[2:05] it a theophany at this point I was the
[2:07] theophany in the mind of God and then it
[2:10] became into something else and then came
[2:12] down and I don't know I'm just being
[2:14] honest I don't know I know at the very
[2:16] least I was an attribute I was a thought
[2:19] and I was real in the mind of God
[2:22] and there is at some point in time going
[2:25] to come a bodily expression of that in
[2:28] another dimension that I'm going to take
[2:30] only my character and put into that
[2:35] and how all that works I have no idea I
[2:38] cannot expound that to you
[2:40] but Jesus has went to prepare a way for
[2:44] that to happen
[2:46] and the only way for my character to get
[2:49] to a point that it can go into that
[2:50] Dimension and into that form that
[2:52] already has an eternal attribute it's
[2:55] through the word that he has delivered
[2:56] through the prophet for my age
[2:59] the only way for me to get to things
[3:02] that are to be
[3:03] is to receive the things that are now
[3:06] and the things that are now has told me
[3:08] what has been what is and it's told me
[3:11] what's going to come to give me the
[3:13] faith to move into that next dimension
