[0:13] i need you
[0:16] [Music]
[0:27] somehow
[0:32] [Music]
[0:38] praise the lord
[0:40] god bless you this evening it's good to
[0:41] see you out and i'm so glad it's not
[0:43] snowing
[0:45] first wednesday and a couple of them
[0:47] that it's not snowing praise god so
[0:50] if we go out and have to chip ice off of
[0:52] our windows something is up
[0:55] amen but praise god we're glad to be
[0:57] here and thank god for the time we have
[0:59] we're going to finish the message shalom
[1:01] lord willing tonight and i've been
[1:03] enjoying it very much i always enjoy
[1:05] this we've done this about once a year
[1:07] and sometimes more but
[1:09] it really i really thoroughly enjoy
[1:11] doing this together as a body
[1:13] amen
[1:15] let's uh
[1:16] take and
[1:17] take our bibles and open to isaiah 60
[1:20] we'll read a couple scriptures and let
[1:21] you be seated
[1:23] we're going to read again the opening
[1:24] scriptures that brother branham opens
[1:26] with
[1:27] here when he starts preaching the
[1:29] message shalom
[1:32] so we can be reminded of what he he
[1:34] starts it's very important i believe
[1:37] it's very important the opening
[1:38] scriptures brother branham uses i always
[1:40] told you before i look at the title i
[1:42] look at where the message is placed in
[1:44] the sequence of events what is he trying
[1:46] to tell us and the opening scriptures he
[1:48] opens with because brother branham's not
[1:50] just picking a scripture
[1:52] that kind of has something to do with
[1:53] this title and then moving on and
[1:54] preaching nothing about it he's actually
[1:56] opening with that scripture because this
[1:58] is what he's preaching on so i'd like to
[2:00] keep that fresh in our minds so let's
[2:02] start off with isaiah 60 verse 1.
[2:06] arise shine for thy lightest come
[2:10] i think i could preach every time i read
[2:12] that line
[2:13] because that's the commandment arise
[2:15] shine he's saying this is the rising of
[2:18] the sun but where is the rising of the
[2:20] sun upon thee
[2:22] so he's he's telling you to arise and
[2:25] shine wake up church come out of dark
[2:28] layer to see you arise out of
[2:30] denominationalism arise out of the
[2:33] deadness of the church ages arise and
[2:35] shine he's commanding us to arise and
[2:39] shine it's not a suggestion it's not a
[2:41] cute phrase it's a commandment it's time
[2:44] now bride to arise and shine
[2:47] arise shine for thy light has come and
[2:50] the glory of the lord has risen upon
[2:52] thee for behold the darkness shall cover
[2:54] the earth and gross darkness the people
[2:56] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[2:59] his glory shall be seen
[3:01] upon
[3:02] thee
[3:04] so where are you going to see the glory
[3:05] of the lord today
[3:07] upon thee
[3:09] amen all right let's turn back the other
[3:11] scripture was psalm 62. this is the
[3:13] other scripture that brother branham
[3:14] opened this sermon with
[3:17] psalm 62
[3:23] and verse 1.
[3:26] psalms chapter 62 and verse 1
[3:29] truly my soul waiteth upon god from him
[3:32] cometh my salvation
[3:34] he alone is my rock and my salvation he
[3:36] is my defense i shall not be greatly
[3:39] moved
[3:43] this is so
[3:44] awesome
[3:46] because we learned before what is a rock
[3:49] in the scripture
[3:50] a rock is a revelation of god
[3:53] it's a rock when god's revealed to you
[3:55] this is what he tells us so the
[3:57] revelation of god is the revelation of
[3:59] the hour and is salvation
[4:05] he alone is my rock and my salvation he
[4:07] is my defense i shall not be greatly
[4:10] moved
[4:11] how long will you imagine mischief
[4:13] against a man you shall be slain all of
[4:15] you as a about a bowing wall shall you
[4:18] be and as a tottering fence
[4:20] they only consult to cast him down from
[4:22] his excellency they delight in lies they
[4:25] bless with their mouth but they curse
[4:27] inwardly selah my soul wait thou only
[4:30] upon god for my expectation is from him
[4:33] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[4:37] is my defense i shall not be moved and
[4:40] god is my salvation in my glory the rock
[4:42] of my strength in my refuge is in god
[4:46] trust in him at all times ye people pour
[4:49] out your heart before him god is a
[4:51] refuge for us
[4:52] sila
[4:54] let's just pray
[4:55] dear lord jesus we thank you god for
[4:57] your word and how it means so much to us
[5:00] lord and we pray that you would further
[5:01] reveal even these scriptures to us lord
[5:04] god as we listen to this tape i pray
[5:06] you'd make it fresh manna for us today
[5:08] as we review these things and discuss
[5:10] them i pray that you would anoint the
[5:11] discussion lord you knowing everything
[5:13] we would say and let everything we say
[5:14] be pleasing unto you we give you first
[5:17] place today in jesus name we pray amen
[5:20] you can all be seated let's take out our
[5:22] books i'm going to do just a quick
[5:24] review and then we'll go to our
[5:25] questions
[5:27] uh
[5:28] also i have a note here to remind
[5:30] everybody that this saturday night we
[5:31] spring forward we move our clocks
[5:34] so this is the tricky one
[5:36] see if anybody's late
[5:38] the next the the other one you get here
[5:41] really early to church that's good so
[5:42] you look spiritual but this one if you
[5:44] mess it up you don't look spiritual
[5:47] so
[5:48] we'll see how many get that one
[5:50] all right if we look here at shalom
[5:53] let's just open to page six
[5:57] i just want to do a quick review of the
[5:58] last few things we've been over not
[6:00] everything we've discussed but just
[6:01] remind ourselves of a couple things and
[6:03] let's look at on page seven i'm sorry
[6:05] not six page seven paragraph 32 this is
[6:08] what i just got done saying referring to
[6:10] the scripture now if you notice in the
[6:12] scripture reading there in the psalms it
[6:14] kept saying god is my rock do you know
[6:16] what a rock represents in the bible a
[6:18] rock in the bible here represents the
[6:20] revelation of god he is my rock and my
[6:22] salvation amen
[6:25] the revelation of god see god is my
[6:27] revelation he is see the revelation of
[6:30] the word is the rock so skip down to
[6:33] paragraph 37
[6:34] and david's speaking here god is our
[6:36] rock god is our rock when god has been
[6:38] revealed to us that becomes a rock see
[6:41] god is our rock so i say that in saying
[6:44] this we can't just say the word is my
[6:46] rock because the word with no revelation
[6:48] can't be your rock
[6:50] and you can't say god is my rock amen in
[6:53] a denominational way of saying god is my
[6:55] rock or the word is my rock because with
[6:58] no revelation it's not a rock
[7:01] it becomes a rock a defense salvation
[7:04] protection it becomes all of those
[7:06] things when it's a revelation from god
[7:10] so it's very important that we
[7:11] understand we there's terminology that
[7:14] have been tossed around in bible
[7:16] terminology that actually has no meaning
[7:18] without the revelation of the hour
[7:21] and the revelation of the hour the
[7:22] revelation of jesus christ today gives
[7:25] meaning it's terminology that's why
[7:27] there's so much biblical terminology
[7:30] that gets tossed about in denominational
[7:32] realms but it never has power to
[7:34] transform it never has power to bring a
[7:37] change and it never has power to
[7:38] overcome because it's just terminology
[7:41] with no revelation because the rock is
[7:43] not terminology the rock is revelation
[7:48] so super important
[7:50] all right let's look back at the top of
[7:52] page six
[7:54] and i just like to read this because it
[7:55] means so much to me and brother branham
[7:58] is speaking here
[7:59] of this new year's message
[8:02] in uh paragraph 26 that now today as we
[8:05] face new years i want to think of not
[8:06] like the past but i want to look to the
[8:08] future so brother branham is here in
[8:11] 1964 preaching the first message in 1964
[8:14] and he doesn't want to look to the past
[8:16] but if you just looked just a few months
[8:18] in the previous year that was a good
[8:20] past
[8:22] but he's not willing to camp down on
[8:24] what god did because he's looking for
[8:26] what god will do and so we want to have
[8:29] the same mindset tonight i don't ever
[8:31] want to camp down on what god did but i
[8:34] want to be looking to what god's going
[8:35] to do what he's doing and what he's
[8:37] going to do but i want to look to the
[8:39] future
[8:40] see as paul said forgetting those things
[8:43] that are in the past i press towards the
[8:44] mark see of the high calling and as it's
[8:47] expressed like looking back through the
[8:49] mirror of a car we are looking
[8:51] we are looking what we have passed when
[8:53] we're looking in the rearview mirror now
[8:55] we're not trying to place the message
[8:57] today as looking through a rear view
[8:58] mirror it would take too long see the
[9:00] things that the lord has did and you're
[9:02] all acquainted with the great things
[9:04] that our lord has been doing is some of
[9:06] the mightiest things that i've ever seen
[9:08] in my life
[9:09] just passing in the last few months
[9:12] but now
[9:13] but now we are thankful for what has
[9:15] been but now we're looking forward we're
[9:18] looking now we're looking where we're
[9:20] headed for and into this 1964.
[9:23] praise god if the prophet could do that
[9:25] after all he experienced in 1963 i think
[9:27] we can do that now
[9:29] amen
[9:31] all right let's look over at paragraph
[9:33] 96
[9:35] on page 19.
[9:40] we want to look at light
[9:42] light to the church for just the morning
[9:44] in contrast to darkness because we know
[9:46] when brother ben was telling us last
[9:48] time that the church has gone into total
[9:50] darkness and it was displayed by the
[9:52] blackout of the moon that had hit the
[9:53] newspapers just before the pope left to
[9:55] go to jerusalem and there was a complete
[9:57] blackout of the moon
[10:00] and so he's talking about darkness
[10:02] because the church has gone into
[10:03] complete darkness and now he's talking
[10:05] about light
[10:06] in paragraph 96 he says what is light
[10:09] the vindicated spoken word of god
[10:11] outside of that there's no light
[10:15] can we let that be true
[10:17] the vindicated spoken word of god
[10:19] outside of that there there's no light
[10:22] see you can't lighten the earth with
[10:24] flashlights it takes god's word that's
[10:26] made manifest the sun
[10:30] he amen praise be to god
[10:33] that's our light
[10:35] now i want to look at paragraph 112
[10:39] the next page over here on page 21.
[10:42] and i want to look at the morning star
[10:44] for just a minute we talked about this
[10:45] last time
[10:49] when we see darkness settling darkness
[10:51] just before day we know that the morning
[10:53] star is hanging yonder to introduce the
[10:55] coming sun
[10:56] it's that's when the morning star shines
[10:58] it's the going between
[11:00] it always darkest just a few minutes
[11:02] before day the blackout comes the moon
[11:04] fails to shine the darkness before day
[11:07] is because the light is pressing the
[11:08] darkness but the morning star comes out
[11:10] and says good morning shalom that's him
[11:14] among us his word being identified
[11:16] shalom
[11:18] so brother branham said the morning star
[11:20] is the going between going between night
[11:22] and day and the morning star is
[11:24] testifying that the sun is coming up or
[11:26] it's the forerunner like john the
[11:27] baptist was to jesus now brother branham
[11:30] was prophesied just as john the baptist
[11:32] before in his first coming your message
[11:34] will form a second coming so now it's
[11:36] also the morning star which is christ
[11:38] himself through the prophet's ministry
[11:41] being the uh announcing the rising of
[11:44] the sun
[11:45] and what we talked about before was what
[11:46] was amazing is what he four ran and the
[11:48] thing he four ran came together in one
[11:50] vessel because brother brennan was also
[11:52] the wave chief of the bride
[11:54] the wave chief of the wheat field that
[11:56] come to full maturity the 400 maturity
[11:58] so he four ran it and he displayed it as
[12:01] the wave sheath all in one vessel
[12:03] praise be to god
[12:06] let's look at paragraph 132
[12:08] on page 23
[12:14] john the baptist was the light of the
[12:15] hour he was the light before jesus was
[12:18] the light the prophet isaiah said oh the
[12:20] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[12:22] prepare the way of the lord make
[12:24] straightest paths
[12:26] amen let's skip down to the last
[12:27] paragraph 136. now what about the new
[12:30] year that we're facing we could have
[12:32] more to say on this in between from
[12:34] darkness to light to introducing the
[12:36] light coming between but now we want to
[12:38] get right straight to the new year
[12:41] now i say that to say this because just
[12:44] as just as brother branham in his
[12:46] forerunner part of his ministry he was
[12:48] that morning star that was christ amen
[12:51] appearing through the the prophet
[12:53] messenger the forerunner announcing that
[12:55] the sun would come up but then brother
[12:57] branham gets to the message and shalom
[12:58] and said it's the sun has come up he
[13:00] gets to the rising of the sun and says
[13:02] this is the rising of the sun he's
[13:04] showing you that there was the go
[13:05] between amen between the darkness of the
[13:07] church ages and the rising of the sun or
[13:09] the fullness of the word coming back and
[13:11] now it's back
[13:13] but then now that that sun is up moved
[13:16] into a bride amen jesus christ coming in
[13:19] the form of the bride and now the bride
[13:22] is a go-between light amen between death
[13:25] and life and now the bride and i'm just
[13:28] taking this in the type now now the
[13:30] bride is announcing the coming of the
[13:32] millennium
[13:33] now she's the forerunner of a new day
[13:36] and that new day will be the millennium
[13:39] and so this cycle just keeps repeating
[13:41] all the way down through
[13:44] praise god let's turn to paragraph 158.
[13:50] on page 26
[13:52] down at the bottom
[13:54] this is the last thing that we read
[13:55] through
[13:57] last week
[14:00] just exactly like he showed us in the
[14:02] seven church ages what would come just
[14:04] exactly what he showed us what would
[14:05] come when he set that light up there in
[14:08] revelation or set that light up there in
[14:11] revelation to it to show the world now
[14:13] he said he set that light up there he's
[14:15] talking about the cloud
[14:17] the picture that they took in february
[14:18] 28th of
[14:20] 1963 he when he says he shut that light
[14:23] up there in revelation to it showing the
[14:25] world he's talking about that clown when
[14:28] he sent the seven angels to reveal the
[14:30] seven messenger that had been down
[14:31] through there and show the loose ends
[14:33] each angel coming each day and revealing
[14:35] the loose ends that luther left wesley
[14:37] left the pentecost left is all
[14:39] represented in there and in the very
[14:41] type and shadow of the great shalom
[14:43] jehovah yahweh see exactly throwed it in
[14:47] the skies and there's the mechanical eye
[14:49] taking a picture of it see thank the
[14:52] lord shalom peace don't be weary jesus
[14:55] is here
[14:58] i love that line jesus is
[15:02] here
[15:04] his great light has come to us and we're
[15:06] thankful for it is it the rising of the
[15:08] sun
[15:09] yes jesus is here
[15:12] this great light has come to us and
[15:14] we're thankful for him yes his word the
[15:16] great mystery here he is today
[15:18] manifesting himself doing the same as he
[15:20] did then just the same doing the very
[15:23] same
[15:25] amen praise the lord let's turn to the
[15:26] next page to page 28
[15:29] and we're going to start at the bottom
[15:31] of paragraph 165.
[15:33] if you take your pen and paper out i've
[15:34] got a couple questions
[15:36] that we'll ask
[15:38] and we'll start
[15:40] with just four questions
[15:43] the first one is easy
[15:45] the scripture is god's
[15:47] blank this is a fill in the blank it's
[15:49] an easy one
[15:50] the scripture is god's
[15:53] blank
[15:57] number two
[16:01] how was brother branham's teaching on
[16:03] the church ages vindicated
[16:07] now there's more than one
[16:09] answer for this
[16:10] you could think in your mind now but
[16:11] he's going to talk about this in the
[16:13] message and we're talking about what he
[16:14] says here in the message how was brother
[16:16] branham's teaching on the church ages
[16:17] vindicated it's number two
[16:22] number three what did they kill jesus
[16:24] for
[16:26] this message will answer that
[16:28] what did they kill jesus for
[16:31] number three
[16:35] and number four what are the growing
[16:36] pains of his grace
[16:39] he explains that quite a bit here what
[16:41] are the growing pains
[16:43] of his grace
[16:45] number one was the scripture is god's
[16:47] blank
[16:51] number two how was brother branham's
[16:53] teaching on the church ages vindicated
[16:57] number three
[16:58] what did they kill jesus for
[17:01] and number four
[17:03] what are the growing pains
[17:05] of his grace
[17:07] so we're going to start here at the
[17:08] bottom of paragraph 165 with the last
[17:11] line
[17:12] and then we are going to go all the way
[17:14] to the end of the book the tape quality
[17:16] changes just at the last six minutes you
[17:19] shut off the main tape and they start
[17:21] another one so you'll hear that but
[17:23] we've got the words on the overhead
[17:24] we've got the
[17:26] our books so we'll be able to hang with
[17:28] it but you'll notice the tape quality
[17:29] changes but just hang with it it's only
[17:31] the last six minutes
[17:32] all right god bless you we can go ahead
[17:33] and bring that up brother franco
[17:36] you say brother brandon
[17:38] how do you get that
[17:40] well
[17:42] let me give some thought here just a
[17:44] minute
[17:44] do you know what a sympathy is i know
[17:46] you do it's a music
[17:48] that's a drama
[17:50] see they acted out now you little
[17:53] children so you'll understand
[17:55] you remember in his school
[17:58] i believe you have um what is that
[18:00] little russian sympathy sometimes they
[18:02] they act out on the drums you know it's
[18:04] called um isn't the little about the the
[18:07] little woodpecker you know a guy under
[18:09] the woods and they had the fluttering
[18:10] the beating on the drums and things and
[18:12] you hear it all as you go through the
[18:13] sympathy
[18:14] as they play it
[18:17] uh i forget the name of that peter
[18:20] then the wolf that's right peter and the
[18:22] wolf now that's a that's a russian
[18:25] sympathy
[18:28] see they don't they don't have little
[18:30] little figures flying around playing out
[18:32] but they play it on drums and then
[18:35] and make the drums and the sounds and
[18:36] things it plays it out it acts it so you
[18:38] understand what brother brown's trying
[18:40] to say
[18:41] now do you adults
[18:43] the scripture is god's sympathy
[18:47] yes hallelujah
[18:51] amen amen
[18:52] only composer
[18:54] knows what it really means
[18:57] and he reveals it to those who are
[18:59] listening
[19:00] who are interested in knowing what the
[19:02] drama is amen
[19:04] but you have to know
[19:06] about a sympathy first
[19:08] see it's not just something you see it's
[19:10] the the changing the junctions of the
[19:13] word uh of the music
[19:15] you throw sometimes it's going this way
[19:17] for a while a certain beat after all it
[19:20] changes all around amen what is it to
[19:23] you who wouldn't understand it or don't
[19:25] know nothing about not interested in it
[19:27] it's just a racket
[19:29] amen it's a fuss
[19:30] amen
[19:32] but to those who know about it
[19:35] they're watching
[19:37] they know it's coming amen hallelujah
[19:41] so we have these times
[19:43] of sympathies
[19:45] of the sympathy of god's word
[19:47] the whole drama changes amen
[19:52] were interested listen for that change
[19:54] you know what's getting close
[19:56] you hear the way the drums are beating

[19:59] what's have to happen
[20:01] you know this is a change
[20:03] see it's gonna break out into a burst in
[20:06] a few minutes
[20:07] see you're watching parts you tell the
[20:09] way the drums are timing
[20:11] oh god
[20:14] if you can hear the drums of the finish
[20:15] now
[20:17] you can hear the echo of the music of
[20:20] the heavenly word is singing itself out
[20:22] it shall come to pass in the last days
[20:25] amen
[20:28] the sympathy of god's great drama
[20:31] that he's playing
[20:36] it changes in his sympathy at the
[20:38] junction
[20:39] the composer and those who are
[20:41] interested listen for the change
[20:44] that's what all this stuff is to us
[20:46] we're listening we're watching
[20:48] every time it appears something happens
[20:51] we see the time getting close we see it
[20:53] back not long ago when that church ages
[20:56] were being drawn out we were listening
[20:59] we see it was right with the word
[21:01] beat with the word angel while what
[21:03] happened very come himself amen amen and
[21:06] vindicated him
[21:08] we heard the word say
[21:11] that
[21:12] in the days of the seventh angel in the
[21:14] church age it just said the seventh
[21:16] angels message would be the last message
[21:18] and then what we find out over here in
[21:20] revelations 10 in the days of the
[21:22] message of the seventh angel the
[21:24] mysteries
[21:25] of god should be finished the seventh
[21:28] seal would be pulled back
[21:32] it should be there
[21:33] and all at once was happening a vision
[21:35] broke
[21:37] said go to tucson
[21:39] amen a great noise will take place at
[21:41] this time so you be thoroughly
[21:43] understanding and know that sin it'll
[21:45] just shake the earth nearly amen all of
[21:48] you know about it it's on tape months
[21:50] before it happened that happened
[21:52] amen
[21:53] there appeared in the skies shalom
[21:58] what is it it's a changing beats the
[22:02] sympathy then one time he said about the
[22:04] third pull
[22:05] [Music]
[22:07] i would come by this one way them
[22:10] annoying the heart and then the spoken
[22:12] word amen
[22:15] jesus said greater things than this will
[22:17] you do for i go to my father
[22:20] john 14
[22:21] the works that i do shall you do also
[22:23] greater than this for i go unto my
[22:25] father just as i said a while ago when
[22:27] mary tried to identify him at joseph's
[22:29] son he corrected her
[22:31] amen his words cannot fail he said so
[22:35] god will fail but my words are not
[22:41] when we hear the sympathy beating change
[22:43] and fix the change
[22:44] it's a junction time
[22:47] we notice says he begin to defeat
[22:50] and we've seen the works said i do shall
[22:52] you do also
[22:54] and greater shall you do
[22:57] greater
[22:58] he promised it we've wondered how it
[23:00] could be
[23:02] but did you notice
[23:04] when he performed his first miracle
[23:06] he took water and turned it into wine
[23:10] is that right
[23:12] he took water which potentially someday
[23:14] might have been wine
[23:15] but it was water first
[23:17] and when he fed 5 000
[23:21] what did he do
[23:23] he took something that had been like
[23:25] water he took a fish that once swam
[23:28] and was born from an egg
[23:31] and he broke it and another fish grow on
[23:33] to the creation that was the original
[23:35] creation
[23:36] he took bread that was once sweet
[23:39] and was a seed and become bread and he
[23:41] broke from this bread and the creation
[23:43] only multiplied
[23:45] but in the woods there was nothing there
[23:47] to make a squirrel
[23:50] let there be and there was without
[23:53] anything to break it from
[23:54] what is it the same jesus christ
[23:59] greater things than this will you do
[24:02] amen for i go to my father
[24:06] not take something that's been created
[24:07] break something from that multiply
[24:09] creation but absolutely create
[24:11] showing that he's the same jehovah that
[24:14] stood backers said let there be and
[24:16] there was his word was made manifest
[24:20] when he's made flesh on earth he took
[24:21] his original creation broke it back and
[24:23] multiplied it but now the last days when
[24:25] he comes down among us again the same
[24:28] light that moved down and said let there
[24:29] be light
[24:30] amen
[24:32] he just speaks the creation into
[24:34] existence
[24:35] amen
[24:36] greater than this will you do
[24:38] or i go to my father
[24:41] remember we're at these times in the
[24:43] world don't understand because it's a
[24:46] bunch of nonsense
[24:48] because they're not methodists the
[24:50] methodists don't understand it
[24:51] because it's if they ain't the bad the
[24:54] baptists don't understand it amen
[24:56] because it's not catholic the catholic
[24:57] don't understand it amen because it's
[24:59] not pentecostal to pentecost or don't
[25:01] understand it
[25:04] but those who wait upon the lord
[25:07] those who are looking not one man we
[25:10] have history of any observatory knowing
[25:13] that star that passed over
[25:15] but the wise men followed it
[25:17] for hundreds of miles
[25:19] for two years they watched it and
[25:21] followed it
[25:23] see what i mean
[25:24] to those who are listening to the
[25:27] sympathy
[25:29] remember
[25:30] the composer knows the
[25:32] end from the beginning
[25:35] he knows all about it that's the reason
[25:37] you gotta write it here
[25:39] correctly
[25:42] now
[25:44] you must begin with him
[25:46] you must
[25:47] begin
[25:49] if you want to hear a sympathy
[25:51] you begin
[25:53] with him like in the music at the
[25:55] sympathy
[25:57] you listen you know what it says it's
[25:59] going to be what the symphony is
[26:01] then you begin to listen to music
[26:04] and you know what it is so you know just
[26:06] about here's where certain certain
[26:08] things take place that's got to change
[26:12] not anybody else don't know about what
[26:13] they're just walking sit down it's just
[26:15] a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but
[26:17] the one who knows what it is it's beat
[26:19] out with the music jumped out for the
[26:22] notes it's it's trumpeted with the
[26:24] trumpets it's strung on the heart it's
[26:26] played with the violin it's uh it's uh
[26:29] beat on the bass it's sounded by the
[26:31] trumpets it's beat on the drums the
[26:33] whole thing together in rhythm
[26:37] and it makes the drama so you can close
[26:39] your eyes and live in it
[26:42] hallelujah
[26:44] amen
[26:45] close is mortalized to earthly sight and
[26:49] living the presence of jesus christ when
[26:51] you see his word being beat out in the
[26:54] great sympathy
[26:55] that we're living in now
[26:57] changing
[26:59] you must begin in the symphony the only
[27:01] thing you can do if you're in the
[27:03] symphony then you start you begin to get
[27:05] into the rhythm
[27:08] that's the way you do god amen you don't
[27:10] stand off and look at it amen
[27:13] you get into the rhythm of it
[27:15] how do you get in there you're born into
[27:17] it
[27:18] into the rhythm of the word when you
[27:20] become part of that word
[27:24] you have to become part of the dance
[27:27] to get out of the dance
[27:29] you have to become part of the ball game
[27:31] something you're interested in to get in
[27:33] the ball game
[27:34] you have to become part of the word
[27:37] an oh god sympathy
[27:40] sympathy is what it's playing you
[27:42] understand you're marching with the beat
[27:44] of the time you're watching part of
[27:46] works that i do shall you also greater
[27:49] than this shall you do
[27:50] these last days
[27:52] oh my
[27:54] the great changing of the time we'll get
[27:56] into the beat
[27:58] be to the word
[27:59] find his purpose the hour that we're
[28:01] living get into the rhythm of it
[28:05] how does
[28:07] how he does it
[28:08] if you get into the word you find out
[28:10] how he did it at the beginning amen
[28:13] then you know he's doing it all the time
[28:16] how did he send his message first
[28:19] what does he do he doesn't deal with
[28:21] organizations he never did
[28:24] so he doesn't do it now
[28:25] if you're listening to a rhythm of that
[28:27] counsel of churches you're in darkness
[28:32] but if you're listening to the rhythm of
[28:34] the word
[28:36] what did he kill jesus for you being a
[28:38] man make yourself god
[28:41] you got my message on the three types of
[28:43] believers
[28:46] now that one stood there and
[28:48] it was
[28:49] the
[28:50] make believers
[28:51] they followed along for a while making
[28:53] out like they believed
[28:55] one day jesus said to them say
[28:58] what will you think when
[29:00] the son of man
[29:01] which is from heaven
[29:04] um ascends back into heaven
[29:06] i come from heaven going back to heaven
[29:09] why the baltic multitude walked away and
[29:12] said this is a hard saying amen
[29:15] then there come
[29:17] the
[29:19] make believers that was walking with him
[29:22] the 70.
[29:23] when they got something hard
[29:26] they didn't see
[29:27] they didn't know the sympathy amen they
[29:29] didn't know the promise that this child
[29:32] was jehovah
[29:33] his name shall be called counselor
[29:36] prince of peace almighty god amen
[29:39] and when he said when i ascend up to
[29:41] heaven from where i come from
[29:44] well they said this is a hard thing
[29:47] who can argue that we know you're just a
[29:49] man
[29:50] we eat with you
[29:51] we sleep with you
[29:53] we're in the woods with you we're by the
[29:55] waters with you while you're merry a man
[29:58] and say the son of man that goes back up
[30:00] where he comes from
[30:02] what will you say this is a hard thing
[30:04] see
[30:05] they didn't know the beat
[30:07] they didn't know the rhythm of the
[30:09] sympathy of god's word that he was god
[30:13] manifested in the flesh for he was a
[30:15] vindicated word light of the hour
[30:19] they didn't get it he said this is a
[30:21] hard thing
[30:22] who can understand this and they turned
[30:24] away they didn't know the beat amen
[30:29] then we notice again there was judas the
[30:31] make-believer or the unbeliever that
[30:33] waited that he found a paul then he
[30:35] turned to the disciples
[30:37] said just a 12. and judas was one of
[30:40] them
[30:40] he said you want to go too then peter
[30:42] said who would we go to lord
[30:44] you're the composer amen
[30:48] you know what's going on amen you're the
[30:50] only one that has a word of life
[30:53] where could we turn to we couldn't go
[30:55] back to be a pharisee or sadducee or
[30:56] herodian or whatever it might be yeah
[30:59] you're the one that has the word of life
[31:01] we have no other place to go we've
[31:03] joined ourselves to this great concert
[31:06] we are in here we're listening and we're
[31:09] in the rhythm we believe that you are
[31:11] the son of god the manifested jehovah
[31:14] amen we're sure of this
[31:16] amen we don't know what these great
[31:18] trials and troubles and afflictions and
[31:20] things and you saying you're going to be
[31:21] offered up in all this other and on the
[31:24] third day all this stuff we don't
[31:25] understand that but we're in listen to
[31:28] god's sympathy we're a part of
[31:31] and we're waiting to see what takes
[31:33] place next and we're following close
[31:35] with you oh my that's what i want to do
[31:39] promise
[31:40] how does he begin just like he did at
[31:42] the beginning
[31:44] he never did send his message to our
[31:46] organization
[31:47] he never sent his group
[31:50] a message
[31:51] he sent one man
[31:54] in the days of noah it was noah
[31:56] in the days of moses it was moses this
[31:59] others thought one time that they said
[32:00] will you make yourself the only holy man
[32:02] in lunch
[32:04] god
[32:05] look down upon me amen moses when said
[32:08] lord i've done this what must it say
[32:09] separate yourself from them
[32:11] i'll take care of the rest of it i sent
[32:14] you it's my responsibility and he opened
[32:16] up the earth and swatted up cora in all
[32:18] the games
[32:20] always
[32:21] john and jesus couldn't be the same time
[32:24] jesus when john looked up and said now i
[32:26] must decrease he must increase
[32:28] he's a vindicated light so will this
[32:30] light move on until he'll find it full
[32:32] of vindication comes that's right that's
[32:34] right he is as he was at the beginning
[32:37] that's how you start
[32:38] how you start learning what god was
[32:42] what did he do when he was here on earth
[32:44] what type of life did he live
[32:46] did he agree was he a compromiser did he
[32:48] go to the organizations
[32:52] how did he identify himself search the
[32:54] scriptures
[32:56] you think in them you think you have
[32:58] eternal life and they're the ones that
[32:59] testify me
[33:02] that's the same thing today or any other
[33:04] time when you want light see what the
[33:06] scripture says for this hour all right
[33:09] where do you begin then if there's a
[33:10] sinner here
[33:12] you begin at the cross
[33:14] where you're wrecking yourself dead with
[33:15] him you've entered in then to the to the
[33:18] great
[33:18] drama
[33:21] you're listening then you're watching
[33:22] your sheet
[33:23] as you hold in your hand the the
[33:26] symphony you got a sheet in your hand
[33:28] that would tell you these things
[33:30] where the changes of the music begins to
[33:33] make it act out then you see what the
[33:34] act is when you see god's spirit fall
[33:37] upon people and do a certain thing you
[33:39] look back to see where it's at
[33:40] see if it's that that's the thing for
[33:42] today
[33:43] why they had to shoot in their hands
[33:45] when jesus came
[33:47] of the sympathy
[33:48] certainly they did
[33:50] i'm i saying that word right symphony
[33:52] sympathy
[33:53] i hope so
[33:54] so then
[33:55] i just happen to think of it
[33:57] symphony
[33:58] sentiment
[34:00] is that right
[34:01] all right
[34:03] now
[34:04] they had a sheet in their hands but what
[34:06] would they do they were trying to look
[34:08] back to a beat that had all
[34:10] a portion had already been played out
[34:12] amen
[34:14] that's what the churches do today they
[34:15] look back see what part luther played
[34:17] the luthers
[34:18] does they don't know the change of music
[34:22] amen they don't know what god's doing
[34:24] today when he does these things the
[34:25] lutheran the pinnacle oh we got it
[34:29] you got a sheet that played out 50 years
[34:31] ago
[34:34] certainly
[34:35] let's just keep this word in our hands
[34:37] and watch when the changes comes
[34:39] then we'll know what we're doing
[34:42] now
[34:43] have begin with him at the cross repent
[34:46] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[34:48] christ for the remission of sins and you
[34:50] shall receive
[34:51] the music
[34:52] amen the direction
[34:55] his word
[34:56] the holy ghost that manifests the word
[35:00] then follow through with the rhythm of
[35:02] the word
[35:03] whatever
[35:04] the music beats for that hour beat with
[35:07] it amen
[35:11] many people ask them
[35:14] why
[35:15] hey somebody asked me why
[35:19] why once these things happen
[35:21] why why why did this happen to me why
[35:23] did i start and this happened i had this
[35:25] trouble here and this upset me here and
[35:27] i lost this year sometimes i've asked
[35:29] why why when i was just a young minister
[35:31] first started out said god take my wife
[35:33] right off from under me
[35:34] take my baby right from beneath me
[35:37] right beneath my heart
[35:38] why did you do that i didn't know i do
[35:40] now
[35:41] i just held my hand in his and kept
[35:42] trusting he knows every junction
[35:45] he knows the rhythm must
[35:47] when it must take place he knows what it
[35:50] takes to mold you he knows what kind of
[35:51] material he's going to use
[35:53] see
[35:55] the back side of the desert sometimes
[35:57] where god molds righteous men into sages
[36:00] and prophets
[36:02] that's where men are beat out
[36:04] men are beat out in the word
[36:06] when they got all kind of creed and
[36:08] stuff in them comes the word god beats
[36:10] it right out of him molds it right into
[36:12] this into the great sympathy with of his
[36:14] word see and then they see the word
[36:17] moving on god knows when the rhythm of
[36:19] it's got to change
[36:21] he knows how the rhythm goes
[36:23] i don't know how it goes
[36:25] but he knows
[36:27] he knows how it goes i don't
[36:30] i look out here and i say well it's just
[36:32] coming
[36:34] many are the afflictions of the
[36:35] righteous but god delivers him out of
[36:37] them all
[36:40] god has moved through history
[36:43] with the rhythm of the promise of his
[36:45] word in each age in the same rhythm
[36:48] making his word that's how god moved
[36:49] down through history
[36:51] from all the way from genesis to
[36:53] revelation
[36:54] he has moved through history with his
[36:57] word that's right with the rhythm of the
[37:00] power of the holy spirit vindicating his
[37:03] word to the elected amen
[37:07] he's never been able to touch the
[37:09] outside church
[37:10] amen it's only the elected look at that
[37:13] priest said this man is beelzebub he's a
[37:15] fortune teller why he he's reading their
[37:18] minds
[37:20] little do they know
[37:21] the word is sharper than a two-eighth
[37:23] sword a discerner of the thoughts that's
[37:26] in the heart and he was the word but
[37:28] this little prostitute stand at the
[37:30] whale that day to get a bucket of water
[37:32] she said i perceive that you're a
[37:33] prophet yes amen we know the messiah has
[37:35] come and we had prophets for hundreds of
[37:37] years but we know the messiah is coming
[37:39] and when he comes that's what he's going
[37:40] to be he said i'm he
[37:42] that was enough
[37:45] the rhythm behind
[37:47] he was looking for that change from a
[37:50] church denomination to a vindicated
[37:52] messiah
[37:54] yes to the messiah that moses spoke of
[37:57] the lord your god shall raise a prophet
[37:59] like unto me
[38:00] amen there he is
[38:02] the rhythm changed the vindicated seed
[38:04] recognized it amen and when the real
[38:07] word of god falls upon the vindicated
[38:09] upon the seed and they see that
[38:11] vindication of the word they recognize
[38:13] it they're looking at the word they know
[38:15] the junction they know the time they
[38:17] know the change they know the beat
[38:18] that's supposed to be in that hour
[38:20] hallelujah
[38:22] they know the beat they know the time
[38:25] they know how it's supposed to go
[38:28] only the elected knows it
[38:31] philip
[38:32] saw it
[38:33] he couldn't stand it any longer he knew
[38:35] that was messiah so he went to a fellow
[38:37] that had bible study together
[38:40] nathanael he said come see the command
[38:43] come see what we found we have found
[38:47] jesus of nazareth
[38:48] we found jesus of nazareth that's the
[38:51] prophet that moses spoke of to become we
[38:54] found him we found him he said how can
[38:56] it be i just where was he see he wasn't
[38:59] see he didn't know the rhythm yes
[39:00] exactly they've been studying but when
[39:02] he got there
[39:03] he told him introduced to him the word
[39:05] and when he got there jesus said behold
[39:07] in israelites
[39:08] the rhythm began to take hold amen
[39:11] the great drama was being played out on
[39:13] the platform or on the ground on that
[39:15] day maybe jesus stand up on the rock
[39:18] talking to the people and when philip
[39:19] come up
[39:20] but nathanael he looked over to him and
[39:22] said behold an israelite in whom there's
[39:24] no god he said rabbi when did you ever
[39:27] know me said
[39:29] before philip called you when you were
[39:30] under the tree i saw you oh my god
[39:34] he was part of it
[39:36] he said thou art the son of god thou art
[39:39] the king of israel
[39:41] no matter what the
[39:43] the world beats was and all their
[39:46] shin digs ahead of the of the
[39:47] denominations it wasn't that great
[39:50] sympathy of god amen he said
[39:53] that king of israel there you are a sith
[39:56] i know it why he was elected
[39:59] the elected seed knows it's always
[40:02] whoever age
[40:03] that's they know it
[40:06] say but brother branham what about my
[40:08] mother and dad what about my people what
[40:09] about my denomination what will they do
[40:12] they'll cast me out is it
[40:14] if you can't look ahead look up
[40:17] don't try to look ahead anyhow
[40:19] put your hand in his
[40:22] let him lead you look up don't look
[40:24] ahead
[40:26] you say why while others make fun of me
[40:28] about my long hair and me taking off
[40:31] shorts and about me leaving the church
[40:35] suffering for his name's sake is growing
[40:38] pains of his grace
[40:41] yes
[40:42] suffering for his word
[40:45] is growing pains of his grace
[40:47] yes sir just remember it's a grace of
[40:49] god's been given to you oh my
[40:54] like paul said hallelujah
[40:58] out of infirmity
[40:59] something has bothered him get the devil
[41:02] the bethany blow after blow and he can
[41:04] some of the lord three times to take it
[41:06] away from him
[41:08] he said i don't want this lord take it
[41:10] away from it and then one night the lord
[41:12] spoke to him said saul are paul my grace
[41:14] is sufficient there are glory in mind
[41:16] from america oh gloria i know you're the
[41:21] healer i have seen you heal the sick
[41:23] raise a deadly cast out devil open the
[41:26] eyes of the blind but if i've
[41:28] consolidated you and you tell me if your
[41:30] grace is sufficient
[41:32] then this devil that bothers me is is
[41:35] the growing pains
[41:37] of your grace
[41:38] then our glory and mind is why
[41:41] lest i get exalted
[41:43] above the abundance of the revelation
[41:46] see he said he had something the other
[41:48] disciples didn't have
[41:49] he saw him after his death burial
[41:51] resurrection ascension he saw him
[41:54] somebody said well i walked with him so
[41:56] did everybody on the street
[41:57] but hatred is dead
[41:59] buried rose and ascended up and returned
[42:02] back in the form of a pillar of fire
[42:05] he talked to paul
[42:07] that morning the rest of them had
[42:09] amen he said except i get exalted i'm
[42:13] going to build great big seminaries and
[42:14] everything else and great big something
[42:16] other unless i did get exalted above the
[42:18] abundance this revelation
[42:20] god let a messenger of the devil keep me
[42:22] beat down he said then when i'm weak i'm
[42:24] strong amen
[42:26] amen growing pains of grace
[42:30] amen
[42:31] will you stay on that a long time
[42:33] hour and 45 minutes has passed
[42:37] suffering
[42:38] his grace pain
[42:40] oh
[42:41] he may permit crossroads
[42:44] he may permit crossroads to tries
[42:47] to perfect us for his service
[42:51] he may permit that night church
[42:53] both here and on tape he may permit the
[42:56] crossroads for our service like he did
[42:58] daniel
[43:00] he gave daniel a little crossroads one
[43:01] day you know he's a great man down in
[43:03] babylon he didn't and let the king turn
[43:06] against him and throw him in the lion's
[43:08] den it only perfected
[43:10] him sure it is
[43:13] let the hebrew children go into the
[43:14] fiery furnace
[43:17] that was determined to stand for his
[43:18] word
[43:20] he may permit crosswords let them laugh
[43:22] at you for having long hair
[43:24] let him laugh at you for saying why you
[43:26] become a holy roller or whatever more it
[43:28] may they may let you laugh they may
[43:30] laugh at you for that that's all right
[43:32] that's a crossroads that's a little
[43:33] junction that's to prove something see
[43:35] the only thing that the crossroad did to
[43:38] the hebrew children that stood on the
[43:39] word it only loosed them from the bands
[43:43] they had around their feet and legs
[43:46] and sometimes it takes hard trials to
[43:49] break the bands of the world off of us
[43:52] sometimes god lets us have a little
[43:54] trial you know to see what we'll do
[43:56] to take you out of the world
[44:00] or in other words let's have a little
[44:01] trial and knock you out that
[44:02] organization
[44:04] and that idea that the methodist is the
[44:06] only one the baptist or the pentecostal
[44:08] that's that's the only group to god if
[44:10] you don't believe it like my church
[44:11] believe you don't believe it all
[44:12] sometimes it lets a little trial happen
[44:14] maybe you got a sick baby
[44:15] maybe something takes place right the
[44:17] hour of death maybe someone taken from
[44:19] you or something what's it to do to
[44:21] break you away
[44:23] to show you something open your eyes
[44:26] maybe you come to criticize sometimes
[44:28] maybe listen to this tape is to
[44:30] criticize maybe god's doing that to
[44:32] break some of the worldly bands that's
[44:33] got you bound down
[44:35] like a drowning man in the river you
[44:38] have to take the man out of the river
[44:39] before you get the river out of the man
[44:42] amen
[44:44] you have to get him out of the river
[44:45] first
[44:47] then you get the river out of him
[44:51] sometimes god has to do it that way he
[44:53] permits the junctions crossroads to do
[44:55] that stand on his promises
[44:57] the word for they never fail
[45:00] the future
[45:01] that's in his
[45:02] hand stand like they did don't don't
[45:05] give away abraham
[45:07] at his crossroads knew
[45:10] that god could raise up his
[45:13] son from the dead from which he received
[45:16] him at the crossroads
[45:18] abraham come to his crossroad
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] but after he trusted god
[45:24] and seen all the miracles of god 25
[45:26] years he'd wait on a boy a promised son
[45:29] and then god told him to go sacrifice
[45:31] the very thing that he waited for
[45:33] my oh my
[45:36] what a time but did abraham stagger
[45:40] read romans the fourth chapter said he
[45:41] was totally for sweet
[45:46] he was fully persuaded what god had
[45:48] promised god was able to do amen amen he
[45:51] permit the crossroads
[45:53] he was showing through abraham to us
[45:56] see he's able to raise the dead
[45:58] abraham said i'll receive him as one
[46:00] from the dead sarah's wombs is dead
[46:02] sarah's womb was dead and he his body
[46:05] was dead
[46:06] he's an old man
[46:07] she had no milk veins to feed the baby
[46:10] and they didn't have well there was
[46:11] nothing and he was sterile himself and
[46:13] she was terrible
[46:14] there's no way at all and he received
[46:16] him as one from the dead and he said if
[46:18] god can do that
[46:20] god can raise him up from the dead for
[46:22] the same god
[46:24] that he told me the baby would come and
[46:26] i stood and come he can raise him from
[46:28] the dead
[46:30] for he makes everything work together
[46:32] for the good to them
[46:33] amen
[46:35] god who made the promise in the last
[46:37] days these things would happen that we
[46:39] see happen if he promised the son and
[46:41] the son came if he promised all these
[46:43] things that we see through the scripture
[46:45] and it did let's get into the rhythm of
[46:47] it
[46:49] he promised in the last days these
[46:50] things would take place and we sit
[46:53] he promised he would send jesus
[46:56] hallelujah there will be a millennium
[46:58] there will be a new day there will be a
[47:00] day that the sun will never go down no
[47:02] more fallout we'll need it no more for

[47:07] where we're going
[47:09] amen the dawning of a new day i feel it
[47:11] over me now

[47:18] there is no darkness no shadows no skies
[47:21] or no damn dark skies no midnight no
[47:24] graves no powers on the hillsides
[47:27] no funeral processions
[47:29] no doctors no marge amen hey man
[47:33] i can feel the
[47:35] rays of his life breaking through upon
[47:37] my soul
[47:39] the new day
[47:41] the old ones pressing away
[47:43] as i feel the mortal
[47:45] blood pouring through my body i feel the
[47:47] surge of the holy ghost coming behind
[47:50] rise and shine something said billy
[47:52] branham you're getting old
[47:54] you're getting weak your shoulders are
[47:56] dropping your hair is turning gray and
[47:58] falling out that's right and darkness
[48:00] and gross darkness upon the earth but it
[48:02] rise and shine i feel falling out of a
[48:04] surge of light of the glorious gospel of
[48:07] jesus christ which is maybe a new
[48:08] creature in him i'll look for that day
[48:12] amen for the new day
[48:14] i don't know what the future is i don't
[48:15] know what a whole 1964 holds for me or
[48:18] nothing else but i'll hold the head of
[48:19] him that holds eternity
[48:22] who is eternity
[48:24] amen

[48:47] his manifestation of his great holy
[48:48] spirit in these last days
[48:50] and remember
[48:52] remember stay with it
[48:53] what he did you're one of the elected
[48:56] and what he had elected in other days
[48:58] like abraham when he saw it when it's
[49:00] all against scientific proof
[49:02] noah's son is all against scientific
[49:04] proof
[49:05] moses saw it is all against scientific
[49:07] proof these smart agents has gone by but
[49:10] the elected who saw it stood firm
[49:14] amen
[49:16] before the future let's stand firm on
[49:19] the promise
[49:20] god made it it's up to god to see it
[49:22] through
[49:23] i'm just following the rhythm
[49:25] but it beats down the time it says this
[49:27] is the end of william bram on the earth
[49:29] then i'll go with the rhythm
[49:30] [Music]
[49:34] hallelujah
[49:35] the one that beated him beats it out
[49:37] beats it again
[49:40] it's a rhythm of god i'll raise him up
[49:42] at the last days
[49:44] he that believeth on me has everlasting
[49:47] life
[49:48] healing hath my word he believeth on him
[49:50] and sammy has eternal life
[49:52] and shall never come into the judgment
[49:55] let's pass from death unto life amen
[49:57] i'll follow the beating of the word
[49:59] amen not the beating of my heart the
[50:01] beating of the word amen no matter what
[50:03] it is my heart don't beat with the word
[50:04] then my heart's wrong amen
[50:06] amen
[50:08] for he is the word amen amen
[50:12] the bible
[50:15] tells us that
[50:16] god's word
[50:18] i was listening to a program coming up
[50:20] billy and i while ago
[50:22] and it was this uh
[50:23] a bible the hour call prophecy the hour
[50:27] of what is it called something about
[50:29] prophecy um voice of prophecy
[50:33] really it's a 70 adventists
[50:35] they've had four or five different names
[50:37] miller knights is what it was to begin
[50:38] with
[50:39] there was the one that said over there
[50:40] in a meeting that i claimed to be jesus
[50:43] christ
[50:44] that
[50:44] the holy father was old me that pillar
[50:46] of fire and i was jesus christ
[50:49] i had to be a friend of mine standing at
[50:51] the little meeting he raised them said
[50:53] you'll have to prove that because i'll
[50:54] call him right here
[50:56] i don't want you to see one time that he
[50:58] ever confessed that thing
[51:00] and like you talk about the different
[51:01] cults and things on the earth
[51:04] they know one time i tithe in with them
[51:07] on this sabbath question they got the
[51:09] old day that's passed by the holy ghost
[51:11] is our sabbath the bible says so come
[51:14] unto me all yet labor and heavy lay now
[51:15] i'll give you a sabbath to your soul not
[51:17] a day paul said you to keep a day i'm
[51:19] afraid of you so you're
[51:23] hebrews 4 to the people of god of
[51:25] sabbath keeping for we which have
[51:27] entered into his rest has ceased from
[51:29] our works as god did from his amen but
[51:31] their speaker a while ago nice program i
[51:34] have nothing again them i'd do anything
[51:36] i could to help them forgive them freely
[51:37] for satan because they did say something
[51:39] it wasn't right that's all right their
[51:41] doctrine is just like
[51:43] jehovah witness and christian science
[51:45] and all these other cults you see same
[51:48] thing but notice there's like any other
[51:50] organization they're more wrong against
[51:51] the rest of them the words always right
[51:54] it'll prove itself outright notice but
[51:57] as he was speaking the man said we've
[52:00] got the book of the year
[52:02] this writer what is his name the speaker
[52:05] of it i forget though just exactly what
[52:07] his name is now he spoke for the
[52:09] christian business man up in seattle
[52:10] here not long ago world's fair
[52:12] and um
[52:14] um
[52:15] he uh he said this announcer said this
[52:18] man has wrote the book the most
[52:20] outstanding book for this year
[52:22] i disagree
[52:24] the book for this year is the bible
[52:28] it's the light of the world it's god
[52:30] himself
[52:32] our book of the year is the bible amen
[52:34] for this 1964 our book is the bible and
[52:38] all the years to come our book is the
[52:40] bible all years is past it's been the
[52:43] book of the years past the book of the
[52:45] years to come and it's a book of
[52:47] eternity
[52:48] it reveals it is god amen yes
[52:52] it reveals god
[52:55] every year that is to come it's a book
[52:57] of the year
[52:59] on
[53:01] when
[53:02] ever you hear the bible say anything its
[53:04] promises have indicated there will come
[53:08] an eternal someday the bible is the one
[53:11] who gives us this promise when you hear
[53:13] the bible saying that there's coming a
[53:15] day
[53:17] when jesus will come
[53:19] and as i say today now i gotta close
[53:21] because i've been here two hours see
[53:23] right at it look if if the bible tells
[53:26] us
[53:28] of these things that is to come
[53:30] speaks of all these hours that if we
[53:32] pass through
[53:34] the days of noah is predicted
[53:36] the days of all these others the
[53:38] scripture predicted the days of martin
[53:40] luther was predicted the days of wesley
[53:42] the days of pentecostal this hour that
[53:44] we're living in was predicted everything
[53:46] happened just exactly the way it was
[53:48] then when what is it it's the
[53:52] spoken
[53:53] word of god
[53:54] which is vindicated by god
[53:57] makes it the light of the hour
[54:01] see just like the sun
[54:03] when the word the word itself
[54:06] is the light when it's vindicated for
[54:08] the time that it belongs to
[54:11] it's vindicated then it's the light of
[54:13] the hour john was a lot of he he was
[54:16] more alike than elijah and them had
[54:19] elijah he wasn't elijah's life
[54:22] but he was elijah in another form
[54:24] amen vindicating the light amen see he
[54:28] was and when jesus come he said he was a
[54:31] bright and shining light
[54:33] for a season
[54:34] you love to walk in his life
[54:37] see and john said now i must dim out
[54:39] i must go out now my life's finished
[54:41] shining i must go out
[54:43] he must increase
[54:45] he's the light he said i am the light of
[54:47] the world amen that's right
[54:50] same yesterday today forever and he's
[54:52] still the light of the world and what is
[54:54] he in the beginning was the word
[54:56] and the word was with god why was he the
[54:58] light of the world if he'd come said he
[55:00] was messiah and he didn't do like the
[55:02] bible said the messiah would do then he
[55:04] wasn't the light of the world amen
[55:07] it's the vindicated word that makes it
[55:09] the light of the world amen and this
[55:12] hour that we're living in now the
[55:14] vindicated word of this hour
[55:17] pentecostals you say speaking in tongues
[55:19] and so forth that was the day of
[55:20] pentecost
[55:22] amen
[55:23] that was a lot of the hour then
[55:27] this is another day
[55:29] it's a lot of the hour today
[55:31] the seventh church age
[55:34] all smothered out with christ on the
[55:36] outside
[55:39] the moon identifying it all the darkness
[55:41] coming up on the earth the light
[55:43] pressing in now
[55:44] begin to show what's going to take place
[55:47] the thing will be destroyed and the
[55:49] light will come in and destroy it and
[55:50] the saints shall inherit the earth
[55:54] the meek shall inherit the earth
[55:56] the earth the moon darkness will be
[55:59] tucked away
[56:00] the darkness of the night will pass away
[56:03] the darkness with their death and creeds
[56:05] and away from the word of god perverted
[56:07] things that they're saying and the life
[56:09] will break forth upon the day and
[56:10] remember when the full bible
[56:14] listen in closing when this full bible
[56:17] has been thoroughly vindicated
[56:19] then there will be an eternal shalom
[56:23] amen
[56:24] eternal peace
[56:26] see
[56:28] he come and said
[56:29] he was
[56:30] peace on earth
[56:32] good will towards man
[56:33] but the world didn't receive it
[56:35] see
[56:37] he was peace to everyone to come to him
[56:39] for peace
[56:40] see
[56:41] peace on earth good will to man he was
[56:43] the peace
[56:44] at that new year beginning
[56:47] new day of god
[56:48] but why he was the vindicated light of
[56:50] that day
[56:52] see
[56:52] but there's more word to be vindicated
[56:54] he's got to vindicate more word
[56:57] and when the last word is the vindicated
[57:00] is vindicated rather
[57:02] then death is swallowed up in victory
[57:04] and the dead in christ shall rise
[57:06] the millennium will set in
[57:09] and it'll be one great peace
[57:12] shalom
[57:15] let's leave for that day brother sister
[57:17] for that one great shalom remember
[57:20] the bible is the fountain of all wisdom
[57:24] and
[57:24] holds all hopes of the future
[57:28] to the church shalom
[57:31] let's pray
[57:41] little group present here now
[57:46] i've been two hours
[57:47] [Music]
[57:50] on this little new year's
[57:52] message you've been very patient
[57:56] is there one in here this morning or
[57:58] this afternoon rather that doesn't have
[58:02] shalom
[58:03] that peace that spoke that identified
[58:06] word of god when you and the word become
[58:09] one when if the bible says one thing and
[58:11] you say no i can't hardly believe it
[58:13] that's right then you haven't shalom
[58:18] you're not at peace with god because his
[58:20] word says one thing and you disagree
[58:22] with it
[58:26] if the word says shalom
[58:28] peace and you have that peace
[58:31] that every word that god says you can
[58:33] punctuate with an man
[58:36] and you believe it and when you see it
[58:38] vindicated you say amen that is the word
[58:42] but does a creed
[58:44] a light a false light the world sweep
[58:47] across in the shadow
[58:49] of the light that's been reflected to
[58:51] darken it out some creed to say no
[58:55] i think that uh that that was for
[58:57] something else that don't mean just that
[58:59] and yet the word says it are you
[59:01] following that shadow or are you
[59:03] appearing with that light
[59:05] here and in the tape whoever will listen
[59:08] at it think it over just a moment
[59:10] if there's one present here that would
[59:12] like it doesn't have that light
[59:16] would you raise your hand to identify
[59:18] yourself that you're ready to walk in
[59:19] that light today
[59:21] if there's one out in the land of where
[59:24] this tape shall go
[59:26] that you don't have it will you raise
[59:28] your hand to god right word turn off
[59:30] your recorder just in a moment when we
[59:32] pray
[59:33] get down on your knees and say lord god
[59:35] i've doubted i i've did this i thought
[59:38] well because the church said them things
[59:40] couldn't be and this wouldn't be and but
[59:42] i see it's promised in the bible and i
[59:44] see too many things the heavens even
[59:46] declared it itself
[59:48] and these things that are said are
[59:49] happening just exactly and god in heaven
[59:51] is declaring the same thing
[59:53] so i want to receive it now let the word
[59:56] of god come into me and let me get into
[59:58] the rhythm of not listening what the
[1:00:00] church or the preacher says but let me
[1:00:02] get into the rhythm of the word
[1:00:04] and see what it says and let it bring to
[1:00:07] me in this great sympathy of god
[1:00:10] a beating out
[1:00:12] of his will in my life our heavenly
[1:00:14] father
[1:00:16] we now bring to you every hand
[1:00:19] that's up everywhere
[1:00:22] and let the holy ghost of god
[1:00:25] bring to them
[1:00:27] the rhythm of the word and its truth
[1:00:30] that they are to be
[1:00:32] molded now
[1:00:34] into sons and daughters of god
[1:00:37] and they are to be the reflecting of the
[1:00:39] light of god upon the earth
[1:00:42] they are to be the manifested word that
[1:00:45] man and women are to live the way jesus
[1:00:48] lived and to to believe every word of
[1:00:51] god and live by it like he did for he
[1:00:53] said
[1:00:54] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:00:57] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:00:59] mouth of god not just a few of the words
[1:01:02] part of the words but by every word
[1:01:05] proceeding out of the mouth of god
[1:01:08] the word of moses time did not work in
[1:01:11] the days of jesus time
[1:01:13] the word the word in the days of the
[1:01:15] apostles does not work in this day it's
[1:01:18] a promised word for this day they said
[1:01:21] themselves
[1:01:22] and spoke it by the holy ghost what
[1:01:24] would take place in the last days
[1:01:26] how the churches would be heady
[1:01:27] highminded how the would rise up
[1:01:30] and the harlots would be right with her
[1:01:32] and how the they would darken the earth
[1:01:35] and the
[1:01:36] last church age the ladies jesus should
[1:01:39] be completely taken from the church
[1:01:43] oh lord
[1:01:45] let me stay with him the word
[1:01:47] manifest his light through all of us as
[1:01:50] we
[1:01:51] set forth in this new year with a
[1:01:53] determination not knowing what this new
[1:01:56] year holds
[1:01:57] but we're holding to him
[1:01:59] the word
[1:02:01] that knows
[1:02:03] the whole
[1:02:05] sympathy from the beginning to the end
[1:02:08] he knows every move in every junction
[1:02:10] and lord we're just watching him keeping
[1:02:13] our eyes on him the word
[1:02:16] then when we see these things appear we
[1:02:17] know that we're right in the rhythm of
[1:02:21] the word
[1:02:22] granted save every lost soul lord that
[1:02:25] here and everyone that hears the tape
[1:02:28] we commit them to thee
[1:02:30] for thy kingdom sake in jesus christ's
[1:02:33] name amen
[1:02:40] i was
[1:02:44] happy to be with you all this morning
[1:02:46] so i've just been exactly since i'm
[1:02:49] starting exactly two hours but from a
[1:02:51] quarter of 11 to a quarter to one i told
[1:02:54] me i said i'll be back for 1 13.
[1:02:57] i we don't believe in breaking speed off
[1:02:59] i don't think we should do that
[1:03:01] to do it now
[1:03:04] we thank you
[1:03:06] i want to say now
[1:03:08] terry turn his tape recorder off cause

[1:03:16] father will speak to the church i
[1:03:18] certainly appreciate you all down here
[1:03:20] and it's not sometimes i think this is a
[1:03:22] little retreat for me
[1:03:24] to come down here on the back side of
[1:03:25] the desert
[1:03:27] as i call him come back to the desert
[1:03:30] way back up in here and
[1:03:32] look around
[1:03:34] see this little group out here on the
[1:03:35] trees out the side of
[1:03:37] the river
[1:03:40] and uh
[1:03:41] we're on the east side of the river
[1:03:43] house
[1:03:44] and i
[1:03:45] i trust that god will bless you teaching
[1:03:48] everyone
[1:03:50] god
[1:03:50] shalom is with you
[1:03:52] that's his feet
[1:03:54] and i'm sorry
[1:03:56] to help you like this but just to get a
[1:03:59] tape of this now on if the lord willing
[1:04:01] this is what i'm going to speak on at
[1:04:04] phoenix sunday afternoon that might be a
[1:04:06] long little sharp meeting so for them
[1:04:09] purpose in the heart that shares the
[1:04:10] lord willing um i just
[1:04:13] cut and tore from side to side and we
[1:04:15] all know that the identification we know
[1:04:18] what the third pull is we all we all
[1:04:20] understand that i you got your
[1:04:21] hesitation
[1:04:23] and i thank you to slay dormant for a
[1:04:25] little while until a great hour of
[1:04:27] persecution comes on
[1:04:28] that's when you give speech
[1:04:31] you'll be manifested in just like this
[1:04:34] five straight times without your
[1:04:37] perspective
[1:04:38] and now i think just wait
[1:04:40] to see what you're now i'm going back to
[1:04:43] saying again good to
[1:04:45] find out short meetings and we'll kind
[1:04:47] of

[1:04:50] have this 30 minutes talk on something
[1:04:52] about divine healing or something like
[1:04:54] that and whenever i get ready to make a
[1:04:56] tape again i'll either run down here to
[1:04:57] the back side of the desert or up to the
[1:04:59] tabernacle or somewhere where you can
[1:05:01] make a piece or would be among ourselves
[1:05:03] i'm not say what i wish you like that
[1:05:05] but see
[1:05:07] jesus remember see i have to watch when
[1:05:10] i see that people just completely
[1:05:12] irritate me walking away i think i'm
[1:05:15] trying to express it this morning it's
[1:05:16] gross darkness upon them they can't help
[1:05:19] it i'll forgive them or not listening
[1:05:22] and seeing the things that god has done
[1:05:24] and still they don't do it i still freak
[1:05:26] god forgive it
[1:05:28] and i need it from my heart don't say it
[1:05:30] because my master says but uh i want to
[1:05:33] feel in my heart first that i really do
[1:05:36] i don't isolate myself from people i
[1:05:38] don't want to do that
[1:05:39] because
[1:05:41] i'm i have a message for them
[1:05:43] separation i have a lot of moments see
[1:05:46] now i go out with the trinitarians with
[1:05:49] methodist baptist lutheran pentecostals
[1:05:52] seven day adventists and everything else
[1:05:54] because i'm seeking to save that which
[1:05:56] is lost if i can't to bring it in to
[1:05:59] show god
[1:06:00] and the lord be with you not head of uh
[1:06:04] our first little group of meetings here
[1:06:06] i don't know where you have been not the
[1:06:07] schedule here if some of you use the how
[1:06:09] to leave it laying here pastor reid
[1:06:12] forward to do that and if the lord
[1:06:14] willing that is the lord willing to have
[1:06:15] no leaning for him this
[1:06:18] do whatever i can and if you got any
[1:06:20] loved ones around in there would like to
[1:06:22] come to one that means why you're
[1:06:23] writing a letter tell them to tame one
[1:06:25] of these beats god bless you ignite
[1:06:27] seeing your brothers stricker and sister
[1:06:28] stricker and all the rescue people
[1:06:30] you're not some of them i don't even
[1:06:32] know your name but
[1:06:33] i know you by the witness of the holy
[1:06:36] spirit that you're my brothers and
[1:06:37] sisters
[1:06:38] and my love and respect for you and it's
[1:06:41] such a great pleasure to be down here
[1:06:43] with you and i know how you you had your
[1:06:45] dinner set you're going to have a little
[1:06:47] fellowship dinner
[1:06:49] which is possible i could stick around
[1:06:51] and and i know it's good i i know you
[1:06:53] got the best cooks in the country
[1:06:55] i know that's right but i'll probably
[1:06:57] have to get mine on my hamburger
[1:07:13] said would you go down there and preach
[1:07:14] to
[1:07:16] 30 people when you could be preaching
[1:07:18] the same thing to ten thousands
[1:07:20] certainly
[1:07:21] i don't make any surprise i want to see
[1:07:23] what you see
[1:07:25] that's not your pearl before slime they
[1:07:28] turn and trap them under your feet and
[1:07:30] then or turn it wrenchy
[1:07:33] but you don't catch your turtle there
[1:07:35] and i feel that what i say here does not
[1:07:38] have these pearls before sperm i think
[1:07:40] it's
[1:07:41] showing children jewels that belong to
[1:07:43] the emphasis
[1:07:44] the words that you will found sometimes
[1:07:46] in the mustang dirt you ever know what
[1:07:48] the lilian word comes from right out of
[1:07:51] the bottom of the slimy skillet pond and
[1:07:54] it's horrible day and night to get it
[1:07:56] done to the light but when what gets to
[1:07:58] the light
[1:07:59] zooms out the most beautiful flowers
[1:08:02] and that's what the lily is it comes up
[1:08:04] from the dirtier than the film
[1:08:06] that's where the jewels are found
[1:08:08] wrapped up here in the golden state of
[1:08:10] the nation
[1:08:12] where you find gold down in the dirt
[1:08:14] where do you find the grooviest jewels
[1:08:17] in the mustard
[1:08:19] that's where we all come from
[1:08:22] of the world
[1:08:26] i'm a prospector
[1:08:28] part of the prospects to do he hunts for
[1:08:30] gold
[1:08:31] then what he does he shines he keeps it
[1:08:34] out and he smells it and he gets it
[1:08:36] ready
[1:08:37] this is the gold miner
[1:08:39] and i'm looking through here all the
[1:08:41] time for beautiful jewels i mean
[1:08:44] find them out here somewhere in the dust
[1:08:46] and polish them and say boy here they
[1:08:47] are here's a brother you're the born
[1:08:49] again christian you're the fine young
[1:08:51] lady here's the fine middle-aged old
[1:08:53] woman not young woman whatever it is
[1:08:55] you're the argument you
[1:08:57] put in your crown lord you'll shine
[1:09:00] forever and ever like that
[1:09:02] until i see it shalom
[1:09:04] philosophy
[1:09:12] all righty praise the lord
[1:09:14] that was our last section of shalom
[1:09:17] amen
[1:09:18] let's go through the questions here
[1:09:20] question number one
[1:09:22] scripture is god's
[1:09:24] let's look here at paragraph 168 on page
[1:09:26] 29.
[1:09:29] now to you adults the scripture is god's
[1:09:31] symphony we made that easy that's word
[1:09:34] for word amen the scripture so brother
[1:09:36] brethren's going to start taking a type
[1:09:38] of a symphony he's going to type it with
[1:09:39] god scripture so let's read that for
[1:09:42] just a little bit here
[1:09:43] he said yes hallelujah only the composer
[1:09:45] knows what it really means and he
[1:09:47] reveals it to those who are listening
[1:09:49] you are interested in knowing what the
[1:09:50] drama is but you'd have to know about
[1:09:53] the sympathy first see it's not just
[1:09:55] something you see it's the changing the
[1:09:58] junctions of the word of the music it
[1:09:59] throws sometimes it's going this way for
[1:10:01] a while a certain beat after a while
[1:10:03] changes all around what is it to you who
[1:10:06] wouldn't understand it or don't know
[1:10:07] anything about it not interested in it
[1:10:09] it's just a racket it's just a fuss but
[1:10:11] to those who know about it they're
[1:10:13] watching for it they know it's coming
[1:10:15] hallelujah so brother branham's taking
[1:10:17] this type of a symphony and he typed it
[1:10:19] with god's scriptures but he makes it
[1:10:21] the living scriptures
[1:10:24] not just the written word the written
[1:10:26] word is the sheep music but
[1:10:28] all the musicians have to be reading
[1:10:29] from the sheet music amen and they got
[1:10:31] to get into the spirit of the composer
[1:10:33] and know the composer the author who
[1:10:35] wrote it but brother brandon when he
[1:10:37] says the the the god the scriptures is
[1:10:39] god's symphony he's not talking about
[1:10:42] just the written part on paper but he's
[1:10:44] talking about that made alive
[1:10:46] because he says there's junctions
[1:10:48] there's beating out there's changes
[1:10:50] that's when the words made alive and
[1:10:52] there's been junctions all the way
[1:10:53] through through each church age was a
[1:10:54] junction amen and so that part of the
[1:10:57] written word had to come into
[1:10:58] manifestation and each junction had to
[1:11:01] be caught
[1:11:02] let's look at this paragraph 169.
[1:11:08] uh
[1:11:10] no i'm sorry let's skip over to 178 i
[1:11:13] want to read another part of this here
[1:11:15] uh page 31
[1:11:18] 178
[1:11:20] but those who wait upon the lord those
[1:11:22] who are looking not one man that we have
[1:11:24] in history of any observatory know that
[1:11:26] star that passed over but the wise risen
[1:11:30] followed it for hundreds of miles for
[1:11:31] two years they watched it and followed
[1:11:33] it see what i mean it's to those who are
[1:11:35] listening to the sympathy
[1:11:37] you see these wise men brother bam tells
[1:11:40] us in another message we're taught by
[1:11:42] daniel
[1:11:43] the prophecy of the coming messiah and
[1:11:47] daniel's taught them the stars and they
[1:11:49] were watching for the day the prophecy
[1:11:50] would be fulfilled and when they saw in
[1:11:52] the stars which was the first the first
[1:11:55] bible written in the stars when daniel
[1:11:56] taught him how to read the symphony in
[1:11:58] the stars when they saw the change the
[1:12:01] junction they got in the motion and they
[1:12:03] followed that star amen so they were
[1:12:05] watching for it and he says no other
[1:12:07] observatory noticed it but the ones who
[1:12:09] are watching for it
[1:12:11] paragraph 179
[1:12:14] remember the composer knows the end from
[1:12:16] the beginning he knows all about it
[1:12:17] that's the reason he could write it here
[1:12:19] correctly now you must begin with him
[1:12:22] you must begin if you want to hear a
[1:12:24] sympathy you begin with him like in the
[1:12:26] music at the sympathy you listen you
[1:12:28] know what it says it's going to be what
[1:12:30] the symphony is then you begin to listen
[1:12:32] at the music and you know what it is so
[1:12:35] you know just about here's where certain
[1:12:37] certain things take place now it's got
[1:12:39] to change now anybody else that don't
[1:12:41] know nothing about there just walked in
[1:12:44] and sat down it's just a bunch of
[1:12:45] nonsense rattling noise but the one who
[1:12:47] knows what it is it's beat out with the
[1:12:49] music drummed out with the notes it's
[1:12:51] trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung
[1:12:53] on the harp it's played with the violin
[1:12:55] it's beat on the uh the bass it's
[1:12:57] sounded by the trumpets it's beat on the
[1:12:59] drums the whole thing together in rhythm
[1:13:02] and it makes the drama until you can
[1:13:03] close your eyes and live in it
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:07] are you living in it
[1:13:08] amen why because
[1:13:11] because we got in the spirit of the
[1:13:12] composer by the baptism of the holy
[1:13:14] ghost we read the word we're seeing
[1:13:16] what's happening amen when we see things
[1:13:18] transpiring we're catching the change in
[1:13:21] rhythm we're catching the music as it's
[1:13:22] moving amen it doesn't just stay in the
[1:13:25] same pattern all the time but the
[1:13:27] symphony moves and it ebbs and it flows
[1:13:29] and it has transitions and times for
[1:13:31] different instruments to come in and
[1:13:33] come out and move and crescendo and all
[1:13:36] these things are happening and we've got
[1:13:37] to be moving with it
[1:13:40] amen we're all the different instruments
[1:13:43] we're all the musical instruments
[1:13:47] let's continue on here
[1:13:49] man could
[1:13:50] man could close his mortal eyes to
[1:13:52] earthly sight and live in the presence
[1:13:54] of jesus christ when you see his word
[1:13:56] being beat out in the great sympathy
[1:13:58] that we're living in now changing you
[1:14:00] must begin in the symphony the only
[1:14:02] thing you can do if you're in the
[1:14:03] symphony then you start you begin to get
[1:14:05] into the rhythm that's the way you do
[1:14:07] god you don't stand off and look at it
[1:14:10] you get into the rhythm of it how do you
[1:14:12] get in there you're born into it into
[1:14:14] the rhythm of the word when you become
[1:14:16] part of that word
[1:14:17] you had to become part of the dance to
[1:14:19] get out of the dance you have to become
[1:14:21] part of the ball game something you're
[1:14:22] interested in to get in the ball game

[1:14:42] to be eating on the word gotta be
[1:14:44] interested in the message of the hour
[1:14:46] got to be interested in what's god doing
[1:14:48] and the fellowship on the word you can't
[1:14:50] we can't just be a bystander because
[1:14:52] then it starts to become a racket it
[1:14:54] starts to become noise because we don't
[1:14:56] know where we are in the junctions we
[1:14:57] don't know what part the piece is being
[1:14:59] played we've got all of the music laid
[1:15:02] out before us but we're not we're not
[1:15:04] understanding what part's happening now
[1:15:07] but you've got to be born into it and
[1:15:08] then you've got to get interested in it
[1:15:10] and you've got to get into the rhythm of
[1:15:13] it
[1:15:14] how do you get into the rhythm of it be
[1:15:16] in the church services

[1:15:20] word of god be in prayer and be in
[1:15:22] fellowship with believers not to play
[1:15:24] volleyball but to talk about the music
[1:15:27] to talk about the word the symphony and
[1:15:30] where we're at and what part you've
[1:15:32] heard and what is exciting about the
[1:15:34] junction in the change
[1:15:36] then you get into it and then it's no
[1:15:38] longer a racket or a noise you
[1:15:40] understand you can close your eyes and
[1:15:42] just live the drama
[1:15:45] oh praise god i love it when he does
[1:15:47] stuff like this
[1:15:50] paragraph 182 you have to become part of
[1:15:53] the word to know god's sympathy his
[1:15:55] sympathy is when it's playing you
[1:15:57] understand you're marching with the beat
[1:15:59] of time you're watching for it the works
[1:16:01] that i do show you also greater than
[1:16:03] this shall you do these last days oh my
[1:16:06] the great changing of the time we get
[1:16:08] into the beat beat of the word find his
[1:16:10] purpose the hour that we're living get
[1:16:12] into the rhythm of it
[1:16:14] how how he does it if you get into the
[1:16:17] word you find out how he did it at the
[1:16:19] beginning then you know how he's doing
[1:16:21] it all the time
[1:16:23] praise be to god oh i just want to say
[1:16:26] get into the rhythm of it friends
[1:16:28] get into the rhythm of it be in the
[1:16:31] fellowship on the word be fellowship
[1:16:33] around the word amen be into the word
[1:16:36] into the messages
[1:16:38] just get into it and say god get me into
[1:16:41] the rhythm of your word i don't want to
[1:16:43] miss when it's time to play my part
[1:16:46] brother bam said sometimes
[1:16:48] he talks about symphonies and a lot of
[1:16:49] other message but another message he
[1:16:51] says sometimes it'll be that one person
[1:16:52] that's got the ting on that symbol in
[1:16:54] that one certain spot but they got to
[1:16:56] stay with all the instruments they got
[1:16:58] to stay with the music stay with what's
[1:17:00] happening get into the rhythm or they
[1:17:02] won't know it's when it's their turn to
[1:17:04] hit the symbol and they may sit there
[1:17:06] amen he talks about different abilities
[1:17:08] and different gifts and all of us have
[1:17:09] something different to do and that one
[1:17:11] that's going to play the simple the the
[1:17:13] symbol he may only play one time he only
[1:17:16] may
[1:17:17] ting that symbol a few times throughout
[1:17:18] the music but he's got to stay in rhythm
[1:17:21] with everybody else to know when to ting
[1:17:23] it he can't say well i just got a little
[1:17:25] gif and i'm only used once in a while
[1:17:27] and i'll just sit over here and fold my
[1:17:28] arms and wait for somebody to call me no
[1:17:30] he's got to be right in the rhythm of
[1:17:32] the music to know when it's time to ding
[1:17:34] the symbol
[1:17:36] all of us no matter how many times our
[1:17:38] gift is used or how infrequently our
[1:17:40] gift is used it doesn't matter we all
[1:17:42] got to be into the rhythm of the music
[1:17:44] and we've got to catch all the junctions
[1:17:46] and all the timing and all the ebbs and
[1:17:48] all the flows whether used a lot or used
[1:17:50] a little it doesn't matter we all got to
[1:17:52] be in tune with the symphony
[1:17:56] the symbol tinged at the wrong time
[1:17:58] sounds weird
[1:17:59] and when it's time for it to play nobody
[1:18:01] else can make that nobody else can fill
[1:18:03] that gap
[1:18:05] we gotta all be in the rhythm amen
[1:18:09] question number two
[1:18:11] how was brother branham's teaching on
[1:18:12] the church ages vindicated now if you
[1:18:15] know the message you can say all kinds
[1:18:16] of stuff but i'm just talking about what
[1:18:17] he says in this message
[1:18:19] how was brother branson's teaching on
[1:18:21] the church they just vindicated let's
[1:18:22] look at paragraph
[1:18:24] 169
[1:18:26] on page 29
[1:18:29] and i want to just start with the last
[1:18:31] sentence
[1:18:35] or not the lessons the second to last
[1:18:36] sentence or third to lessons whatever
[1:18:40] we see back yonder not long ago when
[1:18:42] that church ages was being drawn out we
[1:18:44] were listening we seen it was right with
[1:18:47] the word beating with the word after a
[1:18:49] while what happened here he come himself
[1:18:53] and vindicated it
[1:18:57] he's not talking about the light
[1:18:59] flashing on the back of the wall
[1:19:01] we'll keep reading we'll find out what
[1:19:02] he's talking about after a while what
[1:19:04] happened here he come himself and
[1:19:07] vindicated it we heard the word say that
[1:19:09] in the days of the seventh angel and the
[1:19:11] church age we just said the seventh
[1:19:13] angel's message would be the last
[1:19:14] message and then all we find out over
[1:19:16] here in revelation 10 and the days of
[1:19:19] the message of the seventh angel the
[1:19:20] mysteries of god should be finished the
[1:19:22] seventh seal would be pulled back it
[1:19:24] should be there then all at once when
[1:19:27] it's happening a vision broke said go to
[1:19:29] tucson a great noise will take place at
[1:19:32] this time so you'll be thoroughly
[1:19:33] understanding and know that it's sent
[1:19:38] it'll just shake the earth nearly all of
[1:19:40] you know what about it it's on tape
[1:19:42] months before it happened then it
[1:19:44] happened then appeared in the sky shalom
[1:19:48] what is it it's a changing beats the
[1:19:50] symphony
[1:19:52] when did he come himself to vindicate it
[1:19:55] when he showed up in the cloud
[1:19:58] and then appeared in the sky
[1:20:00] shalom
[1:20:01] peace
[1:20:02] good morning
[1:20:04] the breaking of a new day
[1:20:07] amen then appeared that's how he
[1:20:09] vindicated the church ages that's how he
[1:20:11] vindicated the seventh church age
[1:20:13] messenger in his message but the man
[1:20:15] said that cloud is a vindication in my
[1:20:18] ministry that it's right that i told you
[1:20:20] the truth
[1:20:22] hallelujah what is that cloud represent
[1:20:24] him
[1:20:26] he come himself and vindicated it what
[1:20:29] is he the shalom amen appearance guide
[1:20:31] the good morning
[1:20:33] let's look at paragraph 173
[1:20:38] when we hear the sympathy beating
[1:20:40] changing fixing to change his junction
[1:20:41] time we notice as he begin to beat and
[1:20:43] we've seen the works that i do shall you
[1:20:45] do also and greater shall you do greater
[1:20:48] he promised it we wondered how it could
[1:20:50] be but did you notice when he performed
[1:20:52] his first miracle he took water and
[1:20:54] turned it to wine is that right he took
[1:20:56] water which potentially someday might
[1:20:58] have been wine but it was water first
[1:21:00] and when he fed 5000 what did he do he
[1:21:02] took something that had been like water
[1:21:04] he took a fish that once swam was born
[1:21:06] from an egg and he broke it and another
[1:21:08] fish growed into the creation that was
[1:21:11] the original creation he took bread that
[1:21:13] was once wheat and with seed and became
[1:21:14] bread and he break from this bread and
[1:21:16] the creation only multiplied
[1:21:19] but in the woods
[1:21:20] there was nothing there to make us to
[1:21:22] make a squirrel let there be and there
[1:21:25] was without anything to break it from
[1:21:27] what is it the same jesus christ
[1:21:32] who was that
[1:21:34] he said it was jesus christ it wasn't
[1:21:36] william branham it was jesus christ
[1:21:40] the same jesus christ see greater things
[1:21:42] than this will you do for i go to my
[1:21:44] father not take something that's been
[1:21:46] created break something from it and
[1:21:48] multiply creation but absolutely create
[1:21:51] showing that he's the same jehovah that
[1:21:53] stood back there and said let there be
[1:21:55] light and there was light his word was
[1:21:58] made manifest when he was made flesh on
[1:22:00] earth he took his original creation
[1:22:02] broke it back and multiplied it but now
[1:22:05] in the last days when he comes down
[1:22:07] among us again the same light that moved
[1:22:09] down said let there be light see just
[1:22:12] speak the creation into existence
[1:22:14] greater than this will you do for i go
[1:22:16] to my father remember we're at these
[1:22:19] times
[1:22:20] so who was it that came shalom jesus
[1:22:23] christ himself amen who was it that
[1:22:26] could create could speak and create amen
[1:22:28] it was a body of flesh but it wasn't the
[1:22:31] body of flesh did it it was jesus christ
[1:22:33] who was hiding in that body of flesh
[1:22:36] showing that it was jehovah the same one
[1:22:40] that said let there be light was the
[1:22:42] same one that could speak and it come
[1:22:45] into existence he was using the lips in
[1:22:48] the body of a mortal man it wasn't the
[1:22:50] mortal man it was the life inside the
[1:22:53] mortal man
[1:22:55] now let's go to paragraph 266 all the
[1:22:58] way back
[1:23:00] on page 44.
[1:23:03] just want to drop this in i thought this
[1:23:05] was super timely
[1:23:09] paragraph 266.
[1:23:12] and we all know that's the
[1:23:14] identification we know what the third
[1:23:15] pool is we all we all understand that
[1:23:18] now you got it you'll have it the tape
[1:23:20] and i think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:23:22] little while until the great hour of
[1:23:24] persecution comes on
[1:23:26] that's when it be it'll speak it'll be
[1:23:29] manifest just like the five straight
[1:23:31] signs without failure perfectly and now
[1:23:34] i think just wait see to see what it
[1:23:36] done
[1:23:37] will it be manifest
[1:23:39] when when this great persecution comes
[1:23:41] down
[1:23:42] so brother branham won't be here
[1:23:45] so where will it be manifest
[1:23:48] so when it's manifest if it's like this
[1:23:50] he said like the straight five times if
[1:23:52] it's like that it could be creating an
[1:23:55] act of creation
[1:23:58] then who would it be
[1:24:00] would it be the lips of it would be the
[1:24:02] lips and body of human beings on the
[1:24:04] earth and the bride but it wouldn't be
[1:24:06] those human beings it would be jesus
[1:24:08] christ himself in bride form
[1:24:12] it would be the same jehovah driver that
[1:24:14] said let there be light if it would
[1:24:15] manifest again in a body of believers it
[1:24:18] won't be the body of believers but it'll
[1:24:20] be the same jehovah gyra in a body of
[1:24:24] believers
[1:24:26] that's why you can't take this upon
[1:24:28] yourself and just do it it's got to be
[1:24:30] by permission because it's him it's not
[1:24:32] you it's not your this is not the power
[1:24:34] of your vocal cords amen it's him saying
[1:24:38] it's time you speak and when you speak
[1:24:41] it happens because he's got us under
[1:24:43] total control by preeminence
[1:24:48] that's what he had in the prophet he had
[1:24:50] preeminence
[1:24:51] that's what he had in jesus christ and
[1:24:53] that's what he's going to have in us
[1:24:56] we can't surrender enough friends
[1:24:58] we can't die out enough we can't
[1:25:00] surrender enough we can't give up enough
[1:25:03] amen i can't get there fast enough
[1:25:07] amen but it's going to take a total
[1:25:09] surrender
[1:25:12] question
[1:25:13] what did they kill jesus for
[1:25:16] let's go to paragraph 184
[1:25:22] and i'm going to turn in the bible here
[1:25:23] to john 10 i want to read out of john 10
[1:25:26] verse 30.
[1:25:28] john chapter 10 verse 30 and 33 just to
[1:25:31] get the context of what brother is going
[1:25:33] to say
[1:25:35] verse 30 jesus says i and my father are
[1:25:38] one
[1:25:39] then the jews took up stones again to
[1:25:41] stone him
[1:25:43] jesus answered them many good works have
[1:25:45] i showed you from my father for which of
[1:25:47] these works do you stone me the jews
[1:25:49] answered him saying for a good work we
[1:25:51] stone thee not but for blasphemy and
[1:25:53] because that thou being a man maketh
[1:25:55] thyself god
[1:26:00] i want to ask you a question
[1:26:03] when brother venom talked about
[1:26:04] squirrels
[1:26:05] and an act of creation and said it's the
[1:26:07] same jesus christ
[1:26:09] who did he make himself
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:18] all right paragraph 184
[1:26:21] jesus brother ben answers the question
[1:26:22] for us what did they kill jesus for you
[1:26:25] being a man make yourself god
[1:26:31] brother brahm said when they go to say
[1:26:33] when you go to say my father and i are
[1:26:35] one and them other things they'll take
[1:26:37] up stones to stone them
[1:26:39] the shuck will pull away
[1:26:41] from the wheat
[1:26:43] they won't like it
[1:26:46] 185 you got my message on three types of
[1:26:49] believers
[1:26:50] how that one stood there there was the
[1:26:52] make believers they followed along for a
[1:26:54] while making out like they believed and
[1:26:56] one day jesus said to them what will you
[1:26:58] think when the son of man which is from
[1:27:00] heaven ascends back into heaven and come
[1:27:02] from heaven going back to heaven
[1:27:04] why the multitude walked away and said
[1:27:06] this is a hard saying then there come
[1:27:08] the make-believer that was walking with
[1:27:10] him the 70 and they got something hard
[1:27:12] they didn't see that they didn't know
[1:27:14] the sympathy they didn't know the
[1:27:16] promise that this child was jehovah
[1:27:19] they saw the miracles they saw the signs
[1:27:23] the wonders the works but they missed
[1:27:25] the word that this was jehovah
[1:27:29] his name shall be called counselor
[1:27:30] prince of peace the mighty god and when
[1:27:32] he said when when i ascend up to heaven
[1:27:33] from which i came well they said this is
[1:27:36] a hard saying who can understand we know
[1:27:38] you're just a man we eat with you we
[1:27:40] sleep with you we're in the woods with
[1:27:42] you we're by the waters with you well
[1:27:43] you're merely a man and say the son of
[1:27:45] man goes back to where you come from
[1:27:47] what will you say this is a hard saying
[1:27:49] see they didn't know the beat they
[1:27:52] didn't know the rhythm of the sympathy
[1:27:53] of god's word that he was god manifest
[1:27:56] in the flesh for he was the vindicated
[1:27:58] word light of the hour they didn't get
[1:28:01] it they said this is a hard thing who
[1:28:03] could understand this and they turned
[1:28:05] away they didn't know the beat
[1:28:09] then when we notice again there was a
[1:28:11] judas the make-believer or the
[1:28:12] unbeliever that waited till he found a
[1:28:14] fault then he turned to the disciples in
[1:28:16] just the twelve and judas was one of
[1:28:18] them he said you want to go too
[1:28:20] then peter said who would we go to lord
[1:28:22] you're the composer
[1:28:26] peter was reading from something else
[1:28:28] you're the composer you know how it's
[1:28:30] going on you're the only one that has
[1:28:32] the word of life where could we turn to
[1:28:35] we couldn't go back to the pharisee or a
[1:28:37] sadducee or the herodian or whatever it
[1:28:39] might be you're the one that has the
[1:28:41] word of life we have no other place to
[1:28:43] go we've joined ourselves to this great
[1:28:46] concert we are in here we're listening
[1:28:48] and we're in the rhythm we believe that
[1:28:50] you are the son of god the manifest of
[1:28:52] jehovah we're sure of this we don't know
[1:28:54] what these great trials and troubles and
[1:28:56] afflictions and things and you say
[1:28:58] you're going up to be offered up
[1:29:00] and all this that and the other on the
[1:29:02] third day all this stuff we don't
[1:29:03] understand that but we're in listen to
[1:29:06] god's sympathy we're part of it and
[1:29:08] we're waiting to see what takes place
[1:29:10] next and we're following close with you
[1:29:12] oh my that's what i want to do
[1:29:16] i want to be in the rhythm of it so i
[1:29:17] know that this part is of god well what
[1:29:20] about this question answer this for me
[1:29:22] brother chad how will this be i don't
[1:29:24] know but i'm in the sympathy and i know
[1:29:26] this is right and i'm not leaving it i'm
[1:29:28] just marching along and i'm going to
[1:29:30] catch every change of the beast every
[1:29:32] change in the music i can't answer the
[1:29:34] questions now but they're going to come
[1:29:36] a time i can answer that question
[1:29:39] but if you leave now you'll never answer
[1:29:41] the question
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:45] judas left and couldn't answer some
[1:29:47] questions
[1:29:48] amen but peter stayed and he could
[1:29:50] answer all the questions
[1:29:53] you got to stay with the music you got
[1:29:55] to get in the rhythm and know this is
[1:29:57] beating according to the word
[1:29:59] so far this is the word this is beating
[1:30:02] according to the word i'm sticking with
[1:30:04] it because this is i'm in the symphony
[1:30:06] this is on the sheet music i'm in the
[1:30:08] rhythm and i've caught it and i'm not
[1:30:10] leaving this amen everything else will
[1:30:12] be answered if i stay with the composer
[1:30:14] and stay with the music
[1:30:17] praise be to god
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:24] question number four
[1:30:26] what are the growing pains of his grace
[1:30:29] i like this section

[1:30:34] a little section and then jump over
[1:30:37] what are the growing pains of his grace
[1:30:40] paragraph 201 i want to grab this for
[1:30:42] context this doesn't necessarily answer
[1:30:44] the question but it lays a good
[1:30:46] foundation many people ask why
[1:30:50] they ask they ask sometimes they ask me
[1:30:51] why why must think these things happen
[1:30:55] why why did this happen to me why did i
[1:30:57] start and this happened i had this
[1:30:59] trouble here this upset me here and i
[1:31:02] lost this here
[1:31:04] sometimes i've asked why why when i was
[1:31:06] just a young minister first started out
[1:31:07] did god take my wife right out from
[1:31:09] under me take my baby right from beneath
[1:31:11] me right from beneath my heart
[1:31:14] why did he do that i didn't know i do
[1:31:16] now
[1:31:17] i just held my hand in his and kept
[1:31:19] trusting
[1:31:20] he knows every junction he knows the
[1:31:22] rhythm when it must take place he knows
[1:31:25] what it takes to mold you he knows what
[1:31:27] kind of material he's going to use see
[1:31:29] the back side of the desert sometimes
[1:31:31] where god molds righteous men into sages
[1:31:33] and prophets see
[1:31:34] see that's where men are beat out men
[1:31:36] are beat out in the word when they got
[1:31:38] all kind of creed and stuff in them let
[1:31:40] them come to the word and god beats it
[1:31:42] right out of them molds it right into
[1:31:44] this into the great sympathy with of his
[1:31:47] word see and then they see the word
[1:31:49] moving on
[1:31:52] now let's jump over to paragraph 216.
[1:32:00] you say brother branham
[1:32:03] paragraph 216.
[1:32:04] brother branham what about my mother my
[1:32:06] dad what about my people what about my
[1:32:07] denomination what will they do they'll
[1:32:10] cast me on if you can't look ahead look
[1:32:13] up don't try to look ahead anyway put
[1:32:14] your hand in his let him lead you look
[1:32:17] up don't look ahead you say why why
[1:32:19] others make fun of me about my long hair
[1:32:21] am i taking off shorts and about my
[1:32:23] leaving the church huh suffering for his
[1:32:26] namesake is growing pains of his grace
[1:32:29] there's the answer to our question
[1:32:31] suffering for his namesake is growing
[1:32:32] pains of his grace yes suffering for his
[1:32:35] word see is growing pains of his grace
[1:32:38] yes sir just remember it's the grace of
[1:32:40] god has been given to you
[1:32:43] have you ever suffered for his word
[1:32:45] that's growing pains of his grace
[1:32:49] like paul said hallelujah he had an
[1:32:51] infirmity something was bothering him
[1:32:53] the devil would buffet him blow after
[1:32:55] blow he consulted the lord three times
[1:32:57] to take it away from him i don't want
[1:32:59] this lord take it away from me and then
[1:33:01] one night the lord spoke to him said
[1:33:03] saul or paul my grace is sufficient he
[1:33:06] said then i'll glory in my infirmity
[1:33:07] i'll glory in it i know you're the
[1:33:09] healer i've seen you heal the sick raise
[1:33:11] the dead cast out devils open the eyes
[1:33:12] of the blind but if i've consulted you
[1:33:15] and you tell me it's your grace is
[1:33:16] sufficient then this devil that bothers
[1:33:18] me is the growing pains of your grace
[1:33:21] then all glory glory and my infirmities
[1:33:23] why if lest i get exalted above the
[1:33:25] abundance of revelation see
[1:33:27] see he had something the other disciples
[1:33:29] didn't have he saw him after his death
[1:33:31] burial resurrection and ascension he saw
[1:33:34] him some of them say well i walked with
[1:33:36] him so did everybody on the street but
[1:33:38] after he was dead buried rose ascended
[1:33:40] up and returned back in the form of
[1:33:42] pillar of fire he talked to paul that
[1:33:44] was more than any of the rest of them
[1:33:45] had
[1:33:47] he said except i get exalted and want to
[1:33:49] build great big seminaries and
[1:33:50] everything else and great big something
[1:33:52] another lest i get exalted above the
[1:33:54] abundance of this revelation god let a
[1:33:56] messenger of the devil keep me beat down
[1:34:00] i just want to tell you something
[1:34:01] friends
[1:34:04] if you think
[1:34:05] that god's given you a greater
[1:34:07] revelation
[1:34:08] then hold on
[1:34:11] because god always works in equity
[1:34:14] he doesn't ever let anything get out of
[1:34:16] balance
[1:34:18] and that's why as the bride comes closer
[1:34:20] and closer into the image of jesus
[1:34:22] christ with greater and greater
[1:34:23] revelation on the word and power there's
[1:34:25] going to be greater and greater
[1:34:26] tightening up because god keeps
[1:34:28] everything in equity
[1:34:31] and we wonder like we get we take
[1:34:33] spiritual growth and then we have
[1:34:34] natural problems
[1:34:36] car breaks down financial problems uh
[1:34:39] hurtful things in families hurtful
[1:34:40] things in churches things that happen
[1:34:43] why because god keeps everything in
[1:34:45] equity he's never going to let you get
[1:34:47] puffed up or elevated because god loves
[1:34:50] you and wants you to have the right kind
[1:34:51] of character that it takes to manage the
[1:34:54] revelation that comes
[1:34:55] you know like why is it always like just
[1:34:57] when things get a little bit better
[1:34:59] naturally speaking we get crushed back
[1:35:01] down we get a little bit of money in
[1:35:02] savings and the car breaks down
[1:35:05] things go smooth just a little bit and
[1:35:07] somebody else starts a fuss and a fight
[1:35:09] or something else happens in the church
[1:35:11] what is it friends it's god keeping
[1:35:13] equity
[1:35:15] it's growing pains of grace it means
[1:35:17] there's an attack against us all of a
[1:35:19] sudden somebody says something for what
[1:35:20] i believe in hey it's growing pains of
[1:35:22] his grace and it breaks your heart and
[1:35:24] it rakes you down and puts you on your
[1:35:26] knees to pray why because with a
[1:35:28] revelation there has to be a character
[1:35:31] to handle the revelation god keeps
[1:35:33] everything in equity
[1:35:36] so when those things happen and troubles
[1:35:38] in the church and troubles from outside
[1:35:40] and troubles from family and troubles at
[1:35:41] work and all kinds of accusations and
[1:35:44] all kinds of hurtful things just let it
[1:35:46] have its way let it do what it's
[1:35:48] supposed to do go to your knees and say
[1:35:50] god i submit to the trial
[1:35:53] keep me humble keep me pure
[1:35:58] god let a messenger of the devil keep me
[1:35:59] beat down he said
[1:36:01] then when i'm weak
[1:36:03] i'm strong
[1:36:05] i think that's where god wants us is
[1:36:07] totally dependent
[1:36:09] when i'm weak i'm strong amen amen
[1:36:11] growing pains of his grace amen he could
[1:36:13] stay on that a long time an hour and 45
[1:36:15] minutes has passed and we're suffering
[1:36:17] his grace pains
[1:36:19] oh he may let crossroads he may permit
[1:36:22] crossroads to try us to perfect us for
[1:36:24] his service
[1:36:25] he may permit that now church
[1:36:28] both here and on tape he may permit the
[1:36:30] crossroads for our service
[1:36:32] like he did daniel he give daniel a
[1:36:34] little crossroads one day you know he
[1:36:35] was a great man down in babylon he did
[1:36:37] he let the king turn against him and
[1:36:39] throw him in the lion's den it only
[1:36:41] perfected him did you catch that
[1:36:44] he let the king turn against him
[1:36:48] so daniel never cursed the king and he
[1:36:51] never said evil things about the wise
[1:36:53] men and influenced them because god let
[1:36:54] it happen
[1:36:57] we've got to focus our vision and make
[1:36:59] it a scriptural vision to have a
[1:37:01] scriptural response
[1:37:03] [Applause]
[1:37:04] do you never say daniel say them nasty
[1:37:07] them horrible wise men they've always
[1:37:09] been out to give me and that king used
[1:37:11] to be my friend he just submitted he'd
[1:37:14] submitted to the trial i mean he did
[1:37:16] what he always did knowing he didn't try
[1:37:18] to bypass it he did what he always did
[1:37:21] and prayed knowing what result would
[1:37:23] come but he put himself in god's hands
[1:37:25] he didn't try to take care of himself
[1:37:26] and whatever god permitted he allowed
[1:37:30] and daniel submitted to it and god give
[1:37:33] it a supernatural protection and when
[1:37:35] god took daniel out of the lions then
[1:37:37] daniel did not have to make things right
[1:37:40] god made things right
[1:37:43] god proved the heart of the king amen
[1:37:45] when he moved on the wise men and
[1:37:47] blinded the king to their to their ideas
[1:37:50] to get daniel in the lion's den he just
[1:37:52] as quickly opened that king's eyes to
[1:37:55] put the wise men in the lion den
[1:37:58] the bride does not have to defend
[1:38:00] herself everything that comes comes for
[1:38:02] a purpose and if there's any reward to
[1:38:05] be meted out god will meet it out all we
[1:38:08] have to do is love be kind amen and
[1:38:11] submit to whatever god has for us
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:19] he let the king turn against him and
[1:38:21] throw him in the lion's den it only
[1:38:23] perfected him
[1:38:25] sure did
[1:38:26] let the hebrew children go into the
[1:38:28] fiery furnace they was determined to
[1:38:30] stand for his word
[1:38:31] he may permit crosswords let them laugh
[1:38:34] at you and having long hair let them
[1:38:36] laugh at you for saying why you become a
[1:38:38] holy roller or whatever more it may be
[1:38:40] they may let you laugh they may laugh at
[1:38:42] you for that
[1:38:44] but that's all right that's a crossroad
[1:38:46] that's a junction that's to prove
[1:38:48] something
[1:38:50] see he says he may permit crosswords but
[1:38:53] he means crossroads
[1:38:55] let them laugh at you
[1:38:58] who let who do what
[1:39:01] so god let them laugh at you
[1:39:06] have you had somebody laugh at you for
[1:39:07] what you believe
[1:39:09] who let them laugh at you
[1:39:12] and if they stayed alive while they were
[1:39:14] laughing at you for staying with the
[1:39:15] word then god permitted it
[1:39:18] and don't fight it
[1:39:21] just let it be let it let it work
[1:39:22] whatever god wants it to work
[1:39:24] that's to prove something paragraph 2 26
[1:39:27] the only thing that the crossroads did
[1:39:29] to the hebrew children that stood on the
[1:39:30] word it only loosed them from the bands
[1:39:32] that had around their feet and legs
[1:39:36] and sometimes it takes the hard trials
[1:39:37] to break the bands of the world off of
[1:39:39] us
[1:39:40] sometimes god lets us have a little
[1:39:42] trial you know to see what we'll do to
[1:39:44] take you out of the world
[1:39:46] or other words let you have a little
[1:39:48] trial knock you out of that organization
[1:39:50] and that idea that the method is the
[1:39:52] only one the baptist or the pentecostal
[1:39:54] that's the only group that they got if
[1:39:56] you don't believe it like my church
[1:39:57] believes it you don't believe it at all
[1:39:59] sometimes he lets a little trial happen
[1:40:02] maybe you get a sick baby maybe
[1:40:04] something takes place right at the hour
[1:40:05] of death maybe someone taken from you or
[1:40:08] something what's it to do to break you
[1:40:10] away to show you something open your
[1:40:12] eyes maybe you come to criticize
[1:40:14] sometime maybe you're listening to this
[1:40:16] tape just to criticize
[1:40:19] maybe god's doing that to break some of
[1:40:21] the worldly bands that's got you bound
[1:40:23] down
[1:40:24] praise god let the trial work friends
[1:40:27] let the crossroads do what they're
[1:40:29] supposed to do sometimes we get too
[1:40:31] caught up in this life and the things of
[1:40:34] this life and god lets the little
[1:40:35] crossroads come a little junction come
[1:40:38] amen just so we'll go back to our knees
[1:40:40] and surrender once again
[1:40:42] just so he can break another little hold
[1:40:44] off that we didn't even realize was
[1:40:45] holding on to us
[1:40:47] if you're a child of god and you say
[1:40:50] every time i move forward something
[1:40:52] happens and every time something breaks
[1:40:54] something happens since they praise god
[1:40:56] he loves me and he's perfecting me
[1:41:00] don't fight against god don't get angry
[1:41:02] with god and don't get angry with goals
[1:41:04] that god lets laugh at
[1:41:06] don't get angry at those that god let's
[1:41:08] throw you in the lion's den
[1:41:10] don't fight anybody
[1:41:15] just let god have his way
[1:41:18] let's turn to paragraph 242 there's just
[1:41:20] a couple things i want to bring out
[1:41:23] that i found to be really amazing
[1:41:27] paragraph 242 actually we're going to
[1:41:28] start a pair of 240.
[1:41:30] i just want to catch brother branham's
[1:41:32] attitude i love his attitude
[1:41:35] this was a this was a
[1:41:37] a son of god that came to harvest
[1:41:40] maturity
[1:41:41] the first one it was a wave chief
[1:41:43] offering and i just love the way he
[1:41:45] handles things paragraph 240 they was
[1:41:47] the one that said over there in a
[1:41:49] meeting that i claimed to be jesus
[1:41:51] christ that the holy father was over me
[1:41:53] the pillar of fire and i was jesus
[1:41:54] christ that's the millerites or the
[1:41:56] seventh-day adventist they made that
[1:41:58] statement that he said that then let's
[1:42:00] go down to paragraph 246 242.
[1:42:04] but their speaker a while ago nice
[1:42:05] program i have nothing against him i'd
[1:42:07] do anything i could to help them forgive
[1:42:09] them freely for saying it because they
[1:42:11] did say something that wasn't right
[1:42:14] brother ben said forgive them freely for
[1:42:17] saying it
[1:42:19] they were accusing him of preaching
[1:42:20] false doctrine they were accruing of him
[1:42:23] claiming to be jesus christ and that the
[1:42:25] holy father was over him the pillar of
[1:42:27] fire and that he was jesus christ they
[1:42:29] were making an accusation that would
[1:42:30] ruin his ministry
[1:42:33] but he said
[1:42:35] i have nothing against them
[1:42:37] i'd do anything i could to help them
[1:42:40] forgive them freely for saying it
[1:42:42] because they did say something that
[1:42:44] wasn't right
[1:42:45] but that's all right their doctrine is
[1:42:47] just like jehovah's witness and
[1:42:48] christian science and all these other
[1:42:50] cults you see same thing but notice
[1:42:52] they're just like any other organization
[1:42:55] they're no more wrong i guess than the
[1:42:57] rest of them
[1:42:59] that's baptist methodist catholic
[1:43:01] brotherhood just lumped them all
[1:43:02] together
[1:43:05] that means baptist doctrine is not going
[1:43:06] to save you any more than jehovah's
[1:43:09] witness or christian science our
[1:43:11] seventh-day adventist
[1:43:15] no more wrong i guess than the rest of
[1:43:16] them the words always write see it'll
[1:43:18] prove itself outright
[1:43:20] so if you're staying on the word you
[1:43:22] have nothing to prove the word will
[1:43:23] prove itself outright you have nothing
[1:43:25] to defend you have nothing to fight for
[1:43:27] you just stand on the word and the word
[1:43:29] will prove itself outright
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:33] let's go to paragraph 2
[1:43:35] 68.
[1:43:42] in the same vein brother talking about
[1:43:44] forgiveness that was somebody who spoke
[1:43:46] evil about him said something they
[1:43:48] taught wrong and he forgave them freely
[1:43:51] now paragraph 268 remember see i have to
[1:43:53] watch when i seen them people just
[1:43:55] completely arrogantly walk away
[1:43:58] i think i've tried to express it this
[1:43:59] morning it's gross darkness upon them
[1:44:02] they can't help it
[1:44:03] i forgive them c for not listening
[1:44:08] brother abraham had to fight through to
[1:44:10] this position
[1:44:12] because remember when he preached
[1:44:13] standing in the gap in 1963 he had got
[1:44:16] his feelings hurt amen and he built up a
[1:44:19] complex because they weren't listening
[1:44:20] to him
[1:44:22] and he wanted to go on to the wilderness
[1:44:24] and and god chastised him and dealt with
[1:44:26] him he said you'll be a bomb and your
[1:44:27] wife will leave you and he went through
[1:44:28] this whole experience and come
[1:44:30] back and pre-standing in the gap and
[1:44:32] says now i'm still pre-standing and i'm
[1:44:34] explaining he said my and i'm still not
[1:44:36] right
[1:44:38] my attitude's still not right
[1:44:41] because i think they still i think they
[1:44:42] ought to have heard me
[1:44:43] but he worked his way through that to
[1:44:45] get to this point
[1:44:47] so when i've seen them people just
[1:44:49] completely arrogantly walking away i
[1:44:50] think i've tried to express it this
[1:44:52] morning it's gross darkness upon them
[1:44:54] they can't help it
[1:44:56] i forgive them see for not listening
[1:44:59] and seeing the things that god has done
[1:45:01] still they don't do it i still pray god
[1:45:04] forgive them and i mean it from my heart
[1:45:07] don't say it because my master said it
[1:45:09] but i want to feel it in my heart first
[1:45:12] that i really do
[1:45:13] i don't isolate myself from people i
[1:45:16] don't want to do that see
[1:45:18] because i have a message for them
[1:45:21] salvation
[1:45:23] what's brother branham's message it's
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:28] salvation have to go out among them now
[1:45:31] i go out with the trinitarians with the
[1:45:33] methodist baptist lutherans pentecostal
[1:45:35] seventh day adventist and everything
[1:45:36] else because i'm seeking to save that
[1:45:39] which was lost if i can
[1:45:41] so where is he going he's going amount
[1:45:44] among the denominations to save that
[1:45:46] which is lost
[1:45:48] because he's got a message of salvation
[1:45:51] what do we have a message of salvation
[1:45:56] well i've got the message
[1:45:57] you believe this after you're saved
[1:46:00] no this message is salvation
[1:46:03] and this day this message is salvation
[1:46:07] that's why brother bradham wouldn't let
[1:46:09] the hurt pull him away and isolate
[1:46:11] himself they didn't listen he said it's
[1:46:13] gross darkness they couldn't help it i
[1:46:16] forgive them and i pray to god god
[1:46:18] father forgive them
[1:46:21] oh i love that attitude friends that's
[1:46:23] the attitude we need to have regardless
[1:46:25] of what somebody says i mean it doesn't
[1:46:27] matter if they're on the outside or on
[1:46:29] the inside whatever they say against
[1:46:31] them freely forgive them
[1:46:33] god keeps a good record and god keeps
[1:46:35] things in equity but you know what i
[1:46:37] don't even want them judged i want
[1:46:39] brother branham's attitude we'll say god
[1:46:42] forgive them
[1:46:43] i don't want them judged i don't want
[1:46:45] them lost i don't want them hurt i want
[1:46:47] them forgiven
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] that's the right attitude friends that's
[1:46:51] the attitude we have to have so many
[1:46:53] times well they don't listen to me well
[1:46:55] you're cruising for a bruising buddy
[1:46:56] brother branham didn't have that
[1:46:58] attitude
[1:47:00] his attitude was father forgive him i
[1:47:02] forgive them i hold no odd against him i
[1:47:05] forgive him and now father you forgive
[1:47:07] them because brother benham knew that
[1:47:08] his forgiveness alone wasn't it god had
[1:47:10] to forgive him too because they didn't
[1:47:11] just reject him they rejected god
[1:47:14] and the same thing's true today amen
[1:47:17] before god can forgive them you have to
[1:47:19] forgive
[1:47:20] them sir and then pray that god will
[1:47:23] forgive them
[1:47:25] that's the right attitude friends that's
[1:47:27] what this shalom message brings that's
[1:47:30] what this life of jesus christ in the
[1:47:32] bride that's the kind of attitude it
[1:47:34] brings
[1:47:36] praise god
[1:47:38] we could go on that a long time but
[1:47:40] praise god we'll pick it up sunday
[1:47:43] let's look at paragraph 246
[1:47:45] a line down here with just a couple
[1:47:47] points i want to draw out
[1:47:52] 246.
[1:47:57] i just want to look at this shalom this
[1:47:59] light this good morning
[1:48:00] before we
[1:48:02] finish this message
[1:48:04] look if the bible tells us of these
[1:48:05] things this that is to come speaks of
[1:48:07] all these hours that we've passed
[1:48:09] through the days of noah's predicted the
[1:48:11] days of all these others the scripture
[1:48:13] predicted
[1:48:14] the days of martin luther was predicted
[1:48:16] the days of wesley the days of
[1:48:17] pentecostal this hour that we're living
[1:48:20] in was predicted everything happened
[1:48:22] just exactly the way it was
[1:48:24] what is it it's the spoken word of god
[1:48:26] which is vindicated by god makes it the
[1:48:29] light of the hour
[1:48:31] it's not the light of the hour because
[1:48:33] you say it's the light of the hour
[1:48:35] it won the light hour just because
[1:48:36] brother branham said it was the light of
[1:48:38] the hour it's the spoken word of god
[1:48:40] which is vindicated by god
[1:48:43] makes it the light of the hour
[1:48:46] see brother all the way back at the
[1:48:47] beginning of the message he laid down
[1:48:49] this he said when god spoke the spoken
[1:48:51] word of god said let there be light but
[1:48:53] it wasn't light until the light come
[1:48:56] into manifestation then it was
[1:48:58] vindicated word and that's the way it is
[1:49:01] there's scriptures written for this day
[1:49:03] and god has to vindicate it and when
[1:49:05] that word is vindicated it's the light
[1:49:08] of the hour
[1:49:13] just
[1:49:14] okay let's read that again what is it
[1:49:16] it's the spoken word of god which is
[1:49:18] vindicated by god makes it the light of
[1:49:19] our just like the sun is that's what i
[1:49:21] just explained when the word the word
[1:49:24] itself is the light when it's vindicated
[1:49:26] for the time that it belongs to
[1:49:28] see it's vindicated then it's the light
[1:49:30] of the hour that's why he said luther's
[1:49:32] day won't work in this day and when
[1:49:34] wesley's light won't work in this day
[1:49:36] message it won't work because it's got
[1:49:38] to be
[1:49:39] the word itself is the light when it's
[1:49:42] vindicated for the time that it belongs
[1:49:44] to it's got to be the right word and the
[1:49:47] right time
[1:49:51] praise god
[1:49:54] all right see it's vindicated dennis the
[1:49:56] light of the hour
[1:49:58] john was the light he was more light
[1:49:59] than elijah and them had elijah he
[1:50:01] wasn't elijah's light but he was elijah
[1:50:03] in another form of vindicating the light
[1:50:06] he was and when jesus come he said he
[1:50:08] was a bright and shining light for a
[1:50:09] season you love to walk in the light and
[1:50:11] john said now i must dim out i must go
[1:50:14] out now my lights finish shining i must
[1:50:16] go out he must increase
[1:50:18] he's the light
[1:50:21] praise god
[1:50:23] john was the morning light
[1:50:25] and jesus was the sunlight
[1:50:29] brother branham was the morning light
[1:50:30] amen the seventh church age messenger
[1:50:33] amen but that one who came in the cloud
[1:50:35] was the light the shalom the good
[1:50:37] morning
[1:50:38] and where did he go he come down to be
[1:50:41] united with the bride the headstone on
[1:50:43] the body amen the body of jesus christ
[1:50:47] that's where the light is
[1:50:50] 249 he said i am the light of the world
[1:50:52] amen that's right the same yesterday
[1:50:54] today and forever and he's still the
[1:50:55] light of the world
[1:50:58] and what is he in the beginning was the
[1:51:00] word and the word was with god why was
[1:51:02] he the light of the world if he'd come
[1:51:04] said he was messiah and he didn't do
[1:51:06] like the bible said the messiah would do
[1:51:08] then he wasn't the light of the world
[1:51:10] see it's the vindicated word that makes
[1:51:12] it the light of the world
[1:51:14] and in this hour that we're living in
[1:51:16] now the vindicated word of this hour
[1:51:18] pentecostals you say speaking in tongues
[1:51:20] and so forth that was the day of
[1:51:22] pentecost that was the light of the hour
[1:51:24] then see this is another day he's the
[1:51:27] light of the hour today
[1:51:29] the seventh church age all smothered out
[1:51:31] with christ on the outside this has
[1:51:33] nothing to do with the church ages
[1:51:35] there's nothing to do with the laodicean
[1:51:37] church this is a new day this is the
[1:51:39] rising of the sun this is shalom
[1:51:42] now listen
[1:51:44] when he says this
[1:51:48] said why was he the light of the world
[1:51:50] this is in the middle of paragraph 249
[1:51:52] if he'd come and said he was a messiah
[1:51:54] and didn't do like the bible said the
[1:51:56] messiah would do then he wasn't the
[1:51:57] light of the world
[1:52:00] what if she says she's bride but doesn't
[1:52:02] do what the bible says the bride would
[1:52:03] do or be like the bible says the bride
[1:52:06] will be
[1:52:07] the prophet of god says she will be him
[1:52:10] she will be in his very likeness and
[1:52:11] what if she takes a an angry contentious
[1:52:17] hateful unforgiving attitude she
[1:52:18] wouldn't be the bride
[1:52:20] because it wouldn't be the vindicated
[1:52:22] word
[1:52:22] [Applause]
[1:52:24] we understand now you can say we're
[1:52:27] bright all we want but it's got to be
[1:52:29] vindicated by the life that's living out
[1:52:31] the word it's got to be the same life
[1:52:33] that was in jesus christ has to be the
[1:52:34] same life that's in the bride what we
[1:52:36] saw on the wave sheave we need to see
[1:52:39] and the rest of the grain that comes to
[1:52:41] maturity so you've got to do what the
[1:52:43] word says shall do and be like what the
[1:52:45] word says shall be like
[1:52:48] let's turn over to paragraph 260. on
[1:52:50] page 43
[1:52:52] the middle of the page page period 260.
[1:52:55] the word of moses time did not work in
[1:52:56] the days of jesus time the word the word
[1:52:59] in the days of the apostles does not
[1:53:00] work in this day
[1:53:02] it's a promised word for this day
[1:53:04] they said themselves and spoken by the
[1:53:05] holy ghost what would take place in the
[1:53:07] last days how the churches would be
[1:53:09] heady highminded how the would
[1:53:11] rise up and the harlots would be right
[1:53:13] with her how they would be dark and
[1:53:15] dark in the earth in the last church age
[1:53:17] the laodicean jesus would be completely
[1:53:19] taken from the church
[1:53:21] oh lord let me stay with him the word
[1:53:23] and manifest his light through all of us
[1:53:26] as we set forth in this new year with a
[1:53:28] determination not knowing what this new
[1:53:30] year holds but we're holding to him the
[1:53:32] word that knows the whole sympathy from
[1:53:35] the beginning to the end he knows every
[1:53:37] move in every junction and lord we're
[1:53:39] just watching him keeping our eyes on
[1:53:41] him the word
[1:53:43] then when we see these things appear we
[1:53:45] know that we're right in the rhythm of
[1:53:47] the word granted
[1:53:49] i want to pull three phrases out of
[1:53:51] those just couple sentences i read in
[1:53:53] paragraph 261
[1:53:54] first sentence let me stay with him
[1:53:57] the word
[1:54:00] go down a couple lines but we're holding
[1:54:02] to him
[1:54:03] the word
[1:54:05] a few more lines keeping our eyes on him
[1:54:08] the word
[1:54:11] what is the word it's him
[1:54:13] who is he the word and not the word in
[1:54:16] another day that was him too but to have
[1:54:18] him you've got to find him today which
[1:54:20] is the manifested word today
[1:54:23] and that's him
[1:54:24] praise be to god
[1:54:26] let's look at paragraph 232
[1:54:34] i want to close with this
[1:54:37] paragraph 230 to you
[1:54:40] the dawning of a new day i feel it all
[1:54:43] over me now

[1:54:50] i feel it all over me now the light of a
[1:54:52] new day the light of a day where there
[1:54:54] is no night there is no darkness no
[1:54:57] shadows no skies no dim dark skies no
[1:55:00] midnight no graves no flowers on the
[1:55:01] hillside no funeral processions no
[1:55:03] doctors no more gay men i can feel the
[1:55:06] rays of his light breaking through upon
[1:55:08] my soul
[1:55:10] the new day the old one is pressing away
[1:55:15] as i feel the mortal blood pouring
[1:55:17] through my body i feel the surge of the
[1:55:19] holy ghost coming behind it rise and
[1:55:22] shine
[1:55:24] hallelujah can you feel it is this your
[1:55:26] new day experience praise god because if
[1:55:28] you can experience the rays of the light
[1:55:30] striking your soul then you're going to
