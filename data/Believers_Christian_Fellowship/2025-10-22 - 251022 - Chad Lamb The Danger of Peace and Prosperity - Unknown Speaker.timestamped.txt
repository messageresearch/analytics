[0:00] As I climb this gospel ladder, always
[0:03] heeding every sign. And I know my
[0:06] Savior's with me and he's teaching me to

[5:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd stand with me this or
[5:59] this evening while brother Chad comes.
[6:01] Let's go to the key of F.
[6:03] [Music]
[6:04] I know I am the bride that you're
[6:09] returning for.
[6:13] Dressed in garments wide and
[6:16] wrinklefree.
[6:20] I have no earthly love that I'm holding
[6:26] to.
[6:28] You're the one who means everything to
[6:32] me.
[6:35] I will sing.
[6:39] I will worship you.
[6:42] I will bow myself down humbly at your
[6:48] throne.
[6:50] I will give anything.
[6:54] I will give everything
[6:57] to you alone.
[6:59] [Music]
[7:06] You are the faithful God who keeps your
[7:10] covenant.
[7:12] There's not one thing you said you
[7:16] haven't done.
[7:20] And someday when I see you standing face
[7:25] to face,
[7:27] my praise for you will only have beun.
[7:34] I will sing.
[7:36] [Music]
[7:38] I will worship you.
[7:41] I will bow myself down at your throne.
[7:48] I will give anything.
[7:52] I will give everything
[7:55] to you. I will give anything.
[7:59] I will give anything.
[8:03] I will give everything
[8:06] to you, Lord.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[8:14] bow our heads together.
[8:16] Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father,
[8:19] because once again, Lord, you've
[8:21] gathered us together, given us the
[8:24] privilege of meeting like this, Lord, to
[8:26] worship you. And God, we've come to the
[8:28] time in the service, Lord, where we look
[8:30] into your word for instruction, for
[8:33] guidance, for life. God, we pray, God,
[8:36] that you would just open to us the word
[8:38] and open our understanding to understand
[8:40] the word. May you give us the eyes sav
[8:43] that we might see the hour in which we
[8:45] live. And God, give us a heart to
[8:47] perceive all that you're trying to say
[8:49] to us. And may this word be a lamp into
[8:51] our feet and a light into our path. May
[8:54] it guide us, Lord, in this journey that
[8:56] we're on. And God, I pray you would take
[8:58] the preeminent place among us as you
[9:00] come. May you sit at the head of the
[9:02] table. May you take the bread and break
[9:04] the bread. May you feed it to us now. We
[9:06] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[9:11] God bless you. Amen. God bless you.
[9:13] While you're standing, maybe we could
[9:15] take our Bibles to the book of First
[9:17] Corinthians. While you're turning there,
[9:19] I just wanted to let you know and remind
[9:21] you that um Brother Jordan and Sister
[9:23] Rebecca Simons and their baby that had
[9:26] passed away, they're going to have a
[9:28] memorial service tomorrow at their
[9:30] church uh um there in Saskatchewan. So,
[9:33] remember them in prayer, please. There's
[9:35] information on the bulletin boards if
[9:36] you'd like to know when and where you
[9:38] can log on to see that. They'll be
[9:39] streaming that. So, just remember to
[9:41] keep the family in prayer. I'm sure
[9:43] tomorrow will be a very tough day for
[9:45] them. Amen. Also, we've got some
[9:48] visitors here from Phoenix again. The
[9:50] Laos have their family again. So, God
[9:52] bless you. It's good to see you. They
[9:53] are no strangers to us. They've been
[9:54] here a few times, but it's good to have
[9:56] you always. So, God bless you all very
[9:58] much. And the Arts have a family member
[10:00] with them. They got a stepson, Karine.
[10:02] God bless you. It's good to have you
[10:03] guys. I have you here with them as well.
[10:05] So, God bless you. Amen. While we're
[10:07] standing, let's look at 1 Corinthians
[10:09] chapter 10.
[10:11] 1 Corinthians chapter 10.
[10:15] And we're going to read one verse here
[10:17] and then we'll have our seats. 1
[10:18] Corinthians
[10:20] 10 and 12.
[10:23] Wherefore let him that thinkketh he
[10:25] standeth take heed lest he fall.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; And God bless you as you have your
[10:30] seats. What an interesting scripture to
[10:33] start off with. Amen. And and just wait
[10:35] till you see my title. It gets even
[10:37] better. Amen. So if we want to bring up
[10:39] the PowerPoint there, we'll we'll take a
[10:42] look at the title. the danger of peace
[10:45] and prosperity.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll talk about this for a
[10:50] little bit. So, we just read,
[10:51] "Wherefore, let him that thinkketh he
[10:53] standeth take heed lest he fall." So,
[10:55] it's kind of dangerous to think that
[10:57] you're standing.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a dangerous position to be
[11:00] in to think that everything's okay.
[11:02] That's the danger of peace and
[11:03] prosperity. It's a very dangerous place
[11:05] to be. So, I'd like to talk about that
[11:07] just for a little while and take it as a
[11:09] warning from the scriptures. If you
[11:11] could turn with me to Deuteronomy. I
[11:13] want to catch another scripture here.
[11:15] Deuteronomy
[11:18] uh chapter 6. And keep your Bibles
[11:20] handy. We're going to read quite a few
[11:22] uh scripture passages this evening.
[11:26] Deuteronomy chapter 6
[11:29] and we're going to start at verse 10.
[11:32] Deuteronomy 6 and 10.
[11:36] And it shall be when the Lord thy God
[11:38] shall have brought thee into the land
[11:40] which he swore unto thy fathers, to
[11:42] Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
[11:44] thee great and goodly cities which thou
[11:47] buildest not, and houses full of all
[11:49] good things which thou filest not, and
[11:52] wells digged, which thou dst not digest
[11:54] not, vineyards and olive trees, which
[11:56] thou plantest not. Then when thou shalt
[12:00] have eaten and be full, then beware lest
[12:03] thou forget the Lord which brought thee
[12:06] forth out of the land of Egypt from the
[12:08] house of bondage.
[12:10] He promised to bring them into the land.
[12:13] He promised to give them the inheritance
[12:15] of the land. He promised to give them
[12:16] the cities that they didn't build. He
[12:18] promised to let them eat the crops that
[12:19] they didn't plant. He promised to give
[12:21] all this to them. But he gave them a
[12:22] warning with it. Beware when you eat
[12:25] till you're full and you're satisfied
[12:26] and you're in houses you didn't build
[12:28] full of good things that you didn't
[12:29] provide for. When you get all of there
[12:31] and you're full and you're satisfied,
[12:33] beware.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Lest you forget the Lord which brought
[12:37] thee forth out of the land of Egypt.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the place that's always
[12:41] been dangerous. And we realize that the
[12:43] children of Israel did exactly that.
[12:45] They got full. They got satisfied. They
[12:47] came into the promise of God and the
[12:48] blessings of God. And he promised to
[12:50] keep them in safety and drive out their
[12:52] enemies and be a shield of protection to
[12:54] them. And he did it. He promised to
[12:56] provide for them the the fruit of the
[12:58] land. He promised, Amen, that that all
[13:00] of their all of their uh uh youth shall
[13:03] lamb and all the she goats shall kid.
[13:05] And they promised that nothing shall
[13:07] cast forth its young and everything
[13:08] shall prosper. And it did.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; But under the prosperity, they forgot
[13:13] God and turned to idol worship to serve
[13:15] other gods. Amen. because it was so good
[13:18] that they forgot God.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; And that's the danger we live in. And we
[13:22] know we live in the Leodysian church
[13:23] age, which which is pleasure seeking,
[13:26] which tries to provide everything. And
[13:28] we live as human beings. Listen, we we
[13:31] we live most of our lives trying to make
[13:34] sure we're safe and secure and
[13:35] prosperous and everything's good.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; But God is so good at turning our basket
[13:40] upside down and shaking it out every
[13:42] once in a while because he knows what's
[13:44] best.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows what we need and he knows
[13:47] the danger of some of those things.
[13:50] Amen. The early church, Amen. They
[13:54] prospered under persecution.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[13:59] &gt;&gt; But when things were good and they began
[14:01] to settle down and then under
[14:02] Constantine and the Roman Empire when
[14:05] they got some security and they got some
[14:07] protection and they got some land and
[14:08] they got some buildings and they got
[14:10] some wealth and they got some acceptance
[14:12] and popularity, they forgot God.
[14:15] This is the pattern for humanity and
[14:17] it's something we must be wary of. Amen.
[14:20] When we look here at 2 Samuel 11, we're
[14:24] looking at the story of David, the life
[14:25] of David said, "And it came to pass
[14:27] after the year was expired at the time
[14:29] when kings go forth to battle that David
[14:32] sent Joab and his servants with him and
[14:34] all Israel and they destroyed the
[14:36] children of Aman and besieged Rabbi. But
[14:39] David terried still at Jerusalem.
[14:42] And it came to pass in an evening tide
[14:44] that David arose from off his bed and
[14:46] walked upon the roof of the king's
[14:48] house. From the roof he saw a woman
[14:50] washing herself and the woman was very
[14:52] beautiful to look upon. And we know this
[14:54] is David's temptation with Basheba and
[14:57] his fall. But what was the precursor to
[14:59] that is that David got secure in his
[15:01] kingdom and he got secure in his house
[15:03] and he sent forth others to go fight
[15:05] battles and in his safety and security
[15:08] and prosperity he fell.
[15:11] He was better running from cave to cave,
[15:13] being chased by Saul, than he was in the
[15:15] security of his own house.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; He was safer being persecuted, being
[15:20] rejected, fearing for his life. Amen. He
[15:23] was better off then than he was when he
[15:25] got in the prosperity and security of
[15:26] his own house.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The way we look at things sometime
[15:30] is the opposite. The way God looks at
[15:32] them. And what we call sa what we call
[15:34] dangerous is safe. And what we call safe
[15:36] sometimes is dangerous.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love preaching things like
[15:40] this because it's absolutely contrary to
[15:42] humanistic ideas. It's it's opposite of
[15:44] what we like to think. It is opposite of
[15:46] our culture. Amen. But I thank God that
[15:49] God doesn't care about our culture. He
[15:50] cares about us.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; And he gave us his word to protect us
[15:54] and keep us safe.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; David says this about Solomon in 1
[15:59] Chronicles. He said, "David said to
[16:01] Solomon, "My son, as for me, it was in
[16:04] my mind to build a house unto the name
[16:06] of the Lord my God. But the word of the
[16:08] Lord came to me, saying, Thou has shed
[16:10] blood abundantly, and has made great
[16:12] wars. Thou shalt not build a house unto
[16:15] my name, because thou has shed much
[16:16] blood upon the earth in my sight.
[16:18] Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who
[16:21] shall be a man of rest, and I will give
[16:23] him rest from all his enemies round
[16:25] about, for his name shall be Solomon,
[16:27] which means peace, and I will give peace
[16:29] and quietness unto Israel in his days."
[16:33] That sounds wonderful. Does that sound
[16:35] wonderful to you?
[16:37] It was wonderful, but it was the
[16:39] downfall of Solomon
[16:42] &gt;&gt; is what destroyed his life. The fact
[16:44] that he had peace and quietness all the
[16:46] days of his life. So when you read that
[16:48] and that promise is over your life, you
[16:50] think, "Oh, praise God. I'm not going to
[16:52] have any enemies and I'm going to have
[16:54] peace and quiet and all of Israel and
[16:56] everything's going to be fine." Amen.
[16:58] And God brought this word to pass. But
[17:01] for Solomon, Amen, it was his downfall.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn together to First Kings
[17:07] and look at First Kings chapter 10.
[17:22] First Kings 10:14.
[17:30] First Kings 10:14. Now the weight of
[17:32] gold that came to Solomon in one year
[17:34] was 63 score and six talons of gold. I
[17:38] thought that was an interesting number.
[17:40] 666 talons of gold. And that is a a huge
[17:46] amount of money. So a talent is about 75
[17:50] lbs. 666 talents. 666* 75 pound. Do you
[17:55] know how much gold is worth an ounce?
[17:57] It's over $2,000 somewhere. probably
[17:59] think around $2,200 an ounce. There's 16
[18:02] ounces in a pound. This is 75 pounds
[18:05] times 666. I'm not that good at math.
[18:08] But that's a lot of money. Every year
[18:12] I think I could handle that budget. I
[18:14] think I think you could too. Amen.
[18:17] Beside that, he had he had of the
[18:20] merchant men and the traffic of the
[18:22] spice merchants and of the kings of
[18:24] Arabia and the governors of the country.
[18:27] And King Solomon made 200 targets of
[18:29] beaten gold. 600 shekels of gold went to
[18:32] one target. And he made 300 shields of
[18:34] beaten gold. Uh three pound of gold went
[18:37] into one shield. And the king put them
[18:39] in the house of the force of Lebanon.
[18:41] Moreover, the king made a great throne
[18:43] of ivory overlaid it with the best gold.
[18:46] And the throne had six steps. On the top
[18:48] of the throne was round was round behind
[18:50] and there were stays on either side on
[18:52] the place of the seat. And two lions
[18:54] stood beside the stay. And 12 lions
[18:57] stood there on one on the one side and
[19:00] the other upon the six steps. There was
[19:02] not there was not the like made in any
[19:04] kingdom. And all King Solomon's drinking
[19:07] vessels were of gold. And all the
[19:09] vessels of the house of the forest of
[19:11] Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of
[19:13] silver. It was nothing accounted of in
[19:15] the days of Solomon. For the king had at
[19:18] sea a navy of Tarsus with a navy of
[19:21] Hyram. Once in three years came the navy
[19:23] of Tarsus, bringing gold and silver and
[19:26] ivory and apes and peacocks. So, King
[19:28] Solomon exceeded all the kings of the
[19:30] earth for riches and for wisdom. And all
[19:33] the earth sought to Solomon to hear his
[19:35] wisdom which God had put in his heart.
[19:37] And they brought every man his present,
[19:40] vessels of silver and vessels of gold
[19:42] and garments and armor and spices and
[19:44] horses and and mules and a rate year by
[19:47] year. And Solomon gathered together
[19:50] chariots and horsemen. He had a thousand
[19:52] and 400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen
[19:55] whom he bestowed in the cities for
[19:57] chariots and with the king at Jerusalem.
[19:59] And the king made silver to be in
[20:01] Jerusalem as stones. And cedars made he
[20:04] to be as the sycamore trees that are in
[20:06] the veil for abundance. And Solomon had
[20:08] horses brought out of Egypt and linen
[20:10] yarn for the king's merchants received
[20:12] the linen yarn at a price. And a chariot
[20:14] came up and went out of Egypt for 600
[20:17] shekels of silver and a a horse for 150.
[20:20] And so for all the kings of the
[20:22] Hittites, and for the kings of Syria did
[20:24] they bring them out by their means. So
[20:27] Solomon had, it's easy to say,
[20:30] everything.
[20:32] He was greater than all the kings of the
[20:33] earth for riches and for wisdom. He
[20:35] wasn't just rich. He was the wisest of
[20:37] all. He was the top of the world. He was
[20:41] on top of the world. No one was higher
[20:43] than Solomon on the earth in wisdom and
[20:46] his kingdom in grandeur and in riches.
[20:49] Nobody could beat him out. But let's
[20:51] look at chapter 11 verse one.
[20:55] But King Solomon loved many strange
[20:57] women together with the daughter of
[21:00] Pharaoh, women of the Moabites,
[21:02] emmonites, Zedonians, and
[21:05] Hittites of the nations concerning which
[21:07] the Lord said unto the children of
[21:09] Israel, "You shall not go in them,
[21:11] neither shall they come in unto you, for
[21:13] surely they will turn away your heart
[21:15] after their gods." Solomon clave unto
[21:18] these in love. And he had 700 wives,
[21:20] princesses, and 300 concubines. and his
[21:23] wives turned away his heart. For it came
[21:26] to pass when Solomon was old that his
[21:28] wives turned away his heart after other
[21:30] gods. And his heart was not perfect with
[21:32] the Lord his God as was the heart of
[21:34] David his father. So in all that all the
[21:38] wealth and all the wisdom and all the
[21:40] might that he had being on top of the
[21:42] world and the greatest man in the world
[21:44] at that time he was still lost his way
[21:49] &gt;&gt; and his heart was turned and he didn't
[21:51] follow after the Lord perfectly as did
[21:53] his father and it was his wives that
[21:55] turned him and he had 700 wives and 300
[21:58] concubines and he disobeyed the word of
[22:00] the Lord and took wives out of all the
[22:02] nations that he wasn't supposed to take.
[22:04] And I looked at this and I thought for
[22:06] being on top of the world and all the
[22:08] wisdom that you can have and all the
[22:09] riches you can have, he would have been
[22:11] better off being a poor man that could
[22:13] only afford to take care of one wife.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Solomon would have been far better off
[22:18] without the riches. And he would have
[22:20] been far better off without the wisdom
[22:22] because the wisdom couldn't protect him
[22:23] from failing.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It' have been better if he was
[22:29] barely scraping by and he didn't have
[22:31] enough income to support a second wife.
[22:34] he would have been much better off.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take heed to that young men who
[22:39] want to climb the ladder and be
[22:40] successful. You may not want to be
[22:42] successful. You may want to just say,
[22:44] "God, give me whatever you give me, and
[22:46] that's sufficient for me."
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Give me what I can handle, not what I
[22:50] want.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look, let's turn together to
[22:55] Ecclesiastes.
[22:56] This is the book that that Solomon
[22:59] wrote.
[23:01] And we want to look at a couple excerpts
[23:03] from Ecclesiastes of things that he
[23:05] himself wrote.
[23:08] Chapter 1.
[23:12] Ecclesiastes
[23:13] chapter 1 verse 12.
[23:17] He says, "And the preacher was king over
[23:20] Israel in Jerusalem. And I gave my heart
[23:23] to seek and search out by wisdom
[23:25] concerning all things that are done
[23:27] under heaven. This sore travail hath God
[23:30] given to the sons of man to be exercised
[23:32] therewith. I've seen all the works that
[23:34] are done under the sun. And behold, all
[23:37] is vanity and vexation of spirit. That
[23:40] which is crooked cannot be made
[23:41] straight, and that which is wanting
[23:43] cannot be numbered. I commune with my
[23:45] own heart, saying, "Lo, I am come to the
[23:48] great estate, and I've gotten more
[23:50] wisdom than all they that have been
[23:51] before me in Jerusalem. Yay, my heart
[23:53] had great experience of wisdom and
[23:56] knowledge. And I gave my heart to know
[23:58] wisdom and to know madness and folly. I
[24:00] perceive that this also is vexation of
[24:03] spirit. For in much wisdom is much
[24:05] grief. And he that increases knowledge
[24:08] increases increases sorrow.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; After all that he learned, he knew more
[24:14] than anybody else. And here's his
[24:15] conclusion. It's all vexation. It's all
[24:17] vanity and vexation of spirit. For in
[24:20] much wisdom is much grief. And he that
[24:24] increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[24:27] When he got to the end of it, he found
[24:29] it didn't satisfy.
[24:32] It wasn't what he thought it was going
[24:34] to be. Turn with me to uh Ecclesiastes 2
[24:38] verse one.
[24:40] Next verse. And I said in my heart, go
[24:42] to now. I will prove thee with mirth.
[24:45] Therefore enjoy pleasure. And behold,
[24:47] this also is vanity. I said, of
[24:50] laughter, it is mad, and of mirth, what
[24:52] do what doeth it? I sought in mine heart
[24:54] to give myself unto wine. Yet
[24:56] acquainting mine heart with wisdom, and
[24:58] to lay hold on folly, till I might see
[25:01] what was that good for the sons of men,
[25:03] which they should do under the heaven
[25:05] all the days of their life. And I made
[25:08] me great works. I built in me houses. I
[25:10] planted me vineyards. I made me gardens
[25:12] and orchards, and I planted trees in
[25:14] them of all kinds of fruit. And I made
[25:17] me pools of water to water therewith the
[25:20] wood that bringeth forth trees. I got me
[25:23] servants and maidens, and I had servants
[25:25] born in my house. Also I had great
[25:27] possessions of great and small cattle
[25:29] above all that were in Jerusalem before
[25:31] me. I gathered me also silver and gold,
[25:33] and the peculiar treasure of the kings
[25:35] and of the provinces. I got me men's
[25:38] singers and women's singers and the
[25:39] delights of the sons of men as musical
[25:41] instruments and that of all sorts. So I
[25:44] was great and increased more than all
[25:46] that were before me in Jerusalem. Also
[25:48] my wisdom remained with me. And
[25:51] whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not
[25:54] from them. I withheld not my heart from
[25:57] any joy. For my heart rejoiced in all my
[26:00] labor, and this was my portion of all my
[26:02] labor. Then I looked on all the works
[26:05] that my hands had wrought, and on all
[26:07] the labor that I had labored to do, and
[26:09] behold, all was vanity and vexation of
[26:12] spirit. And there was no profit under
[26:14] the sun.
[26:16] This man tried it all.
[26:19] Anything that his heart desired, he
[26:21] didn't withhold from his heart. Anything
[26:22] his eyes wanted, he gave he gave for
[26:24] himself. He had the means to do it. He
[26:27] had the power to do it. He had he had
[26:29] all power. He had all wisdom, all
[26:31] knowledge. He had uh he had everything.
[26:34] He had money, women, power, prestige,
[26:37] fame, honor. He had everything he wanted
[26:39] and he took everything he desired. And
[26:42] at the end of it, it's all vanity and
[26:45] vexation of spirits. He said there's
[26:47] nothing under the sun. Why? Because he
[26:50] had went to the pinnacle, the highest
[26:52] you can go on earth. And he had tried
[26:54] everything you can try and he enjoyed
[26:56] everything you can enjoy. Amen. But the
[26:58] key phrase to all of Ecclesiastes is
[27:01] under the sun. On the earth, he went as
[27:04] high as he could under the sun. He had
[27:07] all he could on the earth. But he found
[27:09] no satisfaction and pleasure because our
[27:12] satisfaction and pleasure is found
[27:13] beyond this natural world. It's found in
[27:16] the heavenly realms. And he said, "Under
[27:17] the heaven, all is vexation and vanity.
[27:20] Absolutely all we can enjoy and all the
[27:22] pleasures of the world and all that we
[27:24] can esteem to is nothing. What I want is
[27:27] beyond the heavens. Amen. Beyond this
[27:29] earth.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; And he had it all. But his heart was not
[27:36] perfect.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to another scripture in
[27:39] Ezekiel.
[27:45] It's amazing how you start reading this
[27:47] and you start thinking, maybe I don't
[27:49] want to be prosperous.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't want to run the business.
[27:55] Maybe I don't want to be present. Maybe
[27:57] I I don't want maybe not.
[28:02] It starts to change the way we think
[28:04] about things. Ezekiel 28:11, this is
[28:08] going to be a prophecy concerning
[28:09] Lucifer. Now listen closely.
[28:13] Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto
[28:14] me, saying, Son of man, take up a
[28:16] lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and
[28:18] say unto him, Thus sayeth the Lord God,
[28:20] thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom
[28:23] and perfect in beauty. Thou has been in
[28:26] Eden, the garden of God, every precious
[28:28] stone was thy covering, the sardis, the
[28:30] topaz, the diamond, the barrel, the
[28:32] onyx, the jasper, the sapphire, the
[28:34] emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold.
[28:36] The workmanship of thy tabets and of thy
[28:38] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[28:40] that thou was created. So he tells him,
[28:43] thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom
[28:48] and perfect in beauty. This is what
[28:50] Lucifer is, full of wisdom. Solomon was
[28:52] also full of wisdom. He was perfect in
[28:55] beauty and he had every ornament and
[28:57] every precious stone and everything to
[29:00] to decorate and honor him. Verse 14.
[29:03] Thou art the anointed cherub that
[29:05] coverth. He had the highest position you
[29:07] can have in heaven outside of God.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Thou art the anointed cherub that
[29:11] coverth, and I have set thee so. Thoust
[29:14] upon the holy mountain of God. Thou has
[29:16] walked up and down in the midst of the
[29:17] stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy
[29:20] ways from the day that thou was created
[29:22] till iniquity was found in thee. By the
[29:26] multitude of thy merchandise, they have
[29:28] filled the midst of thee with violence,
[29:30] and thou has sinned. Therefore, I will
[29:31] cast thee as profane out of the mountain
[29:33] of God. I will destroy thee, oh covering
[29:36] cherub, from the midst of the stones of
[29:38] fire. Thine heart was lifted up because
[29:41] of thy beauty. Thou hast corrupted thy
[29:44] wisdom by reason of thy brightness. I
[29:48] will cast thee to the ground. I will lay
[29:50] thee before kings that they may behold
[29:52] thee.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; I just say it this way. Lucifer was too
[29:56] perfect.
[29:57] Yeah.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; He was too wise and too perfect.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what corrupted him.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; He corrupted. He was corrupted by his
[30:08] beauty and by his brightness.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't want to be the best.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; You know, there's such a there there's
[30:18] such a pressure upon everybody in
[30:21] Leodysia and all humanity to be the
[30:23] best, to be great. There's a pressure
[30:25] upon every young woman to be the most
[30:27] beautiful. Amen. But maybe you don't
[30:29] want to be the most beautiful. Maybe
[30:31] that's a curse.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; There's pressure on men to be the most
[30:34] successful, be the most handsome, the
[30:35] most daring. Maybe you don't want to be
[30:37] the most handsome. Maybe that's a curse.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said, "A beautiful
[30:41] woman, that can be a curse to her."
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe to be super bright and super
[30:46] intelligent, maybe that's a curse to
[30:48] you. Amen. Maybe to be super successful
[30:50] can be a curse to you if God's not there
[30:52] to put it in check. Maybe all of our
[30:55] striving, if we're striving for vain
[30:57] glory, if we're striving for fa for
[30:59] self, if we're striving for selfishness
[31:01] and pride, and we're trying to gain
[31:03] more. Amen. Those very things that we're
[31:05] striving to achieve can be the very
[31:07] downfall and destruction of us. We're
[31:09] chasing after money, prosperity, fame.
[31:11] We're chasing after success because it's
[31:13] good to be successful and feels good to
[31:15] be successful. I would rather be an
[31:17] utter failure in this world and succeed
[31:19] in the heavenly realm. Amen. Than
[31:21] succeed here and my heart be turned from
[31:23] the Lord.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people have chased a
[31:26] career and gave up on things of God and
[31:29] begin to compromise because they're
[31:30] chasing after money, chasing after
[31:32] popularity, chasing after whatever
[31:34] they're chasing after.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help me to chase after what
[31:39] matters most. Help me to chase after
[31:40] you. Amen.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Me says this about Lucifer. He
[31:46] said, "You notice Lucifer is exactly
[31:48] doing the same thing today that he did
[31:50] at the beginning. Lucifer at the
[31:52] beginning wanted to build himself a
[31:53] kingdom which was greater and more
[31:55] beautiful than Michael's kingdom,
[31:57] Christ." He that was his ambition to
[32:00] achieve something like that. So if he
[32:03] thought he could build a greater, more
[32:05] beautiful kingdom than Michael's, than
[32:07] Christ, then the question is, what did
[32:10] Michael's kingdom look like?
[32:13] He thought he could top it.
[32:16] He said, Lucifer at the beginning, his
[32:18] purpose and heart was to achieve a
[32:20] brighter and greater thing in heaven
[32:21] than Christ had. Is that right? By
[32:23] seemingly a more cultured, more
[32:25] beautiful, more splendor than the
[32:27] kingdom of Christ. This is amazing to me
[32:29] because Lucifer was sure that he could
[32:32] have more splendor. He could have more
[32:34] culture. He could do better job than
[32:37] what Christ could do than the kingdom of
[32:39] Christ, the kingdom of Michael. So that
[32:41] means what kind of kingdom did Michael
[32:43] or Christ have? Amen. Well, I think if
[32:46] we look at how Christ came, we can start
[32:48] to see what kind of kingdom he had
[32:50] because he he came lowly. He came to a
[32:54] poor family. He was born in poverty.
[32:57] Amen. He didn't choose the rich. He
[32:59] didn't choose the palace. But he was
[33:00] born in a stable and laid in a manger
[33:02] and wrapped in a and a yolk of a cloth
[33:05] off a yolk of oxen and is swaddled in
[33:08] that and laid. He came in the lowest
[33:10] form that he could come in. He come in
[33:11] absolute humility. Though he was king of
[33:14] all the earth, he came in the lowest
[33:16] form he could come. And then the body he
[33:19] chose cuz remember the genetics weren't
[33:21] chose by any earthly parents. He chose
[33:23] God chose his own genetics. Amen. He
[33:25] wrote it in for the stature. And he said
[33:27] there was no former beauty that we
[33:29] should desire him. He didn't come
[33:30] handsome. He didn't come broad
[33:32] shouldered. He didn't come with a fair
[33:34] complexion. He didn't come beautiful.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; He came lowly and meek riding on an ass.
[33:40] That's how he came into Jerusalem as
[33:42] king.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; So what kind of kingdom did he have in
[33:45] heaven? I'd say he had a humble kingdom.
[33:48] One, he didn't go to the top of what he
[33:50] could possibly do. He moved himself down
[33:52] lower. Amen. God never operated at the
[33:55] highest level. God has always
[33:56] condescended him down in humility.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; But Lucifer can't do that. Amen. He's
[34:03] got to go as high as he possibly can and
[34:05] try to exceed. And he thought he could
[34:07] because obviously Christ wasn't going to
[34:09] his max.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; We understand.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Look at what else Solomon wrote in
[34:19] Proverbs.
[34:21] Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give
[34:23] me neither poverty nor riches.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Feed me with food convenient for me,
[34:29] lest I be full and deny thee and say,
[34:32] "Who is the Lord?" Or lest I be poor and
[34:34] steal and take the name of my God in
[34:36] vain.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; What was the wisdom that Solomon came
[34:40] to? Don't make me rich or poor.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Just put me in the middle.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Let me be average.
[34:47] [Applause]
[34:49] Let me be average because if I'm if I'm
[34:52] full, I may forget the Lord and say,
[34:54] "Who is the Lord?" Because I'm
[34:55] satisfied. Amen. That's what happened to
[34:57] the rich young ruler who came to Jesus.
[34:59] Amen. And he turned his back on Jesus
[35:01] cuz he couldn't give up his riches for
[35:03] eternal life. But later we find him with
[35:05] his barns full with the plentiful
[35:06] harvest. And he said, "So, take thy
[35:08] ease.
[35:10] Eat and drink and be merry for you've
[35:13] got everything that you want." And Jesus
[35:15] said, "Thou fool, thou dost not know
[35:17] that tonight thy soul is required of
[35:19] thee." He had everything he wanted on
[35:21] earth, but but that was under the sun.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; But he had nothing because he found
[35:27] himself in hell.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "God,
[35:34] what's wrong with average?"
[35:38] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with slightly below
[35:39] average?
[35:41] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus look? Did he look above
[35:44] average, below average? Like like the
[35:46] median of all humanity? I say he was
[35:48] average. What was the prophet of our age
[35:51] like? I'd say he was average.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] I think we're going to find that's a
[35:58] safer place to be. Solomon was wise. He
[36:02] had experienced it.
[36:04] Brother Beam says, "But when you become
[36:06] a real Christian, every moment you're
[36:09] wondering, am I pleasing my Lord? if I
[36:12] could hear from him. It puts you on
[36:14] tension, puts you on guard. That's what
[36:16] makes you what you are. So after all,
[36:18] tension is a blessing. It's just the way
[36:21] you're looking at it. It's just the way
[36:23] you're looking at it. If you just took
[36:24] the other side, no matter how thin you
[36:26] slice anything, you still got two sides
[36:28] to it. You see? So you want to see both
[36:30] sides. So tension. I think, "Oh my,
[36:33] what's this tension? If I could have
[36:35] been born without this tension." Well,
[36:37] if I wouldn't have had this tension, I
[36:40] wouldn't have been what I am. I wouldn't
[36:42] have been a Christian. Perhaps it was
[36:44] this tension that drove me to Jesus
[36:46] Christ. It's been a blessing thing to
[36:48] me.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Here, the prophet is dealing with a
[36:52] nervousness that he's had all of his
[36:53] life. A nervous tension. It's caused him
[36:55] to have to leave the field. It's caused
[36:57] him to have a sour stomach for years on
[36:59] end. It's caused him all kinds of
[37:01] heartache and grief and getting
[37:02] depressed and all of these things that
[37:04] he's had to deal with. So he starts
[37:06] dealing with this tension and he's
[37:07] coming into another bout of it here in
[37:09] 19 end of 1963 and he starts to think
[37:12] about the tension and he starts to take
[37:14] what is ne what we would call negative
[37:17] hurtful harmful to him and he says it's
[37:20] a blessing to me.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; It's the thing that drove me to Christ
[37:23] because it's not good to have everything
[37:26] good.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; It's not good to have everything
[37:31] perfect. It's not good for everything to
[37:33] be right. It's not good for us to have
[37:36] everything we want at our beck and call
[37:38] and at our fingertips. That's not good
[37:40] for us. What's good for us is to have a
[37:43] dependency on almighty God and not have
[37:45] a dependency on oursel and not be
[37:47] self-sufficient and self-dependent, but
[37:49] to have something in our life that keeps
[37:52] us connected to God and dependent upon
[37:54] God.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; So God in his great mercy allowed this
[37:58] condition in the prophet. He could have
[38:00] removed it. And brother Benham prayed
[38:01] many times for it to be removed. And God
[38:03] eventually promised he'd remove it. When
[38:05] did he remove it? He removed it a month
[38:07] before he died.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the tension served a
[38:12] purpose in his life. And that purpose
[38:14] was met. And when he was done with the
[38:16] prophet and done with his work on earth,
[38:18] he said, "Okay, you're healed now. Now
[38:20] let's go home."
[38:23] &gt;&gt; That tension, that nervousness, that
[38:26] that suffer. And listen, did he really
[38:28] suffer with it? He suffered
[38:29] immeasurably, friends. Probably more
[38:31] than we could ever realize that he
[38:33] suffered with this issue. And it was a
[38:35] medical condition. It was a nervous
[38:36] condition. It was a mental condition all
[38:39] rolled into one.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; And nobody wants to suffer like that.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; But he said it was a blessing thing to
[38:49] me.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Then he starts talking about all
[38:52] Christians. All Christians who want to
[38:54] serve the Lord. He said they come under
[38:56] tension. He said, "People sell
[38:59] Christianity like it's just an easy
[39:00] thing and you come to God and there's no
[39:02] more worries." He said, "That's when
[39:04] worries begin because now you want to
[39:06] please the Lord."
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And you get under tension wanting to
[39:09] please the Lord, wanting to know his
[39:10] will and you think, "If I so want to
[39:13] know the will of God, he'll just tell
[39:15] me."
[39:17] &gt;&gt; And you seek God and you seek God and he
[39:19] doesn't tell you.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; How's everybody ever been to a place
[39:21] where you've got to make a decision and
[39:23] you want God to tell you what to do and
[39:25] he won't tell you nothing?
[39:27] And you think God in a fraction of a
[39:29] moment you could answer this question.
[39:31] Why won't you tell me what I'm supposed
[39:33] to do? Hey, listen. Because if he told
[39:35] you what to do every time you come to a
[39:37] decision, you would never agonize in
[39:39] prayer. You would never labor in prayer.
[39:41] He would just tell you what to do and
[39:42] you'd walk on. You wouldn't have faith.
[39:44] You wouldn't be dependent. You wouldn't
[39:45] be on your knees.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I promise you, you pray
[39:49] better when you're in trouble than when
[39:51] everything's going fine.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I promise you that. Amen. That's the way
[39:55] it is for me. I have My prayer life is
[39:57] so good when I'm in the midst of a
[39:59] tragedy.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; That's when it's the best.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately,
[40:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not proud of that.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; But that's human nature.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of it. I'm ashamed that that
[40:14] the best times of prayer, the times that
[40:16] I spend more time in prayer and I'm more
[40:19] earnest in prayer and more sincere in
[40:21] prayer is in times of trouble. I'm
[40:23] ashamed of that. But that's the truth.
[40:24] And I realize God brought times of
[40:27] trouble to keep me close to him because
[40:29] I have a tendency like a sheep when
[40:31] everything's fine to wander away.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; But the grace of God will allow a wolf
[40:36] to come along every once in a while. So
[40:38] I run right back to the shepherd and
[40:39] stay close to him.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[40:45] Brother Beam says, "I was just talking
[40:47] to a young minister and his wife in this
[40:49] room just a few moments ago, and both of
[40:51] them are nervous just like the rest of
[40:53] the world. The rest of of human beings
[40:56] on earth." I said, "Remember, Satan's
[40:59] got a punch coming at you. Don't care
[41:01] who you are. He's got a right for that
[41:04] one punch. Which had you rather it be
[41:06] that punch? Be blind or be arthritic
[41:09] sitting in a chair or be nervous? He's
[41:12] got somewhere he can punch you. He's got
[41:15] a right to that open place. Now, that's
[41:17] the spot you've got to keep covered all
[41:19] the time.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I love this quote because it gives us
[41:23] such insight. That means we all have at
[41:26] least one area of weakness in us.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; And that one area of weakness is the
[41:32] area that Satan is always going to come
[41:35] and he's always going to access us. He's
[41:37] always going to get to us in that area.
[41:40] Amen. And brother M said, "That's the
[41:42] area we got to keep covered all the
[41:43] time." And you think, "God, why don't
[41:45] you just take that away from me?"
[41:48] &gt;&gt; But what would you be if he took it
[41:49] away?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; If you didn't need him
[41:55] &gt;&gt; all the time for this area of weakness,
[41:57] what would happen to us as human beings
[41:59] and fallen flesh in a fallen condition?
[42:01] Listen, God in his great mercy has left
[42:04] weaknesses inside of us. He's left
[42:07] issues with us to deal with. He loves
[42:09] things that we have need because that's
[42:11] one of the best things that can ever
[42:13] happen to us is that we have whatever
[42:17] you label it. Brother Benham says he
[42:19] Satan's got a punch coming at you. Which
[42:22] one would you rather it be?
[42:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not picking.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Like give me a list of would you rather
[42:28] be arthritic? Would you rather be blind?
[42:30] Would you rather be in a wheelchair?
[42:31] Would you rather have nervous t? Listen,
[42:33] I'm not picking. I'm like David. When
[42:35] David was given a choice of which way he
[42:36] was going to be punished, he said, "I'll
[42:38] fall in the hands of God, not the hands
[42:39] of man." And I said, "God, whatever you
[42:41] know what's best, I can't pick anything
[42:43] off that list cuz I want none of them.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want any of them." But you get
[42:49] it without asking.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Because God loves us.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; In 2 Corinthians 12, this is the Apostle
[43:00] Paul. He says, "Un lest I should be
[43:02] exalted above measure through the
[43:05] abundance of the revelations, there was
[43:06] given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
[43:09] messenger of Satan to buffet me." Oh,
[43:11] friends, what a what a quote. What a
[43:14] scripture,
[43:16] lest I should be exalted above measure.
[43:19] For this thing I besought the Lord
[43:21] thrice that it might depart from me. And
[43:23] he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[43:25] for thee, for my strength is made
[43:27] perfect in weakness."
[43:29] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[43:31] glory in my infirmities, that the power
[43:33] of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[43:35] take pleasure in infirmities, and
[43:37] reproaches, and necessities, and
[43:40] persecutions, and distresses for
[43:42] Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then
[43:44] am I strong.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Lest I should be exalted above measure.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Lucifer. Yeah,
[43:59] &gt;&gt; he exalted himself because of his
[44:02] brightness, because of his beauty.
[44:05] And Paul, because God was going to pour
[44:07] out the full revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:09] to him. Amen. Unless he should get
[44:12] exalted above measure, there was given
[44:15] to him a thorn in the flesh, a messenger
[44:17] of Satan to buffet him, lest I should be
[44:20] exalted above measure. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; It looks to me like God knew Paul's
[44:28] weakness
[44:29] because when he was Saul, he sought
[44:33] popularity and fame amongst the
[44:35] religious leaders and he sought a
[44:37] position and acceptance from them. And
[44:41] so God in his goodness when he was going
[44:43] to pour upon him in the desert of
[44:46] Arabia, pour out the revelation of
[44:48] himself. Amen. With that great
[44:50] revelation and that position as the
[44:52] apostle of the age, amen, was going to
[44:54] come an affliction in the flesh.
[44:57] And the affliction in the flesh was a
[45:00] guard rail for the Apostle Paul
[45:05] &gt;&gt; to keep him from going off the cliff.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; And he asked God three times to remove
[45:12] it. But God refused to remove it. Do
[45:18] &gt;&gt; you understand that Paul's coming to
[45:20] God? Because obviously whatever this is
[45:23] is not pleasant and he doesn't like it
[45:26] and he doesn't want it. That's why he
[45:29] comes three times to the Lord. And in
[45:31] three times he asks God to take this
[45:33] away and in the third time God says my
[45:36] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[45:38] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[45:41] God's strength is not made perfect in
[45:42] your strength. God's strength is made
[45:44] perfect in your weakness. Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul realized then that
[45:50] God had done this for my protection. God
[45:52] had done this for his glory. God has
[45:55] allowed this. And so then he begins to
[45:57] glory in his infirmities. He begins to
[46:00] rejoice and take pleasure in all of
[46:02] these things. For when he is weak, then
[46:04] is he strong. So God knew Paul needed
[46:07] this to keep Paul from going off the
[46:10] rails.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; He needed a guard rail.
[46:14] And the question I want to ask you is,
[46:16] do we need a guardrail?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And what is the guardrail God put in our
[46:22] life? And what is our attitude towards
[46:25] our guard rail?
[46:30] It's something to think about. Friends,
[46:33] some of us, we have things in our life.
[46:36] It could be a health issue. It could be
[46:38] an affliction. It could be a family
[46:39] situation. It could be we're dealing
[46:42] with we're we're dealing with
[46:43] singleness. We're dealing with we're
[46:45] dealing with pain or affliction. We're
[46:47] dealing with uh poverty. We're dealing
[46:50] with whatever we're dealing with. Amen.
[46:52] But it God may have put that thing there
[46:55] as a guard rail.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a brother one time and
[46:59] he was talking about a brother who
[47:01] wanted to preach the gospel, but the
[47:03] brother wasn't qualified to preach the
[47:05] gospel.
[47:07] He didn't meet the scriptural
[47:08] qualifications and he didn't meet what
[47:10] the prophet had told us for this age.
[47:11] So, he wasn't qualified to be a
[47:13] minister, but yet he had a gift that
[47:16] operated in his life and he could break
[47:17] the word. And so, he thought that he he
[47:20] thought God was calling him to preach
[47:21] and he thought he would be a good
[47:23] preacher, but he didn't meet the
[47:25] scriptural qualifications.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; And the brother told me, and it was
[47:29] amazing when he said it. He said he
[47:32] didn't realize that God put that as a
[47:34] guardrail for him. He didn't use the
[47:35] word guardrail, but I'm using it to keep
[47:38] him from destroying himself and
[47:39] destroying other people's lives because
[47:42] he's got a gift. He's got an ability.
[47:44] He's able to do it. But if he was called
[47:46] to do it, he would meet the
[47:47] qualifications. God would have watched
[47:49] over him and watched over his wife and
[47:51] protected him so that he could marry a
[47:52] virgin so that he would meet the
[47:54] qualifications for a minister.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And so he saw the guard rail as a
[48:00] limitation
[48:03] &gt;&gt; instead of safety. Right.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Paul saw the guard rail, not as
[48:09] limitation. He saw it as safety. Brother
[48:12] Brandham saw the guard rail. He didn't
[48:13] see it now as limitation. He saw it as
[48:16] safety that God was doing something for
[48:17] him because it's this tension that drove
[48:19] me to Christ.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes whatever we got
[48:25] limited in our life or whatever
[48:26] affliction we have or whatever it is, it
[48:29] may be the guard rail, amen, to keep us,
[48:31] amen, from going over the rails. Amen.
[48:33] Sometimes whatever our limitation is, we
[48:35] suffer with it so much in our minds, not
[48:38] realizing God is perfect in every way
[48:40] and he does everything good. And some
[48:42] people struggle because now they're
[48:43] trapped in singleness because of a
[48:45] qualification in their life. Amen. But
[48:47] listen, if if God wanted you to be
[48:50] married, you'd be married. Singleness is
[48:52] a guardrail to protect you from going
[48:54] off the end. You don't know what you
[48:55] would do if you were married.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; You may not serve God anymore. You don't
[49:00] know what you would do if you had a
[49:01] strong body. You may not serve God
[49:03] anymore.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you would do if this
[49:10] barrier was removed. If God allows it to
[49:12] stay, say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm still
[49:14] believing." If it's healing, believe for
[49:16] healing, but thank God. Amen. For
[49:18] everything he's done to drive you to
[49:20] him.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Everything he's done to keep you within
[49:23] the boundaries that he wants you and to
[49:25] keep you dependent on him, looking to
[49:27] him, serving him with all of your heart.
[49:30] Yes,
[49:31] &gt;&gt; we think everything would be better if
[49:34] everything was better.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; But sometimes if everything gets better
[49:39] then spiritually it gets worse.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the worst thing that can
[49:45] happen to a man is he has a successful
[49:47] business.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Sometime the worst thing that can happen
[49:51] to the girl is that she gets the guy
[49:53] she's been after.
[49:55] Sometimes it's the worst thing that ever
[49:56] happened to her. She got the guy she was
[49:58] after. the one who was most popular, the
[50:00] one everybody wanted, and she got him
[50:02] and now she lives with it for 40, 50
[50:06] years.
[50:08] Sometimes the no is the best thing
[50:11] that's ever happened to us.
[50:14] And when it doesn't work out, we're
[50:15] heartbroken. We're distraught.
[50:16] Absolutely, of course.
[50:19] But there's a danger in peace and
[50:21] prosperity.
[50:24] Amen. Look at this scripture.
[50:27] For ye see your calling, brethren, how
[50:29] that not many wise men after the flesh,
[50:32] not many mighty, not many noble are
[50:34] called. But God has chosen the foolish
[50:36] things of the world to confound the
[50:38] wise. And God has chosen the weak things
[50:40] of the world to confound the things
[50:41] which are mighty. And the base things of
[50:43] the world, and the things which are
[50:44] despised, hath God chosen, yay, and
[50:47] things which are not, to bring to not
[50:48] things that are, that no flesh should
[50:51] glory in his presence.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; God's not using strength. God's using
[50:57] weakness. God's not using mighty things.
[50:58] He's using weak things.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; So if you're a weak thing, praise God.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; He can use you. Amen.
[51:07] Amen. I want to uh take a look at this
[51:11] this quote. There's a couple in the
[51:12] message. Desperations I want to read.
[51:15] It's a desperation. When the wife was
[51:17] about to die with cancer, he knowed that
[51:18] God could heal her. And if God could
[51:20] heal the wife, God can heal the boy. And
[51:22] it throws it into a state of
[51:24] desperation. and see you must come. And
[51:27] when you're desperate, then God is going
[51:29] to listen to you. But if you're just
[51:32] slothful, you don't care whether he does
[51:34] or not. Well, then that's different. You
[51:37] say you do, but it takes desperation to
[51:39] do it.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Brother's got several quotes along this
[51:42] line on desperation. And he says, he
[51:46] says, "When you're desperate, then God
[51:48] is going to listen to you."
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Do you realize you can't fake
[51:55] desperation?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; If you're desperate, God's going to hear
[52:00] you. How are you going to fake
[52:02] desperation?
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may you may stand up in a
[52:07] crowd and let your voice quiver when
[52:09] you're praying. But but God knows your
[52:10] heart whether you're desperate or not.
[52:12] And what creates desperation? It's the
[52:13] situations we find ourselves in that
[52:15] create desperation. It's a great need
[52:18] for God. It's when only God will work.
[52:20] It's when nothing else will work but
[52:21] God. And I got to have God now. And I
[52:23] got to have his word manifest in my
[52:25] life. And it takes desperation. And how
[52:27] do we get to desperation and peace and
[52:30] prosperity?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; No. There's many things that happen to
[52:34] our life. Amen. Because it brings us
[52:36] into states of desperation.
[52:39] Uh I want to read this quote from taking
[52:41] sides with Jesus. He said, "Just imagine
[52:43] what if God would place on you that you
[52:46] know the heart of the people that he was
[52:48] talking to. Think about that, brethren.
[52:51] Maybe I know you have burdens, but you
[52:53] don't understand. And besides that, here
[52:54] you got the responsibility here. You
[52:57] say, "Well, that ought to be easy for
[52:59] you, brother Benham. Anything to do, God
[53:01] just tell you?" No, he doesn't. I sweat
[53:04] it out just like you do and a whole lot
[53:06] harder. I have to sweat much harder than
[53:09] you do. You think with a prophetic gift,
[53:11] God would just told him what to do. But
[53:13] God didn't just tell him what to do. He
[53:15] made him sweat it out and labor and be
[53:17] desperate in prayer for direction from
[53:19] God. And why with a prophetic gift, why
[53:22] wouldn't God just tell him? Because God
[53:24] can't just tell him because then
[53:25] everything becomes too easy.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; But he himself has to labor. He himself
[53:31] has to have faith. He himself has to
[53:33] depend on God.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; He said in the message, the everpresent
[53:37] water from the rock. I have things now
[53:39] that I have to solve out myself and
[53:42] decisions I have to make. And this is
[53:44] such a vital one till I cannot exactly
[53:46] make it until I'm sure that it's him
[53:48] speaking to me. and he won't give me a
[53:50] vision. He just let me alone. So, I'm
[53:53] just sitting like as an orphan like this
[53:56] morning and I don't know which way to
[53:58] turn. You say, "Why would God do that?"
[54:01] Because it was necessary. Because it was
[54:03] the best thing for the prophet to have
[54:05] to sweat it out and not get an easy
[54:07] answer and to be desperate and have to
[54:09] wait on the Lord.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; God told him, "Well, if I push you in a
[54:12] pipe and pull you out the other side
[54:14] every time, doing everything for you,
[54:15] making decisions, where's your reward?
[54:17] Where did you exercise your faith? Where
[54:19] did you overcome?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But yet, there had to be an overcoming.
[54:23] There had to be a faith that was
[54:25] expressed. So God didn't just put him in
[54:28] a tube every time and pull him out the
[54:29] other side. And he doesn't for us
[54:31] either. He lets us labor and he lets us
[54:33] pray and he lets us strive and he lets
[54:35] us sweat it out.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And how many like sweating it out?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; It's horrible. How many likes being
[54:44] stuck and knowing you got to make a
[54:45] decision, not knowing what the will of
[54:47] God is, and praying desperately for God
[54:49] to show you because all you want to do
[54:50] is his will, but yet he doesn't tell you
[54:52] anything. Those are horrible times,
[54:54] friends, but it's the best thing that
[54:56] could ever happen to us to drive us to
[54:58] his feet
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and to keep us there.
[55:02] And desperations again, he says, "We
[55:05] know it's true that God will meet a
[55:06] desperate soul." Now we all know that
[55:09] but it's usually takes something to
[55:11] drive us into that to that despair to
[55:14] the desperation. It takes something to
[55:16] do it. We find out in James 5:15 that
[55:18] the Bible said that the effectual
[55:20] fervent that's desperation effectual
[55:22] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[55:24] avaleth much. He goes on to say and
[55:28] there may be men and women sitting here
[55:29] tonight that's death lays right before
[55:31] you. And the only way that you'll ever
[55:33] be able to achieve the thing that you're
[55:35] wanting is to desperately come. I must
[55:38] have it tonight. I I I get it now or I'm
[55:41] finished. Tomorrow's too late. I must
[55:43] have it now. When you pray for the
[55:44] baptism of the Holy Spirit, the token.
[55:46] Don't say, "Well, now I'll go up and
[55:48] try. Lord, I'm a little tired." Oh,
[55:50] mercy, stay in your seat. Don't even
[55:53] make an attempt. If you come say, "I'll
[55:55] pass through the prayer line, put the
[55:56] oil on my head. I'll see if it does me
[55:58] any good." Might as well set where
[56:00] you're at
[56:02] &gt;&gt; until you get to that place. Until the
[56:04] whole church gets to a place that is
[56:06] between death and life, you've got to
[56:08] have it now or perish. Then God will
[56:11] move on the scene. It takes desperation
[56:13] to bring God on the scene. Jacob cried
[56:16] like never before. Desperately he called
[56:19] until he got a hold of God. And when he
[56:21] did, he wrestled not for 15 minutes. He
[56:23] wrestled to keep him in his soul all
[56:25] night long. And still he knew he didn't
[56:27] have the blessing. And he was able to
[56:28] hold on until the blessing come. He
[56:30] wrestled desperately until the blessing
[56:32] come.
[56:34] It takes desperation to bring God on the
[56:36] scene. So, how are you going to be
[56:38] desperate?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to recognize our
[56:43] need.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to recognize how
[56:47] much we need him. We're going to have to
[56:49] come in contact with our weakness and
[56:50] our desperate need for him. Amen. And
[56:53] that's what brings him on the scene. How
[56:55] is that going to happen when
[56:56] everything's fine
[56:58] &gt;&gt; and I'm strong and I'm beautiful and I'm
[57:01] wise and I've got all the answers and
[57:02] I've got all of life figured out. Amen.
[57:04] It's not going to happen then. It's
[57:06] going to happen when I don't have it
[57:07] figured out. When I don't know what the
[57:09] answer is. When I come up against a
[57:11] crisis and I don't know how to get out
[57:12] of it and I need God and I need him now.
[57:15] That's desperation.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Those times that we think are the worst
[57:19] times in our life, we look back now and
[57:21] they're the best times of our life.
[57:23] There are the times God drew us near to
[57:24] himself. God proved his word in our
[57:26] life. God showed himself mighty on our
[57:28] behalf. But it took getting into a
[57:30] condition to bring that about. It wasn't
[57:33] when everything was easy and when life
[57:34] was happy and when there was no problem.
[57:36] It was that problem that drove us into
[57:38] the situation. It's like the troubles
[57:40] were like cattle gates. Amen. Narrowing
[57:42] down and pushing us right to the feet of
[57:44] God and say, "God, I need you. I need
[57:46] you now. And I need your word like I've
[57:48] never needed before." And when we got to
[57:50] that condition, God comes on the scene
[57:52] and those things that we hated becomes
[57:54] the testimony we tell everybody when we
[57:56] get together and have fellowship.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; It was from the worst to the best.
[58:02] So
[58:03] it's better
[58:06] sometimes for us when it's rough, when
[58:10] it's hard, when it's not perfect, when
[58:13] we're in weakness.
[58:15] We want to be on the top all the time,
[58:18] but it didn't work for Lucifer and it
[58:21] didn't work for Solomon.
[58:23] God didn't allow Paul to go there or
[58:26] brother Brandham.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; And I don't think God's going to let his
[58:30] bride go there. He's going to take her
[58:32] to the top, absolutely, but he's going
[58:34] to keep her dependent on him and he's
[58:37] going to do what we need.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. At the end of
[58:41] it all, I'm so thankful he doesn't give
[58:43] me everything I want.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; But he gives me exactly what I need.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe he does all things well.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; If he's put a barrier in my life, then
[58:55] thank God.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; That's for me.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; If there's a guardrail that keeps me
[59:00] from going somewhere I want or something
[59:02] I want to do and God says, "No, it's not
[59:04] according to the word." And the word is
[59:06] becomes the barrier, I say, "Thank God.
[59:09] There's some reason you're protecting me
[59:11] from something.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Not limiting me. Not not being a bad dad
[59:16] and not giving me. Listen, God's
[59:18] promised to give good things to those
[59:19] who ask.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; He's promised to be a loving father. And
[59:23] he said if if earthly men will give good
[59:25] gifts, how much more will God give the
[59:27] Holy Ghost to them that act? He gives
[59:29] good gifts.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; But he gives the right gift at the right
[59:32] time for the right reason.
[59:36] in spiritual amnesia. He says, like
[59:37] Buddy Robinson has said one time in a
[59:40] cornfield, he said, 'Lord, if you don't
[59:42] give me the Holy Ghost, when you come
[59:43] back, you'll find a pile of bones laying
[59:45] right here. He was dead earnest, and
[59:47] you're not going to get anything from
[59:49] God till you get desperate about it.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen, I I have never
[59:56] experienced desperation when
[59:58] everything's going perfect.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; I just want to reiterate that. when
[1:00:02] everything was perfect and and
[1:00:04] everything was bright, shiny and
[1:00:06] everything was great and and everything
[1:00:07] was wonderful in my life. I don't
[1:00:09] remember ever experiencing desperation,
[1:00:11] but I do remember experiencing
[1:00:12] desperation in my life and I remember
[1:00:14] God coming on the scene for me.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for those times.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:00:23] I'm rooting for slightly below average.
[1:00:30] I'm not talking spiritually is my
[1:00:32] connection with God, but on this earth,
[1:00:33] God, don't let me stray away. Don't let
[1:00:37] me take any path that takes me from you.
[1:00:40] Don't let me, Lord, Amen, move into
[1:00:42] something or do something or accept
[1:00:44] something that will draw me away.
[1:00:48] This is a a quote I know and I I heard
[1:00:52] Blake quote this when he was reading the
[1:00:54] prayer request. I was just smiling in
[1:00:55] the back because it's the one I wanted
[1:00:57] to read tonight. said, 'Wh does God let
[1:01:00] troubles come?
[1:01:02] God harnesses trouble, puts bits in its
[1:01:05] mouth, and makes it obey him. And those
[1:01:08] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:01:10] fellowship with God.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; How many have prayed for a closer walk
[1:01:14] with God?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:01:22] How does he do it? Through troubles.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; He harnesses trouble. bits in its mouth,
[1:01:28] makes it obey him. And those troubles
[1:01:30] bring us into a closer fellowship with
[1:01:32] God.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; There had been no rainbow until the
[1:01:35] flood came. But after Noah was pressed
[1:01:37] into that condition that he was in to
[1:01:39] float 40 days and nights in a storm and
[1:01:41] the little ark pitching up and down in
[1:01:43] the water, it was after the flood was
[1:01:44] over that he saw the rainbow for the
[1:01:46] first time. The covenant of hope, the
[1:01:48] covenant of promise. After he'd went
[1:01:51] through the tribulation, then he saw the
[1:01:53] promise.
[1:01:55] That's the way you see the promise.
[1:01:56] after you've gone through the
[1:01:58] tribulation. I've liked that poem or
[1:01:59] psalm. Must I be carried home to heaven
[1:02:02] on a flowery bed of ease? While others
[1:02:04] fought to win the prize and sailed
[1:02:06] through bloody seas, we ask for comfort
[1:02:09] and peace and God gives us the best he
[1:02:11] could give us trials and tribulations.
[1:02:15] That's better than comfort and peace.
[1:02:18] Our comforts is just beyond the river.
[1:02:23] Everything Solomon could achieve in all
[1:02:25] of his wisdom and all of his money and
[1:02:27] all of his might, it under the sun, it
[1:02:30] was vanity and vexation of soul. So
[1:02:33] let's stop worrying about under the sun
[1:02:35] and let's look at what's beyond the sun.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's live for that.
[1:02:42] Amen.
[1:02:43] I want to look at uh
[1:02:47] I want to look at this uh Ecclesiastes
[1:02:49] 7. If you could turn there with me
[1:02:53] back to Ecclesiastes, back to the book
[1:02:54] that Solomon wrote,
[1:03:08] Ecclesiastes
[1:03:14] chapter 7 verse do.
[1:03:20] In Ecclesiastes 7:2, it says, "It is
[1:03:22] better to go to the house of mourning
[1:03:24] than to go to the house of feasting. For
[1:03:27] that is the end of all men, and the
[1:03:28] living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow
[1:03:31] is better than laughter. For by the
[1:03:33] sadness of the countenance, the heart is
[1:03:36] made better." The heart of the wise is
[1:03:38] in the house of mourning, but the heart
[1:03:40] of fools is in the house of mirth.
[1:03:44] This is another one of those bits of
[1:03:45] wisdom that are a little opposite than
[1:03:47] what we think. Amen. It's better to be
[1:03:50] in the house of mourning than to be in
[1:03:52] the house of feasting. But we all want
[1:03:54] to go to the house of feasting. And
[1:03:55] nobody wants to go to the house of
[1:03:56] mourning. But it's in the house of
[1:03:58] mourning where sorrow, this is what he
[1:04:01] says, sorrow is better than laughter.
[1:04:04] For by the sadness of the countenance,
[1:04:05] the heart is made better. God is working
[1:04:08] on our heart and perfecting us through
[1:04:10] all the things that we struggle with and
[1:04:13] all the trials that come our way and all
[1:04:15] are the hardships. And we ask ourselves
[1:04:17] all the time, why is there always
[1:04:19] trouble? Why is it always one thing
[1:04:20] after another? It seems like we get out
[1:04:22] of one thing and we step right into
[1:04:24] another one. And I don't know that I
[1:04:26] don't think I'm the only one like that,
[1:04:27] but I think maybe some of you are in the
[1:04:29] same situation. It's like we come right
[1:04:30] out of one trial and it's like we're
[1:04:32] going right into another one. And it
[1:04:34] used to be I used to think I got a
[1:04:36] reprieve, but it seems like they're
[1:04:37] stacked one on top the other anymore.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But thank God for that, friends. I thank
[1:04:43] God because God's not going to let me.
[1:04:45] Listen, if Paul had an abundance of
[1:04:47] revelation, what has God dished out to
[1:04:49] his bride in this end time? He has
[1:04:51] opened himself and unveiled himself and
[1:04:53] revealed to us who we are. He's gave us
[1:04:55] a security, amen, in his word that's
[1:04:58] beyond anything any other generation
[1:05:00] had. We know who we are. We know who we
[1:05:02] came from. We know where we're going.
[1:05:04] Amen. And unless we could get exalted
[1:05:06] above measure, God has allowed thorns
[1:05:08] and pricks and things, amen, to be guard
[1:05:11] rails in our life to keep us from
[1:05:12] getting exalted because everything would
[1:05:14] be so perfect
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; if God would just give us, Amen, that
[1:05:18] perfect faith that we could speak
[1:05:20] everything in existence and we could
[1:05:21] speak traffic lights to go green and
[1:05:24] speak the traffic out of the way and the
[1:05:26] money in the bank. But God's not going
[1:05:27] to do that because we're still in a
[1:05:29] sticky cocoa nature. Amen. and we would
[1:05:31] get exalted above measure. But God's
[1:05:33] going to pour out an abundance of
[1:05:34] revelation. But with it, he's going to
[1:05:36] give something to keep us needing him,
[1:05:39] desperate for him in desperation, crying
[1:05:42] out to him so that we don't go the way
[1:05:44] of Solomon.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz everything was too good for Solomon.
[1:05:48] And I'm not going to I don't think God's
[1:05:50] going to let us go that way.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't let his prophet of the
[1:05:55] first age, he wouldn't let his prophet
[1:05:57] in the end time. Why would he let you
[1:05:58] and I go that way? Yeah. Yeah.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Have we somehow come to a
[1:06:03] characteristics that are far better than
[1:06:05] Paul?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, if Paul was like me, he
[1:06:10] wouldn't need that.
[1:06:14] You understand what kind of pride that
[1:06:15] is to think that we've somehow we've got
[1:06:18] to a level where we don't need that
[1:06:19] anymore?
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God for the guard rails.
[1:06:24] Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the times in my life
[1:06:27] where I'll kneel down and say, "God, I
[1:06:29] don't have the answers and I don't know
[1:06:30] where to go, but I know you have the
[1:06:32] answers.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; And I know you are the answer, and I'm
[1:06:35] trusting in you, and I can't go anywhere
[1:06:37] else but here. This is the only place
[1:06:39] that I can find my answer."
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful. Remember the story
[1:06:43] brother Benham told of the shepherd with
[1:06:45] his little sheep and he took that sheep
[1:06:48] and he broke its leg. And somebody asked
[1:06:50] him, "Why did you break that sheep leg?
[1:06:51] Are you mad at it?" And he said, "No,
[1:06:54] but this sheep had a problem wandering
[1:06:56] off, and I'm afraid it's going to get
[1:06:58] caught by the wolves and destroyed. So,
[1:07:00] I broke its leg so that I could show it
[1:07:02] a little special love and a little
[1:07:03] special care and take care of it and
[1:07:05] mend it and heal it so it'll learn to
[1:07:07] stay close to me."
[1:07:09] Oh, friends, maybe you've got something
[1:07:11] like a broken leg. Or maybe it's a
[1:07:13] broken spirit. Maybe it's your nerves on
[1:07:15] edge. Maybe it's some affliction in your
[1:07:17] life. Maybe some need that's constantly
[1:07:19] there. But oh, thank God. If it causes
[1:07:22] me to stay close to him and get a little
[1:07:24] extra love from him and never wander
[1:07:26] away from the shepherd, then it's the
[1:07:27] best thing that could have ever happened
[1:07:29] to me.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; It's not horrible. It's wonderful. Amen.
[1:07:33] It's not that I like it. Amen. But I
[1:07:34] like him and I like staying close to
[1:07:36] him. And what is the alternative?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; See, this is the question we never ask.
[1:07:41] We always ask, why is this happening to
[1:07:44] me?
[1:07:46] Has anybody ever asked that question?
[1:07:48] Why is this happening to me?
[1:07:51] Well, are you exclusive somehow? Bad
[1:07:54] things shouldn't happen to you. Are you
[1:07:56] saying it should have happened to
[1:07:57] somebody else in the church, not you?
[1:08:01] Why is this happening to me? And the
[1:08:03] question should we ask, why is God
[1:08:06] allowed this? What good is he going to
[1:08:08] do in this?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Or why do I find myself in this
[1:08:13] position?
[1:08:16] And we have to come to the realization
[1:08:17] that God is perfect
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and he's never made a mistake yet.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And if God allowed so many times we look
[1:08:25] back over our life and say, "Why God
[1:08:27] didn't you stop me from making that
[1:08:28] decision?" Because now I'm bound by
[1:08:30] that. I'm stuck because of what I
[1:08:32] decided. You know, God has interrupted
[1:08:34] people's decision before. God has
[1:08:36] changed circumstances. God has changed
[1:08:38] history
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; to bring about his word. And if God
[1:08:41] allowed it and you're in this condition
[1:08:43] now because of a decision that was made
[1:08:44] years ago, you say, "Why God did you
[1:08:46] allow it?" Listen, where would we be
[1:08:49] without it? Is a better question.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That's what we don't know. We have no
[1:08:54] idea. So, we just assume it's bad and
[1:08:56] it's negative and it's all bad and it's
[1:08:58] all negative and it may be the very
[1:09:01] guard rail God put in our life to keep
[1:09:03] us from going over the edge of the cliff
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; and destroying our life.
[1:09:08] Maybe if we got the guy or got the girl
[1:09:10] or got the job or got the whatever
[1:09:12] promotion, maybe we would have destroyed
[1:09:14] ourselves.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's the grace of God that we
[1:09:19] didn't get the things we were after.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Maybe the position we're in is the very
[1:09:25] best place we could ever be.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I remember brother Abraham Myra told me
[1:09:31] a story one time. He said there was a
[1:09:32] man in his village and the man was lame
[1:09:35] and he had been afflicted all of his
[1:09:36] life and he sat with his legs crossed
[1:09:38] and his feet turned up facing his face
[1:09:41] and he couldn't walk. And he said the
[1:09:44] man came to the church and he wanted
[1:09:46] prayer and he was coming to church and
[1:09:47] he prayed for him and God straightened
[1:09:49] his legs so that he could walk, he could
[1:09:50] ride a bicycle, he could move around.
[1:09:52] Amen. And then he come to the church for
[1:09:54] a while and then after a few years he
[1:09:57] faded away from the church and brother
[1:09:59] Abraham said he became the worst
[1:10:01] womanizer in the whole village.
[1:10:05] Now he's stuck in fornication and
[1:10:06] adultery and everybody's and everybody's
[1:10:09] mad at brother Abraham for praying for
[1:10:10] him
[1:10:13] because he becomes such a vile person.
[1:10:16] It would have been better for him to
[1:10:17] stay a and come to the church
[1:10:19] and raise his hands and praise God
[1:10:21] crippled so he wouldn't become a
[1:10:22] womanizer.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't need what we think we
[1:10:27] need.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe God has given us exactly what we
[1:10:32] need
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; for our protection.
[1:10:35] I think we have to as children of God
[1:10:37] change the way we think about our life
[1:10:40] and change the way we think about our
[1:10:42] circumstances and change the way we
[1:10:45] think about God.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Because God's not making a mistake.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; He never has.
[1:10:54] If you look at the Leodysian church age
[1:10:58] out of the church age book or out of the
[1:11:00] revelation chapter 3, he says,"I know
[1:11:03] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[1:11:06] hot. I would thou cold or hot. So then
[1:11:09] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:11:10] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[1:11:12] mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich
[1:11:16] and increased with goods and have need
[1:11:18] of nothing."
[1:11:20] This is a church that thought it was
[1:11:23] fine.
[1:11:25] Had everything it needed. It had money,
[1:11:27] had prestige. It was increased rich and
[1:11:30] increased with goods and had need of
[1:11:32] nothing. And God says, "And knowest thou
[1:11:35] not thou are wretched and miserable and
[1:11:38] poor and blind and naked."
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; This is what happened when it came to
[1:11:45] peace and prosperity. This church had
[1:11:47] got where it was respected. This church
[1:11:49] had got where everything had ease. It
[1:11:52] had riches, had lands, had property, had
[1:11:54] everything it needed. And the church
[1:11:56] now, the woman of the church is saying,
[1:11:58] "I'm rich and increased with goods and
[1:12:00] have need of nothing." That was the
[1:12:01] worst condition that church could be in.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Be so much better to say, "God, I need
[1:12:07] you. I don't have anything figured out.
[1:12:09] I don't have any way to make it happen.
[1:12:11] I don't know how to do what I need to do
[1:12:13] next. God, I'm completely dependent on
[1:12:15] you." That would have been a much better
[1:12:17] condition to be in.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But naturally they were rich and
[1:12:21] increased with goods and had needed
[1:12:22] nothing. But spiritually they were
[1:12:24] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:12:27] blind and naked.
[1:12:31] I would rather naturally have nothing to
[1:12:33] spiritually be clothed
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; and have eyesight and have riches of
[1:12:38] God.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Not under the earth but over the earth.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] Amen. In the thotiron church age, he
[1:12:48] said each age had its pressures.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; For example, a great burden of the last
[1:12:56] age is the pressure of riches, soft
[1:13:00] living and nervous tension in a complex
[1:13:02] age that we seem unfitted to live in. So
[1:13:06] every age had its challenges. It had its
[1:13:09] pressures. So what are the challenges of
[1:13:11] the last age? riches and soft living.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's not good for us.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; It's not good for us. Say, God, help us.
[1:13:25] I'm going look at this quote here. Many
[1:13:27] times we are led to that spot. Why is it
[1:13:30] if I go to church and I live before God
[1:13:32] with all my heart, I try to be just,
[1:13:33] honest person, and all that Christianity
[1:13:36] requires. Why is it that these things
[1:13:38] happen? But you know, many times they
[1:13:41] are blessings in disguisement. Many
[1:13:43] times we can't understand them. If
[1:13:45] you'll just let them alone, God will
[1:13:48] work it out just right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; This is a familiar scripture.
[1:13:59] And we know that all things work
[1:14:01] together for good to them that love God,
[1:14:05] to them who are the called according to
[1:14:07] his purpose.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Question is, is that statement true?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Is it completely true?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Is it always true?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So when it says all things,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; what does that mean?
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; All you guys always pass the test with
[1:14:26] flying colors.
[1:14:28] Does that even mean the bad things?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Are bad things included in all things?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; All things work together for good to
[1:14:38] them that love God, to them who are the
[1:14:41] called according to his purpose. Do you
[1:14:43] believe you're part of the called?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; That means all things work together for
[1:14:48] good. You said, "But my unsaved loved
[1:14:51] one," that unsaved loved one is keeping
[1:14:53] you in desperation.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; It's keeping you close to God. God is
[1:14:57] keeping you on your knees and you're
[1:14:58] interceding on behalf of them. You don't
[1:15:00] know what God's accomplishing by that.
[1:15:03] But we know all things work together.
[1:15:05] But you don't know my affliction, but
[1:15:06] you don't know the strain and distress.
[1:15:08] You don't know uh what's going on in my
[1:15:10] body. Listen, I don't know. Amen. I
[1:15:12] don't know what you're going through.
[1:15:14] You don't know all that I'm going
[1:15:15] through. But one thing I know is all
[1:15:16] things work together for good. And God
[1:15:18] does everything well. He does it
[1:15:19] perfect. And everything I need, he's
[1:15:21] given to me. And I'm thankful for it.
[1:15:23] Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I want to turn in our Bibles and I want
[1:15:27] read this last scripture. Let's turn to
[1:15:28] First Thessalonians together and we'll
[1:15:30] read this as we close here.
[1:15:38] 1 Thessalonians
[1:15:41] 5 and 18.
[1:15:49] 1 Thessalonians 5:18.
[1:15:52] In everything give thanks
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; for this is the will of God in Christ
[1:15:56] Jesus concerning you.
[1:15:59] Okay. What is everything?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Is it everything?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Is that kind of like the all in Romans
[1:16:05] 8?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Everything and all. So what am I
[1:16:08] supposed to give thanks for? In
[1:16:11] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:16:13] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:16:15] you. What has happened to you that
[1:16:18] hasn't crossed God's desk?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:21] What has come into your life that that
[1:16:23] God wasn't aware of? What's happened to
[1:16:26] you that took God by surprise?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; What was it that was outside of his
[1:16:30] power or outside of his knowledge? What
[1:16:32] couldn't he have prevented? Listen, he
[1:16:34] looks at Peter one day and said, "Peter,
[1:16:36] Satan has desired to sift thee like
[1:16:37] wheat."
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You know, I've told you this before, but
[1:16:41] to me it's easy. I said, "Well, you told
[1:16:42] him no, right? If I was Peter, that
[1:16:44] would have been like, yeah, okay, you
[1:16:46] told him he couldn't." But Jesus never
[1:16:48] said he couldn't. And he said, "Peter
[1:16:49] has asked, he's desired to sift you like
[1:16:51] wheat. But I have prayed for you that
[1:16:52] your faith fail not." Apparently, Peter
[1:16:55] needed to be sifted cuz if Peter didn't
[1:16:57] need to be sifted, he wouldn't be
[1:16:58] sifted. So, the sifting was good for
[1:17:00] Peter.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And Peter failed God in the sifting. And
[1:17:04] he denied the Lord three times. But God
[1:17:07] already knew he would do it and
[1:17:08] prophesied to him that he would. If God
[1:17:10] had fornowledge of his fall, why didn't
[1:17:12] God stop his fall? Because apparently
[1:17:15] that would do something to Peter that
[1:17:17] would further the kingdom's work.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; God would use that failure in Peter
[1:17:22] because now Peter come back humble and
[1:17:24] repentant. And Peter was full of pride,
[1:17:26] self assured. Amen. He was so confident
[1:17:29] in himself. And he was lifted up in
[1:17:31] pride and God would let him be sifted as
[1:17:33] wheat and fall flat on his face. And he
[1:17:35] didn't say, "I pray that you wouldn't be
[1:17:36] sifted. I pray that your faith would
[1:17:38] fail, not through your sifting." Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; So, what is it that you're going through
[1:17:44] that you say, God? I mean, we go to God.
[1:17:46] God, do you know what's happening to me?
[1:17:48] What a foolish thing to say.
[1:17:51] [Applause]
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Or, God, don't you see me?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Another foolish thing to say. But it's
[1:17:59] exactly how we feel. We feel abandoned.
[1:18:01] We feel left alone. We feel like surely
[1:18:04] God would not permit this to happen to
[1:18:06] me. And the reality is the prophet of
[1:18:08] God told us there's nothing that happens
[1:18:09] in the life of a believer that doesn't
[1:18:11] first cross God's desk.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; He couldn't touch Jonah. Amen. Without
[1:18:17] God's permission. He can't touch you
[1:18:18] without God's permission. He couldn't
[1:18:20] sift Peter without asking.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; And God a for Job. For God for Job.
[1:18:27] Amen. He put limitations on what the
[1:18:29] devil could do. You can do this, but you
[1:18:31] can't do that. And then later he would
[1:18:33] ask again, but you've got a hedge. He
[1:18:35] said, "But you can do this, but you
[1:18:36] can't do that." Amen. God knew exactly
[1:18:39] what was happening to Job. Job was
[1:18:41] confused. He had no understanding. He
[1:18:43] didn't know why. But God knew why
[1:18:45] because God was trying to answer his
[1:18:47] question and he was trying to accomplish
[1:18:48] his purpose.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; And that became a tremendous thing in
[1:18:53] Job's life and a tremendous thing for
[1:18:54] us. And it was a tremendous thing for
[1:18:57] Peter.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And I look back over all my strains and
[1:19:01] stresses and troubles and cries to the
[1:19:04] Lord. And there's times that I literally
[1:19:06] prayed all night long
[1:19:09] because I had no answer and I was in the
[1:19:11] midst of a horrible trial and I didn't
[1:19:13] know what to do and I prayed all night
[1:19:16] long. Listen, I never prayed all night
[1:19:18] long in my prosperity.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; I never got so close to God, so
[1:19:24] dependent on God, I never clutched his
[1:19:27] ankles
[1:19:30] and wrapped my arms around him and said,
[1:19:31] "I won't let you go." like I did when I
[1:19:34] got that desperate.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And I look back on that time in my life
[1:19:38] and God answered my prayer and he
[1:19:40] brought me through and he did a work in
[1:19:42] my life and I'm thankful for that time.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; God is good and he does good and he does
[1:19:53] what's right. And even the thing that
[1:19:55] doesn't feel good is good.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham's nervous tension didn't
[1:20:00] feel good. His sour stomach didn't feel
[1:20:02] good. is getting the blues didn't feel
[1:20:04] good,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; but it was important.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Paul's thorn in the flesh didn't feel
[1:20:10] good. Whatever we go through certainly
[1:20:12] doesn't feel good, and we don't call it
[1:20:14] good, but it works together for good.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And if it works together for good, then
[1:20:18] in everything we can give thanks.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord. You know what I
[1:20:25] need and you know what's best." That
[1:20:27] doesn't mean we still don't believe for
[1:20:29] deliverance. We believe for deliverance.
[1:20:31] We believe for healing. We believe for
[1:20:33] miracles. We believe for God to perform
[1:20:35] his word. But in the process, if God
[1:20:37] allowed it to come, then something
[1:20:39] good's going to come from it. And I'm
[1:20:41] excited to see what God will do
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; through it all.
[1:20:45] Amen.
[1:20:47] All things work together for the good.
[1:20:52] And in everything
[1:20:55] give thanks
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; for this is the will of God concerning
[1:20:59] thee.
[1:21:00] I got a feeling if we could just change
[1:21:02] our attitude towards trials, it would
[1:21:04] change so much in our life.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. Musicians, if you'd
[1:21:09] please come. Brother Blake, if you'd
[1:21:11] please come.
[1:21:15] We need troubles.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; We need them. We need trials.
[1:21:24] We need them.
[1:21:26] Our faith has to be tested. Our faith
[1:21:28] has to overcome. We have to be proved.
[1:21:30] All of those things have to happen. We
[1:21:32] need them.
[1:21:34] But if I could thank God for everything
[1:21:37] in my life and changed my attitude,
[1:21:41] I've told you this before, but in me,
[1:21:43] this is just me personal. Chad, the
[1:21:46] greatest torment of every trial in my
[1:21:49] life is the mental battle that I go
[1:21:51] through trying to fight the trial and
[1:21:54] wondering why and what I did wrong and
[1:21:56] where's God in this and what and really
[1:21:59] the greatest most horrible time is the
[1:22:02] battle that rages in my mind every time
[1:22:04] I hit a trial. But when I just can click
[1:22:07] over and say, "Praise be to God, he'll
[1:22:09] see me through and all of this work
[1:22:11] together for good." Amen. It's amazing
[1:22:13] how different a trial can be when our
[1:22:15] mindset towards the trial changes.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And when we say, "So be it." That's what
[1:22:22] happened to Paul. Paul didn't want the
[1:22:24] thorn in his flesh. God, take this away.
[1:22:27] God, take this away. God, take this
[1:22:29] away. But when God told him that there
[1:22:31] was a purpose in in his life, his
[1:22:33] mindset towards it changed. And when his
[1:22:34] mindset towards it changed, everything
[1:22:36] changed.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And he began to glory in his
[1:22:39] affirmities. I say, "God, let my mind be
[1:22:43] changed."
[1:22:45] Now, in a trial, if I could just say,
[1:22:47] "God, thank you for the opportunity to
[1:22:49] get closer to you right now."
[1:22:51] Just something simple like that. Thank
[1:22:54] you, God, that you've drawn me closer in
[1:22:56] prayer through this trial. Thank you,
[1:22:57] God, that I'm going to see your
[1:22:59] delivering hand. I'm going to see you
[1:23:01] perform your word. Thank you, God, for
[1:23:03] this opportunity. Thank you for what
[1:23:04] you're doing in my life. And thank you
[1:23:06] for what this is going to accomplish.
[1:23:07] And I think if we can mean it from the
[1:23:09] bottom of our hearts and let our mindset
[1:23:11] change towards our trial, I think we'll
[1:23:13] find out that trials change.
[1:23:16] They change.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it goes from being the worst
[1:23:21] thing that ever happened to you to a
[1:23:23] necessary part of the Christian journey,
[1:23:26] then it changes everything in our lives.
[1:23:29] It isn't where are you God? What's
[1:23:31] happening? Where am I? Do you know who I
[1:23:32] am? Am I even a child of God? put all of
[1:23:34] that to rest because that that's all
[1:23:37] despair,
[1:23:39] but put it all away and say, "God,
[1:23:41] whatever you're accomplishing in me,
[1:23:42] accomplish it, Lord. I yield myself to
[1:23:45] you
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; and it changes everything."
[1:23:48] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together
[1:23:50] and pray. Dear heavenly father, we thank
[1:23:53] you, Lord, that you've given us such
[1:23:55] wisdom in this generation,
[1:23:57] in this time that we're on the earth.
[1:23:59] You sent a prophetic voice to show us in
[1:24:02] the scriptures that you are perfect in
[1:24:05] every way. We can look back through the
[1:24:08] Bible and we can take every character
[1:24:10] and we can go through their life and the
[1:24:12] trials and the tribulations and we can
[1:24:14] see that they were all perfect. They
[1:24:16] were all necessary and they all produced
[1:24:18] something good. And God, if that's true
[1:24:21] for them, it can be true for us. And
[1:24:24] Lord, I thank you, God, that you are so
[1:24:27] good to us.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you won't let us fall away.
[1:24:31] You won't let us, Lord, just move away
[1:24:34] with pride and arrogancy and prosperity.
[1:24:36] But God, that you're constantly bringing
[1:24:39] us back closer to you. And God, I thank
[1:24:42] you for it, Lord. I pray you bless us as
[1:24:45] a people as we move forward, God. May we
[1:24:47] have the right mindset towards
[1:24:48] everything we face in life. May we think
[1:24:51] the way you've taught us to think. May
[1:24:52] we see with prophetic vision. May we see
[1:24:55] with eagle vision being lifted higher
[1:24:57] than the trial and being able to put it
[1:25:00] in perspective of your word. May we be
[1:25:02] able to walk forward with confidence
[1:25:04] that in everything all things are
[1:25:07] working together for good. And God, I
[1:25:10] want to say thank you. I thank you, God,
[1:25:14] for loving me.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I thank you, God, for correcting me. I
[1:25:18] thank you for chasing me. I thank you
[1:25:21] for putting guard rails up in my life.
[1:25:24] I thank you for stopping me in my tracks
[1:25:26] and drawing me back to yourself in
[1:25:28] desperate prayer. I thank you for not
[1:25:30] letting my prosperity take me away and
[1:25:33] my peace to take me away, but you're
[1:25:35] constantly bringing me back to yourself.
[1:25:38] And I want to say thank you, Lord. You
[1:25:41] are so good and you do all things well.
[1:25:43] And I also want to say, Lord, that I
[1:25:45] trust you. I trust your judgment. I
[1:25:49] trust your hand. I trust your guidance.
[1:25:52] And Lord, I trust you with my life. For
[1:25:55] you know what's best. For Lord, it's not
[1:25:57] in strength and wisdom, but it's in
[1:26:00] weakness. It's in need. In my weakness,
[1:26:04] your strength is made perfect. In my
[1:26:06] need, your might, Lord, comes on the
[1:26:08] scene. And you show yourself mighty on
[1:26:10] my behalf. And God, I pray that you
[1:26:13] would continue to keep us close.
[1:26:16] Help us, Lord, not to stray like Solomon
[1:26:18] strayed and so many others. But help us
[1:26:20] to stay close to you and be thankful
[1:26:23] that you're a loving father. And you
[1:26:26] won't let us stray away. You won't let
[1:26:28] us go too far. You won't let us get uh
[1:26:32] lifted up in pride or caught up in our
[1:26:34] own success, but you'll constantly keep
[1:26:37] bringing us back to the reality of our
[1:26:39] need for you. for that is the most
[1:26:41] loving thing you can do for us is to
[1:26:44] keep us in that atmosphere.
[1:26:46] We love you God. We surrender our lives
[1:26:48] to you. Give us the eyes that we might
[1:26:51] see so that we Lord that we don't get

[1:27:11] name we pray. Amen.
[1:27:15] Amen. Blake,
[1:27:18] thank you
[1:27:21] Jesus
[1:27:25] for the things that you have brought me
[1:27:30] through.

[1:27:43] thank you.

[1:28:01] through.
[1:28:04] No, I can't repay with all my heart. I'd
[1:28:08] like to say,
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:13] thank you
[1:28:17] and thank
[1:28:19] you
[1:28:22] Jesus

[1:28:47] Through it all,

[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:04] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:29:10] Through it all,
[1:29:15] through it all,
[1:29:20] I learn to depend
[1:29:25] on his word.
[1:29:32] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[1:29:38] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[1:29:43] There have been times I didn't know
[1:29:47] right from wrong.
[1:29:53] But in every situation,
[1:29:58] God gave blessed consolation
[1:30:03] that my trials came to only make me
[1:30:09] strong.

[1:30:29] I learn to trust in God
[1:30:35] through it all.
[1:30:40] Through it all,
[1:30:45] I learn to live
[1:30:49] on his word.
[1:30:55] So I thank God for the mountains
[1:31:00] and I thank him for the valleyies.
[1:31:06] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[1:31:10] me through.
[1:31:16] For if I never had a problem,
[1:31:22] I wouldn't know that he can solve it. I
[1:31:27] never know what faith in God can do.
[1:31:36] Through it all,
[1:31:42] through it all,
[1:31:46] I learn to trust in Jesus.

[1:31:57] through it all.
[1:32:02] through it all.
[1:32:07] Learn to get on his food. I thank God.
[1:32:16] So I thank God for the mountains
[1:32:21] and I thank him for the valleys
[1:32:26] and I thank him for the storms he's
[1:32:31] brought me through.
[1:32:37] For if I never had a problem,
[1:32:42] I wouldn't know that he could solve it.
[1:32:48] Never know what faith in God can do.
[1:32:53] Through it all,
[1:32:57] through it all,
[1:33:02] through it all.
[1:33:06] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[1:33:11] I learn to trust in God.
[1:33:16] Through it all.
[1:33:21] Through it all.
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:30] God is is good.
