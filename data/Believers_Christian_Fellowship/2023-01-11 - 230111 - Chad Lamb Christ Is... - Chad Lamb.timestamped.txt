[16:19] [Music]
[16:20] o Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[16:23] the privilege of being here once again
[16:25] God lord as we turn our hearts to hear
[16:28] from you to hear your word I pray God
[16:30] that you would just Minister unto us
[16:32] Lord that you would break the bread of
[16:35] life and Portion it out to each one of
[16:37] us and may we receive what we have need
[16:38] of we love you father and we thank you
[16:41] for your goodness and for your mercy
[16:44] pray that you have your way with us in
[16:46] every way today take this vessel under
[16:48] your control Lord and preach your word
[16:51] speak Eternal Words of Life Lord that
[16:53] bring life to our souls God that you
[16:56] would bring out of us all that you've
[16:57] placed in us that needs to be manifest
[16:59] in this day would you Lord bring it
[17:02] forth by your spirit may you accomplish
[17:05] your work through Us in this end time
[17:08] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[17:11] amen
[17:12] and God bless you let's look at our
[17:14] Bibles to Hebrews chapter 13.
[17:18] if you turn there and I want to just
[17:20] give you a quick update on little Marcus
[17:22] losing off Ellie and Natasha are doing
[17:24] well a little Marcus is doing well I got
[17:27] an update from Brother Ilya today I said
[17:29] Marcus is doing great and he's on zero
[17:32] support or oxygen whatsoever his lungs
[17:35] are working absorbing everything's
[17:37] working fine so now they just want to
[17:39] monitor him for a period of time make
[17:40] sure he's okay before they send him home
[17:42] so God has done a wonderful work and a
[17:44] quick work for that little baby so we're
[17:46] excited about that it was good to hear
[17:49] about brother lets the surgery going
[17:50] well and we pray that he can get home
[17:52] quickly and recover so remember him in
[17:54] prayer and also we had an opportunity to
[17:56] go to the viewing for brother Robert
[17:58] Douglas and just remember to keep the
[18:00] family in prayer we're thankful that our
[18:03] brother is released from this world of
[18:06] Toil and care but the family that's left
[18:08] behind sure is grieving and so we want
[18:10] to remember them remember his wife Linda
[18:12] and sister Tammy who fellowships here
[18:15] with us I was thinking when I was there
[18:17] talking to Mr Linda I thought brother
[18:20] Bob was really good friends with Brother
[18:23] John Matthews they used to go out
[18:25] witnessing together and they were like a
[18:27] team you know and I know some person in
[18:29] the sixth Dimension is really happy to
[18:30] have their buddy back amen and so I'm
[18:33] sure they've had a wonderful reunion and
[18:35] fellowship and I thank God that's what
[18:38] we all have to look forward to a
[18:39] wonderful reunion and fellowship one day
[18:42] so we thank God for that so just
[18:44] continue to remember them as well
[18:46] let's look at the Hebrews chapter 13.
[18:51] Hebrews chapter 13 verse 8.
[18:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[19:01] today and forever God bless you as you
[19:04] take your seats
[19:06] amen
[19:08] brother Franco if it's ready you can
[19:10] pull that PowerPoint up I decided at the
[19:12] last minute to put my notes on
[19:15] PowerPoint because there's quite a few
[19:16] uh quotes of the Prophet that I want to
[19:19] read and it's and I don't want to just
[19:21] read I want us all to look at them
[19:23] together amen so I I hope that they're
[19:25] all in order because I flew at the last
[19:27] minute to put this together I just
[19:29] caught the inspiration last second to
[19:31] get it on uh PowerPoint so I hope it
[19:34] works out but I want to tell this Christ
[19:36] is and I mean that's a that's a big
[19:39] statement Christ is it can be followed
[19:41] up by many things and we're not trying
[19:44] to you know we're not trying to spend
[19:45] the next 12 hours or 12 months standing
[19:49] here trying to incorporate all or
[19:51] explain all and preach all that Christ
[19:52] is but I just want to take that
[19:54] statement and I want to look at that and
[19:56] just think about that for a minute and
[19:58] we may just get one little snippet of
[20:00] this but I want to look at Christ is
[20:01] because you know we live in a world that
[20:04] and we as Believers we we we use
[20:07] terminology all the time time and we we
[20:09] throw terms out and we speak in Bible
[20:11] terms and in message terms and but
[20:13] sometimes it's good to stop and say what
[20:15] is it I mean when I say that what am I
[20:17] referring to what all does this
[20:19] Encompass and what is the depth of my
[20:22] understanding in this and so I want to
[20:24] look at that and Christ is and we see
[20:26] here in Hebrews 8 it says Jesus Christ
[20:29] the same yesterday and today and forever
[20:33] and that's such a that's such an
[20:35] interesting interesting scripture
[20:37] because it makes uh it makes such a
[20:40] statement that Jesus Christ is the same
[20:42] yesterday and today and forever
[20:45] but we know that Jesus the man the flesh
[20:48] body that God made to dwell in amen that
[20:51] that it it was made at some point it was
[20:54] created right so it was it was not that
[20:58] body was not on the earth in existence
[21:00] before amen and now that body is is on
[21:04] the right hand of the father it's not
[21:06] here present now and so it's interesting
[21:09] when he says Jesus Christ is saying
[21:11] yesterday today and forever he must be
[21:13] referring to something other than just
[21:16] that one aspect amen
[21:18] there's a there's a fuller dip deeper
[21:20] richer meaning than what our carnal mind
[21:23] if we just only take it as the man that
[21:26] was born through the Virgin Mary and
[21:28] lived 33 years and died at Calvary and
[21:30] resurrected again and send it on high if
[21:32] that's it it's hard to say Jesus Christ
[21:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[21:36] amen but we know that that was an
[21:39] expression of Christ amen that was
[21:41] Christ expressed in full measure as a
[21:44] human being as a man so it was the full
[21:46] expression of Christ in one figure
[21:49] man but it wasn't the only expression of
[21:52] Christ
[21:55] so I want to look at this and and read
[21:57] as we go here
[21:58] and why it had to be Shepherds the
[22:00] prophet said and Christ is the word
[22:03] the anointed word made manifest
[22:06] though I love the way he says that we
[22:08] know Christ is the word he also says God
[22:10] is the word
[22:11] he said the word and the Holy Spirit are
[22:14] the self-same thing so so it's all the
[22:17] word and I find this so amazing when it
[22:19] comes down to it Christ is all and in
[22:22] all
[22:23] right he is the expression of God Amen
[22:27] and God is everything and so we look at
[22:29] these uh we terms will use God we'll use
[22:32] the father we'll use uh Christ we'll use
[22:35] uh Jesus Christ the son of God the holy
[22:39] spirit all of these terms but it's all
[22:42] God
[22:43] it's all God but it's God in a
[22:46] manifestation it's God in a way a mode
[22:49] of operation God and an expression and a
[22:51] way he wants to reveal himself or
[22:53] Express himself so Christ is the word
[22:55] the anointed word may manifest
[23:00] and then he goes in this message three
[23:02] kinds of Believers he says can you
[23:03] receive the word all the word all of
[23:05] Christ Christ is the anointed word he is
[23:09] the word anointed Christ means the
[23:11] anointed one the anointed word for that
[23:14] day made manifest
[23:16] so we we're really nailing this down
[23:19] Amen in the in the aspect of this
[23:21] statement Christ is that I want to look
[23:23] at Christ is the anointed word for that
[23:27] day
[23:28] okay we know these things but oh it's so
[23:32] much fun to look at this and realize
[23:34] what God has done the mystery that has
[23:36] been laying in the Bible hidden amen
[23:38] because we know that the mystery of God
[23:41] was revealed in the end time by the
[23:42] seventh angel
[23:43] and the sounding of the seventh angel
[23:45] the mystery of God shall be revealed and
[23:47] we know that Christ is the mystery of
[23:49] God revealed so God has revealed his
[23:52] mystery in Christ amen in Christ Jesus
[23:55] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[23:56] forever and Christ is the anointed word
[23:59] of that day so wherever you find the
[24:01] anointed word in a day you find Christ
[24:04] and that is a revelation of God
[24:08] then when we get to the end time amen
[24:10] God sounds the seven Thunders opens to
[24:13] us to see us and reveals the mystery
[24:15] that's been laying in the whole Bible
[24:16] and the Mystery that's been laying in
[24:18] the whole Bible was expressed all the
[24:20] way back in Eden when God was going to
[24:23] make man in his own image and his own
[24:25] likeness and he made them male and
[24:27] female and placed him in his creation to
[24:29] rule over his creation that was God
[24:32] expressing himself as male and female
[24:34] and then we know that that image was
[24:36] ruined so he could rebuild it back so
[24:39] that he could express all of his
[24:40] attributes and all of his family
[24:44] and restore it back to that picture many
[24:48] fold
[24:50] and and that is the mystery that's been
[24:53] revealed in the end time the mystery of
[24:55] God becoming tangible expressing himself
[24:58] amen becoming tangible in his creation
[25:02] so Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[25:06] and whenever you find Christ it's
[25:09] revealing God
[25:10] and and what is Christ is the anointed
[25:14] word for that day
[25:17] praise God
[25:20] he says
[25:22] Christ has identified the same in all
[25:24] generations now I absolutely love that
[25:27] title
[25:28] especially in the subject we're talking
[25:30] about Christ is identified the same in
[25:33] all generations Jesus Christ the same
[25:35] yesterday today and forever you find his
[25:38] characteristics and you can find him
[25:41] and it's amazing when he says Jesus
[25:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[25:44] forever it's not always the same exact
[25:46] expression
[25:48] will find that it was Christ in Moses it
[25:50] was Christ and no it was Christ and
[25:52] David it was Christ in Jeremiah I mean
[25:54] these were all expressing Christ parts
[25:57] of Christ the word for their day being
[25:59] expressed amen and it wasn't always the
[26:01] exact same expression it wasn't always a
[26:04] building an ark it wasn't always leading
[26:06] a a people out of bondage it wasn't
[26:09] always a preaching that the people were
[26:11] going into captivity it wasn't always a
[26:14] king after God's own arm and every
[26:16] expression was expressing another part
[26:18] of the word Another Part Of God was
[26:21] being expressed and it was Christ in
[26:23] that day
[26:25] but it's the same yesterday today and
[26:28] forever what makes it the same it's
[26:31] always the word being expressed for that
[26:34] day and season
[26:35] that makes it the same that makes it
[26:37] Jesus Christ the same so now he says
[26:40] when Moses come he could not have took
[26:43] Noah's message neither could Moses or
[26:45] Noah took Moses message and neither
[26:46] could Joshua have took on any other
[26:49] message see each one Isaiah could not
[26:51] have took another's message each message
[26:53] is for that age
[26:54] and with the age that we're living in
[26:56] when the word is interpreted God's
[26:59] speaking that word out and making the
[27:00] word for that age live giving the
[27:02] interpretation of it that is God in
[27:05] Christ
[27:06] manifesting see because Christ is the
[27:09] word and when the word is made manifest
[27:11] that is Christ in every age
[27:15] so Christ is
[27:18] the word may manifest in that age
[27:21] praise God
[27:26] so
[27:27] we look at this quote God will judge the
[27:30] world
[27:30] not by any certain group
[27:34] he will judge the World by Jesus Christ
[27:37] and Christ is the word he is the word in
[27:41] the beginning was the word the word was
[27:42] with God and the Word was God and the
[27:44] Word was made flesh and one Among Us so
[27:47] he is the expressed word of God in every
[27:49] age he makes him the same yesterday
[27:53] today and forever so what makes him the
[27:56] same yesterday today and forever is that
[27:59] he is the expressed word of God in every
[28:01] age so when the word of God is being
[28:04] expressed manifested fleshed out that is
[28:07] always Christ
[28:09] amen
[28:11] praise be to God I don't want to miss
[28:14] something there's yeah there's something
[28:16] here I do not want to miss
[28:19] so so we realize that Christ
[28:24] was here all the way in the beginning
[28:29] um let's look at John 1 1 together
[28:51] so in John 1 1 it says in the beginning
[28:53] was the word and the Word was with God
[28:55] and the Word was God
[28:58] and the same was in the beginning with
[28:59] God and all things were made by him and
[29:02] without him was not anything made that
[29:04] was made
[29:06] in him was life and the life was the
[29:08] light of men and the light shineth in
[29:10] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[29:11] it not so we're talking about the word
[29:14] the word was with God the Word was God
[29:18] and now all things were made by him by
[29:21] who by the word
[29:23] okay
[29:24] so let's go over to Colossians chapter
[29:26] one
[29:32] Colossians chapter 1.
[29:37] when we get over to Colossians chapter
[29:39] one let's look at verse 15.
[29:47] you know Colossians 1 and 15. who is the
[29:49] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[29:52] of every creature now what are we
[29:54] speaking about here we're talking about
[29:55] Jesus Christ
[29:57] clearly he is the image of the invisible
[29:59] God the firstborn of every creature for
[30:01] by him were all things created that are
[30:03] in heaven and that are in Earth visible
[30:06] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[30:08] dominions or principalities or Powers
[30:10] all things were created by Him and for
[30:13] him and he is before all things and by
[30:16] him all things consist and he is the
[30:19] head of the body the church who is the
[30:21] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[30:23] that in all things he might have the
[30:26] preeminence for it pleased the father
[30:27] that in him should all fullness dwell so
[30:30] now he's referring to the person of
[30:32] Jesus Christ and now Christ and this
[30:35] word John 1 1 and Colossians 1 are the
[30:39] same
[30:40] he made all things by the word but now
[30:43] when when we talk in the beginning was
[30:46] the word and God said let there be amen
[30:49] that was the coming forth of Christ
[30:52] amen and as that word let there be light
[30:55] manifest into light that was Christ
[30:59] all the way back there with a word made
[31:00] manifest and that day was Christ
[31:04] but it was not known as Jesus because it
[31:07] didn't have an Earthly name it was
[31:09] Christ until amen we get to the the
[31:12] prophecy coming through a virgin and
[31:14] Virgin Mary and was told what his name
[31:17] will be and Joseph was told what his
[31:18] name will be so God selected his name
[31:20] Jesus so it's Jesus Christ amen but
[31:24] before that time it was always Christ
[31:27] it's always been Christ but it didn't it
[31:29] was not known as Jesus Christ until all
[31:32] the word and fullness was encompassed in
[31:34] a body amen that would be the body that
[31:37] God would create for himself to dwell in
[31:39] and he would take the Earthly name as
[31:41] Jesus Christ and from then on forward
[31:44] and backwards you can refer to the word
[31:47] as Jesus Christ
[31:48] [Music]
[31:50] so so there was a time now we know the
[31:55] word is eternal it's not bound by time
[31:57] but I'm looking at an Earthly
[31:58] perspective now from an Earthly
[32:00] perspective there was a time before
[32:03] Jesus there was still Christ
[32:07] that makes sense
[32:08] we know in the mind of God in the
[32:10] Eternal Realms there's no before and
[32:11] after
[32:13] is eternal but there was a time but then
[32:16] later that expression would be bottled
[32:18] up in Jesus and then we knew what this
[32:20] was now we say in the beginning was the
[32:23] word that's a title but now we can give
[32:25] the word a name
[32:27] it's Jesus Christ
[32:29] praise God so let's go to Hebrews
[32:31] chapter 11.
[32:41] Hebrews chapter 11.
[32:45] and let's go to verse 24.
[32:51] Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith Moses when he
[32:54] was come to years refused to be called
[32:56] the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[32:58] rather to suffer Affliction with the
[33:00] people of God than to enjoy the
[33:02] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[33:05] the reproach of Christ
[33:08] this was before the manifestation of
[33:11] Jesus the man
[33:13] it was still Christ
[33:15] and so now with this is Christ we know
[33:19] that this is Hebrews 13 8 this is Jesus
[33:21] Christ the same yesterday today and
[33:23] forever but he wasn't known as Jesus
[33:25] Christ in that day
[33:28] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[33:30] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[33:32] he had respect unto the recompense of
[33:34] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[33:36] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[33:38] endured is seeing him who is invisible
[33:41] amen what was the what was the reproach
[33:44] of Christ it was the reproach of the
[33:45] word for that day
[33:48] that he was part of these slaves and he
[33:51] was here to as a redeemer he's one
[33:53] selected to to be the vessel that God
[33:55] would use to call him out and he was
[33:57] there representing God because God would
[33:59] come down and speak to Moses in a
[34:01] burning bush and say I've heard the
[34:03] cries of my people and I have come down
[34:05] to deliver them now come I'm sending you
[34:07] so he was going to be the representation
[34:10] amen of God's plan and God's word for
[34:13] that day
[34:15] so what was Moses reflecting what was
[34:18] Moses manifesting Moses was projecting
[34:21] Christ
[34:22] his life became the projection of Christ
[34:25] amen and later what was in Moses would
[34:29] be in Jesus Christ because all the word
[34:32] was there and now have a name so we know
[34:34] what was it what was it that Moses first
[34:37] took off for he forsook all for Jesus
[34:39] Christ
[34:40] but in that day he didn't know him as
[34:42] Jesus Christ he just knew it as the word
[34:44] of God
[34:46] and that was Christ
[34:50] let's go to First Corinthians 10.
[35:01] First Corinthians
[35:07] First Corinthians chapter 10.
[35:13] and verse 1.
[35:17] First Corinthians 10 and 1.
[35:25] let me see if I got that right yeah
[35:27] let's go down to verse four
[35:29] and did all drink the same spiritual
[35:32] drink
[35:33] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[35:35] that followed them and that rock was
[35:38] Christ
[35:41] now we know that there was a physical
[35:43] Rock there was a rock that Moses smote
[35:46] with the rod and as he smote the rod The
[35:48] Rock cracked open amen and water came
[35:51] gushing out but that was a natural type
[35:53] of something spiritual that was going on
[35:55] in that day because we know that there
[35:58] was a rock that followed the children of
[35:59] Israel and he said they did all drink of
[36:01] that spiritual Rock now Paul's not
[36:04] talking about the rock that that he hit
[36:06] with the rod now he's talking about the
[36:09] spiritual rock that followed him and
[36:11] that rock was Christ it was Christ who
[36:13] was the Revelation for that day that was
[36:16] opened by the prophet in that day and
[36:18] out came Living Water for them to drink
[36:20] and to live by
[36:22] so now we see that Christ Christ was in
[36:27] Moses's day
[36:29] and he was the same in that day as he is
[36:33] this day
[36:35] but we're not wandering through a desert
[36:38] we don't have a physical man named Moses
[36:41] with with a long beard walking us
[36:43] through a physical desert amen but what
[36:46] was happening that day is happening this
[36:48] day that's happened every day it's
[36:50] always been a day when Christ amen is
[36:53] being manifested and God is revealing
[36:55] himself to the people and that is Christ
[36:57] the anointed word for that day
[37:02] and we have no problem saying that rock
[37:04] was Jesus Christ
[37:07] is that right does anybody have a
[37:08] problem saying that rock was Jesus
[37:10] Christ
[37:11] does anybody have a problem saying that
[37:13] it was Jesus Christ that Moses forsook
[37:15] Egypt for
[37:18] but that was there there was no physical
[37:21] appearance of Jesus Christ it was the
[37:24] word for that day
[37:25] and if that was true then could it be
[37:28] true now
[37:31] that in order for it to be Jesus Christ
[37:33] the same yesterday today and ever and
[37:35] Jesus Christ being made manifest in
[37:37] Jesus Christ declaring himself it
[37:39] doesn't mean there needs to be the
[37:40] Corporal body of Jesus Christ for Jesus
[37:43] Christ to be here revealing himself
[37:46] amen
[37:48] so we see in fact let's go over to
[37:51] Revelations chapter 10.
[38:05] Revelation chapter 10.
[38:10] in verse 1.
[38:13] I was never sure never sure how things
[38:15] will go but we're certainly not going
[38:16] the direction I thought but praise God
[38:19] I just encourage you to keep pulling
[38:21] because I'm starting to have fun and I
[38:22] like it this way
[38:25] Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and I saw
[38:27] another Mighty Angel come down from
[38:29] heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[38:30] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[38:32] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[38:34] pillars of fire now we see this is a
[38:36] very similar description that we find
[38:38] over in Revelation chapter one and it's
[38:40] a description of Jesus Christ
[38:43] right
[38:44] so we see that there's a mighty Angel
[38:46] come down from heaven
[38:48] this is not a mighty flesh body
[38:52] it's a mighty Angel this is a spiritual
[38:56] invisible thing that's coming
[38:59] right and and it come down from heaven
[39:02] close to the cloud and the rainbow was
[39:03] upon his head and his face was where the
[39:05] sun and his fetus pillars of fire and he
[39:08] had a in his hand a little book open
[39:10] which in Revelation 5 was closed now
[39:12] it's open and he set his right foot upon
[39:14] the sea and his left foot upon the Earth
[39:15] and cried with the loud voices when a
[39:17] lion roared and when he had cried seven
[39:19] Thunders uttered their voices so now
[39:21] brother Branham comes to this scripture
[39:23] and he says the mighty Angel he said the
[39:26] angel of the Covenant only Christ it
[39:29] could be
[39:30] right so does anybody have any problems
[39:33] saying this is Jesus Christ the same
[39:35] yesterday today and forever who is this
[39:37] Christ it's Jesus Christ
[39:39] but not the body that was nailed to the
[39:42] cross this is the Angel of the Lord the
[39:44] angel of the Covenant this is the the
[39:46] mighty Angel this is Christ coming down
[39:49] from heaven with an open book in his
[39:51] hand
[39:55] and then he cries with a loud voice and
[39:58] seven Thunders out of their voice and
[39:59] they're sealed but now in the days of
[40:01] the voice of the seventh angel amen the
[40:03] mystery of God shall be revealed as he's
[40:04] declared to his servants the prophets
[40:06] and brother Branham comes to this
[40:08] portion of scripture and he says now he
[40:10] says the seventh angel which is the
[40:12] seventh Church age messenger which is
[40:14] William Branham will be on Earth at the
[40:17] time of this coming who came Jesus
[40:20] Christ came
[40:23] I I don't have any problem saying that
[40:27] but not the Corporal body coming but the
[40:31] mighty Angel amen the fullness of the
[40:33] person of Christ as he brought the
[40:35] fullness of the word the headship coming
[40:37] to the body
[40:39] praise be to God
[40:42] praise God
[40:44] and so we see
[40:46] so he is the expressed word of God in
[40:49] every age
[40:50] that makes him the same yesterday today
[40:53] and forever
[40:55] now what was so unique is when in the
[40:59] Old Testament as we're coming down to
[41:01] the prophets the Patriarchs and the
[41:03] prophets and moving our way through it's
[41:05] always a portion of Christ
[41:08] a manifestation of Christ a portion of
[41:10] Christ a a a a part for That season
[41:14] that's being played out and then it was
[41:16] all the way down through until it comes
[41:18] to the person of Jesus Christ himself in
[41:21] fullness now everything that they were
[41:23] every portion that was portioned down
[41:25] and every portion that will be portioned
[41:28] out in the future was all bottled and
[41:30] confined in one body and that body was
[41:32] the fullness of the word
[41:34] is that right so now this wasn't a day
[41:37] of partial this was a manifestation of
[41:40] fullness
[41:43] amen that's the difference that's why
[41:45] you couldn't say you could say it was
[41:47] Christ and Moses but you couldn't say
[41:49] that was the person of Jesus Christ or
[41:51] all of Christ you can't say that amen
[41:53] because it was a portion
[41:56] praise God
[41:58] but you shouldn't say that wasn't Jesus
[42:00] Christ
[42:03] you see what I'm saying
[42:04] the line is so tight you can't deny that
[42:07] that was Christ
[42:08] but it wasn't the full expression the
[42:10] full expression was going to come
[42:12] and we saw it
[42:14] now in the unveiling of God he says
[42:15] notice veiled in human flesh Moses with
[42:18] that word speaking what was to be later
[42:19] put behind Badger skin so is Christ Our
[42:22] Moses Christ is our Moses he was God
[42:25] veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity
[42:28] and flesh that's right and he's the same
[42:31] yesterday today and forever
[42:34] what does he say is here God veiled in
[42:36] humanity and now he says he's the same
[42:38] yesterday today and forever
[42:42] amen
[42:43] he was veiled by Badger skins he was
[42:45] veiled and this time he was veiled in a
[42:48] man now notice same yesterday today and
[42:50] forever promised his word to this age he
[42:53] is still Christ The Promised word to
[42:56] this age veiled in human flesh
[42:59] the word is God
[43:02] so he's still Christ The Promised word
[43:04] to this age but where is he veiled in
[43:07] human flesh
[43:09] and we saw it veiled in that prophet
[43:14] he said the word is God
[43:17] the anointing is a person
[43:19] the word Christ means anointed one the
[43:21] anointed one then Moses was Christ in
[43:23] his day he was the anointed when
[43:25] Jeremiah was Christ in his day with a
[43:27] portion of the word for that day but
[43:29] when Jesus came he came as the Redeemer
[43:32] anointed one and that was both Moses and
[43:34] all that was in Moses and all the word
[43:36] and all the godhead bodily was in him
[43:38] that's the reason the whole temple veil
[43:41] rant and The Mercy Seat come in perfect
[43:42] view he was the anointed one notice now
[43:46] the veil in human flesh
[43:48] the the promised word to this age must
[43:52] also be veiled
[43:55] sin loving church members and sinners
[43:57] cannot see it because of the human Veil
[44:02] you say this is Christ being made
[44:04] manifest and people say where are the
[44:06] nail scars this is Jesus Christ amen but
[44:09] where are the nail scars it's the same
[44:11] as it was in that day's the same as it
[44:13] is in this day it's Christ being made
[44:15] manifest through flesh
[44:18] through Veil through a veil
[44:23] says
[44:24] in the message there is a man here who
[44:26] can turn on the line
[44:28] said God's word comes only by the Bible
[44:30] God's Bible is the printed form of the
[44:33] Son of God because the Bible said that
[44:35] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:38] it's God revealing himself through
[44:40] Christ and Christ is the word
[44:44] and remember we're still on the topic of
[44:46] Christ is
[44:48] God's revealing himself through Christ
[44:51] because God God if we could I'm going to
[44:56] say things because I only know how to as
[44:58] a human being right language is so
[45:00] inferior to express this but before God
[45:04] expressed his thought and how reform he
[45:07] expressed it
[45:08] we can say in word but that that's
[45:10] really for us to understand something
[45:12] because God's an eternal spirit so in
[45:15] the day when there was nothing there to
[45:17] hear him was it an audible voice with
[45:19] vocal cords like these in human lips
[45:23] right so God spoke what does it mean to
[45:26] speak it means to take the thought and
[45:28] declare it
[45:29] we do that by speaking but sometimes we
[45:32] write it down but when we write it down
[45:34] it's still expressing a thought it's
[45:35] still a word and it still speaks
[45:37] something
[45:38] so God we know his first expression was
[45:42] the logos amen his first expression was
[45:44] something that came out of him that was
[45:46] the word and brother bear said he saw
[45:48] brother remember said it was as a
[45:50] glowing amber light a pillar of fire and
[45:53] that was God now beginning to speak his
[45:56] word
[45:58] so so when when saying don't don't think
[46:01] brother Ted got sacrilegious and denied
[46:03] everything because you may not have
[46:05] heard anything that day because nobody
[46:06] there had ears
[46:09] he was God who dwelt alone he wasn't
[46:11] even God yet he was the great Elohim the
[46:14] self-existent one and he was going to
[46:16] create something that could hear a voice
[46:18] but before then he spoke so what does it
[46:20] mean to speak it means uh uh he declared
[46:25] something or something from his thought
[46:27] was declared or manifested
[46:31] and that was the word
[46:35] so God was before the word now I know
[46:38] the word is eternal so don't think
[46:39] you're I'm saying something wrong I
[46:41] don't know how else to express this
[46:43] before there was an expression and you
[46:46] can't say before because we're back in
[46:47] eternity where there's no before and
[46:48] after
[46:50] so I we're so limited friends
[46:54] I don't even know how to preach about
[46:55] this stuff because all I have is words
[46:57] you know and words and back then they
[46:59] didn't even need words
[47:01] so now if there has a way there had to
[47:06] be a way for God to take what was inside
[47:08] of and what his thoughts were his
[47:09] attributes himself
[47:12] and express it and that expression is
[47:14] called word
[47:16] and the first it was expressed was in
[47:18] the form of logos a spiritual form of
[47:22] God and that was the word and all of the
[47:24] thoughts of God were in the logos
[47:27] and out of the logos everything was made
[47:29] it was I mean brother Bemus describes
[47:31] this in so many different ways but but
[47:33] I'm not going to go into that right now
[47:35] so but God is revealing himself through
[47:38] Christ
[47:39] so Christ is the word made manifest in
[47:43] the day
[47:44] so it says God's expecting himself
[47:46] through Christ you could almost look at
[47:48] this as two different entities we have
[47:50] gone then we have Christ it's really the
[47:53] same person it's God but it's God
[47:55] expressing himself because God really
[47:57] was before the expression
[48:01] does that make sense
[48:03] so then when we say Christ is the
[48:05] expression of God well what is Christ
[48:07] Christ is God but it's what God had
[48:10] invisible and unspoken and Unknown by
[48:13] anybody that is his attributes God
[48:15] himself Amen in order to express himself
[48:18] he was going to have to use a form
[48:20] called word and when that word would
[48:23] take on action and manifest itself it
[48:25] was going to call it Christ
[48:28] but what is it it's still him
[48:31] because it all goes back to his thought
[48:33] everything goes back to the thought of
[48:34] God so in everything that goes back to
[48:36] the thought of God is God
[48:39] because it's God's attributes which are
[48:41] his thoughts which is him that he's
[48:43] divided up and portioned over time it's
[48:45] still God we call it Christ we call it
[48:47] the word we call it the Holy Spirit we
[48:49] call it but it's still God
[48:51] but it's a way in which God can begin to
[48:54] express himself so that we would
[48:56] understand what was hidden inside of him
[48:58] now can be understood by portions of
[49:01] himself amen that could comprehend him
[49:05] so that he could have fellowship with
[49:07] himself
[49:10] I can't wait to get Beyond language and
[49:13] human intellect
[49:15] and experience the reality of what we're
[49:18] trying to express
[49:22] so we call it
[49:24] Christ
[49:26] but it's what was in God's mind
[49:29] being expressed
[49:31] moving into a manifestation and that is
[49:34] Christ and that's revealing God
[49:38] it's God revealing himself through
[49:40] Christ and Christ is the word
[49:42] and it takes the light of God to shine
[49:44] upon that word to vindicate it to prove
[49:47] that God still speaks life eternal life
[49:49] he speaks natural light brings life life
[49:52] only comes by the Light
[49:56] the word made manifest or made flesh
[50:00] that last sentence I want to lock in on
[50:03] for a minute life only comes by light
[50:08] the word made manifest or made flesh
[50:13] so what brings Life Light what is light
[50:16] light is illumination it's symbolic very
[50:19] symbolic in the Bible so God uses
[50:21] natural light to symbolize spiritual
[50:24] light
[50:25] and it takes light for life
[50:28] so the first thing that God would create
[50:29] in the days of creation would be light
[50:31] because light was going to bring forth
[50:33] life and no life would come forth
[50:34] without light and so the first thing
[50:36] that God did when he was the great
[50:39] Elohim the self-existent one by himself
[50:41] the first thing he did was Express
[50:43] himself his word and that word took on
[50:46] the form of light
[50:48] and from light there can be life
[50:52] without light there can be no life so we
[50:55] we were in this world trapped in
[50:57] darkness so what did God do God revealed
[51:00] his word to us which is light he turned
[51:03] on the light for us so that what was in
[51:05] us laying dormant could come to life
[51:08] and there is no life without the light
[51:10] and the light is the word made manifest
[51:13] or made flesh
[51:16] [Music]
[51:18] so let's take this back to Jesus Christ
[51:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:24] with in the beginning was the word
[51:26] Christ
[51:28] without him was not anything made
[51:31] in him was life and the life was the
[51:33] light of men
[51:35] without the word there was no lives
[51:37] there was there was other attributes of
[51:39] God were never going to take on another
[51:41] expression without the light and the
[51:43] light was going to Quicken them
[51:46] so life only comes by light the word
[51:48] made manifest or made flesh so if you
[51:50] think about uh think about Israel let's
[51:54] just take Israel for example they're
[51:56] down the nation of Israel as though it's
[51:59] dead it's in a grave called Egypt
[52:02] right they're supposed to be in the
[52:04] promised land they're supposed to have
[52:05] the inheritance and that whole portion
[52:07] is dead to them now
[52:09] because they're in a grave because even
[52:11] God refers to bringing them out of the
[52:13] graves when he brings them out of the
[52:14] Nations he brings them out of the graves
[52:15] because as a nation they're dead to the
[52:17] promise they're dead everything's dead
[52:19] they're in bondage and slavery I mean
[52:22] down in Egypt amen and what is going to
[52:24] bring them out there has to be a word
[52:26] made manifest that'll be light and that
[52:28] light will bring life to the nation of
[52:30] Israel and it will quick them from the
[52:32] Quicken them from the dead slave
[52:34] condition they're in in Egypt and it
[52:36] will bring them into newness of life and
[52:38] restore them back to what God's thought
[52:40] was for them from before the foundation
[52:42] of the world
[52:44] without Moses representing Christ and
[52:47] displaying that portion of Christ there
[52:49] would be no light the light in that day
[52:52] amen was the word for that day made
[52:55] flesh
[52:56] and it was made flesh in Moses
[52:59] so now we have a human being a human
[53:02] Veil Badger skins amen and the word is
[53:05] behind that it's God working through
[53:07] Moses and it's an expression of Christ
[53:09] which becomes light for that day which
[53:12] brings life to the word for that day
[53:17] so so life only comes by light the word
[53:20] may manifest or made flesh so we can say
[53:24] amen hallelujah that's nothing but the
[53:26] truth because they would have never
[53:28] resurrected out of Egypt without that
[53:30] portion of the word
[53:32] and tell Moses the prophet came until
[53:34] the Redeemer came amen until God worked
[53:37] through that vessel to to complete his
[53:40] word to perform the prophecy and bring
[53:42] them out they would have laid dead in
[53:44] Egypt as a nation but they were renewed
[53:46] to life quickening power came the light
[53:49] came and brought that Nation to life
[53:50] when when God come and worked Christ
[53:54] through Moses
[53:59] that's the truth
[54:02] but if it was a truth in that day he's
[54:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:05] and forever it's the very same thing
[54:07] today without the manifested word for
[54:10] the hour there is no life
[54:14] we want to have life everywhere else
[54:15] life here like no life only comes by
[54:18] light which is the manifested word for
[54:21] the day the word made flesh
[54:23] so where does the manifestation
[54:25] manifested word in this day because
[54:27] where you find that that's light and
[54:29] that light brings life
[54:32] and outside of that there's no life
[54:36] amen
[54:40] so there was one light
[54:42] there is not Methodist Baptist Lutheran
[54:44] Presbyterian Christ is the light and the
[54:47] light is life and the word manifested is
[54:51] the light of the hour
[54:55] do we believe it
[54:57] amen so where is life where there is
[55:01] light
[55:02] what is light the word manifested for
[55:04] the hour what is that that is Christ
[55:07] what is Christ doing revealing God
[55:11] amen
[55:15] oh praise God
[55:19] in Galatians 4 19 the Apostle Paul says
[55:22] my little children of whom I travail in
[55:24] birth again until Christ be formed in
[55:28] you
[55:30] now Paul the Apostle Paul is now the the
[55:33] prophet to the Gentiles he's the first
[55:35] church age messenger he's taking the
[55:37] message of grace to the Gentiles
[55:39] to fulfill all kinds of prophecies
[55:43] and as he's there he's telling them I'm
[55:45] laboring in the ministry
[55:48] I'm working under labor pains until
[55:51] Christ be formed in you
[55:56] so if what Paul is laboring for and what
[55:59] Paul is Desiring is accomplished what
[56:01] will be the end result of all of Paul's
[56:04] efforts the end result will be Christ in
[56:08] the church
[56:10] that's what he's laboring for that's
[56:13] what he's pushing for that's what he's
[56:15] ministering for he's laboring again in
[56:18] pain until Christ be formed in you
[56:22] so where where will Christ be in the
[56:25] church
[56:26] that's what Paul is trying to work
[56:29] towards
[56:33] in the in the message perfect Faith the
[56:35] prophet said Jesus had perfect Faith he
[56:37] had it and it came because he was the
[56:39] word and you become the word you become
[56:43] the word as you receive the word
[56:48] this is so good
[56:51] you you this is why you can't just say
[56:54] I'm the word I'm the word I'm the word
[56:55] no there must be a receiving of the word
[56:58] amen in that receiving of the word is
[57:00] you receiving light and that light
[57:02] bringing life to the word that's laying
[57:04] dormant inside of you and that light
[57:06] that light that word will come to life
[57:09] it'll be quickened and it will begin to
[57:11] live a life producing light
[57:14] that may bring somebody else to life
[57:18] but you become the word as you receive
[57:21] the word
[57:23] and so so there's so many times we make
[57:26] things so complicated I mean even in the
[57:30] in the way of receiving the baptism of
[57:32] the Holy Ghost we make it so complicated
[57:34] and brother Branham teaches it I mean
[57:36] there's two aspects to the baptism the
[57:38] Holy Ghost there's one as an experience
[57:40] there's a death he says there's a
[57:41] definite experience and what is the
[57:44] experience if you read all that he says
[57:45] he really can sum it up this way it's
[57:47] the experience of a changed life
[57:50] your soul change you change something
[57:52] and you changed you were going one way
[57:54] you went another way you changed
[57:57] and then he has the evidence of the
[57:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[58:01] evidence is you're able to receive all
[58:03] the word for your day
[58:04] not previous days future days but your
[58:06] day
[58:07] so you have an experience and an
[58:10] Evidence
[58:11] right
[58:12] so so
[58:15] the
[58:17] it's amazing how Jesus before he leaves
[58:19] his disciples we know there's a promise
[58:22] of the Holy Spirit coming but Jesus
[58:25] breathed on his disciples think about
[58:28] this breathed on his disciples and he
[58:31] told them receive ye the Holy Ghost
[58:36] so so what's he saying the breath
[58:40] of Christ the breath of Jesus Christ he
[58:43] breathed on them and told them to
[58:45] receive the Holy Ghost so there was
[58:47] something that was going to come from
[58:49] his mouth which is word and they are to
[58:51] receive the Breath of God which is the
[58:54] word of God
[58:57] that's why water baptism in the name of
[58:59] the Lord Jesus Christ is so critical
[59:01] because it's the word
[59:03] and you must be baptized correctly not
[59:06] in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[59:08] but under the right baptism which is the
[59:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:12] because with that brings the right
[59:14] revelation of who Christ is what if God
[59:16] is it's the right understanding of the
[59:18] godhead and with baptism in that name
[59:20] you have received the proper word for
[59:23] your day
[59:25] because it's contrary to all
[59:27] denominational teaching I mean the
[59:29] understanding of the godhead is contrary
[59:30] to all denominational teaching and
[59:33] you've received that word amen that has
[59:35] come from that prophet and receiving
[59:37] that word when you receive that word
[59:39] then now you're a candidate to re if you
[59:42] repent and receive the word now you're a
[59:45] candidate to receive the gift of the
[59:48] Holy Ghost
[59:51] so you become the word and the Holy
[59:54] Spirit in the word is the self-same
[59:56] thing that's what brother Brahm says the
[59:59] word has a life behind it has a life to
[1:00:01] it and the spirit is the life of the
[1:00:03] word amen and you become the word when
[1:00:06] you receive the word and I'm not talking
[1:00:08] about an intellectual consent or an
[1:00:10] intellectual agreeing but when something
[1:00:12] in you identifies that that's nothing
[1:00:14] but the truth then I tell you just
[1:00:16] receive the word and let God do the rest
[1:00:18] open yourself up to Christ and say God
[1:00:20] come in that word take complete
[1:00:23] preeminence in me
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:29] so you become the word
[1:00:33] as you receive the word
[1:00:36] keep receiving the word
[1:00:39] keep letting the spirit of God influence
[1:00:42] your life the spirit of the word
[1:00:45] bring changes
[1:00:48] it says
[1:00:49] in the token message says when you are
[1:00:51] subject
[1:00:53] then you are subject for the
[1:00:54] resurrection because the resurrection
[1:00:56] power is already in you
[1:00:58] the token is the resurrection power
[1:00:59] showing that Jesus raised up from the
[1:01:01] dead and you are raised from the dead
[1:01:03] the dead things of unbelief and have
[1:01:06] been made alive in the word of Jesus
[1:01:08] Christ you believe it and the word lives
[1:01:11] through you
[1:01:13] so you become the word as you receive
[1:01:15] the word and you believe it
[1:01:18] okay so now we understand what receiving
[1:01:20] is not just saying yes pretty good idea
[1:01:22] it's better than any other explanation I
[1:01:24] heard I'll agree with it no friend it's
[1:01:26] a genuine faith in the word of God you
[1:01:28] believe it and the word lives through
[1:01:31] you
[1:01:34] then in Christ is the mystery of God he
[1:01:35] says that's the second fold of his
[1:01:37] threefold manifestation first to express
[1:01:39] itself in Christ then Express himself
[1:01:42] through the church in the same thing
[1:01:44] Christ was the word and the church
[1:01:46] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:01:49] go through them
[1:01:52] okay
[1:01:54] so when the church becomes the word when
[1:01:58] it lets the word go through them
[1:02:01] I want to talk about this just for a
[1:02:03] moment I don't want to just read these
[1:02:05] statements and move on but what I want
[1:02:07] to absorb what the prophet is telling us
[1:02:08] and what does this mean
[1:02:11] so let's let's look at the Virgin Mary
[1:02:16] there was a prophecy laying in Isaiah 7
[1:02:19] 14 that a virgin shall conceive
[1:02:22] that was the word
[1:02:24] it was spoken by a prophet and that word
[1:02:27] would have a due season when it would
[1:02:29] come into manifestation
[1:02:31] all right so Christ is the word the
[1:02:35] anointed word made manifest for that age
[1:02:39] we got it so there was the word but that
[1:02:43] word must become the manifested word for
[1:02:45] that age
[1:02:47] so there was a specific age appointed
[1:02:49] for a virgin shall conceive Isaiah's
[1:02:51] prophecy to be fulfilled so somewhere in
[1:02:54] a vicinity of 700 years later amen Angel
[1:02:57] Gabriel shows up to speak to a virgin
[1:02:59] Amen in Nazareth and begins to tell her
[1:03:01] you're highly favored
[1:03:05] and she has no idea about any of this
[1:03:09] she I mean it wasn't like her parents
[1:03:12] were telling her you're going to be the
[1:03:13] virgin of Isaiah 7.
[1:03:16] I mean she had no clue she was just
[1:03:18] living life going to fetch water doing
[1:03:20] all she can making wedding preparations
[1:03:22] and all of the stuff that that she was
[1:03:24] doing as a teenage girl and and then the
[1:03:26] angel would come and tell her you don't
[1:03:29] know who you really are
[1:03:34] you've you've thought one thing you've
[1:03:36] been identified one way but I've come to
[1:03:38] bring you another identification you
[1:03:40] don't really know who you are but you
[1:03:43] really are the word that must be made
[1:03:46] manifest in this day
[1:03:49] and so now she she she is uh
[1:03:54] contemplating and questioning and she
[1:03:56] questions Angel how can these things be
[1:03:58] says I know not a man and she's looking
[1:04:00] scientifically and naturally he gives
[1:04:02] her a spiritual answer and a holy ghost
[1:04:04] shall ever shatter you overshadow thee
[1:04:06] and then and she you know she doesn't
[1:04:09] get a real clear answer
[1:04:12] but she got an answer that was good
[1:04:14] enough
[1:04:16] and then in verse 38 this is Luke
[1:04:18] chapter one she says be it unto me
[1:04:22] according to Thy Word
[1:04:25] you see the church becomes the word when
[1:04:28] it lets the word go through them
[1:04:32] Mary she was the predestinated word do
[1:04:36] we believe that I don't believe God I
[1:04:38] don't believe if she would have refused
[1:04:40] God would have picked Plan B
[1:04:42] I don't think God has plan B known unto
[1:04:45] God from the beginning of the world or
[1:04:46] all of his Works amen and we are
[1:04:48] ordained in Christ Jesus under good
[1:04:51] works God knows what we're going to do
[1:04:53] he has already pre-selected every vessel
[1:04:55] for its purpose amen so if she would
[1:04:58] have said no God's not going to pick
[1:04:59] another one she was ordained before the
[1:05:01] foundation of the world to be the
[1:05:03] Fulfillment of that thought of God that
[1:05:06] was expressed through a prophet that was
[1:05:08] written in the Bible and now there was a
[1:05:10] season that had to come manifest but it
[1:05:12] needed to move from predestinated word
[1:05:15] to manifested word and there was a key
[1:05:18] in between these two and the key was the
[1:05:21] woman herself saying be it unto me
[1:05:23] according to your word she had to
[1:05:25] believe it and then let it flow through
[1:05:27] her
[1:05:30] John the Baptist couldn't just come and
[1:05:33] say I believe I believe Malachi 3 that
[1:05:35] there's going to be somebody who's going
[1:05:37] to prepare the way and make straight the
[1:05:38] path of the Lord I believe that word
[1:05:41] well that was wonderful it's good to
[1:05:43] believe that it's not ever bad to
[1:05:44] believe that
[1:05:45] he couldn't have been saying you know I
[1:05:47] believe there's a voice of one crying in
[1:05:49] the wilderness I mean that that's also
[1:05:51] that's a wonderful thing
[1:05:53] but that wasn't what was needed in that
[1:05:55] day
[1:05:56] because for Generations people have
[1:05:58] believed that word was true
[1:06:00] and then it doesn't do any good also for
[1:06:02] John the Baptist to say you know what I
[1:06:05] think I'm that voice the one crying in
[1:06:06] the woods I think I'm the one to prepare
[1:06:08] the way of the Lord that's also
[1:06:10] wonderful but that still isn't Christ
[1:06:12] amen because Christ is the word made
[1:06:14] manifest John the Baptist had to
[1:06:16] actually take what he believed and allow
[1:06:18] that prophecy to flow through him and
[1:06:20] actually go out and prepare the way of
[1:06:22] the Lord he actually had to preach the
[1:06:24] gospel the coming of the Kingdom the
[1:06:26] coming of Messiah he had to baptize unto
[1:06:29] repentance he actually had to let the
[1:06:31] word flow through his flesh vessel
[1:06:34] agreeing with the word and letting and
[1:06:36] obeying the word and letting the word
[1:06:38] flow through him and when he did he
[1:06:40] became Christ in that day the manifested
[1:06:43] word of that day
[1:06:47] amen praise God
[1:06:50] so there's so many
[1:06:52] so many things like this in the Bible
[1:06:56] I mean Moses mother convinced him that
[1:06:59] he was the Redeemer born a proper child
[1:07:02] so he had the right understanding of the
[1:07:05] scripture
[1:07:06] but yet no manifestation
[1:07:10] he had he had been taught intellectually
[1:07:13] through a mother who had told him you
[1:07:15] were born a proper child you were born
[1:07:17] at the right time and we have a
[1:07:19] revelation you're the Redeemer you're
[1:07:22] the one that's going to bring us out and
[1:07:24] and he believed it and he tried to act
[1:07:26] upon it in his own accord amen and he
[1:07:28] failed miserably he goes into the
[1:07:30] Wilderness for 40 years and then God
[1:07:32] comes to approach him and call him back
[1:07:34] into his commission amen and then he
[1:07:36] begins to stumble around and say he
[1:07:39] can't do it and he's not able and and
[1:07:40] there's this whole dialogue with God and
[1:07:43] also God doesn't have a plan B here
[1:07:47] so God is in dialogue with money you say
[1:07:50] why didn't he strike him dead because he
[1:07:51] doesn't have a plan B Moses is the
[1:07:54] Fulfillment of the scripture he is
[1:07:57] carrying within him the predestinated
[1:07:59] word for That season but it must move
[1:08:01] from predestinated word to manifested
[1:08:04] word and God has got to get Moses to
[1:08:07] yield to the word and when Moses yields
[1:08:10] to the word it moves from predestinated
[1:08:13] word to manifested word
[1:08:16] and when it's manifested word it becomes
[1:08:18] light and that light becomes life and a
[1:08:21] whole nation is saved
[1:08:23] perfect so we realized that Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] is the anointed word made manifest in
[1:08:28] that day
[1:08:32] so we
[1:08:35] must be like the virgin
[1:08:38] like Moses like John the Baptist
[1:08:42] I believe amen I believe that God has
[1:08:45] called me for this hour amen I believe
[1:08:47] that I'm part on Eternal thought of God
[1:08:49] that he had of me I believe that I'm
[1:08:51] predestinated to be here in this hour
[1:08:53] and there's a prophecy laying in me a
[1:08:55] word to be fulfilled but nothing's going
[1:08:58] to happen until I and my own free choice
[1:09:00] my free moral agency lay down my life
[1:09:03] and surrender to the word that's been
[1:09:04] handed and I get baptized in his name I
[1:09:07] dress the way he said I talked the way
[1:09:09] he says I Surrender everything all my
[1:09:11] thoughts all my previous understanding
[1:09:13] of the Bible all my own wishes I lay it
[1:09:15] all down and I Surrender the word and
[1:09:17] become the manifested word by letting
[1:09:20] the word for the hour flow through me
[1:09:23] and that brings light and that brings
[1:09:26] life
[1:09:28] you can see what a hindrance it is to
[1:09:31] say I am to say that I'm the Bride of
[1:09:34] Jesus Christ but I want to cut my hair I
[1:09:36] want to wear jewelry I want to wear
[1:09:38] makeup I want to I want to join with
[1:09:40] systems I want to have my own way I
[1:09:42] still want to do a little side deal on
[1:09:44] the side I
[1:09:47] I think the brother Brandon was right in
[1:09:49] all these areas but
[1:09:52] you see what a hindrance it is
[1:09:55] because the predestinated word must be
[1:09:57] manifested word and we become the word
[1:10:00] when we let the word flow through us
[1:10:04] how do we let it flow through us being
[1:10:06] unto me
[1:10:08] according to your words
[1:10:10] if that's what you're calling for in
[1:10:12] this hour
[1:10:13] that's what you're going to have
[1:10:15] that's what I'm going to surrender to
[1:10:18] you I'm going to quit all my little
[1:10:20] deals I'm going to quit my associations
[1:10:22] I'm going to surrender my own thinking
[1:10:26] because the manifested word is the light
[1:10:30] of the hour
[1:10:33] so it becomes so important to know the
[1:10:36] day we live in
[1:10:37] in what the predestinated word is for
[1:10:39] this hour
[1:10:41] and then yield ourselves to become the
[1:10:43] manifested word in this hour
[1:10:46] because that will bring life in this
[1:10:48] hour
[1:10:52] modern events May clear by prophecy he
[1:10:55] says when he begins to reveal himself
[1:10:57] into the seed form again the same one
[1:11:00] that went in the ground come back to be
[1:11:02] the bride
[1:11:05] who's that one who went in the ground
[1:11:06] Jesus Christ
[1:11:07] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:10] so the one who went to the ground Jesus
[1:11:13] Christ come back to be the bride what
[1:11:16] did he come back for what was his return
[1:11:18] in this age he came back to be the bride
[1:11:23] all right so that's why we see there's
[1:11:25] such a misunderstanding on the coming of
[1:11:27] the Lord because this is the rapture
[1:11:29] coming where he comes to take his bride
[1:11:31] away in order to do that he first comes
[1:11:33] reveals himself to her unites with her
[1:11:35] each member and then he takes her away
[1:11:38] so this is the coming of the Lord for
[1:11:40] the Rapture not the coming of the Lord
[1:11:42] to the 144 000 and not the coming of the
[1:11:44] Lord to set up the millennial Kingdom
[1:11:46] but this is the rapture coming
[1:11:49] he's come to claim what's his he's come
[1:11:52] to take her to himself amen and to free
[1:11:55] her from all denomination and fear from
[1:11:57] all man's understanding so she's no
[1:11:59] longer manhandled and take her unto
[1:12:01] himself in an invisible Union
[1:12:04] and when he comes this time he's not
[1:12:07] going to come with nail scarred hands
[1:12:09] the prophet said we don't look for nails
[1:12:10] guard hands we look for the word made
[1:12:12] manifest because the word made manifest
[1:12:15] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:12:18] and forever the difference between this
[1:12:21] and the church ages through every Church
[1:12:23] age you had a portion
[1:12:25] yeah of the word
[1:12:27] just like Moses just like Abraham just
[1:12:30] like Dave
[1:12:31] but then when Jesus came it was the
[1:12:33] fullness of the word
[1:12:35] then through seven Church ages amen
[1:12:37] because they left the teachings of Paul
[1:12:39] they've had portions of the word and
[1:12:40] portions of the word and brother bear
[1:12:42] said a dip in the Holy Spirit
[1:12:45] is that right portion portion portion
[1:12:47] but when we get to the end of the church
[1:12:49] ages now the fullness is coming back
[1:12:52] again Christ the full word of God Amen
[1:12:57] is going to return to the body to his
[1:13:01] body
[1:13:02] what body the bride body
[1:13:06] and it's going to be Jesus Christ again
[1:13:08] remember what the prophet told us over
[1:13:10] and over again he said all that God was
[1:13:15] he poured into Christ
[1:13:18] amen all that Christ was
[1:13:22] he poured into the church
[1:13:24] when at the opening of the seals when
[1:13:27] the mighty angel came down when the
[1:13:29] headship came to unite with the body now
[1:13:32] it's not portioned that's why when you
[1:13:34] had portion of the word you had a dip in
[1:13:36] the spirit you had part of the spirit
[1:13:38] because the word and the spirit are the
[1:13:40] self same thing yes
[1:13:41] so now it's no longer dip in the spirit
[1:13:43] dip in the spirit partial life partial
[1:13:45] life partial life but now we've come
[1:13:47] where he himself the full word now can
[1:13:50] express himself through his body through
[1:13:53] the bride and it brings light and it
[1:13:55] brings life
[1:13:58] so
[1:14:00] when the same one that went in the
[1:14:03] ground
[1:14:04] come back to be the bride that's why
[1:14:06] they missed his coming
[1:14:09] that's why the world missed his coming
[1:14:11] because he came back to be the bride
[1:14:16] and when and and that's the prophecy and
[1:14:19] fulfillment of the word for this hour
[1:14:22] and we become the word when we let the
[1:14:24] word flow through us
[1:14:27] come back to be the bride just the bride
[1:14:30] and the groom is the same Flesh and
[1:14:33] Blood the same Ministry and the same
[1:14:36] things doing just exactly what he done
[1:14:38] the spirit
[1:14:40] and modern events made clear he says and
[1:14:43] so will the church come through
[1:14:44] justification sanctification baptism
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts now
[1:14:48] look how he inserts Restoration in the
[1:14:50] gifts because he's showing what looked
[1:14:52] like in the Pentecostal Revival was the
[1:14:54] long sought after promise of of the
[1:14:56] return of the full spirit of God it
[1:14:57] wasn't that it just looked like that it
[1:14:59] was the restoration of the gifts
[1:15:02] so after justification sanctification
[1:15:04] baptism Holy Spirit restoration and
[1:15:05] gifts right on into the formed image of
[1:15:09] Christ
[1:15:11] what is the formed image of Christ
[1:15:13] Christ in Bride form he's already been
[1:15:17] expressed in bridegroom form when he was
[1:15:19] here on Earth two thousand years ago but
[1:15:21] in this coming he's being expressed in
[1:15:24] the formed image of Christ which is
[1:15:26] Christ in Bride form
[1:15:29] in his bride body
[1:15:31] Christ is the bridegroom the church is
[1:15:33] the bride and the Bride is a part of the
[1:15:35] bridegroom
[1:15:36] it'll have to be a word church not a
[1:15:39] denominational Church it'll be the word
[1:15:41] church the word that's made known and by
[1:15:44] the Vindicated word of God
[1:15:46] she'll be the word for this day when she
[1:15:49] lets the word for this day flow through
[1:15:51] her
[1:15:54] praise be to God
[1:15:58] First Corinthians 12 27 says now
[1:16:01] ye are the body of Christ
[1:16:04] and members in particular man
[1:16:07] the body of Jesus Christ that was that
[1:16:10] was laid in the manger 2000 years ago
[1:16:13] that was the Lamb of God
[1:16:15] that was a created body of God with the
[1:16:17] creative blood of God that would pay the
[1:16:19] price of redemption for us all
[1:16:22] yes
[1:16:23] but that body was smitten and something
[1:16:26] was taken out of that body
[1:16:28] word and spirit to begin making another
[1:16:30] body just like Adam and the woman in the
[1:16:33] beginning
[1:16:35] and now God and and we've said this
[1:16:39] before but it's worth saying again
[1:16:41] when God laid Adam down and took a rib
[1:16:44] out of Adam's side and took the finished
[1:16:45] Spirit out of Adam and he formed woman
[1:16:47] now this woman what body did she have
[1:16:51] amen because God took a part of the body
[1:16:53] of Adam and made the body of the woman
[1:16:58] so he took a part of the body of Adam
[1:17:01] and made the body of the woman
[1:17:03] and he called their name Adam
[1:17:06] but what gave life to that woman was the
[1:17:09] spirit and that spirit that was in her
[1:17:11] was first in Adam
[1:17:13] is that right so God split Adam's Spirit
[1:17:16] between masculine and feminist took the
[1:17:17] feminist out and put it in there so now
[1:17:19] that's the body of Adam's spirit
[1:17:24] is that right
[1:17:25] making it Adam's Body
[1:17:29] that and the two were one
[1:17:33] so the same picture he lays down there
[1:17:35] is the same picture he wants us to
[1:17:37] understand there he says now ye are the
[1:17:40] body of Christ where is Christ where is
[1:17:43] Christ empty tomb and his body has went
[1:17:45] into heaven Hey listen Apostle Paul's
[1:17:47] saying now in this dispensation in this
[1:17:50] manifestation you are the body of Christ
[1:17:54] if you want to know where Christ is you
[1:17:56] find his body if you want to know where
[1:17:58] I am you must find my body because I can
[1:18:01] only dwell in this body in this
[1:18:02] dispensation in this period of time
[1:18:05] is that right so you want to find me you
[1:18:07] must find your body if you want to find
[1:18:09] Christ you should find his body
[1:18:12] ye are the body of Christ and members in
[1:18:15] particular that's why just like Moses
[1:18:17] could not claim he was all of Christ
[1:18:19] none of us can claim that we're the
[1:18:21] person of Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] amen we can but the body the bride body
[1:18:28] as a whole all that Christ well God was
[1:18:30] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:18:32] was he poured into the church amen and
[1:18:35] now they're bottling and confining
[1:18:37] Christ
[1:18:39] so individually we're only a little
[1:18:42] portion of this
[1:18:44] but through the whole body through seven
[1:18:46] Church ages it's Christ's body
[1:18:50] and now in the last time for this end
[1:18:52] time bride the full portion of the word
[1:18:55] amen which it brings the Full Life of
[1:18:57] Christ the full spirit of God has been
[1:19:00] poured into her and now she is the full
[1:19:02] reflection of Christ she is now the
[1:19:05] formed image of Jesus Christ
[1:19:09] because he doesn't have to repeat on
[1:19:12] this Earth the bridegroom form he did it
[1:19:15] now he's got to finish the Masterpiece
[1:19:18] that had got ruined back in Eden to
[1:19:20] finish that he must bring forth the
[1:19:22] bride for him now into completion unite
[1:19:25] the two is one then he can clean the
[1:19:27] Earth off amen and bring it back
[1:19:32] that's the portion of the word that
[1:19:34] we're to live out which is Christ amen
[1:19:37] dwelling in Bride form each of us have a
[1:19:40] portion but we must each yield ourselves
[1:19:43] to the portion for us to live so that
[1:19:45] Christ can be displayed in full measure
[1:19:48] through his bride globally
[1:19:52] not any one of us have it all we can't
[1:19:54] claim to have it all amen but but we but
[1:19:57] don't ever cut me out of it either I've
[1:19:59] got Christ Living in me I may not have
[1:20:01] all of Christ but whatever I the portion
[1:20:03] I've got amen is the portion that's
[1:20:05] allotted to me and it's the same Jesus
[1:20:08] Christ that's been around forever
[1:20:12] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:16] in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 29 for no
[1:20:19] man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:20:21] nourish and cherish it even as the Lord
[1:20:23] the church for we are members of his
[1:20:25] body of his flesh and of his bones
[1:20:30] huh
[1:20:32] I don't think I don't think Paul can
[1:20:34] make it any clearer
[1:20:37] somehow it's been missed the full scope
[1:20:40] the full plan the the full reality of
[1:20:43] this has been missed for generations for
[1:20:45] two thousand years but in the end time
[1:20:47] God has wanted to bring us back to this
[1:20:49] reality this is what was supposed to
[1:20:51] happen after Christ gave his life for
[1:20:53] his bride God smote him in the side to
[1:20:56] take out of him the elements to make his
[1:20:58] bride which was the smitten word and the
[1:21:01] life
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] and he was going to bring amen that word
[1:21:06] to them amen and bring that life back to
[1:21:08] them at Pentecost and bring the word to
[1:21:10] them but they fell from the word amen
[1:21:13] and they handicapped are they chained or
[1:21:15] they blocked off the full measure of the
[1:21:17] word
[1:21:19] which blocked off the full measure
[1:21:21] Liberty of the spirit
[1:21:24] right
[1:21:25] that's what the prophet of God said the
[1:21:27] Holy Spirit now has been bound in these
[1:21:28] denominational Rivers for nearly 2 000
[1:21:30] years but will be loosed
[1:21:33] was bound but he's not bound anymore
[1:21:35] we'll be loosed in the evening time by
[1:21:37] the evening time message the Holy Ghost
[1:21:40] back in the church again
[1:21:44] so what is she being formed into the
[1:21:47] formed image
[1:21:49] of Christ
[1:21:51] the body coming back to this word and
[1:21:54] this purpose when Paul laid it down
[1:21:57] now is being fulfilled in our day
[1:22:01] but we become this word when we let this
[1:22:04] word flow through us
[1:22:06] when we say be it unto me with all the
[1:22:09] consequences
[1:22:11] with all the rejection
[1:22:13] with all the changing my own plans
[1:22:17] when Mary said being unto me according
[1:22:19] to your word she didn't know if Joseph
[1:22:20] would still accept her
[1:22:22] she didn't know if her parents would
[1:22:24] kick her out of her house she didn't
[1:22:25] know what the consequences would be she
[1:22:27] didn't know what the priesthood would do
[1:22:28] she didn't know what her Nation would do
[1:22:30] she had no idea what her future life
[1:22:31] would be but something in her could
[1:22:33] identify with what that angel messenger
[1:22:35] was saying and she something from within
[1:22:38] not from her intellect because her
[1:22:40] intellect would have boggled her up amen
[1:22:42] just like you're in mine intellect will
[1:22:43] Boggle us up and have us thinking we
[1:22:45] can't be it's not possible I don't live
[1:22:47] the right kind of Life I'll never be
[1:22:49] good enough but you got to go deeper
[1:22:51] than that to something that says I know
[1:22:53] that's the truth I know it's right
[1:22:55] whatever that angel said that
[1:22:56] identification is who I really am and be
[1:22:59] it unto me according to your word
[1:23:02] let's go to uh the Luke chapter one
[1:23:05] together
[1:23:07] I just want to look at this
[1:23:12] Luke chapter one and we'll start at
[1:23:14] verse 38 with the
[1:23:16] verse that I just quoted and then I'm
[1:23:18] going to move to another one
[1:23:23] and Mary said behold the hand man of the
[1:23:25] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:23:27] and the angel departed from her now we
[1:23:29] know she left and she went to visit
[1:23:31] Elizabeth Elizabeth was carrying John
[1:23:33] the Baptist at this time and when she
[1:23:34] comes and gives a salutation gives a
[1:23:36] greeting amen Elizabeth is now filled
[1:23:38] with the Holy Ghost and begins to
[1:23:39] prophesy but I want to go to verse 45
[1:23:41] this is the tail end of what she says
[1:23:44] said and blessed is she that believed
[1:23:50] this is the key to the whole Bible
[1:23:54] it has all been based on faith it has
[1:23:56] always been based on faith
[1:23:59] and blessed is she that believed
[1:24:02] for that little word four
[1:24:04] means because
[1:24:09] blessed is she that believe for there
[1:24:11] shall be perform a performance of those
[1:24:14] things which were told her from the Lord
[1:24:18] God could tell her her position
[1:24:21] God could send an angel to tell her who
[1:24:23] she is and the prophecy that she's
[1:24:24] coming under the scripture that she used
[1:24:26] to fulfill but she has to believe it
[1:24:30] in order for it to be performed she has
[1:24:33] to believe it and she has to surrender
[1:24:36] to it
[1:24:37] and in this day for Christ to be to for
[1:24:40] the bride the body the church the the be
[1:24:43] the formed image of Christ she has to
[1:24:45] hear from an angel messenger her
[1:24:47] identification and the prophecy for the
[1:24:49] day she must identify herself with it
[1:24:52] she must surrender to it yield to it uh
[1:24:55] acknowledge it believe it all of those
[1:24:58] things and then let it flow through her
[1:25:02] you have to believe it
[1:25:04] if we're still riddled with doubts we're
[1:25:07] not there yet
[1:25:08] and I'm I'm not talking about the doubts
[1:25:10] that always come you make a mistake
[1:25:12] that's just the devil troubling your
[1:25:14] mind
[1:25:16] but if you've never had that experience
[1:25:18] of of Christ personally revealing your
[1:25:20] position to you that you know you're
[1:25:22] part of this end time message maybe
[1:25:24] despite all the obstacles in your life
[1:25:27] despite all the the hindrances that are
[1:25:29] around or the mistakes but something
[1:25:31] inside has come alive and said it's me
[1:25:34] I looked in that mirror and said it's me
[1:25:36] mama
[1:25:37] it's me I'm the one they're talking
[1:25:39] about
[1:25:41] and you believe it and then surrender to
[1:25:43] it
[1:25:45] and become the word by letting the word
[1:25:47] flow
[1:25:49] just a couple more
[1:25:53] no no notice
[1:25:56] we then we become part of him as you are
[1:25:59] the veil that veils him you are part of
[1:26:01] him as long as Christ is in you as
[1:26:03] Christ was of God because God was in him
[1:26:05] made him God
[1:26:07] it's a mouthful
[1:26:10] but it works both ways
[1:26:12] and as Christ is in you the hope of
[1:26:14] glory you become part of Christ he that
[1:26:17] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:26:18] shall he also see you become part of
[1:26:20] Christ as long as Christ is hidden you
[1:26:24] then it's veiled to the unbeliever but
[1:26:26] you know he's in you you are templing
[1:26:28] Christ that's behind the veil the skin
[1:26:32] behind because of the Veil The Veil
[1:26:34] again in human flesh hides God the word
[1:26:37] from the unbeliever
[1:26:40] so where is the word
[1:26:44] it's hidden in plain sight
[1:26:47] what is a manifestation for this hour
[1:26:49] hidden in plain sight
[1:26:51] just as much as John the baddest was
[1:26:53] hidden in plain sight Jesus Christ was
[1:26:55] hidden in plain sight the Virgin Mary
[1:26:57] was hidden in plain sight
[1:26:59] but it was this flesh Veil that hid them
[1:27:01] from the eyes of the people but it was
[1:27:03] there for anybody who could believe
[1:27:06] same thing's true today
[1:27:10] the choosing of a bride he says the
[1:27:11] other is pregnated by the word of God
[1:27:13] and will bring forth the body
[1:27:15] the finished body of Jesus Christ which
[1:27:18] is the bride the body of Christ isn't
[1:27:20] finished yet how many knows that a man
[1:27:23] and a woman is one and Christ is one
[1:27:24] body the word the bride will have to be
[1:27:27] the rest of that body
[1:27:29] and the two together makes the one body
[1:27:32] again
[1:27:34] like Adam was at the beginning man his
[1:27:36] wife are one are we getting it now amen
[1:27:39] is it sinking in deeper is it striking
[1:27:42] something way down on the inside and you
[1:27:44] can recognize that is me that's my
[1:27:47] scripture that's my portion that's why
[1:27:49] I'm here that's what I'm here for I'm
[1:27:51] not here to live my own life I am here
[1:27:53] to surrender to him in every Avenue of
[1:27:56] my life so that the word will be
[1:27:57] expressed in my conduct my conversation
[1:28:00] my workplace my family as a mother as a
[1:28:02] grandmother as a grandfather as a dad as
[1:28:05] a co-worker as a whatever I'm here for
[1:28:09] Christ to display himself in me
[1:28:12] that is my whole portion that's what I'm
[1:28:15] here to do
[1:28:16] and that way nobody has an excuse nobody
[1:28:18] can pass this off to the ministry nobody
[1:28:20] can pass this off to gifted people it is
[1:28:23] the full body of Jesus Christ fingers
[1:28:25] toes uh wrinkles hairs everything it's
[1:28:28] the full body giving a full expression
[1:28:30] ye are the body of Christ and members in
[1:28:33] particular and every member must be
[1:28:35] yielded to this Revelation and allowing
[1:28:37] the word to flow through them
[1:28:41] we don't pass it off to a select few no
[1:28:43] it's me Lord I'm the one you want to
[1:28:46] live through I'm the one you want to
[1:28:48] express yourself through
[1:28:51] and stop thinking great big things
[1:28:55] because if you start doing that you'll
[1:28:57] be waiting all your life for the time
[1:28:59] that you can raise the Dead
[1:29:03] you'll be waiting all your time where
[1:29:05] you can manifest a spoken word and you
[1:29:07] won't realize that it's every day he
[1:29:10] wants to express the word through you
[1:29:11] and the way you dress yourself the style
[1:29:14] you put on the the fashion either you
[1:29:16] reject or take on Amen the the way you
[1:29:18] have conversations the way you share the
[1:29:20] word the way you conduct your family the
[1:29:22] way you treat one another what is that
[1:29:24] it's the word flowing through you
[1:29:29] and we don't recognize it's the
[1:29:31] simplicity
[1:29:33] of Christ in you
[1:29:35] at work at home alone with your children
[1:29:39] with your family
[1:29:41] it's Christ in you
[1:29:45] and the two together makes the one body
[1:29:48] again
[1:29:50] the message it is the rising the sun he
[1:29:52] said you believe that we shall rise in
[1:29:53] him we become part of him
[1:29:56] the Easter the revealed Secret Of God
[1:29:58] like it was then of life after death
[1:30:01] he's talking about the first Easter
[1:30:03] Jesus coming out of the grave but he's
[1:30:04] taking it right to this day and brother
[1:30:06] banham if you can receive it we'll take
[1:30:08] it right to you in your seat right now
[1:30:12] the revealed Secret Of God like it was
[1:30:14] then of life after death
[1:30:16] we are now alive who were once dead in
[1:30:19] sin and trespassing oh what life is he
[1:30:22] talking about now the manifested word
[1:30:24] for this day brought life that light
[1:30:26] brought life to this scene
[1:30:29] and I have had my Easter experience I've
[1:30:32] come out of the Grave behind the big
[1:30:34] rock of false Revelation amen it's been
[1:30:36] rolled away and I by the Light of the
[1:30:39] manifested word for the day have come to
[1:30:41] life I have had my Easter in this
[1:30:44] message
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:47] praise God
[1:30:48] the the true Easter seal has broken
[1:30:52] death from around me
[1:30:53] amen and I'm alive
[1:30:56] what did Brother Bear I'm talking about
[1:30:57] he's talking about his own life
[1:30:59] let's bring it home to our own lives
[1:31:02] said the Easter seal at the beginning
[1:31:04] broke the Seal of the Roman seal now
[1:31:07] he's going right back to the Jesus
[1:31:09] Christ being be in the Tomb the stone
[1:31:11] rolled over a big Roman seal to fix to
[1:31:13] it but the Easter seal broke the Roman
[1:31:15] seal
[1:31:16] and the Roman seal was was man's ideas
[1:31:19] and denominationalism in our day and the
[1:31:22] Easter seal has broke that seal for you
[1:31:25] and I
[1:31:29] they're Easter seal at the beginning
[1:31:30] broke the Seal of the Roman seal the
[1:31:32] Easter seal that he was sealed up and
[1:31:34] man when they died was gone but he broke
[1:31:37] the seal and revealed the secret
[1:31:40] amen and now gone by his holy spirit has
[1:31:43] broke the seal from around our lives and
[1:31:46] Christ is revealed as he lives in US
[1:31:49] for now we are quickened with him
[1:31:52] has the word brought you to life has the
[1:31:56] light of the hour woke you up and
[1:31:57] brought you to life amen and you've had
[1:32:00] your Easter amen now let the light shine
[1:32:02] through you to bring somebody else into
[1:32:04] Easter
[1:32:07] in Romans Apostle Paul says so then they
[1:32:10] that are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:32:14] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:32:16] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:32:17] dwell in you
[1:32:18] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:32:20] Christ he is none of his and if Christ
[1:32:23] be in you the body is dead because of
[1:32:25] sin but the spirit is life because of
[1:32:27] righteousness
[1:32:28] so I want to follow this closely
[1:32:33] if Christ be in you
[1:32:35] means you receive the spirit of God
[1:32:38] the body is dead your body is dead
[1:32:42] but you didn't fall over dead
[1:32:45] you died to self
[1:32:48] you died to the desires of the outer man
[1:32:52] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:32:55] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:32:58] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:33:00] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:33:02] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:33:04] also Quicken your mortal bodies by a
[1:33:06] spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:33:10] what's he saying
[1:33:12] what the Apostle Paul is saying he's not
[1:33:14] talking about a future Resurrection
[1:33:16] although that applies
[1:33:18] what he's showing is you were dead in
[1:33:21] sin and trespasses your body is dead
[1:33:23] because of hybridization
[1:33:25] you come to this world dead amen making
[1:33:28] choices of the Dead loving the things of
[1:33:32] the Dead
[1:33:33] right is dead in the Sin but you're
[1:33:36] alive
[1:33:38] your spirit is life because of
[1:33:40] righteousness because God has come in
[1:33:43] now you're alive so now with the same
[1:33:46] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:33:48] dead dwell in you that's what made you
[1:33:50] alive it now will Quicken your mortal
[1:33:53] body and bring this body into the life
[1:33:56] of the word and make this body live the
[1:33:59] word
[1:34:00] so why so that you can let the word flow
[1:34:03] through you so that you can become the
[1:34:05] manifested word in a hybrid body in a
[1:34:08] fallen body you can become the
[1:34:10] manifested word if the spirit that
[1:34:12] raised up Jesus from the dead it shall
[1:34:14] also Quicken your mortal body and bring
[1:34:16] it to life of the word
[1:34:20] amen will it also Quicken your mortal
[1:34:22] body if you die absolutely
[1:34:24] but it needs to be quick and now to be
[1:34:26] brought subject to the word
[1:34:32] and the message it is the rising of the
[1:34:34] sign he said the sun has got to be
[1:34:36] revealed again
[1:34:38] in the bride in the last day
[1:34:42] you believe the son which is Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ is the son Jesus Christ
[1:34:46] so the sun has got to be revealed again
[1:34:49] in the bride in this last day
[1:34:52] the quickening powers got to come
[1:34:54] Quicken them out of these dead
[1:34:56] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[1:34:58] Word of the Living God
[1:35:01] and things that are to be he says now if
[1:35:05] we are those attributes of God we cannot
[1:35:07] live by Creeds we cannot live by the
[1:35:09] nominationalism we must live by the word
[1:35:11] why if the word flows through you you
[1:35:13] the word for the day it has to be the
[1:35:15] word
[1:35:16] not our ideas or somebody else's ideas
[1:35:18] or our own concept it's got to be the
[1:35:20] word
[1:35:22] we must live by the word because the
[1:35:24] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[1:35:25] wife is part of her husband therefore we
[1:35:28] must be that word bride and what is that
[1:35:31] word bride
[1:35:33] the manifestation of this hour
[1:35:36] and the manifestation of the word for
[1:35:37] this hour is Jesus Christ the same
[1:35:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:35:43] it is Christ it's Christ in Bride form
[1:35:47] it's Jesus Christ in the formation of
[1:35:49] the Bride it's the son that's got to be
[1:35:51] revealed in the bride is him who's come
[1:35:53] back to be the bride
[1:35:55] how many other ways do we need to say
[1:35:58] you
[1:36:00] this whole message is you
[1:36:03] it's you
[1:36:04] it's you and me
[1:36:06] that's the body he wants to live in
[1:36:08] that's the body that has to express the
[1:36:10] full measure of Jesus Christ in this day
[1:36:15] it's the predestinated word
[1:36:18] that must in this hour become the
[1:36:20] manifested way
[1:36:22] and it will do it when we surrender when
[1:36:24] we believe the word and surrender to the
[1:36:27] word and let it flow through us
[1:36:30] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:36:32] of this hour the bride not a Creed or
[1:36:35] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[1:36:37] a living attribute of God displaying to
[1:36:40] the world the attributes of God in the
[1:36:43] formation of the Bride that's to be
[1:36:44] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:36:47] living
[1:36:49] Jesus Christ
[1:36:50] the same yesterday today
[1:36:53] and forever
[1:36:57] his body
[1:36:59] the finished part of his body
[1:37:04] expressing the full measure of Christ
[1:37:07] as a bride
[1:37:09] that's the hour we live in
[1:37:11] that's the calling we've been called to
[1:37:13] that's the thing we must believe
[1:37:16] and surrender to you
[1:37:19] that's why this goes so far beyond
[1:37:21] church membership
[1:37:24] Church attendance group thinking
[1:37:27] you can see why that's never going to
[1:37:29] work in this hour
[1:37:31] being part of the group will never
[1:37:32] accomplish this
[1:37:34] going along with others will never
[1:37:36] accomplish this
[1:37:37] mental agreement will never accomplish
[1:37:39] as being educatedness that will never
[1:37:41] accomplish this in order for Christ to
[1:37:44] be manifest in the bride every member of
[1:37:47] that body must be yielded and he must be
[1:37:49] in control
[1:37:51] and then as she surrenders he begins to
[1:37:55] live his word through her and manifest
[1:37:57] himself
[1:37:59] in his body the completion of his body
[1:38:03] where did the mighty Angel go
[1:38:07] that that angel that spirit that angel
[1:38:11] of the Covenant
[1:38:12] Christ
[1:38:14] he came to unite with his body
[1:38:17] the head came to the body
[1:38:21] to do what to manifest himself again
[1:38:26] I want to read this one last scripture
[1:38:28] let's all stand together we'll read it
[1:38:30] together
[1:38:31] the musicians could come and brother Ben
[1:38:33] if you'll come
[1:38:35] Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 whereof I
[1:38:38] am made a minister according to the
[1:38:40] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:38:42] for you to fulfill the word of God even
[1:38:45] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[1:38:47] and from Generations but now is made
[1:38:49] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[1:38:52] make known what is the riches of the
[1:38:53] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:38:56] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:39:02] the whole plan
[1:39:04] is waiting on this bride to come to
[1:39:08] perfection
[1:39:09] to recognize who she is
[1:39:12] as an angel has identified her
[1:39:15] and for her
[1:39:17] to forget about all the intellectual
[1:39:19] understanding
[1:39:20] how shall this be I know not a man how
[1:39:22] can this be and how will that happen
[1:39:25] but just to surrender and say be it unto
[1:39:28] me I believe it be it unto me I believe
[1:39:33] it and now I'm surrendered to it you can
[1:39:35] have this vessel to finish your work
[1:39:40] the bride can only be the body of Christ
[1:39:43] if she is yielded to the word
[1:39:46] how can this be the the finishing
[1:39:48] completion of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:39:51] if the that portion that member of the
[1:39:53] body is constantly defying his word
[1:39:57] he is the word
[1:39:59] she must also be the word to be the
[1:40:02] completion of his body in order to be
[1:40:04] the word she must receive the word she
[1:40:07] must believe the word and she must let
[1:40:09] the word flow through her
[1:40:11] nothing less will work
[1:40:16] we're through the we're beyond the time
[1:40:18] of playing
[1:40:20] this is reality
[1:40:22] say God make it a reality in me
[1:40:25] I mean let's bow our heads and think
[1:40:27] going
[1:40:29] dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[1:40:31] word
[1:40:32] for God there's no way
[1:40:34] that we could have ever identified
[1:40:36] ourselves
[1:40:38] we could have opened a Bible and read
[1:40:40] from cover to cover and we could have
[1:40:42] never identified where we were who we
[1:40:45] were
[1:40:46] but God you sent an angel in this
[1:40:48] dispensation of time
[1:40:50] at the very end of the church ages you
[1:40:53] send an angel Messenger to identify your
[1:40:56] little bride
[1:40:57] to call her bride
[1:40:59] to change her from church to bride
[1:41:03] so that she will understand what it is
[1:41:05] you're trying to tell her
[1:41:07] God I pray that you would help us Lord
[1:41:09] to have eyes to see and ears to hear
[1:41:12] God make this a living reality inside of
[1:41:15] us
[1:41:16] God we believe we're here because we
[1:41:19] believe God we surrender because we
[1:41:21] believe Lord help us to surrender more
[1:41:24] God made you accomplish through this
[1:41:26] body what you intended to accomplish
[1:41:28] your bride body that's on Earth at the
[1:41:30] end time may she be fully surrendered to
[1:41:33] you
[1:41:34] and may each one of us Lord be genuine
[1:41:37] and real Lord help us God to be sincere
[1:41:40] and consecrated and dedicated for each
[1:41:43] member must be fully committed Lord help
[1:41:46] me not to hinder any other part of your
[1:41:48] body help me not to hinder your work but
[1:41:51] help me to believe and to surrender
[1:41:54] God I love you and I thank you Father
[1:41:56] for what you're doing we could have
[1:41:58] never done this for ourselves we could
[1:41:59] have never identified ourselves we could
[1:42:02] have never properly identified the hour
[1:42:03] we're living in to even look for the
[1:42:05] right manifestation
[1:42:07] but God you came and you demonstrated it
[1:42:09] you Vindicated it you showed it to us so
[1:42:12] we would know the very hour that we're
[1:42:14] in the very dispensation of time and the
[1:42:17] portion of the word that you want to
[1:42:18] fulfill you've identified it and we
[1:42:21] believe it
[1:42:22] now Lord help us to move from the
[1:42:24] predestinated word
[1:42:25] into the manifested word
[1:42:28] each one of us as individuals personally
[1:42:30] for me God I'm asking that you would
[1:42:32] help me to move from the predestinated
[1:42:35] word because I believe I'm that I
[1:42:37] believe it Lord by faith I've received
[1:42:39] that Revelation but help me to
[1:42:41] completely move from predestinated word
[1:42:43] to a complete manifested word whatever
[1:42:46] you wanted to manifest before the
[1:42:49] foundation of the world through this
[1:42:50] Tabernacle I want to yield completely to
[1:42:53] that to become that manifested thought
[1:42:55] it's expressed in this day
[1:42:59] and I know Lord that'll be Christ
[1:43:01] expressed to the world

[1:43:06] now Lord amongst us as we yield
[1:43:08] ourselves to you

[1:43:12] work that you've set for this day and
[1:43:15] hour

[1:43:24] us to come up with ideas or plans you
