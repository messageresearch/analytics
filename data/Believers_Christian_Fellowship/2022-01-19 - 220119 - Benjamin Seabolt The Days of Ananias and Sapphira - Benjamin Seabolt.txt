sheep lord you must do that we just commit ourselves to you lord both speaker and here for the glory of god in jesus christ's name amen god bless you this evening so good to be with you i do bring you greetings from our pastor he said to make sure that you all knew that he has not abandoned us he will return said they're doing fine nobody else has got sick or anything like that sister angie is doing fine doing well and fully anticipate to be here sunday so we will all be happy for that if you have your bibles let's turn to acts chapter 5 and we'll begin reading here in acts chapter 5. i take a topic tonight something i've been thinking on for a little while now but um i just want to take a topic here of the days of ananias and sapphira and you know brother branham spoke about them and uh we'll get to that here in just a little bit but there's a there's something surrounding this event and these two people that i want to tap into so let's do that here in acts chapter 5. so just prior to this for a context this is when the the early church went sold everything that they had and were giving it to the apostles to divvy out almost what we would consider common living and this is the context that this is taking in chapter 5 verse 1 it says but a certain man named ananias with safari his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price and his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the disciples feet god bless you as you would have your seats we'll continue reading but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thy own power why hast thou conceived this thing and thine heart thou hast not lied to men but unto god that is quite a statement because ananias is talking to peter and ananias was physically vocalizing words and they were being received into peter's ears so he was speaking to a man but peter says you've not lied to men you have lied to god and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young man arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and peter answered unto her tell me whether you sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carried her for carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear came upon the church and upon as many as heard these things and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people right amongst the people and they were all with one accord in solomon's porch and of the rest durst no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that the that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the city's roundabout unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone so i think after we read this passage i think it is safe to say that this group here was not playing church there was consequences that were being immediately dealt out for somebody lying to the holy spirit but it's very easy to take this topic and preach this in a condescending way or a condemnation type of way and i want to get that out first this is not that type of message this is that's not what i have on my heart of you're going to die and go to hell if you don't try harder if you don't do better that's that's not what i'm after here that's that's not the point here i just want to pick up something out of this to see what we have a chance at as a people because what had happened here what had transpired is ananias and sapphire had came before peter and god had moved through peter to see the motive and objective of ananias and sapphira's art that can be very detrimental if you haven't given all of your heart but if you have given all of your heart why should that scare us why should it scare us for the holy ghost to be able to discern the motives and intents of our hearts what a privileged people we are to live in a day that the full word has come and with the fullness of the word is the capability to reveal the fullness of the heart there is no other age that stood in a position that we have stood in there's no other age that's had an opportunity to be the kind of people that we have an opportunity to be so this is not a message of if you have sin in your life you're going to fall over in church tonight this is not that type of message is the possibilities there yes the possibilities are there because god's a living god god's a real god god doesn't play church but the days of trying to pound people through legalizing methods into the image of the stature of a perfect man are gone we have that understanding this is not something that a legalistic approach is going to produce this is going to be something that the fullness of the word exposing the fullness of your heart is going to produce and that's the only possible way so there's nothing that i can say here tonight to you know try should we try harder yes we should try harder i think we should we can all raise our hands and say yes we should try harder should we do better yes we should do better i believe that but i don't believe in my heart of hearts that there's anybody setting here tonight that's willfully setting here with something sinful hiding in their heart that they do not want exposed are we making mistakes sure is there things in our lives that we're doing wrong no doubt but what is our desire what is our intent what is our motive what is our objective and that saints we have to realize is a privileged position to be in of all the billions of people on the face of this earth you find me what percentage has the desire and has a clear heart and a motive and objective before god to search me to try me see if there is anything unlike you that is not a human desire that is not even a religious desire that desire can only come from the spirit of almighty god and now not only do you have that desire but now there has come a word the person of the word himself in this day in this age to produce an opportunity that no other age is produced to not only have that desire but to be able to produce that in hybrid flesh that is astounding i think we should never take that for granted i think we should never underestimate what position and opportunity that we have but this was a position that ananias and sapphira had conspired together to deceive the church and if you look at it peter breaks this down so simply he just asked him what are you doing why would you do this you had something that was rightfully yours and there was nobody trying to make you even give that up there was no pressure to give that up this was something that was yours and we were all happy that it was yours there was no problems here but what they had done was they had taken something and in this case it was a house or a land and they were trying to exalt themselves up as brother branham says they were trying to jump higher than they lived they were trying to make themselves look more holy than what they really were they were trying in themselves to make themselves look more spiritual than what they actually were because there was nothing wrong with the position that they were in there was no decree from christ or the apostles that they'll have to go and sell everything that you have and give to the church this was something that the early church they just did as the spirit moved them this is something that god would lay it upon their heart and they didn't want to uh to have you know if you want to say echelons within the church so they just went and they sold these things and they would give it to the church for the common good of everybody but there was no pressure to do that this was a free will giving but ananias and sapphira they would put themselves in a situation to where they wanted they wanted the reputation that came with with somebody giving all they wanted to be in that group of spiritual people that had truly given all even down to their physical possessions there was a group of people literally doing that and they wanted to to be identified with that so they would come and they would say we have given all as well knowing full well that they had that was the sin the sin was not that they sold the land or didn't sell the land or the price that it was sold for and how much they gave none of that was the issue there would have been no issue if they would have sold the land for 200 and came before peter and said we sold it for 200 but we needed 150 to go buy whatever here's 50 of it praise god there's no problem the problem was they were trying to confess something other than what was that what they were really living in their hearts they were trying to confess that i have forsaken all and given it to christ when they really hadn't that was the problem that was the root problem peter says while it remained was it not your own your life is your life saints your body is your body it's been purchased by the blood of jesus christ but your life is your life you can do as you please you're on free moral agency jesus christ is not going to come down and force you to give him anything and there is nothing understand what i say when i say this but there is nothing wrong or i would say sinful in simply admitting the fact that this is the word and the standard and i can clearly see that and i am not living up to that but by his grace i want to but that's totally different when your profession and your confession is i've been buried in the name of the lord jesus christ in water baptism and i have given him my entire life his spirit is indwelling me and you knowingly continue to do things that the word is against that the nature of the word of against and this understand this is not shell shocking i think we would all agree with that this is not deep and mysterious this is just common common understanding but this is what affected the early church almost immediately after pentecost is there was still this make believer in that group but your life is your life he christ is not going to come and force you to do anything now if you're his seed he's going to make circumstances arise that will be beneficial to him and not beneficial to you hiding any part of your heart i think most of us have been there and experienced that but he is not going to come and force you to do anything because your own free moral agency and while you're in that state as peter says is it not your own is your thoughts not your own is your decisions not your own is your way not your own if you're going in your way and you're admitting this is my way this is what i want to do there is no sin lying in that i would say it this way there is there is no false confession laying in that but when you take on the name of the lord jesus christ in water baptism and you and you receive his holy spirit and you are declaring that the spirit of god the spirit of christ is indwelling me you can no longer move forward in your own desires without doing the same thing that ananias and sapphira did do we all agree with that while it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart why hast thou thou hast not lied unto men but unto god the same thing stands true tonight if you are in a cond if a person is in that type of condition the issue is not that they're false confessing something to me or you that's not the issue i have zero power to remedy that unless god would supernaturally reveal something to be called out i have zero power to do anything about that there is no issue with lying to me as a person but there is an issue with lying to the spirit of christ that is within the believers and there is an issue with linking yourself into that group as ananias and sapphira were doing falsely as one who has given all when they really haven't that's where the issue lays but i want to read what brother branham had to say about this in 1965 communion the very last message that he preached and this is where you want to say my thought or inspiration came from was out of this quote he says speaking of the communion except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you see that's what the bible said except you do it there's no life you are then more or less showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a christian because of the life that you live and then this is really the showdown then if you don't do it you have no life if you do it onward then unworthily you are guilty of the body of the lord same thing in water baptism if we say we believe on jesus christ he saved us from sin and we are baptized in the name of jesus christ we bring disgrace to him we do the things that's wrong and we'll have to pay for that now remember where he's placing this this is after you have declared the name of the lord jesus christ in your life he says to knowingly go against that and to go against that word and to do things that are contrary to that we will have to pay for that and another thing when we do that we are trying to profess one thing and do another that's the trouble of us today we believe that god has given us a message it's been ordained of god it's been proven of god it's been shown of god now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with purity of heart and mind and soul you know the hour will soon arise when right among us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira remember see that hour is coming now you just remember that see that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now so brother branham in the last message that he that he preaches publicly is telling these people in this communion message it's not optional you have to take communion if you're professing the name of jesus christ you cannot decline that it's not a situation where you're unworthy and you just said it to the side he says if you do that there is no life in you we know this principle it's a scriptural principle we know it's not optional but brother branham says in his last message that there is going to come a time god is wanting to dwell in his people that's what he wants to do now he says and there's going to come a time you know the hour will soon arise right among us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira i believe that there is the possibility that this is a future event i believe this is also a current event but i also believe that this event was transpiring through the messages that brother branham was preaching because god wanting to dwell in his people requires as he just said requires reverence love purity of heart and mind and soul is that not the very purpose of the message coming to us so he's saying that these days are coming these situations are coming this hour is coming but what i don't want to happen is as us get under such expectation for somebody to walk into the church with hidden sin in their life and somebody to stand up and reveal that and that first person fall over dead number one if that's your motive and that and that's your objective and you think that's a good thing you got a problem jesus christ himself said i do not come to this world to destroy it i come to give life so if you would take any kind of joy or any kind of satisfaction with somebody number one having hidden sin in their life and coming into church and then falling over dead when that is revealed that is a wrong spirit christ's spirit is always for repentance an opportunity for repentance an opportunity to make things right so i am not against there being sin called out but i would pray and seek god and ask for mercy i do not want to see there being judgment dealt out i would cry for mercy because what if it's me it's fine and dandy when it's somebody else and it doesn't affect you but what if it's you would you not want somebody interceding for you would you not want an opportunity for repentance if something is called out but what i'm getting at here is this to me is not necessarily a future event but this is the very purpose of what the message has came to do it has came to give us that pureness of heart to give us that opportunity as the word is going forward to die to ourselves and have a pure heart when the word is going forth and sin is exposed in our life as we're sitting in church or as we're having a conversation with a brother or sister or as we're studying the message and reading our bible when that is revealed in our heart that this is not christ-like there is a there is a day of ananias and sapphira currently happening that sin is being called out that unbelief is being cut out but that opportunity for repentance is there when that hidden sin is exposed there is an opportunity for repentance why would it why would we wait and why would we put ourselves under a position when christ has revealed something to our heart from his word whether it's just by study or from a brother or sister or from the pulpit why would we wait and say well if he really means that he'll call it out by somebody brother randall says those days are coming and if it's really wrong well he'll get to it he'll call it out why not deal with it now why not deal with it now why tempt the lord why why possibly put yourself in the way of judgment see to me this is not when brother branham says that these that this hour will arise i do believe that he was saying that in the future but there is a people that are standing here now who have taken that message who has received that message who can make this a current event each and every day of their life so i would say that that day has come in 1965 that day was to arise but now i would say that day has come and i would say that we all want to take advantage of that day now and not let it go into a day of judgment because if we are his seed he is going to have his will but i would much rather fall on that stone and be broken than just be crushed to powder remember there's only two options neither one of them are pleasant neither one of them are going to feel good but i would much rather fall on the stone than be crushed to powder when it falls on me 1952 faith is faith in the son of god brother brandon says i want you to notice what faith taken place in jerusalem when people believed when they seen the article this is he's speaking immediately after ananias and sapphira was called out there just been a woman that came up and a man who went out and done something and came and thought that they could get by with it before the church they lied about it they said we sold our ground for so and so but there was a man standing there who was a prophet he said why has the devil put in your heart to lie to the holy ghost such a shock killed the man here come his wife sapphira he also told her the feet that packed your husband out i tell you when they seen that discerning that spirit moving and pointing to the person and telling who it was the critics hushed but today they're brazen right after the death of ananias and sapphira when peter pointed them out and told them what they had done the very condemnation to know that they were wrong shocked them till they died right there just think of that the holy spirit speaking said you've lied and you've done a certain thing and down they dropped the shock the condemnation of the holy spirit calling that thing out in their life brother branham says he says they died of a heart attack right there such a shock to their system they didn't have an opportunity to repent i pray they repented in their dying breaths but it still didn't stop the physical extreme shock to their body of the holy spirit revealing that that caused a physical death on them 1953 god's provided way he said peter and john were ignorant unlearned men the bible said they were absolutely ignorant but they had to take notice to them they'd been with jesus they had enough faith to heal a man at the gate called beautiful peter had enough power of god in him to tell ananias you are lying that's right you kept that money back and sapphire sapphira you did the same thing scared them so bad they had a heart attack and died and they packed them out and buried them amen that same god lives today that same program is god's program for today when he says that statement i don't believe that he's saying it's god's program for people to walk into the church and fall over dead when their sin is exposed i do not believe that is the will of god is it possible absolutely it was possible here at scriptural we cannot deny this it can get to this point but it doesn't have to and we have had a message come to keep us from this point we have had a message come that we can take this in the privacy of our own house and of our own rooms and our own pri prayer closet we can take this and examine our hearts to where this doesn't have to be the case it can be the case but it doesn't have to be the case so as i said when i started i don't want this to come across as a message of condemnation i don't want this to come across as a message of everybody getting scared we should be thankful we should be thankful we have this opportunity ananias and sapphira they didn't have what we have they didn't have the fullness of the word they they did not have a seven course meal laid out before them that they could go and examine their life they do they did not have the opportunity that we have but in this day in this age we have had christ himself come we have had the fullness of the word come himself to reveal the fullness of his nature so now ananias and sapphira and on all through the church ages they could walk in ignorance they could walk in ignorance and and there was there was honest ignorance if you would want to say it that way to where they would be walking in things that was not pleasing to the nature of god and they just simply wouldn't know it and there was nobody else there to call it out because they didn't know it either but now that has changed brother ram says now we've came to a free age and now the fullness of the word has come so that the entire nature of christ can be revealed to set us free from that that we do not have to walk scared in this position we do not have to enter the church with any fear in our lives we can check it by the message prior to coming to church we can check it each and every day what a privileged people we are so that's the point that i want to get to you it's it's not a message of if you mess up your you know you're going to be hurting or if you're hiding something you're going to be hurting it's not that type of message so you can relax a little bit it's not fire and brimstone yet but we we i want us to really grasp that what position do we stand in what opportunity do we have i assure you that ananias and sapphira would have longed for this opportunity forever longed to have the word revealed to them at such a point that they would have known i cannot get by with that that is silly to even think that way that is just dumb but there was nothing to prick that to them they learned it the hard way so to speak remember this was the church in its emphasis 1958 before i go there i just want to back up for a second i want to prove this to you when i say the days of ananias and sapphira the point is not for dead people because if you recall we had these days in brother branham's ministry with brother way brother brandon says he was preaching he exposed that complex in his life and he said he resented me exposing that and he died of a heart attack repeat of scripture a shock hit him so bad he physically had a heart attack and died i'll just remind you that the prophet of god did not leave him laying there dead and i want to put it this way if the power of god would fall in this assembly and do what it did in the days of ananias and sapphira i don't want to be the one standing on the side saying it served them right i want to be the one laying there praying for them calling out for mercy calling for their life to come back if there's any way because i'm not above that i'm in hybrid flesh just like you are i'm human just like you are and that's the spirit and the objective that i want to operate with and it's the same way now we we recognize that in a mighty physical demonstration and a very specific demonstration but the same thing happens each and every service and each and every time we come in contact with the word when the word exposes something to us you may not fall physically dead but you can walk out of those church doors dead as a door now because you have rejected the word i don't want that to be the case either if the word of god is coming and i'm not getting it i want somebody to intercede for me and to cry out for me god help him to see it god help him to get it because we all know it's just a it's just a common understanding it is ten times easier for me to see something wrong in your life than it is to see it in my life and it's ten times easier for you to see something wrong in my life than it is in your own that's why iron sharpeneth iron and the purpose of sharpening iron is not to kill your brother or your sister the point is to be able to cut that thing away from your brother and sister without hurting them with the right motive with the right objective to allow the power and demonstration and purity and realness of the days of ananias and sapphira to return into the church with the right motive and with the right objective not for death not for death physical or spiritual not for suffering but so that that person can be free so that they can walk in a pureness of heart truly giving all things that's the point and that's the spirit that i want to operate by so do i want the days of ananias and sapphira to return to the church in its fullness absolutely with the right spirit and with the right motives 1958 by faith moses he says she's going to be destroyed he's speaking of america because god is just and if america gets by with her sins the just and sovereign holy god will be duty bound to resurrect sodom and gomorrah and apologize to them for burning them up because of their sin if he lets us get by with it if he lets you get get to heaven on your unjust works he'll have to raise up ananias and sapphire and give them another opportunity he certainly would but he's just ananias saw his money i want you to listen real close to this ananias saw his money peter saw christ oh my lot didn't see the destruction of his children in that place many of you today holding around these old creeds and things you don't see the juvenile the delinquency and the destruction of your children you don't see your daughter in a prostitute house you don't see your son a drunkard or at a card table somewhere see how important it is it went farther farther than ananias and sapphira ananias and sapphira no doubt how children had family had friends but brother branham is saying that ananias couldn't see anything besides his money his love for his money he couldn't see the end result he couldn't see himself ending up dead his wife ending up dead he says lot lot when he made his decision to go to sodom it looked good it looked like the better decision but he said when lot did that he couldn't see the effect that it was going to have on his children he says many people hanging under these old formal creeds and things they don't see the effect that's going to have on their daughters and on their sons turn their daughters into prostitutes turn let their sons be down at the at a drunkard or at the card table see the pureness of your heart has way more effect than just on you i'll say it this way the reality of truly giving all or not giving all has much more effect than just on you because you're going to go off of the scene one day but what effect is your life going to have on your children if you lived a life before them of being able to cover something up from the word of god not truly giving all to the word of god do not try to convince me that's not going to have an effect on your children i'm not scared of a lot of things at least i don't think i'm scared of a lot of things but i'll tell you one thing that terrifies me and that keeps me up praying at night and maybe being a parent just changed this for me but one thing that terrifies me is when i look into the eyes of them little boys knowing they've got to be born again or they're going to be lost knowing they have to have a rebirth knowing they have to have the fullness of their word knowing that they have to have christ and the thing that would terrify me is if me in my self-desires and my pridefulness would do something to not sacrifice everything that i am for this message and not give everything that i am for this word that has been presented my way if i would hold on to a job or a position that would keep me out of the house of god or that would keep my children out of the house of god i'm not talking about missing a service here or there or sickness or whatever a vacation i'm not talking about that i'm talking about knowingly entering into an occupation that you're going to have to give up the house of god don't think that's not going to affect your children you have just told your children occupation is more than being in the house of god i don't even try to tell me it's the will of god that is so simple i don't even have to pray about it if your occupation keeps you out of the house of god when it's open it's not the will of the lord for you to be there it's just not saints it doesn't require prayer that's priorities and again i'm don't take this fanatical i'm not talking if you've got to go to go to school on a weekend or on a wednesday temporarily or something temporarily that's not what i'm talking about i'm not talking fanaticism and i'm not talking legalism i'm talking examine your heart are you holding on to an occupation outside of the house of god and it doesn't have to be an occupation it can be anything it can be a hobby it can be family it can be anything but the point is don't think that you can hold a confession before your children or before the people that you associate with that i have given all and something just that simple declares that you haven't you will be spiritually dead you will be riding a black horse after you got off your red horse of defending why you had to keep that job or that occupation or that hobby or that schooling or whatever it is you're going to go from the white horse to the red horse to the black horse and find yourself just like ananias and sapphira spiritually dead confessing i've given all and in that simplicity your children is going to recognize that you didn't again that's just an elementary example but it's it's really that simple and that is something that again i don't take a legalistic approach to it it's not about legalism it's not about lining up to what i think or what i say i'm just saying examine your heart examine your heart what is more important what are young people what are you basing your life decisions around a salary of x amount of dollars to live in a certain location where it don't go from 40 to 15 degrees in a single day what are you basing your motives and your objective and your routes on your your life decisions on what are you basing that on what are you considering can you approach god and say i'm giving you everything you are my all in all all i want is you now you direct my paths or do you are you so focused on something you want to achieve and something you want to be a title you want to have tact to your name that you would forsake the word of god even in assembling yourself together that you would forfeit that to accomplish something carnally moving on it's really that simple it really is brother brandon says and i just want to read this one more time because this is this is really important i want us to remember that lot didn't see the destruction of his children when he made that decision let's consider that 1961 paradox he says and through his sacrificial death at calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible oh my i wish my church could get that i've often wanted to come into a church i've longed to see it i guess where i could walk in the door look across the audience and see a perfect church all in order sin could not stay there no the spirit call it out you see it just couldn't stay like ananias and sapphira you just couldn't do it there'll be no sin in that group no sir now see the spirit quickly speak it like that no matter what it was how little it would be done see women and men sitting there under the power of the holy spirit the spirit of god moving perfectly someone had done something wrong in the congregation they would come quickly confess it before them because they know right then it's going to be called that's the church of the living god how my old poor heart now it's getting old how i've longed to stand and see a church like that i may yet i hope to look at the desire that he's after here it's not for people to come into the church and fall over dead because they got sin in their life it's for a church to be setting in perfection and perfection is not meaning that they don't make mistakes perfection what he is saying here is he wants to come into a church to where there is pureness of heart and if there's not pureness of heart that the people that does have pure hearts would be able to identify it in people that don't have pure hearts and let them know that doesn't have to be before two or three people in fact it's unscriptural for it to be before two or three people before you go to that brother because the scripture teaches that if you have ought with the brother you've got to go to that brother first singly or that sister so if you think it's the will of god just to stand up and publicly declare it without going to that brother first if you have that opportunity you're wrong if you have the opportunity if you have the opportunity to speak to that person privately first you have to do it or you break the scripture you are out of the will of the lord if you publicly declare it before you go to that person first it's wrong it's against the principles that paul taught he says don't do it go to that person privately first and then if they don't hear you take a brother and then if they don't hear you declare it before the church brother bran says i long to see a church like that i long to see a church like that i long to see a church like that because i said before there's no doubt there are things in my life not that i know of god is my witness not that i know of but no doubt there are things in my life that i'm wrong in but until he reveals it to me i just don't know as the old saying is you don't know what you don't know but i want to know i want to know and i want to have the spirit of christ that when it's revealed i bring it into subjection to the word and if that comes across the pulpit praise the lord if it comes from my brothers and sisters in the assembly praise the lord if it call if it comes from the purple-haired lady of great greeting me at walmart praise the lord i don't care where it comes from i just want it to come and i want to subject myself to that whatever route it comes in i want to look at let's go to second kings second kings four i want to look at just a couple subjects that found themselves in not good positions because by the time we get to the end of this you're going to realize when brother brainer says that the days of ananias and sapphira are coming we're going to realize that the days of ananias since the fire started in genesis and ends in revelation second kings 4 25 this is gaheza the servant of elisha he walked right beside elisha speaking of the shunamite woman it says so she went and came into the man of god to mount carmel this is right after her son died and it came to pass when the man of god elisha saw her afar off that he said to gehaza his servant behold yonder is that a might run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it as well and when she came to the man of god to the heel she caught him by the feet but gahesa came near to thrust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me so here is geheza the man that was living with elisha walking with elisha sleeping with elisha eating with elisha everything elisha was doing he was doing and here comes the shunamite woman after she lost her son and she has a revelation if i can get to the man who gave me this son the god in the man that gave me this son if i can get to him all as well but there is something in gehese's character that when this woman comes and latches on to the feet of the only hope that she has he would try to thrust her away from that to the point that elisha would have to tell him don't do that let her alone the lord has hid something from me and she has came to reveal something to me that i might know how to handle this situation so you can see by this portion of scripture there's something tweaked in gehese's character there's something tweaked in gehese's character because if this was gehey's son that has died i don't think he would want somebody pulling him off of the prophet's feet so why would he do that to somebody else you see gehese has got himself lifted up in his position and he's now now because he's lifted up in his position he can't let anybody get between him and that prophet because it might affect his position so now when somebody comes and they thrust themselves in there needing help needing grace needing mercy needing healing he would come and try to pull them away from that something wrong with this character he says let's continue tracking this down this is in second kings five second kings 5 14 then went he down speaking of naaman then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god that's what elisha told him to do go dip in jordan seven times and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all of the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused so naaman is trying to give a gift to elisha he's trying to show thanksgiving it's honorable there's nothing wrong with that he's trying to give back because he's received something but elisha says that's not my portion i'm not taking anything thank you but no thank you and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burdens of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt off offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord and in this saying the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of women to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of remnan when i bow myself down in the house of remnan the lord pardoned thy servant in this thing so he's saying my master still a heathen he's going to go and do these things i'm his right hand man but that's not where my heart is at so the lord pardoned me when i carry those functions out and elisha speaks to me says and they said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a little way but gegaza the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared naaman this syrian and not receiving at his hands that which he hath brought but as the lord liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him so gaza followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments and naaman said unto him be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver and two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon his two servants and they bear them before him and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence cometh thou gehesa and he said thy servant went no wither and he said unto him went not my heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and olive yards and vineyards and sheep and oxygen oxen and men servants and maidservants the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed forever and he went out from his presence a leper as white of snow i would bear to say that naaman wasn't considering the effects this would have on his children when he did this for a little money and two changes of garments he didn't consider the effects this would have not only on him but on his children forever this is mind-boggling to me how a man can walk with the living word for his age and see the discernment day in and day out and know that this man speaks with god and god speaks with him on a daily basis and he would get so exalted and lifted up in his position this is a lucifer spirit it's so clear he gets so lifted up in his position of walking with the man of god that now he would go and he would do something and that's wrong within itself but he would have the brazenness to come back and stand before the man of god like he doesn't doesn't know what happened and look at him and lie to him where have thou where's that went okay i didn't go anywhere i don't know what you're talking about he's lost his mind saints he has literally become so possessed of an evil spirit in his own position that he has lost his mind like elisha doesn't know or if he doesn't know like god's not going to reveal it to him he's literally lost his mind i can't wrap my mind around this i can't understand this but this is the frailty of human beings this is the frailty of ananias and sapphire to set in that early church and see the miraculous and then think you're going to pull one over on god what happened in both of these situations is they failed to recognize that god wants to indwell his people that's what god was trying to do in the early church and they failed to recognize the desire of god to express himself to his people that's what gehesa missed is this was not just a prophet this was not just a man of god this was god's desire remember he had he only had three parts in the back of his mind a three-part plan in the back of his mind that was to express himself he doesn't realize that as he's doing this this little bit of money and this little change of garment that he's going against the very sole purpose of god wanting to indwell his people wanting to expose a pure heart or an impure heart second kings now let me let me go here i'll just make it real simple and say what brother branham said 1958 looking at the unseen and when the great when the great crisis come which always does then when geheza being just a lukewarm church member there you have it he's identified the character of de gaza so when a great crisis comes a lukewarm church member is going to go against what the prophet has taught in such simple things and think that they're okay with it that's the characteristics that's the spirit that was on gehesa then when geheza being just a lukewarm church member he had not seen what elijah had seen because elijah was used to walking by faith and he was looking at the unseen all the time and he knew that god had said in the psalms the angels of god are encamped about those that fear him that was enough for elijah just the word was enough for elisha but geheza had just halfway believed it he was just a church member if you're just a church member and your confession is you're just a church member so be it but that wasn't gahey's confession gehey's confession was i walk with the living word on a daily basis that's why this was a problem because if you have a confession i walk with the living word on a daily basis you're not going to go try to sneak something behind the living word to accomplish your self desires that was the problem so if gaza would have just came back and told him elisha i wanted to buy some donkeys and i needed two talents of silver so i went and got it from him i don't know what the outcome would have been but at least he's honest at least he doesn't have leprosy if he would have just told him my clothes were getting too tight i needed some new garments and i really liked that color that he had pureness of heart see if there is something laying in your heart that's impure so long as you're honest about it there's the capability of god to come and remove it but if you're not honest about it he has no capability to remove it and spiritual death follows every time second kings 8 verse 1 says then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou thou can't sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and he shall also come upon the land seven years so elisha goes back to the shunamite woman after her son is raised and he says there's a famine coming on the land go anywhere you can to preserve yourself it's okay just just go wherever you can wherever the lord leads you bad times are coming and the woman arose and did after after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years and it came to pass at the end of the seven years in that the woman returned out of the lands of the philistines and she went forth to crime to the king for her house and for her land i'm not going to go into all the types there we know that's the church ages we know that this is a restoration afterwards we know she's crying unto the king just like we have the capability to do now but it says here something very interesting and the king talked with geheza the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done elisha is smitten with leprosy but he finds himself at the disposal of the king and the king is requesting him tell me what you've seen tell me the great things that god did through elijah tell me of these things i want to hear about them and gehazis starts talking it says and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and geheza said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elijah restored to life and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed to her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all of the fruits of the field since the day the day that she left the land even until now so gegaza come and he lies to the living word he lies to elisha he covers something up he's smitten with leprosy he's cast out from the presence of the living word and now he finds himself in a position that the only thing that he can do is testify about what happened in a previous generation the only thing that he can testify about is what god did in somebody else's life he has no capability the king did not come and ask him what did get what did elisha do in your life what did god do through you the king's question to him is what did god do through elisha and geheza had no ability to interject oh by the way this is what he did for me because he had an impure heart in so much that as he even tries to tell the king and witness and testify what god did in somebody else's life the person that that that god moved through comes on the scene and says be quiet i can testify myself i can tell the king myself what god has done in my life geheza put himself in such a position that he couldn't even testify what god had did in a prior age see this is the effects of spiritual death you end up on a pale horse you have no life in you whatsoever geheza can't even testify about what he's seen because god won't permit it in the court of law another person cannot testify about what another person has seen it's considered hearsay it's thrown out every time only the person with the testimony can testify jesus starts trying to steal this woman's testimony and god won't even permit it in his scriptures he sends that woman in you tell me what a coincidence that is the king asks tell me what happened and he starts telling him what happened about this certain lady and that certain lady just happens to show up at the same place at the same time i'm willing to guess there's several zeros on the end of those odds this was ordained of god to hold his scriptures true no geheseh you will not testify about what i have done in my bride's life she will testify what i have done in her life she is the one with a pure heart she is the one to stand in the presence of the king we don't want to come to that point we want to approach god with a pure heart and we want to be thankful for that opportunity we're coming to a close i want to touch on one more person and then we're going to wrap this up exodus 15 verse 20 you don't have to turn there it says in miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances this is just right after they passed through the red sea and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea so we know miriam is the sister of moses they come through the red sea this is referred to many times how she takes the tambourine runs up and down the shores singing the praises of god she is really in the spirit but there's something to be exposed in miriam numbers 12 and miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it you'll notice there's a pattern here it's the same pattern that lucifer took self-fog self-exaltation i would like to ask her why she wasn't asking this question when moses was calling for the plagues down in egypt why didn't you ask this question then he was married to an ethiopian woman then why aren't you making fun of him then why aren't you making fun of him when you're standing there before the red sea and you see him speaking part the waters why don't you have something to say then but now when they come through that and if you want to say the spirit fades away a little bit there's not so much miraculous happening it's a wilderness journey it's the nitty-gritty it's the daily walk and now they got something to say about moses now he's not such a self you know not such a glorious figure now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth and the lord spake suddenly unto moses and to aaron and unto miriam come out ye three under the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out it looks like god's vindicated what aaron and aaron and miriam said now it's god himself saying moses and aaron and miriam come out the story don't end there though and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron aaron and miriam and they both come forth oh my i mean look at the vindication of her doctrine now god does not just speak with moses he speaks with aaron and me as well in so much that he calls us when he calls moses in so much that he actually has now just called for me and aaron sounds like lucifer to me and he said the lord speaking hear now my words he's about to speak to them personally that's pretty good then to take vindication if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known in him in a vision and i will speak to him in a dream my service servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house with him will i speak mouth-to-mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses this is god's polite way of saying what were you thinking do you have any clue who this is to me what are you doing and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous and aaron said unto moses at last my lord oh at last my lord alas my lord it's not what he was saying a couple verses earlier i beseech thee laying off the sin upon us where we where in we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned this is the smartest thing that aaron has done in a long time this has been exposed and he immediately repents the only chance that he had let her not be as undead and of whom the flesh is half consumed when he when he cometh out of the mother's womb now look at the character of moses and moses cried unto the lord saying give her what she deserves no says heal her now lord heal her now oh god i beseech thee moses moses took no pride in this situation he took no joy in this situation and the lord said unto moses if her father had been spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp even seven days and after that let her be received again and miriam was shed out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not until miriam was brought in again this is another example of the days of ananias and sapphira even before the days of ananias since the fire arrived there was an exposure of the heart but thank god there was an opportunity for repentance and that opportunity was seized upon and life was preserved and this is the way the true church of god should operate because not only was life preserved but that church said we're not moving until they can come with us until miriam can get cleansed and come with us there was no desire for the congregation to move on and leave somebody behind it was not even in the desire of god because remember the congregation moved when the pillar of fire moved and when the cloud moved so if god would have had a desire to leave her behind he would have moved but the pillar of fire didn't move and the cloud didn't move because the character of god was not for death the character of god was to expose sin so that there can be repentance and there can be life come forth in the whole body but remember brother branham says if you take that name of the lord jesus christ and then you go and you live a life unworthy of that you'll have to pay for that numbers 20 verse 1 then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zen in the first month and the people abode in kadush and miriam died there and was buried there 1965 the easter seal brother branham said this concerning that moses had that quickening power there never was a man like him on the earth until jesus for he didn't only see visions he talked face to face with god even a prophetess miriam disputed his word one day he said don't you fear god consider my servant moses there's nobody in the world like him this hour there's never been anybody like moses i speak to moses what did he ever say that wasn't true don't you say a word against him and right then she was stricken with leprosy and was dying she didn't live very long afterwards moses prayed for her so even though there was repentance even though there was intercession even though she was healed of the leprosy that flagrant violation against god in flesh the word made flesh that flagrant uh that flagrant statement that she made carried a consequence and brother brennan says she died very shortly after that thank god there was repentance thank god she was made whole thank god the church didn't move on without her thank god she was with the church when it moved but there's still a penalty to pay for an impure heart god speaking in deuteronomy 20 40 says take heed in the plague of leprosy thou observed diligent diligently and do according to all that the priests and levites shall teach you as i commanded them so ye shall observe to do it remember what the lord thy god did unto miriam by the way after that he were come forth out of egypt so this is such a serious event that even god himself picks it up when he's telling the people to mind what the levites are telling you do what they say especially when it comes to the to the plague of leprosy mind your peace mind your cues remember mary he wasn't joking about it brother branham says miriam i won't read you all the quotes but he said miriam disrespected spoke against and should have known better that was her problems she disrespected the word of god the man of god she spoke against the man of god and he said she should have known better in the church age book rev brother brandon says he reads the scripture revelation chapter 2 verse 5 as the musicians would come please revelation revelation chapter 2 verse 5 speaking of the ephesian church age says remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent through the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his his place except thou repent brother brandon says god tells them to remember evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first stage was pentecost this is me speaking now but remember what pentecost was pentecost wasn't just a day pentecost certainly not a denomination pentecost was a group of 120 people with pureness of heart that's what pentecost was pentecost would have never happened if 120 people didn't have pureness of heart that's why the scripture says they were all in one accord that's what brother branham says was the beginning the point of origin pureness of heart him speaking now they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality back to when they could say for me to live is christ back to purity when ananias and sapphira were dealt with sin laying in the church has to be dealt with and when i say church don't think these walls here the body sin laying in the body has to be dealt with or it's impure and it is not the will of god there's no point to have a body of christ if there's sin in it because it's not pure it does there's not even any point in having church if we're going to have sin in the body i mean is that too far-fetched he says we need to get back to that in mind and then in reality i would just give you some free advice here don't worry about the sin and your brother and sister worried about your own and then if god needs to pick you up and reveal something to your brother and sister he'll do that and we'll accept that we're happy for that but let's make sure we're focused on the right thing back to purity of mind my own mind and then living that out in reality he says back to the gate beautiful all what a report reproach it is to drift from god and countenance those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for god look at what you once were in your heart and mind and in your life then go back to it this is still good advice remember what you were when you first came to christ and received the baptism of the holy spirit the only way you received that is with pureness of heart you wouldn't have received it if you had something still laying in your heart it can't happen the only way for that to happen is when you completely forsake your will and accept his will when you completely forsake your spirit and say will will his spirit come in and brother branham is saying don't lose that hold on to that that's your point of origin that's the pureness of heart is when you've come to that point to be broken completely and says not what not my will but your will he says look at what you once were in your heart and in your mind and in your life that pureness of heart then go back to it he says and what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to god by the way of repentance then the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more why because you knew better just like miriam prove it by your life if you do not repent said god i will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition cannot give light to the world don't make it plural make it singular a person in that condition cannot give light to the world a person in that condition cannot truly represent the message of the hour christ in me the hope of glory that only comes with pureness of heart its light has turned to darkness god will then take away its faithful messenger and its faithful shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about christianity but be beref of it if you make excuses for anything laying in your heart that's not like the character of christ that's the result god will remove the candlestick and i will say it this way the candlestick may still physically stand there but you will be dull to the effects of it the candlestick may still stand there and say the exact same things that it's been saying but your ears will be close to it and it's been removed from you now if you'll just play something softly please we're going to close but i told you this was not a condemnation message you've been a little bit quiet it's not hellfire and brimstone you can relax there is an opportunity for repentance so we'll end on a positive note look at david look at everything that david did evenly that he knew better to do to the point that nathan i believe it was nathan the prophet would come to him and he'd say david a man has done a b and c and david said kill him any man that would do something like that is worthy of death and nathan would enter saying he says surely thou will not die but you're that man and david immediately repents the scripture declares david a man after god's own heart but look at everything that he did that was wrong so that certainly can't be a man after god's own heart in that condition that that certainly can't be what god is referring to what god is referring to is that every time every time david fell every time he did something wrong and the truth was presented to him he repented every time [Music] the days of ananias and sapphira were well be back before the days of ananias and sapphire the days of ananias and sapphira were all the way back in genesis 3. man had fallen sewed together fig leaves god comes and says where are you kind of like elisha saying to jesus where have you been like he doesn't know god himself comes if you'll stand with me god himself comes and says adam adam where art thou adam clothed in fig leaves we've heard this before but just think of it clothed in fig leaves in the presence of that voice declares i am naked here is the days of ananias and sapphira thousands of years before the days of ananias and sapphira arrived a full exposure of the heart by the word of god [Music] but adam can repent god intercedes and makes a way because it wasn't adam's heart desire to be in that position and he had enough sense about him as a son of god that when god came and says where art thou he didn't try to say here i am i'm fully clothed nothing's wrong we're fine you can go back to where you came from [Music] but adam had enough pureness of heart that when the voice of god the word of god came by his way he says here i am and i'm naked help me this is where it started at and this is where it ends at because we just read revelation 2. when that bride tree starts out brother brandon says don't ever forget where your origin is because if you forget where your origin is you're going to end up in death and he says remember remember remember where you started out at and where did we all start out at saints i begged that question to you where did we all start out at full repentance to god full death to self the days of ananias and sapphira were back there they were at the early church and the opportunity is here today but we stand in such a rare position because now with the fullness of the word coming the fullness of the heart can be exposed and the scripture says who can know the heart of men it is deceitful it is wicked but because we've had a full word come to expose the full heart it doesn't have to be that way so let's allow those days to be current events let's not wait for something to happen let's let it happen let the word expose us but before you go into spiritual death just repent just repent and this is not a evangelistic workup of you know pack the altar repent i'm not into that if you want to come to the altar you're more welcome to i'm not against that what i'm for is pureness of heart both here and both there let's pray together lord jesus we just want to thank you for this opportunity that you've given us lord father and i pray that you would just take the words that have been spoken and that you would place them as only you can lord you know where each and every one needs to go and i pray that you would just appropriately place them father i pray that you would just let the people see what i was driving out here lord i just pray that this would not be a what we would term a depressing type of message or a condemnation type of message lord that's not my desire that's not my intent my desire is thanksgiving lord that we can stand here as such a privileged people to walk upright before a living god with pureness of heart not trying to self-preserve ourselves lord not trying to hide something from you but that we have a full word laid before us before us in this age that we can lay ourselves before it and let it completely expose us that we do not have to be like ananias and sapphire and the only results would be death lord that we can come and lay ourselves down before you and die to ourself lord that you may live father i pray that you would just be with us now lord that we would just each and everyone check ourselves as your prophet said may we remember may we remember that point that first point in our life as your prophet taught us what you did through the church ages you do to the individual and may we go back to that ephesian age in our life and remember that point of realization that i am lost without this word and i completely repent before it and i completely give myself over to it may we be thankful that we have that opportunity lord may we not take that lightly and may we do that each and every day lord we love you we just pray your blessings upon this people that you would be with them father we just pray our blessings upon our pastor and his family may you just go and touch them now lord give
