[0:00] like Moses on the back side of the
[0:01] desert no matter how well he was
[0:03] educated whatever whatever had taken
[0:07] place his fears and frustrations left
[0:09] because he stood on a sacred ground with
[0:10] God that nobody could take it away from
[0:13] him and every man or woman that has an
[0:16] experience with God has met this same
[0:18] Pillar of Fire upon the sacred grounds
[0:20] of your heart there is no Theologian no
[0:23] devil no nothing Paul said nothing
[0:25] present nothing futured in death
[0:27] sickness sorrow can separate us from the
[0:29] love of God that's in Christ Jesus it's
[0:31] a typos you know something happened no
[0:34] matter how much science raised up raises
[0:36] this that or the other you are tied you
[0:39] and God become one he's in you and
[0:41] you're in him
[0:42] why because through this message he's
[0:45] given a voice in this day and that voice
[0:48] is the voice of God just like at Mount
[0:50] Sinai and we've got an option we can run
[0:53] away from that voice or we can run to
[0:54] that voice and stand before God face to
[0:57] face
[0:59] you know the Apostle Paul was struck
[1:01] down by a light and that light had a
[1:03] voice behind it and that voice was Jesus
[1:05] Christ and he says who are you Lord amen
[1:07] you know he went back into the form of
[1:09] Pillar of Fire which he was before amen
[1:11] and he says I'm G I'm Jesus whom you
[1:13] persecute but you know there was other
[1:14] men with Paul and those other men did
[1:17] not clearly understand what the voice
[1:19] said they heard something but they
[1:20] didn't hear a voice and then they heard
[1:22] something but they saw no man they saw a
[1:24] light but then they didn't hear there's
[1:25] several different reports in the Bible
[1:28] what does it show it looks like a
[1:30] confusion maybe the story doesn't match
[1:31] what it shows amen is no matter how loud
[1:35] The Voice rings out only the elect will
[1:37] hear the voice and meet God face to face
[1:39] they were all there when the light shine
[1:41] but only Paul's the one who met Jesus
[1:44] Christ
[1:45] they were there when Jesus was declaring
[1:47] himself in a pillar of fire they were
[1:49] there when he was thundering out the
[1:50] word but only the elect predestinated
[1:52] met God face to face
[1:55] how many people said in brother
[1:56] Bennett's meetings and how many heard
[1:58] the word priest and how many were there
[2:00] for the seals but only a few met God
[2:02] face to face
[2:05] how many listened to the tapes how many
[2:07] have read the books how many said in a
[2:09] message how many hear the anointed
[2:10] preaching of the word but how many meet
[2:12] God face to face
[2:15] because we've got to go beyond the image
[2:17] before our eyes and go past that and
[2:19] who's behind the animate who's past the
[2:21] veil who's beyond all of that it's God
[2:24] back there declaring himself showing
[2:26] that I am present you can meet me face
[2:29] to face not a book not a tape not a
[2:32] Creed not a new teaching amen but the
[2:35] person he's declaring himself by a voice
[2:41] and we can meet him
[2:43] face to face
[2:45] you can come to the same service and
[2:47] hear the same exact words and one person
[2:50] will have met God face to face
[2:52] and they would have their lives
[2:54] discerned and their aunt questions
[2:55] answered and Direction and instruction
[2:57] and it'd be almost prophetic
[3:00] and another person will sit there and I
[3:03] got nothing and I saw nothing and that
[3:04] man behind the pulpit and the other
[3:06] person said I didn't even see the man
[3:07] behind the pulpit it was God speaking to
[3:09] me
[3:11] how can how can we walk out of the same
[3:14] service in somebody's miraculously
[3:16] delivered and somebody's all tied up in
[3:17] knots
[3:20] because we've got to look Beyond the
[3:21] Veil
[3:22] and listen for a voice
