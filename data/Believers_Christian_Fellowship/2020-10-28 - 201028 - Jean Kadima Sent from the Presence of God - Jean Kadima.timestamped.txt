[8:05] luke chapter 1
[8:10] verse 18

[8:18] oh i heard the announcement the couple
[8:21] is
[8:22] back here god bless you brother blake
[8:24] and sister emily
[8:27] and i heard that uh we have one hour

[8:34] so if you forget it's okay because you
[8:36] can come to church
[8:38] one hour earlier you can pray for us
[8:42] it's okay
[8:45] so let's just read uh luke
[8:48] chapter 1 verse 18 and zechariah said
[8:52] unto the angel
[8:54] whereby shall i know this
[8:57] for i am an old man and my wife was
[9:00] stricken in
[9:01] ears and the angel answering said unto
[9:05] him
[9:06] i'm gabrielle that stand in the presence
[9:09] of god and
[9:10] am sent to speak unto thee and
[9:13] to show thee this glad tidings
[9:17] and behold thou shalt be dumb and not
[9:20] able to
[9:21] speak until the day that this thing
[9:24] shall be performed
[9:26] because thou believes not my words which
[9:29] shall be fulfilled
[9:30] in their season may god add his blessing
[9:34] to the reading of the word you may take
[9:36] your seats
[9:44] so as i say i'm sharing you
[9:48] my not
[9:51] a few notes with you um
[9:56] so i was looking at this scripture
[10:00] and i know is this scripture that we
[10:02] heard
[10:03] about recently zacarius
[10:07] represent the system of churches the
[10:10] denominations
[10:12] the word of his time came through an
[10:14] angel
[10:16] and he looked at it
[10:19] and look uh and thought about it
[10:23] and his intellectual could not grasp
[10:26] this and because of that
[10:30] the angels say because you did not
[10:33] believe
[10:34] you become dumb but instead
[10:38] we heard that it was actually his wife
[10:41] the woman
[10:42] that now went to prophesy and
[10:45] it sounds like the time we are living
[10:48] right now
[10:49] where the system cannot
[10:53] comprehend cannot accept the word
[10:58] now is the time for the bride to
[11:01] go and prophesy again
[11:04] so but i was looking at a different
[11:07] uh you know some words on it and
[11:10] uh looking at angel stand in the
[11:14] presence of god and
[11:16] sand to speak and
[11:20] and my i came with this
[11:24] message this
[11:27] the title um sent from the presence
[11:30] of god strange title right
[11:34] brother branham had strange titles
[11:38] for example you will say from this
[11:41] time on and he will preach on it
[11:45] kind of putting prepositions and
[11:48] you know together and come up with a
[11:51] message
[11:54] you will think that a person who speak
[11:57] french
[11:57] will come up with a title like that
[12:01] because it's like fascinating how
[12:03] english can be so
[12:05] poor and rich at the same time you know
[12:08] you think
[12:09] from this time on in
[12:12] french you cannot say that i'm pretty
[12:15] sure
[12:15] in other language you cannot say that
[12:18] because
[12:19] you know you're just taking proposition
[12:21] and everybody
[12:22] understands meaning that
[12:26] before there was something then
[12:29] that thing stopped and then
[12:32] from that time and forever
[12:37] something else started you can't say
[12:40] that in french
[12:42] so brother brenham was as fascinated as
[12:45] us
[12:46] french speakers when he saw that
[12:49] wow what is this it starts preaching
[12:51] about it
[12:52] so because of that then i can
[12:56] also do this sent from the presence of
[13:01] god and what that means
[13:04] you know what that means
[13:08] sent from the presence of god
[13:11] this angel was sent from the presence of
[13:14] god
[13:14] does it mean uh it came from a certain
[13:18] location
[13:19] in heaven that heaven has like
[13:23] uh you know town cities and
[13:27] he's coming from a physical location
[13:31] i look at it and i found
[13:35] i got more from this so
[13:38] and i'm going to go on a limb here i'm
[13:40] going to take some liberty
[13:43] and it's that's why it's good to preach
[13:45] to a church that is mature they can
[13:48] allow you to take some liberty
[13:50] and keep going they have a filter they
[13:53] can filter
[13:54] and understand things what is
[13:57] sent from the presence
[14:01] of god what does that mean
[14:05] so and
[14:08] i had some few answers here you can bear
[14:11] with me
[14:15] does it mean access to god
[14:18] so because you have access to god
[14:23] you are sent by god
[14:26] commission to do something all this
[14:29] seems to be
[14:30] right yes
[14:34] i have access
[14:37] to god i'm send by him
[14:41] all right i'm commissioned to do what
[14:44] i'm supposed to do
[14:45] i have a mandate it has a
[14:49] vest is power in me i have a permission
[14:52] if
[14:53] because you doubt what i say
[14:56] i have the authorization the permission
[14:59] i
[14:59] am vested with power to make you dumb
[15:06] that's that's true
[15:10] but i found that that is not sufficient
[15:15] it's true that he has access to god
[15:19] is sent by god he
[15:22] is commissioned he has a mandate that's
[15:25] true
[15:26] but that's not all
[15:31] so then i go to let's go to
[15:34] second chronicles and look at it
[15:40] ii chronicle 18 18
[15:45] it says again he said
[15:48] therefore hear the word of the lord
[15:52] this is a makaya we know this scripture
[15:56] very well because
[15:56] brother brahm talks a lot about it
[16:00] is makaya speaking to the king
[16:03] of israel and king of judah
[16:07] is uh telling them what he saw in a
[16:11] vision
[16:12] that if they go to war they're going to
[16:15] lose
[16:17] and he say again verse 18
[16:20] again he say therefore hear the word of
[16:23] the lord
[16:24] i saw the lord sitting upon his throne
[16:28] and all the hosts of heaven standing on
[16:31] his
[16:31] right hand and on his left
[16:35] the lord said who shall i entice
[16:39] we shall entice ahab king of israel that
[16:42] he may
[16:43] go up and fall at ramos
[16:46] gilead and and one speaks
[16:50] saying after this manner and another
[16:52] saying after
[16:53] that manner let's just notice that
[16:57] in a heaven in certain dimension
[17:00] which i don't know god
[17:04] had angels around him
[17:07] somewhere on his right hand others were
[17:10] in his left hand
[17:12] right and we realized that some of them
[17:15] were demons spirits
[17:20] are you with me and god say i want
[17:24] ahab to go and die because
[17:27] that's what my prophet said and i want
[17:30] to fulfill that
[17:32] word but who can entice him to go
[17:36] and get killed demons came
[17:40] what the bible says some of the angel
[17:43] was on the right hand i hope the good
[17:45] angels were
[17:47] because the right hand means the power
[17:49] of god
[17:51] so there were others on the left some
[17:54] came and
[17:54] everyone starts speaking lord send me
[17:58] i will do this and god says
[18:02] it won't work and another one came and
[18:05] said
[18:06] send me and god say
[18:09] no it won't work and the third one came
[18:13] and this is what he says verse 20
[18:17] then they came out in spirit and stood
[18:20] before the lord and said
[18:22] i will entice him and the lord say unto
[18:25] him
[18:25] wherewith how are you going to do it he
[18:28] said
[18:29] and he said i will go out and be a lying
[18:32] spirit in the mouth of
[18:34] his prophets and the lord said thou
[18:37] shalt entice him and thou shalt also
[18:41] prevail
[18:42] go out and do even so and now therefore
[18:46] behold the lord had
[18:47] put a lying spirit in the mouth of this
[18:51] prophet and the lord has spoken evil
[18:54] against
[18:55] thee this
[18:58] when this angel
[19:02] evil angel a demon
[19:05] spoke to the lord he say i have a
[19:08] strategy
[19:09] i'm going to be lying spirit in the
[19:12] mouth
[19:12] of this
[19:16] these prophets god say oh you will
[19:18] succeed
[19:20] yeah absolutely they love their
[19:22] denomination spirit if you speak to them
[19:25] they will all
[19:25] go like oh this is true
[19:30] now but i wanted you to notice
[19:33] that this demons this
[19:37] angels were coming from the presence of
[19:41] god
[19:43] is that right and they were sent
[19:47] do we agree and they were mandated they
[19:50] had a mandate
[19:52] they had to do something they were
[19:55] commissioned to do that
[19:57] a mandate is that right yeah
[20:01] look they had access to god
[20:06] and sent by god to do what
[20:10] to do evil work
[20:13] so god can fulfill his purpose
[20:16] so therefore this what
[20:20] makes this angel gabriel great
[20:23] is not just before because he has
[20:26] access to god is sent by god
[20:30] commissioned to do something there must
[20:32] be more than that
[20:37] i can give more example influence 1963.
[20:42] brother branham say i have heard the
[20:44] people say oh
[20:45] satan can't do that
[20:48] yes you just let god lift
[20:52] his hand one time and watch what happens
[20:56] it's i constantly plead god
[20:59] don't send him have mercy on me
[21:04] keep him away from me so
[21:07] god can send satan according to some
[21:10] rules that
[21:12] are over there that we don't know he can
[21:15] send him maybe he will say jean has
[21:18] having too much fun
[21:22] and you have been so good to him
[21:25] can i go let me because that's not
[21:28] fair you know that's not faith
[21:33] and he can let him do that
[21:37] but i have also the right to say god
[21:40] don't send
[21:40] him have mercy on me
[21:44] all of us we have the right to say god
[21:47] don't send me
[21:48] keep me from all evil is that what we
[21:51] pray
[21:53] keep us from evil is that the prayer of
[21:56] the lord
[21:57] we have the right but we see that the
[22:00] devil has also the right to do
[22:02] things but all
[22:05] works together for the good
[22:08] for the good of those who love god
[22:13] christ is revealed in his own word
[22:17] 1965.
[22:19] i was just talking to a young minister
[22:22] and his wife
[22:23] in the room just a few moments ago
[22:26] and both of them have uh
[22:30] nervous just like the rest of the world
[22:34] the rest of the human beings on earth
[22:37] i say remember satan got a punch
[22:40] coming at you
[22:43] you see it takes just more than having
[22:47] the power
[22:49] to be the angel of the lord sent
[22:52] from the presence of god there is
[22:55] something
[22:56] more you see satan gets
[22:59] a punch coming at you
[23:04] don't care i don't care who you are
[23:08] he's got a right for that one punch
[23:12] which had you which had you rather be
[23:16] that the the punch be blind of being
[23:20] arthritic
[23:22] sitting in a chair or be nervous see
[23:26] he's got somewhere he can punch you
[23:29] it's got a right to do that
[23:32] open place now that's the spot
[23:36] you got to keep covered all the time to
[23:39] see
[23:40] this nervous age that we are living in
[23:44] we still have it right
[23:47] it can be mended
[23:50] he can access god in
[23:54] some ways because it's so
[23:57] is spiritual things sometimes
[24:00] we try to use human words it doesn't
[24:03] always work
[24:05] but he has some access it can do that
[24:07] but you don't have to take it
[24:09] you can cry out to the lord yes
[24:13] that's what i wrote down actually you
[24:16] got the right to cry out to the lord
[24:19] he has the right to punch you
[24:22] but don't take it cover it
[24:25] all the time you know whatever you do
[24:30] amen i don't know if this is a box
[24:33] or karate or what
[24:36] it's a spiritual battle actually i heard
[24:39] a preacher
[24:40] he came to the pulpit he preached about
[24:43] the battle and
[24:44] it was all karate i never heard such
[24:47] violence on the puppet but it was so
[24:50] great
[24:51] it was amazing
[24:59] revelation chapter 12
[25:02] verse 10 and i heard
[25:05] a loud voice saying in heaven
[25:09] now is come salvation strength and the
[25:12] kingdom of our god
[25:14] and the power of is christ
[25:17] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[25:20] down which accused them before our
[25:24] god day and night oh
[25:28] it has access but it's not the same
[25:31] access it used to have it had
[25:35] reason to accuse us because we did not
[25:39] have the
[25:40] full world is that right so during the
[25:43] ages
[25:44] it could accuse us through luther
[25:47] because we did not have the word the
[25:50] full word it could accuse us through
[25:54] wesley
[25:54] could accuse us through the pentecostal
[26:00] but now the fullness of the world has
[26:03] come
[26:05] who will accuse us of sin
[26:08] who can accuse jesus say
[26:12] who which of you actually read it john
[26:15] 8 which uh john 8 46
[26:19] which of you convinced me of sin who
[26:22] can say the word who can
[26:25] say the word has failed to do what he
[26:28] promised to do
[26:30] who can condemn the word
[26:35] therefore if you are the word how can
[26:39] satan condemn you how can he
[26:42] go and accuse you amen
[26:47] he can't the only thing he can do
[26:50] is when we make mistakes remember we
[26:53] don't sin
[26:55] sin is unbelief the fullness of the word
[26:58] has come
[26:59] there is no sin on earth there are
[27:03] people that don't have sins
[27:05] and i'm looking at them oh
[27:08] praise god amen
[27:12] religious huh that's what brother
[27:13] burnham say i feel like
[27:15] religious now my my my
[27:19] people that don't have any sin
[27:24] so therefore satan has some sort of
[27:26] access today
[27:27] which i don't know what does he say is
[27:30] just say
[27:31] oh that's not fair
[27:35] you know there's no fear like
[27:38] a young you know some young teenagers
[27:43] that's not fair only my sis only me
[27:47] i have to do the dishes and my sister
[27:49] doesn't do anything that's not fair
[27:53] sorry young young people soon
[28:00] the accuser has nothing
[28:03] he has nothing
[28:06] it has nothing on you
[28:10] all right god send him to kind of
[28:13] sometimes twist our hand you know give
[28:16] us a stimulation of our posteriors
[28:19] when we do something wrong but we can't
[28:22] sing
[28:24] so but we still have access to
[28:27] uh actually ask for is right
[28:32] and but my my uh
[28:35] purpose is to sh was to show you there
[28:38] is
[28:38] more than just having this
[28:42] access you just being said
[28:46] the angel of the lord like gabriel
[28:50] like the angel that came to talk to
[28:52] brother bennett
[28:53] they had something more than that
[28:57] amen but satan is work is
[29:02] to torment to give you
[29:06] hard time to attack your body
[29:10] to attack your mind
[29:15] but he cannot access your soul
[29:19] that's why all its effort his effort
[29:22] is to when he determines you is not
[29:26] really for your body you
[29:27] suffering you crying you don't
[29:30] understand what is going on
[29:32] but the reality is you want to reach
[29:35] your
[29:36] soul so you can you can
[29:39] reject the word of god but how can the
[29:42] word
[29:42] reject the word
[29:46] is a lost battle
[29:54] we we we just won uh
[29:57] a battle just to come you know
[30:00] to come to church another day
[30:04] and sunday i will see you oh my
[30:07] it it has lost the bottle
[30:11] all his effort is to get to your soul
[30:15] but your soul has god it has a seed of
[30:18] god
[30:19] is the word i cannot reach so is
[30:23] he has all these things but it takes
[30:27] more than just that
[30:30] accessing god
[30:34] asking god that's why my friend
[30:38] pentecostals really
[30:41] you miss something because sometimes
[30:44] they just think because we pray because
[30:46] we pray
[30:47] we spend nine days in church
[30:51] we pray you pray and remember
[30:54] satan praise too he goes to god
[30:58] baby asks and that's prayer
[31:03] he was a cherubim he knew adora
[31:07] he knows adoration he knows to worship
[31:12] he doesn't make it great what makes you
[31:15] great
[31:16] is the nature of god amen
[31:20] now the this let me take john chapter 8
[31:24] verse 44.
[31:31] this is the difference between these the
[31:33] the angels
[31:35] between the people those who come from
[31:39] sent from the presence of god
[31:42] and the other group you see in john 8
[31:46] 4 44 he say
[31:49] ye are of your father the devil
[31:52] and the lust of your father he will do
[31:56] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[31:59] about
[32:00] not in the truth because there is
[32:03] no truth in him when
[32:06] he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[32:09] for he is a liar and the father of it
[32:14] you see jesus said
[32:18] he has no truth but what is the truth
[32:22] john 17 17 sanctify them through thy
[32:26] truth
[32:27] thy word is truth
[32:30] that other messenger
[32:34] has no truth has no word
[32:38] the angel the gabriel angel has the word
[32:42] is the word is made of the same material
[32:46] as
[32:47] god if you take a spiritual
[32:50] tools and put on him you will see some
[32:53] god's dna inside actually god is just
[32:58] wrapping himself with that angel
[33:03] amen you agree with me
[33:13] an exposition of the seven church ages
[33:18] uh speaking about the two books
[33:22] genesis and revelation he says satan
[33:27] hates to be exposed and in those books
[33:31] is exposed for exactly what he is
[33:35] jesus said about satan he has no part in
[33:38] me
[33:39] and i have no part in him
[33:43] the other angels have part with
[33:46] god amen god made
[33:49] of the word they ha they are the word
[33:54] they have a portion of god in them
[33:59] but the demons don't have the other
[34:01] children don't have the other seed
[34:04] doesn't have are you with me
[34:10] the devil would like to prove that
[34:12] different but he cannot so
[34:15] he does all he can to destroy confidence
[34:18] in the world but when the church
[34:20] disbelieves
[34:21] satan and believes the spirit of spirit
[34:25] revelation of the world the gates of
[34:27] hell cannot prevail against it
[34:31] amen impossible
[34:34] it cannot prevail against her
[34:39] my my now have you noticed
[34:42] what i put in color there if you can see
[34:46] it he has no part
[34:49] but i'm saying jesus say about satan he
[34:52] has no part
[34:53] in me and i have no part
[34:56] in him if you look at that scripture it
[35:01] does not
[35:02] exist so
[35:05] intellectual believers have a problem
[35:09] so if you find it like tell me come show
[35:12] me
[35:13] in the bible it has no part in me
[35:16] and i have no part in him i could not
[35:19] find it
[35:20] maybe there is you show me
[35:24] after the service yeah
[35:27] so but as
[35:30] our pastor says a prophet
[35:33] can take a word here
[35:37] and a word there put it together change
[35:40] a little bit
[35:41] because it's a revealer of the spoken
[35:44] word
[35:47] is so free the word has a spirit
[35:51] in the holy spirit and the prophet is
[35:55] made to be the one who reveal you what
[35:59] is written
[36:01] i could not find it i went around the
[36:04] search you know
[36:06] these days you can search anything
[36:09] i could not find it
[36:12] but barbara found it in the bible
[36:16] the satan has no path in me
[36:19] and i have no part in him
[36:23] there is no association nothing in
[36:26] common
[36:27] between this two seed the seed of god
[36:31] and the seed of satan
[36:33] is no connect nothing in common
[36:38] and i say well i i just say a
[36:41] must have found it here when peter
[36:44] is saying to jesus john chapter 13
[36:48] 8 that you should not wash my hand my
[36:51] feet or and jesus said if i don't
[36:54] wash you you have no part with me
[36:58] all right peter what are you talking
[37:01] about
[37:02] you know you want to break the harmony
[37:05] of the scriptures
[37:07] you know you are part of me
[37:10] if i don't watch you if the word if you
[37:13] don't allow
[37:14] the word to wash you
[37:18] how can i have part of you is like you
[37:20] making a statement
[37:23] that the word should not wash you and
[37:26] you know well you know
[37:28] better peter all right
[37:31] you have power with me but there is one
[37:34] that does not
[37:34] have power with me john 14 30.
[37:39] hereafter i will not talk much with you
[37:43] for the prince of this world cometh and
[37:46] had nothing in me that's it
[37:50] nothing means no pot there is no portion
[37:53] of god in him there's nothing in common
[37:57] and that's the difference one can
[38:00] pretend i
[38:01] come from the presence of god but
[38:04] that's not the presence of god we're
[38:06] talking about that's not the presence of
[38:09] god we are concerned of
[38:12] amen those who come from the present the
[38:17] real presence of god
[38:20] god wraps himself inside them
[38:25] that's the difference they have these
[38:29] portions those portions
[38:32] my my my we can give them names we can
[38:35] call them
[38:36] attributes i did not just want to use
[38:38] the word attribute
[38:43] for a change
[38:52] exodus chapter 3 verse 2
[38:58] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[39:00] him
[39:01] in a flame of fire out of the midst
[39:05] of a bush and he looked and behold the
[39:09] bush burned
[39:10] fire and the bush was not consumed
[39:17] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[39:21] see this great site why the bush isn't
[39:25] burned is not burned and when the lord
[39:29] saw that he turned aside to see
[39:32] god called unto him out of
[39:35] the midst of the bush and say moses
[39:39] moses and he say here am i
[39:43] i wanna i highlighted two
[39:47] places there it was
[39:51] and the angel of the lord appeared is
[39:54] that right
[39:57] and then moses went to see what was
[40:00] burning not consuming
[40:04] and verse 4 is no longer the angel of
[40:07] the lord
[40:09] and when the lord was it
[40:13] the angel or it was the lord
[40:17] the mingo at one point we will not
[40:22] know if it was the angel or it was the
[40:26] lord
[40:26] and because the same material
[40:31] a child of god is god
[40:36] to whom the word of god came to are
[40:39] called
[40:39] god look a god walking
[40:46] that's too presumptuous brother kadima
[40:49] you have to be humble
[40:52] that's not me i did not write the word
[40:57] he say that yes
[41:02] amen no
[41:06] what makes this angel great is is an
[41:09] attribute of god it has a portion of god
[41:13] in him what you call faith
[41:17] is a portion of god in you
[41:21] right is made of the same material
[41:25] if you take that x-ray spiritual x-ray
[41:29] you see god bones
[41:34] is the word the god is the word you are
[41:37] the word
[41:39] that's the difference
[41:44] you say brother brother are you talking
[41:46] about the angel no i'm talking about you
[41:49] all this i'm bringing back to you
[41:52] we are the end of the shadows and types
[41:56] it's all about today
[41:59] it's all about now
[42:02] you know i used to tell my children
[42:05] stories
[42:06] sometimes i had to change it in the
[42:08] middle
[42:10] you know because it was so scary
[42:14] you know but the children always want to
[42:18] know the end of the story how did he end
[42:21] and we have come to that point
[42:24] the end of the story
[42:28] oh yeah what did i do
[42:31] there are many people that could see
[42:33] this time
[42:34] i saw it yet the devil is telling me i'm
[42:37] a miserable person
[42:38] he tells you the same thing
[42:42] one devil calls another devil
[42:45] they communicate put mind in you
[42:48] yeah yes
[42:53] it's really tormented
[42:57] yeah he doesn't like this word
[43:01] i hear brother ben i'm saying that i
[43:03] went to the pulpit before i go to the
[43:05] puppet my mind went blank
[43:08] what was it attack because he knows
[43:11] that word that comes he has the power
[43:14] of delivery he will do any
[43:18] anything
[43:22] if he attacks us preachers
[43:26] sometimes we come to help but a child
[43:28] when he's not
[43:29] around what about the pastor himself
[43:32] day in day out preaching this word
[43:36] my mind we need
[43:40] prayer warriors absolutely
[43:45] and thank you those who told me they
[43:48] were praying for me yes
[43:49] absolutely we need that
[43:55] yes we need to pray more
[43:58] you know sometimes you you see brother
[44:01] ben say
[44:02] people were fasting praying that's why
[44:05] my my meetings have success
[44:09] some people are praying and we are in
[44:11] that time
[44:13] there's so much evil spirit
[44:17] that just came because they have the
[44:20] right
[44:22] you know they were on the euphrates
[44:25] river now if they were given the right
[44:29] to come
[44:30] to attack they start with the
[44:33] jewish people but now they come against
[44:37] the
[44:37] bride and the biggest battle is
[44:40] in here you know heads

[49:42] crowd

[50:10] angel came to speak to you
[50:12] from the presence of god amen to tell
[50:16] you the mystery of your life
[50:19] you are drawing up something that is an
[50:23] image there is a pattern that you are
[50:25] following
[50:26] you don't understand that but your faith
[50:29] your faith which is a
[50:30] dimension of god a portion of god you
[50:33] can't understand it it

[51:08] to preach
[51:11] and if we cannot preach on the pulpit we
[51:14] can live it
[51:16] god help us
[51:24] and one day it flashed before you
[51:28] you seen jesus christ the same yesterday
[51:31] today and forever
[51:32] that satisfied the test the taste
[51:36] see cause life was in you
[51:40] drawing see the life in you is drawing
[51:44] it's telling what desire you got here
[51:47] you're pulling you can't pull
[51:50] through this and that and the other
[51:53] you've got to find that
[51:54] right filter because you are a
[51:58] thinking person see
[52:01] that's what the the angel comes to talk
[52:04] to tell you
[52:07] god is rich in mercy many of you
[52:11] can fellowship with me on this thought
[52:14] when you were
[52:15] it was a little boy or a little girl you
[52:18] would walk around and
[52:20] there would be certain things that would
[52:22] just
[52:23] where it would not bother
[52:26] the other kids it seemed like there was
[52:30] something in you that cried out
[52:33] there was god somewhere yet you were a
[52:37] sinner you remember that
[52:40] and the congregation says amen
[52:43] certainly now what was that that was
[52:47] a little form of life in youth amen
[52:52] amen
[52:55] and then after a while you heard the
[52:58] gospel
[52:59] maybe you went to church you picked up
[53:02] you pick out you picked out this and
[53:04] that
[53:06] picked up this that some of the things
[53:09] you picked up
[53:10] you regret them now right yeah and went
[53:14] from denomination to denomination
[53:16] but one day you being part of god
[53:20] that's the difference part of god you
[53:23] had to
[53:24] be part of the world
[53:27] and when you heard the world you know
[53:30] where you
[53:30] come from you knew you knew
[53:34] what was the truth you know where you
[53:36] come from you know where you are and
[53:38] where you're going back
[53:42] you were always the seed was in you
[53:46] always the word seen the word that was
[53:48] in you
[53:49] that was before the foundation of the
[53:51] world
[53:52] saw the word and you came to it you saw
[53:57] the word
[53:57] and you come to it you had
[54:01] no choice but
[54:05] go back to what you are yes
[54:09] yes so
[54:13] our lives are drawing something drawing
[54:16] up something
[54:18] they draw a pattern
[54:21] there is a pattern some of the things we
[54:24] don't understand them
[54:26] maybe we will not understand them here
[54:29] but we do
[54:30] it's writing there is a writing what we
[54:34] do where we go
[54:35] the steps of righteousness are led by
[54:38] this
[54:39] by god yeah there's nothing that's come
[54:42] by luck
[54:43] there is you are you are here to play a
[54:48] role
[54:48] in satan cannot even access you
[54:52] until you're done oh my
[54:58] and i can see brother branham when
[55:01] he was here he was drawing up something
[55:05] he was writing a
[55:07] symphony his life was a symphony even
[55:10] though he could not understand that
[55:11] music
[55:12] musicians but
[55:16] he was writing the symphony
[55:19] at the end he got a play at the end
[55:24] he has a ministry that brings back jesus
[55:27] christ again
[55:31] the head and the body together
[55:34] that was his ministry and every time he
[55:37] was working he was working toward that
[55:39] purpose
[55:40] something he did not know how he's going
[55:42] to come
[55:43] and a portion of him something inside
[55:47] knew and then when the
[55:50] picture was almost done when the image
[55:53] was
[55:54] about right
[55:58] satan felt that something is about to
[56:00] happen
[56:02] that was in 1962
[56:05] 1963
[56:08] the purpose of his ministry was about
[56:13] to be fulfilled the image will be now
[56:17] clear you can see him now
[56:20] at that time 1962 all
[56:23] hell broke loose
[56:28] maybe we are living the same thing
[56:34] amen we because we are
[56:38] already in the beginning in the end
[56:43] the in the beginning of the end
[56:46] the ushering in of everything
[56:52] all right you know when the wedding
[56:56] starts
[56:57] you start ushering people in the room
[57:00] is it the wedding yes it's the waiting
[57:02] is not there waiting
[57:03] because the bride is not here yet but
[57:06] it's the waiting because
[57:08] it's already ushered it's already in a
[57:11] process
[57:15] but the image maybe the lord is keeping
[57:18] us because the image is not full yet
[57:21] we have not fulfilled a part yet
[57:24] completely so that's why we eat
[57:27] the food every day and pray and cry out
[57:31] to him
[57:38] now 1962
[57:46] all had brock lewis
[57:51] a gun exposed on william branham
[57:55] to kill him physically
[57:58] it was too much for the satan to take
[58:02] people start leaving him some say that
[58:06] his ministry was over and the pressure
[58:10] built
[58:11] up pressure built up but his
[58:14] fate could travel between
[58:18] 1962 and 1963
[58:21] how can you say that yeah yeah yeah but
[58:24] the faith
[58:25] is a portion of god it could
[58:28] he knew something tremendous is coming
[58:32] it could not tell you for sure what how
[58:35] is going to
[58:36] be by the portion of
[58:39] god in him so something is about to
[58:42] happen
[58:50] yeah you know
[58:54] that portion do you know that sometimes
[58:57] brother brenham went to pray for a sick
[58:59] person
[59:01] you get in a house
[59:04] he sees his own body on the roof
[59:09] he sees himself on the roof and looking
[59:12] at
[59:12] his body laying hands on the person
[59:17] where is brother burnham the one laying
[59:21] hands
[59:22] on the sick or the one who's up there
[59:24] looking at his
[59:25] what is he looking at

[1:00:43] to be clear don't you think
[1:00:46] hall hell can break or lose
[1:00:51] does he explain why there's so many
[1:00:54] things among
[1:00:57] our community a lot of things
[1:01:01] among the believers a lot of things
[1:01:05] because at this time brother branham
[1:01:07] start also
[1:01:11] put in like foundation seed
[1:01:15] in 1962 he knew something is about to
[1:01:19] happen
[1:01:20] he said listen we need messages
[1:01:24] message churches get some young people
[1:01:28] help them teach them send them in
[1:01:31] missions
[1:01:33] then you tell the people
[1:01:36] wait i don't know the man i will just do
[1:01:39] a disclaimer i don't know him i don't
[1:01:41] know his family i don't know
[1:01:43] how his life ended he said
[1:01:47] joseph bosey
[1:01:51] you know is a good man
[1:01:55] but let me tell you jose
[1:01:58] joseph bosa does not believe the message
[1:02:06] we need to start message churches
[1:02:09] joseph bozey he always yo
[1:02:12] he he gave brother branham to preach
[1:02:15] many many times is it the history
[1:02:20] repeating itself
[1:02:23] that you can have somebody that
[1:02:25] everybody say
[1:02:26] is a message believer the message
[1:02:28] believer
[1:02:29] and brother but i'm saying
[1:02:32] it's not
[1:02:37] it's not a pleasure it's sad
[1:02:41] but it's reality yeah
[1:02:50] 1962 this seed is planted
[1:02:56] the head is coming in 1963.
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:05] start the message churches
[1:03:10] we need a place where the message is
[1:03:12] being preached
[1:03:15] truly preached
[1:03:20] verbum start talking about these things
[1:03:24] taking side with jesus
[1:03:28] but he also after the gun exposed
[1:03:35] when the gun explodes
[1:03:38] barbarians start talking about the
[1:03:40] pressure
[1:03:41] among the people have you noticed
[1:03:47] but everyone start talking about even
[1:03:49] mental sickness
[1:03:53] and you will think that it happens only
[1:03:56] outside
[1:03:58] no it happens among the believers
[1:04:03] we are not spared because the devil has
[1:04:06] a punch
[1:04:08] but we don't have to take it
[1:04:15] mental sickness
[1:04:18] if you have noticed um the preachers
[1:04:21] that came
[1:04:22] here before me they all
[1:04:26] spoke about mental condition
[1:04:29] if you have notice
[1:04:33] is something that is not sparing
[1:04:36] anyone but we can't have it
[1:04:40] covered that's what we read
[1:04:45] and verb say don't say i don't have a
[1:04:48] sickness if you have it if you have
[1:04:50] you are diagnostic
[1:04:53] you have it but say god
[1:04:57] is greater than my sickness amen
[1:05:02] all kind of them
[1:05:05] some you have to take medicine
[1:05:10] and it has a side effect depression
[1:05:13] anxiety this and that
[1:05:17] bipolar a sister called me few
[1:05:21] not too long ago my
[1:05:24] my daughter-in-law has bipala and she's
[1:05:28] doing this
[1:05:29] and two days or two three days later
[1:05:33] her own daughter also has the same
[1:05:36] insane symptoms
[1:05:39] a minister told me his wife has
[1:05:42] she's so friendlier
[1:05:46] this is not to discourage anyone
[1:05:50] this is a reality
[1:05:55] it happens but we don't have to take it
[1:06:02] amen
[1:06:04] how can i overcome 1963
[1:06:09] and you know that he's a devil you can't
[1:06:12] say
[1:06:13] i got a sickness i don't believe
[1:06:16] it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness
[1:06:20] you got cancer you you don't believe
[1:06:24] is a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer
[1:06:28] but remember greater is he that is in
[1:06:31] you
[1:06:31] than he that is in the world you must
[1:06:34] realize the holy ghost that is in you
[1:06:37] has already overcome this thing
[1:06:40] he is in you and you can overcome by him
[1:06:44] that exactly sensible it's exactly the
[1:06:47] way this
[1:06:48] scripture is written all the time
[1:06:56] that he that is in you say almost the
[1:06:58] same thing
[1:07:00] greater is he that isn't you that the
[1:07:03] wheelchair
[1:07:04] greta is he that is in you that that's a
[1:07:07] stretcher
[1:07:09] greater is he that is in you that that
[1:07:12] cancer greater is he that is in you
[1:07:16] that than that affliction no matter what
[1:07:19] that affliction
[1:07:20] is still degraded
[1:07:28] in the message letting off the pressure
[1:07:33] it's just to build up pressure it's the
[1:07:35] age
[1:07:36] that we are living in in neurotic age
[1:07:40] where people don't know what to do with
[1:07:43] where they are going and the doctors
[1:07:45] don't have
[1:07:46] the answer for it because the
[1:07:49] psychiatrist is
[1:07:50] being doctored by the psychiatrist
[1:07:53] so they have not the answer
[1:07:58] strange he say this i'm not talking
[1:08:02] about the regular doctors
[1:08:04] i'm talking psychiatrists they don't
[1:08:07] have
[1:08:08] the answer
[1:08:13] and if they don't have the answer that's
[1:08:15] a good thing
[1:08:16] because the answer is from the lord
[1:08:19] brother banham said
[1:08:20] before i bring my children to the doctor
[1:08:22] i pray for them
[1:08:24] then i bring them to the doctor and if
[1:08:26] the doctor cannot do anything
[1:08:28] i bring them a little higher
[1:08:36] but there's some answer surely
[1:08:39] somewhere we could deal on it for hours
[1:08:43] please brother branham deal with it
[1:08:46] for hours this is a very serious subject
[1:08:56] but i was just thinking that god has the
[1:08:58] answer
[1:08:59] if we could just sit in a place like
[1:09:01] this
[1:09:02] takes off the pressure with people who
[1:09:04] are
[1:09:05] entered into eternity
[1:09:08] we are not going into we are already in
[1:09:11] it
[1:09:12] that's right amen
[1:09:15] some sickness some of these conditions
[1:09:20] they happen everywhere
[1:09:23] they affect families
[1:09:28] but there is an answer in christ
[1:09:32] we really need to be prayer warriors
[1:09:37] that sounds like uh the basic message
[1:09:40] tonight but it's so true
[1:09:44] and if you watch closely all these
[1:09:46] preachers have talked about it talk
[1:09:48] about it
[1:09:49] and it was like we talked together no
[1:09:53] some sickness the doctors don't
[1:09:55] understand they don't even
[1:09:57] want to qualify them as sickness
[1:10:00] borderline personality
[1:10:03] grandiose narcissist narcissism
[1:10:09] some are grandiose some are vulnerable
[1:10:13] we know more about grain grandiose
[1:10:16] people
[1:10:17] grandiose narcissists that say i'm this
[1:10:20] i'm that
[1:10:20] but they are also the vulnerable they
[1:10:22] are always a victim
[1:10:24] victim and the doctors don't know
[1:10:28] especially this one's narcissism
[1:10:31] the doctor sometimes the therapist
[1:10:33] doesn't know because
[1:10:34] the logic the person who's suffering
[1:10:38] this is illogical you know
[1:10:41] it can even charm the therapist
[1:10:45] you know it can confuse them
[1:10:48] and some of them say this is not even a
[1:10:51] sickness
[1:10:51] because these people don't suffer
[1:10:54] because
[1:10:54] we treat people that suffer but yet
[1:10:59] people around them people around the
[1:11:02] narcissists
[1:11:04] people around them suffer because they
[1:11:08] the environment that they create is
[1:11:11] toxic
[1:11:12] imagine a believer that is the family
[1:11:17] for example where the parents are
[1:11:19] narcissistic
[1:11:21] it's awful and it happens
[1:11:27] maybe it's a time where we expose all
[1:11:30] demons but i tell you spending time well
[1:11:35] three more preachers but a kyle preach
[1:11:38] talk about that
[1:11:41] brother steve brother nathanael
[1:11:45] they all talk about it and the pastor
[1:11:48] talks about it every sunday
[1:11:52] almost
[1:11:54] yes
[1:11:57] but the prophets say that uh we you
[1:12:00] don't
[1:12:01] the doctors don't know they say well how
[1:12:04] can you say a narcissist
[1:12:06] is sick it feels so good it feels like
[1:12:10] i'm power
[1:12:11] you know how can you say is a sickness
[1:12:13] it's a sickness
[1:12:14] for those around them and some will
[1:12:18] leave the word the message and go in the
[1:12:21] world because
[1:12:22] my parents are narcissistic
[1:12:26] they do both lines all that
[1:12:31] the plagues in the world oh
[1:12:34] god it will be great that
[1:12:37] that is not even said among
[1:12:41] us it will be wonderful that if you a
[1:12:44] message believe it those things don't
[1:12:46] happen
[1:12:46] no they can happen we have to hold the
[1:12:50] fire we have to pray we have
[1:12:53] you know to take care of a brother we
[1:12:55] are brothers keepers
[1:13:01] so many things happen
[1:13:08] we need people that pray not with
[1:13:12] selfishness but truly pray
[1:13:16] that's right i already pray no no
[1:13:19] need to pray one day i was walking
[1:13:22] and i had this message i was listening
[1:13:25] to it
[1:13:26] because i was listening to the series of
[1:13:29] 1962
[1:13:31] and there's something in this message
[1:13:34] be not afraid it is i in 62
[1:13:39] there is something or other about
[1:13:42] mankind and
[1:13:43] christians when they are assembled
[1:13:47] together in one accord and in fellowship
[1:13:50] they have things in common you can tell
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:54] they it's hard for them to part one from
[1:13:58] another and now this may be a little on
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] sideline now brother when i was about to
[1:14:06] open my eyes to something
[1:14:09] on the sideline it's going with the
[1:14:11] message like this
[1:14:12] you can see the past preaching you know
[1:14:14] the subject keep going
[1:14:16] at one point he deviate
[1:14:20] what is it he go pick up somebody on the
[1:14:22] sideline
[1:14:24] and he's talking to me i'm in the woods
[1:14:26] i'm walking sometime i can walk
[1:14:28] seven miles and listen to the message
[1:14:32] praying
[1:14:33] and he's talking to me this is the
[1:14:34] sideline for this person that is in the
[1:14:37] trail
[1:14:39] and now you say but many of you people
[1:14:42] have seen people that you just love to
[1:14:46] be
[1:14:46] in their presence and then you have seen
[1:14:49] people that
[1:14:49] you they were nice people but you could
[1:14:52] hardly stand to be in their presence
[1:14:55] see you are a creator of an atmosphere
[1:14:58] around you and you make that yourself by
[1:15:02] your
[1:15:03] own disposition and the spirit that is
[1:15:05] on
[1:15:06] inside of you
[1:15:09] i got it people that
[1:15:13] create a toxic environment
[1:15:16] is because of the spirit inside them
[1:15:21] but they can say no to it
[1:15:24] the demon can come but you can say
[1:15:29] no you have that right
[1:15:33] that's it
[1:15:36] and that's the problem because when
[1:15:39] you hear and you recognize
[1:15:43] you will act if you deny
[1:15:47] how can you act and that's the problem
[1:15:50] that brethren had in
[1:15:52] oregon i will read it and demonology
[1:15:55] uh 1953. he said
[1:15:58] the police say the man who came to beat
[1:16:02] up brother branham
[1:16:04] on the pulpit when brother cast out that
[1:16:07] demon
[1:16:08] the man fell and they say
[1:16:12] the police say is that man dead i say
[1:16:15] no sir say is he healed i say
[1:16:18] no sir he worships that spirit
[1:16:23] he'd bring it right back to him
[1:16:26] because he thinks is right he thinks is
[1:16:30] a
[1:16:30] is a protection for him to be strong
[1:16:34] and billion preachers he feels something
[1:16:37] and when the spirit went out
[1:16:41] when he wakes up he pick it up
[1:16:44] and go but it's our duty to pray for
[1:16:47] everyone
[1:16:50] but it's also the responsibility for the
[1:16:53] person to be
[1:16:54] willing
[1:16:58] and we always given that free moral
[1:17:01] agency
[1:17:03] it's true but god gave us the power
[1:17:08] to cast our demons that's very basic
[1:17:12] but that's true i say he's not here
[1:17:16] they roll him over i say get him off my
[1:17:19] feet he was scrambling me he was
[1:17:22] laying that big man on my feet
[1:17:26] i couldn't move my feet out of out and
[1:17:29] both of them together and i couldn't
[1:17:32] move my feet out and they
[1:17:34] rolled him over and i i took my feet
[1:17:37] away and
[1:17:38] went on to you know
[1:17:41] so yeah
[1:17:46] brother branham spoke more
[1:17:50] about the pressure that comes in people
[1:17:54] in 1962 pressure come on him
[1:17:57] on his church rejection
[1:18:01] all kinds of things and he had to
[1:18:04] address it

[1:18:09] in
[1:18:10] god lab and what about you and i
[1:18:14] made of god's material god is speaking

[1:20:57] ah let me just finish with this
[1:21:00] luke chapter 7 verse 36
[1:21:05] and one of the pharisees desire him
[1:21:09] that he would eat with him and he went
[1:21:12] into the pharisees house and sat down
[1:21:16] to meet and behold a woman
[1:21:19] in the city which was a sinner when she
[1:21:22] knew that jesus sat
[1:21:23] at meat in the pharisees house
[1:21:26] brought an albuster box of ointment
[1:21:31] verse 38 and stood at
[1:21:35] his feet behind him
[1:21:38] whipping and began to wash his feet with
[1:21:42] tears and did wipe them with the hairs
[1:21:45] of her head
[1:21:46] and kiss his feet and
[1:21:50] anointed them with the anoint ointment
[1:21:54] now when the pharisee which had beaten
[1:21:57] him so it respect with
[1:22:00] within himself saying this man if
[1:22:03] you were a prophet would have known
[1:22:07] who and what man of a woman this
[1:22:11] that touch him that she's a sinner
[1:22:15] oh my well
[1:22:18] have you noticed jesus was silent
[1:22:23] during all this time that this woman
[1:22:27] was doing this service
[1:22:31] he never said a word brother ben i'm
[1:22:33] saying
[1:22:36] you know she was doing the right thing
[1:22:42] jesus was rejected by the pharisees who
[1:22:46] invited him
[1:22:49] we believe the message but he rejected
[1:22:53] him
[1:22:54] this woman was with the rejected jesus
[1:23:00] he was smitten she was smitten
[1:23:04] remember brother emmanuel message he was
[1:23:07] rejected she was rejected
[1:23:13] the system was sitting here

[1:23:19] other side
[1:23:21] she was rejected she was
[1:23:24] called bad name he was called that name
[1:23:29] she was at the right place right time
[1:23:32] for fulfilling the purpose of her life
[1:23:41] she could say i come from the presence
[1:23:44] of god
[1:23:46] to fulfill the duty that god gave me
[1:23:49] serving the lord this is the time to
[1:23:53] serve him
