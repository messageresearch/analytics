[12:18] part three the finale of the Masterpiece
[12:21] amen we're going to go to prayer but
[12:23] just before we do I wanted to share a a
[12:25] testimony with you really quickly uh
[12:28] Sister Nancy marrow uh had went into the
[12:31] hospital Monday morning and over the
[12:33] weekend she had had um she was having
[12:36] some some problem and she didn't know
[12:38] what it was but she had a bad headache
[12:40] and she was becoming forgetful she was
[12:42] having trouble communicating and even
[12:44] sometimes she was having trouble finding
[12:45] the right word or she would say
[12:47] something totally out of context and use
[12:49] a word that was not fitting and so it
[12:52] wouldn't relent over the weekend so she
[12:54] went Monday morning and um at on initial
[12:58] testing they believe believe she had a
[12:59] stroke they were thinking many strokes
[13:01] and then they ruled that out and they
[13:03] said no it was a mild stroke but she
[13:05] called me this morning and she's going
[13:07] home she was supposed to be home this
[13:08] afternoon and she said the doctor after
[13:10] doing a bunch of uh uh digging he said
[13:13] she had a
[13:14] complex a complex
[13:17] migraine and that was it they gave her
[13:19] some medicine take care of migraine it
[13:20] went away and everything was fine no
[13:23] stroke no no long-term issue and she
[13:26] went home and she was happy and feeling
[13:28] good
[13:32] so we certainly thank God for that that
[13:35] was a good phone call I enjoyed hearing
[13:37] from her and she was bright and cheery
[13:38] on the phone and feeling so much better
[13:41] man you heard the prayer request for the
[13:43] Dean Hart family at the passing of
[13:45] sister Joanne and man she was 93 years
[13:48] old and we just want to continue to
[13:49] remember the family remember brother Bob
[13:51] I'm sure he'll be very lonesome and the
[13:54] family there but they're happy they're
[13:56] happy for her they're so thankful she
[13:58] got the cross on to her reward so we're
[14:00] thankful for that there was one more
[14:03] request I wanted to mention there was a
[14:04] prayer request entered in Wednesday for
[14:06] sister lorine Mau and sister Loren many
[14:09] of you don't know but she's been
[14:10] struggling with some health
[14:11] complications lately she had covid last
[14:14] year and pneumonia and when she came out
[14:16] of that she just she's had one issue
[14:19] after another since then and um they've
[14:23] uh she's had problems with her blood
[14:24] sugar they've uh been watching her
[14:26] kidney numbers her kidney numbers keep
[14:28] going lower and they they're talking to
[14:30] her about possible dialysis then there
[14:32] was something they found in the pancreas
[14:34] that they became suspicious of and they
[14:36] went to send her for testing and they
[14:38] begin to begin to be frightful like it
[14:40] was possible cancer and and so this past
[14:43] week all of those issues plus the care
[14:45] her mother needs and all these built up
[14:47] and uh emotionally she just collapsed
[14:50] under the pressure of that it become too
[14:51] much and U but she called me today and
[14:55] she says she is feeling so much better
[14:57] the prayers were answered she feels good
[15:00] she's got a positive outlook she's
[15:01] testifying of her healing and she knows
[15:04] the Lord will bring her out and heal her
[15:06] of all these things so I'd like for us
[15:08] to just agree together as a body that
[15:10] each one of these health issues will go
[15:12] away and that while she's dealing with
[15:14] them all and they're going away that God
[15:16] will strengthen her and and be her
[15:18] stability and her support that she'll
[15:20] know she's in his hand and she can never

[17:59] world we give you preeminence We Worship
[18:01] You Lord we ask that you would bless us
[18:04] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[18:07] amen and God bless you while we're
[18:09] standing let's take our Bibles and turn
[18:11] to Isaiah thank you musicians the Lord
[18:13] bless you we want to read our opening
[18:16] scripture again Isaiah 53 we want to
[18:18] keep it on the Forefront of our mind as
[18:20] we listen to this last section because
[18:22] brother B's going to refer to it again
[18:25] and it's going to be interesting the way
[18:26] he refers to the scripture
[18:29] so we want this
[18:30] to remain in our minds Isaiah
[18:37] 53:1 who hath believed our report and to
[18:39] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[18:42] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[18:44] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[18:47] has no form nor comeliness and when we
[18:49] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[18:51] should desire him he is despised and
[18:54] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[18:56] acquainted with grief and and we hid as
[18:58] it were our faces from him he was
[19:00] despised and we esteemed him not surely
[19:03] he ha borne our griefs and carried our
[19:05] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[19:08] smitten of God and Afflicted but he was
[19:11] wounded for our transgressions he was
[19:13] bruised for our iniquities the
[19:15] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[19:17] and with his stripes we are healed all
[19:20] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[19:22] turned everyone to his own way and the
[19:24] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[19:26] all he was oppressed
[19:28] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[19:30] his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the
[19:32] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[19:34] shears is dumb so he openeth not his
[19:36] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[19:39] judgment and who shall declare his
[19:41] generation for he was cut off out of the
[19:43] land of the living for the transgression
[19:45] of my people was he stricken and he made
[19:48] his grave with the wicked and with the
[19:50] rich in death because he had done no
[19:52] violence neither was any deceit in his
[19:54] mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[19:57] him he hath put Heath put him to grief
[20:00] when thou shalt make his soul an
[20:02] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[20:04] he shall prolong his days and the
[20:06] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[20:07] his hand he shall see the the travail of
[20:11] his soul and shall be satisfied by his
[20:13] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[20:15] justify many for he shall bear their
[20:17] iniquities therefore will I divide him a
[20:20] portion with the great and he shall
[20:21] divide the spoil with the strong because
[20:24] Heath poured out his soul into death and
[20:26] he was numbered with the transgressors
[20:28] and he bare the sins of many and made
[20:30] intercession for the
[20:32] transgressors praise God Amen God bless
[20:35] you as your seated as brother brandom
[20:38] said what a what a what an interesting
[20:40] scripture to read for the subject of
[20:42] Masterpiece
[20:45] amen praise the Lord Let's uh if we
[20:48] could pull up the PowerPoint brother
[20:49] Franco for the questions first I want to
[20:52] do a quick review if you could go with
[20:54] me in the book The
[20:56] Masterpiece and let's go to paragraph 37
[21:00] on page
[21:02] 8 and I just want to do a quick review
[21:05] to remind us of what uh what we've been
[21:07] looking at as we go into this last part
[21:10] so on page 8 down towards the bottom in
[21:12] paragraph 37 we'll read just a few
[21:15] Snippets out of here and then when it
[21:18] was completed this is where he's talking
[21:20] about Michelangelo working on the statue
[21:22] of Moses then when it was completed he
[21:24] stood back with the hammer the
[21:26] sculptor's hammer in his hand and he
[21:28] looked at that monument and the
[21:29] inspiration of the vision that he had
[21:31] seen of how to do it inspired him so
[21:33] much till the inspiration struck him
[21:35] till he got beside himself and he struck
[21:37] it across the knee and he said speak now
[21:40] there's a flaw on the great image on the
[21:42] knee on the right knee just above the
[21:44] knee about 6 Ines as a place I put my
[21:46] hand on it about that deep after he had
[21:49] spent all that time for years and years
[21:51] to make this then under the influence of
[21:53] seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his
[21:55] heart and in his vision and desired to
[21:58] see it was completed and when it was
[22:00] completed he was so inspired by it till
[22:02] he thought his his own Masterpiece
[22:04] should speak back to him and he struck
[22:06] it across the leg and holler speak and
[22:08] it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on
[22:11] the image to me the flaw was what made
[22:14] it the Masterpiece now maybe to the mind
[22:17] that might think different you might you
[22:19] think that spoiled it no to me it made
[22:22] it what it was because after so many
[22:24] years of careful work and toils and
[22:26] inspiration and so forth of making his
[22:28] toil had proved not in vain it was
[22:30] perfect and that's why he cried out
[22:33] speak now let's go to paragraph 44 down
[22:37] here at the bottom now let us turn the
[22:40] page of Michelangelo and close the book
[22:42] and let's open another book and read of
[22:44] the great sculptor the almighty who
[22:46] before there was a world and before the
[22:48] foundations was laid he had in his mind
[22:50] what he wanted and he wanted to make man
[22:52] in his own image he wanted to make
[22:54] something in reality of what was a
[22:56] vision to him what was in his thinking
[22:59] now let's turn the page and go to
[23:01] paragraph 47 in the middle of page
[23:04] 10 paragraph 47 but finally there came
[23:07] forth upon the earth a Perfection and
[23:10] that was a man and then he could see in
[23:12] the man that it looked like him so now
[23:15] when he looked upon him he was a
[23:16] reflection of what his creator was God
[23:19] now God had now been able to achieve the
[23:22] thing he wanted a man in his own image
[23:24] and then I might say to this that when
[23:26] he made this man there was something
[23:28] about him yet that didn't look just
[23:30] right because that he was by himself and
[23:33] that's how God had been by himself he
[23:35] was the Eternal and man now in the image
[23:37] of God also existed on the Earth by
[23:40] himself so he must have struck a little
[23:42] blow over on his left side and from
[23:44] there he took the piece that struck off
[23:46] of it and made him a help meate a wife
[23:49] then he wasn't by himself he was he had
[23:52] somebody with him and that's his great
[23:55] work let's go to paragraph 52 on the
[23:57] next page page 11 now remember that my
[24:01] opinion the Masterpiece is the stroke
[24:04] that marred St Angelo's Masterpiece in
[24:06] the monument and it was the stroke that
[24:08] cut the side of his Masterpiece that
[24:10] brought out the bride and now we see him
[24:12] as a masterpiece family in the Garden of
[24:14] Eden how beautiful it was and it so
[24:17] pleased him till he took rest then he
[24:19] said I'll rest next paragraph and but
[24:22] while he was resting and trusting in his
[24:24] Masterpiece his enemy came in and found
[24:27] his Great Master piece and he by deceit
[24:29] he crawls under the garden walls and
[24:31] then he marred this beautiful
[24:33] Masterpiece he marred it so that it fell
[24:36] let's go down to the last paragraph
[24:37] paragraph
[24:39] 56 but the great sculptor when he seen
[24:41] the fall of his family the Masterpiece
[24:43] he wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[24:45] there face down in ruin he went to work
[24:48] immediately to build it up again he
[24:50] wasn't willing it should perish lay
[24:51] there like that all the time because he
[24:53] is God and he will not be defeated so he
[24:56] went to work immediately and began to
[24:58] build again unto his own image a man now
[25:01] let's go to page 70 or paragraph 70 on
[25:05] page
[25:07] 14 page 14 right at the top paragraph
[25:10] 70 all the prophets had flaws all the
[25:13] ones was a portion but here at last
[25:16] coming up through that finally comes the
[25:18] Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in
[25:20] him at all so perfect reflected of the
[25:23] Builder himself his own image was
[25:25] reflected in his work God and Christ
[25:27] were one in so much until he put his own
[25:30] Spirit into him and then even the image
[25:32] of the Builder became the image and the
[25:35] Builder became one God in his sculpture
[25:37] work his Masterpiece Moses was in the
[25:40] work of St Angelo or Michelangelo rather
[25:43] was a sculpture work that was dead
[25:45] because it had been made of stone but
[25:47] here the master builder when he got his
[25:49] handiwork perfected he stepped into it
[25:52] now let's go to paragraph 75 on the next
[25:56] page remember Angelo could only cry out
[25:59] Smite the image and say speak but how
[26:01] differently it was to God the great
[26:03] sculptor when he made a man in his own
[26:05] image so perfect that it reflected him
[26:07] God spoke through the image of man
[26:09] showing what he would do he spoke
[26:11] through the prophets as they were in
[26:12] their potential image as he was bringing
[26:14] it up to the head but when he come to
[26:17] the head he was all the image of God he
[26:19] was portraying himself then smitten for
[26:22] us now he's the Masterpiece to us the
[26:24] gift of God Jesus Christ eternal life I
[26:27] hope we never never forget that now
[26:29] let's go over to paragraph 108 on page
[26:33] 21 page
[26:36] 21 towards the top of the page paragraph
[26:41] 108 now for nearly 2,000 years God has
[26:45] been making him a masterpiece because he
[26:47] struck Adam to get a piece off of him
[26:50] part of him a rib to make a wife for him
[26:52] and now that perfect Masterpiece that he
[26:54] struck at Calvary he got a piece off of
[26:56] him it's just the New Testament that's
[26:58] all he fulfilled the Old Testament now
[27:00] it's the New Testament another piece to
[27:02] be fulfilled see the new and old is
[27:04] husband and wife and it taken the new or
[27:07] the old to foreshadow the new Christ
[27:10] come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now
[27:13] his bride will fulfill everything that's
[27:15] in the New Testament another Masterpiece
[27:17] is in the making has it taken him 4,000
[27:20] years to make this masterpiece now he's
[27:23] been for nearly 2,000 years making
[27:25] another Masterpiece a bride for Christ
[27:27] another Masterpiece in so doing it he
[27:30] does it by his never changing method the
[27:32] same way he made the Masterpiece his
[27:34] word that's the way he makes his
[27:36] Masterpiece because he can only be a
[27:38] perfect Masterpiece when it's the
[27:40] perfect word praise God I enjoy the
[27:45] review amen all right let's go to the
[27:49] questions

[28:38] do so number two is what is God doing

[30:09] in the process of making a
[30:20] masterpiece these are fun
[30:23] ones I love finding the answers as we go
[30:26] through
[30:29] okay we are going to start on page
[30:31] 25 at the bottom of par uh page 25 we're
[30:35] going to begin at the beginning of

[30:57] brandom start to sing and he'll go to
[30:59] prayer and he'll finish with a song and
[31:02] I I love I think it's a privilege we get

[31:08] think that's a a a privilege that we get
[31:11] it's very it's Unique it's a blessing
[31:13] and we get the insight into his heart
[31:15] and his desire so we get to hear him

[31:26] love hearing your resp response to the
[31:27] word and don't forget when the word
[31:29] Pricks you respond to the word amen just
[31:31] because it's a tape doesn't mean we sit
[31:33] quiet we get into it amen the only way
[31:35] you can get anything out of anything is
[31:37] if you get into the spirit of it that's
[31:38] what brother B taught us we went through
[31:40] that in the church age book they get
[31:41] into the spirit of a ball game they get
[31:43] into the spirit of whatever they're
[31:44] doing and that's why they enjoy it if we
[31:47] don't get into the spirit of the word
[31:48] we're not going to enjoy it so we need
[31:50] to get into the atmosphere and into the
[31:52] spirit of it amen and respond to the
[31:54] word and and uh hear the prophet pray
[31:57] and sing along and worship God together
[32:01] and we can go ahead and go uh to the
[32:03] tape we're going to begin there
[32:04] paragraph
[32:10] 136 noce share the life that was in the
[32:14] husk in the stalk and in the tossel in
[32:17] the husk all gathers in the sea and the
[32:21] life that was in the stalk went one went
[32:25] to make the other
[32:28] justification made a way for
[32:30] sanctification sanctification made way
[32:33] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[32:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[32:38] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[32:40] in Perfection back to the word again the
[32:43] Manifest
[32:46] itself but what denominated
[32:50] dies like life and Luther went to make
[32:54] Wesley and and the from a Wesley it went
[32:57] to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make
[33:00] the original seed on to Pentecost comes
[33:03] out of the Wesley until that time the
[33:07] reason that Pentecost come out of Wesley
[33:09] because it was no denomination Pentecost
[33:11] was then Pentecost went to denominate
[33:14] and what did it do it turned to the husk
[33:17] it looked like the real
[33:19] thing and anybody how many ever seen a
[33:21] SE seed of wheat start to grow what's
[33:23] the first little thing it's just exact
[33:25] like the seed but it's a husk see the
[33:29] three stages
[33:30] stalk tsel or the pollen than the husk
[33:35] and then out of the husk Comes The
[33:37] Original
[33:39] Seed not a seed it was the life of the
[33:42] seed growing through
[33:44] this to come to the
[33:49] seed do you see it what is it a
[33:54] Resurrection coming back to a
[33:56] masterpiece again
[33:57] like the one that went in Pentecost came
[34:01] out of the Wesley because Wesley was an
[34:03] organization Pentecost come out as no
[34:05] organization then turned to one it had
[34:08] to to make the
[34:10] husk the True Word of Life on it was on
[34:14] its way then to the original grain
[34:18] through these stages through the stalk
[34:22] then into the pollen from the pollen
[34:24] into the husk and from the husk it made
[34:27] seed no stalk tosel hus
[34:31] living they produced in their early
[34:34] Revival a holder of a certain
[34:39] potion of the seed life but when they
[34:44] organized the life moved out of
[34:48] it that's Pro all
[34:51] history never an organization ever done
[34:53] a thing after organized it was dead
[34:57] that's right watch the life's traveling
[35:00] on now it's moving on notice what they
[35:04] have done all these have done is proved
[35:07] by history just exactly the way the
[35:09] church has come never to be useful to
[35:13] him
[35:15] again organization is laid on the Shelf
[35:17] there never has been in all the history
[35:20] a a church after it organized but what
[35:23] it
[35:24] died and the organis ation died and
[35:28] never did raise
[35:30] again can't you see men who are blind
[35:35] open your eyes nature and the word
[35:38] coordinating together and proving it
[35:41] right here that this is the
[35:44] truth that it is the truth that life
[35:48] leaves a stalk to make the tossle from
[35:50] the tossle it makes the husk and from
[35:52] the husk it goes into to the original
[35:56] yeah
[35:57] again notice never again to be useful to
[36:01] him how noticeable this life is in its
[36:05] travel in the corn of wheat than it is
[36:08] in the
[36:10] tree God called his people like a tree
[36:14] see the life goes down in a tree and
[36:17] comes back up again goes down and comes
[36:20] back up see it goes down and comes back
[36:23] up but in the corn of wheat it goes up
[36:27] from the original stalk to the
[36:30] stalk hostle and husk and the thing that
[36:34] it pass through die so it can't get back
[36:38] to it again what is it it's no use
[36:41] anymore it goes on to his
[36:44] Perfection amen don't you see why he
[36:48] never used an organization he can't get
[36:51] back in it again it's dead but the life
[36:55] passes on from one to the other
[36:59] Hallelujah see they put Creeds in inject
[37:02] whosoever shall add one word or take one
[37:04] word out see he's blocked off from it it
[37:08] must be the life seed traveling
[37:10] on I'm using this in a parable and now
[37:13] of the Bride the Masterpiece is coming
[37:16] forth as a masterpiece fell there's a
[37:19] masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell
[37:21] at pentac I see a room a ni after n i
[37:24] see a room she's come through a process
[37:26] but coming right back again so that
[37:29] Masterpiece
[37:29] [Music]
[37:31] perfected cuz she's a part of that word
[37:33] that was spoken by him he'll have a
[37:36] church without spotter wrinkle Lord
[37:39] it'll not be connected any way with any
[37:41] kind of an organization or denomination
[37:44] the cursed thing it's passed through
[37:46] those things but it'll never be there
[37:48] notice the seed is coming
[37:51] up life is coming up not going back
[37:54] there will be no more Resurrection after
[37:56] this
[37:57] amen the life is coming up to go to his
[38:00] Perfection a resurrection notice the
[38:03] husk put forth the uh the notice the
[38:07] husk puts the uh uh Original Seed out of
[38:13] itself in Revelations the thir chapter
[38:16] we find this now remember no other
[38:21] church was he put out
[38:23] of in the Bible of the Church ages how
[38:27] many remembers it he passed through the
[38:30] church age to go on to make something
[38:34] else but this is it there's nothing else
[38:39] but the the
[38:40] sculpture has got back to Perfection
[38:45] again the
[38:48] word see don't go back how different it
[38:52] is
[38:53] yes oh and notice then the the husk when
[38:57] he comes forth looks just like the green
[39:00] but when the green
[39:02] life begins to lead the husk to go into
[39:07] make the grain the
[39:10] bride the husk opens up and
[39:14] excommunicates the
[39:17] grain is that right nature that's
[39:21] exactly what she did in Ro in
[39:23] Revelations 3 we find out the lady is
[39:25] see a church h cut him
[39:28] out I see it didn't back in the other
[39:31] ages because there was something else
[39:32] yet to be made it just passed through
[39:35] and went on to another I've told you all
[39:37] along there's no more denominations
[39:38] coming we're at the
[39:41] end and they put him out because
[39:45] why he's the word
[39:48] again he's like the one that fell down
[39:50] there he's the same doctrine that come
[39:53] forth from the beginning and when the
[39:55] seed word begins to grow forth the husk
[39:58] putts it from itself the life leaves all
[40:01] the others to follow it that's the true
[40:04] believers they follow the life wherever
[40:06] the life go like in Israel a perfect
[40:08] type if we had time and just got a few
[40:09] minutes left but in the perfect type in
[40:12] the beginning everywhere that pillar
[40:14] fire went was life God was that life and
[40:17] I don't care if it's midnight or whether
[40:19] it's in a good selected place when that
[40:21] Pillar of Fire moved the trumpet sounded
[40:23] and Israel moved with it amen hallelujah
[40:27] and when the trumpet sounded Martin
[40:29] Luther moved out with it and he
[40:32] organized killed not he himself the man
[40:35] at him and then God took the life out of
[40:38] that brought it on laid it down the
[40:41] grave then out come Wesley he saw that
[40:44] big organization so he sounded a trumpet
[40:46] of sanctification more of the word hey
[40:49] when he did out they moved right out of
[40:52] right out of Luther right into me
[40:54] Methodist and when Pentecost start they
[40:57] sounded a trumpet it's time for the
[40:59] return of the gifts see what they did
[41:02] they sounded a trumpet and out they come
[41:03] then they
[41:05] organized but remember after the husk
[41:08] that's three stages we know of there's
[41:10] nothing else left but the grain oh
[41:14] God and then the green is put out of all
[41:16] of
[41:18] it amen and
[41:21] amen seed words begins to form itself
[41:25] life it's brought forth out of now
[41:28] notice if the
[41:31] bridegroom the beginning the first
[41:33] bridegroom this is a bride coming forth
[41:36] remember the church began at
[41:40] Pentecost and it fell at
[41:42] niia it sprouted not like the real green
[41:46] no it was some of the life in there but
[41:48] it sprouted in order to make an
[41:50] organization and it pulled through that
[41:53] organization and then what did it do
[41:55] then it went from that organization it
[41:57] went into another organization went into
[41:59] another stage of the word justification
[42:01] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[42:04] see and as it went through this stalking
[42:06] process it kept coming on more remember
[42:09] the little poen is more the tossel is
[42:12] more like the seed than the stalk is and
[42:16] the husk is more like the seed than the
[42:18] tossel was but the seed itself is beyond
[42:22] that see it just used that for
[42:25] transportation to itself through notice
[42:28] the bride if the bride in the beginning
[42:31] was the word of the bridegroom and then
[42:34] if the bride is taken from the
[42:37] bridegroom it must be the word
[42:40] also
[42:42] notice the bride must be why why must
[42:45] the bridegroom be the word manifested
[42:48] made plain is because the bride and the
[42:51] bridegroom are
[42:53] one she's just a smitten piece off of
[42:56] him
[42:59] there's the
[43:00] Masterpiece it was smitten s
[43:04] Michelangelo could not reproduce that
[43:06] again he could not put it back but God's
[43:09] going to do
[43:11] it he's going to bring this little bride
[43:14] smitten right back to the side of the
[43:16] original word and there he is there's
[43:18] the Masterpiece the family back again in
[43:21] Garden of
[43:22] Eden how is this bride going to do this
[43:25] how is this uh wheat go to do this
[43:27] Malachi 4 said in the last days it would
[43:31] be restored back what restored back like
[43:35] the
[43:36] beginning take it back I will restore
[43:40] sayth the Lord all the years of Palmer
[43:42] worm and canker worm and all these other
[43:44] things eaten I will restore again
[43:47] Malachi for said he will restore the
[43:50] hearts of the people and the faith of
[43:52] the people back to the original fathers
[43:55] against
[43:57] we see this right before us Church where
[44:00] are we
[44:02] at now closing in a few minutes I want
[44:06] you to notice real close but something
[44:08] that just happened Malachi 4 is to bring
[44:10] back back to the original she is smitten
[44:14] from the church from the church body
[44:17] smitten with her master for the same
[44:19] purpose she's the word as same as Joseph
[44:22] has smitten from his Brethren because he
[44:25] was the word word and Jesus is smitten
[44:28] from his Brethren because he was the
[44:30] word the church is smitten the bride is
[44:32] smitten from the church because she is
[44:34] the word there's your stages again 1 23
[44:38] just
[44:38] EXA the word living and in action the
[44:43] Bible bride not some man-made bride the
[44:47] Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God
[44:52] no Beauty we should
[44:54] desire but yet we did it has seen her
[44:56] smitten inflicted of God that's right
[45:00] she stands alone she's smitten from all
[45:02] the denominations according to
[45:04] Revelations 3 she's smitten out of the
[45:06] lady ofan Church age that she was raised
[45:08] up in see this church was raised up in
[45:11] the lady of seea church age that's a
[45:14] husk but if them others went can't you
[45:17] Pentecostal man see that if that other
[45:20] was husk and died if that other stalk
[45:21] had to die if the tossel had to die so
[45:24] must the husk die
[45:28] the three stages of
[45:31] organizations and remember you said well
[45:33] now there's a lot of tosel hanging on
[45:35] there's a lot of this yeah they've been
[45:36] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[45:38] Church of Christ all these other little
[45:39] things that fell on to it leaves and
[45:40] everything else and hung on to it but
[45:42] the original was the reformations I see
[45:45] stands alone like the bridegroom
[45:47] rejected of man despised and rejected of
[45:52] the churches the bride stands that way
[45:54] what is it it's his masterpiece PE than
[45:57] it's a word that he can work to make
[46:00] manifest rejected so the stalk the
[46:04] tossel and husk never become seed no but
[46:08] are all the time becoming more like the
[46:11] seed now at the Harvest Time the seed is
[46:16] back to its original life back to the
[46:18] Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought
[46:21] that way oh oh my must have all to be
[46:26] this way it must have all of the word is
[46:31] that right now what did he say in
[46:34] Revelations 10 that would take place why
[46:38] was a trip to Tucson the open to the
[46:42] church in the days of the messenger of
[46:45] the seventh angel the seventh angel
[46:47] messenger the whole word of God would be
[46:49] made manifest the seal that what all the
[46:52] stalk is left off and why and all about
[46:54] it would be made man manifest in this
[46:56] time is that what the word said am then
[47:00] we see it then where are we at hey or
[47:04] are we at there's only one thing the
[47:06] Harvest is here she's dead
[47:09] right she's ready now for the coming
[47:13] notice no it'll never be it the at the
[47:16] Harvest Time the seed is back to its
[47:18] original condition and must have all of
[47:22] the word in order to be the seed
[47:27] now you can't have a half a seed it
[47:28] won't
[47:29] grow it's got to be the whole seed it's
[47:32] got to not manifest say I've been
[47:34] baptism the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I've
[47:35] been speaking in tongu that's just part
[47:36] of the
[47:38] seed but now there added to
[47:42] that Hallelujah see the life not the
[47:47] gifts the life all the
[47:49] gifts thing see what I mean we're at the
[47:53] end time Brethren stalk toss husk is
[47:56] dead and dry now there's only one thing

[51:48] after the other day standing up here at
[51:51] the Christian
[51:52] businessman many of you I guess was
[51:54] there when I heard that Lutheran priest
[51:57] or preacher is supposed to be stand up
[51:59] there and say that ridiculous thing and
[52:02] make fun of what we believe in and them
[52:04] Full Gospel business man having that man
[52:07] there and seeing that he wore his collar
[52:10] turned around lots of them do now that
[52:13] he said now people ask me why I turn my
[52:15] collar around said how can they tell you
[52:17] from a Catholic priest said there is no
[52:19] difference than there shouldn't be he
[52:21] said we're all God's
[52:23] children he said I know a Catholic
[52:25] priest that's
[52:27] omnipresent that could be present
[52:29] everywhere now you cannot be omnipresent
[52:32] without being ommission God's not even
[52:34] omnipresent God's omn Mission Omission
[52:37] which me makes him omnipresent he knows
[52:39] all things but in order to be a being he
[52:41] has to be one being but being omn
[52:43] Omission he got can't be omnipresent
[52:45] because he knows all thing he know it
[52:47] before the that he know before the world
[52:49] begin how many fleas lice how many bugs
[52:51] and how many times it batter eyes and
[52:53] everything about it see because he's
[52:55] Omni presentent you can't be omn Mission
[52:57] om Mission without being infinite and
[53:00] there only one thing
[53:01] infinite God
[53:04] Amen and then we what is it it's a
[53:08] devil taking them right straight to that
[53:11] Slaughter every one of them going into
[53:12] exactly what the Bible said and here it
[53:14] is see come right in amongst the
[53:16] Pentecostals and just pull them right
[53:17] straight this
[53:19] is what a time oh after that
[53:23] testimony so someone said to
[53:26] me I I it's good thing I didn't say very
[53:29] much because they' probably have me in
[53:31] jail up there but I just thought there
[53:34] it is the people who's taught knows the
[53:37] wise shall know their God in that day
[53:39] said Daniel that's the wise will know
[53:42] they're God they're watching for these
[53:44] things but when I seen that happen and
[53:46] that Pentecostal
[53:48] stand even or robbers looked at me like
[53:50] that I said
[53:52] oh but stand up there with the Ed
[53:55] education polish
[53:57] so that's not the way God polishes his
[54:00] he don't polish his his education he
[54:02] polishes and humility and the power of
[54:05] His manifested word showing the shape of
[54:09] the grain that it went from now someone
[54:12] said to me said brother brandham said
[54:15] there's one thing I can't understand
[54:16] about
[54:17] you I said what's that stand out there
[54:20] in a hall I guess sister D and then went
[54:22] after to shook hands a bill and stand
[54:24] there and all up went around the corner
[54:25] a whole bunch of people a minister
[54:27] priced his way in caller turned around
[54:29] he said why is it that you're always
[54:32] balling the people out he said then
[54:35] people believe you to be a servant of
[54:37] God to be gentle and sweet to them and
[54:40] everything said every time I hear you
[54:42] get up you're balling women out about
[54:44] having short hair and about wearing
[54:45] shorts and wearing makeup and all this
[54:48] other stuff and balling the people out
[54:49] and tell them how cold and formal and
[54:50] indifferent they are so why do you do
[54:52] that so then people love you how can you
[54:55] be a loving Son of God and do a thing
[54:57] like that I thought Lord let me answer
[55:00] this smart
[55:01] man just let me answer him somewhere
[55:04] hang him on his own rope and I said
[55:08] well I said sir did you ever read of the
[55:12] great U
[55:14] uh uh producer of music called the great
[55:19] composer called
[55:20] Beethoven he said oh sure I read a
[55:24] Beethoven
[55:25] I said he probably tore up waste basket
[55:29] fulls of scrap paper but he gave the
[55:32] world
[55:33] masterpieces hallu you never opened his
[55:36] mouth and said another
[55:40] word I said when he was sitting in his
[55:43] study under the inspiration he'd write
[55:45] something down he'd go into his study
[55:46] and pray it wasn't right he scrap it up
[55:48] and throw it in the voice basket but
[55:50] when he got through in all inspiration
[55:52] the world had a masterpiece
[55:55] oh how the word
[55:59] Cuts but it produces
[56:02] masterpieces takes all the husk and
[56:04] stalk away yes it brings forth
[56:08] Masterpiece I got seven minutes to tell
[56:10] you something that happened day before

[56:36] filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in
[56:38] my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I
[56:41] never seen so much gum and filth in my
[56:44] life as I see among some people I sat
[56:47] there to my heart AE and the Lord had
[56:49] gave me a vision now I'm going to tell
[56:52] the vision I don't know what I can
[56:54] interpret it
[56:56] but I I going to tell the vision for my
[56:57] first time I fell into a trance and when
[57:01] I did there was somebody with me I
[57:04] didn't see the person it was just the
[57:07] voice and uh I looked and as I I looked
[57:12] this way he said the bride will come in
[57:15] view for a
[57:16] preview and I looked coming to me and I
[57:21] seen the
[57:23] most the most
[57:25] prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I
[57:29] ever seen in my life but each one of
[57:32] them looked like was dressed different
[57:34] they all had long hair and they were
[57:37] longer sleeves and skirts and so forth
[57:39] young women it look kind of I'd say
[57:41] about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open
[57:45] here before me I can only say what I've
[57:48] seen if you say what are you looking at
[57:50] I'm looking at a clock what are you
[57:52] looking for I'm looking for people
[57:53] looking at people why you you looking at
[57:55] I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm
[57:56] telling the truth that's what I see now
[57:58] I can only say what I seen amen I don't
[58:01] I don't know what it all about it I just
[58:03] have to tell you but when this bride she
[58:06] was looking right at uh the one was
[58:09] talking to me and I standing together
[58:11] her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest
[58:13] looking people I ever seen in my life
[58:16] looked like it could have been a dozen
[58:17] or more just I don't know how many was a
[58:18] breast but they just a group of and she
[58:20] passed by sweetly with an air and her
[58:23] eyes up watching as passed by oh she was
[58:26] beautiful I looked at her may she passed
[58:28] by he said now we shall review said
[58:31] that's the bride now we will review the
[58:34] churches and they come I notice Sam
[58:36] coming up and when they come up each one
[58:39] look like got worse I never seen such a
[58:43] filthy bunch in my life and when he said
[58:46] next I heard a noise and said next said
[58:49] Here Comes the American
[58:51] group now I am an American
[58:55] but this this made me sick I am not uh
[59:00] eloquent enough to in a mixed audience
[59:03] to say what was taking place uh uh uh
[59:07] and you'll have to read between the
[59:10] lines but when the women were coming the
[59:13] leader of them was a
[59:15] witch she had a great long nose and a
[59:17] great big mouth and all of them was
[59:20] dressed with some kind of lower clothes
[59:22] down here but the top just had a strap
[59:24] that just a little about a/ inch strap
[59:27] that moved up and went around them like
[59:29] this and each woman had something on an
[59:31] order many of you years ago used to
[59:34] remember when we used to cut that paper
[59:36] you know newspaper and make an old fly
[59:38] bush how many REM you know well I think
[59:40] you use in carnivals you know hanging
[59:41] down like a fringe paper lace paper they
[59:44] had something holding below them like
[59:47] this uh holding below them all this part
[59:49] was exposed and each one had hair cut up
[59:53] real short and fry looking things all
[59:56] over it like that real shortcut hair and
[59:58] full of
[59:59] makeup absolutely nothing but look like
[1:00:02] street
[1:00:04] prostitutes and they were walking with
[1:00:06] this paper and the
[1:00:09] vulgarity now the paper was what was
[1:00:11] hold in front of them but when they pass
[1:00:13] the review stand in the back of them and
[1:00:17] to see the way they were going
[1:00:20] on in their foremost in their back part
[1:00:23] and how they were acting I said is that
[1:00:26] the
[1:00:28] church and there she went and they were
[1:00:30] singing this year twisting Roll songs
[1:00:32] you know what you call going down sing
[1:00:35] going by I said is that the
[1:00:38] church and I was standing there and in
[1:00:40] my heart I was crying and this
[1:00:44] witch to my notion it's nothing else in
[1:00:47] the world but she's a she's that World
[1:00:50] Council of churches leading him right
[1:00:52] straight down the road where she was
[1:00:53] going
[1:00:55] they went off to the
[1:00:57] left and disappeared in
[1:01:00] chaos still beating this music and
[1:01:03] making real funny sounds and shaking
[1:01:06] their bodies one side and then the other
[1:01:08] side and then like that car like at
[1:01:11] walking and I just started to bow my
[1:01:13] head and he said wait the bride must
[1:01:16] come
[1:01:17] again and I look and here they come
[1:01:20] again and they pass by sweet looking
[1:01:23] little ladies it was all looking right
[1:01:25] at me as they pass by and I noticed each
[1:01:27] one was dressed different and one in the
[1:01:29] back had kind of long hair hanging down
[1:01:31] and had it rolled around like this might
[1:01:33] been German or something like
[1:01:35] that and I watched him and then as he
[1:01:38] started leaving two or three of them in
[1:01:40] the back car to get out of step and I
[1:01:42] was going to holler at him and they's
[1:01:43] trying to get back and step again and I
[1:01:45] seen him just the vision just fade out
[1:01:47] and change
[1:01:48] from now here is the interpretation
[1:01:53] thereof
[1:01:55] the reason I remember I had just got
[1:01:58] through writing I hadn't finished I
[1:02:00] hadn't wrote these notes yet but in
[1:02:03] preaching this morning I caught what it
[1:02:05] was right in my
[1:02:08] sermon did you notice the church only
[1:02:10] came in view now that's the truth
[1:02:12] friends the heavenly father who writes
[1:02:15] the word knows that I tell the
[1:02:18] truth I don't I just say the truth and
[1:02:21] not knowing it till just a few minutes
[1:02:23] ago look like or just recently see did
[1:02:27] you notice the Bride come in view
[1:02:30] twice the first seed the second SE both
[1:02:34] of them exactly the same one and the
[1:02:37] reason they were dri addressed in
[1:02:39] different parts she'll come from All
[1:02:41] Nations it'll make up the
[1:02:44] rde each one had long hair and no makeup

[1:02:48] watching me that represented the bride
[1:02:51] coming out of all Nations see each one
[1:02:54] repres represent a nation as they March
[1:02:56] perfectly in line with the word see then
[1:02:59] I have to watch her she'll get out of
[1:03:00] Step of that word if I don't watch when
[1:03:02] she's passing by if she gets by maybe
[1:03:04] it'll be my time when I'm over see when
[1:03:07] I'm finished or whatever it is watch
[1:03:09] they was getting back trying their best
[1:03:10] getting back this getting line is
[1:03:12] looking out somewhere else watching
[1:03:14] about that church and just went out of
[1:03:16] into chaos but two the front ones never
[1:03:20] the back ones just two or three of them
[1:03:22] was kind of stepped out a little bit to
[1:03:23] the right hand side it looked like I was
[1:03:25] trying to get back in line as he went by
[1:03:27] as this passed me Old Forest here at the
[1:03:29] wall passed me I was standing there and
[1:03:31] then I just seen all move out and leave
[1:03:33] but you notice the church only came into
[1:03:36] view once each Nation the church but the
[1:03:40] Bride come in twice see see what it was

[1:03:50] ground at NAA that was the original seed
[1:03:54] and she's come through the process of
[1:03:56] these denominations which only comes in

[1:04:01] back again in the last days I will
[1:04:03] restore see the Masterpiece is brought

[1:13:47] us when you smot him on Calvary you said
[1:13:51] speak hear him
[1:13:55] and the blood the Bible said speaks
[1:13:57] greater things than the blood of the
[1:14:00] lamb in the Old
[1:14:02] Testament for the blood of Christ speaks
[1:14:05] greater than the blood of
[1:14:07] Abel greater things and Speak Lord

[1:14:23] take it away from us we we don't want to
[1:14:25] be that way Lord It's Not Our
[1:14:28] intention and we realize we're living in
[1:14:30] such a horrible dark way as we said at
[1:14:33] the beginning we're walking up a
[1:14:35] mountain through rugged places dim as a
[1:14:38] trail but we're packing the
[1:14:42] light may we see step by step as we go

[1:15:14] trust just take us to him
[1:15:17] Lord grant it Lord Heal all the sick
[1:15:21] people your lord we did

[1:21:46] we
[1:21:49] me
[1:21:51] God
[1:21:56] amen I have enjoyed the
[1:21:59] Masterpiece praise God Amen let's take a
[1:22:02] look at our questions
[1:22:04] now what Parable is brother Brenham
[1:22:06] using to explain the Masterpiece coming
[1:22:09] forth if we go to uh paragraph
[1:22:13] 144 together paragraph 144 on page
[1:22:20] 27 this is what he says in paragraph 144
[1:22:23] I'm using this in a parable now of the
[1:22:26] Bride the Masterpiece that's coming
[1:22:27] forth as the Masterpiece fell there is a
[1:22:30] masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece fell
[1:22:32] at NAA Rome at NAA after NAA Rome she's
[1:22:35] come through a process but she's coming
[1:22:37] right back again to that Masterpiece per
[1:22:40] perfected cuz she's a part of that word
[1:22:42] that was spoken by him he'll have a
[1:22:44] church without spot or wrinkle it did
[1:22:46] not be connected any way with any kind
[1:22:48] of organization or denomination the
[1:22:50] cursed thing it's passed through those
[1:22:52] things but it will never be there so
[1:22:55] let's back up a little bit and catch the
[1:22:57] context he says he's using this as a
[1:22:58] parable so now let's go look at the
[1:23:00] parable he just described to the
[1:23:02] previous page page 26 paragraph
[1:23:06] 138 says and anybody how many ever seen
[1:23:09] a seed of wheat start to grow what's the
[1:23:11] first little thing it's just exactly
[1:23:13] like the seed but it's the husk see the
[1:23:16] three stages stalk tossel or the pollen
[1:23:18] then the husk and then out of the husk
[1:23:20] Comes The Original Seed not the seed it
[1:23:23] was the it was the life of the seed
[1:23:24] growing through this to come to the seed
[1:23:27] amen amen do you see it what is it a
[1:23:29] Resurrection coming back to a
[1:23:31] masterpiece again like the one that went
[1:23:34] in Pentecost come out of the Wesley
[1:23:37] because Wesley was an organization
[1:23:39] Pentecost come out as no organ no
[1:23:41] organization then it turned to one it
[1:23:44] had to to make the husk the True Word of
[1:23:46] Life on it was on its way then to the
[1:23:49] original grain through these stages
[1:23:51] through the stalk then into the pollen
[1:23:53] then from the pollen into the husk and
[1:23:55] from the husk into the seed no stock
[1:23:58] tossle husk living they they produced in
[1:24:01] their early Revival a holder of a
[1:24:03] certain portion of the seed life but
[1:24:05] when they organized the life moved on
[1:24:07] out that's proved by all history never
[1:24:09] an organization ever done a thing after
[1:24:12] it organized it was dead that's right
[1:24:14] Watch The Life is traveling on now it's
[1:24:17] moving on now bottom the last paragraph
[1:24:20] on this page paragraph 143
[1:24:23] now noticeable this life it's traveling
[1:24:26] in the corn of wheat then it is the tree
[1:24:28] God called us people like a tree see the
[1:24:30] life goes down in the tree and comes
[1:24:32] back again goes down and comes back up
[1:24:33] see it goes down and comes back up but
[1:24:35] in the corn of wheat it goes up from the
[1:24:38] original stalk through the stalk tossle
[1:24:40] husk and then the thing has passed
[1:24:42] through it dies so it can't get back
[1:24:44] through it again what is it it's no use
[1:24:47] anymore it goes on to its Perfection now
[1:24:51] let's go to uh paragraph 152 on the next
[1:24:54] page page 28 middle of the page
[1:24:56] paragraph
[1:24:58] 152 says then out come Wesley he saw the
[1:25:01] great big organization so he sounded a
[1:25:03] trumpet of
[1:25:04] sanctification I'm sorry this paragraph
[1:25:06] 151 sanctification more of the word than
[1:25:09] he did out that moved right out of
[1:25:11] Luther right into Methodist and when
[1:25:13] Pentecostal saw it they sounded a
[1:25:15] trumpet it's time for the return of the
[1:25:17] gifts see see what they did they sounded
[1:25:19] a trumpet and out they came then they
[1:25:21] organized but remember after the husk
[1:25:24] that's three stages we know of there's
[1:25:26] nothing else left but the grain oh God
[1:25:29] then the grain is put out of all of it
[1:25:32] amen seed words begin to form itself
[1:25:34] life is brought forth notice if the
[1:25:36] bridegroom the beginning the first
[1:25:38] bridegroom this is the bride coming
[1:25:40] forth praise God let's go down to
[1:25:42] paragraph
[1:25:44] 154 remember the little pollen is more
[1:25:47] the tossle is more like the seed than
[1:25:49] the stalk is and the husk is more like
[1:25:51] the seed than the tossel was but the
[1:25:53] seed itself is beyond that it's just
[1:25:56] it's just used that for transportation
[1:25:59] to take itself through I want you to
[1:26:01] catch that it's just use that for
[1:26:03] transportation to take itself through
[1:26:06] that's an important
[1:26:07] sentence now brother Franco can you pull
[1:26:10] up the Whiteboard for me and uh I just
[1:26:13] want to draw this out really quickly
[1:26:14] because brother Brenham is laying down
[1:26:16] such an important principle that's
[1:26:18] spanning the entire church ages
[1:26:20] especially the last three ages he's
[1:26:22] bringing back the restoration of the
[1:26:24] wheat and this is the parable that he's
[1:26:26] used and it's the parable of the seed
[1:26:29] and he said so let's let's say we draw
[1:26:32] our ground here this is the ground and
[1:26:34] he said at Nia Rome that seed fell into
[1:26:37] the ground so there was a seed a Remnant
[1:26:39] that fell into the ground and there was
[1:26:41] a little seed under the ground and in
[1:26:44] this seed was a part of life the
[1:26:47] original
[1:26:48] life and that seed now had to rot it had
[1:26:53] to die then out of there would come a a
[1:26:55] root system and up from there would
[1:26:58] spring forth two little
[1:27:00] blades in
[1:27:02] Luther right in that church age in the
[1:27:06] Lutheran Church age and now that life
[1:27:09] that was here when it went in the ground
[1:27:11] now moves and comes up here now the life
[1:27:14] is
[1:27:15] here not here anymore right so he's
[1:27:19] showing there's a progression the life
[1:27:21] is moving through
[1:27:22] now now if we go again let's draw our
[1:27:26] picture now to the next stage now we've
[1:27:29] got the the root system going we've come
[1:27:32] up now not just a tassel but we're
[1:27:34] coming up into a stalk now right and now
[1:27:39] that life that was in here that was in
[1:27:41] the blades now come into the stalk and
[1:27:43] now here we have life right sometimes he
[1:27:47] calls it a stock sometimes he calls it a
[1:27:49] to a tossle so sometimes it's it's it's
[1:27:52] up here in the head when you get the
[1:27:54] tossle there's where the life is but
[1:27:57] let's just let's just say that let's say
[1:27:58] we come up here now the life that was in
[1:28:01] the seed that's not a very good Arrow
[1:28:04] Chad now is in the tossel but it's not
[1:28:08] down here anymore now it's up there and
[1:28:11] what he's saying is these stages were
[1:28:13] just transporting the life you can never
[1:28:16] go backwards in this process and find
[1:28:18] life anymore that's what he's telling us
[1:28:20] so you can never go back to the the
[1:28:22] previous denomination you the Wesleyan
[1:28:24] couldn't back to the lutherans to find
[1:28:25] life the Pentecostals couldn't back to
[1:28:27] the Wesleyan to find life the only way
[1:28:29] to find life is where the life had moved
[1:28:31] to in the stage of the growth of the
[1:28:33] plan so in the tossel age it's only in
[1:28:35] the tossel you can't go reverse amen all
[1:28:39] right then he comes up here my I'm
[1:28:43] really testing my art
[1:28:45] skills so now we come up here to the up
[1:28:50] to the tassel now it forms a the head
[1:28:53] and in the head you have what looks
[1:28:57] like
[1:29:01] seed right but it's a husk it's a little
[1:29:04] Hall that is formed and the seed is a
[1:29:07] little bud down inside of there and in
[1:29:09] the Pentecostal Revival here in the head
[1:29:11] where the husk was there's life not
[1:29:14] anywhere else it's there but now that's
[1:29:17] the third stage but that growth was to
[1:29:20] do what it's going to we got to come
[1:29:22] back to where now the seed that was down
[1:29:25] here has got to reproduce itself right
[1:29:28] there yeah amen all right and when that
[1:29:31] when that now when that in this little
[1:29:34] head there's all these little holes but
[1:29:37] now that that hole cracks open there's
[1:29:39] actually a seed down inside yeah and in
[1:29:43] the last stage which you could call the
[1:29:45] fourth
[1:29:46] stage life is now in the seed
[1:29:50] again
[1:29:53] and when life is in the seed again it is
[1:29:55] no longer
[1:29:57] here so you cannot go back to the
[1:30:00] Pentecostal Edge you cannot go back to
[1:30:02] the previous Revival coming out of Assa
[1:30:04] Street to find life anymore now you can
[1:30:06] only find life in the seed and the seed
[1:30:09] up here this seed is the same as this
[1:30:14] seed it's come back to reproduce itself
[1:30:18] and this seed was was the reflection of
[1:30:21] the original church that that came forth
[1:30:24] out on the day of Pentecost not the
[1:30:26] Pentecostal Revival but the day of
[1:30:28] Pentecost that's what we're coming back
[1:30:30] to amen so all of
[1:30:34] this all of this was just a
[1:30:39] transportation vehicle yeah to bring the
[1:30:43] life back to the original life all right
[1:30:47] thank you brother Frank we can go back
[1:30:49] to the questions now cuz we're going to
[1:30:51] get to this later I want that to be a
[1:30:52] picture in our mind so that we
[1:30:54] understand when we get a little further
[1:30:56] down here let's go to the second
[1:30:58] question what is God doing with his
[1:31:00] Masterpiece that Michelangelo could not
[1:31:02] do let's go to paragraph 156 at the top
[1:31:05] of page
[1:31:07] 29 why must the bridegroom be the word
[1:31:10] manifested made plain it's because the
[1:31:12] bride and the bridegroom are one she is
[1:31:14] just a smitten piece off of him there is
[1:31:17] the Masterpiece it was smitten
[1:31:19] Michelangelo could not reproduce that
[1:31:21] again he could not put it back once he
[1:31:24] knocked the chunk off he couldn't put it
[1:31:27] back but God is going to do it he is
[1:31:30] going to bring this little bride that's
[1:31:32] smitten right back to the side of the
[1:31:34] original word and there he is there in
[1:31:37] his Masterpiece the family back in the
[1:31:39] Garden of Eden so what could
[1:31:41] Michelangelo not do he couldn't take
[1:31:43] that piece that was broke off put it
[1:31:44] back but God's going to take the piece
[1:31:46] that was broke off and he's going to
[1:31:48] bring it right back in in the in the
[1:31:50] what in the invisible Union of the the
[1:31:51] bride and the bridegroom they're going
[1:31:53] to come back to a marriage what is it
[1:31:55] it's the word uniting again with the
[1:31:58] word praise God let's go to paragraph
[1:32:01] 198 over here on page
[1:32:07] 36
[1:32:09] 198 at the bottom of page 36 all others
[1:32:12] were appear no more they went out never
[1:32:14] to come back again but the Bride come
[1:32:16] back cuz she was Alpha and Omega the
[1:32:19] great sculptor has made him a
[1:32:21] masterpiece
[1:32:22] for it is a piece of his first
[1:32:24] masterpiece like he made in the Garden
[1:32:26] of Eden he took a piece from and made
[1:32:28] another piece and that was marred and
[1:32:30] fell now he's been all this time
[1:32:32] building it up again he brought forth
[1:32:34] his Masterpiece and was smitten that
[1:32:36] part that was smitten was in order to
[1:32:38] bring back again the Masterpiece so he
[1:32:41] can bring them back again praise God
[1:32:46] question number
[1:32:47] three how is the bride going to be
[1:32:50] restored to the side of the the
[1:32:51] bridegroom so only God can make this
[1:32:53] restoration how is she going to come
[1:32:55] back let's go to back to page
[1:32:59] 29 and go to the middle of the page
[1:33:02] there on paragraph
[1:33:04] 158 how is this bride going to do this
[1:33:07] how is this weat going to do this
[1:33:09] Malachi 4 said in the last day it' be
[1:33:11] restored back what restored back like
[1:33:14] the beginning take it back what to turn
[1:33:17] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:33:19] fathers so how is she going to come back
[1:33:22] she has to come back through the
[1:33:24] prophecy of Malachi 4 that's the only
[1:33:27] way that's the way that this sculptor is
[1:33:29] going to take the peace and unite it
[1:33:30] back again he's going to do it through
[1:33:32] the prophecy of Malachi
[1:33:34] 4 oh praise God aren't you glad you know
[1:33:37] what that prophecy is you know how it's
[1:33:39] been
[1:33:41] fulfilled all right restore back like in
[1:33:43] the beginning take it back I will
[1:33:45] restore sayith the Lord all the years
[1:33:47] the Palmer worm the cankerworm and all
[1:33:49] these other things has eaten I will
[1:33:50] restore again again Malachi 4 said he
[1:33:53] will restore the hearts of the people
[1:33:54] and the faith of the people back to the
[1:33:55] original fathers again we see this right
[1:33:58] before us Church where are we
[1:34:01] at uh next paragraph now closing in a
[1:34:04] few minutes I want you to notice real
[1:34:05] close to something that just happened
[1:34:07] he's referring to the vision he's going
[1:34:08] to tell at the end Malachi for is to
[1:34:11] bring back back to the original she is
[1:34:14] smitten from the church from I'm sorry
[1:34:16] I'm going to get into that later but
[1:34:17] Malachi 4 is to bring back to the
[1:34:19] original let's go to paragraph 166 on
[1:34:23] the next page page
[1:34:28] 30 now at the Harvest Time the seed is
[1:34:31] back to its original life back to the
[1:34:33] Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought
[1:34:35] back that way oh my must have all to be
[1:34:38] this way it must have all the word so
[1:34:41] how is she going to come back remember
[1:34:43] Michelangelo couldn't do it but God's
[1:34:45] going to do it how's he going to do it
[1:34:47] he's going to do it through Malachi 4
[1:34:49] what's it going to take in order to be
[1:34:50] reunited she has to have all the word
[1:34:52] again so it's going to take the opening
[1:34:54] of The Seven Seals the taking the veil
[1:34:56] off the word and restoring the word to
[1:34:58] the church that'll actually be the glue
[1:35:01] that cements these pieces back
[1:35:04] together let's
[1:35:06] read it'll have to be it must have all
[1:35:10] of the word is that right now what did
[1:35:12] he say in Revelation 10 that would take
[1:35:14] place see he talked about bringing back
[1:35:15] through Malachi 4 now he goes right to
[1:35:17] Revelations 10 because Revelation 10 1:7
[1:35:20] and Malachi 4 are the same
[1:35:23] thing so Revelation 10 that would take
[1:35:26] place why was the trip to Tucson what's
[1:35:28] the trip to Tucson that's when he went
[1:35:30] out west to get the revelation of the
[1:35:32] Seven
[1:35:33] Seals to open to the church in the days
[1:35:35] of the messenger of the seventh angel
[1:35:37] the seventh angel message the whole word
[1:35:39] of God would be manifest the seal what
[1:35:42] seal would that be the seal that what
[1:35:45] all the stalk is left off why and all
[1:35:48] about it would be made manifest in this
[1:35:50] time is that what the word said then we
[1:35:53] see it then where are we at see where
[1:35:55] are we at there is only one thing the
[1:35:57] Harvest is here she is dead ripe she is
[1:36:00] ready now for the coming
[1:36:03] amen keep reading now now it'll never be
[1:36:06] at the Harvest Time the seed is back to
[1:36:08] its original condition and must have all
[1:36:11] of the word in order to be the seed now
[1:36:13] you can't have half a seed it won't grow
[1:36:15] it's got to be the whole seed it's got
[1:36:18] it got to not manifest I believe in the
[1:36:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I
[1:36:22] believe in speaking in tongues that's
[1:36:24] just part of the seed but now there is
[1:36:26] added to that Hallelujah the life not
[1:36:29] the gifts the life of the gifts see see
[1:36:31] what I mean we're at the end time
[1:36:33] Brethren stalk tossle husk is dead and
[1:36:37] dry now there is only one thing that has
[1:36:39] to happen to that is to the to be
[1:36:41] gathered in the world Council of
[1:36:42] churches for its
[1:36:45] burning the word has become flesh
[1:36:47] exactly like he promised in in Luke 17
[1:36:50] Malachi 4 and all see that's right
[1:36:53] Revelations all true life that was in
[1:36:55] the stock tossel husk is now gathering
[1:36:58] in the seed ready for the resurrection
[1:37:01] ready for the Harvest the alpha has
[1:37:03] become Omega amen the first come last
[1:37:06] and the last is the first the seed that
[1:37:08] went in has come through a process and
[1:37:10] become the seed again praise God he's
[1:37:14] not saying it will he's saying it has it
[1:37:17] is all the way back then he's saying
[1:37:19] it's right because why the word has come
[1:37:21] back amen now let's go to paragraph
[1:37:26] 213 all the way on page
[1:37:32] 39 and we and we know that we're far
[1:37:35] from a
[1:37:36] masterpiece but we're looking where we
[1:37:39] were hewed from the real Masterpiece and
[1:37:42] in him we
[1:37:43] trust this is not us saying I'm perfect
[1:37:46] now no no no but he showed me the real
[1:37:50] Masterpiece and he showed me by the
[1:37:52] opening of this word he showed me the
[1:37:54] part that was hued out and by Revelation
[1:37:56] he told me I'm that part that was HED
[1:37:58] out and now I'm not looking to myself
[1:38:00] I'm looking to the Masterpiece and I'm
[1:38:02] looking to the word I'm looking to
[1:38:03] Malachi 4 and I'm looking to Revelation
[1:38:05] 10:7 and I'm looking to the prophecy and
[1:38:07] I'm realizing he's putting me back in my
[1:38:11] place amen not our strength but his word
[1:38:16] all right question four what makes the
[1:38:18] husband and wife truly a family let's go
[1:38:20] to paragraph 1 76 I thought this was
[1:38:23] phenomenal uh page
[1:38:25] 31 all the way to the
[1:38:29] bottom page 31 at the bottom paragraph
[1:38:31] 176 notice the Great Masterpiece of the
[1:38:34] family the husband and the wife cannot
[1:38:36] be truly a family unless they are one
[1:38:39] they have to be if they're not they're
[1:38:41] not a good family wife pulling one way
[1:38:43] the husband another that would make an
[1:38:45] awful family but but in agreement with
[1:38:49] love one to another that's a family and
[1:38:52] now that was God's Masterpiece and now
[1:38:54] all the true family here portrays that
[1:38:57] so we're talking spiritually now about
[1:38:59] the spiritual family the husband and
[1:39:01] wife the bridegroom and the bride but it
[1:39:03] works it translate right down to our
[1:39:05] families what makes a good family is
[1:39:08] when the F husband and wife are not
[1:39:10] pulling in two different directions but
[1:39:11] they're one amen what makes them one is
[1:39:16] that they have a single Vision yeah amen
[1:39:19] that's what makes them one and men and
[1:39:21] what makes the great bridegroom and the
[1:39:23] bride one and the Masterpiece is because
[1:39:25] by the revelation of the word they share
[1:39:27] the same vision because the message is
[1:39:30] open to us the word of God and now
[1:39:34] that's why a denomination can never come
[1:39:36] to the marriage because the denomination
[1:39:39] can't be one with the bridegroom because
[1:39:41] they don't have all the word and they
[1:39:42] have addon ideas and man's Concepts and
[1:39:46] that can never come into a perfect union
[1:39:48] to be a perfect Masterpiece family with
[1:39:50] the bride bridegroom it would take the
[1:39:52] full revelation of the full word and of
[1:39:55] people who submit to that and come into
[1:39:58] that image is the only way the
[1:40:00] Masterpiece family can be United
[1:40:02] together again they have to be one if he
[1:40:05] was the word she has to be the word if
[1:40:08] he was the word made manifest she has to
[1:40:10] be the word made
[1:40:13] manifest praise
[1:40:16] God all right last
[1:40:19] question what did beeo and do in the
[1:40:22] process of making a masterpiece let's go
[1:40:24] to paragraph 184 on the next page on
[1:40:27] page 33 that
[1:40:32] is amen there is a man that's speaking
[1:40:36] to brother brandham a
[1:40:38] minister and and he says I was standing
[1:40:41] there in the hall I guess sister down
[1:40:42] and them after I shook hands with Bill
[1:40:44] and standing there and all went around
[1:40:46] the corner and the whole bunch of people
[1:40:47] a minister pressed his way and caller
[1:40:49] turned around and he said why is it that
[1:40:51] you're always balling the people out he
[1:40:54] said then people believe you to be a
[1:40:56] servant of God and be gentle and sweet
[1:40:57] to them and everything said every time I
[1:41:00] hear you get up you're balling women out
[1:41:02] about having short hair and about
[1:41:03] wearing shorts and wearing makeup and
[1:41:05] all this other stuff and balling the
[1:41:06] people out and tell them how cold and
[1:41:08] formal and different they are said why
[1:41:10] do you do that said then people love you
[1:41:12] how can you be a loving Son of God and
[1:41:15] do a thing like that I thought Lord let
[1:41:18] me answer this smart man see you just
[1:41:21] let me answer him somewhere that'll hang
[1:41:22] him on his own rope I said well I said
[1:41:25] sir did you ever read of the great
[1:41:27] producer of Music the great composer
[1:41:29] called Beethoven he said oh sure I read
[1:41:31] of Beethoven I said he probably tore up
[1:41:34] a waste basket full of scrap paper but
[1:41:36] he give the world masterpieces he never
[1:41:39] opened his mouth and said another word I
[1:41:41] said when we was sitting in his study
[1:41:43] under the inspiration he would write
[1:41:44] something down he'd go into a study and
[1:41:47] pray it wasn't right he'd scrap it up
[1:41:49] and throw it in the waist basket but
[1:41:51] when he got through in all inspiration

[1:42:19] hammering and chiseling and sawing and
[1:42:21] cutting and
[1:42:23] breaking and rubbing and
[1:42:26] irritation but it produced to the world
[1:42:28] a
[1:42:29] masterpiece oh there's been a lot of
[1:42:32] scrap pieces come out of my life but I'm
[1:42:35] praying God will turn this this hunk of
[1:42:38] stone or dirt into a masterpiece One Day

[1:42:45] 217 on

[1:43:22] it'll I I'll have a masterpiece some of
[1:43:24] these days if I keep it right on this
[1:43:28] word praise God remember brother BM now
[1:43:32] went into the
[1:43:34] vision back here and he began to
[1:43:36] describe the vision of he saw the bride
[1:43:38] coming
[1:43:39] forth and when he began that he said I
[1:43:41] may not know just the right
[1:43:43] interpretation and he begins talking and
[1:43:45] he saw the bride coming into preview and
[1:43:47] she was beautiful and she was perfect in
[1:43:49] every way and she passed off off the
[1:43:50] scene and now the voice said now the
[1:43:52] church will come and he said all the
[1:43:54] vulgarity and the filth and his heart
[1:43:56] like to drop then the American Church
[1:43:58] came and he just couldn't take it
[1:43:59] anymore and and in other place he said
[1:44:02] he just bowed his head and he wept and
[1:44:04] he couldn't take it and then they went
[1:44:06] off into chaos following a wit but then
[1:44:09] the voice said but the bride will come
[1:44:10] into preview once more and then he saw
[1:44:14] again the sweet faces and those clean
[1:44:17] women coming forth and and he began to
[1:44:19] describe the two one was completely
[1:44:21] uncovered and and and they were they
[1:44:23] were vulgar and filthy and they were led
[1:44:25] by a witch and they were moving and
[1:44:27] twisting to the wrong kind of music and
[1:44:30] and and they were uncovered because they
[1:44:31] didn't have the word all they had was a
[1:44:33] little gray gray piece of paper that was
[1:44:35] cut to make a fly bush to expand it
[1:44:37] bigger than they was and that's just the
[1:44:39] Creeds and dogmas of man amen but when
[1:44:41] he saw the bride he said it's amazing he
[1:44:44] said she had long skirts and long
[1:44:46] sleeves what's he saying she was fully
[1:44:49] covered she was completely covered by
[1:44:52] the
[1:44:53] word amen and so and she was marching to
[1:44:57] Onward Christian Soldiers and and and
[1:45:00] then he says but I caught it right in my
[1:45:03] preaching today he didn't have the
[1:45:05] interpretation when he had the vision
[1:45:06] but while he's preaching he said I had
[1:45:08] that before I had these notes he said
[1:45:11] but I caught it in the preaching this
[1:45:13] morning it's the alpha omega principle
[1:45:16] it's the seed that went in and the seed
[1:45:17] at the end but nothing in between it was
[1:45:20] all just a carrier but it would all go
[1:45:22] to complete death the stalk the tossle
[1:45:25] the husk amen you would only have life
[1:45:27] at the beginning and life at the end the
[1:45:29] bride that went into the uh ground and
[1:45:32] the bride that come forth is the same
[1:45:34] bride it's the alpha omega
[1:45:37] principle aren't you glad you're not in
[1:45:39] the husk
[1:45:41] age you're not in the stalk age yeah

[1:45:47] brought us forth in the seed age the
[1:45:49] wheat age the life age oh I'm so
[1:45:53] thankful I'm not worthy of it I don't
[1:45:55] deserve it and I don't always act like
[1:45:57] it but I am so thankful for it and I'm
[1:45:59] not looking to myself but I'm looking to
[1:46:01] that hued out place at Calvary where he
[1:46:04] struck him at Calvary and brought me out
[1:46:06] and I know he's going to take me right
[1:46:07] back and it'll be a perfect fit when
[1:46:09] he's done polishing this
[1:46:11] Stone thank God
[1:46:15] Almighty
[1:46:17] amen I just want to I want to highlight
[1:46:20] just this a couple other things if I
[1:46:23] could and then we'll be
[1:46:27] done uh paragraph

[1:46:43] hearts and yourselves before God these
[1:46:45] things are true I know that it sounds
[1:46:47] like that as such a great thing as that

[1:46:52] Nations it never was he doesn't change
[1:46:55] his ways just be thankful Church be

[1:47:06] Masterpiece that God has given you ears

[1:47:10] not it's not everywhere known it's not
[1:47:13] everywhere accepted but praise God I'm
[1:47:15] so thankful that I can see and I can
[1:47:19] hear I'm just
[1:47:22] thankful you know one other note brother
[1:47:24] Brenham he he he attaches the Harvest
[1:47:27] Time and the husk drying he says it
[1:47:32] excommunicates the seed and he ties it
[1:47:34] right to Revelation 3 when he was on the
[1:47:37] outside knocking trying to get back in
[1:47:41] and he shows that no other age no other
[1:47:43] Church age does that describe like it is
[1:47:46] in Revelation 3 why because through
[1:47:48] every Church age the life was was moving
[1:47:50] through it was transporting the life
[1:47:52] bringing it back to grain but at the
[1:47:54] very end in the last age when it goes
[1:47:57] back to grain there's no more
[1:47:58] transporting needed there's no more now
[1:48:01] what does the church age do now at the
[1:48:03] end time the Pentecostal age that husk
[1:48:06] opens up and it
[1:48:08] excommunicates him that's right who is
[1:48:12] the
[1:48:13] word and then he says this bride will be
[1:48:16] smitten from denomination she'll be cast
[1:48:18] out why because she is becoming the word
[1:48:21] she's becoming him she's the word made
[1:48:24] manifest that's why she's rejected from
[1:48:27] the whole lot not because she's not
[1:48:30] rejected because she has a nasty
[1:48:32] temperament and a bad attitude she's
[1:48:34] rejected because she's become the word
[1:48:36] and that denominational system cannot
[1:48:38] hold the word because they're done with
[1:48:41] the
[1:48:42] transportation they're done the seed is
[1:48:45] already formed praise God now let's go
[1:48:49] to paragraph 211 this is the last
[1:48:52] comment I'd like to make on page
[1:48:55] 39 page 39211 I just want to point this
[1:48:59] out I just love the way the prophet
[1:49:02] prays he says I don't know how to
[1:49:05] pray can you imagine being the prophet
[1:49:07] of the
[1:49:08] age and claiming you don't know how to
[1:49:11] pray I don't know how to pray we're
[1:49:14] talking to the Mighty God and what human
[1:49:17] being is there what Mortal could make
[1:49:19] the righte type of prayer before the
[1:49:21] Living God that's right but Lord in my
[1:49:23] mispronounced words and my nouns and
[1:49:25] pronouns in the wrong place if you could
[1:49:28] pick out the ABCs for a little boy one
[1:49:30] day and make a sentence you can omit my
[1:49:32] nouns and pronouns and just look to what
[1:49:34] I believe Lord I believe you I believe
[1:49:37] this word and I'm believing for each one
[1:49:40] here I just love that that did something
[1:49:43] for me brother B wasn't trying to
[1:49:45] impress anybody by his prayer he knew he
[1:49:48] was standing before a living God and he
[1:49:50] said what can a mortal say to the
[1:49:53] almighty God he just humbly just begin
[1:49:57] to speak from his
[1:49:58] heart and we may not be good at praying
[1:50:02] but being good at praying and having a
[1:50:04] good prayer are two different things
[1:50:06] right amen there's some people who are
[1:50:09] good at praying all yeah they sound good
[1:50:12] praying yeah but that may not be a good
[1:50:15] prayer the good prayer may not sound so
[1:50:18] good may not be eloquent it may not be
[1:50:20] smooth but it's honest from the heart
[1:50:23] amen and that's a good prayer and
[1:50:25] sometimes the best prayer is God I don't
[1:50:27] even know what to say or how to say it
[1:50:29] right but you know what I need would you
[1:50:30] please help me that may be the best
[1:50:33] prayer the that may be the most eloquent
[1:50:35] prayer we've ever prayed amen God I have
[1:50:37] no idea how you going to say it right
[1:50:39] but may the spirit speak with groanings
[1:50:41] that cannot be uttered amen man God
[1:50:44] bless you let's all stand musicians if
[1:50:47] you'll come brother John if you please
[1:50:48] make your way up
[1:50:51] I have enjoyed the
[1:50:54] Masterpiece I think what should we be
[1:50:56] doing brother Chad just keep looking to
[1:50:59] that place you were hewed out of which
[1:51:02] is Christ The Living Word of God you
[1:51:05] keep focused on that place we were hewed
[1:51:07] out of because that's where he's
[1:51:09] bringing us back to to fit right into
[1:51:12] the
[1:51:13] word I think it's glorious what a
[1:51:16] blessed day to be
[1:51:18] alive and God bless you all it's been a
[1:51:20] pleasure to go through the Masterpiece
[1:51:23] together let's bow our heads together
[1:51:25] and
[1:51:27] pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you for
[1:51:29] your goodness to us for your mercy and
[1:51:32] Grace in bringing us this
[1:51:34] message Lord there's so many ears that
[1:51:37] haven't heard or they heard with natural
[1:51:40] ears but had no ears in their soul to
[1:51:43] hear God we're just so grateful we're so
[1:51:46] thankful that you've allowed us to have
[1:51:49] ears to hear
[1:51:51] eyes to see and a heart to
[1:51:53] perceive and God we want to hear more
[1:51:55] and we want to see more we want to
[1:51:58] become more into your image than we were
[1:52:00] the day before Lord would you just look
[1:52:02] to our heart and see the desire in our
[1:52:05] heart and bring us into that image would
[1:52:08] you mold us Lord and finish polishing Us
[1:52:11] in this end time and bring us back into
[1:52:14] the place we were smitten from bring us

[1:52:28] of us Lord we're so thankful that we've
[1:52:31] heard this tonight may it transfer Lord
[1:52:35] from a hearing to a
[1:52:37] life from a listening together to a tape
[1:52:41] to the manifestation of what was said
[1:52:43] inside of us Lord and only you can make
[1:52:46] that transfer we don't have the power in
[1:52:48] ourselves all we can can do is receive
[1:52:50] it and believe it but we need you to
[1:52:53] make it live inside of us Lord you had
[1:52:56] an alpha bride and you promised you'll

[1:53:05] hearts that we're part of that Omega

[1:53:17] of the prophet and may we get in step
