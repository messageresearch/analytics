[16:51] among us we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[16:54] amen
[16:56] and God bless you we're going to let you
[16:58] take your seats for just a moment and
[17:00] then we'll stand and go to the scripture
[17:02] I just wanted to give you a little
[17:03] update on our trip down to Junction City
[17:06] we had a wonderful time I've got a few
[17:09] pictures that I want to show you
[17:11] um
[17:12] we really are enjoying this group of
[17:15] Believers down there these new Believers
[17:16] as you know they left the Amish Church
[17:19] some time ago and they were they were
[17:22] meeting together and then brother Levi
[17:25] Yoder had witnessed to one of the men
[17:27] here brother Irvin Ray Miller and they
[17:31] they received the message one and more
[17:33] we remember when we went and saw Jesse
[17:36] Smith baptized 17 of them and they're
[17:38] continuing on so Brother Kyle was there
[17:39] last month to minister to him amen
[17:42] they've been traveling around visiting
[17:43] and and we were had the opportunity to
[17:45] go last Sunday and this is the three-car
[17:48] garage that Brother Kyle told you about
[17:50] and they're in here and this is where
[17:51] they are worshiping the Lord and
[17:54] receiving the word and I've got a little
[17:56] clip here of the singing
[17:57] [Music]
[18:02] and
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:09] where it is
[18:15] [Applause]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:25] foreign
[18:35] [Music]
[18:37] amen I enjoyed that and so we had a nice
[18:41] service there and then I was surprised
[18:42] when Levi showed up he told me that we
[18:45] have baptisms today so we baptized three
[18:47] more souls in the name of the Lord Jesus
[18:49] Christ
[18:50] and so here they set up the baptism
[18:52] outside it was an absolutely beautiful
[18:54] day here at this is Brother Howard's
[18:56] home where they have the meetings and
[18:59] that baptismal tank is the same one that
[19:01] Levi and his family were baptized in the
[19:04] same one that we used to baptize Arlee
[19:06] stutzman and he he brought it again to
[19:09] baptize these three Believers and this
[19:11] was a good investment he made in a horse
[19:13] trough amen
[19:15] and so you can see brother Levi and his
[19:18] wife there and some of the Saints there
[19:20] gathered around as we started talking on
[19:22] water baptism
[19:23] and this is the first man Brother Marlin
[19:26] the first two brothers Brother Marlin
[19:28] and brother Matthew they were two
[19:31] individuals that brother Levi has been
[19:33] witnessing to and brother Levi witnessed
[19:34] to him brought him to the meetings amen
[19:36] they ended up driving to the meetings
[19:38] and mother Marlin had a truck and he
[19:39] brought the baptismal tank so he brought
[19:41] his own baptism with that the tank for
[19:43] his own baptism so it was really neat
[19:45] and so we baptized him in the name of
[19:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:49] and then this young brother Matthew we
[19:52] baptized him as well and then the Sister
[19:54] Mary Sister Mary her husband Eli is the
[19:58] one standing there right in the front of
[19:59] the picture uh Eli came down and was
[20:03] baptized with the group of 17 that got
[20:05] baptized he's not part of the Junction
[20:07] City Group he lives an hour and a half
[20:08] north and she didn't come at that time
[20:10] and so she came today this time this
[20:14] past Sunday and after we baptized the
[20:17] two men I knew we were going to baptize
[20:18] them because Levi had told me when we
[20:20] got there but at the end I just opened
[20:23] it up for anybody else that liked to be
[20:24] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:26] Christ and she said I'd like to be
[20:28] baptized and so that was exciting we
[20:30] baptized her and I just love that smile
[20:33] on her face as she's taken baptized and
[20:36] joining her husband in the revelation of
[20:39] the word and so God was certainly very
[20:42] good to us and we appreciate God's grace
[20:45] and his mercy and what he's doing he's
[20:48] definitely doing a stirring in that area
[20:49] that community and it's exciting to see
[20:52] and and it's done in such a way that
[20:55] nobody can get credit for it it's just
[20:56] something God has done sovereignly but
[20:59] I'm so thankful that we've been able to
[21:00] witness it and see it because it's been
[21:02] a thrill it's been exciting to see so we
[21:05] really appreciate Brother Kyle staying
[21:07] home and ministering here for us on
[21:09] Sunday I had an opportunity to watch the
[21:10] service and I enjoyed it it was really
[21:12] good I also enjoyed brother Isaiah's
[21:15] special so I'm glad he was in the
[21:17] service and some of his family as well
[21:19] so that was good he also texted me and
[21:21] told me he enjoyed the service and
[21:23] enjoyed being here
[21:25] let's turn to First John chapter 4.
[21:29] I'm going to continue on with a thought
[21:30] Discerning true love this will be part
[21:33] three
[21:34] and um as so often happens when you look
[21:37] at something it expands and God just
[21:39] dropped a few things in my heart several
[21:41] weeks ago on Discerning True Love on the
[21:44] subject and and for me when it drops in
[21:47] it's almost like I see the whole picture
[21:50] all of a sudden it opens to a whole
[21:52] nother level it's not all new things
[21:54] it's things we've talked about many
[21:55] times amen but it's on a whole new level
[21:58] amen and and so when that happens my my
[22:02] natural tendency the natural man Chad is
[22:05] to put it all in one package and preach
[22:07] it and one two and a half three hour
[22:08] sermon but I don't want to do that amen
[22:11] I want to stop and take bite-sized
[22:13] pieces because I want to I want to
[22:15] resist my own natural tendency amen
[22:17] because I see it as a picture I want to
[22:19] preach it as one picture but it doesn't
[22:21] always work that way so I've been
[22:23] forcing myself to slow down and thankful
[22:25] that I have because it keeps me in that
[22:28] channel and keeps me looking so today
[22:30] we're going to look at Discerning true
[22:32] love part three I start with first John
[22:34] chapter 4 verse 7. we've been reading
[22:37] this scripture all along
[22:38] first John chapter 4 verse 7.
[22:42] beloved let us love one another for love
[22:45] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[22:48] born of God and knoweth God
[22:50] he that loveth not knoweth not God for
[22:53] God is love
[22:54] so when we want to look at the subject
[22:56] of Love of true love God is love it's
[23:00] not something different than God or in
[23:02] addition to God it God is love and this
[23:04] kind of love is God
[23:08] verse 9 in this was manifest the love of
[23:11] God towards us because that God sent his
[23:13] only begotten son into the world that we
[23:15] might live through him
[23:17] hearing is love not that we love God but
[23:20] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[23:23] the propitiation for our sins
[23:25] beloved if we if God so loved us we
[23:28] ought also to love one another no man
[23:31] hath seen God at any time if we love one
[23:33] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[23:36] is perfected in US hereby know we that
[23:39] we dwell in him and he and us because he
[23:41] had given us of his spirit amen God
[23:44] bless you as your seed and
[23:46] it will take a moment and look at this
[23:48] scripture for a little bit
[23:50] I love the the end of this if we go down
[23:53] to uh verse 12 again
[23:56] no man has seen God at any time if we
[23:58] love one another God dwelleth in us
[24:01] so if we love one another with this
[24:03] genuine true love then God dwelleth in
[24:06] us and his love is perfected in us and
[24:09] this word perfected means to come to
[24:11] maturity or come to fullness and so it's
[24:14] showing that his love is perfected in US
[24:17] so so God's love is coming to a full
[24:21] manifestation as his love by his spirit
[24:24] is coming into us as individuals and
[24:27] causing a common Bond of love between
[24:29] the attributes of God which are the
[24:32] children of God
[24:33] so it's not just a Commandment that we
[24:35] try to be nice to one another no no this
[24:38] is God Amen the love of God being
[24:41] perfected in us coming to full maturity
[24:43] to full display coming to the Finish
[24:46] amen is when God's love in US reaches
[24:50] out to one another and is reciprocal
[24:52] amen then the love of God is perfected
[24:54] in US
[24:56] amen so when we preach these things
[24:58] we're not preaching them as something
[25:00] amen that we must try harder to obtain
[25:03] although we should try
[25:05] I hope you understand that we're not
[25:07] saying that we don't try but our efforts
[25:09] will fail it's something that we
[25:10] surrender to this is the love of God
[25:13] should have brought in our hearts by the
[25:14] Holy Ghost
[25:16] and so it's not our love being exercise
[25:19] it's his love being manifest through us
[25:23] so what do we do amen we must recognize
[25:26] and that's why I I was preaching on
[25:28] Discerning true love because sometimes
[25:30] it's so difficult to discern between
[25:32] filio love and agape love amen sometimes
[25:36] our emotions get entangled and we want
[25:38] to know we want to discern what kind of
[25:40] love this is so we can discern what's
[25:42] going on around us but also we can
[25:44] discern what's going on within us
[25:46] because sometimes it's hard for us to
[25:48] discern but when we understand how true
[25:50] love acts and how amen a filio love acts
[25:53] we can begin to discern that this isn't
[25:56] true love this is me this is my emotion
[25:58] this is my feeling but this isn't the
[26:00] love of God
[26:02] that way we can die to that kind of love
[26:05] and yield to the other kind of love and
[26:07] let it flow through us
[26:09] so it's not a putting on something or
[26:12] climbing to attain something but it's
[26:14] moving the false out of the way and
[26:16] dying to it to let the true come forth
[26:19] so we have to have a level of
[26:21] discernment even for ourselves
[26:24] so I want to read this again
[26:27] no man has seen God at any time if we
[26:29] love one another God dwelleth in us
[26:32] and his love is perfected in US
[26:35] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[26:38] he and us because he has given us of his
[26:41] spirit this love comes by his spirit
[26:44] if we love one another then God dwelleth
[26:46] in us and his love is perfected in US
[26:49] praise God so now I want to jump up to
[26:52] the the middle of this verse
[26:54] in verse 9.
[26:57] verse 9 and this was manifested the love
[27:00] of God toward us
[27:02] so God loved us but that love took on a
[27:05] manifestation
[27:06] so that love was was declared that love
[27:09] was went from the invisible to the
[27:12] visible amen and and it says and this
[27:15] was manifest the love of God towards us
[27:17] because that God's sin has only begotten
[27:19] son unto the world that we might live
[27:21] through him so the manifestations of
[27:24] God's love is god making a sacrifice
[27:28] God giving of himself god-giving for us
[27:31] not asking us to give for him but him
[27:34] giving for us
[27:35] herein is the love of God made manifest
[27:37] so then if we are to love one another as
[27:40] God loves us and God's God's love is
[27:42] perfected in us because his spirit
[27:44] dwelleth in us then we should be
[27:46] sacrificing for one another
[27:49] man it's that simple
[27:51] so let's read this again and this was
[27:53] manifest the love of God towards us
[27:54] because that God's sin has only begotten
[27:56] son into the world that we might live
[27:58] through him herein is Love This is Love
[28:01] This is how you see love not that we
[28:04] love God but that he loved us
[28:06] and send his son to be the propitiation
[28:09] for our sins so we go to Discerning true
[28:12] love this is a big part of discerning it
[28:15] here in his love this is love this is
[28:16] true love not that we love God but that
[28:19] he loved us
[28:20] and gave his son to be the propitiation
[28:23] for our sins because God loved he gave
[28:26] he so loved the world he gave
[28:29] and if we are to love one another then
[28:31] we need to be giving amen we need to be
[28:34] sacrificing amen for one another not
[28:37] demanding that everyone around us
[28:39] sacrifice for us but that we sacrifice
[28:41] for everyone around us
[28:43] now if you have a body of Believers
[28:46] which the body of Christ is a body of
[28:47] Believers and they all take that nature
[28:50] of God by the spirit of God and everyone
[28:53] is sacrificing then there's no lack
[28:56] there's not like you're sacrificing and
[28:58] nothing's coming in return no I'm
[29:00] sacrificing for the Brethren but the
[29:01] Brethren are also sacrificing for me not
[29:03] because I require them to do so I
[29:05] require nothing for my love my love will
[29:08] sacrifice my feelings my time my efforts
[29:11] for them amen but because God's in them
[29:14] they will sacrifice their efforts their
[29:16] time their feelings for me
[29:19] that's why this works so well in the
[29:21] marriage amen because if you ever have a
[29:23] marriage that is lopsided where one has
[29:25] a perverted love amen and is requiring
[29:28] the other to always meet my need meet my
[29:30] need meet my need meet my need amen
[29:33] that's not how you get your needs met
[29:35] the way you get your needs met is by
[29:38] meeting their needs
[29:41] it sounds it sounds opposite amen it
[29:44] sounds opposite to what the reality is
[29:47] but I do not get my needs met by
[29:49] requiring somebody meet my needs I get
[29:52] my needs met by meeting my wife's needs
[29:54] and when I meet my wife's needs by
[29:56] sacrificing my energy my time my
[29:58] feelings my whatever for her then now I
[30:01] have energized her to be free to express
[30:04] the love that's in her back to me it's a
[30:07] reciprocating love and gone amen we love
[30:10] him because he first loved us
[30:14] God didn't just stand and demand that we
[30:16] love but God first demonstrated love and
[30:19] in the demonstration of sacrificial love
[30:22] he gets a return of sacrificial love
[30:25] not because he demands it but because he
[30:27] gave
[30:29] and so in our homes even with our
[30:31] children amen it's not that we demand
[30:33] that they love us it's that we we
[30:35] sacrifice and God's love is perfected in
[30:38] us and we give and here in his love not
[30:41] that we loved him but he loved us and
[30:43] gave
[30:45] here is the manifestation of God's love
[30:47] that he sent his only begotten son
[30:50] so what is the manifestation of our love
[30:52] and our love manifested our love given
[30:56] will bring a reciprocating love
[31:00] but when we when we make demands on the
[31:04] people that we love I demand you meet my
[31:07] need I require you love me I demand this
[31:10] and demand that amen then then the
[31:13] person who is under those demands
[31:16] automatically understands that this
[31:18] something is wrong inside them they may
[31:20] not be able to verbalize it they may not
[31:22] be able to articulate what's going on
[31:24] but there's a repulsion inside because
[31:26] this is not the way God loves
[31:31] so now all of a sudden that repulsion
[31:33] amen and it looks like they're unloving
[31:35] it's not that they're unloving it's that
[31:37] this is a perverted love
[31:40] a pure love
[31:42] is a giving love
[31:45] but that pure law of giving Will Find a
[31:49] reciprocation
[31:51] and that's reciprocation won't won't
[31:53] need requirements demands
[31:57] it won't need any of that
[31:59] those things will come by free will
[32:02] if our marriages will begin to reflect
[32:04] the relationship between Christ and his
[32:06] bride this is the kind of nature that
[32:08] our marriages will take this is the kind
[32:10] of nature our families will take
[32:12] and we don't preach these things as if
[32:14] they're impossible they're not
[32:15] impossible this is the reality that God
[32:17] wants us to live in
[32:19] and do we live in hybrid flesh yes does
[32:22] our flesh get in the way yes will we
[32:23] make mistakes absolutely and we'll have
[32:25] to come to a repentance and make that
[32:27] right amen but this is where God is
[32:29] bringing us to amen this kind of love I
[32:33] believe that with all my heart I believe
[32:34] that this is the work of God in this day
[32:38] not my work it's the work of God but I
[32:40] must recognize the day that I live in
[32:42] and the hour and the word that's to be
[32:44] fulfilled and deny everything contrary
[32:46] to it and let that word flow through me
[32:51] the prophet of God he begins to refer
[32:53] here to Peter we won't go and read and
[32:55] and Peter where he says by these
[32:58] promises uh we were made partakers of
[33:00] the divine nature and and it starts to
[33:03] to show the progression of the nature
[33:05] all the way up to the headship which is
[33:07] Charity which is love
[33:09] and in Blasphemous names the prophet of
[33:11] God says first foundationally is faith
[33:14] second add to your faith virtue to your
[33:16] virtue Knowledge from knowledge
[33:17] Temperance from Temperance patience to
[33:19] patience godliness and from godliness
[33:21] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and
[33:24] then love being the Capstone
[33:27] seven of those things seven Church ages
[33:29] see and seven stars of the church ages
[33:31] and all of it is tempered together by
[33:33] the Holy Spirit now that's what it takes
[33:35] to become a servant of Christ Christ
[33:37] built his church in seven Church ages
[33:39] his bride a person a woman a church what
[33:43] has God been building through seven
[33:45] Church ages what are the virtues about
[33:47] what is the divine nature about God is
[33:50] building a person
[33:52] and he's building her by these Divine
[33:55] Natures by the divine nature by these
[33:58] attributes and he's building her all the
[34:00] way up into completion which will be the
[34:02] capping which will be him himself which
[34:04] will be love
[34:07] so he says now that's
[34:09] uh
[34:10] seven churches you see seven stars of
[34:12] the church and it's all tempered
[34:13] together by the Holy Ghost
[34:15] and that's what it takes to become a
[34:18] servant of Christ
[34:20] Christ builds his church in seven Church
[34:22] ages his purse his bride a person woman
[34:25] Church seven Church ages constitute and
[34:28] make the bride
[34:30] so what what makes the bride
[34:34] the divine nature built through seven
[34:36] Church ages and capped by him
[34:39] that constitutes the bride
[34:43] coming into the reflection of Jesus
[34:45] Christ
[34:47] let's turn to Matthew chapter five
[35:02] Matthew chapter five we're going to
[35:04] begin reading in verse 43.
[35:15] you have heard that it has been said
[35:17] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[35:19] thine enemy but I say unto you love your
[35:21] enemies bless them that curse you do
[35:23] good to them that hate you and pray for
[35:25] them that despitefully use you and
[35:26] persecute you
[35:28] that you that that ye may be children of
[35:31] your father
[35:32] why is he telling us to do these things
[35:34] because that's what God does
[35:37] and if you want to be like God this is
[35:40] how you become like God
[35:44] amen
[35:45] let's read it again in verse 44 but I
[35:47] say unto you love your enemies bless
[35:49] them that curse you do good to them that
[35:51] hate you and pray for them that
[35:52] despitefully use you and persecute you
[35:54] that you may be the children of your
[35:57] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[35:59] his son to rise in the evil and the good
[36:01] and sendeth Reign on the just and on the
[36:04] unjust
[36:06] for if if you love them which love you
[36:08] what reward have you do not even the
[36:11] public is the same and if you salute
[36:13] your brethren only what do you more than
[36:14] others do not even the public and so be
[36:17] therefore perfect even as your father
[36:19] which is in heaven is perfect
[36:23] Jesus is Calling them to a higher order
[36:27] he's calling them to be like God
[36:30] and in order to be like God God sends
[36:33] the rain sends the sun and the rain on
[36:35] the just and the unjust
[36:38] amen God's not waiting to to do good
[36:41] until good is done to him
[36:44] but even when the evil is done to him he
[36:46] continues to sustain life
[36:48] he continues to keep the world in its
[36:51] place he continues to keep the seasons
[36:53] in place he continues and continues and
[36:55] continues even when he gets no love
[36:58] and Jesus is telling us do these things
[37:02] so that you may be like your father
[37:05] which is in heaven so if we want to be
[37:07] like God you know when when I remember
[37:10] growing up as a boy amen and all of a
[37:12] sudden you'd go to church and talk about
[37:13] love and love and be nice and this and
[37:16] that I mean I was tuned out because as a
[37:18] boy I wanted to be a warrior a soldier I
[37:20] wanted to be anything but a loving nice
[37:22] little sweet kind
[37:24] but this kind of love is tough
[37:27] this kind of love amen is not a sisified
[37:30] feeling love this kind of love will have
[37:32] you swallow your feelings and move
[37:34] forward contrary to the way you feel and
[37:37] contrary to what's convenient and it
[37:39] pushes you out into the battle for us
[37:41] and get sends you out there to get
[37:43] stoned again to get slapped again to get
[37:45] knocked down again to be rejected one
[37:47] more time
[37:49] this is not a sisified love this is not
[37:51] a heart on Valentine's Day kind of love
[37:53] amen this is real genuine love the same
[37:56] kind God has
[37:58] and and and and Jesus is here
[38:01] instructing him his his disciples don't
[38:04] do like this do like this if you want to
[38:06] be like your father
[38:08] and I say this is the this is the hour
[38:11] for us to manifest the very Life of
[38:13] Christ
[38:15] Christ
[38:17] was the mystery of God revealed
[38:20] the mystery God was shrouded in the
[38:22] mystery no man had seen God at any time
[38:24] amen God was shrouded in a mystery and
[38:27] here God comes down in flesh and his son
[38:30] Jesus Christ and that flesh man was the
[38:33] manifestation of God and God was
[38:35] manifest in Jesus Christ and Christ is
[38:38] the mystery of God revealed amen but now
[38:41] the bride has been taken out of his side
[38:43] at Calvary and she's been grown and
[38:46] built through those virtues over seven
[38:47] Church ages and she's coming into
[38:49] Perfection not Perfection as Flawless
[38:52] Perfection as complete
[38:54] mature whole a finished product
[38:59] brother Venom says as long as we live in
[39:02] these bodies we'll have a sticky
[39:03] conquerber nature that's going to bother
[39:05] us I don't believe that I'm not I'm not
[39:07] expecting to become Flawless I'm
[39:09] expecting to become mature
[39:11] finished work complete amen one God that
[39:14] says that's what I'm looking for amen
[39:17] not not that I've never in my life made
[39:18] a mistake or I get to a point where I'll
[39:20] never make a mistake I don't know if
[39:21] we'll get there or not we might get
[39:23] there 30 seconds before the change of
[39:25] the body I don't know
[39:27] but what I do believe is we're going to
[39:29] come into this picture amen of the
[39:31] stature of the perfect man
[39:33] we're going to have these virtues living
[39:36] through us it's going to be manifest in
[39:38] a body on Earth which is the bride and
[39:40] the bride will be the mystery of Christ
[39:43] made manifest
[39:46] is this Christ was the mystery of God
[39:48] the bride will be the mystery of Christ
[39:49] May manifest
[39:53] the rest of his body
[39:55] on Earth connected to the Head living
[39:58] the same life
[40:00] brother Branham says in the message the
[40:02] spoken word is the Original Seed so now
[40:04] there is what I'm trying to say to you
[40:06] this is the portion from pick up your
[40:08] pen and write the angel dictated or
[40:10] actually moved his hand said now here's
[40:13] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[40:16] reproduction brings forth of its kind
[40:18] Genesis 1 11. these last days true
[40:21] church bride comes through the headstone
[40:23] will be the Super Church a super race as
[40:26] the nearest the great headstone they
[40:28] will be much like so much like him even
[40:31] they will be in his very image
[40:35] in order to be United with him
[40:39] they will be one they will be the very
[40:42] manifestation of the word of the Living
[40:44] God denominations can never produce this
[40:48] why is it denominations can't produce
[40:50] this because denominations don't have
[40:52] the correct word and the word is the
[40:56] word is spirit in life so without the
[40:58] correct word you can't get the right
[41:00] spirit and Life to manifest that word
[41:02] but the word Jesus said the words that I
[41:05] speak unto thee they are spirit and they
[41:07] are alive so when the words of Christ
[41:10] come forth when the anointed word for
[41:12] the hour comes forth it brings with it
[41:14] the very spirit in life it takes to
[41:17] manifest that word
[41:19] that's why denominations can't produce
[41:21] that they're the wrong seed they're a
[41:23] mongrel hybrid seed mixed with man's
[41:26] ideas not the pure word and not the word
[41:28] for the day amen but when you come to
[41:30] the word for the day it has spirit in
[41:33] life
[41:33] why do we come to preaching week after
[41:35] week after week after week amen and and
[41:38] sometimes we hear same same things or
[41:40] similar things over and over it's
[41:42] because there's a casting of the seed
[41:44] God's word is a seed Amen in his casting
[41:47] and casting and at one point amen at one
[41:50] point it may have fallen off of us and
[41:52] hit the one next to us
[41:55] but at some point it's going to fall
[41:57] into our good ground that's prepared to
[41:58] receive that seed and it's going to
[42:00] bring forth a harvest when it's watered
[42:02] by amen the spirit the spirit will bring
[42:05] life to that word
[42:07] amen so why do we preach we don't we're
[42:11] not preaching Amen to try to get people
[42:13] to do better and be better and work
[42:15] harder and attain something that's not
[42:17] the point of preaching the point of
[42:19] preaching is to bring the word that has
[42:20] the life and has the spirit to produce
[42:22] the life of the word and so it must be
[42:25] preached because there's a power in the
[42:27] spoken word of God and that word Must
[42:29] Fall in good ground and it must be
[42:32] watered by the spirit of God and it will
[42:34] bring forth the life so we come to
[42:36] preaching to get more of the life
[42:41] and see well I mean now I have to do
[42:43] this and I've got all these things that
[42:45] I have to do no all you have to do is
[42:47] receive the word by faith and say that
[42:49] ain't nothing but the truth let it be in
[42:51] me that way God that's what I want I
[42:54] can't produce it but I'm going to get
[42:55] everything I can out of the way so it
[42:57] can come
[43:00] praise God
[43:03] so this bride is coming into this image
[43:07] this is this is the hour we live in
[43:09] France
[43:11] we're not waiting for another generation
[43:13] to finish
[43:14] this is the generation that will finish
[43:16] these scriptures
[43:21] so the the fivefold ministry is here for
[43:24] the edification of the body
[43:26] for the preaching of the Gospel till we
[43:28] all come into the unity of Faith until
[43:30] we're built into the stature of a
[43:32] perfect man
[43:33] so the preaching of the Gospel is so
[43:36] that we all come into this picture
[43:39] which is Christ manifest in Flesh on
[43:43] Earth that's what we're preaching for
[43:46] but not in the way of you have to you
[43:49] measure up here's the line no this is
[43:51] the word receive it and let it go to
[43:54] work
[44:00] amen Matthew 22 let's turn to Matthew 22
[44:04] together
[44:14] I still haven't got to my subject for
[44:16] tonight
[44:17] but just in the review as we were
[44:20] talking the last couple of services we
[44:22] were talking about true love sacrifices
[44:24] the lover for the loved
[44:26] we saw that and and God we saw that with
[44:29] Christ true love sacrifices the lover
[44:31] for the loved
[44:33] perverted love sacrifices the loved For
[44:35] the Lover so perverted love requires you
[44:37] to make the sacrifice for me
[44:39] but true love will allow me to make the
[44:42] sacrifice for you
[44:45] and then the last service we preached
[44:47] was love seeks the best for its
[44:49] recipient
[44:50] love seeks the best for its recipient
[44:53] and and we made the statement true love
[44:55] will allow the love to suffer for the
[44:58] greater good
[45:00] so with true love the object of my love
[45:03] the object of My Affection I can allow
[45:06] it to suffer for the greater good
[45:10] a perverted love won't do that but a
[45:13] true love will because that's the kind
[45:15] of love God has
[45:18] and so now
[45:20] when we come to tonight I'd like to talk
[45:23] on love is corrective and it goes right
[45:25] in line with what we were talking about
[45:27] uh the last time but let's first look
[45:30] here at Matthew 22 verse 35.
[45:35] then one of them which was a lawyer
[45:37] asked him a question tempting him saying
[45:39] Master which is the great commandment in
[45:42] the law
[45:43] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[45:45] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[45:47] thy soul with all thy mind
[45:49] this is the first and great commandment
[45:53] and the second is like unto it Thou
[45:56] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[45:58] on these two Commandments hang all the
[46:01] law and the prophets
[46:03] you want to come to the Fulfillment of
[46:06] the word
[46:07] we come to this
[46:09] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[46:11] with all thy soul with all thy mind and
[46:14] love thy neighbor as thyself
[46:17] amen let's go to Romans 13.
[46:20] and we'll see where Paul refers to this
[46:25] Romans 13.
[46:31] in verse 8.
[46:36] Romans 13 and 8.
[46:39] oh no man anything but to love one
[46:42] another for he that loveth another hath
[46:45] fulfilled the law
[46:47] for this thou shall not commit adultery
[46:49] thou shall not kill Thou shalt not steal
[46:51] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[46:53] shalt not covet if there be any other
[46:55] commandment it is briefly comprehended
[46:57] in this saying namely Thou shalt love
[47:00] thy neighbor as thyself
[47:03] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[47:06] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[47:10] law
[47:12] it's that simple
[47:15] all the law the ordinances the
[47:18] Commandments all the that that Moses had
[47:21] turned over to the Levites to teach the
[47:23] children of Israel all of that is
[47:25] fulfilled in these two great
[47:28] Commandments the great commandment and
[47:30] the one next to it is love the Lord thy
[47:32] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[47:33] with all thy mind and love thy neighbor
[47:35] as thyself and then Paul picks it up and
[47:38] says now all of these Commandments don't
[47:40] commit adultery don't steal don't bear
[47:42] false witness don't do any of these
[47:44] these are all fulfilled if you love your
[47:48] neighbor as yourself you won't commit
[47:51] adultery
[47:52] you won't bear false witness you won't
[47:54] lie you won't steal you won't covet you
[47:57] won't do any of these things if you have
[47:58] the right kind of love amen that's why
[48:00] love is so much higher than the law amen
[48:03] that's why there's a law of Love which
[48:05] supersedes all other laws because the
[48:07] law was a way for man to recognize he
[48:10] couldn't do it
[48:12] that was the purpose of the law the
[48:14] Apostle Paul tells us so the law was
[48:16] perfect there's no problem with the law
[48:17] the problem was with flesh
[48:20] so the law was there to show man that he
[48:22] couldn't do it amen he needed something
[48:24] greater amen than just his ability to
[48:26] keep the law he needs the love of God
[48:28] should have brought in his heart by the
[48:30] Holy Ghost
[48:31] to where the Fulfillment of the law is
[48:34] love
[48:36] because love will not do ill to its
[48:40] neighbor
[48:41] and love will not reject God and do ill
[48:45] towards God
[48:46] and if we have the right kind of love
[48:48] that will not reject God and will not uh
[48:50] uh disrespect God and will not do ill to
[48:53] a neighbor then we don't have to worry
[48:54] about any rules amen because all rules
[48:56] will be fulfilled in this one
[48:59] praise God
[49:01] amen
[49:04] so love is the fulfilling of the law
[49:08] now
[49:10] in the message Christ is revealed in his
[49:12] own word he says I've been this week
[49:14] down in this country staying with some
[49:16] very dear friends I asked some of them
[49:18] at the table yesterday when we was
[49:19] eating we always sit around and have
[49:22] like a little study on the Bible we was
[49:24] talking about love so brother bear I'm
[49:26] sitting around the table fellowshipping
[49:28] with some friends and he begins talking
[49:30] about love that's the subject they're
[49:32] studying and here's what he said
[49:34] and there was a certain person said to
[49:36] me he said I believe you're an
[49:38] antichrist
[49:40] remember the subject is love they're
[49:41] doing a little bible study on love
[49:43] somebody said I made a statement that
[49:45] they somebody had said about him I
[49:47] believe you're the Antichrist you're an
[49:49] antichrist
[49:50] I said if that would be pleasing to my
[49:53] Lord that's what I want to be
[49:56] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[50:00] I love him and if he should cast me into
[50:02] hell I still will love him if I go with
[50:05] the same spirit I have now
[50:07] he looked at me kind of strange
[50:09] I seen four or five of them there young
[50:12] men young wives fine women I knowed how
[50:14] them boys loved their wives so I said to
[50:16] them I said here's the way to test it if
[50:20] your wife before you were married now
[50:21] you go back say this married life you've
[50:24] been dreaming you were married you
[50:25] really wasn't married but you dreamed
[50:27] you were and you woke up and you went in
[50:29] and talked it over with your girlfriend
[50:30] and said you know I dreamed that we were
[50:33] married and we had children
[50:35] we live happy and waiting for the coming
[50:37] of the Lord and everything and then this
[50:39] girl would say to you you know I love
[50:41] another man better than I love you
[50:44] I could be happier with the other man
[50:46] could you from your heart love her well
[50:49] enough to say God's blessing rest upon
[50:52] you my dear go with this other man
[50:55] you tell me Love is Easy
[50:58] love is hard
[51:04] now this is my brother says now
[51:06] check that each of you men or you women
[51:08] say well if you love if your love is
[51:11] correct you would do that for you are
[51:14] interested in her welfare
[51:17] that's true love
[51:19] interested in the other that's true love
[51:24] what you know you know you could have
[51:26] her you can live with her she's your
[51:28] wife she will be she'll marry you but
[51:31] she won't be happy she would be happier
[51:33] and then if you love her then you want
[51:35] her to be happy therefore whatever the
[51:37] will of God is let God's will be done
[51:40] whether I'm happy with it or not
[51:45] I want to live so he will be pleased
[51:48] with what I do therefore check your
[51:51] objective and your motive by that you
[51:53] know whether you love God or not
[51:55] what if he'd say you serve me and I'm
[51:57] going to cast you away I love you anyhow
[52:01] but I remember showing us what true love
[52:02] is and he brings it into a practical
[52:04] application and he takes these these uh
[52:08] four or five young men and their wives
[52:10] who love their wives love these women
[52:12] but he said that correct love if you
[52:14] weren't married yet and before you got
[52:15] engaged before you come to marriage she
[52:17] confesses she would love somebody else
[52:19] if you have pure love
[52:22] you would want her to be happy
[52:24] and pure love to God wants what pleases
[52:28] God not what pleases self
[52:30] so he's taking one to show the other
[52:32] amen if I love God there's billions of
[52:36] people who claim to love God Amen but
[52:38] really they love themselves because they
[52:40] love what God can do for them
[52:43] they love a God who will heal they love
[52:46] a God who will deliver they love a God
[52:48] and we certainly do love a God who will
[52:50] do all of those things but sometimes God
[52:53] Amen will ask us to do things we don't
[52:55] want to do
[52:57] and sometimes God will allow us to pass
[53:00] through trials we don't want to pass
[53:01] through
[53:03] and what do we do then when the God we
[53:05] love amen is actually asking us to do
[53:08] something that will please him and serve
[53:10] his purpose but we don't want to do it
[53:12] now and everything in US is resisting
[53:15] this thing that God has willed and
[53:16] determined for our life amen what does
[53:19] true love do true love says not my will
[53:22] but thy will be done true love says
[53:24] whatever is pleasing to my father is
[53:26] what I want to do
[53:30] and so there's there's many times in
[53:32] life that we pass through things we
[53:34] don't want to do
[53:36] amen but God knows the end from the
[53:38] beginning and he knows what's coming
[53:40] next
[53:42] so he is always looking to the Future
[53:46] amen let's go to James chapter 2.
[53:57] James chapter 2 verse 8.
[54:09] uh James two and eight if you fulfill
[54:11] the Royal law according to the scripture
[54:14] what is the Royal the Royal law
[54:17] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[54:21] if you fulfill the Royal law according
[54:23] to the scripture Thou shalt love thy
[54:25] neighbor as thyself you do well
[54:28] James calls this the Royal law
[54:31] this is the Great Law the law of love
[54:37] problem of God says now look I don't
[54:40] want to criticize I love you in genuine
[54:43] true love always is corrective
[54:46] remember we talked about last time that
[54:49] that that love seeks the best for its
[54:51] recipient
[54:53] and if love truly seeks the best for its
[54:55] recipient amen then love will do what it
[54:58] takes to bring the best for the
[55:01] recipient and many times sometimes
[55:03] that's correction sometimes correction
[55:05] is what's best
[55:06] that's true for our children and that's
[55:08] true in many ways
[55:10] here's a few things brother bam says he
[55:13] says and then the strange thing how that
[55:15] his great wise Providence how he works
[55:17] things
[55:18] how he works things out seems like that
[55:21] love has a funny feeling to it not a
[55:23] feeling but a reaction
[55:25] saying love has a funny reaction to it
[55:27] and when I look out amongst the people
[55:29] as he called me to be a servant and I
[55:31] look out amongst the people and I see
[55:33] sin creeping in then I have to just tear
[55:36] in there with all that's in me you see
[55:38] to tear it out and that makes it look
[55:40] hard to me to my way of looking at it
[55:42] why to say those things but yet down at
[55:45] the bottom true love runs like that true
[55:48] love so even brother himself he says
[55:50] sometimes it looks like it's so hard to
[55:52] my way of thinking when I see sin
[55:54] creeping in I gotta re I gotta go in
[55:56] there and tear it out amen that's the
[55:58] reaction of love
[56:00] so sometimes love has a as a funny
[56:02] reaction to it and that's the reaction
[56:05] of love and he types it to a family now
[56:07] to a mom or dad he says now your little
[56:10] boy or little girl was playing on the
[56:11] street where cars are running and you
[56:13] knew sooner or later they're going to
[56:14] get hurt now he says why Papa I want to
[56:17] be out here would you say bless your
[56:19] little heart junior you just go right
[56:20] ahead and play in the street
[56:22] that's not a real daddy
[56:24] if you have to jerk that little fellow
[56:26] up and give him a spanking scold him tie
[56:29] him up anything else keep him off the
[56:31] street he'll get killed is that right
[56:33] well that's the way you have to do with
[56:35] the gospel you have to shake and push
[56:37] and try to do everything you can to keep
[56:39] the people lined up
[56:41] and I hope everybody understands that
[56:43] way I'm trusting I love this statement
[56:46] I'm trusting that someday after it's all
[56:48] over
[56:49] and then when the veils are taken from
[56:52] before our face we will understand then
[56:56] sometimes statements seem so hard and it
[56:58] seems like some services are so hard and
[57:01] some things are are are are are set in
[57:04] such a hard way and brother bam himself
[57:06] says sometimes I think it's hard in my
[57:08] way of thinking amen but he says down at
[57:12] the bottom of it is true love
[57:14] someday when the veil's taken away I'm
[57:18] sure a little child at home when Mom and
[57:21] Dad bring a correction and they bring a
[57:22] chastisement and that little fella goes
[57:25] to his room and he's sulking he's crying
[57:27] in his bottom stinging and he's feeling
[57:29] like nobody in the world loves him and
[57:30] he doesn't understand why it has to be
[57:32] this way amen when that little fellow
[57:35] becomes an adult the veil is taken away
[57:37] and he recognizes I'm thankful for that
[57:40] that's what I needed and I needed that
[57:44] that's what Brother Bear I'm saying
[57:45] someday when this Veil is taken away
[57:46] we'll understand then
[57:49] let's go to Proverbs chapter 19.
[58:02] Proverbs chapter 19.
[58:06] verse 18.
[58:12] Proverbs 19 and 18.
[58:15] chasten thy son while there is hope
[58:18] and let thought thy Soul spare for his
[58:20] crying
[58:22] boy this is a tough scripture
[58:24] very tough scripture chasing thy Soul
[58:27] while there's hope you've got to do it
[58:30] while there's time while there's a
[58:31] chance don't put it off
[58:34] Chase and I said well there's hope and
[58:35] let not thy Soul spare for his crying
[58:38] he's crying don't even let yourself pull
[58:41] back don't let yourself spare don't do
[58:43] that because why you've got his best
[58:46] interest in mind long term
[58:49] that's true love and that's parenting
[58:52] with true love you know we talked before
[58:54] I think it was a couple Services ago
[58:57] about sometimes you know how a
[58:59] grandmother or grandfather or somebody
[59:00] can interfere amen and there's
[59:02] discipline that needs to happen to a
[59:04] child and Grandma will get away say oh
[59:06] don't do it don't how can you do it or
[59:07] there's nothing wrong they're fine
[59:09] they're fine that's not love and when
[59:11] the statement's made I just can't stand
[59:13] to see him punished
[59:16] well who Do You Love More yourself or
[59:18] the one who needs it
[59:21] that's a perverted self-love
[59:24] that's a love that says it pains me
[59:27] to see proper discipline
[59:30] I'm not talking about improper
[59:31] discipline I'm talking about proper
[59:32] discipline it pains me so I want you to
[59:35] forego the proper discipline to spare me
[59:38] any pain and suffering in my emotional
[59:40] realm and I tell you that is a human
[59:43] perverted love that's not the love of
[59:45] God
[59:46] the love of God you'll hurt absolutely
[59:49] you'll hurt You'll wish it didn't have
[59:50] to happen you'll cringe you'll wins
[59:52] you'll leave the room you'll go outside
[59:54] you'll do whatever you have to do but
[59:56] you won't interfere with what's best for
[59:58] that child
[1:00:00] that goes for a mom and dad both ways
[1:00:03] amen amen we have to sometimes do the
[1:00:07] hard thing take the higher Road amen
[1:00:09] because of love
[1:00:11] because of pure love
[1:00:13] let's go to proverbs 23.
[1:00:16] verse 13.
[1:00:19] Proverbs 23 verse 13.
[1:00:26] withhold not
[1:00:28] correction from the child for if thou
[1:00:30] beatest him with the rod he shall not
[1:00:33] die Thou shalt beat him with the rod and
[1:00:35] shall deliver his soul from hell
[1:00:39] what is the objective
[1:00:41] what is the objective the objective is
[1:00:44] salvation
[1:00:45] the objective is character the objective
[1:00:48] is is driving away a rebellious Spirit a
[1:00:51] rebellious the spirit is as the sin of
[1:00:53] witchcraft
[1:00:54] amen so you're driving away and keeping
[1:00:58] at Bay those spirits that want to take
[1:01:00] over why because you've got a
[1:01:02] destination in mind you're you're trying
[1:01:05] to prevent them from Hell amen and so
[1:01:07] you're willing to do what you don't even
[1:01:09] want to do you're willing to do what
[1:01:11] they don't want you to do in order to do
[1:01:13] what's best
[1:01:16] that's true love
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:21] we find so many there's an absolute
[1:01:23] total failure in parenting in our day
[1:01:26] you look around the world there's an
[1:01:28] absolute total failure in parenting
[1:01:31] we've talked about it before but I mean
[1:01:33] how many times you hear the kid out of
[1:01:35] control in the grocery store I don't
[1:01:37] hear it anymore because I refuse to go
[1:01:38] to the grocery store
[1:01:41] absolutely out of control demanding
[1:01:43] things I want this I want this I want
[1:01:45] that and and Mom finally snaps and she
[1:01:48] yells and if you don't stop that I'm
[1:01:50] going to this that and that and they
[1:01:51] continue on and you hear her say that
[1:01:53] five six seven eight nine ten times but
[1:01:55] she never does anything I I I'm just
[1:01:59] going to make this statement and and it
[1:02:01] could get me in a lot of trouble but
[1:02:02] that is a perverted love that woman
[1:02:04] loves herself more than she loves that
[1:02:06] child
[1:02:08] because if she loved that child and had
[1:02:10] a long-term vision for that child she
[1:02:12] would leave her grocery cart parked
[1:02:14] where it was take the little child out
[1:02:16] to the vehicle and hopefully it's a van
[1:02:18] with tinted windows
[1:02:21] do what needs to be done to drive that
[1:02:23] spirit away and bring Harmony back into
[1:02:25] the relationship and bring some Mission
[1:02:27] and drive away Rebellion bring the child
[1:02:30] back and set it in the car amen and push
[1:02:32] it on through amen and finish getting
[1:02:34] the groceries there is absolutely no
[1:02:36] reason amen you cannot take your
[1:02:38] children to the grocery store when I
[1:02:39] hear parents say I can't take them to
[1:02:41] the grocery store then you failed as a
[1:02:43] parent
[1:02:44] because if you can't spend an hour hour
[1:02:47] and a half grocery shopping and your
[1:02:48] child sit in the car stand next to it
[1:02:50] amen we used to make our children they
[1:02:52] had the when they were little they had
[1:02:53] to hold on to the cart
[1:02:55] and they weren't allowed to let go
[1:02:57] unless they had permission
[1:03:00] why because we hated him no because we
[1:03:02] loved them
[1:03:03] we didn't want to lose them in the store
[1:03:07] so you tell me I can't take him no you
[1:03:10] can't take him because you don't want to
[1:03:11] go through the hard work of making them
[1:03:13] listen because you're not building the
[1:03:15] proper character in a child they meant
[1:03:17] to be submissive and be obedient which
[1:03:19] is what they need at that age so that
[1:03:21] they can go to the next stage of life
[1:03:23] all right we can't skip these stages and
[1:03:26] expect everything to work out later amen
[1:03:28] and how many times have you seen parents
[1:03:30] amen that that their child is being an
[1:03:33] absolute brat they're doing something
[1:03:34] wrong and Mom will see it and act like
[1:03:37] she doesn't see it
[1:03:39] turn or try to get in a conversation and
[1:03:41] act like she or he doesn't see that
[1:03:43] going on right there and everybody else
[1:03:45] in the room sees it
[1:03:47] but
[1:03:48] that's not the right kind of love
[1:03:51] because what's happening is amen at you
[1:03:54] have an opportunity to take care of
[1:03:56] something and you can't always take care
[1:03:58] of things right then sometimes you have
[1:03:59] to defer to later but you can't let
[1:04:01] those things go mom and dad you can't
[1:04:04] act like you don't see you act like you
[1:04:06] don't see so that you don't have to be
[1:04:08] inconvenienced with stopping your
[1:04:10] conversation getting out of your seat
[1:04:11] breaking your fellowship going over and
[1:04:13] taking care of what needs to be taken
[1:04:15] care of that's a selfish love
[1:04:19] but true love does what's best for the
[1:04:22] recipient of their love
[1:04:24] what is best what's best is I say excuse
[1:04:27] me
[1:04:28] I'll be right back
[1:04:31] break my fellowship break my
[1:04:32] conversation stop eating what I'm eating
[1:04:36] and go take care but my food will be
[1:04:38] cold but I'm preventing Rebellion
[1:04:42] from taking hold of my child
[1:04:45] I've got a long-term Vision here I'll
[1:04:48] eat plenty of warm meals later
[1:04:50] but I got to get them through this stage
[1:04:52] of life
[1:04:53] I'll eat so many warm meals I'll get
[1:04:55] tired of them I'll eat them by myself
[1:04:57] when they're all grown and gone but
[1:04:58] right now I've got to take care of this
[1:05:01] because I love them too much to let
[1:05:03] Rebellion grow
[1:05:04] I love them too much Amen to let these
[1:05:07] things go amen and so we have to take
[1:05:09] care of them so that that that situation
[1:05:11] of acting like you don't see it and
[1:05:13] pretending that it's not happening that
[1:05:15] is not doing that child any good
[1:05:18] that's only sparing you inconvenience
[1:05:21] and maybe an uncomfortable situation and
[1:05:24] an uncomfortable Exchange
[1:05:26] but it's worth for the soul of that
[1:05:29] child it's worth being inconvenienced
[1:05:32] it's worth being made uncomfortable it's
[1:05:35] worth the difficult situation it's worth
[1:05:37] the difficult conversation it's worth
[1:05:40] the embarrassment of having to stop
[1:05:42] everything and go take your child and
[1:05:44] take them to the bathroom take them to
[1:05:45] the car take them home
[1:05:48] it's worth it
[1:05:50] that's what love will do love will
[1:05:53] expend itself
[1:05:56] for the recipient of love
[1:05:58] love will will will give up pleasure
[1:06:03] comfort
[1:06:04] peace for the one I love
[1:06:09] you you can't hardly stand to go out in
[1:06:12] public anymore
[1:06:14] with the way things are the the way
[1:06:17] I mean
[1:06:18] if your children sit at a restaurant
[1:06:21] talk to you eat their food people buy
[1:06:23] your meals
[1:06:25] because they're so impressed and that is
[1:06:27] supposed to be normal
[1:06:30] and it's become abnormal amen because uh
[1:06:34] because there's no more love in the
[1:06:36] heart of men that's a sign of the end
[1:06:38] time
[1:06:39] everything is moved to a perverted love
[1:06:41] there's so little true love this is a
[1:06:44] sign of the end time so little true love
[1:06:46] that you'll sit down to dinner or you're
[1:06:48] in the grocery store child starts
[1:06:50] getting to be a brat they need some
[1:06:52] discipline and they hand them their cell
[1:06:55] phone
[1:06:56] to entertain them and all we've done is
[1:06:59] reinforced the problem and made it worse
[1:07:03] because now when you're bad and you
[1:07:06] inconvenience me and you upset me I will
[1:07:08] reward you with something you want
[1:07:12] you want a piece of candy if you be
[1:07:13] quiet if you be quiet I'll give you a
[1:07:15] piece of candy
[1:07:17] no you'll be quiet because I said be
[1:07:19] quiet not because I'm giving you a piece
[1:07:20] of candy
[1:07:22] I'm not going to reward you with your
[1:07:24] little popping bubble game because
[1:07:26] you've been a brat in the store
[1:07:29] right because why that might work to get
[1:07:33] you through the store but what's going
[1:07:34] to happen when that taller is 14 15 16
[1:07:36] years old you tried to get through the
[1:07:38] store but I mean you're going to have a
[1:07:40] miserable life because the lack of Love
[1:07:42] is going to come back to bite you
[1:07:48] so what works in the natural and the
[1:07:50] spiritual they they coincide with one
[1:07:52] another God has our best interest in
[1:07:55] mind and God has a long-term objective
[1:07:57] for our life not the short term amen the
[1:08:00] short the short displeasure the pain the
[1:08:03] discomfort amen God is not so much
[1:08:06] discouraged by that he's encouraged by
[1:08:08] where we're going amen by the direction
[1:08:10] we're going in and God doesn't withhold
[1:08:12] chastisement from his children because
[1:08:14] of the end that he has in mind
[1:08:18] foreign
[1:08:19] God said love is corrective if love
[1:08:22] doesn't correct then it's not love
[1:08:25] you see your child down on the street
[1:08:27] and don't give him a little bit of
[1:08:28] posterior protoplasma stimulation
[1:08:33] I hope you know the interpretation of
[1:08:34] that
[1:08:36] if you don't do that you're not a good
[1:08:38] dad but a real mother or dad will turn
[1:08:40] him up and spank him there's the
[1:08:41] interpretation
[1:08:43] let him know he's got to get out of the
[1:08:45] street or perish that's genuine love to
[1:08:47] say junior dear I don't know you may be
[1:08:49] you shouldn't be out there at this time
[1:08:51] of day the end times then the cars are
[1:08:54] going pretty fast oh nonsense you
[1:08:56] sisified Preacher Brother ma'am just
[1:08:58] took it from home right to the pulpit
[1:09:01] oh nonsense you sisified preacher not
[1:09:03] the audacity to take God's word and call
[1:09:05] white white black black right right
[1:09:07] wrong wrong
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:15] so the scripture is teaching us that
[1:09:17] love is corrective
[1:09:20] the prophet's reinforcing them
[1:09:22] he makes this statement remember now
[1:09:24] that we're trying to do brother and
[1:09:26] sister is to come to the house of God as
[1:09:28] a place of Correction
[1:09:30] a place where we sit and feed on the
[1:09:33] word of God and go out different
[1:09:36] and he says in perfect strength and
[1:09:37] perfect weakness and that's what we come
[1:09:39] to church for is to find where our fault
[1:09:42] is
[1:09:44] so we we come to church this brother I'm
[1:09:48] saying in the statement we come to
[1:09:49] church to find where our faults is
[1:09:51] but but also when we come the word the
[1:09:54] word is an encourager and the word is a
[1:09:57] corrector
[1:09:58] you can be corrected and encouraged in
[1:10:00] the same service
[1:10:04] that's what we come to church for is to
[1:10:06] find where our faults is
[1:10:09] and the things that we might better
[1:10:11] ourselves by if we come to church for
[1:10:14] any other objective than this I'm afraid
[1:10:16] we won't get too much out of coming to
[1:10:19] church
[1:10:20] that statement just boggled my mind all
[1:10:23] of a sudden I thought wait a minute I
[1:10:24] got to see that again if I'm coming for
[1:10:27] any other reason but to find my faults
[1:10:29] brother I said I'm afraid we won't get
[1:10:31] too much from coming to church
[1:10:34] if I just come to be told that I'm
[1:10:36] special do you're the bride you're
[1:10:38] predestinator you're special God loves
[1:10:40] you everything's fine you're fine
[1:10:41] everything's fine everything will be
[1:10:43] fine it'll always be fine there's no
[1:10:45] problem with you you're perfect
[1:10:47] that's not what we come to church for
[1:10:49] we need to know that because that gives
[1:10:51] us the encouragement amen that's our
[1:10:53] destination that's how God sees us it
[1:10:55] gives us the encouragement to keep going
[1:10:57] on but what I need to know is where am I
[1:11:00] blind where am I trampling the word of
[1:11:01] God where is the devil taking advantage
[1:11:04] of my emotions so that I can die to that
[1:11:06] and receive the word amen and let the
[1:11:09] word flow
[1:11:10] I need I need the preaching of the
[1:11:12] Gospel to expose those places in my life
[1:11:15] where deception is still laying there
[1:11:17] and I'm not seeing what I'm doing
[1:11:23] amen so it's not so much that we won't
[1:11:26] even hear a hard sermon because it's not
[1:11:28] necessarily A Hard sermon that brings
[1:11:29] the deepest correction
[1:11:31] it can be the gentlest sermon but it's
[1:11:34] the word that brings correction and the
[1:11:36] word that separates our thinking from
[1:11:37] God's thinking
[1:11:40] so it's not all sudden like we have to
[1:11:41] be hard and harsh and critical and point
[1:11:43] on every flow no all we got to do is
[1:11:45] preach the word
[1:11:46] and the word brings the separation and
[1:11:48] all of a sudden you say I was thinking
[1:11:50] wrong that wasn't right that was me that
[1:11:52] wasn't God I thought it was God but now
[1:11:54] I see it's me
[1:11:56] and now I'm going to reject that and
[1:11:58] receive the word
[1:12:01] so I want to read this again if we come
[1:12:03] to church for any other objective then
[1:12:05] want to find our fault any other
[1:12:07] objective than this I'm afraid we won't
[1:12:09] get too much out of coming to church we
[1:12:11] must come to find our weaknesses find
[1:12:13] our bad places
[1:12:15] what if you don't believe you have any
[1:12:16] bad places
[1:12:21] amen then you need to spend more time in
[1:12:24] church
[1:12:26] we must come to find our weaknesses find
[1:12:28] our bad places so see how little we are
[1:12:32] and put our trust in somebody that's
[1:12:34] strong
[1:12:35] then all of a sudden when we find our
[1:12:37] weakness we find our faults then we find
[1:12:39] our solution and our strength is him
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:44] let's go to proverbs 13.
[1:12:46] 24.
[1:12:48] Proverbs chapter 13.
[1:12:56] Proverbs 13 verse 24.
[1:12:59] I'm going to read
[1:13:00] he that spareth his Rod hateth his son
[1:13:06] but he that loveth him chasteneth him be
[1:13:09] times
[1:13:11] this word b times means diligently
[1:13:14] it means sincerely or diligently
[1:13:18] and so
[1:13:20] he
[1:13:21] that spareth is Rod hateth his son
[1:13:26] that that what seems like love oh I just
[1:13:30] can't stand I just can't do it I can't
[1:13:32] bring myself
[1:13:34] that's not love
[1:13:37] oh they're so sweet and they didn't mean
[1:13:39] to yes they meant to
[1:13:44] it's amazing how little they start to
[1:13:46] mean to
[1:13:47] [Laughter]
[1:13:49] far younger than we ever expected them
[1:13:51] to be able to mean to
[1:13:54] but but when we go down that road amen
[1:13:58] we're really not sparing them we're
[1:13:59] sparing us
[1:14:01] and that's a perverted love but if you
[1:14:04] spare the right if he that spareth his
[1:14:06] Rod hateth his son that's the Bible
[1:14:09] that's God's word
[1:14:11] we spare this Rod he hateth
[1:14:14] his son but he that loveth him chases
[1:14:17] him diligently or sincerely or earnestly
[1:14:22] not harshly not hard not extra firm but
[1:14:25] with earnestness that I'm taking my
[1:14:27] responsibility seriously
[1:14:30] and I tell you it's way better when
[1:14:32] they're little than when they're
[1:14:33] standing looking you in the eye it's too
[1:14:35] late then
[1:14:36] so I would be sincere and serious and
[1:14:39] diligent when they're young
[1:14:41] and if you're sincere and diligent and
[1:14:43] serious when they're young you will reap
[1:14:45] a lifetime of benefits from that you
[1:14:47] will spare their soul from hell and you
[1:14:49] will see them moving in the right
[1:14:51] direction because you did what the Bible
[1:14:52] said to do and you demonstrated true
[1:14:55] love
[1:14:57] now I want to be clear and I know you
[1:14:59] all know this but true love is not it's
[1:15:00] not angry and spanking your kids because
[1:15:02] you're in a bad mood you're mad or they
[1:15:03] made you mad that's selfish love
[1:15:06] is love is not and that's what happens
[1:15:09] amen let's go back to the grocery store
[1:15:10] okay we got mom who's telling her kid
[1:15:12] you be quiet you'd be quiet stop it and
[1:15:14] screaming screaming screaming and
[1:15:15] nothing's happening and we tried the
[1:15:17] chewing gum trick we tried the counting
[1:15:19] to 10 or counting the threes and
[1:15:20] Counting the ten getting red-faced
[1:15:22] telling them to shut up we've tried all
[1:15:24] of that and it still doesn't work
[1:15:26] and you've heard it from the produce to
[1:15:28] the milk
[1:15:34] and finally she gets so fed up she
[1:15:37] reaches over and smacks them
[1:15:39] that also wasn't love
[1:15:42] because that's not chastisement that's
[1:15:45] retribution that's anger that's venting
[1:15:48] she's still disciplining for herself
[1:15:52] not for the benefit of that child
[1:15:54] because she's finally come to a Breaking
[1:15:56] Point and now she's far beyond wanting
[1:15:59] to be inconvenienced far beyond being
[1:16:01] embarrassed far beyond all of the now
[1:16:03] and now she lashes out in anger that's
[1:16:05] also perverted love
[1:16:09] but true love is a decision
[1:16:13] true love is not motivated by emotion
[1:16:17] it's motivated by knowing what's right
[1:16:19] and deciding to do what's right
[1:16:22] not till you aggravate me so much now
[1:16:24] I'm willing to not till I've told you 10
[1:16:27] times why didn't you do it when you told
[1:16:28] him once yeah
[1:16:30] once is enough
[1:16:33] see now I'm angry enough now I'm
[1:16:35] inconvenienced enough now I'm upset
[1:16:38] enough that's also not love
[1:16:41] so we can get off on one side of the
[1:16:43] road or we can get off on the other side
[1:16:44] of the road but true love always does
[1:16:47] what's best for the recipient of love
[1:16:49] and true love sacrifice itself for the
[1:16:52] recipient of love and true love is not a
[1:16:55] reaction by emotion
[1:16:57] true love is a reaction by understanding
[1:17:03] Amen brother member says that's the way
[1:17:05] God does love is corrective and that's
[1:17:08] genuine love
[1:17:10] when a preacher stands and lets you
[1:17:12] women Bob your hair and wear paint and
[1:17:13] stuff and don't correct you there is no
[1:17:16] genuine love there
[1:17:17] and won't call it out and let you man
[1:17:20] marry three or four times and all of
[1:17:22] these other things and get by with it
[1:17:24] there is no genuine love there
[1:17:26] let you join a church and Pat you in the
[1:17:28] back and smother you with some Creed
[1:17:30] saying that's all you have to do is join
[1:17:32] the holy church there is no love there
[1:17:35] or either the man has totally lost
[1:17:37] himself and he don't see genuine love is
[1:17:40] corrective and brings you back to the
[1:17:42] word of God
[1:17:44] this is key
[1:17:45] genuine love is corrective and brings
[1:17:48] you back to the word of God so what's
[1:17:50] the objective to restore us to the word
[1:17:52] of God what's correction from the pulpit
[1:17:55] for amen not to make the preacher look
[1:17:57] good
[1:18:00] that's the wrong motivation that's
[1:18:02] perverted love
[1:18:04] amen so if correction from the pulpit is
[1:18:06] coming in order for for the congregation
[1:18:09] to make the pastor look a certain way or
[1:18:12] be held in a certain respect that's
[1:18:14] perverted love but true love will bring
[1:18:16] a correction to bring us all back to the
[1:18:19] word of God because that's where we
[1:18:21] Prosper grow where we're safe where
[1:18:23] we're saved where people are born again
[1:18:27] amen that's true motivation of
[1:18:30] Correction
[1:18:32] let's go to Hebrews chapter 12.
[1:18:47] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 4.
[1:19:02] in Hebrews
[1:19:03] 12 and verse 4 he says you have not yet
[1:19:06] resisted in the blood striving against
[1:19:08] sin
[1:19:11] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[1:19:12] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:19:14] my son despise not now the chastening of
[1:19:17] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[1:19:19] of him for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:19:21] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[1:19:24] he receiveth if you endure chastening
[1:19:27] God deals with you as with sons for what
[1:19:29] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[1:19:31] but if you be without chastisement where
[1:19:34] of all our partakers then you are
[1:19:36] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[1:19:38] have had fathers of our flesh which
[1:19:40] corrected us and we gave them reverence
[1:19:42] shall we not much rather be in
[1:19:44] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:19:46] and live
[1:19:47] for they verily for a few days chasing
[1:19:49] us after their own pleasure but he for
[1:19:52] our Prophet that we might be partakers
[1:19:55] of his holiness
[1:19:58] amen why did God chasten
[1:20:02] for our prophet
[1:20:04] not for his for ours that we might be
[1:20:07] partakers of his Holiness he chastened
[1:20:09] us
[1:20:10] for our Prophets
[1:20:12] he chastened us and he chastens us
[1:20:15] because he loves us
[1:20:19] that's the motivation of chastisement
[1:20:23] if chastisement in the spiritual in the
[1:20:25] church in the home if there's
[1:20:27] chastisement for any other reason then
[1:20:29] that chastisement is wrong because that
[1:20:31] chastisement shall be based on love
[1:20:35] and it shall be for the benefit of the
[1:20:38] one being chastened
[1:20:43] if we look in Jeremiah We're Not Gonna
[1:20:45] I'm not gonna have you turn there
[1:20:46] because we're running low on time but in
[1:20:49] Jeremiah God begins to tell Jeremiah
[1:20:51] because Israel forsaken me because
[1:20:53] they've turned their back on me they're
[1:20:55] going into bondage and he's bringing
[1:20:56] Babylon in to carry them away
[1:20:59] but he says to Jeremiah in chapter 29
[1:21:02] verse 10 he said for thus saith the Lord
[1:21:03] that after 70 years be accomplished at
[1:21:06] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[1:21:08] good word toward you in causing you to
[1:21:10] return to this place he's bringing them
[1:21:13] the chastisement he's correcting them
[1:21:15] with the rod of man and he's carrying
[1:21:16] them out of the land and carrying them
[1:21:18] captive which he said he would do all
[1:21:20] the way back and Moses when when he gave
[1:21:22] the law
[1:21:24] now he's keeping his word amen and he's
[1:21:27] causing him to go out but he's going out
[1:21:29] they're going out with their return in
[1:21:31] his mind
[1:21:33] he why he wants to restore fellowship
[1:21:35] and he wants to bring them back into the
[1:21:37] right order but he must bring
[1:21:39] chastisement but the chastisement has an
[1:21:41] end in mind
[1:21:44] he said after 70 years be accomplished
[1:21:46] at Babylon I will visit you and perform
[1:21:48] my good word toward you and causing you
[1:21:49] to return to this place for I know the
[1:21:52] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[1:21:54] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:21:55] evil to give you an expected him then
[1:21:58] shall you call upon me and you shall go
[1:22:00] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[1:22:02] you and you shall seek me and find me
[1:22:04] when you shall search for me with all of
[1:22:05] your heart and I will be found of you
[1:22:08] saith the Lord and I will turn away your
[1:22:10] captivity and I will gather you from All
[1:22:12] Nations and from all the places whether
[1:22:14] I have driven you saith the Lord and I
[1:22:17] will bring you again into the place once
[1:22:19] I caused you to be carried away captive
[1:22:21] he's bringing chastisement but why so
[1:22:24] that he can restore Fellowship when you
[1:22:26] love me with all of your heart and seek
[1:22:28] me with all of your heart I will bring
[1:22:29] you back to this place I'm only sending
[1:22:32] you out so I can bring you back in a
[1:22:34] different state than you're in now
[1:22:35] because you're self-destructing now
[1:22:37] you're destroying yourselves now amen I
[1:22:40] must send you out so you can have a
[1:22:43] change of heart and change your mind so
[1:22:44] that I can bring you back and when you
[1:22:46] call or answer because I have thoughts
[1:22:49] towards you thoughts of good and not of
[1:22:51] evil
[1:22:52] all they could see was evil amen
[1:22:55] Nebuchadnezzar's Army coming in Amen to
[1:22:57] destroy villages to take lives to carry
[1:23:00] away captive they saw evil but God says
[1:23:02] this isn't for evil this is for good
[1:23:05] and my end in this chastisement is a
[1:23:08] restoration of Fellowship
[1:23:11] to bring you back to the word
[1:23:15] now let's look at First Corinthians
[1:23:23] First Corinthians
[1:23:30] chapter 5.
[1:23:36] First Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1.
[1:23:42] it is reported commonly there's there is
[1:23:45] fornication among you and such
[1:23:47] fornication is not so much as named
[1:23:49] among the Gentiles that one should have
[1:23:51] his father's wife
[1:23:52] and you're puffed up and have not rather
[1:23:54] mourned that he that hath done this deed
[1:23:57] might be taken away from among you
[1:23:59] Thrive early is absent in the body but
[1:24:01] present and spirit have judged already
[1:24:03] as though I were present concerning him
[1:24:04] that has so done this deed
[1:24:06] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:08] when you are gathered together in my
[1:24:10] spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan
[1:24:15] for the destruction of the flesh that
[1:24:17] the spirit may be saved in the day of
[1:24:20] the Lord Jesus
[1:24:21] your glory is not good know you not that
[1:24:23] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[1:24:26] here we come into a matter of church
[1:24:28] discipline where there's a grievous sin
[1:24:30] amongst them and they hadn't done
[1:24:32] anything about it and the fact they
[1:24:34] hadn't done anything about it Paul
[1:24:35] seizes them being puffed up
[1:24:37] they're proud
[1:24:39] not humble before the word of God not
[1:24:41] humble before almighty God in obedience
[1:24:43] but they're proud
[1:24:45] and he's saying that you should put one
[1:24:47] out and deliver that one to Satan and
[1:24:51] that seems so hard and so evil but he
[1:24:53] says deliver that one to Satan for the
[1:24:55] destruction of the flesh
[1:24:57] so that the soul might be saved
[1:25:00] what was the whole purpose of of
[1:25:02] chastisement in a church setting and
[1:25:04] church discipline was for the saving of
[1:25:06] the Soul
[1:25:07] the whole purpose is for a real genuine
[1:25:10] love it's not love to let the sin remain
[1:25:13] amen and think somebody think that
[1:25:15] they're okay they're destroying
[1:25:16] themselves and destroying the people
[1:25:18] around them
[1:25:19] but true love says no we can't do this
[1:25:22] we must deliver you if you won't repent
[1:25:24] we must deliver you unto Satan amen for
[1:25:27] the destruction of your flesh that's all
[1:25:30] harsh amen but that's what God did to
[1:25:32] his children in order to save them
[1:25:36] and so sometimes chastisement seems so
[1:25:39] harsh and so hard amen but true
[1:25:41] chastisement is an act of true love
[1:25:46] amen churches today won't call out any
[1:25:49] sin
[1:25:50] not just Grievous and no sin they'll
[1:25:54] allow adultery and fornication and and
[1:25:56] and and and multiple marriages and all
[1:25:59] of these things just continue on and on
[1:26:01] and on and on and on Amen and then
[1:26:03] constantly amen they're told God loves
[1:26:05] you God blesses you God is your servant
[1:26:08] he he he wants to take care of you and
[1:26:10] do everything for you and make your life
[1:26:12] easy and make your life good and no
[1:26:15] correction no correction no correction
[1:26:16] and the people are being destroyed from
[1:26:19] within
[1:26:22] all kinds of devils are permitted to
[1:26:25] operate in their lives and take over
[1:26:26] them and bring destruction and keep the
[1:26:28] promises of God everything that's
[1:26:30] promised from the pulpit is not coming
[1:26:32] to pass because because there's no sin
[1:26:34] being purged out of the camp and the
[1:26:36] devil is allowed to sit right there and
[1:26:38] take advantage of the open door
[1:26:45] that's not love
[1:26:47] but it's called love
[1:26:50] they'll call themselves a Grace Church
[1:26:51] we're a Grace Church not a law Church
[1:26:55] Well a true Grace Church will have Grace
[1:26:57] enough to tell the truth
[1:27:00] because that's love
[1:27:02] love is not going to let you sit there
[1:27:05] in your sin and be destroyed but tell
[1:27:07] you this is not the word of God and if
[1:27:10] you can't line up to the word of God you
[1:27:12] can't stay here because you have to go
[1:27:14] amen and get your chastisement so that
[1:27:17] your soul can be saved because we're not
[1:27:18] going to let your soul die in a pew
[1:27:22] [Applause]
[1:27:24] it's called love it's promoting death in
[1:27:27] pews you die in the church because they
[1:27:31] love you too much to correct you
[1:27:34] that's not love
[1:27:36] that's promoting death spiritual death
[1:27:39] going on in churches while praises and
[1:27:42] blessings are being showered upon the
[1:27:44] congregation
[1:27:46] so God help us never to get down to this
[1:27:49] path to where we just want membership
[1:27:50] and we just want people and we don't
[1:27:52] want hard things and we don't want to
[1:27:53] deal with hard things and we don't want
[1:27:55] to say hard things amen because that's
[1:27:57] not love that's only a selfish love that
[1:27:59] doesn't want to go through the
[1:28:01] difficulty of tackling a difficult
[1:28:02] situation
[1:28:04] but love will sacrifice self for the
[1:28:07] benefit of its recipient
[1:28:09] and sometimes it doesn't look like love
[1:28:11] but it's love
[1:28:13] because that's how God loves and if I
[1:28:16] want to be like God I'm going to have to
[1:28:18] act like God
[1:28:20] many times we have to do things we don't
[1:28:22] want to do
[1:28:24] brother bear says sometimes
[1:28:27] I scold and I go back home
[1:28:29] and I just think Lord what did I do it
[1:28:31] for
[1:28:32] this is the prophet of God he's going
[1:28:34] home struggling
[1:28:35] oh I'm so glad he said this because I've
[1:28:37] been in this situation so many times why
[1:28:40] did I say it like that why did I have to
[1:28:42] say it it seemed so hard it seems so
[1:28:43] harsh and when I see brother Branham
[1:28:45] struggling with this it does me a world
[1:28:47] of good
[1:28:48] sometimes I score and I go back home and
[1:28:50] I just think Lord what did I do it for
[1:28:53] but it's because I love them if I have
[1:28:55] to scold my little boy for running out
[1:28:57] on the street he'll get killed if I
[1:28:59] don't get him off the street sometimes I
[1:29:01] have to whip him correct him say sun
[1:29:03] South the street it's not because I
[1:29:05] don't love that child it's because I do
[1:29:06] love him that's the way God has to do us
[1:29:09] scold us Shake us make us real true
[1:29:12] persons that lets his child just do
[1:29:14] anything is not a good parent
[1:29:18] now let's go to First Corinthians 11.
[1:29:27] First Corinthians 11 and we read this
[1:29:30] every month at Communion
[1:29:34] would pick it up in verse
[1:29:39] 31.
[1:29:41] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:29:43] should not be judged
[1:29:44] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:29:47] of the Lord
[1:29:48] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:29:51] world
[1:29:52] why does God chasten us
[1:29:55] so he doesn't lose us
[1:29:58] so that we are not condemned with the
[1:30:00] world
[1:30:01] why does God chasten us
[1:30:04] because he won't lose us
[1:30:07] that's how much he loves us
[1:30:09] he loves us enough to chasten us
[1:30:12] he loved Israel enough to allow the king
[1:30:15] of Babylon to come
[1:30:17] destroy burn
[1:30:19] kill and take away captive
[1:30:22] that's how much God loved them
[1:30:25] they didn't understand love
[1:30:27] sometimes we don't understand love
[1:30:30] but love is always looking to the end
[1:30:32] not to the present and love is willing
[1:30:35] to forego comfort in the present for
[1:30:38] what's best in the end
[1:30:43] Proverbs 3 11. we'll finish with this
[1:30:45] scripture Proverbs 3 11.
[1:30:48] says my son despise not the chastening
[1:30:51] of the Lord
[1:30:53] neither be weary of his correction
[1:30:56] for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth
[1:30:58] even as a father the son in whom he
[1:31:01] delighteth
[1:31:03] why does the father create the son
[1:31:04] because he loves that son and delights
[1:31:06] in him
[1:31:07] why does God bring correction our way
[1:31:08] because he Delights in US
[1:31:10] and he will not lose us when we are
[1:31:13] judged we are chasing of the Lord so
[1:31:15] that we will not be
[1:31:17] condemned with the world
[1:31:19] I thank God who loves me like that
[1:31:23] I thank God for a father who would
[1:31:24] correct me my dad made lots of mistakes
[1:31:26] but he corrected me and I'm thankful for
[1:31:29] it thankful for a mother who corrected
[1:31:31] me I'm thankful for people who've told
[1:31:33] me the truth I'm thankful for people in
[1:31:36] this congregation I'm thankful for
[1:31:37] preachers who have preached the truth
[1:31:39] and are thankful that it raked me over
[1:31:41] the cold sometimes and I left wounded
[1:31:43] and I left bleeding from a thousand
[1:31:45] stabs amen but I'm here today saying I'm
[1:31:47] thankful for those preachers who preach
[1:31:49] the truth
[1:31:50] I'm thankful when they didn't hold back
[1:31:52] I'm thankful for hearing the truth
[1:31:54] because the truth has Set Me Free from
[1:31:56] the bondage the devil was bringing in my
[1:31:58] life
[1:31:59] and I'm thankful true love is corrective
[1:32:04] amen let's all stand
[1:32:09] musicians if you'll come like if you'll
[1:32:11] come please let's bow our heads together
[1:32:13] and pray
[1:32:15] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[1:32:17] for your goodness and your mercy
[1:32:20] God we can see
[1:32:22] your tender hand
[1:32:24] didn't always appear tender at the time
[1:32:28] as your Prophet taught us about the
[1:32:30] tender hand of Jehovah
[1:32:31] driving your children back to the
[1:32:33] promised land was the Holocaust
[1:32:36] nobody in the world could see that as
[1:32:39] love
[1:32:40] but oh God you are looking at the end
[1:32:43] not at the present
[1:32:45] you weren't looking at a snapshot of
[1:32:46] time you were looking at the direction
[1:32:48] you were moving in and that you wanted
[1:32:50] to bring your children back to their
[1:32:52] land so that you could fulfill the
[1:32:54] promise and bring Redemption
[1:32:57] God what looked like the worst thing
[1:32:59] that could happen to them was the very
[1:33:01] best thing that could happen to them as
[1:33:02] a nation
[1:33:04] for Israel will be saved as a nation in
[1:33:07] their Homeland when the 144 thousand
[1:33:09] receive you
[1:33:11] God help us to change our thinking
[1:33:14] from denominational thinking from
[1:33:16] humanistic thinking and Lord let us have
[1:33:19] the mind of Christ
[1:33:21] let your word Lord change our
[1:33:23] understanding and help us to understand
[1:33:25] what true love is and what true
[1:33:27] correction is
[1:33:29] may we as parents administer it
[1:33:31] correctly maybe as a church and Minister
[1:33:33] correctly may I as a pastor and Minister
[1:33:35] correctly Lord put your love in our
[1:33:38] heart
[1:33:39] and may your love be perfected in US
[1:33:43] may we never allow a perverted love to
[1:33:46] trample over true love
[1:33:48] but may your true love cast out all
[1:33:50] other love
[1:33:52] may we come to the Pinnacle to the peak
[1:33:55] to the fullness of the stature of Christ
[1:33:58] may we walk as you walked in this earth
[1:34:00] now may you walk in Us in this earth
[1:34:04] displaying your attributes your fullness
[1:34:07] and your bride in the end time
[1:34:10] maybe we'd be willing to do the hard
[1:34:11] thing the self-sacrificing thing
[1:34:14] in order to display true love
[1:34:17] we love you father
[1:34:18] help us God as we go we can't do this
[1:34:21] without you
[1:34:22] we cannot do this in ourselves and our
[1:34:25] strength it's insufficient
[1:34:28] but we're looking to you the strong one
[1:34:30] the mighty one who brought the promise
[1:34:32] and by these promises you've made us
[1:34:34] partakers of your divine nature
[1:34:36] and we're preaching because this is your
[1:34:38] method we're preaching because this is
[1:34:39] your promise
[1:34:41] that by the preaching through the
[1:34:42] fivefold ministry you'll bring us into
[1:34:44] the stature of a perfect man
[1:34:46] and we're exercising your word and
[1:34:48] preaching the word believing that it
[1:34:50] will do exactly what you said it will do
[1:34:52] and it'll bring us to this perfect love
[1:34:55] we love your God we surrender to you in
[1:34:58] a greater way
[1:35:00] have your way in us now as we part
[1:35:02] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
