[0:00] And it came to pass at the time of the
[0:03] offering of the evening sacrifice
[0:07] &gt;&gt; in the evening time.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; In the evening time after he repaired
[0:13] the altar of the Lord when the fire
[0:15] revival fires died down there was a
[0:17] drought and when God had sent him back
[0:20] because there was going to be rain.
[0:21] Amen.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; You see why, brother? Do you see why the
[0:25] Holy Spirit pointed him to this?
[0:29] &gt;&gt; In the e time of the evening sacrifice,
[0:31] Elijah the prophet came near and said,
[0:33] Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
[0:35] let it be known this day that thou art
[0:38] God in Israel, and that I am thy
[0:40] servant, and that I have done all these
[0:41] things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord.
[0:44] Hear me that this people may know that
[0:46] thou art the Lord God and that thou has
[0:48] turned their heart back again.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; What is the ministry of Elijah at the
[0:54] end times? To turn the hearts of the
[0:55] children back to the fathers.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Verse 38. Then the fire of God fell and
[1:04] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:05] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:08] licked up the water that was in the
[1:10] trench. And when all the people saw it,
[1:11] they fell on their faces and they said,
[1:13] "The Lord, he is God. The Lord, he is
[1:16] God."
[1:18] &gt;&gt; God showed himself. Amen. Let's go to
[1:20] verse 41 now.
[1:22] And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up,
[1:26] eat, and drink, for there is a sound of
[1:29] abundance of rain."
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it were when the word was
[1:33] restored, when Elijah came out of
[1:35] hiding, when he come to Mount Carmel
[1:37] showdown, when he brought him back to
[1:38] the original faith, when he brought him
[1:40] back from mixed religion to pure
[1:42] religion, Amen. And he did it all at
[1:44] God's word and the impossible was done.
[1:46] Then he says, "Now the rain's going to
[1:48] fall." So Ahab went up to to eat and to
[1:52] drink.
[1:54] And Elijah went up to top of Carmel and
[1:56] he cast himself down upon the earth and
[1:59] put his face between his knees. And he
[2:01] said to his servant, "Go up now. Look
[2:02] toward the sea." And he went up and he
[2:04] looked and he said, "There's nothing."
[2:06] He said, "Go again seven times."
[2:10] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass at the seventh time
[2:13] in the seventh church age.
[2:16] This
[2:16] &gt;&gt; has to do with the seventh seal.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; The seventh time that he said, "Behold,
[2:22] there arises a little cloud out of the
[2:25] sea like a man's hand." And he said, "Go
[2:27] up, say unto him, prepare thy chariot
[2:30] and get thee down, that the rain stopped
[2:32] thee not." Amen. What was the sign that
[2:35] the rain was coming? There was a cloud.
[2:37] Amen. There was a cloud. Amen. When And
[2:40] the seventh time, the seventh time he
[2:43] looked and the seventh under the seventh
[2:45] seal in the seventh church, there was a
[2:47] cloud that announced that rain was
[2:49] coming.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, Amen. God mean by the
[2:55] Holy Spirit. Brother Brandham is sitting
[2:57] in this spot where he doesn't know what
[2:58] the next step is. He doesn't know how to
[3:00] get there. He doesn't know what's going.
[3:02] So the Holy Spirit says, "Listen, you're
[3:04] just in a place like Moses was." Amen.
[3:06] Waiting for something. You're in a place
[3:08] like John the Baptist was waiting to
[3:10] come out and announce the Messiah.
[3:11] You're where Paul was waiting to come
[3:13] out with the true word. Amen. You're
[3:15] where Elijah was waiting to come and
[3:17] bring the Mount Carmel showdown so that
[3:19] the rain can fall again because it's
[3:21] time for the latter rain revival.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26] Oh, the spirit knew what he was saying
[3:28] when he told brother man. And brother
[3:29] Ben picked it up and said, "That's
[3:31] exactly what I was looking for. That's
[3:33] just it. That's the answer to my
[3:35] question.
