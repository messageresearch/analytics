[19:38] 12 baby year I want one per month one
[19:40] year I'm still I we haven't achieved
[19:44] that yet but we're looking forward to it
[19:47] amen amen Let's uh let's turn in our
[19:50] Bibles to Colossians chapter 3 want to
[19:53] say welcome home to brother Emanuel it's
[19:54] good to have you back in the service
[19:56] brother you're always missed when you're
[19:58] not here but I asked brother Emanuel to
[20:00] take the Wednesday night service to give
[20:02] us a little report on the trip and to
[20:03] minister the word and he accepted so
[20:06] Lord willing this Wednesday we'll be
[20:07] hearing from him also remember brother
[20:10] Gabe and his family as they're away
[20:12] brother Gabe's ministering for Nathaniel
[20:13] sias up in Lorraine up near Cleveland
[20:17] and so I'm sure that they're enjoying
[20:19] themselves there they'll be traveling
[20:20] back today so remember them also really
[20:23] enjoyed the update for brother Mike God
[20:26] is so good I was able to speak to him
[20:28] yesterday and he was in good spirits and
[20:30] happy and cheerful and it was just so
[20:32] good to hear his voice and I'm so
[20:34] thankful to God for his Healing Hand
[20:37] amen for his promise so God is good also
[20:41] appreciate the song sister chrisy that
[20:42] was wonderful and very timely amen it
[20:45] encouraged me greatly so God is
[20:48] good Colossians chapter
[20:51] 3 verse
[20:55] one says if you then be risen with
[20:57] Christ seek those things which are above
[21:00] where Christ sth on the right hand of
[21:02] God set your affection on things above
[21:04] not on things on the earth for you are
[21:07] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[21:09] God when Christ who is our life shall
[21:12] appear then shall you also appear with
[21:14] him in glory amen God bless you as you
[21:17] have your seats may the Lord bless us as
[21:19] we look into his
[21:21] word so we see that the Apostle Paul now
[21:25] is encouraging the church he says uh
[21:29] uh if you then be risen with Christ see
[21:32] those things seek those things which
[21:34] were above so we've risen with Christ
[21:36] and seated with with him in Heavenly
[21:38] places in Christ Jesus is that correct
[21:41] so that's where we're at that's our
[21:42] position with Christ but it's also our
[21:44] destination it's also should be our
[21:46] Focus right and that's what he's telling
[21:49] the church here in Colossians he said if
[21:52] the if you then be risen with Christ
[21:54] seek those things which are above where
[21:56] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[21:58] your affection on things above not on
[22:00] things on the earth for you are dead and
[22:03] your life is hid with Christ in God when
[22:06] Christ to is our life shall appear then
[22:08] shall he also appear with him in glory
[22:11] so this is a great instruction he's
[22:13] telling us don't put our affections here
[22:16] put our affections there amen where we
[22:18] are seated with Christ Jesus because
[22:21] Christ is our
[22:22] life and and I find that that is a
[22:26] constant struggle uh For Me Maybe maybe
[22:28] not for you but it's a constant struggle
[22:30] to struggle against the the the this
[22:33] flesh in this life to keep my affections
[22:36] centered on the things that are right
[22:38] they keep focusing on where my life
[22:40] truly is and what my life really is amen
[22:44] and and so for a subject today I'd like
[22:46] to discuss sacrifice or
[22:49] selfishness um since the last message
[22:51] that brother Benjamin seabolt preached
[22:53] on selfishness I've been going over and
[22:55] over and over and again and and uh and
[22:57] I've just been uh focused on it really
[23:00] I've been focused on it and uh doing a
[23:02] lot of thinking and realizing that
[23:04] that's my biggest
[23:06] problem it may not be yours but it's
[23:10] mine self-focus selfishness self-love
[23:14] self self self self self and it's a
[23:18] constant struggle and it's a constant
[23:19] struggle in Leo
[23:20] deia and and so I wanted to just take a
[23:23] look at it and read some things out of
[23:25] the scriptures and read some things that
[23:26] brother brandham said and see if we can
[23:29] get our Focus realigned I think we
[23:32] constantly need to realign our Focus so
[23:34] let's turn to the Book of Matthew
[23:36] together Matthew 16 and I am going to
[23:39] read a lot of scriptures and I'm going
[23:41] to read several quotes because I want to
[23:43] look at what the Bible says and what the
[23:45] message is showing us on this subject
[23:48] and not just offer my opinion because
[23:51] remember this is my problem too in my
[23:52] opinion probably no
[23:54] good I want the word Matthew 6 16
[23:59] Matthew 16:
[24:01] 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If
[24:04] any man will come after me let him deny
[24:06] himself and take up his cross and follow
[24:09] me for whosoever will save his life
[24:11] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[24:13] his life for my sake shall find it for
[24:16] what is a man what is a man profited if
[24:19] he shall gain the whole world and lose
[24:21] his own soul or what shall a man give in
[24:24] exchange for his soul Jesus is giving
[24:27] such
[24:29] good instruction such
[24:32] truth if a man will come after me let
[24:34] him deny
[24:36] himself and take up his cross and follow
[24:39] me when he says take up his cross we all
[24:42] know what a cross is used for it's a
[24:45] it's a place of uh
[24:47] execution it's a place where a a victim
[24:51] a guilty victim is nailed Amen to uh uh
[24:55] to be punished and it's a place of death
[24:58] and he says take up your cross and
[25:00] follow me and so that's an instruction
[25:02] for us to take up our cross that means
[25:05] we should have a place where we nail
[25:07] ourselves amen uh a place where this
[25:10] flesh is sacrificed and that we should
[25:12] follow him for whosoever will save his
[25:14] life shall lose it and whosoever will
[25:16] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[25:20] we find that's the that's where the
[25:21] struggle really comes because it's a
[25:23] struggle for life because we look in
[25:26] nature and all of nature is struggling
[25:27] for life life we see every animal every
[25:29] plant everything around us is struggling
[25:32] for Life struggling for breath
[25:33] struggling to eat struggling to to drink
[25:36] struggling for life just to live to
[25:38] continue life amen they're struggling
[25:40] for it but but Jesus is teaching us
[25:43] something different we're not to
[25:44] struggle for this life but we're to
[25:46] struggle for real
[25:47] life and strive for real life and let
[25:50] this life take care of itself but the
[25:53] problem is that we're stuck here and and
[25:55] and we still find ourselves in that
[25:57] struggle for life and it happens to all
[25:59] of us and it has a way of creeping in
[26:01] and we need to keep it at Bay with the
[26:03] word of God and realize I'm not I don't
[26:05] need to take care of myself I need to
[26:06] give myself to Christ and Christ will
[26:08] take care of me he's promised to provide
[26:11] for me and I'm sure he'll do a better
[26:12] job than I will do and I've got to stop
[26:14] focusing so much on how to make
[26:16] provision for myself and I need to lose
[26:19] myself and find myself in Christ and
[26:21] give all my attention to real life and
[26:24] focus on things that are above not the
[26:26] things on the earth and God will take
[26:27] care of of all of these
[26:29] things but we say that we say it we mean
[26:32] it we believe it amen but the problem is
[26:35] we're stuck in
[26:37] flesh so it's not that we don't believe
[26:39] it it's not that we don't mean it when
[26:40] we say it but but the next time that a
[26:43] bill comes in and there's not enough
[26:45] money in the bank to pay the bill then
[26:46] you'll recognize you're still in flesh
[26:48] and you're still struggling to struggle
[26:50] yes sir amen but thanks be to God he's
[26:53] made a promise let's go to Mark chapter
[26:55] 10 together
[26:59] Mark chapter
[27:04] 10 and verse
[27:10] 21 this is when uh Jesus is having a
[27:15] discussion with the Rich Young Ruler who
[27:16] comes to him and asks what he must do to
[27:18] inherit eternal life and they have these
[27:20] discussion back and forth and finally it
[27:23] comes down to verse 21 and says then
[27:25] Jesus beholding him loved him and sudden
[27:28] him one thing thou lackest go thy way
[27:30] sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to
[27:32] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[27:34] heaven and come take up the cross and
[27:37] follow me and he was sad at that saying
[27:41] and went away grieved for he had great
[27:44] possessions this is a this story is a
[27:47] travesty because this man comes to Jesus
[27:50] who is the Prince of Life and this Rich
[27:52] Young Ruler comes to Jesus and asks what
[27:54] must I do to inherit eternal life and
[27:55] Jesus tells him amen and he tells him to
[27:58] keep the Commandments he said I've done
[27:59] that from my youth and Jesus beholding
[28:02] him loves him so the next thing he's
[28:05] going to tell the man is out of a love
[28:06] for him and out of his love for him he
[28:10] says there's one thing that you're
[28:11] lacking sell all that you have and give
[28:13] to the poor take up your cross and
[28:15] follow me and then it says I want to
[28:18] come back down and read it together says
[28:21] take up the cross and follow me verse 22
[28:23] and he was sad at that saying
[28:28] and went away
[28:31] grieved he asked Jesus what must I do to
[28:34] inherit eternal life Jesus now is giving
[28:37] him the answer there's one thing you're
[28:39] lacking this is it do this and you'll
[28:42] have what you
[28:43] desire he says sell all you have given
[28:46] to the poor take up your cross follow me
[28:49] and all of a sudden the man was sad and
[28:51] the question is why was he sad he was
[28:53] just given the key to eternal life he
[28:56] was just given the ticket to he asked
[28:58] for he asked for eternal life now Jesus
[29:00] was telling them the one thing he lacked
[29:02] if you do this and it and what we
[29:05] realized is this man had the same
[29:06] problem that we all struggle with and
[29:08] fight with this man loved himself more
[29:11] than he loved eternal life right amen
[29:13] right when it comes down to it nuts and
[29:16] bolts that's it friends and that's the
[29:19] problem with self that's the problem
[29:21] with this flesh that's the problem with
[29:22] hybridization that's the problem with
[29:24] this world we live in he wanted eternal
[29:27] life as long as he didn't have to give
[29:29] up anything to have eternal life because
[29:32] he was already able to keep the
[29:35] Commandments he's done it since he was a
[29:36] child so because he was already able to
[29:39] do that for him that was an easy
[29:42] exchange for eternal
[29:43] life when Jesus says honor thy father
[29:46] and the mother you know the Commandments
[29:48] have no uh other God but but God
[29:50] Almighty and all of these things he
[29:52] starts to tell the Commandments and he
[29:53] says I've done that check check check
[29:55] I've got that that was an easy exchange
[29:57] because he was rais raised that way he
[29:58] was raised in that life and he could do
[30:01] that for eternal life but when it really
[30:03] came down to it when he could give up
[30:05] himself his reputation his funds his
[30:08] security his support his promise of food
[30:11] for tomorrow when he could give up all
[30:13] of that which is an absolute denying of
[30:16] self see it wasn't it it it was to give
[30:19] up amen what made him who he
[30:22] was right remember he had a title
[30:24] brother R gave him a title the Rich
[30:26] Young
[30:26] Ruler and he had he had uh because of
[30:30] his position in the community and in the
[30:33] synagogue and his wealth and because of
[30:35] all of this he had a certain title a
[30:37] certain identity and that identity
[30:39] brought him a certain amount of respect
[30:41] and then the finances the economy had
[30:43] brought him a certain amount of security
[30:45] and he wasn't willing to give all of
[30:47] that up for eternal
[30:51] life and he walked away
[30:54] sad and grieved
[30:59] for he had great
[31:05] possessions set your affections on
[31:08] things
[31:09] above he had great possessions but what
[31:12] good were those
[31:14] possessions brother B takes us later in
[31:16] the story and we find out that this same
[31:18] man later in life had wealth had the
[31:21] great economy had Barns and he had to
[31:23] tear down Barns and big Builder bigger
[31:26] Barns and his Harvest was so great great
[31:28] and his barns were so full says Soul
[31:30] take thy
[31:32] rest and Jesus said thou fool th knowest
[31:36] not that tonight thy life shall be taken
[31:38] from thee and we find the man in hell
[31:41] when he lifts up his eyes and he sees
[31:43] Abraham across the chasm and he sees
[31:45] Lazarus the poor beggar man in the bosom
[31:47] of of Abraham and and he asked that he
[31:50] might just dip his finger and cold water
[31:52] and quench the burning of his tongue and
[31:54] me we find that he he he could not give
[31:57] give up self to have real life yes and
[32:02] we find the result of that is this man
[32:05] in
[32:06] Hell lifting up his eyes and seeing
[32:08] Lazarus who had
[32:10] nothing now has
[32:13] everything amen so the man was sad and
[32:18] went away grieved I don't know what it
[32:20] is about that scripture but it tears me
[32:23] up every time I read it he was that
[32:26] close he was there with the person of
[32:29] eternal life he came in contact with
[32:32] life and was told what to do that he
[32:34] might inherit life and he walked away
[32:37] because he couldn't sacrifice
[32:41] himself see we love the
[32:45] idea of Jesus Christ being the
[32:49] sacrifice taking my place taking my
[32:52] shame Taking My Punishment we love that
[32:55] idea because we couldn't pay the price
[32:57] we couldn't endure
[32:58] and he did it in our
[33:01] place and we love that concept and we
[33:03] love that idea but we have to realize it
[33:06] doesn't mean that we have no
[33:09] sacrifice that we have no suffering that
[33:11] we have no giving up of Our Lives he
[33:15] took the place for us to purchase for us
[33:16] eternal life we could never take that
[33:18] place so he took it for
[33:20] us but Jesus still said take up your
[33:23] cross and follow
[33:24] me so we act like because he took that
[33:27] POS position that there's no cross for
[33:29] us to
[33:31] Bear let's go to Romans
[33:36] 8:12 Romans chapter
[33:48] 8 Romans chapter
[33:54] 8 verse 12
[33:57] says therefore brethren we are debtors
[33:59] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[34:02] for if you lived after the flesh you
[34:04] shall die but if you through the spirit
[34:06] do mortify the Deeds of the body you
[34:09] shall
[34:10] live amen we are not to live after the
[34:14] flesh if we live after the flesh we'll
[34:17] die but we live in the
[34:20] flesh this is where it gets tight we
[34:22] live in the flesh we're human beings we
[34:25] still have emotion we still have
[34:27] feelings we still have fears we still
[34:28] have all the things that come with
[34:31] living in hybrid flesh and living in
[34:33] this world and we have we all we all
[34:35] suffer we're all subject to these same
[34:37] things amen but we're not to live after
[34:39] the flesh because if we live after the
[34:41] flesh we'll
[34:43] die but if you through the spirit do
[34:45] mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall
[34:48] live let's go back to Matthew 6 I'm
[34:51] sorry we're flipping back and forth but
[34:53] it's good for us it's good exercise
[34:55] Matthew chapter 6 and I really I I'm I'm
[34:58] not going to apologize for reading a lot
[35:00] of scriptures because this is exactly
[35:01] what I want to do I want to take my time
[35:03] and read the
[35:07] scriptures Matthew chapter 6 ver
[35:11] 25 says therefore I say unto you take no
[35:14] thought for your life what you shall eat
[35:16] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[35:18] body what you shall put on is not the
[35:21] life more than meat and the body than
[35:25] reignment I love that statement first he
[35:28] tells us don't be so
[35:30] preoccupied with what you're going to be
[35:32] where you're going to live what house
[35:33] you're going to have a car you're going
[35:35] to
[35:36] drive and I say that as one who's been
[35:39] very
[35:41] preoccupied like we don't we don't say
[35:43] it as though we're immune from this is
[35:45] like what what you got to do is this and
[35:47] no I get very
[35:50] preoccupied there are some days I can't
[35:52] wait to get home and eat supper and I
[35:54] that's all I think about
[35:58] but we it goes deeper than that how will
[36:00] we provide for our kids how will we get
[36:02] their education how will we this and
[36:03] what about our future and what about
[36:05] retirement and what about and what about
[36:07] and what about and you can't stop
[36:08] thinking about that and also you can't
[36:11] stop being responsible enough to take
[36:13] what God's given you and lay up store
[36:14] for the future because that's also part
[36:16] of the word that's also our
[36:18] responsibility so it's not all wrong the
[36:20] problem is when that becomes a focus and
[36:22] that Focus becomes a priority and that
[36:24] priority begins to dictate how we act in
[36:27] life and what we think about and begin
[36:28] to detract from the main purpose we're
[36:30] on this planet that's when it becomes
[36:32] wrong that's when it will lead to death
[36:35] amen so we're all subject to these same
[36:37] things we all I mean we we all have
[36:40] these thoughts we all have these
[36:41] concerns we all have this but we have to
[36:44] constantly bring it back in perspective
[36:46] so that we don't lose sight of what is
[36:47] real and what is the vapor what is the
[36:50] mist and what is reality what is
[36:52] temporal and what is
[36:53] permanent amen and and and and it it
[36:57] smacks in the face every day and we have
[36:59] to come in contact with all the time but
[37:01] we need the word of God constantly in
[37:03] our mind so that we realize that I'm
[37:05] here for more than a retirement plan I'm
[37:07] here for more the the the the body is
[37:10] more than for reignment I'm here for
[37:13] more than just to get clothes and put
[37:15] clothes on I'm here for more than just
[37:16] to feed this body amen God will take
[37:18] care of that because I'm here to serve
[37:20] his purpose and as long as I'm here to
[37:22] serve his purpose he'll take care of
[37:23] this
[37:25] body amen
[37:28] so life is more than meat and the body
[37:31] than reignment let's turn to chapter 16
[37:35] same book Matthew chapter
[37:46] 16 Matthew chapter
[37:49] 16 verse
[37:55] 21 says from that time forth began Jesus
[37:57] to show unto his disciples how that he
[37:59] must go into Jerusalem and suffer many
[38:01] things of the elders and chief priests
[38:04] and scribes and be killed be raised
[38:06] again the third day then Peter took him
[38:09] and began to rebuke him saying be it far
[38:11] from thee Lord this shall not be unto
[38:14] thee but he turned and said unto Peter
[38:17] get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an
[38:20] offense unto me for thou savest not the
[38:23] things that be of God but those that be
[38:25] of men
[38:28] Peter was very narrow
[38:31] sided Peter it it looks like Peter just
[38:36] has a a love for the Lord but really
[38:38] Peter has a love for
[38:40] himself and for the current condition
[38:42] that he's living in and there was a a
[38:45] great ministry going on at the time
[38:47] Jesus had a fantastic Ministry Peter was
[38:49] part of that Ministry they were in The
[38:50] Glory Days and Peter just before this
[38:53] had received the Revelation from the
[38:54] father that Jesus was the Christ the son
[38:56] of the Living God
[38:58] and after that Revelation came and Jesus
[39:00] confirmed that that Revelation came from
[39:02] the father not from flesh then he begins
[39:04] to tell them what's going to happen that
[39:06] he's going to be going to Jerusalem he's
[39:08] going to be taken he's going to be
[39:10] crucified and all of that and when Peter
[39:12] hears that Peter's response is that's
[39:15] impossible that cannot happen that is
[39:18] wrong because it's counterintuitive
[39:21] they're having the campaign Jesus is the
[39:23] son of the Living God he just got the
[39:25] Revelation amen from the father of who
[39:27] this is how important this ministry is
[39:29] there's no way in a Ministry this
[39:31] important is going to be
[39:34] crucified man that's humanistic thinking
[39:37] that's the human idea and Peter's stuck
[39:39] in the human idea he doesn't want what
[39:42] he has to go away he doesn't want the
[39:44] ministry to cease he doesn't want the
[39:46] Lord to depart he doesn't want his
[39:48] position in it to fade away Peter is
[39:50] looking after the things that be of man
[39:52] and not the things that be of God
[39:54] because it was the will of God that he
[39:56] should be the sacrificial lamb it was
[39:58] the will of God that he was taken to
[40:00] Jerusalem it was the will of God that he
[40:01] was beaten and rejected and mocked and
[40:03] scored and
[40:09] crucified and Jesus
[40:12] recognized where this self-preservation
[40:16] came
[40:17] from he said get thee behind me
[40:22] Satan oh if God would help me have that
[40:25] same kind of vision when those
[40:27] whispering things come into my
[40:29] ear when I feel like defending myself or
[40:32] protecting myself I get preoccupied with
[40:34] self if I could turn around and say get
[40:36] behind me Satan for you are an offense
[40:39] to me because you careth about the
[40:41] things that be of men and not the things
[40:43] that be of God you're trying to get me
[40:46] to care about this life more than I care
[40:48] about the next life get behind me Satan
[40:50] you're trying to get me to preserve my
[40:52] natural life instead of surrendering and
[40:54] taking my cross and following get behind
[40:56] me Satan
[40:58] am God if he would just help us to have
[41:01] Crystal Clear Vision they would help us
[41:04] so
[41:05] much in the Smur and church age from the
[41:08] church age book brother BS makes this
[41:10] statement he says you see they could not
[41:12] figure out God's love they thought that
[41:15] love meant no
[41:16] suffering hey I'm going to tell you
[41:18] right now this is a problem for
[41:22] me like I know this is true and I
[41:24] testify it's true but the very next time
[41:27] I enter into suffering I I I start to
[41:29] feel like God's love means no suffering
[41:31] and I start think things like God do you
[41:33] love me why are you letting this happen
[41:36] to me why am I going through this don't
[41:40] you know where I am don't you know
[41:41] what's happening can't you see my heart
[41:43] is breaking can't you
[41:47] see my prayers the things that I say and
[41:50] the things that go through my mind
[41:51] testify that I'm struggling with the
[41:54] same thing the Jews were struggling with
[41:56] that somehow I still think his love
[41:58] means no
[41:59] suffering because when I'm suffering I
[42:03] start feeling
[42:04] abandoned I start feeling
[42:07] neglected I start feeling like maybe I'm
[42:10] not one of them and God doesn't care for
[42:11] me and I'm not part of the elect and I'm
[42:14] not a chosen because now I'm
[42:18] suffering
[42:20] amen all these questions start flooding
[42:22] the Mind through
[42:24] suffering why am I suffering and does
[42:27] God loved me and and and all of these
[42:29] things start coming and then you realize
[42:32] that we as human beings struggle with
[42:34] the same thing human beings have always
[42:36] struggled
[42:38] with CU they couldn't figure out God's
[42:41] love they thought that love meant no
[42:44] suffering they thought that love meant a
[42:45] baby with parental care but God said
[42:47] that his love was elective love the
[42:50] proof of his love is election that no
[42:52] matter what happened his love was proven
[42:54] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[42:55] unto salvation because God has chosen
[42:58] you to Salvation through sanctification
[42:59] of the spirit and belief of the
[43:04] truth question is does God love
[43:07] you has he revealed the message to you
[43:09] has he revealed the word has he unveiled
[43:11] himself to you has he chosen you Amen to
[43:13] receive this then he loves you
[43:15] period what happens next doesn't change
[43:18] his love for you his love is fixed and
[43:20] his love is known by election and his
[43:23] election is revealed to you by
[43:25] Revelation amen
[43:27] that's God's love good days and bad days
[43:30] doesn't change the amount of love that
[43:32] he has for us because that was
[43:33] determined before when our names were
[43:35] sealed in the Lamb's Book of
[43:37] Life he says listen to this he may
[43:40] commit you to death as he did Paul he
[43:43] may commit you to suffering as he did
[43:45] job that is his prerogative
[43:51] amen help me
[43:54] God help me let this be his progy
[44:03] I truly friends want to get to the place
[44:05] where the next time the wheels fall off
[44:07] the bus and life Turns Upside Down I
[44:11] don't start saying God what's
[44:15] wrong I'd like to change from God's
[44:18] what's wrong to God help me do right
[44:21] right now show me what you want me to do
[44:24] next
[44:29] that is his prerogative he is
[44:31] Sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[44:35] if he did not have a purpose then he
[44:37] would be the author of frustration and
[44:39] not of Peace his purpose is that after
[44:41] we have suffered a while we would be
[44:43] made perfect be established strengthened
[44:45] and settled as job said he put strength
[44:48] in US you see he himself suffered he
[44:51] learned obedience by the things that he
[44:52] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[44:55] the things that he suffered
[44:58] if that's the case for Jesus then how's
[45:00] he going to perfect
[45:01] Us by showering us with everything's
[45:04] easy everything's provided you never get
[45:06] sick you never lose your job you never
[45:08] have Financial insecurity you never have
[45:10] somebody misunderstand you never have
[45:12] conflict in the church you never have
[45:13] problems in your family you never have
[45:15] any of this stuff because God loves
[45:21] you
[45:23] see he learned obedience by the things
[45:25] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[45:29] by the things that he
[45:30] suffered there's another scripture I'm
[45:32] going to uh jump ahead I have it
[45:34] somewhere in my notes if I can find it
[45:37] to Ecclesiastes 7:3 I'm just going to
[45:40] read it to you you don't have to turn
[45:41] there said sorrow is better than
[45:44] laughter for by the sadness of the count
[45:47] countenance The Heart Is Made
[45:49] better what a
[45:52] statement what a statement you know when
[45:55] I preach these things I almost feel bad
[45:57] for preaching him
[45:59] because but it's
[46:01] life it's real it's what really happens
[46:05] it's the way Christianity really
[46:07] is sorrow is better than
[46:10] laughter for by the sadness of the
[46:13] countenance The Heart Is Made better
[46:16] listen I there's times in my life that
[46:19] I've suffered and been
[46:21] brokenhearted really been down low and
[46:24] really hurt but I can tell you those
[46:27] have become the greatest times of growth
[46:28] in my whole life those are times when
[46:31] God became precious to me and he
[46:32] revealed himself in a personal way and
[46:35] maybe in a way that I would have never
[46:36] stopped and seen or felt or understood
[46:38] if I hadn't hit the
[46:40] despair it was times in despair that
[46:43] brought about my testimonies it's times
[46:45] in great struggle where I seen his
[46:47] mighty hand amen and the sadness of the
[46:50] countenance The Heart Is Made better and
[46:53] I can say amen that's nothing but the
[46:55] truth amen am amen
[46:59] amen we don't like to suffer and we
[47:03] don't like to watch others
[47:05] suffer and that's just the truth I've
[47:08] told people
[47:10] before as a pastor breaks my heart to
[47:12] see people go through trials and
[47:14] troubles in their family and if it was
[47:16] up to me I would let them bypass it all
[47:19] I say oh Lord no no no don't let that
[47:21] happen to their family don't let that
[47:22] happen to them no God take that away
[47:24] immediately and that's still the way I
[47:26] pray but in reality God is doing what's
[47:28] best for that individual and I know it
[47:32] when he's doing it for me I know it I
[47:33] said God help me to understand this is
[47:36] what I need for the sadness of the
[47:38] countenance does the heart good
[47:40] amen we need to suffer to be
[47:44] perfected let's look turn to Hebrews
[47:47] chapter
[47:48] 12 now
[47:57] Hebrews chapter
[48:00] 12 verse
[48:03] 1 in Hebrews 12:1 he says
[48:06] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[48:09] about with so great a cloud of witness
[48:11] Witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[48:13] and the sin which those who easily beset
[48:15] us and let us run with patience the race
[48:17] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[48:20] the author and finish of our faith for
[48:22] who for the joy that was set before him
[48:24] endured the cross despising the shame
[48:27] and is set down at the right hand of the
[48:29] Throne of God for consider him that
[48:31] endured such contradiction of Sinners
[48:33] against himself lest you be wearied and
[48:36] faint in your minds he's telling us to
[48:39] focus focus on Christ because he was an
[48:42] example to us because he didn't have it
[48:45] easy and he didn't have it without
[48:46] contradiction and he didn't have a life
[48:48] that was at ease amen and and look look
[48:51] unto Jesus the author and finish of our
[48:52] faith who for the joy that was set
[48:54] before him endured the cross
[48:57] amen God has given us precious promises
[48:59] we know what's set before us and what is
[49:02] set before us is more glorious than
[49:04] anything we can experience in this life
[49:06] in this Dimension amen this life is a
[49:08] vapor this is a Mist it's going to be
[49:10] over if you make it 90 years 90 years is
[49:13] nothing in comparison to
[49:15] Eternity 90 years of suffering to gain
[49:18] eternity is better than year than 90
[49:21] years of pleasure and missing
[49:23] eternity so we weigh it in the balance
[49:25] amen there's no way if i s struggle and
[49:28] suffer every single day of my life it is
[49:31] still worth it is still better it is
[49:33] still glorious in the face of winning
[49:36] eternity of what God has in store for me
[49:39] amen if he must if he must perfect me
[49:42] through this to get me there so that I
[49:44] have character to reign with him in the
[49:45] Millennium then go be praise be to God
[49:48] this is what I need to get there my goal
[49:50] is there my goal is not
[49:53] here amen amen praise God amen if you're
[49:58] going to school to the the the to to to
[50:01] become a professional and you have to go
[50:03] to maybe six seven eight years of school
[50:05] you want a PhD and something and and and
[50:08] you're going to school and the reason
[50:10] you're going to school is to get the
[50:15] job so as you go to school you have to
[50:18] study you have to write papers and you
[50:19] have to be diligent about when you go to
[50:21] bed and when you get up and attending
[50:22] class and writing the papers and getting
[50:24] the grades and blah blah blah blah blah
[50:26] and it's not so much that you want to
[50:28] write that paper and say oh I'm so
[50:29] excited I get to write a 20page research
[50:31] paper on a topic I could care less
[50:34] about this is wonderful no that's not
[50:37] wonderful that's hard it's a trial you
[50:39] don't like it you have to do it but you
[50:41] do it because of the
[50:45] goal and for the glory that lay ahead
[50:48] and Jesus endured the cross amen God
[50:50] helped me to set my affections on things
[50:52] above not on things on the earth help me
[50:54] to understand with reality with
[50:56] revelation and the glory that's laying
[50:57] ahead you think this is glorious amen
[51:00] just to hear the message wait until the
[51:01] very message himself Jesus Christ is
[51:03] there in flesh in the Millennium and you
[51:05] can see him and hear his voice and be
[51:08] under that rule in that atmosphere where
[51:10] sin is bound my goodness there's nothing
[51:12] here that can compare to
[51:14] that and 40 or 50 more years of struggle
[51:17] and suffer is nothing compared to that I
[51:21] I say God help me help me to be like a
[51:23] mule amen and just put my head down and
[51:26] plow through the traces without
[51:27] complaining without bitterness without
[51:34] selflove you know what's destroying our
[51:36] mental health feeling sorry for
[51:42] ourselves feeling sorry for
[51:49] ourselves somebody made fun of me
[51:52] misunderstood me treated me poorly
[51:58] amen that's the grace of
[52:01] God bringing us to
[52:05] Perfection that's the tool in the hand
[52:07] of God to shape his
[52:10] children is it wrong it's wrong did they
[52:13] do you wrong they did you wrong did God
[52:16] allow it yes it's either yes or
[52:20] no if God allowed it then it must be for
[52:23] my good and it must serve his purpose
[52:26] and it must bring about glory in the
[52:29] end so when I begin to feel sorry for
[52:32] myself for the thing that God has
[52:33] brought for my perfection and His glory
[52:37] then what I do is I trap
[52:39] myself in an emotional
[52:43] trap and it's destroying our walk with
[52:46] the Lord that's
[52:48] right man if I could just not feel sorry
[52:52] for myself I could do so much better
[52:57] amen I wish I had mastered that by now I
[53:00] wish I could stand here and say I got
[53:02] over that but I didn't get over it I
[53:03] wasn't over it yesterday I probably
[53:05] won't be over it tomorrow but by the
[53:06] grace of God may he paint the picture
[53:08] where I can keep saying you know what
[53:09] that's not the truth it's not the truth
[53:11] I feel miserable but that's not the
[53:13] truth the reality is all things work
[53:16] together for good this too is serving
[53:18] his purpose it's going to be okay and I
[53:21] could say God my heart is broken God I
[53:24] don't understand but God I'm trusting in
[53:26] in you help me to move forward and
[53:28] strengthen me am mean we still need his
[53:30] help we still need his strength we still
[53:32] need the bomm of Gilead we can't do it
[53:34] by ourselves but if we don't recognize
[53:36] what's happening we move into despair we
[53:38] move into self-focus when we move into
[53:40] self- Focus we begin to deteriorate on
[53:43] the
[53:45] inside I'm telling you the worst thing
[53:48] that could ever happen to you and I is
[53:50] that we feel sorry for
[53:53] ourselves guess what if God
[53:57] told us every trial goes across God's
[53:59] desk right and he's got to give approval
[54:00] for it if God signed off on it that
[54:03] means he didn't feel sorry for
[54:05] you so if God's not feeling sorry for me
[54:09] what right do I have to feel sorry for
[54:12] myself amen and the reality is if I
[54:15] begin to feel sorry for myself what I'm
[54:17] doing is I'm saying this isn't
[54:21] fair and this isn't right and this isn't
[54:24] fair that's a total self FOC Focus
[54:26] perspective I've lost focus of the word
[54:29] that's really the danger of this is
[54:31] because I've lost focus of Christ being
[54:33] Lord of all because I feel like what's
[54:36] happening to me isn't right isn't fair
[54:38] isn't just and all that may be true that
[54:40] it's not right not fair not just but
[54:42] it's still ordained of
[54:45] God and so with that self focus I lose
[54:48] sight of the word when I lose sight of
[54:51] the word I start to believe a lie
[54:56] yeah that's right and how did Deception
[54:59] come in the beginning how did the fall
[55:00] come it was when Eve believed a
[55:04] lie what is the devil trying to get us
[55:06] to do he's trying to get us to believe a
[55:09] lie and the very minute we begin to
[55:12] accept a lie as truth amen we begin to
[55:15] deteriorate
[55:17] spiritually when we believe that that
[55:20] that this is uh this is not right this
[55:23] is not of God this is
[55:25] not it's going to begin to deteriorate
[55:27] us
[55:29] spiritually it's going to damage us and
[55:31] hurt those around
[55:35] us I say God I'm telling you friends
[55:38] I've got a sickness and I think you've
[55:40] got it too a sickness is called
[55:43] self and I think we all got a bad case
[55:46] of it but God's working on it he's
[55:49] trying to cure
[55:51] us
[55:53] amen let's turn to Galatians chapter 5
[56:01] sometimes we wonder how we can get into
[56:03] such places in
[56:04] life such places where we pull back from
[56:08] God we pull back from the body we
[56:10] separate ourselves from fellowship we
[56:12] get so discouraged and despondent we get
[56:14] so depressed and we wonder sometimes how
[56:16] we got in that
[56:18] place amen and I'll tell you the way we
[56:21] got there in my this is just my
[56:23] perspective is started by feeling so
[56:26] sorry for
[56:27] ourselves and then the devil gave us all
[56:30] kinds of information to support that
[56:32] feeling right all the facts poured in
[56:36] then you start feeling unfairly treated
[56:38] when you start feeling unfairly treated
[56:41] unjustly treated uh the whole world's
[56:43] against you nobody's been fair with you
[56:45] what's happening to me isn't right I
[56:47] guarantee that there's going to be a
[56:49] devil there to give you a list of facts
[56:51] that support that
[56:53] truth because he wants you to believe
[56:55] the lie yeah
[56:56] and the more we believe the lie the
[56:59] further we separate ourselves from the
[57:01] very thing we need the most which is the
[57:04] word of God The Fellowship of the Saints
[57:06] the body of
[57:09] Christ
[57:11] amen say God help me to stop feeling
[57:14] sorry for
[57:16] myself it's pretty
[57:18] bad I mean it's so bad that if my wife
[57:22] forgets what I asked her to pack for
[57:23] lunch and pack something else I start
[57:25] feeling sorry for myself
[57:29] I told her yesterday I didn't want this
[57:31] I want she didn't listen to me she
[57:33] doesn't care like she should care nobody
[57:36] cares about me I'm going to have to
[57:38] start packing my own lunch she was
[57:40] worried about something else and now she
[57:43] and she but but the boys they got what
[57:45] they wanted in lunch but I didn't get
[57:46] what I wanted she's putting more time
[57:48] and attention to them than she's putting
[57:49] into me and you know what happens and
[57:51] that sounds funny but that's exactly the
[57:53] way it starts
[57:56] and it's all a
[57:57] lie and it's all feeling sorry for
[58:03] myself oh it's a bad sickness friends
[58:06] it's really bad your kids get it
[58:09] too he got two pieces I only got
[58:12] one you like him better than me yeah
[58:16] that's exactly right the day you were
[58:18] born I decided you're not getting
[58:20] anything
[58:26] we joke about those things but when it
[58:28] starts to become a reality in Our Minds
[58:31] when that starts to become the truth it
[58:34] starts to plague us and it starts to
[58:36] discourage us and that discourage moves
[58:38] the despondency and all of a sudden you
[58:40] can begin to feel like an outcast in
[58:41] your own home and it's all a lie you can
[58:44] start to feel like those who love you
[58:46] the most don't love you right and that's
[58:48] a
[58:49] lie amen amen amen God help us human
[58:55] beings are pathetic yes might as well
[58:57] come to terms with it brother man said
[58:59] man's a failure to begin with we are
[59:01] pathetic our minds are shot these bodies
[59:03] are falling our minds are corrupt amen
[59:06] we need the word of God to keep setting
[59:07] this thing right all the time or else
[59:09] we're going to go wrong There's A
[59:11] Thousand Ways To Die there's only one
[59:13] way to live and that's receive the word
[59:14] of God receive
[59:17] Christ let's go to Galatians chapter 5:
[59:20] 16
[59:28] he says this I say then walk in the
[59:29] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[59:31] lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth
[59:34] against the spirit and the spirit
[59:36] against the Flesh and these are contrary
[59:38] the one to the other so that you cannot
[59:40] do the things that you would but if you
[59:42] would be led of the spirit you are not
[59:44] under the law now the works of the flesh
[59:46] are manifest which are these adultery
[59:48] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[59:50] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[59:53] emulations wrath Strife seditions her
[59:56] IES envyings murders drunkenness
[59:59] revelings and such like of the which I
[1:00:01] tell you before as I have also told you
[1:00:03] in time past that they which do such
[1:00:05] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:00:07] God but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:00:10] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:00:14] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:00:18] against such there is no
[1:00:21] law when you look at these list of the
[1:00:24] things that are of the flesh and the
[1:00:26] works that are of the spirit the fruit
[1:00:28] of the Flesh and the fruit of the
[1:00:29] spirit if you look at those that are of
[1:00:32] the flesh they all have to do with
[1:00:36] self self-pleasure self-gratification
[1:00:39] self-preservation what Strife is all
[1:00:41] about being right emulations is
[1:00:44] competition being number one wrath is
[1:00:47] being angry at somebody for what they
[1:00:49] did to you all of these are about
[1:00:53] self if you look at the fruits of the
[1:00:56] spirit it's all outside of self love joy
[1:01:00] peace longsuffering it's being
[1:01:03] patient gentleness goodness Faith
[1:01:07] meekness Temperance and
[1:01:09] self-control against such there is the
[1:01:12] law there is no law and they that are
[1:01:15] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:01:18] affections and
[1:01:21] lusts if we live in the spirit let us
[1:01:24] also walk in the spirit
[1:01:27] see the spirit walks according to the
[1:01:30] word the flesh walks according to our
[1:01:33] own desires and lusts and affections
[1:01:36] that's why we have to crucify the Flesh
[1:01:38] and that we have to walk in the spirit
[1:01:41] and to walk in the spirit we cannot walk
[1:01:43] in the spirit apart of walking from
[1:01:44] God's word because God's word and God's
[1:01:46] spirit go
[1:01:47] together and the the word tells us to
[1:01:50] crucify the flesh with the affections
[1:01:52] and lust thereof the word tells us to
[1:01:54] take up our cross and follow after him
[1:01:56] the word tells us to suffer for his
[1:01:58] name's
[1:02:00] sake and so when we walk in the spirit
[1:02:03] we will not fulfill the lust of the
[1:02:05] flesh so what is the secret to
[1:02:07] overcoming the flesh is to walk in the
[1:02:10] spirit amen I need to be conscience and
[1:02:13] diligent and deliberate about walking in
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:16] spirit the problem that comes is when I
[1:02:19] start to get so when I start to feel
[1:02:22] sorry for myself and become despondent
[1:02:24] and become discouraged
[1:02:26] you know what I do almost every time I
[1:02:28] pull back from the
[1:02:30] word pull back from brothers and sisters
[1:02:33] pull back from fellowship pulled back
[1:02:35] and all a sudden I began despondent
[1:02:37] discouraged depressed and I begin to
[1:02:39] lose interest even listening to The
[1:02:41] Prophet's
[1:02:46] voice what did that
[1:02:52] self the combat flesh is to walk in the
[1:02:56] spirit to stay
[1:03:00] engaged not to nurse my
[1:03:03] hurt not to allow the lie to take over
[1:03:06] but to stay connected to stay engaged to
[1:03:09] stay in the word to stay in prayer to
[1:03:12] stay in
[1:03:14] Fellowship to listen to the message to
[1:03:17] read to to stay connected with
[1:03:20] God Amen no matter how hurt I am or how
[1:03:23] depressed I am the only healing that I
[1:03:25] God is in that
[1:03:29] word but the trick of the devil is to
[1:03:31] get us to turn
[1:03:33] inward and to turn inward then we we go
[1:03:36] on a a course and we spiral
[1:03:40] downhill in Galatians Chapter 2 we're
[1:03:43] here in Galatians let's just flip back
[1:03:45] to chapter
[1:03:47] 2 verse
[1:03:50] 20 says I am crucified with Christ
[1:03:54] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:03:57] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:03:59] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:04:01] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[1:04:03] himself for me I'm crucified with Christ
[1:04:07] but I live but it can't be me living it
[1:04:10] has to be Christ Living in me that's the
[1:04:12] only way that we're going to
[1:04:15] overcome when brother B begins to talk
[1:04:17] about the Apostle Paul he begins to
[1:04:19] speak about Paul and he comes to this
[1:04:22] place and present stage of my Ministry
[1:04:24] and he talks about Deus having forsaken
[1:04:27] Paul and the reason Deus forsook him is
[1:04:30] because he couldn't understand
[1:04:32] Paul Paul was a mighty Apostle of the
[1:04:36] Lord Jesus Christ he was a prophet he
[1:04:39] was a light to the Gentiles he had met
[1:04:41] the Lord face to face he had gifts in
[1:04:43] his life he had healings and he had all
[1:04:45] kinds of manifestations that followed
[1:04:47] him he met the pillar of fire himself he
[1:04:50] had all this but yet when he saw Paul's
[1:04:55] life life
[1:04:56] Afflicted saw him
[1:04:58] rejected cast out ridiculed when he saw
[1:05:03] that he was no longer welcome in
[1:05:05] churches he used to be welcome
[1:05:08] in when he got to the place where he
[1:05:11] only had one
[1:05:12] coat and he was a prisoner and he left
[1:05:16] his friend sick in one city to come to
[1:05:18] another and no longer had the power to
[1:05:21] heal that
[1:05:22] friend brother M said it looked like
[1:05:25] Paul was walking
[1:05:26] up they had no more power that there
[1:05:29] there was no more might it wasn't like
[1:05:31] it was at the beginning it
[1:05:35] changed and the Bible actually says in 2
[1:05:37] Timothy 4 it says for demoth has
[1:05:40] forsaken me having loved this present
[1:05:44] World why did Deus forsake Him the same
[1:05:47] reason the Rich Young Ruler turned his
[1:05:49] back on Jesus and walked away the same
[1:05:53] reason because he couldn't cope with
[1:05:55] losing out in this world he couldn't
[1:05:58] deal with the rejection he couldn't deal
[1:06:01] with weakness he couldn't deal with
[1:06:03] being
[1:06:05] nothing and Deus had forsaken him having
[1:06:07] loved this present
[1:06:10] world but Paul the Apostle
[1:06:13] Paul who had everything going for him in
[1:06:16] the natural Paul begins to tell us that
[1:06:20] you know he was a Pharisee of the
[1:06:21] Pharisees he he had gotten letters from
[1:06:23] the high priest so he knew the the
[1:06:25] priesthood the leadership in Jerusalem
[1:06:27] he was well thought of respected went to
[1:06:28] the school of Gia he was out on a
[1:06:31] campaign as a zealous Jew to stamp out
[1:06:34] this new sect this new heresy amen he
[1:06:36] had everything going for him brother B
[1:06:38] said he was arm in-arm with the high
[1:06:40] priest he had it all he had Prestige he
[1:06:43] had he had class he had no doubt
[1:06:45] opportunity for wealth he had he was
[1:06:47] going to get a good position he had you
[1:06:49] know he had everything going for him but
[1:06:51] when he met the pillar of fire his whole
[1:06:53] life changed and from then on what does
[1:06:55] Paul have Paul has trials tribulations
[1:06:58] rejections abuses he's shipwreck he goes
[1:07:01] through a list Shipwrecked beaten amen
[1:07:04] uh beaten 39 times left for dead lowered
[1:07:07] off of a wall of the city I mean he has
[1:07:09] he has this wrap sheet that is
[1:07:11] absolutely ridiculous it's tragedy after
[1:07:14] tragedy after
[1:07:16] tragedy not after he served the Lord not
[1:07:19] before he after he served the Lord was
[1:07:22] it perfect it was perfect before he
[1:07:24] served the Lord the tragedy came after
[1:07:26] he served the
[1:07:27] Lord after he gave his life to Christ
[1:07:30] after he became the messenger for the
[1:07:32] age the light un the Gentiles after he
[1:07:34] moved into his commission and his
[1:07:36] purpose on the earth and God's hand was
[1:07:38] upon him he was filled with the Holy
[1:07:39] Ghost and he was moving forward in the
[1:07:41] power of God to serve God's purpose it
[1:07:43] was in that condition that everything
[1:07:45] went
[1:07:47] wrong it got so bad Deus couldn't handle
[1:07:50] it
[1:07:51] anymore because Deus couldn't sacrifice
[1:07:54] himself but Paul Paul says I count it
[1:07:57] all D that I may win
[1:08:00] Christ Paul had a life of suffering and
[1:08:04] rejection false accusation and
[1:08:09] imprisonment and
[1:08:11] Paul wasn't
[1:08:15] complaining and we don't have a record
[1:08:17] in the Bible that Paul was feeling sorry
[1:08:19] for
[1:08:20] himself but he was pressing
[1:08:22] on they put him in jail he wrote letters
[1:08:27] amen he testified on the
[1:08:30] ship he prayed amen after he was
[1:08:33] Shipwrecked he had a healing campaign
[1:08:35] through the island that he landed
[1:08:38] on he didn't sit down and nurse his
[1:08:40] hurts and talk about falsely imprison
[1:08:42] they rejected me the Jews how could they
[1:08:44] they know me I used to be their friends
[1:08:46] and now the very ones I went to school
[1:08:48] with in Gia School a theology now
[1:08:50] they're the ones who turn on me how
[1:08:52] could they treat me this way and I I'm
[1:08:54] this and it's so bad amen you know what
[1:08:56] happened to now I'm in prison and now
[1:08:58] I'm Shipwrecked and now I'm snake
[1:09:01] bit now I'm miserable and wet and even
[1:09:04] the natives have to come start a fire my
[1:09:06] life is miserable and everything's
[1:09:13] horrible he wouldn't have had a healing
[1:09:15] campaign if he would have been in that
[1:09:17] attitude he wouldn't have had a Revival
[1:09:20] on the island like he did and go all the
[1:09:21] way up to the governor of the island and
[1:09:24] heal his father if he had that
[1:09:28] attitude amen Paul knew that he was
[1:09:31] chosen for a
[1:09:32] purpose he knew he knew the glory that
[1:09:36] lay at the end of the
[1:09:38] road and he was willing to endure to
[1:09:41] obtain that
[1:09:43] prize he told us so in the
[1:09:47] scriptures he says in Philippians this
[1:09:50] is what Paul
[1:09:51] says he says yay and doubtless I count
[1:09:55] all things lost for the Excellency of
[1:09:57] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:10:01] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:10:03] things and I do count them but dung that
[1:10:06] I may win
[1:10:10] Christ can we do the same
[1:10:13] thing can we count everything else as
[1:10:16] dung that I might win
[1:10:19] Christ can we suffer every day of our
[1:10:23] lives and still have a joyful
[1:10:25] expectation for the next life and still
[1:10:28] be about the father's
[1:10:30] business can we have all our friends
[1:10:32] turn against us and people falsely
[1:10:34] accuse us and say things that aren't
[1:10:36] true and go and try to destroy our work
[1:10:39] behind our back and can we have that and
[1:10:43] still say it's worth it all to have
[1:10:48] Christ can you can we have that happen
[1:10:51] to us and stay engaged and stay in the
[1:10:53] ministry and keep spreading the gospel
[1:10:57] that's a
[1:10:58] challenge Paul was an example to us
[1:11:03] all he tells us let's turn to First
[1:11:05] Corinthians together and read this from
[1:11:07] the Apostle
[1:11:12] Paul 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:11:21] 9 1 Corinthians chapter 9: 24
[1:11:28] know you not that they which run in a
[1:11:29] race run all but one receiveth the prize
[1:11:32] so run that you may obtain and every man
[1:11:35] that striveth from the Mastery is
[1:11:36] temperent in all things now they do it
[1:11:39] to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an
[1:11:42] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:11:44] uncertain so fight I not as one that
[1:11:46] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:11:49] and bring it into subjection lest that
[1:11:50] by any means when I have preached to
[1:11:52] others on myself should be a Cast Away
[1:11:55] Paul starts using the analogy of running
[1:11:57] a race for a a worldly treasure for some
[1:11:59] Accolade or some reward a crown he calls
[1:12:02] it and those that are running that race
[1:12:06] to receive that Earthly Crown they're
[1:12:08] tempered in all things they keep their
[1:12:10] body under control they're careful about
[1:12:12] what they eat they're careful about how
[1:12:13] much they sleep they're careful about
[1:12:14] where they go and what they do why
[1:12:16] because they're training themselves and
[1:12:18] keeping themselves in condition so that
[1:12:20] they might obtain a temporal
[1:12:22] prize but he says but ours is
[1:12:25] Incorruptible ours is an eternal prize
[1:12:28] if they will have to keep after
[1:12:30] themselves if they will have to eat
[1:12:32] right sleep right walk right associate
[1:12:34] right do right in order to win this
[1:12:36] Earthly prize what should we do to
[1:12:38] obtain the Heavenly
[1:12:40] prize amen should we should I think we
[1:12:44] should reign in this flesh I think we
[1:12:46] should tell it
[1:12:48] no I think we should tell this flesh
[1:12:50] when the flesh starts that self-pity
[1:12:52] party say uh-uh buddy no
[1:12:55] we're in the hands of God we're not
[1:12:58] going to feel sorry for ourselves we're
[1:12:59] not going to protect ourselves we're not
[1:13:01] going to defend
[1:13:03] ourselves we're not going down that
[1:13:05] road we're not going to spend hours
[1:13:08] worrying about
[1:13:10] tomorrow it's a waste of
[1:13:12] time we got to keep under our flesh and
[1:13:15] walk in the spirit bring these things
[1:13:18] subject to the word of God we have to we
[1:13:22] have to know how to possess our vessels
[1:13:24] and not let our vessels possess
[1:13:27] us because these are all things that we
[1:13:29] face all of us face and they're all
[1:13:31] questions that we have in circumstances
[1:13:33] that we come in contact with and they're
[1:13:35] all trials that we undergo and so none
[1:13:37] of us are excused from this but we're
[1:13:40] instructed Amen to walk in the spirit
[1:13:43] not in the flesh to forget those things
[1:13:45] and press towards the mark of the high
[1:13:47] calling in Christ Jesus to look at the
[1:13:50] glory that lay ahead and endure and like
[1:13:52] I said earlier I I I I have this image
[1:13:55] that I keep coming back to but it it may
[1:13:58] sound uh uh negative in some way but
[1:14:00] it's not
[1:14:02] negative when I get into trouble and
[1:14:04] when I get into difficult circumstances
[1:14:07] what I want to do is just like a mule
[1:14:09] hooked to the traces plowing out for the
[1:14:12] master I just want to put my head down
[1:14:15] and just walk amen because you know what
[1:14:19] I'm going to plow this field regardless
[1:14:21] if I kick and scream and fuss and I bite
[1:14:23] it the bit and I he and Hall and whip my
[1:14:26] head around I'm still going to I'm still
[1:14:28] going to have to plow this row I'm still
[1:14:30] going to have to go through this trial
[1:14:32] I'm still going to have to come to
[1:14:33] Perfection I'm still going to have to
[1:14:35] learn obedience by the things I I'm
[1:14:36] still going to have to plow this field
[1:14:38] no matter how much I strain and fight
[1:14:40] and you can have an old mule and if he's
[1:14:42] not trained real well and he gets
[1:14:43] contener he can fight and he can fuss
[1:14:46] and he can stomp his feet and kick his
[1:14:47] feet but you know he's still tied to the
[1:14:49] traces and he's still going to plow this
[1:14:51] field but at the end of it he's going to
[1:14:52] be all worked up and sweaty and he's
[1:14:54] going to hurt hurt himself and it's
[1:14:55] going to be way worse for him and if he
[1:14:57] just quietly put his head down and get
[1:14:59] to the end of the
[1:15:00] row said God help me to be the tool that
[1:15:03] you're going to use on this Earth and
[1:15:05] help me to have enough sense just to put
[1:15:07] my head down and
[1:15:09] plow cuz that's the easiest
[1:15:12] way amen amen and I don't mean with an
[1:15:17] attitude of
[1:15:20] defeat not nothing's ever going to
[1:15:23] change it's never going to get better
[1:15:24] that's not not
[1:15:26] true not that kind but this is something
[1:15:30] God wants me to go through God wants me
[1:15:31] to do and I just got to go through
[1:15:34] it and the quicker I submit and move
[1:15:37] through the easier it's going to
[1:15:40] be and I'm going to find out at the
[1:15:42] other end there might be a rub down in a
[1:15:45] pile of
[1:15:46] Oats be a reward in it friends there
[1:15:49] always
[1:15:50] is sometimes we can't see the reward
[1:15:52] when we're in the middle of the field
[1:15:55] but God's good to
[1:15:58] us you look at the things that Paul went
[1:16:00] through after his conversion the the the
[1:16:03] list is
[1:16:05] unbelievable we think about the things
[1:16:07] brother Brenham went through after his
[1:16:08] conversion the troubles and the trials
[1:16:11] but you know his life also wasn't
[1:16:12] without
[1:16:13] blessings God blessed him abundantly he
[1:16:16] talks about the things all the gifts
[1:16:18] that people sent him he he talks about
[1:16:20] the trips he got to go on through he
[1:16:21] loved the Wilderness he loved the Hun
[1:16:23] and and that brother took some of the
[1:16:25] most amazing hunting trips I've ever
[1:16:26] heard of right you know what that was
[1:16:28] that was a blessing from God for him
[1:16:31] it's not that it's all treasury it's not
[1:16:33] that it's all misery God is good if we
[1:16:35] learn to see good in everything we're
[1:16:37] going to see more
[1:16:39] good if we see the trial is good and the
[1:16:41] blessing is good we're going to find out
[1:16:44] amen that that I could never enjoy the
[1:16:46] blessing if I didn't go through the
[1:16:47] trial I would never get the benefit out
[1:16:49] of the blessing if I didn't go through
[1:16:51] the trial and if my life was all
[1:16:53] blessing I would never have the
[1:16:54] character that comes through the
[1:16:57] trial brother Brenham loved guns and he
[1:16:59] loved shooting he had guns sent to him
[1:17:01] from all over the
[1:17:02] world you know what that was the
[1:17:04] blessing of
[1:17:05] God but he couldn't get that without the
[1:17:09] trial it had to go together I believe in
[1:17:12] the blessings of God but I also believe
[1:17:16] that God will perfect our character
[1:17:18] through suffer and I believe it's
[1:17:21] ordained so the two go hand in hand
[1:17:25] brother B says and oh Lord just once
[1:17:28] more uh speaking of Samson he says the
[1:17:32] trouble of it is the church today is not
[1:17:34] like Samson they're not willing to pay
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:38] price Samson prayed right when he prayed
[1:17:41] Lord let me die with the Enemy he know
[1:17:44] it was going to cost him something he
[1:17:46] know it was going to cost something it's
[1:17:48] going to cost you something it's going
[1:17:50] to cost me something your social
[1:17:53] prestige your place and position in the
[1:17:55] denomination Lord let me die then I see
[1:17:58] your purpose he know it was going to
[1:18:01] cost him something you must be ready to
[1:18:03] die out to your enemy to get in the
[1:18:05] blessings of God Samson was willing to
[1:18:07] pay the price to get the power of God
[1:18:10] again upon him he was willing to do it
[1:18:13] are you that's what brother R says he's
[1:18:15] willing to do it are you are you willing
[1:18:18] to sacrifice your television programs
[1:18:20] and you know it used to be wrong for us
[1:18:22] to go to the movies but now the devil
[1:18:23] put one over on you brought it right in
[1:18:25] the house with you that's right brother
[1:18:27] B starts going into a list of things but
[1:18:29] what he's showing us are you willing to
[1:18:30] give up the things that feed the Flesh
[1:18:33] and bring pleasure Amen to serve God are
[1:18:35] you willing to die out to this guy so
[1:18:38] that the purpose of God in our lives can
[1:18:39] be
[1:18:40] fulfilled God had a purpose in Samson's
[1:18:43] life and that purpose was to begin to
[1:18:45] deliver Israel from the hand of the
[1:18:48] Philistines and he went out and because
[1:18:50] he had a gift in his life and there was
[1:18:51] a prophecy over his life he began to go
[1:18:54] out and he began to do that the problem
[1:18:56] is Samson could never overcome
[1:18:59] himself Samson's trials came because he
[1:19:02] had to pleas
[1:19:03] self so he finds himself one day in a
[1:19:07] dungeon grinding at a mill with his eyes
[1:19:09] poked out because of
[1:19:13] self-love but in that dungeon with his
[1:19:16] eyes poked
[1:19:18] out you know what you know what that was
[1:19:22] that was the mercy of
[1:19:23] God
[1:19:25] amen that dungeon was
[1:19:28] Mercy having no more eyesight was the
[1:19:31] love of
[1:19:32] God so how can that be because when
[1:19:35] Samson was grinding at the Mill he began
[1:19:37] to
[1:19:38] think he never stopped serving himself
[1:19:40] in life long enough to really think he
[1:19:43] never stopped fulfilling the lust of the
[1:19:45] flesh long enough to really think he
[1:19:47] knew he had a gift and he knew he loved
[1:19:48] God and he knewest part of the
[1:19:49] Redemption uh part of the Deliverance
[1:19:52] but he never really stopped to think and
[1:19:53] now in this condition he begins to think
[1:19:56] and as he begins to grind at the meal he
[1:19:58] begins to reflect back on his life and
[1:20:00] he think about the commission and the
[1:20:02] things that God has done and the things
[1:20:03] that he's done and the condition he's in
[1:20:06] guess what was not happening to Samson
[1:20:08] he was not growing despond and he wasn't
[1:20:11] trapped in self-love and a pity party
[1:20:13] for himself he began to realize I'm here
[1:20:16] of my own
[1:20:20] doing I'm here because of the choices I
[1:20:23] made
[1:20:26] and this isn't what God has for me God
[1:20:30] called me to be a
[1:20:32] deliverer and Samson's greatest Victory
[1:20:36] came when they brought him out to make
[1:20:38] sport of him to make fun of him and mock
[1:20:40] him you know when they brought him out
[1:20:42] to mock him let out by a little boy so
[1:20:44] that they can make fun of
[1:20:46] him you know what was on his
[1:20:49] mind Lord let me
[1:20:53] die I surrend surrender yes
[1:20:56] all what did Samson come to he finally
[1:20:59] come to the the place where he would
[1:21:01] give his life for his
[1:21:05] purpose
[1:21:08] amen they were mocking him making fun of
[1:21:11] him and he wasn't yelling that's not
[1:21:14] fair stop that's
[1:21:18] mean but he come to terms with his
[1:21:21] purpose he said God let me die right
[1:21:24] here with the Philistines with my enemy
[1:21:28] that I might fulfill the purpose which
[1:21:29] you've called me
[1:21:32] for you know what you know what you're
[1:21:34] called for to destroy the works of the
[1:21:38] devil that's what you're called here
[1:21:41] for God wants to use his bride to finish
[1:21:45] the work that he left for this specific
[1:21:46] hour he needs your body he needs my body
[1:21:50] he needs us to be in a condition where
[1:21:52] we're not serving self first
[1:21:55] cuz that won't work what does he need
[1:21:57] preeminence what is preeminence First
[1:21:59] Place full control what is the whole
[1:22:01] plan of God Amen the whole plan of God
[1:22:03] was for God to manifest himself he
[1:22:04] foreshadowed it in Eden since it's
[1:22:06] Fallen Eden he's been rebuilding it and
[1:22:08] has come through a three-fold purpose
[1:22:10] which is God's one goal to have
[1:22:12] preeminence in a man he did in Christ
[1:22:13] Jesus to have preeminence in a people
[1:22:16] he's doing that now God to finish the
[1:22:19] work and restore Eden back again amen
[1:22:23] amen amen you know what he needs from
[1:22:26] us Lord let me
[1:22:29] die let me die sometimes when we think
[1:22:33] that God's called us to destroy the
[1:22:34] works of the enemy that it'll it'll be a
[1:22:37] sword and a horse and we just ride
[1:22:38] around and slay everybody but maybe the
[1:22:41] very best way for God's purpose to be
[1:22:43] fulfilled in our lives is for us to give
[1:22:46] up our
[1:22:48] lives not the image of a soldier not the
[1:22:51] image of a warrior not the image of a
[1:22:53] mighty Victor are going around
[1:22:55] destroying the devil stomping them under
[1:22:57] feet and maybe that's the wrong
[1:23:00] image because when that doesn't happen
[1:23:03] we start to feel disappointed in our
[1:23:05] life as a
[1:23:07] Believer maybe what he needs is a
[1:23:10] Samson somebody will say Lord I
[1:23:13] surrendered to that let me die to myself
[1:23:16] let me die to self-preservation let me
[1:23:18] die to self love let me die so that you
[1:23:21] can take this flesh finish your work and
[1:23:25] destroy the works of the
[1:23:27] devil many times we get the wrong
[1:23:31] idea he
[1:23:33] says they're not willing to pay the
[1:23:38] price brother man said it's going to
[1:23:40] cost you something it's going to cost me
[1:23:44] something and when I began to reflect on
[1:23:47] that I went to second Samuel so if you
[1:23:49] could turn there with me I want to look
[1:23:50] at 2 Samuel together
[1:23:58] the second book of Samuel and let's go
[1:24:01] to chapter
[1:24:19] 24 2 Samuel 24 verse 22
[1:24:25] this is where the angel of the Lord was
[1:24:28] destroying by pestilence Israel because
[1:24:30] David had numbered the people and he had
[1:24:32] stopped over Jerusalem and the prophet
[1:24:34] had told him to offer a
[1:24:36] sacrifice and so he had stopped at a
[1:24:39] aronas threshing floor so David wants to
[1:24:42] offer a sacrifice and in 22 it says and
[1:24:44] aronas said unto David let my Lord the
[1:24:47] king Take and offer up what seeth good
[1:24:49] unto him behold here be oxen from B
[1:24:52] sacrifice and threshing instruments and
[1:24:54] other instruments of The Oxen for wood
[1:24:56] all these things did Arona as a king
[1:24:58] give unto the king and Arona said unto
[1:25:01] the king the Lord thy God accept thee
[1:25:04] and the King said unto Aron this is King
[1:25:06] David and the King said unto Arona nay
[1:25:10] but I will surely buy it of thee at a
[1:25:11] price neither will I offer burnt
[1:25:13] offerings unto the Lord my God of that
[1:25:16] which doth cost me
[1:25:18] nothing so David thought David bought
[1:25:21] the threshing floor and The Oxen for 50
[1:25:23] shekels of of silver and David built
[1:25:25] there an altar unto the Lord and offered
[1:25:28] burnt offerings and peace offerings so
[1:25:30] the Lord was entreated for the land and
[1:25:32] the plague was stayed from
[1:25:34] Israel this is such an interesting
[1:25:36] important principle to realize that
[1:25:39] David needed to offer an offering he
[1:25:41] needed the he needed to offer an
[1:25:43] offering of an atonement so that the
[1:25:45] hand of the Lord could be stayed and he
[1:25:47] was the king he was the one to offer it
[1:25:49] and and they were there at the threshing
[1:25:51] floor where he would have a sacrifice
[1:25:53] and and I gave him everything take the
[1:25:55] oxen take all the instruments for the
[1:25:58] for the fire I give it all to you you
[1:26:00] can have the threshing FL you can have
[1:26:02] everything make the offering and that
[1:26:03] sounded wonderful amen it sounded like
[1:26:06] that was a good thing but to David it
[1:26:08] wasn't going to work how can I offer to
[1:26:10] the Lord that which cost me
[1:26:12] nothing I said God how let's bring it
[1:26:15] home today how can we offer to the Lord
[1:26:18] that which cost us
[1:26:20] nothing amen when it's easy just to come
[1:26:23] to church it's easy easy to sit through
[1:26:24] a service it's easy to go back home amen
[1:26:27] but but what if I just give him my whole
[1:26:29] life amen what if I give him my thought
[1:26:31] life what if I give him my time what if
[1:26:33] I give him my energy I don't want to
[1:26:35] give him that which cost me
[1:26:38] nothing
[1:26:40] amen I don't want to worship God in a
[1:26:43] way that has no
[1:26:46] sacrifice cuz how do I show my love to
[1:26:50] God brother brandom says in the message
[1:26:53] the church and its condition from
[1:26:56] 1956 he says and so they were very loyal
[1:26:59] to go to church and he's talking about
[1:27:01] people that are a northern Canada he's
[1:27:02] getting ready to have meetings up in
[1:27:04] Canada and he's telling them that it's
[1:27:05] cold up there the people are coming from
[1:27:07] far and there's long distances between
[1:27:09] cities and Villages says so they they're
[1:27:11] very loyal to go to church no matter how
[1:27:14] cold it is they'll wrap up in a blanket
[1:27:16] and sit on a bob sled and drive the
[1:27:18] horse for 30 Mi to go to get to go to
[1:27:21] church they'll walk through the snow
[1:27:23] drifts and everything else Young and old
[1:27:24] they'll all group together and one
[1:27:26] family gets the other and they start
[1:27:28] walking and they go it's a sacrifice
[1:27:31] that they make is what causes them to
[1:27:34] get so much out of the
[1:27:36] service when there's no sacrifice
[1:27:39] there's not very much to the
[1:27:43] service you have to really get down and
[1:27:45] do something that hurts real bad have to
[1:27:48] lay aside some things and stop the work
[1:27:50] and do this or that to get to go to
[1:27:53] church and show God that you love him
[1:27:55] and you you you make a sacrifice to go
[1:27:58] it's then when you get something out of
[1:28:01] it
[1:28:02] amen listen we've got it pretty easy we
[1:28:05] got heated and air conditioned home
[1:28:07] heated and air conditioned cars good
[1:28:09] roads easy travel heated and air
[1:28:12] conditioned
[1:28:13] Church soft seats and regular service
[1:28:16] times and uh work schedule that's
[1:28:18] already worked around it not too bad
[1:28:24] and listen I don't think we should just
[1:28:26] on purpose make that
[1:28:28] harder I kind of like
[1:28:31] that but he says the
[1:28:34] sacrifice that they get something out of
[1:28:36] it David wouldn't offer to God that
[1:28:39] which cost him
[1:28:41] nothing we don't want to give God the
[1:28:43] minimal
[1:28:45] service that which cost us nothing and
[1:28:49] listen at some point if you take this
[1:28:50] word as the authority and you take this
[1:28:52] message as truth you're going to come in
[1:28:55] contact someday to a place that it's
[1:28:57] going to cost you
[1:28:59] something it seems like when we first
[1:29:01] come to it it's all gain you're the
[1:29:02] bride of Christ you get a position you
[1:29:04] have eternal life you have have you'll
[1:29:06] be the Bride of Jesus Christ joint air
[1:29:09] but somewhere along the line you're
[1:29:11] going to hit something that's going to
[1:29:12] have to cause you to deny yourself for
[1:29:16] this word there's people who have come
[1:29:19] in contact with a barrier in the word
[1:29:21] where they now know that they're not
[1:29:23] they're not they have no right to
[1:29:24] remarry because of their marriage
[1:29:26] condition they have to live single the
[1:29:27] rest of their
[1:29:30] lives
[1:29:32] am we have come in contact with with
[1:29:35] with a commandment to not forsake the
[1:29:37] attending of the fellowship not forsake
[1:29:39] the assembling together of ourselves
[1:29:41] amen and there's those that will give up
[1:29:43] work promotions yes for the word of
[1:29:48] God why just to simply be in the house
[1:29:51] of God when the doors are open
[1:29:54] somewhere along the line we're going to
[1:29:57] come in contact with the word and it's
[1:30:00] going to require
[1:30:02] sacrifice and we can make excuses and
[1:30:04] find
[1:30:07] workarounds is that
[1:30:11] true but brother B said it's the
[1:30:15] sacrifice that they make is what causes
[1:30:18] them to get so much out of the service
[1:30:20] I'm not just talking about a church
[1:30:21] service I'm talking about serviceing
[1:30:23] serving God now
[1:30:26] if it all comes easy and there's no
[1:30:30] sacrifice you know we're blessed with a
[1:30:34] robust Fellowship you can have people to
[1:30:36] Fellowship well you can talk to somebody
[1:30:37] you can visit with somebody almost every
[1:30:39] night but there's those that are
[1:30:41] alone following this message there's
[1:30:45] those that have no Fellowship there's
[1:30:47] those that are the only one in their
[1:30:49] demographic in their Church The Only
[1:30:51] Widow the only teenager the only kid
[1:30:56] amen amen so God help me not to be a
[1:30:59] lazy self-serving Christian not to be a
[1:31:03] lazy message believer that always takes
[1:31:05] the easy road but God help me to deny
[1:31:07] myself to keep this word help me to deny
[1:31:11] if it means giving up a promotion if it
[1:31:13] means giving up extra this or that God
[1:31:15] help me to be do something to give you
[1:31:18] the best that I
[1:31:20] got because it's the sacrifice brother B
[1:31:22] said that makes the service
[1:31:26] amen it's amazing how Leo DEA Creeps in
[1:31:30] so
[1:31:31] easy brother B we have a prophet of God
[1:31:34] who teaches us he teaches us that we
[1:31:37] should be at the church every time the
[1:31:38] doors are open if we don't have that
[1:31:39] desire then we should pray because
[1:31:42] something's wrong
[1:31:44] am but it's kind of easy to
[1:31:48] miss and brother man furthermore tells
[1:31:50] us that it's a good idea to come early
[1:31:52] and get quiet and pray
[1:31:54] but we still have multitudes that come
[1:31:56] at the last
[1:31:58] minute and I I know that we live in Leo
[1:32:03] deia and I said God help Leo deia not to
[1:32:06] affect
[1:32:07] us help us to push back
[1:32:11] lord sometimes I look and I see things
[1:32:14] cooling off I see it cooling off in
[1:32:17] myself and it scares me I say God don't
[1:32:18] let me don't let me cool off don't let
[1:32:22] me get lazy don't let me start coasting
[1:32:25] Lord I don't want to start coasting let
[1:32:27] me drop it back down in gear and let me
[1:32:29] put my shoulder to the wheel let me
[1:32:32] sacrifice myself for this
[1:32:35] message it makes me nervous when I see
[1:32:38] things get too easy to
[1:32:42] routine makes me nervous because I know
[1:32:45] what kind of people we are we're human
[1:32:46] beings and I know what kind of
[1:32:48] atmosphere we live in Leo
[1:32:51] DEA and we get to the place where we
[1:32:53] attend church when it's
[1:32:55] convenient we come early if we happen to
[1:32:58] make it early we pray if we got there
[1:33:01] early if we didn't we say why pray at
[1:33:06] home we make all kinds of excuses for
[1:33:09] ourselves the reason we make excuses for
[1:33:11] ourselves is because our biggest enemy
[1:33:13] is
[1:33:15] oursel and we all do I do
[1:33:18] too I get I go from fervency to cooled
[1:33:22] off to ferv I say God I don't want to
[1:33:23] live like
[1:33:24] that I want to be RedHot on fire and I
[1:33:27] want to crucify this man so that I may
[1:33:31] win Christ because that means everything
[1:33:33] to
[1:33:34] me if we brother M said if you put more
[1:33:37] in you get more
[1:33:41] out it's amazing too how pathetic we are
[1:33:44] as human
[1:33:45] beings we'll miss church we'll come
[1:33:48] halfhazard we'll come at the last minute
[1:33:50] we won't come early and pray we won't
[1:33:52] come for the Saturday prayer meeting we
[1:33:54] won't invest in the service we'll come
[1:33:56] last minute we'll sit and listen to the
[1:33:57] preaching and we'll leave and say I
[1:33:59] didn't get anything out of it there must
[1:34:02] be something wrong with the
[1:34:06] preacher maybe there was no
[1:34:09] sacrifice maybe it's not maybe it is the
[1:34:11] preacher it could be but maybe it's
[1:34:14] not maybe we all have a
[1:34:17] responsibility to put our whole heart
[1:34:20] into Christ and I we use an example the
[1:34:23] church but it's beyond the church
[1:34:25] service it's our whole life it's where
[1:34:28] we give our time it's our personal
[1:34:29] devotion it's what we watch it's what we
[1:34:31] spend time doing it's where we let our
[1:34:33] minds drift to it's our whole
[1:34:36] life and we find ourselves serving the
[1:34:39] Flesh and we get discouraged about
[1:34:40] something and serve the Flesh and find
[1:34:42] distractions in entertainment or find
[1:34:44] distractions in something else and then
[1:34:45] we become lethargic as Christians and
[1:34:47] then then you know it's never our fault
[1:34:49] it's always somebody else's fault it's
[1:34:51] always because they did me wrong or
[1:34:52] because they're not preaching fiery
[1:34:54] enough at church or we don't have this
[1:34:56] or that but we never stop long enough to
[1:34:59] say could it be
[1:35:01] me could it be that I'm not getting
[1:35:04] something because of my level of
[1:35:08] sacrifice and it could be the other
[1:35:10] that's true it could be the problem is
[1:35:13] in the preacher it could be the problem
[1:35:15] is in other people or it could be the
[1:35:17] problems in
[1:35:18] us the reality is I can't do anything
[1:35:21] about the preacher and I can't do
[1:35:23] anything about the other people the only
[1:35:25] thing I have control over is
[1:35:27] me so maybe what I should do is focus on
[1:35:30] the thing that I know I ought to do and
[1:35:33] see if I do what the prophet told me to
[1:35:35] do and I make a sacrifice and I give up
[1:35:38] my feelings my emotions my time my if I
[1:35:41] give it all up and I give everything
[1:35:44] maybe I'll do that and
[1:35:48] see
[1:35:50] Amen brother B said in hearing
[1:35:52] recognizing acting on on the word of God
[1:35:54] said someone say Billy if you don't stop
[1:35:56] that you'll Ru you'll run everybody away
[1:35:59] there's one thing that won't go the holy
[1:36:01] spirit because it's his word and the
[1:36:04] real predestinated believer won't go
[1:36:06] away because it's food to his soul he
[1:36:08] loves it and nothing can keep him away
[1:36:10] from it he'll do anything like Jacob but
[1:36:13] he wants that Birthright he'll stand
[1:36:15] there I don't care if it cost every
[1:36:17] friend he's God if it cost his job if it
[1:36:19] cost his church membership if it cost
[1:36:21] everything he'll still hold to it cuz he
[1:36:23] can't help it there's something in him
[1:36:26] moving him the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:36:28] oh there you are something in
[1:36:31] him praise God brother bam said in the
[1:36:34] message he that is in you it was hard
[1:36:36] for him to
[1:36:37] die that this might be produced to you
[1:36:40] it was hard for him to go to Calvary he
[1:36:43] wanted to stay even so much till he
[1:36:45] cried not my will but thine be done see
[1:36:48] he don't he didn't want to leave he was
[1:36:50] a young man and he had his Brethren he
[1:36:53] loved them just like I love
[1:36:55] you he couldn't live and them live also
[1:36:59] so he he died that we might live that
[1:37:03] wasn't
[1:37:04] easy he had to do it look what a death
[1:37:07] laid before Him Father the hour has come
[1:37:09] and shall I pray that you'll take this
[1:37:11] cup away from me no he didn't want to do
[1:37:14] that he wanted God's will to be
[1:37:17] done again in power of transformation he
[1:37:19] said our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing
[1:37:22] yes it was the son of God had to die for
[1:37:26] us things of value come of great
[1:37:30] price things of value come at great
[1:37:33] price the question is is this message
[1:37:37] valuable is this word
[1:37:39] valuable is fellowship with the Saints
[1:37:43] valuable because it comes at a great
[1:37:45] price somebody had to pay the price what
[1:37:48] price am I willing to pay for this
[1:37:51] treasure that's been handed to me
[1:37:54] I think we take things with too little
[1:37:57] value sometimes because they were handed
[1:38:00] to us
[1:38:01] easy and I realize too like in myself
[1:38:04] there's been times of huge sacrifice in
[1:38:06] the past we first come to the message
[1:38:08] and rejection and we
[1:38:11] sacrificed we lost a lot but just
[1:38:15] because I sacrificed 25 years ago
[1:38:18] doesn't mean I don't have to sacrifice
[1:38:20] now just because I gave up my church
[1:38:23] church and my family and I gave up a job
[1:38:26] and I gave up these things doesn't mean
[1:38:29] I'm
[1:38:31] done doesn't mean well I paid my dues no
[1:38:35] I want to give
[1:38:37] more he gave me everything I want to
[1:38:39] give him my
[1:38:41] day I want to give him my time I want to
[1:38:45] give him my mind I want to give him my
[1:38:48] eyes I want to take time to read his
[1:38:51] word I want to stop what I'm doing
[1:38:54] I want to force this flesh to get up a
[1:38:56] little
[1:38:58] earlier I'm so so sick and tired of
[1:39:03] self I convinc myself that what I need
[1:39:06] is more
[1:39:07] sleep when what I need is time with
[1:39:11] God but I'll convince myself when the
[1:39:13] alarm comes off that what I need is more
[1:39:15] sleep right God help me help me God to
[1:39:21] bring this I don't want this flesh to be
[1:39:23] my God and I don't want to keep making
[1:39:25] sacrifices for this flesh I want to
[1:39:27] sacrifice this flesh for my
[1:39:31] God help me
[1:39:33] God
[1:39:35] said I'll read the first line again the
[1:39:37] Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was
[1:39:40] the son of God had to die for us things
[1:39:43] of value come of great price to bring
[1:39:46] this message it wasn't easy see no it
[1:39:48] isn't I had to forsake everything that
[1:39:50] was dear to me even my own people
[1:39:52] everybody
[1:39:54] but you see the value of it is you see
[1:39:56] is to do the will of God and to do that
[1:39:58] which knowing that there is something in
[1:40:00] me when he used to say well they was
[1:40:03] going to put me away he thought I'd lost
[1:40:04] my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus
[1:40:06] Christ contrary to the church and all
[1:40:08] these things they said he's crazy but
[1:40:10] you see no matter what they said there
[1:40:12] is something has to be done and God just
[1:40:14] takes a person sticks him in his hand
[1:40:16] and said do this and you do it what a
[1:40:19] price it might have been to St Paul
[1:40:21] taught under Gia the greatest teacher of
[1:40:23] the Dead day and come down and the very
[1:40:25] thing that he considered heresy the
[1:40:27] thing that he thought that was the worst
[1:40:29] thing that he could have happened to the
[1:40:31] church he comes right around and becomes
[1:40:32] a partaker of it strange thing and how
[1:40:35] God works in wondrous ways and strange
[1:40:38] odd ways his wonders to
[1:40:41] perform God was able to take Paul in his
[1:40:45] hand and Paul was willing to give up
[1:40:47] everything for this glorious gospel it
[1:40:51] came with a price the New Testament that
[1:40:53] we read it came with a price the fact
[1:40:55] that we read a Bible came at a price how
[1:40:58] many people died burned at the Stak or
[1:41:00] killed by state governments because they
[1:41:02] translated a Bible into a common
[1:41:04] language that people could read and
[1:41:06] printed it and distributed it it came at
[1:41:08] a
[1:41:09] price and there's times I won't pay the
[1:41:12] price to take 30 minutes of my day to
[1:41:13] read
[1:41:15] it God forgive
[1:41:18] me people gave their life so that I
[1:41:21] could hold a Bible easily in my hand and
[1:41:23] read it in my native
[1:41:26] language I could at least pay a price to
[1:41:28] read it every
[1:41:33] day I don't know about you but I get
[1:41:35] ashamed of
[1:41:37] myself then I look in my mirror and I
[1:41:39] say I hate you I hate everything about
[1:41:43] you I hate the things you want I hate
[1:41:49] the it might do us all a bit of good to
[1:41:51] do that every morning go through that
[1:41:52] exercise I I hate you you're my enemy
[1:41:56] I'm going to defeat you I'm going to
[1:41:58] control you you're not going to control
[1:42:00] me we are going to serve the Lord and
[1:42:03] guess what tomorrow you're getting up
[1:42:05] extra early cuz you slept in
[1:42:09] today it's funny but we have to take
[1:42:12] control of this guy because he wants to
[1:42:15] control us the wrong
[1:42:21] way the fall in the beginning
[1:42:24] came because Eve had a
[1:42:27] desire for
[1:42:29] self but man said she didn't know but
[1:42:32] she wanted to
[1:42:33] know and the serpant offered her a way
[1:42:35] to
[1:42:37] know if Eve hadn't had any self- desire
[1:42:40] there would have been no
[1:42:41] fall it began in the beginning because
[1:42:44] of self-d Desire it's continuing in us
[1:42:47] because of self- Desire but God is going
[1:42:49] to have the victory
[1:42:54] amen James 1 tells us but every man is
[1:42:56] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:42:58] lust and enticed then when lust ha
[1:43:00] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[1:43:02] when it is finished bringeth forth
[1:43:04] death so what happens where's the
[1:43:08] problem in
[1:43:10] me in lust you can say that devil that
[1:43:14] Devil's only enticing Your
[1:43:18] Lust it's you you're the one who has to
[1:43:23] deny
[1:43:26] self let's go to 1 Timothy chapter
[1:43:37] 3 first

[1:46:47] shall we not receive evil and all this
[1:46:50] did not job sin with his lips
[1:46:54] God help
[1:46:55] us brother Benham said and standing in
[1:46:59] the Gap he said I wonder in this day of
[1:47:01] this loose lazy soft leodan age that we
[1:47:04] live in that's the age that we're living
[1:47:07] in that's the description loose lazy
[1:47:10] soft leoty in age that we're living in
[1:47:13] he tells us also that leoty is people's
[1:47:15] rights I have rights my rights and
[1:47:17] myself and I and all of this nasty stuff
[1:47:20] amen but but brother B said a lamp gives
[1:47:23] up its rights amen the bride give up her
[1:47:26] rights she turns herself over to her
[1:47:28] headship with his Christ she surrenders
[1:47:30] all to him it's no more Leo Dean
[1:47:34] condition for us because we don't have
[1:47:36] any rights if I had any right I exercise
[1:47:38] my right to give up my rights and give
[1:47:40] them all to
[1:47:43] him
[1:47:46] Amen brother B says God's only provided
[1:47:49] place of worship he says now if you get
[1:47:51] everything running just right it's going
[1:47:53] to run everything's set in order if
[1:47:55] there's a shorten that wire that light
[1:47:57] won't come on because it's been grounded
[1:47:59] and when you'll take one of God's words
[1:48:01] or one of his places and in your own
[1:48:04] heart have selfish objectives it'll
[1:48:06] ground the power of God right there even
[1:48:10] in taking the word of God or the promise
[1:48:12] of God if our objective is selfish to
[1:48:14] serve self he said it'll Crown the power
[1:48:16] right there and the power won't come to
[1:48:17] produce the word he says the motive and
[1:48:21] the objective has to be right
[1:48:23] right
[1:48:25] amen that's what job was telling his
[1:48:27] wife won't we accept good from the Lord
[1:48:30] and
[1:48:31] evil like we must accept whatever the
[1:48:34] Lord sends we must accept it from the
[1:48:36] hand of the Lord not just good but if he
[1:48:38] wants me to go through this trial then I
[1:48:40] must accept it as from the lord it's
[1:48:42] going to work
[1:48:44] good amen and we ground the power right
[1:48:49] there Amen in the message standing in
[1:48:52] the gap
[1:48:54] brother Bram says I've never regarded
[1:48:56] myself anybody knows this but people
[1:48:58] have said brother brandham the Lord
[1:48:59] called you to be his Prophet I've never
[1:49:01] regarded myself as that but I begin to
[1:49:03] get to that time that I was about ready
[1:49:05] to do it to think well maybe I am if I
[1:49:08] am I'll live back in the wilderness and
[1:49:10] if I live back in the wilderness then be
[1:49:12] his Prophet see and then if he wants to
[1:49:15] send me somewhere while he's not using
[1:49:17] me then I'll sure to catch some fine
[1:49:19] fish and do some things said of course
[1:49:22] that was kind of selfish attitude see
[1:49:25] because I wanted to do
[1:49:27] that now it isn't just exactly the thing
[1:49:30] that's to do and now I had that made up
[1:49:32] in my mind to do that we understand
[1:49:35] really well standing in the Gap brother
[1:49:36] Brenham is struggling with
[1:49:38] himself do you know who brother man's
[1:49:40] struggling with and standing in the Gap
[1:49:42] his own
[1:49:43] flesh he's offended because the people
[1:49:46] haven't heard him he thought they ought
[1:49:47] to hear his message he's feeling an old
[1:49:49] rejection complex that came through
[1:49:51] childhood and he's wanting to run away
[1:49:53] to the Wilderness to get away from the
[1:49:55] pressure that's what that's what he's
[1:49:57] dealing with he's dealing with
[1:50:00] himself and he comes up with a plan and
[1:50:03] he puts a religious cover on the plan
[1:50:06] and I hope you'll forgive me for talking
[1:50:07] about the Prophet this way but it's the
[1:50:09] truth his plan was if I'm a prophet like
[1:50:12] they say I'm a prophet then prophets
[1:50:14] don't live like this they don't spend
[1:50:15] all their time with the people they
[1:50:17] don't have all these means they go away
[1:50:18] to the Wilderness they get a message
[1:50:19] from God they stomp out they deliver the
[1:50:21] message and they go back
[1:50:23] back and so he looks he's looking at
[1:50:26] scripture but the reason he was looking
[1:50:28] at scripture was to justify the desire
[1:50:30] of his own heart to get away from
[1:50:32] rejection to get away from the people to
[1:50:34] go hunting and fishing which is what he
[1:50:36] wanted to do and he said that wasn't
[1:50:37] right that was kind of a selfish
[1:50:39] attitude cuz that's what I wanted to
[1:50:42] do why was that so tempting for the
[1:50:44] prophet amen there was two reasons it
[1:50:46] was tempting for the prophet one he had
[1:50:49] a rejection complex because he was a
[1:50:50] child and he was feeling the pain of an
[1:50:53] offense of people rejecting his
[1:50:55] ministry and second he loved to hunt and
[1:50:59] fish so in this temptation he had a push
[1:51:03] and a
[1:51:04] pull and when he could find the
[1:51:06] scripture to go with
[1:51:09] it he was
[1:51:15] ready
[1:51:17] amen but he said that was just me I
[1:51:20] wanted to do that and God come along and
[1:51:24] stopped him and showed him that if you
[1:51:26] go on with your plans you'll become a
[1:51:28] bum and your wife won't stay up there
[1:51:30] with
[1:51:32] you why because he was choosing self and
[1:51:36] self would have brought
[1:51:38] destruction God help me to stop choosing
[1:51:42] self that's my
[1:51:45] prayer you know brother Brandon wasn't I
[1:51:48] don't think even exactly realizing what
[1:51:50] was going on inside of him
[1:51:53] he was under turmoil he was struggling
[1:51:55] with himself and he had this pressure
[1:51:57] that he want to get away from he had
[1:51:58] this pain of rejection that was coming
[1:52:01] he had this desire to be free and to be
[1:52:03] in the wilderness all of this was
[1:52:05] stirred up inside of him and I don't
[1:52:06] even know that he consciously was aware
[1:52:08] of what was
[1:52:10] happening but when God come down and
[1:52:12] spoke to him all of a sudden he realized
[1:52:14] and he came back and standing in the Gap
[1:52:15] and he was able to confess and be honest
[1:52:17] and he say that was just me that was my
[1:52:19] desire that was self
[1:52:23] that was
[1:52:25] selfishness and if the prophet of God
[1:52:27] could struggle like that what about you
[1:52:29] and I
[1:52:30] friends what about the things that we go
[1:52:33] through and the things we want to be
[1:52:34] free from the situations we want to
[1:52:36] change in our life amen and sometimes
[1:52:38] we're willing to go through things to
[1:52:40] change those situations that aren't
[1:52:41] according to the
[1:52:44] word amen trying to come up with our own
[1:52:47] Solutions our own ideas and we don't
[1:52:50] realize that it may be pain inside it
[1:52:52] may be self that we're trying to save
[1:52:55] amen and what what brother Brenham had
[1:52:57] to end up doing he had to come to terms
[1:52:58] with the fact that God said I put more
[1:53:00] gifts in you than that you're you're in
[1:53:02] an Apostolic way you've got to go out
[1:53:04] and brother bham realized I let the sick
[1:53:06] people lay because of his own hurt and
[1:53:09] he realized he was going to have to go
[1:53:11] subject himself to the same pain to
[1:53:14] fulfill the purpose of God what was that
[1:53:16] man going to have to do go right back to
[1:53:18] the place where he was
[1:53:20] hurt prise God
[1:53:24] amen listen if God doesn't feel sorry
[1:53:26] for us do we have a right to feel sorry
[1:53:28] for
[1:53:29] ourselves God wasn't feeling sorry for
[1:53:31] the prophet and say you know I
[1:53:33] understand it's been hard if you want to
[1:53:34] go to the woods for a little
[1:53:37] while no he sent him right back to the
[1:53:41] place that he suffered the pain because
[1:53:44] that was his commission that was his
[1:53:45] calling and brother Brenham had to die
[1:53:47] to himself to go back into Commission
[1:53:53] it's not easy nobody said this life was
[1:53:56] going to be
[1:53:57] easy so many times we have to enter
[1:53:59] right back into the very place where we
[1:54:01] were wounded and
[1:54:03] hurt to what to fulfill the commission
[1:54:07] God has for
[1:54:08] us we would protect
[1:54:11] ourselves we would never let that happen
[1:54:14] again
[1:54:15] sure that doesn't mean God
[1:54:19] wouldn't we would never get ourselves in
[1:54:21] a position where I can get hurt like
[1:54:22] that again how many said something like
[1:54:26] that that's not God's
[1:54:30] attitude that's just
[1:54:33] ours he showed it in the prophet he
[1:54:35] showed it in you and
[1:54:37] I there so many times I've decided that
[1:54:40] I'm never going to let myself get hurt
[1:54:41] like that
[1:54:43] again I'm never going to subject myself
[1:54:46] I'm never going to open myself up like
[1:54:48] that I'm never going to find myself in
[1:54:49] that
[1:54:50] situation but God said says forget about
[1:54:53] it I mean he doesn't say it just like
[1:54:57] that but we have a commission we have a
[1:55:00] purpose friends we have to surrender our
[1:55:04] lives and let God have his way with
[1:55:08] us you know it's not it's not easy to
[1:55:10] preach the gospel to be misunderstood to
[1:55:13] be rejected it's not easy to be a pastor
[1:55:16] you know where I want to go Northern
[1:55:18] British
[1:55:19] Columbia Hunting fish yes right it's not
[1:55:23] easy to be rejected it's not easy to
[1:55:26] have somebody misunderstand and say
[1:55:28] things that are false about you it's not
[1:55:31] easy and sometimes I want to run away
[1:55:34] and I want to say I'm never going to let
[1:55:36] that happen
[1:55:37] again but then you sleep a little bit
[1:55:39] and you pray a little bit and you say
[1:55:41] where am I going to go what else can I
[1:55:44] do we all have a cross to carry we all
[1:55:49] have to nail ourselves to that cross
[1:55:53] guess what you've been hurt you've been
[1:55:55] hurt by people in church you've been
[1:55:56] hurt by your own family you've been hurt
[1:55:58] by whatever and guess what you're going
[1:56:00] to be hurt
[1:56:02] again if you're going to be where human
[1:56:04] beings are and you're going to be a
[1:56:06] human
[1:56:08] being I mean I'm sorry I wish I could
[1:56:11] paint the picture different
[1:56:13] but if you're going to be where humans
[1:56:15] are and you have a
[1:56:18] complex which we all
[1:56:20] do and you're going to be with other
[1:56:22] human beings with
[1:56:24] complexes hey guess what you're going to
[1:56:26] cry in your pillow
[1:56:28] again but does that give me the right to
[1:56:31] stay away from fellowship does that give
[1:56:32] me the right to forbid the forsaking
[1:56:34] assembling together of ourselves does it
[1:56:37] give me a right to reject the body of
[1:56:38] Christ does it give me a right to deny
[1:56:40] the word does that give me a
[1:56:44] right I don't think it
[1:56:47] does I think in Leo deia there's a
[1:56:50] people who say I give up my rights
[1:56:53] fulfill your word amen God if that's
[1:56:55] where you want me that's where I'll be
[1:56:57] amen if
[1:56:59] that's though he slay
[1:57:02] me yet will I serve
[1:57:05] him the prophet had to go right back on
[1:57:08] the field to people he
[1:57:12] knew didn't understand his ministry and
[1:57:14] ridiculed him he went right back and I'm
[1:57:18] so glad he did because the messages he
[1:57:21] preached after after this and he
[1:57:23] preached those messages in places where
[1:57:26] they were openly mocking
[1:57:30] him you know what we wouldn't have the
[1:57:32] message the Rapture if he didn't go back
[1:57:36] to a hostile environment and finish his
[1:57:39] commission there's many messages that he
[1:57:41] preached in the west coast at the end of
[1:57:44] his ministry and he was in the midst of
[1:57:46] a hostile environment there was a debate
[1:57:49] going on whether they would have him
[1:57:50] preach anymore at the businessman's
[1:57:51] fellowship because the wives of the
[1:57:53] leaders didn't like him because he was
[1:57:54] too hard on women and there was one man
[1:57:56] that stood up for him that was Carl will
[1:57:58] will is it will Carl Williams stood up
[1:58:02] for him and said as long as I'm here and
[1:58:04] I'm the I'm the Pres I'm the I think he
[1:58:06] was the secretary he said William
[1:58:08] brandham will preach at our
[1:58:12] meetings and he knew it brother brandham
[1:58:15] knew that he stood up for him and he
[1:58:16] knew that the others didn't want him and
[1:58:18] guess what he did he went back there and
[1:58:19] preached messages that you and I needed
[1:58:21] to hear yeah
[1:58:25] amen listen you may get wounded again
[1:58:27] opening yourself up and coming back but
[1:58:29] there's somebody who needs you here
[1:58:31] there's somebody who needs you in the
[1:58:32] fellowship somebody needs you in your
[1:58:33] family somebody needs you at work some
[1:58:36] wherever it is that God's plac you
[1:58:37] somebody need you there I needed the
[1:58:40] prophet to go
[1:58:42] back
[1:58:45] amen we need each other to stay in our
[1:58:48] post of Duty and finish the
[1:58:50] commission we need
[1:58:53] you know what we need we need to get
[1:58:54] over
[1:58:55] ourselves and I don't exactly know how
[1:58:57] to do that cuz I'm struggling with
[1:58:59] myself but I need to get over
[1:59:01] myself I need God to come and give me a
[1:59:03] strength that's Supernatural I need to
[1:59:06] lay myself be and say God I'm I'm I'm
[1:59:08] staying I'm staying engaged I'm staying
[1:59:10] in place but I need you to do something
[1:59:12] to heal this heart I need you to do
[1:59:14] something to give me strength I need you
[1:59:16] to do something that I can't do for
[1:59:17] myself I know where you want me and I'll
[1:59:19] stay where you want me but you got to do
[1:59:20] something for me
[1:59:22] I need a supernatural element to help me
[1:59:25] you know I believe the prophet God I
[1:59:27] believe he had a supernatural element
[1:59:29] that helped him through the end of his
[1:59:32] ministry he admitted that he had a
[1:59:35] selfish
[1:59:37] attitude he said no selfish thing will
[1:59:41] work just listen this is a quote that
[1:59:44] brother Benjamin he read when he
[1:59:46] preached last time when he was remember
[1:59:49] the story he was talking about brother
[1:59:50] mam Saul that there was a vein of oil
[1:59:51] down there those brothers were going
[1:59:52] after it and they said that they were
[1:59:53] going to use it for the missions and
[1:59:56] they went down there and started fussing
[1:59:57] amongst themselves and they didn't hit
[1:59:59] it and they asked brother Brenham to
[2:00:00] tell him where it was and he said he
[2:00:01] wouldn't because of their attitudes they
[2:00:03] got selfishness mixed in somebody else
[2:00:06] found it nearby and we heard all that
[2:00:08] story but brother B said it won't work
[2:00:10] no selfish thing will work prise God
[2:00:14] amen amen that's another one of those I
[2:00:16] need to write on the back of my hand and
[2:00:17] I just need to realize amen I I feel
[2:00:20] like being selfish I feel like giving
[2:00:21] into my myself I feel like doing what
[2:00:23] feels good but no selfish thing will
[2:00:26] work because the whole gospel is built
[2:00:28] on
[2:00:32] sacrifice Jesus said to his disciples he
[2:00:35] said take my yoke upon you and learn of
[2:00:37] me for I am meek and lowly in heart said
[2:00:43] oh God help me to be meek and lowly in
[2:00:45] heart that's what I
[2:00:47] need brother Brenham this is the last
[2:00:50] quote that I want to read to you out of
[2:00:51] a prisoner said and tonight if we as the
[2:00:54] brandham Tabernacle could only become
[2:00:56] prisoners to our own selfish being to
[2:00:59] our own ambition that we could
[2:01:01] completely surrender ourselves and be
[2:01:02] yolked to him no matter what the rest of
[2:01:05] the world thinks what the rest of the
[2:01:06] world does we're yolked with feathers of
[2:01:09] love we are
[2:01:13] prisoners
[2:01:15] amen he was speaking to the brandham
[2:01:19] Tabernacle but this is a message for you
[2:01:21] and I amen right here this morning yes
[2:01:25] if we could only become prisoners to our
[2:01:27] own selfish being to our own ambition
[2:01:31] that we could completely surrender
[2:01:32] ourselves and be yolked to him no matter
[2:01:35] what the rest of the world thinks what
[2:01:37] the rest of the world does we're yolked
[2:01:39] with feathers of love we are prisoners
[2:01:43] amen how many times have we heard the
[2:01:45] message a
[2:01:46] prisoner and how many times have we
[2:01:48] liked it and believed it's true yes
[2:01:53] but you know those chains of
[2:01:55] love that's a willfulness you're
[2:01:57] willingly because of love you're willing
[2:01:59] to
[2:02:00] follow but what if those chains of Love
[2:02:03] ask you to go back to the place where
[2:02:05] you were hurt the
[2:02:08] worst do we like the message prisoner
[2:02:11] then is that our favorite
[2:02:14] message when the Lord's asking us to
[2:02:18] enter back in to this relationship to go
[2:02:21] back to that Fellowship to go back to
[2:02:24] that family
[2:02:26] member it's great when everybody else is
[2:02:29] a prisoner it was fantastic that Paul
[2:02:31] was a prisoner I'm
[2:02:33] glad I'm so glad brother Brandon was a
[2:02:37] prisoner but now when it comes to me
[2:02:39] being a
[2:02:40] prisoner I like the
[2:02:42] idea but the daily practice is a little
[2:02:45] rough it's a little
[2:02:48] rough and the thing about this prison
[2:02:51] sentence is it's
[2:02:52] voluntary the gates are
[2:02:55] open the gates are open there's nobody
[2:02:57] there with a shot collar there's nobody
[2:02:59] there with real literal
[2:03:01] chains this is where we get to prove
[2:03:04] whether we have love for Christ or not
[2:03:07] whether we are a prisoner
[2:03:09] voluntarily with the chains of Love or
[2:03:13] whether we still love ourselves the
[2:03:16] most listen we we have a hard time
[2:03:20] denying ourselves a meal sweet can pray
[2:03:22] for a brother who's
[2:03:23] sick we have a hard time getting up
[2:03:27] early because of
[2:03:29] self I said God I want to be a love
[2:03:33] Slave To
[2:03:34] You Lord give me more of your spirit to
[2:03:38] overcome this
[2:03:40] self amen no matter how much we want God
[2:03:43] to do everything God's left something
[2:03:45] for us to
[2:03:47] do amen we so much want God to take away
[2:03:50] all the problems and make make
[2:03:51] everything and what we really want this
[2:03:53] is what I really want I really want God
[2:03:55] to pick me up move my arms and legs make
[2:03:57] me do everything so I don't do anything
[2:03:59] wrong
[2:04:00] and but God's put himself in partnership
[2:04:03] with man he's asking you to do some
[2:04:04] things too he's asking you and I to deny
[2:04:06] ourselves he's asking us to follow him
[2:04:09] he's asking us to surrender our will to
[2:04:11] his he's asking us to give up our rights
[2:04:13] for
[2:04:14] him and he's giving us plenty of
[2:04:17] opportunities to do it and if you don't
[2:04:20] think you have enough opportunities just
[2:04:21] wait you're going to get some
[2:04:23] more I mean so many of us are ready for
[2:04:27] the firing squad we're ready to take the
[2:04:30] final stand for the message the messeng
[2:04:32] or die we're ready to go down to the
[2:04:34] face the World Council churches stand
[2:04:36] before the tribunal take whatever comes
[2:04:38] our way but I'm not going to deny the
[2:04:40] message but the problem is not there the
[2:04:43] problem is in our homes in the morning
[2:04:45] in our minds in our car in our
[2:04:47] workplaces in
[2:04:49] ourselves that's where we've got to win
[2:04:51] the battle
[2:04:52] the tribunal may come but the tribunal
[2:04:54] is going to be victorious when we're
[2:04:55] victorious in this
[2:04:58] guy God I want to be a prisoner of Jesus
[2:05:02] Christ but I need your help and guess
[2:05:05] what he sent his help when he sent the
[2:05:08] word and when the word came the fullness
[2:05:10] of the Holy Ghost came back into the
[2:05:12] church if we'll just say that's the
[2:05:14] truth my mind's lying to me this
[2:05:17] selfishness is a lie but that word is
[2:05:18] the truth the spirit of that word will
[2:05:20] give us power to over overcome as we
[2:05:23] accept it and stop making excuses for
[2:05:25] oursel but being
[2:05:27] honest and just say it's not right this
[2:05:31] is what I want but it's not right this
[2:05:32] is the way I feel but it's a lying
[2:05:34] vanity this is what my my mind's telling
[2:05:36] me but I don't accept it anymore I
[2:05:39] accept what the word says amen oh
[2:05:41] friends life isn't easy I don't expect
[2:05:44] it to get
[2:05:46] easier you've been hurt I've been hurt
[2:05:52] you're going to get hurt
[2:05:57] again Paul got hurt went to the next
[2:06:01] city and got hurt went to the next city
[2:06:04] and got
[2:06:06] hurt then he got up and went to the next
[2:06:09] city and got
[2:06:12] hurt brother Brandon preached the
[2:06:15] sermon people criticized him he went and
[2:06:19] preached another sermon people
[2:06:21] criticized
[2:06:24] there's no way around
[2:06:26] it we just put our head down and
[2:06:29] plow say God you know what's
[2:06:33] best and when I am
[2:06:35] tried I shall come forth this
[2:06:39] well it's not me but there's something
[2:06:41] in me pushing me through this life I
[2:06:44] know that it's
[2:06:45] temporary every hurt is temporary all
[2:06:49] the pain is temporary rejection is
[2:06:52] temporary criticism is temporary
[2:06:55] physical pain is temporary mental
[2:06:58] anguish is temporary depression is
[2:07:01] temporary It's All
[2:07:04] Temporary but there's a glory that lays
[2:07:07] ahead let us take our cross and walk
[2:07:10] towards the glory that lays
[2:07:12] ahead we can despise The Shame of the
[2:07:15] suffering absolutely we hate it but I
[2:07:17] love what's coming more than I hate The
[2:07:19] Shame of the of the son suffering said
[2:07:23] God give us strength to deny ourselves
[2:07:27] to take up our cross to follow you
[2:07:30] according to this word man let's all
[2:07:32] Stand
[2:07:35] Together musicians if you'll come and
[2:07:37] brother Ben please come and let's just
[2:07:40] bow our heads together and let's
[2:07:43] pray I don't know about you but I I find
[2:07:46] myself in need
[2:07:53] Lord
[2:07:55] God lord all we can say is that you are
[2:07:58] good and you do all things
[2:08:01] well your word is true and every other
[2:08:04] word is a
[2:08:07] lie God I realize like never before
[2:08:12] that I am the
[2:08:14] problem that self is the problem this
[2:08:17] hybrid flesh that I live in with a
[2:08:19] fallen mind
[2:08:22] God I need the renewing of My Mind by
[2:08:24] your
[2:08:25] word I need to hear your word receive
[2:08:28] your word surrender to your
[2:08:31] word God I pray you forgive us for
[2:08:35] yielding to the dictates of the flesh
[2:08:38] forgive us for our complaining forgive
[2:08:41] us Lord for our
[2:08:43] transgressions yes forgive us Lord that
[2:08:46] we spoke evil against the things that
[2:08:49] you meant for our good
[2:08:52] forgive us for grumbling and complaining
[2:08:54] when you're trying to bring us to
[2:08:57] Perfection God help us to
[2:09:00] surrender God I need a greater dose of
[2:09:03] surrender and I need your help to do so
[2:09:06] but I see it as my commission in this
[2:09:09] day I see it Lord as the plan that you
[2:09:10] have for me and it's what I
[2:09:13] want I see that the Apostle Paul was
[2:09:17] your prisoner I saw that your prophet in
[2:09:20] this age was your prisoner ER I've seen
[2:09:22] my brothers and sisters imprison
[2:09:24] themselves to your word and surrender
[2:09:27] and it gives me courage to do the
[2:09:29] same Lord I want to have feathers of
[2:09:32] Love attach me to you and I want to
[2:09:34] follow you wherever you lead
[2:09:36] regardless of what it does to me
[2:09:39] physically God I'm sorry for the times
[2:09:42] that I felt sorry for myself and
[2:09:44] complained in my mind and pulled away
[2:09:46] from obedience to your word I'm sorry
[2:09:49] Lord but God I'm praying that you come
[2:09:52] and that you would do for us like you
[2:09:54] did for
[2:09:55] Samson when Samson had time to think on
[2:09:58] his ways when he had time to reflect on
[2:10:02] his selfishness
[2:10:04] self-love how he got into the condition
[2:10:06] that he's in when he had time Lord to
[2:10:10] think on those things he came to one
[2:10:13] conclusion Lord let me
[2:10:16] die let me die with my
[2:10:18] enemies Use Me Lord
[2:10:22] God as we've heard your word and we
[2:10:24] reflect Lord on what you're speaking to
[2:10:26] us I just want to say Lord let me
[2:10:29] die let me die to my enemy of self let
[2:10:33] me surrender Lord to you that you might
[2:10:35] take me and you might win the victory
[2:10:37] through me for I know it won't be my
[2:10:40] strength it won't be my wisdom it won't
[2:10:42] be my abilities but it will only be my
[2:10:45] surrender that allows your strength and
[2:10:47] your word and your ability to work
[2:10:49] through me so God I must surrender for
[2:10:52] you're a gentleman and you don't force
[2:10:54] but God I want you to have your way I
[2:10:56] want to go right back into the place
[2:10:58] where I was hurt if that's what you want
[2:11:01] I want to go right back and do the thing
[2:11:03] that caused rejection if that's what you
[2:11:05] want I want to go right back to serve
[2:11:07] and right back to the place that you
[2:11:10] would have me if that's what you want
[2:11:12] for God I know that you do all things
[2:11:14] well and that you make no mistakes and
[2:11:16] you're not making a mistake with my
[2:11:18] life God I want you to have the victory
[2:11:22] in Me God I pray that you would take
[2:11:25] each one of us in your hand pour your
[2:11:28] spirit out upon us Lord let the spirit
[2:11:30] of this word that was preached find a
[2:11:33] home may this word that was preached
[2:11:35] come to life inside of us may we have
[2:11:39] resolve and strength Beyond human
[2:11:41] strength may your spirit move us Lord to
[2:11:44] surrender in a greater way to bring this
[2:11:46] flesh subject to your word may we be
[2:11:49] like Paul Lord as we're striving for the
[2:11:51] Mastery may we keep under our bodies to
[2:11:54] keep it subject to this word so that
[2:11:56] we'll not be found to Cast Away but may
[2:11:59] we be found in the center of your will
[2:12:01] serving your purpose come rain or shine
[2:12:04] good days bad days may we be serving
[2:12:06] your purpose through it all and may we
[2:12:09] rejoice in your goodness to carry us
[2:12:11] through and God give us a Clear Vision
[2:12:13] of what lays ahead that we might have
[2:12:15] the courage and the strength to press
[2:12:17] on God bring a greater revelation of the
[2:12:20] millennial Reign the greater revelation
[2:12:22] of the marriage supper the greater
[2:12:24] revelation of a theophany body Lord may
[2:12:26] it give us courage to press
[2:12:29] on because we know Lord at the end of
[2:12:32] this journey is the greatest rewards far
[2:12:34] greater than we could ever mention far
[2:12:36] greater we could ever
[2:12:38] imagine God help us to look
[2:12:41] ahead God we love you we ask your
[2:12:44] blessings over all that's said and done
[2:12:47] may you use the word to shape us into
[2:12:50] your image
[2:12:52] may you take the sword of the word may
