[17:19] [Music]
[17:24] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[17:27] dear lord jesus we appreciate you so
[17:29] much lord
[17:31] so thankful to be gathered together lord
[17:34] as a sign of your faithfulness in our
[17:36] lives you've brought us back together
[17:38] once again
[17:39] to hear your word
[17:40] lord we love you we love to sing your
[17:42] praises and sing of your glory and your
[17:44] goodness to us
[17:46] and now god we want to turn our
[17:48] attention to your word that you so
[17:49] graciously have given us in this hour
[17:52] and god may we feed from your hand as
[17:54] you break the bread of life to us
[17:56] may you give us that portion we need in
[17:58] something that'll open our eyes to
[18:00] recognize the day and the hour we're
[18:02] living lord and what you're doing in and
[18:04] through us
[18:06] may we be more yielded than ever before
[18:08] and make a greater surrender than ever
[18:10] before that you might accomplish your
[18:13] work in this hour
[18:14] we love you we pray you would take
[18:16] preeminence as we yield ourselves to you
[18:18] that you would speak lord that we would
[18:20] have ears to hear
[18:22] in jesus christ's name we pray
[18:24] amen
[18:26] and god bless you if we could while
[18:27] we're standing turn together to genesis
[18:30] chapter 1.
[18:33] amen
[18:36] genesis chapter 1
[18:39] and verse 27.
[18:47] genesis chapter 1 verse 27
[18:50] so god created man in his own image in
[18:52] the image of god created he him
[18:54] male and female created he them
[18:57] and god blessed them and god said unto
[18:59] them be fruitful and multiply and
[19:01] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[19:03] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[19:05] and over the fowl of the air and over
[19:07] every living thing that moveth upon the
[19:09] earth
[19:10] you may be seated amen
[19:12] we'll ask god to bless us as we look
[19:14] into this word and he would give us a
[19:16] spirit of revelation
[19:18] and then when we look at this
[19:20] commandment that's given
[19:22] to
[19:23] to god
[19:24] to god's creation he said
[19:27] to man he said and god blessed them and
[19:29] god said unto them be fruitful and
[19:32] multiply and replenish the earth and
[19:34] subdue it and so we know there's a
[19:36] commandment and that commandment carries
[19:38] with it
[19:39] a prophecy amen
[19:41] and this is the word of god the word of
[19:43] god is is prophetic and brother benham
[19:45] says this and the spoken word is the
[19:47] original seed he said adam's bride could
[19:50] not wait god had told adam and eve
[19:53] multiply and replenish the earth it was
[19:55] an oncoming thing a promise
[19:59] and then he says again further down now
[20:01] adam's bride could not wait but she went
[20:03] forward first that's the way today the
[20:06] bride today she wants to manufacture
[20:08] something glory to god she's got to work
[20:10] it up on the platform she's got to have
[20:12] everything see see what is she doing
[20:14] manufacturing something and we know this
[20:17] you know we know the story so well in
[20:19] the book of genesis we've talked about
[20:21] it so much but i just want to take a
[20:23] look at it as we as we move forward
[20:25] because they were given a prophecy they
[20:27] were given the word to keep and part of
[20:29] that was to to multiply and replenish
[20:31] amen but but brother branham told us
[20:34] that eve could not wait amen she got
[20:36] ahead of the program she got ahead of
[20:38] god's program she could not wait and she
[20:40] was in thai she was led astray by the
[20:43] serpent and she took the serpent's words
[20:45] and and she fell and she brought the
[20:47] fall but it was because she was
[20:50] impatient with the word of god
[20:52] it was because she could not wait amen
[20:55] for god to bring the revelation of how
[20:57] bring the revelation of when or whatever
[20:59] revelation he would bring amen to mark
[21:02] the timing for this prophecy to be
[21:04] fulfilled she couldn't wait she got
[21:06] ahead she moved forward she went ahead
[21:09] and she went ahead of adam amen and so
[21:12] we find that
[21:13] it created
[21:15] a big problem
[21:17] and and tonight you know i want to
[21:19] minister on i've got this title
[21:22] unlocking the power of the prophecy by
[21:25] submission
[21:27] unlocking the power of the prophecy by
[21:30] submission
[21:33] when we think of power
[21:36] and we think of powerful things and
[21:38] powerful demonstrations
[21:40] we don't often think of submission
[21:41] because submission looks like something
[21:43] that's low or weak or humble and it
[21:46] doesn't always go together with power
[21:49] power submission they bring two
[21:51] different things to mind
[21:53] but i'm not talking about unlocking the
[21:54] power of the prophecy
[21:56] by submission and really i've been on
[21:58] this same subject for over a week now
[22:00] for about two weeks and i can't get off
[22:02] of it i wanted to go another direction
[22:04] and i just can't break away from it god
[22:06] keeps bringing me back to this so these
[22:08] are many of the things we've been
[22:09] talking about we're not talking about
[22:11] something brand new or we're not off on
[22:12] to a different subject this is very much
[22:15] in the theme of what we've been
[22:16] preaching but we noticed that that eve
[22:20] at adam the man
[22:23] was commissioned to bring forth and
[22:24] replenish and we know according to the
[22:26] word that he was given a bride to
[22:28] reproduce himself amen but before that
[22:32] god amen could could bring a further
[22:34] revelation she took the serpent's word
[22:37] she couldn't wait she got ahead of the
[22:39] program and instead of bringing forth
[22:41] life she produced death
[22:43] and we're all suffering from that
[22:45] decision
[22:46] so further down in spoken word the
[22:49] prophet of god says when god
[22:51] give a commission which cannot perish
[22:54] god's word is eternal it cannot fail
[22:57] when he said multiply and replenish the
[22:59] earth that was god's eternal purpose to
[23:01] carry that out you cannot die
[23:04] because it's his word you have to live
[23:06] if that child had been brought forth
[23:08] right there'd have been no death but she
[23:11] couldn't wait
[23:13] so now we see the problem is she could
[23:16] not wait she and brother brown says and
[23:19] when the scripture says she was beguiled
[23:21] she was deceived she thought she was
[23:23] doing right she knew what the prophecy
[23:25] was she had a desire amen but she she
[23:28] wasn't waiting and then she went ahead
[23:30] and that was the problem
[23:32] brother braham says in the other in this
[23:34] message there is only one way provided
[23:37] by god for anything in 1963
[23:40] there has never been anything that ever
[23:42] beat god's way on anything
[23:44] i don't care what it is if people would
[23:46] just don't try to inject their own ideas
[23:50] but just take it the way god said it
[23:52] believing it see it seems to be so hard
[23:55] for man just to get out of his own ideas
[23:58] just he's got to have something to do
[24:00] into it himself he has always gummed up
[24:04] if you use if you excuse the expression
[24:06] he has always gummed up god's way for
[24:08] him by injecting his own way into it and
[24:11] that's exactly what eve did through the
[24:13] serpent's wisdom she took that wisdom
[24:16] and injected her own idea she injected
[24:18] her own way and ruined the plan of god
[24:20] amen
[24:21] and so if she would have just waited
[24:23] there was a prophecy there there was a
[24:25] word and she was the right woman
[24:29] she was the right one she had the right
[24:31] word if she would have just waited
[24:33] everything god said would have come to
[24:35] pass and remember she just couldn't wait
[24:37] she thought she was doing right she went
[24:39] ahead of the program of god and it
[24:41] brought death because it wasn't the word
[24:43] of god it was the word of god mixed with
[24:46] reasoning amen and it brought death amen
[24:48] and he said you never beat god's way on
[24:51] anything amen just take god's way you'll
[24:54] never beat god's way on anything
[24:57] let's turn over to genesis chapter 3
[25:04] and read verse 14.
[25:10] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[25:12] because thou has done this thou art
[25:14] cursed above all cattle and above every
[25:16] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[25:18] thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the
[25:20] days of thy life
[25:22] and i will put enmity between thee and
[25:24] the woman and between thy seed and her
[25:27] seed
[25:28] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[25:30] bruise his heel
[25:33] so here comes another prophecy
[25:35] involving the woman
[25:37] the first prophecy was to replenish the
[25:40] multiply and replenish and the woman got
[25:43] ahead of the program and and and messed
[25:46] up that plan and brought death instead
[25:48] of life but now there's another prophecy
[25:51] that involves the seed of the woman amen
[25:53] and this is this is the mention of
[25:55] christ coming into the scene that
[25:57] there's going to be a seed of the woman
[25:59] that will bruise the head of the serpent
[26:00] and he'll bruise his heel and the seat
[26:02] of a woman is the prophecy of coming
[26:04] christ and so now there's another
[26:06] prophecy laying down that's attached to
[26:09] the woman amen and what we find is when
[26:11] we go back and look through the bible
[26:14] amen we start to recognize by the by the
[26:16] understanding that the message has given
[26:18] us we go to see that these prophecies
[26:21] this plan of god this program that god
[26:23] has had it is so intrically linked to
[26:26] the woman amen all the way down through
[26:28] the bible that you know that the woman
[26:29] is also the type of the bride and you
[26:32] can see where she's messed up all the
[26:34] way down through the line she's messed
[26:36] up by taking her own idea she's messed
[26:38] up by not waiting amen even sarah she
[26:41] she failed in the plan of god because
[26:43] she wouldn't wait so she took her own
[26:45] idea to bring about the promise and she
[26:47] and she messed up the whole works
[26:50] so this has always been the problem all
[26:52] the way down through so god lays down
[26:54] here a prophecy the seed of the woman
[26:57] and and no doubt there was all kinds of
[27:00] ideas floating around about the seed of
[27:02] the woman and and what that meant and
[27:05] and how it would come to pass and i'm
[27:07] sure there was a ton of speculation
[27:09] how many thinks anything's changed amen
[27:12] i'm sure there was a ton of speculation
[27:14] as they would read this and the seat of
[27:16] the woman
[27:17] it's coming out of the woman the nation
[27:19] it's coming from this one it's coming
[27:21] from that and there's all kinds of
[27:22] speculation but isaiah would come in
[27:25] chapter 7 and say a virgin shall
[27:27] conceive amen and that's a further
[27:29] prophecy amen right in line with this
[27:31] prophecy a virgin a virgin shall
[27:34] conceive amen and isaiah's picking up
[27:36] this prophecy and carrying it the next
[27:38] step further and now it broke out into
[27:41] all kinds of speculation amen was he
[27:43] speaking of uh who was he speaking of
[27:45] the high priest daughter brother branham
[27:46] tells us all this i was speaking of the
[27:49] the nation of israel bringing forth
[27:51] what's the what is it so there's
[27:52] speculation going on all over the place
[27:55] there's conversation going on all over
[27:57] the place amen and they're speculating
[27:59] maybe it's this and maybe it's that and
[28:01] has it already happened is it going to
[28:03] happen but they're come on the scene in
[28:05] angel visitation one day when it was
[28:07] time for the prophecy to go into full
[28:09] effect amen god did it in a way that man
[28:12] could not tamper with it he sent an
[28:14] angel messenger to a virgin amen in an
[28:17] outer way a place not in a temple not in
[28:19] a tabernacle amen but as she was going
[28:21] to fetch water in her hometown he did it
[28:24] and bypassed all the theology he
[28:27] bypassed every system amen he went
[28:29] around all the things that have always
[28:31] messed up his works and he comes
[28:33] straight to the little virgin himself
[28:38] praise be to god
[28:42] so he he he comes
[28:45] brother branham says this way and
[28:48] turning northward
[28:49] from 1961
[28:51] but we always try to put our ideas in it
[28:55] and that when we inject our ideas when
[28:57] we inject our theology into god's spirit
[29:00] it takes god's spirit away
[29:03] that's the way it was in that day they
[29:05] were on the road but they wanted
[29:06] something they could do themselves and
[29:09] now we know he's speaking of the nation
[29:10] israel they had been brought out with a
[29:12] mighty hand they had been redeemed out
[29:14] of egypt they were on their way to
[29:16] fulfill the word of god the promise that
[29:18] was given to abraham and they're moving
[29:20] by the leadership of god everything is
[29:22] going fine amen everything's going
[29:24] perfect his angel is leading them all
[29:26] the way to the promised land amen but
[29:28] they refused the voice of god and now
[29:30] they wanted a law because brother
[29:32] brennan said they wanted something they
[29:33] could do into themselves and oh my
[29:36] goodness i don't want anything that i'm
[29:38] required to do myself because i will
[29:40] mess it up amen
[29:43] that we realize even when god was going
[29:45] to give the the commandment to them and
[29:48] and the ordinances through moses moses
[29:50] went up on the mountain he was up on
[29:52] mount sinai for 40 days
[29:54] and they couldn't wait 40 days in the
[29:57] absence of moses they begin to get
[29:59] scared amen maybe he won't come back
[30:01] maybe god's taken him amen and they
[30:04] already within 40 days by their own
[30:06] anxiety and nervousness they decide to
[30:09] push aaron into making a golden calf
[30:12] that they might worship the god that led
[30:14] them up out of israel they were lost
[30:16] amen with no headship with moses being
[30:19] gone and the woman decided that she
[30:21] needed to make her own god to represent
[30:24] the god that brought her out of egypt so
[30:26] she could worship because we don't know
[30:27] what's become of moses
[30:30] it's the same thing that's happened all
[30:32] the way down through they just couldn't
[30:35] wait
[30:37] they couldn't just trust god
[30:41] and wait
[30:42] they got nervous
[30:44] because nothing's happening
[30:47] they got nervous because it's been so
[30:49] long
[30:50] they got nervous because 40 days and now
[30:54] we're in this betwixt in between
[30:58] right who will lead us what will happen
[31:00] we've come out amen
[31:02] we know we're going to the promise amen
[31:05] but as of this moses we don't know
[31:06] what's become of him amen it wasn't it
[31:11] showed that they were in a state of
[31:13] immaturity because what they were doing
[31:16] was now going back to what they saw in
[31:18] egypt amen they were going right back to
[31:21] the denominational idea make a golden
[31:23] calf and worship the god that led us out
[31:25] of egypt
[31:26] they had seen that in egypt and they
[31:29] were turning back because they got
[31:31] impatient and couldn't wait for god to
[31:33] finish what god was going to do god's
[31:36] the one who brought them out with a
[31:37] mighty hand and god's the one who
[31:39] promised to take him into the promised
[31:40] land it wasn't a lack of faith in moses
[31:43] this was expressing a lack of faith in
[31:45] god who brought them out and they
[31:47] weren't sure that he would take them in
[31:50] they had to inject something of their
[31:53] own because they couldn't wait
[31:56] and then
[31:57] they they
[31:59] you know we we understand what happened
[32:01] moses now returns and there's a judgment
[32:03] that comes and
[32:04] and god you know they continue on the
[32:06] journey but they they asked for a law
[32:10] because they couldn't take the straight
[32:12] word of god right from the mouth of god
[32:14] they wanted something to go in between
[32:16] and they wanted something that they
[32:18] could do themselves and this has always
[32:20] been the problem with man he always
[32:22] wants to put his hand to the wheel but
[32:24] every time he puts his hand to the wheel
[32:26] he ruins the program of god
[32:30] every time
[32:31] but he always thinks
[32:33] it's amazing he always thinks god needs
[32:35] my help
[32:39] always thinks god needs me because
[32:41] that's not entirely untrue
[32:45] brother branham said god has so worked
[32:46] his plan he so worked his plan that his
[32:49] plan cannot move without you and i
[32:52] that god put himself in partnership with
[32:53] man is that right and we're his hands
[32:56] we're his feet we're his mouth so
[32:58] there's a truth but the truth with the
[33:01] wrong concept of that truth brings death
[33:04] not life
[33:07] because we think that that you know
[33:09] because my hands are his hands he has no
[33:12] hands but mine he has no feet but mine
[33:14] no mouth but mine amen then we start to
[33:17] think he needs my brain too he doesn't
[33:19] need your brain he just needs your body
[33:21] amen
[33:23] amen he's not after your thinking he's
[33:25] not after what you think about something
[33:27] he needs your hands he needs your feet
[33:29] he needs your mouth he needs your eyes
[33:31] he needs your ears but if you could just
[33:33] leave your thinking out of it amen we
[33:35] would be getting further down the road
[33:37] amen
[33:39] amen
[33:40] so so
[33:42] we can take the truth
[33:44] and get the wrong concept with the truth
[33:48] it's the truth god's on partnership with
[33:51] man he works through man he does nothing
[33:54] without man
[33:55] is that true
[33:57] it's true
[33:59] but so then
[34:01] we think now sometimes then i have to do
[34:04] something and that's what i want to talk
[34:06] about today
[34:08] and it's true there's things we need to
[34:10] do
[34:11] but the things we need to do
[34:13] is not come up with our own
[34:15] understanding
[34:17] and not figure out our own way in fact
[34:20] not to figure out anything i mean we
[34:23] need to we need to drop that idea right
[34:25] away
[34:26] so i want to look at this prophecy let's
[34:29] go to luke chapter one
[34:31] look to the fulfillment of the prophecy
[34:33] of the seed of the woman
[34:37] come to the new testament
[34:42] and pick it up in luke
[34:45] chapter 1.
[34:54] all right luke 1 and verse 26
[34:59] and then the sixth month the angel
[35:01] gabriel was sent from god unto a city of
[35:03] galilee named nazareth to a virgin
[35:06] espoused to a man whose name was joseph
[35:09] of the house of david and the virgin's
[35:11] name was mary
[35:14] and the angel came in unto her and said
[35:17] hail thou art highly favored and the
[35:19] lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[35:21] women
[35:22] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[35:25] his saying and cast in her mind what
[35:27] manner of salutation this should be and
[35:30] the angel said unto her fear not mary
[35:32] for thou hast found favor with god and
[35:34] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[35:36] and bring forth a son and shalt call his
[35:39] name jesus he shall be great and shall
[35:42] be called the son of the highest and the
[35:44] lord god shall give unto him the throne
[35:46] of his father david and he shall reign
[35:48] over the house of jacob forever and of
[35:51] his kingdom there shall be no end
[35:53] then said mary unto the unto the angel
[35:56] how shall this be seeing i know not a
[35:58] man
[35:59] now let's just stop and look at this for
[36:01] a minute here comes the time for the
[36:03] fulfillment of the prophecy it's been
[36:05] laying now for thousands of years but
[36:08] it's come time it's god's appointed time
[36:10] and you could do nothing to move this
[36:13] into place faster than god's time
[36:16] there's been a prophecy laying there in
[36:18] genesis 3 they've been looking at it for
[36:20] thousands of years isaiah come later a
[36:23] thou more than a thousand years later
[36:25] and he lays down the furtherance of the
[36:26] prophecy a virgin shall conceive and
[36:29] it's been laying there for 700 years to
[36:31] this point approximately 700 years to
[36:33] this point and they've been watching it
[36:35] and surmising about it and and
[36:38] contemplating it and trying to
[36:40] understand when will it be fulfilled how
[36:42] will it be fulfilled has it already been
[36:44] filled been fulfilled will it be
[36:45] fulfilled in the future
[36:48] they're asking all of these questions
[36:52] but god knew exactly when exactly where
[36:55] and exactly how
[36:57] and in god's appointed time he didn't
[37:00] consult with anybody else he just came
[37:04] he sent an angel messenger from the
[37:06] presence of the lord and he stepped on
[37:08] the scene and he comes straight to the
[37:10] woman and not the high priest but the
[37:12] woman who the prophecy was referring to
[37:15] and said
[37:16] hail thou mary highly favored and she
[37:18] had no idea what her proper
[37:20] identification was but it was the angel
[37:22] from the lord who told her who she was
[37:24] amen she thought she was a little virgin
[37:27] girl from nazareth a spouse to a man
[37:28] named joseph that was only part of her
[37:31] story but the other part of her story
[37:33] was going to be revealed to her by this
[37:35] messenger that came from the presence of
[37:37] the lord was going to tell her you've
[37:39] got a place in prophecy you've got a
[37:41] place in the word it's more than what
[37:43] you think amen you're the one that was
[37:46] he was referring to in genesis 3 and in
[37:49] isaiah 7.
[37:52] and he begins to tell her that you're
[37:54] going to conceive of the lord you're
[37:56] going to have a child and mary goes
[37:59] right back to old thinking
[38:04] she goes right back to
[38:06] how am i going to do this
[38:13] how am i
[38:15] going to do this
[38:18] and that altogether is wrong thinking
[38:25] she says
[38:27] let's read it again in verse 34 then
[38:29] said mary unto the angel how shall this
[38:31] be seeing i know not a man
[38:34] she's asking how will i do this
[38:37] i'm not married i'm a virgin
[38:40] all her understanding
[38:42] all her ideas would not allow there's
[38:46] the calculation always came up to zero
[38:49] her ideas could not compute how will i
[38:52] do this and listen what he says and the
[38:54] angel answered and said unto her the
[38:56] holy ghost shall come upon thee and the
[38:58] power of the highest shall overshadow
[39:00] thee therefore also that holy thing
[39:02] which shall be born of thee shall be
[39:03] called the son of god and behold thy
[39:06] cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived
[39:09] a son in her old age and this is the
[39:11] sixth month with her who was called
[39:13] barren for with god nothing shall be
[39:16] impossible
[39:17] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[39:19] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[39:22] and the angel departed from her
[39:25] so she asked the question how to tell
[39:28] this thing be
[39:29] saying i know no man
[39:31] and he said
[39:33] well you've got to do this you've got to
[39:36] go to more services and you've got to
[39:38] pray a little bit harder and if you fast
[39:40] for a while
[39:46] if you
[39:48] if you just
[39:49] are a little more serious and if you
[39:51] just work a little harder
[39:56] what he tells her
[39:57] has nothing to do with any effort of
[40:00] hers at all
[40:03] the answer to her question did not
[40:06] involve her effort did not involve her
[40:09] works did not involve her good behavior
[40:12] it did not involve her whatsoever this
[40:15] was something god was going to do in her
[40:18] not something she was going to do
[40:20] herself
[40:23] and the angel answer verse 35 said the
[40:25] holy ghost shall come upon thee
[40:27] and the power of the highest shall
[40:29] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[40:31] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[40:34] be called the son of god
[40:36] and she she asked the question how those
[40:39] should wha
[40:40] how will this be what should i do how is
[40:43] this going to happen uh what are what
[40:46] are the steps that i should take amen
[40:48] and the angel said
[40:51] nothing
[40:53] the holy ghost is going to overshadow
[40:56] you the power of the highest is going to
[40:58] come upon you it's something god is
[41:00] going to do himself in you and she said
[41:03] be it unto me according to your word
[41:08] now you see
[41:10] god wasn't going to require mary to do
[41:13] anything there's no way
[41:16] there was no way that mary could bring
[41:18] this prophecy to pass on her own there
[41:20] was nothing she could do to conceive as
[41:22] a virgin there was nothing she could do
[41:25] to bring forth the seat of the woman it
[41:27] was an impossibility for her to produce
[41:30] this word amen but they had never the
[41:33] the whole concept the whole idea amen
[41:36] that the the jews were stuck in at that
[41:37] time is to serve god i must do amen and
[41:41] in serving god i take a sacrifice and
[41:42] serving god i go to the feast days and
[41:44] serving god i do this this and this so
[41:46] if anything's going to happen it's going
[41:48] to happen as i do the the works that are
[41:52] laid out for me to do but here comes a
[41:54] time when god's going to fulfill his own
[41:56] word she's the vessel that's preordained
[41:58] from before the foundation of the world
[42:00] to bring forth this seed she has no
[42:03] concept but god knows and he comes to
[42:05] her in the right time and the right
[42:07] season and says you're going to be the
[42:08] one and she goes to the most logical
[42:10] question how's this going to happen and
[42:12] he says it's not going to be anything
[42:14] that you do whatsoever this is going to
[42:17] be the holy ghost and the power of the
[42:19] highest
[42:24] but there is a critical part
[42:27] where she says be it unto me
[42:32] brother branham said that god never
[42:34] works outside a free moral agency
[42:37] and that god is a gentleman and he never
[42:39] forces his way upon anybody
[42:42] amen so the prophecy
[42:44] for 2 000 years was locked up
[42:49] that uh
[42:50] the the prophecy that the seed of the
[42:53] woman shall bruise her head it was
[42:54] locked up
[42:56] the prophecy for 700 years that that
[42:59] that uh virgin shall conceive
[43:02] it was locked up
[43:04] and in god's time he was coming to
[43:07] unlock that prophecy
[43:09] and he had chosen the vessel he had
[43:12] decided the method
[43:14] he had everything laid out
[43:17] all he needed was one thing
[43:20] he needed a willing vessel
[43:23] he needed the woman to say
[43:25] be it unto me
[43:27] according to thy word
[43:30] because the holy ghost would never
[43:32] violate her free moral agency and the
[43:34] holy ghost would never be an uh
[43:36] ungentlemanly he would never force
[43:38] himself upon her and so she had to be a
[43:41] willing vessel she had to be a
[43:43] surrendered vessel she had to say be it
[43:46] unto me so you if you think about this
[43:49] the prophecy
[43:51] that has been laying for years that that
[43:53] is the whole hope of mankind amen it's
[43:56] locked up amen in the submission of this
[44:00] woman
[44:02] think about
[44:03] think about
[44:05] moses
[44:07] moses was born a proper child
[44:10] he was born under a sign the prophet
[44:12] tells us he was born to be the deliverer
[44:14] of israel amen but but he had tried in
[44:18] his own efforts with his own idea and
[44:19] with his own works he had tried to start
[44:22] the deliverance and in starting the
[44:24] deliverance he had killed one egyptian
[44:26] and and he had gotten uh some
[44:28] condemnation over that and he ran to the
[44:31] wilderness to hide
[44:33] that was his effort
[44:35] he was the right man
[44:37] he was he he was coming on the scene and
[44:40] roughly the right time
[44:42] but with his own idea in his own effort
[44:45] it was a complete flop he utterly failed
[44:47] he ran into the wilderness and now he's
[44:50] the he is the chosen vessel he's the one
[44:53] born under the sign he was born to be
[44:55] the the redeemer amen he's the one and
[44:59] so now god in his appointed time has to
[45:01] come to
[45:02] him and when god comes to him
[45:06] now you know
[45:08] moses has gotten to the place where he
[45:10] didn't want to go
[45:12] he didn't think he could go he didn't
[45:13] think he was good enough he didn't think
[45:15] they would accept him i mean he had a
[45:16] whole list of reasons why he ought not
[45:18] to go and so if you begin to read in the
[45:21] scripture there is set up the most
[45:23] ridiculous dialogue in the world between
[45:26] moses and god
[45:28] god says you're going to be the one and
[45:30] he says i can't do it
[45:33] they won't listen to me
[45:35] they they won't believe me
[45:36] and he says okay stick your hand in your
[45:39] bosom pull it out it's leprosy put it
[45:40] back in all right now they'll listen to
[45:42] you he says what if they still don't
[45:43] listen to me he said take that rod throw
[45:45] it down okay they'll listen if they
[45:46] don't listen to the voice of the first
[45:47] sign they'll listen to the voice of the
[45:48] second sign and he says but i can't talk
[45:51] you know i i don't know and and he's
[45:54] arguing with god and you're thinking how
[45:56] can god tolerate
[45:58] this like moses is talking to god god
[46:02] says i'm sending you and he says i can't
[46:04] do it
[46:06] you go and he gives him a supernatural
[46:09] sign he says they still won't receive me
[46:11] he gives him a second supernatural sign
[46:13] and then he still doubts and he says but
[46:16] you know i can't speak and he says well
[46:18] i'll give you aaron your brother to be
[46:20] your prophet and you'll be you'll be a
[46:21] god and he'll be your prophet and he and
[46:23] he goes through all of this until the
[46:25] anger of the lord is kindled against
[46:27] moses and you think how could god
[46:29] tolerate this it's because god has no
[46:32] other choice this is the only man that
[46:35] can go and do it and god cannot violate
[46:38] his free moral agency go ahead and he
[46:40] says i can't do it he says i'll give you
[46:41] a sign i still can't do it i'll give you
[46:43] another sign i can't do this i'll give
[46:44] you air it looks like god is giving in
[46:47] to moses and giving in to moses and we
[46:49] know all of this plays into the program
[46:51] of god because each of these signs
[46:53] represent something amen they they
[46:55] they're symbolic and they're meaningful
[46:57] but if you look at the dialogue it's
[46:59] utterly ridiculous how many of us would
[47:01] get in that conversation with god
[47:05] i'd be scared to death
[47:08] right
[47:09] but god doesn't have a plan b
[47:14] it's moses
[47:16] moses is the one
[47:18] there's no plan b
[47:20] so when moses needs something else god
[47:21] gives it to him
[47:23] but most said i can't do this he solves
[47:25] this and this and this until the anger
[47:27] of the lord is kindled against mother
[47:29] he's getting angry with moses but he
[47:31] can't smite him dead if he smote him
[47:33] dead he'd have to resurrect him
[47:35] he's the only choice so god is working
[47:39] listen god is working with moses
[47:43] to get moses to yield to his will
[47:47] because god has no other plan it's moses
[47:50] he's the one and this is the time
[47:54] and so finally
[47:56] god convinces him
[47:59] to go
[48:00] i mean this dialogue is fascinating to
[48:03] me
[48:05] and he goes
[48:06] think about brother branham brother
[48:08] branham was told amen by the whirlwind
[48:10] in the tree don't ever smoke or drink or
[48:12] defile thy body in any way for when
[48:14] you're older there's a work for you to
[48:15] do and brother brenham's on the river
[48:17] and a boat with his dad and his dad's
[48:19] buddy and then his dad's friend offers
[48:21] him a drink and he says no because he's
[48:23] got a commission and he's been told by a
[48:25] whirlwind a voice out of a whirlwind and
[48:28] and he says i got so many boys on only
[48:30] one of them is a and brother
[48:32] branham determined that he was going to
[48:34] drink amen what was in that bottle
[48:36] before he put it to his lips amen god
[48:38] didn't smash the bottle he didn't fling
[48:40] it out of his hand but god caused the
[48:43] noise supernatural noise of the
[48:45] whirlwind the ring in his ears to remind
[48:47] him until brother branham dropped the
[48:49] bottle himself
[48:51] why because there's not a plan b he's
[48:53] the one
[48:55] amen
[48:58] praise be to god
[49:01] so what was it that god needed from
[49:03] moses
[49:05] did he did he meet his military
[49:07] understanding
[49:09] did he need his egyptian education
[49:13] he didn't even need
[49:15] apparently he stuttered
[49:18] so god wasn't even looking for an
[49:20] eloquent speaker
[49:23] what skill what ability what knowledge
[49:26] was god looking for in moses he wasn't
[49:28] looking for any he was just looking for
[49:30] a yielded vessel and he kept working
[49:33] with moses and working with moses what
[49:34] did he need from moses he needed a
[49:37] surrender that's all he needed from
[49:39] moses is was moses's submission
[49:44] what was locking up the prophecy
[49:47] moses's submission
[49:49] what unlocked the prophecy the power of
[49:51] the prophecy and put the prophecy in the
[49:53] motion when moses finally agreed to go
[50:01] mary
[50:02] could never have given herself a seed
[50:05] she could have never brought forth a
[50:07] baby
[50:08] in her condition
[50:10] god come to her she didn't go to god
[50:14] she wasn't asking for this to happen
[50:17] is that right
[50:18] god determined who god determined when
[50:21] god determined how and he came to her
[50:23] and when we come to her he only needed
[50:25] one thing from her
[50:27] and that was her surrender
[50:30] all he needed was her submission
[50:33] to him
[50:35] and when she submitted to him
[50:38] he did everything else
[50:45] let's look
[50:47] a little further in luke
[50:51] as soon as mary receives this from the
[50:53] angel it says in verse 39 and mary arose
[50:56] in those days and went into the hill
[50:58] country with haste into a city of judah
[51:00] and entered into the house of zacharias
[51:02] and saluted elizabeth and it came to
[51:04] pass that when elizabeth heard the
[51:06] salutation of mary the babe leapt in her
[51:09] womb and elizabeth was filled with the
[51:11] holy ghost here we have a supernatural
[51:14] event taking place
[51:16] mary is coming in and she's saluting or
[51:18] greeting her cousin elizabeth and what
[51:21] was that greeting well we know because
[51:23] brother branham tells us she tells
[51:25] elizabeth in the greeting what happened
[51:27] and that she was going to have a baby
[51:28] and his name was jesus and as soon as
[51:30] she spoke the name jesus john the
[51:33] baptist who was laying as dead within
[51:35] elizabeth sprung to life
[51:39] amen
[51:40] because now
[51:42] one woman carrying a promise
[51:45] speaks to another woman carrying a
[51:47] promise
[51:49] and the woman with the promise
[51:51] when she speaks the promise that's
[51:53] within her brings life to the promise
[51:56] that's in the other woman
[51:58] hallelujah
[51:59] an elizabeth filled with the holy ghost
[52:02] begins to prophesy amen at the same time
[52:05] her husband is mute
[52:08] and her husband has been deemed mute
[52:10] because he doubted the promise
[52:14] zacharias in the temple met the same
[52:16] angel amen that mary met and he doubted
[52:19] the promise and he was made dumb he was
[52:22] made a mute he come out of there could
[52:23] not speak amen because the old system of
[52:26] church doubted the timing of the promise
[52:29] amen so the old system of the church the
[52:31] ministry was their mouth was shut and
[52:34] now god is going to speak through the
[52:36] woman
[52:37] because it very much matches the day
[52:39] that we're in now god is speaking
[52:42] through his bride amen and because she
[52:44] she has received the promise and now
[52:47] mary at the time that her husband's a
[52:49] mute amen and because of his doubt she
[52:52] is now elizabeth now is prophesying over
[52:55] mary
[52:56] amen
[52:57] amen you think when we get together to
[52:59] fellowship we're just talking but if
[53:01] you're carrying a promise inside of you
[53:03] amen for this day and somebody else is a
[53:06] promise in them but it may be laying
[53:08] dormant it may be dead it may not they
[53:10] may not have felt it warm and kick and
[53:13] move around inside of them yet but if
[53:15] you've got a promise in you and you just
[53:17] go begin to speak what the angel has
[53:19] told you amen it may just bring to life
[53:22] the promise that's laying in another
[53:23] woman
[53:28] be to god
[53:30] i love when we get into the new
[53:31] testament it's so different
[53:34] matthew opens up with the genealogy of
[53:38] christ and instead of father begot son
[53:41] begot son begot son now has injected all
[53:44] these women
[53:46] now we have rahab and now where are all
[53:48] these women coming in to the bible in
[53:51] the new testament
[53:53] because the old testament is jesus
[53:55] christ the new testament
[53:58] what's the bride the new testament
[54:01] that's all
[54:02] he was the fulfillment of the old
[54:04] testament she's the fulfillment of the
[54:06] new testament
[54:07] so the new testament launches out in
[54:09] matthew with a genealogy that has five
[54:12] women included
[54:14] the fifth is lady grace mary we're
[54:16] talking about
[54:18] luke launches out amen in the beginning
[54:20] chapter one and you've got the angel
[54:23] coming to a woman you've got conception
[54:25] coming to a barren woman the angel
[54:26] coming and bringing conception to a
[54:28] virgin woman amen the virgin woman
[54:30] speaking to the barren woman both of
[54:32] them with a promised word inside of them
[54:34] the one speaks amen the other one has
[54:36] the promise come to life and begins to
[54:38] prophesy
[54:42] she goes on to say
[54:44] verse 41
[54:46] we'll read that again and it came to
[54:47] pass that when elizabeth heard the
[54:49] salutation of mary the babe leapt in her
[54:51] womb and elizabeth was filled with the
[54:53] holy ghost and she spake out with a loud
[54:55] voice and said blessed art thou are
[54:57] among women and blessed is the fruit of
[54:59] thy womb and whence is this that the
[55:02] mother of my lord should come to me for
[55:05] lo as soon as the voice of thy
[55:06] salutation sounded in my ears the babe
[55:09] leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is
[55:12] she that believed
[55:18] blessed is she that believed
[55:23] for
[55:26] these
[55:27] these
[55:28] for for there shall be a performance of
[55:30] those things which were told her
[55:33] from the lord
[55:36] what did god need
[55:37] he needed her surrender her submission
[55:40] by faith
[55:44] he needed her surrender
[55:46] by faith because elizabeth says blessed
[55:50] is she believed for there will be a
[55:52] performance
[55:54] why would there be a performance because
[55:56] she surrendered because she believed
[56:00] see this cuts legalism completely out of
[56:02] the picture
[56:04] see
[56:06] god needs a surrender from you and i
[56:10] he needs us to forget our own thinking
[56:13] and just take what he gave us on the
[56:14] word just take the word as he gave it to
[56:16] us through this prophet
[56:19] he doesn't need us to figure it out he
[56:20] doesn't need us to inject our own
[56:22] thinking he just needs us to surrender
[56:24] to this word
[56:27] but not a surrender
[56:29] out of fear
[56:32] because that'll never produce what it
[56:33] produced in mary
[56:36] not a surrender because of church rules
[56:38] that'll never produce what it produced
[56:40] in mary
[56:42] but mary surrendered because she
[56:44] believed
[56:46] she believed what the angel told her she
[56:49] wasn't afraid
[56:51] she wasn't coerced she wasn't
[56:54] manipulated
[56:56] she just heard the word
[56:58] and she believed the word
[57:00] and she said be it unto me according to
[57:02] your word amen i believe and elizabeth
[57:05] confirm amen blessed is she that
[57:07] believed for there shall be amen a
[57:09] performance of those things that were
[57:11] told unto her she god could now work in
[57:14] her because she was surrendering not
[57:16] because somebody told her to not because
[57:18] she was afraid of what the church would
[57:20] think not because there was a rule or a
[57:22] system or god was beyond all of that he
[57:25] passed bypass the whole system it came
[57:27] to her and what is he looking for he's
[57:29] looking for somebody who could believe
[57:31] what he said and somebody that would
[57:33] yield themselves to him
[57:37] and that's still what he's looking for
[57:41] you know he told
[57:43] samuel told saul
[57:45] is god more delighted in burnt sacrifice
[57:48] or in obedience
[57:52] in obedience
[57:53] he desires more than sacrifice
[57:57] but what kind of obedience does he
[57:59] desire
[58:02] you understand god is not looking for
[58:04] another system
[58:09] he's not looking for another code of
[58:11] conducts or code of rules that now i'm
[58:14] doing this to be accepted by the lord
[58:16] and i'm going to do all of these things
[58:17] and now everything's going to work out
[58:18] fine that's not what god's looking for
[58:21] god is looking for somebody who'll say i
[58:23] believe exactly what you said that's
[58:25] nothing but the lord and let that be
[58:27] unto me according to what you said
[58:30] why because i believe and i'm going to
[58:32] surrender myself and yield myself to
[58:35] this message amen not because i think
[58:38] that if i keep everything every jot
[58:41] every iota every tittle then all of a
[58:44] sudden i'll be accepted i was accepted
[58:46] from the very beginning mary was
[58:48] accepted from the very beginning she
[58:51] yielded because she was accepted she
[58:53] yielded because she believed
[58:57] and so when we begin to talk about
[58:59] surrendering to the message believing
[59:02] the prophet that god sent us and obeying
[59:04] the word that was given to us it is
[59:06] never the concept
[59:09] of old testament
[59:11] old system
[59:13] just do what you're told
[59:16] if you just do everything if you just do
[59:18] everything the way that prophet said do
[59:20] it you'll be accepted
[59:23] that's not the idea friends
[59:26] that's not it at all
[59:28] because then
[59:29] you begin to surrender
[59:32] to a system
[59:35] you begin to surrender to a coat of
[59:37] rules
[59:39] and you begin to surrender because of
[59:41] fear or because of manipulation or for
[59:44] reward
[59:47] but really the surrender comes from love
[59:51] because jesus said if you love me
[59:54] keep my commandments he didn't say make
[59:57] sure you keep my commandments he wasn't
[59:59] looking for commandment keepers he was
[1:00:01] looking for people who loved him that
[1:00:03] would keep his commandments
[1:00:06] amen
[1:00:07] so i
[1:00:09] me personally this is me i am a staunch
[1:00:11] believer in doing what the prophet said
[1:00:14] i mean i believe it
[1:00:16] i believe that's the voice that god
[1:00:18] spoke through in this day it's the voice
[1:00:20] of god to us and if he said it i believe
[1:00:22] it i want to line to it as much as i
[1:00:24] possibly can i accept it as truth
[1:00:27] but i am not in any way here to promote
[1:00:30] or propagate a system and say if you do
[1:00:32] xyz then you'll be accepted by god you
[1:00:35] can do all of it and still not be
[1:00:36] accepted because you didn't do it out of
[1:00:38] love there was no revelation no faith
[1:00:40] you were surrendering to somebody
[1:00:42] telling you jump okay you jump walk here
[1:00:45] you walked here come to church every
[1:00:47] time the door is open you can do all of
[1:00:49] it and not be a child of god
[1:00:52] it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
[1:00:54] guarantee anything amen brother branham
[1:00:57] said amen faith
[1:01:00] faith is what wins the day what is the
[1:01:02] victory that overcomes the world even
[1:01:04] our faith amen
[1:01:07] but he said
[1:01:08] works is my love
[1:01:11] to god
[1:01:16] it's a revelation
[1:01:20] i'll say it this way why do
[1:01:22] i believe me personally
[1:01:24] why am do i believe so much
[1:01:27] in heeding what the prophet taught
[1:01:30] because of my revelation of what god has
[1:01:33] done in this day
[1:01:35] of what the message is and what he
[1:01:36] brought and what he taught and why
[1:01:39] and because i believe that i believe
[1:01:42] this message is christ
[1:01:46] and so for me
[1:01:48] it's it's it's an act of love like i
[1:01:51] want to do
[1:01:52] what christ wants me to do
[1:01:56] like i'm so thankful i don't have to
[1:01:58] figure it out
[1:02:00] i'm so thankful as a father when a
[1:02:02] question comes up in my house that i
[1:02:04] don't have to sit and ponder and
[1:02:06] meditate and go search the internet and
[1:02:08] find out how do how do most christians
[1:02:11] handle this situation and how do people
[1:02:13] believe but i can say let's see what the
[1:02:16] prophet said about this
[1:02:18] my question comes up in doctrine a
[1:02:20] question comes up in conduct a question
[1:02:22] comes up in our family i don't have to
[1:02:24] say well i think and i think and i feel
[1:02:27] i can say children i'll get back to you
[1:02:29] let me find out what the prophet said
[1:02:31] about this and we're going to do what
[1:02:32] the prophet said
[1:02:36] not because i'm afraid that if i don't
[1:02:38] do what the prophet said god's going to
[1:02:40] strike me with lightning is because i
[1:02:42] know that what god sent me in this day
[1:02:44] was for me amen it was god's word he was
[1:02:47] sharing his mind
[1:02:48] he brought what god desired out of his
[1:02:51] church was brought through that vessel
[1:02:53] and if that's what god wants that's what
[1:02:55] i want
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:04] praise be to god
[1:03:06] if you love me
[1:03:08] keep my commandments
[1:03:13] not
[1:03:14] if you weren't accepted by me
[1:03:16] keep my commandments
[1:03:19] but if you love me
[1:03:20] keep my commandments
[1:03:24] and i say praise god
[1:03:26] i love him
[1:03:31] i want to
[1:03:32] keep reading just a little bit more i
[1:03:34] want to read some some of what mary said
[1:03:36] back
[1:03:38] so first elizabeth filled with the holy
[1:03:40] ghost begins to prophesy
[1:03:42] and then mary begins to prophesy
[1:03:45] and i just want to look at what mary
[1:03:48] says
[1:03:49] here in verse 46
[1:03:52] and mary said my soul doth magnify the
[1:03:55] lord
[1:03:58] for my spirit hath rejoiced in god my
[1:04:00] savior
[1:04:02] for he hath regarded the lowest state of
[1:04:04] his handmaid for he
[1:04:06] for behold from henceforth all
[1:04:08] generations shall call me blessed
[1:04:11] for he that is mighty have done to me
[1:04:12] great things and holy is his name and
[1:04:15] his mercy is on them that fear him from
[1:04:17] generation to generation he has showed
[1:04:20] strength with his arm he has scattered
[1:04:22] the brown and the imagination of their
[1:04:24] hearts he has put down the mighty from
[1:04:26] their seats and exalted them of low
[1:04:28] degree he has filled the hungry with
[1:04:30] good things in the rich he hath sent
[1:04:32] away empty ascent empty away
[1:04:36] he hath hope and his servant israel in
[1:04:38] remembrance of his mercy as he spake to
[1:04:40] our fathers to abraham and to a seed
[1:04:42] forever
[1:04:44] mary begins to speak and when she begins
[1:04:46] to speak amen she begins to speak as
[1:04:50] somebody who is free she says now my
[1:04:53] soul doth magnify the lord because
[1:04:57] she she mary never takes this attitude
[1:05:00] that god chose me because i'm special
[1:05:06] and she never takes this attitude of
[1:05:08] elizabeth i mean you should have known
[1:05:12] why are you so surprised
[1:05:14] that i'm the one no she says my soul
[1:05:17] doesn't magnify the lord amen and she
[1:05:20] begins to cry out and worship god
[1:05:22] my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior
[1:05:25] for he hath regarded the low estate amen
[1:05:28] she she knew she was nothing she knew
[1:05:30] she was incapable she knew there was
[1:05:32] nothing that she could do and god looked
[1:05:35] down on her and god took her and brought
[1:05:38] her in this position to fulfill the word
[1:05:40] she didn't do anything and she's not
[1:05:42] claiming to have done anything
[1:05:45] i think it's important as she begins to
[1:05:47] magnify the lord the only thing she can
[1:05:49] do is magnify the lord she can take
[1:05:52] absolutely no pride and whatsoever in
[1:05:55] being chosen amen she can take no pride
[1:05:57] amen in having uh yielded to god and
[1:06:00] received amen the visitation of the holy
[1:06:03] ghost and this impregnation she didn't
[1:06:05] do anything all she did was yielded to
[1:06:07] god and god did everything
[1:06:11] and so in her
[1:06:13] in her magnifying the lord and rejoicing
[1:06:16] she begins to explain how god looked
[1:06:18] down on her who was low how god
[1:06:20] remembered and how god brought up it
[1:06:22] wasn't any anything whatsoever she did
[1:06:26] or any merit of her own
[1:06:29] she begins to cry out what god had done
[1:06:31] for her
[1:06:36] and spoken word again
[1:06:38] the brotherhood said adam found his wife
[1:06:40] pregnant with the seed of death
[1:06:42] of satan's lie
[1:06:43] she had accepted
[1:06:46] see
[1:06:49] the power
[1:06:50] comes in surrender
[1:06:53] before death could set in
[1:06:56] eve had to surrender to the lie of the
[1:06:59] serpent
[1:07:01] and she had to yield herself to the
[1:07:03] serpent
[1:07:05] and when she yielded to the wrong thing
[1:07:08] it brought death
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:13] she accepted satan's line
[1:07:17] he said now joseph found his wife
[1:07:18] pregnated with the seed of god
[1:07:21] which the word
[1:07:22] the word she had accepted
[1:07:25] what was she pregnanted by the word that
[1:07:28] she had accepted
[1:07:30] be it unto me
[1:07:31] according to thy word
[1:07:35] in the message choosing of a bride
[1:07:38] prophet says the other is pregnanted by
[1:07:40] the word of god and will bring forth the
[1:07:42] body the finished body of jesus christ
[1:07:45] which is the bride the body of christ
[1:07:47] isn't finished yet how many knows that a
[1:07:50] man and a woman is one and christ is one
[1:07:52] body the word the bride will have to be
[1:07:54] the rest of that body and the two
[1:07:56] together makes the one body again like
[1:07:58] adam was at the beginning ma'am his wife
[1:08:00] are one now she the true bride so sold
[1:08:04] out to him
[1:08:05] that she uses that she used no mind of
[1:08:08] her own his mind of course is his will
[1:08:11] and his will is his word
[1:08:13] so what's what what's the requirement
[1:08:16] here she is so sold out to him she uses
[1:08:19] no mind of her own
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:22] his mind of course is his will
[1:08:24] and his will is his word so she's lining
[1:08:28] she's surrendering to the word
[1:08:31] and the message serves we would see
[1:08:33] jesus he said the true servant always
[1:08:35] takes you to the word
[1:08:37] now he is the word he is the bible made
[1:08:39] living and when you die to yourself with
[1:08:41] christ like a corn of wheat then the
[1:08:44] word lives in you
[1:08:46] brings forth the same results as it did
[1:08:48] in the living corn of wheat that had to
[1:08:50] drop into the earth so it's it's as you
[1:08:53] die to yourself
[1:08:55] with christ
[1:08:57] then christ comes alive in you
[1:09:01] let's turn to the book of ruth i want to
[1:09:03] look at ruth i mentioned it right at the
[1:09:05] end of sunday's service
[1:09:07] but i want to go back and
[1:09:10] look
[1:09:12] at this again
[1:09:15] we'll just walk through ruth just a
[1:09:17] little bit and pick up a few verses ruth
[1:09:19] chapter 1 verse 15.
[1:09:29] ruth chapter 1 verse 15 and she said
[1:09:31] behold thy sister-in-law has gone back
[1:09:33] into her people and unto her god's
[1:09:35] return now after thy sister-in-law
[1:09:37] and ruth said and treat me not to leave
[1:09:39] thee or to return from following after
[1:09:41] thee for whither thou goest i will go
[1:09:44] whether thou largest i will lodge thy
[1:09:46] people shall be my people and thy god
[1:09:48] my god
[1:09:50] brother when he gets to this he says
[1:09:51] this chapter 1 is ruth deciding
[1:09:55] and he takes us on a journey
[1:09:57] through the church ages and ruth he said
[1:09:59] this is ruth deciding this is her
[1:10:01] justification she's deciding to leave
[1:10:03] moab she's deciding to go back into
[1:10:05] israel with naomi and and live like
[1:10:08] naomi lives and live where naomi lives
[1:10:10] and her people be her people and naomi's
[1:10:12] god would be her god so this is ruth
[1:10:15] making her decision
[1:10:17] let's go to chapter two
[1:10:19] brother madam said chapter two
[1:10:21] is ruth serving or ruth working
[1:10:24] ruth chapter two verse two and ruth the
[1:10:26] moabite has said unto naomi let me now
[1:10:28] go to the field and glean ears of corn
[1:10:32] after him and whose sight i shall find
[1:10:34] grace and she said unto her go my
[1:10:36] daughter
[1:10:37] and she went and came
[1:10:40] and gleaned in the field after the
[1:10:41] reapers and her hap was to light on the
[1:10:43] part of the field belonging unto boaz
[1:10:45] who was of the kindred of elimelech
[1:10:49] let's go to verse 17.
[1:10:52] so she gleaned in the field until even
[1:10:54] and beat out that she had gleaned and it
[1:10:57] was about an ifa of barley
[1:11:00] and that ifa is about a bushel so she
[1:11:03] did a good job that was a good good
[1:11:05] day's labor she had gathered a lot
[1:11:08] and we know boaz took special interest
[1:11:10] in here and told the reapers not to
[1:11:11] chase her away and also to drop handfuls
[1:11:14] of purpose for her to pick up so he's
[1:11:16] trying to make it easy for her and she
[1:11:18] gathered quite a bit of grain she was
[1:11:20] out reaping behind she was gleaning
[1:11:22] behind the reapers gathering what was
[1:11:24] left over and she herself had to beat it
[1:11:26] out amen we talked about threshing amen
[1:11:29] and the threshing instruments and the
[1:11:30] threshing floor on sunday but she
[1:11:32] herself had to beat it out to separate
[1:11:35] the the barley from the shuck and she
[1:11:38] beat it out gathered it and brought it
[1:11:40] back to naomi and showed naomi how much
[1:11:42] she had gathered and she had about a
[1:11:44] bushel full so we have ruth deciding her
[1:11:46] justification now we have ruth in her
[1:11:49] legalism brother branham says and
[1:11:51] sanctification working working out her
[1:11:54] salvation
[1:11:57] this is the way brother brahm describes
[1:11:59] it
[1:12:01] but let's go to chapter three
[1:12:03] because we're going to come to ruth
[1:12:05] resting
[1:12:07] chapter 3 verse 1
[1:12:10] then naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[1:12:12] her my daughter shall i not seek rest
[1:12:14] for thee that it may be well with thee
[1:12:17] and that was not boaz of our kindred
[1:12:19] with whose maidens thou wast behold he
[1:12:21] went with barley tonight in the
[1:12:23] threshing floor
[1:12:24] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[1:12:27] and put thy raiment upon thee and get
[1:12:29] thee down to the floor but make not
[1:12:30] thyself known unto the man until he
[1:12:33] shall have done eating and drinking and
[1:12:36] that shall be when he lieth down that
[1:12:37] thou shall mark the place where he shall
[1:12:39] lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[1:12:41] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[1:12:43] thee what thou shall do and he said unto
[1:12:45] her all that thou sayeth unto me i will
[1:12:48] do
[1:12:49] and she went down into the floor
[1:12:51] and did according to all that her
[1:12:52] mother-in-law
[1:12:54] obeyed her
[1:12:55] and when boaz had eaten and drunk and
[1:12:57] his heart was merry he went to lie down
[1:12:59] at the end of the heap of corn and she
[1:13:01] came softly and uncovered his feet and
[1:13:03] laid her down
[1:13:04] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[1:13:06] man was afraid and turned himself and
[1:13:08] behold a woman lay at his feet
[1:13:11] and he said who art thou and she
[1:13:13] answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread
[1:13:15] therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid
[1:13:17] for thou art a near kinsmen
[1:13:20] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[1:13:22] my daughter for thou has showed more
[1:13:24] kindness in thy lateran than at thy
[1:13:27] beginning and as much as thou followest
[1:13:29] not young men whether poor or rich and
[1:13:32] now my daughter fear not i will do to
[1:13:34] thee all that thou require us for all
[1:13:36] the city of my people doth know that
[1:13:38] thou art a virtuous woman
[1:13:41] when ruth
[1:13:43] obeys naomi she says i will do all that
[1:13:46] they say all that you say
[1:13:49] and she goes into the threshing floor
[1:13:52] and
[1:13:53] and the symbology is terrific she goes
[1:13:55] into the place where the
[1:13:57] the separation takes place
[1:14:00] and she goes according to what naomi had
[1:14:03] told her and she's in obedience and she
[1:14:04] surrendered and she comes to where boaz
[1:14:07] lays himself down by the heap of corn
[1:14:09] and the threshing floor uncovers her
[1:14:11] feet and she lays herself down when she
[1:14:14] lays herself down at his feet
[1:14:16] she is giving herself away
[1:14:19] she is she is going to ask this man to
[1:14:22] take her as a wife and she is completely
[1:14:25] yielding her life she is giving herself
[1:14:28] away
[1:14:29] she is dying to herself on the threshing
[1:14:32] floor
[1:14:33] she uncovers his feet and lays down at
[1:14:35] his feet
[1:14:36] this is a place of servanthood the
[1:14:38] servants are at the feet
[1:14:40] and when he wakes up at midnight he's
[1:14:43] afraid and he asked and and and she says
[1:14:46] cover me with your skirt and that's
[1:14:48] symbolic for if you cover me with your
[1:14:50] skirt she's asking him to marry her
[1:14:54] for redemption and he recognizes it's
[1:14:57] not for self-gain it's not for lust it's
[1:15:01] not but it's for redemption
[1:15:03] that her motive is pure
[1:15:05] and he said
[1:15:07] blessed be thou verse 10
[1:15:09] of the lord my daughter for thou has
[1:15:11] shown more kindness in thy ladder in
[1:15:13] than at the beginning and so much as
[1:15:15] thou followest not young men whether
[1:15:17] poor
[1:15:18] or rich
[1:15:20] and he says i know that thou the whole
[1:15:22] village knows that you're a virtuous
[1:15:23] woman
[1:15:24] i will do what you ask
[1:15:26] then in verse 14
[1:15:28] it says and she lay at his feet until
[1:15:30] the morning
[1:15:31] and she rose up before one could know
[1:15:33] another and he said let it not be known
[1:15:36] that a woman came into the floor
[1:15:40] and
[1:15:41] also he said bring thy veil that thou
[1:15:43] hast upon thee and hold it when she held
[1:15:46] it he measured six measures of barley
[1:15:48] and laid it on her and she went into the
[1:15:50] city and when she had come to her
[1:15:53] mother-in-law she said who art thou my
[1:15:55] daughter she told her all that the man
[1:15:57] had done to her and she said these six
[1:16:00] measures of barley gave you me for he
[1:16:02] said to me go not empty unto thy
[1:16:04] mother-in-law
[1:16:05] then said she sit still my daughter
[1:16:08] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:16:10] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:16:12] has finished the thing this day
[1:16:18] in the beginning of the story we have
[1:16:20] ruth who has to make a decision
[1:16:23] it's up to ruth
[1:16:24] she decides
[1:16:26] and when ruth decides this is her
[1:16:28] justification she begins to walk
[1:16:31] in the ways of israel in the ways of
[1:16:32] gone and as she comes into israel then
[1:16:35] she begins to work this is her serving
[1:16:37] the lord this is her laboring this is
[1:16:39] her phase of legalism and she begins to
[1:16:42] gather behind the reapers she begins to
[1:16:44] glean and she begins to beat it out
[1:16:46] herself amen she's now working for the
[1:16:49] word she's now she's now laboring she's
[1:16:51] now uh doing what she can to gather this
[1:16:55] food amen that they need to live off of
[1:16:57] amen and it's it's very much amen like
[1:17:01] we come out of our denomination we make
[1:17:03] our decision to move into the land but
[1:17:05] we come into the land and we start
[1:17:06] laboring in the word amen to understand
[1:17:09] serpent seed and to understand this and
[1:17:11] we find these nuggets we get excited
[1:17:12] about the word and begin we begin i
[1:17:14] don't know how many of you started doing
[1:17:16] bible studies
[1:17:17] first thing i did was bible studies
[1:17:19] piecing the word together and all of
[1:17:20] this but then all of a sudden you
[1:17:22] realize that all my effort is going to
[1:17:25] come up with nothing amen when the
[1:17:27] cleaning's over what she's going to do
[1:17:28] she's just picking up these bits but
[1:17:31] naomi tells her go surrender yourself to
[1:17:34] the lord of the harvest go lay at his
[1:17:36] feet and as soon as she laid at his feet
[1:17:38] she gave her life completely to him this
[1:17:41] was not an act of works this was not
[1:17:44] anything that she could do she was
[1:17:45] laying her life down at his feet saying
[1:17:48] i'm giving myself to you will you take
[1:17:50] me and he says i will take you and after
[1:17:53] he did amen in the morning she rose up
[1:17:55] and he dished out to her six measures of
[1:17:59] barley that she didn't gather herself
[1:18:01] that she didn't beat out that she didn't
[1:18:03] labor for amen she didn't have to do
[1:18:06] nothing to get these six measures of
[1:18:08] barley all she had to do was surrender
[1:18:10] to the lord of the harvest
[1:18:16] and we know he goes
[1:18:18] and he works the work of redemption
[1:18:21] he goes into the gate
[1:18:24] and now naomi says rest
[1:18:27] there's nothing more for you to do
[1:18:31] there's nothing he's going to do it all
[1:18:34] you've given yourself to him he's taken
[1:18:36] you amen he's given you amen what you
[1:18:39] had to work for he's given it to you
[1:18:41] amen my revelation he has poured it on
[1:18:44] to you amen and it's it's it's a free
[1:18:46] gift you don't work anymore he gave it
[1:18:49] to you she carried it back to show that
[1:18:52] she that she had a token of meeting boaz
[1:18:56] and naomi says rest
[1:18:59] your work is done
[1:19:01] his work it's his work now
[1:19:04] and listen when you've come to rest
[1:19:07] it's not you working it's now the lord
[1:19:10] of the harvest working it's not your
[1:19:11] work now it wasn't it wasn't any longer
[1:19:15] ruth's work she received the portion the
[1:19:17] six portions of barley she didn't work
[1:19:20] for she didn't earn she didn't labor for
[1:19:22] but she gave herself in submission to
[1:19:24] the lord of the harvest he gave it to
[1:19:26] her she carried it back she doesn't have
[1:19:28] to do anything else all the
[1:19:30] responsibility now is shifted on boaz
[1:19:32] now boaz is going to do it all
[1:19:37] hebrews 4 9 says there remaineth
[1:19:39] therefore a rest to the people of god
[1:19:42] for he that is entered into his rest
[1:19:45] he also has ceased from his own works as
[1:19:48] god did from his when we've entered into
[1:19:50] the rest with christ we cease from our
[1:19:52] own works it's not about what we can do
[1:19:55] to earn something it's about giving
[1:19:57] ourselves to him and he takes over from
[1:20:00] there
[1:20:03] in the message the masterpiece the
[1:20:05] prophet of god says notice
[1:20:07] hear the life that was in the husk
[1:20:09] in the stalk and the tassel in the house
[1:20:11] all gathers into the seed
[1:20:14] and the life that was in the stalk
[1:20:16] one went to make the other justification
[1:20:18] made a way for sanctification
[1:20:20] sanctification made a way for the
[1:20:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:23] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:20:25] for the holy ghost itself to come right
[1:20:28] down in perfection back to the word
[1:20:30] again to manifest itself
[1:20:34] ruth
[1:20:35] had given herself away
[1:20:37] and she didn't have to work anymore
[1:20:41] boaz
[1:20:42] goes and
[1:20:44] pays the price of redemption and he
[1:20:45] takes ruth into himself
[1:20:48] let's look at chapter 4
[1:20:50] verse 13.
[1:20:55] verse 13.
[1:20:56] so boaz took ruth
[1:20:58] and she was his wife
[1:21:00] and when he went into her the lord gave
[1:21:03] her conception
[1:21:04] and she bear a son
[1:21:08] the lord gave her conception
[1:21:10] and she bear a son
[1:21:13] listen she went through justification
[1:21:16] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:21:19] ghost
[1:21:20] but now
[1:21:21] it's he himself
[1:21:24] she's receiving life from boaz
[1:21:27] she's receiving a part of boaz she's
[1:21:29] receiving the seed from boaz and now
[1:21:32] she's impregnated by boaz this is the
[1:21:35] fourth stage amen this is where now she
[1:21:38] can't work for this she can't earn this
[1:21:40] all she can do is receive this
[1:21:44] what did she do to them for what did she
[1:21:46] do for this position she yielded herself
[1:21:49] she gave herself away and she yielded
[1:21:51] and she further yielded the boaz because
[1:21:53] she doesn't have her own seed she
[1:21:56] doesn't have any way to get the seed the
[1:21:58] only way to get it is from boaz and the
[1:22:00] only way to get it from boaz is to
[1:22:01] surrender to boaz it's up to boaz now
[1:22:05] and the only way to be impregnated by
[1:22:07] the word is to lay ourselves down at the
[1:22:09] feet of the lord of the harvest and say
[1:22:11] christ i'm laying myself down at your
[1:22:13] feet i'm tired of working there's
[1:22:15] nothing else i can do but will you cover
[1:22:17] me with your skirt amen amen
[1:22:21] ruth was excited when she went to naomi
[1:22:24] after she had gathered barley she
[1:22:26] gleaned she had beat it out she had
[1:22:27] worked she had something and then some
[1:22:29] little substance amen and she was happy
[1:22:31] about that but naomi knew that this is
[1:22:34] going to come to an end this isn't going
[1:22:35] to work you've got to go further than
[1:22:37] this amen you've got to go to the lord
[1:22:39] of the harvest who owns it all who will
[1:22:41] give you freely and willingly and then
[1:22:43] when you have need that you never run
[1:22:45] out
[1:22:48] she was excited about what she did but
[1:22:52] what she did would come to an end
[1:22:56] now naomi knew
[1:22:57] you've got to go another step child
[1:23:00] you've got to lay yourself down at his
[1:23:02] feet and give yourself away
[1:23:05] when you give yourself away now boaz
[1:23:07] will supply the word now boaz will give
[1:23:10] you a seed and now you'll be pregnanted
[1:23:13] with boaz's seed
[1:23:17] now it's up to
[1:23:18] boaz not ruth
[1:23:26] let's look at
[1:23:28] verse 18.
[1:23:35] now these are the generations of pharas
[1:23:38] fair as was begotten by tamar
[1:23:41] do you remember tamar
[1:23:43] she was a gentile
[1:23:44] who played the part of a harlot
[1:23:47] and receive seed from judah
[1:23:49] to propagate the line of judah
[1:23:51] now these are the generations of
[1:23:52] pharaohs pharas begat hezron
[1:23:55] hezron begot ram
[1:23:56] ram begat of bina dab a been a dead
[1:23:59] begotten nation nation begot salman
[1:24:02] solomon begotten boaz
[1:24:04] does anybody remember who salman's wife
[1:24:06] was
[1:24:07] rahab the harlot
[1:24:09] another gentile
[1:24:12] we got boaz and boaz we got obed who was
[1:24:15] obed's mother
[1:24:16] ruth the moabitess
[1:24:19] there's a whole line of gentiles
[1:24:22] and obed begot jesse
[1:24:25] and jesse begot david
[1:24:27] and jesus christ came as the son of
[1:24:29] david
[1:24:31] to take the throne
[1:24:34] this lineage is so important
[1:24:37] it's so critical
[1:24:40] but this lineage was locked in boaz
[1:24:43] because boaz didn't have anyone as an
[1:24:47] heir to his estate
[1:24:49] if boaz had had another wife and another
[1:24:52] firstborn that firstborn would be listed
[1:24:54] here
[1:24:56] the prof the promise
[1:24:58] of christ coming was locked in boaz
[1:25:02] the the naomi's inheritance of bemalex
[1:25:05] inheritance was locked up the
[1:25:07] inheritance the land was locked amen the
[1:25:10] lineage was locked how are we going to
[1:25:12] unlock the the how are we going to
[1:25:15] unlock the inheritance and how are we
[1:25:16] going to unlock the lineage
[1:25:20] the key is a woman
[1:25:23] this woman and how is she going to do it
[1:25:25] with what power with what strength with
[1:25:28] what works with what ability how is she
[1:25:30] going to unlock the inheritance and
[1:25:32] unlock the lineage of christ amen
[1:25:35] there's only one thing she can do and
[1:25:37] that is give herself away and surrender
[1:25:39] and lay down at the feet of boaz and
[1:25:41] when she submitted herself to boaz and
[1:25:44] boaz took her to himself he finished the
[1:25:47] work in an unlocked redemption and it
[1:25:50] unlocked the lineage of christ
[1:25:56] the prophecy the power of the prophecy
[1:25:58] was unlocked by what
[1:26:00] submission
[1:26:03] not some mighty work the woman did not
[1:26:06] some big powerful thing not some great
[1:26:09] but simple
[1:26:11] submission
[1:26:13] and in submission
[1:26:15] there's a redemption
[1:26:17] and in submission the lineage of christ
[1:26:20] moves on through boaz
[1:26:24] praise be to god
[1:26:27] let's look at romans 16.
[1:26:32] and we'll wrap up with this scripture
[1:26:35] romans chapter 16
[1:26:44] in verse 20 romans 16 and 20.
[1:26:50] romans chapter 16 verse 20 and the god
[1:26:53] of peace
[1:26:54] shall prove satan under your feet
[1:26:56] shortly
[1:26:57] the grace of our lord jesus christ be
[1:26:59] with you
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:02] the god of peace
[1:27:04] shall bruise satan
[1:27:07] i've asked this question before but who
[1:27:10] is bruising whom
[1:27:13] god is bruising satan
[1:27:17] who's the bruiser
[1:27:19] god
[1:27:20] who's being bruised satan
[1:27:23] where where do i come into play
[1:27:26] he's just using you
[1:27:29] the god of priests shall bruise satan
[1:27:31] under your feet shortly
[1:27:34] but what do you have to do to it never
[1:27:37] says you brew satan
[1:27:40] is that what the scripture says no it's
[1:27:42] not about your strength your power your
[1:27:44] boldness your aggressiveness it's not
[1:27:46] about what you think or what you feel or
[1:27:48] how much you know it's not you bruising
[1:27:51] satan it's god bruising satan but how is
[1:27:55] god going to brew satan under the feet
[1:27:57] of his bride what does he need you to do
[1:28:00] nothing he just needs you to surrender
[1:28:03] he's the one who's going to do it amen
[1:28:06] this prophecy is laying in the bible
[1:28:08] amen it needs somebody who will unlock
[1:28:11] the prophecy the prophecy through
[1:28:13] submission not through trying to be the
[1:28:15] bruiser is i'm not the bruiser
[1:28:18] god is
[1:28:20] i'm not the strong man he is i'm not the
[1:28:22] wise one he is i'm not the one with
[1:28:25] power he has the power i'm not the one
[1:28:27] with the plan he's got the plan it's not
[1:28:30] me it's him he's going to use me but
[1:28:32] it's not me it's him
[1:28:35] he's going to bruce satan under your
[1:28:36] feet but it's got to be him doing the
[1:28:38] bruising he doesn't need your mind he
[1:28:41] does he doesn't need your intellect or
[1:28:43] your ability he doesn't need a whatever
[1:28:47] all he needs is another surrendered
[1:28:49] vessel in the end time
[1:28:52] who will take no mind of her own
[1:28:56] but will stand on thus saith the lord
[1:28:59] who will not add to the word who will
[1:29:01] not take away from the word but will
[1:29:03] take the word the way it's been given to
[1:29:05] us in this day and stay with the word
[1:29:07] and let god do the work that he's
[1:29:09] promised to do in this in this day
[1:29:13] what's locking the prophecy
[1:29:15] surrender what will unlock it
[1:29:18] all he needs
[1:29:20] is a bride
[1:29:21] who is submissive to him
[1:29:25] every other bride failed in submission
[1:29:28] so now submission
[1:29:30] this in submission doesn't become
[1:29:33] a word of weakness
[1:29:36] submission becomes a word that that
[1:29:39] moves the program of god along becomes a
[1:29:42] power there's a power in submission
[1:29:45] and the power is not in the one who's
[1:29:48] submissive they have no power of their
[1:29:50] own but the power and submission
[1:29:52] is allowing god to take the vessel he's
[1:29:55] ordained and the time he has chosen and
[1:29:57] to do the work that he's planned to do
[1:29:59] he did it in moses he did it in david he
[1:30:02] did it in jesus christ he did it in
[1:30:03] brother branham and now he wants to do
[1:30:05] it in you
[1:30:07] what does he need he needs somebody who
[1:30:10] will say
[1:30:11] no i i don't know i have no power no
[1:30:14] ability but whatever you said be it unto
[1:30:17] me that way
[1:30:18] i yield to you and i believe
[1:30:20] what you said
[1:30:23] amen the prophet of god says
[1:30:27] and why are people so tossed about
[1:30:30] yet men and women live a good life and
[1:30:32] love god by a mental conception
[1:30:35] but the real hiding place is in the
[1:30:36] heart hid with christ and when christ
[1:30:38] the holy spirit comes into your heart he
[1:30:40] is in you with your temperament and he's
[1:30:42] living his own life through his own will
[1:30:44] through you hallelujah
[1:30:47] and i know it sounds awful but it's
[1:30:48] right so yielded you are that christ
[1:30:51] speaks the kind the word he speak he
[1:30:53] thinks the kind of thoughts he would
[1:30:55] think through you he does the kind of
[1:30:57] works he would do through you you are
[1:30:59] yielded and resting
[1:31:03] not yielded and working you're now in
[1:31:05] ruth's place yielded and resting and now
[1:31:08] he's coming to you as an individual amen
[1:31:11] to plant his seed within you and now
[1:31:13] you're carrying the word you've been
[1:31:14] impregnated by the word of god amen
[1:31:17] you're just like ruth there was no power
[1:31:19] you had to impregnate yourself you
[1:31:21] couldn't go and grab seed from a man all
[1:31:23] you could do is come to the lord of the
[1:31:24] harvest and say i'm yours will you take
[1:31:27] me and when he takes you now you yield
[1:31:29] yourself to him and he's the one who
[1:31:31] comes into you
[1:31:34] amen
[1:31:36] in the pergamian church age he says
[1:31:38] those in the bride do only his will
[1:31:41] no one can make them do otherwise
[1:31:43] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:31:45] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:31:47] god in them doing the works
[1:31:50] who's bruising satan
[1:31:53] it has to be god in them doing the works
[1:31:58] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:32:00] complete all his work while in his
[1:32:02] earthly ministry so now he works in and
[1:32:05] through the bride
[1:32:09] he works
[1:32:11] in and through the bride
[1:32:13] not the bride works
[1:32:17] she surrenders
[1:32:19] he works
[1:32:21] she yields he overcomes
[1:32:24] she lays down her life he gives her life
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:29] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:32:32] for him to do certain things that he
[1:32:33] must now do
[1:32:35] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:32:37] bride
[1:32:38] that work which he left for this
[1:32:40] specific time
[1:32:43] did brother branham say the bride has a
[1:32:45] work to do
[1:32:47] no
[1:32:49] sorry brother ben
[1:32:52] he has a work to do
[1:32:55] the work that he left
[1:32:57] for this time
[1:32:59] it's not your work
[1:33:00] it's his work
[1:33:02] you didn't leave it he left it you
[1:33:05] didn't designate this time he designated
[1:33:07] this time he will now do
[1:33:10] he will now do
[1:33:12] the work that he left
[1:33:14] for this time
[1:33:16] through the bride
[1:33:19] what can possibly hold this back
[1:33:23] only one thing that i know of
[1:33:25] god won't violate free moral agency
[1:33:28] and god is a gentleman and he won't
[1:33:29] force himself
[1:33:31] the only thing i know that can hold this
[1:33:32] back
[1:33:34] is an unwillingness in the bride to
[1:33:35] fully surrender
[1:33:37] but i thankful that there's another
[1:33:39] promise
[1:33:41] that there'll be a bride at the end time
[1:33:43] who will not fail
[1:33:45] she's predestinated not to fall
[1:33:49] she will not fail because she's
[1:33:51] predestinated not to fail
[1:33:53] somewhere along the line
[1:33:56] there's going to be a bride that's going
[1:33:58] to say
[1:33:59] be it unto me
[1:34:01] according to all of your word
[1:34:03] i throw away all my ideas and i quit
[1:34:06] with all of my silly efforts
[1:34:09] i'm going to give myself to you and if
[1:34:11] anything's going to be accomplished in
[1:34:12] my life it's going to be something you
[1:34:14] do through me not something i do of
[1:34:16] myself
[1:34:19] he's looking for a surrender
[1:34:21] to unlock the power of this end time
[1:34:23] prophecy
[1:34:25] and i want to give a greater surrender
[1:34:26] than i ever have before
[1:34:28] i'm praying that god would just
[1:34:30] just lay me down and let me surrender
[1:34:33] and sacrifice and give up all and just
[1:34:35] surrender to him like i've never
[1:34:36] surrendered before
[1:34:38] because i see through the scriptures
[1:34:40] it's the only way
[1:34:42] for him to accomplish in this hour let's
[1:34:44] all stand together
[1:34:47] musicians if you can make your way up
[1:34:49] brother john if you make your way up
[1:34:52] let's just bow our heads
[1:34:55] how many of you want to lay yourself
[1:34:56] fresh down at the feet of the lord of
[1:34:58] the harvest tonight just all over again
[1:35:00] just go in and lay yourself down lord
[1:35:03] jesus we are laying ourselves down at
[1:35:05] your feet
[1:35:06] and god and we're recognizing through
[1:35:08] your scriptures
[1:35:10] that there's nothing we can do in of
[1:35:12] ourselves
[1:35:13] we are just in as incapable of mary was
[1:35:16] of bringing forth the promised seed
[1:35:19] we are just in as incapable of bringing
[1:35:21] about redemption as as ruth was by
[1:35:24] herself
[1:35:25] lord there's nothing we can do without
[1:35:27] you
[1:35:28] so we recognize lord that all of our
[1:35:31] working and all of our efforts lord and
[1:35:33] all of our trying will come to an end
[1:35:35] somewhere
[1:35:36] so now we want to come to you lord and
[1:35:38] lay ourselves down at your feet
[1:35:41] and surrender
[1:35:42] and say lord jesus cover me with your
[1:35:44] skirt

[1:35:48] away i'm giving myself to you take me

[1:35:59] where the prophecy is laying there
[1:36:01] promising god that you will bruise satan
[1:36:04] under our feet but we can't do a thing
[1:36:07] lord it has to be you doing it through
[1:36:09] us help us to yield help us to surrender

[1:36:32] let us give you your place now
[1:36:35] and father would you come
[1:36:37] and take your place

[1:36:45] reproduce yourself on this earth
[1:36:49] through these willing vessels
[1:36:51] god we just want to lay down our lives
[1:36:54] and believe
[1:36:56] that what your angel said is true
[1:37:00] and it's for us
