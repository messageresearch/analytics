[0:01] this is the real beautiful part by some
[0:03] means he says this if he was a
[0:08] Freeborn true blooded
[0:11] Israelite see that's why I was telling
[0:13] Jubilee is not for everybody it's say it
[0:16] says here he's a free born blooded
[0:21] Israelite that means that puts that
[0:23] means that Jubilee he's going to get it
[0:26] regardless can we say amen I I just love
[0:29] this he says right here he said it he
[0:32] said if he's a was a Freeborn true
[0:34] blooded Israelite no matter who held the
[0:38] possession it had to go back to him free
[0:43] he didn't have to pay anything he didn't
[0:45] have to do anything but stop what he was
[0:48] doing and go back to his
[0:52] inheritance other words he don't sold
[0:54] out his land or whatever he sold out in
[0:57] them Years be going by you know what one
[1:00] day he out there sweating trying to pay
[1:02] off the debt or whatever but then a
[1:04] trumpet sound when he hear that trumpet
[1:07] blow he can just stop anything and you
[1:10] know one thing I like about it it makes
[1:12] no different one thing about a
[1:15] jubilee if he haven't paid the person
[1:18] that he sold out to the full amount of
[1:21] the money if he haven't paid it all it
[1:25] don't matter when the Jubilee come it
[1:28] says it's paid in full
[1:31] praise the Lord what you saying brother
[1:33] burlin I say this that trumpet he
[1:35] Prophet said it's that go gospel trumpet
[1:38] when you hear that gospel trumpet it
[1:40] means that you can be free that tells me
[1:43] I can tell the devil I don't owe you
[1:45] nothing no more I I'm free I can walk
[1:48] out free no more complexes can we say
[1:51] Amen everything that I have done as now
[1:54] I can walk away from it and my
[1:58] freedom you got to hear that gospel
[2:00] trumpet cuz when that when that Jew out
[2:03] there hoing and so forth when that
[2:05] trumpet go you know what other people
[2:08] are hearing it
[2:09] too other people are hearing it but he's
[2:12] the only one responding cuz he knows the
