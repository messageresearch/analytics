preaching for brother Dan Ratliff we want to remember him believe he'll be traveling back this afternoon and also brother Emanuel saasu and brother Burley are still in the Congo preaching and they the last word that he sent uh on our on our chat group he said that they still haven't decided whether they're going to extend their trip or they're still praying about it so just pray that they get the leadership of the Lord so they know what to do there also we have a brother visiting from New York brother tff Dill he's called me on the phone before and he he's here brother tff where are you God bless you brother it's good to see you glad you made the long journey and also I want to welcome my mother sister Debbie she's here visiting again and so we're always glad to have her and any other visitors that are here you're very welcome may God bless you and while we're standing together we have our Bibles let's turn to Luke chapter 8 and we're going to take a look at the word here and trust the Lord to minister his word unto us amen Luke chapter 8 we're going to be begin reading at verse four we're going to read a very familiar portion of scripture and then draw from there Luke 8 verse 4 and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable a swer went out to sew his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold and when he had said these things cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear and God bless you as you have your seats uh for a title this morning I just like to take the title the power in the word the power in the word and uh I've I've been meditating on this for quite a while it's one of those things that we always think about the word of God we're always meditating on and it's always uh striking Us in different ways and and uh it's something for me that's come up in conversation several times over the last month or maybe more when talking to people and and it's begin to I I begin to share some things from my own heart with others that I I thought were very beneficial to me and I just wanted to share that with you again today uh some things that I've just been seeing about the power that is in the word and uh we see here in this Parable Jesus is starting to explain to them about a sewer that goes forth to sew seed and and the seed ends up falling in different PL places and uh uh in the place that it falls it has a different effect but if some fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit H hundredfold and verse 9 it says and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God on those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation fall away and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring bring no fruit to Perfection but that on the good ground are they which in the honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience so I would like to just look at the verse 15 and the the seed that fell in good ground when we look at the The Parables of God uh that Jesus Christ gave and there's so many different examples and analogies and Parables that God used to try to convey his message to try to convey a a truth to a people that are Limited in a human perspective he starts using all kinds of different analogies and here it's a seed s he's got a bag of seed and he's throwing the seed and when the seed falls into good ground the seed reproduces the life that's in the seed and so the the the the parable is he says the seed is the word of God and so but there's another Parable where where Jesus begins to explain that there was a man who sowed good seed in his field and and when he rested at night an enemy came in and and swed corrupt seed sowed weeds into the field and when they sprang up they begin to realize that there was a a mixed a mixed seed in here and the and the servants wanted to go to the lord of the field and ask him should we pluck them up he said no leave them till the Harvest time and we'll bind the tears together for burning and gather the wheed into the Garner and Jesus begins to explain now he begins to explain the seed are the sons of God are the children of God the the children of the son of man and so now we find that sometimes the seed are people and in this Parable the seed is the word but really when we realize what the message has taught us there's not much difference because the seed that's in US is also the word because it's part of God because the word amen the word was with God and the Word was God and so it it it's just too different ways of looking at the same thing to bring an analogy or an example or a way of teaching something for people to comprehend so we we we may be looking at both sides of this equation as the seed being that portion of the word that's you that's in your soul and the seed also being the portion of God that's in the word that's being preached or proclaimed or written in the word but it's the same thing it's different parts of the same person which is God Amen so God is is the culmination of his thoughts God is his thoughts amen but when God would begin to express himself he would Express himself as word that's the projection of thought amen when it begins to be be proclaimed that's word and then the word would go into a a process where by which would come into manifestation and as it come into manifestation it's the manifested word but through it all it's the original thought of God coming down and becoming more tangible to you and I upon this Earth so when he looks at this seed the seed is the word but in the other Parable we didn't take time to read it because we know it so well the other Parable the the the ground then is the world and the seed some were the children of the enemy and some are the children of God in this Parable the seed is the word of God and the good ground are the children of God where the seed Falls Falls the right place for it to fall so that it can reproduce itself 100 fold sir amen so I would say it this way and hopefully you can just hang with me we all know the message well enough we can stick together sometimes you're the dirt and sometimes you're the seed amen so just get comfortable sometimes being the dirt and sometimes being the seed it'll be okay then as we move forward let's back up to Genesis chap 1 now and now with those things laid out we're going to just continue with our thought because the uh the things that I want to say we need to have this understanding uh the one thing that happens to us when we run analogies is sometimes we get confused when we run analogies or we use uh examples or Parables to explain the truth and and there's two things that happen one is we limit to truth to only that analogy so now we can only see ourselves as dirt we can never see ourselves as a seed you understand what I'm saying we can get so hone down says no that's not what the Bible said the Bible said the seed is the word of God and I'm the dirt amen but but another time amen the the analogy said that the dirt is the world and you're the seed so the problem with you these analogies and Parables is if we hone in on it so tight we'll refuse to receive any other truth that uses another type or Shadow the other thing is we run that analogy so far it no longer becomes true we start to add all kinds of stuff to it and we start talking about mineral content of dirt and all kinds of stuff we add to it and Clay mix and that wasn't even the purpose anyways we just grab an analogy we run our own intellect to it and run it so far that thing's not even true anymore so we just got to take it for what it is a way for God to explain to us a truth and grab these truth and let the truth combine themselves out of different analogies and different there's times that that brother Brenham himself will use Noah and the Ark to explain the 144,000 that are carried through the tribulation period there's other times that he uses it to talk about the elect the redeemed bride amen that are carried above in the wedding supper right he using the same scriptures if we get too tight on one we'll refuse the other but they're both true amen and so in in Genesis 1:9 he says and God said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called the dry land Earth and the Gathering Together the waters called he the Seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day now brother bam goes to this scripture when he preaches there's two messages I'm going to quote from quite a bit today and I may not always reference them but you can you can rest assure it's probably from one of these two and they're both in 1965 one is the power of transformation and the other one is God's power to transform he preached them I think just a uh a little over a month apart uh and they basically handling the same subject and he starts off by going all the way back to Genesis and showing that there was seeds that was laying there and we know in the fourth seal he tells us those seeds were from some previous civilization or something they were a creation of God they were a spoken word creation of God because brother Brenham says he created those seeds by his spoken word that's how everything was made by by God's word so the seeds were laying there they were laying there by by uh a at a but something that happened at a previous time to Genesis 13 okay so in Genesis 1:1 we find that God created uh the heavens and the Earth period and the wor was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters so we find out that in Genesis 1:1 speaks that God created the heavens and the Earth brother said period then there's a big gap and we don't know what the Gap is amen but some something happened upon the Earth and now and where where God is going to pick up the story for you and I the story of redemption for you and I in Genesis 1:2 he begins to show us that the the Earth is in in a form of judgment and it's void and darkness and shapeless and there's nothing there but uh but but he begins to reveal amen through the Book of Genesis that brother B picks up that that it was void on the surface it was all darkness and nothing there but down under their Waters there was seeds from another civil ization or something so he begins and then this says that the spirit of God moved upon the waters and then and then God began to speak and as God began to speak the order of his speech begins to move things into place it begins to move the heavenly bodies and part the waters and allow light to strike the Earth and and it begins to arrange this creation or I'd say mold it remold it into a way amen and and then he calls for the the seed to bring forth upon the Earth but the seed is to bring forth after its kind which means that that that seed that was already there can that come up and be something different than the seed that was than the life that was already in it it was already a certain life there but he was calling for it to come and he was calling for the the the the herb yielding seeds uh after its kind and the tree after its kind and the fruit bearing after its kind because it all had to come forth after its kind amen so in the message power of transformation he says now 6,000 years God taken to make this and we see in Genesis 1 yet now we see God had an objective that he wanted to bring to pass and so many people in teaching on Genesis back here in the first chapter in the second chapter third chapter especially it looks like that God repeats himself or he said he went ahead and said all these things that he did uh let there be light and let there be this and let there come forth and there wasn't even one thing yet wasn't nothing there wasn't light the old world was still floating out there and that Darkness covered over with water but see he had spoken his word and then that's when he was speaking so he says that's when he was speaking when was he speaking he was speaking when there was nothing nothing tangible nothing visible nothing happening nothing moving but he spoke his word and when he spoke his word the word went forth and began to put things in motion and began to move and brother bam said he said let there be L he said it might have been 700 years later and he uses other numbers in other places but it could have been many many years a long period of time before the sun actually started to shine upon the earth when we first read it we think he said let the let the sun shine let there be light and immediately bam that that that sunlight was hitting the Earth but he says no amen it started a sequence of events amen where things begin to match the word that God had spoken to bring to pass what he spoke but it could have been hundreds and hundreds of years before it happened and and if we just think like we we all we're all in the same category we're all human beings and being human beings is a travesty because because of of sin and perversion and hybridization and all the other things that that has happened to us and that man has done and we' done to ourselves amen we've got this narrow such this narrow view that we we can only see things in this this tiny a frail perspective and because of that when things happen like this let's just take for instance this this this Revelation that we have that God said let there be light amen so let there be light and now all of a sudden uh uh if you were a human being on the earth at that time he said let there be light and then nothing happens let there be light and you wait a day a week a year two years nothing happens in our narrow Vision with our humanistic perspective we begin to say oh I guess it didn't work this is what brother br's trying to show us when when he says by his stripes you're already healed that's a finished work but he never promised how long it would take for the healing to come he said just believe it until amen because God's not limited by time and he never gave a promise of time he never told you was instantly but yet he said it amen and if the faith in your heart can reach up and grab it and say it's finished it's finished amen for you but it still might be Darkness for 700 more years upon the Earth but that doesn't change anything because the word was spoken and so that's our that's the human side that we all have to fight against so hard because when it doesn't happen after a year and it doesn't happen after two years and it doesn't happen after 10 years amen we begin to say well maybe I misheard maybe I misunderstood maybe there was something wrong and and and we go through all of this mind battles as a human being amen but then 700 years later when we've just kind of given up on everything and and we didn't realize what was happening and we got discouraged and desponded and started walking in darkness and lost hope and then all of a sudden something changes and light begins to hit the earth and goes ping all of a sudden we say what just happened where did that come from that was a miracle I never saw that coming am God must have just done something and the reality is God didn't just do something he did it 700 years later the effect of it is coming later but when it happens is not when God starts to do something that's the culmination of what he already started by speaking the word right see these are so important for us to become the the the word of God was sent to us in this generation for a reason and it was to make us mature Believers so that we didn't step stop stop falling in this narrow Vision category where we keep getting despondent and discouraged and and upset and and and we we look at things temporal and we look at things in the immediate and we begin to lose heart and lose faith in what God is doing but he begins to tell us these things for a reason so that we can understand how God works in our lives and if we have any length of time on us we can begin to look back and say that's exactly how God works in our lives that's exact ly what happens a word is spoken something happens he triggers a response in my heart and I think that my trial is going to be over when I wake up in the morning and I wake up just as much In the Heat of the battle as I was the day before and I think what happened to me that I miss something what's wrong I must have been mistaken there was no mistake that was absolutely the word of God in your life and you received it by faith now you just need to hold still and let that word take in effect because that word is what will bring the results amen not 5 years later when all of a sudden the circumstances change and and and all a sudden you're like wow what just happened to me God just decided to move God moved in my life and I didn't even pray don't you forget the agonizing prayer from 10 years ago don't you remember taking him at his word 10 15 20 that's what's happening today yeah amen amen see being Limited in in in Earthly Vision being stuck in a carnal mind being Limited in a in 80 to 90 years of time upon this Earth is a travesty to us because it's contrary to the way God works so we must we must spiritually lift higher so when he was speaking this there was nothing there was darkness no no no threat of evidence that there was going to be anything changed but he spoke it and and brother M goes on to say now we notice here in Genesis 1 and he formed man in his own image and his own likeness and the image of God made he he made him male and female he was making man he just spoke the word then we find out after his many days had had passed maybe hundreds and hundreds of years there was still no man to till the soil nobody to till the soil so then God formed a Man Out of the Dust of the earth see he had spoke the word and then the word had to take place now when he said let there be light maybe there might have been hundreds of years maybe 800 years before there was ever was a light but it came to pass because God said so and God is going to have a church I don't care how many Dark Ages we go through and whatever more he is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle that's right whether we are part of it or not because he has already said it was going to happen it's going to be there am praise God all right now in God's power to transform he says I think this morning in Genesis 1 the world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the Earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a Garden of Eden that is transforming power of God that can take something that nothing and make something wonderful out of it God's transforming power so I want to keep this I I want to paint a perspective I want to paint a picture and I I want to try to keep these things in a in a balance in our mind he said when spirit of God moved upon the face of the water the entire picture was changed from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden and you ask yourself what brought about the change what changed everything and he said he says here the spirit of God moved and it changed everything but this is in God's power to transform but in in uh the whatever the other message was power of transformation brother Benham said it was the effect of a spoken word so it was the effect of a spoken word or was it the effect of the Holy Ghost or are these things working in conjunction with one another as two entities of the same thing because the spirit of God begin to brood and then be God began to say Amen so it was the spoken word of God and the Holy Ghost was there to see that it came to pass because he's the life brother Ben said he's the lifegiver to the word and so it it if I could say it this way and and just just bear with me because every time I make a statement you can always listen especially if you're well versed in your season you can always say but there's another point I know there's another point but I'm making a point there's always another Point amen but but I'm making a point and the point that I'm making is that of course it was the brooding of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost wasn't doing nothing until God said and when God said now the Holy Ghost was making what was said come to pass am so we we can say it it's going to be the work of the Holy Ghost that changes my life but it's going to be the spoken word that changes your life because it's the power of the Holy Ghost that makes the word come to pass amen so it's not as though we're going to get there without the spoken word that's my point amen if so God could have just sent the Holy Ghost to brood over the Earth and bring everything to pass but that's not the that's not the pattern he showed he sent the Holy Ghost to brood and then he said let there be let there be let there be and it all moved in accordance to his word and the spirit worked in conjunction with the word and brought the word to pass upon the Earth amen so let's keep moving and again in God's power of transformation said therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seeds that he had placed upon the Earth he formed those seeds by his own word for there was nothing else to make the seed out of he had placed them and they were beneath the water he just said let there be this and let there be that so here he says it was his spoken word that created the seed so what was laying under the water God's spoken word amen yeah but there was a life in those seeds so what was bringing the conditions to change to bring the life out of the seeds also the spoken word of God so where was the spoken word of God it was the word that created those seeds that were laying under the darkness but it was also the spoken word of God that was moving all the circumstances Amen to bring life out of the seed that was there so that it could come into manifestation it was both the spoken word of God Amen and so now although the although in creation although the word the spoken word of God Amen that had created a seed was already laying there on the in the Earth under the Judgment uh uh condition of the Earth the darkness even though it was there amen it was going to take a spoken word amen to bring the life out of that seed and that spoken word was going to have to rearrange the conditions and bring the conditions about that was conducive to life that was in this seed amen and it was going to take the spoken word to bring to manifestation the spoken word that was in the seed and these two things had to come together to bring the life of the seed into manifestation and the reality of that is that's exactly where where you and I are we come into this world shrouded in darkness according to the New Testament amen our minds darkened to the things of God Amen we come into this world covered over in darkness because of our sinful birth amen and we we are shrouded in darkness we're in a state of judgment amen but down on the inside there's seed laying there from some other civilization or something and it's laying there and you say well the seed's already there the seed will come to life the seed will this the seed will that the seed yes it will but it's going to take the same thing it took in Genesis it's going to take the spoken word of God to move the conditions in place Amen to call forth the life of that seed to come [Music] for and so in God's Great economy he knew where those seeds would land but he knew how to bring the life forth from the sea amen so in doing that he was going to use the spoken word and God in the beginning himself was speaking let there be let there be let there be let there be but then in God's economy he moved into man when man come on the earth and he began to speak through His prophets he began to speak through Adam Adam begin to say let it be that when a man leaves his father and mother of Cleveland to his wife that was the word of God Amen then he moved through prophets and he and he moved through the prophets in the old Testament he moved through Abraham he moved through David he moved through all these prophets amen but now God's economy is such that his word has to be preached under the preaching of the word and I want to talk for a little bit about how important it is to have the preaching of the Gospel let's turn together to 1 Corinthians 1 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and then let's begin 1 Corinthians 1 begin with verse 17 for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the go gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe so God was going to use the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe now when when we look at this word save sometimes we have an understanding of of words but that understanding is maybe a traditional understanding and uh uh we had a minister here not long ago I'm not really recollecting exactly who it was but started to talk to us about this word SA and in the Greek it's the word Soo this word Soo is is what was translated saved here by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and the definition of this is to save to keep save and sound to rescue from danger or destruction it also means uh healing or to make whole it means uh uh to save a suffering one for example one suffering from disease to make well heal restore to health to preserve one who is in danger of Destruction to save or to rescue so this word save he used the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe when we if we look at that word with a traditional I would say a traditional Christian denominational understanding then we know it takes the foolishness of preaching to save the siners so that they can recognize their a sinner and hear the gospel and and they recognize it and be saved amen and if we look at it with that just narrow definition then we say the foolishness of a preaching has accomplished its goal when the person is eternally secure but that's not exact that's not the full extent of what save means it also means to restore to health or to make whole and it takes the foolishness of preaching for us to recognize the gospel and recognize Christ died for us and give our life to him but it takes the foolishness of preaching to heal us from this life to heal us from false understand to heal us from all the things that we've suffered one to make us whole are to bring us back into complete health or adoption to bring us into our ought to be condition and so it's used in the Bible save 94 times make whole nine times heal three times be whole twice so it's more than just this recognition I'm a sinner I need to be saved if that's all it was then you only need to hear one message give your heart to the Lord and the foolishness of preaching was finished for you but I'm I'm here to say we need the foolishness of preaching every day of Our Lives we need it consistently and constantly because we come to this world sick we come to this world Darkness amen we've got this Human Condition amen it's going to take the foolishness of preaching to make us whole to heal us to bring us back into a healthy condition as a Son of God so it is going to require the foolishness of preaching that is God's method that is God's way and it's amazing that when we come through uh uh uh all the apostles understood this all the all the church leaders down through the history of the church they understood this and brother Brenham himself understood this because this is what he said this see what he taught us to do that actually we need the inspired preaching of the word we still needed every much as as we needed it and in the Apostle Paul's day we needed every much today because it's that inspired preaching of the word when God takes the foolishness of preaching why is it foolishness of preaching amen because God just takes a man who's like any other man who's a a frail Fallen human being who's loaded with all kinds of mistakes and inadequacies and he doesn't even pull the best he usually picks the uneducated or the inexperienced or whatever and he takes them and he and he he has a gift planted in them but he fills them with the spirit he anoints them with the inspiration and they come up and they speak words amen and brother B said the hardest thing God's ever had to do is get one man to believe in another man because why because we know what man is and I'll tell you another thing about the foolishness of preaching the foolishness of preaching is such a way that you can sit in your seat and you can see the foibles of that man and sometimes you can see his complexes and you can actually while you're under the preaching of the word you can make a comment and you can disagree with the comment but it doesn't change the fact that the preaching of the word is going to save us telling you it's weird it's weird we make we we can go two extremes under the fitions of preaching be wrong we can go to the side that all of them are frailed all of them are human all of them mess up the word they all make mistakes and I'm not going to have anything to do with them because I don't want anything tainted in my life or we can go to the other side everything that comes out of his mouth when he's behind the pull pit is thus sayeth the Lord he's under an inspiration there's no more man there that's just God if we go to either one of these extremes we're going to find ourselves derailed am the truth is always in the middle I mean sometimes The Man Behind the pull pit he tries to tell a joke and it flops don't pin that on God that may not have been the inspiration of the Holy Spirit tries to tell a funny story and nobody gets it that's the foolishness of preaching it it's dangerous it's risky it's prone to mistakes that's just the truth but it's God's way and if we avoid it if we disrespect it right if we over inflate it we're going to be in error we have to take it the way God sent it amen amen can you imagine being in the first the first church and you and you hear that the Apostle Paul and uh Barnabas they got so upset with each other they got in a fight and they won't even work together anymore can you imagine being disappointed and can you imagine the division that says well I I know Barnabas Barnabas is a good man that can't be barnabas' fault and and your brother's like wait a minute no I know the Apostle Paul and listen I've been with Barnabas and Barnabas can get testy sometimes and every once in a while he makes snarky comments yes sir you have two champions in the early church and man it was Barnabas who introduced Paul to the church it wasn't Paul first it was Barnabas first and then Paul was called to be a light unto the Gentiles to Bear the word and now they have a contention so sharp they won't work together they separate no work together can you imagine the next time you go to hear one of them preach you think who was right and who was wrong and what all the rumors that I'm hearing and blah blah blah but it didn't change the fact that this is God's appointed way amen that's why it it absolutely takes God on both ends it takes God all the way around because it's fraught with with Frailty it's prone to mistake it is weak I mean it's weak weak all the way around it's weak amen but it is God's provided way and if we come God's provided way and ask God to meet us his provided way I believe God is obligated to his word and that he's going to choose the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe so we need the inspired live preaching of the word through men that God has called to pre preach the gospel that doesn't make him superheroes and that doesn't make him right in everything they do that just makes them a vessel that God's chose to use to fulfill his word amen it also doesn't make him the Public Enemy it just makes him a vessel that God's chose to fulfill his word amen Jesus told his disciples in Mark 16 go you into all the world and preach the gospel this is the Great Commission go to preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover when he sent this when he sent these uh these men now when you look at the lives of these men you want to talk about weakness and fraught with problems and the ability to make mistakes but Jesus sent them these disciples and said preach the gospel to Every Creature those that believe are baptized and believe shall be saved and those that don't believe shall be damned then he says these Shin shall follow them that believe all of a sudden what he's what he's telling us is you go and preach the gospel those that believe will be saved and those that believe shall have the life of the word manifest inside of them it's not just words but there's a life that'll be conveyed to those who believe amen they will have this life that's in Christ that life will be in them because it's doing more than speaking words but it's bringing forth a life because there's a power in the preaching of the word and the preaching of the word the power of the preaching of the word is that there's a spirit that comes with it there's a life that's attached to it and those that believe he says will have the life following them when you preach the gospel so it's a I can say it this way it's a conveyance or a transfer of a life amen it's not just an intellectual speech it's not a speech it's not a debate amen it is not man just talking talking points but according to the Great Commission amen if there's a preaching of gospel those that believe shall have the life of the Gospel following the gospel showing you're conveying more than bullet points you're conveying a life amen right let's go to acts 16 together acts 16 and n and before I read this don't read that look up shouldn't even told you where to go I let out all my secrets I was just thinking it just struck me just when I went to look down I didn't pull up the quote so I don't have it exactly right but do you remember when brother bham uh began to talk about what how he views the uh the civil rights movement in his day and what Martin Luther King was doing and the Rebellion that was coming because of it and he thought he was going to lead a million of his people to death remember that brother B says those things and and he comes back like a week later and I I if I could pull the quotes I would tell you exactly but he comes back a week later and that next week he says now I said that about uh Martin Luther King and those poor people he says now that was just my opinion and here's what he said he says you need to know when it's my opinion and when it's the word right and I found out why he did that later I was talking to a brother who grew up in the Tabernacle and that that brother was telling me he said it was his mom that that caused brother benam to come back and say that because his mother met brother benam in a grocery store that week and she looked at brother BR said brother brm isn't that awful that a million of those poor black people are going to die and that struck brother Brenham she was convinced that a million poor black people were going to die because of what the prophet said and then he comes back and he says now that was just my opinion right now this is this is Brother Chad I'm going to give you brother Chad so you don't have to believe it but I think his opinion was still right spiritually his conclusion that conclusion was just something he was just making a statement he's going to lead him to death because I think what we're seeing today and what we've seen through the ambushes and the police and the fighting and the right I think that's a result of that and brother B was picking up on him spiritually because he's a prophet but he wasn't making a prediction he wasn't prophesying he wasn't thus sayith the Lord he wasn't in the office of a prophet saying a million people are going to lose their lives that's not what he was saying he was a man who was picking up something and that man was drawing a conclusion but he didn't want you to take it as of the Lord even though I believe it had all the makings of a prophet who understand God in behind it if I can make that if that makes any sense to you at all so I could look at it and say he was right but he wasn't predicting or prophesying cuz no million people have gotten shot or lost their lives right and so people want to take statement like that and they go all kinds of places with it and they want to be extreme or they want to be whatever I I I believe he was honing in on something because the gift that was in his life and he was spot on to the spirit behind it but he wanted to come back himself and let the people know listen sometimes it's me and sometimes it's God you have to discern you have to know and when he said that all of a sudden I'm just sitting there thinking how in the world am I going to know when it's him and when it's God I mean all of a sudden I'm like that's not fair brother Brandon you can't say a thing like that that's not fair because what am I going to do I'm going to just take my opinion I disagree with that he's wrong he might be spoton right and it may not be his opinion it may be scripture and I don't say that to confuse you I hope it's not confusion because I don't have an answer I don't know how to easily do that all I know to do is keep coming back and say God you have to leave me this is your way I can't always sort it out I don't understand I don't know why that was said that way I don't know why that Minister said or that preacher said it in my heart I don't agree with him but hey this is your way you just get me through all the muddy stuff and get me around the opinion just give me your word and let your word take effect in my life brother B even says in a quote and I didn't pull the quote and I'm sorry but I I I just just just you can go find it if if if you don't believe me come and ask me later I'll find it for you but brother B make a statement to the effect that even if the preacher is misbelieving part of the word the word that he preaches will still have an effect because it's the word of God and if he says something that's true and you receive it as true it'll still work in your life even if that Pro brother is completely wrong in his Doctrine and has all kinds of wrong ideas and even is saying wrong things if he says the truth and you receive it of the truth the power of that word will still be true in your life that's rightow we too often say it's all in or all out but that's just we're human beings and that's just the way it is I think sometimes with us we get uncomfortable in this area of it could be wrong or maybe that's his opinion maybe that's spot on the word and I don't have intellect enough to say it there's no disclaimers before the message I'd have no idea and we're not comfortable with that amen we get uncomfortable because we like everything in a nice tidy category we like to have a label on it we like a binder with a sticker on the outside and know how to categorize it but the foolishness of preaching is what he chose to save them that believe so I don't know that it's ever going to be clean and tidy and perfect with with no no chance for error I don't think it's ever going to come that way because God's looking for one thing he's looking for Faith he's looking for those that can believe the word and respond to the word of God so when brother B said you have to know when it's this and you have to know when it's that I still do this day cannot tell you that I know when it's this and when it's that one thing I know is God used that man to preach the Gospel of Truth to me as a prophet I believe what he taught to be true what's this and what's that I don't know but the the truth that was preached has changed my life yeah and I'm not going to get in debates I just believe him amen and so now in Acts 169 he says and the vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man in Macedonia and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us this is where he was trying to preach in Asia but the spirit kept forbidding him everywhere he would go but in the night the vision came and a man from Macedonia said come over and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately he endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them so the man says here's the man in a vision says come to Macedonia and help us means they need help what was the answer to his question it was a man coming to preach the gospel yeah what was the help he needed he needed Paul to come preach the gospel because the help he needed was preach preaching he needed somebody to come and proclaim the good news for his day that's what that man needed and Paul was the vessel God was going to choose to do it but that man in the vision say come and help us he didn't say Amen would you send us your your best book would you send us amen uh uh some someplace that we can go to school no the solution that he needed was a man who had the gospel to come and preach the gospel let's go to Acts chapter 20 now I like this scripture you'll see why here in a minute Acts 20 and 7 and upon the first day acts 20:7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the tomorrow and continued his speech until midnight and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together and there sat in a window a certain young man named udcus being fallen into deep sleep and as Paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third Loft and was taken up dead so we know that that Paul then goes and lays his body upon him he comes back to life the reason I said this uh I I did not use this scripture to justify long preaching so relax I did not do that but Paul was getting ready to part from them and he was going to be gone maybe some length of time maybe never come back and the very best thing Paul could do for them as parting was to preach and keep preaching with all the time he had because the preaching of the Gospel was what was going to keep them amen so this isn't a justification to preach all night till everybody falls asleep it's Paul's attitude towards preaching amen Paul told the one group he says I hope to come to you and add to the part that's lacking in your faith well was he going to add to the part that was Laing Faith he was going to come preach to them the gospel the revelation of Jesus Christ Paul put value in the preaching of the Gospel the man from Macedonia the help they needed was the preaching of the Gospel the best thing he could do for these disciples that he was going to part with was to preach to them all the time he had until the morning and leave because the preaching is what they needed he am men let's go to Romans chapter 1 Romans chap 1:14 Romans 1:14 Paul says I am a deor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise so as much as it in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to to you that are at Rome also for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God un salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith so this preaching of the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation and Paul was ready to come and preach to them the gospel because he knew the power that the Gospel of Jesus Christ conveyed amen let's go now to Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 verse 13 says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things this is such a a simple pattern but how are they going to call on the name of the Lord if they don't believe how are they going to believe if they haven't heard how are they going to hear if they Don't Preach everything in the scriptures is telling telling us that God is going to use the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and that's still true today amen when Paul when the Apostle Paul was going around and preaching amen Paul was not uh Paul was not building a denomination Paul was not making a movement he wasn't becoming the head of the movement what Paul was doing was imparting life what Paul was doing was bringing the word that would actually change a life amen and he was bringing the the word that would change people's lives and bring them into the image of Jesus Christ because there was a power in the preaching of the word and the power of the preaching of the word was a change in a person's life when they receive the word and so Paul also was bringing a dispensational change and in that dispensational change God Called Paul to be a light unto the Gentiles so Paul now was bearing the light of the age and God used him and sent him out also with faithful ministers with him Amen to go and bring this light to the Gentiles amen because they weren't going to get it listen they weren't going to get it by osmosis they weren't going to get it just because they had a seed on the inside of them wasn't going to spontaneously erupt one day and all of a sudden they had the Revelation but God had a method and it was the same method that he had back in the Book of Genesis there were Gentiles out there with seeds laid inside of them and God had the same method he had for the recreation of the world is the same method he had to reach those seeds in the Gentiles and what he would do is send man send a men send men who would come and proclaim the word over that darkness and void of their humanity and part the waters and let the light shine and the seed that was already in would spring to life and this gospel would have a power of a changed life but God was going to use man to go and deliver his word and be his spoken and his partner upon the Earth to do what he did in the beginning they were going to continue to do and so it takes the preaching of the word it takes the preaching of the word in season to bring about the conditions that are right for that that seed to Spring forth to life and the season has to remain right for the seed to grow into full maturity to manifest what it is brother B said you see you say now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching brother B said he knows everybody's ever going to be saved he knew before the foundation of the world he knows he said he talks about he knows every Gat and how much Tallow it will generate in its lifetime then the question is then then then why are you preaching brother bam he said that's part of God's program preaching is his program so we can't change it let's go to Second Peter together second Peter 2 and5 in 2 Peter 2:5 he says and he spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly God has always had a preacher and now Noah was a preacher of righteousness and what was Noah's message I don't mean to be overly simplistic but Noah his message was the Earth is going to be destroyed and God's provided a way out that was the heart of his message the Earth is going to be destroyed and he could have preached it many different ways and used many types and many different titles to a sermon but I'm sure the sermon always had the same elements in it God is going to destroy the Earth and there's a way of Escape amen but you see that Noah's preaching wasn't just intellectualism and it wasn't just debate neither was it sophisticated speech but Noah's preaching was a reality and it had a life yeah and what was the life of Noah's preaching the life of Noah's preaching was demonstrated by Noah's life Noah actually had to believe what he preached and what he preached was manifesting every day as he was working on this Ark and and that's the way it has to be with the preaching of the Gospel amen the one who's preaching the gospel amen should be the one who's affected most by the gospel what would it be like for Noah to come to the pull pit and Noah start preaching there's a there's there's destruction coming on the earth it's imminent the hand of God he's an angry is a wrathful vengeful God he's going to destroy it but and in order to be saved you have to build an ark but no himself is never building an ark he has no sense of urgency he has no desire he has no discipline he he's he's not doing anything about it listen I would I would uh I would go to say that his gospel is not working in his own life but Noah was preaching out of conviction Noah was preaching from convin he was convinced amen he was convinced and he was concerned and he was doing something about it amen and every day and his life the gospel that he preached was manifest in his own life and that's the way it has to be for everybody who carries this word this gospel should change our lives first and we should be preaching out of a conviction amen that it's true not an intellectual debate not a not a nice philosophical discussion not a better way to live but this has to be a life that has come to me and A Life That's flowing through me and a life that has changed my life amen have I come to Perfection yet absolutely not are there things I want changed absolutely but I'm so convinced that this gospel that I preach has the power of transformation embedded in it because it has transformed my life from what I was to what I am now that all I want to do is for you to get the same life that changed me I want to come to you and I know nothing else to do but take the same word that changed my life and preach it with all of my heart to change your life that's what Noah was doing he was a preacher of righteousness he wasn't out there just condemning the masses he was telling them you're wrong but there's a way of Escape there's life amen There's an opportunity for life and he was working on the boat he was preparing a way he was calling them to something he believed what he preached and it was evident that he believed what he preached listen Noah wasn't preaching a previous message he wasn't preaching a future messag Noah was preaching what was pertinent to the day a way of escape a way of life a chance at life for his day he wasn't getting up talking about you know remember back the story of the Garden of Eden and this if he talked anything about the Garden of Eden it was to bring it to his day to give him a sense of urgency and a need to get on this boat yeah amen cuz his whole gospel amen was salvation for his day but you know when the Apostle Paul come along the Apostle Paul wasn't preaching about building a boat but he had just as much urgency just as much fire just as much life cuz he had come in contact something changed his life and he was working every day amen just like Noah was it was his life his life's work his life's passion every day and Paul the Apostle was preaching what he had received he was living before them in the demonstration and power of the Gospel that there was a life changed but he wasn't preaching buil a boat he was preaching the way of Escape for his day see God has always had a preacher and he's always needed a preacher because God put himself in partnership with man and that preacher has always been somebody who was convinced and concerned convinced because the gospel changed their lives concerned that it would change other people's lives God uses a man let's go together to 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 says and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determine not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God and a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world into our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory so Paul did not come to preach to them enticing words of man's Wisdom but he came to preach to them in the spirit and the demonstration of the power of the spirit and brother Brandon picks this up in Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he makes this statement when referring to the scripture so there you see there's the gospel go you in all the world and preach the gospel didn't say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual Spirit itself demonstrating these signs to listen to this that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God you see to change the man so brother almost he he he he starts to talk about this demonstration of the power and we know the demonstration of the power is the same powers in Jesus Christ doing the same works that Jesus did it can heal the sick it can do all manner of Miracles and all kinds of things but what he's what he's honing down on is see it's got a power in it to change the man amen he's got the power to actually bring a change it changed Paul and now when he preaches it it changed the macedonians it changes the Romans it changes the Corinthians and it turns them into the replication of what he preached amen so that the same life was in Paul moves into them who believe amen so there's a demonstration of the power you Noah had a demonstration of the power the demonstration of the power in Noah's life amen the power of the Gospel that Noah received that demonstration was it changed him from a farmer to a boat builder and he gave all of his life to building this boat it changed him completely to the message he received became the life that he lived the message he preached was the life that he lived so Moses had received the word of God amen God's word comes to accomplish certain things and when the word of the Lord came to Noah it accomplished something in Noah it changed him from a farmer it changed him from an ordinary man going about his farming business doing whatever it changed him into a preacher of righteousness it changed him into a Herald of Truth it changed him from a farmer to a boat builder because this is the season to build a boat and the power of change was in the word that he received yeah and guess what his sons became boat Builders guess what everybody who come to his church was a boat builder don't think that Noah built this all by himself amen have you ever seen the scale of the project and the timeline he had he didn't work on this by himself everybody who came to know his church was interested in building a boat we know that they would finally disbelieve and All Fall Away except for his family but but that's beside the point the the message that he was preaching was transforming them into the word that was was preached and then they all were out what were they doing they were all out cutting trees Trucking them in shaping them down pitching them nailing them fabricating Fasteners and and doing iron work and Brass work there was a whole bunch of things that were happening but everything that was happening was a manifestation of what was preached and wherever Paul went amen as the first church age messenger preaching the message of Christ amen the message of redemption Amen to the G genes now everywhere he went those churches started reflecting the word that was preached amen because it was coming with the demonstration and power the power to change them into the very image of Christ Amen brother M goes on just a little bit further a couple uh paragraphs further in Christ is the mystery said and Paul this great intellectual man never tried to expresses great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the Lord and he lived the word so that it expressed through him he lived so Godly until they seen Jesus Christ in him so much till they wanted his handkerchief to take it and lay it upon the sick there is the Life of Christ amen Paul didn't preach he he didn't I just say it this way he didn't just teach now when brother R says this he says teach and preach and preach is the demonstration of the Gospel brother B is not saying that you shouldn't have a teacher a teacher is part of the five-fold ministry supposed to teach brother B himself said he taught yeah that's not what he's saying he's he's contradicting a denominational idea that all you have to do is show up with a program and instruction sheets and workbooks and teach people what the gospel is and they'll become Christians right that's the whole notion that he's fighting against that why because you're just bringing something that a man had formed and something from a previous day and you collected a bunch of writings and a bunch of ideas and something that worked in another day and you come along and you say in this year Noah built an AR and in this year they had the exod in this year this happened and you put it together in a teaching format like like the denominations replicate over and over and over again and you structure it and you set it up and we teach you how to be a Christian you can't teach somebody how to be a Christian you preach the word and the word comes and finds that seed and the word strips away everything around them and brings a light to the seed and brings life out of that seed but Paul didn't just come with a collection uh uh of documents he didn't come with textbooks he didn't come with a form formulated out of the Jew Roman or the the the church in Jerusalem to come and say now let's establish a church here and let's establish a church here and we'll establish a church here and we'll teach you all the doctrine of the church and we'll teach you how to take up your offering and we'll teach you right no he came and demonstrated there was a life in what he preached there was a life in him there was a life to back it up and when they brought the sick the life that he was preaching would raise the sick raise the dead it would move all kinds of obstacles out of the way it wasn't just teaching a set of a set of things to learn amen he was preaching the gospel and in preaching the gospel he would sit down and teach sometimes but it wasn't that kind of teaching it was the preaching of the Gospel amen and the power and [Music] demonstration he said in in Romans 12 let's go to Romans chap 12 and when when I want to I I just want to refer back to this quote I just read he said what was said at the end was he humbly accepted the word of the Lord and he lived the word so that it expressed through him he lived so Godly until they seen Jesus Christ in him so much till they wanted his handkerchief to take it and lay it upon the sick there is the Life of Christ listen the there was such a demonstration in the of the Apostle Paul that they it wasn't Paul who said if you take a handkerchief from me you'll be healed it was the people recognized there was a life in that man and they wanted handkerchiefs and aprons and pieces of garment why because they saw a living representation of the Gospel it was alive it was powerful and it was working amen amen Romans 12 verse one says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that is what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so he makes this statement that Paul's saying don't be conformed to the world but be transformed by the renew of your mind so our minds need to be renewed and that's part of what the preaching of the Gospel is doing it's washing Us in the washing of the water of the word and it's washing away those wrong things that are in our mind so that our mind can be renewed that means to be renovated that what's the preaching of the Gospel going to do it's going to tear down your thinking to the studs and rip out everything that got bit and placed in there wrong everything from the previous understanding it's going to rip it down to the Foundation amen it's going to do a complete renovation of your thinking amen and that's not going to happen the first sermon you hear but it's going to happen sermon after sermon after sermon because it's renewing you're being transformed by the renewing of your mind in the power of transformation he goes on to say that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word so what is all this preaching doing it's transforming us it's changing the way we think it's changing the way we respond it's the renewing of our mind how this is what he says he says we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought into the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word that's what God's doing to us he's changing us Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians 4:17 says this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind this is why we have to have the transformation of our mind we have to be transformed by the renewing of her mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is is in them because of the blindness of their heart what is it they're in the condition the Earth was in in Genesis 1:2 Darkness alienated blindness but the preaching of the Gospel will be the renewing of their mind it'll change their mind and atmosphere and allow the seed to Spring forth and grow brother B says again in power of transformation he says and all this great thing that he knowed would come to pass he spoke it he could take his he he could take a rest everything under control his seed was his word and his word is a seed Jesus said it was and everything would be all right because he said for it to bring forth of its kind transforming only its kind see his word had to be of its kind if he said a palm tree it didn't mean a palm and an oak mixed together he meant a palm tree here and an oak tree here everything positionally in its place he when God would speak his word he knows that that word would go and accomplish what he sent it to do and then he could take his rest because everything was going to bring forth after its own kind in Isaiah 5511 he says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein I sent it that you know what that means to me that means this m message that God sent in this day will accomplish exactly what God sent it to do what God has spoken through the mouth of a prophet will absolutely come to pass that he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle she's going to come into a marriage Union with Jesus Christ she is going to become the very reflected image of Jesus Christ in a many membered body and she is going to have a change in her atoms and she is going to get a glorified body and she's going to leave this earth under that condition and I believe it with all of my heart why because he spoke it and he's got confidence in the word that he spoke and it will not return into him void but it will accomplish what he said when it was time for it to come into manifestation he sent a prophet along in our day so that that Prophet could preach the gospel so that we could be saved who believe saved how made whole restored healed brought back to full health and it doesn't matter if it was preached 60 years ago it doesn't matter if it becomes 80 years ago it doesn't matter if it becomes a 100 years ago that it was preached it was preached amen it's being proclaimed it's taking effect it will not return into him void but it will accomplish what he said it will accomplish that's why our confidence is what God's done not what we're doing what God's done this is something that I have to constantly remind myself because you know we as human beings we get passionate about things and I'm I'm truly passionate about this message but my personal passion in the message can move me amen Beyond uh certain barriers into trying to press and trying to push or trying to conjure something up or make something happen or push something before it's time or persuade or push people into a certain Conformity amen am and and and that's one of the errors that we can make as people it's one of the errors we can make make as ministers as that we're trying Amen to use our passion amen and our Force to produce something in the kingdom of God but God has his own method for producing something he sent his word amen that's his method and if I've Got Confidence in the word he sent that word's not going to return into him void he doesn't need me to apply extra pressure all I need to do is preach the word and let the word take effect cu the word will take effect amen amen and and I don't say that to condemn any preaching style because we absolutely understand God calls different men for different things and every once in a while we need somebody amen who has the ability to call call us on the carpet and call us to question amen but that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is I don't need to do something to make the word take effect in your life all that I've got to do is proclaim the truth that he's proclaimed to me and if it's the true word of God it'll have the life of the word inside of it and it'll bring life out of you if you've got a seed of God I don't need to use my personality I don't need to use a church discipline I don't need to use peer pressure we don't need to use guilt trips we don't need to use anything to get the word to produce all we need to do is preach the word keep it as true as we know how to keep it keep ourselves out of the way as much as we know how to keep ourselves out of the way and if we can do that that word's going to produce the results and it doesn't matter if you say it in a whisper you say it at the top of your voice it's not the inflection of your voice or the volume that you say it with it's not how dynamic or how boring it's the power of the spoken word it's the foolishness of preaching it's God's Method All you got to do is have confidence in God's method and let the word do the work oh I'm more convinced than ever and I Don't Preach that to you I preach that to me because sometimes I feel constrained I see things that aren't lined up and I got we got to fix this we got to fix that and I stay awake at night sometimes wondering what should we do about this situation or that situation and I've come to terms with myself that there's nothing that I have the power to do it's the power is in the word am we got to preach the word preach the word in season preach the gospel for today and produce the life for today when God was going to bring his children out of the Dark Ages he just didn't expect them to come out of the Dark Ages yeah right he sent a man who caught the revelation of God for his generation and he preached the word then other men got inspired by what Luther preached and they took that same gospel he preached and they began to propagate it all over the world and that Revelation that was given to that messeng that he began to preach and the other men began to preach changed the face of the world yes am it changed the hold of Catholicism it changed the grip it had on Europe it changed Nations it changed boundaries it changed policy it changed kingdoms it changed the entire world what changed the world the preaching of the Gospel when he caught the Revelation from the word that the just are shaved by faith not of Works lest any man should boast as soon as he caught that Revelation and began to propagate that Revelation there was a life in it because it was the word for the season and there were seeds that were laying there predestinated to get a hold of that word amen and when that word came to that seed that was predestinated for Luther's generation the two came together and sprang to life and it changed the whole world Amen yeah do we think the power of this message is one IOD to different than the power that was in that Revelation when Luther come on the scene when it was time for God to grow his bride now she understood what he had done for her under justification now was time for her to get cleaned up and prepared amen for a union with Christ and he was going to bring her to sanctification he didn't just rely on the people to figure it out on their own although it was in the Bible they were blind to it although it was scripture they couldn't see it amen but God would raise up a John Wesley and he would anoint him to catch the vision of God for the day and he would preach the gospel and under the preaching of the Gospel it would Inspire other men to preach the gospel and what did it do in his day it changed the whole world Amen changed religious systems changed structures changed everything caused Wars caused travel caused all kinds of stuff this message is the word of God and it has to be preached and preach doesn't mean standing in a pull pit and sweating preach means to Proclaim this message has to be proclaimed has to be declared has to be lived has to be spoken has to be shared amen and it has the power to change the whole world Amen this message has the power to change the face of the world I V to say this message is changing the world changing economies changing politics changing weather patterns amen what's doing it this gospel it's changing the whole environment everything is changing to match the word in its season again in the power of transformation he says when God has spoken he know his word was sealed in it it could it would bring forth of its kind now it was commanded to bring forth only of its kind and it will always do that if a man don't tamper with it we know in Genesis it was tampered with it was tampered with it brought death is that right but even though it was tampered with and brought death that tampering and that death is only temporal because the word is eternal you can't tamper with it forever and just because you tampered with it or changed or modified it or whatever you did Amen to change it and it brought death doesn't change the truth behind the word that word will still live on Amen the word of God what God brought through his Apostles it was tampered with it was modified it was harnessed by men for different purposes but it never changed the truth that was laying there you can't change the truth that was laying there that's God's word so they tampered with it and they brought death and they brought cycles of death through denominationalism but in the end time amen when God was going to come on the scene amen what he did was he just took the tampering away and brought back the restoration to the true word because that word has life in it amen just like when it was buried under the waters of the Earth in Genesis 1:2 it still had life inside of it all he had to do was move the tampering away from it and the life would spring forth and the same thing with the word of God it's got the life brother Brenham said it's got the life to reproduce itself is in the seed amen amen praise God again in power of transformation he says now he had all this in mind and he said let there be now that's Genesis 1 let there be this let there be that he was sowing seed Let Let It Be Here let it be here let it be here and he knew it was going to be that way because it cannot change now that gives us Faith then in what we what he said here it's going to be so let's let that seed fall into our hearts that we might be the bedding grounds of that see into our hearts remember in one analogy you're the seed that's from a previous civilization that's laying underneath this judgment of this body that you're born into and it's the spoken word of God that begins to move the darkness and the Mist off of your life so that the light of the word can strike it and bring it to life that's that's one analogy but now we're coming to the other one now you're the good ground amen what what facilitates good ground what makes it good ground what made it good ground is it didn't have rocks in it yeah it didn't have Thorn covering it wasn't a sidewalk and I would venture to say it was tilled ground that means this is ground that somebody predetermined that seed would fall in yeah ground that was I would say this predestinated ground predetermined ground for the seed to fall and that's the elect of God God has predestinated good ground in every age where his seed for every age is going to fall God did not leave it up to chance he wasn't hoping that maybe some seed would fall in a good patch of open dirt he made sure before the foundation of the world that there was going to be good ground in every age for his seed to fall and by predestination he has made if we're Believers and children of his he has made us by predestination good ground amen and what does the good ground need the only thing the good ground needs Hey listen the ground never prepared itself tell me in a patch of ground that this designated I'm going to be your Field of Corn no somebody else made that choice somebody else removed the rock somebody else pulled off the obstacle somebody else tilled it somebody else fertilized it amen I never determined that I was going to be good ground but God before the foundation of the world said that I was going to be good ground that was his choosing not mine now what do I need I need that good seed of the word for my day I need it to fall in this good ground so that it can bring forth the life of Jesus Christ I need the word amen he says so let's let the seed fall into our hearts what seed is he talking about the seed that is sword went forth to swow the word of God that we might be the bedding grounds of that se into our hearts and let us act out this place that he has placed Us in in the last days see let the seed fall in our hearts Lord let the word fall in my heart let there not be any unbelief like Abraham when he was an old man looked like impossible how are they going to do that how is he going to be this way he never considered that he just received the word of God and went on believing it and God brought it to pass now God had said all these things so he knew it would be and it did he brought forth of its kind Abraham was good ground you believe that he was good ground and when the seed fell in the good ground that he was going to be a father of Nations that he was going to bring forth the son listen he could not produce that himself all he could do was let the seed fall into his heart and brother B said keep believing it because the life to produce itself to transform itself is already in the seed Abraham couldn't make it happen when he tried he failed he couldn't force it he couldn't do anything the only thing he could do was receive it into the ground that he had into his heart and believe it and let it do what it was predestinated to do it wasn't Abraham that brought forth a child it was the promised word of God that brought forth a child so that it wasn't his efforts it wasn't his intellect it wasn't his abilities it wasn't him it was God who formed his own word it was the promised word that produced the son not Abraham who produced the son and neither it is it going to be you and I who produced the life of Jesus Christ as a member of the Bride it's going all we can do is be the good ground that he predestinated and receive that prophecy receive that word of the Lord into our heart and just believe it and hold fast to it and let it do what it was already designed to do it'll bring forth its own life it'll bring forth and manifest its own manifestation amen why because God promised it he's going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle it means he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle now let's just look at Abraham for a minute if if God tells Abraham Abraham out of your loins is going to come a son he's going to come from you you're going to have a child you're going to be a father of Nations if that word preached becomes the measuring line that Abraham has to measured to in order to become right in the eyes of God Abraham's got a problem because Abraham has an infertile wife he can't produce it if God if the word of the Lord that came to Abraham became the measurement then Abraham has to reach the measurement in order to be right in the eyes of God then Abraham is defeated before he ever started Abraham's finished cuz he can't produce a son they come up with plans and he produces a son and that fails and I'd like to paint another picture the word of the Lord was not the measuring line by which Abraham had to achieve in order to be part of God the prophecy was God declaring to Abraham what I'm going to do with you it wasn't what I need you to do for me it's what I'm going to do for you amen you know what this message is this message is a vision of what a Perfect Bride is a bride with the gifts of the Spirit a bride with the full truth of the word a bride who's humble and submissive and perfect in every way a bride adorned in the wedding garment a bride who in every way is a reflection of her bridegroom on Earth do you know what that prophecy is not it is not a measuring line for you to measure up toise God it is not God saying this is my bride I will have a bride in this day this is the standard for the bride now let's see if you can make it yeah and if you make it you'll be my bride that's just as foolish of Abraham trying to be a father of Nations but you know what the prophecy is in our day you know what the message is God's saying this is what I'm going to do with you amen this is where I'm taking you this is the direction you're going in this is where this is all going to end it's all going to end and I'm going to have a bride I will present myself a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing never required you to do it all all you got to do is let it fall into good ground and just keep believing it and keep walking and you just keep saying it's nothing but the truth you don't have to make it come to pass you don't have to twist yourself in knots to make it come to pass you just keep believing it because the power is in the prophecy to bring itself to pass we need to let that word of the Prophet fall into to good ground and just keep believing and and be willing to wait if God said let there be light 800 years was light it didn't matter if there was going to be light and if God said he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle and he sent a message to produce it I don't care if it's 50 years of my life I don't care if I live to be 120 years old and I'm sitting at 119 and I thought Oh I thought it would happen a long time ago I don't want it to change anything in my heart that God at 119 years old can change me into that image because he said so cuz it's his word because when it came time for it to come into manifestation he had to bring somebody on the seat that could preach it and when it was preached it put things into motion amen that over decades has been transpiring to bring us more and more into that image it's not our efforts it's not that we're better people it's not that we're doing a better job or we have a better understanding of the message it's the prophecy bringing itself to life in you and [Music] I see the reason we we the reason we get desponded or discouraged or pulled back or overly aggressive is when we think the message says this is what a bride is now we all got it we got come on guys let's get there and then all of a sudden the pastors got to make it happen the Evangelist has to make it happen the preachers got to work and the dads and the moms got to make their kids and we all got to push each other and we don't let anybody get away with anything and we why cuz we got to get here and every time we get One Step Up On The Run on the ladder that way guess what happens we fall back down until we become despondent and discouraged and feel like it's never going to happen things in my life are never going to change I'm always going to struggle with this I'm always going to struggle with that let's change our vision of what God gave us am amen God did not give us a standard measuring line for us to climb to so that we could be bride first he said you are bride amen not hopefully someday you are by virtue of the faith that's in your heart it declares that you're bride because only the bride's going to believe this message so he settles that question first you're a child of God why what's the evidence Faith but he didn't give me a certificate in the mail I would have liked to have had one there's days I would like to have it on my refrigerator but you know what the devil would do if if I got it he would be like no no you got that wrong there's another Chad Lamb they got the addresses mixed up I would love to have that but the security is faith faith is the evidence things not see so he goes ahead and tells you your bride and then he doesn't give you a standard to measure to in order to be bride what he does is he calls you bride and then he points to a spot on the map and he says you just stay close to me this is where I'm taking you you just stick close to me I'm not asking you to go I'm not asking you to achieve I'm not asking you to find all I'm asking you to do is trust Meen this is our destination together this is where the word is taking us you see the same truth with the wrong Vision brings nothing but despair but the same truth with a different Vision brings so much joy and anticipation because now every service I step into every time I pick up my Bible every time I pray every time I listen to a message God is might be just directing me down this map the next I might be getting to the next Village and the next Village and the next Bend in the road what's he doing he's promised to take me there he's going to take me there and the preaching of the gospel and the word that he's given me is the method he's taking me there praise God we're getting there and now there's a hopeful expectation there's Faith there's joy now every service is not coming to find out how far below the mark I am but every service is an opportunity for God to Lead Me One Step Closer to the destination he's taking me to and you can walk in the church with absolutely two exactly different expectations and one will bring a joy and anticipation in your heart and the other will bring a dread an absolute dread amen and a desire to run out the back door amen yeah and if we've got the wrong Vision let's just say we have the wrong Vision we've got the vision of I'm going to come to church and find out how far away I am from The Mark again and then the pastor announces we're going to have an evangelist on Sunday how do you come into church way worse than before but with this other picture oh we're having an evangelist I know something's weighing me down on this journey and it's got to get cut off of me I know I'm a little tired I know that I'm a little author I don't know what it is but God's going to come and cut it off of me because he's promised to get me from point A to point B by his own effort by his own leading by his own work and this is one of the methods he's going to use it it's not a you got to do better it's no hey if you just drop that and let go of it it's going to be easier and the vision about what the word is doing in our lives changes the way we step into the sanctuary and the way we pray before the service and the way we listen to the word it has everything to do with the way we understand this message and what we believe this message to be yeah amen and some of that was formed in us a Long Ago by the way people presented and handled and our own temperaments and things that happen in life but I'm here to to tell you that God is Not setting a measuring standard that's impossible to achieve he didn't do it for Abraham he didn't do it for anybody else what he has done is he's told you where our destination is he's pointed to the map and said listen this is where I'm taking you and how is he going to get us there he's going to use the word oh my goodness see there just a few more things I want to share as I wind down I'm just going to skip ahead and share just a couple more things and there's a couple more quotes out of God's power to transform that I want to read he says and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plan or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that would be what he said it would be that there's two ways of looking at this you're the seed and in you he already put the potentials of what you will be it's not what you paste on glue on or acquire it's what's already inside of you just coming to manifestation it's the life is already in the seed the transforming power to transform the the transforming power to transform an oak tree into that beautiful glorious Oak with all those acorns on it is already in the seed in seed form it's already there but then on the other side when God's preaching the word and that word is to produce something in our lives amen the power of transformation is in the word that's preached and when we're the good ground and let the seed fall into our hearts the power of transformation is already in the seed if that word's preached it will if it's preached cherry tree guess what's going to produce cherry tree if it's produced Palm to preach palm tree guess what's it going to produce a palm tree because when we receive the seed of God in our hearts is good ground and rest it's got life in it already and the preaching of the Gospel is taking us some place amen because the word has a life already embedded in it the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it is his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stays in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything and Trust in his own son that it would be that way when God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be you know what that tells me you're not changing yourself into anything and you don't have the power to transform yourself if there's any transforming power in you it's the power that God embedded into the seed Gene when he placed it in you and now he's bringing word on top of that to produce that life that's what it must be because I've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be God has never changed just the same today as he was then God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing is going to stop him right so when you look at when we went from the Dark Ages into Luther's day God had to bring a word and that word had to have within it transforming power because people were steeped in darkness and Catholicism amen so what God provided to them was a seed with transforming power and when that seed fell into good ground it transformed them from the Dark Ages from Catholicism and the protestantism they didn't do it themselves it was the word that was preached that did it when they moved from justification to sanctification it wasn't that they did some sort of work themselves it was the power of the word transformed the whole age amen and the same thing's happening today that's why am mean God has sent us a glorious message and this message is huge and it covers so many facets but God in his great wisdom has left a five-fold Ministry upon the Earth amen because we come to the foolishness of preaching that we might be made whole and God is Anointed by inspiration men who will pick up parts of that message because the seasons in our life are changing now it's time for this to manifest but I can't manifest It On My Own It Takes the preaching of the word to bring me from justification to sanctification sanctification to the baptism of Holy Ghost the children of God never made this transition through the church ages on their own it was always the power of the word that was preached that they responded to and reive brought itself to pass right amen and that's why we come to church Wednesday and Sunday and listen to preaching and listen to text why because we believe that God through the foolishness of preaching is making us whole he's restoring us he's healing us he's bringing us to our ought to be healthy condition as children of God and it's going to take certain Seasons certain words and certain Seasons to bring about changes that we need to make in our life because when we were amen when we were in Luther's age we were blind to sanctification and had no need no knowledge of needing to live a Sanctified life but when the season was going to change God brought up a man who preached you must live a Sanctified life right didn't get a new Bible we don't get a new message but when the seasons change God's got anointed inspired men to come and bring that message in a way now you can say that's it that's nothing but the truth receive it into good ground and let that word that's been preached bring the change how many of you have been changing amen how many of you notice preaching changes preaching in a church changes from year to year it changes you can go through a season that's super Dynamic where you can hardly stay in your seat you want to scream and shout and every son your leg shaking you want to just get up and say hallelujah there's nothing but the truth then you go into another season and all you want to do is Weep the whole time and you say wo is me God I need changes in my life one season will tell you the greatest Thing That Ever Walked you're the apple of God's eye nothing can harm you and you want to run all over the building the next season in life you think I'm nothing but a dirt ball and I'll never be any good if God doesn't save me I need his help that's the foolishness of preaching it's not man's ideas that's God using as an inspired channel that he has to bring us in seasons of our walk and seasons of our life remember Brother Kyle preached seasons of life not long ago God knows how to bring us through those transitions in our life and he's going to do it by his word he's not asking us to Buck up and get with the program and figure it out if there's a change needed he'll bring the word that brings the change if there's growth needed he'll bring the word that brings the growth and that's why we should have respect for the foolishness of preaching I don't say that cuz we don't obviously you're here but I think we should realize what a blessed benefit it is that God is going to bring word in due season for my growth yeah amen he's not no matter what what's happening he's not here to say you're not good enough meet the standard he's here to say this is where we're going now amen this is where I'm taking you now because the word will produce itself do you believe that we have to believe that amen the problem is if we don't believe that we're defeated before we start the word has to produce itself Amen brother B says again in God's power to transform he said that word has to come to pass it's God word plant it in your heart if you want to go in the Rapture if you want to be a Christian genuine placed this word as I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet in the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed don't you let some educated Theologian out here try to pump it out of you don't you let him spray you with some carnal science and knowledge and education you believe God I love that analogy what brother bam said he says listen he says if you want to go in the rapture so if I stand to in front of a group of people I say do you want to make the Rapture I mean I don't know anybody that's going to not raise their hand we all want to go in the Rapture if you want to be Christians genuine place this word then he says then he goes back to Ezekiel he says like Ezekiel was told to eat the scroll brother baham didn't say if you want to make the Rapture make sure you stop indulging in entertainment make sure you come to church every service and pay your ties and don't let me ever see you speed you understand that's not what he's saying so if you want to make the Rapture take the word feed on the word become one with the word because the word's going in the Rapture amen the word will produce its own life the word will bring it to pass inside of you what our job is not to analyze our job is not to perfect our job is not to self self educate or self perfect our job is just to receive the word in the good ground and let the word do what it's supposed to do let's turn to John 6 I want to finish here with just this thought John chapter 6 John chap 6 verse 63 says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life brother Brenham in the fourth seal said the word itself is spirit so the word itself is Spirit it's spirit in word form why because God and the word and Christ and spirit they're not separate things they're all the same thing the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts what's happening when I receive the word genuinely receive the word in my heart when I receive the word the the word itself is Spirit or like brother B said it has the power of transformation in it there's a life in the word when it's preached living a Living Word preached has life in it it's the life that comes from the word it's the life that comes with the word it's the life that reproduces itself it's the Holy Ghost if I receive the word and the and the purity of the word have it have its preached a living word for my day there's there's life in the word word the life of God Jesus said the words I speak to you they are spirit and they are life say I need more of the spirit absolutely you need more of the spirit how am I going to get more of the spirit take in more of the word because the word has life to produce life and it's the spirit that brings the word to life the spirit is the life of the word it's the spirit of God that produces the life that's in the word just keep receiving the word just keep saying God I Believe by your predestination I'm that good ground not cuz I'm good but because you made me you made me a receptor for your word I don't believe I'm good but I believe I'm a receptor for your word amen God let that word drop in my heart and help me to trust your process to bring it to life brother B said again Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says unbelief in the word which is himself The Word of Life the word only has life any other word is hybrid no matter how much it looks like it it isn't the word the word produces its own life and Eve swapped that for personal knowledge the word will produce the life why is it when God wanted to have a bride he sent a prophet with the word because the word that was preached when it falls into good ground it'll produce that life what life the life of the Bride what are you receiving bride word If you're receiving pure bride word with the life of bride inside of it what are you going to become bride not by effort but by reception by by receiving a word with life in it amen that's why it that's why we're not preaching the word that lived in a previous day because it was the life for that day but we're preaching the word that has life in it for today to manifest the life of today amen because that word has life in it it is life it is spirit and it is life and it will reproduce its own life brother B tells us in the rising of the sun he makes this statement this is the last thing I want to say this morning it says notice he said it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first Corner Wheat by God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him from the dead and he was the first first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was the sheath he's speaking of the wave sheath now that's why they had to wave that sheath for it was the first one that came to maturity and it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign brother B is telling us that he goes back to the wave sheath offering which was part of the Feast of the Lord in Israel it was instituted under the law of Moses and they would take the first part of the Harvest that would come to maturity brother R said somewhere around the corner where it got more light they would pluck it and bring it to the priest and the priest would pluck it up and he would wave it and he would do it as a memorial before God in Thanksgiving that God had brought their Harvest to full maturity but here's what he says and it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign so when that wave sheath was waved it became sign that the God who brought this to maturity is the same God will bring the whole crop to maturity amen he goes on to say and as Christ was the first one this is a little further down in the same message as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheath waved again in the last day he's saying when we're coming out of the church in the bride coming of Christ there's going to be another waving of this sheath what is it the first part of the field to come to harvest maturity has to be waved as a Thanksgiving waving of the sheath what was the sheath the first one that came to mature the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for Resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and is being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live he live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power remember that day that Jesus resurrected he was the wave sheath waving over them first fruits of those that slept showing that whatever God done to bring this seed to maturity he'll bring the whole Harvest to maturity but in the end time which is our time and the coming out of the churches and the bride coming Christ which is right now amen there's going to have to be another wave a sheath waved and he said when the fullness of the word comes to maturity and when God waved that he did that by plucking up a man who the word came to maturity and and showing a Son of God on display amen you know what he did when he showed that life he showed a life of humility he showed a life of reverence he showed a life of Miracles he showed a life of signs and wonders he showed a life reverent to God he showed us his life he showed us even uh the the bad things the mistakes the repentance so we saw somebody could humble themselves under the word we saw a life friends that message didn't wave that life over us so we could say I'm never going to be like brother Brandon right right I'm never have that kind of humility I'll never see those manifestations in my life I'll never have that kind of consecration I'll never have that kind of Revelation you know brother bam said they weren't all to be Moses we're not all to be the prophet of the age we don't have to do everything brother bam did that's not the point the point is the maturity as a Son of God he came to amen when that word come to maturity God had an example on the earth and it was waved over us not for us to lose heart at how far from me to him it is I mean the Gap may be huge and and and it may be insurmountable but that's not why God did that God did that to say the same method that got this man to be a vessel that I could use is the very same method I'm going to use for the whole field yeah that was never to discourage us friends it was always to encourage us this message was never to discourage us saying I'll never measure up it was always a destination a point on the map to look to with anticipation say the chief Shepherd is here and he said said he's going to take me from here to there so I am going from here to there it doesn't matter about me he's here himself that's why Christ came in this age to make sure that we weren't going to get derailed and we weren't going to fall backwards we weren't going to miss the mark and this end time he is going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle he's going to present to himself a bride fully array in the wedding garment and he didn't leave it to ourselves that's why he's returned in the fullness of the word so that he can take us by the arm and lead us all the way to the destination it's not you do this and you do that and you you rest and follow me the word I'm taking you all the way cuz the word has life itself this message that was preached and is being preached has the power in itself to produce you as a perfect bride it's not your human efforts it's not my human efforts it's not my prowess as a preacher it's not my ability it's not persuasion neither is it confirmation or reformation and neither is it force and neither ises it you trying harder now don't get me wrong try harder you should try harder like we should do our part the a calls to be lazy Christians right but we're not going to get there on our own that Ministry that was waved over us it was none other than Jesus Christ veiled behind flesh that's right showing us that in this generation under this Revelation sons of God can come to maturity come to adoption maturity it can happen it that was never done to discourage us that was always done to encourage us and give us Faith don't let the devil use what was meant for good don't let him use it for evil don't get locked up when you say how far I am from The Mark get excited because you got a lot of ground to gain and you're going to gain the ground it's not a matter of if it's only when and when is his determination not mine I can't we're standing here with a promise just like Abraham had a promise for 25 years he couldn't do one thing to move himself closer to the promise but every time that he needed to move closer to the promise God came on the scene and spoke to him and moved him closer to the promise he didn't have to find it on his own he didn't have to figure it out on his own he didn't have to assume he didn't have to strive all he had to do was rest in the promise and respond when God came what do you think it is you and I should be doing in this promise to the sons of Abraham just say God let that word fall in me and produce its own life let the conditions of this bright light let it bring that seed life that's already embedded in me your life because you're the word and you place the word in me let that word come to manifestation in me I wonder how much of our growth we slow down because we try I wonder how many times we trip over our own feet and we derail ourselves by our own efforts when brother Brenham said the entire Christian experience is based on rest and the Holy Ghost is rest amen if I can get to the place where I believe that word with all of my heart and I know it's the truth and I receive it and I stand with it then I can rest because now it's not me it's not my obligation it's not my requirement it's God who obligated himself to bring this word to pass I can rest cuz he's a good God I can rest cuz he tells the truth I can rest cuz he's never be defeated I can rest because he'll never fail amen I can rest because he said he'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or any blemish or any such thing I can rest now as his bride because he said he'll present to himself he never said hey bride present yourself to me that was part A Wrinkle I can rest because he said Abraham could rest because God said we can rest because God said oh friends you know what this message is the most exciting thing we've ever heard you know what this message is encouragement and enthusiasm and excitement because we know where we're going amen the Rapture is for me how are you going to get there I don't know but he can't leave me behind because the Rapture is for me the body change is for me Perfection is for me maturity is for me adoptions for me why because I believe it's for me how you going to do it I don't know how I'm going to do it but this word will produce its own life it's got life in it and I've received this word and the spirit's going to work to bring it to pass I tell you what friends I love this message so powerful it's so encouraging it's so exciting I want to get to where I I can't wait to play the next tape because the next tape is going to take me the next step on that map cuz I know what the destination is it's joint HS with Christ it's City with him and a perfect Triune being and back on this Earth and a millennium that's the destination that's where I'm going how am I getting there my husband said he'll take me there and he's here now I've got him by the arm we're moving that direction and every sermon every service every scripture every prayer has the potential to take me one step closer to there amen I'm not going the wrong way cuz he's here to make sure I don't go the wrong way if I had my foolishness step to the left I believe he's here to bring me back to the right he didn't ask me to do it myself he asked me to trust him he didn't ask me to perform he asked me to rest amen he asked me to just to surrender and rest and trust and Obey and submit he'll do the rest how's he going to do it he's going to do it all kinds of ways but one way he's going to use the preaching of the word the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe and now I can't wait to hear preaching again amen and God bless you all let's Stand Together musicians if you'll come there's so many more things that I'd like to share we may at another point so many little Sid trails and things about the word and the spirit but I tell you God is so good amen you know nobody showed up in 1700 and so and so and said you know what I think it's time for a transition in the Christian walk and we should come to the truth of justification and not works and I'm going to be one of them that's not what happened God knew it was time when God knew it was time he sent a man with a message amen and that message transformed everything to match that word because it was the season nobody rose up in John Wesley's day and said you know what I think you know what we need to live a cleaner Holier life no it was God determined it was the season for that and when it was season God sent men to preach the gospel and that word that they preach transformed the Christian world you know what neither is it you and I that decided it's time to have a bride age it's time for a bride to come into manifestation it's time for a many member bride a people of God to actually put on Christ until Christ can dwell in them and the world can see Christ you know we didn't decide that he did he decided it's time and when it was time he sent a man with a gift to preach the gospel and he sent other gifted men along with him to preach that gospel and it's the word that was preached that's producing that bride what do we need to do receive it and Trust in it yield to it surrender and rest and let God do what he promised to do he's the one who moved every circumstance to get that Ministry around the world he's the one who moved all the circumstances in your life so that you would hear it is he not able to bring the word to pass in our lives I believe he is let's just bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your word Lord God what can we say when we say thank you for your word what a small thing to say Lord we tell people thank you for treats and blessings God it's more than a Thank You From My Heart Lord it's more than thank you for your word I realize I'd be nothing without your word I'd be lost and in darkness I'd be shrouded in all kinds of confusion I'd be wward and I'd be heartbroken and I'd be ripped to shreds and I would have ruined my life it's not just thank you for your word but your word is more than life to me God when we can't see you bring Revelation when we're confused you bring Clarity God you're continually unveiling yourself to us to make the picture come in clearer and better focus God forgive us for our anxiousness Lord forgive us for our frail human efforts forgive me Lord for thinking that you needed me to do something forgive me for those efforts I put forth trying to manufacture or to produce I truly am sorry Lord but God I'm here to say let that seed Fall In My Heart Lord let it take root let it take over God I want that seed to so fall into this ground that you've predestinated and chosen until in a short order nobody can see the ground anymore all they see is the crop that the ground is completely enveloped by the crop and the crop grows to maturity till now nobody sees the crop but they see the fruit let that be the Story of My Life Lord you sent a s in my day and that swer threw out seed and that seed fell in my ground thank you God Lord help all of us to be your sers that made me go about proclaiming your word Lord and may that word still fall into good ground and may it produce a Bountiful Harvest hundredfold over God as that seed falls into us may it bring the seed within us to life to manifest what you've ordained for us to be from before the foundation of the world for you did not call us in Luther's age you did not call us in Wesley's age you didn't call us in the Pentecostal age but you called us in the bride age to be your bride and that's the seed that you placed within us and that's what's manifesting and meant to manifest in our lives help us God God I pray that you would give us a boldness and a confidence in your word that we can just stand fast and rest assured that you will accomplish what you sent your word to accomplish for you declared in Isaiah that it will not return unto you void but it will accomplish the purpose you sent it for God you sent this message and you gave us your word and we believe it will accomplish its purpose now we're putting our trust and confidence in you we're not looking to flesh we're not looking to man we're not looking in ourselves for God we're a failure to begin with but God we're looking to what you have said and what you have done and what you have Vindicated and what you have confirmed and we're holding fast with confidence that you're going to finish the work that you started and that you're going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle God I yield to you I Surrender to that and may it come to pass in our lives we love you and we thank you Father and ask for you to help us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all brother John only to be what he wants me to be every moment of ever every day yield it completely to Jesus
