[0:00] it's beyond Redemption you he says now
[0:03] think about what he says put a George
[0:05] Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in
[0:07] every County it can't come back that
[0:09] means you cannot bring it back by
[0:13] politics because of George Washington
[0:15] Abraham lincol in every County I mean
[0:17] wow that would be a
[0:21] change that would probably bring a lot
[0:23] of changes but you can't bring it back
[0:25] by politics that's why the magum
[0:28] movement is an
[0:31] Antichrist I I I say that I mean I I may
[0:35] have offended people but I don't mean to
[0:36] offend you but the prophet of God says
[0:40] she'll never come back she'll never rise
[0:42] again says she's Beyond Redemption so
[0:45] how can we believe that we can make
[0:47] America great again when the prophet of
[0:49] God has condemned it and said it'll
[0:51] never come back so there's not a
[0:54] candidate there's not a party there's
[0:55] not a Grassroots effort that can ever
[0:57] bring it back if so then the prophet of
[1:00] God was
[1:02] wrong y That's why we as the bride we
[1:05] don't need to have anything to do with
[1:07] any
[1:08] Politics the devil has it all under his
[1:11] control we don't need to worry about
[1:14] it so listen I I I just want to tell you
[1:17] I'm your brother and I love you and I'm
[1:19] not here to offend anybody I'm just here
[1:21] to tell you what I believe to be the
[1:23] absolute truth of this message and I
[1:25] don't mean to be offensive I don't mean
[1:27] to say things hard I just want to talk
[1:29] to you as a brother brother and I want
[1:30] to talk to you as a pastor and a
[1:31] shepherd of this local church and and
[1:33] say let's be led and G Guided by the
[1:36] word not by emotion not by politics not
[1:39] by our feelings and not even by our own
[1:41] desires because our own desires would
[1:43] want a better country our own desires
[1:45] would want morality our own desire
[1:47] listen friends uh when you look at when
[1:49] you look at uh when you look at two
[1:51] parties and you look at their platform
[1:52] and you look at what their stand for how
[1:54] can you not like policies on the right
[1:58] how can you not how can you agree with a
[2:00] strong National border how can you dis
[2:02] agree with parental rights to make
[2:04] decisions about gender choices for their
[2:06] children how can you not agree with how
[2:08] can you not agree about religious
[2:10] liberty how can you not agree about
[2:12] economic plans it it there's so many
[2:14] things that in the natural sense we
[2:16] would agree with and see as right and
[2:19] good and in line with what is
[2:21] righteous but don't forget the deception
[2:24] is always what's close not what's far
[2:27] away so be very very careful that we
[2:29] don't attach ourselves to something amen
[2:32] that is claiming to be able to do
[2:33] something that God said's not
[2:36] possible
[2:38] am God sent us a prophet for a reason he
[2:41] opened our eyes for a reason to keep us
[2:43] free to be a free people and to stay
[2:46] free amen
