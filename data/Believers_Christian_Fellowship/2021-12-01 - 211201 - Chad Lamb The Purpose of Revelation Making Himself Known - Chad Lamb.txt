our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this privilege of standing here together and singing lord songs to praise your name songs of love and admiration for you for all you've done for us and god lord as we come to this portion of the service where we take the word and begin to read it lord we're asking that you would come and provide the supernatural element that's needed to break the bread of life lord that you would give us i sav that we might see and you prick our hearts that we might comprehend lord all that it is you're trying to share with us in this hour may we be changed people lord may we leave here lord having grown some by the revelation that you give to our hearts we ask that you would be pleased and all that's said and done and that you would take your place at the head that you would have preeminence among us as we yield ourselves to you speak your word of life to our hearts we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you as you're standing let's take our bibles and turn to john chapter 17. i heard the prayer request read for sister lori tamblington and i had the privilege of talking to brother glenn and sister lori today and when i talked to sister lori it was a treat because i was encouraged by her faith amen she was positive on the phone and they're going through a really difficult trial quite a shock all of a sudden to get information that they received is quite a shock but she was standing on the promise and believing she was in god's hand and she was trusting the lord and i got done with that conversation and i was encouraged by her faith so just remember to keep them in prayer who knows what path they have to walk and what they may have to experience and and doctors and all of those things but just pray that the lord would just encourage her faith then give them wisdom step by step to walk the path that he predestined for them and just just remember them in prayer in the next coming days and weeks also i talked to brother jonathan baumgardner and his wife sister irena's father passed away yesterday morning and he had been suffering with lou gehrig's disease and his health had been deteriorating and he passed away yesterday morning so he has gone on to his reward but the baumgardner family will be traveling this weekend back to alabama for the funeral to be gone most of next week so just remember them in prayer remember the whole family but especially brother jonathan and his family as they travel down and travel back and let's just stand together as a body and hold one another up amen also i wanted to announce that the meetings that were scheduled this weekend at brother dan ratliffs have been postponed one week they had a few coveted cases in their church so brother dan decided just to postpone it a week to be safe so brother ben will be preaching up there not this weekend but next week weekend 11th and 12th saturday night and sunday so if you plan on going up make sure you adjust your plans one week for the 11th and the 12th and i'm sure brother ben would love to see your smiling faces and hear your loud amen and just support the gift amen let's look here at john chapter 17 verse 3 and for a title i'd like to take the purpose of revelation making himself known john 17 verse 3 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god in jesus christ whom thou has sent so what is eternal life this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god in jesus christ whom thou has sent amen god bless you as you're seated may he bless his word tonight i took my title from this quote that i'm going to read out of christ as the mystery of god revealed and it says reveal webster says to make known make known and especially webster says in divine truth that revelation means the revelation it is christ's way of making himself known to his church amen so the revelation it is christ's way of making himself known to the church we we get concepts sometimes when we hear the term revelation and we you know being in the message and and coming to church for so long you hear the term revelation you hear it over and over and over again and some people uh uh have different ideas about revelation and for some it's just maybe information for some maybe it's something that is foreign and far away but when brother branham gives us the definition all of a sudden the definition comes right home amen revelation is christ's way of making himself known to his church what is it it's christ wanting to share himself with you amen revelation is not something that's high and beyond reach for the believing child it is not intellectual knowledge or understanding it's not revelation it's not something that's so deep that you can never get it you can never share it you can never have it it's only for the uh the theologian or for the deep thinker no revelation is christ's way of making himself known to his church revelation is simple amen it's not complicated even though the revelation that's given can be quite deep amen it can go quite deep into the mysteries of god quite deep into the bible but revelation is simple when it comes down to the very core of it it is christ making himself known to his church amen revelation by revelation amen word upon word christ is he's wanting his church to know him amen christ is not he is not standing afar off and seeing who can climb the mountain and get to him he's not he's not seeing who's the the the smartest and who's the most able to dig in and who can put the pieces together no it's his desire to reveal himself to his church god wants to be known he wants to have fellowship he wants to make himself known to you and i amen so god this revelation is his mechanism by which he reveals himself or he makes himself known to his church and we say why did he use revelation because only the elect can receive divine revelation it is the key it is the the way in which that he can make himself known to his church but still be a mystery to the rest of the world that way it can be a secret revelation to the church amen but it can be openly declared but still secretly revealed the ministry of brother branham was openly declared he preached for all who were here amen the messages are still available our services are preached for all who will hear amen the brightest preaching the the the message is going out amen it's for anybody who would want to hear it but the revelation of what's being preached a revelation of what brother branham god is only divinely given to his bride amen so it is the the means by which that he can take amen the word amen and the word can go out in a language with everybody can hear the words that are spoken but there's something else that's being spoken amen amen that's why people can leave the service and you can have such different reports about a church service amen somebody will leave condemned and somebody will leave free somebody will leave having their questions answered and somebody else will leave confused i and everybody you know could sit in the service and understand the language all the words could be clearly spoken amen and all the words could have a clear definition amen but but the revelation is something that god sovereignly gives to his elect and that's his mechanism for making himself known amen he uses preaching of course amen he uses written he uses written language that's what we have the message books in we have it in languages amen for whoever however many languages is translated in we have the bible in english or whatever language that a native speaker would read in but still there's a mysterious element it's not just the words it's the message behind the words so that's why you you can have uh uh like i said you can have meetings but people can walk away from the meetings with such a different uh perspective amen you can listen to a tape but two people can listen to the same message tape and walk away with two different understandings of what the prophet of god was trying to say amen because christ is trying to get we say christ is trying to get the message to his bride but what he's really trying to do is get himself to his bride and the the way he does that is by revelation amen so i want us to just remember that as we we we talked this evening in this sermon that the revelation it's christ's way of making himself known to his church if that's the truth amen which it is but that statement being what it is it makes me crave revelation above everything else amen because we love him this is why intellectual understanding will never compete with divine revelation they're million miles apart amen and it's it's you know it's as far apart as somebody knowing about somebody and having information about another human being and somebody knowing that person like i can know somebody personally and i know the year they were born and i know who their parents were and i can gather all of that by information i could even know what their personality is like i know their favorite food their favorite color we can know all of that in the way of information amen the information can be gathered it can be put on paper it can be put on tape and the information can be shared so that everybody has the same information about this human being amen but that information will never touch the actual contact with that person and knowing them as an individual that's the difference between information and revelation amen brother bram says in the message jehovah jireh then we find that when when seen i'm sorry we find that when seeing that coming little old grandpa like that amalek fell in love with her he's talking about sarah after the body change going to gerrard and went and took her to be his wife think of that see where he turned he turned them back sure he had to the bible the love letter it's something god writes to us he has hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and will reveal it to the babes such as would learn so this bible amen is a love letter amen it's a lot of things to a lot of people amen it's a historical text to some uh it it is uh it is a jewish book partially a christian book partially it can be all kinds of things it can contain traditions it can contain ideas and philosophies this bible can be a lot of things to a lot of people but to me it's a love letter and if it's a if it's a book of history i'll read it differently than if it's a love letter it'll mean something different to me if it's if it is a code of conduct i'll read it differently than if it's a love letter if it's a book of doctrine i'll read it differently then it's a love letter so the way we read the bible is dependent on what how we perceive this book and what its intent is to us if it's instruction amen just instruction for life we'll read it one way amen although it contains history absolutely it contains construction and instruction for life absolutely it contains the structure of the church it contains the the law to the jews it contains the message of grace to the gentiles it has all of those things included all of that's true but that's not what this book is to me all of that to me is a love letter from god to me and when it's a love letter amen then i read it differently than i do if it's a code of conduct or a way in which that we're supposed to subject ourselves to live we would read it with a different frame of mind so when we come to the message the message is christ amen in the message amen is is a love letter to us also and we can take the message and we can do the same thing people do with their bibles we can make it information we can make it doctrine we can make it a code of conduct if i if i see the message as a code of conduct i will read the message with the frame of mind that this is a code of conduct and i will get something different out of it than somebody else who reads in a different frame of mind it's like if i read it as a historical happening amen i will i will get a perspective as a historical happening if i read the message as a as a testimony of the life of a great man then that's what i'll get that's what i'll draw out of that but if the message is christ to me a revelation of jesus christ to me then everything i glean out of that will be different amen because of my revelation of what the message is so that's why i mean you can share message books and message tapes with everybody you can listen to a message and say oh that was so good it spoke to me the next person can listen to and say i had trouble getting anything out of it it depends on what our frame of mind is so god has hid his word amen in such a way that it can be available for all but it's hidden from all except a select group that he'll bring revelation to and don't forget the revelation is god's way of making himself known to his church amen let's go to galatians chapter one now when we say all these things the the message contains within it the record of a man of god it contains within it uh conduct i mean it can contains in it you know uh um instructions for conduct instructions for setting up a church that's all contained in it just like the bible contains all of those things but if that's all the further my revelation goes amen then i will intellectually dive into those things and look for those things amen and that will become all the message is for me no more and what will happen is if i look at it intellectually and i look at it as a code of conduct if i look at it as a structure for the church or or the the record of a great man of god if i look at it with those things only at some point i become frustrated with what i'm looking at because i'm trying amen to intellectually make everything fit and get the pieces and get all the rules and get the conduct and get get everything but but god has done it in such a way that you cannot intellectually make everything fit nicely amen or you can study it somebody else can study the message as a code of conduct amen and two people could be studying the message with the same intent and come with different conclusions because brother ben will say it one way in one place in a different way and another amen because god never wanted us just to take it as a rule book amen it was a love letter to us it was an expression of himself to us so if we take the wrong approach to it i mean we somewhere hit a wall and become frustrated i think sometimes many times this is why people have left the message or become frustrated or found fault amen because they're trying to use it intellectually like a textbook amen and it fails intellectually as a textbook but if you see it as the revelation of jesus christ for us in this day then the textbook part goes out of your mind amen trying to make everything amen fit into a tight package so that we know what we're supposed to do goes out of your mind now it becomes jesus christ revealing himself personally to me and then the message is perfect in that revelation it fits the bill every time it is absolutely beautiful in the revelation of christ to us let's look at galatians chapter one verse 10 for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i never received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ so paul the apostle was not taught the message paul the apostle was given a revelation of jesus christ and that was the gospel that he preached amen we have not been taught christ in this day but we've been given the revelation of jesus christ and that's our gospel paul saw christ paul caught the revelation of jesus christ of the old testament and that revelation opened his eyes to what he had been missing his whole life paul had information but the information was never the same as meeting the person paul knew about the messiah he knew about god he knew about the law he knew he got the details he got i mean the birth date the favorite color the favorite food amen the names of the parents the city he grew up in what his grade point average was in high school you understand in the school of gamalio he had the law he had the text he had all the information amen and it'd be like if somebody is looking for a spouse and all they get was grade point average in high school favorite food favorite color mom and dad's name date of birth city was born in likes and dislikes what sports he played and they say oh i know that person you don't know that person you know facts about that person but when somebody finally comes in contact with that person it doesn't change any of the facts but it changes everything everything changes the information doesn't change but everything changes amen and so many times we are raised amen raised in church raised to be believers raised to be christians and can even be raised in the message and sometimes what we're getting is a lot of information about a person the information is not incorrect there's nothing wrong with the information but you can see how people are having trouble falling in love with information amen but by revelation the information becomes a person and people have no problem falling in love with the person of jesus christ amen so paul was not taught his gospel it was revealed to him when it was revealed to him he went out teaching it but to whoever received it it had to be revealed to him too that's why you cannot read paul like a textbook the schools have tried to read paul as a textbook and they've made a textbook out of the gospels but in in the textbook version of the gospels they have failed completely to miss the person and so the message has brought the person of the word into our midst and the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has been now unfolded in jesus christ then give right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church the bride whispering secrets to her amen when when brother branham comes amen and preaches to us the message he does not have to get a new bible he takes the same bible with all the same record with all the same information amen but he begins to he begins by by the spirit of god amen to bring the information and paint a picture of jesus christ to us amen that the schools have missed and god quickened to us what brother branham was trying to bring to us if we're a child of god quickened it to us and we saw it's not information amen this is not historical this is present tense this is my lord this is jesus christ to me today amen brother brahma says in the god of this evil age he says and notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he came down and offered the fruit of the fruit of the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient every bay but without the revelation of the word cain had sincerity cain had consecration cain had a desire to worship god and a love for god he he was obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word so so cain did a pretty good job as far as taking information and then applying it to worship but he missed something and brother goes on and says and the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right i love that sentence amen let's read it again and god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right so when he received abel's sacrifice and not cain's he he received and he punctuated this sacrifice that he was right amen so he vindicated abel's worship and he rejected cain's worship but what was he vindicating he was vindicating the thing that he revealed so he first revealed it then he vindicated and punctuated that it was right amen where did abel get that abel got it by revelation and when he acted upon revelation god come and received his offering and he vindicated and punctuated that this was right that was wrong cain took it purely intellectual with information knowing that there had to bring a worship we had to bring a sacrifice amen there's time to worship god and he knew all of that and he wanted to in himself to worship god amen but he could not receive the revelation of how god wanted to be worshipped so god could not punctuate his gift he couldn't receive it because it didn't come by revelation oh what a lesson for us we can go through the motions we can follow somebody else's revelation we can do things but god is punctuating what he reveals amen read that again now and god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god amen god revealed to him what that his mother did not take an apple that a snake give to her but she had a sexual affair with the person of satan in the form of beast not a reptile but the most smartest subtlest of the field the image of man the only thing that the seed would mix in so when brother branham tells us that abel offered a sacrifice by revelation it wasn't just god and it wasn't just god saying hey now i need a lamb it was more than that there was a revelation behind the lamb amen he knew why it had to be a lamb he knew why it had to be a substitute he knew why it had to be blood so it wasn't it wasn't when abel received a revelation and brought the right sacrifice his sacrifice vindicated his revelation his revelation was not that god requires a lamb his revelation was that the sin in the beginning was a mixture of blood and now there has to be shedding of blood of an innocent substitute and he took the lamb and when he took the lamb and he offered the lamb upon the altar that that oh that revelation was christ because christ is the substitutionary lamb that was offered for us for our sin for what sin for the sin of being born wrong so when abel caught the revelation of what had gone on and now by that revelation he knew what was acceptable worship to god when he brought the lamb he was actually acting out the word for his day and foreshadowing a future day and this sacrifice became an image of christ so it was christ he was worshiping christ by the revelation of his day that's why when noah received the revelation of an ark of safety amen that the whole world could be saved in this ark that ark was christ so when he built the ark that revelation that he had was christ for his day abel's sacrifice was christ for his day what was he worshiping he was worshipping by the revelation of jesus christ when noah built an ark for a rescue for salvation he was worshiping in the revelation of jesus christ so it's always been the revelation of jesus christ all the way down through time and who has caught that revelation in the hour that is given it was always the elect who caught the revelation and that revelation was always christ for that day it's god's way of getting the love letter and redemption and salvation to his elect and that revelation is always christ so when abel comes to bring his offering this is not uh this is not if i could say it this way this is not reading on a piece of paper you must offer a lamb and then giving a lamb but this is catching something from the mind of god that has to do with why he must make an offering to begin with why he is outside of the garden why he is wearing animal skins to cover his naked see it's so much more than just take a lamin and offer a lamb he's caught by a revelation a divine revelation so much more than slay this lamb he now knows why he's outside of the garden he now knows why he must make a sacrifice he now knows why he's wearing a garment of animal skins cain has no idea why he's outside of the garden why he must bring a sacrifice and why he's wearing a garment of animal skins so in this hour amen the message is not a sea and repeat message amen it is not i see and i do and that brother's right i'll do like him and i'll be right amen it is not that we worship by revelation amen god has revealed to us his plan from before the foundation of the world what was in the back part of god's mind amen before amen that the world was ever created and we're worshiping christ by the revelation of christ in this hour not monkey see monkey do repeat after me this is the form and this is the ritual this is how we do it in the message that is not acceptable to god he's not punctuating that he's punctuating and vindicating what he revealed and when we worship by revelation it's vindicated and punctuated that that's right [Music] amen so we're finding in the hour that we live in the the the repeating after somebody else and repeating somebody else's revelation is not working it's falling apart amen there's been a great falling away and it continues on because people now they were just repeating what they had heard they were walking in an order a form a structure amen but when that order informant structure becomes criticized and is questioned it reveals it rev it reveals that there was no real revelation behind it it was just action amen by order structure or form this is the reason why jesus christ was rejected when he came on earth he was rejected because they had the ritual the structure the form they were repeating what they had read they were doing what they were told to do and they were believing that they were righteous in keeping the form and structure amen but when everything that deformed structure law prophets all were pointing to was standing before them they proved that they had no revelation they only had an ability to keep the system they kept the system going amen feeling like there was righteousness and obedience to the system but when christ was standing there who every sacrifice was pointing to all the law was pointing to they didn't love him they loved their system and we find out that no system is going to work in this day not even a message system will work it has to be by divine revelation god has got to reveal to us why why there's a message why he had to send a prophet why there had to be a restoration to the original word why there had to be a breaking of the seals and why there had to be the seven thunders being interpreted in the last day why why why why god is showing us why because he we we need to know that it's not just i heard i do but it's now i see amen this is jesus christ and this is true worship amen worshiping in spirit and in truth so god's plan from the beginning has always been the word and the word is god and the anointed word for your day is christ and when that revelation would come and was acted out by the believers it was another manifestation of christ abel was bringing a manifestation of christ noah was bringing a manifestation of christ moses as the deliverer was bringing a manifestation of christ and what were they doing they were acting by revelation upon the word of god amen let's go to hebrews chapter 11. hebrews chapter 11 verse 4. by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now think about this abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain it wasn't that there was more value in one than the other as far as material goods keynes could have been actually more costly than abel's it wasn't that was better in appearance it wasn't better in effort it wasn't that it was it was better by revelation because it was the sacrifice that met the season the hour it was a revelation of the word for that day and so his sacrifice was more excellent than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh amen so now god was testifying that this is right and this is wrong god was not saying i don't like fruit i don't like your effort i don't like your all he was not saying that amen he said abel's was a more excellent sacrifice he didn't say this wasn't excellent amen his was more excellent because it was fitting to the hour it was by revelation it was because of his understanding it was because of a revelation that god gave abel that cain could not receive and by the revelation it put him in the action and his action was a vindication of what he believed and when it came that way god vindicated god accepted it and vindicated knowledge that he was righteous because he could receive revelation in the message thirst brother bram says we always say today people try to say we compare we've got to compare bible leaf with bible leave scripture with scripture that isn't the truth i didn't say it brother branham said it that isn't the truth no it isn't the truth the greek word means this and this means that the greeks themselves way back in the nineteenth council and then writers back in there they had different forms one believed this way this greek scholar meant this and the other one said that this one meant it this way and they fussed over it we don't need interpretation of greek scholars or greek words to know him is life the person christ himself amen i want you to catch that phrase to know him as life amen that's that's our part of our opening scripture this is eternal life to know god and to know jesus christ to know him as life the person of christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that god built his church upon and if we don't build upon the same church the bible said abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right this whole thing is built upon the revelation then and unless this is revealed to you jesus said i thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of this world and revealed it to babes such as we'll learn see now the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person so to know him as life brother i'm saying it's not comparing bible leaf with bible leaf in scripture with scripture and original uh context with original god that's not it it comes by a divine revelation amen because everybody's comparing scripture with scripture and coming up with different interpretations of what it means and they one be one will one will be more qualified than the one before have more degrees longer studied whatever amen and they're coming up with different interpretations that's not it but it's to know him as life amen not to know about him but to know him in jehovah jireh he says and the christianity is misrepresented to people all right christianity is misrepresented to people christianity has been represented to people as a declaration of creed christianity is a living being jesus christ the resurrected god that's alive and among us now christianity is a person not a creed to know him is life not even know his word that isn't life know him and he is the word oh get what he said amen to know him his life not even know his word i know this bible but do you know the person of the bible do you know who the bible is written about do you know who the bible is written for amen or do you just know the the print on paper or do you know who who this is all about amen he said to know him his life not even know his word that isn't life to know him and he is the word i thought it said not to know the word but he is the word so we have to know the word you have to know the person of the word not the letter of the word you can know the letter of the word and miss the person of the word you can know the statistics you can know the profile but to know a person is different to know uh to know about a person and to know a person are light years apart we can know we can take all kinds of people from history george washington and abraham lincoln and we could have volumes written about them in biography upon biography and we can know all about them but to know them is different than know about them how firm was abraham lincoln's handshake how was george washington's voice what was his spirit like when you were in his presence did of a calm way or did he have a nervous way about him did he make you feel welcome or did he put you on edge was he gentle with his touch in general with his demeanor was he harsh amen we know all about george washington if you live in america and you had to study in school you know all about george washington but you don't know him his wife knew him his children knew him his friends knew him but you didn't know him and that's why to read historical jesus christ amen is not knowing him to read about him walking by the sea of galilee about him breaking the fish in the load about him telling them to cast their net on the other side that is not knowing him that is knowing about him and most people are content knowing about him most of christianity they know about him amen but god doesn't want us to know about him he wants us to know him amen the message didn't come to know about him the message came to know him personally the person of the word the person that walked the sea of galilee the person that cried unto peter cast dinette on the other side that same person wants to reveal himself to you and i he wants to be known personally intimately he wants to be felt he wants you to know him and to know him as life see the denominations teach to know about him is life that right if you know all that he did and where he was and the sacrifice that he made do you know about him that's life but not knowing about him but knowing him and if i know him then i have the one who said casternet on the other side i have that here the one amen who cried out in gethsemane and surrendered his will to the father he's here the one that hung on calvary and bled and died for my sins and the sins of the world the one who paid the price of my redemption he's here amen to know him now is to know the same one that was there but but we can just show historical god and say no about him amen but if you refuse him amen how do you get him who died on calvary you receive him today he's the person of the word the message of the hour it's christ he's here to reveal himself to a people and he wants to be known amen it's more than doctrines it's more than creeds it's a person it's a life we we can make the message so many different things we can make it a camp an idea a philosophy we can make it a personal mechanism for whatever accolades and praise we could make the message a place to hide but that's not what it was given for that's not why it's coming this hour it's come so that we can know him and to know him is life i want to know him personally i want to know if i could just say it this way i want to know not just about him but i want to know how soft his touch is i want to know how he deals person to person i want to know when he when he comes to me in prayer and he comforts me when i'm nervous i don't want to just know about him i want to know him i want to know the living god amen see the jews they had the same opportunity you and i have how many believe jesus is here the person of the word is the son of man he's here well the jews had the same opportunity you and i have they were there in the day of his coming he come as the son of man he was there embodied in a single body of flesh and he was there among them amen and they knew about him but when he presented himself they didn't want to know him they wanted to keep knowing about him and they loved knowing about him but couldn't know that they didn't want to know him they had no desire for him they only had desire for the information about him they loved isaiah's prophecy but they didn't love the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy so they were embracing isaiah's prophecy and loving the prophecy but when the fulfillment of the prophecy came and they were to embrace it they didn't want to embrace the fulfillment they wanted to stay amen with the prophecy amen amen and so jesus was constantly in turmoil with the religious leaders and the pharisees because not only did they not want to embrace him they didn't want anybody else to embrace him either they didn't want to know him and they didn't want anybody else to know him they wanted to hold everybody into a historical understanding of jesus christ because the historical understanding kept them in power made them needed they were needed they were the authorities they were the ones with the understanding they were the ones teaching they were the ones giving out the information they were the ones reading the stats he's five foot six 130 pounds they're giving out the statistics but there's the person they said stay away from him i'll keep giving you statistics yes see the message can be about statistics it could be about information but that's not why it came it came to introduce us to the person let's look at matthew 23 i just want to look at some of this dialogue with jesus christ and the pharisees matthew 23 and 23 in matthew 23 23 he says now woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites if you pay tithe of men and anise and and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith and these oughts you have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within they are full of extortions in excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes pharisees hypocrites for you are like unto white sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness they have the appearance of keeping all the word amen they looked like they were keepers of the word they looked like they were lovers of the word and they kept the order they paid tithes of mint and cumin and all of these things they were doing outward works we know that he admonished them because he rebuked them because you know they were blowing a trumpet when they come to pay money into the offering so that all would see and we know all of these they had all the form and all the structure of loving god remember when it really come down to the person himself made flesh they didn't love him they just loved the order and the structure because the order and the structure gave them a position gave them security gave them something and he says you know the law you understand the law as far as pay your tithe give an offering dress right don't don't do this and do that you know the law but you've missed the real heart of it or he said the the weightier matters of the law which is judgment mercy and faith you missed you missed the deeper meaning you got the outside form and then all that became important was the outside form amen but the old testament wasn't written to give an outside form it was to give an understanding of god and so that when he would come we would see this matches that amen the character i find in the law is the character i find in jesus christ because the law contained judgment and mercy and faith but that wasn't important to them anymore what was important is all the outside form and the structure not the deeper not the character of the word what became important was the outside visual of the word but not the character of the word i wanna i wanna say i don't wanna fall into this trap again to where we can go and look at everything the prophet gave us and see it as another structure women dress this way men conduct themselves this way structure your church this way have your services there's a length of time the order of the service dress this way look this way do all of these things and get the outward things all right and think we're safe because we're message believers but there was a deeper meaning to all of that amen and none of that is wrong jesus says you ought not to have forsaken those but done these two he didn't say you wasted all your time and paying your tithe and giving offering and dressing right and doing no he says you left the weightier matters of the law amen you didn't get to the heart of the matter that was the real character and nature of god you've got all the outside form and structure because the outside form and structure is all that mattered to you that's why you can have individuals that can dress right go to church right read the message and they're miserable people they're hateful they're critical judgmental can't get along with others but they dress right they go to church every time the doors are open they're there 30 minutes early they never miss paying their tithes because man wants a structure man wants a form but god's trying to give himself and sometimes instead of getting him we get the structure amen we don't the structure structure's perfect there's nothing wrong with the structure if you get him you want the structure too amen you want everything that he is amen but the whole point was to get him and if you don't get him you've missed it all right these pharisees these scribes they had all of the law they had it into detail but they missed him so i asked what was the point of all their study what was the point of their tithe paying what was the point of their loud prayers on the street corner what was the point of the years at school and the years of sacrificial labor and wearing all the right clothes it all come to not at the end because they didn't want the person of the word they just wanted the form and structure of the word amen god didn't come in this last day to give us another form of structure he come to give us himself and he wants a people that loves him and if we love him we love everything about him we love him we love coming to church early and preparing ourselves for the word not as a form but as love we love him we love dressing ourselves in a way that pleases him because we love him not the structure of the form but we get him and we get him we know him we know what he likes we know why the prophet said these things because we know the person of the word we know this is his character we know this is what he likes this is this is how he would dress himself in this body of life so i do it because i understand who it is that i'm worshiping and so my worship amen becomes a reflection of my faith hallelujah let's go to matthew 15. verse 1 then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do you also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition for god commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but you say whosoever shall say his father is mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother he shall be free what he's saying here is is there's a commandment in the law to honor your father and your mother but if the money that you would give them to help support them you give it as an offering to god the the priest and the pharisees and the scribes they were teaching that you're free you no longer have to honor your father and your mother because you did something better you gave it to the treasury that's what this is saying and jesus is condemning them for that kind of thinking because what that kind of thinking does is promoting the system but missing the very character of god god said honor your father and your mother why it matches his character to honor amen those that you come from honor mother and father i honor the weak or honor those in need but the pharisees and sadducees scribes they they had changed it to now if you give that as a gift to god then you're free you no longer have to help support your parents you can see how all the sudden keeping a structure or a form can become evil because now god gave a commandment to to honor your father and your mother amen because god has character amen and god through the law was displaying his character and he says honor father and mother they had this form they so loved the form and ritual of worship that they said you can forsake your father and mother if you support the form and the ritual and let them suffer and jesus condemned them for that they were trying to condemn them because his disciples didn't keep the tradition he condemned them because they didn't even keep the commandment see they caught if i could say this way they caught a rule but they missed the mind of god they caught a a a a rule or an order but they missed the person of the word they couldn't see his nature in the commandment all they could see was if we keep this form we're safe this is god this kind of worship he goes on to say let's read verse 6 again in honor not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have you made the commandment of god of none effect by your traditions ye hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so isaiah had said they honor me with their lips amen but their heart is far from me so what did god care about most the honor with the lips or the heart did he care about the form of structure the outward paying of tithes or did he care about the heart amen what you were on the inside and what you believed amen let's go to micah chapter 6. i want to read just a couple places in the old testament in micah chapter 6 verse 6. wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he hath showed thee o man what is good and what and what dot the lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god you know when when saul had his own idea about worship amen and samuel had given him instructions from the lord not to keep anything alive of the amalekites and he kept you know so many good choice things choice animals and all of this and he was going to offer it as a sacrifice when samuel came to rebuke him amen he acted like he was doing a good thing because what he was doing was for the people to see and he had saved the choices and he was making an offering and this was all for god and god says it's not for me at all because what i told you was what i wanted and i wanted you to slay it all but you saved it back for yourself and not for me he said do i have delight and sacrifice amen is that what i want amen but obedience is better than sacrifice what god wanted to show love is just to catch the mind of god the instruction of god and to obey that not to come up with some idea of our own amen so here he's telling him does it will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams can we i mean can we do really really good and god be pleased no what god really wants amen more than anything is to do justly to love mercy and walk humbly with thy god what what what does that mean he wants you to catch his very character his very nature amen not just okay thousands of ram god god called for animal sacrifices let's give thousands of animal sacrifices but if you don't walk humbly if you don't have a just heart if you don't love mercy if you don't have faith what point is thousands of rams what god wanted was you to catch his heart and catch his nature to catch his person and to emulate that amen the the the law was a school master to bring us to christ so that we could see the nature of god and how perfect it was and see the shortcomings that we had in ourselves so that we could come to christ amen for grace to cover those things but not to forget the very nature of god in the law so they got the form but they missed the nature and he's saying that's not what i want but i want you to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly if i can put in my own words i want you to catch my nature and i want you to be like me this is what i want i want you to want me proverbs 21 says proverbs 21 3 to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice but god told us to give sacrifice death there's nothing wrong with the sacrifice god told to give sacrifice but he says to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice because if you do the sacrifice and don't emulate god and your character and his nature then the sacrifice doesn't do any good this is what the jews proved they had mastered the law they had mastered the order they had even added to it they got so good at god's order and god structure they could add to god's order and to god's structure but they missed the person they missed the nature of god they missed who he was they got the law but they missed the law giver brother brahm says in christ the mystery of god revealed but when christ takes takes you over he'll express that word right through you because it's him he is the word and then you can see the expression of christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful amen in the message there's two quotes that i want to read and they were preached as three days apart one's 1961 they're both in 61. the first one is the god had explained and i want to read these two quotes together and then talk about them so now i said to brother schism and brother ness to answer your question i said now i do not take either side with you brethren i know as long as you fuss you're both wrong because i would rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart see i said after all it's your heart's condition amen it goes on to say three days later and the message getting in the spirit says you've got to come back and we got to be one i don't care if the man's wrong if he's wrong and sincere in his heart and you're right in your belief and wrong in the acting the way you're acting i'd rather be in his place than in yours praise god whose place would you rather be in simon who invited jesus but gave him no welcome or the prostitute who washed his feet read this again you've got to come back we've got to be one i don't care if the man's wrong if he's wrong and sincere in his heart and you're right in your belief and you're wrong and acting the way you're acting i'd rather be in his place than be in yours that's right i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart god will respect it more so if a man is wrong what of it help him he needs help love him well the man is not saying you don't need doctrine that's not what he's saying but he said if i had my brothers i'd rather be right in my heart my heart right with god because correcting doctrine is easy as a revelation for god it's a snap of a finger god can give revelation whenever he wants and clear that thing up amen but if your heart's wrong your heart's wrong amen what can god do but with the right heart god can always bring more revelation and what god would rather have is he would rather have us amen with the right heart connected to him heart to heart he can fix all the wrong understanding amen and if we think that right now we're sitting here in this room all of us together and we all have the exact right understanding on everything in the message i believe we're we're self-deceived i believe there's more understanding to come how can you say that brother chad because i can turn around and look five years back and say there were some things i had a wrong understanding on but by the grace of god i believed my heart was right and when my heart was right god kept unfolding himself more and more and more so right now what i want more than anything is i want him i want the person of the word i want him who's revealing himself revelation by revelation i'm not interested in just getting doctrines right because i can get doctrines right and if i'm wrong in my heart what good is having doctrines right [Applause] now listen you're talking to somebody i'm i'm speaking to somebody i love to have doctrines right so for me to say this is a big statement amen i'm not flippant about doctrines i love the teaching of the message i love when it lines up i love when it's right i love when you can see it amen but but for me if i can even have wrong understanding and something out of the message but if my heart is right god can correct my understanding but if my heart is wrong before god where am i at who will help me see the the the pharisees were right in their doctrine and that's somewhat debatable but they were wrong in their hearts but the woman in samaria she had a heart desire to know god she was a woman who wasn't scholar didn't have scholarships didn't have a position she wasn't upholding a system though she was part of a system she wanted the messiah and she wanted to know how to worship the pharisees didn't want anything but further validation and vindication of their own self-righteousness they wanted to keep the system going because the system was telling them they were right and so anything that would threaten the system they hated because the system was bringing security the system was telling them they were righteous amen because they could keep the system and keep the rules and keep the order amen and even adjust the order to suit them so they could look even better but this little woman in samaria she couldn't keep the order she couldn't keep everything right amen but inside of her there was something down on the inside that wanted the messiah and wanted to worship god and wanted to know what god wanted the pharisees were only looking into the word they were looking into the word for more self-indication but this woman was looking at the word wanting to know god and when god came on the scene the same jesus christ and flesh came to her as was speaking to the pharisees and the sadducees and the scribes and the elders and the high priest they were all calling him beelzebub she was seeing something different because they didn't care to have the messiah they only cared to have their structure but she wanted something she wanted the god who gave the law amen and when god presented himself to her she caught something and she said i perceive you're a prophet and when she said i perceive you're a prophet she didn't do like herod did do a trick show me something do a miracle she says our fathers say in this mountain we must worship but you say in jerusalem what does she want to know she want to know how does god want to be worshiped that little woman wanted to know the same thing abel wanted to know that little woman wanted to know what she was waiting on what abel was waiting on and when she caught it she caught it like abel caught it amen and what do you and i want i hope by the grace of god we want the same thing that woman wanted and what abel wanted i want to know how to please god i want to know what god wants i want to know how to love him back not how to love myself not how to look good in the eyes i want to know how to love him back i want my worship to reflect my revelation of who he is and who's here and what's going on in this hour do i want to dress right yes not so others will know that i'm right because i love him and i want to know what is in his mind and i want to act out what is in his mind not for an order or a structure but out of love and so now brother branham says these things i'd rather be right in my heart and wrong in my doctrine a man can be complete completely wrong in his doctrine amen but have the right heart you can be right in your doctrine amen but wrong in the way you're acting and i'd rather be in that man's shoes brother branham says in the marriage of the lamb now remember the first thing that we read at the beginning tonight was that revelation is christ's way of making himself known to his church amen the question is do you want to know him or do we want to know about him we can come to church and know about him it's possible it's possible and it it it doesn't matter what church good church excellent church right teaching but we can go with the attitude to know about him amen but i want to know him because to know him is life in the marriage of the lamb the prophet of god says i believe in the baptism of the holy ghost i believe in speaking in tongues but i think we lay too much emphasis on that a man can speak with tongues and a woman speak with tongues and if her life and his life doesn't compare with what tongues you're speaking in then it's the wrong tongue because the holy spirit will make you act like the bible it'll bring you to the fullness of the stature of christ you take a person that speaks with tongues enough temper to fight a buzzsaw and talk about the neighbors and everything like that why you you call that the holy ghost it cannot be no sir the holy ghost is meekness joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience faith the holy ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the holy spirit bears in the church of the living god sweetness humbleness humility love one for another long suffering i mean not just the outside acts but the inward life back in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says because it just gradually let loose as it as it did down through the prophets and so forth till it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in christ and now the christ in the church is just being made known before the old testament it was gradually let out the revelation the revelation the revelation until it come to the fullness that god had bodily in christ but now christ in the church is being now the revelation is the person of the word he himself here amen in the church the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and god is the husband of the church in the church is his bride now god is bringing a revelation but the revelation that he's bringing is christ in you the hope of glory amen and that christ in you is not information it is not a doctrine it is not a teaching it is a life it is not paying tithe it's being united with melchizedek the receiver of dies it's more than just the structure amen it's more than just the form it's the person amen so he goes on to say now peter when he called said thou art christ the son of the living god now watch blessed art thou simon barjona says which means son of jonah blessed art thou for flesh and blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from some school but my father which is in heaven hath revealed it to you notice what he saith them upon this rock that's peter the predestinated seed of god that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who jesus christ is he is the full manifested god upon this rock not a father son and holy ghost and him being the second person upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never shake it down never prevail against it i'll build my church upon this rock a revelation of jesus christ look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do he's trying to bring the revelation of the mystery but the revelation of the mystery is in you the revelation of the mystery is not on a tape that's the information the information we can be quickened to revelation but the revelation is a life inside of you the message amen the message is not just print on paper or a voice on a tape amen that's the means by which god preached the message amen but the message must become a revelation and that revelation must transpire into a life and that life must live out of you the message is not just what was preached the message now is the life of jesus christ in a mini-member body and it's not a structure or a form you can have the form and it can be an empty house but that's not the message the message is not the form of structure of a church and the structure of a message and saying we're a message church because we you know we don't women don't cut our hair we have long dresses we we we talk about brother branham we recognize him as a prophet amen that that doesn't make us a message church amen what makes us a message church is the message christ himself the son of man alive inside the people that makes it a message church so it's not about going back to a pharisee form a religion or denomination amen to have a structure and the structure set up right therefore this is the message that is not the message that can be a messy structure but that's not the message the message is christ in you the hope of glory it must be more than the law it must be the character that was contained in the law can we give thousands of sacrificed rams and rivers of oil no just do justly and have mercy and walk meekly and humbly before your god just have the life amen if you have the life will you offer the appropriate sacrifice without a doubt but it can't be an empty form it's got to be a life he said christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing christ in the bible makes christ a revelation of the bible christ in you makes you the revelation of the whole thing it brings us all the way back to genesis because brother bam said the seventh seal was revealed all the way back in the beginning in genesis when god was making his masterpiece and he first made the setting for the masterpiece and that first part of that masterpiece came up but we know he was making a masterpiece family the first part came up adam but within adam was the second part of the masterpiece and it was broke out and formed and united back together and god said it is very good what was that when those two you united back together amen the masterpiece was complete when the masterpiece was complete it was finished what was it it was the revelation of the whole thing adam was the revelation of a son of god but within within adam was another revelation within adam was a revelation of the wife and the two come back together to make the perfect masterpiece family and that became the revelation of the whole thing christ in the bible makes the bible the revelation of christ christ in you the bridegroom and the bride united back together makes it the revelation of the whole thing back to the mind of god what god wanted in the very beginning he wanted male and female expression together as one he goes on to say what is the new birth then well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ and you that is the revelation that the church was built upon he says in the church age book in the revelation of jesus christ he said how we need revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and i'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven you see revelation is christ's way of of giving himself revealing himself to his church but he says oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it by what by the revelation what will the revelation produce become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven we cannot do the greater works and glorify god without revelation it must be the revelation of jesus christ personally to each one of us back again in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says but the revelation came through the blood see and through jesus christ who is the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today is is only the only way you could know him not say i'm methodist that means nothing i'm baptist that means nothing i'm catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word in the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses himself through you do you know the revelation because the revelation takes over how do you know it's a revelation of christ revealed to you personally because that revelation takes over and starts living his life through me now it's not the form or the structure but it's something deeper now it's not the outward form of keeping a rule or keeping an order or being obedient but now there's something inside a life on the inside by the revelation of jesus christ now pushing out the very life of jesus christ and when it pushes out the life we'll keep the same form the same structure the same dress the same church order the same all of that but now it's not a shell hiding emptiness but it's a life on the inside coming up and manifesting the life on the outside there are there are two things amen there's the form of the message and then there's the life of the message the life of the message will manifest the same form but the form of the message can never produce the life we we have to be careful that we're not just teaching form but that we're sticking with the revelation of the word that god can quicken a revelation to somebody because we can keep form but if we keep form all we're going to do is make the deacons really busy and the minister's trying to keep everybody informed because we want to be a message church we want to be message believers and to be a message believer we dress this way we don't go here we don't watch this we don't but that's not what we want friends that's nothing i have no desire to have anything anything to do with any of that what i want to do is preach jesus christ amen and he himself can make a revelation in the hearts of every believer and out of the heart can bloom the life of jesus christ and the life of jesus christ will dress right won't go to those places won't watch those things won't look at these things won't listen to that it's christ amen living his own life through you and i it's not a form or a structure it's a living word it's a living god we become living epistles [Music] to me that's the message that's the purpose of revelation amen to make himself known he makes himself known to us but then through us he makes himself known to the world that's what the bride is to be in this last days i brother ben said in no way he uh brother marcus he he quoted this out of the resume of the ages not for one moment do i try to preach a message amen to start a church or to have people look to me brother branham wasn't interested in another system but he said i have one purpose one goal and that's to get people into a personal relationship with jesus christ i say as a people as a church as a congregation of believers let's make that our main purpose is to get people in a personal relationship with jesus christ to preach the word to live the word to speak the word but not in a way to make another system to make another denomination to make another structure and if we all stick in this structure we're all okay the structure can never produce the life but the life will always always produce itself in a life a form i want to say god give me the deeper meaning of the word i don't want to be like cain and no i got to bring a sacrifice and i'm going to sacrifice i want to do a good job i want to make it nice i want to be acceptable to god through my sacrifice that wasn't able's motive cain's motive was to be accepted to do good job to look the part to do to do it thoroughly to be accepted but abel wanted to know what does god want and i want to say it's not about it's not about all the other things those come naturally but it's about in christ making himself known this message came to go deep inside the heart of the believer and to awaken a seed on the inside and bring the life of christ out it didn't come to make good church members but i'll tell you something if that seed ever comes alive you're going to have a good church member you're going to have a wonderful part of the body active and supportive and doing all the things that need to be done amen but it'll come from the life of jesus christ when christ reveals himself to somebody say when we study the message let's study it with all of our hearts but now let's not study it to have a structure let's study it to find him let's read it to find him let's listen to it to find him amen when we go to pray amen let's not pray just to have god fix this bless this make this better but let's find him in prayer let's study to find him let's listen to find him let's come to church to find him and to find what pleases him and to surrender our life to him god bless you friends let's just have him let's all stand tonight musicians if you come i'm going to read one more scripture to you to close out of first corinthians 13 10 you don't have to turn there i'll just read it to you but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away brother brandon read that portion of scripture and said but what we do have by god's grace today is the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication so that's the context i want to read the scripture in when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when you become a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known when when that which is perfect has come and what we do have today by god's grace is the divine the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication and when i look into that when it's perfect i'm no longer looking into a mere darkly but i'm looking as face to face and that i shall know even as i am known god wants us to know he sent his word so that we will look and we will see him and when we see him we will see us and we will see us in him and him in us this is far beyond a system an order a doctrine a teaching this is a million light years deeper than a doctrine or a study or a form or a structure this is us looking into the perfect interpretation of the word and seeing him and seeing us and him and him and us in that day that's this day you will know that i am you and you and me friends this is the day that he reveals himself to his bride to come into his bride to live his life through his bride the systems are dead let's not start a new one the forms and rituals and structures of religion they're over with let's not start another one let's not look for security from a group from a structure from an order or from keeping rules but let's look for a divine revelation that comes from the father that lets us know what day we're in and how he wants to be worshiped and let's yield ourselves to him and let him live his life through us for that's the manifestation of this hour amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the word you've given us god lord it's so much more than we ever dreamed so much more than we ever knew it becomes more and more all the time lord and the more we look into your perfect image lord the more we want to be like you the more we see of your character and your nature the more we want to emulate that lord but we have no strength in and of ourselves we have no ability in our own persons but it has to be you and us lord and as you continue to take the veil off of yourself and we see you lord you continue to drop the scales from our eyes and let us see you as you are lord we want to become into the image that we're beholding we want to become more like you lord i pray you would take us far beyond instrumentalities of man and governments and rules but lord bring us into a very life lord your very life bring it into us god if there's anybody here lord who has been in a form and a structure they've been raised this way or come into a structure and honored it lord and and loved it but never went deeper god i pray that you would reveal yourself to them personally lord that had become more than just a terminology become more than a set of doctrines or rules god may it be person contacting person may it be lord that you're yourself lord revealing yourself deep into the heart of your children lord may it be a a connection lord that goes beyond time lord that goes beyond the physical elements but a connection that started before time lord reconnecting again and i pray lord to bring a life lord like nothing else can bring lord there's nothing else that can bring this life but your life itself i pray god that you would make it manifest within us god live your life through us as individuals and may we bring glory and honor to your name lord may we open ourselves to you in a greater way may your word lord have preeminence in a greater way and lord would you reveal yourself to us more clearly than ever before revelation upon revelation take us higher and higher take us out of our own forms and our own ideas and far beyond our our own uh concepts lord and bring us into the very reality of your word may it live in us may we live in you i ask you bless your people lord bring quickening power to quicken all these things into a manifestation for this is the hour we know it lord but it's got to be you doing the work so now we just yield ourselves to you and ask that you would come manifest yourself afresh
