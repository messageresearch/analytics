[20:00] so uh but uh Chad decided to help us
[20:04] and he
[20:07] gave us like six months of friend
[20:12] yeah six months of rent so all the money
[20:16] we collected just you know
[20:18] accumulate a little bit so we can buy
[20:21] other things so it was so helpful
[20:26] uh the church was empty no chairs no
[20:29] Pulpit no platform uh we got some
[20:35] um
[20:36] what is sound system from BCF uh we we
[20:41] also got the organ that was at brother
[20:43] Steve Steve golden
[20:47] yeah yeah yeah that organ it was not
[20:49] easy to transport it
[20:51] I I I
[20:53] rented a small truck and it was my
[20:57] brother Steve and his family were just
[21:00] you know it was not easy but they helped
[21:03] me to get it there and
[21:05] and uh
[21:07] but a Franco has been working with
[21:11] people over there remotely
[21:14] did a great job
[21:16] um so people have been contributing and
[21:20] one-way all the other even just to help
[21:23] me find where
[21:25] to rent where to find the church a place
[21:29] for the church to rent

[22:45] William said
[22:48] and James they take care of those
[22:52] equipment they work with brother Franco
[22:54] one day we had an issue we did not know
[22:57] how to solve I say to him or feel free
[23:01] to contact Brother Franco I already did
[23:07] uh yeah the organ is being used actually
[23:11] the very first day we use the organ it
[23:14] was a visitor from Erie who played it
[23:17] sister liner came to visit us the very
[23:21] first day we moved to the cranberry Town
[23:23] location
[23:26] ah you must know this man
[23:30] here I think he's leading a song of
[23:33] something and he's been helping the
[23:36] young people and actually today as I'm
[23:38] here is is taking the service over there
[23:42] yeah
[23:44] it's been a great help
[23:47] you probably know this one too
[23:51] as Priscilla she's being helping with
[23:54] the music and the Sunday School
[23:58] all right there she is
[24:02] all right the church is pretty small
[24:05] but we always have often have visitors
[24:11] always the visitors coming out of
[24:14] state
[24:16] in area churches
[24:20] so we always have people people are
[24:23] hungry and thirsty
[24:25] they're looking for the word amen and
[24:29] God just used the tools that he has at
[24:32] his disposition and that's what it is
[24:35] it's not a human being it's just God
[24:38] doing that we had people coming from
[24:43] of course Pittsburgh because we are in a
[24:46] cranberry town
[24:47] we have people coming from Erie visiting
[24:51] us people come from uh oh this one
[24:55] didn't come out right coming from Butler
[24:59] people coming from Whole Supple
[25:03] something like that one hour 30 minutes
[25:07] Eerie one hour 30 minutes out of town
[25:10] they just they come and they enjoy they
[25:14] enjoy the world what what we take as
[25:16] granted they enjoy it amen so um
[25:22] yeah we have been blessed by these
[25:24] people they come they really encourage
[25:27] us to continue
[25:30] amen amen
[25:32] same thing here
[25:34] this is the special
[25:36] very good in Swahili uh
[25:42] yeah this is a church song can you see
[25:47] it clear it was not done professionally
[25:53] uh you may recall this man
[25:57] but Emmanuel came and took a service for
[26:00] us um
[26:01] a couple weeks ago it was wow I I
[26:05] listened to it after I came back say wow
[26:08] I never seen things that way I got good
[26:12] feedback
[26:14] um so as I say we had people coming they
[26:17] don't know if there is a church this
[26:20] couple is from Nepal so they originally
[26:24] from Nepal they live in Pittsburgh the
[26:27] brother had another brother maybe
[26:29] listening or watching
[26:32] sermons at BCF and realize maybe that
[26:36] I'm going to Pittsburgh call his brother
[26:39] his brother has been looking for a
[26:41] church
[26:42] foreign
[26:45] [Music]
[26:50] they come to church one day some people
[26:54] from maybe Wisconsin from Nepal to um
[26:58] they came to visit him and they're
[27:00] sitting in a church I'm preaching but
[27:02] you see when you have new people coming
[27:05] you want to be a little evangelist but
[27:09] I'm just going with the Revelation and
[27:12] who are they they don't know the word
[27:15] after the service they were like oh we
[27:18] were blessed oh it was refreshing to be
[27:21] in a church again something like that so
[27:24] there were Believers that all over the
[27:27] place some don't have a church to go to
[27:30] and you know you know continue praying
[27:34] because maybe we are in our last minutes
[27:38] and this Earth
[27:40] so whatever God wants to do let him do
[27:43] it yes absolutely hunger and thirst
[27:47] everywhere ended and it is a battle it's
[27:51] uh it's not like it's not a picnic but
[27:54] I'm saying it's a real battle so but the
[27:58] load is taking care of his word and
[28:01] that's what matters amen
[28:05] so we had this brother from uh battler
[28:09] brother Nathan uh he joined the church
[28:12] actually and yeah
[28:16] recently I told him brother
[28:18] um uh you can you take some services to
[28:22] be lead the song service
[28:24] they say uh I'm not a good singer but I
[28:27] think I sing for my children wow that's
[28:30] qualified him already there
[28:34] yeah yeah we uh
[28:37] well we we don't we don't have to count
[28:41] on our abilities
[28:42] if God give us gifts and things like
[28:45] that yeah we can use them
[28:47] but it's not about that it is God is
[28:50] looking for an empty vessel that he can
[28:54] use a person with good disposition
[28:57] and I say brother
[29:00] yeah he's qualified to do it so here he
[29:04] is and uh
[29:06] yeah
[29:08] That's how little uh story there
[29:12] but um just to remember to pray for us
[29:16] uh keep us in a prayer thank you once
[29:20] again for
[29:21] your support
[29:23] and
[29:26] yeah that's it
[29:28] so we ask for your prayers
[29:31] this work
[29:33] is challenging and rewarding in the same
[29:37] time because we working for the master
[29:40] for the king himself
[29:43] um it's good that God is watching over
[29:46] his own word and he encourage us as the
[29:50] ministers by your prayers you know
[29:54] by you telling us that you who you like
[29:58] to hear us when you tell your pastor
[30:01] that you send him a little card it
[30:04] encourage him because he can take that
[30:06] card and show the devil you were saying
[30:09] I'm this look look what people feel
[30:13] so uh
[30:15] and uh and God is giving us the
[30:18] stimulation of the revelation
[30:21] without that we cannot keep going
[30:23] because sometimes you don't know maybe I
[30:26] cannot keep going
[30:28] but it is just show you I'm in control
[30:31] you see you see you see and that help us
[30:35] so
[30:36] pray for us
[30:38] and it's good to be back in the house of
[30:42] the Lord
[30:43] it's good to be back among you
[30:46] and I always watch all your services
[30:48] don't think
[30:50] Wednesday I am with you
[30:53] every time so
[30:55] God bless you let's stand up and go
[30:59] straight to the word of God
[31:02] um
[31:03] after a while in the mission field
[31:07] I can only preach like I preach in the
[31:10] missions
[31:11] all right so you kind of have to bear
[31:15] with me right okay so
[31:19] Matthew chapter 22.
[31:30] Matthew chapter 22
[31:42] this is an intriguing parable
[31:45] simple
[31:47] or complicated
[31:52] if you are very little like I used to be
[31:56] Matthew 22 1.
[31:59] and Jesus answered and spoke unto them
[32:02] again by Parables and says and said the
[32:07] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain
[32:09] King which made a marriage for his son
[32:12] and sent forth his servants to call them
[32:17] that were
[32:19] beaten to the wedding and they they
[32:22] would not come
[32:24] again he sent forth other servants
[32:26] saying tell them which are bad Biden
[32:30] Biden behold I have prepare my dinner my
[32:34] accent and my fatalings are killed in
[32:37] all things are ready come unto the
[32:41] marriage but they made a light of it and
[32:45] went their ways one to his farm another
[32:49] to his
[32:50] merchandise and the remnant took his
[32:55] servant and and tricked and then
[32:59] spitefully and slew them
[33:02] but when the king heard thereof it was
[33:06] rough and he sent forth his armies and
[33:09] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[33:12] uh their City
[33:14] then saith he to his servants the
[33:18] wedding is ready but the day which were
[33:21] Biden were not worthy
[33:24] go ye therefore into the highways and as
[33:28] many as he shall find bit to the
[33:32] marriage
[33:34] so those servants went out into the
[33:37] highways and gathered together all as
[33:40] many as they found both bad and good and
[33:44] the wedding was furnished with guests
[33:47] and when the king came in to see the
[33:51] guests is so there was there there a man
[33:54] which had not not a on a wedding garment
[33:58] and he saith unto him friend how cometh
[34:02] thou in
[34:04] not having a wedding garment and he was
[34:08] speechless
[34:10] then say said the king to the servants
[34:15] find him a hand and foot and take him
[34:18] away and cast him into outer Darkness
[34:22] there shall be whipping and gnashing of
[34:25] teeth
[34:26] for many are called but few are chosen
[34:30] let's pray one more time
[34:32] Heavenly Father we can read
[34:35] because we went to school we can even
[34:38] understand intellectually the word we
[34:41] will invite your presence your
[34:42] inspiration to speak to your children in
[34:46] Jesus Christ's name we prayed amen you
[34:49] may take your seat
[34:58] so if if a few times
[35:06] was asked this
[35:09] question a question regarding this
[35:12] Parable and
[35:14] I don't know how old I was every time he
[35:17] answered that question I was left like
[35:20] why did not answer
[35:23] I want him to answer it
[35:26] and I was very little I wanted him to
[35:30] tell me
[35:31] that a man can go in heaven have a body
[35:35] change
[35:37] go to the wedding supper
[35:40] and they're not found with a clothes and
[35:44] thrown out of heaven
[35:47] so how can that happen
[35:49] did he really go to heaven did he really
[35:53] was thrown out of Heaven do I want him
[35:57] to answer clearly
[36:00] and he was answering I was not listening
[36:04] hmm
[36:05] and sometime it happened to us God can
[36:08] speak to us but we don't listen right
[36:10] and one day I kept asking God for one
[36:13] thing for years and the ears keep asking
[36:17] the same thing the same thing then I say
[36:20] wait a minute
[36:22] let me stop here let me ask him maybe
[36:26] Lord you have already answered me but
[36:30] I'm not able to hear you now help me
[36:34] maybe lower yourself to my level please
[36:38] amen speak to me like a baby or you know
[36:41] help me to understand what you are
[36:45] saying
[36:46] so Brothers has been all the time
[36:49] answering that question but he did not
[36:53] ring I he did not match my understanding
[36:58] so here is like in this message cruelty
[37:02] of sin and the penalty that it cost to
[37:06] read uh Sin from our lives he said then
[37:09] when he came in and he found one man now
[37:13] and now there is only one door to come
[37:17] through because there is where there is
[37:20] where the Garment was given out and he
[37:24] found a man at the supper table without
[37:26] the Garment on he said friend what's do
[37:31] uh what are you doing here uh why aren't
[37:34] you got a garment on and the man was
[37:38] speechless he came in by a window some
[37:43] other way he didn't come by the door
[37:46] amen and every man that comes by Christ
[37:50] into the body of Christ who received the
[37:53] Holy Spirit The Robe he is sending right
[37:57] there to put it on you just as you come
[38:01] in see that's what he has promised and
[38:04] that's what he does so brother Venom is
[38:08] answering that question
[38:10] he say is happening now it's not like
[38:15] it's going to happen over there it's
[38:18] just the person is thinking thinking
[38:23] that they can get to heaven
[38:26] uh through other means of true man-made
[38:30] systems through the uh denomination of
[38:35] things but they don't realize Heaven is
[38:39] a kingdom of God is made of the word and
[38:44] the kingdom is already within you it's
[38:48] not something that you have to go and
[38:51] then be being thrown out
[38:54] it's happening now when people try to go
[38:58] into heaven through Adam means than what
[39:03] God has is required
[39:07] that's what it is a very simple thing
[39:10] and that the there is a prerequisite to
[39:16] get to heaven
[39:17] and you have to go through the door
[39:20] and the door is uh Jesus and he stand at
[39:24] the door and he gives you a garment it's
[39:28] all happening right now it's a spiritual
[39:32] occurrence that is very critical
[39:38] because when we talk about spiritual
[39:40] things it looks like
[39:41] no that that's just like a an abstract
[39:45] notion or something like that it's
[39:48] really really happening
[39:51] and that will be my emphasize that the
[39:54] spiritual things are real
[39:58] more real sometimes than the physical
[40:00] ones
[40:03] amen
[40:05] therefore how can you find yourself
[40:07] there without the robe
[40:11] and all that is given here now
[40:16] and by looking at this I found there is
[40:19] a parent actually and then where that's
[40:21] where I got my tattoo I say is a from
[40:24] spiritual to full manifestation
[40:28] it's all started by a spiritual phase
[40:33] to the full manifestation phase the body
[40:38] change is the full manifestation amen
[40:41] but there is a spiritual phase that you
[40:45] have to go through everyone must go
[40:49] there if you want to see the full
[40:51] manifestation
[40:54] amen
[40:56] and what the devil has tried to say is
[40:59] like okay the word when we say the word
[41:03] has come right what is perfect has come
[41:06] right we say that but what is perfect is
[41:10] what
[41:11] no what is perfect is who
[41:14] is God and God is the word and I'm I'm
[41:18] quoting brother Branham without reading
[41:20] it here now
[41:21] so when we when we say that what is
[41:25] perfect has come we're talking about a
[41:28] person that has come
[41:30] is that right
[41:32] you have to go to that person otherwise
[41:35] you won't be there
[41:37] that's what it is
[41:39] that spiritual occurrence people find it
[41:43] like oh it's nothing it's just an idea
[41:46] the world has come is no it's not an
[41:49] idea it's a it's a little yes
[41:53] he has come
[41:55] and you gotta accept that invitation
[42:03] to whom shall I shall we go
[42:06] now when there is a wedding supper to to
[42:10] be given in honor of someone the
[42:13] bridegroom furnished robes that is in uh
[42:18] Middle East uh what they used to do for
[42:22] all the people that come in because it's
[42:25] friends consists of poor Rich and
[42:28] different but everyone that invite is
[42:32] given an invitation and in this
[42:35] invitation and this invitation the
[42:39] bride's groom name on it
[42:42] oh
[42:44] this invitation the name of the
[42:48] bridegroom Jesus Christ is on this
[42:51] invitation
[42:53] this invitation is the word and the name
[42:58] of the Lord Jesus is a sign below
[43:02] that word
[43:05] it's so real
[43:07] it's so critical
[43:10] it's not something we can play with
[43:14] is our lives
[43:17] amen
[43:20] it's really our life we cannot play with
[43:23] it
[43:30] so he brings this invitation to the door
[43:34] and there is a porter that stands at the
[43:37] door and he has the garments
[43:41] let me just tell to you that the door is
[43:45] the word
[43:48] who is in the door is the word
[43:51] let me just say it the government is the
[43:54] the word
[43:59] oh my
[44:00] Revelation chapter four now what do you
[44:04] think when the bridegroom
[44:07] come back and found a man sitting there
[44:10] without a wedding garment on say friend
[44:13] how do you get in here in here and it's
[44:17] too speechless it showed that it came
[44:20] some other way beside the door
[44:24] he came I he came in a window
[44:27] he came in the back door do you remember
[44:29] a computer users we had a virus called
[44:34] back door that's a wrong way to come and
[44:40] and he called him a friend showed that
[44:42] he was a church member you know he tried
[44:46] to get there by a membership in the
[44:49] church
[44:51] though you need more than it yes you
[44:53] have to have your local church that you
[44:56] support by Your Presence by your ties by
[44:59] offering yeah you must be part of the
[45:02] body you have a personal uh relationship
[45:07] with Christ but when a Rapture eruptured
[45:11] us as a body
[45:14] amen you still have to but not just a
[45:18] member in the local but the member in
[45:22] his body
[45:25] friend how did you get in here here
[45:27] without the coming on now Jesus say this
[45:31] himself
[45:33] and he called uh he called to the Porter
[45:36] and say binding him foot and hand and he
[45:39] was cast out into outer Darkness where
[45:43] he will be whipping wearing and gnashing
[45:46] of teeth that's Christ's own words right
[45:48] he was cast out because he proved
[45:52] without the wedding garment
[45:54] it comes some other way beside the door
[45:58] if he would have come by the door he
[46:01] would have received a wedding coming
[46:04] amen now he's burned because the tears
[46:07] have to be bound and burned and the
[46:11] wheat although the wheat goes into the
[46:15] storehouse and the comment is the Holy
[46:18] Ghost but the Holy Ghost proof the Holy
[46:22] Ghost
[46:23] evidence is the word of God
[46:26] amen
[46:31] is the same person
[46:33] the Holy Ghost and the word the same
[46:36] person
[46:40] another Branham question and answer uh
[46:42] 1963 now this man had come by some
[46:46] organization back at the window over
[46:49] here some slipping in the hole and he
[46:54] got in at the table and sat down all
[46:58] these things there was
[46:59] hard for me is sit down at the table in
[47:03] heaven
[47:04] no no no no no it's just all this is
[47:07] happening is the way is approaching the
[47:11] word
[47:13] it thinks that way he think he can get
[47:17] their die it he will not happen there
[47:23] must be some
[47:24] prerequisite to get in there and that's
[47:28] what he missed and he got in the table
[47:30] and sat down and went the bridegroom
[47:33] comes up
[47:34] he looks around it was this have been
[47:38] all dachshund before now is the old duck
[47:42] say what uh what's you doing here like
[47:47] that without the baptism or the Holy
[47:49] Ghost and all the things how did you
[47:53] ever get in here
[47:58] the footwash flanky is at the door and
[48:01] Jesus gave to himself that job
[48:04] they are
[48:07] the physical presence in heaven could
[48:10] not take place
[48:13] without the spiritual
[48:15] it never happened
[48:18] well it come in somewhere beside the
[48:22] door he come without the proper
[48:25] invitation
[48:27] it come by some educational system
[48:31] something like that he got in and he
[48:34] said to them bind him and then hand and
[48:38] feet cast him out here in outer Darkness
[48:41] where there will be whipping and willing
[48:44] and gnashing of teeth see he went into
[48:47] the tribulation period it did not come
[48:50] in by the door
[48:52] so all right
[48:55] yeah there is no other way of coming
[49:00] there is only one word one way is the
[49:04] word of the end time
[49:07] the message of the hour
[49:09] that's the only way you can get in it's
[49:13] the prerequisite it's why you have to go
[49:17] other ways is just an attempt that will
[49:21] never take place
[49:24] yes
[49:29] now this is what Buddha bam say in the
[49:32] present stage of my men my Ministry they
[49:34] say well all men have forsaken me but
[49:37] there's one thing he stood by me
[49:40] I'm not I was not disobedient to the
[49:42] heavenly vision that happened down there
[49:45] on the river
[49:46] have stayed true to it it has been true
[49:49] to me I'm trusting in Him someday I
[49:53] don't know when for crowning my Ministry
[49:56] I've stayed just as true as I could be I
[50:00] don't know what it will be I don't know
[50:03] when it will be I just went it's ready I
[50:06] am I don't care
[50:09] and he said I hope it will Crown my
[50:12] Ministry of this of letting me take the
[50:15] clothes of the word and dress is the
[50:19] bride in the cloth of the word and for
[50:23] is for his righteousness
[50:27] I hope you will Crown me let me stand
[50:30] that day and say Behold the Lamb of God
[50:33] that takes away the sin of the world
[50:36] so you see they uh the last messenger
[50:41] the prophet of the hour
[50:44] Ministry is to take that cloth
[50:48] so you see it's not over there is here
[50:51] is today is now is taking that close and
[50:57] the clothes of the word he put it on you
[51:00] amen he put on you therefore then you
[51:05] can go there and find yourself
[51:08] wearing the clothes of as everyone
[51:12] that's sitting there there'll be no you
[51:16] know throwing you out over there but
[51:19] everything is taking place here so you
[51:22] see for you that thinks that you know in
[51:26] the mission Fields people don't see this
[51:29] so what I'm doing this morning I'm
[51:32] encouraging you
[51:33] to uh to see that what you hold in your
[51:38] heart is precious
[51:41] what you holding is real
[51:45] what are you holding here is the
[51:48] prerequisite to go there therefore you
[51:51] already have it
[51:54] so the Rapture is a Rapture in the word
[51:59] the word is rapturing the word
[52:05] God is raptoring himself his own body
[52:09] and for that he has prepared everything
[52:14] he has an invitation what is the
[52:16] invitation the word
[52:18] who signed the invitation the word
[52:21] you have to ask repeat the word
[52:27] is that right that's what you do you
[52:30] RSVP head all right you respond to it
[52:33] amen
[52:36] and the word comes to marry you
[52:42] therefore don't tell me that the word is
[52:45] just a thought Christ has not come it's
[52:49] just a thought it's a bridegroom it has
[52:53] to come and give that dress the robe or
[52:58] the Garment for the wedding
[53:02] therefore why the devil attacked this
[53:05] Revelation so much
[53:09] we need to go back and talk about it and
[53:12] encourage each other
[53:16] amen the prophet said I hope he will yes
[53:21] he did I hope he's going to let me dress
[53:24] the bride
[53:26] I hope he will let me say Behold the
[53:31] Lamb no no no no no no no no
[53:33] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[53:38] the bridegroom
[53:39] the king
[53:42] the judge
[53:45] the cloud
[53:49] amen
[53:50] and you respond to it
[53:53] you get into the process of the rapture
[53:57] by responding to it
[53:59] you will not just happen to be raptured
[54:04] no you gotta get into a
[54:06] a process
[54:09] when she was promised she was given the
[54:13] promised son
[54:16] she who got into the process
[54:22] dramatize it
[54:24] how she sees she saw her look have
[54:27] changed on the on the mirror how a body
[54:31] start changing
[54:33] the process started and then nine months
[54:37] later she had the promised child
[54:40] so you don't happen to jump in or let me
[54:45] you know let me wait for the Los Angeles
[54:49] to go down an hour
[54:52] yeah I will call Brother Chad
[54:56] oh my
[54:58] you gotta be there you gotta be part
[55:02] you've got to be in that process
[55:05] you gotta be men of the body of Christ
[55:08] invisible body
[55:10] the invisible is the real one the
[55:14] spiritual is the real one
[55:22] amen
[55:25] I look at it I saw the pattern all over
[55:28] the Bible
[55:31] that it's always the spiritual
[55:34] phase happened
[55:37] then the physical
[55:39] or the full manifestation in everything
[55:44] in everything
[55:47] you go to your knees in your closet
[55:51] you pray
[55:53] that is spiritual occurrence who are you
[55:56] talking to
[55:58] spiritual
[55:59] communication right
[56:01] and when you come out God reward you
[56:06] openly
[56:09] is that right it was a spiritual
[56:12] occurrence in your closet
[56:16] and when you come out God heals you give
[56:19] your answer
[56:21] is that right it's uh is this now it is
[56:24] a full manifestation of that spiritual
[56:27] occurrence which one is the most
[56:31] important
[56:33] which one is it when you see the full
[56:37] manifestation of your prayer
[56:41] or for God is when you were at your on
[56:45] your knees crying to him communicating
[56:48] with him
[56:50] for God that was the most important
[56:55] when these people were getting in that
[56:58] room that was boxy room in the tent
[57:01] vision
[57:03] this was something amazing but everyone
[57:05] saw something amazing the pillar of fire
[57:08] left but the angel for the very first
[57:12] time and get into the room
[57:15] and the people that were getting in the
[57:17] room
[57:19] they had an experience
[57:23] a spiritual experience
[57:26] a real experience
[57:30] it's the true experience when they came
[57:33] out they were healed it was a full
[57:35] manifestation
[57:37] of what happened in the room
[57:40] is that right which one is the most
[57:42] important when you saw them healed or
[57:46] when they were in that room
[57:50] are you with my church
[57:52] I would say what happened in the room
[57:55] was more important than the full
[57:57] manifestation
[58:01] we start we need to start looking at
[58:03] things like God sees them all right
[58:07] yeah what was important when you were
[58:10] crying Lord this sickness this issue oh
[58:14] Lord what was it when he healed you
[58:19] it's important to be healed right yeah
[58:21] absolutely
[58:23] what was important in God's eyes
[58:27] the knee Lodge
[58:31] how they say that
[58:33] vocabulary talking about Daniel
[58:36] Denise
[58:38] okay uh that time
[58:42] when you were talking to him was the
[58:44] most important time
[58:47] it was more real amen
[58:51] amen when you came and were healed he
[58:54] was good but that was not the most
[58:55] important
[58:58] yes it was not
[59:00] we will see it God's grace
[59:03] so we we find out that you gotta have
[59:06] that uh
[59:09] you have to be in the process
[59:12] the Rapture is the process there is a
[59:15] shout there is a voice there is the uh
[59:19] the trumpet it's a process you will not
[59:22] just happen to get there and be in that
[59:27] uh Kingdom where you going to Reign How
[59:31] can you reign with Christ when you here
[59:35] are not even under Authority amen
[59:40] how can you be an authority without
[59:42] being an authority under Authority right
[59:46] you must be already under in Authority
[59:48] amen
[59:50] for that you can become an authority
[59:52] because Christ God did it with Lucifer
[59:56] he gave him Authority without him Beyond
[59:59] The Authority it didn't work
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:07] and this is where you get in here now
[1:00:09] now you're getting that you're getting
[1:00:12] to learn to be under authorities
[1:00:14] submission under the word uh
[1:00:19] and then at that point God will say that
[1:00:23] he has formed a character then I can use
[1:00:26] him
[1:00:32] all right
[1:00:35] Jesus is doing three things as he
[1:00:37] descended he has the shout he has the
[1:00:40] Trump The Voice he has a trumpet and the
[1:00:43] brother said what is a shout it's the
[1:00:46] message
[1:00:47] going forth
[1:00:49] the shout the invitation it's the shout
[1:00:53] is gathering you together it's real
[1:00:59] it means that Christ is descending
[1:01:04] it's real and people make us to get
[1:01:09] scared of what we believe
[1:01:15] because so real when you want to battle
[1:01:17] is just start talking about these things
[1:01:24] yeah
[1:01:26] when you want to fight
[1:01:28] talking about
[1:01:29] you may think oh other things happen
[1:01:32] that's why I'm I'm getting all this
[1:01:34] troubles
[1:01:36] start talking about this then the
[1:01:38] trouble come
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:43] the invitation is the word
[1:01:46] the shout is the word
[1:01:48] the door is the word
[1:01:50] but the door the word is a person
[1:01:55] so it's not an abstract an idea
[1:01:58] somewhere
[1:02:00] it's a person
[1:02:08] and when you become the word because you
[1:02:12] have received the word
[1:02:16] it's an amazing
[1:02:18] experience that you are going through
[1:02:21] but you don't know
[1:02:24] you don't know
[1:02:26] because the word is everything that's
[1:02:29] why people don't understand they think
[1:02:31] oh the word is like an idea thoughts
[1:02:35] you know ideology
[1:02:38] but they ain't the word is what created
[1:02:42] heaven and earth
[1:02:44] if you are it you are a creator
[1:02:48] you call into existence and you also can
[1:02:53] call out of existence
[1:02:55] so think about the devil
[1:02:58] Lucifer looking at you
[1:03:01] before he saw one one man
[1:03:04] Christ who could call him out of
[1:03:07] existence
[1:03:08] is that right now this is multiple
[1:03:10] people
[1:03:12] that can call him out of existence
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:18] you get it
[1:03:20] it's scary
[1:03:22] therefore don't let them get that
[1:03:25] revelation
[1:03:28] yeah
[1:03:30] that's where the battle is
[1:03:33] thank God he cares about his word and
[1:03:37] you watch over it you watch over us I
[1:03:41] remember when I started ministering in
[1:03:43] Massachusetts
[1:03:44] I was I was doing it in my own in
[1:03:47] apartment I was not even owner of a
[1:03:50] house I live in my apartment and
[1:03:53] somebody came and thrown a little firing
[1:03:57] at the
[1:03:58] uh in the window and and the place
[1:04:02] burned
[1:04:05] and burned down and and uh
[1:04:09] that the fire was aware of what was in
[1:04:12] the house
[1:04:13] the fire saw the tapes the books the
[1:04:17] message books the tapes
[1:04:19] and the fire came where the wall where
[1:04:22] there was a wall where I put everything
[1:04:25] like the Shelf the pictures and
[1:04:29] the message the taped and the fire came
[1:04:32] and said I don't want to be in trouble
[1:04:36] went up through the roof and went and
[1:04:40] burned the other they had a wall over
[1:04:43] there and left in this wall
[1:04:47] what was God showing
[1:04:50] I am so God protected us
[1:04:55] it protect his word
[1:04:58] and we were barrier of the word that's
[1:05:02] why you protect us is not actually us
[1:05:06] that it protect God protect himself
[1:05:09] because God provides only for himself
[1:05:13] therefore When you pray don't tell him
[1:05:16] God do this for me do that for me tell
[1:05:19] him God do that for me so I can worship
[1:05:24] you better
[1:05:28] I can serve you better tell him the
[1:05:31] reason why you want and make sure that
[1:05:34] the reason is not just to you
[1:05:38] but it's him
[1:06:00] you see this is a message
[1:06:02] you can read you can you can read I I
[1:06:05] caught you already
[1:06:08] you can read I don't know about you
[1:06:12] but uh
[1:06:14] sometimes you take a message like a
[1:06:17] title of a message you already you you
[1:06:20] know what is going to be what the
[1:06:22] prophet will be talking when you see
[1:06:25] just day
[1:06:26] the title have you ever been
[1:06:28] disappointed
[1:06:31] I I saw a title I was I saw a title
[1:06:35] invasion of the United States wow
[1:06:40] let me read the invasion of the United
[1:06:43] States what is that
[1:06:46] well it was not quite what I
[1:06:51] it was pretty bad
[1:06:53] but it was not what I expected I won't
[1:06:57] spoil it for you go and read it
[1:07:05] what about this one is your life worthy
[1:07:08] of the Gospel oh brother Branham will
[1:07:11] tell me how to live a Christian Life
[1:07:16] it will give me my checklist when you do
[1:07:19] this but a child loves that yeah you
[1:07:23] love a checklist so I'm I'm seeing the
[1:07:26] title and I'm just oh okay he's going to
[1:07:29] tell me that uh your life have to be
[1:07:33] this way that way this is how you have
[1:07:35] to act this is a good behavior that's
[1:07:38] what he's going to tell me
[1:07:40] nothing of it
[1:07:44] nothing he was it was just you you
[1:07:49] found you
[1:07:51] how can I say
[1:07:54] you found yourself unworthy
[1:07:57] of the Kingdom
[1:08:00] that's why you refuse
[1:08:02] [Music]
[1:08:03] the invitation
[1:08:05] that's what it is
[1:08:08] nothing about my checklist
[1:08:12] what is the good behavior of a Christian
[1:08:14] no no the good behavior is to respond to
[1:08:17] the word and let the world do the rest
[1:08:21] the problem is when people reject the
[1:08:24] word
[1:08:26] that's the problem because they have
[1:08:29] rejected prerequisite
[1:08:32] I spoke to a Believer who was telling me
[1:08:35] that I will never reconcile with this
[1:08:39] brother or that sister
[1:08:41] even if the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:08:45] with outpouring of the Holy Ghost I will
[1:08:48] never forget forgive
[1:08:51] now this is not Behavior
[1:08:54] I mean I'm not the psychologist but what
[1:08:57] I try to say is
[1:08:59] she or he was not asked
[1:09:03] to do anything
[1:09:05] it was she was rejecting
[1:09:10] the word
[1:09:12] just like these people when Jesus said
[1:09:15] eat my flesh drink my blood
[1:09:19] they did not have to do anything
[1:09:22] there was no doing
[1:09:24] it was believing
[1:09:28] all right
[1:09:30] Peter did not understand either
[1:09:33] body he used to it
[1:09:36] and when a person refused to yield
[1:09:39] that's already a problem because it's a
[1:09:42] prerequisite
[1:09:44] to manifestation
[1:09:47] you understand my English
[1:09:49] it's a prerequisite from spiritual to
[1:09:53] full manifestation
[1:09:58] when the word of God comes you yield to
[1:10:02] it and let me redefine
[1:10:06] yielding yielding doesn't mean doing
[1:10:10] anything
[1:10:12] when you yield for a car that is coming
[1:10:16] you don't do anything you yield
[1:10:19] you lit
[1:10:21] you give way
[1:10:24] so therefore the first thing when you
[1:10:27] hear the word is to say Amen to that
[1:10:30] word
[1:10:32] is not to do anything
[1:10:34] it's not to perform it's not nothing
[1:10:36] it's just a say Amen to it I don't know
[1:10:40] how I will do it
[1:10:41] I am weak I am this
[1:10:45] but I say Amen to that
[1:10:49] and let now the word do what it's
[1:10:52] supposed to do
[1:10:55] am I making sense yeah
[1:11:07] let me switch a little bit let me
[1:11:10] let me go
[1:11:12] and maybe we will come back
[1:11:16] let me go to Matthew 26.
[1:11:19] 36.
[1:11:23] here's the Jesus
[1:11:25] in Gethsemane
[1:11:28] then cometh Jesus with them unto a place
[1:11:31] called a bitter man
[1:11:32] and say unto the disciples City here
[1:11:36] while I go and pray under
[1:11:39] and it took with him Peter and the two
[1:11:42] sons of exibity and began to be so full
[1:11:46] and very heavy
[1:11:49] what is Soulful and very heavy depressed
[1:11:53] you know really heavy sadness
[1:11:57] depressed Christ knows how when we are
[1:12:00] depressed he does he understand that
[1:12:04] you know
[1:12:06] and then say he unto them my soul is
[1:12:09] exceeding Soulful and even unto death
[1:12:13] Terry ye
[1:12:14] hear and watch with me again he
[1:12:18] understand how to be lonely
[1:12:23] such a high priest an amazing High
[1:12:25] Praise he felt it in his own body oh
[1:12:29] praise God
[1:12:31] verse 39 and he went a little further
[1:12:34] and fell on his face and prayed saying
[1:12:37] oh my father if it be possible let this
[1:12:41] cup
[1:12:42] pass from me nevertheless not as I will
[1:12:45] but as thou
[1:12:48] wealth
[1:12:49] and he came up unto the disciples and
[1:12:53] findeth them a slip and say unto Peter
[1:12:57] what could he not watch with me one hour
[1:13:00] watch and pray that he entered not into
[1:13:04] temptation the spirit indeed is willing
[1:13:08] but the flesh is weak
[1:13:14] he went away again the second time and
[1:13:17] pray and pray saying O my father if this
[1:13:21] cup may not pass away from me except I
[1:13:25] drink it
[1:13:27] thy will be done and he came and founded
[1:13:30] them asleep again for their eyes were
[1:13:34] heavy
[1:13:38] Jesus was God In the Flesh
[1:13:43] he was a king the prophet say he was the
[1:13:46] king of prophets
[1:13:48] you see I put cup in the blue so you can
[1:13:51] see it
[1:13:53] he is in Gethsemane
[1:13:57] and he sees a vision
[1:14:00] somewhere brother Burnham say he was in
[1:14:03] a conference
[1:14:05] a spiritual conference with the father
[1:14:10] and they're talking
[1:14:13] and he sees the cup and he knows as a
[1:14:17] Prophet this is a symbol what it means
[1:14:20] is if I accept
[1:14:24] then it will be I will take the cup of
[1:14:27] the sins of humanity
[1:14:31] that means
[1:14:34] all right
[1:14:36] all right is screaming Hebrews tells us
[1:14:40] he's screaming father if it was possible
[1:14:44] Let It Go
[1:14:51] the vision of the cup is spiritual
[1:14:54] occurrence
[1:14:59] it was a spiritual faith
[1:15:04] before the physical happened
[1:15:07] at Calvary is that right
[1:15:12] get some money has to happen before
[1:15:15] Calvary
[1:15:18] if if gesman did not happen don't ask
[1:15:22] for Calvary
[1:15:24] so what do I which one is the most
[1:15:27] important
[1:15:29] in a Gethsemane a cry he begged
[1:15:34] is screamed
[1:15:37] did he cry and beg and scream
[1:15:41] Calvary
[1:15:43] the Bible said he was silent there
[1:15:47] the most important things were happening
[1:15:51] in Gethsemane
[1:15:55] this is where
[1:15:57] he had to die
[1:16:04] so if I talk this way to my fellow
[1:16:07] denominational
[1:16:09] you're saying Calvary was not important
[1:16:12] that Calvary was absolutely important
[1:16:16] but he had a prerequisite
[1:16:20] it could not happen without to get the
[1:16:24] money
[1:16:28] is that right
[1:16:33] yeah the pro the prophet say that uh
[1:16:37] that this
[1:16:39] eternal destination of every soul
[1:16:42] was there at Gethsemane
[1:16:46] the decision he had to make
[1:16:49] will impact all of us
[1:16:52] and he say and when our blessed Lord
[1:16:55] indeed to get the money when going there
[1:16:57] when he was be rejected at Jerusalem and
[1:17:01] the council was going to take his life
[1:17:03] when Eternal destination of every soul
[1:17:06] that ever was would be on the earth
[1:17:10] rested upon his decision
[1:17:13] he has to say yes
[1:17:17] you see it has just to say Amen
[1:17:23] and once you say amen he had taken the
[1:17:27] cup
[1:17:28] all this is spiritual
[1:17:31] but so real
[1:17:36] and today they want to tell us that the
[1:17:38] word has come the Capstone has come it's
[1:17:42] just something
[1:17:44] it's so real
[1:17:48] they the devil wants to steal us from us
[1:17:53] let's be encouraged
[1:17:55] this message is precious
[1:17:58] don't play with it
[1:18:05] why
[1:18:09] let me just continue
[1:18:11] but in that great crucial hour until he
[1:18:16] suffer knowing all things he saw it he
[1:18:20] was a god of prophets until the water
[1:18:24] and the blood separate in his body and
[1:18:27] the great drop of sweat like blood
[1:18:30] dropped from his brow he died more death
[1:18:35] and gets the money then he died on the
[1:18:39] cross
[1:18:44] the physical or the spiritual
[1:18:50] he bled
[1:18:54] before bleeding
[1:18:56] he died before dying
[1:19:00] oh brother that's not English I'm not
[1:19:03] talking English now
[1:19:06] he bled before bleeding
[1:19:10] in where I didn't get the money or you
[1:19:13] never seen it real the Bible
[1:19:15] the sweat it was like brah
[1:19:20] before Calvary
[1:19:22] he died to himself
[1:19:25] he died to what he wanted
[1:19:30] before die
[1:19:33] without to get the money there will be
[1:19:35] no calipery
[1:19:43] the spiritual is a prerequisite
[1:19:48] to
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] physical
[1:19:53] or the full manifestation
[1:20:00] is
[1:20:02] okay it's actually more real
[1:20:05] more real death
[1:20:09] I have it in the blue
[1:20:13] more real
[1:20:16] so therefore let's stop thinking that
[1:20:19] everything has to be physical physical
[1:20:22] physical because the reality is
[1:20:24] spiritual
[1:20:29] it's the reality
[1:20:33] but Abraham say all the kingdoms of God
[1:20:35] is made of the invisible
[1:20:40] is that right
[1:20:41] and it's more real love is more real
[1:20:44] than the material
[1:20:48] peace is more real
[1:20:50] give me five pounds of Peace this
[1:20:54] morning
[1:20:55] go to Walmart get me that
[1:20:58] can't find it is that right
[1:21:01] but it's more real than your grocery
[1:21:14] and whatever but I'm explained
[1:21:16] all this were happening
[1:21:19] was
[1:21:20] and get the money
[1:21:22] Jesus was
[1:21:24] in a conference with a father
[1:21:27] he say to his disciple wearing they had
[1:21:31] had a lot of big meetings I was tired
[1:21:34] perhaps like you are this morning but he
[1:21:38] said will you just watch with me an hour
[1:21:40] and for I got to go younger and have
[1:21:43] conference I have to go alone
[1:21:46] and when the the conference was set in
[1:21:49] the lamp Young and Beautiful Life Never
[1:21:53] a life like that never was never will be
[1:21:56] a life like that the lamb had
[1:22:00] but now the father said are you willing
[1:22:05] are you willing to die
[1:22:07] are you willing
[1:22:10] and when God asks you can you do this
[1:22:12] can you do that why don't you just say
[1:22:14] Amen
[1:22:17] once you say Amen is like you accept the
[1:22:20] word
[1:22:21] let the word
[1:22:23] provide for itself is that right it's
[1:22:27] not me
[1:22:29] is the word in me
[1:22:32] yeah
[1:22:33] Is Your Love force that sinful thinking
[1:22:37] world that you were born in do you love
[1:22:40] them enough to forfeit your life do you
[1:22:44] love them enough to protect their place
[1:22:46] to Bear their sin to the hardest crucial
[1:22:49] death
[1:22:50] the father is asking do you love them
[1:22:54] there could be nothing die that kind of
[1:22:57] death but him
[1:22:59] he died he he died to himself
[1:23:04] he was the greatest death
[1:23:07] Calvary
[1:23:09] he never opened his mouth
[1:23:12] it was a a happening yeah
[1:23:15] something it was happening
[1:23:19] that was nothing
[1:23:21] and get some money everything
[1:23:28] and now in that conference such a
[1:23:31] decision was made until blood dropped
[1:23:34] from his brow
[1:23:37] he was under strained the sins of the
[1:23:40] world was upon him and then he looked
[1:23:43] into the face of the dove and say not my
[1:23:46] will but that will be done
[1:23:52] the thing that you have to overcome is
[1:23:55] yourself your idea your thing and
[1:23:59] surrender yourself to him
[1:24:01] he overcome for you he knows the way we
[1:24:05] are
[1:24:09] the thing that you have to overcome is
[1:24:11] yourself this man had to overcome
[1:24:14] himself if he had to go to the marriage
[1:24:17] supper
[1:24:20] he had to surrender he has to receive
[1:24:24] the invitation respond to it
[1:24:31] one was a prerequisite of the other
[1:24:35] without their spiritual one the physical
[1:24:39] one the full manifestation will not have
[1:24:43] taken place
[1:24:45] without the spiritual rapture
[1:24:50] the physical body change will not take
[1:24:53] place
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] you gotta be in the spiritual Rapture
[1:25:00] now and it's real
[1:25:04] amen amen
[1:25:07] how do you get it by marrying the word

[1:25:14] word that you hear it
[1:25:17] we have become used to the word I know

[1:28:06] so everything is happening in the
[1:28:09] spiritual realm right now

[1:28:59] when the word here
[1:29:02] Unite with the person they to become one
[1:29:06] and then what does it do then it
[1:29:11] manifests the son of man again not the
[1:29:14] church theologians the son of man the
[1:29:17] word and the church becomes one whatever
[1:29:21] the son of man done he hear the word the
[1:29:24] church does the same thing
[1:29:28] amen so it's happening now
[1:29:32] before the body change
[1:29:37] it's happening
[1:29:39] and all that the devil can put in front
[1:29:42] of us to stop this he will throw it at
[1:29:45] us
[1:29:47] but we are hidden behind him the husband
[1:29:52] we don't have our own strength he is
[1:29:54] there to protect us to take care of this
[1:29:58] business what should I do I just have to
[1:30:02] yield to it
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:08] that's
[1:30:10] the apparent that I saw in the word is
[1:30:13] just always
[1:30:15] that part and happen before the
[1:30:19] spiritual
[1:30:21] the before the physical the full
[1:30:24] manifestation
[1:30:26] the spiritual takes place and people say
[1:30:29] ah the spiritual is just an idea
[1:30:32] and then they miss the whole thing then
[1:30:34] they will come but when I'm saying some
[1:30:36] will come and say oh we heard that the
[1:30:40] Rapture takes place then there is a
[1:30:43] tribulation then this then that and it
[1:30:46] will say it already happened where were
[1:30:48] you you were not in the process
[1:30:54] you're going to be in the process you've
[1:30:56] got to be part of it it does not just
[1:30:59] happen
[1:31:00] it is a process
[1:31:03] God help us
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:11] let me read one more thing
[1:31:16] event made clear by prophecy
[1:31:20] now I
[1:31:21] will have a prayer line and I want to
[1:31:23] pray for the sick as much as I can now
[1:31:26] we can either have a line to call the
[1:31:29] people to bring them up here a prayer
[1:31:32] line and pray for everybody here that is
[1:31:35] sick and I suppose I have my ministers
[1:31:39] Brothers to come here with us and lay
[1:31:43] hands upon you we can sure do that and
[1:31:47] either or either we can ask a father who
[1:31:51] is the only one that could do anything
[1:31:53] for you
[1:31:57] because my hand is just a man like you
[1:32:02] you men but the thing it is it's not the
[1:32:06] human hand that does it the will of God
[1:32:11] faith in that word is what does it
[1:32:15] not scientific think about it not
[1:32:18] physical
[1:32:19] it's all together unscientific there is
[1:32:23] not one thing the Christian has in its
[1:32:27] earner that's a scientific
[1:32:30] uh
[1:32:31] did you know that love joy peace
[1:32:35] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:32:37] gentleness patience Faith Holy Ghost
[1:32:41] everything is unseen by science
[1:32:45] and that's the only thing that is real
[1:32:48] and last thing
[1:32:53] well uh the fullness of the world has
[1:32:56] come yeah yeah yeah but what is the
[1:32:59] fullness of the word
[1:33:02] Christ
[1:33:04] oh
[1:33:09] well but uh we're still waiting uh
[1:33:12] well
[1:33:15] we're waiting is the body change
[1:33:20] and going home
[1:33:22] but the fullness of the word is Christ
[1:33:26] is the bridegroom is the king is the
[1:33:29] judge
[1:33:31] in the mighty angel
[1:33:35] yeah
[1:33:38] what is more real
[1:33:40] the spiritual things
[1:33:42] are more real
[1:33:45] everything
[1:33:46] you look at come from the earth and goes
[1:33:49] back to the Earth
[1:33:51] but the things that you can't see with
[1:33:53] your eye but see it declare itself that
[1:33:57] the world of eternal
[1:34:04] let me read an exposition to the church
[1:34:08] ages
[1:34:10] and the true
[1:34:13] and the True Vine or what about her is
[1:34:17] she growing
[1:34:18] where are those vast numbers that keep
[1:34:22] coming to revivals and answer out to
[1:34:25] cause
[1:34:27] and not most of them merely emotional in
[1:34:30] their approach in this the series of
[1:34:35] something physical rather than Desiring
[1:34:39] which is truly spiritual right
[1:34:45] people want the emotional the thing that
[1:34:50] they can touch
[1:34:53] well
[1:34:54] is not actually the
[1:34:58] the spiritual that is more real the
[1:35:01] prophet is asking
[1:35:05] is this age not like the day in which
[1:35:08] Noah entered the Ark and the door was
[1:35:10] shut but yet God carried in a judgment
[1:35:13] seven days none was literally turned to
[1:35:17] God in those silent States
[1:35:21] let me
[1:35:22] let us look at this
[1:35:25] Noah was a prophet
[1:35:28] he was Vindicated by God and he had a
[1:35:32] message that was unscientific
[1:35:35] but it was so real
[1:35:37] it's going to rain
[1:35:39] for seven days
[1:35:41] he got in in the ark with his children
[1:35:45] his wife
[1:35:48] he's all right
[1:35:51] but the door the door of the Ark was
[1:35:55] still open for seven days
[1:36:01] is that right
[1:36:04] but no one got in the ark
[1:36:10] technically
[1:36:12] the door was open
[1:36:16] but in reality it was closed
[1:36:22] they could get there but they could not
[1:36:27] because
[1:36:30] the spiritual proceeds
[1:36:35] the full manifestation
[1:36:38] the spiritual precede the physical
[1:36:43] since they did not receive the message
[1:36:46] of Noah they could not get in the ark
[1:36:50] Ark but the ark was open brother John
[1:36:52] yes it was open but they could not get
[1:36:55] there
[1:36:56] because they
[1:36:58] prerequisite was to believe in Noah
[1:37:03] you can see the door open but you know
[1:37:06] as a spiritual people you understand
[1:37:08] they could not get there
[1:37:12] seven days the door opened they could
[1:37:16] not get there
[1:37:18] it was open right
[1:37:22] but they could not how could they get in
[1:37:25] the ark if they did not believe Noah
[1:37:32] that's how it is I saw this pattern I
[1:37:35] preached in the mission field in
[1:37:39] Pennsylvania
[1:37:42] they couldn't it was open
[1:37:45] calls it the silence day
[1:37:57] oh my that
[1:38:00] is it the rising of the Sun
[1:38:03] Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:38:06] talking about
[1:38:08] it was waved over the people
[1:38:12] the first time they were they will come
[1:38:15] forth for the bright age for a
[1:38:19] resurrection out of dark denomination on
[1:38:21] his
[1:38:23] will be a message that
[1:38:25] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:38:30] back again in its full power and being
[1:38:33] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:38:36] and wonder as they did back there Christ
[1:38:39] himself yes
[1:38:41] except he is not in the body that went
[1:38:45] in the grave but is in a different body
[1:38:48] but himself is again waved here right
[1:38:54] but what I want to emphasize here
[1:38:57] emphasize here
[1:38:59] is
[1:39:01] the bright age continues here
[1:39:05] they say because I live he live also
[1:39:09] speaking to his wife because I live he
[1:39:13] live also what a resurrection that was
[1:39:16] and what Resurrection this is
[1:39:20] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:39:23] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:39:27] quickening power
[1:39:29] what Resurrection
[1:39:31] this was
[1:39:33] ah let's go back and see that that
[1:39:36] Resurrection is happening in a bright
[1:39:39] age she's being resurrected out of the
[1:39:44] dark denominationalism
[1:39:48] you cannot
[1:39:51] resurrect
[1:39:55] before
[1:39:57] you resurrect from the nomination
[1:40:04] you have to come out of the grave
[1:40:08] the tombs of the nomination men's idea
[1:40:14] this is a spiritual
[1:40:16] occurrence
[1:40:19] first you resurrect from the nominations
[1:40:22] then
[1:40:25] you can see the physical Resurrection
[1:40:31] praise God

[1:41:12] the spiritual application is real
[1:41:17] the physical
[1:41:19] is just a consequence
[1:41:21] it's just the right
[1:41:23] the normal course of action
[1:41:28] amen

[1:50:12] precious Heavenly Father
[1:50:16] ah take this word your word
[1:50:21] Place upon our heart this morning
[1:50:26] father we try to encourage each other as
[1:50:30] we see the day approaching
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:34] oh God
[1:50:36] this message is real
[1:50:41] the word is Christ
[1:50:44] and the Christ is the person of the word
[1:50:49] is the person
[1:50:52] is not an idea
[1:50:55] it is not an abstract
[1:50:59] but it's the reality
[1:51:01] the devil has tried to attack this
[1:51:05] portion of the word
[1:51:08] and this morning we we just
[1:51:12] we have poor our heart
[1:51:15] and to tell your children that this is
[1:51:19] real
[1:51:20] father
[1:51:21] you make it
[1:51:23] real to them too like like we just think
[1:51:27] there is a fountain
[1:51:29] there is a water is pouring
[1:51:32] let's go let's just go
[1:51:34] and take and drink from it it will do us
[1:51:39] good it will change us it will transform
[1:51:42] us it will mold us into your own
[1:51:45] character and when we do it will not be
[1:51:49] it will not be us doing it will be you
[1:51:53] in us it will be it won't be a human
[1:51:56] effort
[1:51:58] father all we need is just to yield to
[1:52:03] it today
[1:52:05] I have redefined our word healing
[1:52:09] I just say it's actually you don't do
[1:52:13] anything
[1:52:14] you just say Amen to the word
[1:52:18] truly in your heart
[1:52:21] truly in your heart maybe we don't know
[1:52:25] what to do how to do what you ask us to
[1:52:28] do but if we yield
[1:52:31] won't you come down won't you help us
[1:52:35] to do what you want us to do
[1:52:38] and that's the point father
[1:52:43] that's the point is spiritual
[1:52:46] precedes
[1:52:48] the physical
[1:52:50] before
[1:52:53] the full manifestation
[1:52:56] there is
[1:52:57] a spiritual occurrence
[1:53:00] the spiritual is so real
[1:53:03] is the real thing
[1:53:05] get some money what's the real thing
[1:53:10] Calvary was real too
[1:53:13] was actually real
[1:53:15] it's what we know without it happening
[1:53:18] no one will be safe without Calvary but
[1:53:24] there was a prerequisite to Calvary
[1:53:29] it gets the money we sometimes lose
[1:53:33] sight of get the money we lose sight of
[1:53:37] what the spiritual
[1:53:39] experience that we have
[1:53:42] we lose sight of our personal
[1:53:47] relationship with you
[1:53:49] but that's the real thing that's what
[1:53:52] that's what you are looking for that
[1:53:55] communion that personal relationship
[1:53:59] it's more than anything that we can get
[1:54:03] it's more than having a good job it's
[1:54:07] more than having a good health it's more
[1:54:11] than anything
[1:54:13] relationship with you
[1:54:15] it's spiritual but it's a real father
[1:54:19] I am a human being
[1:54:21] I may not expressing exactly as you
[1:54:26] wanted but God take those words
[1:54:29] and place it place them in your children
[1:54:34] hearts
[1:54:35] take what belongs to your place in the
[1:54:38] heart

[1:54:42] they stick to this word
