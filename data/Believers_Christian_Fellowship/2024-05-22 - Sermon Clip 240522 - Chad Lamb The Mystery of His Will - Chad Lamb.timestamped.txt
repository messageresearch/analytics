[0:00] and God's purpose in his life was so
[0:02] powerful amen the revelation of God's
[0:04] will was so powerful that when they put
[0:06] him in prison and he couldn't get out
[0:08] and go visit churches anymore that he
[0:10] would sit there and start writing the
[0:12] Revelation that God put in his heart and
[0:14] mailing it
[0:15] out it couldn't be stopped amen there
[0:18] was something God was doing in his
[0:22] life but now we come to the bride God's
[0:25] got a purpose in you and I amen what do
[0:27] we need now we need the same thing the
[0:29] Apostle Paul had we need to go out to a
[0:31] desert place and separate from everybody
[0:34] until we come and encounter the pillar
[0:36] of fire and find out what the will of
[0:38] God is concerning
[0:40] us amen the prophet of God already found
[0:44] this
[0:45] place he went to the Wilderness Sabino
[0:49] Canyon amen he went to Sunset Mountain
[0:52] he already went to the Wilderness place
[0:54] and he got the Revelation amen and he
[0:56] brought the Revelation back amen that
[0:58] was wonderful but I need my desert
[1:01] experience I need my encounter with
[1:03] Christ I need to know not what the will
[1:05] of God is concerning the seventh age I
[1:08] need to know more than that you know the
[1:10] will of God concerning the bride amen
[1:12] and the adoption of the bride and the
[1:14] marriage of the lamb and the opening of
[1:16] the seals all those things are so
[1:18] instrumental but with all of that I must
[1:22] find what God's will is concerning me as
[1:25] an individual am I part of
[1:28] that I can say that's nothing but the
[1:30] truth brother benam was the seventh
[1:32] angel amen he was the he was the one he
[1:35] was the the voice of the seventh angel
[1:37] in Revelation 10:7 absolutely without
[1:40] question amen and he opened the seals
[1:42] the seals are now open we know all of
[1:44] that I you can agree with that all day
[1:47] long but you can still walk defeated in
[1:49] this life amen being train wrecked all
[1:51] the time being s railed and not pressing
[1:54] forward amen and you wonder sometimes
[1:56] why people amen they fall away to the
[1:58] side and they quit trying and quit
[2:00] pressing and get discouraged and want to
[2:02] quit and fall out I say what we need is
[2:04] the mystery of God's will for
[2:07] us because we's no way we're going to
[2:10] have it different than the prophet had
[2:11] it no way we're going to have a
[2:12] different Paul or the or the other
[2:14] churches there's no way we're going to
[2:16] walk through this life without somebody
[2:17] throwing some stones at us amen spitting
[2:20] on us and rejecting us or praising us
[2:22] and telling us we're the most wonderful
[2:24] thing ever we need something more than
[2:27] somebody else's revelation of the will
[2:29] of God
[2:30] I need the revelation of the will of God
[2:32] for
[2:34] me I believe all of it's true but I need
[2:37] to know it's true for
[2:40] me because if it's true for me then I'm
[2:44] his
[2:48] bride I can say in the end time God's
[2:51] calling out his bride that's the
[2:54] truth but I need to know he's calling
[2:56] out
[2:57] me in the end time he sent up Prophet to
[3:00] dress his bride in the Garment of the
[3:01] word I need to know that that prophet's
[3:04] dressing
[3:05] me he sent a prophet now amen to come
[3:09] and bring us to the invisible Union to
[3:11] the marriage I need to know that that
[3:13] prophet's Ministry is bringing me to the
[3:14] invisible Union
