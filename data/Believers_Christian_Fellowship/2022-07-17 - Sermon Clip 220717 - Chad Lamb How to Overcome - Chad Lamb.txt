TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh i tell you friends the the hardest person in the world to overcome is ourselves the one that we look at in the mirror and if we're ever going to overcome cells we have to start being really honest with ourselves we got to get down to nitty gritty and say you know what that's just me because that's what i want to do i'm trying to make it work out for me i'm interpreting all the little signs you know i want to go do this thing and and i've got a little bit of a check in my heart a little bit of conviction about wasting that money or wasting that time or doing this so i'm going to watch for god to give a sign all of a sudden somebody else said that and look at this it connects with this and i walked through the store and i saw in the newspaper that same word it sounds ridiculous but that's exactly what we do it's exactly what we do instead of just saying god this is what i want but i don't know that it's what you want i need a real answer it's amazing how dishonest we are with ourselves but the the funny part is deep down we know but up here we convince ourselves when down here we're not sold or maybe i'm the only one who does that but i can explain it thoroughly to you because i've been through it numerous times down here there's a little check a little no but up here in the reasoning realm i want to it's not sin right you can't say it's sin i want to do this but down here there's a little no but i will reason and reason and then all if i can find where the prophet did it where see he went fishing i can abandon these duties and go fishing if i can find where the prophet did it or i can find some some some something to give me just that little edge that little push in my reasoning mind amen to get over this nagging feeling i'll go down that path and then think that i've got an answer from the lord but deep down in your heart you already know i don't know how we can go on being the bride of jesus christ unless we start being really real really real all the way down to the core of our persons and stop playing games in our mind and stop playing games with the word and stop playing games with ourselves but get down to the nitty-gritty and say this is here i am lord this is what i've done god forgive me and lead me and let me stay in your word because he'll try to give you a word that will allow you to do what you already want to do and you know what god will let him to prove what's in our hearts and every once in a while we need to fall and bump our nose real hard to realize that i still need god and i still need to be honest with god and i'm still in fallen flesh and i'm still in a corruptable body with a corruptable mind and i need to feed the white dog and i need to stay close to christ and i need to line to this word if i ever hope to overcome in this world
