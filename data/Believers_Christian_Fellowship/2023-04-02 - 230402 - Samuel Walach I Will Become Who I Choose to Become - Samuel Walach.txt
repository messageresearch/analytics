airlines have not got everything fixed yet they're still in a bad shape brother Samuel was supposed to come in on Friday evening at Fort Wayne and I drove over to pick him up he was going to land about 8 30 something like that everything was perfect except he got stuck in Minneapolis because they didn't have a flight crew that could take his plane from Minneapolis to Fort Wayne so they waited until there was an ice and snowstorm in Minneapolis that caused them to have de-icing situations and delays and so then they finally Florida flew to Fort Wayne after many hours of delay and as they were coming into Fort Wayne there was a tornado Landing in Fort Wayne so they diverted to Detroit landed in Detroit was supposed to refuel and fly to Fort Wayne well then they found out that the pilots were going to time out on their daily allowance so they had to spend the night in Detroit and then then they are going to catch an early flight then so I drove back home then drove back to Fort Wayne in the morning because he was going to get an early flight when he gets to the airport for his early flight they tell him that the pilots haven't had enough time off so they're going to delay their flight to 12 30. so it at one o'clock they got on the plane and sat on the plane for an hour and a half waiting for somebody to fuel the plane so that they could fly to Fort Wayne I said well praise God this is going to be a wonderful service and a wonderful day and God is good anyhow so we got there late uh then when he then we went to the luggage carousel and no luggage came out so we went to file a claim and they told him that his luggage is still in Amsterdam so we had to go shopping so he could buy enough clothes to preach this morning I tell you what you know what if they

Shekinah Glory that is the glory that we had with our father before the foundation of the world that is the glory that that is the worship that that we had we were part of when the sons of God they were rejoicing amen praise the lord we were together with job with the Saints of fault with the bride that is gathered here and that is gathered today all over the globe amen we are part of one big family amen the family of God we just fell in here into time for a certain period of time but we are going back to glory to that unending Shekinah glory amen praise the Lord thank you musicians amen so yeah it's good to be here amen that's been a roller coaster for me I've never experienced something like that but then the more things go wrong uh I believe that the Lord is presence he he just gives peace into our hearts you just know that you have it's beyond your control that there is something good on the way and I believe it is the Lord it is not me coming it is not somebody else coming but it is the the word of the Lord amen that he sends in due season amen do we believe in due season amen do we believe in an ever-present God Amen not the god of yesterday not the god of the future but the I am amen praise the Lord and we would like to share a little bit on the god of I am today amen so before I forget I just want to pass greetings from our home Church from my dad brother yatzik he's been here I believe two months ago so so I'm just repeating the the greetings from our church amen greetings also from my wife and my my two kids they know brother Chad uh they know brother Ilya brother Benjamin amen and we appreciate you amen because we are part of the body of of Christ amen so maybe uh I I wasn't the only one who had trouble this weekend amen amen I was hoping for a 24-hour Journey since I started at home to better chat's place but it took 48 hours but the Lord's been good amen I started with my suitcase in Poland but my suitcase forsook me on the way amen so I'm I'm really depending on the Lord amen I have no companion amen no earthy companion so praise the Lord and I appreciate our Chad and his family and also the patience that he had you know driving to Fort Wayne two times and then spending uh an ending uh hours there waiting for me and then I provided him also with the experience of shopping together with me for clothes so uh but we were in the same spirit amen amen we were fast amen praise the Lord so I'm so glad and I've got uh I've got the shoes of brother Joe he's teaching Sunday school and it's not so easy when you've got size 13 or 14 amen but I'm so glad that there are some some representatives of My Tribe here amen the Bigfoot tribe amen praise the Lord you know and I was I just came here without my luggage so I didn't have any uh church clothes I just had this die amen but it didn't fit with a t-shirt so uh so I'm so thankful to brother Chad for for providing everything but I just thought to myself I I was uh awoken this morning and I just thought to myself why why did all this happen you know and then I was reminded when Jesus was here on Earth hey man he left his suitcase in glory amen everything that he was he left in glory and he came to borrow your shoes amen he came to borrow your lips he came to borrow your skin amen your hands your feet whatever you can give him he'll accept it amen amen so let us lent it to him this morning amen whatever you got amen you always have something to share with him amen so while we're standing uh let's open second Peter chapter one verse verses one to four Second Epistle of Peter chapter one verses one through four amen when you're there say amen amen okay Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue amen and let's focus on verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises amen that by these promises he might be partakers of the divine nature amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen isn't that powerful amen partakers of divine nature amen Heaven escape the corruption that is in the world through lust amen and let's just turn quickly to the Book of Exodus chapter 3 verses 11 through 14 also for verses of scripture amen Exodus chapter 3. verse 11. amen and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be the token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt He Shall Serve God upon this mountain and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them amen so Moses he knew the nature of man amen that they would inquire what is the name of the Lord but I'm so thankful that God also knows the nature of man amen and I'm so thankful for his answers amen and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you amen let's bar heads for a word of Prayer your heavenly father we just want to be in your presence father we just want to be partakers of that divine nature father escaping the corruption that is in the world father we just want to be part of that ending Shekinah Glory we're just so thankful that you've gathered us here father you knew us before the foundation of the world you knew about the meeting father you knew about the service you knew also about the circumstances father and you're mindful so we are so thankful that you've been with the Believers here that we're facing natural disasters father that you've protected them from all harm father we just want to thank you we don't want to take it for granted father whatever you do that is an expression of love to us so we just want to yield to you father we want to get out of the way may your Holy Spirit just flow through US Lord may you fill each and every vessel Lord to the brim father to the point of overflowing father we don't want to be half full we we want to be full of your glory father we want to be full of your presence Lord we just commit ourselves into your hands with the portions of scripture that we've read may you bless it in our hearts as we speak about you father about your nature about who you are Lord we want to know you we know we want to know you even better father we just appreciate you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated amen amen aren't you glad for Sunday amen we came here we don't have to work amen today hallelujah we're just sitting relaxing amen but it is different with the Lord he came here to serve he came to do his work amen so we just want to recognize his work the work of the Lord in our midst amen as he is moving from one seed to another revealing himself to us amen showing us more of who we are amen what pertains to us what belongs to us amen praise the Lord so I just want to start with a quote from the seed is not air with the shack 1965. Brian says neither will a Christian eat on that carrions from all denominational doctrines and things amen they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour God promised rabbits in the days of Luther amen that was also a promise for Luther and for their age he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal amen the full seven course menu Hallelujah for all the Seven Seals are opened and everything is ready for the word of God to those who isn't that a powerful quote amen we are not feeding on some rabbits amen that was the right in the time of Luther that's the extent of light that they had and there was another promise after the days of Luther they were promised something more but we are promised something totally out of the league of Luther and Wesley amen can you agree with that amen he's been good to us he sent us his message amen it wasn't a sealed book but he brought the book that is open amen he opened the Seven Seals for us amen so that we will we could partake of the full Square meal amen the full seven course menu amen I was just thinking about that you know because whenever you go to a restaurant uh it may be a good restaurant right amen but it's not always true that you would get seven meals right a seven course menu so that is a special kind of restaurants there is something out of the ordinary it is not for Ordinary People to go to such a restaurant to partake of such kind of food amen you need to be a special person and that needs to be a special place amen I believe that we can relate amen can we relate to that are we the special people amen are we in the special place have we received a special message amen so it's a different kind of eating when you go to such an upscale restaurant amen you're not there to stuff yourself with food amen you are not going there just to just to satisfy your natural needs amen you just go there for the experience amen praise the Lord there is something different you go there to discover new tastes new combinations amen because there is somebody it's not that that the food came pre-packaged but there is somebody behind the scenes that is the Master Chef amen and he is the one who who does the difference amen he's the one responsible for all of the me deals amen so we may see different people coming and ministering you can see your pastor you can see this preacher or that preacher but let us realize one thing that we don't want to bring anything of our own we are just servers amen we just serve the food that the Master Chef prepared himself amen so praise the Lord so he wants to take us today on a special Journey Amen to discover new tastes to discover new flavors new combinations sometimes the combinations can be shocking you mean you you know if you go to an upscale restaurant with seven course menu and I don't believe that they will serve you a burger amen it's all right to eat a burger amen but you don't expect a burger Amen in such a place amen that's something different amen so you don't go there just not to die out of hunger amen you don't go there to stock up food Amen to eat because you don't know what will happen tomorrow amen maybe these are not big chunks of food maybe these are small plates amen but they tell a certain story amen and I believe that when we feed on the word of God when we feed on the message we can see the story amen we need to see the story behind the food amen it's not just food to eat and to survive because in laodicea amen we are not just survivors amen we didn't come here just to survive laodicea amen we came here for a different purpose we came here to be victorious in this age amen and that is something different amen praise the Lord aren't you glad for that amen so this kind of food is reserved just for special people amen and I believe it is said in Hebrews that is reserved for the people whose senses are exercised by reason of use amen we need to exercise our senses Amen to appreciate the word of God to appreciate what was sent our way this time amen praise the Lord so that seven chorus menu is not a food for beggars amen it is a food that the kind of food reserved for the children of God for the elect for the chosen priesthood amen for the holy nation amen praise the Lord so it is not a man who prepares that food amen is God himself Hallelujah when when Jesus they were uh in a convention together with the disciples and the disciples they didn't know what to say what to do they wanted to buy food they wanted to bring food maybe from the market from something that was already prepared but there was the Master Chef present amen and so he said you give them food amen but what he did he he just broke the bread amen he multiplied the fishes amen and he gave to the disciples to distribute amen praise the Lord you give them something to eat amen and we've been given something amen there's been something held in store for the entire bride amen special kind of food special kind of an experience that will bring you on a journey that will that will take you from the realm of that just natural needs of the realm of natural uh wants and hungers of this world it'll bring you on a journey that will remind you of the place of the time where you've been before the foundation of the world and mad don't you want to be a part of the journey amen that brings you home that reminds you of the taste of the flavors that were back home in your father's house amen praise the Lord hallelujah and the warehouse is full of good food amen we can agree with that amen we don't want to we don't need to search here and there run to and fro just go and follow every wind of Doctrine something new something shiny we've been given the the the the the the best kind of food that's been stored for us amen praise the Lord and that's why we need his presence amen that's why the food tastes so good in this hour because he is here because the Master Chef is here it is not something uh pre-prepared it's not something that's been warned up in a microwave wave amen it is something that came straight from the hands of the Master Chef amen praise the Lord so we know that these ingredients for for for the end time Bride for the seventh course menu they were always available amen because the word was sent God sent his word amen but there were people who couldn't understand who couldn't grasp the new tastes amen couldn't grasp the the the the flavors that were attached to the word of God Amen but until the last day amen there's been a change there's been a people sent amen they are able to receive the word that are able to respond to the word that the word resonates with them it is something that reminds them of things that were before amen because we've got an intelligence we have the mind of Christ in this hour the intelligence of the Master Chef came down amen and he is able amen we are not able we can mix things up with the word of God and we see all of the denominations and you know we sing the song the angel of the Lord told Mary and there is a verse that says there are a thousand denominations right amen but I just checked there are 30 000 denominations wow from just on the basis of one book amen because not knowing the author it will just bring you to a place where you'll mix different things from the word but the result will be death amen but we have the intelligence in this time he knows how to break the word he knows how to take the word and paint a picture before our eyes amen praise the lord we are so thankful for the opening for the opening of the potentials the potentials of of God Amen in this hour so you know like we said you know it's it's maybe it's not been an easy week or or a weekend for us maybe some of our us are tired you know from either traveling or or or just working on the stuff that was broken uh because of the storm you know but we come here on the basis of the word of God we don't come here because we felt so that uh you know we had a wonderful experience maybe uh this morning of of just wanting to come here maybe you're that way but I don't feel that that good amen amen hopefully I just trust in the inspiration of the Lord I've got the shoes of brother Joe so I'll be in the same aspiration as he is amen we are thinking from the same Source we are thinking from the same warehouse amen amen so we need that so we are believing Against All Odds we come here not because we feel so not because uh somebody made us do it amen we come here because we trust God we believe in God Amen we believe that he's the one who who orchestrates everything in our life whether good or bad amen amen he's responsible he is behind the scenes we just want to see him Amen in the time of unrest we see unrest in the world today we see wars and rumors of wars and things going uh you know in a bad Direction chaos all over the world but we have received the message of Shalom amen that is contrary to what the world will tell you it is contrary to what the world will make you feel or say or do or even uh it'll try to occupy your mind to to to think in a certain way uh but we need to go back to the word amen like Abraham he just he just didn't see the things that were supposed to come amen he didn't see the word being uh manifested in his life for him or a number of years amen he just saw the opposite of that he he saw his weakening old body he saw the body of Sarah his wife but yet amen he looked to the Unseen amen he he called the things that were not as if they were amen he saw something with the side of Faith amen we need that sense in this hour praise the Lord so before there was a even a question we as humans we've got lots of questions right amen little children they've got lots of questions uh maybe as adults we've got questions maybe we don't like to share them or voice them but the Lord knows our questions amen but we are so thankful that he is the answer here's the answer to all of our questions he is a good father who provides for his children and before even Eve and Adam they were created God prepared the answer to the queen to the sin question amen isn't that wonderful praise the Lord before they even were here God had his plan ready amen he didn't have to adjust the plan it was just ready to go amen praise the Lord so I believe that we live in a different time and we've heard it throughout the message that is not the time to eat rabbits it's not a a time to Feast on the old manner but we've been given something fresh amen something something that uh the Saints of all they've been waiting for it for so many years for decades for centuries they died in faith believing that they would witness what we witnessed today amen amen many times we need to be reminded of what we've got amen because Satan will try to point us to the things that we have not or we think that we have not that's the way he came to Eve amen he he just uh Eve didn't know her position amen she didn't know her position that was the main problem if she knew his her position she wouldn't have fell amen for the lies of Satan because Satan proposed her something that she already had amen amen she was a daughter of God she was the one that was supposed to bring the Messiah but not in a fallen way but in a holy matrimony praise the Lord amen but she believed that she lacked something amen and if the devil will let us believe that we are in lack of something today that there is something more to come that we need to wait it's not this time than he's got you but there is a prophecy about the anti-bride isn't that wonderful that she will not fall amen we can either believe that or we can argue with the quote we can push the quote you know to the past or to the future but it's it's as simple as accepting it amen isn't that wonderful amen so every verse we see the Bible and explicitly tells us that we need to look at our Bibles at the word of God as a new book amen we need to see it in a different light because he says that every portion of scripture points to Christ amen whether it is the Old Testament or the New Testament it points to Christ amen and then when you follow the revelation of the word you know that Christ and the bride they are one amen so that the next step is to see yourself in the book Amen to realize that every quote every verse every portion of scripture every prophecy every Prophet they were pointing to our day and age it was written and put in the word of God it was written there for for us to learn amen as the Bible says in Romans 5 4 amen praise the Lord it is written for our benefit for our learning amen whatsoever was written in the past was written for our learning amen that we might learn the position that Christ gave unto us amen so I'm just so thankful for the time that we live in amen that we can be in a special State a state of transition amen we are transitioning from the the corruptable to The Incorruptible from the Earthly to the Heavenly from the things that we call real and tangible to the things that are actually real and actually tangible even more so amen praise the Lord so we live in a time of the Rapture and I believe I think you believe that as well that the Rapture is a process amen we can we can focus on many denominations and many people just focus on this one event the changing of our bodies which is which is part of the Rapture but you won't be changed in a twinkling of an eye if you are not in the state of the Rapture beforehand amen if if your inner man is not lifted up to the position that God gave you before the foundation of the world then you better not wait and anticipate this one twinkling of an eye amen it it won't do you any good amen there will be a bunch of people that will leave this earth because they were in a Rapture condition amen it is a set of events like it was in the first coming of Christ so it is with the second coming of Christ it is a set of events amen praise the Lord so we are living in a time of the second coming okay man we are we are living in a time of a process of the Rapture praise the Lord and I believe that the Lord we know that he is eternal he uses time but he is also the master of time amen and he's not so much Focus maybe on on different days people try to you know do their maths and and figure out when will something happen or or or or or or how many years we've got left and stuff like that and if the Lord leads you to that that's fine that's fine but I believe that the Lord in his plan he didn't put like a a giant timetable because he is not bound by time he can do anything he can prolong the time amen we know that we should have been gone from this Earth a long time ago but we are still waiting for somebody amen we are waiting for that last one and many times we we think that the last one that the last seed will be somebody in the streets it'll be somebody that is maybe Bound by alcohol or Bound by drugs or something else but I believe that it can very well be that the last one is here that he wears a suit and a tie and has been coming to church for a long long time maybe for 20 30 years you've been in this church coming but God is waiting for you and we are all waiting for you or maybe you're all waiting for me to realize who who I am amen praise the Lord because brother Brown tells us and we know uh the quote how do you know the Rapture is not going on all the time he just gives a question he doesn't elaborate on it but I believe that we are spiritually minded amen that we can catch this little question amen and we see a picture we see a a process a set of events because uh we know that life is a process amen so God is not so much focused on the dates uh that people are so focused on but he's focused on people on the process amen because life is a process your life is a process his focused on that process amen so the rapture we know that it is something real amen and it may not be visible to the human eye right now we know that eventually will be changed in the twinkling of an eye amen and there are people who recognize that the bride was here that God himself was the one sitting in the pews of the church and they didn't recognize him they will recognize at that day it will become manifest and visible amen but we know that the Rapture is something real it is not an imagination is not uh some wishful thinking it is not something that that is uh you know a a a a a a concept or something that we talk about a Doctrine a man is something real that is going on right now amen it may be going on in your life as as we are talking as we are speaking the Lord is building something inside of you the Assurance of who you are amen and why did you come here to this earth amen we need to have that Assurance amen praise the Lord so God is more concerned about people than dates amen he is concerned about you making the Rapture not just uh sticking to some date that some man did with his uh little mind he did his mass and then he says it should be by that date or that date is the is the day when the Rapture will happen amen we know what is the condition of the rapture it is US knowing who we are amen for everyone says when the bride knows who she is the rapture will go hey man hey man the Rapture will go once she knows who she is I believe that when we are gathered here it's not all about knowledge right amen we know lots of things we've been coming to church I've been in church since my childhood for 28 years I've been in church I've been listening to to the scriptures I've been listening to the revealed word of God but I believe it's not only about listening amen it is not only about knowledge because we've heard enough amen we know enough but it needs to become something else it needs to become substances in in our lives we need to recognize who we are amen and I'm so when we look at the story of Jesus we know that he is the the perfect foreshadow or he is the the perfect one the first fruit of the first coming we know that we can relate to to the coming of Christ amen the first coming of Christ and we can see our day we can see our day and its message amen I was so blessed it's it's maybe not found in the uh in the final chapters of of the gospels but in Luke 2 52 the Bible says that that Jesus increased in wisdom and statue and in favor with God and man amen I believe that's a very powerful quote amen because when brother Branham preached the seals he preached the opening of the seals then after that he tells us just go and live a simple Christian life amen you need to be down to earth you need to make it real in this earth amen you need to grow and increase in in wisdom and statue and in favor with God and man amen that is a process amen that is a process that Christ was in the process of maturing of becoming who he originally was amen praise the Lord hallelujah so many times we think of the Rapture as some sort of an event that we can sign up for or or or make plans to attend you know it's not like that amen otherwise even if you were the elect one you could miss the Rapture amen because we know circumstances you could be flying from Europe because there was a place here in Lima that the Rapture would happen amen and I would be late 24 hours amen amen but I believe that I cannot miss the Rapture amen because the Rapture is a person amen you are the Rapture you need to have the Revelation that I am the Rapture and if the Rapture goes I'm going with it amen the Rapture is not going anywhere without me amen and these are not the words of a man amen these are the words of God a man you can either believe that or just argue with that that's your choice everybody's got their choice amen so we are not going to miss the Rapture amen you are not going to miss that final you know that the plane or the train you know because you are the train you are part of of that train of the of the cars that's been loaded up for years with stocked up with good food amen because Brad Brown tells us that the only thing that we'll take from this Earth to glory is our character amen it's not actually our character how how we are some are slow some are some are fast some are are patients some are impatient some are more energetic some are more stable more more uh more settled amen is not the character that God tells us that we should take from this Earth amen it is his own character because as we've read here in second Peter that by these great promises exceeding great and precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature amen so our character the character that we take from this Earth is actually the divine nature of God amen isn't that wonderful it is not only by the promises not just uh knowing that this will happen but by the Fulfillment of the promises in your life amen you can be a partaker of the divine nature and we know that Peter wrote it in his day but he I believe that it is written for our day amen because he told us that having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen how can you uh Escape corruption this time we see corruption all over amen wherever we go wherever we look we see corruption amen but there is a promise that to those that are partakers of the divine nature that they will escape the corruption amen that they will be part of a group that will escape corruption amen and we know that David in the Psalms in the first coming of Christ he said you will not leave his soul in Hell nor will you allow your Holy One to see corruption amen you've got the same promise amen aren't you glad you've got the same promise as Christ had that he he will be resurrected that he will not see death that his body will be changed it will not dissolve into ashes it will not dissolve into the elements of of of this Earth but you are going to be changed amen by the promises that are made real inside of you amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world Amen that tells us of the Rapture that tells us of the time where there is gross Darkness upon the people amen but there is also light in the land amen there are people who are the light who became the light amen it is a time of trouble but yet in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion the amen that is the rapture message that brother Brown tells us amen now we live in a time of the fullness amen are you glad for that amen because the people before us they couldn't have part in the Rapture amen because they're the the ingredients were there but there was no presence of that Master Chef amen amen and so he needed the people to be able to come to feed on the word of God to experience the journey to experience to get out of their natural thinking to get out of their state of Amnesia and just go to the places where the Master Chef would would show them places familiar places in the word of God Amen so there had to be a people that would be aware of the plan of God amen amen are we aware of the plan of God Amen we are not just knowing the text of the Bible amen we're not we we don't know just the text of the message amen because there are people who are better educated in the word of God than we are than I am amen there are people who are better educated in the message of this hour they know all of the quotes they know all of the passages they can just uh quote it from their mind amen but it's not about knowing the text amen it's about knowing the context amen it's about knowing the whole plan of God Amen that's how you can read the book and you can understand what God is doing amen because you've been given and you are partakers of that divine nature Amen to escape corruption praise the lord we know that Satan's been in every service of brother Brahman amen amen there may be people here who were in The Services of Brahm I was definitely not amen maybe most of you were not but Satan was in every service he attended every service he was the most faithful uh believer in the message of this of that hour amen according to the letter according to the text he knows the text he knows how how to come to you how to quote the message against you he'll try to do it amen if you let him to he'll try to do it but you know the big difference between Satan and you is that he doesn't know the context he doesn't know the whole story amen he was never part of that story amen you were part of that story amen that's why you understand what God is doing in this time amen so we have the promise that the only thing that we'll take from this Earth is our character amen aren't you God Amen will take the character of God With Us amen and a character is the full complexity of God's characteristics amen is the full set of traits of characteristics amen isn't that wonderful when I was reading that you know is not you know God is not from one side he's simple amen but then he's also complex a man in his nature he is also complex amen because we when we see the nature of God when we look around the building when we look at your brother at your sister you see how God's nature is complex it is different you are maybe slow somebody is fast maybe maybe you are uh you pull on the on the trigger real fast somebody it takes him years to do that amen it's the complexity of God's character amen praise the Lord and he wants us to be individuals he wants that complexity of his character to be visible in US amen that you all just go and go to the uh to another country Amen to another culture and not see people who are different who do things differently than I do they do things differently than our church does and then you've got a problem you cannot see God but God expects us whenever you go and his children are gathered he expects us to see his complexity amen the complexity of his character Amen to recognize God Amen in a simple brother and a simple sister maybe uh that does things totally opposite to to what you are used to amen but God loves to hide himself amen praise the Lord so sometimes when you travel you just uh you just encounter different things amen maybe maybe the United States and Poland we are more kind of Western countries and we do most of the things in a similar way there are little differences maybe amen but when you go to Africa when you go to Asia you know sometimes it's totally different amen totally different than you would expect than than you were used to but yet God expects you to see him in the brother and the sister amen on the other continent amen praise the Lord so we know that God is not a man from one side he's simple but yet he is complex amen he wants to manifest himself and we see throughout the scripture we see him manifesting himself under many names amen he was the rose of Sharon he was the lily of the valley he was he was he had the seven compound names of Jehovah he was Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Shalom Jehovah shama and so on and then he was visible and he made himself known as a wheel inside of a wheel uh then then he he appeared as Melchizedek then he came in the form of Jesus Christ so we can see the character of God Amen being complex amen he uses different ways he uses different masks he uses different forms he uses different names say Amen praise the Lord so and many times we as people as we've read here in Exodus we try to ask God you know what is your name amen what is your name because you know us as human beings we just like things to to be um in order you know we want to put okay who are you okay we we ask about the name about where he lives and so on we ask different questions and we we want to have uh the grasp of who God is we want to put him in a little box maybe put him in a chair somewhere and label him that's God Amen so we would know that from this day on that's always God you know and so there is this little box that people have amen called God in their life or their imagination of God Amen and the box is kept locked amen they they lock the Box you know they Trap God inside they know who he is they they find him in the scripture okay that's god let's let's hide him in the Box amen just label him God however we need him we'll just we'll just go to that box we know that he's there amen we know that Israel they have the problem with that amen they were given the Ark of the Covenant amen as a visible representative of the presence of God Amen but then when God changed his place of habitation when he moved from one place to another when he changed his mask they couldn't follow that they were stuck with the same old uh Ark of the Covenant amen till this day they are still looking for it and there are several uh different Arts of the Covenant all over the globe some in Africa some Asia some in Israel amen everybody claims to have the Ark of the Covenant amen they've got the presence of God trapped in a box amen but God is free amen he cannot be bound by a box he cannot be bound by Traditions he cannot be bound by men's ideas amen but us as human beings it's natural we just want to uh see God and realize that's God and always know till the end of our lives that was God that this God and so on but he wants us to follow him amen praise the Lord we know that uh just giving a few examples we know that in Genesis when God was wrestling or or we know that Jacob was wrestling with an angel amen as Genesis 32 29 you don't have to turn to that uh but then Jacob asked him as the angel and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou does ask after my name and he blessed him there amen when you go through the scriptures when you go through the Old Testament you go through the New Testament you see how many times people had questions and God wouldn't answer their questions he would he would seem to answer but he answered to a different question that they never gave amen we see it with the with with the disciples amen they were inquiring about God you know they were inquiring about the future who will be uh who will be the greatest or or if John will uh outlive the Lord and and you know he he will be part of the second coming and you know Jesus never answered he never answered Peter amen he never answered the the disciples because he knew that these were not the kinds of questions that you need answers to amen you need to understand God in his complexity amen you need to follow God wherever he leads whatever mask he uses whatever form he takes you need to be faithful and follow him amen praise the lord we know when the angel came to Manoa that was the father of of Samson in Judges 13 17-18 and Manoa said unto the angel of the Lord what is thy name okay it was not just a question but he said that when thy sayings come to pass we may do the honor so he wanted to worship God he wanted to worship amen and he asked for the name amen and the angel of the Lord which we know that God wasn't that angel amen said unto him why ask us Thou after my name sing it is secret amen so he never gave an answer he never told him the name amen and then we read out of Exodus amen and that that was the first question that Moses had he knew the children of Israel he knew that when he would come to them as the deliverer he uh he didn't have a clean record in Egypt right amen they knew him they knew him so he was trying to prove his ministry by asking the Lord to provide him with the name amen Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and Chase shall say unto them the god of your fathers send me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name amen another human question what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses amen we know that Moses was the elect one amen he told him I am that I am and he said does shall thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you amen so God was actually not revealing the name it was not a name I am that I am he was revealing more of his nature amen of who he is and I was so blessed by by reading a little bit and and digging inside what that means in the original I am that I am amen because that reveals something about God's nature amen it's the I am the present one amen it is the I am that I am amen the one that doesn't change Hallelujah he takes different forms he's the different masks but yet he stays the same amen then another translation is I am the existing one I'm Eternal I am the ever present God the ever-present water from the Rock and then I was really uh blessed by this other translation it says that actually I am that I am is translated I will become who I choose to become amen that is the title of my message and that's that's what we want to uh delve into for a while amen I will become who I choose to become amen it was so powerful to me amen I will become whosoever I please to become amen that just shows you how Sovereign God is amen you cannot use the letter to see God you cannot uh search the scriptures and find god with the letter amen because he is always changing amen he's always changing his mask he is always changing his forms he's changing his names amen but there are some who have that Heavenly Instinct amen they've got the gene of God amen that tells them that's God Amen that they can follow God wherever he goes amen they are not stuck with their own form with their own tradition with their own understanding it may be a very good understanding based on the message of this hour but whenever God tells you to move and he he switches places he switches The Mask he expects you to follow amen praise the Lord so he in other words he told Moses Moses if the people want to know my name tell them that I cannot be labeled amen I cannot be put in a box a man for future reference amen I'm not the type of a God I'm not a god of Egypt I'm not the god of of wood stone or whatever other material amen I Am The Sovereign God that I am and I will become who I want to become amen you just follow me praise the Lord unless you become partakers of God's nature amen you cannot see God amen because it is the nature of God becoming who he pleases to become the nature of God is to be Sovereign amen he is a sovereign God amen so we see that that Israel they they wanted to know the name of God and so they knew just God on a superficial level they just knew God in his acts when he would perform great Miracles when he would part the Red Sea when he would give them Quail give them uh food Manna in this season that's when they saw God they saw him in his actions when he was thundering from the mountain they knew it was God he they they knew that he was the one who gave them the Ten Commandments and all of the other Commandments amen but they didn't know him in his ways amen and in Psalms 103 maybe I I'd like to ask you to turn to that amen it's Psalms 103. verse 7. because there is a difference in the way God revealed himself to Moses and the way he revealed himself to the children of Israel amen the Psalms 103 verse 7 he made known his ways to Moses amen he revealed his plan to Moses and his acts unto the children of Israel amen so the children of Israel whenever they saw the manifestation of God they said that's God amen when they didn't see the manifestation when there was a time of a a drought of of tribulation of going through the desert of of not uh basically being excited about the Exodus they couldn't see God they they wanted the visible form of God they told Aaron okay now you create a God for us like you create a God that will lead us that that will be visible and he will lead us back to Egypt amen they just knew God when they saw him Amen in the acts amen whatever he did whether from The Rock okay that's God and that lasted for I don't know how many days or hours amen that kind of a revelation will not last long amen we need to have a stable Revelation brother and sister amen we need to have the revelation of the ways how God operates how he does things Amen in this hour we need to be so vigilant Amen to see the move of the spirit amen so Moses he knew God in another way amen he knew God because he sawed his face amen he wasn't just looking for his hands what he had if he had Manna or he had Quail or he had water or or he had uh good clothes or or he was providing them with whatever they needed they didn't lack for anything amen God was taking care of Israel amen but the relationship that he had with Moses once was on a totally different basis amen amen he was different amen actually the Bible tells us that the Lord would speak to Moses face to face as one speaks to a friend amen he didn't speak with any others that same way amen he spoke with Moses amen and Moses knew God's character you can see it in the Bible when God became angry we actually see uh the behind the scenes amen maybe maybe maybe Israelites they they weren't uh they were stuck in their own thinking they didn't realize what was going on behind the scenes but behind the scenes God was mad amen he was mad at the children that he brought out of Egypt amen but God made himself known to Moses in a different way amen Moses knew the ways of the Lord that's why he could reason with the Lord that's why he could tell him Lord that is unlike your character I know your character I know that you're loving that you are patient that you don't want to do it amen isn't that a special relationship that he said he had a man praise the Lord so he knew the plan of God amen and whenever things went in a bad Direction amen we see Moses he was appealing to God's traits Amen to his character he knew who God was amen he didn't just know him uh by by the breaking of bread or you know the the breaking of the man of sending of quails he didn't know him only in that way he knew him in a in a much more profound way amen praise the Lord that's the relationship that God expects to have with us Amen to not see him when everybody sees him amen there is there will be a time when people all over the globe whether they are uh maybe message Believers or or denominational folk or some other uh kind maybe they are not even Christian they will realize that God was here on Earth and now he is gone they will recognize that amen but we need to recognize God now amen what he is doing amen and in First John 3 1-2 let's open it together do you love the Lord amen I will become who I choose to become amen let's just bear it in our minds amen first John chapter 3 verses one and two behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed unto us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen praise the Lord so we just see what was written here that it does not yet appear what we shall be but we are sure of one thing that we will be like him will be in His image amen praise the Lord so we remember the story of of Saul uh of of tarshas of of Paul we know that he on the basis of the scripture he wasn't ignorant amen he knew the scripture because he was a Pharisee out of the Pharisees he was one of the the brightest Minds when it came to the Pharisees in their day amen that's why he could prove through the scriptures the coming of the Messiah amen he could prove basing himself on the letter of the law he knew everything about the Messiah the coming of Messiah amen but what he didn't have he didn't have the revelation of who he is in the present amen that's why when he when he met the pillar of fire amen and the pillar of fire threw him out of his horse and and then there was a question given so so why do you persecute me amen and it was out of the frame of his understanding out of the frame of his theology how could the pillar of fire and and and and the voice of Jesus and then connecting it with the church he wasn't amen he was just basing his Revelation on the law amen that's why he he couldn't see God Amen that's why he became blind amen and he had to go to one of the members of the body of Christ to one of those that He persecuted and he want he had to ask him amen for his side back Hallelujah he had to ask amen the part of the body of Christ to see again to see God Amen Hallelujah so we know that that when the prophet uh was ananias oh no yeah ananias when he prayed for Saul he asked God that he would heal him and the first person amen that's all Saul amen he asked the Lord maybe he was fearful but he asked the Lord make this Pharisee out of the Pharisees may he see you in the present day amen and when he prayed that prayer and his eyes were open he didn't see uh Jesus of Galilee amen Paul didn't see Jesus of Galilee he saw ananias amen why are you persecuting me Hallelujah amen praise the Lord so we know that we we read here in John and we can read it in in the Epistles of of Paul and Peter and so on that they they they knew God for their age they knew the unveiling of God but yet they they they were sure that there was coming a day of the full unveiling of God's attributes amen that's why John wrote it does not yet appear okay it does not yet appear he was the type of the Bride he was the one who who who laid his head on the chest of Jesus but then he says it does not yet appear so he didn't know it back then but what he was sure of that we shall be like him amen we shall be like him for his we shall see him as he is amen when is the time coming amen is there any more time coming are we expecting another generation are we expecting another church age are we expecting uh hundreds of of years edit I believe that it will it is shorter than that I believe the time is at hand I believe the time is right now amen it is the time when God himself is on Earth amen praise the Lord so God has been saying for years I am that I am I will become who I choose to become he was revealing his nature amen praise the Lord in other words you will be amazed when you see how I chose to hide myself amen you'll be amazed you'll be surprised amen bear brown tells us that we'll be surprised about many things amen even going to the uh to the other side when we see the people that are there will be surprised by the people that are there and will be surprised by by the people that won't be there yeah amen so he was saying you all see at the very end who I am that will be the final revelation of who I am amen maybe you thought I was just I was Melchizedek giving communion to Abraham maybe you thought I was the pillar of fire that met Paul maybe maybe you thought I was the Holy Spirit that filled the Believers in the days of Pentecost and that is all true but now he is an ever-present God Amen and we need to watch him when he becomes something else amen it may be contrary to our thinking it may be contrary to what we expect what we imagine what religion uh tries to impose on us amen is very different that's why we need to just yield to the Lord amen may he be the guide amen not my will but yours be done amen may I see you father and the full maturity amen the full maturity will be shown at the very end amen now we are at the very end amen I will become what I choose to become Hallelujah beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear I'm I believe that's our time we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he is amen at the very end it turns out who he always been who he is now amen that there are people that are not only similar to him but are like him amen they are him Hallelujah all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church amen and you'll be amazed when you see me God says I am that I am you'll be amazed when you see how I choose to become or who I choose to become amen praise the Lord so God is suffering we see that he does whatever he wants amen I am that I am praise the Lord you don't have to ask anybody for permission amen he doesn't ask have to ask all of the people the the religious folks or or the theologians would it be proper for God to hide himself in the people such as this amen he didn't do it in his first coming he never consulted anybody amen about the way he came that he came he was born in a manger wrapped in swaddling curves amen but he chose to do it amen to show his sovereignty amen not only his name but his nature we you know there are so many names of God Amen there are so many names of God today amen but we need to see his nature amen praise the Lord and that is a powerful quote that's earnestly contending for the Fate that was once delivered to the Saints Iran says now if you are not born again you do not believe in the Supernatural and if you do not believe in the Supernatural you haven't been born again because when you are born again you become a son of God and he will being a Son of God you are the nature of God amen and there he continues and he says and then you take on things and you want to see the moving of God you want to see how God will move because you're his son and You're Made In His Image and you're born of his Spirit you are a part of him amen and then you've got faith for everything Hallelujah when you realize that you are part of God that you are a part partaker of God's nature amen then you take on the things amen you live a normal Christian life amen you just go to work you just face the responsibilities you just face the circumstances why because you want to see the moving of God you realize that he's part of you then you are excited to meet the problems to face the problems within the week and then see the salvation of the Lord amen isn't it wonderful isn't it comforting when you when we know and realize the nature of God Amen praise the Lord he can fill your shoes amen amen he can he can borrow whatever you give to his hands right amen he will do it and then he will go in the power of your might amen you know God he did one thing he said that he would be faithful to his word amen amen he may not be faithful to his form he may not be faithful to his mask amen but he is always faithful to his word amen praise the Lord amen so we see Jesus in the first coming amen and I'm I'm closing in a while amen we see the first coming of Christ we see Jesus and he wanted the people he wanted the disciples amen disciples is not only those that just follow follow orders or or follow the master but disciples are actually people who are learning amen amen that go through a certain process of discipline of of knowledge of acquiring knowledge amen praise the Lord so he spent three and a half years of his ministry just uh teaching the disciples not to not just to see him by the breaking of bread not just to see him by the way he did the Miracles amen but he wanted them to see him in his ways amen praise the Lord he he said I'll be using throughout the ages even throughout my Ministry I will be using different masks but you not focus on the mask you just focus on the one who's behind the mask amen because God never promised that he would be faithful to a mask amen he promised that he would be faithful to himself he said I swore by myself amen by my word you can see it in the ministry of Jesus he never taught the disciples that he would operate in the same way over and over and over again amen it's just an example of of of people being blind in the Bible amen and their Encounters of Jesus Amen and we are just going to go through it very quickly in in Matthew 9 27 and 20 and 30 there are two Blind Men that approached the master you know and what did Jesus do he touched their eyes and he said Let It Be according to your faith amen then we see in Mark chapter 8. amen Mark chapter 8 verses 22-25 that was the blind man at Bethesda amen and this time he didn't touch the guy he didn't touch his eyes he just spat in his face a man in his eyes what a weird way to perform a miracle amen we know that the disciples they were shocked they didn't know what was happening if it's the same Jesus or it's somebody else amen but Jesus wanted to teach them teach the disciples that he will be changing his forms he'll be changing his masks and now never focus on the mass never focus on the way he's been doing it maybe he's been doing that in your life for a certain period of time but be open to see God doing and Performing things in a different way hey amen praise the Lord then we see in Mark chapter 10 just two chapters further 51 and 52 he didn't touch the blind man he just spoke the word amen he didn't touch him amen he didn't say any special phrase he didn't mention his faith amen Go and Let it Be according to your faith he didn't say that amen it was just a spoken word no touching amen and we know there was the pool of Siloam amen that's in John chapter 9 verses 6 and 7. this time he spat on the ground made mud put it on the guy's eyes and he told him to go wash himself another way the same God dealing with the same problem in different ways amen showing to us that we shouldn't Focus so much on the acts we should focus on the ways we should understand the nature of God we should be partakers of the nature of God Amen he isn't faithful to his mask amen he's faithful to his word hallelujah he doesn't he doesn't make copies amen God doesn't open a manufacturing nothing like that God is an original whatever he feels like doing he just does it he doesn't have to have to you for permission he doesn't ask have to ask me or some other person for permission he'll just do it amen because he's sovereign and he'll tell you that's my nature I will become who I want to become amen you just follow me hallelujah praise the Lord he is the god of amore amen he is the god that changes masks amen but what the problem the problem today is that people even they are so close they are in the message of this hour and they they've seen they've known God under a certain mask under under a certain form and they just they just worship the form they just worship The Mask amen and there was a time when God was behind the mask and that was the right amen but now God wants to move on he wants to change his mask he wants to change his form why because he can amen because he is God because he's Sovereign amen and he knows that you will not be lost he knows that he put something on the inside of you that will follow him wherever he is despite of the form despite of the Mask amen praise the Lord isn't that wonderful I will become what I choose to become you'll be surprised in other words you'll be shocked amen we know the Pharisees they were shocked amen they were shocked in the first coming of Christ amen now people are also shocked amen but God is Sovereign he doesn't need to impress anybody amen he didn't care that he was he he came here to this earth wrapped in swaddling clothes and and in a very questionable way and a very questionable uh situation with Mary not having a husband and having a baby you know as God you could think of a better way to come amen and we know that the Pharisees already had away amen they had their red carpet ready they had their I know the the ladder or whatever they they imagined it to be they were ready to welcome the king Amen to pay respects to to the one that formed the heavens and the Earth but he decided to do something else he decided to surprise them amen amen you don't have to impress anybody and then the way he died amen he died on a on a Roman cross amen what a terrible way to die surely there must have been better Ways to Die amen he could have died in his sleep amen well what we call a a royal death amen I don't know if you call it that you know without suffering you just lay asleep and you just never wake up you wake up on the other side amen so he could have you know in our words we could say you know we could fix the plan amen and people have always tried to fix the plan of God Amen there was all sorts of ideas and theologies and ways amen God is not interested amen he doesn't have to account to no one amen even to us sometimes we know what happened with brother Branham amen when he prayed for a sick person and the person never never received their healing and he told God God you owe me an explanation I've been I've been following your word I've been following uh the things that you laid out in the scripture like it always worked but you just see the sovereignty of God that he didn't have to account to no one even the prophet for this age amen many times we feel we feel that we are special and we are but we are not more special than Gods amen God doesn't have to account to your little brain and this little box called God that is in your brain amen God can totally ignore that box amen and he will amen praise the Lord he doesn't have to abide by Amendment man-made rules amen he's not bound he he doesn't have to be bound by Traditions amen amen he is a free spirit in this time amen he just moves wherever he wants he does whatever he wants and he becomes who he desires to become amen he cannot be bound anymore he was bound for a long long time because there were people that didn't believe the word of God there are people that couldn't understand him in his ways amen that's why he was bound but he is released Amen in the full power the full potential amen of the word of God and he cannot be bound amen because there there is a group of people here that know him amen and the power of of his ways amen they know his character they know the context they they are they know the text amen there's the right to know the text of the scripture but they know the whole story they know they are part of the same story amen praise the Lord so he let you become a partaker of his very nature amen that is a gift amen as the greatest gift there were exceedingly great promises given to us by virtue of which amen we are partakers of his nature amen by the fulfilling of the promises for this age we became partakers of the nature of God Amen isn't that wonderful isn't God truly wonderful to us amen let's stand we'll be closing Us in soon amen but this quote is so powerful amen earnestly contending for the faith we read it then you take on things because you want to see the moving of God you want to see God move amen once you become the nature of God then you are eager to go out because you know who is inside of you amen you know that with him you can face anything and then you you want to be excited about it you want to be excited about how God moves in my life amen let us be excited about that amen if God has your legs he has your hands he has your feet your ears your eyes amen amen you want to see God move amen don't look for external forms just go in the power of your mind you became part of his nature now go take on the things that are in the world Amen praise the Lord go and face circumstances don't fear don't avoid facing circumstances amen be
