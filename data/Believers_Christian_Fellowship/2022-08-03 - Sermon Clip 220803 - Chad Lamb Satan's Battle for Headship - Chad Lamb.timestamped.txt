[0:00] david wasn't looking at his eyes
[0:04] the only thing he heard
[0:06] when when that philistine boasted
[0:09] was a challenge against the word of god
[0:13] everybody else saw a challenge against
[0:16] their person
[0:18] and they saw themselves versus goliath
[0:22] david saw god versus goliath
[0:26] this is why it's good to know who you
[0:28] are and whose side you're on and who's
[0:30] in you amen to know that you're a child
[0:32] of god standing for the word of god if
[0:34] you don't have that settled you'll never
[0:36] win a battle because you're looking at
[0:38] yourself versus this devil you're
[0:39] looking at yourself versus this sickness
[0:41] yourself versus this situation amen but
[0:44] when you realize that something contrary
[0:46] to the word is coming and challenging
[0:48] the word in your life challenging
[0:50] whether this word is true or not
[0:52] challenging whether or not he's the same
[0:54] yesterday today forever challenging
[0:56] whether or not he already paid for
[0:58] healing when he died on calvary
[0:59] challenging whether or not biased
[1:01] stripes are already healed when you
[1:03] think it's you amen fighting against
[1:05] this challenge amen you'll do the same
[1:07] thing the israelites do hide out in the
[1:09] tent and hope it goes away
[1:12] but if we can go like david and say i
[1:15] have been i mean i am a part of the
[1:18] circumcision i'm part of israel i'm part
[1:20] of the chosen i have a seal of god in my
[1:23] life and furthermore i've been anointed
[1:25] for this day amen because the anointing
[1:27] is on the bride to overcome in this day
[1:30] so i've been anointed to the word i mean
[1:33] i've been anointed to defy the armies of
[1:36] the enemy and when something comes in i
[1:38] don't have to run and hide and hope it
[1:40] goes away all i need to do is say amen
[1:43] the god who's delivered me from this and
[1:45] deliver me from that and deliver me from
[1:46] this will deliver me from this also
[1:49] because it's nothing more than a
[1:51] challenge against the word of god and
[1:54] i'm here representing the word of god i
[1:56] am a representative of the very
[1:58] manifested word of god and this
[2:01] philistine this demon is challenging the
[2:04] word of god not challenging me as a
[2:06] person
[2:08] david as a person was no match for
[2:11] goliath as a person
[2:14] and you as a human being are no match
[2:16] for a devil
[2:19] these devils have been around amen for
[2:21] thousands and thousands of years amen
[2:23] their chief captain is perfect in wisdom
[2:28] they have been deceiving mankind for
[2:30] thousands of years you and your
[2:32] intellect are zero match for a devil
[2:36] that's why you can't look at yourself
[2:38] and fight an enemy you can't you can't
[2:41] take the devil's challenge and withstand
[2:43] him when you look at yourself you have
[2:45] to see that this devil is attacking the
[2:48] word of god that's supposed to be
[2:51] manifesting in my flesh
[2:54] because god wants his word on display
[2:57] and he wants it on display in his body
[2:59] and you have to know where that body is
[3:01] who that body is and know that you're a
[3:03] member of that body and if you know that
[3:05] you're a member of that body now it's
[3:07] not you fighting the devil amen it's the
[3:10] word of god through you fighting that
[3:12] devil
