TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he called you to have fellowship with him he created you amen to for his purpose amen to yield yourself to him to walk in his presence to be yielded unto him to be sacrificed yourself unto him and be in a relationship with him that gives him the fellowship that he desires and through that walk he will do everything that he has promised that he will do in your life he has done everything that he has already determined that he will do in your life but i think sometimes we get so fixated on the outcomes and the fruit abraham for a period of time was fixated on producing a son because god said you'll produce a sign so now he had to produce a sign and that pressure got into sarah and then sarah thought of the a whole scheme of haggard and all of those things it all came from pressure to perform the word but god comes down and he takes all the pressure away and says i'll confirm the covenant i have said i have made you a father nation so now i will make you fruitful i am confirming my covenant you're not abraham you're not abram you're abraham i never promised to do this for abram i promise to do it for abraham and i never was going to do it for a church member amen i was never going to make a church member fruit florida nominational member or just another good person i was only going to do it for my bride so i've got to come down in a covenant and say why don't you just walk before me amen walk in my presence and be perfect i'm coming to confirm the word you're not a church member you're not a member of bcf amen you're not part of the message your bride because your bride i promise that through you will fulfill everything that's promised of the virgin in the last day so now i will make you have faith i will make you believe i will make you surrender i will make you yield praise be to god friends see this is why i love this message this message takes me and puts me in my flesh my my carnal being as helpless and hopeless it is and puts it in the right spot instead of trying to force that guy to be something it will never be it lets it be what it is hybrid lost amen in need of a total transformation [Music] and it allows the that attribute of god that's down in me that seed of god that allows that to be the true identification that identify with and it allows me to surrender to god and believe that all things are possible because i'm not looking at this anymore i'm looking down at this
