[12:33] Jesus Christ's name amen and while we're
[12:37] standing let's take our bibles if we
[12:39] could together and turn to 1 Corinthians
[12:41] chapter
[12:43] 12 we're going to continue on from last
[12:45] Wednesday's service we we preached on
[12:48] members of the body the purpose of the
[12:50] fivefold ministry and now we're going to
[12:52] take part two members of the body a
[12:53] purpose for each and so I really I was
[12:58] going to cram a whole bunch into today
[13:00] like I typically do and I just made
[13:02] myself stop amen today while I was
[13:04] meditating and praying I said you know
[13:06] what we're not going to cram it all in
[13:07] this Wednesday night we're going to take
[13:09] our time we're going to have a good
[13:10] oldfashioned Bible study amen so I I I I
[13:14] tend to bite off more than I can Che but
[13:16] we ask God to just direct us now but
[13:18] let's look at 1 Corinthians chap 12
[13:21] verse
[13:23] 27 says now ye are the body of Christ
[13:28] and me members in particular may may God
[13:31] bless us as we look at his word as
[13:33] you're
[13:34] seated amen I want to say I appreciate
[13:36] it the Special appreciate the Abbott
[13:38] family for for doing that appreciate
[13:41] brother John for helping them get out of
[13:42] their comfort
[13:44] zone everybody has to do their part
[13:47] amen uh I want to say too that brother
[13:49] Danny dundo left this morning he had to
[13:51] extend his trip by a little bit so we
[13:53] drove him down to the airport this
[13:54] morning he got on a plane and headed
[13:56] down to Charlotte he's got a few stops
[13:58] to make he'll be preaching for brother
[13:59] Homer Longoria this weekend then he'll
[14:02] be flying out a week from today so just
[14:04] remember him in his travels and as he
[14:06] goes back home and I just want to say
[14:08] how much I appreciated that service
[14:12] loose for the Master's use amen and I
[14:15] appreciate how it tied in with Wednesday
[14:17] and and hopefully we can build off of
[14:18] that by the grace of God and we just
[14:20] love to see the continuity of the spirit
[14:22] and how encouraging that was that we've
[14:24] been loosed for a purpose amen we've
[14:26] been loosed for the Master's use and
[14:29] mean we know that God redeemed us we
[14:30] know that God saved us we know in this
[14:32] generation he he opened up the mystery
[14:34] that was in his mind so that we could
[14:36] see amen who we really are amen that he
[14:39] took away the veil that had been even
[14:41] over the seven Church ages so that we
[14:43] can finally see further than they've
[14:45] ever been able to see all the way back
[14:46] to the hidden Mystery that was in the
[14:48] back part of God's mind amen and God had
[14:51] such a display in this generation and
[14:53] and in this age to show us and to
[14:55] vindicate amen the ministry of brother
[14:57] brandham but then we come down to it and
[14:59] it's all going to be why what for what
[15:01] was the purpose what did God want to do
[15:03] amen it all has to do with something
[15:05] about us here
[15:06] today God wants to show himself through
[15:09] a many membered body he wants to express
[15:11] himself and reflect himself on the earth
[15:13] through the body amen so we want to find
[15:17] each of us our place in that body and
[15:19] that's what we want to spend time on
[15:21] this evening and the me and the message
[15:23] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[15:25] brother B says and his church stands
[15:27] alone she is is not hooked with nothing
[15:30] but he was identified by God being the
[15:32] body that God dwelt in and the church is
[15:35] identified by his body doing the same
[15:37] thing she is his
[15:40] body the manifested truth of his
[15:43] promised word for the last day and she
[15:46] and she alone stands by it amen she is
[15:49] his body which is what the manifested
[15:52] truth of his promised word for the last
[15:54] day this is the day we live in amen this
[15:57] is the purpose amen the message come to
[15:59] unveil this and then in the message
[16:02] Christ again Christ is revealed in his
[16:04] own word he says and he's govern the
[16:06] body all the way through then the
[16:08] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[16:11] the form of a bride that was taken out
[16:13] of his side like Adam's was rather at
[16:16] the beginning amen so what's it come
[16:18] down to it's come down to the complete
[16:20] body of Jesus Christ amen revealed in
[16:23] the form of a bride amen that's the part
[16:26] you and I are fleshing out in this day
[16:28] amen amen amen and that's we want to be
[16:31] faithful to them if we can go back to
[16:33] Ephesians chapter 4 we'll come back to 1
[16:36] Corinthians 12 but let's go to
[16:38] Ephesians uh 4 and I want to review this
[16:41] from last
[16:42] time last time we talked about the
[16:44] purpose of the fful ministry and we
[16:46] start off by saying we we have had such
[16:48] a defense of the fful ministry uh in the
[16:51] end time because it's come under attack
[16:54] and so we're very familiar with the fact
[16:56] that God has a fful Ministry that that
[16:58] God has a purpose for the fful ministry
[17:01] that they are the the dress Weare of
[17:03] Christ the inside dress of Christ and we
[17:06] know that that's the ministry of Christ
[17:07] through those five offices and and we
[17:09] believe all that but we wanted to look
[17:11] at what is the fivefold ministry for
[17:13] what's the purpose of the fful ministry
[17:16] so when we look at this let's go to
[17:17] verse
[17:18] 11 and say and read here chapter 4: 11
[17:23] of Ephesians and he gave some Apostles
[17:25] and some prophets and some evangelists
[17:28] and some pastors and teachers for this
[17:31] is where we get into the purpose for the
[17:34] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[17:36] the ministry for the edifying of the
[17:39] body of Christ amen so we find out that
[17:42] the fful ministry is for the perfecting
[17:45] or the this word perfecting means
[17:46] equipping for the equipping of the
[17:49] Saints so the fivefold ministry is
[17:50] supposed to equip the
[17:52] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[17:55] the edifying or building up of the body
[17:57] of Christ a amen so we find that the
[17:59] fful ministry is here Amen to equip the
[18:02] Saints and to build up the body right
[18:05] amen verse 13 till we all come in the
[18:08] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[18:12] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[18:14] this word perfect now means a full age
[18:15] complete amen or mature until we come
[18:18] into a perfect man unto the measure of
[18:20] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[18:23] that we henceforth be no more children
[18:24] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[18:26] every wind of Doctrine by the light of
[18:28] men and the cunning craftiness but
[18:30] whereby they lie and wait to deceive but
[18:33] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[18:35] into him and all things which is the
[18:37] head even Christ from whom from the head
[18:40] from Christ from whom the whole body
[18:43] fitly joined together and compacted by
[18:46] that which every joint supplieth
[18:48] according to the effectual working in
[18:50] the measure of every part making
[18:52] increase of the body unto the edifying
[18:55] of itself and love amen we come down to
[18:59] verse 16 and and as we mentioned last
[19:01] time 16 becomes the conclusion of the
[19:03] matter what was the fivefold ministry
[19:06] given for amen it lists all these things
[19:08] for the perfecting of the Saints the
[19:09] work of the ministry edifying of the
[19:11] body of Christ until we all come into
[19:14] the unity of the faith to the knowledge
[19:15] of the Son of God to a perfect or fully
[19:17] mature man to the stature of a perfect
[19:19] man amen but when we get down to verse
[19:21] 16 says who the whole body now we're
[19:23] talking about the body again fitly that
[19:26] means tightly joined together and
[19:28] compacted that means knit together or
[19:30] coales compacted by that which every
[19:33] joint supplieth according to the
[19:35] effectual working and the measure of
[19:37] every part making increase of the body
[19:41] unto the edifying of itself in love amen
[19:45] all of a sudden we realized the fold
[19:47] Ministry was here to get each of us to
[19:50] do our
[19:52] job for the equip us to to to build up
[19:57] the body to keep us from being tossed
[20:01] about by every wind of Doctrine but that
[20:03] we speak the truth in love and that we
[20:05] would be edified till we become till
[20:08] every joint fitly joined together and
[20:11] compacted by that which every joint
[20:13] every connection supplieth and to the
[20:16] measure of every part amen can you say
[20:18] every part part okay who is every part
[20:22] raise your hand amen this is every part
[20:25] now the scripture is talking about me
[20:27] amen the purpose of the fful ministry is
[20:30] to get to where every joint suppli till
[20:32] every part to the measure of every part
[20:34] making increase of the body or building
[20:37] the body unto the edifying of itself in
[20:40] love then all of a sudden we realize
[20:43] that now we are all responsible for the
[20:46] building of the body of Christ to the
[20:47] edifying of the body of Christ building
[20:49] itself together in love now the
[20:52] responsibility is shifted it's not just
[20:54] the five offices that are responsible
[20:57] for making the whole body it's every
[20:59] joint every member every part so now we
[21:03] all have one goal one purpose one thing
[21:05] that we're working on and we're all
[21:06] working to build the body of Jesus
[21:09] Christ on Earth to manifest and display
[21:12] him in Bride form amen and we're not
[21:15] here to do to be a solo act amen I'm not
[21:17] here to do it all on my own and be
[21:19] everything myself amen because we're
[21:21] here to coales to cohese to knit
[21:24] together to be every joint that's Supply
[21:26] it amen to be every part
[21:28] the measure of every part amen building
[21:32] itself amen so we we learn that the fful
[21:37] ministry is not here to become
[21:40] celebrities to become showman amen the
[21:43] fful ministry is here to perfect the
[21:45] Saints to equip the Saints to build up
[21:47] the body to give the tools to give the
[21:49] correct teaching to speak the truth in
[21:51] love amen so that every member can take
[21:54] their place and every member can work
[21:56] towards one goal and and that's building
[21:58] the body of Christ now every single one
[22:01] of us are responsible to build the body
[22:03] of Jesus Christ we can't just sit idly
[22:06] by and say well they'll do it the
[22:08] ministry will do it and this one will do
[22:10] it and the officers of the church will
[22:11] do it that's not what the scripture is
[22:13] telling us amen the purpose of the
[22:14] fivefold ministry was to get me to do
[22:18] it to equip me to empower me Amen to to
[22:22] to bring me into maturity so that I can
[22:25] do that Amen in my measure and in my
[22:28] part amen praise
[22:30] God so so that's that's what we spoke
[22:35] about last
[22:37] time praise God now I want to go back
[22:41] into the gifts because I touched on it
[22:43] but we Bree through it but I don't want
[22:44] to Breeze through it I want to spend a
[22:46] little bit of time so if you'll turn
[22:48] with me uh to um let's go to uh 1
[22:53] Corinthians chapter
[22:56] 12
[23:06] actually I'm sorry I'm sorry go back to
[23:08] Ephesians we'll come back to this but I
[23:10] wanted to do like I did last time and
[23:11] pick up the beginning part of Ephesians
[23:13] so we can set the context and as we're
[23:15] going there I want to read this quote
[23:17] from 1957 when he says and then Jesus
[23:20] came so but God has set in the church
[23:22] five different gifts Apostles prophets
[23:24] teachers evangelists pastors those are
[23:26] for the perfecting of the church
[23:28] that is his proof his ministering
[23:30] spirits to the church to bring the body
[23:33] of Christ together so what's the purpose
[23:35] to bring the body of Christ together now
[23:39] we read from Ephesians 11 on to 16 but
[23:42] let's go back amen and set the context
[23:45] before we read this in verse one chapter
[23:48] 4:1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[23:51] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[23:52] vocation wherewith you are called with
[23:55] all loneliness and meekness with long
[23:58] suffering forbearing one another in love
[24:01] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[24:03] spirit in the bond of Peace there is one
[24:07] body one SP and one Spirit even as you
[24:10] are called in one hope of your calling
[24:12] one Lord One Faith one baptism one God
[24:15] and Father of all who is above all and
[24:17] through all and in you all but unto
[24:21] every one of us is given Grace according
[24:23] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[24:26] amen wherefore
[24:28] he saith when he ascended up on high he
[24:30] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[24:33] unto men so all of a sudden the
[24:35] precursor to what we just read if we
[24:37] back up amen Paul is telling us let us
[24:39] with all loneliness and meekness
[24:41] forebear one another let's work together
[24:44] and with to one another in love amen
[24:47] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[24:49] spirit in the bond of Peace for there's
[24:51] one body one what's he doing he's
[24:53] showing Unity he's showing Oneness he's
[24:55] showing what the body should be and what
[24:57] we all should be endeavoring to be amen
[25:01] we should all be laboring and working
[25:02] and endeavoring amen for one body amen
[25:05] and that that works in a local body but
[25:08] it's the global Body of Christ too we
[25:10] should be endeavoring to keep the unity
[25:12] and the bond of Peace amen amen amen we
[25:15] should be working for that amen laboring
[25:17] for that not just waiting until somehow
[25:20] it magically happens but but we should
[25:22] be endeavoring to do
[25:24] that amen and he shows that there's a
[25:27] Unity there's one Lord One Faith one
[25:29] baptism one God and Father of all who's
[25:31] above all through all and in you
[25:34] all but unto every one of us now we come
[25:37] to the members in particular but unto
[25:40] every one of us is given Grace according
[25:42] to the measure of the gift of Christ
[25:44] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[25:46] on high he led captivity and gave gifts
[25:48] unto men so now each of us have a
[25:51] deposit there's a Unity there's a one
[25:52] body but each member has a deposit a
[25:55] deposit of the gift of Grace yeah now
[25:58] what are we supposed to do with that
[26:00] amen that's the question we've been all
[26:02] given amen a deposit of the gift of
[26:04] Grace what should we do with it keep it
[26:06] to ourselves be happy that we got it or
[26:08] is this is this deposit for
[26:11] me nope it's for the body amen that's
[26:15] why it's been given to me amen we're
[26:17] going to see that as we go on let's jump
[26:19] over now to First
[26:22] Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter
[26:26] 12
[26:33] and brother Frank if you could pull up
[26:35] the Whiteboard I'm going to use the
[26:36] whiteboards again
[26:38] tonight in in verse 12 or chapter
[26:42] 12:4 now there are diversities of gifts
[26:46] but the same spirit and there are
[26:48] differences of administrations but the
[26:50] same lord and there are diversities of
[26:53] operations but is the same God which
[26:56] worketh all and in all but the
[26:59] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[27:01] every man to profit with all so the
[27:05] manifestation of spirit is given to each
[27:07] one what's it given to each one for to
[27:09] profit everybody amen this isn't just
[27:12] for me this is for everybody now when we
[27:14] look at verse four it says there's
[27:16] diversity of gifts then verse 5
[27:19] difference of
[27:20] administrations then verse six diversity
[27:23] of operations this word diversity
[27:26] difference and divers ities is all the
[27:29] same Greek word and this Greek word if
[27:31] we go to the dictionary to the um strong
[27:33] concordance it says a distinction
[27:36] arising from a different distribution to
[27:39] different persons so what's he saying
[27:42] there's a distribution given different
[27:45] distributions to different per persons
[27:48] it means it's not all the same let's
[27:50] just put in Layman Stern it's not cookie
[27:51] cutter it's not Stamped Out in like a
[27:54] production line you get this you get
[27:56] this you get this but it's diverse amen
[27:58] it's it's a different distribution to
[28:00] different purp persons so there's a
[28:03] there there is let's go back and say
[28:04] there's a diversity of gifts there's
[28:07] differences of administration and
[28:09] there's diversity of operations amen
[28:13] amen so if we could look at at this word
[28:17] administrations it means service or the
[28:21] way it's ministered ministered to others
[28:24] so there's a diversity or differences or
[28:27] a different distribution to different
[28:29] per
[28:30] persons of the gifts but it's one
[28:34] Spirit there's differences of ministry
[28:37] the way that it's ministered way that it
[28:39] serves the body is
[28:42] different and there's diversity of
[28:44] operations this word operations means
[28:46] working or the way it works or the
[28:48] effect that it
[28:50] has so this means you can have one gift
[28:53] called evangelist and that evangelist
[28:55] you can have 10 different evangelists
[28:57] and they can can all operate differently
[28:59] it can all be ministered differently it
[29:01] can operated differently they're not
[29:02] cookie cutter it's not the same you can
[29:04] say it's the same office amen but it
[29:06] operates differently the same way with
[29:08] pastors you can say there's a pastor and
[29:10] when you say Pastor you may get in your
[29:11] mind an image of what a pastor should be
[29:14] amen but don't forget there's
[29:15] differences of administration and
[29:17] there's diversities of operations amen
[29:19] it's not all Cookie Cutter the same and
[29:21] I've had people tell me before amen they
[29:24] said I don't believe that man's called
[29:25] to be a pastor he's really an evangelist
[29:29] or he's really this and I'm saying God
[29:31] placed him over that church that church
[29:33] voted him in as a pastor how can you and
[29:35] your arrogance say that what God has
[29:37] allowed is wrong it's because your own
[29:39] preconceived idea I believe a pastor
[29:42] should be this I believe an evangelist
[29:44] should be this I believe this amen
[29:47] that's wrong amen what God places God
[29:49] places these are elect offices
[29:51] predestinated by almighty God and he
[29:54] knows who to fill each office with and
[29:57] we need to get our own thinking out of
[29:59] the way and let God Express himself the
[30:01] any way that God wants to express
[30:03] himself and quit quit using our own
[30:06] carnal our own history our own
[30:08] Traditions to say well he's a pastor
[30:10] he's not a pastor Hey listen if God
[30:12] called him to be a pastor and that local
[30:14] congregation voted him in place that's
[30:16] the voice of the Holy Ghost in that
[30:17] place he's a pastor and if he's been a
[30:20] pastor for 30 some years how are you
[30:22] going to come along and say he's not
[30:23] really Pastor he's really an
[30:26] evangelist m goodness what an arrogant
[30:28] spirit amen what I mean those people are
[30:31] happy they're growing under that
[30:32] Ministry why would we say something like
[30:34] that right I'll tell you why we'd say
[30:37] something like that because we're too
[30:38] proud and
[30:43] too
[30:45] amen but we need to realize that the
[30:47] spirit divideth severly as he willth
[30:50] amen there are diversities of gifts and
[30:52] differences in operation and differences
[30:55] in administration amen this should help
[30:58] all of us because I don't have to be
[31:00] like anybody
[31:02] else you don't have to be like anybody
[31:05] else the moment we can relax and just be
[31:07] what God gave us to be we're going to be
[31:09] the best help we can ever be to the body
[31:11] amen amen but as soon as we start
[31:13] getting uncomfortable and trying to
[31:15] match something else or somebody's idea
[31:17] of what we should be all of a sudden
[31:18] we're going to be hindering the moving
[31:20] of the spirit in our Liv amen because
[31:22] God worked a long time to get you
[31:24] fashioned a certain way brother Brenham
[31:26] said he bred this one to this one and
[31:27] this one to this one to get the Chim to
[31:29] have a certain tting and we think I need
[31:31] to be like this brother over here and
[31:33] God's been working for generations to
[31:35] get you a certain way so that he can get
[31:37] a certain ring out of our lives and we
[31:39] think because of this idea or this
[31:42] traditional teaching or because I was
[31:44] told this by somebody that listen we
[31:46] need to learn to relax and say God you
[31:49] called me amen you filled me with your
[31:50] spirit I'm born again by your spirit
[31:52] there's a purpose that I'm here and I
[31:54] need to relax amen amen
[31:58] what did Brother Bram say was the key to
[31:59] operating any
[32:00] gift to
[32:03] relax amen and I tell you it's the
[32:06] hardest thing to
[32:07] do brother B said in the voice of the
[32:10] sign he said Moses no one else could
[32:12] take his place no one else could do the
[32:14] job he was ordained to do it I love this
[32:19] God knew Moses would be the one Moses
[32:21] was born under a sign Moses was
[32:23] predestinated to take that position
[32:25] Moses tried in his own strength and he
[32:27] failed and he ran out into the
[32:29] Wilderness and for 40 years Amen brother
[32:31] B said God was beating Moses out of
[32:33] Moses amen so when God comes back to
[32:35] call Moses back to the commission back
[32:38] to what he formed him for back to why he
[32:40] was born amen Moses had gotten so
[32:42] humbled by his failure and so beat down
[32:45] with a hot-tempered wife on the back
[32:46] side of a
[32:49] desert that when God comes to Moses
[32:51] Moses I'm calling he says I can't do it
[32:53] Moses they won't listen to me Moses but
[32:55] I'm I'm I'm slow of speech until God
[32:58] became angry with
[33:01] Moses because Moses was I can't do it
[33:04] they won't hear me I don't send somebody
[33:08] else Moses is all worked up and and you
[33:11] and I you and I Amen in our human
[33:14] thinking we think well just forget about
[33:16] Moses go find someone else there's no
[33:18] plan B there's nobody else Moses was
[33:21] predestinated to have that position God
[33:24] cannot do away with him there's a
[33:26] predestined ated seed that before the
[33:28] foundation of the world when God said
[33:30] amen when God knew in his mind there
[33:32] would be a deliverer and that he would
[33:33] bring him out with a mighty hand he
[33:35] foresaw Moses when he said a virgin
[33:38] shall conceive he foresaw Mary there's
[33:41] not another option there's no plan be
[33:46] right so that's why he talks to Moses
[33:50] and Moses resist and mo he asked him
[33:52] again Moses resist and there's this
[33:54] dialogue back and forth until God is
[33:56] getting angry with Moses and I would be
[33:58] like forget it get somebody else that
[34:01] send out
[34:03] applications there's got to be somebody
[34:05] that can do this there was nobody God
[34:07] had to keep working with Moses until
[34:09] Moses went because Moses was the only
[34:13] one what does that say about you and
[34:17] I that God can just get another one not
[34:19] if I was the one he foresaw before the
[34:22] foundation of the world there's no plan
[34:24] B right there just NE there's just you
[34:28] amen we've got to take our
[34:32] place no one else could take his place
[34:34] no one else could do the job he was
[34:36] ordained to do it and brother and sister
[34:39] if you've got eternal life you were
[34:41] ordained to do a certain
[34:43] thing and listen closely what the
[34:45] prophet says do you believe you've got
[34:47] eternal life by the grace of God the
[34:50] faith in your heart says I I have
[34:52] eternal life then you were ordained to
[34:55] do a certain thing you're you're not
[34:57] just here to be
[34:59] here right maybe a good housewife look
[35:03] at what he says maybe a good housewife
[35:05] maybe something else but nobody can take
[35:08] your place God has made you a place
[35:11] don't try to take somebody else's place
[35:13] that's carnal impersonations see shows
[35:16] there is something wrong with you be
[35:18] what you are just exactly don't be
[35:21] nothing
[35:22] else amen thank
[35:25] God every time I tried to be something
[35:27] else I
[35:28] failed and embarrass I embarrassed
[35:30] myself being me but anyways at least
[35:32] it's at least it's honest and
[35:38] true again in the voice of the son he
[35:41] says when God has called a person for a
[35:43] job to do there is no one can take its
[35:45] place there is no one can take your
[35:48] place your
[35:51] peculiarity and all of us can say Amen
[35:53] about everybody
[35:54] else everybody's got peculiar arities
[35:57] there's individual I mean we know it am
[35:59] mean we don't have to go around the room
[36:01] and ask people to stand up and give
[36:02] description we all know that we all have
[36:05] peculiarities there's a uniqueness to
[36:07] each one of us like our fingerprint amen
[36:09] there's no two that are exactly like
[36:10] you'll find some people that similar but
[36:12] no two are exactly like why did God do
[36:14] it that way amen because he's got a
[36:16] certain thing for you and I to do
[36:20] amen he said how often I wondered how I
[36:23] would like to take oral Robert's Place
[36:24] how I would like to take Billy Graham's
[36:26] place somebody like that like Billy
[36:28] Graham go speak to an audience of people
[36:30] call Sinners to the altar forget it and
[36:32] go home and not have to stand there and
[36:33] wrestle again I cannot be Billy Graham
[36:36] but neither can Billy Graham be me I
[36:39] cannot be or Roberts or Roberts cannot
[36:41] be me you're each one set in God's
[36:43] economy just for its
[36:45] place one fast all the time and communes
[36:49] with God while another one cast out
[36:51] Devils because this one is fasting amen
[36:54] but it's the whole body of Christ
[36:56] working together the
[37:01] unity the whole body of Christ working
[37:05] together one will Fast and pray the
[37:09] other one will cast out Devils because
[37:11] the one fasting and praying is helping
[37:14] the one that's casting out devils and
[37:16] the whole body is working together in
[37:20] unity that's why we can't all do the
[37:22] same
[37:23] thing we all have to fill a
[37:28] role amen let's go uh back to uh chapter
[37:33] 12 here 1 Corinthians 12 and verse
[37:37] 8 for to one is given by the spirit the
[37:40] word of wisdom to another the word of
[37:43] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[37:46] Faith by The Same Spirit to another
[37:48] Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[37:50] another the working of Miracles to
[37:52] another prophecy to another Discerning
[37:55] of spirits to another another diverse
[37:57] kinds of tongues to another the
[37:59] interpretation of tongues but all these
[38:01] work at that one and self-same spirit
[38:04] dividing to every man severly as he
[38:08] will I want to write these down so you
[38:11] can have them and you can write them
[38:12] down with
[38:14] me I want to write down these gifts that
[38:17] we just read
[38:20] about
[38:25] wisdom
[38:31] knowledge
[38:35] Faith
[38:40] healing
[38:44] Miracles
[38:49] prophecy
[38:52] Discerning of
[38:55] spirits
[39:00] tongues and
[39:02] interpretation of
[39:13] tongues all right brother brandham calls
[39:16] these the the nine gifts of the Spirit
[39:19] he takes out of 1 Corinthians 12 and he
[39:21] often calls them the nine spiritual
[39:23] gifts said all these gifts are in the
[39:25] body and they're always to be in the
[39:26] body and they're there to keep the
[39:28] church clean man I want to write them
[39:30] down because because many times when we
[39:32] look at the gifts of the Spirit amen
[39:34] when we talk about gifts of the Spirit
[39:36] often times we just think of a couple of
[39:38] them we think of the ones that are maybe
[39:39] more dynamic or they're more prevalent
[39:41] but if you look at them wisdom is a gift
[39:43] of the
[39:44] spirit wisdom is the use and placing of
[39:48] knowledge and understanding knowledge
[39:50] amen that's that word in in uh in the
[39:53] Greek means science Amen brother BR said
[39:55] it's Holy Ghost knowledge amen an
[39:57] understanding of God and the things of
[39:59] God wisdom knowledge Faith healing
[40:02] Miracles prophecy Discerning of spirits
[40:04] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[40:07] amen so I wanted to write them down so
[40:09] we can see these are all gifts of the
[40:11] Spirit amen and God has placed them in
[40:13] the body amen I set at the vantage point
[40:16] where I I told you before where I get to
[40:17] know that there's these gifts in the
[40:19] body amen because I know I know who
[40:21] prays in tongues I may not know
[40:23] everybody but I know several who pray in
[40:24] tongues I know Gifts of inter prayer
[40:27] that are in the body amen I know that we
[40:29] have a sister here who God will wake up
[40:31] in the middle of the night amen with a
[40:32] burden on her heart she'll go to pray
[40:34] and break into tongues and praying until
[40:36] it releases those gifts are in the body
[40:39] brother Bram said they're in the body
[40:40] they remain in the body they need to be
[40:42] in the body and they're here to keep the
[40:43] body clean to keep the church clean so
[40:47] those gifts are here but we all don't
[40:49] seek the same gift we all don't want the
[40:51] same gift we're all not after Chasing
[40:53] After the same thing we're here to be
[40:55] we're here to to receive what God has
[40:57] given us amen and to express what God
[40:59] has given
[41:01] us amen sometimes it's easy to know if
[41:04] you have to give a
[41:06] tongues but do you how do you know if
[41:08] you have the gift of
[41:10] wisdom you see what I'm saying or the
[41:13] gift of knowledge or the gift of faith
[41:16] Every Man's been given a Measure of
[41:17] Faith amen that's his faith to believe
[41:19] but this is something different this is
[41:20] a gift of faith there's some people that
[41:22] just have that gift of bulldog faith and
[41:24] when they really go to seek something
[41:26] from from God they get answers amen
[41:29] healing Miracles prophecy amen some of
[41:32] these things are already working in our
[41:34] life and other people recognize it in us
[41:36] and we may fail to recognize it
[41:39] ourself but these gifts are here we're
[41:42] going to go into some others as well as
[41:44] we move on we're not going to stop there
[41:46] but let's keep
[41:48] reading let's keep
[41:55] reading for as the body is one and hath
[41:57] many members and all the members of that
[41:59] one body being many are one body so also
[42:03] is
[42:04] Christ amen Christ is now expressed in a
[42:08] many membered body for by one Spirit we
[42:11] are all baptized into one body whether
[42:13] we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be
[42:15] Bond or free and have been all made to
[42:17] drink into one spirit for the body is
[42:20] not one member but many if the foot
[42:22] shall say because I am not the hand I am
[42:24] not of the body is it therefore not of
[42:26] the body and if the ear shall say
[42:28] because I am not of the not I am not the
[42:31] eye I am not of the body is it therefore
[42:33] not of the body if the whole body were
[42:36] an eye where were the hearing if the
[42:38] whole were hearing where were the
[42:40] smelling but now hath God set in set the
[42:44] members every one of them in the body as
[42:47] it hath pleased
[42:49] him you got that amen you say I want to
[42:52] be this or that no he has set you in the
[42:54] body as it pleased him amen
[42:58] amen as it has pleased him verse 19 and
[43:01] if there were all one member where were
[43:03] the body but now are they many members
[43:06] yet but one body and the eye cannot say
[43:09] unto the hand I have no need of thee nor
[43:11] again the head to the feet I have no
[43:13] need of you nay much more those members
[43:15] of the body which seem to be more feeble
[43:18] are necessary and those members of the
[43:20] body which we think to be less honorable
[43:23] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[43:25] and uncomely Parts have more abundant
[43:28] comeliness for our comely Parts have no
[43:30] need but God has tempered the body
[43:32] together having given more abundant
[43:34] honor to that part which lacked that
[43:37] there should be no Schism division no
[43:39] Schism in the body amen but that the
[43:43] members should have the same care one
[43:46] for another and whether one member
[43:48] suffer all members suffer with it or one
[43:50] member be honored all members Rejoice
[43:52] with it now ye are the body of Christ
[43:55] and members in
[43:57] particular amen what what's Paul telling
[44:00] us the Apostle Paul is taking our
[44:01] natural bodies that we have and he's
[44:03] typing it to the body of Christ to the
[44:06] spiritual body and he's showing you have
[44:08] many members and there's different
[44:09] operations and there's diversity of
[44:11] operations and and they operate
[44:13] differently but you can't do without any
[44:15] Amen in fact you you put more abundant
[44:17] Honor on the part that's
[44:19] lacking if you were missing a part amen
[44:22] all of a sudden you would realize how
[44:23] bad that you needed it amen I mean you
[44:26] think there's there's so many of us here
[44:28] tonight there's probably 150 to 200 of
[44:31] us here tonight amen but brother
[44:32] emanuel's not here and how many you
[44:35] notice brother emanuel's not here
[44:37] there's a part that's lacking and we
[44:39] notice it amen how many are encouraged
[44:41] when you hear Brother emanuel's big amen
[44:43] amen so you can see when the part's
[44:46] lacking then all of a sudden like a I
[44:48] wish brother Emanuel was
[44:50] here that goes for each one of us we all
[44:53] have something to contribute something
[44:54] to do amen amen we think oh there's so
[44:57] many of us we won't notice if I'm gone
[44:59] amen somebody will notice if you're gone
[45:01] in fact if half of us were gone how
[45:03] discouraged would the other half
[45:05] be you'd come to church you'd be
[45:07] discouraged where's everybody at why
[45:09] aren't they here you don't realize that
[45:11] sometimes our very presence is making a
[45:13] difference creating an atmosphere
[45:14] bringing the bringing the right
[45:16] atmosphere maybe not just for myself
[45:18] maybe to help the person next to me but
[45:20] my very presence can change everything
[45:23] amen that I'm not just showing up to be
[45:26] there I'm not just a tagalong I'm not an
[45:28] extra part there are no extra parts
[45:30] there are no tagalong and there are no
[45:32] free riters everybody's
[45:35] contributing right and when we envision
[45:37] ourselves as contributing we won't we
[45:39] won't any longer just come along and
[45:42] Slough down and sit there and hope
[45:44] something happens that's not why you're
[45:45] here you're here to make something
[45:47] happen you're here to edify the body to
[45:50] build it up you're here to be a joint
[45:51] that supplies you're not here to see if
[45:53] something will happen you're here to
[45:55] make something
[45:58] happen is that what the scripture tells
[46:02] us I hope something happens tonight I
[46:06] hope somebody I hope everybody else is
[46:10] pulling it's not the way it
[46:13] works
[46:16] amen oh I'm going to get back to this
[46:18] list but I I I want to do something
[46:22] else but I'm going to come back to our
[46:24] list
[46:26] I was thinking about our body after
[46:28] reading through uh 1 Corinthians chapter
[46:30] 12 and how every part and how we know
[46:33] that we're fearfully and wonderfully
[46:34] made and this is a a picture or a type
[46:36] of the body of Christ it's a
[46:38] many-membered body not everybody doing
[46:40] the same thing not everybody with the
[46:41] same role not everybody with the same
[46:43] function amen but we all got a part to
[46:45] play and I was thinking about I was just
[46:48] in my mind thinking about oh what's
[46:50] parts of the body that we take for
[46:52] granted you know what what this and that
[46:53] and the other and I was thinking what
[46:55] about my pinky
[46:56] toe is my little toe important and then
[46:59] I begin to realize when you think about
[47:01] it you it goes unnoticed you don't
[47:03] really pay much attention to it amen
[47:05] it's just a part that's there but if
[47:07] you're if you're in a in an activity or
[47:09] you're working or you're playing a sport
[47:11] and you take a hard step far to the
[47:13] right amen and you have to go quickly to
[47:15] the right and stop instantly amen if you
[47:17] didn't have a pinky to the one next to
[47:18] it to catch you there you could topple
[47:20] over you may not use it every step it
[47:23] may not be the most important part but
[47:25] there are times when you need it and
[47:28] when you need it you're glad it's there
[47:30] yeah and sometimes you don't even notice
[47:32] the function that it has yeah because it
[47:35] just happens that's the same thing true
[47:37] with all of us sometimes we don't even
[47:39] notice the function that each one's
[47:41] serving because it's just coming
[47:43] naturally It's Just Happening that's
[47:45] right I was thinking about skin nobody
[47:48] gets excited about skin but skin is the
[47:51] largest organ in your body the largest
[47:54] organ in your body is your skin and your
[47:55] Skin's made up of a ton of little cells
[47:59] compacted together and fitted together
[48:01] to make an impermeable water type
[48:03] barrier and that skin is protecting your
[48:05] entire body yeah detecting it from
[48:08] protecting from chemicals protecting it
[48:09] from abrasion protecting your
[48:11] capillaries and your blood vessels and
[48:13] and also holding in the moisture so you
[48:15] don't dehydrate
[48:16] instantly that skin is is doing
[48:19] something really important but we don't
[48:20] ever think about it unless we cut it you
[48:22] know and then when we cut it you got to
[48:24] watch for infection because that was the
[48:25] barrier to guard us against infection
[48:27] now can come in and so all of a sudden
[48:31] every part of it important you can't
[48:33] have a part just bail out one day and
[48:35] then all of a sudden all the water vapor
[48:36] leaving your body and infections coming
[48:38] in you understand it may go unnoticed it
[48:41] may not have a a grand title it may not
[48:44] do something that super important it may
[48:46] not be the part that pulls the trigger
[48:48] it may not be the part that speaks the
[48:49] word it may not be the part that sees
[48:51] amen but it's a part there that if it
[48:53] wasn't there there would be a gap and
[48:55] some something bad would happen amen
[48:58] amen so all of these things you know
[49:01] sometimes because we've lived in a
[49:03] society based on
[49:06] Pride we part putting statuses to things
[49:10] this role is more important in this
[49:12] office and and this is an important part
[49:14] and that's not an important
[49:16] part we got to get rid of that tell me
[49:18] which is not an important part in the
[49:20] body of Christ right tell me which part
[49:22] that God predestinated ordained to be
[49:24] here is not needed or not necessary are
[49:27] not as important as another part we got
[49:29] to get that thinking clear out of our
[49:30] minds and that's the part that has us
[49:32] come and sit in our seats and do nothing
[49:34] amen because we think I don't have a
[49:35] title I don't have an office nobody's
[49:37] asked me to do nothing Hey listen God's
[49:40] asked you to do something from before
[49:41] the foundation of the world he placed
[49:43] you there for a reason
[49:45] amen you say what do I do I don't know
[49:49] just do what comes
[49:51] natural right amen I was going to
[49:56] I was going to take a look at one other
[49:57] part just to drive the drive the message
[50:00] home it was quite
[50:03] funny I was thinking about
[50:06] eyebrows some people care so much about
[50:08] the eyebrows and you know they pluck
[50:10] them and they do all kinds of funny
[50:11] stuff with them they're part of our face
[50:13] and you know I think ah they're not
[50:15] really people that overemphasize
[50:19] eyebrows you know it becomes a beauty
[50:22] thing and all that
[50:24] nonsense but I went to look at it and I
[50:27] said well yeah I can see they're
[50:28] important you know cuz the shape when
[50:29] you're sweating it takes the water
[50:31] whether it's raining or you're sweating
[50:32] and it moves the water to the outside
[50:34] and drops around your eyes so that you
[50:36] don't get that sweat in your eyes and
[50:38] when you're in strenuous activity and
[50:39] working or or running and and if it was
[50:41] getting your eyes it would blur your
[50:42] vision you could fall you could hurt
[50:44] yourself eyebrows are
[50:46] important right so I go looking at that
[50:49] yeah even eyebrows are
[50:51] important but then I I actually went and
[50:53] looked at it and I found out some part
[50:55] that we think would be insignificant has
[50:58] way more significance than I ever
[50:59] dreamed of and that's what stunned me
[51:02] that's why I wanted to uh draw this out
[51:04] cu it's just it's a funny little silly
[51:06] thing but I hope it gets the point gets
[51:09] the point
[51:14] home now you know how good I draw so you
[51:18] guys just have to forgive
[51:24] me
[51:27] why on Earth are you
[51:34] laughing all
[51:37] right these are three of my
[51:40] friends and these three friends of mine
[51:42] have no
[51:44] eyebrows but who cares CU eyebrows
[51:48] aren't important right why I mean if you
[51:49] want to keep sweat out of your eyes so
[51:50] you don't get blurred vision you don't
[51:51] run into a tree running from a grizzly
[51:54] bear
[51:56] but then when I actually went and looked
[51:58] at it it it struck me funny that
[52:00] eyebrows are way more important than I
[52:24] thought
[52:26] you get the
[52:28] point I thought it was of no value but
[52:33] most of our non-verbal communication
[52:35] comes through our
[52:37] eyebrows I didn't even realize this till
[52:39] I looked it up when you find somebody
[52:41] that you say is more expressive than the
[52:42] others usually they have more range of
[52:43] motion in their
[52:45] eyebrows and that person's super
[52:47] expressive it's because they can really
[52:50] get those eyebrows going and I didn't
[52:53] even realize that I've I've lived lived
[52:55] in this all my life and didn't even
[52:57] realize that that's the part that I was
[52:59] feeding on that's the part that was
[53:01] singly me that was part that was taking
[53:03] the words and I was matching the words
[53:05] with the expression to get the right
[53:07] understanding of the communication so
[53:09] much of what's being communicated is
[53:10] coming through the facial
[53:12] expression so we would say in
[53:14] communication the mouth is the most
[53:16] important part or this is the most
[53:18] important part but all of a sudden if
[53:19] you do away from the eyebrows you can
[53:21] have all kinds of misunderstandings and
[53:23] miscues amen and all goes together
[53:26] because the body is fashioned and knit
[53:28] together where every part is necessary
[53:31] amen and it works together so
[53:33] communication listen I never would have
[53:35] dreamed until yeah yesterday and today
[53:37] when I looked at it that communication
[53:39] that eyebrows are necessary for
[53:43] communication so then all of a sudden I
[53:45] want to take that silly little lesson
[53:47] and I want to bring it home and you may
[53:49] sit there and think you know what I do
[53:51] goes unnoticed I don't know that I have
[53:53] a part I I just come to church and I
[53:56] just do my thing you may not put value
[53:58] on it but not realize how much value is
[54:01] actually there amen because church is
[54:03] not just about coming and having a
[54:05] church service amen church is 24/7
[54:08] church is not the building church is the
[54:10] body of Christ we are the church amen
[54:12] and we are interconnected and we're
[54:14] depending on one another and we're
[54:16] caring for one another we're encouraging
[54:18] one another we're admonishing one
[54:20] another we're provoking one another our
[54:23] whole spiritual growth is based on our
[54:25] connections to one another amen it's not
[54:27] just Sunday it's not just Wednesday it's
[54:29] not just during the preaching but we are
[54:32] absolutely intricately involved with one
[54:34] another and linked together and we are
[54:36] depending on each other for these links
[54:38] and so we've got to get the whole notion
[54:40] of well that's an important part and
[54:42] that's not an important part amen I
[54:44] didn't realize that eyebrows were an
[54:45] important part but now I know that
[54:47] eyebrows were an important part and we
[54:49] may not realize how just the simple fact
[54:51] of caring for one another is maybe the
[54:54] most important part heart of all amen
[54:57] the simple things amen the things that
[54:59] happen all the time that go unnoticed
[55:01] like when you communicate with somebody
[55:03] and watching their eyebrows move all
[55:04] your life and never notice that that was
[55:06] the part that was actually speaking to
[55:08] me amen there's Parts in this body that
[55:10] is making the body of Christ fit
[55:12] together and we may not even be able to
[55:14] put our finger on it amen but it's
[55:16] working
[55:19] together so we got to get past this
[55:22] notion of this is a that's a this is a p
[55:26] in the body that's an important part
[55:28] that's not an important
[55:30] parten let it all fade away and say God
[55:34] help me to take my part help me to take
[55:37] my part and I'll tell you when it comes
[55:40] down to it you say brother Chad what do
[55:41] you want us to do I mean more than
[55:43] anything what I want all of us to do is
[55:45] I want us all to surrender to the plan
[55:47] of God and be engaged and be connected
[55:49] and be knit together and serve one
[55:51] another in any capacity we have to serve
[55:53] and Love One Another Not Just just here
[55:55] but in the bride worldwide amen we each
[55:57] have a part to fill here for in a local
[55:59] assembly but I want as an assembly to
[56:01] fill a part in the global body of of
[56:03] Jesus Christ I want us Amen to be a
[56:06] joint that supplieth amen I want to be a
[56:08] member that gives to the measure of the
[56:10] edifying together of itself in
[56:13] love whether it's called important or
[56:15] not important it's all
[56:18] important whether we call it big or
[56:20] little it doesn't matter to me I just
[56:21] want to do my
[56:23] part 1 Corinthians chap 12 let's keep
[56:26] reading now verse
[56:30] 28 and God has set some in the church
[56:33] first apostles secondary prophets
[56:35] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[56:38] then Gifts of healing helps governments
[56:42] diversities of tongues are all Apostles
[56:46] are all prophets are all teachers are
[56:49] all workers of Miracles have all the
[56:51] gifts of healing do all speak with
[56:53] tongues do all inter interpret but covet
[56:56] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[56:58] unto you a more excellent way what is
[57:01] the more excellent way he's going to get
[57:02] to that in Chapter 13 the more excellent
[57:04] way is the way of Love charity and it
[57:07] should override everything but I want to
[57:10] look he added two more positions in the
[57:13] body or or our parts in the body he
[57:16] added in this in verse 28 helps and
[57:19] governments so I want to add them to our
[57:22] list
[57:23] here
[57:32] helps in
[57:37] governments so helps I look this word up
[57:40] and helps
[57:43] means to
[57:47] Aid or
[57:50] support God has placed this in the
[57:53] body help
[57:56] he's placed in the body governments this
[57:59] governments means to
[58:02] steer it comes from the word of a
[58:05] captain of a ship to guide the ship so
[58:08] his governments is to steer or you could
[58:10] say to direct to
[58:19] direct God placed that in the
[58:23] body you know I'm hoping that our
[58:26] understanding can expand Beyond whatever
[58:28] our tradition is say you know what God
[58:32] has diversity of gifts diversity of
[58:34] administrations diversity of operations
[58:36] and God has placed in the body helps
[58:39] those to Aid or to support and
[58:41] governments those who will take charge
[58:43] of something and direct something God
[58:45] placed that in the
[58:47] body brother BM says in Christ is the
[58:49] mystery of God revealed he says don't
[58:51] never Clan among or talk and make
[58:53] yourself clannish we are are one I
[58:56] couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[58:57] I'm going to take you away cuz you're my
[58:59] not my right hand he's my left hand I
[59:01] want him to stay there even the little
[59:03] tip of my finger I want to stay right
[59:04] there every little part of my body stay
[59:07] right there and God wants us as a body
[59:09] of Believers to stay right exactly with
[59:11] one another right at with one another
[59:14] and now you've got tapes on that you've
[59:16] got tapes on what we believe you've got
[59:18] tapes on discipline in the church how we
[59:20] behave ourselves in the Church of God
[59:22] how we got to come here together and sit
[59:24] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[59:26] home if God is in your heart you can't
[59:28] hardly wait for them doors to open
[59:29] Yonder to get in here to fellowship with
[59:31] your brothers if you don't don't feel
[59:34] that way then I tell you it's time you
[59:36] got to
[59:37] pray God wants us to stay right with one
[59:40] another connected as a body he says in
[59:43] the message three kind of Believers he
[59:45] said Joseph another believer he couldn't
[59:47] help being what he was he was a prophet
[59:50] you know Joseph didn't try to be a
[59:52] prophet brother bam didn't try to be a
[59:55] prophet they were born that way they
[59:58] didn't aspire to become that they
[1:00:00] weren't trying to be that and I'll tell
[1:00:02] you the same thing's true if you're in
[1:00:03] the fivefold ministry you're not trying
[1:00:05] to be a preacher amen that's a that's
[1:00:07] the elect office of God God chose that
[1:00:10] we're not trying to be this we're not
[1:00:13] trying to be that don't try to be
[1:00:15] anything amen just be what God made you
[1:00:17] to be and all of it will just start to
[1:00:19] come out
[1:00:21] amen amen he was a prophet God made him
[1:00:24] a prophet he didn't want to be different
[1:00:26] from his brothers but he was different
[1:00:29] God made him what he was nobody else
[1:00:31] could take his place nobody can take
[1:00:33] your place no matter how little you say
[1:00:35] I'm just a housewife nobody can take
[1:00:37] your place God in his great economy has
[1:00:39] set it so the body of Christ in order
[1:00:41] till there's no one can take your place
[1:00:44] how I would like to take Billy Grant's
[1:00:46] place any of us ministers but we can't
[1:00:48] do it but just remember Billy can't take
[1:00:50] our place so we all have a place some of
[1:00:52] us are are evangelist some prophets some
[1:00:55] teachers some pastors whatever we are
[1:00:57] some Housewives some mechanics some
[1:00:59] Farmers Whatever It Is God has set you
[1:01:02] in your
[1:01:03] place if God has set you in your place
[1:01:06] and set me in my place I don't think we
[1:01:08] should belittle our
[1:01:09] place I don't think we should ever
[1:01:11] belittle it on how much it's noticed or
[1:01:13] not noticed how much it's recognized or
[1:01:15] not recognized if God has set us in our
[1:01:17] place I don't think we should belittle
[1:01:19] that place I think we should give our
[1:01:22] whole Hearts to it Romans CH 12 let's
[1:01:25] turn there
[1:01:27] together I going to look at another
[1:01:29] portion of
[1:01:38] scripture and we'll start to wind it up
[1:01:40] with this
[1:01:44] here Romans chapter 12 verse
[1:01:51] 3 for I say through the grace given unto
[1:01:54] me to every man that is among you not to
[1:01:56] think of himself more highly than he
[1:01:58] ought to think but to think soberly
[1:02:00] according as God has dealt to every man
[1:02:02] The Measure of Faith for as we have many
[1:02:05] members in one body and all members have
[1:02:07] not the same office so we being many are
[1:02:10] one body in Christ and everyone members
[1:02:12] one of another having then gifts
[1:02:14] differing according to the grace that is
[1:02:16] given to us whether prophecy let us
[1:02:18] prophesy according to the proportion of
[1:02:20] faith our ministry let us wait on our
[1:02:23] ministering or he that teacheth on
[1:02:25] teaching or he that exhorteth on
[1:02:27] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[1:02:30] with Simplicity he that ruleth with
[1:02:32] diligence he that showeth Mercy with
[1:02:35] cheerfulness let love be without
[1:02:38] dissimulation abore that which is evil
[1:02:40] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[1:02:42] affectionate one to another with
[1:02:44] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[1:02:47] another so I want to add a few more
[1:02:49] things that the Apostle Paul put in here
[1:02:52] amen out of Romans 12 and in Romans 12
[1:02:55] he adds these
[1:02:59] things these positions in the body he
[1:03:03] adds
[1:03:05] Ministry now immediately when we look at
[1:03:08] the word ministry we often think pull
[1:03:09] pit Ministry but that's not necessarily
[1:03:11] what this means this word ministry means
[1:03:13] to minister to or to serve it comes from
[1:03:15] the same uh Bas Greek word as Deacon and
[1:03:18] the Deacon is the waiter on tables are
[1:03:20] those that serve the body amen so this
[1:03:22] word ministry is not necessarily pull
[1:03:24] pit Ministry it's actually serving and
[1:03:26] ministering to one another so many of us
[1:03:30] do that then he added this
[1:03:36] one
[1:03:38] exhortation or he that exhorteth I'll
[1:03:41] write it down this way exhorteth
[1:03:43] this word exhorteth is interesting it
[1:03:46] means to console or to encourage or to
[1:03:51] strengthen to console or to encourage or
[1:03:54] to
[1:03:54] strengthen he added a part in the
[1:03:58] body of
[1:04:01] giving or he that
[1:04:04] ruleth so there's ruling this word
[1:04:07] ruling
[1:04:08] means to set in
[1:04:12] order like a
[1:04:14] superintendent and then he added Mercy
[1:04:18] it's what Paul
[1:04:19] said I looked at Mercy we all have mercy
[1:04:23] we have mercy on one another another but
[1:04:25] this word mercy
[1:04:28] means to
[1:04:31] help The
[1:04:35] Afflicted and the Apostle Paul makes
[1:04:37] this also parts of the
[1:04:42] body man I hope that we can see there's
[1:04:44] a lot more to this than maybe our
[1:04:46] traditional teaching had us
[1:04:48] thinking that God is building a body and
[1:04:51] he set the members in the body to
[1:04:53] accomplish Lish many
[1:04:55] things and I said God I just want to
[1:04:58] accomplish the part you gave me to
[1:05:01] accomplish amen I want to be there to do
[1:05:04] what you've called me to do in the
[1:05:07] identified Masterpiece of God the
[1:05:08] prophet says he has a purpose in your
[1:05:11] life each individual that no one else on
[1:05:13] the face of the Earth can take your
[1:05:14] place God has got something for you
[1:05:16] you're made like that you was did that
[1:05:18] way for a purpose God is Sovereign in
[1:05:20] his work amen we different one from
[1:05:24] another we notice in the animal life we
[1:05:27] find out in the animal life there's one
[1:05:28] animal God made a beast of burden like
[1:05:30] the horse he has to work and a cows a
[1:05:32] sacrifice and the lion and the tiger
[1:05:34] roams the force without any labor or
[1:05:35] anything he made a great big animal like
[1:05:38] an elephant he made a little bitty
[1:05:39] fellow like a mouse now who is there to
[1:05:41] tell God what to do and how to do it he
[1:05:43] does it his own way and he makes the
[1:05:45] mountains he makes the deserts he makes
[1:05:47] the Seas he makes the plains he makes
[1:05:49] one kind of tree hardwood palm and so
[1:05:51] forth he does he makes men different he
[1:05:53] gives us each one a different place and
[1:05:55] a palm tree can never be a hickory a
[1:05:57] hickory tree can never be a palm nobody
[1:05:59] can take your place and you shouldn't
[1:06:01] try to take anyone else's place because
[1:06:04] you're an individual to God and God has
[1:06:06] a purpose for you he made you thus you
[1:06:09] say why did he do it he's Sovereign he's
[1:06:12] got a reason for it being that
[1:06:15] way
[1:06:17] amen God's got a reason for it being
[1:06:20] that way brother Venom was made a
[1:06:22] certain way he had certain peculiarities
[1:06:24] he had certain trademarks of his
[1:06:25] personality but God made him that way he
[1:06:27] said I'm a Melancholy God made him that
[1:06:30] way amen there's so many things about us
[1:06:33] amen God made us that way he's Sovereign
[1:06:36] in it but he says but we find out that
[1:06:38] we're all guarded by the word in heaven
[1:06:41] we look at the celestial bodies the
[1:06:42] Bible says that even one star differs
[1:06:44] from the other there is Sirius and the
[1:06:46] different ones and Mars and Jupiter and
[1:06:48] all these different ones they different
[1:06:49] one from the other the sun difference
[1:06:51] from the Moon and the moon from the
[1:06:53] stars and there is Angels such as there
[1:06:55] are seraphim and cherubims and angels
[1:06:57] and great angels in degrees and even in
[1:06:59] the new world to come the kings of the
[1:07:01] earth bring their honor into the city
[1:07:03] we're always going to be that way I want
[1:07:07] you to understand that he's talking
[1:07:08] about in the new heavens and the new
[1:07:09] Earth amen we're always going to be
[1:07:11] different we're never going to come to
[1:07:13] the place where all of a sudden we're
[1:07:14] exactly the same no we're always going
[1:07:16] to be that way because God is not a
[1:07:19] Sears and robu Harmony House he's a god
[1:07:21] of variety he makes one one way and one
[1:07:24] another but we must serve him in the way
[1:07:26] that God made us and be glad and stay
[1:07:30] behind his word amen how am I supposed
[1:07:32] to serve him in the way that he has made
[1:07:34] me amen and the purpose that he has for
[1:07:36] me and the place that he has placed me
[1:07:38] in the body and the decision he had
[1:07:40] before the foundation world that's how
[1:07:42] I'm to serve
[1:07:44] God
[1:07:46] Amen praise God I want you to pay
[1:07:49] attention to this quote in the greatest
[1:07:52] battle ever fought he he says I thought
[1:07:55] of the order of the Heavenly hosts not
[1:07:58] one of them is out of place everyone
[1:08:01] keeps his time perfectly it's God's
[1:08:03] Great Army I thought of the soldiers how
[1:08:05] that if that Moon would happen to get
[1:08:06] out of order the Earth would be covered
[1:08:08] again with water just in a few minutes
[1:08:10] the Earth would be just like it was when
[1:08:12] God decided to use it for to have us
[1:08:14] here on it it was without form and void
[1:08:16] and darkness and water was upon the
[1:08:17] breath of the earth and if that Moon
[1:08:19] would ever move it would do the same
[1:08:20] thing
[1:08:21] again when the moon rocks back a little
[1:08:24] bit away from the earth the tides come
[1:08:25] up when it goes down just follows the
[1:08:27] tides it's God's Great Army and when I
[1:08:29] thought about that being God's Great
[1:08:31] Army there now now we went to bed and
[1:08:34] then I began to think that not one of
[1:08:36] those got out of their place they all
[1:08:38] set in place and if there's a moving
[1:08:40] anywhere of them it's for a cause and
[1:08:42] will affect this Earth we just see the
[1:08:44] results of it now from some of them
[1:08:46] moving into other spots it's effective
[1:08:48] it affects everything and I thought then
[1:08:50] if that great Heavenly Host like that
[1:08:52] has to keep its place to to make
[1:08:54] everything in order what about the
[1:08:55] disorder of the Earthly host how when
[1:08:58] one gets out of order it throws the
[1:09:00] whole thing out of cater the whole
[1:09:02] program of God is upset when one member
[1:09:04] gets out of order we should continually
[1:09:07] strive to keep the order of the
[1:09:10] spirit and I would to God this morning
[1:09:12] that we would bring this to a real
[1:09:14] healing service now listen pay close
[1:09:16] attention he's talking about everybody
[1:09:19] staying in their position and everybody
[1:09:20] staying in their place yeah now he says
[1:09:24] I would to God this morning that we
[1:09:26] bring this to a real healing
[1:09:28] service that we could keep this part
[1:09:31] group that which we have gathered under
[1:09:34] the roof this morning in such a Harmony
[1:09:37] that the Holy Spirit would place every
[1:09:39] member of the body that's here this
[1:09:41] morning in such Harmony till there would
[1:09:44] be such a spontaneous healing of the
[1:09:47] soul and body it'll if we'll just hold
[1:09:50] our positions amen amen
[1:09:54] my goodness when I read that it just
[1:09:56] stunned me said oh I'd like to bring
[1:09:58] that into a healing service what's he
[1:10:00] talking about the Heavenly Host all
[1:10:01] fitting their place and nothing gets out
[1:10:03] of order If It Moves it has an effect on
[1:10:05] the earth if it if the moon would move
[1:10:07] the Earth would be covered with water
[1:10:08] it's got to stay in God's position and
[1:10:10] move according to God's decree and now
[1:10:13] he said what about the Earthly host what
[1:10:15] if it gets out of order and I want to
[1:10:16] bring that into a healing service now
[1:10:18] till each one of us here that's under
[1:10:20] this roof would get in Harmony and get
[1:10:22] into our position and read and let me
[1:10:24] read it again and every member of the
[1:10:26] body that's here this morning in such
[1:10:28] Harmony till there would be such a
[1:10:30] spontaneous healing of soul and body if
[1:10:33] we'll just hold our
[1:10:39] position there's power in being what he
[1:10:42] called us to be there's power in staying
[1:10:44] where he called us to stay there's power
[1:10:46] in yielding to his spirit and
[1:10:48] surrendering and washing all of
[1:10:49] ourselves out of the way and let the
[1:10:51] Spirit come and do whatever he wants in
[1:10:53] our Liv lives whatever he's fashioned me
[1:10:55] for whatever he's placed me here for
[1:10:57] whatever position he wants I just want
[1:10:58] to surrender to him cuz I want to bring
[1:11:00] such a Unity such a Harmony in this
[1:11:02] place I don't want to be a part that's
[1:11:04] out of order I don't want to be trying
[1:11:06] to take somebody else's place I don't
[1:11:08] want to have the wrong idea about why he
[1:11:10] made me this I just want to get into the
[1:11:12] Harmony and the unity amen till there
[1:11:14] can be such a spontaneous healing of
[1:11:17] soul and body if we'll just hold our
[1:11:22] position
[1:11:24] so
[1:11:25] simple but so
[1:11:27] profound and you know when it comes to
[1:11:29] human beings so incredibly
[1:11:32] hard because we have so many self-doubts
[1:11:34] and we have so much Pride and Prejudice
[1:11:37] and jocking for position and pooling
[1:11:39] it's going to take a real death to self
[1:11:41] we've got to get rid of that nasty Pride
[1:11:43] that causes us wanted to rate things and
[1:11:45] move in positions and I need this spot
[1:11:47] and they shouldn't be in that spot and I
[1:11:48] should be this and they should do that
[1:11:50] and they could do that better we got to
[1:11:51] stop all of that nonsense and come come
[1:11:53] into a Harmony and say God positionally
[1:11:55] Place each one of us Place us God and

[1:16:58] lives and you know sometimes the things
[1:17:00] that encourage us on a Wednesday or
[1:17:02] Sunday and is not necessarily all the
[1:17:04] words that we heard over the pull pit
[1:17:06] but it was the love that was expressed
[1:17:08] to one another as we came and went in
[1:17:09] this place it was the atmosphere that we
[1:17:12] created around us that brought us out of
[1:17:14] the carnal out of the world and brought
[1:17:16] us into a different level and we walk
